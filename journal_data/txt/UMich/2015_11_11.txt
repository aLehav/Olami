ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

GOVERNMENT

Ford School hosts 
discussion with Rep. 

Dave Camp and 
Rep. Mike Rogers

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

Two alums of the U.S. House 

of Representatives — former 
Republican Congressmen Dave 
Camp and Mike Rogers — 
addressed a crowd of 120 people 
Tuesday night during the Ford 
School of Public Policy’s final 
Policy Talk of the fall semester.

Camp served in the House 

of Representatives for more 
than 24 years and is known for 
introducing the Tax Reform 
Act of 2014, a comprehensive 
tax reform bill. Rogers worked 
in Congress for more than 
14 
years, 
specializing 
in 

cybersecurity 
and 
national 

terrorism policy. Before his time 
as a representative, he served in 

the United States Army and was 
an FBI special agent.

Rogers, 
who 
chaired 
the 

Permanent Select Committee 
on 
Intelligence 
while 
in 

office, said he thought one of 
the biggest national security 
issues is how the United States 
prepares for cyber attack, due to 
the rapidly increasing technical 
capabilities 
of 
antagonistic 

countries.

“What most people would 

find shocking is that they 
are 
overwhelming 
us 
with 

numbers,” he said. “There are 
more SBR (Russian intelligence 
agents), or what you would 
know as KGB agents operating 
in 
the 
United 
States 
than 

there were at the height of the 
Cold War, and there are more 
Chinese espionage operations 
being conducted than we have 
ever seen.”

Rogers 
said 
the 
most 

important 
first 
step 
the 

government can take toward 
addressing the issue is cyber

Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Clarence Page moderates the discussion during the Diversity Summit held in Rackham Auditorium on Tuesday.

Hundreds fill 

Rackham as Schlissel 
calls on community 

for suggestions 

By LARA MOEHLMAN 
and ALLANA AKHTAR

Daily Staff Reporters

After 
hearing 
responses 

from audience members who 

filled 
Rackham 
Auditorium 

and crowded the lobby outside, 
University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel told the room that 
diversity is a long-term ideal 
that can only be improved with 
the help of every member of the 
community.

Schlissel 
and 
other 

administrators 
hosted 
a 

community-wide 
assembly 

Tuesday morning to discuss 
diversity 
and 
inclusion 
on 

campus. The assembly was 

part of the week-long Diversity 
Summit, organized to engage 
faculty and staff in dialogue 
and brainstorm solutions to 
make campus more inclusive.

The assembly was emceed 

by 
Pulitzer 
Prize-winning 

journalist Clarence Page, who 
told The Michigan Daily on 
Monday he hoped the forum 
would get people past their 
shyness in discussing race, 
gender and ethnicity in public.

“The University is one place 

where the very purpose of it 
is to learn about the universe, 
the world around you beyond 
the world you are accustomed 
to,” Page said. “I am glad the 
Michigan folks are doing it and 
I’m glad to be a part of it.”

Despite a slight increase 

in 
the 
enrollment 
of 

underrepresented 
minority 

students in the 2015 freshman 
class, Schlissel and members 
of the campus community have

EVENT PREVIEW

Two one-act 
operatic farces 
revived by ‘U’ 

students

By DAYTON HARE

Daily Arts Writer

Humans 
are 
irresistibly 

drawn to drama. Some people 
even have a penchant for creating 
it in their own lives, though most 
are content 
to 
witness 

it run havoc 
over 
oth-

ers — even 
if those oth-
ers are ficti-
tious. Thus, 
the 
theat-

rical 
per-

formance 
was 
born, 

and 
plays 

of 
expan-

sive 
emo-

tional depth 
became 
central 
to 

the 
soci-

etal psyche 

of peoples in locations ranging 
from the Yucatan to the Japa-
nese archipelago. Music has also 
been historically associated with 
drama and emotion, so it’s hard-
ly surprising that the two arts 
managed to combine into one of 
the oldest and most theatrical 
genres in classical music: opera.

This 
week, 
contributing 

a little bit more towards the 
400-year-old tradition of opera, 
students from the School of 
Music, Theatre & Dance will 
demonstrate this dramatic art 
in several performances of two 
one-act operas.

“Every time we try to select 

works to produce for the School 
of Music, Theatre & Dance, we 
try to find pieces that fit the 
student population that we have 
— the singing actors who are 
in the program — and we try to 
offer pieces that have as many 
roles as possible,” said Robert 
Swedberg, 
the 
production’s 

director and associate professor 
of music, in an interview with 
The Michigan Daily.

“We 
have 
a 
tremendous 

number of really worthy singing 
actors who we would like to 
be able to accommodate with

Resolution asks 
‘U’ to not assist 
in immigration 
enforcement

By JACKIE CHARNIGA

Daily Staff Reporter

Central Student Government 

brought 
multiple 
resolutions 

to 
the 
assembly 
floor 
at 

their 
Tuesday 
meeting, 

including 
proposals 
related 

to 
immigration 
policy 
and 

funding. During the session, 
CSG vetoed a resolution to 
support making the University 
a sanctuary campus and heard 
several options for spending 
the 
remainder 
of 
their 

legislative discretionary fund. 
The assembly also received 
an update on the University’s 
ongoing debate over the release 
of course evaluation data.

CSG 
President 
Cooper 

Charlton,

are ongoing with the Senate 
Advisory

The University’s Sociology 

Department 
hosted

Tuesday 
night 

meant to show students how

The

sharing, which involves real-
time 
information 
sharing 

between the government and 
the private sector.

“The amount of information 

that 
the 
private 
sector, 
a 

company 
like 
Google 
or 

Amazon, 
collects 
on 
you 

every day is staggering,” he 
said. “They know more about 
you than you could possibly 
imagine. The NSA would dream 
about having a database like 
that.”

However, he noted efforts to 

allow cyber sharing, including a 
bipartisan bill he worked on in 
office, have been unsuccessful 
because of citizens’ desires for 
privacy.

“Most Americans don’t know 

it, but the United States is in a 

cyber war, and, by the way, we 
are not winning,” he said. “We 
are losing this fight because 
we cannot get over this privacy 
versus security hangover.”

Camp also spoke about his 

legislative work, calling for 
reform in a different realm 
— taxes. In particular, he 
pointed to the need to change 
international tax laws.

“We really do have to make a 

change here,” Camp said. “Our 
business tax was changed in 
‘86 under President Reagan, 
but our international tax laws 
basically date back to the 60s. 
Clearly the ability for ideas, 
people and money to move 
around the world have changed 
dramatically since that time.” 

In addition to changes due to 

technology, Camp also pointed 
to a disconnect between the 
electorate and the U.S. economy.

“I don’t think we’ve seen the 

end of it,” Camp said. “I think 
part of the reason tax reform is 
being presented is there is this 
tremendous unhappiness with 
what is going on in the country, 
in particular Congress’s lack 
of response, and part of it is 
that we haven’t seen the kind 
of recovery that we wanted to 
see.”

Both also spoke to the future 

of Congress overall, citing a 
need for changes in how the 
body functions.

Camp 
said 
he 
thought 

congressional committees need 
to work on creating groundwork 
for larger, more controversial 
issues.

“I think that issues have 

to be developed. They have 
get back to work and propose 
things that might cause some 
controversy,” Camp said. “It’s 
not glamorous, but it’s the work 
that legislatures do. We have to 

get back to that and then have 
ways to bring them to the floor.”

Rogers 
said 
the 
current 

gridlock reflects the frustration 
in the United States toward the 
country’s lack of progress, and 
that the body needs to find a 
way to compromise to move 
forward.

“Congress 
is 
a 
lot 
like 

American,” he said. “We are 
sending those people there, 
and they are reflecting their 
districts in a pretty important 
way. That dysfunction is exactly 
what voters are like. They 
are frustrated about different 
things for different reasons and 
we are not telling legislatures 
to go and try and bridge the 
difference. We are telling them 
to go up there and fight and 
stand their ground and don’t 
agree to anything, and that gets 
us to a place where we do not 
function.”

UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI

System president resigns

WEDNESDAY:

In Other Ivory Towers

Two key administrators at 

the University of Missouri have 
resigned following a series of cam-
pus protests.

Tim Wolfe, University of Mis-

souri System president, resigned, 
effective immediately Monday 
morning, The Maneater reported. 
Chancellor R. Bowin Loftin also 
announced his resignation, effec-
tive Jan. 1, during a University of 
Missouri System Board of Cura-
tors meeting Monday evening.

Both resignations come amid a 

series of instances on campus that 
activists cited as evidence of a cul-
ture of discrimination, such as the 
end of Planned Parenthood ser-
vices and the student government 
president being called a racial slur.

In response to those instances, 

Missouri graduate student Jona-

than Butler announced Nov. 2 he 
was going on a hunger strike that 
he said would end either with 
his death or the ousting of Wolfe. 
Members of the Missouri football 
team announced Saturday that 
they would boycott all football-
related activities until the end of 
Butler’s hunger strike, with the 
support of head football coach 
Gary Pinkel.

“My decision to resign comes 

out of love, not hate,” Wolfe said 
during Monday’s meeting. “Use 
my resignation to heal and start 
talking again, to make the changes 
necessary.”

Fraternity files $25 million 

lawsuit against Rolling Stone

The University of Virginia’s 

chapter of Phi Kappa Psi, the main 
subject of a 2014 Rolling Stone 
article that detailed an alleged 
gang rape at their fraternity 
house, filed a $25 million lawsuit 
against the magazine and the sto-
ry’s author Monday.

The Cavalier Daily reported 

Monday that the lawsuit is based 
primarily on alleged defamation 
in the article, as well as subse-
quent public statements from the 
magazine and the reporter who 
wrote the story, Sabrina Erdely.

Erdely’s article was retracted 

in April following discrepancies 
in the story uncovered by both the 
Charlottesville Police, the Wash-
ington Post and the Columbia 
School of Journalism.

by 
Winter 
2016, 
a 
written 

commitment by the Faculty 
Senate regarding a new course 
evaluation instrument by fall of 
2016 and for the CSG executive 
committee to be given access to 
the content of course evaluations 
before an official release.

CSG 
Communications 

Director Alexandra George, a 
Public Policy junior, said CSG is 
privy to the information about 
course evaluations through one-
on-one meetings with members 
of the Faculty Senate.

“We have a timeline for the 

release of course evaluations, 
and we are willing to do 
whatever it takes to make sure 
that deadline is met,” George 
said.

George said CSG felt its efforts 

regarding 
course 
evaluations 

are not finished, and noted that 
the ability to review the results 
further would make them more 
equipped to make suggestions 
for improving the instrument 
and the questions asked.

“For 
Central 
Student 

Government to have course 
evaluation data at our disposal, 
we not only gain the ability to 
utilize a system of checks and 
balances, but we can further 
our agenda to improve the 
instrument itself,” George said.

Along 
with 
course 

evaluations, Charlton also said 
CSG is working with LSA Dean 
Andrew Martin to examine 
accommodations for students 
who require additional time 
during exams.
CSG vetoes sanctuary campus 

resolution

The 
assembly 
vetoed 

a 
resolution 
to 
make 
the 

University a sanctuary campus 
for undocumented students. The 
resolution was promoted by the 
activist group By Any Means 
Necessary.

Nine assembly members voted 

in favor, 10 were opposed and 12 
abstained from the vote.

The distinction would have 

meant 
that 
the 
University 

would promise not to turn 
over 
undocumented 
students 

to U.S. Immigrations Control 
and Enforcement, a pledge that 
has been taken up by several 
campuses and cities across the 

country, including Ann Arbor.

Before the assembly voted on 

the resolution, two amendments 
were allowed on the floor for 
voting, one written by BAMN 
and the other put forth by the 
Resolutions Committee.

The Resolutions Committee 

proposal aimed to clean up 
language in the amendment and 
remove words such as “racism” 
and “bigotry” to characterize 
the 
University’s 
opinion 
on 

undocumented students.

BAMN noted that they sat 

down 
with 
the 
Resolutions 

Committee 
to 
craft 
an 

amendment to their resolution, 
which is what they said they 
presented Tuesday, but CSG 
drafted their own resolution 
anyway.

Funding requests

CSG 
also 
considered 

resolutions regarding how to 
spend the remaining $18,000 
of its legislative fund, which is 
the amount the CSG budget sets 
aside for its own projects.

CSG began the year with 

$28,000 to be allocated at the 
discretion of the assembly.

Currently, the only initiative 

that has been funded was an 

initiative to open dining halls 
earlier on game days, for which 
CSG 
gave 
Michigan 
Dining 

$10,000. The aim of the program 
is to curb dangerous drinking on 
these days. There is $18,000 left 
in the fund.

The 
Maize 
and 
Blue 

Cupboard, a food bank program 
for University students, was the 
first funding request heard at 
Tuesday’s meeting.

The Maize and Blue Cupboard 

operates under Enactus, an 
entrepreneurial 
organization 

founded at the University. The 
cupboard takes unsold food 
from local grocery stores that 
would have been thrown away 
and distributes it to students 
at the Michigan Union one 
Wednesday per month.

The request asked CSG to 

pay a $650 application fee for 
the program to register as a 
nonprofit as well as $350 for the 
creation of a stockpile of canned 
goods for distribution.

Public Policy junior Matt 

Fidel, 
a 
co-author 
of 
the 

resolution, said there were no 
downsides to CSG involvement 
in the project.

“It’s an ideal role for CSG,” 

Fidel said. “We can reach a 
greater number of students.”

Business 
sophomore 
Zoe 

Hawtof , current president of 
the program, said the Maize 
and Blue Cupboard is like a 
second kitchen for students on 
campus who are unable to travel 
to Kroger or afford the prices of 
closer grocery stores.

“We want to be that extra 

monthly 
go-to 
place 
when 

a student feels like they’re 
struggling,” Hawtof said.

A second funding request 

for 15 additional water refill 
stations around the University 
was also put forward Tuesday, 
totalling to $7,500.

Resolution authors said the 

request was an effort to satisfy 
sustainability 
initiatives 
on 

campus by encouraging the use 
of refillable water bottles and 
lower waste from plastic water 
bottles.

Business 
senior 
Kevin 

Ziegler, CSG treasurer, said 
Barbara Hagan, a representative 
from the Office of Campus 
Sustainability, approached CSG 
about the project.

“There’s really two costs 

— the cost of the unit and the 

cost of installation,” Ziegler 
said, “We’re just paying for the 
units.”

Ziegler added that he’d like to 

hear from students where they 
believe the stations should be 
placed.

Rackham 
student 
Jared 

Ferguson, CSG rules committee 
chair, noted that CSG has funded 
similar initiatives in past years. 
In 2010, he said, CSG funded 18 
water refill stations.

“We’ve sort of been doing this 

off and on for the last several 
years,” Ferguson said.

Ziegler 
said 
the 
stations 

would be on both Central and

said there is more to be done. 
Earlier in the semester, Schlissel 
introduced the HAIL scholarship 
program to attract low-income 
students by giving them resources 
and information on financial aid 
prior to applying for college. In 
October, he announced a second 
scholarship — called Wolverine 
Pathways 
— 
which 
mentors 

middle and high school students 
from Southfield and Ypsilanti 
and gives them a full ride to the 
University upon admission.

With 
these 
initiatives 
in 

mind, Schlissel and Page asked 
audience members to come to 
a microphone and talk about 
their goals for a more inclusive 
campus — with the year 2025 
as a benchmark for evaluating 
potential successes.

“An 
interesting 
common 

theme, for me, which came out 
of several of the comments today, 
was the fact that improvement has 
to be led, but it can only come from 
the folks…in working groups, on 
admission committees,” Schlissel 
said. “It happens in the trenches 
as everyday acts of commitment, 
it doesn’t necessarily happen with 
folks sitting in front of a room 
making suggestions or setting 
rules.”

Emily Lawsin, a lecturer 

in the American Culture and 
Women’s Studies departments, 
said 
faculty 
diversity 
plays 

an important role in campus 
climate. She noted that one way 
to retain a diverse faculty is to 
offer faculty members of color 
incentives to stay on campus 
— adding that many of her 
co-workers of color have left the 
University because they were 
denied tenure and not given 
retention offers.

“I appreciated your comment 

earlier about retention, and how 
retention of students of color 
are very important,” she said. 
“Retention of faculty and staff 
of color is equally as important.”

Comparative Literature Prof. 

Silke-Maria Weineck, chair of 
the Senate Advisory Committee 
on 
University 
Affairs, 
said 

Muslim students, in particular, 
must be included on campus.

“Since that has not been 

stressed in discussion so far, 
I would also just like to mark 
that there is one group that also 
needs to be included,” Weineck 
said. “It would be good by 2025 
if we had religious inclusion as 
well.”

Rackham 
student 
Ashley 

Wilson 
said 
the 
University 

should 
be 
up 
front 
about 

diversity challenges from the 
very 
first 
interactions 
with 

new students. She said on 
her first day at the School of 
Education, Dean Deborah Ball 
was immediately open about the 
lack of diversity on campus.

Wilson said she appreciated 

Ball’s straightforward approach 
to 
talking 
about 
diversity, 

instead of waiting to discuss the 
issue later on.

“When 
we 
have 
these 

conversations 
immediately 

in our first interactions with 
students, I think it sets the tone 
for us to be able to do the rest of 
the things that we want them 
to learn and be receptive of,” 
Wilson said.

Jerrica Delaney, a program 

coordinator 
in 
the 
Office 

of 
Academic 
Multicultural 

Initiatives, said she felt she 
would like to see significant 
progress in terms of inclusion 
starting as soon as next year, 
rather than by 2025. She noted 
that professors should receive 
training 
to 
better 
prepare 

them 
to 
facilitate 
healthy 

dialogues concerning race in the 
classroom.

“One thing I would like to see 

next year is a classroom setting 
where professors from adjunct 
all the way up to tenure are 
culturally competent to handle 
the battleground — the arrows 
and the darts that are thrown 
at students of color in their 
classrooms,” she said.

She additionally challenged 

the University to seek out 
students who may not fit the 
stereotype of what it means to 
be an underrepresented, but 
exceptional student, as defined 
by the HAIL Scholarship and 
Wolverine Pathways programs.

“While we seek out this 

cream of the crop in Southfield 
and Ypsilanti, don’t forget the 
rest of the crop, because there 

are outstanding and exceptional 
students that may not be at 
that GPA that can still offer 
many beautiful things to this 
University that they really do 
need,” Delaney said.

In an interview with the 

Daily on Tuesday afternoon 
after the assembly, Schlissel 
said Southfield and Ypsilanti are 
only the pilot locations for the 
Wolverine Pathways location. 
The 
University, 
he 
added, 

intends to expand the program 
into Detroit as soon as possible, 
provided that its methodology 
finds success in Southfield and 
Ypsilanti first.

University 
alum 
Hector 

Galvan, a program coordinator 
in 
the 
Office 
of 
Academic 

Multicultural Initiatives, said 
his ideal climate would be for 
students of all identities to safe 
and comfortable on campus.

“I would very much like this 

place to feel like home,” Galvan said. 
“I didn’t feel like I fit in, and I didn’t 
feel like I was aptly represented 
here. What’s even worse — I feel 
like no one really cared.”

Schlissel said the summit 

marks a critical point in the 
University’s ongoing planning 
process to create a more diverse 
and inclusive campus.

“Up to this point, campus 

leaders, 
representatives 

from different units, chairs, 
deans, executive officers and 
individuals have been coming 
together to discuss how to 
refocus, but I think this is the 
first event during this process, 
and 
perhaps 
ever, 
where 

everybody in our community is 
given an equal opportunity to 
step up and tell us what you’re 
thinking,” Schlissel said to the 
assembly. “What kind of campus 
do you want us to have for our 
successors, and how do we get 
there?”

He further emphasized that 

the most effective plan will not 
come directly from the input of 
only the University’s executive 
officers, but from all members 
of the community.

“We need all of you to work 

with us,” he said. “We need to 
crowdsource the solutions to 
the challenges that we all share 
in an environment that we all 
love.”

FILM REVIEW

Nostalgic ‘Peanuts’

By BRIAN BURLAGE 

Daily Arts Writer

What do we know about 

Charlie Brown? Only a few 
things. He’s a kid who never 
grew 
out 
of 

his baby hair. 
He’s got a sister 
named 
Sally, 

a best friend 
named 
Linus 

and a pseudo-
rival-slash-
girlfriend 
named 
Lucy. 

The 
four 

friends 
live 

in a suburban 
neighborhood, presumably in 
the Midwest, alongside a colorful 
range of other kids, including 
the 
Beethoven-obsessed 

Schroeder, the perpetually dirty 
Pig-Pen and the best athlete in 
town, Peppermint Patty. Oh, and 
Charlie Brown has Snoopy, his 
loyal beagle.

These 
aspects 
of 
Charlie 

Brown 
and 
the 
“Peanuts” 

gang have remained true and 
untouched for the better part of 
50 years. Director Steve Martino 
(“Ice Age: Continental Drift”) 
is extremely careful not to get 
in the way of this, and he even 
goes so far as to incorporate 
quotes and scenes verbatim 
from the renowned cartoons. In 
this way, “The Peanuts Movie” 
is a fantastic continuation of 
the comic strip’s long-beloved 
values, 
a 
testament 
to 
its 

resounding popularity.

The question is, though: how 

does this movie contribute to 
the “Peanuts” saga? From what 
necessity does this story arise?

Well, we learn pretty quickly 

that Charlie Brown is a hopeless 
romantic. The Little Red-Haired 
Girl has just moved in across the 

street, and Charlie Brown sees it 
as an opportunity to finally start 
fresh with someone. He tries to 
win her heart in the school’s tal-
ent show; he writes a book report 
for her while she’s out of town, 
wooing her with flowers and 
trying to return her pink pencil 
along the way. But the course of 
true love never did run smooth, as 
Charlie Brown, aside from being 
a hopeless romantic, is also hope-
lessly accident-prone. Despite his 
best efforts, he just can’t beat his 
own tendency to screw up.

We learn, too, that Snoopy is 

a rather prolific novelist. After 
he finds an old typewriter in a 
dumpster outside the school, 
Snoopy begins writing an epic 
World War I-era love story. Most 
of the movie’s action scenes 
emerge from Snoopy’s jet-fueled 
rivalry with the Red Baron, a 
skilled pilot who has kidnapped 
Fifi, Snoopy’s love interest. A 
multi-part war story develops, in 
which Snoopy tries to win back 
the love of his life. The beauti-
ful part about this storyline is 
its wordless entanglement of 
puppy love. The two dogs can’t 
talk, of course, but in Charles M. 
Schulz’s “Peanuts” world, that 
doesn’t matter.

These are the basic story 

points of a very G-rated “Peanuts 
Movie.” Vince Guaraldi’s legend-
ary, and wholly American, score 
accompanies light-hearted ice-
skating scenes and breezy walks 
through the park. Guaraldi’s sub-
tle but upbeat music — “Skating” 
and “Linus and Lucy” mostly — 
is by now inseparable from the 
characters themselves. However, 
the film does throw in modern 
pop music like Flo Rida’s “That’s 
What I Like,” and it’s not a det-
riment so much as a distraction 
from the otherwise perfectly-
framed “Peanuts” world. 

Part of the reason why “The 

Peanuts Movie” works so well is 
that it feels suitably subdued in 
time. Telephones are still wired, 
Snoopy flashes in and out of the 
1910s, the kids still wear galoshes 
and grades are posted on bul-
letin boards in the hallway. The 
animation, 
though 
certainly 

modern, is simple and linear, a 
conflation of two-dimensional 
and three-dimensional shapes — 
an odd but endearing throwback 
to Schulz’s cartoons. Adults are 
never around, and if they are, 
they stay off camera and mutter 
gibberish to the children — the 
“wah-wah” voices still a per-
fect double-sided pun (are the 
kids simply not listening, or are 
the adults just sputtering totally 
insignificant things?). In either 
case, the absence of adults ren-
ders the “Peanuts” world warm, 
wacky and completely insecure. 
Without any of those elements, 
everything would unravel.

There’s a moment in the movie 

(borrowed from the Christmas 
special) that captures viewers’ 
interest from generation to gen-
eration. In the winter, Lucy sets 
up and operates her own five-
cent Psychiatric Advice stand, 
which is a lovely play on the lem-
onade stand. Charlie Brown is, 
of course, Lucy’s first and most 
frequent customer. He tells her 
all about his anxiety, his grow-
ing fear of responsibility and 
bad luck with girls. Lucy listens 
intently like a good friend. And 
as she gives him advice (good 
advice, too) something about the 
whole exchange strikes us: these 
kids genuinely depend on one 
another for help. “The Peanuts 
Movie” and indeed the “Pea-
nuts” empire teach us that only 
children really understand each 
other. And that’s where the nos-
talgia sets in.

Rave & Quality 16

“We 
have 
a 
tremendous 

number of really worthy singing 
actors who we would like to be 
able to accommodate with more 
performances,” Swedberg added. 
“So by doing two one-acts, we’re 
able to engage like 30, 31 singers, 
with double casting … so that’s 
giving a lot of our students a good 
opportunity to sink their teeth 
into some performance time 
onstage, and that’s how you learn 
to do it.”

“The other nice thing about 

this double bill is that one is 
in Italian and the other is in 
French, so it gives our sing-
ing actors an opportunity to 
increase their ability to sing in 
these foreign languages as well,” 
Swedberg continued, expand-
ing his focus on the educational 
aspects of the production.

The first of the two operas 

being 
produced 
is 
L’heure 

espagnole 
(“The 
Spanish 

Hour”) by French composer 
Maurice Ravel. Ravel, who is 
associated with Debussy and the 
Impressionist movement (though 
they both took issue with that 
term), is known for his popular 
composition Bolero, his colorful 
orchestrations 
and 
numerous 

masterworks. Composed in 1911, 
the comical opera is Ravel’s first 
foray into the genre.

“This is sort of a French 

bedroom farce … although it has 
a Spanish flavor,” Swedberg said. 
“The Spanish hour is a time in 
the day when the husband might 
be away and the wife might 
possibly entertain lovers … on 
this particular day, though, the 
husband (a clockmaker) is away 
and the wife has complications 
with the lover that she expects, 
who turns out to be more 
interesting in writing poetry 
than in her.”

This Gordian knot of romance 

is further tightened when a 
muleteer and third potential lover 
arrive on the scene, leaving the 
wife to juggle her delicate and 
amusing situation.

The second of the two operas 

being 
performed 
is 
Gianni 

Schicchi, written in 1919 by the 
seasoned Italian opera composer 
Giacomo Puccini, one of the most 
frequently performed composers 
of opera, known for masterworks 
like Madama Butterfly, Tosca and 
the unfinished Turandot.

“It’s one of the best written 

comic operas, in my opinion,” 

Swedberg said of Gianni Schicchi. 
“It’s mostly about how groups of 
people deal with greed, and it’s 
just a really funny piece.”

The opera tells the tale of a 

well-off family squabbling over 
the will of a deceased relative, 
and how to rewrite it. Matters 
are further complicated by the 
fact that a young man within 
the family has a fiancée from a 
working-class background, which 
troubles his snobbish relatives.

The production of the operas 

also reflects an update to the 
settings, a change made with 
the aim of making the themes 
more accessible to contemporary 
audiences. Similar adjustments 
have 
been 
occurring 
with 

increasing frequency over the 
past several years — for example, 
Charles Gounod’s Faust, based on 
Goethe’s famous retelling of the 
German legend, was performed a 
few years ago at the Metropolitan 
opera in a recontextualization 
that 
included 
the 
titular 

character as a physicist involved 
in the development of atomic 

weaponry.

“We thought it would be 

interesting to go for the Victorian, 
Industrial 
Revolution 
and 

Steampunk look,” the director 
said of updates to “The Spanish 
Hour,” drawing inspiration from 
the 
clockmaker’s 
workshop 

in the opera. Of the Puccini, 
Swedberg said, “Gianni Schicchi 
was set in 1299 … but we thought 
with an update to the ’20s, we 
would be able to use a different 
costume and scenic palette that 
might be more relevant.”

In 
discussing 
the 

complementary nature of the 
two operas, Swedberg spoke 
about 
the 
slight 
differences 

in comedic style between the 
operas. According to him, Ravel’s 
work is far more exaggerated 
and farcical, whereas Puccini’s is 
more a “slice of life” style.

“They 
stand 
up 
really 

nicely,” Swedberg said of the 
operas. “Having the two styles 
together in one evening is very 
interesting — two different 
types of comedy.”

added. “So by doing two one-acts, 
we’re able to engage like 30, 31

aspect to help people have not 
just an academic understanding 
of the barriers of poverty,” 
Warpehoski said.

The 
three-hour-long 

workshop replicated a month of 
poverty by dividing an hour into 
four weeks, each week covering 
15 
minutes. 
The 
concept, 

Warpehoski said, was developed 
by a group of welfare rights 
organizers in Missouri.

“There are all these victim 

blaming narratives out there,” 
Warpehoski said. “The lived 
experience was that it’s not that 
easy, and so they developed this 
simulation to give people just 
that tiny window into all the 
barriers that all the people in 
poverty face.”

The 
students 
were 
given 

scripts and asked to assume the 
roles of low-income people of 
a variety of backgrounds and 
family structures. Volunteers 

from the community played 
staff members of a fictional 
town, taking up the roles of 
store owners, welfare office 
workers, grocers, food pantry 
employees, police, employment 
interviewers and others.

Public Policy senior Blair 

Sucher said she felt very trapped 
in her character’s situation. 
Sucher said, in the simulation, 
her character’s income changed 
from a $60,000 per year to less 
than $1,000 per month.

“I didn’t know what I was 

doing from the get go,” she said. 
“I didn’t know where to go get 
resources. There were so many 
externalities that weren’t even 
covered, and I was already 
so overwhelmed by what was 
happening while sitting here. ”

Students were instructed not 

to break character. Murmurs of 
frustration could be heard in 
the room. One student cried out, 
“This is so hard.”

Assistant 
Sociology 
Prof. 

Alexandra 
Murphy 
noted 

a 
change 
in 
the 
overall 

atmosphere of the room as 
students felt the burdens of 
their mock situations intensify.

“It seemed like no one could 

trust 
each 
other 
and 
that 

everyone was looking out for 
themselves, and their families,” 
she said. “That stress made it 
difficult for students to navigate 
relationships with one another. 
They were trying to make the 
most of what they had without 
getting ripped off by their 
neighbors and the offices.”

At the end of the event, 

Warpehoski 
talked 
to 
the 

students about the need for 
affordable 
housing 
in 
Ann 

Arbor. 
He 
said 
the 
ICPJ 

supports an affordable housing 
development 
on 
Platt 
Road 

and he urged students to lobby 
elected officials in support of 
the housing program.

“The price of housing in Ann 

Arbor is very high,” he said. 
“There have been some voices 
that have come out that oppose 
affordable housing. Don’t let 
these be the only voices.”

Exploiting social justice

N

o more please, I’ve had 
enough social justice for 
this week. I can’t consume 

another bite.

Social 
justice 

warriors are easy 
to find at the Uni-
versity. 
They’re 

big-hearted oppo-
nents of systemic 
oppression, who 
chase out discrim-
ination wherever 
it crops up and 
strive to uphold 
the 
politically 

correct. They are 
idealistic (never a 
bad trait) and heartfelt, but they have 
become a gang of extremists.

The nickname itself isn’t my 

own creation. It’s definition isn’t 
concrete, but it’s a term being widely 
used to characterize the modern 
do-gooder and was just added to 
Oxford Dictionaries. Nothing is ever 
progressive enough in the eyes of a 
social justice warrior. Masses of these 
pro-everything protesters fight for 
social justice with the dedication and 
energy of soldiers on the front line.

The collective passion for social 

fairness has been growing rapidly and 
unconfined to the point of backlash — 
it’s too much of a good thing. There’s 
no function of the social justice 
movement that discriminates between 
serious issues and the absurd. 

There are real issues at the Univer-

sity, where the pursuit of social justice 
brings about solutions. In 2014, pro-
tests by the Black Student Union led to 
negotiations with University adminis-
trators to address campus diversity. I 
don’t need to congratulate the BSU for 
the progress it’s achieved, but it stands 
out as an act of effective activism.

Used in this way, calls for social 

justice can be a constructive element 
of 
campus 
discourse. 
However, 

tireless efforts to sustain political 
correctness, inclusion and a safe space 
for everyone, sometimes get applied to 

other topics of discussion.

In the past week, two articles 

about meat have been published in 
this paper. While I personally never 
gazed across a dining hall menu for 
intrigue, perhaps I was wrong not 
to do so. The first meat-gate column 
and the subsequent response each 
garnered vocal discussion on social 
media. Though it would lack tact to 
reference any particular student’s 
thoughts on meat-gate, it was a sub-
ject plenty of social justice warriors 
were ready to battle over.

The details of meat-gate aren’t 

worth delving into, but it remains a 
prime example of how social justice 
is overplayed.

Pro-meat, anti-meat — it doesn’t 

matter which stance to take because 
it’s 
an 
inane 
and 
meaningless 

conversation altogether. If these 
are the types of discussions we as a 
student body decide to have in public 
forum, then we should remember to 
take breaks to laugh at ourselves.

The core values of social justice 

— 
inclusion, 
diversity, 
freedom 

from discrimination, etc. — are 
important issues, and should be 
taken seriously. Yet, they have been 
applied in ridiculous circumstances 
that undermine the reputation of the 
entire social movement.

Almost by definition, social jus-

tice warriors are emphatically lib-
eral. After all, expanding social 
programs and the welfare state are 
classic liberal ideas. However, the 
needless policing of political cor-
rectness, on social media in partic-
ular, by social justice warriors, in 
social media in particular, has gone 
too far. A movement meant to unite 
is causing diversion, and social jus-
tice warriors are making the left 
wing of politics look bad.

In the same way that millions of 

Americans are moderate voters, most 
people are moral moderates as well. 
Most people aren’t homophobes or 
racists, but they aren’t archangels 
of social justice either. None of us 

can expect to always be perfectly 
refined in our social lives, and we 
all carry prejudices. Failing to 
acknowledge these truisms grinds 
any 
conversations 
about 
social 

rights and justice to a halt, because 
prescriptive social justice wants 
humans to act as something they can 
never be — creatures without bias.

Social justice warriors have proud-

ly claimed their place at the helm of 
human morality, taking offense with 
any action that hasn’t been bleached 
clean by political correctness. Life on 
campus is sometimes like an episode 
of South Park. But not everything 
needs to be examined through a crys-
tallized lens of social idealism.

Kanye gifted us with the wisdom-

bomb “the art ain’t always gonna 
be polite” during his vanguard 
acceptance speech at this year’s 
VMAs. And indeed, it’s interesting 
to imagine what the landscape of art 
might look like if someone tried to 
restrict Kanye’s choice of words.

Social 
justice 
is 
clearly 
a 

positive and important cause, but 
in a microcosm like Ann Arbor’s 
University 
community, 
it 
has, 

ironically, become somewhat difficult 
to practice self-expression without 
having to consider the infinite ways 
words might be misinterpreted to 
betray the intended meaning. A bland 
statement of opinion can ignite a fiery 
debate about dining hall menus.

We should forgive people who 

cause offense or ignorance in our 
communities today, not digitally 
tar and feather them with Facebook 
comments. It needs to be accepted 
that people aren’t perfect, and we 
should stop heralding social justice 
buzzwords to such extreme lengths. 
If the tendency to force-feed political 
correctness goes unchecked, we might 
start suffocating our collective ability 
to have any meaningful conversation 
at all.

Treat yo’ self

M

aybe it was Princess Barbie or 
Ballerina Barbie who prompted 
me to cast my eyes downward to 

my stomach only to realize 
that it was no longer as flat 
or toned as I remembered. 
Maybe 
I 
was 
10? 
 

Maybe sooner?

Ten-year-old 
Megan 

didn’t have to worry too 
much about having a stom-
ach like Lizzy McGuire; 
she was more preoccupied 
singing an off-key “What 
Dreams Are Made Of.” My 
first exposure to the word 
“diet” was when a class-
mate’s mother packed her a “Diet Sunny-D” 
for lunch.

But with the Kardashians ruling social media 

and the pressures on young girls to always look 
their best in today’s society, it’s hard not to envi-
sion a future made up of anorexic supermodels 
and super-super-super skinny jeans. However, 
there’s a glimmer of hope for confidence, and 
her name is Amy Schumer.

Weight has been a problem that, for most 

of my life, I’ve struggled with — even if I’ve 
learned how to expertly hide my insecurities. 
If a conversation involving weight comes up, I 
usually joke that my stomach currently looks 
like the topographic map of Colorado. The 
comment receives some laughs, distracting 
me from the fact that I’ve just unintentionally 
put myself down. I’ve never felt very comfort-
able in my body for long, constantly fluctuating 
between the “fat” and “skinny” standards, but 
never staying on one long enough to accept my 
weight and move on. With a wardrobe consist-
ing of jeans bigger and smaller than my current 
size and shirts capable of stretching easily, it’s 
hard not to look at the numbers.

Last year, the pressures of beginning my 

time as a University student in difficult courses 
created low confidence in my academic abili-
ties, which led to eating habits ranging from 
skipping meals to midnight pantry visits for 
a fourth meal. I was paranoid of gaining the 
dreaded “freshman 15” and letting the number 
on the tag multiply as my meals fluctuated.

I stayed in that funk for almost an entire 

year until a fellow resident commented that I 
reminded him or her of Amy Schumer because 
of my blasé comments about my own size. At the 
time, I thanked him or her for picking my favor-
ite comedian to represent me and moved back 
to working on my bowl of sliced pineapple. But 
recently, Schumer has drawn national attention 
for her open and honest comments about her 
relationship with weight (I’m not talking about 
that Kardashian comment).

My younger sister, Kellen, remains at a size 

0 despite the amount of food she practically 

inhales. (I used to have a theory that our stom-
achs were swapped when we were younger.) 
So naturally, shopping was always hard on my 
self-image when we inevitably headed to the 
dressing rooms. Outfits I found beautiful would 
often not fit, and almost anything Kellen tried 
on would result in a solid “yes” as my “no” pile 
steadily grew. I was often unable to find cloth-
ing that both flattered my body and did justice 
to my personality. Wanting to look as fashion-
ably savvy as the models on those magazines 
but without the body for those clothes, I felt 
like I should fix myself first rather than go up 
that size or two. Most times, I pulled my sweat-
er back around my shoulders and slid down 
the mirror of the dressing room, plastering on 
a fake smile to tell the assistant, “Nope, didn’t 
find anything.”

The first steps toward fixing this problem for 

future generations has begun with comedians 
like Amy Schumer and Rebel Wilson paving 
the way for style and clothing tailored to fit the 
person, not the image.

In a serious moment not typical of the criti-

cally acclaimed comedian, Schumer becomes 
emotional, recalling her struggles with self-
image in Hollywood and finding clothing that 
made her feel as confident on the outside as 
she was on the inside. That is, until the “Train-
wreck” star met Leesa Evans on the set, who 
dressed Schumer in more flattering clothes 
tailored to compliment her looks, not hide 
them. Soon, she felt like a professional, beau-
tiful young woman and regained the humor 
she’s most well known for, referring to her body 
recently as a “lava lamp.”

Yeah, maybe now I can see the similarities. 
Nowadays, I still find myself looking down 

at my thighs in those tiny lecture seats think-
ing “Shit, guys. What’s the deal?! You were sup-
posed to stay in those size fives!” And though 
these thoughts are ever-present, the humor 
wipes away insecurities as I find the ability to 
laugh at myself in a positive, healthy way.

Self-image is a problem in today’s progres-

sive society that won’t be fixed by one comedi-
an admitting to her struggles with weight, and 
I know that. Though we can’t very well expose 
children to the Schumer’s skits, we could do 
well to teach confidence and self-respect to 
young girls, using Schumer as the face behind 
the revolution, not those that promote weight 
loss and plasticity. The focus should shift 
toward being healthy and feeling good on the 
inside. You can run a mile a day and eat salad 
all you want, but sometimes, you’ve just gotta 
treat yo’ self.

And Amy’s right. Khloe should learn to 

compromise and eat a bagel every once and a 
while, too.

Ending the stigma around abortion

STUDENTS FOR CHOICE | VIEWPOINT

Despite 
the 
deep 
political 

entrenchment of the abortion debate 
in American politics, we never seem 
to talk about the fact that abortion 
is a common experience among 
American women. According to 
2008 research from the Guttmacher 
Institute, one in three women* will 
have an abortion in her lifetime. 
Yet, we don’t talk about abortion: 
We legislate it, regulate it, define 
what it is and isn’t and what it 
should and shouldn’t mean.

Rather than being looked at as an 

individual experience, abortion is 
too often examined and dissected 
through a framework of politics and 
cultural standards that trap women 
who have had abortions in a double 
bind. When a woman feels relieved 
after having an abortion, she is vili-
fied as an individual, then treated 
as the representative for all women 
who have had abortion, accused 
as being heartless or accused of 
repressing her “true feelings.” On 
the other hand, if a woman expe-
riences even the slightest regret 
of her abortion, anti-choice activ-
ists will use her narrative as a tool 
to advance restrictive policies that 
police women’s access to abortion 
care. In the midst of this political 
trivialization and cultural classi-
fication of a person’s lived experi-
ence, individuals’ abortion stories 
are effectively silenced.

Stigma exists on all levels: indi-

vidual, community, institutional, 
legal and in the media. This stigma 
is pervasive, as we can identify it 
at all of these levels. For example, 
myths of the danger of abortion 
circulate and women who have had 

abortions experience shame, guilt, 
marginalization and are labeled 
either victims or promiscuous. 
Likewise, abortion providers are 
stigmatized. Research conducted at 
this very university has linked con-
sciousness clauses — which permit 
doctors to opt out of performing 
abortions — to the stigmatization 
of abortion providers who are often 
stereotyped as incompetent physi-
cians. Providers may also fear for 
their physical safety as a result of 
the stigma: Since 1993, eight clinic 
workers have been murdered.

As you can see, this stigma 

affects people’s lives. These people 
are women in our University 
community. One in three isn’t just 
a statistic; it’s a representation of 
all the women in your life who have 
had abortions but have not been 
given the opportunity to talk about 
them. Every time an anti-abortion 
law is proposed and every time a 
group of anti-abortion activists 
stands in front of a clinic entrance 
with signs that shame individuals 
who have abortions, we’re shaming 
one-third of our nation’s women for 
a choice that they made about their 
lives. This shaming effectively tells 
women who have had abortions — 
and women who are going to have 
abortions — that their experience 
is invalid, and that the choice 
they made about their pregnancy 
 

is shameful.

It’s our duty as young people who 

care about the safety and wellbeing 
of our community to amplify the 
voices of individuals who have 
had abortions by creating a space 
for them to share their stories 

free of the shame and stigma that 
currently 
surrounds 
abortion. 

We’re reclaiming our voices and 
telling our stories so that women 
around the nation can tell theirs, 
too. Not only do we hope that 
the sharing of personal abortion 
stories finally puts an end to the 
stigmatization of abortion, but we 
hope that it mobilizes abortion 
supporters to advocate for safe, 
legal and affordable abortion care.

This Thursday, Nov. 12 at 8 p.m. 

in the Anderson Room of the Michi-
gan Union, Students for Choice will 
be holding its third annual Abortion 
Speak Out. The Abortion Speak Out 
is an opportunity for members of 
our campus community who have 
had an abortion(s) to share their 
experience in a safe, supportive and 
judgment-free space. Afterward, the 
Speak Out will be open for anyone to 
share their personal abortion story. 
While we encourage all University 
community members to join us in 
listening to the stories of friends and 
peers, only individuals who have 
had an abortion will have the oppor-
tunity to speak.

It’s 
time 
to 
come 
together 
 

to end the stigma and shame 
 

around abortion.

*We recognize that not all people 

who have abortions identify as 
women; transgender men and gender-
nonconforming individuals also opt 
to terminate pregnancies. However, 
available 
statistical 
data 
only 

measures the prevalence of abortion 
among cisgender women.

Revitalizing nationalism

A

s a collective, Americans have grown 
less patriotic. In the last 16 years, the 
amount of “very proud” American citi-

zens has dropped from 77 
percent to 56 percent.

Americans have openly 

admitted to the drop in 
national pride. According 
to a poll by The Atlantic 
and The Aspen Institute 
for the Aspen Ideas Festi-
val, “More than two-thirds 
(of the public) believe that 
American 
values 
have 

declined.” 
Reportedly, 

these values — freedom of 
speech and individual lib-
erties, equality under the law and free enter-
prise — are seen to be deteriorating, as many 
believe these values only apply to the wealth-
iest Americans. Specifically, the majority of 
Americans “believe that an obsession with 
money and material things, the influence of 
money in politics” have weakened core val-
ues, making them relevant to individuals of 
the highest socioeconomic status.

Our lost national pride is likely due to a 

general distaste for our political leaders and 
institutions. Approximately 64 percent of 
Americans don’t want their kids pursuing a 
political career, according to Gallup. Similarly, 
people’s trust in Congress ranks 16th (last) 
behind institutions like churches, the military, 
public schools, etc. Furthermore, most teens 
don’t want to grow up to be president. In gen-
eral, we’ve become disattisfied with American 
representatives, institutions and values.

The proliferation of media sites constantly 

covering power holders in Washington, D.C., 
has influenced this general decline in national-
ism. With the rise of digital media sites, people 
have more exposure to news events than ever 
before. This coverage often unveils corruption, 

deceit, and ignorance of and general disappoint-
ment in our political leaders. While there isn’t 
necessarily more corruption or malfeasance 
today than before, there are more organizations 
attempting to hold our leaders accountable. 

As a growing body of journalists uncovers 

unfortunate truths within our political 
leadership and institutions, Americans have 
turned to themselves for inspiration. About 
70 percent of Americans have stated that they 
can get anything they want in this country if 
they work hard enough. More depressing, 
though, 
is 
that 
Americans’ 
personal 

narcissism has climbed to higher rates.

According to a cross-temporal study of Ameri-

can college students, two-thirds of students’ nar-
cissism scores (measured by psychologists) have 
risen 30 percent over the mean since 1982. Addi-
tionally, a Pew Research Center poll found that 
59 percent of millennials admitted to being more 
self-absorbed than previous generations.

Considering the decline in nationalism and 

trust in political leadership, it should come 
as no surprise that Americans believe them-
selves to be more important than previous 
generations. Who else can they trust but their 
families, friends and selves?

Unfortunately, the decline in nationalism 

and rising individualist mentality is corre-
lated with lower civic participation. Since 
people are less dedicated to the goals of 
America, they’re less willing to volunteer or 
make sacrifices for their country. Over the 
past few decades, volunteerism has declined 
significantly. According to Robert Putnam, 
participation in the Boy Scouts has dropped 
26 percent since 1970, and activity in the Red 
Cross has fallen 61 percent in the same time 
period. While youth involvement rose sig-
nificantly just after 9/11, the general trend of 
decreased volunteerism has remained consis-
tent, as of 2014, according to the U.S. News & 
World Report.

SAM
COREY

Curiously, these stats raise an 

interesting question: Should the 
increased exposure of political cor-
ruption influence us to become less 
appreciative of (and therefore less 
service-oriented toward) America?

Personally, I don’t think so.
The fact that America is not the 

idealistic nation we want to reside 
in now doesn’t mean it can’t be more 
like that place tomorrow. In fact, our 
recognition of problems and failures 
in our political system provide us all 
with an opportunity to make it bet-
ter. These circumstances are par-
ticularly inspiring in a democratic 
society. The identification of our 
opportunities should galvanize us to 
be more grateful for America; more 
thankful, more selfless and more 
service-oriented for what we have 
and for understanding our possibil-
ity to become better nationally and 

individually.

One particular satirical news 

anchor has adopted this think-
ing. Jon Stewart, the former host of 
“The Daily Show” and an avid critic 
of American politics and the dirty 
incentives that drive our political 
leaders, has harped on the impor-
tance of civic duty. He believes 
national service, as long as it doesn’t 
stray from one’s critical understand-
ing of our leaders’ goals and one’s per-
sonal goals, is beneficial for everyone.

In other words, he believes we 

should be critically proud of America 
for what is has given us, and for what 
it can give us, because we are citi-
zens with the capacity to change it. 
That opportunity implicitly demands 
responsibility from everyone con-
tinuing to question our leaders and 
then improving America’s standing 
in our world. In this context, former 

president John F. Kennedy’s words 
ring true: “Ask not what your country 
can do for you — ask what you can do 
for your country.”

And while it’s necessary to rec-

ognize the possible xenophobia, 
discrimination and genocide that 
groupthink patriotism creates, a 
strong dose of critical nationalism 
provides our country and our com-
munities with a stronger civil society 
and a more participatory democ-
racy. In rather obvious terms, it’s 
beneficial for everyone to dedicate 
themselves to their fellow citizens. 
Without doing so, we’ll continue 
losing a sense of selflessness, a duty 
to something greater and a com-
mitment to giving back to what and 
whom we’ve benefited from.

TV NOTEBOOK

Jon Stewart to HBO, 
‘Star Trek’ to CBS

By ALEX INTNER

Daily Arts Writer

Last week, two deals were 

announced within 24 hours that 
each can shift the online stream-
ing landscape. The first involves 
a new “Star Trek” series that 
will air on CBS’s streaming ser-
vice, CBS All Access. The second 
announced that Jon Stewart will 
bring his breaking news com-
mentary to HBO Go and HBO 
Now. If these deals reach their 
maximum potential, they will 
allow each service to establish 
itself as an original content pro-
vider, though each will face stiff 
challenges in the process.

CBS is trying to send the mes-

sage that it’s ready to stand with 
the likes of Netflix, Amazon 
Prime and Hulu Plus with its 
“Star Trek” deal. The series will 
be executive produced by Alex 
Kurtzman, who co-wrote the last 
two movies of the franchise, and 
will premiere in January 2017 
on CBS All Access after airing 
a “special preview episode” on 
CBS. The “Star Trek” franchise 
is one of the largest in the CBS 
library, with six television series 
and a gigantic fanbase. So it’s a 
logical place for CBS to go to try 
to push viewers to its stream-
ing service. Also, this isn’t the 
first time that a Star Trek series 
kicked off a new platform. Back 
in 1995 when Paramount was 
looking for something to support 
the new network UPN, they cre-
ated “Star Trek: Voyager,” which 
aided the fledgling network by 
earning a high viewership during 
its first season.

The Trek deal is the largest 

splash for a streaming content 
provider since the initial two-
season, $100 million pickup of 
“House of Cards” by Netflix in 
2011. But Netflix had more to 
build on than CBS All Access. 
Les Moonves, the head of CBS, 
has refused to say how many are 
currently subscribing to the $5.99 
per month site, only suggesting 
that the number is greater than 
the 100,000 that currently sub-
scribe to Dish Network’s Sling 
service. At the time of the “Cards” 
announcement, Netflix had 20 
million subscribers. CBS is likely 
working from a smaller base than 
Netflix, so it will be more difficult 
to make the Trek show a success.

However, CBS will be using 

their linear audience, which is 
still the highest of any of the 
broadcast 
networks. 
It 
will 

include a season’s worth of NFL 
promotions to try to push view-
ers to their preview showing. The 
key will be making a high-quality 
episode of television with a cliff-
hanger that will help the shove. 

As for Jon Stewart’s HBO 

deal, the details are slim. But we 
do know Stewart signed a four-
year deal with HBO that covers 
new short-form digital content 
for HBO Now and Go, as well 
as a first-look deal for any film 
or television projects Stewart 
might produce during this time 
span. Stewart, who left “The 
Daily Show” earlier this year, 

has the opportunity to make 
new content multiple times per 
day, all of which will be upload-
ed as they’re ready.

In his former role, Stewart was 

one of the preeminent names in 
news, doing 22 minutes of com-
mentary and comedy four times 
a week. This appears to be a part 
of a larger push by HBO to enter 
the news commentary arena, 
which started with “Last Week 
Tonight” and will continue with 
an upcoming nightly newscast 
from VICE. The key difference 
between HBO’s prior news proj-
ects and Stewart’s videos are 
that Stewart’s will be exclusively 
online, on the subscriber-only 
streaming sites. Given the suc-
cess that Oliver has enjoyed in 
his time at HBO, it’s only natu-
ral that his mentor, Stewart, will 

have a similar level of triumph 
creatively. Still, the big question 
is whether Stewart is enough of 
a name to guide people to HBO’s 
online presence. HBO is probably 
shelling out a great deal of money 
to Stewart for this deal, and they 
need the viewership to make it 
worthwhile.

Ultimately, 
the 
subscriber 

numbers will decide whether or 
not these deals will be valuable 
to the networks. HBO has a sub-
scriber base that will make it eas-
ier for them than CBS, but CBS 
has the NFL as a launching pad, 
which is larger than anything 
HBO has. However, if both deals 
bring the ideal number of view-
ers, they will open up both CBS 
All Access and HBO Now and Go 
as original programmers in the 
online space.

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.

Social media 

celebrity stuns fans 

with departure

By HAILEY MIDDLEBROOK

Daily Arts Writer

First, a picture: Tall and blond, 

tan skin framed in a backless white 
dress, hands scrunching perfect 
beach hair. She’s laughing — her 
profile crinkling — while her toes, 
curled on the edge of a dock, point 
out to the shimmery water.

We, the Instagram stalkers, 

soak it in, and try to replicate 
it. We change out of sweats and 
into season-appropriate casu-
al wear (i.e. what we weren’t 
casually wearing before), find 
an inspiring (yet still natural) 
backdrop for our spontaneous 
adventure. We copy the angle of 
the camera, capturing our own 
curved silhouettes and side-
grins; we hook a finger strategi-
cally behind our ear, taming an 
imaginary lock of hair. We wait 
until dusk for the perfect light 
and the “prime time” to post on 
Instagram (roughly 7 to 9 p.m., 
according to my 18-year-old sis-
ter). We laugh 100 times. We get 
super annoyed that we still don’t 
look candid enough.

And we wish our lives were as 

cool as Essena O’Neill’s. 

Over the past four years, 

O’Neill, a 19-year-old from the 
Sunshine Coast of Australia, has 
become a social media celebrity 
— followed by half a million on 
Instagram, nearly 250,000 on her 
YouTube channel. On her IMG 
modeling profile, O’Neill claims 
to be “committed to inspiring 
young women to love their bodies 
and to make good lifestyle choic-
es.” Her Instagram feed proves it: 
she laughs on the beach, makes 
açai breakfast bowls, unwinds 

with yoga. On YouTube, she 
reveals beauty tips and vegan 
recipes, giving followers insight 
to her perfectly zen, perfectly 
candid life in the sun.

So when O’Neill changed her 

Instagram name to “Social Media 
Is Not Real Life” last week, the 
Internet blew up. Without warn-
ing, she re-captioned her photos 
— the ones hundreds of thou-
sands of us had pinned as “goals” 
— to tell the real story behind 
them. For the photo of her in the 
backless white dress, she wrote: 
“NOT REAL LIFE — I didn’t 
pay for the dress, took countless 
photos trying to look hot for Ins-
tagram, the formal made me feel 
incredibly alone.” She revealed 
the 
advertising 
deals 
made 

covertly, writing on another, 
“Was paid $400 to post a dress.” 
She said that with her number of 
followers, online brands now pay 
up to $2,000 per Instagram.

Promotional 
photos 
aside, 

the real shock was the inten-
tion behind O’Neill’s personal 
pictures. Because when there 
wasn’t a brand — just a natural, 
laughing picture of O’Neill — we 
felt connected, like we were in 
on her secret. But what social 
media users don’t see (or choose 
to ignore) is what’s really being 
sold: not a brand, but the Insta-
grammer (or blogger, YouTuber, 
etc.) herself.

O’Neill 
uncovered 
pictures 

of herself on the beach, writing, 
“Nothing is candid.” On anoth-
er: “A 15-year-old that calorie 
restricts and excessively exercis-
es is not goals” — a message that’s 
dangerously ignored by masses of 
“fitspiration” boards and blogs.

Consumed by numbers — 

views, likes, followers — O’Neill 
deleted her Instagram and You-
Tube, calling it quits on her 
“perfect life” as we knew it. She 
opened a Vimeo account, where 

she recently posted a 12-min-
ute video on “Why I think social 
media sucks,” in which she 
demands of future social media: 
“Would someone please make 
something that isn’t based on 
views, likes and followers?”

She continues on the video, 

“If I had no likes or follows, I 
thought I meant nothing.” But (as 
we all know) feeling validation 
from likes or views isn’t anything 
new; O’Neill firmly states that she 
doesn’t blame social media itself 
for her unhappiness, but rather 
her own addiction to it. Her aim 
for Vimeo is to post three videos 
a week, sharing her thoughts on 
social media, body image and 
what it means to live a (real) 
healthy lifestyle, free from com-
ments or approval from YouTube.

Since 
the 
fallout, 
O’Neill 

has posted three more videos 
to her site. Despite her youth, 
despite how trivial the topic of 
social media seems, they watch 
strangely like a documentary: 
a behind-the-scenes look at a 
fallen celebrity. O’Neill is giddy 
and aspirational, inviting us all 
to be “game changers” by talk-
ing about ideas instead of Ins-
tagrams, reading books instead 
of counting likes. She promotes 
a movement for authenticity: 
“Go outside, go to a park, go to a 
beach, go somewhere there are 
people around you.”

She ends solemnly, “You don’t 

have to appreciate what I’m 
doing, but I hope it feels some-
what real ... What I’m doing here 
is a statement that real life isn’t 
through screens.”

It’s a sweet sentiment, but 

there’s something not quite right 
about it. Though her makeup is 
gone, her hair stuffed in a bun, 
O’Neill is still blinking up from 
a screen. An unsettling question 
remains: Didn’t her Instagram 
feel somewhat real to us as well? 

NEW MEDIA NOTEBOOK
Essena O’Neill 
drops Instagram

James Bond and the 
endless franchise

By MADELEINE GAUDIN

Daily Arts Writer

I remember dressing up with a 

cape and a wand to see the mid-
night premiere of “Harry Potter 
and the Order of the Phoenix.” 
I bought my ticket weeks in 
advance, waited in line with 100 
other wizards for spooky-themed 
snacks. Most importantly, I got to 
the theater early to pick the best 
seat (right behind the railing so I 
could put my feet up).

 I was excited to see the movie 

because I’d read all the books. The 
evening oozed anticipation more 
than surprise. I, along with every-
one else in the theater, already 
knew what would happen, and 
that’s exactly why we were there. 
That’s the case for fans of any book 
series-turned-film franchise. I’m 
sure (though I don’t have any first-
hand experience) that the “Twi-
light” movies brought out just as 
passionate a crowd. 

 However, James Bond is dif-

ferent. No one dresses up in 
white tuxes and sips martinis in 
the movie theater to celebrate 
the next 007 addition. Although 
that would be pretty suave, 
James Bond is a different kind 
of series, if you can even call it 
that. “Harry Potter” and “The 
Hunger Games” have a begin-
ning and an end. Everybody (and 
I mean everybody) cries at the 
end of “Harry Potter and the 
Deathly Hallows” because they 
know it’s over. I’m assuming no 
one cried at the end of “Spectre,” 
the latest episode in the adven-
tures of James Bond, even if they 
thought it was the finale of 007. 
An air of possibility hangs over 
the ending of a Bond movie — 
the possibility of another film or 
another Bond somewhere in the 
not-so-distant future.

 This begs the question: Will 

James Bond ever be over? I 
don’t think so, or at least not in 

my lifetime. As long as a Dan-
iel Craig look-alike (though it’s 
about time for some diversity) 
can throw on a tux and shoot a 
gun, there will be more movies. 
And that’s interesting, seeing 
as James Bond was originally 
a book series. It would, there-
fore, make sense to have a set 
beginning and end. But the sto-
ryline has spiraled off from the 
novels completely, drawing on 
elements from all the books in 
each film rather than following 
their plots exactly.

 Bond is a bit like Sherlock 

Holmes in the way the stories, 
both stemming from books, 
are malleable — actors, time 
periods 
and 
plotlines 
can 

be adjusted to fit popular 
demand. In the past 10 years, 
both Robert Downey Jr. and 
Benedict 
Cumberbatch 
have 

played Sherlock, the former in 
a ho-hum film adaptation and 
the latter in a brilliant BBC TV 
series. Bond has been played by 
seven men, ranging from the 
mediocre Pierce Brosnan to the 

classic Sean Connery. Anyone 
can play Bond or Sherlock, in a 
way that doesn’t exist in other 
series. Only Daniel Radcliffe 
can play Harry Potter (and 
that’s a fact). But, like Sherlock, 
Bond can embody different 
representations; many different 
actors (who all look eerily 
similar) can take on the role.

 Maybe Bond films are just 

too profitable to give up on. 
The 2012 installment “Skyfall” 
made 
over 
$1,000,000,000. 

That’s not too surprising, con-
sidering these films are full of 
everything the public loves: 
sex, guns and unnecessary 
explosions. Bond lives adjacent 
to Marvel Comics’ superheroes 
(another series of sorts that will 
never die) and down the street 
from more sophisticated spy 
thrillers, making the franchise 
a unique blend of artistry and 
mass market appeal. 

 Maybe one day our hero will 

meet his fateful end, but perhaps 
the allure of sex, guns and fast 
cars is just too good to pass up.

Ristovski readies 
to play her sisters

Detroit matchup 

personal for 

Wolverine senior 

guard 

By TED JANES 

Daily Sports Writer

The 
trash 
talking 
has 

already begun in the Ristovski 
household.

Three sisters — Madison, 

Haleigh and Lola Ristovski — 
have been playing basketball 
together for as long as they can 
remember. Madison, a senior 
guard at Michigan, will go 
head-to-head with her younger 
siblings this weekend when 
the Wolverines face off against 
Detroit on Sunday.

Haleigh, 
a 
junior 
guard/

forward, and Lola, a freshman 
guard, are now together for the 
first time since they played high 
school at University Liggett in 
Sterling Heights. Now that Lola 
has moved into the collegiate 
ranks, the younger pair has 
the chance to team up and go 
against their older sister when 
the two teams meet on Sunday.

“I’m really excited to play 

against 
them,” 
Madison 

Ristovski said. “We’ve been 
playing together since we were 
little. I’m really looking forward 
to the game, and I know a lot of 
people from my hometown are 
going to be there, which is going 
to be really special.”

The middle child, Haleigh, 

is likely to start for the Titans, 
and while Lola might not be in 
the starting five, she managed 
to play 15 minutes and nail a 
3-pointer in the team’s season 
opener against Lawrence Tech, 

so it’s likely that at some point, 
all three of them will take the 
court.

Back in high school, for 

Madison’s senior year, all three 
started for University Liggett, 
and the Ristovski trio came 
together for a monster campaign 
in Madison’s last go.

Even though they all play 

different styles now in college — 
Lola being more of a transition 
player and Haleigh developing 
more 
inside 
with 
a 
post 

presence — when they linked up 
in high school, with Madison at 
the point, and Haleigh and Lola 
playing the ‘2’ and ‘3’, the guard-
heavy lineup was lights-out all 
season.

“That year, we lost two games, 

and we played the toughest non-
conference schedule,” Madison 
Ristovski said. “We made it to 
the state championship.”

University Liggett lost, 61-57, 

in the closely contested 2012 
Class C championship game, 
a shootout in which Madison 
went for 42 points. The team 
fell to Morley Stanwood, but 
Madison, the newly crowned 
Michigan Miss Basketball, had 
the performance of a lifetime, 
supported by the aid of her 
younger siblings.

“We lost, but I think me, 

Haleigh and Lola had 53 of the 
57 points,” Ristovski said.

Four years later, Lola is again 

a freshman and Ristovski again a 
senior, but in completely different 
realms. Michigan and Detroit 
have met each of the last two 
years, and the Wolverines hold a 
2-0 advantage over the Titans.

Sunday afternoon, Madison 

will try to bump that number 
up to three, proving that she’s 
still the alpha in the loaded 
basketball family.

‘M’ defensive line 
aims to play mean 

Hurst, Wormley 

focused on 

toughness as home 
stretch approaches

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

To open a chat with reporters 

Tuesday 
night, 
redshirt 

sophomore 
defensive 
tackle 

Maurice Hurst credited his 
breakout season to his coaches, 
defensive 
line 
coach 
Greg 

Mattison and student assistant 
Will Carr.

Then, Hurst expounded on 

his praise of Carr, referencing 
his All-American career as a 
nose tackle at Michigan in the 
1990s:

“He was a bad dude.”
Carr, an All-American in 1996 

with 180 tackles, 38 tackles for 
loss and 11 sacks in his career, 
isn’t the only one in the locker 
room who could be described 
that way.

“We try to see ourselves 

as that,” Hurst said of the 
Wolverines’ 
defensive 
line. 

“There’s certainly times when 
we’re 
like 

that.”

Michigan’s 

defensive 
line has been 
tenacious 
this 
season, 

accounting for 
19.5 sacks and 
40.5 
tackles 

for loss. The 
front is a big 
reason 
that 

the Wolverines 
rank first in the nation in scoring 
defense.

Just as jarring, though, have 

been the individual highlights. 
On Oct. 31, Hurst crushed 
Minnesota 
running 
back 

Shannon Brooks for a loss of 
three on 3rd-and-goal from the 

two-yard line, forcing a field-
goal try. In the previous game 
against Michigan State, redshirt 
junior Chris Wormley stormed 
the 
backfield 
and 
sacked 

Spartans quarterback Connor 
Cook on third down, forcing a 
punt.

“Especially 
when 
you’re 

winning games and you have 
that confidence, that just makes 
you play a little harder, a little 
faster, a little tougher, a little 
more mean,” Wormley said. 
“You have that arrogance to 
come in and say, ‘You’re not 
going to push us around, and 
we’re going to win this game no 
matter what it takes.’ ”

Wormley leads the team with 

10 tackles for loss, and he and 
Hurst have both at least doubled 
their output in that category 
from last year. Hurst, who made 
just one such stop in 2014, has 
already made 5.5 this season.

“Although he plays nose, he’s 

the fastest guy off the ball,” 
Wormley said of Hurst. “He’s 
very quick. He’s very sneaky, 
and he makes plays, which is 
what we need on the defensive 
line.”

Though 
quiet 
and 

unassuming off the field, Hurst 

has 
ramped 

up 
the 

intensity 
at 

various points 
this 
year, 

providing 
highlight 
plays for the 
Michigan 
defense 
that 

carry 
over 

until the next 
time the unit 
takes 
the 

field.

“I definitely think you have to 

turn it up on the field,” Wormley 
said. “You can be the quietest, 
calmest guy walking down the 
street, but when it’s Saturday 
and you turn it up, you have to 
have that mentality, (different) 

than you would if you were 
watching TV with your mom or 
dad.”

Hurst and Wormley could 

be critical Saturday if redshirt 
junior 
Ryan 
Glasgow, 
who 

injured his shoulder in the 
first quarter last week against 
Rutgers, can’t play. In that case, 
presumably, Hurst would make 
his first career start.

But the shuffling along the 

line won’t be anything new 
for Michigan, which also lost 
sophomore nose tackle Bryan 
Mone to a season-ending injury 
in August. Rotation has been 
one of the hallmarks of the 
defensive line, and it will be a 
key Saturday against Indiana’s 
up-tempo offense. Hurst noted 
that while constant changes 
on the offensive line can bring 
chemistry issues, the practice is 
common on defense.

It helps that the Wolverines 

are also feeling better physically 
than they were at this time last 
year. 
Strength 
coach 
Kevin 

Tolbert, whom head coach Jim 
Harbaugh brought from the 
NFL’s 
San 
Francisco 
49ers, 

has focused more on recovery 
in weekday workouts, making 
sure the players are freshest on 
Saturday.

That 
ensures 
that 
Hurst, 

Wormley and Co. can wreak 
havoc in the opposing backfield 
as they have all season.

“For sure, I think we’re 

playing a lot more physical,” 
Hurst said. “Even if you turn on 
the Michigan State game from 
last year and you turn it on from 
this year, I think we’re playing 
a lot more physical up front. I 
think that was a big game where 
you could see that.

“I definitely think that’s 

something we really improved 
on. 
(We) 
kind 
of 
stopped 

ourselves from getting knocked 
around, and really trying to be 
the hammer, not get pushed 
back 
and 
push 
everyone 

forward.”

more physical.”

Walk-on Hibbitts picked 
Michigan over scholarship

By KELLY HALL

Daily Sports Writer

For 
most 
high 
school 

basketball players with Division I 
aspirations, college decisions are 
made long before May of senior 
year. Brent Hibbitts, however, had 
to wait until he was admitted to 
Michigan before making his. 

Hibbitts had already received a 

handful of scholarship offers from 
mid-major schools such as Central 
Michigan, 
Western 
Michigan 

and Appalachian State when 
Michigan coach John Beilein and 
the Wolverines entered the mix 
during his senior season.

But playing for Michigan came 

with a catch: Hibbitts would have 
to be a walk-on and pay his way 
through college.

Days after hearing of his 

acceptance, the 6-foot-8 forward 
decided to become a preferred 
walk-on for the Wolverines, and 
just a few weeks after that, he 
arrived in Ann Arbor for summer 
training. 

“I had several offers that I was 

considering,” Hibbitts said. “But 
then Michigan came up, and that 
was obviously a different option 
because I’d be a walk-on and have 
to pay, but it also had its benefits: 
the academics, the level of play, 
just being a part of Michigan. 

“I’m a Michigan guy, so I 

guess that’s kind of always been a 
dream.”

The role of a walk-on is 

less glamorous than that of a 
scholarship 
athlete, 
but 
the 

benefits that come with playing 
against Big Ten talent and earning 
a Michigan degree were too hard 
to ignore.

“I’m undecided on my major 

right now,” Hibbitts said. “But 
obviously, it’s Michigan, it has 
very high academics. When I do 
decide, I know I’ll be getting a 
great education no matter what I 
major in.”

Hibbitts averaged 17.5 points, 

11.3 rebounds and 2.4 blocks per 
game as a senior at Hudsonville 
High 
School, 
garnering 
an 

Associated Press Class A All-State 
honorable mention and an offer 
from Central Michigan, where his 

older brother, Blake, is a two-sport 
athlete, was particularly enticing. 

Though his brother initially 

wanted him to be a Chippewa so 
they could play together again, the 
elder Hibbitts backed off as time 
went by and more offers rolled in. 

“As (recruitment) went on, he 

was just like, ‘Do what’s best for 
you,’ ” Hibbitts said. “I waited 
it out and decided that this was 
best for me, and he was really 
supportive as well, just like 
everyone else in my family.”

During 
Michigan’s 
2014-15 

season, the importance of the 
walk-on role was apparent. After 
then-junior guard Caris LeVert 
and 
then-sophomore 
guard 

Derrick Walton were sidelined 
with 
season-ending 
injuries, 

then-sophomore walk-ons Sean 
Lonergan and Andrew Dakich 
appeared in 17 and 13 games, 
respectively, playing over 120 
combined minutes. They were 
more than just garbage-time 
players. 

Though the Wolverines are 

healthy and experienced for 
the time being, Hibbitts knows 
from history that if he puts in 
the work, he’ll get meaningful 
minutes down the road. As 
one of just two freshmen on a 

seasoned squad, it’s expected 
that Hibbitts will redshirt this 
season. 

The other freshman — German 

forward Moritz Wagner — is 
Hibbitts’ roommate.

“He’s a really goofy dude,” 

Hibbitts said of Wagner. “It’s 
been good. (The team) really 
accepted us with everything, on 
the court, off the court. Moe is my 
roommate, so we got to know each 
other really well, and then we got 
to know the team together. It’s 
been a good relationship.”

For now, Hibbitts and Wagner 

are just learning the ropes in 
practice, side by side with future 
NBA talent, while simultaneously 
adjusting to college life. 

“I was a little bit overwhelmed 

when I first started playing with 
(LeVert),” Hibbits said. “I was 
just like ‘Wow, he’s a really good 
player.’ A lot of other guys are like 
that too. Now I’m kind of used to 
it, but I’m still impressed by how 
good of a player he is. He works 
really, really hard too, so it’s no 
surprise that he’s that good.”

After giving up full rides 

to other schools just for the 
opportunity to contribute to the 
Wolverines, Hibbitts plans on 
working hard, too.

Brent Hibbitts is expected to redshirt in 2015-16.

Hard-headed Houma a man of many talents

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

Sione Houma is sometimes a 

man of few words, but he’s not a 
man of few talents.

For most of his career, the 

senior fullback from Salt Lake 
City has flown relatively under 
the radar as a fullback on the 
Michigan football team. Prior 
to the 2015 season, Houma had 
caught two passes, returned 
two kickoffs and recorded a 
smattering of tackles.

Most of his work went unseen, 

be it blocking as a fullback or 
contributing on special teams.

But when Jim Harbaugh was 

signed to coach the Wolverines 
this past winter, that all changed 
for Houma, who already has 22 
carries for 114 yards and three 

touchdowns in 2015, as well as 
five catches for 53 yards.

Suddenly, the player who was 

hadn’t recorded a carry before 
this season is now eighth on the 
team 
in 
all-

purpose yards 
with 167. Last 
week, Houma 
took snaps as a 
running back, 
a development 
that originated 
from 
his 

successes 
running 
fullback dives 
earlier in the 
season. And while he never would 
have expected it, he’s embracing 
his expanding role.

“I got caught (off guard) when 

they (asked) me if I wanted to try 

out at running back,” Houma said.

“Everything 
happens 
for 

a reason, and I’m put in this 
position right now for a reason: to 
help the team out. … That’s what 

I’m here for.”

Houma 
is 

still 
playing 

fullback, 
too, 

but his skills 
are 
more 

visible 
now 

than they ever 
were 
in 
the 

past. 
Against 

Rutgers, 
Houma found 
himself 
wide 

open on a wheel route after a fake 
to Jabrill Peppers drew defenders 
off him.

The play went for a 32-yard 

gain, and were it not for a throw 

that was slightly behind him, 
Houma might have scored.

“Right after that, my little 

brother came and talked to me,” 
Houma said. “He said, ‘You’ve 
gotta high-knee it! High-knee 
it!’ Just critiquing me. He said 
if I high-kneed it, I would have 
scored, because I got shoelace 
tackled.

“I just gotta work on my speed. 

There’s a lot of things I’ve gotta 
work on, and speed is one of 
them.”

Among the things he has 

down, his power run game comes 
to mind as a definitive strength. 
His 5.2 yards per carry are the 
second most of any Wolverine 
with at least 10 carries, trailing 
only junior running back Ty 
Isaac.

And while he often has to 

absorb 
cringe-worthy 
hits, 

Houma is predisposed to the 
power style.

“I’m 
just 
hard-headed,” 

Houma said. “Hard-headed, like, 
football wise. Coming down, if it’s 
me and the linebacker, I’m pretty 
much using all head. I know that’s 
wrong, but it doesn’t really phase 
me as much.

“I think the first couple years I 

was here, a lot of people would be 
having concussions, and — knock 
on wood — I haven’t had one yet. 
So, I’ve just been using that to my 
advantage.”

When 
he 
isn’t 
taking 
a 

pounding on the field, Houma 
likes the same things most 
college kids do. He likes playing 
Super Smash Bros on Nintendo 
64 with junior running back 
Drake Johnson, and he and 

sophomore 
defensive 
tackle 

Bryan 
Mone 
enjoy 
making 

music together. Houma plays the 
ukulele, and Mone provides the 
vocals. Houma’s favorite song 
to play is “Somewhere over the 
Rainbow.”

But don’t let Houma’s musical 

taste fool you into thinking he 
has gotten away from his roots 
doing the dirty work. Even after 
getting a taste of carrying the ball 
and scoring touchdowns, he still 
enjoys blocking for his teammates 
first and foremost.

“That’s my number one deal, 

right there,” Houma said. “It’s 
always protecting the running 
back and quarterback.”

So yes, blocking is still his 

number-one job, but as his role in 
the offense continues to expand, 
it’s far from his only one.

“It’s always 

protecting the 

running back and 

quarterback.”

Wednesday, November 11, 2015 // The Statement

D

ear Emma,

I’m 
wondering 

about where your 

confidence 
comes 
from, 

if not from relationships. 
Do you feel like you have 
achieved self-confidence in 
a way I haven’t? Explain to 
me how you’ve gotten there. 
Professional and academic 
accomplishments just don’t 
feel as emotional to me, so 
my mind just doesn’t focus 
on them in the same way, the 
same kind of high. Do people 
ever feel as fulfilled in their 
jobs as they do when they are 
in love? I have serious pro-
fessional goals for myself but 
I don’t feel the same visceral 
feeling I get from romantic 
relationships.

Sincerely,
Seeking Confidence

***

Dear Seeking Confidence,
I really appreciate that this 

question assumes I am confi-
dent. There’s an easy answer 
here and it’s mostly rooted in 
defensiveness: find passions 
that lead to personal success, 
and those personal successes 
will give you a sense of confi-
dence that can only be attrib-
uted to you. That’s it. And 
maybe that’s the way it should 
be and the way it will be with 
time — as we learn not to rely 
on one person to build our self-
esteem.

But in saying that, I can 

also add that I listen to Kurt 
Vile when I walk between my 
classes during the day, and it’s 
not necessarily because I dig a 
good indie singer-songwriter. 
I do things like that, within the 
constraints of my real life (re: 

classes, journalistic pursuits), 
because a tiny part of my mind 
is on my boyfriend, and I guess 
subsequently his funky music 
taste. And in that sense, a part 
of my identity is wrapped up 
in him, but as much as having 
a significant other can seem 
like everything, my boyfriend 
is not my source of confidence 
— and it’s not for lack of trying. 
I still feel extremely insecure 
about the way I look, I keep 
failed exams in the back of 
my mind, and when anyone at 
the Daily brings up internship 
prospects, my feelings of inse-
curity skyrocket. Confidence 
comes in waves, no matter 
where you get it from.

I understand what you’re 

saying about being extremely 
dedicated to your professional 
life but feeling something spe-
cial and unreplicable about 
the romantic part of your 
life. Maybe dealing with this 
means reconciling the self that 
is an amazingly ambitious, 
driven woman with the per-
son who likes to feel good, who 
has fun romantically, and gets 
high on that whole experience.

Realize that the value you 

receive from any other per-
son is ephemeral — but that 
also doesn’t make romantic 
relationships a pointless black 
hole you need to eliminate 
from your mind. And more 
than that, the truth is the con-
fidence and personal value 
you, or others who feel fulfilled 
by their jobs or majors or pas-
sions, derive from the profes-
sional and academic world can 
be just as fleeting.

Confidence seems to me 

to be a decision you have to 
make every day — choosing to 
be persistently dedicated to 
the things and people you care 

about will make you feel posi-
tive, and you should. There 
are so many things you abso-
lutely do not have control over 
in your life, but if you can rely 
on having a sense of self that is 
unwavering, all of those things 
suddenly feel a lot more sim-
ple. It’s fake at first, maybe, but 
the success confidence brings 
eventually turns into real con-
fidence.

I also think people just go 

through phases where cer-
tain things are on their minds 
more. I don’t think it’s too 
much of an unfair generaliza-
tion to say students of our age 
are feeling romantic emotions 
pretty strongly, and honestly 
I don’t think that’s a problem.

Sincerely,
Emma

On virtual death

O

ne of Facebook’s most 
peculiar capabilities is the 
“legacy contact feature.” 

Only recently implemented, the 
functionality allows users — usu-
ally loved ones — to inherit control 
of the Facebook accounts of the 
deceased.

A 
quick 
“Remembering” 
is 

affixed before the profile name, 
maybe a profile picture or cover 
photo is updated, and the account 
survives.

What was once a picture on the 

mantle has become a full-fledged 
social media profile.

Objectively, 
this 
is 
almost 

impossibly odd. While our tangible 
bodies are laid to rest, our Face-
book profile keeps on humming, 
still attracting likes and receiving 
“Happy Birthday!” posts. A hasty 
Facebook stalk unearths an eerie 
archive of past comments and 
unsettling time stamps on status 
updates. Our Internet selves — who 
are, arguably, often our most elabo-
rate fabrications — survive our 
real selves; a corporal end does not 
necessitate a virtual one.

On an entirely separate note, the 

most frightening thing happened 
on the day before Halloween: my 
favorite website was shut down. It 
would be impossible to understate 
Grantland’s importance to me nor 
my slavish devotion to its publica-
tion; I was slightly embarrassed 

by how sad I was from the end of a 
website.

In an era of lists posing as arti-

cles and blog posts with more gifs 
than words, Bill Simmons’ site was 
refreshingly 
(somewhat) 
tradi-

tional.

Sure, there was a series of pod-

casts called “Food News,” and the 
site ran a full-length piece scru-
tinizing a single picture of Nicki 
Minaj’s appearance at a random 
kid’s Bar Mitzvah (it ranks as one 
of my all-time favorites), but Grant-
land also allowed its almost univer-
sally talented writers the freedom 
to write what they wanted, to dive 
deep into their own oceans of inter-
est and produce thought-provoking, 
complex long-form criticism.

That kind of latitude is rare in 

an industry preoccupied with beats 
and word counts and short atten-
tion spans.

I read their stuff every day. I 

dreamed of working there. The 
writers seemed so at ease and 
so comfortable that Grantland 
seemed like that pipe dream you 
have when you’re younger that you 
and your best friends will all work 
at the same place.

And some form of the eulogy 

above has all been published online 
in the past couple of weeks numer-
ous times, by people more impor-
tant and more talented than I, 
but the simple fact is this: clicking 

Grantland on my favorites section 
now produces a solitary, somber, 
“It was a good run.” To access the 
archives, it tells me, I must use the 
navigation above.

I don’t aim to equate the death 

of a human being with the shut-
down of a website owned by ESPN. 
What’s interesting is how we, as a 
culture, have decided to memorial-
ize both equally, with a URL and a 
permanent home in cyberspace.

What is the point of death, of 

endings, if our dependence on 
the Internet has produced such a 
disfigured and superficial sense 
of immortality? Why do we love 
so passionately and grieve with 
such force if only to be constantly 
reminded of our loss by, well, its 
presence?

This is all representative of our 

gradual, collective devaluation of 
endings. Franchises are rebooted, 
spin-offs are planned, updates are 
released — everything finds a new 
home. And when things do finally 
end, they are memorialized in the 
same space they were once thriving. 

The Internet and everything 

it has touched has simply become 
too big for just the living; it now 
houses the hollow remembrances of 
things past. A grave requires work: 
digging, laying, crying, visiting, 
remembering. A dead man’s Face-
book account is just another tab in 
a window of many.

O

n the morning of Oct. 21, 2015, Eva Roos, an art and 
design senior, slept through five alarms before finally 
arising. She yawned and stretched her arms, pulled her 

blankets off, hopped into the shower and got dressed.

In her kitchen, she prepared breakfast, like she does any 

morning. She poured a half-cup of oats into a bowl, added one 
level cup of water, nuked it for thirty seconds, and garnished 
with flax seed and a heaping spoon of cinnamon. Before leaving 
the house, she grabbed a bottle of kombucha, a fermented tea 
beverage which she brews and bottles herself in her basement.

That same morning, I woke up after 

three alarms and the sound of a car pass-
ing by my window. I rolled out of bed, 
and on my way to the shower, paused to 
pick up a bowl from my desk, the dregs of 
last night’s chicken soup at the bottom. I 
pulled on a pair of wool socks and brown 
leather shoes. Before leaving the house, I 
checked on two baseball-mitt sized pork 
cheeks I have curing in my basement.

For breakfast, I drank a cup of coffee 

with a splash of milk in it, and a croissant 
— which must have contained a half-stick 
of butter. I ate in a hurry, because I was 
on my way to see Eva Roos.

We met in the basement of a local cof-

fee shop. Eva is tall and striking, with 
fiery hair buzzed into a Skrillex cut. A 
button, reading “End Police Violence,” 
was pinned to her jacket. I turned on my 
recorder, and spoke, quite timidly: “So … 
veganism.”

Eva is a vegan; she consumes 

no animal products. She became 
a vegetarian Thanksgiving of 
her freshman year, and then 
fully vegan last October while 
studying abroad in Copenhagen. 
But why would she make such a 
drastic change? Why would any-
one?

“I’ve always had huge con-

cern for the environment, and 
it just didn’t match up with my 
morals anymore to continue eat-
ing meat,” she said. “I also know 
my relationship with other ani-
mals and creatures. I know that 
if I knew the animal I could 
never be the one to kill it. That 
would be really hypocritical of 
me, and it just didn’t sit right.”

Copenhagen wasn’t exactly 

the best place to start as a vegan, and not just because Denmark, 
like most Northern European countries, is notoriously meat-
heavy.

“What I ate was pretty undiverse, because I couldn’t read any 

of the labels,” she said. “I’m pretty sure I did vegan wrong.”

The idea of doing veganism “wrong” is as old as the term 

itself. Vegetarianism has been around for thousands of years 
— the Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras sup-
posedly forbid his followers from eating meat, as did many of 
the earliest Hindu and Buddhist teachers. But a named vegan-
ism only came about in 1944, when Donald Watson founded The 
Vegan Society in Leicester, England. A group of dissidents from 
the established Vegetarian Society, they rejected not only meat, 
but dairy and eggs.

Fast forward to modern times, and the United States is home 

to 1 million vegans.

Veganism, like feminism, has its own internal subdivisions 

and sometimes-radical disagreements on self-definition. There 
are ethical vegans, environmental vegans, health vegans, even 
“flexible” vegans. Some people are only dietary vegans. Others 
won’t wear leather or wool. There are continuing arguments 
over the ethics of consuming honey and oysters.

Eva is an environmental vegan, noting the impact of ani-

mal industries on carbon levels, water purity and land use. For 
food, she splits a farmshare (a stake in a local farm’s vegetable 
crop) with her sister, who isn’t a vegan but likes cooking. They 
get together on Sundays to convert the mound of vegetables 
into bulk vegan meals for the week: lentils, butternut squash 
soup, vegetable pizzas, even “frittatas” made with pureed tofu 
instead of eggs.

At this point in the conversation, I expect Eva to say “And 

this is why everyone should go vegan!” Instead, she remained 
almost painfully non-judgmental.

“If you’re a vegan, you can’t be — I think, personally, that I 

don’t have the right to be picky, because I’m imposing this on 
myself,” she said. 

Not all vegans are as nuanced. Yuval Noah Harari, Israeli 

historian and ethical vegan activist, recently took to the pages 
of The Guardian to claim that “animals are the main victims 
of history, and the treatment of domesticated animals in indus-
trial farms is perhaps the worst crime in history.”

So I decided to hunt down some ethical vegans.
Laura “Lita” Brillman is an LSA junior studying in Wash-

ington, D.C this semester. Lita became a vegetarian when she 
was 12, and then a full vegan her senior year of high school. 
She comes at it from a broader animal rights perspective — she 
avoids cosmetics tested on animals, won’t visit a zoo or aquari-
um, and wouldn’t go horseback riding if the opportunity arose.

“I didn’t know being a vegetarian you still harm so many ani-

mals,” she said. “I didn’t realize dairy and eggs kill. You can’t 
feel great about being a vegetarian if you want to save as many 
animals as possible.”

It’s true. Even if you aren’t opposed to the idea of breeding 

and holding animals for human purposes, the dairy and egg 
industries still deal out an unsettling amount of death. The 
dairy industry obviously only requires adult females — many 
male calves are sold as veal. Millions of useless male chicks are 
born a year, and many are killed in huge meat grinders soon 
after birth. Cows and chickens too old to produce anymore are 
usually slaughtered for meat.

It was this reality that made LSA sophomore Sarah Gallagher 

go vegan four years ago. She heard a story about a cow that gave 
birth for the fifth time, and the calf was taken shortly after so 
that the mother could be milked. But she was dry. The farmer 
investigated, and found that the mother had actually birthed 
twins, and in a bovine version of “Sophie’s Choice,” was hid-
ing one of the calves in the woods, and allowed the other to be 
taken away.

“I didn’t really care about the health benefits — I’ve always 

considered myself a pretty healthy person,” she said. “It was 
the ethics that really got to me.”

Our campus is full of vocal activists, students who identify 

inequalities and injustices, and are ready to remind others, pub-
licly and privately. After talking with several vegans, I was left 
wondering how a vegan could even associate with meat eaters 
anymore? Or, more realistically, how do they resist the urge to 
chastise them?

Sarah lives in a sorority house with its own dining hall, where 

she finds enough cereal, salad, and hummus to make meals. But 
many of her friends eat meat and dairy.

“I don’t like to push my views onto them, because that makes 

people really uncomfortable most of the time,” she said. “I don’t 
talk about it much with people who I know wouldn’t be recep-
tive.”

This is a common pattern amongst the vegans I spoke with. 

Because eating is such a common, yet intimate experience, 
many people become anxious and/or defensive in the pres-
ence of vegans, and feel like they’re under attack. In a struggle 
between personal morals and social decorum, the latter often 
wins.

“There’s this perception is that vegans talk about veganism 

all the time from a morally superior point of view,” Lita told me. 
“I’m not going to express discomfort unless it comes up.”

She was quick to add that she didn’t even judge non-vegans as 

harshly as one would think.

“A lot of the time people feel guilty, but don’t have willpower 

or drive to do it,” she explained. “We all have things like that. I 
should drive less, but I don’t.” 

The primary difficulty of adopting a vegan diet isn’t giving 

up animal products — in fact, most vegans I talked to reported 
having few to no cravings for meat, cheese, eggs, or milk any-
more. Instead, it’s ensuring that what they eat doesn’t have 
any animal products in it. Jell-O and many gummy candies are 
made with gelatin derived from animal bones. Most barbeque 
chips have traces of milk in them. Guinness recently pledged to 
go vegan — for 257 years, they’ve used a fish-bladder compound, 
isinglass, to filter their beer. What’s a vegan to do?

In Ann Arbor, you could go to The Lunch Room, one of only 

two vegan eateries in town. It began as a food truck in 2010 by 
vegan friends Phillis Engelbert and Joel Panozzo. In August 
2013, it opened as a permanent space, followed by a sister bak-
ery a year later. I spoke with Panozzo at the restaurant over 
cups of vegan coffee. As he explained the restaurant’s philoso-
phy, a fly buzzed near my head, and I suppressed the instinct to 
immediately crush it.

“We put a lot of effort into assuring that every point of con-

tact in the restaurant is entirely vegan, and has absolutely no 
animal products in it,” Panozzo said. “I’ve made sure even the 
sugar and the liquor are vegan.”

Unsurprisingly, The Lunch Room has become a safe haven 

for campus vegans, unable to trust most restaurants. What’s 

surprising is that, according 
to Panozzo, almost 90 percent 
of their customer base isn’t 
vegan. Most people come in 
because they want an afford-
able, healthy, meat-free meal.

“We assume that most 

vegans out there will find 
us,” Panozzo said. “We’re 
really interested in reaching 
everyone else, and hopefully 
influencing their choices, and 
breaking the stereotype of 
vegan food as bland, expen-
sive and unfulfilling.”

Obviously, 
most 
vegans 

can’t make it to The Lunch 
Room for every meal. Many 
cook for themselves, or head 
to University Dining Halls, all 
of which serve vegetarian and 
vegan entrees at every meal. 
The two newest dining halls, 
South Quad and East Quad, 
even have purpose-built veg-
etarian stations. But when 
eating becomes a matter of 
personal morals, many vegans 
still feel the need to inquire 
about their meal, even if it is 
advertised as vegan.

“Being a vegan, you have to 

be okay with being a nuisance 
sometimes.” Dylan Nelson, an 
LSA junior and South Quad 
Residential Advisor said. “You 
have to be an asshole some-
times, in order to make the 
choices you want to make.”

Dylan became a vegan a 

year ago, after eight months 
of vegetarianism. Improbably, 
his parents, sister and high 
school girlfriend were all veg-
etarians.

“I’d always say ‘Nah, I 

couldn’t that,’ ” he said. “In fact, I ate more meat than most 
people.”

When he got to college, he gradually became a vegetarian, as 

he cut down on eating meat for both ethical and environmen-
tal reasons. Last Thanksgiving break, ironically, he watched a 
vegan documentary, “From Farm to Fridge.” He hasn’t looked 
back since.

“I just couldn’t participate in that anymore,” he said “And 

after that, I found many more reasons to go vegan.”

He cut out animal foods from his diet, and stopped buy-

ing clothes made with animal products. Last month, he even 
swapped out his old leather wallet for a pleather one. He feels 
more at peace with himself, but doesn’t want that to come off to 
others as smugness.

“People assume that vegans are self-righteous, and certainly 

some of them are,” he said. “I hope I don’t come off as self-righ-
teous. The reason that I say anything to anyone is to open up a 
conversation. I want them to ask me why I’m a vegan, and why 
it’s important to me, so that either they can something about 
the meat industry that they didn’t know, or at least get my per-
spective, and understand that I recognize that for some people, 
veganism or vegetarianism is completely unrealistic.”

Before our conversation ended, Dylan suggested I watch 

another documentary, “Earthlings,” to get a better idea of why 
some people choose to become vegans. After a scene of a bull 
getting dehorned with bolt cutters, I slammed my laptop shut.

Ann Arbor, given its progressive climate and number of veg-

an-friendly restaurants and shops, is certainly not a half-bad 
place to go vegan. And given the relative wealth of the student 
body, many can afford to buy more expensive products like 
organic vegetables and faux-meat products. Veganism, it should 
be said, is not a feasible lifestyle for everyone here.

But for those who do choose to be vegan, I still wonder what 

the point is. Our world runs on animal usage and death. Vac-
cines are incubated in chicken eggs. Most condoms contain a 
milk extract. Growing vegetables’ food uses animals — ground 
bones as fertilizer, captive bees to pollinate, countless mice 
crushed during plowing.

I asked Eva Roos why, as an individual, she would go vegan, 

in the face of such large, entrenched systems.

“It just, morally, sits better with me, because I don’t feel like I 

have a lot of control in the system I’m existing in,” she said. “As 
far as making an environmental impact, I do what I can. But 
food is the one thing I have control over, so I really don’t allow 
myself to make exceptions.”

Student Profile: 
Nicole Potchen

by Tanya Madhani, 
Daily Staff Reporter

L

SA senior Nicole Potchen, president of Circle K, a 
service organization on campus, said she’s been 
involved in community service her entire life — from 

helping her church to National Honor Society in high school. 
But she didn’t get involved in community service at the 
University until some of her friends had mentioned that she 
could take part in an Alternative Spring Break trip with them 
to Denver, Colo., for Habitat for Humanity.

“A long drive like that, you definitely bond with everyone 

else in the car after being with them for so long,” Potchen 
said.

She didn’t have any experience with construction or 

building houses, she said, but the experience grew her 
passion for service and for Circle K, who sponsored the ASB 
trip.

Circle K’s largest event, Potchen said, is Service Day, a 

24-hour cycle of continuous community service and is the 
first large Circle K event she participated in when she first 
joined.

“I just got to meet a lot of great people on Service Day,” 

she said. “Even though I was a member of the club, I wasn’t 
very active at that time, but after Service Day, I became very 
active. I got involved with the leadership team the next year 
and I’ve been involved ever since.”

The event this year is from 8 a.m. on Nov. 14 to 8 a.m. 

on Nov. 15. The organization has partnered with twenty 
different student organizations, 200 Greek Life students and 
the Ginsberg Center for its eleventh year.

The Michigan Daily interviewed Potchen as she made 

final preparations for the upcoming event.

What do you think the climate is surrounding 

community service at the University?

I think I have a unique perspective, because I’m so 

involved with Circle K. I probably view it differently than 
most people. I would say, in general, I think sometimes 
community service can be viewed as a burden rather than 
something that is good. I think a lot of people do community 
service for their resumes and because it will help them in 
their personal growth in their career. But, I think that, for 
me and for most of the people that I’m surrounded by, we do 
community service because we think that it’s our duty and 
that’s what we should do. I think a lot of people actually do 

view it that way, but they think that college is very tricky to 
find the time to actually do community service. I’ve learned 
that it really doesn’t take that much time. It’s really fit into 
your schedule and can work pretty well.

Why do you think it’s important, as a college student, to 

participate in community service?

Just because you’re in college, doesn’t really mean that 

you don’t (have) time for service. I think that a lot of people 
brush it to the side. But doing community service really 
breaks you out of the college bubble that you’re living in. It’s 
really easy to get sucked into “I need to study,” “I need to do 
well on this exam,” and by doing community service and by 
getting out of even just Ann Arbor for a day or a few hours, 
you get a different perspective on real life. I think that’s 
really important to keep in mind, that we’re not just isolated 
here on campus. The University of Michigan is not the only 
thing that matters right now, even though a lot of people get 
sucked into that.

How do you think Service Day impacts those who 

participate in it?

If you have not really been involved in Circle K, then this 

even will definitely push you to be involved because of the 
people you meet and seeing the impact that we have. You 
really get to know the people that you’re volunteering with 
and you personally feel like you’ve accomplished so much 
at the end of the day. My freshman year, I left around 10 or 
11 p.m. and I just felt so fulfilled. I had just done all these 
awesome things in just a day. It’s definitely a way for people 
to get a taste of what community service feels like and see all 
the benefits it can have. It’s a way for people to break out of 
their study cycle where you’re always worrying about your 
next project or your next exam. It’s a way to do something 
different and meet new people.

How is it beneficial to the community to have this one, 

24-hour day where students give back?

Just because of the volume of people we get at this event. 

We’re sending a lot more people to each community partner 
we’re going to than we usually send. For example, we have a 
project with MAC Therapeutic Riding and we send four to 
five volunteers every week, but for Service Day we’re sending 

40 people. So by sending so many people, we’re really helping 
out the organization and, because it’s run locally, they will 
really see the impact of just this one-day. There are a lot of 
other projects similar to that and because of the volume that 
we’re sending, then its really helping organizations.

What do you think has been the most rewarding 

experience for you through Circle K?

That’s a big question. Just my personal growth throughout 

the years and the change in perception I’ve had. I think I 
view community service completely differently than what I 
did four years ago when I first joined. I kind of viewed it as 
something that I have to do or something that I should do. It 
felt just like an obligation to me, but now I understand the 
reasons behind why I’m doing it. For me a lot of that is rooted 
in social justice. When we do a project at a food bank, it’s 
really important to understand why we’re doing that project 
and all of these social inequities that make that service 
necessary. This is also local and people don’t understand that 
these are problems that are happening in Ann Arbor. There 
are so many people that go hungry every day and so even 
just by making my small contribution, I feel like I’m doing 
something that can try and reduce some of the problems that 
other people are having.

What kind of support have you had from the University 

and local community?

So, this is the first year that we’re being sponsored by the 

Ginsberg Center, which is the place that does community 
service on campus. It’s really exciting to be working with 
them for the first time, officially. We’ve always had the event 
at the Ginsberg Center and now we’re officially working with 
them and it’s been really great so far. It’s been really helpful 
to have advisers and people there to help us with some of 
the planning aspects of it and have been really helpful with 
planning the reflections that we do all throughout the event. 
It’s great to know that we’re being recognized for doing 
something that’s impactful. It’s also comforting because I 
know this event will continue to happen in the future with 
continued sponsorship. Just knowing that we have the 
University’s support behind us is great for us.

Personal Statement: Getting it on paper

riting isn’t easy. Hell, I’ve been writing this 
piece for over an hour now. I might have 
been staring into empty space for most of 

that time, but it’s all part of the process, isn’t it?

It’s not.
It’s funny how I find myself in the same position 

almost every time I sit down to write something. It’s 
not like I don’t have ideas — they hit me so often during 
the day that I can’t keep count. In the shower, on the 
bus, in class, before I fall asleep … the opportunities 
are endless, but none are taken. I’ve always thought 
that college students take a certain amount of pride in 
procrastinating. It makes us feel kind of cool.

“Dude, I had a totally unproductive day today.”
“My week has been so unproductive.”
“I should have started this assignment five hours 

ago, but then I opened Netflix…”

How many times have these statements been made, 

and how many times have we actually felt a little good 
saying them, instead of feeling a great deal of regret? 
I’ve done it a few times. And so have you — don’t lie. 
The fact of the matter is that procrastination is wrong. 
It’s a horrible thing to do, we should be glad we have 
the time to do anything, really, and we should make 
the best possible use of it. Carpe diem the shit out of 
everything.

This is pretty rich coming from a guy who’s basically 

been sitting around for the better part of the day 
thinking of something to write about. I guess what’s 
making me regret it now is that I’ve actually had ideas, 
things I want to write about … it’s just that I get too 
comfortable too quickly. Dreaming out the perfect 
idea is so satisfying I forget to actually write the idea 
down. And really, what good is thinking of everything 

within your head if you don’t have anything to show 
for it in terms of tangible creative output?

I’ve always thought that writing is a two-part 

process. Writers have to be good thinkers, and they 
have to be good writers. Surprising, isn’t it? For an 
idea to be worth writing, it has to be well thought out, 
original, and interesting. That is the job of the thinker 
within the writer. The writer half is responsible for 
effectively translating thoughts into word. Crafting 
out the sentiment that you carry within you is what 
makes you a writer. Without it, you’re just a dreamer. 
That’s obviously not a bad thing; it’s just not what most 
writers want to be.

Writing is a skill that needs to be nourished and 

polished over time. And what’s the best way to do 
that? It’s to actually write. It’s absolutely essential for 
writers to devote time and energy to their craft and let 
it blossom over time.

Again, I realize this is priceless coming from me, 

someone who’s literally writing about how he cannot 
write, but I’m preaching to myself. I’m writing down 
what’s on my mind at this very instant, and after all — 
didn’t I just say that’s what I’m supposed to do? (Wow, 
talk about a self-serving piece.)

I remember watching a TED Talk a few years ago, 

which connects directly to this moment and this 
piece. I don’t remember who the speaker was, but it 
was a really successful and famous author. She spoke 
about how every writer, or every aspiring writer, has 
a “friend” that helps him or her write. She referred 
to this “friend” as a creative genie. Now this genie 
is a funny little guy. At random points in the day, 
whenever he chooses, he’ll climb into your ear and 
whisper brilliant ideas that you’re supposed to turn 

into brilliant stories. Technically, the only real job of a 
writer is to listen to the genie and write. But the catch 
is that if you don’t listen to your genie instantly, it’ll 
run away with its idea and you’ll never get a hold of 
that idea again.

I thought that this was the most ridiculous TED talk 

ever. I couldn’t believe I had wasted fifteen minutes of 
the time I usually wasted on PlayStation listening to 
this.

Fast forward a few years and I’m sitting here, 

writing this, to tell you that the genie is real. I’m 
serious. And he’s a slimy little bugger. Every time I 
was hit with an idea in the shower, bus or wherever, 
I really should have been writing it down. Writing 
isn’t easy. An idea might seem brilliant at one moment 
and ridiculous after a while, but that’s because in that 
moment, you’re able to really see the idea for what it is. 
You’ll be able to plan it out perfectly in your head and 
really feel it. It’s then that you should put pen to paper 
and write something, anything. Once the moment’s 
gone, it’s gone forever and you’re probably never going 
to feel it again.

The reason I’m talking about this is because I’ve 

just realized how many times I’ve been struck by 
something seemingly inspirational, but I just get so 
content with the idea itself that I forget to write it 
down. The thinker within me effectively lulls the 
writer into a false sense of security and subdues him, 
and the idea gets lost within my head. It’s a wonder 
that my genie keeps coming back to me because, really, 
I’m not a good friend to it. But I’m done messing 
around now, I’m ready for a serious commitment and 
I’ll be waiting for my genie with a pen and paper in 
hand. (As long as I’m not in the shower.)

Bomber 
Plant 
on 

Saturday, October 24th in search of 
a Guinness World Record. Each one 
wore blue coveralls, work boots, and 
a red and white polka-dot bandanna 
to reclaim the record for the number 
of Rosie the Riveters gathered in 
one place. The participants, some as 
young as one year-old, joined forty-
three 
original 
“Rosies,” 
women 

who worked at the plant during 
World War II. The plant was one of 
the country’s largest bomber plane 
producers during the war and the 
workplace of Rose Will Monroe, the 
inspiration for Rosie the Riveter. 
While the official count is still being 
validated by Guinness, it appears that 
the women will soon hold the record.
