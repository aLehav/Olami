'U' has not yet

attendence policy
due to Jan. 3 game
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily Staff Reporter
Though the Sugar Bowl is on
the eve of the first day of class
next semester, students are
flocking to buy tickets to the
game.
Steve Lambright, director of
ticket operations for the Uni-
versity's Athletic Department,
said that as of 3:45 p.m. yester-
day, his office had sold about
13,000 tickets out of the 17,500
that were allotted to the Univer-
sity for the Jan. 3 game against
Virginia Tech. Students bought
1,800 of those tickets at a price
of $97 each.
Lambright said he thought
the ticket sales on the first day
were "fantastic."
"We didn't make any predic-
tions. We were just hoping for
some real strong sales, and I
think that's what we saw," Lam-
bright said.

Fitzgerald said the Office of

Obama's guidelines
to diversify student
bodies could be at
odds with Prop. 2
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily StaffReporter
A new set of affirmative action
guidelines introduced by Presi-
dent Barack Obama on Friday
could boost diversity in colleges
and universities across the coun-
try. But the University may not
be one of them.
The guidelines made by the
Departments of Justice and Edu-
cation suggest that higher educa-
tion institutions should consider
criteria such as socioeconomic
status, domestic instability and
the hardships students have
overcome when schools make
admissions decisions. The idea
behind the criteria is that they
will create a diverse student
make-up among these catego-
ries, which will inherently diver-
sify the racial makeup of the
student body. However, the Uni-
versity may not be able to operate
under these guidelines because
of the statewide ban on the con-

sideration of race in higher edu-
cation admissions, which was
decided on by voters through a
ballot proposal in 2006.
Though the 6th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals overturned
Proposal 2 in a 2-1 decision in
July, the court has decided to
review the decision. George
Washington, a lawyer with the
Coalition to Defend Affirmative
Action, Integration and Fight for
Equality By Any Means Neces-
sary, said this means Proposal
2, or the Michigan Civil Rights
Initiative, will be in effect until
judges re-try the case in March.
Washington added that the
guidelines, as a declaration of
Obama's views, could influence
the court's ruling.
"It clearly endorses affirma-
tive action, and that endorse-
ment to us makes clear that state
laws trying to ban it have to
give way to federal civil rights,"
Washington said.
The new guidelines replaced
those put in place by the Bush
administration in 2008. The
Bush era guidelines cautioned
higher education institutions
against selecting students based
on race.

By ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily Staff Reporter
A student reported that
she was sexually assaulted in
her room in Baits I Residence

Hall yesterday at about 11 a.m.,
according to a crime alert sentby
the University's Department of
Public Safety last night.
The suspect in the sexual.
assault is a "visiting acquain-
tance" of the survivor, according
to the alert.
DPS spokeswoman Diane
Brown said in an interview last
night that the suspect did not
forcibly enter the survivor's

room. At the time, Brown said
there was no further information
on the nature of the assault.
The survivor provided a
description of the suspect, and
Brown said DPS officials are
working to identify him. The
suspect is described in the crime
alert as being a light-skinned
black man in his 20s with an
"average build."

Rose Bowl Queen against lowering voting age

40 years ago today (Dec.
9,1971):AstheWolverinespre-
pared to go to the Rose Bowl,
The Michigan Daily obtained
an exclusive interview with
that year's Rose Bowl Queen,
Margo Lynn Johnson, from
Pasadena City College.
Nineteen-year-old John-
son, who the article states
tipped the scales at a "sleek"
120 pounds and enjoyed ski-
ing and swimming, said being
queen for the year was a
dream of hers. In the parade,
Johnson was to be the "main
flower" along with "six meaty
specimens" who made up her
court, accordingto the article.
During the interview,
Johnson declined to answer

questions about politics -
as well as questions about
the draft, the Vietnam war,
marijuana, women's libera-
tion or campus unrest, which
she said she could not answer
because of Rose Bowl board
regulations. But she did say
she was against 18-year-olds
having voting rights because
she was not sure of her own
political beliefs at age 18.
"When I do vote, you can
bet that I'll vote intelligently,"
she told The Daily at the time.
20 years ago this week
(Dec. 10, 1991): With the end
of the semester approaching,
more than 350 people waited
up to four hours to use the
computers at the Angell Hall

computing center.
"I waited for two hours
with a friend," then-LSA
senior Val Washington said.
"We went shopping and got
food while we waited."
Jeff Adams, who worked
at the computing center, said
a record number of people
flooded the computer site.
"There's a record back-up
this term," Adams said. "It's
busier than most because
more people are becoming
computer literate."
90 years ago this week
(Dec. 8, 1921): While students
were preparing for finals,
children in the University
Hospital were busy getting
ready for a visit from Santa

Claus.
The children decked out
the hospital in bright strips of
paper and used trees and toys
donated from the previous
year's fraternity holiday par-
ties. One child named Henry,
who the article described as
a "little red-headed fellow,"
was furiously working on the
decorations and told the Daily
at the time that he preferred
the red strips.
According to the article,
many of the girls preparing
for Santa's visit wanted "dolls
that sleep," and one girl in
particular asked for acab and
a bed for her doll.

of public art are gifts to their
viewers.
"Our willingness to take
chances to make these gifts of
beauty happen for ourselves
and for complete strangers says
something about us as a city, as
a culture and as a people," Elliot
said.
Briere stressed that while she
appreciates the concern of the
many speakers who insisted on
the importance of public art for
the city, the changes to the ordi-

nance were not a matter of sup-
porting or not supporting public
art.
"I'm terrifically impressed
with the passion that was
expressed tonight by those
advocates of public art, and I
want to be clear that to me, we
really are talking about a fund-
ing mechanism," Briere said.
She added that the amend-
ments were intended to clarify
and redefine the meaning of
capital improvements, adding
that the percentage change, if
passed, would not be signifi-
cant.
"This is a very narrow ordi-

nance, and the impact is also in
itself very narrow," Briere said.
Council member Christo-
pher Taylor (D-Ward 3) said he
doubted that cutting the funds
for public art to half of one per-
cent would have been an effec-
tive way to free up funds for
other initiatives like city infra-
structure projects.
"I also doubt that it will have
a material impact on our abil-
ity to fix water mains and to
pave streets and to fix potholes
because I see no evidence to the
contrary," Taylor said.
Council members ultimately
did not pass the amendments.

want to chip away at it.
"This campaign takes the Jew-
ish vote very, very seriously," said
Ira Forman, the Obama campaign
Jewish outreach director. "I'm
confident this will be the most
comprehensive effort in presi-
dential campaign history."
The White House outreach
has increased since May when
Obama caused a furor by calling
for Israel's 1967 borders, with
agreed-upon land swaps, as a
basis for resuming negotiations
toward a two-state solution with
the Palestinians. Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
rejected the '67 borders as inde-
fensible and largely disregarded
Obama's emphasis on land swaps
to account for current conditions.
Republicans seized on the dis-
pute. And while Obama support-
ers say his argument was widely
mischaracterized, damage was
done. Now the Obama campaign
and its backers say they are deter-
mined to respond rapidly to such
criticism in future.
"We are trying to responsibly
respond to all of these unsub-
stantiated or false allegations,
but there are so many of them,
and they areso frequently recited
despite the fact that the people
who are spreading them have to
know that they're false, that it's
hard to keep up with them," said
Alan Solow.

S&P threatens to
cut credit ratings
on 15 European
countries
PARIS (AP) - Seeking to
restore confidence in the euro,
the leaders of France and Ger-
many jointly have called for
changes to the European Union
treaty so that countries using the
euro would face automatic pen-
alties if budget deficits ran too
high.
But not everyone on Wall
Street was reassured that Europe
would get control of its 2-year-
old debt crisis.
Stock prices rose and bor-
rowing costs for European gov-
ernments dropped sharply in
response to the changes proposed
yesterday by French President
Nikolas Sarkozy and German
Chancellor Angela Merkel. But
some of the optimism faded late
in the day when Standard and
Poor's threatened to cut its credit
ratings on 15 eurozone countries,
including the likes of Germany,
France and Austria which have
been considered Europe's safest
government debt issuers.
The announcement came

only hours after Sarkozy and
Merkel revealed sweeping plans
to change the EU treaty in an
effort to keep tighter checks on
overspending nations. The pro-
posal is set to form the basis of
discussions at a summit of EU
leaders on Thursday and Fri-
day that is expected to provide
a blueprint for an exit from the
crisis.
While the Franco-German
plan would tie the 17-eurozone
nations closer together, a tighter
union would likely also result
in heavier financial burdens for
the region's stronger economies,
which have already put up bil-
lions of euros to rescue Greece,
Ireland and Portugal.
Analysts noted that the pro-
posals did not foresee a clear
roadmap on how to get the euro-
zone economies growing again
and to reduce funding costs for
struggling nations in the long-
term.
"If this is all we get it's really
very bad news for the future of
the euro," said Simon Tilford,
chief economist at London's Cen-
tre for European Reform.
Many analysts have called
on the European Central Bank
to intervene in debt markets to
lower struggling countries' bor-
rowing costs or the creation of

eurobonds - debt backed by all
17 euro countries.
The euro fell after the S&P
announcement, trading down 0.1
percent at $1.339, and trading in
futures on the S&P 500 and Dow
Jones Industrial Average turned
negative.
After the New York markets
closed, S&P confirmed that it
had placed 15 nations on notice
for possible downgrades.
Only two countries that
use the euro weren't affected:
Cyprus already had that designa-
tion and Greece already has rat-
ings low enough to suggest that
it's likelyto default soon anyway.
France and Germany, the
eurozone's two largest econo-
mies which currently both have
an AAA-rating, quickly came out
against the S&P move.
"Germany and France reaf-
firm that the proposals they
made jointly today will reinforce
the governance of the euro area
in order to foster stability, com-
petitiveness and growth," they
said in a joint statement. "France
and Germany, in full solidarity,
confirm their determination to
take all the necessary measures,
in liaison with their partners
and the European institutions to
ensure the stability of the euro
area."

Alleged murderer
currently jailed
for drug and
prostitution charges
CLEVELAND (AP) - A self-
styled chaplain suspected in a
deadly scheme to rob people who
replied to a Craigslist job ad will
be charged with murder and
attempted murder in attacks on
four victims and could face the
death penalty, a prosecutor said
yesterday.
The chief prosecutor in north-
east Ohio's Summit County,
Sherri Bevan Walsh, said local
officials in southeast Ohio and
state and federal officials signed
off on an agreement to let her
office take the lead against Rich-
ard Beasley, 52.
Three deaths and the wound-
ing of a fourth man are part of
the investigation in the plot to
lure victims with the promise of
a farm job in southeast Ohio.
"In deciding where and how
to try this case, our primary con-
cern was doing what is in the
best interest of the victims and
their families," said Walsh, who
noted that most of the victims
are from the Akron-Canton area.
Beasley, who has been jailed in
Akron on unrelated prostitution
and drug charges, has denied
involvement in the Craigslist
slayings. Email and phone mes-
sages seeking comment were left
yesterday for his attorney han-
dling the drug case.
Beasley was arrested in
November after authorities
linked him to the alleged Craig-
slist plot.
An acquaintance of Beasley's,
Brogan Rafferty, 16, of nearby of
Stow, faces juvenile charges of
aggravated murder, complicity

to aggravated murder, attempt-
ed murder and complicity to
attempted murder in the death
of one man and the shooting of

Authorities say the plot's first
victim, David Pauley, 51, of Nor-
folk, Va., came to Ohio in mid-
October after answering the
Craigslist ad. A friend has said
Pauley was desperate for work
and eager to return to Ohio.
Police say he was killed Oct.
23, and his body was found Nov.
15. Family members had contact-
ed police concerned they hadn't
heard from him.
Timothy Kern, 47, of Mas-
sillon, whose body was buried
near an Akron shopping mall,
answered the ad and was last
seen Nov. 13, authorities said.
The body of Ralph Geiger, the
potential third victim, was found
in a shallow grave Nov. 25.
A South Carolina man also
answered the ad and was shot
Nov. 6 before escaping, police
say.
The murder and attempted
murder charges will cover those
four men, said April Wiesner,
spokeswoman for the prosecu-
tor. No timetable has been set for
filing charges, she said.
Beasley was a Texas parolee
when he returned to Ohio in
2004 after serving several years
in prison on a burglary convic-
tion. He was released from an
Akron jail on July 12 after he
posted bond on a drug-traffick-
ing charge. Texas officials say he
never should have been released
from jail and that they issued a
warrant for his arrest because
the charge violated his parole.
Beasley appeared briefly in
an Akron courtroom last week
on the drug charge, wheeled
into court after he apparently
became ill and said he needed a
wheelchair.

German pensions
After a year of tough negotia-

pensions to about 16,000 addi-
tional Holocaust victims world-
wide - mostly survivors who
were once starving children in
Nazi ghettos, or were forced to
live in hiding for fear of death.
The agreement announced
yesterday between the New York-
based Claims Conference and the
German government is "not about
money - it's about Germany's
acknowledgment of these peo-
ple's suffering," said Greg Schnei-
der, the conference's executive
vice president.
"They're finally getting recog-

as children," he told The Associ-

Afghanistan in
need of financial
support until 2024
Afghanistan will need the
financial support of other coun-
tries for at least another decade
beyond the 2014 departure of
foreign troops, Afghan President
Hamid Karzai said yesterday at
an international conference.
But the conference on the
future of Afghanistan in Bonn
was overshadowed by a public
display of bad blood between the
United States and Pakistan, the
two nations with the greatest
stake and say in making Afghani-
stan safe and solvent.
Pakistan boycotted the meet-
ing to protest an apparently
errant U.S. air strike last month
that killed 24 Pakistani soldiers
along the rough border with
Afghanistan. The strike fur-
thered the perception in Paki-
stan that NATO and the U.S. are
its true enemies, not the Taliban
militants that operate on both
sides of the border.
"It was unfortunate that they
did not participate," U.S. Sec-
retary of State Hillary Rodham
Clinton said.

Syria said yesterday it would
agree to allow Arab League

months of bloodshed, but placed
a number of conditions, including
the cancellation of deeply embar-
rassing economic sanctions.
Arab League chief Nabil Elar-
aby swiftly rebuffed Damascus'
demands, and the Syrian oppo-
sition accused President Bashar
Assad's regime of wasting time
and trying to trick Arab leaders
into reversing punitive measures
against Damascus.

For three decades, the Republi-

That record helps explain
why Newt Gingrich, a self-

working more aggressively
than any of his competitors to

LONDON (AP) - Britain's
spending watchdog warned
London Olympic organizers
today that they run a risk of
exceeding their 9.3 billion-
pound ($14.6billion) budget for
hosting the event and have lit-
tle room for unforeseen costs.
The National Audit Office
report concluded that while
the venues are on time and
largely complete, "not every-
thing is rosy." The report came
as British Olympic officials
announced that they had dou-
bled the funding for security
operations at venues, raising
overall security costs for the
2012 Games to more than 1 bil-
lion pounds ($1.6 billion).
"The government is confi-
dent that there is money avail-
able to meet known risks, but,
in my view, the likelihood that
the games can still be funded
within the existing 9.3 billion-
pound public sector funding
package is so finely balanced
that there is a real risk more
money will be needed," said
Amyas Morse, the head of the
National Audit Office.
If that's the case, Olympic
officials would be heading
back hat in hand to British
taxpapers who are already
embroiled in tough economic
times. The Organization for
Economic Cooperation and
Development expects the
U.K. economy to contract in

just days before the vote when it
became clear he would lose big
to Arizona Sen. John McCain.
Many voters couldn't overlook
their skepticism of Romney's
Mormon faith and his reversals
on some cultural issues.
The others in the 2012 race
are treating South Carolina
as an afterthought while they
bank their candidacies on one
of the two states that vote first,
Iowa and New Hampshire.
Enter Gingrich, who's enjoy-
ing a burst of momentum after
a summer campaign meltdown.
"I do believe South Carolina
will be the decisive primary,"
the former House speaker from
Georgia told Republicans who
packed a theater in Newberry
last week. "If we win here, I

believe Iwill be the nominee."
But victory in the state won't
come easy for the thrice-mar-
ried Gingrich.
He has acknowwledged hav-
ing an extramarital affair, an
issue that may turn off Chris-
tian conservatives who hold
great sway in South Carolina.
Gingrich, a recent convert to
Catholicism, frequently makes
a point of talking about his
close partnership with third
wife Callista.
He has advocated a
"humane" approach to immi-
gration that would let longtime
residents work toward citizen-
ship.
Critics have labeled that as
"amnesty" for millions of for-
eigners who are illegally in the
United States, and that's anoth-
er potent issue in the state.

Schools aren't businesses
Michigan education shouldn't be for-profit
or-profit colleges have been in the headlines recently, as stu-
dents began to realize that shareholders are benefiting more
from their education than they are. The issue has now come
to lower education. As the Michigan Legislature examines bills to lift
the cap on the number of charter schools in the state, with proposed
restrictions on for-profit schools, the Legislature should tread care-
fully. Charter schools are usually founded with an honorable mission,
but the potential for corruption can be a concern. Lawmakers should
ensure that all schools that receive public funding are focused on

education, not profits.
A bill that would lift the cap on the number
of charter schools is currently being debated in
the state House of Representatives. Meanwhile
Sen. Rebekah Warren (D-Ann Arbor) is advo-
cating a constitutional amendment that would
ban for-profit charter schools from opening in
Michigan. Education reform groups are also
asking for quality control measures on both
non-profit and for-profit charter schools.
Roughly 80 percent of charter schools in
Michigan can be considered for-profit, accord-
ing to a Forbes article, and if the cap is lifted
on the number of charter schools allowed,
even more for-profit schools could form. The
problem with this type of school is that it takes
money from the school and gives it to the cor-
porations that manage the school. This pro-
cess makes education a business and students
a commodity who yield profits, and it's not the
type of institution the state should support.
Quality controlmeasures for.charter schools
need to be in place to ensure the schools are
doing what they are meant to do: provide a
quality education to Michigan's students.
Public schools are encouraged to display their
budget online as well as some staff salaries
and student testing data. This should also
be required of charter schools. Making this

information available allows the public to hold
charter schools accountable for how they are
spending their money and the type of educa-
tion they are providing.
State Sen. Phil Pavlov (R-St. Clair), the chair
of the Michigan Senate's education commit-
tee, said he believes that eliminating for-profit
schools is hypocritical because non-profit
charter schools as well as public schools spend
money buying supplies from private compa-
nies. But Pavlov is simply trying to cover up the
issue. Non-profit charter schools may purchase
supplies from private companies, but they don't
have shareholders looking to get paid. The dif-
ference lies in who is managing the school and
the primary motivations of those managers.
Charter schools have their place in the public
education landscape and have provided many
positive opportunities for Michigan students.
They are an affordable alternative to tradition-
al public or private schools. But lifting the cap
on the number of charter schools could lead to
an increase in the number of for-profit charter
schools and cyber schools - schools that hold
all classes online - unless quality control mea-
sures are in place. Lawmakers must be careful
to prioritize education and not turn school sys-
tems into for-profit ventures.

administrative tasks to ensure that
their localities are functioning
smoothly. Local governments take
out the trash. The Michigan Student
Assembly allocates money to student
organizations.
But in certain ways, both MSA
and The Michigan Daily paint apic-
ture in which student government
is analogous to the federal govern-
ment in significance and controver-
sy. MSA divides itself into political
parties that supposedly have differ-
ent ideological platforms (though
I imagine that freshmen members
simply choose the party their friends
are in), and the Daily assumes the
oversight role of the media - the
necessary "fourth branch" of gov-
ernment that will keep the other
branches in check.
I love the Daily, but one thing I
haven't been able to understand in
my four years here is the newspa-
per's never-ending feud with MSA.
The Daily prints a scathing edito-
rial of MSA on a regular basis. A
student cannot simultaneously be a
member of MSA and the Daily. And
in my experience within the Daily's
walls, there is a near-unanimous
sentiment that MSA is idiotic and
dysfunctional.
When I was on the Daily's editori-
al board, I asked why we had to pick
apart every single decision that MSA
ever makes. There are two general
responses to this question. One is

that the main purpose of any news-
paper is to inform the public about
government decisions and govern-
ment wrongdoing. The other is that
members of MSA could be the future
politicians of America and need to
learn to be responsible office hold-
ers. The main problem here is that
the newspaper is being overly ideal-
istic. Unlike with state and federal
governments, the day-to-day func-
tioning of MSA has little impact on
most students. This is not because
MSA members are disorganized -
it's simply how student government
works by design.
Here are all the things you will
ever need to know about the Michi-
gan Student Assembly:
Most decisions that are impor-
tant to students are out of student
government's jurisdiction. Two
weeks ago, a Daily editorial urged
students to take studentgovernment
elections seriously. I think I speak
for many when I say that I have zero
interest in the election outcomes.
The University leadership, not MSA,
is responsible for important deci-
sions such as tuition, financial aid,
course offerings and campus safety.
Furthermore, I'm confident that
95 percent of MSA candidates are
motivated people who are qualified
to assure that the organization can
perform its most basic functions. It's
not worth students' time to decide
which candidates are better at allo-
cating funding.
MSA is a student organization.
MSA decisions are more scrutinized
than those of any other group on
campus, and such highlevels of scru-
tiny are completely uncalled for. It's
true that there is a $7.19 tuition fee
that goes directly to student govern-
ment. But a lot of that money trick-
les down to other student groups.
If one were to conduct a study on
the spending practices of campus
organizations, I'd hypothesize that
MSA would turn out to be one of the
most fiscally responsible. But since
it is the only student organization

MSA does make bad decisions,
but it also makes good ones. When
it comes to truly egregious errors
such as the MSA website debacle in
which the student government spent
$9,000 on creating a non-functional
website or scandals involving the
MSA president, I agree that the
Daily has a duty to comment. But
analyzing every single resolution
they passed in a semester, as Daily
columnist Eaghan Davis did ina col-
umn last Tuesday, is not productive.
No matter who's in charge, there
will always be useless MSA resolu-
tions. The only way this can change
is if the University gives the student
government more authority.
What's more, it seems the Daily
is always hesitant to recognize MSA
accomplishments. Statements that
hedge on complimentary often need
to be qualified with a reminder of
everything that is wrong with stu-
dent government (though I was
pleasantly surprised to see this was
not the case in an April editorial on
the Open Housing Initiative).
The Daily's beef with MSA goes
back a long time, and I don't really
expect it to change. But as a staff
member who has been involved in
the editorial process, I don't see any
reason why it has to continue. When
it comes to MSA, the Daily isoften
slinging mud instead of performing
an editorial duty.

constantly in the public spotlight, it
is the only one that gets blamed for
making mistakes.
The Daily should
end its animosity
toward MSA.

A state of emergency?

Women have a prominent place in poli-
tics. It is most likely either as the role of the
crazed, feminist politician - who presumably
has no chance of becoming president - or the
tempting mistress who ruins the campaign
of the once promising male politician. Hill-
ary Clinton, Sarah Palin and Michele Bach-
mann certainly are not perfect presidential
candidates, but what candidate has been? If
a woman presidential candidate is not attrac-
tive, persistent without being pushy and
smart and youthful without being immature,
society writes her off as just another stereo-
typical hormonal and controlling housewife.
This hypocrisy must end.
Bachmann is the most recent example of
this injustice. Politicians, regardless of gen-
der, must realize that putting themselves in
the public eye immediately subjects them to
criticism. However, a certain line must be
drawn as to what constitutes attacks on poli-
cy and agenda and what is critical for a pure-
ly sensational story. The Huffington Post
recently published an article titled, "Michele
Bachmann's Makeup Woes Continue At Book
Signing" complete with zoomed-in photos
and a scathing description. Though, to be
fair, this article is placed in the Life and Style
section, and most people do not read the
Huffington Post to get fashion tips. But that
means readers, who were possibly looking
for more political news, unknowingly judged
Bachmann on the foundation creases on her
forehead, not her ability to run a country.
Bachmann will most likely not be the
Republican presidential candidate. It was
Bachmann who put herself in that position,
not the media or society. However, when
America does have a woman who has expe-
rience and proves herself to be assertive, as
did Hillary Clinton, she is scorned for being
pushy, aggressive and old. In men, these
qualities are usually considered to be "get-
ting things done," but in Clinton's case, it
was her biggest downfall. Clinton was criti-
cized for wearing baggy pantsuits and hair
clips - giving her a "manly" appearance as

described by well-known stylists. This made
her seem too intimidating, which caused citi-
zens to have trouble identifying with her.
What seems to be a growing trend for
women in the political arena is the position of
the fame hungry mistress. Substantial time is
spent trying to uncover the "real" intentions
of these women. The recent scandal involv-
ing GOP presidential candidate Herman Cain
certainly made Cain look bad, but it also sold
the story that these mistresses were trying to
ruin Cain's campaign for five minutes of fame
and a check. Regardless of their intentions,
these women are never portrayed as being
victims of sexual misconduct, which very
well may be the truth.
This is a two-way street. Women in promi-
nent political positions are not that prevalent.
Therefore, they must realize that they rep-
resent women as a whole. Men represent an
extremely high percentage of politicians, so
their decisions, for the most part, are repre-
sentative of themselves. Women do not have
that luxury. Palin, using her vice presidential
candidacy as a way to gain fame through her
own reality show and two book deals, gave
future women in politics one more hurdle to
clear to prove that they are capable leaders.
Why is it that 89 countries surpass America
in terms of women representation in govern-
ment? It may be possible that America's stan-
dards are just unnaturally high for not only
women politicians, but women in general.
Society expects women to be a perfect bal-
ance of powerful and demure, which is a lot to
ask. There needs to be an end to the constant
criticism of things like Bachmann's makeup or
Clinton's strong personality, as both women are
just attempting to fit the expected standards.
Both parties have responsibilities. Women in
the political landscape must have pure inten-
tions, and the media needs to scrutinize more
than just artificialities. Only then can there be
hope for the future women of this country to be
public figures and spearheadbeneficial change.
Adrienne Roberts is an LSA sophomore.

Republican Gov. Rick Snyder
came into office as a self-
styled champion of small
government.
How's he hold-
ing up? Let's take
a look.
In March,
the Republican
majority in the
state Legislature
passed Public
Act 4 - a law DANIEL
that gives Snyder CHARDELL
the authority to ®
declare a state of
"financial emergency" in any munic-
ipality or public school district in the
state. Though similar state laws have
been on the books since 1988, Public
Act 4 has been the source of much
controversy because it significantly
extends the powers given to the gov-
ernor and his appointees.
Here's how the law works.
If state lawmakers fear that a
local government is under "prob-
able financial stress," the governor
may appoint a review team to deter-
mine the severity of the situation.
If the governor confirms the exis-
tence of a financial emergency, he
may unilaterally appoint an emer-
gency manager to take charge of the
local government.
Now here's the best part. Accord-
ing to the Michigan Department
of Treasury's summary of Public
Act 4, elected officials of the local
government in question "are pro-
hibited from exercising any of their
powers of offices without written
approval of the Emergency Man-
ager, and their compensation and
benefits are eliminated." And that's
not all. "In addition to other pow-
ers, an Emergency Manager may
reject, modify or terminate collec-

tive bargaining agreements, recom-
mend consolidation or dissolution
of units of local government, and
recommend bankruptcy proceed-
ings." An emergency manager stays
in power until removed by the
governor, the state Legislature or
"until the financial emergency is
rectified," which, essentially, is left
up to the emergency manager to
decide for himself.
Snyder hasn't shied away from
exercising the unprecedented pow-
ers given to him under Public Act
4. Already, he's appointed financial
emergencymanagers to Benton Har-
bor, Pontiac, Ecorse and the Detroit
Public School district. Flint recently
became the latest municipality to be
slapped with the mark of "financial
emergency," which resulted in Sny-
der's appointment of a new emer-
gency manager there last week as
well. What were the appointee's first
actions as Flint's new leader? Firing
locally elected officials, of course.
What a victory for small gov-
ernment. I'm sure our Founding
Fathers would-be proud of the state
of our democracy.
The debate has taken on a new
urgency over the last several days
as Snyder readies a team to review
Detroit's finances, spurring many
to speculate that the Motor City
may be the Governor's next tar-
get for emergency management. In
response, Rep. John Conyers (D -
Mich), whose congressional district
includes Detroit, has sent a letter to
United States Attorney General Eric
Holder asking the U.S. Department
of Justice to investigate the constitu-
tionality of Snyder's takeovers. Some
critics have framed the implementa-
tion of Public Act 4 as an affront to
civil rights victories of the mid-20th
century. (All of the municipalities to

which Snyder has appointed emer-
gency managers have large African-
American communities.)
Snyder and his supporters jus-
tify Public Act 4 on the grounds of
accountability. (After all, the law
is titled "Local Government and
School District Fiscal Accountabil-
ity Act.") They cite excessive spend-
ing on the part of locally elected
government officials as the primary
threat facing the state of Michigan.
Public Act 4
poses a challenge
to democracy.

I beg to differ.
Yes, we can all agree that account-
ability is vital to a functioning
democracy. But in usurping the dem-
ocratic process,replacingthe elected
with the unelected, telling citizens
that their votes are dispensable and
consolidating power in the hands
of the few in the name of stability,
all these principles fly in the face of
what today's GOP so often preaches.
The hypocrisy is astounding.
I'm surprised and slightly disap-
pointed at how little attention all
this has received, both on campus
and in the media. I challenge any-
one who cares about democracy,
Detroit or both to follow this story as
it develops over the coming weeks.
Don't let it fall by the wayside. More
importantly, don't let Snyder dis-
mantle local governments on the
grounds of an "emergency."

University Law School Prof.

outweigh the risks of missing the

"One of my classes is full, so I
hope that it will not mean that I

look for all the factors - all the
different identities that different
students could bring to a univer-
sity campus. And the experience
of (economic) class is not the
same as the experience of race."
Since Proposal 2 became a
state constitutional amendment
in 2006 - by a vote that Washing-
ton noted was divided along racial
lines - the number of underrep-
resented minority students at the

year barring only last year, when
the percentage stood at 10.6, in
an increase from the 9.1 percent
in the 2009-2010 freshman class.

"It doesn't seem fair for stu-
dents to be punished for sup-
porting our team because due to
circumstances beyond our con-
trol, our bowl is a night game the

kickoff of the Sugar Bowl is only
12 hours before classes start for

LSA senior Joey Bergren
said he purchased Sugar Bowl
tickets on the assumption that
his instructors would excuse
him from the first day of class.
Bergren said Wednesday is his
busiest day next semester, so he
hopes his professors will under-
stand the scheduling conflict.
"I'm (leaning) on the fact that
teachers will be a little more
lenient," Bergren said. "It's a
school-wide thing, it's not like a
certain group of people. We're
all part of this University; it's

mond, also a resident of Baits I,
said it is disconcerting that the
incident occurred in his residence

"It's a little scary that there's
somebody out there that would

Richmond added that he is
confused as to why DPS officers
are unable to find the suspect of
the sexual assault considering he
is an "acquaintance" of the survi-
vor.

Last year, however, also marked
the first time new Higher Educa-
tion Opportunity Act guidelines
were implemented for students'
reporting their ethnicities.
Washington said the guide-
lines released last week could
increase the enrollment of under-
represented minority students if
the University chooses to imple-
ment the federal measures.
"I think it's going to mitigate
the effect, but it's not going to get
to the same outcomes," Washing-
ton said. "It is not a substitute for
race."
But Washington said he would
embrace any effect the guidelines
have on University policies, no
matter how small.
"I welcome any attempt to get
a more diverse student body -
it's what a university education
should be about," Washington
said. "But nobody should think

SACUA members
pass resolution in
response to Penn
State scandal
By MARY HANNAHAN
Daily StaffReporter
In a meeting with the leading
faculty governance body, Univer-
sity President Mary Sue Coleman
responded to questions about
state funding and future fresh-
man class sizes. The faculty also
passed resolutions responding
to student protests at California
universities and a resolution con-
cerning the Penn State sex abuse
scandal.
Coleman said to members
of the Senate Advisory Com-
mittee on University Affairs
yesterday that the University
currently receives 30 percent
less state funding than when she
assumed office in 2002. But in
the face of the reduced funding,
Coleman said faculty and admin-
istration have done a "great
job" cutting costs and increas-
ing efficiency without harming
interaction between faculty and
students.
Coleman said state funding is
crucial to maintaining the Uni-
versity's level of academic excel-
lence. 15-percent was cut from
the 2012 fiscalyear budget, which
totals $5.77billion.
"I am hopeful the governor
will have a budget that realizes
the need to invest ... in higher
education," she said.
Coleman acknowledged that

industryexecutives to improve
the state of American manufac-
turing.
One of the partnership's mis-
sions is to identify high-impact
technologies to help the U.S.
increase its level of global com-
petitiveness. Jack Hu, associate
dean in the College of Engineer-
ing and a professor of manu-
facturing technology, wrote
in an e-mail interview that the
technologies are versatile and of
great economic benefit to manu-
facturing companies and the
U.S. economy.
"These technologies are
ones that can be used by sev-
eral industries, that may have
profound impact on energy effi-
ciency, jobs and the overall U.S.
economic competitiveness," Hu
wrote.

mostly business-related, and
she will be speaking with vari-
ous donors.
"For me it's a development
opportunity, and I get ,to talk
to people who are donors to the
University," Coleman said.
Turning the discussion in a
different direction, LSA junior

Amanda Orley asked Cole-
man how administrators plan
to keep University graduates
working in Michigan.
Coleman urged students to
consider staying in the state
before looking elsewhere for
jobs. To encourage the rever-
sal of what is known as the
brain drain, Coleman said she
asks Michigan businesses to
offer internships for students
and added that her involve-
ment with Business Leaders
for Michigan - an organiza-
tion working to make Michigan
a top state for business - has

students are concerned about the
high cost of a college education,
but said she believes a college
education is essential to maintain
a high quality oflife. She also said
it gives students the opportunity
to grow in various ways.
"Students come out of here
very different than when they
came in," she said. "We give them
the tools to have great lives."
SACUA member Ed Roth-
man, a professor of statistics,
asked Coleman why the Univer-
sity doesn't increase the size of
incoming classes, saying that he
believes it would provide more
people with a quality education
and create greater revenue for the
University.
Before increasing the sizes
of incoming freshman classes,
Coleman said the administration
would need to figure out how
to more efficiently use space in
classrooms and residential build-
ings.
SACUA PASSES
RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT
OF PEACEFUL PROTESTS
Earlier in the meeting, SACUA
members passed a resolution
demonstrating their support for
the peaceful protesters at the
University of California, Berkeley
and the University of California,
Davis who made headlines last
month. The resolution called
upon University of California
administrators to refrain from
using police force against stu-
dents.
On Nov. 18, police officers at
UC Davis pepper-sprayed stu-
dents peacefully protesting by
In May, the AMP will release
information about the high-
impact technology includ-
ing which innovations should
receive a greater amount of fed-
eral funding.,
Earlier this year, Obama
chose University President
Mary Sue Coleman and Hu to
head the partnership's Shared
Facilities and Infrastructure
workstream, which is based
at the University and aims to
expedite the improvement of
manufacturing technologies.
The all-day event next Mon-
day will include tours of the
University's manufacturing and
robotics labs, a panel discus-
sion and meetings for each of
the four AMP workstreams -
Technology Development, Pol-
icy, Education and Workforce
Development and Shared Facili-
ties and Infrastructure.
Hu wrote that the goal of
the meeting is to gather input
from manufacturing profes-
been helpful on this front.
Engineering senior Scott
Wilson asked Coleman and
Harper about public trans-
portation and ways to link the
Ann Arbor campus to Detroit.
As examples of the connec-
tion between the two, Harper
mentioned the Ginsberg Cen-
ter, which provides commu-
nity service opportunities in
the city including Alternative
Weekends and Alternative

Spring Breaks, the Detroit Part-
nership - an organization that
creates volunteer opportunities
for students in Detroit - and
the University's America Reads
Tutoring Corps, a program in
which University students help
local elementary school chil-
dren with their reading skills.
"It's important that we travel
abroad and to be out and about
in the world, but we really
could make- a commitment to
something much more local,"
Harper said.
Wilson also brought up his
concern that North and Central

sitting on the ground. Earlier
in November, protestors at UC
Berkeley were assaulted by cam-
pus police during a peaceful pr-
test.
The SACUA resolution states
that if similar incidents occur at
other universities in the future,
the administrations of these
schools should engage in a dia-
logue with the protesters and lis-
ten to their concerns.
SACUA MEMBERS
RESPOND TO PENN
STATE SCANDAL
SACUA members passed an
additional resolution in response
to the sexual abuse scandal at
Pennsylvania State University.
The resolution provides sugges-
tions about how to prevent simi-
lar scandals at the University of
Michigan and stresses that each
individual, whether a victim or a
witness, is responsible for report-
ing criminal behavior.
Coleman said she has been
actively working with the Office
of General Counsel to enhance
the sense of personal respon-
sibility in reporting crimes on
campus. She said the scandal
at Penn State, in which former
football coach Jerry Sandusky
is accused of sexually abus-
ing young boys, has increased
awareness of crime reporting
and hopes it is an opportunity to
make improvements at the Uni-
versity.
"Out of something bad that
happened, I hope there's some
good thatcomes -thatitwillcre-
ate an opportunity to talk about
these issues," Coleman said.
sionals and the general public to
improve the U.S. manufacturing
industry and prevent operations
from moving abroad.
"The United States is still
the biggest manufacturer in
the world," Hu wrote. "But the
manufacturing sector lost sev-
eral million jobs during the last
decade due to improvement
in manufacturing efficiency
as well as outsourcing. When
manufacturing goes offshore,
research and development
activities are likely to follow."
However, Hu wrote that he
believes the U.S. should contin-
ue investing in manufacturing
in order to increase employ-
ment opportunities, spur the
economy and ensure national
security.
Speakers at the event will
include representatives from
the U.S. Department of Defense
and industry leaders from busi-
nesses such as Ford Motor Com-
pany and Dow Chemical.
campuses aren't as connected
as they could be.
Coleman said improving
transit between the two cam-
puses is an important way the
University tries to make North
Campus more accessible for all
students.
"We'd love to have a mono-
rail," Coleman added with a
chuckle.
Harper said she frequently
rides the buses to and from
North Campus to get the stu-

dent perspective, but she said it
is a "real struggle" to make the
campus more appealing. The
North Campus Initiative is one
attempt to do so.
In an interview after the
event, Coleman said almost
every student who comes to
her monthly fireside chats has
a chance to ask questions and
provides valuable input.
"One of the things I love
about Michigan students is
they're not shy about telling
me what they think," Coleman
said.

Like many other students who
won't be back for the first day
of class on Jan. 4, LSA senior
Maura Beyer wrote in an e-mail
interview that she won't be back
in Ann Arbor until Jan. 5.
"I am not really concerned
about it, and I guess I'll have to
deal with that issue in January
if it does arise," Beyer wrote.
The deadline to purchase tick-

because she thought most major
crimes that have been reported
have occurred on Central Cam-
pus. But Couturier added that
because the suspect was a "vis-
iting acquaintance," she is not
particularly concerned for her
safety.
"I still feel pretty safe here,"
Couturier said. "My feeling about
the safety might have been differ-
ent if it wasn't somebody that she
personally knew that was visiting

Thousands protest against
Putin over election results


I

A barber cuts the 327-days-old beard of Radio personality Koen Fillet in Brussels yesterday. Fillet grew a protest beard
that was grown for almost a year to highlight the length of negotiation.
New Belgian government to
take offc after 541 days

Elio Di Rupo first
French-speaking
prime minister in
almost 40 years
BRUSSELS (AP) - King
Albert II named Elio Di Rupo
as the first French-speaking
prime minister in nearly 40
years late yesterday in one of
the final steps before his team
formally ends the record 541
days the country has gone
without a government.
The swearing-in today will
be a long-awaited relief to the
entire nation of 6.5 million
Dutch speakers and 4.5 million
French speakers who long ago
grew frustrated with the dead-
lock between politicians over
linguistic differences.

One radio presenter finally
shaved off the beard he has
grown for almost a year to
protest the drawn-out coali-
tion negotiations, an unofficial
world record.
"0 won't do it again, never
again," Koen Fillet said after
he was soaped, shaved and
splashed with after-shave in a
show webcast live.
A royal statement late yes-
terday said "the King received
Elio Di Rupo at Belvedere cas-
tle and named him prime min-
ister."
The 60-year-old son of Ital-
ian immigrants thus com-
pleted a remarkable journey
from childhood poverty to
become the Belgium leader.
He will lead a grand coalition
of Socialists, Christian Demo-
crats and Liberals, each split in
Dutch- and French-speaking

parties.
Among his leading minis-
ters, outgoing finance minis-
ter Francophone liberal Didier
Reynders became foreign min-
ister and Dutch-speaking
Christian Democrat Steven
Vanackere made the reverse
move.
Dutch-speaking socialist
Johan Vande Lanotte - experi-
enced in finance and budgetary
issues - was named economics
minister.
The final stretch to name the
ministers was drawn-out, in
keeping with entire process: An
all-night negotiating session
to decide which party would
claim what post ended yester-
day afternoon.
From now on, the govern-
ment has a lot of catching up to
do, especially when it comes to
the economy.

Protesters allege
election was rigged,
chant 'Russia
without Putin'
MOSCOW (AP) - Several thou-
sand people protested last night
against Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin and his party, which won
the largest share of a parliamen-
tary election that observers said
was rigged.
It was perhaps the largestoppo-
sition rally in years and ended with
police detainingsome of the activ-
ists. A group of several hundred
marched toward the Central Elec-
tions Commission near the Krem-
lin, but were stopped by riot police
and taken away in buses. The total
number of those detained was not
immediately available.
Estimates of the number of pro-
testers at the rally ranged from
5,000 to 10,000. They chanted
"Russia without Putin" and
accused his United Russia party of
stealing votes.
United Russia took about 50
percent of Sunday's vote, a result
that opposition politicians and
election monitors said was inflat-
ed because of ballot stuffing and
other vote fraud. It was a signifi-
cant drop from the last election,
when the party took 64 percent.
Pragmatically, the loss of seats
in parliament appears to mean
little; two of the three other par-
ties winning seats have been reli-
able supporters of government
legislation. But, it is a substantial
symbolic blow to a party that had
become virtually indistinguish-
able from the state itself.
It has also energized the oppo-

sition and poses a humbling chal-
lenge to the country's dominant
figure in his drive to return to the
presidency. Putin, who became
prime minister in 2008 because
of presidential term limits, will
run for a third term in March
and some opposition leaders saw
the parliamentary election as a
game-changer for what had been
presumed to be Putin's easy stroll
back to the Kremlin.
Also yesterday, more than 400
Communist supporters gathered
to express their indignation over
the election, which some called
the dirtiest in modern Russian
history. The Communist Party
finished second with about20 per-
cent of the vote.
"Even compared to the 2007
elections, violations by the author-
ities and the government bodies
that actually control the work of
all election organizations at all
levels, from local to central, were
so obvious and so brazen," said
Yevgeny Dorovin, a member of the
party's central committee.
Putin appeared subdued and
glum even as he insisted at a Cabi-
net meeting yesterday that the
result "gives United Russia the
possibility to work calmly and
smoothly."
Although the sharp decline for
United Russia could lead Putin
and the party to try to portray the
election as genuinely democratic,
the wide reports of violations
have undermined that attempt at
spin.
Boris Nemtsov, a prominent fig-
ure among Russia's beleaguered
liberal opposition, declared that
the vote spelled the end of Putin's
"honeymoon" with the nation and
predicted that his rule will soon
"collapse likea house of cards."

"He needs to hold an honest
presidential election and allow
opposition candidates to register
for the race, if he doesn't want
to be booed from Kamchatka to
Kaliningrad," Nemtsov said on
Ekho Moskvy radio.
Many Russians came to despise
United Russia, seeing it as the
engine of endemic corruption.
The election showed voters that
they have power despite what
election monitors called a dishon-
est count.
"Yesterday, it was proven by
these voters that not everything
was fixed, that the result really
matters," said Tiny Kox of the
Council of Europe's Parliamen-
tary Assembly, part of an interna-
tional election observer mission.
Other analysts suggested the
vote was a wake-up call to Putin
that he had lost touch with the
country. In the early period of his
presidency, Putin's appeal came
largely from his man-of-the-peo-
ple image: candid, decisive and
without ostentatious tastes.
But, he seemed to lose some
of the common touch, appearing
in well-staged but increasingly
preposterous heroic photo oppor-
tunities - hunting a whale with
a crossbow, fishing while bare-
chested, and purportedly dis-
covering ancient Greek artifacts
while scuba-diving. And Russians
grew angry at his apparent disre-
gard - and even encouragement
- of the country's corruption and
massive income gap.
"People want Putin to go back
to what he was in his first term
- decisive, dynamic, tough on oli-
garchs and sensitive to the agenda
formed by society," said Sergei
Markov, a prominent United Rus-
sia Duma member.

Cracking into classical

"We're waiting for Jimmy. He's always late."
Deep, soulful Roots

Hip-hop band
hardly 'undun' on
newest release
By ANDREW ECKHOUS
Daily Arts Writer
The Roots have inspired
intrigue among the hip-hop
and neo-soul congregations for
more than
two decades
through their
masterful use The Roots
of live music
- something undun
nearly extinct Def Jam
in rap - and the
gritty, realistic
scenes they've come to be known
for. On their latest album, undun,
these qualities are on display for
all to see, channeling the sorrow
and fight for survival that can
only be found in the U.S.'s under-
belly.
Telling the fictional story of
Redford Stephens, a repentant
drug dealer trapped in the hustle,
undun is a concept album evoca-
tive enough to transport any lis-
tener, whether from Compton or
Ann Arbor, into the hard-nosed
life of an inner-city pusher.
The Philadelphia-bred Roots
are the brainchild of Ahmir
"?uestlove" Thompson and Tariq
"Black Thought" Trotter. Though
there has been a revolving door
of members, the two founders
embody the bold creativity and
incisive commentary The Roots
are famous for. Never a group to
fall into tired rap "gangsters and
Glocks" tropes, they have made

a profitable and prolific career
without having to cater to the
lowest common denominator.
Rather, The Roots hang their hats
on intelligent songs that chron-
icle the all-too-real struggle
occurring everyday in inner cit-
ies across the U.S. and the world.
What makes the already-phe-
nomenal undun even more admi-
rable is the timeframe in which
The Roots created it. Over the
past two years, their visibility has
increased exponentially by play-
ing weekly shows in New York
City, being Jimmy Fallon's house
band and using their late night
platform to imply that Michele
Bachmann is a "lyin' ass bitch."
But instead of taking the easy
way out and cashing in on their
surging exposure, they remained
true to their roots (pun definitely
intended) and crafted a delicate
portrait of a desperate man on the
fringes of society.
What often gets lost when
discussing inner-city crime is
that criminals are not simply
statistics, but living, breathing
humans, and that's precisely
the message.the Roots somberly
convey in every track. Trac-
ing the life of the ill-fated Ste-
phens's drug pedaling career,
undun is unorthodox in that it
travels backward. The opening
instrumental track, "Dun," acts
as Stephens's death rattle and is
followed by "Sleep," a dying mes-
sage replete with haunting, music
box-esque instrumentals and
regretful lyrics.
The meat of the album is com-
prised of expansive, foreboding
gems that flow into each other
seamlessly, though the entire

timeline is backward. On "Make
My," Stephens sees the follies of
his ways, admitting, "they told
me the ends / won't justify the
means" over a funky, bass-driven
beat. He's the perfect example of
an antihero, at least in his own
eyes, as it seems he had no choice
but to plunder, pillage and kill
on the streets. Though the life
of Redford Stephens follows the
familiar murder-by-numbers
outline that anyone who has ever
watched "Boyz 'N the Hood"
knows by heart, The Roots are
able to puta human face on what
is usually nameless.
Curiously, the most fasci-
nating tracks on undun are the
last four, which are all instru-
mentals. Each one represents
a different aspect of Stephens's
pre-crime years, and with names
like "Possibility" and "Finality,"
the vagueness inspires reflection
and helps to humanize the out-
law world of drug dealing. There
is no glorification of violence or
vice here, just a reminder that at
one point, even the most ruthless
criminal had a soul.
. Redford Stephens's sorrow
is palpable and capable of mak-
ing listeners pray for the fic-
tional man's soul. Undoubtedly,
he made a host of bad choices
and his self-aware ruminations
about people he hurt may be
nothing more than a save-my-
soul deathbed conversion, but it's
hard not to feel for the guy. Even
more striking though, is that The
Roots are able to evoke such emo-
tion for a character whose life is
contained within a 40-minute
album. That is what makes undun
a transcendent rap album.

It's that time of year again
when I start chewing my
nails and stop caring about
what I look like when I leave
my room.
For me, the
gap between
Thanksgiving
break and our
winter siesta
is undoubt-
edly the worst
three weeks LAUREN
of the entire CASERTA
year, and Fall
2011 has cer-
tainly delivered.
It's one of those days that has
been scheduled down to the
hour. AsI curl myself into the
fetal position while perched on
my computer chair, I realize my
overworked brain needs a little
time to sit back and lose itself
before beginning the grind all
over again. I've been told that
Christmas is sometime in the
near future, so only the Kirov
Orchestra's rendition of Tchai-
kovsky's "The Nutcracker" will
do.
But heck, who am Ikidding?
Classical music is a subject I've
always tried to avoid bring-
ing up in my columns since
people tend to have entrenched
opinions regarding this often-
ridiculed art form. You either
already listen to it or avoid it
like the plague.
I understand. Classical music
gets a terrible rap nowadays, and
hearing about classical music
before you actually geta chance
to hear it ends up sabotaging the
process that allows a person to
truly appreciate the work of a
good composer.
And don't get me wrong
- some classical music is
downright boring for the aver-
age on-the-go student, and I
wouldn't expect much of a work-

Generations of explicit hip hop

'Lioness' legend lives on

By EDITH FREYER
Daily Arts Writer
This past July, lovers of poi-
gnant heart-and-soul blues
received the devastating news
that their
beloved pop ***
heroine, Amy
Winehouse, Amy
died from Winehouse
acciden-
tal alcohol Lioness: Hidden

permanent-
ly leaving Island
iTuneslibrar-
. ies and ears void of new music
from the troubled songstress.
Fast forward barely five
months, and Winehouse's foun-
dation has released a posthu-
mous album in her honor. Mark
Ronson and Salaam Remi,
Winehouse's longtime pro-
ducers, along with her family,
combed through hours of cut-
ting room floor audio and hand-
picked unreleased recordings
and alternate versions of her
popular tunes, culminating in
Lioness: Hidden Treasures. The
album fully spans her career,
with tracks ranging from 2002
to 2011. But while Lioness will
satisfy anyone's Winehouse
craving, it doesn't provide any
groundbreaking material.
On "Our Day Will Come,"
a cover of the 1963 original by
Ruby and the Romantics and
the album's opener, listeners are
immediately greeted with the
familiar brass-grazed groove
that has become Winehouse's
signature. It's an uplifting start,
as she confidently croons, "No

one can tell me / that I'm too
young to know / I love you so."
"Tears Dry," the original ver-
sion of one of Winehouse's big-
gest hits, "Tears Dry On Their
own," finds the familiar song
in a decidedly darker, more AMY
insightful direction. It takes her DUNs
to the more deeply sweeping, I A&JREs
less bouncy side of Motown, and
it's a welcome change.

It's the beginning of theholiday
season yet again, and withit comes
the slew of magical moments we
look forward to every year: Car-
bo-loading with sweet potatoes,
casseroles and assorted flavors
of pie. All day marathons of "The
Real Housewives of New Jersey"
and other Bravo reality favorites.
Never-ending hunts for the one
burned-outbulb keepinganentire
strand of Christmas lights from
glowing.
Oh, and getting flak from fami-
ly members when you're home for
winter break - especially about
your taste in music.
At least, that's what happens
at my house. Every time I play
hip hop in front of my older rela-
tives - be it when I'm washing
Thanksgiving dishes or cleaning
the house for a Christmas party
- theyuse it as an opportunity for
criticism, commenting on what
"kids listen to these days" and the
collapse of our culture's values.
It becomes a war between gen-
erations, and I struggle to defend
young people everywhere. After
years of enduring these battles,
I've heard it all: Every rapper is
sexist. The only thing rappers
care about is "getting hoes" and
money. Hip hop in general is more
shallow and offensive than it ever
was in the past.
It's usually a hopeless fight.
After all, it takes a lot of courage
to tell someone as lovable (and as
good at cooking) as my mom that
she's wrong. Still, not even the
loudest Waka Flocka Flame song
can quiet the argument brew-
ing in my head: Today's hip hop
doesn't suck any more than it did
when my parents were kids.
Let's face it - listening to rap in
the company of family members
is rarely a positive experience.
Adults just have an uncanny abil-
ity to drain this genre of its joy, as
they make it less about articula-
tion and rhythm and more about
the moral implications of Ludac-
ris's sex life. What parents over-
look, however, is how graphic

their music was, even when they
remember itbeing harmless.
Take, for instance, Sugarhill
Gang's "Rapper's Delight." Sure,
the late '70s gem is dressed up
with a barrage of "boogies" and
exclamatory "oh yeah!"s, but
it still contains the controver-
sial themes found in today's rap
music. ' The song thoroughly
covers the importance of hotel
parties, strategies for picking
up women and why the gang is
better than every other rapper
out there - for 14 entire min-
utes. Some of the lines are just
as shocking as your average Lil
Wayne single, as they boast about
having "super sperm" and sleep-
ing with their ladies' friends as
soon as they start "actin' up."
Arrogant? Check. Sexist?You bet.
But the obscenities don't stop
there - they just keep rolling
through the decades. Your mind
doesn't have to be wedged in a
gutter to pick up on the sexual
tones in the 1986 song "Push It,"
as Salt-N-Pepa supplies listeners
with enough breathy vocals and
"Ooh baby"s to nourish a late-
night Pay-Per-View purchase.
LL Cool J's "Big Ole Butt" is even
crasser - yes, the lyrics are as
literal as the title suggests. And
when was the last time you lis-
tened to N.W.A. without hearing
some sort of reference to domestic
or gang violence?
Even the rapper-turned-rever-
end Joseph Simmons's lyrics are

ROLLING STONE
N.W.A. went 'Straight Outta Compton' and straight into the suburbs.

far from pious: Run-DMC songs
like "Dumb Girl" quake with the
same sexual and misogynistic
undertones found in today's Top
40. The premise of the song is
simple, as the rappers viciously
condemn a girl for being too easy.
They call her a "stupid sex fiend
with no willpower" and criticize
her active nightlife - word on the
street is that she's "always sniffin'
or givin' somebody ablow."
'Parents
Just Don't
Understand.'
Sorry, Mom and Dad, but your
music just isn't appropriate to play
at the dinner table.
Don't be fooled by this super-
ficial boldness, though. I'd never
actually use this as ammo in argu-
ments with my parents, especially
with the month of presents and
free laundry service drawing
near. I've accepted the awkward
friction between our music as
something young people have
endured since the beginning of
time - or more specifically, since
Shaggy's "It Wasn't Me" first
played in our family's car on the
way to the Christmas tree lot 10
years ago. Now that's a holiday
memory worth forgetting.

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com

Dogsleds and hockey

I

FAIRBANKS -
W nning... you remem-
ber what that is, right?
It's the thingthathap-
pens when one team scores more
goals than the other.
Now, that's not to be confused
with losing, which is when your
team scores less. Anywho, that
first thing I was talking about
- the one
team with the
more goals
and whatnot.
Believe it or
not, that team
was Michigan
on Saturday.
I know, hard ZACH
to believe,
but trust me HELFAND
on this one, I
saw it.
In asyear, the Michiganhockey
team will leave the CCHA and
teams like Alaska Fairbanks for
better (and warmer) pastures.
The Daily trekked to Alaska this
weekend for what could be the
last time. Fellow writer Matt
Slovin and I saw the Northern
Lights, touched the Trans-Alaska
Pipeline and went snowshoeing
in Denali National Park.
It was all worth it to bring you
something rarer than a glimpse of
the Alaskan sun in wintertime: a
Michigan victory.
Plus, some locals taught us
a thing or two about hockey,
and they seemed to be speaking
directly about the Wolverines.
"It's all about findingthe right
chemistry," said a Fairbanks resi-
dent we met named John. "Some-
times one doesn't work on the
same line as another, so you have
to cycle them around until you
find the right combination."
OK, so John was our dogsled
guide, and he was talking about
the dogs pulling our sled. But
until he started mentioning
females in heat and neutered
males, we could've sworn he was
talking aboutthe line changes
Michigan coach Red Berensni
made in the middle of last series.
In fact, aslot of what John
had to say addressed Michigan's
problems during its seven-game
winless drought. A dog-sled team
is a lot like a hockey team, and the
marathon of a season is a gruel-
ing race like the Iditarod. Yeah,
those two comparisons mean you
should prepare yourself for an
extended metaphor longer than
winter in Fairbanks.
Michigan has its musher in
Berenson, the man giving the
commands and steering the
sled. Fifth-year goalie Shawn
Hunwick is the lead dog, and the

team will only go as far as he'll
take them. On Saturday, Hunwick
found himself ina duel with Alas-
ka's goaltender Scott Greenham,
who made 41 saves on the game.
But after a scoreless regulation
- Michigan's first since 2007 -
Greehman cracked first.
Hunwick said he saw Green-
ham sitting with 25 saves midway
through the second period and
knew that he would have to shut
out the Nanooks if Michigan
were to win.
"(Hunwick was) the bottom
line, and he earned that," Beren-
son said. "He was rock solid."
On our dogsled ride, we had
a few mistakes. Once, the dogs
veered off the trail and had to be
coaxed back onto the path. Most
of the dogs knew which way to go
and pulled inthat direction, but
the whole team had to be in sync
to get the sled going.
The Wolverines couldn't get
in sync during their own slide.
Twice, the defense surrendered
just two goals, only to have the
offense score one. Once, Michi-
gan poured in five, only to surren-
der six. They couldn't all pull in
the same d irection.
Another time on ourride,
Slovin fell off the sled while driv-
ing. If you aren't quick with a
command to slow the dogs, they'll
just take off and leave you behind.
Luckily for Slovin, John and I
remained on the sled and allowed
him to catch up. Our team stayed
together, despite Matt's embar-
rassing miscue.
On Saturday, freshman defend-
er Brennan Serville had his own
Slovin moment when he picked
up a boarding penalty at the
worst possible moment - with
2:06 remaining in the game.
The team didn't break apart.

Instead, it hunkered down and
thwarted the Nanooks' late flur-
ry. Again, Hunwick led the way,
turning aside several slap shots in
open space.
The defense earned some mea-
sure of redemption after strug-
gling mightily in the previous
four games. Michigan allowed 20
goals against duringthat four-
game span.
"Now it's 20 in five," Hunwick
said. "Which still doesn't sit too
good, but it was huge to get a
shutout on the road."
Maybe it's fitting that fresh-
man forward Alex Guptill scored
his game-winning goal with
the help of a lucky bounce off
an Alaska defenseman. For the
past few games, the Wolverines
have said that they've played well
enough to win, they just haven't
been gettingthe bounces.
Again, they played betterthan
the score showed on Saturday.
The offense generated 42 shots
on Greenham, and finally moved
the puck down low to get high-
quality scoring chances.
But Michigan will take the win
any way it can get it. A sweep in
Fairbanks, with Michigan State
and the Great Lakes Invitational
looming, could've spelled disas-
ter. Michigan did what it needed
to do. So what did we learn in
Alaska? We learned that nights
are long, that righting a wayward
sled team is difficult and that
sometimes you fall off.
As for the Michigan hockey
team, they relearned how to do
something Hunwick said they
were beginning to forget.
What's that word again?
Right, winning.

Aside from adding a couple of
freshmen, the Michigan men's
basketball team's bench is no dif-
ferent from last year. Yet, eight
games into the season, it's look-
ing like the players coming off of
it could be.
Junior guard Eso Akunne and
junior forward Blake McLimans
have been seeing increased min-
utes lately and they've made the
most of their time on the court.
Neither has missed a shot this
season, and they've given Michi-
gan coach John Beilein more
efficiency in their playing time
than last year's regulars - senior
guard Stu Douglass and junior
guard Matt Vogrich. Akunne and
McLimans are a combined 8-for-8
from the field, and Douglass and
Vogrich are shooting a combined
36 percent' from the field and 23
percent on 3-pointers.
Akunne has seen time in all but
two games and has sunk all five
of his shots, three of which have
been 3-pointers. In 12 minutes in
Michigan's 76-66 win over Iowa
State on Saturday, Akunne bur-
ied a 3-pointer after coming off a
ball screen and taking a handoff
from McLimans in the first half.
He later drained a jump shot with
five minutes remaining inthe sec-
ond half.
"His game has matured so
much from coming in from high
school as far as what's going on on
that floor," Beilein said. "He can
make shots.
"We have a tough time guard-
ing him (in practice). We say he

puts a guy into a blender, you
know, like a milkshake. He starts
shaking and baking and all of a
sudden he gets an open shot. He's
good."
McLimans was also effective in
his six minutes of play. After the
assist to Akunne, he scored on a
pick-and-roll layup from sopho-
more forward Tim Hardaway Jr.
and nailed a 3-pointer with 22
seconds left in the first half.
And in garbage time in a 70-58
loss to Virginia on Tuesday, McLi-
mans made a 3-pointer, pulled
down a rebound and blocked a
shot.
"I think Blake definitely gets
his confidence just from the way
he plays in practice," Akunne
said. "Blake is a really good shoot-
er. He's worked really hard and
we each believe in ourselves and
know that we can help the team
when we get in the game."
Akunne and McLimans are
traditionally on the "maize" team
in practice, which scrimmages
against the "blues," which consist
of starters. Beilein said that the
games are competitive everyday,
thanks in part to Akunne and
McLimans.
"If he's wide open, he's going
to knock it down," Hardaway Jr.
said of Akunne. "He kills us in
practice for the scout team. Him
working so hard since he's been
here to now and working on his
game all through the summer is
paying off right now."
Akunne is a versatile guard
and has spelled freshman point
guard Trey Burke, while also
seeing time as a 2-guard. He's
only turned the ball over once in

32 minutes.
"The first exhibition, I didn't
even (get in)," Akunne said. "But
I've always had the approach of
staying ready in case coach calls.
I just need to continue to gain his
trust and play solid when I'm out
there.
"This year I've matured a little
bit, being older, understanding
how important each possession
is. Being better on defense has
helped too."
McLimans can see minutes
at center like he did on Saturday
when he replaced redshirt soph-
omore Jordan Morgan, or on the
wing as he did on Tuesday.
"They'd have moments like
this (in the past), but there wasn't
consistency to it," Beilein said.
"Eso now has showed us con-
sistency where that's why he's
been coming off the bench every
game. Blake hasn't showed us the
same consistency, but I'd say his
last couple weeks have been very
strong."
What remains to be seen is if
Akunne and McLimans's strong
play in limited minutes is enough
to spell Douglass and Vogrich for
longer periods of time.
"A smart coach would do that,
I think," Beilein said.
NOTES: Sophomore center Jon
Horford has an injured foot and
is in a walking boot. He was held
scoreless in 10 minutes on Satur-
day.
"We're tryingto limit his min-
utes while he gets better," Beilein
said. "But he does have a little
stress in his one foot and we're
tryingto gauge that before we see
where he can go."

offer much sympathy for the Big Ten's best offensive line-

man could soon be named the
nation's top center.
Fifth-year senior David
Molk was named one of six
finalists for the Rimington
Trophy, which is awarded
annually to the best center. It's
the second-consecutive season
Molk has been named a finalist
for the award.
Van Bergen, Molk's room-
mate, thought the first-team
All-Big Ten center was worthy
of the distinction.
"Well you know Molk, he's
such a jabber-jaw that he's so
hard to keep contained," Van
Bergen said, tongue in cheek.
"That's all he does is run around
the house and tell me how he's
such a better (offensive) line-
man than me. And I tell him, 'I
don't even play (offensive) line.'
"No, I mean, I couldn't be
more happy for Dave Molk and
what he's accomplished. He
works so hard and is a tremen-
dous worker. As far as national
accolades go, the sky is the limit
for him. I know there is still the
Rimington to be announced
and I think he is the prime can-
didate for that. I mean, he is the
best center in the country -
hands down."
Molk will find out if he wins
during Thursday night's ESPN
College Football Awards show.
The winner will be deter-
mined by picking a consensus
first-team center from four
All-America teams - America
Football Coaches Association,

Walter Camp Foundation,
Sporting News and the Foot-
ball Writers Association of
America (FWAA).
If he wins, Molk would join
David Baas (2004) as the only
other Wolverine to have won
the Rimington.
HARDWARE FOR HOKE:
Bo Schemebechler is the only
Michigan coach to have won
the Eddie Robinson Coach of
the Year award - given to the
nation's best coach, as voted
on by the FWAA, in Division-I
football. In 1969, Schembechler
won it in his first season as the
Wolverines' coach.
On Monday, Hoke was named
one of the award's five finalists.
Schembechler (1969) and
Lloyd Carr (1997, 2006) were
the only Michigan coaches to
previously be named finalists.
The announcement came on
the heels of Hoke winning both
coach of the year awards in the
Big Ten, as voted by the coaches
and the media, last week.
Hoke's argument for the
award is strong. He guided
Michigan to a 10-win season
and a Sugar Bowl berth after
the tumultuous Rich Rodriguez
era came to an end in January.
But Hoke's competition is
stiff. The other finalists include
LSU's Les Miles, Kansas State's
Bill Snyder, Clemson's Dabo
Swinney and Oklahoma State's
Mike Gundy.
The winner will be
announced on Dec.15.
