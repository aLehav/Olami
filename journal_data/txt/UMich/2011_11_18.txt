STUDENT GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS FALL 2011

Boisterous cheers erupted
from members of the MForward
during their watch party last
night upon members hearing
that all eight of their candidates
had been elected representatives
in Michigan Student Assembly.
Of the 22 open seats in this
week's elections, eight were
filled by MForward, four by
independents and 10 by write-in
candidates, according to Rack-

ham and Law student Timothy
Bekkers, MSA election director.
LSA junior Sean Walser,
MForward chair, said the elec-
tion of all the party's candidates
is representative of the student
body's desire to see more ini-
tiatives that reflect students'
needs and desires. He noted
MForward's past successful
initiatives, including the imple-
mentation of Saturday night din-
ing in the residence halls and the
Open Housing Initiative, which
pushes for gender-neutral hous-
ing at the University.
"We see this as a great accom-
plishment ..." Wasler said.
"Students are supporting us
consistently in each election."
Ten of the 22 seats were for
Rackham Graduate School,

three for the College of Engi-
neering and one seat each for
LSA, School of Information,
School of Art & Design, Den-
tistry School, School of Medi-
cine, College of Pharmacy and
the School of Social Work. LSA
sophomore Lucy Zhao, a mem-
ber of MForward, was elected
to the one open seat on the Uni-
versity's Department of Public
Safety Oversight Committee.
Six students as well as write-in
candidates ran for the position.
Three schools - the School
of Natural Resources and the
Environment, Medical School
and School of Social Work -
failed to elect any representa-
tives in the March election.
Rackham Graduate School only
elected write-in candidates and

all 10 of Rackham's representa-
tives either resigned or were
removed for absences. Until two
weeks ago, not a single repre-
sentative had attended an MSA
meeting.
While two members of Rack-
ham student government have
attended the last two MSA meet-
ings, they were not on the ballot.
Rackham, which had vacancies
in all 10 of its representative
seats, only had one candidate on
the ballot last night - Patrick
O'Mahen, who is not affiliated
with MForward but is a mem-
ber of the Graduate Employees'
Organization.
O'Mahen, a former Michi-
gan Daily columnist, wrote in
an e-mail interview that he is

Regents criticize-
state plan to fund
higher education
By KAITLIN WILLIAMS
Daily Staff eporter
Several Univers y regents
raised questions abouthe Uni-
versity's long-term 'housing
strategy at their monthly meet-
ing yesterday.
The questioning came after
the regents unanimously
approved renovations to East
Quad and Baits II Residence
Halls. The Board of Regents also
tackled issues concerning the
state budget and addressed the
ongoing scandal at Pennsylvania
State University.
E. Royster Harper, the Uni-
versity's vice president for stu-
dent affairs, said at yesterday's
meeting that the East Quad and
Baits II projects aim to improve
student residential living stan-
dards on a short-term scale. But
Regent Andrea Fischer New-
man (R-Ann Arbor) said she'd
like University Housing to focus
more on the "bigger picture" of
improvements.
"As good of a job as we've
done, I think the North Quad
experience has had an impact on
all of us," said Newman, praising
the new residential-academic
complex.
Newman asked Harper how

University Housing will deal
with the decreased bed space
for students next year since East
Quad and Baits II will be out of
commission. Baits Iis also clos-
ing at the end of this academic
year due tosub-standard boilers
and fire safety system.
The East Quad and Baits II
renovations, both of which will
be completed in summer 2013,
could displace 150 to 300 return-
ing residents during the next
school year, according to Harper.
University President Mary
Sue Coleman said Northwood II
and Northwood III Apartments
will house for some displaced
students. Additionally, the
reopening of Alice Lloyd Resi-
dence Hall, which is closed this
year for renovations, will help
with the accommodation.
University Regent Laurence
Deitch (D-Bingham Farms)
said he disagrees with using the
Northwood apartments as space
for students since the space is
primarily meant for families.
"We need to focus on building
more facilities like North Quad,
or a public-private partnership,"
Deitch said.
Harper added that Univer-
sity Housing will come up with
a "master plan" for on-campus
housing by this spring and pres-
ent the first installment of it to
the regents soon.
University Housing's long-
term goals include improving

Israel strengthens strategic ties
with eastern African nations ,_

Plan is part of an
effort to combat
Islamic extremism
and terrorism
JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel
has identified eastern Africa as an
important strategic interest and
is stepping up ties with nations in
the region in a joint effort to con-
trol the spread of Islamic extrem-
ists, officials said yesterday.
In effect, Israel would become
a player siding with Christian-led
African nations in conflicts with
Muslim movements, a fault line
that has sharpened around the
continent in recent years. Israeli
moves come as the United States
as well has hiked up military sup-
port for African governments,

in large part to combat al-Qaida-
linked groups.
Israel's prime minister, Benja-
min Netanyahu, hosted the lead-
ers of Uganda and Kenya earlier
this week, following a meeting at
the United Nations in September
with the president of the newly
liberated South Sudan, the mainly
Christian and animist nation that
gained independence from Mus-
lim Arab-led Sudan in July.
The outcome of the meetings -
and the extent of Israel's moves to
ally with the Africans - remains
murky. Kenya's leader went so
far as to say Israel promised to
provide security assistance to his
country to help protect its borders
Israeli officials say such claims
are premature, but say an alliance
with Kenya and other eastern
African countries is natural.
"We have joint interests and we

believe that mutual cooperation
can be beneficial to us all," said
Israeli government spokesman
Mark Regev.
Uganda and Kenya have been
battling al-Shabab, a Somalia-
based group that is linked to the
al-Qaida terror network. At the
same time, there are growing
fears that Sudan and South Sudan
could return to war because of
lingering disputes.
Israel believes that al-Qaida
elements are now active in the
Gaza Strip and Egypt's Sinai Des-
ert - territories that both border
Israel's southern flank.
In Israel's eyes, eastern Afri-
ca poses a potential hinterland
where al-Qaida and other Islamic
militants could potentially forge
ties with similarly minded groups
just to the north in Egypt and
Gaza.

Idaho man charged with
Obama assasination attempt

Pakistani ambassador to U.S.
cornered in diplomatic controversy

jaz preoccupied with
possibility of military
coup in Pakistan
ISLAMABAD (AP) - The Pak-
istani government said yesterday
that it has not decided whether
to accept a resignation offer from
its ambassador to the U.S. over a
reported attempt to enlist Wash-
ington's help to rein in the coun-
try's military after the raid that
killed Osama bin Laden.
The governmenthassummoned
Ambassador Husain Haqqani to
Islamabad to question him about
any role he may have played in the
growing controversy, which was
first disclosed in an Oct.10 column
in the Financial Times, said Far-
hatullah Babar, a Pakistani presi-
dential spokesman.
Mansoor Ijaz, a U.S. citizen of
Pakistani origin, said in the col-
umn that a senior Pakistani dip-
lomat asked him on May 9 - a
week after U.S. commandos killed

bin Laden in a Pakistani garrison
town - to pass a message from
President Asif Ali Zardari to the
U.S. asking for help. Ijaz did not
name the diplomat.
Zardari was reportedly wor-
Tied that the U.S. raid had so
humiliated his government,
which did not know about it
beforehand, that the military may
stage a coup - something that
has happened repeatedly in Paki-
stan's history, said Ijaz.
The memo sent to Adm. Mike
Mullen, the top U.S. military offi-
cer at the time, reportedly offered
to curb support to Islamist mili-
tants from Pakistan's military
intelligence service, the ISI, in
exchange for American assis-
tance, Ijaz said.
The Pakistani Foreign Minis-
try has called the Financial Times
column "a total fabrication."
But Mullen's spokesman, Capt.
John Kirby, confirmed to Foreign
Policy's website Wednesday that
Mullen did receive the memo
from Ijaz, but he did not find it

credible and ignored it. "Adm.
Mullen had no recollection of the
memo and no relationship with
Mr. Ijaz," Kirby said.
Ijaz has a history of mak-
ing claims to be well-connected
with U.S. politicians. Under the
Clinton administration, he said
U.S. officials told him Sudan was
willing to turn over then-fugitive
Osama bin Laden, who was tak-
ing refuge there. Ijaz said Clinton
National Security Adviser Sandy
Berger refused the deal because
he was unwilling to do business
with Sudan - a claim derided by
Republicans that Berger immedi-
ately denied.
Haqqani said Thursday that he
did not write or deliver the memo,
but offered his resignation to end
the controversy.
"I do not want this non-issue
of an insignificant memo writ-
ten by a private individual and
not considered credible by its
lone recipient to undermine
democracy," Haqqani told The
Associated Press.

Authorities report
suspect had 'mental
health issues'
BOISE, Idaho (AP) - An Idaho
man accused of firing an assault
rifle at the White House believed
he was Jesus and thought Presi-
dent Barack Obama was the
Antichrist, according to court
documents and those who knew
him. At one point, he even sug-
gested to an acquaintance the
president was planningto implant
computer tracking chips into chil-
dren.
Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernan-
dez, 21, was charged yesterday
with attempting to assassinate
the president or his staff. He is
accused of firing nine rounds at
the White House last Friday night
- one of them cracking a window
of the first family's living quarters
- when Obama and the first lady
were away. If convicted, Ortega
faces up to life in prison.
Ortega was arrested Wednes-
day at a western Pennsylvania
hotel when a desk clerk there rec-
ognized him and called police.
Ortega's public defender,
Christopher Brown, declined
comment after his first court
hearing in Pennsylvania. Ortega's
mother has said he has no history

of mental illness, though when
authorities were looking for him,
they reported he had "mental
health issues."
In Idaho Falls, where Ortega is
from, a computer consultant told
The Associated Press that the two
met July 8 after Ortega asked for
help editing a 30-minute info-
mercial. Monte McCall said that
during the meeting at Ortega's
family's Mexican restaurant,
Ortega pulled out worn sheets of
yellow paper with handwritten
notes and started to talk about his
predictions that the world would
end in 2012.
"He said, 'Well, you know
the president is getting ready
to make an announcement that
they're going to put GPS chips in
all the children, so they're safe,"'
McCall said. "... And thenhe said,
'That's just what the Antichrist is
going to do to mark everybody."'
Kimberly Allen, the mother
of Ortega's former fiancee, said
he had been well-mannered
and kind in the four years she
had known him. But he recently
began making statements to her
daughter that were out of char-
acter, including that he believed
he was Jesus. Allen said the fam-
ily was worried when he went to
Utah recently, where he said he
had business, and didn't come
back. Ortega's family reported

him missing Oct. 31.
Allen said they were flabber-
gasted to hear he was wanted in
Washington.
"I believe that the boy needs
help," said Allen, of Shelley,
Idaho.
Her daughter, Jessica Gal-
braith, was engaged to Ortega
and is the mother of their 2-year-
old son. She declined to comment
yeseterday except to say: "I love
him, and I'm here for him."
It was unclear why or when
they split.
Reached by the AP on yester-
day, Ortega's mother said she
didn't have anything to say. She
earlier told the Post Register in
Idaho Falls her son has no his-
tory of mental illness.
"He has different ideas than
other people, just like everyone,
but he was perfectly fine the last
time I saw him," Maria Her-
nandez told the newspaper. "He
might be saying weird stuff that
sounds crazy, but that doesn't
mean (he) is crazy. He might be
confused and scared."
At his first appearance in
court in Pennsylvania, Ortega
sat quietly, his hands free but his
feet shackled. He said only, "Yes,
ma'am" when he was asked if
he understood that he would be
going back to Washington to face
the charge.

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
Obama appoints
Detroit judge to
federal bench
The White House says Presi-
dent Barack Obama has nominat-
ed Wayne County Circuit Judge
Gershwin Drain to a seat on U.S.
District Court in Detroit.
In a news release, Obama
describes Drain as someone who
will be a "thoughtful and diligent
judge" on the federal court. The
nomination requires U.S. Senate
confirmation.
Drain has been a Wayne Coun-
ty circuit judge since 1997. Before
that, he sat on the Detroit Record-
ers Court, which served the city
until it was merged with the
county circuit court. Drain was
a judge on Detroit's 36th District

EAST LANSING, Mich.
Survey: Job market
improving for
college graduates
A new survey says the job mar-
ket for upcoming college gradu-
ates has settled down and could
show slow but steady growth.
The report yesterday comes
from Michigan State University's
annual Recruiting Trends study.
The survey of more than 3,300
employers nationwide forecasts
hiring will increase by 4 percent
overall for students graduating
late this year or in the spring and
summer of 2012.
It would be an improve-
ment from last year, when many
employers were overly optimistic
with hiring forecasts only to cut
back on hiring later.
Hiring is expected to be strong
for engineering, computer sci-
ence, accounting, agriculture sci-
ences and agriculture business,
and some science major disci-
plines.
Hiring will vary by region of
the nation but should be stronger
in most areas. Job prospects will
vary by degree earned.
WASHINGTON
Inflation, prices
drop for United
States consumers
Consumers paid less for gas,
cars and computers last month,
as overall prices dropped for the
first time since June. Inflation is
easing after prices rose sharply
this spring.
The Labor Department says the
Consumer Price Index dropped
0.1 percent in October. It rose 0.3
percent the previous month. A
steep drop in gas prices led the
decline. Food prices rose, but at
the slowest pace this year.
Excluding volatile food and
energy costs, so-called "core"
prices rose 0.1 percent. The cost of

renting an apartment rose, as did
prices for health care products
and services.
But new car prices dropped
by the most in almost two years,
and airline fares and hotel costs
declined.
BEIJING
China wary about
* Obama's changing
foreign policy
While Beijing's public
response to President Barack
Obama's more muscular China
policy has been muted, behind
the scenes the U.S. president's
sudden moves to contest rising
Chinese power are setting the
capital on edge.
During his ongoing nine-day
swing through the Asia-Pacif-
ic region, Obama has already
unveiled a plan for an expanded
U.S. Marines presence in Aus-
tralia, advocated a new free-
trade area that leaves China out,
and called on Beijing not to buck
the current world order.
The Beijing government is
trying to understand the shift,
tasking academic experts to
review the initiatives and sub-
mit options on how to respond.

"MSA only can have a limited
impact for any students - we
don't have any direct control
over the vast majority of finan-
cial or policy decisions that
shape the broad direction of (the
University)," O'Mahen wrote.
"However, it can playa valuable

Board of Regents."
The' College of Pharmacy,

has a lot of resources, including
funding, advertising and con-
nections."

protection
Request for
protection is
earliest in history
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Herman Cain became the first
Republican presidential can-
didate yesterday to receive
Secret Service protection.
Cain asked for the secu-
rity and Homeland Security
Secretary Janet Napolitano
and congressional leaders
approved his request yester-
day, Secret Service spokes-
man Ed Donovan confirmed.
Elite agents were expected
to begin protecting the for-
mer pizza company executive
sometime yesterday.
There have been threats

against Cain, who had been
experiencing a bounce in the
polls, according to an offi-
cial with knowledge of the
situation who asked not to be
identified because of the sen-
sitive nature of the situation.
The nature of the threats was
unclear.
Donovan would not say
whether there had been any
threats or discuss why pro-
tection was being provided.
Cain's campaign had no
immediate comment.
Secret Service protection
is given to each major party's
presidential nominee, but
can be provided earlier if the
Department of Homeland
Security approves a cam-
paign's request.
When then-Sen. Barack
Obama was placed under
Secret Service protection in
May 2007, it was the earli-
est ever for a presidential
candidate. One of his rivals,
Hillary Rodham Clinton,
already had a protective
detail because she was a for-
mer first lady.

senting their school and making
a change," Sathi said.
The issues for last night's
election were varied depend-
ing on the school. For Rackham,
O'Mahen said the rights of Grad-
uate Students employed by the
Universitywere the mostimpor-
tant issue for him. Andrew Mod-
ell, a freshman in the College of
Engineering and a newly elected
representative, said instituting a
system for students to opt out of
mass e-mail lists was one of his
primary goals.
10 representatives elected to
LSA Student Governement
Ten representatives were
elected to LSA Student Govern-
ment yesterday, and despite a
drop in voter turnout from last
fall, LSA-SG officials said they
were pleased with the results.
Five candidates were elected
to LSA-SG for the first time, and
five others were re-elected to
serve another term. All the rep-
resentatives elected tonight will
serve through November 2012.
LSA freshmen Tyler Hoff-
man, Kendall Johnson, Chris
Graham, Elena Brennan and
Cindy Yu were each elected to
their first terms.
LSA sophomore Gaby Korn-
blau, LSA junior Brian Koziara,
LSA sophomore Gabby Trupp,
LSA junior Katharine Stock-
rahm and LSA junior Anna Wit-
tow were all re-elected..
Ten percent of the LSA stu-
dent body, or 1,652 students,
voted in the election - a 2-per-
cent drop from last year's fall
election. Jeff Larkin, LSA-SG
vice president and election
coordinator, said fewer stu-
dents voted because the MSA
didn't hold a full election, which
encourages students to vote in
their individual school student
governments as well.

Three proposals were also
on the LSA ballot. One proposal
asked students whether they'd
like to get e-mail notifications
when their grades are posted
on Wolverine Access at the end
of the semester - a feature cur-
rently not available. Larkin said
the grade notification proposal
passed by a "large margin."
Another proposal asked LSA
students where they'd like to see
water bottle refill stations added
across campus. A majority of
students voted that they'd like
to see stations in the Shapiro
Undergraduate Library and rec-
reational facilities.
Larkin said it was "no sur-
prise" that students chose
those locations to add water
bottle refilling stations. There
is already a station in the Intra-
mural Sports Building, so LSA-
SG will work to put the filling
stations in the Central Cam-
pus Recreation Building and
the North Campus Recreation
Building, Larkin said.
The third ballot proposal
asked students if they would be
in support of LSA students hav-
ing the option of having a minor
in the School of Art & Design.
Larkin said a majority of stu-
dents voted in support of adding
the minor.
LSA-SG President Anne
Laverty said she was "thrilled"
with the results of the election.
"Our voter turnout was
pretty close to what it was last
fall, which is great consider-
ing this is the first time MSA
hasn't had their full elections
and LSA has," Laverty said. "So
we're really happy with that and
obviously there's always room to
improve."

Republicans
dissatisfied with
spending measures
WASHINGTON (AP) - A
weekend government shutdown
that neither party wanted was
averted when Congress approved
a compromise spending bill
yesterday, as leaders overcame
major defections by Republicans
angry over what they considered
excessive spending. To the dis-
may of liberals, the measure also
blocks Obama administration
plans to impose stricter nutrition
standards on school lunches.
The Senate sent the measure
to President Barack Obama for
his signature on a 70-30 vote,
shortly after the House consent-
ed to the bill 298-121.
Though passage was by com-
fortable margins, the vote in
both chambers highlighted GOP
fissures over federal spending.
House Republicans backed the
legislation by just 133-101, while
GOP senators voted heavily
against the bipartisan bill, 30-17.
Many conservatives also were
unhappy that the bill poten-
tially would leave taxpayers on
the hook for even more spend-
ing because it would expand the
size of mortgages that could be
insured by the Federal Housing
Administration in wealthy areas
from $625,500 to $729,750.
"Some say, 'Oh, the tea party,
you shouldn't listen to them,
they were angry people,"' Sen.
Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., said. "Well,
I think they were deeply frus-
trated people and, yes, somewhat
angry. Why shouldn't they be?"
The votes occurred against
a backdrop of partisan gridlock
among members of Congress'
supercommittee, which has less

than a week to try agreeing to
a debt-reduction plan. Some
Republicans on that phnel have
been pushingto include some tax
increases as part of a deal, and
that has upset some Republicans
adamant against abandoning
the party's core stance against
boosting levies.
Democrats supported the
measure overwhelmingly, with
only 20 in the House and none
in the Senate voting "no." Liber-
als mocked a provision blocking
Obama administration efforts
to prod schools to put healthier
foods on their lunch menus,
including a proposal to no lon-
ger consider the tomato paste on
pizza to be a vegetable.
"What's next? Are Twinkies
going to be considered a veg-
etable?" said Rep. Jared Polis,
D-Colo., who voted against pas-
sage.
Despite the objections, pas-
sage was never in real doubt.
Both parties were eager to avoid
further tarnishing Congress'
ghastly public image, which took
a beating after partisan stand-
offs nearly caused a government
shutdown this past spring and a
federal default in the summer.
"It's a goodbill. It's not perfect
but it's alot better than the alter-
native," said Rep. Norm Dicks of
Washington, top Democrat on
the House Appropriations Com-
mittee.
The government's new fiscal
year started Oct.1 without enact-
ment of any yearlong spending
bills. A temporary measure that
has been financing federal agen-
cies expires after midnight Fri-
day.
The legislation would keep
the government's doors open
through Dec. 16, giving lawmak-
ers more time to catch up on
their tardy budget work.


Approximately 40percent of every incoming PhasimD class
consists of former LSA students.

Kick it into gear
University should implement bicycle program
Biking around campus could be much easier in the future.
TruMich - a student organization that supports the devel-
opment of alternatives to mass transit - is leading a campus-
wide petition to implement a bike share program at the University.
Many other cities and universities have started programs similar
to TruMich and have seen enormous success. The growing petition
has 652 signatures as of last night. The University should support
this project and fund a bike share program on campus.

The biology of race

The bike share program would include a
set of 100 bikes and multiple rental kiosks
around campus. Students could check out a
bike in one location and check it back in at
another. The program would eliminate the
need for students to bring their own bikes to
campus.
Bike share programs have become popular
throughout the United States. In July 2008,
Minneapolis created Nice Ride, a non-prof-
it organization that grants access to bikes
between April and November for residents
of Minneapolis. The program charges only
$5 for 24-hour access to bikes and $60 for a
one-year subscription. In Michigan, Oakland
University and Michigan State University
also have bike share programs and have had
only a few small problems with the program.
Having bikes readily available would help
students who are unable to bring cars, bikes
or mopeds from home. Bringing a bike to
campus is a hassle and a risk, since there is
the danger of damage and theft. It's extreme-
ly difficult for out-of-state students to bring
a bike to campus, and therefore, their only
other option is to buy a new bike when they
'arrive on campus. The implementation of a
bike share program would decrease the risks
and challenges for students wishing to ride

one around campus.
Putting a bike share program into action at
the University would be relatively inexpen-
sive and cost effective. A similar program at
Xavier University in Ohio spent $250,000 for
65 bikes and keycards to rent the bikes. The
University already provides keycards to stu-
dents, in the form of Mcards, and the cost of
just purchasing bikes would be minimal com-
pared to other expenses.
The University prides itself on being envi-
ronmentally friendly and sustainable. By
making bike travel easy and inexpensive for
students, staff and faculty, car and bus travel
would likely decrease, and even just taking
one bus off the road would help reduce the
University's carbon footprint. The Univer-
sity should be doing everything possible to be
environmentally friendly, and the bike share
program is another way to have a positive
impact on the environment.
A bike share program would highlight
the University's environmentally conscious
image, while simultaneously making life
easier for students. The petition is a great
way for students to voice their support for the
program. The University should respond to
students' wishes and implement a bike share
program on campus.

uring my freshman year,
I conducted a 10-question
survey to learn about the
transition to
college for the
average Univer-
sity freshman.f
o learned about
the varied aca-
demic experi-
ences of new
college studentsL
- those who LIBBY
felt well pre- ASHTON
pared by their
high schools and
those who didn't. I learned about the
social, sexual and intellectual inse-
curities and overconfidence of new
college students. But until I posed
my final question - which asked
students to summarize their transi-
tionto college in one phrase - to the
last student I surveyed, I had been
entirely ignorant to one of the most
crucial transitional experiences
occurring among my peer group.
My hallmate answered, "I became
aware of my blackness."
I don't think she meant that com-
ing to college made her suddenly
aware of some inherent quality of
"blackness" she possesses. Because
race, in a biological sense, doesn't
exist. But to suggest - like many of
those arguing against the Michigan
affirmative action policies up for
judicial debate next March - that
the non-existence of biological race
delegitimizes a response to race-
based inequality is to ignore the
very real impact of imagined social
divisions.
My hallmate matriculated to the
University from a Detroit public
high school in which she was among
the vast racial majority. At the Uni-
versity, she suddenly found herself
- her cultural background and her
woridview - on the margins of the
dominantly white University com-
munity. She didn't go on to make
statements about how this marginal

status prevented her from achieving
her academic or social pursuits -
though, perhaps, she could have. She
simply articulated what it felt like to
be - all of a sudden - different.
In order to engage in a poten-
tially productive discourse on race-
conscious affirmative action, the
social significance of race must be
commonly understood. Racialized
groups - that is, groups who have
been privileged or disadvantaged
on the basis of imagined intrinsic
character traits - are still in mea-
surably different social positions.
According to a National Center for
Education Statistics 2007 study,
the average black college gradu-
ate makes $15,000 less than the
average white college graduate.
And, according to the 2010 Cen-
sus, the poverty rate among black
Americans is double that of white
Americans. Without going into the
statistical details, this inequality is
pervasive in school performance,
job hiring and even life expectancy.
The civil rights movement of the
1960s did not effectively end racial
discrimination and inequality.
In discussing the constitution-
ality of affirmative action policies
for my law and philosophy course,
several students argued that such
policies should be color-blind but
give weight to the socioeconomic
status of an applicant. They consid-
ered income to be the only relevant
factor that seriously privileges or
disadvantages people. Our profes-
sor reinforced that the U.S. Supreme
Court upheld the legitimacy of
race-conscious affirmative action
policies because it saw a compelling
state interest in promoting diver-
sity and equality in every facet of
society - not because justices felt
compelled to help out a historically
disadvantaged group. To illustrate
the Supreme Court's point, my pro-
fessor told us that our discussion
section was her first - in 20-plus
years leading discussions - with-

out a single black student. She asked
us what we thought our discus-
sion lacked that all past discussions
didn't.

Affirmative
action is trying to
end racial divides.
Our nation's policy makers are
interested in pursuing a just society.
They recognize that, in order to live
in a society in which varied inter-
ests are honored, we must promote
diversity inthe most powerful social
and political echelons. Many claim
that affirmative action admissions
policies only perpetuate racial ste-
reotypes and divisions - some even
claim "reverse racism." They paral-
lel the rejection of white students
from universities because of their
skin color to the rejection of quali-
fied black students from universities
during the time of segregation. But
that argument overlooks intention
behind each case of rejection: One
sought to prevent equality on the
basis of prejudice while the other
seeks to promote equality in the
interest of the public good.
Policies that seek to promote
diversity and equality at the univer-
sity level may disappoint the self-
interested expectations of white
citizens who believe their qualifi-
cations will guarantee them a spot
at a university. But disappointment
doesn't constitute injustice. We
ought to fight for the responsibility
of the government to equally pro-
tect all of its citizens. And those who
believe that the system - as it stands
without affirmative action - is just
and equal are simply wrong.

Requiring co-pays to cover
birth control is essential
TO THE DAILY:
House Republicans are attacking a recent
decision by the United States Department of
Health and Human Services to require new
insurance plans to cover birth control with
no co-pays.
They are pushing to undermine this
preventive care provision by allowing
Catholic hospitals and schools to be
exempted, even though these organizations
employ and serve individuals of different
faiths and backgrounds. It would mean
millions of workers and their families would
lose access to affordable birth control, and
so would students at many faith-based
universities.
For college students like me who worry
about the cost of living and tuition, the HHS
decision is huge. For students and young
adults, every dollar counts. I am a male and
though I don't take birth control, most of
my friends - including my girlfriend - do. I
'U' should generate power
from exercise equipment

want to plan a family, but only after I have
graduated and have a good job.
I believe that using birth control is an
individual choice and an individual right.
The school a student attends or the employer
someone works for should not dictate wheth-
er or not someone has access to birth control.
The reality is that women of all faiths -
including Muslims, Christians, Jews and
yes, even Catholics - use birth control and
would benefit from access to birth control
with no co-pays. Ninety-nine percent of
sexually active women in the U.S. use birth
control at some point in their lives, including
98 percent of sexually active Catholic women
over age 18. Birth control is an essential part
of women's preventive health care.
It comes down to this: The HHS decision
will have a real and positive impact on
millions of people struggling to make ends
meet. All students should be able to benefit
from health care reform - even students at
religious institutions.

In the current immigration debate that is taking
place in the United States, many speak of "jobs that
Americans don't want to do." While this statement
can be argued back and forth over its accuracy that
is not my intention here. Rather, I would like to talk
about "places Americans don't want to live." How
many times have we turned on the news recently,
only to hear about how much of a wasteland Detroit
(or name any Rust Belt city) is and is likely to remain
for the foreseeable future? What if someone told you
they had a solution not only to the plight of the urban
Midwest, but also a partial solution to the immigration
problems facing this country? A partial solution, and
certainly a step in the right direction, would be to open
immigration quotas for select urban areas - allowing
immigrants to move there and establish communities
and businesses.
Consider the problem that many countries right now
are having of a "youth bulge," where large percentages
of the population are under age 40. This age group has
a very high unemployment rate and few job prospects
in their home country. Many would like to leave and
try their luck somewhere else, especially in a country,
like the United States. But, for better or worse, anyone
who wants to come to the U.S. at this point must be
highly educated and demonstrate an "economic ben-
efit" to the country or be considered a refugee. These
are basically the only two ways a person can legally
come to the U.S.
But this still leaves the issue of no American want-
ing to live in Detroit, and many foreigners wanting to
leave their home country. By allowing special immi-
gration quotas from certain countries to come to the
city of Detroit, both of these problems can be solved.
If immigrants moved strictly to Detroit, this would not
only serve to start repopulating the city and increase
the tax base, but would also create local businesses.
Now imagine if the city went further and allowed
these special quotas for about 20 countries. In an

abandoned neighborhood, suddenly you have a thriv-
ing community of Egyptians, who need businesses to
serve them. Also, by populating these neighborhoods,
you make them safer for those who already live there.
There are currently many abandoned houses inthe city
of Detroit, and instead of demolishing them, it would
be better to populate them. Instead of people from the
suburbs staying out of Detroit at all costs, suddenly
they will want to come in to experience the renewed
cultural vibrancy of the city.
There are certain difficulties with this. For one,
Detroit cannot set its own immigration policy, and the
city would have to get approval from the U.S. govern-
ment to do this. Another potential issue is either the
fear or reality that people would come to Detroit, and
then leave rapidly to go elsewhere. An obvious solu-
tion to this would be to make their visas valid for only
Detroit, and while people could leave to shop and work
elsewhere, they could only live in the city of Detroit.
There would be a sunset clause, say of 10 years, after
which people could apply for citizenship and move
elsewhere, but for the time, they could not move from
the city. Another fear many would also have is that the
city might have a high number of unemployed foreign-
ers who need social services. While this is a valid con-
cern, this can be solved by keeping the original number
of immigrants allowed to a fairly small number - giv-
ing the original arrivals time to develop a support
structure for those who come later.
As outlandish as this plan might sound, picture its
effects: 20 years from now, instead of a barren urban
wasteland, there are vibrant foreign communities in
the city of Detroit, and people from all over the world
are clamoring to live there. Instead of a lack of busi-
nesses and services, there is an abundance of commu-
nity spirit and cohesiveness, and community safety is
at an all-time high.

BAMN rallies for
affirmative action

Dan Nemser, an assistant professor of Spanish at the University, gives a speech in C.C. Little during a teach-in meeting
about the Occupy movement yesterday.
Members of local' Occu"py
groups hold teach-in meeting

Organization
encourages
students to get
involved
By CHELSEA HOEDL
For the Daily
With this year's rollercoaster
of rulings by the 6th Circuit
Court of Appeals regarding
Michigan's ban on affirma-
tive action, members of By Any
Means Necessary aren't sure
what to expect.
But in an effort to garner stu-
dent support for the organiza-
tion's cause - which includes
advocating for affirmative action
and other civil rights issues like
the fair treatment of immigrants
- BAMN members held a rally
on the Diag yesterday for their
Day ofAction to Defend Affirma-
tive Action.
Through the event, BAMN
hoped to get students involved
to influence the 6th Circuit
Court of Appeals decision to re-
evaluate Proposal 2 on Mar. 7.
Proposal 2, which Michigan vot-
ers approved in 2006, "prohibits
public institutions from using
affirmative action programs
and the. consideration of race in
college admissions and employ-

ment," the legislation states. The
6th Circuit Court of Appeals
ruled the state law unconstitu-
tional on July 1, 2011.
BAMN members circled
the Diag handing out flyers
and informing students of the
issue. Though some members
of BAMN said they are worried
about the re-evaluation of the
proposal, other members were
more optimistic.
BAMN member Joseph Sema-
na said the group frequently
travels to college campuses
across the country since college
students are affected by affirma-
tive action.
"Our main goal is to one, raise
awareness about affirmative
action, two, heat up this campus,
try and get a movement going
and show students that we must
fight," Semana said. "We must
build mass action in order to win
affirmative action. Law deci-
sions have never been based on
how good the arguments are or
else we wouldn't have had a cen-
tury of Jim Crow."
University alum Kate Stenvig,
an organizer for BAMN, agreed
that winning a case is not just
about having the best argument.
She referred to the 2003 U.S.
Supreme Court ruling in support
of affirmative action in Univer-
sity admissions.
"In order to win we need to

build a mass movement," Stenvig
said. "It's not going to be enough
to just make the best arguments
in court. In 2003, everyone told
us we were going to lose, but we
mobilized 50,000 people to the
Supreme Court, and we won."
Stenvig echoed Semana's sen-
timents, noting the importance
of student involvement at the
University.
"We have an opportunity
here at (the University) to lead
in restoring affirmative action
on this campus and across the
nation," Stenvig said. "The stu-
dents should be determining the
character of the University. We
need people who are prepared
to tell the truth about racism
and basically be leaders who are
prepared to inspire other people
and give a voice to the anger and
aspirations of millions of young
people."
LSA freshman Simon Mar-
golis, who was on the Diag
watching yesterday's rally, said
affirmative action is a good thing
for the country and campus and
stressed how affirmative action
can spur economic growth.
"I believe (affirmative action)
is an economic necessity because
there needs to be reinvestment
into the urban communities, and
I think the best way to do that
is to provide opportunities in
minority areas," Margolis said.

SPECTRUM
From Page 1
nee, '98 MT&D alum and one of
the concert producers, said he
believes the importance of this
event lies in making the center
more visible on campus.
."It's important for people at
this school to know about this
Spectrum Center because I
didn't," Creel told The Michigan
Daily. "There are alot of students
who come from a lot of small
towns, and they come to col-
lege and it's scary to be here. ... If
(they're) questioning sexual iden-
tity or sexual orientation or feeling
ostracized for being gay, they have
a safe haven here at the school."
The Spectrum Center was
the first office of its kind in the
nation. The event tonight is
commemorating its longstand-
ing impact, according to Will
Sherry, the center's assistant
director and a member of the
event's planning team. This
weekend's events are part of a
year-long anniversary celebra-
tion that kicked off in January
and coincided with the Universi-
ty hosting the Midwest Bisexual
Lesbian Gay Transgender Ally
College Conference for the first
time in February.
Creel sees a connection
between the LGBT and the

Broadway communities, which
he said is one of the reasons the
performers are so willingto come
back to celebrate the occasion.
"It's not just gay people - the
majority (of the Broadway com-
munity) is gay-friendly people
- people who believe in equality
and being treated with respect
and dignity," Creel said. "We
have a loving, amazing, passion-
ate, outspoken community and
it seems like a perfect fit for an
event like this."
The event will be filled with
talent: All the performers are
graduates of the musical the-
atre department, which is well-
respected nationally and around
the world, according to Creel.
The audience can expect not
only great performances by the
alumni, but also jazz ensemble
pieces and an awards ceremony.
According to Spectrum Cen-
ter director Jackie Simpson,
Jim Toy, who co-founded the
Spectrum Center, will be hon-
ored with an award, and former
Michigan Student Assembly
President Chris Armstrong will
announce a new scholarship his
family is starting for students -
like Armstrong - who have been
victims of bullying. Armstrong
was targeted last year by for-
mer Michigan assistant attorney
general Andrew Shirvell, who
claimed Armstrong was pro-

moting a "radical homosexual
agenda" through his position on
MSA.
Sherry said the MT&D alumni
volunteered to take on the task
of putting together "Broadway
Comes Home."
"We have a deep love for
Michigan and the Ann Arbor
community and the Broadway
community and gay communi-
ty," Creel said. "Other perform-
ers could have come in, but it's
about community and it's about
family. And we have that bond
because we had those four years
in the trenches learning how to
do what we're lucky enough to
do on Broadway in New York."
The performers are not only
looking forward to reuniting
with friends, taking the stage
once again in Ann Arbor and
touring the campus, but accord-
ing to Creel, they are also eager
to come back to eat French toast
at Angelo's.
The visiting alumni have a
packed weekend. In addition
to the concert, the Spectrum
Center plans to hold a current
student and alumni luncheon
today, PRIDE afterparty tonight
and "Rainbow" football tailgate
tomorrow. The Spectrum Center
is also premiering "8," a play by
Academy Award winner Dustin
Lance Black ("Milk"), tomorrow
night.

the commute to and from North
Campus and upgrading more
residence halls, Harper said.
The regents approved the
$116 million East Quad renova-
tion in July. The project plans to
rework the infrastructure of the
300,000 square-foot building.
The residence hall was erected
in 1940 and received additions in
1948 and 1969.
The Residential College has
called East Quad home since
1967, but Harper said the space
the RC occupies was never meant
for academic use. The renovation
will add class space and common
areas while maintaining bed-
room numbers. Approximately
860 students currently live in
East Quad.
Harper said the update of
Baits II on North Campus is
especially timely because of the
recent announcement of the
upcoming Baits I closure. The
Baits II project will cost about
$12 million and will include
improvements to the fire safety
system, windows, roofing, Inter-
net service and individual room
furniture. About 575 students
currently inhabit the 175,000
square-foot residence hall.
"We have been working hard to
enhance the vibrancy and appeal
on North Campus," Harper said.
COLEMAN'S BUDGET
LETTER APPROVED BY
REGENTS
The regents approved a letter
signed by Coleman and Univer-
sity Provost Philip Hanlon that

laid out the University's fund-
ing suggestions to State Bud-
get Director John Nixon. The
regents unanimously approved
the document, but a few board
members suggested editing the
letter to include stronger word-
ing before sending it.
Regent Martin Taylor (D-
Grosse Pointe Farms) said he
wants the letter to contain
stronger language concern-
ing the University's misgivings
about formula funding - which
determines allocations for state
universities based on standards
such as freshmen retention and
graduation rates.
"This business of trying to fit
it into a cookie-cutter kind of
approach to evaluate just seems
like a disturbing development to
me," Taylor said.
Cynthia Wilbanks, the Uni-
versity's vice president for gov-
ernment affairs, said officials
will re-draft the letter to make
the language stronger as per the
regents' request.
Coleman said though the Uni-
versity is "financially sound,"
formula funding may not be the
best method with which to go
forward.
"I don't know of any state that
has found some magic solution
wvith formula funding," Coleman
said.
Coleman said the University
is happy to have the opportuni-
ty to give the state constructive
input about funding. She added
that she is concerned about more
budget cuts and maintaining the
University's AAA rating - the
highest rating a university can
achieve - under the formula
funding model.
Hanlon said the letter address-

es the University's reservations
about formula funding and its
efforts to cut costs and generate
entrepreneurial activity.
Inthe letter, Coleman cited the
University's accomplishments in
pioneering research and keeping
costs down during a 30-percent
decrease in state funding over
the last decade. She wrote that
the state needs to evaluate the
University by another means and
not compare it to other state uni-
versities if the state is to allocate
a sufficient amount of funding in
upcoming fiscal years.

REGENTS SUPPORT
COLEMAN'S STATEMENT
ABOUT PENN STATE Italian government passes

Regent Denise Ilitch (D-Bing-
ham Farms) read a statement on
behalf of the regents, urging the
University community to learn
from the scandal at Penn State.
"The regents whole-heartedly
support President Coleman's
recent statement regarding Penn
State," Ilitch read. "Over the
coming months, we intend to use
this tragic situation as a catalyst
for thoughtful re-examination of
our institutional values, our cul-
ture and our community."
Coleman sent an e-mail to all
students, faculty and staff mem-
bers Tuesday afternoon, advis-
ing the University community
to act if an abuse or a crime were
brought to their attention.
Former Penn State football
coach Joe Paterno and Penn
State President Graham Spanier
were fired last week after devel-
opments in an investigation of
former Penn State defensive
coordinator Jerry Sandusky's
alleged sexual abuse of boys.

Mario Monti under
pressure to boost
growth, curb debt
ROME (AP) - Against the
backdrop of anti-austerity
protesters clashing with riot
police, Italy's new premier
appealed to Italians to accept
sacrifices to save their country
from bankruptcy, but pledged
economic growth and greater
social cohesion in return.
Mario Monti is under enor-
mous pressure to boost growth
and bring down Italy's high
debt, not only to save Italy
from succumbing to the debt
crisis but to prevent a cata-
strophic disintegration of the
common euro currency.
"Europe is experiencing the
most difficult days since the
end of the Second World War,"
Monti told parliament in his
debut address yesterday. "Let's
not fool ourselves, honored
senators, that the European
project can survive if the mon-
etary union fails."

Monti pledged to reform the
pension system, re-impose a
tax on first homes annulled
by Silvio Berlusconi's gov-
ernment, fight tax evasion,
streamline civil court pro-
ceedings, get more women and
youth into the work force, and
- in a move aimed at setting an
example for ordinary Italians
- cutting political costs.
The government will decide
"in the coming weeks" what
new austerity measures are
needed, Monti said.
The 68-year-old econo-
mist and university president
described three pillars of his
strategy: Budgetary rigor, eco-
nomic growth and social fair-
ness.
"This government recogniz-
es that it was born to confront
a serious emergency in a con-
structive and united spirit,"
Monti said, calling it "a gov-
ernment of national commit-
ment."
He was interrupted 17 times
by applause. But outside,
Rome's historic center was
paralyzed by student protests

and in the financial capital of
Milan, riot police struggled to
stop protesters trying to reach
the Bocconi University over
which he presides, signaling
the depth of the resistance the
new leader will have to con-
front.
Monti's one-day-old govern-
ment won a vote of confidence
281-25 in the Senate later yes-
terday, ahead of a vote in the
lower house today, on his gov-
ernment of experts, including
fellow professors, bankers and
business executives. He was
chosen to lead after Italy's spi-
raling financial crisis brought
down media mogul Berlusco-
ni's 3 1/2 year-old government.
Europe has already bailed
out three small countries -
Greece, Ireland and Portugal
- but the Italian economy, the
third-largest in the 17-nation
eurozone, is too big for Europe
to rescue. Borrowing costs on
10-year Italian bonds spiked
briefly over 7 percent yester-
day - a level that forced those
other countries into bailouts
- before closing at 6.81 percent.

Different year, same issues
for the seventh-ranked Wolver-

"After you get swept, that's a

defenseman Mac Bennett. "You

win a CCHA championship if
you are getting swept. It's some-
thing that is going to jump-start

No. 14 Ohio State (5-2-1, 8-3-

Daily Sports Writer
Kellen Russell says the No. 7
Michigan wrestling team has
one thing on its mind each week-
end: to dominate its opponents.
"We are looking to improve
this weekend and continue on
our path to dominating our
opponents," the fifth-year senior
Russell said. "Hopefully every
weekend from here on out we
can continue to elevate our per-
formances."
The Wolverines made their
presence known at last week's
Michigan State Open Invitation-
al, where four wrestlers were
crowned individual champions.
Redshirt seniors Kellen Russell
and Justin Zeerip, redshirtsoph-
omore Dan Yates, and freshman
Justin Dozier all claimed the
titles for their respective weight
classes.
"We had a really good week-
end," Russell said. "It was really
good to see our guys fighting
hard in every match."
Michigan will look to con-
tinue their dominance this
weekend as they start their dual-
match season as it travels to Buf-
falo and Pittsburgh to take on
the Bulls and the Panthers.
Russell, who ended last sea-
son with a perfect 38-0 record
and a national title for the 141-
pound weight class, has begun
this season with a 5-0 record.
Even though he has the second-
longest streak of 43 consecu-
tive wins, he is still looking to
improve this season.
"There are some things I still
need to work on," Russell said."I
want to attack more on my feet
and score more points against
my opponents."
Russell was Michigan coach
Joe McFarland's fourth wrestler
so far to win an individual NCAA.

title in his 13 years of coaching at
Michigan. He has also guided
his team to three Big Ten cham-
pionship titles. Looking to add
another one to his resume this
year, McFarland has added three
new coaches to the staff: Sean
Bormet, Donny Pritzlaff and
Kyle Massey.
Bormet is a Michigan alum
who was a two time NCAA All-
American and Big Ten Con-
ference Champion during his
wrestling career (1991-94). He
brings in international experi-
ence as he was a coach for the
2008 Olympics and the last three
World Championships.
Pritzlaff adds to the interna-
tional experience of the coach-
ing staff. He won a bronze medal
at the 2006 World Champion-
ship and has spent the last five
years coaching at the University
of Wisconsin, where he helped
lead the team to a 4th place at
the 2010 NCAA Tournament.
Massey also comes from Wis-
consin and will serve as the vol-
unteer coach.
"The new coaches have added
a whole new culture to the pro-
gram," Zeerip said. "They real-
ly pay attention to detail and
elevate training to a whole new
level."
With the new additions to the
coaching staff and a strong class
of talent, the Wolverines will
look to make a statement this
year. Zeerip and Russell agree
that they would like to help the
program win a Big Ten cham-
pionship team title and send as
many team members as possible
to the NCAA Tournament.
The next step is on the road
this weekend against Buffalo
and Pittsburgh.
"We plan to wrestle hard
and dominate," Zeerip said.
"It's gonna be a battle, but we
are looking for two victories."

the past weekend, is Michigan.
"It's not just the other team,
it's our team too," Berenson
said. "We have to play better on
the special teams. Our numbers
aren't at the level we need them
to be at."
Special teams have been an
issue for the Wolverines all sea-
son, as both the penalty kill and
the power play have been incon-
sistent.
The penalty kill in particular
will be vital for Michigan this
weekend because Ohio State
capitalizes on man-up opportu-
nities better than most.
A big part of the Wolverines'
inconsistency on the penalty kill
is because of the unit's inexperi-
ence.
Michigan is trying to replace
five seniors that were regular
contributors on the unit, which
isn't easy to do with eight fresh-

men.
"We are getting better, but we
are still working guys into the
penalty kill too," Berenson said.
"We are moving guys in, but I
think we are getting better."
The other big takeaway from
last weekend was Michigan's
continued Friday night strug-
gles. The Wolverines have had
similar issues in the past, but
those problems were'due in part
to a rotating goalie situation.
This season, senior goalten-
der Shawn Hunwick has sole
possession of the job, so the
Wolverines have to look other
places to answer the Friday
night questions.
Michigan has the talent and
conditioning to run with any-
one, but sometimes the issue can
be harder to quantify.
"I think it's just being men-
tally strong," Bennett said. "It's

guys showing up being ready to
play. Our team likes to have fun,
but we also have to be serious
come game time. We have to do
that a little bit better."
Though it is only November,
this weekend's series is crucial
for the Wolverines. After earn-
ing just one point out of six last
weekend, Michigan needs to
rebound against the Buckeyes to
get back to the top of the CCHA
standings.
And they know things are not
going to get easier.
"The great thing about the
CCHA is that no matter who
you play, everyone is out to
beat Michigan," Bennett said.
"That's the beauty of Michigan,
knowing that you have to bring
your 'A' game every night."
If the pattern against the
Buckeyes repeats, Michigan has
nothing to worry about.

Morgan shines, rest of post
play continues to be erratic

Sophomore forward Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 12 of his 16 points in the second half against Western Illinois.
Blue barely escapes
Western Illinois scare

By NEAL ROTHSCHILD
Daily SportsEditor
Once the No. 17 Michigan
basketball team figured out
that knocking down foul shots
was easier
than mak- W. ILLINOIS 55
ing 3-point MICHIGAN 59
shots, it
was able to overcome a pesky
Western Illinois and salvage a
59-55 win.
The Wolverines (3-0)
launched 12 3-pointers in the
first half and went into the break
tied 28-28.
But in the second half, Michi-
gan started to get into the paint
and the Fighting Leathernecks
could do nothing but foul for
much of the half. Western Illi-
nois put Michigan in the 1-and-
1 bonus with 13:14 remaining in
the period and the Wolverines
took advantage. Sophomore for-
ward Tim Hardaway Jr. attacked
the rim and tallied 12 of his team-
high 16 points in the second half.
"We got them in foul trouble
early," said senior guard Zack
Novak. "And then we figured
we'd just keep going at them,
attacking them, we'll get on the
line and good things will hap-
pen."
But Michigan could not get
Western Illinois out of its hair.
The Leathernecks (0-2) made
timely shots and never let the
Wolverines' lead see double dig-
its.

Guard Ceola Clark tormented
Michigan all game and finished
with 22 points. Clark was out
last season with a toe injury
and missed the Leathernecks
first game this season. But his
presence, along with Western
Illinois' 48.8-percent shooting,
keyed the upset threat.
"Clark just controlled the
pace of that game," said Michi-
gan coach John Beilein. "And we
played hard, but we did not make
shots and we had some times that
we really had some blunders."
With three minutes remaining
in the game, Leatherneck for-
ward Obi Emegano made a jump
shot, drew a foul, but missed the
free throw to keep the deficit
at 51-46. Michigan came right
down the floor, Hardaway put
in a bank shot from the left side
of the basket and the Wolverines
held off the Leathernecks the
rest of the way.
"We're leaving early in the
morning (for Maui), it's the
third of a back-to-back-to-back,
the team came in, they shot the
lights out," Novak said. "That's a
recipe for an upset but we Wer
tough and stayed with it."
When the Wolverines pen-
etrated in the second half, they
were able to get a combination of
points in the paint, free throws
and kick-outs for jump shots to
keep Western Illinois off the
lead. They scored 14 points in the
paint and made 9-of-14 foul shots
in the frame. Redshirt sopho-

more center Jordan Morgan
gave Michigan its best low-post
game of the year, finishing with
11 points on 5-for-5 shooting and
five rebounds.
Freshman point guard Trey
Burke had the hot hand early on,
draining his first three 3-point-
ers, but Western Illinois was
also knocking down its shots.
Michigan struggled to stop the
Leatherneck shooters, who went
6-for-9 on 3-pointers in the first
half.
Though the Wolverines took
advantage of Western Illinois'
carelessness with the ball and
forced 20 turnovers, they only
got 2 points off of them. Michi-
gan drew fouls, took the ball
from the Leathernecks and saw
strong post play from Morgan,
yet still was unable to notch a
convincing win.
Michigan's offense has strug-
gled in the early going, failing to
top 64 points in its easy early-
season schedule. The compe-
tition will heighten when the
Wolverines head to Hawaii for
the Maui Invitational next week.
No. 10 Memphis will be their
first test on Monday.
"We are trying to put together
a team, but we have a different
experience factor than we had
last year at the end of the year,"
Beilein said. "We just got to get
integrated, but if we don't shoot
the ball well we've never been
very good. We've got to do simple
things like that."

Daily Sports Writer
Usually when a player or team
is described as magical, it's a
good thing.
But not when there appears
to be a magician turning Michi-
gan's post players into disappear-
ing acts.
Redshirt sophomore forward
Jordan Morgan has been up and
down. Sophomore forward Evan
Smotrycz's first two games sug-
gested he'd turned a corner, until
playing one of his worst games as
a Wolverine in Thursday's win
over Western Illinois, 59-55.
And then there's sophomore
Jon Horford, whose invisibility
continued Thursday. Horford,
whoenteredtheseasonas astart-
er, was pulled from the starting
lineup and came off the bench to
play just six minutes against the
Fighting Leathernecks.
Coming off an offseason that
saw him gain more than 30
pounds, Horford was expected
to be Michigan's go-to post play-
er. But Horford has scored just
six points in three games. Michi-
gan coach John Beilein blames it
on his lack of experience.
In his limited minutes against
Western Illinois, Horford didn't
attempt a field goal - the second
time in three games - and was
held without a rebound.
"He's just trying to work right
now and he's going through some
of the growing pains," Beilein
said. "Gettingoutthere and play-
ing smart and hard with all these
things happeningin front of him,
defensively, that's the big issue.
All these things are happening in
front of him."
Morgan, whose playing time
has increased because of Hor-
ford's absence, put together his
best performance of the young
season. He scored 11points while
making all five of his field-goal
attemps.
"That was a big step for him,"
Beilein said. "I've just seen these
last 10 days, these glimpses of
what we saw last year several
times. You've just got to keep
working on it. (Last night, we)
were going to try to do - if he got
off to a good start, to give him a
few more minutes and I thought
he responded well."
After coming off the bench
in the season opener, Morgan
has started the last two games.

While Morgan's play was domi-
nant at times last year, most of
his points came off the pick-and-
roll from former guard Darius
Morris.
This season, the Wolverines
are breaking in a freshman point
guard, Trey Burke, and Morgan
reiterated that the expectations
for the big men must be relaxed
in the early going.
"I would kind of say we're still
feeling out the offense - seeing
where we can improve," Morgan
said. "This is the third game, you
know, I wouldn't say our pick-
and-roll was a serious threat (in)
the third game last year.
"I knew I would get opportu-
nities."
With Michigan leading by just
three points five minutes into the
second half, Morgan flashed his
ability to take over agame.
He cut into the paint, sealed
his opponent and presented
senior guard Zack Novak with a
wide-open passing lane, which
Morgan finished with an easy
layup. Moments later, Morgan
blocked a would-be dunk, ignit-
ingthe crowd.
But he didn't stop there: He
hustled up the floor, beating his
man, and scored another open
layup to put the Wolverines up

seven. That set the tone for the
rest of the half.
"It was just kind of the energy
we needed at that point," Mor-
gan said. "The opportunity pre-
sented itself and we kind of just
capitalized on it. That comes
with practicing everyday hard
and being ready for that kind of
stuff when the time comes in the
game,"
Meanwhile, Smotrycz missed
his first four shots and was held
to just three points off 1-for-8
shooting. After back-to-back
double-digit scoring games,
Smotrycz went cold while again
finding himself in foul trouble.
The Wolverines have survived
the inconsistent post play against
weaker opponents like Western
Illinois early on, but come Mon-
day in Maui against No.10 Mem-
phis, the big men need to find a
way to flash their magic.
"Step up?" Morgan asked. "I
think no matter what the situa-
tion is, it's important to give the
best effort that you have, regard-
less of what you're teammates
are doing.
"Whether you're playing,
starting, orcomingoffthebench,
it kind of gets blown out of pro-
portion - it's not really impor-
tant."


Lane penetration, defense propel Blue

Thompson expands her
game, plays aggressively

By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Writer
As deemed by Michigan
women's basketball coach Kevin
Borseth, Thursday night was a
"slugfest." UTAH 50
Michi- MICHIGAN 55
gan (3-0)
shot just
33 percent from the field and 14
percent from behind the arc but
squeaked out a 55-50 win over
Utah (2-1).
In the first half, the Wolver-
ines came out flat. Michigan
missed layups and went 1-for-11
on 3-point attempts. Michigan
fed the ball into the paint to try
to get the offense rolling, but
shots just weren't falling. Junior
center Rachel Sheffer and senior
forward Carmen Reynolds com-
bined for 5-for-21 from the floor,
which stalled the post play for
the Wolverines.
The biggest struggle for Mich-
igan was overcoming Utah's
height. Three of the Utes' five
starters stood at 6-foot-4, and
Michigan had a hard time adjust-
ing to their size and physicality in
the paint. Utah put up 32 points
in the paint and outrebounded
Michigan 42-31, resulting in 10
second-chance points.
"We had a tough time," Bors-
eth said. "Our post players
couldn't score on that block. It
was extremely physical down
inside there, and we knew that
coming in."
Michigan countered Utah's
height advantage by consistent-
ly driving into the lane. Junior
guard Nya Jordan and senior
guard Courtney Boylan were
both successful penetrating into
the lane, relieving pressure on
Reynolds and Sheffer.
After strugglin offensively all

low.
"Coach told us to go at them,
to go into the paint because Nya
and Courtney are very explo-
sive," Thompson said. "They did
a great job, Courtney is so crafty
in there - she can finish it going
to the rim."
The penetration from the
guards earned the Wolverines
numerous trips to the free throw
line, which was a key factor in
the game.
Michigan was perfect from
the charity stripe deep into the
second half, and ended up 16-for-
19.
The Wolverines shot most of
their free throws in the bonus,
and Thompson and Boylan con-
verted key free throws down
the stretch to secure the win.
Since Michigan couldn't con-
vert their shots down low, Bors-
eth said their game plan in the
second half was to penetrate
and draw fouls since the Wol-
verines were hitting their free
throws.
"Rebounds and free throws
win games, especially in the
last three minutes of the game,"
Borseth said.
"We tried to get to the free-
throw line."
Though Michigan's record is
better than it was at this time
last year (1-2 overall), there still
are things to work on.
The Wolverines have his-
torically struggled scoring in
the paint, but they have shown
improvement this season. Reyn-
olds believes the team can do
better.
"We need to make shots and
continue to get the ball in the
paint," Reynolds said. "We do
want to continue getting in the
paint by penetration or by pass-
ing it in and posting it up."

By MATT SPELICH
Daily Sports Writer
Junior guard Kate Thompson
came offthe bench at the 10-min-
ute mark to give senior guard
Carmen Reynolds a break in the
game against Utah on Thursday
night. The jumper Thompson
hit early on looked like her usual
one-and-done move of the night.
Within seconds, Michigan coach
Kevin Borseth motioned to a
well-rested Reynolds to check in
at the scorer's table.
The next moment Thompson
- the 6-foot-4 lanky standstill
shooter - took a hard dribble
left, got her defender off balance
and then spun right to draw the
foul at the basket. The ball left
her hands, rattled around the
rim and dropped threw the bot-
tom of the net - the crowd went
nuts. Borseth called Reynolds
back to the bench.
Thompson never looked back.
Showing off her newfound
confidence driving to the rim,
Thompson earned herself four
layups, two three-point plays,
and six free-throws for a game
high of 17 points and a victory
over the Utes. Her performance
was the culmination of hours of
hard work, trying to step out of
her confined role.
"I'm not the quickest player
on the team," Thompson said.
"But in practice I work really
hard on driving into the lane.
Tonight, (Utah) really keyed on
Carmen and our other shoot-
ers, and that really opened up
the lane for me. I've been work-
ing hard with (associate head)
coach Dawn (Plitzuweit) outside
of practice for when my time
J

comes. Tonight it came."
Though Thompson's field
goals and free throws were
effective in putting the Wolver-
ines ahead, her 3-point percent-
age was less-than desirable.
Thompson went 1-for-5
beyond the arc, but she was not
alone. Senior guard Carmen
Reynolds went 1-for-7 and junior
center Rachel Sheffer went
0-for-4. Michigan finished 3-of-
22 from 3-point range.
"It's rough when the three's
aren't falling," Reynolds said.
"It says a lot for us to shoot that
poorly and still be able to beat
a good team like (Utah). Just
imagine what it's going to be
like when we start hitting those.
When your outside shots aren't
falling you have to get it inside,
be aggressive and get to the free-
throw line. I think we did that
very well this game."
Another key to the game was
free throws. Michigan earned
16 points off of fouls and shot an
impressive 84.2 percent from the
charity stripe. Senior Courtney
Boylan had the second most free
throws behind Thompson - she
nailed 5-of-6. In truth, Utah's
wall-like post defenders gave the
Wolverines few scoring options
aside from drawing fouls. Luck-
ily for Borseth, his team found a
way to capitalize. The Wolver-
ines needed those 16 points.
"Rebounds and free throws
win games," Boseth said. "This
was especially true in the last
three minutes of this game. We
hit a couple of free throws down
the stretch that kept us going,
especially when (Utah) started
hitting threes to try to get back
in the game."

Junior forward Kate Thompson led Michigan with 17 points in last night's win.

night, the Wolverines attributed
the win to their solid defensive
effort, forcing 18 turnovers and
pressuring Utah into missing 12
of 15 shots from downtown.
Michigan's speed and quick-
ness ignited its defense. Reynolds
noted that the team's strategy
was to speed up the game to
gain an advantage over Utah's
forwards - and it worked well.
Junior guard Jenny Ryan led
the team with five steals, which
came from strong man-to-man
defense and pressure on Utah's
guards. In the second half, Ryan
helped convert back-to-back
steals into layups to give Michi-
gan some breaching room.

"We played extremely well
defensively," Borseth said. "I
thought we had a great game
defensively. We obviously didn't
shoot very well, but we beat a
very good team."
Though shots weren't falling
for the Wolverines, junior for-
ward Kate Thompson had a stel-
lar night.
She led the team with 17 points
through numerous drives to the
basket, and Reynolds and Boylan
also broke double digits with 12
points and 11 points, respectively.
Though Michigan's post was
inefficient, the penetration by
Boylan and Jordan was success-
ful in sparking the offense down

This year's show,
'Rivaayat,' explores
Indian heritage
By VERONICA MENALDI
DailyArts Writer
Every year the Indian Ameri-
can Student Association (IASA)
puts together a dance show to
represent dif-
ferent facets of Riaayat
Indian identity.
After rehears- Tonight at

r planning for Hill Auditorium
F eight months, From$16
this year's
show, titled "Rivaayat" ("redis-
covering our roots" in Hindi),
" will take place tonight at 7 p.m. in
Hill Auditorium.
IASA has been putting on its
annualshow for 25years. Typical-
f ly the IASA show has around 240
participants - its co-ordinaters
say it is the largest student-run
production in the country - and
roughly 4,000 people attend the
performance. The show sells
out every year, according to LSA
senior Ayesha Singh, who is one of
the show's "core members" - the
individuals in charge of organiz-
ing the event.
The format is consistent:
Each year nine or 10 dances are
featured from all over India.

However, the choreography,
costumes and music vary in each
performance.
LSA senior and show core
member Surya Sambandan said
this combination of dances is
captivating since not many peo-
ple realize that even though India
is one country, there is a variety
of subcultures each with its own
style, particularly in dance.
"It's not onlyan entertainment
thing," Sambandan said. "We like
to educate our audience about the
Indian culture and its diversity.
It has specific costumes, it has
specific music, all characteristics
of that style and that culture."
Since she was born and raised
in the Ann Arbor area, Samban-
dan has known about the IASA
show for years. This year she
decided to become more involved.
"This year I was just really
ambitious and I wanted to put my
stamp and mymark on the show,"
Sambandan said. "It's really cool
to say that you're one of the two
cultural show coordinators to
put a show on with the largest
student-run group in the country.
It's a mixture of bragging rights,
a mixture of challenge."
Sambandan said it's difficult
to make the show different each
year since the format - a set
number of dances with themed
costumes - is similar. She said
this show specifically is "incred-
ibly choreographed," with color-
ful music to match.

"Every dance has a twist," she
said. "We are the Indian Ameri-
can Student Association, so as
much as they do stay traditional
to the specific dance style, we
are able to remix it up with some
American music. We want to let
the audience know that we are
students in a generation of people
who have to combine two differ-
ent cultures - not just Indian
but our American - and I think
that's really cool."
For years now, the show has
been selling out quickly. Singh
thinks its popularity has to do
with the loyal members and cus-
tomers who keep coming back
year after year.
"There's a good number of
people around Ann Arbor where
the culture is so diverse and
diversity is promoted on this
campus," Singh said. "People
want to come and see other cul-
tures being showcased."
According to Singh, the city of
Ann Arbor and its citizens also
add to the appeal to the show,
as the city is generally accepting
and encouraging of young cultur-
al phenomena like IASA.
"The typical Ann Arborite
likes to come and educate them-
selves on different things and
learn about other cultures,"
Singh said. "People are so curious
about the college life and what
happens around (a) college cam-
pus, that people just have that
general curiosity to come see it."

Players' production of "What to

show, fully produced and writ-

weekend at East Quad's Keene
Theatre.
"What to Do When Stuck in
Reality" centers on a young man
who blurs the lines of fiction and
real life to overcome hardships.
As his daily struggles grow -
ranging frsom a schizophrenic
roommate to an unresponsive
mother to a non-existent sex
life - Kevin, the protagonist,
recedes into an imaginary world
he's created as a form of escape.
Director Ellen Sachs, a School
of Music, Theatre & Dance soph-
omore, said the advantages and
difficulties of staging such a
fantasy-filled show came from
working directly with the play-
wright, LSA sophomore Jacob
Axelrad, who serves as commu-
nity culture editor at The Michi-
gan Daily.
Sachs's vision proved to be
challenging to stage. Her pre-
vious work with film had ini-
tially interested her in the
imagination-rich script, but the
complexities of producing a play
with film-like nuances quickly
became apparent.

In "Trumpets and Raspberries," the owner of Fiat is mistaken for one of his workers.
A class-conscious comedic play

Music, Theatre Theatre
& Dance's lat- From $10
est production,
"Trumpets and Raspberries."
Written by Italian Nobel Prize
in Literature winner Dario Fo in
1981, the play is set in the Italy
of his time. Directed by MT&D
professor Malcolm Tulip,
the show presents a fictional
account of the real-life owner of
Fiat, Giovanni Agnelli, after one
of his workers, Antonio, saves
him from a kidnap attempt.
Disfigured during the kidnap-
ping attempt, Agnelli is confused
for Antonio when Antonio leaves
his coat with Agnelli. Doctors
mistake the billionaire for Anto-
nio, and Agnelli is given a face
to resemble the worker. The
shos follows Agnelli as he walks

through Antonio's life while slow-
ly recovering his own memory.
Fo's plays were always struc-
tured for the enjoyment of the
everyday man. They would only
be performed at places where
he was sure all could come and
watch. In a satirical smirk, he
picked Italy's entire one percent
as the subject of his play, since
Agnelli controlled nearly 4.4 per-
cent of Italy's GDP at one point.
"Trumpets and Raspberries"
is characterized by themes of
class difference, complex rela-
tionships and mistaken identity.
It's often viewed asa comment on
issues of the time, including gov-
ernmental decisions, the police
force and the medical field.
"It was very much about these
rich business owners having
such control over everything,"
said School of MT&D junior Zoe
Kanters. "The idea that a rich
business owner was lowered to
something as low as workers was
comedic for (Fo's) audience. It's
amazing that it can be connected
to today, with Occupy Wall Street
and ... is still so relevant."
The show is rooted in a form
of theater that originated in Italy,
known as commedia dell'arte. The
characters in this genre are typi-
cally larger than life, aggrandized
versions of personalitytypes. This
may have been Fo's attempt to dis-

play the depth to which his char-
acters are outof touch withnreality.
They often see themselves quite
differently from the way everyone
else perceives them. As a result,
the characters are often consid-

"It's such a farcy show, and

gest difficulty was just being able
to go in and play and have fun
with it, and experiment and find
new things that make the show
even more unique and different."
While the "Raspberries" in
the show's title may not seem to
immediately connect to the plot,
the original Italian translation of
the title reveals that these are the

This humorous sound reflects
the comedic nature of the piece,

By KEVIN RAFTERY
Daily Sports Editor
This past week, the No.20 Michi-
gan football team's defense hasbeen
presented with a very unusual chal-
lenge while preparing to compete
against No. 17 Nebraska.

ers (5-1 Big Ten, Nebraska at

"I think this Where: Michi-
one will pose a gan Stadium
real challenge TV/Radio:
to our defense ESPN
because they're
like three offens-
es in one," said Michigan defensive
coordinator Greg Mattison.
Nebraska features a dual-threat
quarterback in sophomore Taylor
Martinez, a power running back in
senior Rex Burkhead, and an offen-
sive playbook full ofnooks and cran-
nies the Wolverines have never seen
before.
"They will run the power, they'll
run the lead play, they'll run the toss,
toss-(isolation), and then they'll get

into some of the option read stuff,"
said Michigan coach Brady Hoke.
Put those all together, and that
adds up to a stiff task for the Michi-
gan defense come Saturday.
"They're a power attack," Mat-
tison said. "(Burkhead) is a really
good downhill runner. They go from
that to being able to be an option
attack with (Martinez). It makes
the defense have to be sound in all
phases."
Possibly the most difficult task
for the Wolverines (4-2, 8-2) will be
stopping the option - Michigan's
ability to contain the outside has
been an area of concern, though
it has improved over the last sev-
eral games. Mattison noted that the
focus on gap integrity and contain-
ing the edge heading into Saturday
will be "huge."
"Whenever you have an option
team, responsibility and doing your
job is critical," he said. "You have to
be really disciplined playing a game
like this."
While the Wolverines have
improved in defending the outside,
the Cornhuskers have improved
running the option, too - Martinez
said they spend a set period of time
every day to solely practice the play.
Burkhead said Martinez has been
"tremendous" at running the option

and has continued to improve
throughout the season. Martinez
credited his improvement to experi-
ence.
"Every time we do an option, I
get better and better at it," Martinez
said. "Every game I'll keep getting
better."
But Michigan can't get too caught
up in focusing on defending against
the option. Nebraska offensive coor-
dinator Tim Beck seems to always
have something new up his sleeve.
"He's like the witch doctor," said
Nebraska coach Bo Pelini. "You
don't know what he's going to do."
On top of running several differ-
ent offensive schemes, Beck likes to
keep a very up-tempo offense, often
trying to catch the opposing defense
off guard.
"That's a concern," Mattison said.
"Any time a team tempos you, you
have to find out how mature your
defense is. You have to be a very
disciplined defense, and you have to
be a tough-minded defense to know
that you're going to get the call at the
spur of the moment."
But the Wolverines have the
personnel to successfully com-
bat Nebraska's up-tempo offense.
Seniors Ryan Van Bergen and Mike
Martin mentioned this week that
they've become comfortable calling

Senior Rex Burkhead is the main cog as the running back in Nebraska's offense.

audibles at the line when they deem
fit, and Mattison has full confidence
in them to do so.
"You can't load up and play the
power because you may be getting
optioned," Mattison said. "You can't
go in there with an idea of being
a finesse or assignment totally or
you're going to get the power run
right at you."
It's a test that Martin and Van
Bergen say they're ready for - the
two senior leaders have already
had success in calling plays at the
line this year. Against Illinois last
week, Van Bergen called an audible
at the line that resulted in a sack for
the 288-pound defensive end. The

Wolverines enter Saturday's con-
test ranked second in the Big Ten in
scoring defense, giving up an aver-
age of just 15.5 points per game, and
first in red zone defense, stopping
opponents from scoring two-thirds
of the time.
And recently, Van Bergen went so
far as to say that Michigan has the
best defensive line not only inthe Big
Ten, but also in the country. When
asked about Van Bergen's comment,
Hoke was straightforward.
"We have two games left to see
that, right?" he said.
"I know one thing - if you're
gonna talk the talk, you better walk
the walk."

One summer he took a construction job, re-pouring concrete for the
steps in Michigan Stadium. With the old concrete removed, onlythe steel
frame of the stairs remained. Behind that was the gray area under the
bleachers.
Adams Crisler bent down and peered into the excavated area, still
searching. Nothing. He poured the concrete, shutting the area off to
darkness and closing his search forever.
"I feel like I looked every place I possibly could to find it," Adams
Crisler said.
"I think it's a legend," he added later. "That would be my guess."
THE ANSWER
I pulled off Main Street toa quaint house no more than 100 yards from
Michigan Stadium. Other than its wispy light blue exterior, it was the
same as any other house in the neighborhood.
I was here to talk to former Michigan hockey coach Al Renfrew, sim-
ply looking for confirmation on what I had learned.
Kristie had called me back, telling me what her mom knew.
"He gave that seat to himself, you had it right the first time," she said.
"It was kind of like a legendary joke, a mythical thing.
"There was no actual seat itself."
Looking back at the Sports illustrated article, I realized the clues were
right in front of me the whole time. They didn't come from "it has its
spot,"as Crisler claimed but from his smile and cocktail parties.
I called associate athletic director Bruce Madej. He'd worked for the
University since 1978. He knew Fritz. In a documentary on the stadium,
he had said the seat was dedicated to Fielding Yost. He'd heard it the
other way too.
While he wouldn't say the seat was phantom outright, his carefully
chosen words coincided with Kristie's.
But if anyone knew, it was Renfrew. In 1973, Renfrew retired from
coaching and became the ticket manager.
Before personal computers, digital ticket sign-up or cell phones, Ren-
frew had the task of distributing every ticket into Michigan Stadium.
With a paper and pen, he and his staff charted every single seat in the
stadium.
If there really was an '01' occupied on Saturdays, Renfrew would have
it charted.
It didn't take long for his story to line up with everyone else's.
"It was a fictitious number," he said.
THE LEGEND LIVES
I wrote this story simply because I thought it would be fun to find the
seat. The full story of the seat left with Crisler. But I just got the moat
verified story possible. The seat wasn't real. That just left me a bit empty.
Now what?
This legend that I loved so much was just, well, over. I couldn'tgo back
and look again. I couldn't think about the possibilities. The man I needed
to talkto, the one who could dispute my findings, died in 1982.
"The neatest thing about sports is that there can be legend and the
legend of the '5' continues to live, because of what Fritz Crisler said origi-
nally," Madej told me. "It's just a fun story. That's the thing. That's what
the '01' is all about."
Somewhere along the way I had forgotten that. I had become so
obsessed with getting a definitive answer that I didn't realize the fun
tame from the uncertainty of the whole thing.
"How many times do you talk about stadium's capacities?" Madej said.
"If we had just the regular capacity there would not be that type of a
discussion.
"Fritz would absolutely have a blast with this discussion. Fritz would
be excited to know that this chingecontinues. Fritz Crisler loved any time
anybody would talk more about Michigan."
I justended Fritz Crisler's party. For 55 years, ithad been partof Mich-
gan lore. It's a part of Crisler's legacy. Adams Crisler spent a good chunk
of his life searching for it.
He called unannounced a few days after our interview.
The question had been lingering in his head. He had to tell me some-
thing. The seat being real?
"I think it's possible."

HISTORY'S NON-CLUES
Historians had theories - but no
answers.
Greg Dooley, proprietor of the Michi-
gan history blog MVictors.com, never got
a good explanation for a couple of random
seats nestled up against the old press box.
Kinney never ventured a guess, but he
pointed out where the seats were added in
the 1956 renovation.
"When they built the new press box they
moved it back so it was more flush with the
outside of the stadium," Kinney said. "So
they gained those, maybe eight or 10 rows
of seats the width of the press box there.
"And at one point they found that people
at the bend had a few extra inches, so they
squeezed in a couple of seats there."
He pulled out a picture of the stadium
from the 1940s and pointed out how the
press box rose, and the seats were installed
beside and under it. Having an extra seat
in the area was feasible. If Crisler ended
up with 1,000 more seats than he intended,
he could have found a special spot near the
press box for one more.
Yet, the closer I got to an answer, the
more questions appeared. "Who was it
for?" accompanied "Where is it?"
The answer came down to three sus-
pects: Did Crisler give it himself, or did he
do it to honor either Yost or Crisler's men-
tor at the University of Chicago, legendary
coach Amos Alonzo Stagg?
Holland guesses it's Stagg's seat in his
Sports Illustrated article.
"(Stagg) wouldn't have wanted it any
more than Crisler would have (given him)
it," said John Kryk, historian and author of
Natural Enemies, a history of the Michigan-
Notre Dame rivalry. "I just don't believe
that happened. I really don't."
Kryk's didn't think Crisler had the per-
sonality to give the seat to himself. That left
Yost.
"I would say it's definitely not for Yost
unless someone else was behind it, just
because there was quite a power struggle in
Yost's final years," Dooley said.

I left that question unanswered. It wasn't
my focus.
I ended my interview with Kryk on a
simple question: Where do you think the
seat is?
"I think it's a phantom seat," he said. "I
don't think it's a real seat."
Dooley mentioned the same thing. How
did I overlook this possibility? It made the
most sense. Michigan altered the seating
five times since the '01' first appeared. It
tore down the press box Crisler was instru-
mental in constructing. Even if it was there
and Crisler was the only one who knew
about it, how likely was it that the seat
remained through all the construction?
I had to alter my strategy.
The seat wouldn't be found in a program.
Historians know of events and results. Leg-
ends are different. They're passed on, one
telling at a time.
I didn't need hours in a library, just a
shoddy Internetconnection and an Android
phone with a sticky power button.
To get to the seat, I had to get to know the
man.
HOPE
The call changed everything.
The trail had run cold. Hope was dwin-
dling but my phone rang.
It was Kristie Crisler, the Fritz's grand-
daughter. Finding her was easier than I
thought. Some research on Crisler indi-
cated he married a Dorothy Adams. Their
son was Prescott Adams Crisler. His obitu-
ary from last year revealed Fritz Crisler's
grandchildren.
After an expert-level Facebook stalk I
had an email address. From there I got a
phone number and left a voicemail. When
Kristie returned my call, I began to re-
explain what the story was about. "I'm
examining the story behind the extra seat,
to see whether it's real or not and I -" she
cut me off.
"Oh, it's real"
Finally, a breakthrough.
We arranged to meet face-to-face the fol-
lowing week. I spent the better part
of three days thinking about the seat.
How much did she know? Did Crisler
himself tell here Had my fairy-tale
' notion of this extra seat been true?
That night, I wrote an article
breaking down the Michigan-Iowa
game. The word count: 1,001.
DISAPPOINTMENT... THEN HOPE
By the time I sat in that Pizza
House booth, I was convinced it was
the day I would uncover one of the
greatest mysteries in Michigan ath-
letics. The waitress taking our order
had no idea she was going to witness
history.
'Oaily Entering her 50s, Kristie sat across

"The seat is real. I would love to sit in it

able to sit in it."
So she didn't know where it is?
"I can't factually say it's an actual seat....

I was trying to find out. She was sup-

"Maybe we're on a ghost hunt here, I
don't know," she said.
There it was again, the phantom seat.
To figure out this if seat was realor just
a good story, I had to answer the question
I had pushed aside: Who was the seat for?
Kristie saw a Crisler that the historians
didn't. She saw the side of Crisler that didn't
include a suit and tie. Yet, she agreed with
Kryk.
"He would never give the seat to him-
self," Kristie said. "He wasn't like a person-
able, warm, fuzzy kind of guy. He was strict
on integrity and discipline. ... He had warm
sides with certain people."
Those warm sides showed when he with
his grandchildren. Crisler would take them
to Crisler Arena after hours, letting the kids
tackle big bags of popcorn.
"We'd go tackle it, break it open, sit on
the floor and eat it," Kristie said. "The jani-
tor would walk by and say, 'OK Mr. Crisler,
it's fine. I'll clean it up when you're done."'
As I got a firsthand account of Crisler, I
started to believe in the seat again. He was
the taskmaster his players knew, but there
was a softer side, one that had some fun
with people.
I added another possible location to my
list. Before it became WJR Radio's booth,
the Crisler family sat in the what Kristie
remembered as the "ninth booth from the
end" of the press box.

Was that booth the answer? Did Crisler
actually sit in the extra seat on game day?
There's no way to investigate now. That
booth is gone, along with the rest of the
press box from 1956.
By the end of the meeting, Kristie want-
ed to find the answer as much as I did. And
being Crisler's granddaughter had its perks.
She knew people. She reached out to her
network.
When she hung up with her brother
Fritz, the answer was just a phone call away.
"He says he knows what grandpa told
him," Kristie said. "There's folklore and leg-
end but he knows what grandpa told him."
THE SEEKER
Fritz Adams Crisler didn't know it, but
he was my inside man.
He too was an '01' believer.
"I was fascinated by that," said Adams
Crisler, who preferred not to be referred to
as Fritz. "I probably spent a good 10 years
questioning him, 'Where was the additional
seat?' He would never tell me."
The only response Adams Crisler got
was, "You have to find it." So, long before
I was born, Adams Crisler looked. He
scoured the stadium, sometimes full, some-
times empty, looking for the seat. Eventu-
ally he would come back to Crisler with his
reports.
His grandfather would laugh. His only
answer: "You have to keep looking."
"He thought it was just so funny to talk
about it," Adams Crisler said. "It was part of
his playfulness."
Adams Crisler began running out of
options. He found a ladder in the press box,
climbed it and opened the latch to the roof.
No seat. Everywhere he looked, nothing
was unusual.
Eventually the search efforts faded.
Adams Crisler grew up. He attended Michi-
gan. And deep down, he still believed.

As the clock strikes noon
on Saturday, four F-18
fighter jets will soar from
south to north over Michigan
Stadium. Hun-
dreds of feet
below, 65,000
fans will cre-
ate a massive
American n
flag in the '

ever card stunt
project. STEPHEN J.
A live feed NESBITT
from the lead
jet will play on
the video boards until it zips over
I-94, when a camera from field
level will take over, showing the
jets cross over the magnificent
patriotic display.
On the field, the Michigan
football team will wear a patch of
the American flag on the left side
of its blue jerseys.
The Athletic Department has
the program's second Military
Appreciation Day planned down
to the second.
The only question remaining
is: Will you be there to see it?
Brady Hoke and Michigan
are an unbeaten 6-0 at home,
outscoring opponents 222-65 at
the Big House. But most games
have featured an underwhelming
number of students in attendance
at kickoff. Consider this a chal-
lenge.
It's my turn to inspire and
ridicule you. There's a reason
the card stunt won't include the
student section, and it's not just
the fear of the cards becoming
boomerangs, like a military rep-
resentative suggested. It's also
because the student turnout was
for the Purdue and Minnesota
games was a joke.
Show up on time. This game
is going to be special - and not
because of football.
On Saturday, the Wolver-
ines won't be highlighting any
particular legendary Michigan
moment, they'll be creating a
memory.
During the first timeout of the
game, Michigan will honor for-
mer cornerback Bryan Williams.
He made seven tackles in six
games from 1994-96. Insignifi-
cant then, Williams is being hon-

ored on Saturday because today
he will be commissioned into the
Air Force.
If that can't make you set down
your cup a few minutes early and
make your way to the stadium
before noon, you're a disgrace.
This is bigger than your frat
party or your tailgate.
Just like the four pilots rocket-
ing overhead, Williams is leav-
ing to fight for your freedom. If
Bryan Williams isn't a Michigan
Man worth recognizing, we can
officially shelve that term.
This is about respect.
Prior to the game, former
Michigan coach Lloyd Carr -
Williams's former head coach
- will be recognized for his
induction into the College Foot-
ball Hall of Fame. Ann Arbor was
the first and only stop in his head
coaching career. Carr's 122 vic-
tories as a head coach rank him
third in Michigan history, trail-
ing only Bo Schembechler (194)
and Fielding Yost (165).
Michigan coach Brady Hoke
took to the Internet to plead for
a respectable showing to honor
Carr.
"Fans, please make sure tobe
in your seats by 11:45 this week-
end," a smiling Hoke said in a
video released by the Athletic
Department. "We face Nebraska
and we have a special tribute
planned for coach Lloyd Carr.
As part of our tribute, we will
need your help, so get there early.
Thanks, and Go Blue."
Hoke had to put on a pretty
face to urge you - don't make
him beg.
Carr was a disciple of Schem-
bechler, who lived and breathed
"The Team, The Team, The
Team." Like it or not, the fans are
a part of that team. The students
are that weakest link.
But hold on: Michigan is start-
ing a "Shred the Red" rallying cry
to span the last two weeks, hop-
ing to limit the red in Michigan
Stadium against Nebraska and
Ohio State. So if you need another
reason to show up on time - and
you shouldn't - there's a maize .
towel giveaway.
Notice that sudden urge you
just felt to get yourself one of
those towels? (Well, it would go
nicely with your Under the Lights

pom poms.) That should make
you a little disappointed in your-
self. But let's move on.
They don't have 110,000 tow-
els, so if you're late you're miss-
ing out.
And with Nebraska making its
first trip to Ann Arbor as a mem-
ber of the Big Ten, it's appropri-
ate to heed the words of Yost,
the legendary coach and athletic
director who spearheaded the
construction of the Big House in
the 1920s.
"Let me reiterate the Spirit of
Michigan," Yost said in his fare-
well address in 1940. "It is based

on a deathless loyalty to Michi-
gan and all her ways. An enthusi-
asm that makes it second nature
for Michigan Men to spread the
gospel of their university to the
world's distant outposts.
And a conviction that nowhere,
is there a better university, in any
way, than this Michigan of ours."
That deathless loyalty isn't
a half-filled student section at
kickoff. Nebraska certainly quali-
fies as one of the world's distant
outposts, so spread the gospel
of Michigan. Those Cornhusker
fans aren't driving across the
Midwest to be late to the game.

The beauty of Michigan foot-
ball is that 110,000 fans will show
up at the Big House - eventu-
ally. Michigan fans are blessed
enough to be able to make that
guarantee. But don't be the weak
link, be there on time.
Do it for the military and Bryan
Williams. Do it for Lloyd Carr. Do
it for the Spirit of Michigan.
This time it's about respect.
