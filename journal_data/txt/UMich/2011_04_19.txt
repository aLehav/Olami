Law Students
oppose Sen. Rob
Portman's views
on LGBT issues
By HALEY GLATTHORN
Daily StaffReporter
For the second time this
semester, the University's selec-
tion of a commencement speaker
has created a furor on campus.
Hundreds of Law School stu-
dents have expressed their oppo-
sition to U.S. Sen. Rob Portman
(R-Ohio) as the Law School's
graduation ceremony speaker on
May 7. The students have voiced
their opinions to the school's
administration through letters
e nd meetings throughout the
past week and have communicat-
ed their disappointment with the
choice primarily because of Port-
man's record of voting against
LGBT rights.
Despite the students'concerns,
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said Portman, a Law

School alum, will still be speak-
ing at the Senior Day ceremony.
Third-year Law student Sarah
St. Vincent is amongthe students
who have vocally opposed the
selection of Portman. According
to a press release sent out yester-
day by St. Vincent, 298 Law stu-
dents are voicing their dismay on
the issue through a petition. This
number includes about one-third
of graduating Law students, the
press release states.
"Many of us are opposed (to
Portman speaking) because
LGBT rights are something that
we really value," St. Vincent said
in an interview. "For some peo-
ple, that's something that affects
themvery personally. For those of
us who aren't LGBT, it's an issue
of respect for our classmates and
their rights as human beings."
During his time in A&sce, Port-
man has voted for legislation that
would prevent same-sex mar-
riages from being legally recog-
nized.
St. Vincent said students have
authored several letters inform-
ing administrators of their dis-

Members of the leading fac-

an unsettling e-mail from Uni-

versity Provost Philip Hanlon
about three hours before their
weekly meet-
ing yesterday NOTEBOOK
afternoon.
The subject was his rec-
ommendation to the Univer-
sity's Board of Regents on an
issue they have been discuss-
ing frequently throughout the
semester - the faculty tenure
probationary period.

The tenure clock is current-
ly set by Regents Bylaw 5.09
which allows up to eight years
for a faculty member to make
tenure, but a proposed change
seeks to set the upper limit at
10 years for some faculty. Since
1944, each school within the
University has been allowed
to set its probationary periods,
but the periods cannot exceed
seven years with a one-year

terminal period set for faculty,
who don't make tenure.
Hanlon brought the propos-
al forward for public comment

tions are to be presented to the
Board of Regents at its meeting

At its meeting on Thursday,
the University's Board of Regents

will consider a proposal by Uni-

extend the maximum allowed

After months of debate, Han-
lon sent an e-mail yesterday to

governing body of each school

the tenure probationary period

from a maximum of eight years
to a maximum of ten years.
The proposal is not meant to

Students will resume travel to Japan

All University programs scheduled
to travel to Japan during the spring
and summer sessions have been given
the green light since the lift of the
national travel advisory to the country
last week, University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald confirmed yesterday.
The March 11 earthquake, sub-
sequent tsunami and partial nucle-
ar meltdown in Japan left many
concerned about the stability of the
country's landscape. When the U.S.
State Department issued a travel advi-
sory to Japan after the natural disas-
ters, all travel plans to the country by
University programs were immedi-
ately halted.
The 10 undergraduate students in
Japan this semester returned to the
United States after the University

suspended its program. Six graduate
students and several faculty members
were also in Japan at the time, and
all University affiliates were out of
harm's way.
The University's policy on study
abroad programs dictates that no
University-sponsored trips may go
to countries or areas issued a travel
warning by the State Department.
The State Department's decision to
lift the warning for Japan on April
14 has set the University's scheduled
trips back in motion.
Amy Conger, the director of Inter-
national Programs in the College of
Engineering, said that while the travel
advisory was still in place, the engi-
neering program set to go to Nagoya,
Japan in mid-June continued to pre-

pare students for the potential trip.
However, after the March disasters
occurred, the program extended its
deposit deadline until the end of April
as a precaution. That way, students
could form a "plan B" in case the advi-
sory was not lifted, Conger said.
Though University students are
now allowed to travel to Japan, the
State Department maintains a trav-
el advisory against going within a
50-mile radius of the Fukushima
Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, which
experienced a partial nuclear melt-
down in March as a result of the
earthquake.
Conger said Nagoya is not located
near the Fukushima plant, and stu-
dents should not be at risk of radiation
exposure during their studies this

summer. However, she said the pro-
gram is "strongly advising students to
limit their side travel."
In a press release issued yesterday,
members of the University commu-
nity were urged to record their travel
plans and contact information while
abroad in the University's online
Travel Registry. University-affiliated
travelers were also encouraged to pur-
chase travel health insurance through
the University.
Fitzgerald said the travel registry
will help to ensure all students remain
outside of the State Department's
travel advisory near the Fukushima
Power Plant by keeping each location
the students will visit on record.

Director of multicultural From Page1A

program.at U' to retire

Robbie Townsel
has been with
'U' for 25 years
By SARAH ALSADEN
DailyStaffReporter
After 25 years of dedicated
service, Robbie Townsel, the
director of the Multicultural
Affairs Program within Univer-
sity Housing, is retiring.
In her current position,
Townsel played a pivotal role in
developing the Diversity Peer
Educator program that provides
support and counseling for stu-
dents and organizes various
events in University residence
halls.
The program is a branch of
Cultural Awareness and Diver-
sity Education within Univer-
sity Housing and was developed
under Townsel's guidance.
Patricia Griffin, associate direc-
tor of Residence Education and
a colleague of Townsel's in the
Cultural Awareness program,
said Townsel has always made
it a priority to be attuned to stu-
dents' needs.
"She really took that program
from the early '80s and trans-
formed it based on the experi-
ences and needs of students on
campus," Griffin said.
Townsel began working at the
University in 1986 as a duplicator
operator - which involved mak-
ing reproductions of documents
before they were computerized
- before taking a job as a Univer-
sity Housing program assistant,
which eventually led to her role
as supervisor of multicultural
programming.
Townsel's constant passion
for her work is evident in the
support she provides for stu-
dents of diverse backgrounds on
campus, Griffin added.
"The thing that I think is most
memorable about Robbie is her
passion and advocacy for stu-

dents, and particularly students
of color," Griffin said. "She is
known on campus as a person
who is passionate about social
justice issues and really helps
students navigate systems."
Griffin said Townsel's dedi-
cation to students, who visit
her even after they graduate,
has allowed her to form lifelong
friendships with them.
"(She) focuses on supporting
students from a variety of eth-
nic backgrounds," Griffin said.
"She educates herself and those
around her to really think about
what does it mean to be in a mul-
ticultural campus like ours."
When Townsel began work-
ing with the program, there
were only four University rec-
ognized minority groups: Afri-
can Americans, Latinos, Asians
and Native Americans. She said
one of her initiatives was to rec-
ognize more minority groups
so that students can "see their
culture represented in the Uni-
versity and to feel a part of the
community."
"It's important for people of
other ethnicities to recognize
and to learn about other groups,"
she said. "... When you bring
functions into the residence
hall, it opens up a new learning
opportunity for students and
staff."
After she retires, Townsel
said she plans to do non-profit
work with adolescent girls and
pursue writing. She added that
she will remain in touch with
former students because she
enjoys hearing about their lives
and careers.
"Working with students has
been an absolute learning expe-
rience because as much as I've
shared my thoughts, my expe-
riences and my wisdoms with
them, that flow of conversation
has been positive to me," she
said.
Darlene Ray-Johnson, direc-
tor and resolution officer of
Graduate Student Affairs at the

University, worked with Town-
sel in the past and said Town-
sel's dedication to students and
devotion to tolerance has made
her an important asset to the
University.
"I've never known anyone
more committed to students.
That's what I remember about
her," Ray-Johnson said. "There
was no time, day or night, that
she wasn't accessible and avail-
able for students."
Ray-Johnson added that
Townsel's sense of humor and
creativity helped her succeed
professionally and personally
because it allowed her to have
meaningful relationships with
others.
"Her retirement is a real loss
for the University and for the
program, which she was affili-
ated with for so many years, and
so committed to and connected
with," Ray-Johnson said.
LSA senior Charlynn Bowers
said though she has only known
Townsel for a year, Townsel
encouraged her to get involved
and become a Diversity Peer
Educator.
"(She is) very open and sup-
portive and just this really great
mentor and support system,
which I was really looking for-
ward to," Bowers said. "On any
given day (she) can make you
smile and just make you feel
good about whatever is going
on."
Bowers said Townsel's lead-
ership style taught her how to
develop professional relation-
ships built on respect. She added
that Townsel's friendly demean-
or made her like a mother figure
to the students who worked with
her on campus.
"You can't replace Robbie's
style and attitude, and every-
thing about her is really special
to us," Bowers said. "She's done
so much and given so much of
herself to Michigan - not just
students, but the campus and
other faculty and staff."

was initially proposed in a 2006
report from the Committee to
Consider a More Flexible Tenure
Probationary Period, a faculty
advisory committee that report-
ed its findings to the provost.
In March, the University Sen-
ate voted 51-66 against endorsing
the extension of the probation-
ary period. Professors offered
opposing viewpoints about the
extension, which some worried
would delay granting tenure to
faculty unnecessarily.
In February, the Senate Advi-
sory Committee on University
Affairs - the leading faculty gov-
erning body on campus - called
for a change that would allow
an extension of the period on an
individual basis. The proposal
highlighted the "check box to
stop the clock" method, which
would make the procedure for
increasing the probationary
period easier than the current
method of filing for individual
extension.
SACUA Chair Ed Rothman
said at the time that the body
would be open to revisions to the
proposal.
Though SACUA members pro-
posed at their meeting last week
to issue a poll to ask faculty about
their views on the probationary
period extension, the motion was
withdrawn.
Hanlon's proposal is meant to
specifically help Medical School
faculty, who are often rushed
by the eight-year period. At
the February Board of Regents
meeting, several Medical School
faculty voiced their support
for the extension of the proba-
tionary period, listing research
issues and personal plans as
obstacles in meeting the current
maximum tenure clock of a sev-
en-year probationary period and
one terminal year.
However, during a two-week
period for public comment in
February, a variety of opinions
were received on the issue, with
many comments also in strong
opposition. In his recent e-mail
to University faculty, Hanlon
addressed these opinions and
said he considered their points
while reaching his decision
to propose the changes to the
regents.
REGENTS TO CONSIDER
PHOENIX MEMORIAL
BUILDING RENOVATION

Tuesday, April 19, 2011 - 3A
At their meeting this week,
the regents will also consider a
proposal to renovate the second
floor of the Michigan Memorial
Phoenix Library and add on to
the facility.
The renovation will update
the laboratory space to sup-
port the Memorial Phoenix
Energy Institute through a
10,000-square-foot renovation
and a 10,000-square-foot addi-
tion.
At the September 2010 Board
of Regents meeting, the regents
approved the schematic +design
for the project. The project will
include a replacement of the
building's electrical substation
and is estimated to cost nearly
$11.1 million.
The regents will also con-
sider a proposal to proceed with
the construction of the North
Campus Support Facility, which
will help to provide support for
research computing and data
storage by the University's Infor-
mation and Technology Services.
ITS has recommended a
700-square-foot modular data
center near the University's
Transportation Research Insti-
tute, which will provide neces-
sary repair equipment as well as
mechanical, electrical and data
infrastructure. The estimated
cost of the project is $6.2 mil-
lion.
REGENTS TO DISCUSS.NEW
INFORMATION, HEALTH
JOINT DEGREE
On Thursday, the regents will
also consider an action request
to offer a new joint master's
degree in the School of Infor-
mation and the School of Public
Health, as well as a Graduate
Certificate Program in Health
Informatics.
The objective of the new
joint degree is to train experts
who will be able to approach
health information technolo-
gies through a human-centered
approach. The proposed pro-
gram will require 52 credits and
will be intended to be completed
over for two years of full-time
study. In addition, students will
be able to take six courses for
18 credits to achieve the health
informatics graduate certificate.
If the programs are approved,
enrollment for the master's
degree program would be
scheduled to start in fall 2012,
while the graduate certificate
enrollment would be intended
to start this fall.


BUDGET
From Page 1A
be included in the budget - they
said they expect the increase to
be below 7.1 percent. This rep-
resents the average tuition hike
of state universities and colleges
over the past five years.
In his state budget proposal
for the 2012 fiscal year, Repub-
lican Gov. Rick Snyder included
a 15-percent across-the-board
decrease in higher education
allocations. Schools that don't
keep their tuition increases
below 7.1 percent would receive
a 20-percent funding cut.
The approval of Snyder's
proposed budget would
reduce the University's state
funding by about $47.5 mil-
lion from the present amount
of approximately $316 mil-
lion. Under Snyder's pro-
posed plan, however, a tuition
increase of more than 7.1 per-
cent would cost the Univer-
sity an additional $14 million
cut in funding, which would
result in a total loss of about
$61.5 million.
Snyder's goal is to have
the state budget finalized by
May 31 - about four months
before the state fiscal year
officially begins. Coleman
said in an interview last
month that it would be ben-
eficial for the University if the
plan was finalized in May, so
the administrators can use
actual appropriation numbers
instead of projections when
they develop the University's
budget for next year.
"We're very hopeful that
the Legislature will act and
that everything will get
resolved in May, which is
what the governor had hoped
to have happen, but since we
don't have any certainty from
the state yet ... we are model-
ing the 15 percent," Coleman
said.
After the regents meeting
in June, Coleman and Hanlon
said their schedules will be
less busy and they'll be able to
work on other projects. Cole-
man said she'll continue fun-
draising in preparation of the
opening of the new C.S. Mott
Children's and Von Voigt-

lander Women's Hospital in1
November. Coleman added that
will also spend time working on
projects for the North Campus
Research Complex.
"It'll be a very busy and very
active summer, but it'll be won-
derful, and I'm really looking
forward to it," Coleman said.
Hanlon said though he hadn't
figured out exactly what his
office's summer projects will be,
things should be less hectic than
usual.
"We're just now compiling
our list of summer projects we're
going to do around here, but it's
a time to be more thoughtful
when things aren't flying at us

right and left," he said.
Coleman and Hanlon said
they also plan on taking some
time off for themselves to pur-
sue their own research and to
relax.
"I have several days marked
off for research," said Hanlon,
whose research is in the math-
ematical field of Combinatorics.
"I will go on vacation at some
point for a few weeks."
Coleman also said she has
plans to have some time away
from Ann Arbor.
"In August, I'll take a little
time off and go visit my grand-
children," Coleman said. "So
that'll be great fun."

'1-1 Edgar Awards
Spoiler Alert: Karlos Marks won all the awards
Back when J. Edgar Hoover, that infallible defender
of our constitutional rights, was playing dictator and
spying on Americans as head of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation, the Daily's editorial page handed out the
Edgar Awards annually to individuals and institutions best
embodying his many admirable characteristics. Of necessity,
we revived the tradition in recent years.

And so we present the eighth annual Edgar
Awards:

P resident Barack Obama's
campaign staff is nothing if
not savvy about the power
of social net-
working. This
was apparent
when the silly
little sticker for
people to declare
their allegiance
to Obama 2012
popped up on my NEILL
Facebook news- MOHIAMMAD
feed before the
official re-elec-
tion campaign broke in the main-
stream media.
I'm not "In" for Obama 2012
because, on the issues I care about,
I can't find any difference between
his position and those of any of the
assorted clowns he could find him-
self running against next year.
Of course, as a political scientist
I should know better than to expect
any differently. One of relatively few
rock-solid empirical laws we have
in political science is the relation-
ship between "majoritarian" elec-
toral systems and party behavior.
In a nutshell: If there's no prize for
finishing third in an election (as is
the case in the United States), then
from the perspective of a prospec-
tive candidate there's no point in
starting a third party. And if that's
the case, then the two parties should
both move as close to the center, or
"median voter," of the set of people
voting in any particular election.
But wait! Certainly there's a dif-
ference between Obama and, say,
serial bankruptcy case, reality TV
star and born-again Birther Don-
ald Trump? Well, sure. The theory
doesn't have much to say about the
candidates'..lpersslosllties,,And yes,
if you puta gun to my head, I'd have
to concede that, as entrepreneur
and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark
Cuban might say, I wouldn't trust

Donald Trump to manage a Dairy
Queen let alone the West Wing.
When you start to get down to
the issues themselves, though, these
distinctions melt away. If you had
to guess who asked the joint chiefs
of staff to put together a "hit list" of
American citizens suspected of ter-
rorist behavior and then authorized
the CIA to execute anyone on that
list wherever they're found, without
a trial, would you say Obama or for-
mer president George W. Bush? The
answer may surprise you.
Under Obama, the crushing
wave of Homeland Security fund-
ing that paradoxically makes us all
less safe has continued apace. Last
fall, a Washington Post investigation
determined that around 854,000
Americans have a "Top Secret"-level
security clearance. That works out
to be around 0.3 percent of the coun-
try's adult population, even when
excluding however many more hun-
dreds of thousands of people who
have the comparatively pedestrian
and hopelessly gauche "Confiden-
tial" and "Secret" clearances.
You might think that 0.3 percent
is a small number. It only took two
minutes of Google searching and
some back-of-the-napkin arithmetic,
however, to figure that the Stasi, the
notorious East German secret police
- and the intellectual forebears of
the "See Something, Say Something"
program you probably saw plas-
tered all over the walls the last time
you were at the airport - directly
employed as much as 0.7 percent of
the German population during the
1970s. So we're in good company.
These things matter. Granted, the
bit about the extra-judicial execu-
tions matters somewhat more to me
given my skin eolob-a'ad.last name
than it might to you. You might have
the luxury of not having to worry
about the world's worst case of mis-
taken identity any time you step off

an international flight. Even so, the
lack of opposition to the expansion
and entrenchment to the national
surveillance state is corrosive to
American values and makes us less
secure. Opportunists have carved
out tidy careers for themselves by
subverting the torrent of counter-
terror cash that never seems to let
up. Last month, the Washington
Monthly described a terrorism pre-
paredness training session for sher-
iffs' deputies in Floridaduringwhich
a self-described expert explained
that any "Muslim who wears a head-
band, regardless of color or insignia,
basically what that is telling you is
'I am willing to be a martyr."' So at
least now we know what happened
to Tupac.
Too much
surveillance
is not helpful.
I found myself with a lot of time
to contemplate these things last fall,
when I spent about 30 minutes being
interrogated by border security at
Dulles International on my way back
to Michigan from South Africa. And
I speak, in this case, as one of the
lucky ones. It could have been much
worse considering I'm fortunate
enough to have an Irish first name
and a nasally Midwestern accent
and I am a native English speaker.
But am I "In" for Obama 2012? No.
Hell, his name is Barack Obama. If he
weren't the president, he could have

was pleased to see this on a
friend's Facebook wall: "To all

it?"
Perhaps I'll
answer this question in a future col-
umn. Before that, I'd like to prove it's
a question worth answering. Consid-
er the following four reasons:
First, it encourages you to step
back from barriers that may be real
or exaggerated. It defines what skills
you really want to acquire and why.
The time horizon forces you to pri-
oritize options that seem to be end-
less. When time is limited, and it is
limited, you realize that if you really
want to do X, it doesn't make much
sense to take that class on dinosaurs.
Second, it answers not only who
you want to become, but also what
type of society you want to live in.
Does your ideal experience focus on
individual or collective development?
Is success measured by economic
growth or widespread contentment?
A better question: To what extent is
it both?
Third, if you're passionate about
any cause, you probably think the
root of the problem can be solved
through education. Some people
want to mitigate education inequal-
ity. Others don't want to stifle "gift-
ed" students. Some want students to
be more creative. Others prefer that
American students beat Singaporean
students on math and science exams.
Fourth, important people are
already answering this question.
It seems as if society is constantly
debating the point of education and
what's the best way to implement it
Should it be humanities or vocation
based? Steve Jobs believes a liberal

arts foundation induces creativity.
Bill Gates thinks it should be mea-
sured by how many jobs it creates.
Perhaps again, a better question is to
what extent should it be both? .
Last week a column appeared in
the Wall Street Journal called "How
To Get a Real Education in College."
Even though I believe in the concept
of entrepreneurial education - how
education can develop more creative
and engaged students - I disagree
with a large part of the column. It
emphasizes implementation of ideas
at the expense of the mindset that
generates them.
Entrepreneur and author Ben Cas-
nocha hasblogged abouta concept he
calls Real Life University. I under-
stand his concept as customizing an
education to one's specific talents
and desires. For Ben, RLU entails
reading voraciously and eclecti-
cally, exploring places and adapting
to different cultures and surround-
ing himself with interesting and
inspiring people. He's assembled an
informal board of trustees, people
he respects to serve as advisors and
mentors, to guide him as he designs
his own path.
Ben isn't alone. Anya Kamenetz's
book "DIY U: Edupunks, Edupre-
neuers and the Coming Transforma-
tion of Higher Education" chronicles
students who are designing and
implementing their ideal education
experiences. "Life-to-text" program
College Unbound assembles per-
sonalized learning networks - the
equivalent of the University's living
learning communities - to join in
informal classes and formal work
experience. Learning, Freedom and
the Web, a community dedicated to
revolutionizing education, hosts the
Drumbeat Festival, where hundreds
of people share ideas and teach each
other tangible skills.
I, too, have been captivated by the
concept of RLU. My friend and I have
been brainstorming a curriculum
for the next month, from what we
want to read, to whom we want to
include in our personalized learning
networks, to what goals we want to

achieve.
He wants to prepare for the LSAT,
undergo a self-designed study of bas-
ketball statistics and prepare for his
senior thesis on the economic impli-
cations of philosopher John Rawls's
theories.
My senior thesis will answer the
initial question as well as others:
What should education look like in
the 21st century? What skills should
students acquire, and how should
they acquire them? What is the best
way to incentivize students? How
can schools accommodate different
learning styles, different cultural val-
ues and ultimately competing visions
as to what society should look like?
What do you
want from your
education?
I want to read up and talk to
experts on pedagogy, neuroscience
and organizational design. I'll also
be working with eRes, an entrepre-
neurial living learning community to
directly implement some of my theo-
ries, as well asbrainstorm a potential
University of Michigan version ofthe
Drumbeat Festival.
For a month, I'll be experiment-
ing with the people, projects and
information we want to surround
ourselves with, so that I can recreate
it when all structure is taken away.
Throughout the process, I'll be ask-
ing: Is this sustainable? Am I getting
the results I want? This concept is a
bit peculiar, but also telling. I want
to have a real life University experi-
ence, in a real live University.
We might all be a bit more delib-
erate if we answered the initial
question. As for time to experiment,
there's always the summer.

*Ryan's energetic play fits well with new scheme

By TIM ROHAN
Daily Sports Editor
His helmet was so beaten it
looked like he had fought off a
ram.
Redshirt freshman linebacker
Jake Ryan first noticed pieces
of his winged crown coming off
during the first week of spring
practice. His helmet was the
only one that had to be repaired
this spring as an off-yellow paint
covered most of the front left
side, serving as a medal of the
hits he's levied this spring. Then
that paint started taking blue
scuff marks from even more hits.
"When Jake's on the field, he
adds a little something out there
and you can just feel it," Michi-
gan coach Brady Hoke said.
"There's an intensity."
"He's a tough sucker," Hoke
added on the Inside Michigan
Football television show. "He's
fun to be around ... He is truly a
guy who loves to play the game,
and that's the fun part about it."
During Michigan's spring
game last Saturday, Ryan stood
out as a member of the second-
team defense - behind first-
teamers Cam Gordon and Marell
Evans - and showed a diversi-
fied skill set: in Michigan defen-
sive coordinator Greg Mattison's
complex defense, he showed
quickness during blitzes and the
ability to shift his hips and drop
. into coverage.
And in a game with little scor-
ing, the linebacker dropped back
during a cover-4 zone call. Back-
up quarterback Devin Gardner
looked right and stared down

After the spring game, Van Ber-
gen was asked what it was like to

see some former Michigan greats
back in the Big House.
"It's just kind of unsettling,"
Van Bergen said. "It's great that
thIeV're back. iautnlirekinda like,
'Where have they been the past
two or three years?' Because
we've still been wearing the
same helmets we have been since
they were here. You know what I
mean?
"It's good to have them back,
but at the same time, it's new all of
a sudden. Which is a good thing,

it's good to have alumni back to
support us."
Players like Mike Hart and
Steve Breaston said they felt no
animdsity frotm 4odriguez or his
?staff and they were always wel-
comed back, but both said maybe
other players had their own rea-
sons for not coming back.
Michigan missed a bowl game
'for its firsttwo years under Rodri-
guez - which, in 2008, marked
the first time in more than 30
years that the Wolverines had not

played in a bowl. Rodriguez was
replaced by Hoke in January after
Rodriguez finished his career
with a 15-22 record.
"Ihave no ill >feelings toward #
(Rodriguez)," Breaston said.
"(But) when it comes to Satur-
days it's all about winning games.
And everybody keeps makingthis
whole, 'Oh, he wasn't accepted.'
Butwhenyouwingames onSatur-
days you get accepted. It changes
a lot ... When you win ballgames,
you're goingto be here."

Your standard, sappy and
heartfelt senior farewell

There are a lot of things I
didn't learn in college.
I still set off the smoke
alarm when making grilled
cheese sandwiches, I can't tell
you much
about dino-
saurs (despite
having taken
the class
"Dinosaurs.
and Other
Failures") and
I wouldn't CHANTEL
know where JENNINGS
to begin with
algorithms or
anthropology..
But in four years, I've gone
from being a premed student to
an English major, I've been an
activist, a GDI, a sorority girl,
back to a GDI, an almost-IM
sports champion, a volunteer
in prisons, a basketball coach, a
Spaniard, a Daily writer, a Daily
photographer, a student and a
Michigan fan.
But when asked to define
myself, I always end up using
the word "writer." I used to
think that was solely because of
my experience at The Michigan
Daily, but to be honest, I'm not
sure how much the Daily taught
me to write so much as it allotted
me the space to do so.
It's been a pleasure covering
sports teams for three years. But
more than anything, I realized
the Daily has taught me how to
be an adult. It taught me to be
grateful, to apologize when you
should and to give everything
i you can because someday, some-

how, it will come back to you
(Quid pro quo, John Rubadeau).
So, I think I'll use this last
byline to do all of that.
Thank you to everyone I've
worked with. The good and the
bad have made me the writer I
am today.
Thank you to whoever sub-
sidizes the cost of the vending
machine at the Daily. It's been
nice spending just 50 cents on a
can of Coca-Cola to help me fin-
ish my articles.
Thank you to my friends.
Mostly, to my four roommates
who, for the better part of this
year, had no idea which state I
was in or when I'd be coming
home. You are all wonderful, and
the regret of my Daily career will
be never writing the ex-athletes
feature. I'm sure it would've been
Pulitzer worthy. My bad.
Patrick, for the past two
years you've been offering me
quotes for stories. Considering I
never covered the football team,
they've been worthless. But for
today, here you go.
"The early bird gets the
worm," Patrick Collins said Mon-
day. "The second mouse gets the
cheese."
On a less serious note (thanks
for the transition Nez, but you
still can't date my little sister),
I would like to apologize to my
professors. I don't think I was
ever anyone's favorite student.
I've skipped far more classes
than I should've and I've been
half asleep for the others.
I've often gotten comments

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com

6A - Tuesday, April 19, 2011 T

Michigan's struggles are in the math

The numbers don't lie.
Anyone who's been
around the Michigan
baseball team.- from Michigan
coach Rich Maloney to the play-
ers and even
the Daily ZACH
baseball HELFAND
beat - has
attributed the On Baseball
team's strug-
gles to lack of offense, poor field-
ing and allowing the big inning.
But do the numbers tell the
same story? Let's break down
the statistics to pinpoint the
source of the Wolverines' woes.
64 - The percentage of balls
in play that are converted to
outs by the Michigan defense.
Known as "defensive efficien-
cy," Texas and South Carolina
led the nation last year at 72.6
percent. With the new bat rules
that have led to a bit less offense
this season, Louisville is on
pace to finish with a 74 to 75
percent efficiency.
That means Michigan con-
verts over 10 percentage points
fewer outs for every ball in play
than Louisville, leading to a

couple of extra hits per game.
45 & 15 - Respectively, the
number of wild pitches and
passed balls committed by the
Wolverines.
That's an absurdly high
number when you consider that
Michigan's 15 passed balls near-
ly triples the average of the rest
of the Big Ten (5.9), and its 45
wild pitches is almost twice the
average for the rest of the con-
ference (22.8). You can attribute
this dismal statistic to a young
catching corps.
58 - For innings in which
Michigan surrendered a run, 58
percent have resulted in mul-
tiple runs.
Michigan's offense only tal-
lies multiple runs in 40 percent
of scoring innings.
On top of that, in scoring
innings the opposition scores
three or more runs nearly twice
as often as the Wolverines (35
percent compared to Michigan's
19 percent). Why such crooked
numbers? The low defensive
efficiency and high error rate
gives the opposition more outs
per inning and often causes

for balls in play (BABIP) against
the Michigan pitching staff. By
assuming that every ball in play
has an equal chance of becom-
ing a hit, this statistic shows
"real" batting average against.
The Big Ten BABIP average is
.333, so every ball in play has a
.333 chance of becoming a hit.
The Big Ten average is .028
lower than Michigan's BABIP,
indicating misfortune for the
Wolverines.
In other words, Michigan's
opponent's batting average
is higher than it should be,
and should decline. But other
factors contribute to BABIP,
such as poor defense and more
hard-hit balls by the opposi-
tion, which probably inflate this
figure.
.310 - Michigan's offensive
BABIP, over twenty percentage
points lower than the Big Ten
BABIP of .333. This discrepancy
signifies the lineup is unlucky
- about one of every 50 balls in
play does not fall for a hit when
the averages tell us it should.
This indicates that the lineup
should see a rise by about 20

percentage points in batting
average, though Maloney might
point out the low BABIP could
be due to too many lazy fly balls.
.247 - The Wolverines bat-
ting average - good enough for
last place in the Big Ten and by
far the lowest average in Malo-
ney's tenure.
.319 & .327 - Respectively,
Michigan's on-base percentage
and slugging percentage. Like
batting average, both earn the
Wolverines at least a share of
last place in the Big Ten.
Both the power numbers
and the small-ball numbers are
lacking.
So let's do the math: Poor
defense and sloppy play ampli-
fies the problem of sub-par
pitching, which leads to big
innings. A bottom-dwelling
offense can't contend with the
production of opposing teams.
When you add it all up, you
get 11 - the number of wins
Michigan has all season.
Compare this to 23 losses, the
worst statistic of all. And you
don't need a calculator to tell
you that.

SPEAKER

approval, including two letters to
Law School Dean Evan Caminker
- one from a group of third-year
Law students and another from
a group of first and second-year
students. Students have also sent
a letter to Portman requesting he
withdraw as speaker, St. Vincent
said.
. Fitzgerald said Caminker is
taking the students' concerns seri-
ously and has met with a number
of them to better understand their
complaints. However, Fitzgerald
said Caminker is moving ahead
with plans to have Portman deliv-
er the Law School graduation
address.
Caminker e-mailed members
of the Law School community on
April 14 concerning the issue and
acknowledged the controversy
the Senior Day speaker choice has
caused.

TENURE
From Page 1A
and Statistics Prof. Ed Rothman
and Senate Assembly member
Benjamin Allen, an assistant
professor of cell and develop-
mental biology, speak at the
regents meeting.
Hanlon informed SACUA
members via e-mail yesterday
afternoon that he will suggest
setting the limit at 10 years
despite the committee's votes
against the proposed change.
Last month, the University
Senate voted to express their
hesitation to change the bylaw.
Rothman and SACUA Vice Chair
Gina Poe, an associate profes-
sor in the Medical School, met
with University President Mary
Sue Coleman in late February
to express their concerns about
Hanlon's proposal.

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com

rounding this issue has been
thoughtful, and I respect our stu-
dents' conviction and outreach,"
he wrote. "I truly regret that this
issue has caused members of our
community distress in anticipa-
tion of what should be a celebra-
tory day."
However, Caminker defended
the Law School's decision to invite
Portman to speak at the school's
graduation ceremony.
"The Law School has a tradition
of inviting commencement speak-
ers with a range of backgrounds
and accomplishments, includ-
ing leaders in government, public
service and private enterprise,"
he wrote. "We seek speakers who
have achieved success and accom-
plishment in their professional
careers, rather than speakers
whose views are representative of
all or a majority of the students at
the Law School."
In his e-mail, Caminker also
reaffirmed the school's support of
the LGBT community and wrote
that preventing Portman from
Rothman said proposals are
usually passed by the Board of
Regents after receiving a rec-
ommendation from the provost.
However, he added that SACUA's
job is to express the opinion of
the faculty, which members have
roused through previous discus-
sions and votes.
SACUA member Kate Barald,
a professor in the Medical
School and College of Engineer-
ing, said the committee expects
the regents to pass Hanlon's rec-
ommended change to the bylaw.
"We've resigned ourselves,"
Barald said.
SACUA ELECTS NEW
CHAIR, VICE CHAIR
During yesterday's meet-
ing, Barald was elected the
new SACUA chair by a 5-3 vote.
Barald ran against SACUA mem-
ber Kim Kearfott, a professor in

speaking at the ceremony would
oppose the University's goal of
facilitating a discourse on campus
that includes a variety of opinions.
"We are deeply invested in
the principle of diversity where
a wide spectrum of perspectives
is included," Caminker wrote.
"The Law School remains stead-
fast in its commitment to create
a supportive environment for our
LGBT community, and also to cre-
ate an educational environment in
which diverse viewpoints can be
represented. Anything less would
undermine the Law School's core
values."
St. Vincent said that at the cer-
emony, students against Portman
may hold signs, wear buttons or
stage a walk out. The Univer-
sity's choice could also have last-
ing implications, as St. Vincent
said some students may pledge to
withhold future donations to the
Law School.
"It shows our families that this
is something that's really impor-
tant to many of us," St. Vincent
the Medical School and College
of Engineering, who was later
elected to the vice chair posi-
tion.
The candidates were self-
nominated, and three members
were ineligible. Poe and Mojtaba
Navvab, an associate professor
of architecture, are nearing the
end of their three-year term on
SACUA, while Rothman, as the
current chair, couldn't run for
another position.
SACUA member Rachel Gold-
man, a professor in the College of
Engineering, nominated herself
for vice chair, but lost to Kear-
fott in a 7-1 vote. Kearfott said
she is eager to support Barald.
"My commitment is to help
and stand behind (Barald) as
much as possible," Kearfott said.
Barald said there is a need to
increase respect for University
faculty and she plans to address
this issue as SACUA chair.

said. "It's not an area we're willing
to compromise."
Though St. Vincent said stu-
dents don't have another specific
speaker in mind, they hope to
convince the school to rescind the
invitation to Portman.
Third-year Law student Kaitlin
Jackson is also working to reverse
Portman's selection, but said she
doesn'tthink students' efforts will
be successful.
"I don't think there's any
chance the school will change the
speaker, and whether or not Port-
man will withdraw, it's hard to
say," Jackson said.
For Jackson, the issue with
Portman being the commence-
ment speaker is the University's
implied support of the senator's
views. She said by presenting
Portman as a "model" successful
graduate, the University appears
to support all aspects of his career.
. "A lot of times in life you have
to sit and listen to people you
disagree with, and I think that's
something we understand, but it's
"I think that the process that
we've begun of trying to be pro-
active need impetus and needs
to be continued," Barald said.
"I think it's critical to work on
issues in which we can make a

Hayward said the CLB will draft

defining what will be off-limits

submitted to the University by
the Mackinac Center for Public

as non-profit and non-partisan
- under Michigan's Freedom of

Rothman called the requests
an "attack on public education."

Before Iggy was a legend
Ann Arbor residents look back on their
encounters with homegrown star Iggy Pop
By David Riva I Daily Arts Writer"'

Listening solo

There's a certain aura that
exists when a musician spends
his or her formative years in
an area. That person lives on
through stories shared in record
shops and concert halls. Some
might call it legend, but those
who reach this mythical status
have an inextricable influence
on the place where they grew up
- their presence still emanates
from the walls of local public
schools, convenience stores and
diners.
Iggy Pop is one of these musi-
cians. The 63-year-old artist will
be playing a tribute show tonight
for the late Stooges guitarist Ron
Asheton in the city in which the
Stooges formed - Ann Arbor.
"(Iggy Pop) was one of the
most energetic dancers," Ann
Arbor-based musician Dan Mul-
holland said. "When he started
taking off, he was just riveting.
I don't know if it was cocaine or
what, but he would just fly across
the room like James Brown. He
made Mick Jagger look really
bad."
Musician Scott Morgan, who
went to Iggy's high school in
Ann Arbor, echoed the praise of
the star's untamed energy.
"He puts everything he's got
into the show," he said.
Off the stage, Iggy was just
as memorable as he was while
performing, and Ann Arborites
eagerly share their anecdotes
that loosely connect them to this
substantial figure in the city's
history.
John Kerr, owner of Wazoo
Records on State Street, recalled
his "one fabled encounter with
Iggy Pop," when he was work-
ing an early-morning shift at a
convenience store called Stop-
N-Go on Broadway Street in Ann
Arbor" . ""
"It was a complete ghost town,
and I guess Iggy was playing at

some festival in Toledo that day,"
he said. "I looked out across the
parking lot, and there came Iggy,
and he came in. He was the only
person in the store with me. He
bought a loaf of bread, paid for it
with small change to the exact
penny ... He had an Iggy Pop
T-shirt turned inside out that he
was wearing."
Born Jim Osterberg in Mus-
kegon, Mich., Iggy and his fam-
ily moved to a trailer park in
Ypsilanti when he was young.
He wasn't fond of telling others
about this housing arrangement,
though.
"He didn't want anyone to
know that he lived there, so he
told them he lived somewhere
else," Morgan said.
However, his self-conscious
attitude was something that
didn't last long. Jim would
acquire the nickname Iggy and
with it would become one of the
most notorious rock'n'rollers
and recognizable stage perform-
ers of his time.
But while attending Ann
Arbor's Pioneer High School in
the '60s, Jim was just another
kid.
"He was pretty straight when
he was in high school," Morgan
said. "He was a gymnast and
played golf."
On stage, during high school
talent shows, Jim began to stand
out, and his Iggy persona started
to take shape.
"He did (a) comedy routine,"
Morgan explained. "He played
this character named Hyacinth.
He didn't talk, and he just kind
of acted funny. I don't know
how to put it, but it was a look at
what he would do later with the
Stooges."
Around this time, Jim took a
job at thesnow-closed Discount
Records on State Street. This
is where Herb David, owner of

these small
treasures that tell us something,
or nothing, about the person they
once belonged to, and can tell us
everything about ourselves.
Rothbart's new film, "My
Heart is an Idiot," which is pre-
miering at the Michigan Theater
this Friday, is an extension of that
seeking. David Meiklejohn, the
film's director, captures Rothbart
searching not just for love, but
for answers about love, through
his own experiences and those of
others.
While the documentary ended
up being about Rothbart's love
life, it certainly didn't start off
that way. According to Rothbart,
Meiklejohn intended to make a
documentary about Rothbart's
cross-country tours promoting.
FOUND Magazine.
"And of course after the first
tour, he told me what he realized
after going through the footage
was what they really captured
was the ups and downs of my love
life," Rothbart said in a phone
interview on Wednesday.
It was meant to be. An Ann
Arbor native - he attended
Community High School and
won eight Hopwood awards for
writing while a student at the
University - Rothbart showed
Meiklejohn footage he had taken
of himself after breakups dating

back to high school and college -
in a way, his own FOUND notes
documenting the lows of his
love life. Rothbart said he hadn't
filmed his heartbroken reactions
to early breakups with any sort
of plan in mind, but that the cam-
era provided a needed presence,
a completely objective and non-
threatening listener. The archi-
val footage proved useful for the
documentary.
This isn't to say the film is all
about the lows of love - there are
highs as well. And "My Heart is
an Idiot" isn't just about Roth-
bart's experiences, either. Dur-
ing the second tour Meiklejohn
took with the FOUND crew, they
interviewed a variety of notable
celebrities - including author
Charles Baxter, politician Newt
Gingrich, National Public Radio
host Ira Glass and actress Zooey
Deschanel - about love.
But the documentary cen-
ters on Rothbart, a man who
experiences events, people and
emotions with incredible and
refreshing intensity. "Idiot" or
not, Rothbart's heart loves hard
and hurts hard.
And some of his experiences
are painfully embarrassing. In
a last-ditch effort get his high
school girlfriend back, Rothbart
went to Arborland to buy her a
ring and asked her to marry him.
"I actually videotaped it while
I asked her," Rothbart said. "And
she was like, 'No? What are you
thinking?'"
Rothbart laughed while
recounting the story, but part of
his worry about the film is that,
with all the footage of him going
through these moments of pro-
found sadness, the audience will
be unsure when it's OK to laugh.
Rothbart is banking that most
in his audience have loved and lost

"Shift 2: Unleashed" is
a byproduct of the popular
arcade-racing franchise "Need
for Speed."
When publish-
er EA noticed
that sales were Shift 2:
dwindling Unleashed
year to year for
the "Need for E Games
Speed" games,
it decided to Xbox360,
change the PS3and PC
franchise's
focus to a more simulation-style
racing game with "Need for
Speed: Shift." Apparently the
shift in focus (forgive the pun)
did well enough to warrant a
sequel, so here we are.
The campaign consists of
numerous race events, ranging
from drift courses, city racing,
time trials on famous tracks
and racing with old-school cars.
Players start with a modest
car - after a certain number of
races, faster, more exotic auto-
mobiles are unlocked or can be
bought.
Though definitely not an
arcade game, "Shift 2" never
fully commits to realism, so the
gameplay is caught in a weird
middle ground. It still requires
players to slow down cautiously
on turns, but it's less realistic
about braking time or momen-
tum physics when steering
around corners.
Even with the driving assists
the game provides on the nor-
mal difficulty level, the races
can get pretty challenging. One
accidental move off the track
can ruin the player's chances
of placing well. As a result, the
pressure to stay on the right
track often takes away from
the fun of the racing. Though
it's thrilling to pass opponents
at high speeds, these moments
don't happen often enough.
The online play is functional,

but not especially engaging.
Races are set up in a lobby sys-
tem with race parameters that
other players create or that can
be set up and created by one-
self. Racing with other players
is often smooth, but connec-
tion issues do pop up from time
to time. Most races that people
play let any car race, so it's best
to go through the single player
and geta fast car before jumping
online.
Despite its shortcomings,
and though it may not add to
the experience in any dramatic
way, "Shift 2" is a sleek, well-
produced game. The menus are
slick and stylish, the graphics
are polished and the attention
to detail in the sound design is
noticeable. When the player is
driving, "Shift 2" encourages
an in-car camera angle because
each car has a uniquely modeled
interior and dashboard. Driv-
ing from the driver seat's per-
spective further adds a sense of
immersion.
Return to
control as you
enter the space
of 'Shift.' Tab.
On paper, this should be a
great game: There's a sufficient
amount of difficulty, a lot of
content and the driving handles
fine. But just like the unorigi-
nality of its subtitle, "Shift 2:
Unleashed" does nothing to
differentiate itself from other
driving games. It doesn't try
anything new and is content to
simply iterate on an established
formula. For those really into
cars or interested in a new rac-
ing game, "Shift 2: Unleashed"
will scratch that itch, but it cer-
tainly won't blow any socks off.

love, and maybe have even gone to
embarrassing lengths to keep or
find it. The humor in his own hurt
comes from the fact that we've all
been hurt. And with the feroc-
ity of Rothbart's reactions in the
film, he can sometimes provide
an illustration for those of us who
haven't allowed ourselves to feel
the hurt as deeply or fully as he
does. When Rothbart weeps after
a breakup, he's weeping for all of
us who haven't let ourselves do so.
"I think it's really relatable,"
Rothbart said. "All the mistakes,
snares, troubles and triumphs.
But I think it's something other
people relate to because they've
made the same mistakes."
To a certain extent, Roth-
bart has turned his own love life
into a film version of a FOUND
item. Rothbart said the items he
compiles in FOUND are often
illustrations of dilemmas and vic-
tories many people go through,
and that's an important reason

why the magazine is so popular.
Rothbart's film takes something
everyone has experienced - love
- and allows the audience to see
themselves in his romantic highs
and lows.
"Part of what I love about the
FOUND notes is that sometimes
you can be going through some-
thing in your own life that's real-
ly painful or difficult, and then
you read a note that a stranger
has written and see that some-
one else is going through almost
the exact same thing," Rothbart
said. "There's something really
magical about realizing you're
not alone and that it's something
other people are going through.
In a weird way, I almost think
the movie is kind of like that ...
My hope is that other people will
watch it and, you know, recog-
nize themselves in it.
"So many people, just seeing
the title of the movie, have said,
'Hey, my heart's an idiot, too."'

University Michigan alum and assistant attorney general for the state of Michigan Andrew Shirvell voices concerns about Michigan Student Assembly president
Chris Armstrong.
Assistant attorney general
criticizes MSA president

Alum Andrew
Shirvell decries
Armstrong's 'radical
homosexual agenda'
By DEVON THORSBY
Daily News Editor
Sept. 14, 2010 - An assistant
attorney general in the appellate
division for Michigan Attorney
General Mike Cox is inserting
himself into politics on campus.
University alum Andrew
Shirvell has been actively speak-
ing out against Michigan Stu-
dent Assembly President Chris
Armstrong since shortly after
his election in March. Shirvell
has periodically appeared at
various campus events to protest
Armstrong's presidency. He also
maintains a controversial blog
called "Chris Armstrong Watch,"
where he criticizes what he calls
the MSA president's "radical
homosexual agenda."
Officials at the Attorney Gener-
al's office confirmed that Shirvell
works for Cox and that they are
aware of his public disapproval
of Armstrong, including the blog.
Officials also said on Wednes-
day that they would provide The
Michigan Daily with a statement
on the issue, but despite several
follow-up inquiries over four
business days, a statement was
never received.
Shirvell declined to comment
in an e-mail interview last month
about whether his decision to
speak out against Armstrong has

affected his work for an elected
official.
In the inaugural post on Chris
Armstrong Watch in late April,
Shirvell wrote aboutArmstrong's
election and his campaign to
become MSA president. The first
post was accompanied by a photo
of Armstrong that has "Resign"
written over his face and a rain-
bow flag with a swastika in the
middle of it next to him.
In that post, Shirvell pointed
out Armstrong's time serving as
chairman of MSA's LGBT com-
mission, which Shirvell describes
as "a commission that solely
focused on utilizing the student
government to promote the radi-
cal homosexual agenda, includ-
ing gay 'marriage' and adoption
'rights."
"Armstrong's radical agenda
includes mandating 'gender-neu-
tral' housing," Shirvell also wrote
in the post, "so that cross-dress-
ing students will not have to share
a dorm room with a member of
the same sex. This proposal, how-
ever, endangers female students,
as it will also force heterosexu-
als of different genders to share
the same room and will undoubt-
edly lead to a massive increase in
rapes."
When Armstrong arrived on
campus this fall, Shirvell wrote
a post on Sept.1 entitled "What's
Past is Prologue: Armstrong's
VIOLENT Supporters & the
Coming Persecution this Fall."
In that post, Shirvell warned
"...if events this past spring and
summer are indicative of what's
to come this fall when Armstrong
is called out in public about his

outright lies, then Christian, pro-
life, and minority students on
campus shouldbe aware thatthey
willbe VIOLENTLYpersecuted."
Another post in early Sep-
tember criticized Armstrong's
comments at New Student Con-
vocation. At the event, Armstrong
told the new students in atten-
dance that their "time here in
Ann Arbor is as much about your
own self-discovery as it is about
your career."
On his blog, Shirvell described
that comment by writing, "It is
clear that Armstrong's remarks
constituted nothing more than
a thinly veiled attempt to cause
sexually confused, and perhaps
some impressionable, 17-and-18-
year-olds to experiment sexually
with members of their own gen-
der."
Other blog posts have been
entitled "Chris Armstrong: The
PRIVILEGED Pervert" and
"Chris Armstrong & His Bull-
horn: Portrait of a Radical Homo-
sexual Activist at Work."
In the interests of decency, the
Daily decided not to publish some
of the most inflammatory passag-
es from the blog.
At last week's MSA meeting,
Shirvell called on Armstrong to
resign during the community
concerns portion of the meeting,
criticizing his affiliation with
senior society Order of Angell. In
particular, Shirvell accuses Arm-
strong of lying during his cam-
paign about his intention to join
Order of Angell.
"Even the first gay MSA presi-
dent is corrupted by his power,"
he said at the MSA meeting. "You

all should impeach him."
The society, formerly known as
Michigamua, has been criticized
for allegedly using Native Ameri-
canartifactsas partofitsmeetings
and rituals in the past. In 2007, the
organization formallytchanged its
name, and in an effort to become
more transparent, began publish-
ing a list of its members and mak-
ing its records available to the
public. Its meetings and activities,
however, remain secretive.
Tuesday night's meeting
wasn't the first time Shirvell
showed up at a campus event to
criticize Armstrong. In May, stu-
dents, LGBT rights activists and
community members gathered
outside the Walgreen Drama Cen-
ter on North Campus to countera
protest by the Westboro Baptist
Church. The church had planned
to stage a protest against a pro-
duction of "The Laramie Proj-t
ect," a play that centers around
the murder of Matthew Shepard,
an openly gay student who was
beaten to death in 1998.
Though the church's protestors
never showed, the counter-pro-
test continued anyway, with signs
calling for love and acceptance.
Shirvell, photographed by
Daily photographers and identi-
fied in a May 20 article on Pride-
Source.com, also attended the
protest, following Armstrong and
holding a sign accusing him of
racism.
Witnesses reported that when
Armstrong addressed the crowd,
Shirvell attempted to speak over
him with accusations that Arm-
strong lied to the University com-
munity.

FiNANCING YOUR EDUCATION
Gov. Granhomsigns law
to cut Promise scholarship

Upwards of 96,000
students lose state
funding
ByMATT AARONSON
Daily NewsEditor
Nov. 2, 2009 - Gov. Jennifer
Granholm signed into law Fri-
day the final six bills of a budget
that showed the wear and tear
of a legislature crippled by par-
tisan battles over how to solve
the state's many problems.
For the University, the budget
bears bad news on two fronts:
eliminating the popular Michi-
gan Promise Scholarship pro-
gram and once again cutting
back state funding provided to
the University.
The Michigan Promise Schol-
arship provides tuition money to
more than 96,000 Michigan col-
lege students. Performance on a
merit exam given in high school
determines the amount a stu-
dent receives, which can total
anywhere from $500 to $4,000
over four years.

University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald told the Daily last
month that an estimated 6,096
students at the University of
Michigan would be eligible for
Promise grants this academic
year.
These students now have to
find another way to fill that gap
in their tuition costs.
Phil Hanlon, vice provost for
academic and budgetary affairs,
told the Daily in late September
that, unsure about the Prom-
ise Scholarship program's fate,
"the University set aside some
one-time funds ... to fill these
expected financial aid gaps."
Also in late September, Cyn-
thia Wilbanks, the University's
vice president for government
relations, told the Daily that the
University would fill that void
for students with demonstrated
financial aid need if the Promise
Scholarship was cut.
"We have committed to
meeting the full financial need
and we have been prudent in
the way we have budgeted so
that we will have resources for
those students who have the

financial need and as of now, do
not appear to be receiving the
Promise grants," she said in late
September.
Earlier this month, after a
letter to state legislators from
a business advocacy group
encouraging lawmakers to pass
a budget proposalthat cut the
Promise Scholarship bore her
name on the letterhead, Univer-
sity President Mary Sue Cole-
man issued a statement in which
she distanced herself from the
recommendation.
She wrote: "It is in the best
interests of the state to look to
the long term and focus on the
highest priorities - including
higher education - as we lay the
groundwork for the future."
On that higher education
front, the budget signed into law
Friday provides $325,347,400
in state appropriations for the
University of Michigan in Ann
Arbor for the coming fiscal year.
This represents a drop of
around .4 percent from last
year's funding, but beat earlier
University projections by 2.8
percent. Those projections had

estimated state funding to drop
to $316,572,000 for fiscal year
2010.
The amount of state funding
influences the make-up of the
rest of the University's budget,
from the funding of different
schools and academic programs
to student tuition levels. But offi-
cials are quick to note that they
have very carefully accounted
for potential drops in state fund-
ing while crafting budgets in
recent years.
Marking a continued reli-
ance on cost cutting and tuition
increases to fill the state fund-
ing void, state appropriations
account for 21.75 percent of rev-
enues in the University's Gen-
eral Fund budget proposal for
fiscal year 2010. In that same
budget, tuition and fees account
for 65.19 percent.
From fiscal year 2003 to fiscal
year 2004, state funding for the
University experienced a free
fall, plummeting by about 10
percent - or $36,356,600.
Since then, the appropria-
tions have hovered mostly in the
$320-$330 million range.

State officials join
0 crowd of more than
80,000 for speech
By JACOB SMILOVITZ and
KYLE SWANSON
Editor in Chiefand
. Daily News Editor
May 5, 2010 - President
Barack Obama challenged the
political status quo in a speech
before more than 80,000 at the
University of Michigan's spring
commencement Saturday, call-
ing on graduates to embrace
change as a means of strength-
ening the country's democracy
for years to come.
Obama's speech in Michigan
Stadium was a clear denun-
ciation of the current state of
American politics - an envi-
ronment he said is never a
place for the "thin-skinned or
faint-of-heart" but has recent-
ly been pushed further by the
"incredibly difficult moment
in which we find ourselves as
a nation."
Through his words, the
president attempted to con-
vey his notion of citizenship
to the maturating generation
before him. He tried at times
to reshape current conceptions
of small and big government,
pushed for a more civil political
discourse and implored gradu-
ates to participate in their gov-

ernment in the way they see
most fit.
After severe thunderstorms
drenched Ann Arbor this morn-
ing and threatened to under-
mine some of the excitement
over the event, the rain slowed
to a drizzle about an hour out
from the ceremony's start and
came to a complete halt shortly
before it was set to begin. The
gray clouds overhead did linger
though throughout most of the
ceremony.
In attendance for Obama's
speech was a big crowd of
University and state officials,
including University President
Mary Sue Coleman, Demo-
cratic Gov. Jennifer Granholm,
University Provost Teresa Sul-
livan, University President
Emeritus James Duderstadt,
the University's current Board
of Regents and several former
regents.
Those on stage and in the
crowd alike roared when
Obama was presented with
his honorary degree and took
to the podium to deliver his
remarks.
As the president approached
the microphone, one person in
the crowd yelled out, "We love
you," to which Obama respond-
ed "I love you back."
Beginning his speech,
Obama described the current
political atmosphere by high-
lighting a letter sent to him by a
kindergarten class that includ-

ed the question, "Are people
being nice?"
"Well, if you turn on the
news today, or yesterday, or a
week ago, or a month ago -par-
ticularly one of the cable chan-
nels - you can see why even a
kindergartener would ask this
question," Obama told the audi-
ence.
And while Obama pointed to
name calling by politicians and
pundits and a media that high-
lights "every hint of conflict,"
he admitted that recent events
have largely contributed to the
charged political climate.
"The fact is, when you leave
here today you will search for
work in an economy that is
still emerging from the worot
crisis since the Great Depres-
sion," Obama said. "You live
in a century where the speed
with which jobs and industries
move across the globe is forcing
America to compete like never
before."
However, Obama added that
Americaihas had a long history
of partisan rancor.
"Since the days of our found-
ing, American politics has
never been a particularly nice
business," Obama said. "It's
always been a little less genteel
during times of great change."
Obama's speech then turned
from these challenges and the
toxic political discourse of
today, to what role graduates
must play to improve the coun-

try's democracy in the future.
"And now the question for
your generation is this: how
will you keep our democracy
going?" Obama asked. "At a
moment when our challenges
seem so big and our politics
seem so small, how will you
keep our democracy alive and
well in this century?"
While not wishing to offer
"some grand theory or detailed
policy prescription," Obama
did have three ingredients he
said he believes are necessary
for a functioning democracy:
a limited, yet adaptive gov-
ernment, the maintaining of
a "basic level of civility in our
public debate" and civic par-
d icipafion. rirrsA m r" ..'
On his first point, Obama
conceded that there has, since
the days of the Founding
Fathers, been a belief in this
country that government can-
not solve every problem facing
its people. But at the same time,
he said many believe that some
problems are too big for people
to solve for themselves, "some
things we can only do togeth-
er."
The president cited a series
of examples of the govern-
ment's greatest successes, from
the construction of cross-con-
tinental railroads to the cre-
ation of a system of public high
schools to the implementation
of financial reforms in the wake
of the Great Depression.

After the meeting, Robert
Kelch, executive vice president
for the University's medical
affairs, said officials will put
together a plan for the site's use
over the next 12 to 18 months.
"We don't know exactly yet,
but we will come up with a great
plan," Kelch said. "What this
does is unleashing the intellec-
tual capacity of the University.

Many of the laboratories are

will need to be renovated and
refitted.
The Pfizer complex, once the
largest taxpayer in the city with
a combined taxable value of $147
million earlier this year, will
come off the tax rolls when it
becomes a University entity.
Ann Arbor Mayor John Hief-
tje said in a phone interview that
he was excited about the poten-
tial for job creation resulting
from the University's purchase.
However, he said that losing
the tax revenue from the Pfizer
complex - which accounted for
5 percent of the city's tax base -

will only further complicate the
city's struggling finances.
"It'll be a serious hit. It'll be
a long time before the serious
benefits kick in." Hieftje said.
"On top of what's going on in the
economy, and then you have this
happen, it's going to make things
that much harder."
Hieftje said he would have
liked the city to have been
involved in the negotiations to
soften the impact on tax reve-
nues, which are vital to the city's
operations.
"The city (government) is 20
percent smaller than it used to
be," he said. "There will prob-
ably have to be further reduc-
tions. Almost surely. We've
already taken all of the easy cuts.
We're starting to get more into
the substance of what the city
already uses."
Speculation about the site's
future began in January 2007,
when the company announced
its decision to close the facil-
ity. At the time of the announce-
ment, Coleman and other
administrators said they wanted
to see private companies move
into the facility, but did not rule
out the University's interest.

Program cited
for five major
violations
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily News Editor
Nov. 4, 2010 - The National
Collegiate Athletic Association
has announced that it has placed
the Michigan football program on
a three-year probation.
During a conference call
Wednesday with University offi-
cials and members of the media,
Paul Dee, chairman of the NCAA
Committee on Infractions, said
the penalties from the NCAA
also include a public scolding and
censure of the University and a
stipulation that Michigan football
coach Rich Rodriguez must attend
the 2011 NCAA Regional Rules
Seminar. Additionally, University
officials imposed reductions to
the amount of time the Michigan
football team can practice - 130
hours in total through the end of
the 2011-2012 academic year.
Experts interviewed by The
Michigan Daily said the addi-
tional one year of probation on top
of what the University had self-
imposed didn't seem out of line for
the nature of the case. They also
said it was important to note that
the NCAA had downgraded the
charge against Rodriguez from a
charge that he had failed to pro-
mote an atmosphere of compli-
ance to the findingthathe failed to
adequately monitor his program.
The initial allegation against
Rodriguez that he had failed to
promote an atmosphere of com-
pliance, Dee said, was changed to
a violation of NCAA Constitution
2.8.1 because the committee felt
that Rodriguez failed to properly
oversee the program, not that he
failed to promote an atmosphere

of compliance.
Asked during the call about
what level of responsibility should
be placed on Rodriguez, Dee com-
pared Rodriguez to the captain of
a ship.
"The coach is ultimately
responsible, but that doesn't mean
that the coach is involved in all of
the activities," Dee said. "Conse-
quently, some of the things that
did occur did not get all the way to
the coach."
At a University press confer-
ence following the NCAA confer-
ence call, University President
Mary Sue Coleman said the Uni-
versity had taken the investiga-
tion seriously from the first day
and that she was proud of how the
University cooperated with the
NCAA.
"To the University of Michigan
(this) could not be more serious,"
Coleman said.
But Coleman made it clear that
such violations should never have
happened.
"They should not have
occurred," Coleman said of the
violations, adding that corrective
measures have been implemented.
Speaking at the press confer-
ence, Athletic Director David
Brandon said he was happy the
process was over and that he
wasn't surprised by the NCAA's
findings.
"There will be no appeals
because there's nothing to
appeal," Brandon said. "They're
majorviolations, absolutely. We've
admitted to them and we're mov-
ing forward."
However, Brandon stressed
that at no time was the welfare
of student-athletes put in danger.
Brandon cited a "very high-profile
story" reported by a local newspa-
per, which he did not name, that
suggested the football program
was putting student-athletes at
risk.

This is a big f---ing deal.

of the health care bill, as reported Tuesday by The Huffington Post.

Thirty-one classes later

A year after the historic election of Presi-
dent Barack Obama, the verdict may still be
out as to whether he's living up to expecta-
tions. But for voters in Michigan, this year's
Election Day marked another important
one-year anniversary - the state's approval
of ballot initiatives legalizing medical mari-
juana and expanding stem cell research.
While these progressive measures were
intended to provide relief for the chroni-
cally ill, they are affecting many residents
of Michigan in positive ways. A year after
their approval, positive developments are
occurring on both the stem cell and medical
marijuana fronts - and Michigan must con-
tinue to be a leader on these issues.
In last year's election, Michigan became
the 13th state to allow certain patients
with specific medical conditions to use
marijuana. With permission from a doctor,
patients gained the legal right to cultivate
and use marijuana to help relieve their
symptoms. But the legalization process has
not been seamless - with some users still
facing unjust legal repercussions - nor has
it provided a method for users to obtain
marijuana short of growing it themselves
or using approved sources. Supporters of
medical marijuana rallied in Lansing in
early October for clear regulations to make
use easier.
In addition to removing legal hurdles to
medical marijuana use, the state govern-
ment needs to make sure it doesn't fall
behind other governing bodies that are
beginning to adopt even more lenient mari-
juana policies. Marijuana usage should be
legal, for medical and non-medical reasons,

and public sentiment is slowly but surely
turning in favor of such a position. Indeed,
supporters in California are preparing to
launch a ballot initiative campaign call-
ing for total legalization. Even the U.S.
Justice Department is is shifting opinion,
announcing last month that federal officials
wouldn't arrest patients following state
laws regarding medicinal marijuana use.
Michigan is ahead of much of the country
in legalizing a safe, already widely practiced
behavior. But the state can do even better.
Michigan should continue to push the enve-
lope, allowing users to obtain marijuana
more easily and eventually aiming for total
legalization.
And while Michigan can be said to be at
the head of the pack on marijuana reform,
the state is even stronger on stem cell
reform. Last year's Proposal 2 lifted restric-
tions on stem cell research, instantly making
Michigan competitive with other states in a
promising field of study that has the poten-
tial to cure diseases and save lives. And as
a sign of the state's progress, Gov. Jennifer
Granholm announced on Oct. 15 that Detroit
would be the site of the 2010 World Stem
Cell Summit. The event will be co-hosted by
the University, Michigan State University,
Wayne State University and the Michigan
Economic Development Corporation.
One year after the passage of these ben-
eficial and progressive amendments, Michi-
gan stands at the forefront of important
social and economic changes. State policy
must continue to push the envelope on these
issues in the years to come.

Undsiguised Bigotry

Often, it's best to turn the other cheek in
the face of hateful ignorance. But when hate
speech is extreme and public, it must be con-
fronted. Andrew Shirvell, a University alum
and a current assistant attorney general for
the state of Michigan, has taken aim at the
Michigan Student Assembly President Chris
Armstrong almost exclusively because Arm-
strong is MSA's first openly gay president.
Shirvell's undisguised hatred for members
of the LGBT community has compromised
his ability to serve as a public official. Michi-
gan Attorney General Mike Cox shouldn't
be comfortable employing someone who's
bigotry so clearly has the potential to influ-
ence the work he does on behalf of Michigan
taxpayers. Cox must take decisive action to
respond to Shirvell's hate speech - and his
pro forma slap on the wrist this week isn't
going to cut it.
Shortly after the MSA election in March,
Shirvell launched a campaign against Arm-
strong. Shirvell started his blog, "Chris
Armstrong Watch," in late April. The blog
has railed against what Shirvell calls Arm-
strong's "radical homosexual agenda," as he
put it in his initial Aug. 29 post. The first blog
post also contained a photo of Armstrong
with "Resign" written over his face and a
rainbow flag with a swastika in the middle of
it next to him. Subsequent posts have labeled
Armstrong a liar, an elitist, a racist, a pervert
and a "viciously militant homosexual activ-
ist." Over time, the attacks have expanded
to include several MSA members who work
closely with Armstrong. Recently, Shirvell

has taken to showing up at events at whicb
Armstrong is present.
Though much of Shirvell's tirades are one
step from utter nonsense, his disdain for the
LGBT community is obvious. Shirvell criti-
cizes the LGBT community's push for social
equality in blanket statements that are plain-
ly offensive to everyone. Though offensive,
however, Shirvell's hateful remarks aren't a
threat to campus. The University community
recognizes Shirvell's attacks as what they
really are: the rants of a bigot.
Shirvell's increasingly extreme actions of
discrimination aren't the result of a lapse in
judgment. His behavior does not stem from
immaturity. It stems from hatred. And this
type of hatred makes Shirvell unsuitable to
remain a government official. It will affect
his ability to objectively interpret laws -
which is the job of the attorney general's
office. It's unacceptable that Cox hasn't
dismissed a member of his staff who is so
blatantly bigoted. A finger-wagging won't
change the fact that Cox has a responsibility
to employ a thoughtful staff that will fairly
carry out their jobs on behalf of the citizens
of this state. Shirvell doesn't fit this mold.
Cox shouldn't tolerate such offensive
behavior from someone who is required
to fairly defend the law. A scolding isn't an
acceptable response to the hatred that con-
tinues to be published on Shirvell's blog. Cox
must take serious action. He should remove
Shirvell from his position in the attorney gen-
eral's office.

the first time. Only 31 classes? I
must have taken at least 60 exams
during my time here. Putting it
this way, my college career seems
like an eternity. And yet it flew by
so fast that there was no time to
embed the experience of exams
into memory. All I know is that I
passionately dislike them.
So, I begin to ponder which
moments in time carried an emo-
tional energy strong enough to
make the clock stop for a moment,
to warp the space-time of my per-
ceptions, thus becoming a distinct
memory? Suddenly, images begin to
emerge, like comic book vignettes,
their combined narrative distinctly
disjointed. I begin to realize that
there isn't a single lesson or theme
that encompasses my past experi-
ence. In the words of Italian author
Cesare Pavese, "We do not remem-
ber days; we remember moments."
Eternal damnation
A few weeks ago, I took the time
to observe the religious extremists
that gather at the ofner ofState
Street and North University Ave-
nue on football Saturdays as they
listed the reasons why everyone
was doomed to eternal damnation
unless they changed their ways.
The group is composed of four or
five individuals who rotate between
handing out fliers and scream-
ing their diatribe. Passersby have
learned to ignore the crazy old men,
but occasionally someone momen-
tarily stops and observes them, as
if staring at gorillas delousing each
other at the zoo.
Something catches my eye - a
sign that one of the men is holding,
which claims that "whisperers"
are among the sinners doomed to
receive God's wrath. Suddenly, my
mind is transported to my child-
hood. My mom used to tell me to be
respectfully quiet and to whisper
when we went to the movie theater.
In hindsight, I should have retorted
by shouting, "But I will face eter-
nal damnation if I do as you say,
mommy!"
Amused by this image, I return
to reading the sign. "Well, I'll be
damned!" I exclaim, the irony of
the statement blowing completely
over my head. "Disobeyers of par-
ents," apparently, are also doomed
to eternal damnation.
The young professor
Flashing back six months, I find
myself in an economics class at 10in
the morning. This wasn't the class I
had wanted to take - my preferred
class had been cancelled due to a
professor's illness.
Then the professor enters. I'm
immediately captivated by his
audacity and energy. I also notice
that he's visibly nervous - has
he not taught a class before? It
wouldn't be surprising, given his
apparent youth.
A month later, I'm convinced

that this class is the best I've taken.
I feel bombarded with knowledge
and new insights, courtesy of the
young professor's unyielding wit
and humor.
Two weeks before the conclusion
of class, a friend of mine remarks
that the professor looks unwell.
Indeed, the professor is sweating
profusely and his humor is increas-
ingly infrequent. Then, one day,
the young professor interrupts his
lecture to show us pictures of his
young children. The pause is brief
and I make nothing of it.
The day of the exam, the young
professor doesn't show up to class.
My classmates and I are intensely
worried. Two weeks later, I receive
an e-mail from the professor,
thanking everyone in the class and
apologizing for running out of ener-
gy towards the end of the semester.
"Thankfully, he's recovered," I con-
clude.
Then, one seemingly random
summer day, I receive an e-mail. It's
directed to all students in the eco-
nomics class I had taken with the
young professor. "Sad news," the
e-mail reads.
For a whole week, I cannot shake
away my sense of loss. ISnow realize
that, outside of my grandmother's
and grandfather's deaths when I
was very young, I had never expe-
rienced the death of someone close.
Now that I can rationalize it, I come
to the conclusion that, in this case,
rationality does nothing but make
the experience worse.
Wakingup
A gust of wind blows through
the window and my daydreams
come to an abrupt end. I ask myself
why I always seem to recall the sad
memories first. Given that my years
at the University have been the hap-
piest of my life, I decide it's only fair
to also revisit the happier moments.
It seems impossible to do justice
to the task at hand, recalling the
happiest memories from the happi-
est time of my life - my years as a
Wolverine. Recalling the sad mem-
ories is easy because they are few
and far apart. But by what criterion
am I to distinguish amongst the
golden moments that collectively
make up the past three and a half
years?
As I begin to rewind the tape, I
realize that what has made the dif-
ference is the positive impact from
all the friendships I've made while
at the University.
Breaking out of the shell
During my sophomore year, I
realized the extent to which liv-
ing in Baits II housing the previous
year - as a non-engineering stu-
dent - had deprived me of the col-
lege experience. I never attended a
football game, I never went to par-
ties, I hadn't consumed a drop of
alcohol and I spent most of my Fri-
day nights writing essays.
The transition started with John
Hurlahe, a charismatic kid from
Frankenmuth, Mich., - a town I
was only aware of thanks to Bron-
ner's Christmas Wonderland, the
world's largest Christmas store.
We had begun studying together
for our economics classes, and
it seemed that by October, there
wasn't a day that went by where I
didn't see John for lunch or dinner.
And soon it wasn't just John,
it was also Ryn Kartje, John's

neighbor, hailing from the little
town of Milan, Mich. It was Alex
O'Dell, John's roommate, whose
mind was in a constant state of
creative stream of consciousness.

It was Orfeh Vahabzadeh, Alex's
girlfriend, simultaneously brilliant
and hilarious. It was the entire
Frankenmuth gang, along with a
light sprinkling of natives from my
hometown of Troy who had also
been engulfed by the group's mag-
netism.
By December, I had attended
several concerts. I made the hor-
rible choice of going to one while
wearing a ridiculous turtle-neck -
shoot me now and forgive me later.
I also had my first drink. "Yup, Ican
definitely feel it!" I exclaimed in all
my pathetic "lightweightness" after
several sips of a Mike's Hard Lem-
onade. I finally bought football sea-
son tickets and expanded my social
circle at an unprecedented rate.
The experiences
that have defined
my time at the 'U.'

They say that you don't realize
what you have until it's no longer
there. But my sophomore year was
the exact opposite - I didn't real-
ize what Ihad missed until good ol'
John and his gang danced their way
into my life, adding color wherever
black and white had been the rule.
Branching out
By junior year two new social
spheres emerged: my fellow incom-
ing classmates at the Ford School
of Public Policy, and my resident
advisors, community assistants and
ResStaff colleagues in Stockwell
Hall.
The Ford School crew - a driven
community of scholars who will be
doing great things in high places
while I will likely still be finish-
ing my dissertation - provided
constant intellectual stimuli. My
Stockwell friends - a group of
socially aware and service-minded
individuals who'll offer you sup-
port when you most need it - chal-
lenged me to embrace social justice
and to challenge the status quo.
And so it was that by the time my
junior year was over, I felt like I had
changed more in three years than I
had over my entire lifetime prior to
coming to the University.
Finally, I would be remiss if I
didn't mention the great relation-
ships I've had with my professors.
I was lucky enough to get to know
some brilliant scholars who cared
deeply about their students and
their individual interests. I attend-
ed conferences with them, chatted
with them about life over coffee
and received invaluable advice
from them regarding graduate
school. It goes without saying that
it's because I respect my professors
that I'm pursuing a career path in
academia.

Ditch the fish

Fish rarely seem like an aggressive adver-
sary. But Asian carp, an invasive species of
fish, are currently migrating north toward
the Great Lakes and could spell disaster for
the local ecosystem. But last week, the U.S.
Congress finally approved an act banning the
interstate transport of the invasive species to
stop further migration of the Asian carp and
protect the Great Lakes region.
Asian carp can weigh as much as 100
pounds and grow up to four feet in length,
according to the Environmental Protection
Agency. They pose a serious environmen-
tal and economic threat to the Great Lakes
region. The carp consume an inequitable
amount of resources, which would disrupt
the Great Lakes ecosystem by starving local
species like trout and salmon. This would be
a heavy blow to the $7-billion Great Lakes
fishing industry. Asian carp also pose a
threat to tourism, including the $16-billion
recreational boating industry.
On Nov. 30, the U.S. House of Representa-
tives approved the Asian Carp Prevention
and Control Act with a unanimous voice vote.
The act would regulate Asian carp under the

Lacey Act, a century-old bill that prohibits the
trading of banned or illegally acquired fish.
An Asian carp was caught in Lake Calu-
met in June, which lies past the electric
barriers currently set up in the Chicago Area
Waterway System meant to contain the fish.
The discovery occurred just six miles from
Lake Michigan, highlighting the need for
the federal government to act quickly to stop
further migration.
It's unacceptable that it took so long for
the federal government to act. Earlier this
year, Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox
and several other Great Lakes region attor-
neys general sought an injunction from the
U.S. Supreme Court to shut down the Illinois
locks. Their request was refused - twice.
Now that Congress has taken a clear stance
on the issue, measures to stop the carp should
be implemented immediately.
By signing the bill into law, Obama hasan
opportunity to protect the Great Lakes econ-
omy and environment by finally responding
to the very real threat that the Asian carp
pose.

The final statement
Despite my decision to attend the
University because of its academic
prestige, my Michigan years have
been defined by positive relation-
ships. The friends I've made here
have been an unwavering source of
support and have constantly chal-
lenged me to become a better person.
To my Michigan family, thank
you for shining happiness into my
life. I hope, in my own way, that I
have held up a mirror and reflected
some of it back.

Saying goodbye

How the Daily
became a freshman
film buff's niche
By ANDREW LAPIN
Daily Arts Writer
Had I not joined the Daily
freshman year, I doubt I would
have ever learned just how many
people on campus think it sucks.
Large swaths of students have
told me this over the past three
years, in no uncertain terms.
Often "The Daily sucks" is the lit-
eral phrase they use. "I only pick
it up for the crosswords/Sudoku"
is another common utterance.
"Why didn't you cover my fund-
raising event?" probably comes in
a distant third.
If you've said any of these
things, I have no desire at this
point in the game to convince you
otherwise. That's your preroga-
tive, and I'm sorry you didn't feel
we adequately served your needs
during your time here. All I can
say is that things look a little dif-
ferent from my end.
On a purely selfish note,
I would never have had the
opportunity to attend my first
film festival, interview the two
heftiest people in show busi-
ness (Michael Moore and Kevin
Smith, not to brag or anything) or

walk through the hallowed halls
of Pixar had it not been for the
Daily. But I didn't do this just for
the trips and interviews.
No, the true value of groups
like the Daily lies in the social
interactions. Without the Daily
as a common ground, I never
would have found an organiza-
tion of people who share my
obsessive urge to talk about
issues as seemingly trivial as the
critical respectability of Roger
Ebert or the number of pop-
culture references made on the
previous night's "Community."
And without those people at the
Daily, it's all too likely I would
have spent my time at Michigan
as an isolated, socially inept film
buff instead of as an outgoing,
somewhat socially accepted film
buff.
My iPod would also be miss-
ing half its library if I had never
joined the Daily, which is the true
test of lasting personal impact.
Now anytime I blast The Hold
Steady's "Sequestered in Mem-
phis" or K'naan's "Somalia," the
experience will be inexorably
tied to memories of dance par-
ties and mix CDs, the origins of
which can be traced back to - yes
- the Daily. This paper was my
impetus for most of what made
college awesome, just as I'm sure
activities like Dance Marathon,
club sports or Greek life were for

many of you.
Look, four years on a campus
like Michigan demands a well-
rounded experience. And you're
always going to leave wishing
you could have done more. I con-
sider myself lucky to have done
all I was able to, which included
exploding out of the Big House
tunnel alongside the rest of the
marching band for three foot-
ball seasons. But there was still
so much else out there I didn't
touch. The bucket list is bottom-
less. The more you do, the more
you wish you've done.
But the more you do, the more
you realize this was the place
for you. When I leave Ann Arbor
in just a little over two weeks
(holy shit!), I'll become just
another old fogey ranting about
how Michigan was better when
I was there. So will you. It's
unavoidable, like being mocked
at Blimpy Burger or Woody
Allen's annual flirtation with
mediocrity. And as much as I
dread that day happening, the
fact is that I still took advantage
of more than my fair share of
opportunities here. And maybe
you did, too.
Hopefully some Daily article,
at some point, resonated with
you. But if anyone asks, you'll
probably still say the Daily sucks.
Hey, don't look at me. It was bet-
ter when I was in it.

StarKid sequel
0 promises to charm
audiences again
By ADDIE SHRODES
Daily Arts Writer
May 9, 2010 - Even as its
members chat while lounging
on apartment couches, the cre-
ative chemistry of Team StarKid
pops. The group of past and pres-
ent University students who run
this theatrical production com-
pany fused together during their
early moments in college, and
their long shared history shows.
As the StarKids discuss their
highly anticipated "A Very Potte l
Sequel," the jokes never cease to
spark.
The idea for the original "A
Very Potter Musical" ("AVPM")
arose after years of the same sort
of joking about the "Harry Pot-
ter" book series, but friends of
brothers and writers Nick and
Matt Langnever thought the par-
ody musical would materialize.
After Matt Lang, a 2009 LSA
graduate, spontaneously put up
a poster for auditions last year,
Basement Arts picked up the
show, and the play was born.
Even though fans flooded Stu-
dio One to see the original Potter
show, when the team uploaded
the video to YouTube months
later it was still shocked by the
rapid fervid response.
"Without us even noticing,
thousands and thousands of peo-
ple started to watch this thing,"
said Nick Lang, a 2008 graduate
from the School of Music, The-
atre & Dance.
Act One, Part One of the origi-
nal musical now has over 1.5 mil-
lion YouTube hits, capturing fans
from across the globe. The team
was amazed because it didn't
intend for such a wide audience.
"So many of the things that
are funny in the play are because
they're inside jokes," said Bon-
nie Gruesen (Hermione), a 2010
MT&D graduate and the produc-
er of "AVPM." "There is so much
to enjoy about the musical, obvi-
ously...butit was funny to be like,
'Wow, these people are in on our
inside jokes now.'"
In retrospect, the group mem-
bers agree the musical has drawn
so much attention because it's
fresh and one-of-a-kind. It has
a fully original script, score and
take on Harry Potter charac-
ters. The musical follows Harry
and his wizard friends' journey
through Hogwarts while twist-
ing the novel's plot points for
comedic effect.
The popularity of the musical
quickly led Infinitus, a four-day
"Harry Potter" fan and scholar
conference in Orlando this July,
to invite the group to perform.
The team decided the best thing
to bring to Orlando wpuld be a
full-length sequel filmed at the
University's own Studio One.
After embarking on another four-
hour play, Team StarKid began to
feel the pressure.

Judd Apatow ushers in a
new era of comedic film
By JEFFREY BLOOMER r
MatgilgEditar

Sept. 7, 2007 - It's happened
quietly.
Two summers ago a surprise
powerhouse called "The 40-Year-
Old Virgin" opened in American
theaters, and week by week, the-
ater by theater, it built into one of
the year's most successful mov-
ies, let alone comedies. Though
another movie, "Wedding Crash-
ers," released a few weeks before,
far overshot its pop-culture infil-
tration and box-office returns,
the film was well-liked by audi-
ences and critics, building to $110
million on a modest budget and
propelling a then-marginal Steve
Carell into one of the industry's
most important comedians. It
was ahit, and more important, its
success came with an uncommon
wave of goodwill. People liked to
like it.
This is perhaps because the
co-writer, co-producer and direc-
tor of the movie is Judd Apatow,
a familiar name in the industry
who had in the '90s and early
'00s become the foremost cau-
tionary tale in the television
side of Hollywood. His beloved
series "Freaks and Greeks" last-
ed just 18 episodes, and his less
aggressively followed but still
well-regarded follow-up series
"Undeclared" was canceled after
just 17 episodes in 2002. The
shows were funny, good-natured
and often beguiling in how much
they understood about student
life and how deeply they under-
stood it. Even in "Undeclared,"
a sitcom, the usual grind of rush
week and other college-fiction
tentpoles became hilarious odes
to the faux-empowerment of stu-
dent groups on campuses. His
material is funny, but that's the
device, not the point.
In "The 40-Year-Old Virgin," a
movie whose title needs no expla-
nation, the hero isn't belittled or
even difficult to understand. The
big fight he gets into with his first
serious girlfriend is partially over
her treatment of his toys, and it's
not played for laughs. Though we
don'tunderstand his situation, we
understand his perspective. This
guy makes sense - we're never
laughing at him, or at least we're
never intended to - and that's the
chief appeal of Apatow's work.
This summer's pair of
"Knocked Up," which Apatow
co-produced, wrote and direct-

"Is that ... a double rainbow?"

ed, and "Superbad," which he
produced, proved not only two
of the most successful but two
of the most discussed movies
of the summer. "Knocked Up"
opened in June and has already
outgrossed "Virgin" by nearly
$40 million, and the more mod-
estly marketed "Superbad" has
amassed $94 million to date with
strong holdover every weekend
since it opened last month.
Audiences responded, predict-
ably for "Knocked Up" and per-
hapsless so for"Superbad," and so
did the filmcommunity. The sexu-
al politics and dance around abor-
tion in "Knocked Up" spawned
potent commentary from every
ideology and viewpoint. As critic
A.O. Scott wrote in the New York
Times, "If you haven't seen it,
you've been AWOL from the most
entertaining battle in the culture
wars, and if you have, you'd bet-
ter re-up before the really serious
fall movies start forcing you to
pretend to care about something
other than sex."
"Superbad," in contrast to the
bickeringover "Knocked Up," has
benefited enormously from Inter-
net buzz and become another
movie everyone loves to love. (On
IMDb.com, the film database, it's
alreadybeen voted the 120thbest
movie of all time.) The film, which
follows two childhood friends
about to head to college, is exu-
berantly filthy and almost giddily
unpolished, full of improvised
scenes and the unmistakable per-
sonal drive of its performers. The
film finds balance between filth
and sweetness, and it ultimately
morphs into one of the most hon-
est movies about male friendship
in years. It's participatory multi-
plex comedy with an uncontrived
message, a rare species in recent

mainstream comedy.
Contrast that with, say, "I
Now Pronounce You Chuck and
Larry," released in July, a movie
that believes it has an affirmative
message amid a string of jokes
lifted inevitably from stereo-
types. The Adam Sandler school
ofcomedylikethe fratpack (both
of which Apatow has dabbled in),
excels at this broad and repeti-
tive comedy, which is sometimes
funny but almost never reveal-
ing. These movies are successful,
but studios spend huge amounts
of money on name stars ("Chuck
and Larry" cost nearly three
times as much as "Knocked Up"
to produce and grossed consider-
ably less) when they could put it
into the creative minds that make
comedy worth more than the
moment.
To this end, Judd Apatow
has become a brand. Though he
didn't write or direct "Super-
bad," his mark is all over it, and
the expansive cast of perform-
ers (which includes the writers
of "Superbad") who recurrently
appear in his work indicates
that his creative philosophy has
formed contemporaries. As a pro-
ducer he has at least seven movies
in production or in development,
and so his brand of comedy, spir-
ited and intelligent and built on
original humor rather than nasty
archetypes, could be headed into
a resistance, and perhaps into a
new movement for mainstream
American comedy - movies
we like to like, that will live on
beyond the joke about the guy
with the funny accent.
It's said Apatow gleans his nar-
ratives from his own experiences
and temperament. Luckily, if his
movies are any indication, he has
a lot of friends.

'M' drops national title game in OT thriller

By CASANDRA PAGNI
Daily Sports Writer
April 9, 2011 - ST. PAUL,
Minn. - It was one shot mem-
bers of the Minnesota-Duluth
hockey team will remember for
the rest of their lives.
And one the Wolverines would
give anything to have back.
Just over three minutes into
overtime of the NCAA Cham-
pionship game, the Michigan
hockey team was on the losing
end of the battle. The Bulldogs
defeated the Wolverines, 3-2,
securing their program's first
NCAA title and sending Michi-
gan's seven seniors and the rest
of the team back to Ann Arbor
empty handed, all in a matter of
seconds.
"It's the opportunity of a
lifetime gone in the blink of an
eye," sophomore forward Jeff
Rohrkemper said.
While the outcome of game
came down to one shot by the
Bulldogs, the Wolverines had
more than 60 minutes in which
they could have controlled the
outcome. Minnesota-Duluth
out-shot Michigan all night,
but the resilient and defensive-
minded Wolverines continually
found ways to battle back.
Even when Michigan took
its ninth penalty of the game -
a boarding call to sophomore
forward Kevin Lynch with just
under 10 minutes remaining in
regulation - the Wolverine pen-
alty killers preserved the tie.

Junior tight end Kevin Koger said and vouched for Hoke as well.
he thoughtthe meeting was called Hutchinson came to Michigan as

a defensive lineman initially and
Hoke was his position coach for
that short time before he switched
to offensive guard - Hoke was the
defensive line coach at Michigan
from1995-2002 under Lloyd Carr.
And Hutchinson still stays in con-
tact with Hoke to this day.
"From everything I've heard
about (Hoke), you know, I grew
sip watching Charles Woodson
and Steve Hutchinson and Brian
Griese play and all of those guys
called Dave Brandon on their own
behalf and said this is the best
coach," Heininger said. "Steve
Hutchinson said this is the best
coach he's ever had - how could I
argue with that?"
Even with the high praise,
many of the players didn't know
much about the former San Diego
State and Ball State coach who has
a career record of 47-50.
Koger didn't know much more

about Hoke than where he had
previously coached. And Stonum
admitted he didn't know much,
either, but was eager to meet Hoke
on Tuesday.
"So far we know he's hard-
working, (and) he's all about
Michigan - he's a 'Michigan
Man,' " freshman defensive end
Jibreel Black said. "We want
somebody to come in, where the
atmosphere won't be so new to
him. He's been in the Big House so
we won't have to introduce that to
him. He knows pretty much what
Michigan stands for."
Brandon made it clear dur-
ing last week's press conference
announcing Rich Rodriguez's
termination that the coach's suc-
cessor would have to have an
understanding of Michigan and
the unique challenges the school
presents. Hoke also fit the bill
as the defensive-oriented coach

whom Brandon wanted to bring
in - an attribute that drew smiles
from the defensive players who
emerged after the meeting.
They were also happy that this
time around, unlike when they
heard about Rodriguez's fate, the
players were among the first to
hear about Hoke - instead of the
news breaking long before they
were told.
"It's weird watching stuff on
TV and not really knowing what's
going on," said redshirt sopho-
more running back Mike Cox.
"And then all of a sudden being
told about your coach not being
here. It's definitely better (know-
ing first)."
According to a source with
knowledge of the situation, the
players will meet Hoke sometime
before his scheduled introductory
press conference at 1 p.m. tomor-
row.

The Wolverines already have
a feeling that the atmosphere
around Schembechler Hall might
could revert back to the pre-
Rodriguez era - when the coach-
es were products of the building's
namesake.
Many in the Michigan commu-
nity thought the former West Vir-
ginia coach just didn't understand
the school's tradition. A common,
theme throughout the Michigan
players' reaction was that Hoke
just got it.
"We're really glad this is all
over," Heininger said. "(It's) like
this is a new start of what Michi-
gan always has been. And this is
the kind of coach you want. Dave
Brandon really did have a process
as he explained in there and he
stuck by it no matter what every-
body said. He wanted the best
person for us, and that's who we
got."

The sound of silence

'M' suffers historic
upset at Big House

CHARLOTTE, N.C. -
This wasn't a season that
could be captured in
still frame. It wasn't a
team that could be defined in 900
words. And it wasn't a moment
that anyone - not even Darius
Morris - had words for.
No, to
understand
what hap-
pened in that
moment, that
game, that
season, you
need to hear
to believe. CHANTEL
And few
will actu- JENNINGS
ally listen for
it, because
you would have to look for those
sounds in the unlikeliest of places.
You'd have to listen to the silences.
And no one is looking there.
Just like no one was looking
at Michigan before this season
started.
All that can be said, explained
and extrapolated about this team
and its emotions were heard in
those silences throughout Time
Warner Cable Arena yesterday.
It was the sound of silence as
the ball left Morris' hands and
arched perfectly toward the bas-
ket until that idyllic silence was
broken by the ding of the ball
meeting the heel of the rim.
But in that moment of silence,
there was hope - desperate hope.
The hope of a team of ragtag kids
who were under-recruited and
underappreciated. It was the hope
that the team, led by two Indiana
boys in black sneakers, has held
this entire season. It was the hope
of John Beilein as he leaned for-
ward, anticipating the exact result
he'd seen in practice so many
times when Morris took that same
shot.
And then came the ding.
There was the silence of the
aftermath. The silence of disbe-
lief. The silence that shook the
team to its core that comes with
a rude awakening, paralyzing the

brain. The silence that overtook
Tim Hardaway Jr. as he looked
up at the scoreboard and bit at his
uniform to fightback the tears.
Yes, the scoreboard read cor-
rectly, Duke won, 73-71.
"Everything went blank,"
Hardaway Jr. would say after the
game.
He heard nothing. Thousands
of Duke fans screamed as Mike
Krzyzewski notched his 900th
win, but Hardaway Jr. heard
silence.
Then there was the silence of
Jonathan Kirbitz packing up his
drum set for the last time. For four
years, he's been the Michigan pep
band's drummer, but when that
ding came, his career ended. The
band director looked up at his
band and asked the seniors to lead
the group for their final round of
"The Victors."
Kirbitz is graduating in May
and doesn't know what he'll do.
He wants to continue playing
music, he says, but it won't be for
Michigan. Unlike every member
of the Michigan basketball team,
he won't return. His career ended
the moment that silence did.
And then there was the
moment no one saw when Lau-
ren McLaughlin meticulously
placed a sticker reading 'Duke'
as the winner on the bracket that
hung outside the arena. It was a
placard that represented the Wol-
verines' defeat - perhaps the first
physical manifestation of the loss.
She attached the sticker and said
nothing.
Perhaps she expected to putthe
Blue Devils' name there, like so
many others, but the NCAA had
printed up Michigan's sticker as
well.
She wouldn't need to use it. She
carelessly threw it into the trash.
There was no rebound. That shot
was perfect and the crumbled
sticker layunused and silent in the
bottom of the can.
Right now that sound is the
silence that filled Zack Novak's
heart as he stood at midcourt
coming to the realization that his

CHANTEL JENNINGS/Daily
Sophomore guard Darius Morris puts up the last shot of Michigan's 73-71 loss.

junior season was over.
It's the worst feeling in the
world, like someone died, he'd say.
And then there was the silence
of the arena after the game, as
Morris reemerged from the locker
room and walked onto the court
where his season had ended less
than an hour before.
A handful of reporters and
maintenance workers fell quiet.
He looked at no one and walked
across mid-court towards the bas-
ket that may haunt him until next
season. With an invisible ball, he
reattempted that shot.
His right hand, with perfect
form, glided through the empty
space. His headphones jiggled
around his neck. He jumped off
his right foot and landed again.
Silence.
But the sound of the pros-
pects of next year's team roared
throughout the arena. A team that
will lose no one. A team that will
return with a chip on its shoulder.
A team that will no longer have a
target on its heart, but rather, on

its back.
And then a voice from the
upper deck broke that silence, just
like that ding broke the silence of
the ball rushingthose the air.
"Keep your head up."
Morris looked up and contin-
ued walking.
It will be what this team needs
to do. Because for now, there will
be silence and it will be a pain-
ful silence. It will be the sound of
people not knowing what to say.
Whether to apologize or congrat-
ulate a team that brought Michi-
gan basketball out of irrelevance,
if only for a few weeks.
It will be a silence that repre-
sents the end of a hopeful season
and a quiet March for Michigan.
Morris won't get that shot back.
But on Thursday or Friday,
they'll be back in the gym again.
And that silence that represented
so much, yet held nothing, will
be filled with sounds of a team
preparing to do work again next
season. -

Daily SportsEditor
Sept. 1, 2007 - Put aside the dif-
ferent subdivisions and throw out
preseason rankings. It came down
to execution. Plain and simple,
Appalachian State's 34-32 upset
win over No. 5 Michigan in Satur-
day's home opener, a feat labeled as
the greatest upset in college foot-
ball history, was decided on the
field.
"They just outplayed us," Michi-
gan tight end Mike Massey said.
"Theyexecutedbetterthanwe did,
and we had a lot of penalties that
hurt us too."
Appalachian State wide receiv-
er Dexter Jackson brought real-
ity home for the Michigan faithful
with his post-game comments.
"By coming in here and beat-
ing Michigan, it's a big statement
to represent every team that's in
our division," Jackson said. "This
opened a lot of doors for a lot of
teams."
Michigan's opener looked to be
their first step to a National Cham-
pionship run, but all it took was a
two-time national champion from
a lower subdivision of college foot-
ball - the Football Championship
Subdivision (FCS), formerly Divi-
sion I-AA - to dash those hopes.
"When you lose to a team like
that - they're a I-AA team - how
can you go for a National Cham-
pionship?" said Mike Hart, who
rushed for 188 yards and three
scores despite a bruised thigh
sidelining him for two quarters. "I
believe, personally, it's out of the
picture. I'm not going to give up
on it. It's in everybody else's hands
now."
The loss marked the first time
a team ranked in the Associated
Press poll, which started in 1936,
fell to a FCS squad. What started
out as just a scare turned into the
statement of the season, but not
for the team that had questions to
answer. Appalachian State entered

the Big House more hopeful than
expectant. The Mountaineer side-
line began to believe when Jackson
broke free on a 68-yard touchdown
catch on a simple slant pattern to
knot the score at seven with 10:55
left in the first quarter.
"That was. real big," Jackson
said. "That was big motivation for
me that we could hang with these
boys. So basically before that, I
knew if I made a play, it would be a
long day for them."
Numerous Michigan miscues
followed to give the Mountaineers
the edge. Protection broke down
when Appalachian State (1-0)
blocked two Jason Gingell field
goals, one a 44-yard attempt with
1:47 left and a potential game-win-
ning 37-yard try with six seconds
remaining. The Wolverines (0-1)
committed seven penalties to the
tune of 56 yards, including an ille-
gal procedure and a delay of game
that stymied two drives in Moun-
taineer territory. And Chad Henne,
the four-year starting quarterback,
threw an ill-advised toss across
his body that Appalachian State's
Leonard Love intercepted.
The natural order of college
football hierarchy appeared to
return in the second half. Michi-
gan stormed back to a 32-31 lead
with 4:36 remaining in the fourth
quarter after an inspired 54-yard
touchdown scamper by Hart.
But Mountaineer coach Jerry
Moore wouldn't let his team quit.
"The bottom fell out on us,"
Moore said. "What are you going
to do? You going to throw in the
towel? You going to cry that we
played hard and we gave them our
best? We could have walked away
real easy, 32-31, and everyone
would've said, 'Well, you played
hard.'"
The soft-spoken coach added he
said a short prayer following the
shocking win - an act many of the
Michigan faithful will imitate in
the coming weeks, if they haven't
already.
