Last 
winter, 
LSA 
student 
Alexandra Ellard had to miss 
10 days of class. Due to extreme 
weather, many Metro Detroit area 
public schools and facilities were 
closed. This meant Ellard couldn’t 
take her almost 2-year-old son, 
Oliver, to day care, and the road 
conditions were too dangerous to 
bring him along on the 40-minute 
drive to campus. She had no choice 
but to stay home. 
Ellard, who will be graduating 
this 
May 
with 
a 
General 
Studies degree, reached out to 
her professors. A few of them 
allowed her to attend their classes 

remotely, 
through 
platforms 
such as BlueJeans, Skype or 
Google Chat. But others, she said, 
threatened to fail her. 
“There 
are 
no 
protective 
policies 
for 
undergraduate 
students 
that 
protect 
them 
from attendance discrepancies 
when it comes to not having 
dependent child care,” Ellard said. 
One of the professors who 
refused to accommodate Ellard 
taught a class on gender and 
organization, 
which 
Ellard 
needed to graduate on time. 
After appealing her case to 
the 
Organizational 
Studies 
department chair and talking to 
an ombudsman, she said she was 
finally allowed to pass the class. 

“I had to fight to pass the class, 
and she still gave me a D plus,” 
Ellard said. “You find yourself very 
often having to choose whether 
to be a good parent, or be a good 
student, and that I find to be a very 
huge problem.”
According to Ellard, whether 
a 
student 
parent 
is 
offered 
accommodations depends almost 
entirely on the professor. Some of 
her professors have been helpful, 
even allowing her to bring her 
son to class when child care was 
unavailable, whereas others have 
not been as receptive. 
“I’ve 
had 
professors 
hold 
Oliver during class so that I could 
stay,” Ellard said. “I’ve had other 
professors tell me that Michigan is 

for the leaders and best and when 
I became a parent I forfeited that
opportunity.”
Sociology professor Barbara 
Anderson, who is collaborating 
with the University of Michigan’s 
Center for the Education of 
Women on issues surrounding 
student parents, said professors 
may not understand the situation 
student parents are in. 
“Some faculty see it as 
their choice to be parents, 
and I don’t think that’s the 
right way to think about it, 
and I don’t think it’s helpful,” 
Anderson said. 
The University does not 

Approximately 
50 
people 
came to Weiser Hall Thursday 
afternoon for a presentation 
from Levi McLaughlin, Toyota 
Visiting Professor of Japanese 
Studies. The Center for Japanese 
Studies and the Department of 
Asian Languages and Cultures 
hosted the lecture as part of the 
CJS Noon Lecture Series.
In his lecture, McLaughlin 
discussed 
the 
relationship 
between religion and politics 
in Japan. He is a professor at 
North Carolina State University 
and the author of “Soka Gakkai’s 
Human Revolution: The Rise 
of a Mimetic Nation in Modern 
Japan.”

Addressing 
the 
complex 
nature of religion in Japan, 
McLaughlin shared a personal 
experience he had visiting Japan 
a few years ago while staying 
with his friends’ parents.
“They had kept one room 
entirely for this huge, Buddhist 
altar,” McLaughlin said. “We 
were talking about why I was 
there and the topic of religion, 
and as he was replacing the 
water in the altar, he goes, 
‘We’re not religious,’ and I wish 
I was filming this because it’s the 
perfect example of what it’s like 
to talk about religion in Japan.”
He noted how religion in 
Japan ties into the public’s 
relationship 
with 
the 
royal 
family.
“Many regard some access 

to the royal couple as access 
to the divine and treat it as a 
life cycle,” McLaughlin said. 
“The events surrounding the 
emperor and the royal family is 
in a way, constituent of their own 
identities.”
Additionally, McLaughlin said 
there are other religious groups 
such as Buddhists, Christians 
and New Religions branched 
under the Liberal Democratic 
Party who impact politics in 
the country. He said these 
groups 
influence 
legislation, 
mobilize votes, create power for 
politicians and impact public 
discourse. 
McLaughlin also discussed 
specific religious groups such 
as Jinja Honcho and the Soka 
Gakkai. He said these groups 

have the power to possibly 
disrupt the government in its 
current state. 
Rackham 
student 
Sophie 
Hasuo, who does research in 
the Center for Japanese Studies, 
said 
the 
lecture 
challenged 
her understanding of Japanese 
national belonging.
“It complicated the whole 
religion and politics division that 
you can connect to other regions 
as well,” Hasuo said. “It brought 
a human centered perspective to 
a really complicated topic that 
only scholars grapple with.”
Allison 
Alexy, 
Women’s 
Studies and Asian Language and 
Cultures 
assistant 
professor, 
said the lecture taught her more 
about the interaction of politics 
and religion in Japanese culture.

In an effort to broaden public 
engagement, 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
Center 
for 
Academic 
Innovation is launching a new project 
support program titled the Public 
Engagement Faculty Fellowship. 
The new project will provide an 
opportunity for faculty — regardless 
of 
discipline 
or 
prior 
public 
engagement experience — to work on 
projects aimed at engaging the public 
with the guidance and support of the 
CAI and other units across campus.
The fellowship comes as part of 
President Mark Schlissel’s Faculty 
Public Engagement initiative, which 
he announced in 2017.
Rackham 
student 
Kimberly 
Ransom, who has done work with 
public 
engagement, 
noted 
the 
importance of work that involves 
people outside of academia. Ransom 
currently researches Black childhood 
in and around the formerly segregated 
Rosenwald Schools in rural Alabama. 
“I think public engagement is 
so important, particularly around 
scholarship, because it allows you to 
put research into action, and it allows 
you to use scholarship to bridge 
knowledge within academe with 
community 
knowledge,” 
Ransom 
said. 

Approximately 40 students 
gathered Thursday evening in 
the Samuel T. Dana Building 
to participate in a conversation 
surrounding the modern state 
of surveillance in Muslim, Arab, 
Southeast 
Asian 
and 
North 
African communities in the 
United States. 
LSA junior Fareah Fysudeen, 
MSA vice president external said 
the event and two accompanying 
events later this month are 
meant to cultivate responsible 
and effective action from the 
Muslim and Arab communities 
on campus.
“The most important thing is 
that we’re mobilizing Muslim 
youth in a way that’s informative 
and 
educational 
and 
deeply 
looking at the social fabric of the 
world around us,” Fysudeen said.
According 
to 
Palestinian 
Youth Group presenter Jenna, 
who requested The Daily not 
use her last name to protect 
her identity as an activist, 
colonialism and the subsequent 
Islamophobia it spurred has 
allowed a culture in which 
surveillance is accepted and 
normalized.

Rackham 
student 
Julio 
Ferreira 
is 
finishing 
his 
second year in the College 
of 
Engineering: 
a 
critical 
year for a PhD student. In 
a few months, he will need 
to complete his dissertation 
proposal. Lately, Ferreira has 
been 
feeling 
overwhelmed 
with the workload he needs to 
undertake. 
“I really like doing what I 
do, but I feel like I need some 
outlet or something,” Ferreira 
said. 
Ferreira, 
through 
his 
personal 
life, 
is 
familiar 
with mental health issues. 
On Thursday, he attended 
the Rackham Mental Health 
Task Force’s town hall for 
graduate students to learn 
what resources were available 
to him.
The town hall was part of 
Rackham’s wider efforts to 
address mental health issues 
among graduate students on 
campus. Registration for the 
town hall was at full capacity 
with nearly 100 attendees. The 
Rackham mental health task 

force first informed attendees 
about resources available and 
feedback it has received on its 
activities. 

Meghan Duffy, task force 
chair and professor of ecology 
and evolutionary biology, said 
many students are unaware 
of the support mechanisms in 
place. 

“One of the most common 
things we’ve heard is that a 
lot of people don’t know what 
resources are available,” Duffy 
said.
Duffy also noted students 
and staff do not know when 
to utilize which resources. In 
addition to informing students 
about the available options, 
however, the task force is 
looking to make improvements 
regarding mental health in 
three areas: Rackham as a 
whole, 
departments 
within 
Rackham 
and 
individual 
graduate students. 
This year, the task force 
will aim to identify specific 
changes to make at these 
levels and develop a plan to 
support 
identified 
changes,

B E HIND THE STORY

Every Friday, one Daily staffer will give a behind the scenes look 
at one of this week’s stories. This week, LSA sophomore Parnia 
Mazhar on her story “Hundreds gather for ‘No War On Iran’ 
demonstration”:

“I think the most powerful aspect of the event was hearing the different 
speakers. It ranged from students to veterans to faculty members, and 
each of them had personal experiences relating to war with the U.S. 
and the Middle Eastern region and you could definitely see the reaction 
of the attendees and the demonstrators and how much they resonated 
with the speakers.”

“It was really cool to see the hundreds, almost a thousand, people that 
were there, especially because it was very cold outside. It was in the 
afternoon/early evening so I’m sure that everyone had other things 
that they could have been doing so the fact that they chose to stand 
out there and support a cause they’re really passionate about was 
really cool to see and it definitely shows the power that people can 
have regarding issues, even if it is on an international scale, you can 
always exercise your right to protest.”

QUOTE OF THE WE E K 

“
I think that working-class people in the United States 
have more in common with Iranian working-class people 
than they do American billionaires. We should be standing in 
solidarity with the families, the innocent people who are 
living in Iran, who will die due to our government’s actions in 
their nation — our illegal actions in their nation.”

maintain statistics on the 
number of student parents 
on campus — many choose 
to not self-report, Ellard 
said, and the most recent 
survey information that is 
publicly available is from 
2005. The Center for the 
Education of Women has 
estimated student parents 
make up about 1.5 percent 
of the student body, with 
the majority at the graduate 
level, according to CEW 
Director Tiffany Marra. 
Nationally, 
student 
parents 
make 
up 
a 
significant 
population 
of 
college 
students, 
representing more than 1 
in every 5 undergraduates. 
About 
70 
percent 
of 
those 
student 
parents 
are mothers. Of the 3.8 
million 
undergraduate 
student 
parents 
in 
the 
country, 
approximately 
17 percent attend public, 

4-year universities like the 
University of Michigan. 
“Certainly 
there’s 
a 
large enough population, 
at the undergraduate level, 
even, where it shouldn’t be 
ignored,” Marra said.
Marra 
said 
student 
parents 
face 
large-scale, 
systemic 
challenges 
on 
campus, 
and 
their 
lack 
of 
visibility 
influences 
the 
way 
the 
University 
allocates its resources and 
offers support. 
“There seems to be a 
perception on campus that 
students here, their life is 
committed to just school, 
and that they don’t have 
responsibility 
outside 
of 
school, which just isn’t true 
for students with children,” 
Marra 
said. 
“They’re 
a 
hidden population. Being 
hidden, people don’t think 
about you first. They expect 
you to accommodate to the 
system that’s been built for 
the majority.”
According to Anderson, 
the University has been 
reluctant to take action 

on 
behalf 
of 
student 
parents, in part because 
the 
administration 
has 
little 
idea 
how 
many 
student parents attend the 
University and hasn’t taken 
many steps to find out. 
“They 
want 
evidence-
based programs, which is 
a good idea in general, but 
they don’t know how many 
there are and they aren’t 
being very innovative in 
finding out how many there 
are, so it’s kind of like you 
run around in a circle,” 
Anderson said. “They need 
to think about it more 
seriously.”
Anderson 
added 
the 
University has been active 
with its Diversity, Equity, 
and 
Inclusion 
efforts 
but tends to talk about 
identities students hold as 
separate from one another. 
“A lot of the problems 
and challenges people face 
are 
all 
interconnected,” 
Anderson 
said. 
“They’re 
related to older students, 
they’re related to students 
who 
have 
gone 
back 
to 
school, 
they’re 
sometimes 
related 
to 
race, 
and 
they 
are 
related 
to 
low 
socioeconomic 
status. 
You 
can’t 
effectively 
talk 
about 
all 
these 
things in isolation.”
CEW works closely 
with student parents, 
offering 
confidential 
counseling 
and 
advocating for students 
with 
children. 
In 
supporting 
student 
parents, 
one 
issue 
CEW 
focuses 
on 
is 
affordability. 
For 
the 
last 50 years, the center 
has offered a scholarship 
to students who have 
gaps in their education 
or 
have 
dependent 
children. According to 
Marra, CEW gave out 
about 
half 
a 
million 
dollars 
through 
the 
scholarship 
last 
year, 
and expects to disburse 
$600,000 this coming 
year. 
She 
estimates 
more than 40 percent 
of qualified applicants 

receive 
the 
scholarship, 
with an average award of 
$7,000 each. 
LSA 
student 
Kerrigan 
Fitzpatrick, 
who 
will 
graduate in May with a 
degree in psychology and 
lives with her daughter 
in Ann Arbor, said she’s 
generally 
impressed 
by 
the University’s financial 
resources, though she is 
unable to account for her 
dependent 
child 
in 
her 
financial aid applications.
Fitzpatrick 
said 
one 
helpful scholarship is the 
Office of Financial Aid’s 
child care subsidy. With 
the high cost of child care 
in Ann Arbor, however, the 
subsidy doesn’t quite make 
ends meet. 
“It’s such a huge help, but 
the only thing is it covers 
half a semester’s worth of 
day care, and for a day care 
that’s the cheapest I found 
in Ann Arbor,” Fitzpatrick 
said. 
Child care is a central 
concern 
for 
student 
parents, 
and 
isn’t 
easy 
to find. Ellard noted the 
Towsley Children’s House 
on Central Campus has a 
two-year waitlist and gives 
preference 
to 
graduate 
students. She agreed the 
child care subsidy has been 
a big help with paying for 
day care for her son, though 
she said last semester the 
funds 
were 
delivered 
a 
month late. 
The Office of the Provost 
also allocates “emergency 
funds” 
to 
CEW, 
which 
can be used to support 
student parents. Ellard said 
labeling these scholarships 
“emergency funds” on the 
Students 
with 
Children 
website 
is 
misleading, 
because 
many 
students 
might not realize it applies 
to them.
“The biggest problem is 
that financial aid for student 
parents is categorized as 
emergency aid,” Ellard said. 
“If I’m a freshman, and I’m 
a parent, I had a kid in high 

PARENTS

school, and I’m looking at 
that website, I’m not thinking 
that me having a child is an 
emergency.” 
In general, Ellard said it was 
challenging to find sources 
of financial aid through the 
University when she returned 
to school as a student parent.
“It 
was 
damn 
near 
impossible to get financial 
aid 
without 
making 
an 
unbelievable 
amount 
of 
phone calls and asking the 
same questions over and over 
and over again,” she said. “I’m 
really blessed to have parents 
who have helped support 
me and to have a boyfriend 
who can work and who has 
a degree and a full-time job, 
but I know there’s plenty of 
parents out there who don’t.”
The high cost of living in 
Ann Arbor can also present 
a challenge when it comes 
to 
supporting 
a 
family. 
Especially because child care 
is so expensive in Ann Arbor, 
Marra said many student 
parents may choose to live 
elsewhere 
and 
commute, 
adding 
stress 
to 
their 
academic lives. 
“Now they’re a commuter, 
as well as a student with a kid, 
which is now two challenges 
that can get in the way of their 
academic success,” she said. 
For student parents who 
do live in Ann Arbor, typical 
student housing often isn’t 
the best fit. Fitzpatrick, who 
found out she was pregnant 
between her sophomore and 
junior years, took a year and 
a half off, then found housing 
with three other women near 
Main Street after returning 
to school. She said the house 
was not an ideal environment 
for her young child.
Fitzpatrick now lives in 
family housing in Northwood, 
which she says is a better living 
situation for her daughter. 
Senior 
Associate 
Director 
for University Housing Amir 
Baghdadchi said Northwood 
IV and V offer family-friendly 
amenities such as multiple 
bedrooms, in-unit washers 
and dryers, school buses, 
playgrounds, 
community 
centers and close access to 
one of the University’s day 
care centers. One of the main 
benefits, he said, is a vibrant 
community of kids — there’s 
even 
trick-or-treating 
on 

Halloween.
“If you’re a kid, the action’s 
not at Stadium, you’re not 
going to do anything down 
there,” Baghdadchi said. “We 
want to make sure that from 
their point of view, it’s a rich, 
interesting experience.”
Though Fitzpatrick and her 
daughter have benefited from 
Northwood family housing, 
she said it’s difficult to pay 
her $1,200 monthly rent as a 
single mom. 
“It’s so nice, there’s kiddos 
running around, it’s so quiet, 
it’s an ideal family housing, 
but 
it’s 
so 
expensive,” 
Fitzpatrick said.
Finances 
aside, 
another 
major concern for student 
parents is balancing multiple 
commitments. LSA student 
Lyss 
Shumaker 
— 
who 
transferred 
to 
U-M 
in 
2017, took time off for her 
pregnancy, 
and 
returned 
in 2018 when her daughter, 
Violet, was 9 weeks old — said 
she almost dropped out. 
“It 
was 
so 
difficult 
to 
balance being a new parent 
and being a full-time student,” 
Shumaker said. “I remember 
being up in the middle of the 
night with her because she 
was still a newborn, and I was 
just studying stats.”
Shumaker, 
who 
will 
graduate 
in 
May 
with 
a 
degree in psychology, said 
extracurricular meetings are 
difficult to schedule because 
she’s taking care of a young 
child with her own needs and 
an early bedtime.
“Sometimes 
it 
can 
be 
hard for other students to 
understand the extent of the 
responsibilities,” 
Shumaker 
said. “For example, if we have 
a project that we need to work 
on, it can be hard to be like, 
well I have a one-hour slot 
here.” 
In 
brainstorming 
ideas 
for how the University could 
better accommodate student 
parents, 
Ellard 
said 
it’s 
important to confront deep-
seated misconceptions about 
what a successful Wolverine 
looks like. 
“I think it’s way more 
political 
than 
anything, 
I 
don’t think it really has to do 
with resources,” Ellard said. 
“I hate to say it, because I love 
U of M and I bleed maize and 
blue, but I really think it’s the 
stereotypical UMich snobbery 
of, ‘You have to be a certain 
type of person that goes here.’ 
They preach their diversity, 

but I feel like their diversity 
has a boundary.”
 
Building 
a 
community 
for undergraduate student 
parents

In light of the lack of 
sufficient support described 
to The Daily by undergraduate 
student 
parents 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan, 
students with children are 
advocating for their needs 
on campus, bolstered by the 
Center for the Education of 
Women. 
LSA 
students 
Alexandra 
Ellard, 
Lyss 
Shumaker 
and 
Kerrigan 
Fitzpatrick 
are 
moving 
forward 
with 
advocacy 
on 
campus, 
building community among 
undergraduate student parents 
and 
pushing 
for 
greater 
support from the University.
As 
student 
parents 
themselves, Ellard, Shumaker 
and 
Fitzpatrick, 
alongside 
other student parents, are 
focusing 
on 
expanding 
available 
resources 
and 

making sure future student 
parents 
feel 
welcome 
on 
campus. They are working 
to 
establish 
a 
group 
for 
undergraduate students with 
children. 
Shumaker said during her 
first semester she felt as if she 
were the only student parent 
at U-M. 
“There was no network of 
other student parents that I 
could reach out to,” Shumaker 
said. “When I transferred in, 
my adviser gave me a list of 
lactation rooms on campus, 
but that was the extent of the 
University’s support of me as 
a student mom. At that time, I 
felt very isolated on campus.”
The budding student parent 
group had its first meeting 
at the end of last semester. 
Shumaker 
said 
she 
hopes 
student parents will be able to 
connect and advocate for their 

needs together.
“As we find each other 
in the dark corners of the 
University, we’re trying to 
build a community,” Shumaker 
said. “We had our first meet up 
a few weeks ago, and it was 
small, but one of the goals that 
we’re trying to accomplish is 
just, let’s start with the stories, 
let’s start with the experiences 
of student parents and see 
where the needs truly are.”
Unfortunately, 
Ellard 
said, it can be hard to recruit 
student parents to the group 
because many are hesitant 
to come forward, and CEW 
cannot reveal names since its 
counseling is confidential. 
“Because 
of 
the 
social 
stigma 
on 
campus 
about 
having children, and the fear 
of being treated differently by 
professors and administration, 
a lot of parents don’t identify 
as parents because they just 
don’t want people to know,” 
Ellard said. 
Ellard’s dream is to launch 
a 
nonprofit 
supporting 
student 
parents 
at 
U-M, 

since the University doesn’t 
have a center devoted to 
connecting student parents 
with resources. She noted 
Michigan 
State 
University 
does. Ellard plans to start 
identifying potential donors 
next semester. 
Fitzpatrick and Shumaker 
are also working to secure 
funding from optiMize for a 
project with two main goals: 
student parent advocacy and 
child care support. Shumaker 
said 
optiMize 
has 
been 
supportive of their ideas thus 
far. 
The first goal of the project 
is 
to 
create 
a 
document 
outlining 
what 
student 
parents can reasonably ask of 
their professors in terms of 
accomodations. According to 
Shumaker, her professors have 
generally been supportive, but 
there are no formal guidelines 

detailing 
what 
academic 
support student parents can 
ask for. There is a policy in 
place for graduate student 
parents.
“It’s 
really 
up 
to 
the 
whims of specific GSIs and 
professors,” Shumaker said. 
“We’re really banking on the 
kindness of humanity at this 
point.”
Ellard said one area where 
the lack of clear guidelines 
stands 
out 
is 
child 
care 
emergencies. There is a backup 
child care service through the 
University, but according to 
Sociology professor Barbara 
Anderson, that service is not 
as immediately available as 
students would like. Ellard 
said it is often impossible to 
know what to do if a day care 
is closed and a professor is not 
flexible, for instance. 
“I 
can’t 
attend 
class 
remotely, I’ve had professors 
tell me that my kid’s not 
allowed in class,” Ellard said. 
“What are my other choices, 
besides paying for a babysitter 
out of pocket, which most of us 
can’t afford?”
Anderson said not only do 
faculty need more information 
about student parents, but 
student parents might also 
be more willing to ask for 
help if there were a center — 
analogous to the University’s 
Services for Students with 
Disabilities — to mediate and 
support conversations with 
their professors.
CEW 
Director 
Tiffany 
Marra said it is useful for 
students to know what is 
within their rights to ask 
of professors. CEW will be 
offering 
advocacy 
training 
as 
part 
of 
its 
academic 
coaching 
program, 
which 
will 
be 
launched 
within 
the next month and targets 
nontraditional students.
The 
second 
part 
of 
Shumaker and Fitzpatrick’s 
plan is founding a drop-in 
day care center on campus. 
Fitzpatrick said this day care 
would be very useful in the 
case of emergencies or late-
night events on campus. 
“Last winter semester, I 
was taking statistics, and the 
exams are from 7 to 9 at night,” 
Fitzpatrick 
said. 
“Having 
some kind of staff that could 
be there to watch our kiddos 
while we’re taking an exam 
like that, or if there’s a snow 
day and the day cares close but 
U-M is still open and we still 
have classes, somewhere we 

could take our kids.”
Supplementing the efforts of 
students, Marra and Anderson 
will be attending a conference 
this month through the Aspen 
Institute to learn about best 
practices for accommodating 
student 
parents. 
Anderson 
said they hope to gain a sense 
of the steps other institutions 
are taking.
Lastly, 
CEW 
and 
U-M 
student parents are discussing 
the possibility of allowing 
students 
with 
children 
to 
register 
for 
classes 
early. 
Shumaker said this would help 
student parents work out their 
schedules early on. .
“One of the things that I 
wish U-M would allow student 
parents to do is have an early 
registration period so that we 
could legitimately figure out 
our schedules in a way that 
works for us,” Shumaker said. 
Marra 
said 
early 
registration for undergraduate 
student parents would not 
place significant strain on the 
University, since there aren’t 
too many students in that 
category. 
“Given their responsibilities 
outside of school and the small 
population we’re talking about, 
it seems like that would be a 
reasonable 
accommodation 
to make sure that they can 
get their kids to child care, 
that they can choose classes 
that fit within their schedule, 
that they can make their work 
schedule work as well,” Marra 
said. 
As student parents at the 
University 
organize 
and 
envision ways to facilitate 
their work-life balance and 
build community, Shumaker 
said one of the most important 
points is for student parents to 
connect with one another. 
“I wasn’t sure that I could 
be a good mom and also be a 
full-time student, but I have 
been able to,” Shumaker said. 
“If there are other student 
parents 
out 
there, 
just 
believe in your power, but 
also look for other people to 
partner with.”
In general, Ellard hopes 
the University’s culture will 
shift to be more accepting of 
student parents. 
“If Michigan is for the 

leaders and best, and single 
moms and parents in general 
are some of the hardest 
workers ever, why are we 
not making this more of an 
atmosphere where parents 
are welcome?” Ellard said. 

New ESG festival features approximately 40 clubs, provides opportunity for recruitment

Engineers browse, learn about 
organizations at first EnginFest

The 
Engineering 
Student 
Government 
held 
EnginFest, 
a 
club 
fair 
for 
engineering 
organizations, on Thursday at the 
Duderstadt Center to promote 
interest in engineering student 
groups.
The fair consisted of about 40 
student organizations ranging 
from 
engineering 
societies 
advocating diversity in the field 
of engineering to professional 
fraternities. 
Engineering senior Hannah 
Leszczynski, president of ESG, 
said the fair was essentially 

Festifall for engineering students. 
She 
said 
the 
event 
enabled 
students to interact with student 
organizations pertaining to their 
engineering interests specifically.
“I was part of the center for 
campus 
involvement 
advisory 
board 
and 
something 
that 
was discussed was Northfest, 
Festifall, as well as Winterfest,” 
Leszczynskyi 
said.“I 
realized 
that we did not have a North 
Campus Winterfest, so to speak. 
The idea came about as to having 
something 
similar 
on 
North 
Campus as we do for Winterfest.”
Engineering junior Meredith 
Allen, ESG vice president, said the 
main purpose of EnginFest was to 

make recruiting easier for student 
organizations.
“I think that the main goal was 
to help engineering organizations 
be able to recruit for this new 
semester,” Allen said. “And I 
think it has been great so far – the 
tables have people signing up and 
there’s been a lot of traffic coming 
through.”
Some students who spoke to 
The Daily agreed EnginFest was 
useful in spreading awareness 
about 
Engineering 
student 
organizations. 
Engineering 
sophomore 
Joshua 
Goldstein, 
however, said he felt the fair did 
not offer much pertaining to his 
major. 

“I noticed that they don’t 
have anything related to IOE 
(Industrial 
and 
Operational 
Engineering),” Goldstein said. “I’d 
like to see stuff related to that.”
Engineering 
freshman 
Chimmuanya 
Iheanyi-Igwe 
told 
The 
Daily 
that 
having 
a 
concentrated 
group 
of 
organizations made the search for 
interesting organizations easier. 
“Last semester I didn’t go to 
one of (the fairs) and it made 
it really hard because it was 
overwhelming trying to figure 
out which (club) you want to join,” 
Iheanyi-Igwe said. “I think this 
gives more of an inner perspective 
of how (the club) works.”

Duffy explained. Next year will 
involve implementation of the 
task force’s decisions. 
Attendees participated in a 
group 
discussion, 
producing 
ideas 
such 
as 
wellness 
counselors for each department, 
training for faculty members 
and making graduate students 
more aware of what resources 
are appropriate for specific 
situations. 
Rackham student Sarah Bork 
studies engineering education 
research and is focusing her 
dissertation 
on 
engineering 
graduate student mental health. 
Bork said she attended the event 
to hear what students who aren’t 
normally engaged in mental 
health discussions shared with 
the panel. 

“I’m just eager to hear the 
voices of other students and 
perspectives,” Bork said. “I 
know a lot about it from different 
perspectives. As far as getting a 
concise graduate student voice 
from different departments who 
aren’t really as engaged … this is 
the platform for them to speak.”
Looking forward, the task 
force aims to collect data on 
mental health among students 
and to host more events to 
solicit feedback. Coffee house 
meetings and additional town 
halls are planned for the winter 
and spring semesters. 
Bork, who is also in Rackham 
student government and several 
mental health advocacy groups, 
plans to actively participate in 
these events.

“Islamophobia is a system of 
power and prejudice, and it’s 
not always necessarily against 
Muslims,” Jenna said. “It’s very 
racialized … mainly based off 
of physical characteristics, or 
perceived beliefs and perceived 
origin.”
Jenna said this creates an uphill 
battle in which Muslim or Arab-
presenting 
communitites 
are 
expected to reduce the pejorative 
assumptions around them by 
voluntarily inviting police into 
their communities. 
PYG presenter Jenin, who also 
requested The Daily not use her 
last name, explained how such 
behavior creates a “bad Muslim–
good Muslim binary” based in the 
notion of respectability politics.
“Respectability 
politics 
is 

the idea of presenting a political 
critique without showing any 
form of emotion, because as soon 
as you show emotion, you’re 
automatically seen as irrational,” 
Jenin said. “I mean, you can’t 
be reasoned with, because you 
can’t talk about critiquing the 
power structure without getting 
emotional.”
Jenin 
said 
painting 
Islamophobia 
as 
a 
“misunderstanding” 
that 
can be solved by outreach to 
greater society simplifies and 
undermines its power.
“Imagine we’re in a video 
game right now,” Jenin said. 
“We’re finished with Level 3 
and we have to destroy a huge 
monster, 
and 
this 
monster 
has a superpower: producing 
minions. We have to kill the 
minions, and all we’re doing is 
killing all the minions. It’s not 
being productive because their 
minions are endless. That’s 

exactly how Islamophobia is — 
we’re not actually tackling the 
source.”
Noting 
how 
most 
social 
movements borrow structural 
techniques from Civil Rights–
era Black nationalist groups 
like the Black Panther Party, 
Jenin stressed the importance 
of 
looking 
at 
surveillance 
techniques used in that period as 
well. She and Jenna highlighted 
the similarities between the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation’s 
Counterintelligence 
Program 
used during the Cold War and 
the Department of Homeland 
Security’s Countering Violent 
Extremism initiative.
In the 1960s, COINTELPRO 
advised agents to “neutralize” 
Black 
nationalist 
groups 
without due process for fear of 
their “propensity for violence.” 
According to Jenna and Jenin, 
CVE is the same program under 
a different name.

“These tactics we see are so 
prevalent, still present and still 
targeting the same people,” 
Jenna said. “(The targets) all 
challenge established beliefs on 
both domestic and international 
policy.”
According 
to 
the 
PYG 
presenters, 
COINTELPRO 
and 
CVE 
were 
successful 
because they forced powerful 
activist organizations to deal 
with internal power struggles 
following the assasination of a 
leader or amid an unnecessary 
legal fight. Both of these things, 
presenters said, drain human 
and monetary resources.
“The goal of surveillance 
isn’t just to collect information,” 
Jenin said. “It is to use this 
information to disrupt political 
advocacy.”

In 
collaboration 
with 
the 
Pickensville Community Center, 
Ransom developed a project that 
will document and collect oral 
histories of former students in 
the Rosenwald Schools. She said 
the project’s public engagement 
initiatives will help foster similar 
work.
“My goal is to be a researcher, 
but to also give back to the 
community, to have that research 
help the community in some 
way, but never taking for granted 
that the community also has 
something to offer, that the 
community also has knowledge 
to bring to the table, to tackle 
issues in our community and 
cities, nation and world,” Ransom 
said. 
The CAI’s new program aims 
to help public engagement fellows 
develop public engagement skills, 
connect with a community of 

public engagement professionals 
at U-M and develop innovative 
projects to serve the public. 
For this pilot year, the program 
will support nine fellows across 
various disciplines and career 
stages. Applications are currently 
being accepted until Feb. 3. 
The fellowship experience will 
be split between a one-month 
studio experience in May and 
a project support phase. The 
studio experience will allow 
fellows to interact with public 
engagement experts across the 
University in workshop, one-on-
one project consultations and 
mentorship from faculty. Fellows 
will also complete two short 
projects, including a written 
piece for a public audience and 
an 
experiment 
using 
digital 
technology. During this state, 
they will develop a project 
proposal.

Hegemon in decline 

I

n 1991, the United States 
enjoyed a global influence 
so vast it was unrivaled 
in human history. The Roman, 
Ottoman and Mongol empires 
would have marveled at the 
breadth of America’s political 
and 
economic 
leadership 
across the world. After the 
fall of the Soviet Union and 
Saddam Hussein in the First 
Gulf War, the U.S. established 
itself 
as 
the 
uncontested 
superpower in the post-Cold 
War era. 
America’s decline: The 21st 
century has seen a descent 
of U.S. influence across the 
globe. The U.S, which once 
created integral international 
institutions, such as the U.N. 
and IMF, reverts to isolated 
nationalism and the once-
trusted 
American 
military 
is forever associated with 
wars and cultural ineptitude. 
America’s 
geopolitical 
and 
economic decline is coming 
at a time when its leadership 
is needed most. Autocracy 
is replacing democracy in 
countries like Turkey and 
Venezuela, but the people 
of these countries can no 
longer look to the U.S. as the 
moral 
defender 
of 
liberty 
it historically claims to be. 
In October 2019, the Trump 
Administration bent to the 
will of the Turkish autocrat 
Recep Tayyip Erdogan by 
withdrawing 
strategically 
vital 
troops 
and 
gaining 
nothing 
in 
return. 
Has 
the 
U.S.’s 
power 
declined 
so far that it caters to the 
convenience 
of 
Turkey’s 
president for life? 
China’s 
rise: 
China’s 
economic boom has placed 
U.S. economic leverage — a 
favorite American diplomatic 
tool — in jeopardy as well. As 
China takes the lead on many 
major 
economic 
projects, 
countries become less reliant 
on the American economy 
for support and aid. The Belt 
and Road Initiative (BRI) has 
been dubbed a 21st century 
Marshall Plan after exuberant 
Chinese investment has gone 
into countries from South 
Asia to Western Europe to 

North 
Africa. 
Additionally, 
the creation of the Asian 
Infrastructure 
Investment 
Bank (AIIB) showed China’s 
disregard for U.S. power as the 
Chinese brushed off American 
dissent while gaining support 
from the U.S.’s Western allies. 
Despite U.S. efforts to prevent 
countries from joining the 
new international institution, 
there are 74 member countries 
and 26 prospective members. 
The BRI and the AIIB reveal 
that 
China 
wants 
their 
geopolitical clout to match 
their GDP, both of which will 
pass those of the U.S. if the 
status quo continues.

Rise 
of 
revisionists: 
America’s 
decline 
from 
hegemony 
has 
been 
met 
with a rise of revisionism. 
Xi Jingping, Vladimir Putin 
and Ali Khamenei consider 
their 
respective 
countries 
hamstrung 
by 
the 
U.S.-
created international system. 
Thus, China, Russia and Iran 
have lashed out against the 
current system with the goal 
of replacing it with a less 
democratic world order. Each 
of these countries have pushed 
back against the international 
order 
without 
being 
held 
accountable: Iran has bombed 
Saudi Aramco, Russia has 
invaded the sovereign nation 
of Ukraine and China has 
committed atrocious human 
rights 
violations 
against 
Uyghur Muslims. In 1991, it 
would have been inconceivable 
for the U.S. to watch these 
hostilities from the sidelines, 
but American power has been 
whittled down to a point 

where it can be disregarded 
by revisionists.
What 
can 
be 
done? 
Globalization has fostered the 
sentiment that discrepancies 
in 
cultures 
and 
countries 
lead to the illumination of 
staunch divides in values and 
beliefs. Of course, this is true, 
and the U.S. benefits from 
these differences more than 
any country in the world. A 
plethora of immigrants, belief 
systems and ideologies laid 
the foundation our democracy 
is built upon. However, the 
U.S. must realize that many 
of the moral values America 
stands 
for 
are 
objective. 
Liberty, 
prosperity 
and 
human rights are undeniably 
important 
ingredients 
to 
human flourishing that should 
be defended and advanced by 
the U.S. The dangers of moral 
relativism can be seen across 
the 
globe 
today. 
Uyghur 
Muslims, Syrian Kurds and 
Yemeni children are largely 
ignored by the world order 
and 
abused 
by 
immoral 
powers. If it is inevitable 
that the U.S. economy is to 
be surpassed and the military 
not as powerful, so be it. 
But America’s response to a 
multipolar world should be a 
retrenchment in our values, 
not an abandonment. The 
U.S. government can reverse 
its decline of influence by 
supporting the marginalized 
and giving them an ally in 
the 
international 
order. 
Diplomatic feats such as the 
Marshall Plan and the First 
Gulf War were accomplished 
through advocacy and defense 
of objective values, as well as 
a sense of moral obligation, 
not 
selfish 
ambition. 
The 
world needs an America that 
is willing to speak for the 
voiceless, feed the starving 
and stand for the oppressed. 
Without it, the world order 
could further descend down 
the path of chaos and violence 
that revisionist powers have 
already begun.

Iran and the legacy of Donald Trump
I

n the wake of Qasem 
Soleimani’s 
death 
and 
the responding remarks 
made 
by 
Iranian 
officials, 
many Americans are scared for 
what’s coming next. Articles 
are speculating on the looming 
threat of “World War III,” and 
social media is being flooded 
with content about selective 
service and the mobilization of 
the American war machine.
This may be the realization 
of the risk involved in electing 
President Donald Trump to 
office. The nightmare of the 
brash businessman recklessly 
waging war and the interests 
of the American people against 
a foreign power has come to 
fruition. Seemingly, launching 
America into yet another war 
in the Middle East will become 
Trump’s legacy as his term 
comes to a close.
This stands to be contested, 
as it is difficult to hypothesize 
about events we aren’t certain 
will occur at all. The question 
remains: Will going to war 
in Iran help or hurt Trump’s 
chance of being reelected?
Immediately, I want to think 
it will hurt Trump’s chances. 
Provoking a foreign power 
in a region that many within 
the United States believe we 
shouldn’t be intervening in at 
all won’t translate to more votes 
at the polling stations. Starting 
a war has to be Trump’s last 
straw, right?
It is not that simple to say, 
as 
supporters 
of 
Trump’s 
regime nearly seem to be 
blindly loyal to his actions. The 
effect entering into war with 
Iran would have on Trump’s 
presidency is so contingent 
on how events unfold that it’s 
difficult to speculate on what 
will happen. After all, there is 
no certainty to the events or 
duration of this hypothetical 
war. If war is avoided, is that 

a testament to Trump’s White 
House? If war is successful 
and short-lived, then is that a 
testament to the strength of 
the Commander in Chief? 
Per an article published 
by 
the 
New 
York 
Times 
discussing the exchange of 
threats 
between 
the 
U.S. 
and Iran, it is possible that 
Trump may have taken action 
against the Iranian General 
in order to distract from the 
impeachment 
proceedings 
occurring stateside. Congress 
returned from a long holiday 
break with the conversation 
diverted toward the new and 
seemingly 
more 
important 
issue of military action. It 
seems Trump’s involvement 
in Iran has been a successful 
ploy to get Congress and the 
media off of his back about 
impeachment.

In fact, Trump repeatedly 
accused 
former 
President 
Barack Obama of doing exactly 
this in 2011. In an article 
for CNN, Andrew Kacynski 
states, “In media appearances 
prior to the 2012 election, 
Trump repeatedly predicted 
that Obama would start a 
war with Iran in order to 
win 
re-election.” 
Kacynski 
explains that the drone strike 
on Soleimani is a way of 
waging war with Iran, and 
that in doing so, Trump can 
distract the American public 

from other issues surrounding 
his administration as we get 
settled into election season.
Given this, it would seem 
that Trump saw the logic 
behind 
the 
motivation 
he 
suspected from former Obama. 
With Trump’s administration 
being at risk of losing office, it 
would seem that starting a war 
with Iran could potentially 
bolster nationalism and a sense 
of strength in the executive 
branch, as well as distract from 
the impeachment proceedings 
facing Trump.
It’s 
difficult 
to 
believe 
starting a war would increase 
the popularity of a president 
who 
is 
already 
widely 
contested. While it may be 
Trump’s 
intention 
to 
levy 
support 
through 
war, 
it’s 
not certain it will play out 
according to plan. However, 
Trump 
remains 
untested 
during war time (a quality 
that I prefer the president to 
keep throughout their term), 
and thus the world may meet 
General Trump for the first 
time: results TBD.
Ultimately, 
Trump’s 
escalation 
of 
the 
tension 
between Iran and the U.S. will 
hurt him during the election 
cycle because his actions are 
so unwarranted. Trump isn’t 
going to bolster a high approval 
rating for waging war with Iran 
because the action against Iran 
comes as such a shock to both 
Congress and the American 
people, and it isn’t in response 
to a clear, defined event or 
issue. Whether this conflict 
progresses 
into 
full-blown 
war or not, Trump’s outward 
actions of hostility and the 
provoking of a foreign power 
may not translate into the votes 
he wants come November.

The best and worst of the decade for women

T

oward 
the 
end 
of 
the year, I got many 
notifications 
for 
opinion 
pieces 
reviewing 
the best movies, books and 
pop 
culture 
moments 
of 
the 
decade. 
Something 
I 
haven’t read enough about is 
the little progress made in 
narrowing the gender gap in 
the past decade. Don’t get me 
wrong, the gender equality 
movement has made many 
great improvements, but that 
progress has stagnated and 
leveled off in many aspects. 
With 
the 
2020 
election 
drawing 
closer, 
attention 
should be drawn to the issues 
of sexual violence and the 
gender wage gap to prompt 
dialogues with policymakers 
and voters. 
The 
2010s 
saw 
many 
milestones for women. In the 
past 
year 
Greta 
Thunberg 
spoke about climate change, 
Simone Biles set gymnastics 
world records and scientist 
Katie 
Bouman 
captured 
the 
first-ever 
image 
of 
a 
black hole. This decade also 
saw the evolution of mass 
communication 
and 
social 
media platforms like Twitter, 
which has arguably become 
one of the most informative 
platforms 
today. 
This 
has 
helped social movements not 
only 
gain 
momentum, 
but 
also 
reshape 
the 
dialogue 
surrounding issues such as 
sexual 
and 
gender-based 
violence. 
The 
#MeToo 
movement 
that gained traction a few 
years ago brought awareness 
to the issue of workplace 
harassment, 
especially 
among 
congressional 
aides 
and women in Hollywood, 
prompting 
a 
legislative 
response 
by 
Congress. 
These responses include the 
Congressional Accountability 
Act of 1995 Reform Act and 
the 
BE 
HEARD 
Act 
that 
strengthened protections for 
victims and held perpetrators 
liable. 

In 
an 
open 
letter 
to 
presidential candidates, debate 
moderators and the media, 
#MeToo 
demanded 
“real 
solutions” from presidential 
candidates 
during 
the 
November 2019 Democratic 
debate, especially since there 
have been “zero questions about 
sexual harassment policy out 
of over 4,000 debate questions 
in two decades.” #MeTooVoter 
was introduced as a way for 
voters to show support for an 
agenda that centered around 
accountability 
policies 
and 
reforms. Voters and supporters 
tweeted about the debate’s all-
female moderator panel. The 
message invited policymakers 

to work together with debate 
moderators 
and 
media 
organizations to address the 
systemic issues that prevent 
sexual violence accountability 
from 
institutions 
and 
communities. 
Social 
movements 
have 
reshaped the dialogue around 
issues such as sexual violence, 
but they fail to bring into 
attention that this past decade 
has seen slow improvement 
in 
the 
gender 
wage 
gap. 
According to the Institute for 
Women’s 
Policy 
Research, 
from 2008 to 2017 “the weekly 
gender wage gap narrowed by 
just 2.0 percentage points.” 
The gender wage gap has 
persisted 
due 
to 
factors 
like 
gender 
discrimination, 
workplace 
harassment 
and 
work 
experience. 
This 
is 
clear in sports, where only 40 
percent of women’s college 

teams and about three percent 
of men’s college teams are 
coached by women, and higher 
administrative 
leadership 
roles are male-dominated.
However, 
the 
current 
gender wage gap is narrower 
among 
young 
adults 
than 
among workers overall. In 
fact, countries like Britain 
have 
recently 
pledged 
to 
increase 
female 
leadership 
in 
their 
largest 
publicly-
traded 
companies 
to 
30 
percent. 
Despite 
a 
steady 
narrowing 
of 
the 
gender 
gap and the empowerment 
of young women, there has 
been too little action taken by 
policymakers to address this 
problem in the past decade. 
Women’s issues need to be 
brought to the attention of 
policymakers by young voters, 
especially as our generation 
joins the workforce.
To address gender equality 
in the coming decade, UN 
Women 
has 
mobilized 
governments and communities 
to commit to its Generation 
Equality campaign. Generation 
Equality 
aims 
to 
achieve 
equality for every person — not 
just women — through small 
actions that have big impacts. 
It invites people to read and 
learn more about different 
issues with monthly action 
packs, 
weekly 
newsletters, 
infographics, 
slogans, 
GIFs 
and various toolkits on social 
media platforms like Twitter 
and Instagram. 
Using 
movements 
and 
campaigns like #MeTooVoter 
and 
#GenerationEquality, 
we can invite policymakers 
to have discussions about 
the gender wage gap, sexual 
violence and the lack of female 
leadership. Communities of 
young voters can utilize social 
media, the most powerful 
tool in our toolkits, to learn, 
inform and spread awareness 
to start the conversation.

In my memory, Winter Break 2019 will 
always be defined by “Star Wars: The Rise 
of Skywalker.” While I watched some (far 
superior) movies like “Little Women” and 
“Knives Out” during this holiday season, my 
brain still can’t let “Skywalker” go. 
It’s a beautifully crafted, wonderfully 
performed, roller coaster ride of a waste of 
time. While there are imaginative planets 
and exciting battles aplenty, the movie is 

crushingly soulless. It lacks what makes 
the Star Wars movies worth watching — a 
heart. Every other film in the saga, even the 
prequels, had at least one character whose 
motivations, successes and defeats meant 
something, or at least could be understood 
on basic emotional terms. “The Rise of 
Skywalker” does not. Its screenwriters 
forced a resurrected Emperor Palpatine into 
the story, and the personal conflicts built up 
during the first two movies are sidelined, 
altered or ignored to accomodate a villain 
never meant to be in the trilogy in the first 
place. Palpatine is only there for nostalgic 
purposes, and his rise takes the entire film 
down. 
Yet, while “Star Wars” stumbled, two other 
smash hits from this holiday season, “Knives 
Out” and “Little Women,” blazed a new way 
forward. They took well-worn, nostalgic 
blueprints, like Agatha Christie mysteries 
and a classic novel, and updated them with 
emotive characters and prescient topics. 
Nostalgia has its place, and it can add a touch 
of familiar flavor to movies whose main 
concerns are affecting plots and believable 
characters. “The Rise of Skywalker” shows, 
though, that it should never, ever, be the full 
meal. 

—Andrew Warrick, Daily Arts Writer

As someone who grew up with an older 
sister who was determined to be a spy, I’m 
not sure why it took so long for me and my 
family to watch the James Bond movies 
starring Daniel Craig (“Knives Out”). But 
we gave it a shot over winter break, and, 
to no one’s surprise, we loved them. I’m 
not sure why we liked them as much as we 
did, especially considering “Casino Royale” 
consisted mostly of an hour-long poker game 
that I only half understood and yet was 
completely enthralled by. 

The plots didn’t always make sense (I 
still don’t really know what happened in 
“Quantum of Solace,” if I’m being honest), 
but I feel like with James Bond, the action 
is what matters most anyways. James Bond’s 
stunts — a lot of which were performed by 
Craig himself — were amazingly done and 
often had us rewinding the DVD to see 
them again. “Skyfall” was by far my favorite 
installment, though, mostly because we 
finally got to see more of M (Judi Dench, 
“Shakespeare in Love”). When the new 
movie comes out in April, I know for a fact 
that my family will be first in line to watch 
007 kick butt again. 

—Sabriya Imami, Daily Arts Writer

Aside from the milquetoast mediocrity of 
“Bombshell” and the nonsensical wormhole 
of a Star Wars movie, I filled my break with 
films released earlier in the year that I had 
missed out on. One was “High Life,” which 
I found to be one of the most legitimately 
compelling and tragically under-discussed 
movies released in 2019. Claire Denis’ ability 
to tell a harrowing human drama without the 
constraints of linear storytelling is a glorious 
thing to behold. While the film’s quiet 
conversations 
and 
symbolism-drenched 
imagery lent themselves to a slow pace, I 

was never truly bored. The movie also made 
me realize the largely untapped potential of 
arthouse actress Mia Goth (“Suspiria”). 
Another 2019 catch-up movie I saw over 
break was Johanna Hogg’s (“Unrelated”) 
 
autobiographical feature, “The Souvenir.” 
It follows a young film student as she gets 
involved 
with 
a 
heroin-addicted 
older 
man. Nothing about the film’s plot makes 
conventional sense — it is nearer to a living, 
breathing diary of Julie’s life (Honor Swinton 
Byrne, “I Am Love”) than a story. But Hogg 
enforces an unwavering subjectivity around 
the film, placing a viewer so unquestioningly 
in Julie’s perspective that all her decisions 
seem inevitable more than unwise. We are 
not here to judge Julie, and by extension 
Hogg. We are fascinated but powerless 
observers. I have never before seen a film 
that wraps you up as completely in its own 
intimacy as “The Souvenir” does. It’s why I 
watch movies. 

—Anish Tamhaney, Daily Film Editor

What our film writers 
watched over the break

In honor of Ramy Youssef receiving the award for 
Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series - 
Musical or Comedy at the 77th Annual Golden Globe 
Awards, The Daily is rerunning an interview with 
him.
***
Despite the countless positives associated with 
the recent surge in representation within our media 
landscape, it is easy to be lulled into a false sense 
of accomplishment. The mere presence of diverse 
faces does not mean that the seemingly never-
ending journey toward parity has been completed.
That’s right, whites. Put your pussy hats back on, 
this party’s far from being over. Currently, to be a 
person of color with a platform in the media, your 
visibility comes at the cost of your individualism. 
The beast of fame is indiscriminate in its scrutiny 
of those in the public eye, but only those from 
marginalized groups know the fatiguing extent to 
which their identities amplify this magnification. 
In the same way that the only Black kid in class is 
expected to retain a doctorate in American slavery 
by middle school, creators of color are expected to 
use their projects to speak for an entire community.
Part of this stems from a longstanding legacy 
of underrepresentation. When a people has been 
deprived of representation for — well — forever, 
each starved member has ample time to dream 
up their own unique expectations that one show 
cannot possibly satisfy. This pattern also stems 
from the long-established normalization of the 
privileged, and the resultant “othering” of everyone 
who does not meet a certain criterion. Even shows 
featuring niche sects within privileged groups, take 
Irish Catholics for instance, avoid the expectation 
to speak for all members of the community. This is 
because, as Ramy Youssef (“Mr. Robot”), creator of a 
new, self-titled Hulu show, pointed out in his group 
interview with The Michigan Daily, privileged 
groups have historically been afforded the right to 
nuance. Marginalized groups? Not so much.
Ramy Youssef is out to combat this norm.
To the untrained eye, “Ramy” appears to be 
yet another vehicle for a stand-up comedian too 
lazy to think up a title for a show loosely based on 
themselves. There’s been “Seinfeld,” “Roseanne,” 
“Ellen” and even (yes, I’m bringing it up) “Mulaney.” 
Only this time, the old trick comes with a layer of 
complexity unfounded in its predecessors: “I think 
it’s really important to have people authentically 
being themselves. And I think, for me, my approach 
in calling the show ‘Ramy’ was to highlight from the 
beginning that this is just one Arab-Muslim story.”
In developing “Ramy,” Youssef made it his 
mission to create a show with subtleties usually 
only reserved for white, presumably Christian 

characters. In doing so, he has forged a path for 
future creators of color who dream of a day when 
their identities can be present in their work without 
overshadowing the actual story, or at the very 
least, express themselves in their work without the 
constant anxiety of appeasing everyone within a 
community.
Produced by A24, “Ramy” is now kin to some 
of the most talked-about coming-of-age stories 
of recent years: “Lady Bird,” “mid90s,” “Eighth 
Grade,” the list goes on. Although this is exceptional 
company to be in, I had to wonder, in addition to 
centering on an Arab-American man, how else does 
“Ramy” distinguish itself as a narrative from the 
seemingly never-ending stream of projects falling 
under the category of Confused Millennial Finding 
Him/Her/Their selves™? Youssef’s answer was 
unexpected to say the least. And not just because 
genteel women never discuss it during dinner.
Religion.
Make no mistake — Youssef, dressed as though 
he could have just clocked out from a long day at 
VICE News, is not out to convert the masses or 
spread the word of how “cool” religion can be like 
a cargo short-clad youth group leader. His aim 
in emphasizing religion in his passion project is 
merely to shed a light on the crossroads he has been 
met with throughout his life in attempting to own 
his faith while willingly participating in aspects of 

secularity.
While most comedies geared towards the coveted 
18-34 demographic evade discussing religion 
in an earnest way and feature characters either 
ambivalent toward or outwardly disinterested in 
any element of faith, “Ramy” attempts to bridge this 

divide by crafting a nuanced depiction of a man who 
is not attempting to escape his religion and culture, 
but, on the contrary, to “be his best spiritual self.” 
A distinction that is on display from the onset of 
the series, in the first episode alone, fictional Ramy 
Hassan must have an awkward conversation with 
his hookup regarding her misconceptions about his 
faith. She assumed he was “culturally Muslim” in 
the same way that she was “culturally Jewish.” She 
was incorrect. I couldn’t help but picture the scene 
as a meta exchange between Youssef himself and 
other popular coming-of-age comedies of today.
Comedy and religion are an odd couple of sorts 
— with their only successful merger to date being 
the archaic setup for jokes about a rabbi and a priest 
inexplicably sharing a drink at Applebee’s. Youssef 
is not blind to this reality, reasoning that, “church, 
the mosque, the temple … whatever are almost 
always the punchline.” As much as I like to perceive 
millennials and Generation Z as a hold-no-punches 
bunch, shying away from no topic too taboo, I had to 
wrangle with the possibility that maybe we did avoid 
religion like Christmas Eve mass. Just because I am 
a disillusioned Catholic (read: only stuck around 
for the wine, then bounced), does that mean that 
I cannot appreciate a show about someone else’s 
relationship to their faith? My fear in beginning 
Youssef’s series with this in mind was that it would 
be akin to the Christian movies they showed at my 
Catholic middle school: preachy, poorly acted and 
(maybe?) with an arc related to high school football.
It would be an understatement to say that this is 
not “Ramy” in the slightest. No spoilers: There’s a 
condom full of water, a cringe-inducing car makeout 
and hookah. There are clearer traces of “Atlanta” 
inherent in “Ramy” than the Catholic school staple, 
“Facing the Giants.”
Rather than being a hindrance to my enjoyment, 

Youssef’s exploration of religion provided for a 
compelling internal struggle that was refreshing to 
see. In discussing the possibility of renewal by Hulu, 
Ramy and co-star Dave Merheje (“Mr. D”) both 
expressed high hopes for a second season. With 
commercial and critical praise continuing to pour 
in for the show, this appears to be a very plausible 
matter. And for Youssef, who was credited with 
penning about half of the first season’s episodes, he 
shows no signs of writer’s block: “The importance 
[of “Ramy”] lies in that we get to highlight that you 
can be very specific and do ten episodes in a season 
and there’s still so much that hasn’t been touched. 
And I think if there’s anything that is important 
about (this), it’s that. We get to highlight how 
hyperspecificity is a wealth of story and probably 
profitable too.”

POLITICS AND PROSE

BOOK REVIEW
Revisiting 2019’s darling:
Atwood’s ‘The Testaments’

three of the women it gives voice to are intricately 
and permanently bonded to Offred, and this bond is a 
central catalyst for the decisions they end up making. 
So, I’m going to compare “The Testaments” to 

“The Handmaid’s Tale.” I think I have to. And, as I 
contemplate their differences, I’m more and more 
aware of the inferiority of “The Testaments” in 
nearly every respect. For one, its prose, in relation 
to “The Handmaid’s Tale” at least, is unrefined 
and often unconvincing. One narrator in particular 
utters lines so unnatural, so cringeworthy I could 
hardly stomach them (“I am fucking sorry, but we are 

in a hot mess emergency here!”). At certain points it 
reads like a young adult novel, which certainly isn’t 
detrimental in and of itself but feels completely out 
of place in the context of its predecessor.
Simply put, this kind of writing belongs nowhere 
near a Booker Prize, and it certainly wouldn’t be in 
the running for the award if it weren’t the brainchild 
of Margaret Atwood. A more glaring and upsetting 
criticism, though, and what may just be the book’s 
fatal flaw, is the superficial and stereotypical 
characterization of its narrators Atwood opts for. 
All three narrators are two-dimensional, archetypal 
embodiments of the cultures they come from, and 
there simply aren’t enough pages in this plot-heavy 
novel to flesh them out further. These women deserve 
more. They each deserve a novel of their own.
I don’t want to sound like I despise this book. 
I don’t in the slightest. “The Testaments” is an 
addictive read with an uplifting (albeit slightly 
unearned) resolution. I admire its ambition, its 
aspiration to give voice to as many women as 
possible. Most importantly, it doesn’t make me love 
“The Handmaid’s Tale” any less. Ultimately, though, 
if I do decide to return to Gilead, it won’t be by way of 
“The Testaments.”

ELISE GODFRYD
Daily Arts Writer

In light of Margaret Atwood’s recent acceptance of 
the 2019 Booker Prize and Goodreads Choice Awards 
for Fiction with “The Testaments,” we are revisiting 
one of our writer’s review of the highly acclaimed 
novel. 
***
As I read “The Testaments,” Margaret Atwood’s 
latest Booker Prize-nominated novel, I was reminded 
of a case study of Darwin’s finches I learned about in 
an anthropology class I took last year. Throughout 
the 1970s, biologists Peter and Rosemary Grant 
observed the finch population of the Galápogos 
Islands. As a result of a severe drought that radically 
changed the food supply available to the finches, 
natural selection worked to alter the makeup of 
the population in response to the demands of this 
new environment, resulting in the production of 
a completely different species of bird. The Grants 
disproved Darwin’s belief that evolution needed 
hundreds or thousands of years to significantly 
change a population — in some cases, it only needs a 
few years to create astounding change. 
When it comes to Atwood’s “The Testaments,” 
it’s arguable that things line up with the Grants’s 
story quite well — only the novel’s characters are 
the finches, and Gilead is the drought. In “The 
Testaments,” we learn that Gilead, the apocalyptic 
and theocratic dystopia of Atwood’s modern classic 
“The Handmaid’s Tale,” has continued its reign 
of terror well after the events of the latter novel. 
However, while “The Handmaid’s Tale” chronicled 
the very first years of Gilead, readers of “The 
Testaments” get to witness what has become of 
this regime — how it has evolved in its cruelty and, 
more poignantly, how the women who have grown 

up inside it hardly even resemble the women who 
lived before them just decades ago. The young girls 
who have grown up inside Gilead might as well be a 
different species — feminism is a foreign concept to 
them, heinous crimes like murder and sexual assault 
are everyday occurrences and they don’t even know 
how to read.
Just as Darwin’s finches were products of a 
drought that reshaped their environment, the 
women of “The Testaments” are products of Gilead 
and its culture of hate and shame and oppression. 
The prospect of centuries upon centuries of human 
advancement crumbling within just a few decades 
is genuinely terrifying and truly fascinating to 
read about, and Atwood’s talent for visualizing this 
creatively is without a doubt the novel’s greatest 
asset. 
The haunting and frightening world of Gilead 
introduced in “The Handmaid’s Tale” has made 
its mark on our culture, spawning its own Emmy-
winning Hulu adaptation. There are many reasons 
why “The Handmaid’s Tale” has had the cultural 
impact it’s had — the parallels Atwood draws 
between her fictional Gilead and our own society’s 
internalized patriarchy are biting, deeply disturbing 
and impossible to forget. Aside from any political 
and social resonance the book might have, though, 
“The Handmaid’s Tale” is simply a great work of 
literature, a beautifully written and fully realized 
account of one woman’s journey as she’s forced to go 
through a living hell. 
Given all of this, it’s clear that “The Testaments” 
has a lot to live up to. You could say that the book 
should be read as its own entity, independent from 
its predecessor, but I don’t think this is what Atwood 
wants from her readers at all — she refers back to 
“The Handmaid’s Tale” constantly. And although 
“The Testaments” is written from the perspective 
of a different narrator (three narrators, in fact), all 

‘Space Invaders’: a dream-
like look at Pinochet’s Chile

Writers have rarely shied away from historical 
tragedies like genocide, war and oppressive 
governments.The Orwells of the world have 
dissected and shown the dangers of humanity’s 
most destructive ideologies. Nona Fernandez takes 
a different approach to writing about one such 
ideology in her book, “Space Invaders.” 
The novel follows the experience of a group of 
school children at the height of the Pinochet regime 
in Chile. Under Pinochet, the Chilean people faced 
suppression of dissent, mass killings and violations 
of human rights. What sets “Space Invaders” apart 
from most other political fiction is its focus on 
the lived experiences of the characters. There is 

virtually no reflection on the abstracted political 
conflicts of the time period; the novel only reflects 
on their effects on the human beings involved. 
While 
the 
unconventional 
subject 
matter 
works to keep the reader interested, the similarly 
unconventional structure is not as well executed. 
The novel is told in the form of memories recalled 
through the characters’ dreams. These former 
classmates, now adults, try to piece together the 
collective experience of their youth in hopes of 
making sense of the horror they lived through. As a 
result, the narrative is made up of disjointed images 
of militant classroom routines, brutal violence and 
their classmate Estrella, who has mysteriously 
gone missing. 
This explanation may seem a bit confusing, 
but that’s because the structure is too. Basic plot 
points were at times difficult to pin down due to

frequent jumps in the timeline. While the lack 
of extensive character development for each 
classmate is forgivable because of the novel’s 
focus on the collective rather than any individual 
experience, it does make it difficult to keep track of 
the characters. 
That said, the novel does have its bright spots. As 
difficult as the structure is to follow, the dreamlike 
recreation of the characters’ memories in individual 
moments is beautifully rendered. The prose is clear 
and full of emotion, placing the reader right in the 
mind of a child facing unspeakable violence. It 
captures the instances of abject horror uninhibited 
by the rationalizations of an adult mind. A 
child, having no understanding of the political 
motivations of the regime, is not able to assimilate 
these events to a narrative. The child then sees the 
events for what they are: senseless violence. In the 
same way that the events of a dream rarely make 
sense and simply are what they are, the children’s 
experiences don’t make sense to them, adding to 
their emotional impact. By refusing to articulate 
the ideology that motivates the actions of the 
Pinochet regime, Fernandez can present the real 
pain, fear and death that it caused with full force. 
Considering the novel’s strengths, it’s difficult to 
fault Fernandez for the disorienting structure. To 

an extent, such ambiguity is necessary to capture 
the states of mind of children who are so lost and 
confused. Fernandez can certainly be commended 
for her willingness to experiment, though one must 
wonder if the story would be better told in the form 
of poetry. Fernandez treads a fine line between 
the poetic, dreamlike world she creates and the 
maintenance of a clear narrative throughout — a 
line which she falls just barely on the wrong side 
of. Regardless, the book is engaging, thought-
provoking and worth the read.

The Jonas Brothers play 
their last show of 2019

Walking into the Imperial Ballroom at 
The Atlantis, I was immediately struck by 
the strange mix of spectators: drunk adults 
stumbling to their seats, young children 
looking confused and teenage girls excitingly 
gasping every time they saw motion backstage. 
After a successful year since their latest album 
Happiness Begins and the conclusion of their 
sold-out tour, the Jonas Brothers wrapped up 
2019 by playing one last show at The Atlantis 
Resort in the Bahamas. 
Unlike arenas the band filled during their 
tour, the resort’s ballroom accommodated only 
a few hundred people and was filled with both 
locals and tourists. The band offered special 
seating for residents of the island, where one 
could catch a glimpse of the brothers peeking 
through the makeshift curtains, sending the 
audience into a frenzy. Twenty-year old fans 
sported their old Jonas Brothers merch and 
waved signs with pictures of their younger 
selves (specifically when the band last played 
on the island back in 2009). In the main part 
of the ballroom, the tourist section was an 
array of young fans and older folks in search 
of entertainment for the night, creating an odd 
mix of dancing fans and confused spectators 
who preferred to remain seated for most of the 
show. 
While the show was not an official stop on 
the tour, the band incorporated a few elements 
from their American performances and mainly 
followed the tour’s set-list. They opened with 
“Rollercoaster,” a song off their new album, 
then immediately jumped into a throwback with 
their 2006 hit “S.O.S.” Much of the first half 
was dedicated to their newer music, including 
“Cool” and “Only Human,” two fan favorites 
off the new album. “I Believe” and “Hesitate,” 
two love ballads off the new album, were also 
sprinkled into the set. Also featured from the 
new album was “Comeback,” the epitome of the 
brothers’ reunion. 

As they’ve done in previous shows, the 
brothers took song requests from the audience, 
showcasing throwback songs that haven’t 
been heard live in years, and Nick and Joe 
both showcased work from their solo careers 
with “Jealous” and “Cake by the Ocean.” 
Scanning the crowd, it was clear some of the 
audience members have never heard the band’s 
older music before as they remained seated 
and politely tapped their feet to the beat of 
some of the band’s most well-known songs 
like “When You Look Me in the Eyes” and 
“Lovebug.” Others, mainly women and young 
girls below the age of thirty, were on their feet 
for the entirety of the show, belting lyrics and 
attempting to dance along in the cramped rows 
of seats. 
The band didn’t have much to say in between 
songs except that they were glad to be playing 
their last show of the year in the Bahamas. 
The brothers offered a toast before speeding 
through a medley of some of their older songs 
including “Mandy,” “Paranoid” and “Play My 
Music.” Kevin attempted to share a few words 
in the middle of the show, but his broken 
microphone left the audience confused, adding 
to the awkwardness of the night. They finished 
up the performance with three of their most 
popular songs, starting with “Year 3000” before 
breaking into “Burnin’ Up.” They came full 
circle wrapping up 2019 with “Sucker,” a single 
they released nearly a year ago and the impetus 
for their reunion and newfound success. 
While the brothers’ island performance 
certainly 
lacked 
the 
same 
vigor 
and 
showmanship from their American shows, 
the trio was still able to transport a crowd of 
twenty-somethings back to their childhoods. 
Perhaps this show felt different because the 
band was not equipped with the fireworks 
and light show from their tour, or maybe it 
was simply because they were burnt out after 
a long year. Regardless, witnessing the reunion 
of the band that created the music I first fell in 
love with thirteen years ago will always be an 
experience filled with nostalgia, tears and lots 
of dancing.

Tru Wilson announces 
decision to grad transfer

Redshirt junior running back 
Tru Wilson announced Thursday 
that he will pursue a graduate 
transfer.
“I appreciate everything the 
University of Michigan has done for 
me these last 4 years,” Wilson said 
in a tweet. “I will graduate in the 
spring and will transfer to finish 
my last year of college football. God 
bless and Forever 
Go Blue.”
Wilson’s news 
doesn’t come as 
a major surprise 
given that he was 
already the third-
string 
running 
back 
this 
year 
and 
the 
room 
doesn’t get any 
less 
crowded 
with the return of 
Chris Evans and the addition of a 
highly regarded freshman in Blake 
Corum.
Formerly a walk-on, Wilson 
earned a scholarship prior to the 
2018 season and carved out a 
complementary role for himself. 
In 2018, he was third on the team 
with 364 rushing yards and led all 
players with at least 15 attempts 
at 5.9 yards per carry. Despite 
missing two games due to injury 
in 2019, Wilson was again third on 

the team with 220 rushing yards 
and averaged 5.0 yards per carry 
— second among players with at 
least 15 carries. Wilson also scored 
two touchdowns in his Michigan 
career, with one in each 2018 and 
2019.
Despite 
Wilson’s 
loss, 
the 
running back room still projects 
to be deep next year. Freshman 
Zach Charbonnet and redshirt 
freshman Hassan Haskins, who 
split time at the position in 2019, 
will both be back. 
Evans — who was 
the 
Wolverines’ 
second-leading 
rusher in 2018 but 
missed the 2019 
season due to a 
suspension — has 
been reinstated for 
the 2020 season 
and will be a fifth-
year senior. Corum 
is 
a 
four-star 
recruit and could push for playing 
time 
right 
away. 
Additionally, 
Michigan has redshirt freshman 
Christian Turner, who played a 
reserve role in 2019, and freshman 
Giles Jackson, who has been used 
as an H-back.
Wilson, who played in one game 
during his freshman season in 2016, 
was granted a medical redshirt for 
a fifth year of eligibility. As a grad 
transfer, he will be immediately 
eligible wherever he goes.

Michigan has

‘M’ returns to Big Ten play in Notre Dame series

In the first half of the season, 
much was uncovered about 
the Michigan hockey team. 
From the offense’s recurrent 
struggles to the proven abilities 
from 
the 
defense 
and 
goaltending, 
it’s 
fairly 
clear what to 
expect on any 
given night.
It has yet to 
be unveiled, 
though, how 
exactly 
the 
Wolverines 
will 
fare 
against 
No. 
14 
Notre 
Dame. Before 
the new year, 
Michigan 
played 
in 
series against 
five of its six 
conference opponents — but not 
the Fighting Irish. Both series 
between these two teams are 
still on the horizon.
This weekend in South Bend 
will be the first 
indicator 
of 
how the two 
teams 
really 
match up. But 
regardless 
of 
not 
having 
faced 
Notre 
Dame yet this 
season, 
the 
Wolverines 
have 
a 
clear 
picture of what 
is ahead.
“They’re strong defensively,” 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson 
said. “They’re a very systematic 
team. They play their systems 
well as a group and as a team. 
They don’t beat themselves 
so you have to go and make 
plays and beat them. That’s the 
difficulty with playing against 
them.”
Goaltender Cale Morris is 

part of why the Fighting Irish 
can be so hard to defeat. Last 
season he had the eighth-best 
save percentage in the nation, 
and he was a Hobey Baker 
Award 
finalist 
the 
season 
before. His save 
percentage of .916 
this season isn’t 
quite as good as 
in the past, but he 
still possesses the 
ability to trouble 
an offense.
“You need to 
get lots of pucks 
on him and get 
bodies in front of 
him,” said fifth-
year 
senior 
forward 
Jacob 
Hayhurst. “The harder it is 
for him to see that puck every 
time we get an opportunity, the 
harder it’s going to be for him 
to save it. We want to get pucks 
and bodies to the net all game.”
That 
sentiment 
of 
spraying pucks at the net and 
establishing position near the 
crease is everyday language 
in hockey. It’s something the 

Wolverines have stressed time 
and time again.
Michigan has lived up to 
the first part of the mantra, as 
it has notched the ninth-most 
shots on goal in the nation. The 
issue resides in 
the latter half as 
the Wolverines 
convert less than 
seven 
percent 
of those shots. 
And 
against 
a 
talented 
goaltender 
in 
Morris, 
it’s 
all 
the 
more 
important 
that 
Michigan 
gets 
to the crease to help sneak the 
puck between the pipes.
To Pearson, Notre Dame is 
similar to the Wolverines in 
that its offense doesn’t score 
a ton and thus doesn’t create 
much distance. But since the 
Fighting 
Irish 
limit 
their 
mistakes, coming back from 
even minimal deficits against 
them can be tough.
“They’re really good if they 

get out ahead of you,” Pearson 
said. “They just suffocate you, 
so we’re gonna have to get out, 
try to play with that lead and 
then just stay with it.”
To prevent Notre Dame from 
establishing 
an 
early 
lead, 
Michigan 
will 
need 
to 
focus 
on players such 
as 
forwards 
Mike 
O’Leary 
and 
Cam 
Morrison, 
who 
lead the team 
in points. If the 
Wolverines can 
do 
that 
while 
making improvements on the 
attack, the team could start the 
year on a positive note.
“We’ve had great games with 
them,” Pearson said. “We’ve 
found ways to win. We’ve 
played well defensively for the 
most part against them, too. So 
I think we match up well with 
them. It’s going to be good, 
really good games. But again, 
we have to score.”

Columbus collapse

COLUMBUS 
— 
A 
quick 
turn, her hips quickly blocking 
out any defenders’ hope of 
defending the shot — another 
two 
points 
for 
sophomore 
forward Naz Hillmon.
Then, just as quick, Ohio 
State marauded down the court 
and nailed a three.
It was a taunting, haunting 
back and forth throughout the 
game. The Buckeyes owned the 
three-point line. The Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
team, 
meanwhile, owned the paint.
In the end, the three outpaced 
the Wolverines’ (11-4 overall, 
2-2 Big Ten) inside dominance 
on Thursday as Ohio State (9-6, 
2-2) won, 78-69.
An intense third quarter 
saw Michigan and Ohio State 
battling for a lead after a string 
of threes brought the Buckeyes 
back into the game.
The Wolverines drew fouls 
in the quarter, but couldn’t 
capitalize, 
shooting 
7-for-12 
from the line in the third and 
65.4 percent in the game.
“We 
didn’t 
really 
finish 
well today when we were at 
the line,” Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes 
Arico 
said. 
“That’s 
something that we kind of (had 
throughout the season), up and 
down days at the line through 
the course of the season and 
is something that we work on 
every day in practice, and we’ve 
definitely improved, but today 
wasn’t our greatest night.”
Michigan’s stalwart inside 
defense kept the Buckeyes at 
bay, limiting them to just 24 
points in the paint throughout 
the game.
A majority of Michigan’s 
points in the first quarter came 
from a fast-paced offense where 
Ohio State struggled to get set. 
When it set, however, it was a 
different story: with the paint 
clogged, sophomore guard Amy 
Dilk and senior forward Kayla 
Robbins struggled to add a 
second component of offense.

The two attempted to drive 
to the basket countless times, 
only to be forced outside and 
throw 
up 
ambitious 
layup 
attempts from six feet away. 
Dilk went 3-for-16 from the 
field.
For a team like Michigan that 
scores almost all of its points 
in the paint, 3-point shooting 
plagued it once again — on both 
sides of the ball.
“We’re not a tremendous 
3-point shooting team, that’s 
not the strength of our team,” 
Barnes Arico said. “And I think 
people take that away from us. 
(Junior forward) Hailey Brown 
couldn’t get going till late, we 
gotta get (freshman guard) 
Michelle Sidor to get in there 
and be able to give us some 
production from the outside, 
but (senior guard) Akienreh 
(Johnson) couldn’t get them to 
fall tonight.”
Ohio State, meanwhile, did 
get them to fall.
Starting 
with 
a 
missed 
interception 
attempt 
from 
Robbins in the final minute of 
the first quarter that led to an 
open shot, the Buckeyes found 
success behind the line no 
matter the pressure Michigan 
threw at them — shooting 60 
percent from three the rest of 
the half.
In the second quarter alone, 
only one field goal wasn’t from 
three for the Buckeyes. The 
Wolverines would get a couple 
of quick layups and seemingly 
grab momentum, only to be 
yanked backward by a three 
in the face of Johnson, or 
Hillmon, or Brown.
“Of 
course 
(the 
spread 
offense is) a lot different, 
a lot more space to cover,” 
Hillmon said. “Some of that 
we definitely have to work on 
because a lot of the bigs in the 
Big Ten can stretch out like 
that. So just working on that in 
games like this will help us in 
the long run.”
It’s a problem that continues 
to plague Michigan this season: 
its offense must be hyper-

efficient to keep up with an 
opponent that hits its threes. 
On Thursday, Ohio State did 
just that.
Despite 
that, 
Hillmon 
nearly 
singlehandedly 
kept 
the Wolverines in the game, 
finishing the first half a perfect 
7-for-7 from the field and 
willing them into half with a 
three point lead, 38-35.
In the first half, it was hyper-
efficient.
Yet, Michigan couldn’t close 
the door, leaving it slightly ajar 
for Ohio State.
As the game counted down, 
in front of a hostile crowd, the 
Buckeyes blew the door off its 
hinges. Two travels led to five 
Ohio State points in the span 
of thirty seconds, gifting them 
late-game momentum that the 
Wolverines couldn’t take back.
“I think their threes really 
deflated 
us,” 
Barnes 
Arico 
said. “They shot the ball really 
exceptionally well, we’ve done 
a pretty good job of covering 
that all year long, we just 
couldn’t get any momentum 
going at any time.”
Unlike 
the 
Buckeyes, 
Michigan 
didn’t 
have 
the 
momentum 
changer 
of 
a 
3-pointer. Unlike the Buckeyes, 
Michigan couldn’t answer with 
a big bucket.

COLUMBUS — At halftime of 
Thursday night’s game, it was 
looking good for Michigan.
The Wolverines led Ohio 
State by three at the break, but 
it felt like they had control. The 
Buckeyes shot just 40 percent 
from the floor in the first half. 
Their leading scorer, forward 
Dorka Juhász, was held to just 
three points. The only reason 
they were in the game was that 
they shot 7-for-15 from 3-point 
range — uncharacteristic for a 
team that shot just 28.5 percent 
from deep entering the game, 
and likely to drop in the second 
half.
Most 
importantly 
for 
Michigan, sophomore forward 
Naz Hillmon was at her best. 
Hillmon tallied 18 points and 
nine rebounds in the first half, 
all without missing a field goal. 
She was especially dominant 
on the offensive glass, pulling 
in six offensive rebounds and 
converting 
those 
into 
five 
second-chance points.
In losses to Florida State 
and Maryland, Hillmon logged 
two and three first-half points, 
respectively, in part due to 
early foul trouble. Without 
their biggest offensive weapon 

in rhythm, the Wolverines had 
difficulty 
scoring 
efficiently 
or gaining any momentum. On 
Thursday, she didn’t pick up a 
foul until the second half.
“Not having to sit on the bench 
definitely helps just because 
it takes a lot to get going,” 
Hillmon said. “Sometimes when 
you’re in foul trouble you get the 
opportunity to see what’s going 
on, but I’d rather be on the floor 
figuring out what’s going on 
than on the bench. It definitely 
helped my flow 
of the game.”
Since 
those 
two 
games, 
getting Hillmon 
going 
early 
was a focus for 
Michigan, 
and 
after the first 
half, it looked 
as though she 
would carry the 
Wolverines to a 
victory.
Hillmon was also partially 
responsible for Ohio State’s 
interior 
struggles. 
The 
Buckeyes’ four forwards that 
played in the first half combined 
for 12 points while shooting 
just 4-for-13 from the floor. 
Since she and junior forward 
Hailey Brown weren’t in foul 
trouble, they were able to play 
aggressively in the paint, not 
giving Ohio State’s bigs any 
room to work and preventing 
second-chance opportunities — 
the Buckeyes reeled in just one 
offensive rebound in the half.
But 
in 
the 
second 
half, 
Ohio State made a defensive 
adjustment. 
The 
Buckeyes 
packed the paint and pushed 
Hillmon as far away from the 
basket as possible. 
“That took away some of 
our spacing angles to get her 
the ball,” Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico said. “Every time 
we were trying to get (Hillmon) 
the ball it was getting tipped or 
deflected because there were a 
lot of people around her.” 
Senior 
forward 
Kayla 
Robbins scored 10 first-half 

points, preventing Ohio State 
from devoting its full attention 
to Hillmon, but Robbins picked 
up her second foul early in the 
second quarter and sat for the 
final seven minutes of the first 
half. She couldn’t get going again 
early in the second half, and with 
none of the Wolverines’ other 
scorers 
playing 
particularly 
well, stopping Hillmon was the 
Buckeyes’ only focus.
“We really need to figure 
out how we can get somebody 
else 
going,” 
Hillmon said. “It 
definitely 
was 
key that Kayla 
got in some foul 
trouble because 
she’s 
such 
a 
great 
help 
on 
offense 
and 
defense.”
Because 
of 
the 
increased 
attention, 
Hillmon 
was 
only 
able 
to 
attempt one field goal in the 
second half. She still drew 
fouls and got to the line — she 
attempted six free throws in the 
half — but scored just six points. 
Without 
her 
constant 
offensive production, Michigan 
struggled. 
The 
Wolverines 
stuck with Ohio State in the 
third quarter, but in the fourth 
quarter, the Buckeyes got hot, 
shooting over 70 percent and 
outscoring Michigan by nine. 
The Wolverines couldn’t keep up 
without Hillmon’s dominance, 
resulting in a 78-69 loss.
When Michigan has played 
its best, its secondary scorers 
have contributed just as much 
as Hillmon. Against Syracuse, 
Robbins led the way with 23 
points. Against Michigan State, 
sophomore guard Amy Dilk 
scored 23. In both games, four 
Wolverines finished in double 
figures.
But in Thursday’s second 
half, nobody could supplement 
Hillmon’s 
production, 
and 
Michigan saw a conference 
road game against a rival slip 
away.

‘M’ prevails 
in double 
overtime

 It was a boring game. Then it wasn’t. 
 It was a game in which senior guard 
Zavier Simpson couldn’t hit a dart board 
with a shotgun. Then he was leading the 
offense in double overtime. 
 In a back-and-forth slugfest character-
ized by sloppy basketball, a tense second 
half and two thrilling overtime periods, 
the Michigan men’s basketball team 
clung onto the narrowest of leads to 
steal away a win from Purdue in double 
overtime, 84-78.
 In the initially-sluggish-then-absolute-
ly-electric affair, two struggling offens-
es played a game of, ‘Who can play the 
sloppiest game of basketball in a win?’ 
Thursday, that just so happened to be 
the Wolverines.
 Michigan (11-4 overall, 2-2 Big Ten), 
hobbled by the injury to its second-lead-
ing scorer, junior forward Isaiah Livers, 
tried any and everything to fill the of-
fensive gap and put points on the board 
against Purdue (9-7, 2-3).
 In the first half, those efforts were 
spent in vain with the first 20 minutes of 
play shrouded by turnovers.
 The Wolverines went just 3-for-12 in 
the first half, and Simpson attempted 
just two shots himself in the first 20 
minutes. The second half opened in 
the same vein with Simpson missing 
the mark on his first four shot attempts 
from deep.
 A terse showdown characterized the 
remainder of the game, though, high-
lighted by an immense showing from 
Boilermakers forward Trevion Wil-
liams, who stepped up for star forward 
Matt Haarms after he went down early 
with a hip injury. Williams finished with 
a whopping 36 points and 20 boards 
while maintaining Purdue’s slim lead for 
most of the second half. 
 “Well they play people one-on-one in 
the post, and he’s a good little post play-
er, so we just tried to get him the basket-
ball,” Purdue coach Matt Painter said. 
“So when Matt went out, we wanted 
to focus on going to (senior center Jon) 
Teske and trying to score, trying to get to 
the free throw line, layups, post moves.”
 Added Teske: “He did very well. 
Watching him on film, I knew what he 
has, and he came in and he did his job. 
He led his team, and with Haarms hurt, 
he had to do a little more, and they were 
playing through him.”
 Michigan was finally able to break the 
lead and tie the game following an offen-
sive rebound, made-layup and ensuing 
3-point shot from Teske.
 The final five minutes of the game 
were a back-and-forth slugfest with 
each point feeling like an insurmount-
able mountain. With the clock ticking 
down, the Wolverines were called for 
a goaltend to put Purdue ahead by two, 
setting up a Michigan possession where 
Simpson drove to the hoop for the tie. 
The Boilermakers then called timeout 
for their final look at the basket with 15 
seconds remaining.
 Guard Aaron Wheeler drove to the bas-
ket in an attempt to find Williams. The 
pass was a bit too much for Williams to 
handle, though, allowing freshman for-
ward Franz Wagner to deflect his shot 
and send the thriller to overtime.
 From there, it was the Zavier Simpson 
show.
 Any sense of a shooting slump flew out 
the door, and Simpson took charge on 
offense.
 “It’s just about staying locked in,” Simp-
son said. “I don’t like to think about my-
self, and tonight showed. I took one or 
two shots in the first half, and I came out 
and had 22 points. So it’s about staying 
locked in and just putting things inside 
a box, and putting things like that inside 
right now and make sure we win and 
make sure I’m doing everything I can to 
put my team in a winning position.”
 And the show would carry through-
out both of the ensuing overtime peri-
ods, with Simpson finishing his stellar 
performance with 22 points and nine 
assists.
 As overtime ticked on, excitement 
built upon each shot. Each dribble. Each 
make. The match wasn’t a question of 
who wanted it more, but more of which 
team could execute in the big moments. 
The first overtime decidedly announced 
that neither team was worthy, and fol-
lowing a Williams miss in the post and 
another miss on a half-court Simpson 
heave, the game was sent to double 
overtime.
 Teske started the second period of free 
basketball early with an and-one layup 
at the rim. Not wanting to be outdone, 
Simpson promptly hit a 3-pointer on the 
ensuing possession to send Crisler Cen-
ter into a frenzy, taking a 74-68 lead.
 Then the shots just kept falling and 
Michigan never looked back, with Wag-
ner hitting a 3-pointer to spread the 
lead to nine. Suddenly, the offense that 
seemed so anemic in the first half had 
come to life when it mattered most. 
 In the end, Purdue missed the big 
ones and Simpson hit them. Ask anyone 
around the program, and they’ll let you 
know why.
 “He’s a senior, he wanna win so bad, 
you can just see it in the way he plays,” 
said sophomore guard David DeJulius. 
“He just willed us to win because he’s 
a senior, and he wants to go out with a 
bang.”

MICHIGAN 84
PURDUE 78

FINAL 2OT

SIMPSON: 22 pts, 9 asts

Simpson 
leads way
in victory

 For the first 18 minutes of the 
Michigan men’s basketball team’s 
win over Purdue, Zavier Simpson 
didn’t even take a shot.
 Coming off Sunday’s loss in which 
he shot the ball a career-high 18 
times, it felt strange. After all, the 
senior point guard played all but one 
minute of Thursday’s first half. But 
Simpson took over the game after 
the break, pouring in 18 second-
half points on 7-of-11 shooting to 
propel the Wolverines past the 
Boilermakers, 
84-78, 
in 
double 
overtime.
 When Michigan quickly fell behind 
in the second half, it was Simpson 
who spearheaded the comeback. By 
the time his teammates missed their 
15th shot from beyond the arc, he’d 
seen enough.
 He took matters into his own hands.
 Simpson’s quick first step and elite 
vision allowed him to get to the rim 
seemingly at will, while his ability 
to collapse the defense created open 
looks for others. Throughout the 
second half, he blew past guards on 
the perimeter and finished crafty 
layups and improbable hook shots 
over bigger defenders. At times, he 
was the team’s lone source of offense.
 And when the Wolverines needed 
a jolt at the beginning of the second 
overtime period, he knocked down 
a 3-pointer from the left wing. 
Then senior center Jon Teske and 
freshman 
wing 
Franz 
Wagner 
followed suit, giving Michigan a lead 
it wouldn’t relinquish.
 For Purdue coach Matt Painter, 
it was all too familiar of a sight. 
Simpson has now scored in double 
figures in each of his four career 
starts against the Boilermakers. 
Painter has seen this side of Simpson 
for what must feel like an eternity, 
dating back to when he began 
recruiting him as a junior in high 
school.
 “(Simpson) is just a winner,” 
Painter said. “He won in high school, 
he’s won here. That’s just who he is. 
Guys who are winners — guys like 
Mike Conley that came through the 
Big Ten — if they score four or six 
points, it’s no big deal. If they have 
to score 24, then so be it. That’s what 
winning is about. … He can will his 
team to victory.”
 Painter wasn’t alone in feeling 
that way. Michigan coach Juwan 
Howard, too, was unsurprised by 
Simpson’s heroics.
 “(Simpson) is one of the best 
point guards in college basketball,” 
Howard said. “One of the best 
leaders in college basketball. One 
of the toughest competitors in 
college basketball. A kid who’s been 
counted out so many times and has 
always figured out how to rise to the 
occasion. He trusts himself. We trust 
him. His teammates follow his lead 
and energy.”
 In Simpson’s case, it boils down to 
more than just a box score. He’s one 
of the country’s fiercest competitors, 
and the first thing anybody around 
him notices is his will to win.
 “He also knows each and every 
possession he has a coach that’s 
going to be leaning on him to 
provide leadership,” Howard said. 
“He embraces that. It’s not like he’s 
running away from that challenge. 
Yes, it’s big shoulders that he has to 
carry with all the accountability I’ve 
given him, all the trust I’ve given 
him.
 “But, he’s earned all of it. We’re just 
happy that we have our Tom Brady.”
 In Simpson, Howard sees himself. 
He says he’ll never forget the first 
time he called Simpson’s mother, 
Bobbie Carter. It was right after 
Howard accepted the job in May — a 
typical introduction between a new 
coach and current player’s parent. 
But to this day, one comment from 
the conversation stands out.
 “The two of your birthdays are 
close to one another,” Howard recalls 
Carter saying.
 Howard’s grandmother played a 
major role in his upbringing. One 
thing he remembers well is her 
affinity for astrology. With such 
close birthdays, she told Howard 
that he and Simpson both share the 
Aquarius horoscope.
 “We both can be bull-headed,” 
Howard said. “I will always add 
stubborn. … We also are both tough-
nose competitors. But the beauty of 
it is that we both trust one another, 
and I’ve earned his trust.”
 Now, that trust can dictate the 
direction of the Wolverines’ season. 
And with Simpson at the head of the 
snake, Howard knows he can rest 
easy.
 Howard often refers to Simpson 
as his Tom Brady. Painter likened 
him to Mike Conley. Throughout 
his tenure in Ann Arbor, he’s been 
compared to a pitbull.
 But when Teske — Simpson’s 
co-captain — was asked to give a 
comparison, his answer was most 
telling.
 “He’s Zavier Simpson.”
