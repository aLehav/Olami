The 
University 
Research 
Corridor — a partnership of 
the University of Michigan, 
Michigan 
State 
University 
and Wayne State University — 
released its 11th economic impact 
report last week. The report 
highlights 
the 
universities’ 
contributions 
to 
the 
state 
economy, which totaled $18.7 
billion in 2017.
This is a significant increase 
from 2015, when the URC 
added $16.5 billion to the state 
economy. 
Britany 
Affolter-
Caine, executive director of the 
URC, attributes this increase 
to federal funding and larger 

student populations.
“It is being successful — 
the three universities — and 
continuing 
to 
grow 
their 
operations in terms of research 
and education,” Affolter-Caine 
said. “They’ve grown enrollment 
over the last several years. 
They’ve been more successful in 
capturing federal grants to fund 
their research. … Continuing 
growth in those areas is why 
we can say we’ve had a bigger 
impact.”
In addition, the URC added 
78,845 jobs in 2017.
“I think it’s really important 
to think about the impact that’s 
non-monetary — the impact 
on individuals,” Affolter-Caine 
said. “There are many impacts 

“Empowerment.” 
That’s 
the word Public Policy senior 
Yvonne Navarrete used to 
describe 
her 
experience 
as a Latina woman at the 
University of Michigan. Last 
year, Navarrete worked as 
the lead director of La Casa, 
a student organization and 
advocacy group dedicated to 
uniting Latinx students at the 
University. She now works as 
an undergraduate adviser for 
the organization.
Tuesday night marked the 
beginning of Latinx Heritage 
Month at the University, and 
over 200 students, faculty and 
staff attended the opening 
ceremony in the Michigan 
League ballroom.
Navarrete was one of many 
volunteers 
from 
La 
Casa 
who attended the ceremony 
and described her personal 
process of become a student 
leader on campus.
“It’s all about coming into 
a space that’s not historically 
created for your people or 
those with similar identities 
as you and being able to 
bring your community in,” 
Navarrete said. “You do that 
not just for yourself, but the 
students coming after you. 
That’s really what La Casa has 
been doing since its creation 
and through Latinx Heritage 
Month: creating those spaces 
so that Latinx students can 

feel included and represented, 
feel at home, and not only 
that they belong on campus, 
but that they are a part of 
campus. They are what makes 
the University of Michigan 
great.”
The event included opening 
remarks 
from 
University 
President Mark Schlissel in 
which he emphasized the 
importance 
of 
protecting 

historically 
marginalized 
communities. He highlighted 
the need for communication 
and openness on campus.
“I assure that we will 
continue to work with all of 
you and your leaders this year 
and into the future, trying to 
understand how best to serve 
you as students,” he said.
The ceremony also featured 
Catalina Ormsby, managing 

director 
of 
the 
National 
Forum on Higher Education, 
Ethriam Brammer, assistant 
dean and DEI implementation 
lead at Rackham Graduate 
School, and LSA junior Alex 
Mullen, internal director of 
La Casa.
Mullen 
discussed 
how 
important Latinx Heritage 
Month 
is 
for 
students 

The 
U.S. 
Department 
of 
Commerce 
announced 
last 
Wednesday that the University 
of Michigan’s Great Lakes Trade 
Adjustment Assistance Center, 
which works with companies 
in 
Michigan, 
Indiana, 
and 
Ohio that have been hurt by 
foreign competition, has been 
awarded a $1.1 million Economic 
Development 
Administration 
grant.
A total of $13 million was 
issued to 11 different Trade 
Adjustment Assistance Centers 
nationwide, 
which 
“help 
American manufacturers hurt 
by imports adjust to increasing 
global competition.”
According 
to 
the 
U.S. 
Department of Commerce, the 
TAACs “support a wide range of 
technical, planning, and business 
recovery 
projects 
that 
help 
companies 
and 
communities 
adapt 
to 
international 
competition.”
Many of the center’s clients, 
frequently small manufacturers 
in the region, faced uncertainty 
in light of recent tariffs levied

The Pulitzer-prize winner detailed his journey from “refugee to bourgeoisie”

Pulitzer Prize-winning author 
Viet Thanh Nguyen, a professor

California, 
spoke 
Tuesday 
to 
a 
packed 
Lydia 
Mendelssohn 
Theatre on the perceptions of 

refufees

the 
Vietnamese 
perspective of the Vietnam War. 
Using his own experiences and 
excerpts from his award-winning

importance of storytelling.
This event was put together 
by 
over 
13 
organizations, 
including the Vietnamese Student 
Association, the United Asian 

American 
Organizations, 
the 
University of Michigan Helen Zell 
Writers’ program. Prof. Emily 
Lawsin, an organizer of the event, 
introduced Nguyen, highlighting 
the crucial perspective he offers in 
such a turbulent time.
“A refugee at a time of rising 
xenophobia, a survivor of war 
in an era of ceaseless violence, a 

transnational visionary in the face 
of borders and walls, a writer of 
color in an age of resurgent white 
supremacy and, last but not least, 
a teacher at a time when we are 
bombarded daily with ignorance

In 1971, Philip Zimbardo, 
a 
psychology 
professor 
at 
Stanford 
University, 
constructed a fake jail in the 
basement of the university. 
He filled the prison with 21 
college-age male volunteers, 10 
designated “prisoners” and 11 
designated “guards.”
Zimbardo planned to run a 
jail simulation, acting as the 
warden of the prison, for two 
weeks to observe the impact 
of roles and labels in the 
environment. The experiment 
quickly deteriorated, however, 
and the mock prison descended 
into chaos. After only six 
days, 
the 
experiment 
was 
shut down when a visiting 
student reported the abusive 
behavior of the guards and the 
psychological distress of the 
prisoners.
Zimbardo’s 
investigation, 
dubbed the Stanford prison 
experiment, would come to be 
hailed as a classic psychology 
study revealing one dark facet 
of human nature.

Pulitzer-prize winning author Viet Than Nguyen speaks about his work and life at the Michigan League Tuesday. 


that affect the rank-and-file 
Michigander.”
In the short term, students 

at URC universities contribute 
directly to the state and local 
economies by buying goods and 
services and boosting business. 
In the long-term, their presence 
is more important, according 
to 
Affolter-Caine. 
Students 

who attend these universities 
frequently find career paths in the 
state, often working on projects 
and jobs that can improve the 
lives of Michiganders.
Affolter-Caine also attributes 
the success to innovative services 
and projects developed by the 
universities which directly 
impact the state. She cites 
the Perinatology Research 
Branch, part of the Wayne 
State School of Medicine, 
as an excellent example of a 
university project that helped 
the general public. The PRB 
has discovered a non-invasive 
treatment for women at risk 
for pre-term labor, which is 
now part of standard practice 
in hospitals across Michigan.
Affolter-Caine also cited 
Mcity, a mock city in Ann 
Arbor used to test driverless 
cars, as another excellent 
example.
“There are just not that 
many really unique facilities 
like Mcity,” Affolter-Caine 
said. “And it is bringing 
businesses from all over the 
world to Ann Arbor. It gives 
students an opportunity to 
conduct research and get that 
experience.”
Engineering 
professor 
Glen Daigger, who has been 
acquainted with the URC for 
three years and participated 
in several cross-university 

collaborations, said in addition to 
the raw economic contributions, 
the URC has helped significantly 
in facilitating further cooperation 
between the universities.
He noted that the three 
universities have been working 
together 
to 
improve 
the 
networking 
between 
state 
researchers and practitioners in 
and out of Michigan. 
Like Affolter-Caine, Daigger 
believes that innovation is central 
to the success and impact of the 
URC. He also credits researchers 
and academics for their work.
“If you aren’t doing new things 
and improving and so forth, you’re 
actually going down,” Daigger 
said. “In terms of economic 
contribution, the dollars flowing 
in for research are certainly a 
contribution, but it’s the ideas and 
the people and the enthusiasm 
and so forth that are the biggest 
contribution to continue the 
economic development here in 
Michigan.”
Daigger 
also 
emphasized 
the 
importance 
of 
students 
to the research and economic 
contributions from all three 
universities.
“Every engine needs fuel. The 
research engine needs money. 
One of the other fuels is the 
students,” Daigger said. “They’re 
the hands and the minds and the 
curiosity that really drive much of 
this research.”

Arul Chinnaiyan, a member of 
the University of Michigan Rogel 
Cancer Center, has received an 
Outstanding Investigator Award 
and $6.5 million grant from 
the National Cancer Institute. 
Over the next seven years, this 
grant will fund Chinnaiyan in 
his research on understanding 
genetic markers and cancer 
treatments that can be targeted 
to specific markers.
“The grant will fund research 
to create new bioinformatics 
resources and identify new 
cancer biomarkers to improve 
diagnosis and ultimately to 

develop new targeted therapies,” 
a Michigan Medicine press 
release said.
The Outstanding Investigator 
Award, rather than funding a 
specific project, presents leading 
researchers 
with 
support 
through a grant nearly three 
times the amount of a traditional 
individual investigator award. 
Through R35, a grant program 
developed 
by 
the 
National 
Cancer Institute, the seven-
year 
extended 
period 
of 
funding is designed to provide 
flexible, long-term support to 
investigators.

“The 
field 
of 
precision 
oncology continues to evolve 
with 
the 
overarching 
goal 
of providing cancer patients 
with enhanced diagnostic and 
prognostic 
capabilities 
and 
better treatments,” Chinnaiyan 
said. “This grant will help us 
identify new biomarkers and 
understand their biological roles 
in cancer progression.”
Chinnaiyan, who is also the 
director of the Michigan Center 
for 
Translational 
Pathology 
and the S.P. Hicks Endowed 
Professor 
of 
Pathology 
and 
Urology at the University of 

Michigan Medical School, is 
considered one of the nation’s 
top researchers in precision 
oncology. 
He 
founded 
the 
Michigan Oncology Sequencing 
Program at the Rogel Cancer 
Center in 2010, which has 
enrolled over 3,000 patients

As candles flickered across 
the Diag, members of the 
campus community bowed 
their heads to commemorate 
the second anniversary of the 
Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
“The September 11 vigil was 
a place for all members of the 
University community to come 
together, to remember and to 
reflect on these tragic events,” 
said MSA President Angela 
Galardi.
The vigil was sponsored 
by the Michigan Student 
Assembly.
Although last year’s program 
did not include music, Music 
School senior Darnell Ishmel 
sang the national anthem at last 
night’s vigil. 
LSA freshman Theresa 

Bomer said, “(The national 
anthem) is very important 
because it’s not just the campus 
coming together, it’s the entire 
nation”
The decision to sing 
the national anthem was 
controversial, said Courtney 
Skiles, MSA communication 
chair.
But “the committee felt that 
it was expected to be sung 
tonight,” Skiles said.
LSA junior Deborah Kim, a 
member of the vigil planning 
committee said the anthem 
should be included. “Even 
though it talks about war, the 
song symbolizes freedom,” Kim 
said.
The vigil began with an 
introduction from Galardi 

followed by remarks from the 
University President Mary Sue 
Coleman.
“Some moments in our 
lives are too deep for words,” 
Coleman said, adding that 
she believes that being in the 
company of others is a great 
comfort. 
Following Coleman, Ann

by the Trump administration. 
The 
Trump 
administration’s 
announcement 
caused 
uncertainty in the markets as 
the tariffs go against years of 
precedence of free trade with 
China.
Director Scott Jacobs said the 
program helps companies “step 
back and assess their business 
practices in order to become 
more competitive.”
“The 
whole 
idea 
of 
the 
assistance model is to help 

companies invest in themselves 
by building their capabilities 
faster 
and 
more 
efficiently 
than they could without the 
program,” Jacobs said.
The program offers client 
companies guidance in a variety 
of areas, including sales and 
marketing, personnel training 
and new product development. 
Firms can qualify for up to 
$75,000 in matching funds from 
the center to cover the cost of 
business improvement projects.
The 
grants 
announced 
Wednesday 
represent 
a 
$300,000 decrease in funding 
overall from 2017 when the 

Department 
of 
Commerce 
designated a total of $13.3 
million to TAACs. 2018 marks a 
$600,000 decrease in funding 
for the Great Lakes Trade 
Adjustment Assistance Center, 
which was awarded $1.7 million 
in 2017. In 2016, the Center 
received $1.65 million from the 
EDA.
Jacobs said the center was 
currently in the third year of a 
five-year cooperative agreement 
between the Department of 
Commerce and the University, 
and that federal funding is 
not distributed in a “uniform 
manner.”

“It 
ends 
up 
fluctuating, 
and we were disappointed in 
that lower amount of funding, 
however, over the three years 
so far … we’ve received well 
over $3 million, which, in sum, 
is adequate for us to our work,” 
Jacobs said.
“Our clients and companies 
across the U.S. are worried 
about a potential increase in raw 
material costs, but largely they 
haven’t seen that yet,” Jacobs 
said. “Anything beyond that — 
restrictions in trade or a bunch 
of uncertainty — you know, it’s 
unclear what’s going to happen 
with that.”

refugee, 
started 
his 
talk 
by 
acknowledging 
his 
refugee 
identity, jokingly referring to his 
transformation 
“from 
refugee 
to 
bourgeoisie.” 
Nguyen 
and 
his family fled to the United 
States in 1975 after the fall of 
Saigon, settling in a refugee 
camp in Fort Indiantown Gap, 
Pennsylvania. He explained he 
still feels like a refugee because 
his earliest memories are of this 
time when he was separated 
from his parents and brother — a 
story parallel to the child-parent 
separation crisis of today at the 
U.S.-Mexican border.
“That’s why I take it personally 
when I hear stories today about 
children being taken away from 
their parents, because I feel there 
is no justification of that,” Nguyen 
said.
He then talked about the idea 
of “good” and “bad” refugees, 
describing the limitations of these 
one-sided views and emphasizing 
every person’s right in America to 
be mediocre, a line that garnered a 
lot of applause.
“I resist this whole idea of 
good and bad refugees or good 
and bad immigrants, because 
what that implies is the only 
acceptable refugee or immigrant 
is the exceptional refugee, the 
exceptional immigrant,” Nguyen 
said. “But you can only admit one 
or two of those people, and I think 
that’s exactly the intent behind 
this idea of good and bad refugees 
or immigrants. I, for one, believe in 
America in which equality means 
the equal right to be mediocre.”
Nguyen also spoke about U.S. 
and Vietnamese perceptions of 
the Vietnam War. He shared 
how the war wasn’t over for the 
Vietnamese people surrounding 
him in his refugee camp growing 
up with the losses and grief they 
still carried. He described himself 
feeling “split in two” while 
watching 
“Apocalypse 
Now,” 
at first being on the side of the 
American soldiers until he saw 
them killing Vietnamese. Through 

this movie and other media of its 
kind, he realized how powerful 
and destructive stories can be.
“Stories can empower and 
stories can destroy us at the same 
time, and that’s one of the reasons 
why I became a writer,” Nguyen 
said.
Throughout his talk, Nguyen 
read excerpts from four of his 
books: 
“The 
Sympathizer,” 
“Nothing Ever Dies: Vietnam 
and the Memory of War,” “The 
Refugees” and “The Displaced: 
Refugee 
Writers 
on 
Refugee 
Lives.” After sharing his stories, 
he held a question-and-answer 
session. In one response, he 
emphasized the need to write 
stories that bring people together.
“We have to change how stories 
are told,” Nguyen said. “We need 
to write stories in America that 
build bridges instead of building 
walls. We need to tell stories 
opening our hearts instead of 
closing our minds.”
LSA junior Hannah Brauer 
read some of Nguyen’s books 
in her classes and appreciated 
the viewpoint he provided on 
the 
Vietnam 
War. 
She 
said 
something that resonated with 
her was his reference to a New 
York Times review for his book 
“The Sympathizer” that called it 
“the voice for the voiceless” when 
really those voices were just not 
being heard.
“I like how he referenced the 
New York Times review they gave 
him about the book, when really 
it’s not the voiceless, it’s those who 
popular culture refuses to hear,” 
Brauer said. “So he’s trying to be 
that voice that is heard, and he is 
being is heard.”
Christina Do, an employee 
at 
Washtenaw 
Community 
College, is also a fan of Nguyen’s 
writing and relates to many of 
his experiences as her parents 
are also refugees of the Vietnam 
War. She talked about the power 
of seeing her identity represented 
by Nguyen.
“The feeling of seeing someone 
who 
shares 
your 
experience, 
who shares your identity in some 
way, it’s an incredibly gratifying 
experience,” Do said.

initiative 
and another to help fund the 
Career Center’s JCPenney Suit 
Up event.
The assembly also passed 
a resolution to recommend 
adding motion activated lights 
in academic buildings at the 
University. Shortly after the 
meeting began, CSG observed a 
moment of silence in memorial 
of 9/11.
The 
Buses 
to 
Ballots 
initiative was born out of the 
Big 
Ten 
Voting 
Challenge, 
the conference-wide push to 
increase student voter turnout 
in the 2018 midterm elections. 
Buses would take students to 
and from polling places from 6 
a.m. to 11 p.m. on Election Day 
in November in an attempt to 
increase student voter turnout.
The 2014 midterms only 
produced a 14 percent college 
student voter turnout, which 

students and administrators 
are eager to raise.
CSG Vice President Izzy 
Baer, an LSA junior, says 
this is a great opportunity 
to highlight and overcome 
barriers to voting for students.
 
“CSG is very excited to have 
the opportunity to support 
student voting accessibility on 
election day,” Baer wrote later 
to The Daily. “While it is vital 
for students to register and 
vote, there are difficulties — 
such as transportation — that 
are often not discussed. We see 
this as a positive step forward 
in increasing student voting 
turnout across the board this 
November.”
CSG 
President 
Daniel 
Greene, 
a 
Public 
Policy 
senior, discussed the positive 
implications that subsidizing 
transportation to the polls will 
bring.
“CSG is excited to uphold 
(University) 
President 
Schlissel’s 
Big 
Ten 
Voter 
Challenge and help improve 
voter 
turnout 
amongst 
Michigan students,” Greene 

wrote to The Daily following 
the meeting. “AR 8-009 makes 
voting less of a burden by 
addressing 
barriers 
created 
by some polling site’s off-
campus locations. The funding 
allocation subsidizes student 
transportation to the polls, 
so students have guaranteed, 
direct transportation to their 
assigned polling stations.”
 
Greene also says CSG is 
dedicated to the student body’s 
interests and will continue to 
pass policies to achieve this.
 
“CSG remains committed 
to empowering student voices 
beyond campus, and I believe 
the resolutions helps Central 
Student Government embody 
the University’s mission to 
develop leaders and citizens 
who will challenge the present 
and enrich the future,” Greene 
wrote.
 
Engineering 
junior 
Zeke 
Majeske 
was 
happy 
the 
resolution passed, but says 
these busing systems will bring 
out many students who only 

live in Ann Arbor for their 
educational career, swaying the 
votes against the permanent 
residents living in the city. He 
expressed his concern with 
this affair.
“I am afraid that the buses 
will bring lots of non-residents 
to polling places where they 
will vote in city elections,” 
Majeske wrote to The Daily. 
“I am happy the resolution 
passed, I just like to vote ‘no 
with rights’ on stuff if I think 
more needs to be said.”
The 
Career 
Center’s 
JCPenney Suit Up event is 
taking place September 30, 
and will be busing students to 
JCPenney. CSG also passed a 
resolution to help sustain the 
Career Center’s Clothes Closet 
for non-traditional sizes.
Other 
resolutions 
passed 
included the fall 2018 CSG 
budget plan, as well as a 
resolution to amend the CSG 
election code. Under this new 
code, students would not be able 
to endorse the representatives 
through social media platforms 
without filling out the official 
endorsement paperwork.

on campus and the Latinx 
communities in Ann Arbor. 
In addition to the opening 
ceremony, La Casa is organizing 
events 
featuring 
Latinx 
professors and guest speakers 
such as Prof. Ruth Behar and 
Prof. Ashley Lucas.

The 
Center 
for 
Multi-
Ethnic 
Student 
Affairs 
and 
La 
Casa 
are 
working 
collaboratively to feature more 
than 20 events over the next 
month. 
This 
collaboration 
marks 
progress 
from 
last 
year’s boycott organized by La 
Casa against MESA, claiming 
they 
overlooked 
Latinx 
students on campus.
La 
Casa 
Lead 
Director 

Lesley Rivas, an LSA junior, 
explained how La Casa works 
to uplift Latinx students at the 
University.
“We try to give leadership 
opportunities where they can 
learn about their history, learn 
how to be activists on campus 
and how to take initiative,” 
she said. “The Latinx Heritage 
Month this year is really a 
product of many months of 

really hard work put on by 
students, 
staff 
and 
faculty, 
in contrast to last year when 
our 
heritage 
month 
wasn’t 
prioritized. This month we 
really 
emphasized 
the 
fact 
that we matter on campus, 
our community is a priority, 
especially right now because of 
how the families and students 
here are being impacted by 
everything politically, namely 

Trump’s administration and 
negative media portrayal.”
LSA 
sophomore 
Yosabeth 
Guerrero explained how she is 
continuously thankful for the 
community she has become 
a part of and the support it 
provides her.
“Being Latina means I’m able 
to represent my culture and be 
with people who look like me, 
people with the same skin tones 

and with the same practices 
and traditions,” Guerrero said. 
“It’s 
important, 
especially 
on this campus because it is 
a PWI, predominantly white 
institution, so when we get 
together, we form a coalition 
in order to provide a better 
support 
system 
amongst 
ourselves as a marginalized 
group on campus. I feel like I’m 
back home.”

an article published in Medium 
claimed the Stanford prison 
experiment 
lacks 
credibility. 
The article said new interviews 
revealed the guards had been 
coached, 
and 
raised 
other 
issues having to do with the 
methodology and replicability 
of the study.
The 
Stanford 
prison 
experiment is not the only 
example of canonical psychology 
research coming under fire. A 
number of studies –– including 
the Milgram experiment, which 
was 
meant 
to 
demonstrate 
the 
disturbing 
extent 
of 
human 
obedience 
–– 
have 
received 
criticism 
for 
lack 
of 
replicability 
or 
sloppy 
procedures. 
Many 
of 
these 
studies are considered essential 
to the field and appear in 
standard psychology textbooks.
According 
to 
Howard 
Kurtzman, 
acting 
executive 
director 
of 
the 
American 
Psychological 
Association’s 
Science 
Directorate, 
the 
problem of older psychology 
studies being re-evaluated is 
not new but part of a continual 
trend.
“I see this as a gradual 
process,” Kurtzman said. “There 
are some findings that we’ve 
thought were true that maybe 
aren’t, but more commonly the 
magnitudes of the effects may 
be smaller than we realized.”
Kurtzman said a major issue 
is that many older studies have 
been difficult for researchers 
to repeat due to a variety 
of 
factors 
including 
small 
sample sizes and careless use 
of 
statistical 
methods. 
He 
clarified replicability problems 
affect all scientific disciplines, 
not 
just 
psychology. 
The 

National Academies of Science, 
Engineering, and Medicine is 
currently conducting a study on 
reproducibility in science.
Over the past five to 10 years, 
Kurtzman said, the psychology 
community has been working 
to 
address 
the 
replicability 
crisis, focusing on increasing 
sample 
sizes, 
sharing 
data 
and pre-registering studies to 
promote transparency.
Because 
of 
the 
attention 
being 
paid 
to 
replicability 
issues, 
Kurtzman 
believes 
research quality and reliability 
will improve within the next 
10 to 20 years with journals 
and scientific funding agencies 
increasing their standards.
He 
estimated 
the 
field’s 
focus on high-quality research 
will begin to change teaching 
practices for psychology over 
the next five to 10 years.
“I 
think 
going 
forward 
research that is published in 
journals will be more reliable,” 
Kurtzman said. “All that will 
filter into teaching. I’m sure it’s 
being discussed already at the 
graduate level and seminars, and 
that will filter down, I think, to 
undergraduate 
teaching 
and 
eventually into textbooks.”
The replicability crisis has 
also become an area of focus 
for the University of Michigan 
Department 
of 
Psychology. 
Patricia 
Reuter-Lorenz, 
chair of the Department, said 
psychology faculty are well 
aware of the problem.
“I know that there’s been a 
lot of attention paid in smaller 
groups of faculty and graduate 
students in particular to the 
replication crisis and improving 
the rigor of research methods,” 
Reuter-Lorenz said. “We have 
several 
department-wide 
initiatives that are organized to 
achieve those goals.”
Though 
the 
department 

cannot dictate what professors 
teach, 
Reuter-Lorenz 
added, 
faculty 
are 
committed 
to 
training students to become 
good scientists.
“I don’t tell faculty they have 
to do things a particular way, 
but I think there’s enough of an 
appreciation for the importance 
of this that we have as a shared 
value that we will be rigorous 
in the methodologies that we 
teach,” Reuter-Lorenz said.
In addition to the replicability 
crisis, Reuter-Lorenz noted the 
University has been affected 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
standard 
studies like the Stanford prison 
experiment 
and 
Milgram 
experiment have been facing 
scrutiny.
“I think there’s some classic 
studies that have been part 
of many of our introductory 
classes and gateway classes that 
have come under fire, that have 
come under question, because of 
methods and ethics and things 
like that,” Reuter-Lorenz said.
Still, 
Reuter-Lorenz 
and 
Kurtzman 
said 
introductory 
psychology 
textbooks 
have 
not necessarily been updated 
to 
reflect 
controversies 
surrounding 
older, 
quintessential 
psychology 
studies. Kurtzman said whether 
older studies like the Stanford 
prison 
experiment 
remain 
in textbooks depends on the 
textbook 
author’s 
goal 
and 
approach.
“If a textbook author does 
address that study, they would 
be 
well-advised 
to 
include 
coverage of the controversies 
surrounding its methods and to 
address what it teaches us about 
the importance of institutional 
review boards,” Kurtzman said.
According to Reuter-Lorenz, 
this 
re-evaluation 
of 
older 
psychology studies has elicited 
a 
response 
from 
University 

psychology professors. She said 
faculty are generally aware of 
the issues with older studies 
and make sure to address them 
in class.
“Our 
instructors 
are 
cognizant of the importance 
of 
staying 
up-to-date 
on 
developments 
in 
the 
field, 
that’s why they’re here at 
the University of Michigan,” 
Reuter-Lorenz said. “Science 
is a work in progress. There’s 
always new discoveries and it’s 
very important that our faculty 
stay on top of those.”
In fact, Reuter-Lorenz added, 
the Society for the Teaching 
of Psychology published two 
papers in 2016 outlining how 
professors should cover studies 
with 
dubious 
methodology. 
One 
paper 
discussed 
the 
Stanford 
prison 
experiment 
while the othertouched on the 
Milgram experiment. Reuter-
Lorenz said one introductory 
psychology professor at the 
University has been using both 
to inform her teaching.
LSA senior Melissa Hall, who 
studies psychology, said older 
studies including the Stanford 
prison experiment, the Bobo 
doll experiment and the Genie 
experiment are still examined 
in 
introductory 
courses. 
Though Hall said she has not 
taken a psychology course that 
addressed the re-evaluation of 
these studies, her professors 
and 
classmates 
do 
discuss 
controversies surrounding older 
research.
“Often people will raise their 
hands and try and contradict the 
information and explain how 
there’s been controversy,” Hall 
said. “The professors would 
address it then, but they still use 
them as examples.”
According 
to 
Hall, 
many 
older psychology studies used 
methods that would not meet 

modern norms for scientific 
methodology or ethics. Those 
generational 
differences 
are 
typically 
addressed 
in 
her 
University classes, Hall said, 
though these older studies are 
still treated as valid examples.
“Many 
of 
these 
studies 
obviously took place many years 
ago, so we just kind of address 
the differences in generation 
and why it’s not all applicable 

nowadays,” Hall said.
Reuter-Lorenz said students 
can 
learn 
from 
discussing 
studies that are now considered 
flawed.
“There are better methods 
that can be used than were 
used in the past and they

Central Student Government funds 
Buses to Ballots student voter initiative


These past few months, The 
Michigan Daily readers have 
probably become a bit more 
mindful when using Facebook. 
Following 
the 
Cambridge 
Analytica 
scandal, 
people 
were outraged. So, we started 
clicking away on our profiles’s 
privacy settings, congratulating 
ourselves on our newly found 
concern for the data collected 
on us and maybe even stopped 
liking things so that advertisers 
wouldn’t know our interests. 
Indeed, Facebook did a lot of 
outrageous 
things 
with 
our 
data, 
like 
allowing 
housing 
advertisers to target their ads to 
only white people and employers 
to advertise jobs exclusively to 
young people. We might argue 
that our beloved social media 
platforms 
will 
slowly 
wash 
away their sins as journalists 
discover and report the misuses 
of their algorithms — seemingly 
holding Facebook and the like 
accountable. Is that the whole 
story, though?
With every piece of data 
collected about each one of us, 
and each algorithm that comes 
across our individual online 
trails, we become entangled in 
a system that takes ownership 
of our private lives. Algorithms 
and data collection form these 
sticky webs around our online 
and offline lives — that we both 
knowingly and unknowingly get 
stuck in. Once we clicked the 
“turn off” button in our privacy 
settings, it might feel as if we 
own our data once again — that 
we have liberated ourselves from 
some of the algorithmic sticky 
webs laid out all around us. But 
what about the less educated 
people, those who don’t know 
enough about privacy, people 
who maybe wouldn’t even be 
able 
to 
navigate 
Facebook’s 
privacy settings? They are still 
caught up in that web.
While some of us might 
be worried about advertisers 
collecting data on our love for 
burritos and our favorite series, 
others — who might not even 

know what to look out for — are 
often part of a stickier, denser 
part of the web: a web in which 
it’s not only Facebook and Netflix 
collecting their data.
At the beginning of this 
year, I came across an article 
published by ProPublica in 2016 
about a software used across the 
U.S. intended to collect data on 
defendants, process it and get a 
score. The score would predict 
people’s future as criminals — 
and it was biased against Black 
defendants. 
My 
inner 
geek 
who loved the idea of using 
math to predict future events 
was terrified by that article 
for a long time. So, I went on a 

journey via Google to discover 
what other algorithms were 
being used by the government. 
During my search, I came across 
a website filled with tips on 
possible algorithms used by the 
government. Then, I got stuck. 
I realized I knew nothing about 
how these algorithms worked. 
From where did they collect 
the data? Did they have data 
on everyone? How could you 
even get your hands on these 
algorithms and study them?
Thankfully, Prof. Virginia 
Eubanks blessed me (and all of 
us) with her book: “Automating 
Inequality,” which brings me 
back to our algorithmic sticky 
web we are all caught in. Her 
book shined a light on the 
denser, hidden parts of the web 
where people from low-income 
families might find themselves 
caught. She delves into three 
algorithms used in different 

states: one that decides citizens’ 
eligibility for welfare programs, 
one that assigns scores to people 
who find themselves homeless, 
and one which tries to predict 
child maltreatment in families. 
Read again that last sentence. 
All of them focus on low income 
citizens. 
Why? 
Because 
the 
government can only collect 
data from those who access 
welfare programs, adding them 
forever to a database, creating a 
score out of their past in order to 
categorize their future.
Still, as enlightening as books 
can be, they rarely offer us a step-
by-step guide to taking action. 
We are only college students 
and, for a lot of us, the closest 
we have come to algorithms are 
the recommendations offered 
by Amazon. There are some of 
us, like myself, who are not even 
American citizens, and so we 
obviously start wondering if all 
this algorithmic bias isn’t better 
fit for a Wired article or a late-
night talk in the dorms than as a 
wake-up alarm for protests. I’ve 
definitely faced these questions 
and I am still navigating them, 
but I am looking at all of us when 
I am saying this issue needs to 
be solved and discussed. Math 
and engineering students, take 
a break from your classes and 
take the time to understand the 
world where social justice takes 
precedence over the power of 
numbers and coding. Humanities 
and social science students, 
take a break from writing 
your paper because if you 
don’t intervene, concepts like 
justice and fairness will get to 
be shaped by a score given by 
an algorithm. School has just 
started, so don’t get so busy 
with your coursework that you 
forget to take in the influence 
that your work might have in 
a society changing at the pace 
of an algorithm giving you a 
score.

Don’t blame the border

Like many Americans, I spent 
this summer — one filled with 
political scandals and rampant pop 
culture gossip — haunted by one 
news story in particular: the story of 
Mollie Tibbetts, a University of Iowa 
student. Tibbetts’s disappearance 
prompted a national media circus, 
a desperate search and the ultimate 
discovery of her murder resulted in 
political outcry. 
Twenty-year-old Tibbetts was 
last seen before she went for a jog on 
the evening of July 18, 2018. She was 
reported missing the next morning 
when she did not show up for 
work, and for the next month her 
image was plastered on major news 
outlets and across social media. Her 
family pleaded for her safe return 
— a cry that went unanswered until 
August 21, 2018, when 24-year-old 
Cristhian Rivera confessed to her 
murder and led authorities to her 
body. Rivera later revealed that 
he came across Tibbetts on her 
evening jog, where he then pursued 
her both in his vehicle and on foot. 
She repeatedly told him to leave 
her alone, finally threatening to call 
the police. It was then that Rivera, 
angry at her blatant rejection, 
allegedly kidnapped and murdered 
Tibbetts, leaving her body in a vast 
cornfield.
There is much to be said about 
Mollie Tibbetts’s story, and many 
reasons why it resonated so strongly 
with the American people. There 
is the shock value of a wholesome 
young 
Midwestern 
woman 
meeting a violent and tragic end in 
a small sleepy town. Then there’s 
the political: Rivera’s contested 
legal status. This detail has been 
seized upon to support the anti-
immigration narrative of President 
Trump and other members of the 
Republican Party — a political move 
subsequently denounced by the 
victim’s father.
But 
among 
these 
various 
debates, one fact of her story 
remains clear: In 2018, among 
an age of anti-misogynist social 
movements and female political 
empowerment, it still remains 
dangerous, even potentially fatal, 
for a woman to reject the advances 
of a man. The hardest aspect to 

swallow of Tibbetts’s story is that 
it is not at all unique. In the days 
after her body was found, a 2016 
Runner’s World survey resurfaced. 
The survey asked readers, “How 
often, if ever, does a stranger 
whistle at you, comment on your 
body, needlessly honk at you, or give 
you other similar unsolicited sexual 
attention?” Forty-three percent of 
female respondents answered that 
they “sometimes, often, or always” 
encountered such attention during 
a run, while only 4 percent of their 
male counterparts reported the 

same. The statistics get even more 
abysmal from there. While only 
3 percent of female respondents 
reported any sort of physical 
contact or assault while on a run, 30 
percent reported being followed on 
foot or by car, 18 percent reported 
being sexually propositioned and 5 
percent reported being flashed.
Maybe, in light of Tibbetts’s 
murder, 
a 
whistle, 
honk 
or 
unwanted comment seems trivial, 
and there is undoubtedly a world 
of difference between a catcall 
and a murder. But ask any girl or 
woman above the age of 15, and 
she will certainly have an arsenal 
of instances of being leered at, 
whistled at, groped or spoken to like 
a sexual object by a man in a way 
that made her fear for her safety, or 
even her life.
These small instances build up 
to create a society in which women 
are taught to constantly be on edge. 
In this society, we’re instructed 
to never walk anywhere alone, 
especially at night, or if we must, 
to never wear headphones, to hold 
our keys between our fingers to use 
as a potential weapon and to carry 

pepper spray. We’re taught that 
simply existing as a woman makes 
us an open invitation to men, and 
we must do everything in our power 
to make ourselves less inviting, to 
dress ourselves in modest clothing, 
to wear less makeup and to drink 
less alcohol. We’ve had to hold 
ourselves responsible for crimes in 
which we were victimized. Perhaps 
most difficult of all, we’ve been 
conditioned to view every man as 
a potential threat, even the ones we 
think we trust and know intimately.
While Tibbetts fell victim to 
the violence of a stranger, women 
are overwhelmingly more likely to 
be stalked, threatened, assaulted 
or murdered by men they know. In 
fact, as reported by the National 
Organization for Women, every 
day three women are murdered by 
an intimate partner, and up to one-
third of female homicide victims are 
killed by their partners. The stories 
of these women are not as widely 
shared as that of Mollie Tibbetts, 
maybe because as a society we hold 
them responsible for their deaths 
because they closely knew their 
attackers, or maybe because they 
are disproportionately low-income 
women of color.
Yet, 
these 
women, 
along 
with Mollie Tibbetts and the 
smattering of other women who 
make headlines from time to time, 
highlight the fear that accompanies 
the everyday actions of women. 
Actions as habitual as going for 
a run. When it comes down to it, 
Mollie Tibbetts was not killed by 
illegal immigration, or because 
she made the “mistake” of going 
for a run by herself. She, along 
with thousands of other women 
annually, fell victim to a culture that 
encourages male entitlement and 
toxic masculinity. She was killed by 
a man enraged with her exercising 
her theoretical right to say no, a 
right that was stripped away from 
her and so many others. If we really 
want to address the violence that 
brought Tibbetts to her end, we 
need not look to our borders, but at 
ourselves. Until we rectify a society 
that places male desire above

The patriotism of immigration

AARON BAKER | COLUMN

President Donald Trump’s 
position 
on 
immigration 
is 
blatantly unpatriotic. Through 
his comments and actions as 
a 
candidate 
and 
President, 
we know he is no fan of 
undocumented 
immigrants 
from Mexico and elsewhere. 
Many Trump supporters say it’s 
only illegal immigration that 
the President is opposed to, but 
the fact is that the president’s 
war against legal immigration 
is equally, if not more fervent 
than his efforts against illegal 
immigration.
President 
Trump 
has 
proposed to cut legal immigration 
in half by weakening the family 
ties clause of our immigration 
system that allows legal residents 
to sponsor family members. He 
wants to limit naturalization for 
legal immigrants if they have 
ever used government welfare 
programs. He has also cut the 
number of green cards we grant 
and is lessening the number 
of asylum seekers we accept. 
And let’s not forget his leaked 
comments that he doesn’t want 
people — legal or illegal — from 
“shithole” 
countries 
— 
each 
of which was poor and brown 
— 
immigrating here. Why are 
Trump’s immigration policies 
unpatriotic?
 In one of former President 
Ronald Reagan’s last televised 
addresses 
as 
president, 
he 
explained why he felt America 
was an exceptional country: 
“America represents something 
universal in the human spirit … 
Anybody from any corner of the 
world can come to America to 
live and become an American.” 
Reagan’s patriotism is rooted in 
the belief that American values 
are universal. That is, anyone 
should be able to become an 
American because the American 
identity is rooted in its values.
This 
is 
called 
civic 
nationalism, where the national 
identity is based on shared values 
rather than a shared perceptible 
identity. Late Sen. John McCain 
echoed 
Reagan’s 
sentiment 
last May, when he said that you 
don’t even need to know English 
to be fully American, you only 
need to have American values. 
What are these values? I would 
say they are they are pretty 
clearly delineated in the U.S. 
Constitution and the Declaration 
of Independence. They are a 
capacious set of values rooted 
in the basic liberal tradition of 
free speech, individual rights 

and due process. These values 
can incorporate a wide variety 
of political positions, ideologies, 
religions and cultures.
The 
vast 
majority 
of 
countries 
in 
the 
world 
are 
nation-states with an ethnic, 
religious or hegemonic cultural 
identity that serves as the basis 
of their national identity. Nation-
states like China, Italy or India 
have 
commonly 
perceived 
shared traits, like traditions, 
religious beliefs or histories 
that many citizens associate 
with their national identity. If 
you lie outside these common 
traits, integrating as a fully 
equal citizen in social and even 
sometimes legal terms can be 
hard. The extent of exclusivity 
to the national identities of the 
nation-states of the world varies, 
but I would argue none come 
close to the level of inclusivity 
the American identity has had 
in recent history. We grew up 
calling America a nation of 
immigrants for a reason.
But it was only in 1965, after 
the 
Civil 
Rights 
Movement 
had left its mark, that America 
liberalized 
its 
immigration 
policy and became the country 
Reagan and McCain praised. 

From 1924 to 1965, America 
closed its doors with the passage 
of the Immigration Act of 1924. 
An ethnic and racial hierarchy 
was codified in a quota system 
that essentially only let Northern 
Europeans enter. 
Back then, xenophobia was 
directed toward not only non-
European 
groups, 
but 
also 
European 
groups 
perceived 
as threatening to the Anglo-
American character of America. 
Italians, Jews, Irish and at one 
point even Germans, threatened 
the homogeneity of the dominant 
culture. Italians, the Irish and 
the Jews were considered non-
white races and faced widespread 
discrimination. Eventually, all 
of these groups integrated into 
the dominant culture, a process 

which changed the immigrant 
groups but also changed the 
country for the better. America, 
despite the incessant plague of 
xenophobia, has continually been 
shaped by immigrants.
Since 1965, after the repeal 
of the Immigration Act of 1924, 
America’s demographics have 
begun to unsurprisingly change 
drastically. By 2065, so long 
as current rate of immigration 
remains constant, 46 percent of 
America will be white creating a 
majority-minority nation. When 
Trump said he doesn’t want 
people from shithole countries, 
he was harkening back to the 
tradition of xenophobia that 
resulted in the 1924 act. In fact, 
Attorney General Jeff Sessions 
actually cited the Immigration 
Act of 1924 as a model for 
current immigration policy in an 
interview with Breitbart News 
Network.
The fear that immigrants 
perceived as different cannot 
integrate into American society is 
clearly not new. And it is as wrong 
now as it was wrong in 1924. The 
implicit argument today that 
non-European immigrants carry 
an immutable cultural alienness 
that renders them unable to 
integrate into American society 
is 
incorrect. 
Yet, 
Hispanic 
immigrants, most often the target 
of anti-immigration rhetoric, are 
integrating into American society 
just as European immigrants 
have integrated in the past. Like 
President Reagan said, anyone 
can become American because 
anyone can live by the values of 
liberty and justice and strive to 
uphold these values when we all 
seem to be falling short.
Economic arguments against 
immigration similarly fall short 
of the facts and succumb to 
misperceptions. 
Immigrants 
contribute to the economy rather 
than slow it down. Immigrants 
are more likely than native-born 
Americans to start a business and 
contribute a net increase to the 
living standards of the average 
American. The impetus against 
immigration is largely a visceral 
fear that someone who looks 
different or practices a different 
religion can’t have the same 
values or way of life. But isn’t the 
true testament to the strength 
of our values the fact that we 
believe anyone can live by them?

‘Most Assasinated’ fails 
as dull murder mystery

NETFLIX

A sports article in an arts 

column. It feels perverse. Are 
there not enough articles written 
about sports already, both in this 
paper and in others around the 
world? Surely there are more 
important things to write about 
in the field of entertainment, 
the return of fall TV, the fall 
of a CBS mogul, the ways in 
which 
Netflix 
and 
Amazon 

are changing the way we view 
movies or some other such 
subject. But sports are what are 
currently on my mind. Or rather, 
if there is a futility in being a 
fan of certain sports. Michigan 
Football is a religion after all, 
and not one with much basis in 
reality. Most fans of sports are 
indoctrinated into the fandom 
in some way or another. Unlike 
other kinds of fandom, sports 
fans often don’t choose their 
teams, their teams choose them. 
That only makes it feel even more 
disheartening when you realize 
this form of entertainment you 
are so attached to is doomed to 
continually let you down.

I’ve been a Michigan Football 

fan for literally my entire life. 
I was in the womb during 
that fateful 1997 season and 
unknowingly 
attended 
many 

victories that would allow the 
Wolverines to go on and win 
the national championship. The 
overpriced hot dogs and stale 
popcorn of Michigan Stadium 
were in my bloodstream from 
the very beginning. The idea of 
rooting for a college team other 
than Michigan is anathema to 
me; it goes against the very fabric 
of who I believe I am. And yet 
after the Notre Dame game two 
weeks ago I felt something I’d 
never felt before as a Michigan 
Football 
fan: 
uninterest. 
As 

the game wound to a close and 

Michigan seemed to have some 
kind of miracle chance to come 
back and win the game I could 
not find it in myself to conjure 
up even the faintest of hopes like 
those around me. I’d seen this 
movie too many times before.

College sports, to the vast 

majority of people who watch 
them, are nothing more than 
entertainment. Win, lose, come 
back from behind, blow out a bad 
team — it’s an excuse to take a 
break from the real world for a 
few hours, eat junk food, hang 
out with your friends, drink and 
feel as though you are a part of 
something larger than yourself. 
At the end of the day it won’t 
truly impact your life in any way 
if Michigan wins or loses and 
in ten, 20, or 30 years from now 
most people won’t even be able 
to remember the games that we 
won and the games that we lost. 
But year in and year out, 100,000 
people in Ann Arbor continue 
to pay increasingly expensive 
fees to attend the games and by 
and large they are continually 
disappointed. 
Michigan 
has 

beaten Ohio State just once in my 
memory. We’ve beaten Michigan 
State a few times. I cannot recall 
Michigan winning a Big Ten 
championship. Some part of me 
realizes we must have when I was 
younger, but I have no memories 
of such an event, only vague 
recollections of getting blown out 
by a west coast team in the Rose 
Bowl. Such is the tragedy of being 
a lifelong Michigan fan.

So why do I keep watching? 

Why do we keep watching? Why 
do we keep spending money, 
time and energy on something 
that brings us pain? It’s a sad 
devotion to an ancient religion 
that has given us little reason 
to actually be loyal to it. If a 
television series I like starts 
to go down the toilet, I’ll stop 
watching. If a movie franchise I 
enjoy becomes complete garbage, 
I’ll stop going to see it. But with 
sports, people will continue to 
support even the most hopeless 
of teams for decades on end. Do 
the people who pay money to 

watch the Cleveland Browns 
get embarrassed year after year 
feel as though their money is 
being well spent? How about 
the people who went to see the 
Lions redefine the meaning of 
the word abysmal on Monday 
night? Is there not something 
else they would rather be doing? 
As Jerry Seinfeld once noted, 
it’s really the clothes that we are 
rooting for. Players will leave the 
team or go to a different team, 
coaches will come and go and 
only the colors and the clothes 
remain through it all. The Every 
Three Weekly recently published 
a piece lampooning the idea that 
students self worth was tied 
directly to the performance of the 
Michigan Football team in a way 
that can’t be explained by any 
rhythm or reason; for many on 
this campus, that is their reality. 
Being a Michigan Football fan 
is like returning to a partner 
who constantly plays with your 
emotions, who gives you nothing 

back, who is a constant drain on 

your wallet and your time and 
whom you only continue to run 

back to because you literally do 
not know what it would be like 
not to do so.

Being a sports fan means being 

a fan of something that does not 
care about you, that is designed to 
entertain you and nothing more. 
It distracts you from the more 
important and more worthy 
things in your life — a cold hearted 
business masquerading as school 
spirit. It’s entertainment with no 
end in sight, no world in which 
you’re ever satisfied and no way 
to ever fully escape from the 
horrible grip that it has on your 
soul. Colleges and the world 
would perhaps be a better place if 
people didn’t care nearly so much 
about it.

I’ll see you at the game on 

Saturday.

The Futility of Sports as 

Entertainment

ENTERTAINMENT COLUMN

FILM REVIEW

The Netflix original “The 

Most 
Assassinated 
Woman 

in the World,” released last 
Friday, is a bland rehashing 
of the murder mystery genre, 
the thematic conceit being 
the altogether lack of mystery 
involved 
(there’s 
only 
one 

possible suspect and guess 
what happens in the end!). 
“Most Assassinated” feels like 
one of those movies that Netflix 

green-lighted to fill a quota for 
main menu titles rather than 
an attempt at expanding the 
universe of human expression. 
I honestly don’t know how the 
script just didn’t end up as an 
episode of “Bones” eight years 
ago.

The “Most Assassinated,” 

(yet very much still alive) 
woman at the center of the film, 
Paula Maxa (Anna Mouglalis, 
“Baron 
noir”), 
is 
a 
stage 

actress famous for her gory, 
pantomimed deaths. In fact, 
the troupe she stars in, and 
the theater that houses them 
all, specializes on her nightly 
demises, packing the theater 
wall to wall six days a week 
for a series of bloody scenes 
with little to no plot beyond 
the stabbing, hanging, crushing 
and lashing of that particular 
evening. And the audience only 
really wants to see the gore, 
the theater’s whole business 
model riding on the draw of 
perversion for droves of thrill-
stymied 
Parisians. 
In 
this, 

“Most Assassinated” happens 
upon 
a 
fairly 
interesting 

quandary, though it’s never 
fleshed out; the film half-posits 
the question of, one, who is 
more morally reprehensible, 
the ones killing each other 
on stage, or the hoards of 
spectators returning time and 
time to see it? And two, what 
would the effect of such a 
theatrical institution have on 
a city? Is it a pressure-release 
valve that could give someone 
the outlet they need to avoid 
acting out the perversions on 
their own? Or is it a motivating, 
exemplifying danger that only 
puts the city at higher risk?

Yet instead of forging on in 

this more interesting direction, 
“Most Assassinated” falls back 
into a dull murder mystery 
type without enough suspects 
or possibilities for any of the 
crimes shown to really grab the 
attention. Basically, everything 
wrong that happens to the 
actress Maxa is perpetrated by 
one, polio-stricken, rebuked-
courter from Maxa’s past — an 
older man named Jean. The 
pathos of “Most Assassinated” 
is set up to come from Maxa’s 
figurative perch just out of 
reach of his dangerous clutches, 
only one false step away from 
his murderous grasp. It fails, 
however, to give any dimension 
to the two of them or to the 
relationship they once had. His 
motives are never understood 
past his perverse desire to 
watch her die, making the cat 
and mouse chase that is the 
second two-thirds of the movie 
a little dry to watch.

The issues at the core of 

“Most 
Assassinated” 
stem 

mostly from the characters’ 
lack of character. The film is 
over-saturated by characters 
that don’t seem to have any 
inclinations past what they 
quip about to each other on 
screen. It wouldn’t be the end 
of the world if it were just the 
peripheral 
characters 
who 

lacked any dimension, but even 
Maxa herself is missing any 
intrigue behind her actions. 
Perhaps a woman on the run 
for her life doesn’t need a grand 
underlying philosophy behind 
the doorway stoops she hides 
in, but it would be nice to see 
her choices in allies backed up 
at all.

Had 
“Most 
Assassinated” 

leaned further into the guts and 
gore on-stage, incorporating it 

into theater’s dark underbelly, 
the film could have been spun 
into a compelling thriller or 
horror flick. As it stands, the 
bloodshed is used as fictitiously 
in the film as it is used on Paula 
Maxa’s stage. And of course, all 
my ponderings on how the film 
could have been tweaked to go 
a little further are derivations 
of the issues first mentioned 
above — the film lacks a 
philosophy on the events it puts 
on screen; it doesn’t try to say 
anything.

As 
a 
conditional 

recommendation, it’s not the 
worst movie to put on and talk 
over with a group of friends. 
The 
confusing, 
yet-to-be 

resolved twists that happen in 
the last 10 or 11 minutes can 
be fun to laugh about after 
the fact, but it’s nowhere near 
worth watching alone. If you’re 
looking for a refresher for your 
third-semester French, maybe 
go watch something by Rhomer 
(specifically “Claire’s Knee”).

‘Kidding’ showcases the 
best sides of Jim Carrey

Throughout 
his 
nearly 

20-year career, Jim Carrey 
has 
become 
one 
of 
the 

most 
recognizable 
faces 

in 
Hollywood. 
Film 
after 

film, he has delivered iconic 
performances through dramatic 
movements 
and 
charismatic 

acting. Oftentimes his movies 
are pure comedy, using Carrey’s 
naturally goofy essence to craft 
a lovable and dumb character. 
Others present a warped reality 
— part comedy, part drama — 
Carrey’s highly emotive face 
telling the audience exactly 
how they should be feeling.

His 
newest 
project, 

“Kidding,” falls in the latter 
category. A rare journey into 
television, Carrey assumes the 
role of children’s television star 
Jeff (Mr. Pickles), a Mr. Rogers-
esque character who struggles 
to balance the happy-go-lucky 

nature of his popular TV show 
with the crushing realities of 
his own life. On television, Mr. 
Pickles is a smiling, singing 
and sweater-wearing man who 
radiates joy. In real life, Jeff is a 
seperated husband coping with 
the loss of his young son Phil 

(Cole Allen, “Professor Isle’s 
Laboratory”).

“Kidding” 
succeeds 
in 

making the viewer feel the 
exact 
tug-of-war 
that 
Jeff 

himself is experiencing. The 
series premiere is bright and 
happy, featuring bouncy songs 
and warm colors. Yet there are 
glimpses of the darkness Jeff 
is facing and those glimpses 
grow bigger as the episode 
progresses.

The 
episode 
opens 
on 

Conan’s talk show, with Mr. 
Pickles being interviewed and 
dedicating a sweet little song 
to his wife, Jill (Judy Greer, 
“Driven”). As he sings “You can 
feel, anything at all, anything 
at all, you can feel,” the scene 
shifts to Jeff returning to his 
dingy hotel room, straightening 
the hair of a drunkenly passed-
out teen and putting on a violent 
movie. Later the viewers find 
out that Mr. Pickles is separated 
from the wife he sang to, and, in 
fact, he cannot feel very much at 
all. While Mr. Pickles promotes 
the expression of emotion, Jeff 
is wearing a mask of happiness 
as he internalizes deep trauma 
and sadness over the death of 
his son.

In 
the 
pilot, 
this 
mask 

is 
artfully 
shown 
through 

the formatting of the show 
itself. The general vibe is 
lighthearted, but as Jeff begins 
to break down, the atmosphere 
of the show does as well. In the

Series Premiere

Assasinated 

Woman”

Netflix

beginning there are only short, 
sporadic cuts to the tragedy 
that underlies the plot. Between 
scenes, a car crashes into the 
screen or a green traffic light 
glitches, referencing the death 
of Jeff’s son in a car accident. 
These 
scenes 
grow 
longer 

and more intense as Jeff loses 
control of his life, his family and 
even of his very own likeness.

The 
ending 
scene 
in 

particular sticks out, as the 
cohesive 
persona 
Jeff 
has 

maintained instantly falls apart. 
In the final minutes of the pilot, 
Jeff rushes home and shaves 
through the center of his head, 

leaving him looking crazed and 
unsettled. The obsession with 
his wife that has shown itself 
throughout the episode comes 
to a peak as he buys the house 
directly across from her. He is 
able to spy on her through the 
window and when he sees her 
with another man, Jeff rips a 
faucet out of the wall. In this 
vital scene, “Kidding” tells 
its viewers from this point 
on, Jeff’s life will cease being 
polished and contained.

Every scene in “Kidding” 

binds together to craft a show 
that perfectly maps the life and 
demise of this troubled man. It 

is almost unsettling in the way 
a horror movie is: Even when 
everything 
feels 
right, 
you 

can’t help feel that something 
is about to go horribly wrong. 
It 
is 
beautifully 
disturbing 

and 
hauntingly 
reminiscent 

of the lives of Robin Williams 
or Anthony Bourdain — real, 
beloved stars who hid dark 
lives behind a veil of smiles 
and comedy. “Kidding” will 
no doubt be a shining mark on 
the legacy of Jim Carrey, one 
that speaks to his ability to add 
comedy to thoughtful topics, 
and leave us all wondering if we 
really should be laughing.

After the Notre 
Dame game two 
weeks ago I felt 
something I’d 
never felt before 
as a Michigan 
Football fan: 
uninterest

Why do we 

keep watching? 
Why do we keep 
spending money, 
time and energy 
on something that 

brings us pain?

Anxiety in the key of Stevie Wonder 

In April, I’m asked to write 

about an album cover I think is 
important, and I choose Talking 
Book by Stevie Wonder. I admire 
its candor and closeness: the first 
album cover to show him without 
his glasses. He looks more 
vulnerable than on his previous 
covers, 
and 
simultaneously 

more introspective and mature. 
I admire Wonder for his drive 
to evolve, to maneuver through 
new sounds and 
ideas; by 21, he 
was writing and 
producing 
all 

his own music. 
He had an early 
pop phase and a 
“classic period,” 
all by the time he 
was 25. I yearn 
for that level of 
self-awareness, 
self-confidence, 
self-sufficiency.

I listen to the 

album while I’m 
writing, and I get 
addicted. I march 
around town to 
the twangy beat 
of “Maybe Your 
Baby,” 
the 
sly 

chorus 
echoing 

on a loop in my head: “Maybe 
your baby done made some other 
plans.”

Midsummer, I buy a record 

player from an old high school 
classmate for 40 dollars. I’ve 
always wanted a record player. 
I don’t own any records other 
than a few I found for free 
at a yard sale last summer in 
Baltimore — some Tchaikovsky 
and Mozart, the Beach Boys’ 
L.A. (Light Album), a frayed folk 

compendium, 
Eminem’s 
The 

Marshall Mathers LP — because 
until now I’ve never had a valid 
reason to buy them. I ask my 
brother if I can look through 
his 
collection, 
gifted 
from 

my grandfather several years 
ago, and in those cardboard 
boxes, I unearth gold mines: 
Louis Prima, Ray Charles, The 
Beatles, Aretha Franklin. The 
one Stevie Wonder record I find 
is Talking Book, and I listen to it 
about twice as often as I listen to 
everything else combined.

As I’m nearing the end of a 

novel I’ve been 
working on for 
six 
months, 

my family flies 
west 
to 
visit 

the 
National 

Repertory 
Orchestra. 
In 

Denver, we see an 
exhibit featuring 
works by Jeffrey 
Gibson, 
which 

incorporates 
beading, 
weaving, 
neon 

lights, electricity, 
video and color 
all over the place. 
I’m 
enamored. 

The 
exhibit 
is 

titled 
“Like 
a 

Hammer,” 
after 

the 
idea 
that 

someone who is “like a hammer” 
is “capable of building up and 
tearing down.”

One material Gibson uses is 

song lyrics, and I spend several 
minutes staring at a decorated 
punching bag entitled “You 
Can Feel It All Over.” The 
description on the wall quotes 
“Sir Duke” and mentions the 
creative venture of reworking 
the words, of channeling joy 
into pain and vice versa. I take a 

picture of the punching bag and 
the description.

Writing the last chapter or 

two of my book on this trip, I 
start thinking about what will 
come afterward: I’m proud of 
the book, and I want to query 
it, to enter it in contests, to find 
an agent and get it published. 
I’m 
indirect 
and 
wishful 

when I talk about these things 
with my family and friends — 
 

“Published? If only,” I say, or, 
“That would be a 
dream come true” 
— but it is what 
I want. If not for 
this book, then for 
the next I write, or 
the next. However 
long it takes, it’s 
what I want, less 
in a dream way, 
more in a goal way.

I’m not close, 

but I do feel closer 
with 
this 
book 

than 
I’ve 
ever 

felt before. The 
prospect 
makes 

me 
incredibly 

nervous. I think 
about 
failure 

constantly. I teeter 
between optimism 
and 
realism, 

excitement 
and 

levelheadedness. 
Day by day, I coach 
myself with the 
same advice Stevie 
Wonder will give me later in the 
summer: “Be cool. Be calm. Keep 
yourself 
together.” 
Someday 

it will strike me as funny how 
that’s what the song tells you to 
do when the music itself sounds 
so jittery and urgent.

I start revising, and as I revise, 

I begin finding weak words in 
all of my writing: “felt like,” 
“slightly,” “kind of.” “Maybe” 
seems particularly common. Is 
particularly common.

Even when Wonder’s songs 

are excited and happy, there’s 
an element of apprehension. I 
know everyone relates to music 
differently, and this could be 
my own projecting. But I can’t 
think of him without thinking 
of the restlessness of “Higher 
Ground,” the bursting nostalgia 
of “I Wish,” the existential 
wariness of “Pastime Paradise.” 
The insecurity of “All Day 
Sucker,” “My World Is Empty 
Without You” and “Bang Bang 
(My Baby Shot Me Down).” 
Sometimes it’s in the melody, 
sometimes the lyrics, sometimes 
both. Yet I continue to associate 
Wonder’s music with happiness, 
the way I always have: music for 
a good mood, for inspiration, 
faith, joy, for picking yourself 
back up again.

I have my first real panic 

attack in June. I’m actually not 
sure if it’s the first I’ve ever had, 
but it’s the first I’ve decided to 
name, anyway. Two hours later, 
I drive the five hours from Ind. 
to Mich. I usually listen to music 
the whole way. It’s a tradition 
I love: singing my heart out, 
alone and loving it. A five-hour-
long concert where the venue 
is my car and the star and the 
audience are both me, no one 
else to worry about.

This time, I worry about 

everything 
that 
crosses 
my 

mind. I listen to half of “Hem of 
Her Dress” by First Aid Kit, two 
or three minutes, then turn the 
music off in the middle of the 
song. The rest of the five-hour 
drive I spend in silence.

I get startled easily. I say 

this sentence all the time as 
half-explanation, 
half-apology 

for jumping into the air when 
someone 
surprises 
me 
by 

opening a door or saying “hello” 
when I didn’t know they were 
there. Lately, it’s been getting 
pretty comical. A dog will start 
barking, and I’ll fall out of my 
chair. Sometimes I even gasp, my 
hand flying to my heart like I’m 
a woman out of some Southern 
melodrama. 
I 
don’t 
know 

whatever got me 
to be so uptight 
(“everything is 
all right,” my 
mind sings), but 
this is one of 
the things about 
myself 
I’ve 

decided to just 
go with.

Sometimes 

I get tired of 
music. I love it, 
and I surround 
myself 
with 

other 
people 

who love it, and 
it 
seems 
like 

they never get 
tired of it. But 
I do. I get tired 
of books, too, 
reading 
and 

writing. 
My 

passions 
stem 

from the works 
and people who 
make me back 

up to the things I love: Mitski. 
 

“The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the 
Galaxy.” Haydn. Tomi Adeyemi. 
First Aid Kit.

This happens to me toward 

the end of Aug., with Stevie 
Wonder’s Down to Earth. I’m 
finally about to start querying 
my science fiction novel, and 
Down To Earth is exactly where 
I’d like to be, so I put it on shuffle 
at the beginning of a 20-minute 
car ride.

I’ve never heard of it before, 

and when I press play, I’m 
expecting to have to skip songs, 
make 
concessions. 
But 
I’ve 

underestimated Wonder, who 
was only 16 when he released 
it. The album wraps me up 
and carries me away. Suddenly 
there’s no place I’d rather be than 
here, “Sixteen Tons” trailing me 
like a ghost on a moonlit drive. 
Pulling up next to my mother’s 
house to “A Place in the Sun,” I 
spend five minutes accelerating 
and reversing, inching my car 
closer to the curb, even though 
it’s the suburbs and nobody 
cares. No one will crash into me

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

How I learned to 
dance on two feet

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

I’ve always been a bit of 

an awkward dancer, far more 
comfortable tossing my body 
around in a crowded concert 
pit than following any sort 
of rhythm. Being a closeted 
homosexual for nearly 20 
years certainly didn’t help, 
fueling my anxiety over my 
outward image — constantly 
battling the “faggot”s spewed 
my 
way 
throughout 
my 

teenage years, the “Still no 
girlfriend?”s from my family, 
the urges to belt out some 
Britney Spears lyrics at the 
top of my lungs.

It was, in no lesser words, 

exhausting.

And then I moved to college 

and I began to go to house 
parties and then bars where 
dancing is the social norm, 
and I was absolutely mortified 
(unless my BAC was a bit 
higher than what is considered 
“healthy,” of course). I was 
mostly conservative on the 
dance 
floor, 
moving 
only 

one foot at a time, never 
daring to risk the fluidity, 
the natural ease of two feet. 
The 
deeply 
internalized 

homophobia 
of 
my 
youth, 

steeped in Catholicism, was a 
fickle venom, infecting all my 
actions with “What if this is 
too gay?”

Making the full leap from 

punk and indie to pop was a 
bit of an awkward period in 
my life. Spending my high 
school years as a “scene” kid 
whose 
playlists 
consisted 

heavily of Passion Pit, A Day 
To Remember and Modern 
Baseball, I only began to really 
explore my love for pop music 
during my last year living in 
my parents’ home; I waited for 
eight hours in line for a Marina 
and the Diamonds concert, 
accompanied by flashes of 
embarrassment with an outfit 
on that was far better suited 
for Warped Tour.

Lorde’s 
Pure 
Heroine, 

Taylor Swift’s Red and Lana 
Del Rey’s Born To Die were 
absolutely 
critical 
albums 

during this volatile period 
in my life, helping me get in 

touch with a vulnerability I 
repeatedly swallowed out of 
fear. Lorde’s “Ribs” helped 
me make peace with growing 
up; “All Too Well” gave me 
a glimpse of the intimacy 
I denied myself during my 
adolescence; 
“Off 
To 
The 

Races” showed me the power 
in femininity.

Slowly but surely, I began to 

surround myself with people 
who made me feel more at ease 
in my own skin, mostly fellow 
queers who helped me find my 
rhythm in my newfound love 
of pop. Without even realizing 
it, I began to dance with two 
feet, to allow my hands to 
rise above my head and fall 
to my knees. After living 
years and years on a tense 
ledge threatening to crumble 
beneath me at any moment, 
it was like having lungs that 
fully inflated for the first 
time. I had finally learned to 
love the music that had always 
drawn me like a magnet.

I mentioned before that I 

didn’t notice when or how I 
began to dance with two feet 
because it was like learning to 
ride a bike. Now, the occasional 
instances of homophobia don’t 
hurt me the way one would 
expect anymore, like a slap 
to the face or a dagger to the 
heart. Rather, it now serves 
as a reminder to shake my ass 
the second I hear the deep 
bass of Ariana Grande’s “Into 
You” burst through a speaker, 
to share a drunken screech 
of excitement at the opening 
saxophone 
of 
Carly 
Rae 

Jepsen’s “Run Away with Me” 
and let it all go when Lorde’s 
“Supercut” rings through my 
ears.

I went out to Rick’s a few 

days ago, possibly the most 
oppressively 
anti-queer 

establishment in Ann Arbor, 
and rather than feeling the 
effects of the old venom that 
haunted my veins, I finally 
noticed just how comfortable I 
finally was on the dancefloor. 
Like learning how to ride a 
bike, the hypervisibility that 
is inevitably forced upon me 
in a space like Rick’s didn’t 
cost me my newfound rhythm 
rather reinforced it as a life 
skill.

here. I just want to hear the end 
of the song.

A few minutes later, like a 

cliché or a fiction, I pause in 
the middle of “The Lonesome 
Road” and turn off the car.

I don’t think about Stevie 

Wonder all the time, or I didn’t 
use to. Most of the moments I 
thought about him this summer 
didn’t feel like landmarks at the 
time, and it’s only in looking 
back that I see any thread at 
all. At the time they only felt 
like moments that were worth 
attending to. I’m hoping that’s 
the case with this piece of 
writing; I’m writing it because 
I can’t sort through myself 
alone and no musician can do it, 
either, not even Stevie Wonder, 
but there are times when it 
feels like the two might help 
each other along. This piece 

isn’t meant to be entirely about 
Stevie Wonder, but I wouldn’t 
have included him if I’d thought 
it was entirely about me, either. 
It’s about something in between 
somewhere — about the way 
music enters our lives, not 
only as a soundtrack, but as a 
translation of something very 
close to us, a message to be 
decoded.

It occurred to me as strange 

the other day that “Angel Baby 
(Don’t You Ever Leave Me)” 
never got as popular as “Uptight 
(Everything’s 
Alright).” 
It’s 

catchy and just as upbeat. Maybe 
it’s because it’s a more insecure 
song and people really do want 
everything to be alright. Then 
again, “Superstition” was a hit, 
so maybe I’m wrong. Maybe 
people love a good anxiety 
story.

Even when 

Wonder’s songs 
are excited and 
happy, there’s 
an element of 
apprehension

Sometimes I get 
tired of music. 
I love it, and I 

surround myself 

with other 

people who love 
it, and it seems 
like they never 

get tired of it. But 

I do

‘M’ shuts out Marquette for fourth straight win

On 
Monday 
night, 
the 
scoreboard read 3-0 at the half. 
For the coaches and players, 
though, the game was still 
scoreless. The Michigan men’s 
soccer team (4-1) did not want to 
not fall victim to the same fate as 
the previous game.
The 
Wolverines 
found 
themselves in a familiar situation: 
a multi-goal lead going into the 
half. Last Friday, Michigan was 
up 2-0 against Western Michigan. 
In the second half of that game, 
the Broncos stormed back to 
force overtime in a game that the 
Wolverines eventually won.
But in the second half on 
Monday night, Michigan played 
like a team determined to win 
in regulation. Led by a stingy 
backline, the Wolverines earned 
a shutout over Marquette (2-3) — 
the first victory over the Golden 
Eagles 
in 
five 
head-to-head 
matches all-time — and their 
fourth consecutive win of the 
season.
The first 10 minutes of the 
match featured back-and-forth 
play with neither team having a 
clear advantage in possession. 
Any control Michigan had on the 
attack throughout the opening 
minutes of the game was featured 
almost exclusively on the left side 
of the pitch. Sophomore forward 
Umar Farouk Osman created a 
few early scoring opportunities, 
using his pace to create space in 
the attacking third but couldn’t 
capitalize on the chances.
Sophomore defender Austin 
Swiech opened up scoring in the 
12th minute. As the ball trickled 
out of the 18-yard box in what 
became a broken play off of a 
corner kick, Swiech fired in a low 
shot that found the right corner 
of the net past outstretched 
goalkeeper Cedrik Stern for his 
first career goal.
“It was rolling out to me, how 
we do it in training,” Swiech said. 
“I just saw it and struck it low and 
into traffic and I hoped it went in 
or for a deflection to go in.”

After 
Swiech’s 
goal, 
the 
Wolverines not only took the lead 
but also control of the game.
Just over a minute later, 
good ball movement in the 
attacking third found open senior 
midfielder and captain Robbie 
Mertz inside the 18-yard box, 
who slotted the ball past the right 
side of Stern, to give his team a 
2-0 advantage.
Michigan kept the pressure 
on the Golden Eagles’ defense, 
squandering 
Marquette’s 
offensive 
momentum 
and 
dominating play particularly on 
the right side of the field through 
junior forward Jack Hallahan.
The 
Wolverines 
earned 
a 
pair of corner kicks in the 27th 
minute. After a weak clearance 
on the second corner, the ball 
found Hallahan on the right side 
of the pitch outside the 18-yard 
box. Hallahan then curled in a 
left-footed shot towards the far 
post, just under the crossbar 

and over a leaping Stern, giving 
Michigan a commanding 3-0 lead 
going into the half.
“(Hallahan’s) 
scored 
some 
fabulous goals here at Michigan,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Chaka 
Daley. “So, it didn’t surprise me 
when he put it in. I was like, ‘Man, 
he meant to do that.’ Because at 
the end of the day, he’s scored 
some really nice goals for us and 
that was one of them.”
Despite having a halftime 
lead, the Wolverines were weary 
of the complacency that led to 
their defensive collapse in their 
previous game.
“(Coach Daley) just said, ‘Don’t 
let go. Keep going out there and 
pretend like it’s nil-nil. Keep 
going at them, you never know 
what can happen,’ ” Hallahan 
said.
As expected, Marquette came 
into the second half aggressive 
on offense, desperate to push the 
pace and create scoring chances. 

Michigan’s defense weathered 
the storm, however, halting any 
opportunities the Golden Eagles 
had.
The 
Wolverines 
regained 
control 
of 
possession 
after 
the early offensive blitz from 
Marquette who, by the 80th 
minute, appeared demoralized by 
the 3-0 deficit.
“I think it was a point of riding 
the storm at first,” Hallahan said. 
“Making sure we didn’t concede, 
keep a clean sheet and then 
eventually get control of the ball 
again. The more possession we 
had, the less they could do with 
the ball and the less fret against 
us.”
At the final whistle, Michigan 
reconciled 
the 
second-half 
struggles that plagued the team 
in its previous match by playing 
dominant on defense for a full 
90 minutes to extend their win 
streak to four games heading into 
Big Ten play.

Balance propels ‘M’

Individual talent alone cannot 
win team sports — just ask 
LeBron James. It takes teamwork, 
dedication and balance. Monday 
night, the Michigan men’s soccer 
team (4-1) demonstrated it has all 
three in spades with a 3-0 shutout of 
Marquette (2-3).
On 
attack, 
the 
Wolverines 
showed just how balanced their 
squad is as three different players 
found the back of the net. The 
offense employed early aggression 
and worked diligently to create 
opportunities for all its players.
Kicking things off for Michigan 
was sophomore defenseman Austin 
Swiech.
In just the thirteenth minute of 
the game, the Wolverines’ offensive 
pressure paid off. After a cross from 
sophomore forward Umar Farouk 
Osman was headed outside of the 
box, Swiech picked up the rebound 
in stride and sent a rocket screaming 
towards the net. The ball tipped off 
a Golden Eagle defender and snuck 
inside the left post, and just like that, 
Swiech had his first career goal.
On the other side of the field, 
Swiech consistently made key 
defensive stops, serving as the 
anchor of the defensive line.
Swiech’s quality of play speaks 
volumes to the depth and team 
chemistry of this Michigan squad. 
Swiech wasn’t originally intended 
to start for the Wolverines this 
year, but instead was thrust into a 
starting role in light of an injury to 
senior defenseman Peter Brown. 
Since assuming the position, Swiech 
has exceeded expectations, much to 
the delight of his teammates and 
coaches.
“Swiech’s been brilliant,” said 
junior forward Jack Hallahan. “I 
think he didn’t get many minutes 
last year. I think he made a few 
appearances, but it’s brilliant to see 
him step up. He got his first goal, 
really happy for him tonight, and I 
think he deserves it. About time he 
got one.”
Added Michigan coach Chaka 
Daley: “Austin’s played himself 

into a position where he’s been 
consistent, passes the ball well, 
scored a goal tonight, which helps. 
He’s got good service, has defended 
well one v. one and he’s learning on 
the job. He’s being deputized as the 
games go on, but it’s a tough one as 
he replaces someone who is injured, 
but he’s given himself a fair shot to 
be included.”
Beyond the efforts of Swiech, the 
Wolverines have found meaningful 
contributions up and down their 
roster against nearly all competition 
so far this season. With his team 
scoring multiple goals in all of its 
wins, Daley finds unselfish play and 
offensive prowess coming easily to 
his players. But more importantly, 
his players have bought into the 
idea.
“Unselfish, unselfish, unselfish, 
and our guys have bought into it,” 
Daley said. “They don’t have to be. 
You gotta remember that. They 
can be a different way, but they’ve 
been very unselfish, and I think the 
proof’s in the pudding. They’ve all 
created chances for themselves and 
for others, and the goals have flowed 
because of that.”
That kind of altruism and group 
cohesion does not come easily or 
quickly. It takes time and effort as 
teams build a rapport and fall into 
a rhythm. By playing together last 
year and finding early success this 
season, Michigan is right where it 
wants to be.
To gauge this cohesion, Daley 
checks the tape. But not the footage 
of seamless passing or highlight reel 
assists — Daley watches his players’ 
celebrations.
“I go back, it’s kinda a weird 
thing, I go back and I look at the 
celebrations a little bit to see who’s 
with who and how we’re acting and 
reacting,” Daley said. “Very team-
centric, making sure we’re about 
the team, the team, the team. And 
I’m looking at all the celebrations 
online or on video where I watch 
it and making sure guys are very 
intermingled.”
Nothing brings people together 
like winning, and right now, due 
to their cohesion and balance, the 
Wolverines are doing a lot of it.

Notebook: Bushell-Beatty fights against criticisms, Thomas on offense

Fifth-year 
senior 
tackle 
Juwann Bushell-Beatty doesn’t 
seek it out, but it’s impossible 
to ignore. He scrolls through 
social media and sees and 
hears the harsh criticism his 
unit faces. It reached a fever 
pitch after the 24-17 loss to 
Notre Dame on 
Sep. 1, and has 
since 
quieted 
a tad, after the 
Wolverines 
rushed 
for 
over 300 yards 
against Western 
Michigan 
this 
past weekend.
Bushell-
Beatty 
says 
that’s 
how 
it 
goes — lose one 
week and fans want your head, 
win the next and the uproar 
fades. He thinks it stems 
from the public’s inability to 
understand the fundamentals 
of offensive line play. He, 
like 
Michigan 
coach 
Jim 
Harbaugh, thinks the criticism 
of the offensive line has been 
misguided.
“The public doesn’t really 
understand the inner-workings 
of how things go on in here,” 
Bushell-Beatty said Tuesday 
afternoon. “I think there were 
mistakes, and when there’s 
mistakes — and there’s always, 
everyone 
wants 
to 
point 
fingers and there are things 
that happened. It’s football. I 
understand, regardless of what 
happens, O-Line is going to 
take blame for whatever. I’ve 
accepted that. Whether it’s 
true or not, is not up to me.
“Some of it is (unwarranted), 
but that’s life. People are going 
to criticize you for everything 
you do. The sooner you learn to 
accept that the better.”
He 
added 
that 
it’s 
a 
galvanizing force for a group 
that isn’t willing to apologize 
for weaknesses it feels doesn’t 
exist. 
Redshirt 
sophomore 
center 
Stephen 
Spinellis 
affirmed 
this 
sentiment 
Monday afternoon.
When Bushell-Beatty talks, 

he sounds like a calloused 
veteran who’s been on the 
receiving end of insults his 
entire 
career. 
He 
speaks 
candidly, but maturely, about 
how he feels, not in a combative 
way, but in a stern assertion of 
how he feels.
He hasn’t always been able to 
handle criticism as assuredly.
“It’s not something that’s 
easy 
to 
have 
people pointing 
fingers at you,” 
he 
said. 
“It’s 
something that 
takes 
time. 
I 
understand 
my role on this 
team and as a 
football player, 
there are things 
that 
happen, 
things are going 
to 
go 
wrong, 
people are going to say, ‘You 
suck.’ But, I mean, at the end 
of the day, they can’t do what 
they do, that’s why they watch 
us on TV.”
Ambry 
Thomas 
getting 
chance on offense
Whether in seven-year-old 
Pee Wee football or on the road 
at Notre Dame, the recipe for 
sophomore Ambry Thomas has 
long been the same: Just run.
“I was literally seven years 
old,” Thomas said. “Every time 
I touched it, I just ran and 
scored. They just tell me ‘Run!’ 
That’s all I did. I just ran. Like 
Forest Gump, run.”
When you have the speed 
Thomas does, that works out 
more often than it doesn’t. 
When Thomas watches film, 
his speed even stands out to 
him.
“I didn’t know I was that 
fast,” Thomas said. “I knew I 
was fast, but that fast, no.”
The Monday after the loss to 
Notre Dame, Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh informed the 
team Thomas wouldn’t just be 
using his speed at cornerback 
and on special teams; he’d 
work in with the offense as 
well. It’s a chance Thomas had 
awaited with baited breath.
He got one carry on Saturday 
against 
Western 
Michigan, 
gaining 
five 
yards. 
He 

estimates he’s been working 
on offense for a play or two 
in each practice — hardly a 
challenging endeavor for the 
sophomore.
But an enticing opportunity 
for him and for an offense in 
dire need of explosive plays, 
nonetheless.
Last 
season, 
Michigan 
ranked 
58th 
in 
IsoPPP, 
a 
statistic 
that 
meaures 
explosive 
offensive 
plays. 
Thomas is a walking explosive 
play. He was in Pee Wee. He 
was in high school. He can be 
in college, too.
“High school, it was like 
the same thing. That’s when I 
really got at corner,” Thomas 
said. “They saw what I could 
do at corner, they liked my 
speed there. They said ‘Aw, 
yeah, this guy could possible 
be a two-way player at the next 
level.’
“I just like knowing that 

you have the opportunity to 
change the game, if you get the 
ball in your hands. That’s real 
exciting to me.”
McCurry’s first touchdown
Redshirt 
freshman 
wide 
receiver 
Jake 
McCurry didn’t 
keep the ball. 
It didn’t occur 
to him that his 
first touchdown 
in the Big House 
— and the first 
catch 
of 
his 
career — might 
carry 
some 
sentimentality 
down the road.
“That didn’t go through my 
head at all,” McCurry said 
Tuesday afternoon.
With just under nine minutes 
left in Saturday’s blowout over 
Western Michigan, McCurry 
lined up in the slot to redshirt 
freshman quarterback Dylan 

McCaffery’s right. McCaffery 
took the snap, faked a handoff 
and rolled to McCurry’s side.
“I’m not really sure what 
I am in the progression. I 
was one of the main routes,” 
McCurry said. “I 
just 
remember 
looking at the 
leverage 
the 
DB 
had 
— 
it 
was 
a 
quick 
play. We got up 
right there and 
ran it. It was a 
quick play, and I 
remember I had 
to get outside 
and try to stack 
him a little bit. That’s really all 
I thought when I was running 
the route.”
McCaffery 
delivered 
the 
strike to McCurry on the 
sideline, who then juked a 
lunging defender and dove into 
the endzone. 

It was McCaffery’s first 
passing 
touchdown 
of 
his 
career, to boot.
“Initially, I just wanted to 
see Dylan, because I’m pretty 
close with Dylan — it was a 
special moment that he threw 
me the ball. I was just excited, 
that’s the only way to describe 
it.”
McCurry heard from all 
walks of life — his phone 
blowing up with tweets, texts, 
all forms of congratulatory 
messages. 
“It was definitely a special 
moment,” McCurry said. “It 
was specifically special with 
Dylan and other guys that were 
on the field that are my best 
friends, like Joel Hornigford, 
Oliver Martin, I think Andrew 
Steuber might have been out 
there, Tru (Wilson). Those are 
the guys I’ve really hung out 
with a lot, and are really close 
to.”

Michigan lands three 
recruits in two days

In the matter of just two days, 
the Michigan football team added 
two more commitments to next 
year’s already-solid recruiting class, 
as well as a commitment for the 
2020 class.
It started Sunday, when 4-star 
defensive 
end 
Mike 
Morris, 
who was previously committed 
to Florida State, announced via 
Twitter that he had flipped his 
commitment to the Wolverines.
“… I feel like GOD is guiding me 
in a different direction,” Morris said 
in his tweet. “So I would like to say 
that I’m decommitting from Florida 
State University and recommitting 
to the University of Michigan.”
Morris 
is 
the 
22nd-ranked 
strongside defensive end in the 
2019 class, and he adds depth to the 
class at that position, which already 
includes David Ojabo and Chris 
Hinton, the 19th- and 2nd-best 
strongside defensive ends in the 
class, respectively.
In addition to Morris, Michigan 
landed the commitment of 3-star, 
2020 tight end Nick Patterson, the 
brother of junior quarterback Shea 
Patterson.
Nick was visiting this weekend 
for the Wolverines’ game against 
Western Michigan, and according 

to Sam Webb of 247sports, he had 
a meeting Sunday afternoon with 
coach Jim Harbaugh in which Nick 
made his intentions known.
The next day, the reports were 
confirmed, as Nick also took to 
Twitter to make his commitment 
public.
“Thank you (Michigan football), 
(Shea Patterson) and (Harbaugh) 
for an amazing weekend in the 
Big House. I’m thrilled to make it 
official that I’ll be joining the Big 
Blue!!” Nick said.
The strong recruiting weekend 
was polished off on Monday by yet 
another 4-star commitment, as 
Giles Jackson, the No. 5 all-purpose 
back in the 2019 class, announced 
he would be coming to Ann Arbor 
as well.
Jackson joins Eric Gray, the 
No. 3 all-purpose back in the class, 
and Zach Charbonnet, the No. 9 
running back in the class, who 
committed to Michigan earlier this 
summer.
The Wolverines’ 2019 class 
was already strong, and with the 
additions of Morris and Jackson, 
it ranks 10th nationally and first in 
the Big Ten.
With that and Michigan’s win 
over the Broncos, it’s safe to say it 
was a good weekend for Harbaugh 
and company.

Peoples-Jones seeks consistency after touchdown

Donovan 
Peoples-Jones 
finally thought he had it.
Spotted 
at 
the 
Western 
Michigan 14-yard line with 
9:59 remaining in the second 
quarter, the sophomore wide 
receiver caught a pass from 
junior 
 
quarterback 
Shea 
Patterson on an underneath 
crossing route, rounded the 
corner and lunged towards the 
pylon.
“I feel like I was in the 
endzone,” Peoples-Jones said, 
“but they called it and said I 
stepped out on the three or the 
four. I didn’t even feel myself 
step out.”
The 
elusive 
receiving 
touchdown 
had 
escaped 
Peoples-Jones 
through 
the 
first 14 games of his career. It’s 
escaped the entire receiving 
corps for the past 12 contests. 
So it’s easy to understand 
Peoples-Jones’ frustration on 
the play — hitting paydirt has 
been hard to come by.
Just over three minutes later 
in the quarter, sophomore wide 
receiver Nico Collins hauled 
in a 44-yard score to snap the 
drought, lifting the weight off 
the wide receivers’ shoulders. 
But Peoples-Jones — the No. 2 
receiver in the 2017 recruiting 
class, according to 247Sports.
com — had yet to find any luck.
At the 6:21 mark of the 
third quarter, though, that 
would change. Positioned at 
the Broncos’ five-yard line 
and Collins blanketed on the 
short slant, Patterson read his 
progressions and lofted the ball 
to Peoples-Jones at the back 
of the endzone just over the 
defensive back’s outstretched 
arm.
“That throw to Donovan 
was really good,” said coach 
Jim Harbaugh. “That wasn’t 
his first read. That was a long 
throw, from one sideline to the 
back corner endzone. And that 
one required some touch on it. 
But it had to get up and down 

quick before Donovan got out 
of bounds.
“That’s 
pretty 
high-level 
stuff.”
It was six points, but it also 
ushered in a new chapter for 
Peoples-Jones’s playing career, 
one that opens speculation for 
what he could 
become in his 
sophomore 
campaign — a 
capable 
route-
runner 
that 
can 
create 
separation 
and 
high-point balls 
thrown his way.
“He’s 
way 
more 
physical 
now,” 
said 
sophomore 
defensive 
back 
Ambry Thomas. “And he knows 
that he’s not scared to use his 
strength and his speed.”
In the season opener against 
Notre Dame, his ceiling looked 

limited. Wide receivers’ coach 
Jim McElwain even thought 
his No. 1 receiver played too 
many 
snaps. 
Peoples-Jones 
gathered six receptions for 
just 38 yards, a byproduct of 
capping his routes to primarily 
comebacks and screens.
Peoples-
Jones’ 
2017 
yardage 
came 
off 
similar 
plays, 
but 
he 
occasionally 
showed 
separation 
on 
deeper 
routes 
with 
few 
results to show. 
Saturday’s 
touchdown 
against 
Western 
Michigan 
could be just as much of an 
anomaly as it could be a routine, 
but high-level performaces are 
exactly what the Wolverines 
had expected Peoples-Jones to 

do consistently.
“Donovan ran a heck of 
a route to stem that inside 
and get to the back pylon,” 
Patterson said after the game. 
“… It’s kind of a routine throw.”
If it’s routine for Patterson 
and Peoples-Jones is the go-to 
guy, it could be a connection 
that 
happens 
more 
often 
on Saturdays. But the soft-
spoken Peoples-Jones wouldn’t 
divulge what he thought his 
potential was or what kind of 
player he expects to be. He just 
knows he’s on track to answer 
the pressure that comes with 
the ballyhoo.
“More 
confidence, 
more 
focused, 
more 
experienced, 
more comfortable,” he said of 
his play.
As the No. 1 receiver with the 
toughest obstacles yet to come 
this season, it’s everything 
Michigan can hope for as it 
refines its offense.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | SEPTEMBER 12, 2018

When the city 
decides to take 

your home


I

t was just last year that I was 
hurrying 
through 
the 
Diag, 

late for class, when I noticed 

hundreds of American flags staked on 
the lawns. It took me a few minutes 
to remember the day. Sept. 11 — a day 
whose significance bears the same 
weight on the American consciousness 
today as it did in 2001. But with a 
symbol that means vastly different 
things to different people, how could 
an event like Sept. 11 be reduced to the 
flying of a few flags on a university 

campus?

I was born in Santiago de Chile. 

My parents have their own disparate 
experiences of Sept.11. For them, this 
day is ingrained in a collective and 
historical consciousness.

Sept. 11, 1973 was the date of the 

military coup that redefined Chilean 
politics and society. This was the 
beginning of two decades where the 
CIA-backed military took over the 
country under the mantra of national 
reconstruction. 
The 
following 

years would be characterized by 
systematic political repression and the 
persecution and murder of dissidents.

Every year, the eleventh is a day of 

national protests where Chileans of 
all generations march in the streets 
holding posters demanding answers 
for the atrocities that occurred under 
the dictatorship that followed and 
demanding change for its persistent 
political implications. However, not 
everyone in Chile sees this day as a day 
of pain and anger. Some celebrate Sept. 

11 as the day Chile was saved 
from the supposed clutches of 
communism. General Augusto 
Pinochet’s dictatorship, for some, 
represents a neoliberal salvation 
that propelled Chile into the 
modern era. On Chilean soil, 
Sept. 11 represents a symbolic 
moment where the fracture of its 
society is reenacted.

I left Chile before my first 

birthday only to return in 2011. 
I remember going to El Museo 
de la Memoria y Los Derechos 
Humanos, or the Museum of 
Memory 
and 
Human 
Rights 

— a museum that documents 
the 
brutality 
of 
Pinochet’s 

dictatorship. 
I 
remember 

being 13 and walking down the 
dimly lit hallways listening to 
testimonies of those who had 
survived. I can still hear the 
voice of a woman who talked 
about being stripped naked and 
tied to a metal bed frame as she 
was electrocuted by the regime. 
I looked away because I couldn’t 
bring myself to look at her face, 
but when I looked back, I saw 
my mother silently crying in the 
corner of the room. The silence 
was suffocating.

I wonder if here in the United 

States this date has come to mark 
historical ignorance. We talk 
briefly about Sept. 11 in school. 
We talk about the tragic loss of 
life. We talk about the heroes 
of New York City who worked 

endlessly to find those trapped in the 
rubble of the twin towers. But while 
Americans of all political stripes 
commemorate the victims and heroes 
of 9/11, do we ever really talk about 
its aftermath or the subsequent wars? 
Unlike in Chile, these consequences 
are almost never up for debate. In 
effect, does this silence cheapen those 
deaths with a patriotic rhetoric about 
keeping America safe?

There was a time — and perhaps we 

are still in the time — when questioning 
those in charge is not the natural order 
of a democracy, but rather a blatant 
attack on America. To question is to be 
anti-patriotic. The fear and sorrow of 
2001 has become a fiber of apathy in a 
cloth of patriotism. It is a resignation 
to let politics run its course.

My own history is marked by the 

aftermath of two distinct historical 
events. Sept. 11 has become a historic 
reflux that won’t go away with a 
prescribed dose of patriotism, fear, 
or apathy. It comes back as an itch 
that demands to be scratched. In 
Chile, it erupts time and time again 
as anger towards a dictatorship whose 
constitution is still the law. On one 
side you have mothers holding posters 
of their children whose bodies are 
likely lost in the desert. On the other 
side, 
you 
have 
recently-appointed 

government ministers questioning the 
validity of El Museo de la Memoria as a 
leftist dramatization of history. This is 
a tear in the fabric of Chilean history, 
a tear that will never fully repair itself.

A world away, in the U.S., resignation 

to fear blanketed by a rhetoric of 
patriotism has become an excuse for 
hate. Did the pain of 9/11 help foster a 
narrative that we use today to divide 
the citizens of our country? What will 
come of the memory of Sept. 11? To 
have an identity defined by two critical 
moments that share the same date is to 
have a day on which you are reminded 
on both fronts that history doesn’t just 
disappear like the bodies in the sand or 
under rubble but that it lingers like a 
scar.

Translating the Donald to Japanese

P

eople always complain about 
Donald Trump.

I say, try to explain him to a 

foreign audience.

This summer I had the privilege 

of working at the New York bureau 
of TV Tokyo, one of Japan’s major 
television stations. I was put on a 
morning news program that focuses 
on business and finance, so of course, 
there was a lot of reading the Wall 
Street Journal as well as dusty econ 
textbooks in the back of the office. 
But the most memorable part of the 
whole experience was the arduous 
task of reporting on none other than 
the president himself.

The words of the president of the 

United States has a massive impact 
both at home and abroad. Love him 
or hate him, everyone is compelled 
to hear what Trump is saying on 
Twitter, and the people of Japan are 
no different.

But here’s where it gets complicated: 

Sometimes, nobody — not even his 
own staff — can comprehend what 
he’s saying. If native English speakers 
can’t understand him, that means 
it’s a massive headache for foreign 
broadcasters.

The difficulty translators have 

when putting Trump’s speeches and 
tweets in their own language has 
been well documented. Trump is a 
free-wheeling speaker on stage and 
a “covfefe” online, which confuses 
people used to presidents sticking 
to a script. Media outlets across the 
globe have also been known to go to 
great lengths to offer roundabout 
expressions 
of 
Trump’s 
most 

offending statements.

I’ve 
always 
heard 
about 
the 

difficulty of translating the Donald, 
but never did I anticipate how much 
of a pain in the butt it would be until 
I actually had to do it.

Take this news from July 31. 

A radical gun rights activist was 
preparing to release files online 
with instructions on how to build 
3D model guns while the attorneys 
general of eight states were suing to 
block him. It sounded complicated 
enough, especially when we had to 
condense it to a 30-second segment, 
but then Trump decided to wade into 
the debate.

“I am looking into 3-D Plastic Guns 

being sold to the public,” Trump 
tweeted. “Already spoke to NRA, 
doesn’t seem to make much sense!”

The main obstacle to translating 

this tweet is glaringly 
obvious. We are unsure 
whether “doesn’t seem to 
make much sense!” refers 
to 3D guns in general 
(the first sentence) or 
his 
conversation 
with 

the 
National 
Rifle 

Association (the second 
sentence).

In America, we would 

have 
the 
luxury 
of 

watching commentators 
on CNN battle out what 
exactly 
Trump 
means 

by this tweet. But the 
Japanese have their own 
problems to worry about 
— a tweet about 3D guns 
would most likely not 
make it onto the evening 
political 
roundtable 

program.

Thus, the burden falls on 

Japan’s newspapers and TV stations 
(that’s me!) to accurately convey what 
the president of the United States is 
thinking.

What’s important here is context. 

Unfortunately, 
the 
White 
House 

never commented on this tweet to 
clarify what Trump was thinking, 
so I had to think back to the past 
few news cycles to determine where 
Trump would stand on 3D-printed 
guns.

I knew right after the shooting at 

Marjory Stoneman Douglas High 
School, Trump said “we have to fight 
(the NRA) every once in a while” in 
enacting sensible gun control laws. 
However, he backtracked in May 
and vowed not to support any more 
firearm regulations.

Trump supporting liberal causes 

and then flipping to the conservative 
position to please his supporters 
has been a common occurrence, but 
sometimes he genuinely seems to 
change his mind — which leaves us at 
a loss as to what his true feelings are.

In the end, my editor and I 

determined 
that 
Trump 
would 

probably not attack the NRA at 
that moment, and the flow of the 
sentence seemed to indicate Trump 
was befuddled by 3D guns generally. 
Thus, we decided the expression “he 
expressed skepticism of 3D guns” 
while not expressing approval or 
lack thereof best represented the 
situation.

Another 
difficulty 
translators 

face in interpreting Trump is his 

vocabulary 
and 
language 
skills. 

Trump’s grammar and diction in 
speeches is known to be just below a 
sixth-grade level, and we Americans 
treat them as such.

However, in Japan — perhaps out of 

respect for decorum — the media does 
not directly translate Trump’s words 
into the vocabulary-level of a sixth 
grader and instead elevates it to that 
appropriate of an elder statesman.

Spoken 
Japanese, 
especially 
in 

fiction, has a variety of cues that 
reveal the gender, age, social class 
and regional origin. So as a 72-year 
old head of state, Trump has to be 
accorded proper language to not 
shock viewers with the speech of a 
12-year old boy.

Take this July 19 interview when, 

in an unusual move for presidents, 
Trump said he was “not thrilled” 
about the Federal Reserve Board 
raising interest rates.

“I’m not thrilled because we go up,” 

Trump said. “And every time you go 
up, they want to raise rates again. I 
don’t really — I am not happy about 
it.”

This one was tricky for two reasons.
The first was “every time you go 

up.” In his usual fashion, Trump left 
what was going up ambiguous. Based 
on context clues, my editor and I 
determined the what was the state 
of the economy, so we translated the 
statement as “every time the economy 
recovers .”

The second was “I’m not thrilled.” 

That 
is 
a 
colloquial 
expression 

in English with no equivalent in 

Japanese. And since Trump’s words 
were likely going to move the market 
(which it actually did), we had to 
be 
meticulous 
in 
conveying 
the 

right mood so audiences (especially 
investors) won’t get too alarmed.

In the end, we settled on “I’m not 

impressed,” which admittedly felt 
a little mature and well thought out 
than the original English. But since 
the other options, including the 
onomatopoeia “waku waku,” which 
indicates 
excitement, 
made 
him 

sound immature or did not accurately 
convey his mood, we had to settle on 
a substitute.

Other similar Trumpisms roiled 

my corner of the newsroom once in a 
while, but with tenacity and grit, we 
managed to get it right every time.

It is ironic that I started to keenly 

realize the importance of words in 
politics only after encountering them 
in a foreign language. Back in 1946, 
George Orwell wrote in “Politics and 
the English Language” that political 
speech “is designed to make lies sound 
truthful and murder respectable, and 
to give an appearance of solidity to 
pure wind.”

The same could be said of today’s 

political 
language. 
In 
today’s 

globalized economy, the words of one 
politician can reverberate around the 
world in a matter of seconds. This is 
why we should always demand those 
in higher positions to clarify their 
words, lest we get mired in untruths 
and convenient euphemisms.

Oh, and to alleviate the workload of 

translators too!

In a foreclosure crisis, Detroit residents 

fight to remain in their homes

by Andrea Pérez, Statement Correspondent

I

n late August, Michael Andrews 
learned his Southwest Detroit 
home was in foreclosure. It came 
into his family’s possession in 

1963, but falling on hard times during the 
2007 recession made it difficult to keep 
up with his property taxes. The city’s 
systematically flawed practices have fur-
ther created and perpetuated an oppres-
sive system nearly impossible for at-risk 
residents to escape.

A yellow bag appeared on Andrews’ 

door twice in the past year. He recog-
nized that as an obvious sign of fore-
closure, but the following notifications 
of the status of the home were ambigu-
ous and easy to ignore. His story isn’t 
uncommon. Yellow paper bags appear on 
residents’ front doors and mail is sent to 
their address, but many don’t compre-
hend the severity of their situation due to 
the legal jargon and confusing format of 
the notifications.

It wasn’t until a United Community 

Housing Coalition volunteer came to his 
house that he realized how dire his situ-
ation was.

“I’m looking at (the notices) and it was 

the first time I sat down to read them,” 
Andrews said. “I started to read them 

and I was like I seen October you know 
and that’s how they do it in bold, so it 
makes you think you have until Octo-
ber. I’m looking at the papers then I read 
down below in the writing and I’m like 
‘Oh wow.’ You’re right. I got to get down 
here and do something.”

However, having lived in Detroit for 

40 years, Andrews is committed to sav-
ing his family home.He sits in counseling 
appointments with UCHC to see if there 
is any possibility that he might keep his 
home. When confronted with the idea 
that he might be evicted, Andrews was 
shock.

“I don’t know, I really don’t know,” 

Andrews says. “As long as I’ve been there, 
I have no idea what I would do. I pretty 
much lost all my family. I’m just lost for 
words because I’ve never been in this 
situation.”
I

n the past few years, leaders of 
the City of Detroit have made 
countless 
headlines 
proclaim-

ing the city’s so-called comeback. They 
point to the end of state oversight of the 
city’s finances, the new Little Caesars 
Arena, Ford’s Motor Co.’s purchase of the 
Michigan Central Station and new con-
struction of homes and office buildings 

around downtown and midtown as evi-
dence of the city’s resurgence. However, 
the revitalization of these areas contrasts 
with the reality of other city neighbor-
hoods. Far from downtown, trash builds 
on corners, windows are boarded up, 
streets remain dark through the hours of 
the night and residents are being pushed 
out from their homes by a tax foreclosure 
process that over assesses the tax burden 
for some of the city’s most vulnerable 
residents.

According to Motor City Mapping, 

111,167 Detroit properties went up for 
foreclosure between 2002 and 2014. 
With Detroiters paying one of the high-
est property tax rates in Michigan and 
the second highest in the nation as of 
2016, it comes to no surprise that already 
steep taxes, coupled with an archaic tax 
assessment process and persistent pov-
erty lead to Detroit’s immense volume of 
tax foreclosures.

Filling a gap unserved by the city, com-

munity organizations, like the United 
Community Housing Coalition, have 
established programs to help thousands 
of Detroiters at risk of losing their homes 
to navigate the foreclosure process. Resi-
dents like Andrews use their services to 

stay informed about the 
status of their homes, 
keep 
up 
with 
their 

payment plans and in 
extreme cases, explore 
last resort options.
T

he sound of 
footsteps 
and shuffling 

papers can be heard 
from the elevator on 
the third floor of 2727 
Second Ave. in Mid-
town, 
where 
UCHC 

is housed. There is a 
glass door at the end 
of the hallway that dis-
plays their logo, and 
behind it, the hallway 
is filled with people 
waiting their turn for 
a word with the front 
desk. UCHC counseling 
hours for tax foreclo-
sure prevention started 
a few minutes prior, 
and everyone waiting 

is here because their homes are at risk 
of being taken away through formalities 
of a system encompassed by racism and 
bigotry.

The smell of a pot of coffee brewing 

and the scent of dusty filing cabinets lin-
gers in the air. The walls are clad with 
inspirational quotes, pictures and art 
from Black historical figures, but that is 

the last thing anyone was paying atten-
tion to. People sit, face between their 
knees, some cradling their children, 
with folders of paperwork in their hands. 
Every chair in the waiting room is taken, 
so people spill into the hall and take up 
some of the chairs against both sides of 
the wall. All the while UCHC staff runs 
in and out of the waiting room and main 
hallway, bringing people into individual 
counseling rooms.

Bustling mornings like this are com-

mon at UCHC. The organization has been 
committed to providing housing assis-
tance to low-income Detroiters since 

1973, and this year is no exception. Oper-
ating at near capacity, UCHC will save 
515 homes this year, including Andrews’, 
from being sold in the auction through 
their Right of Refusal Program.

The program permits at-risk Detroit 

residents, previous owners or renters 
alike, to stay in their homes. To do this, 
they evoke the Right of First Refusal in 
which the Wayne State Treasurer’s office 
is required to offer the homes to the right 
holder, which in this case would be the 
person occupying the home before it can 
open up a deal to other potential buyers.

Through buying the homes from the 

Wayne County Treasurer’s office before 
the bidding starts, UCHC is able to 
acquire them for an affordable price and 
offer their clients a fair payment plan. 
This way, the person who occupied the 
home before it was foreclosed is able to 
remain in the property, and even better 
yet, their tax bill starts anew.
A

s many as 25 percent of Detroit 
properties went into tax fore-
closure between 2011 and 2015. 

This crisis has affected the composition 
of neighborhoods, displaced families and 
changed the overarching atmosphere in 
the city as many houses lay unoccupied 
and blighted. The underlying drivers 
for these foreclosures are disputed, but 
prominent narratives don’t acknowledge 
the role of the city and treasurer’s office 
in enforcing laws that have long dispro-
portionately affected at-risk communi-
ties.

However, Bernadette Atuahene, a pro-

fessor at the Chicago-Kent College of 
Law, argues the city of Detroit is over-
assessing the value of these properties 
and foreclosing on them in an unconstitu-
tional manner.

According to the Michigan Constitu-

tion, properties need to be assessed annu-
ally and at no more than 50 percent of 
their market value. Atuahene found that 
Detroiters homes were assessed between 
53 and 84 percent of their value between 
2009 and 2015.

She suggests three reasons the city vio-

lated protocol. First, the assessor’s office 
could be too short-handed to actually 
assess the value of most properties in the 
city, and assumed property values were 
growing at an unrealistically high rate. 
Alternatively, many Detroit residents are 
unaware of the relevant regulations and 
therefore fail to hold the city government 
accountable. Finally, she raises the pos-
sibility the city found it easier to raise 
revenues by illegally assuming its taxable 
properties were more valuable than they 
actually were, rather than withstanding 
the political burden of raising tax rates.

“Given the (Detroit) property tax rate 

is already one of the highest in the nation, 
it may be challenging to get voters to 
approve a hike,” Atuhene’s article reads. 
“In contrast, Wayne County reimburses 
Detroit for any property tax revenue that 
it fails to collect; in exchange, the county 
receives the right to collect the revenues 

(with 
penalties 
and 

interests) and to con-
fiscate the home if pay-
ment is not forthcoming 
after three years of 
delinquency.”
S

imilar to any 
other property 
owner in Mich-

igan, Detroiters get two 
property tax bills in 
the year. One usually 
comes in the summer 
and the other in winter. 
The current year’s tax 
bills come in the from 
the city of Detroit, but 
delinquent taxes or back 
taxes that have accu-
mulated from previous 
years are billed by the 
Wayne County Treasur-
er’s office. When resi-
dents get a bill from the 
treasurer, it means that 
they are behind on their 
taxes and the 18 percent 
interest rate is already 
accruing.

When delinquent or back taxes accu-

mulate for three years, a yellow bag is 
dropped by the front door of the property 
by the treasurer, signaling that it is in the 
list of potential foreclosures. The county 
offers a few options for residents to pay 
back their delinquent taxes before their 
home goes into auction, and some of the 
most widely used are payment plans.

Payment plans like the Interest Reduc-

tion Stipulated Payment Agreement and 
the Stipulated Payment Agreement allow 
residents to pay back their delinquent 
taxes in split payments with the interest 
reduced to 6 percent. However, if resi-
dents fail to register for a payment plan 
or if they fall back on taxes again, their 
homes end up on auction.

As a last resort to collect the taxes owed 

to them by the properties, the Wayne 
State Treasurer’s office holds an annual 
auction for the purchase of foreclosed 
properties. This year, around 1,500 occu-
pied homes are up for foreclosure auction 
— including Andrews’s — yet this number 
is much lower than the 2015 peak when 
9,111 occupied homes went up for sale. 
Many of these homeowners or renters 
experience financial and emotional diffi-
culties that inhibit them from keeping up 
with their property taxes.

“Right now, I have been unemployed,” 

Andrews said. “With my background, 
stuff has been kind of hard to find 
employment so I do whatever I can on the 
side. Sparse side jobs. It’s tough just to 
make ends meet.”

Living below the poverty line and try-

ing to stay current on all bills on top of 
already high property taxes can take a toll 
on residents like Andrews, who makes 
less than $1,000 a month and would have 
to buy back his home for a minimum of 
$500.

“It’s stressful when, you know, you 

have a debt and they send it and let you 
know you’re always on it,” Andrews said. 
“After I get this situated I’m going to go 
file for bankruptcy for my first time. I’ve 
never done it before, but I’m going to go 
get that cleaned up and then I guess they 
will start over my credits.”

Another lifelong Detroiter, Wesley 

Mosley, is in a similar situation. She sits 
in the counseling room at UCHC, vis-
ibly pregnant and glowing with joy at the 
thought of finally having a girl after rais-
ing three boys. She tells the story of how 
she recently married her husband just 
released from prison, but the joy escapes 
her eyes when the topic reverts to her 
house. It is listed for the upcoming auc-
tion, as she has also found it hard to stay 
current with her taxes due to unemploy-
ment.

“I got a yellow bag on the door, and that 

was in 2016,” she says. “The house was 
still under my sister’s name, but she quit 
claim deed it to me because I had been 
there since 2011.”

The state of her neighborhood, like 

Andrews’s, has fluctuated throughout the 
years. Her elderly neighbors have man-
aged to stay, but most other houses either 
change owners often, are always on the 
verge of going vacant or lay blighted.

Despite these circumstances, she is 

also committed to saving her home. It is 
the first home she has owned and where 
she is raising her children. She has been 
living in it for many years and is still con-
stantly trying to turn her “house” into a 
“home.”

“Now I have just recently seen that over 

the summer people are coming to look at 
the homes that has been abandoned or 
what not,” she said. “I don’t want my home 
to be one of the homes that they look at, so 

I try to stay on top of everything. It’s just 
been hard being a single mother.”

Her home’s situation is why she is here, 

but the outcome is still uncertain.

“I wouldn’t have no choice but to work 

hard and try to get into another home, but 
it’s going to be hard,” she said. “I know 
I probably won’t get into no home until 
about March of next year or something 
like that when I have enough money saved 
up to have a down payment. I don’t want 
to have to go to no shelter with no new-
born baby and three kids.”

Andrews and Mosley are two of many 

Detroiters who utilize the services UCHC 
has to offer. They will likely get to stay in 
their homes, but unfortunately, going to 
a homeless shelter is a reality for others. 
Out of 1,500 occupied homes that were 
listed for the auction, UCHC was only 
able to buy back 515. Those residents did 
not have access to UCHC Andrews and 
Mosley were will likely be pushed out of 
their homes soon.

Even then, Andrews’s and Mosley’s 

fights aren’t over. Every six months, 
when their tax bills come and if they are 
still unable to pay them despite being 
informed and willing, they will be on the 
foreclosure track again. After a year, they 
might get another yellow bag on their 
doorstep, and three years after that they 
might find themselves at UCHC again, 
wondering what they can do to stay in 
their homes.

This cycle will continue to be a reality 

until the city and county make concrete 
efforts to reform how they assess proper-
ties values for taxes, and make genuine 
strides to inform the public about the 
status of their homes and options for pay-
ment. This cycle not stop until the gov-
ernment ceases profiting off the misery 
of its constituents.

Re: Union

I

n late April, I walked up the stairs 
to the Michigan Union, as I’d 
done many times before. It was a 

warm day — warmer still with the winter 
semester finally over and the summer 
near. I’d walked up those stairs in every 
possible state: wet, hot, cold, disheveled, 
elated, 
disappointed, 
happy, 
tired, 

content, angry, heartbroken. Most of the 
time, though, I was just hungry. And on 
this late April day, I was hungry for an 
Au Bon Pain sandwich. For two years, 
I ordered the same thing, the Turkey 
Avocado, but out of fear of becoming a 
regular, I’d go long stretches avoiding 
the place when I felt myself becoming 
too predictable. 

But most of the time, each day at noon, 

there I was, like clockwork running up 
and down the Union stairs, stuffing 
my Turkey Avocado into my backpack, 
already late for my discussion. A text 
from my friend in class would read, 
“Dude you still coming? I have a seat.”

This whole operation of having my 

lunch in class would have gone a lot more 
smoothly if I was a quiet eater. But I 
have a habit of getting food everywhere, 
crinkling paper bags too loudly, chewing 
at the quietest times in lecture. My 
friend, 
the 
“still 
coming?” 
friend, 

would look at me with a mix of humor 
and humiliation. I could never figure 
out which was stronger. Nonetheless, I 
persevered, for lunchtime is lunchtime, 
and who am I to disrupt it?

Eventually, I learned to stop taking 

classes at noon.

The point here is that on this day in 

late April 2018, the front doors to the 
Union didn’t open. I tried them a few 
more times. In the moment, I tried to 
think of a single time in my three years 
at the University of Michigan when the 
Union doors wouldn’t open. I couldn’t 
think of one. I’d opened those doors 
from nine to five and every hour before 
and after. But indeed, this time they 
were locked, and it took me a minute to 
remember, oh, that’s right, the Re:Union.

The Re:Union is the name of the 

massive 
renovation 
project 
the 

University is undertaking to overhaul the 
Michigan Union. It will take two years 
and $85 million, and aims, according to 
the website, to “restore and reactivate 
the Michigan Union while maintaining 
its historic fabric and reasserting its 
role as a vibrant social hub and locus 
of inclusivity, innovation, activism and 
involvement.”

That’s quite a mouthful. A lot of 

moving parts there. Still, I don’t think 
one student who has walked through the 
Union would disagree with the premise, 
that the place needed an overhaul. It 
took me three years to realize there was 
a piano hall, just to the left of the front 
entrance, where I’d walked by a hundred 
times before. It took me just as long to 
find all the damn printers.

The first floor always felt strangely 

empty. The second was easily forgotten. 
On Yom Kippur, I’d ascend the steps to 

the conference hall upstairs, where 
they occasionally held services, 
and rediscover that not only did the 
second floor exist, but that it had a 
pool table and bathrooms and — 
during Yom Kippur — a lot of well-
dressed Jews.

The Union was secretive in 

that way — filled with unexplored 
hallways and dead ends and rooms 
and rumors of access to the roof. 
There 
was the Tap Room 

without 
a tap, a Mediterranean 

restaurant that 
sold 
Mexican 

food, 
a Barnes & Noble that 

never 
seemed to have your 

books and that never seemed to 
be 
open when you needed it 

(and most egregiously, somehow 
always ran out of Blue Books the 
morning 
of your midterm).

There 
were 
couches 
that 

looked 
like someone dropped 

them 
off from a yard sale and 

couldn’t 
figure out where to 

fit 
them; food shops that sold 

exam 
packets; sober dances 

ripped 
straight out of high 

school; phone booths I did interviews 
in for jobs I didn’t get; a tech store with 
overpriced headphones I purchased four 
times a year; a Wendy’s open late but 
never late enough; small rooms for club 
meetings I’d attend two or three times 
before asking to be removed from the 
email list. This was part of its allure — 
the confoundedness of the building.

My first Welcome Week, a few kids 

I’d met at orientation decided to explore 
it. One of them suggested that we could 
get to the roof via a hidden stairwell. He 
said there might even be a pool up there. 
His older brother had found it, he swore. 
It was just a matter of finding the door.

We went up the fluorescent staircase 

by the north entrance, a little drunk, 
a little stupid, making more noise 
than those upstairs offices deserved. 
Quickly lost, we started aimlessly 
wandering around, reading literature 
about programs we didn’t know the 
University had and administrative titles 
that seemed hopelessly bureaucratic. I 
did, in fact, find a door to the roof, and 
a window too, but both were locked, 
and after some half-hearted attempts 
at picking the bolts, we gave up and 
descended the stairs.

We never found the pool, and I lost 

touch with those kids afterward. I 
never had much faith that that it was up 
there (though the Union did, in fairness, 
actually once have a pool). The pool-on-
the-roof is such a classic ploy leveled 
against freshmen by their older siblings 
that it would have been unfathomable 
to believe it. I looked for a pool on the 
roof as a high school freshman too, and 
that didn’t exist either. But sometimes 
it’s liberating to believe in something 
because you’re expected to. You never 
really know when the pool might be real. 
I’m just saying it doesn’t hurt to check.

That wasn’t the last time I’d get lost 

in the halls of the Union. It was absurdly 
inaccessible, 
extremely 
difficult 

to navigate — as bewildering for a 
freshman as life smacking you dead in 
the face. Hallways didn’t go where they 
should have gone. There were rooms 
that looked like they hadn’t been used 
since the 70s, and certainly hadn’t had a 
design update since then. 

Getting lost in the Union was, in a 

sense, a rite of passage. We all had to 
figure out where the Tap Room printers 
were. We all, in our own ways, stared at 
grades below our standards on Canvas 
in the cafeteria, read rejection emails on 
the couches and fell asleep in the huge 
chairs in the study lounge with a red eye 
from Starbucks in hand — spilling it just 
enough to wake ourselves up with the 

burn.

Eventually, though, you found your 

way through the Union. Eventually, you 
learned where the hell the bathrooms 
were and what the hell a red eye from 
Starbucks was, learned who you wanted 
to see in that cafeteria off Au Bon Pain, 
and who you didn’t. You didn’t notice the 
progression. One day you looked back 
and realized it just sort of happened. 

Will the class of 2024 experience 

spring as tangibly with a Union courtyard 
roofed by glass? Will they feel history as 
present in the post-renovation “media-
rich zones” as it did in the sweltering 
heat of a corroding study lounge? 
Will breakups be as meaningful — as 
quintessentially college — when they’re 
no longer shared with the rest of the Tap 
Room, done in those damp basement 
corners over Subway sandwiches, in 
hushed whispers still loud enough for 
the rest of the room to hear? “It’s just 
that… that at this point, well, I’m in 
college, I’m trying new things out, and I 
just think that I’m not in the place for… 
something like this right now….” “What 
is this…?” they ask back in a curt tone 
— masking hurt. There’s never a right 
answer.

Can this all exist in a “welcome and 

flexible environment” like the newly 
planned Idea Hub? Will it be — for all 
this talk of collaboration and innovation 
— ever so organic and shared again?

Sure. Probably. It seems senior year 

has a habit of making people grossly 
nostalgic, and I’ve easily fallen into the 
trap. I’m a sucker, I admit it. I have no 
doubt that when the Union reopens in 
2020, the newly designed north entrance, 
complete with a glass overhang, will 
indeed promote an inclusive and open 
experience, as the website claims. I’m 
sure freshmen will walk through it just 
as I did, looking for roof access they’re 
likely to be disappointed by. Maybe that 
glass overhang will be what keeps those 
explorers in touch, rather than fall away.

What it will not be, unsurprisingly, is 

the same. I won’t be around to see this 
new, glorious hub of student interaction; 
to learn new places to have discreet 
phone calls and print assignments 
rushed to the last minute; to fall asleep 
on new chairs and couches and compose 
breakup texts over whatever new food 
options are available. And I’ll say, thank 
god for it. I was satisfied with eating 
my Panda Express while wet, hot, cold, 
disheveled, elated, disappointed, happy, 
tired, content, angry, heartbroken, and 
writing out:

“I’m just … not in the mindset right 

now …”

S

ending contraceptives through 
the mail seems like a remnant 
of the early 20th century when 

methods of preventing pregnancy 
and sexually transmitted diseases 
were largely relegated to legally-
murky backchannels. But 86 years 
after Margaret Sanger’s shipment of 
diaphragms to a New York City doctor 
was confiscated, students at Catholic 
universities are using anonymous 
texting services and covertly mailed 
packages to circumvent their schools’ 
restrictions on sexual health products.

Colleges and universities provide 

health care and insurance to millions 
of young American students, but these 
health plans often do not adequately 
cover sexual health resources or 
services such as condoms and birth 
control. In addition to preventing 
pregnancy and disease, contraception 
has 
other, 
equally 
important 

applications. Women who suffer from 
endometriosis use hormonal birth 
control to control painful periods and 
prevent infertility. Hormonal birth 
control is also used to treat polycystic 
ovary Syndrome, primary ovarian 
insufficiency and acne.

With 
over 
19 
million 
students 

enrolled 
in 
higher 
education 

institutions, campus health centers 
and insurance plans are essential to 
the conversation surrounding their 
health care. By denying students 
access to contraceptives, Catholic 
universities make it difficult for 
students with medical conditions to 
receive care while also withholding 
the resources and tools that would 
encourage students to be safe during 
sexual activity. 

Health care payers in academia 

and the private sector refused to 
cover contraceptive care on religious 
grounds. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 
for example, successfully challenged 
the 
requirement 
that 
it 
cover 

contraception for employees under 
the Affordable Care Act before the 
Supreme Court on the grounds of its 
management’s religious objections. 
The larger tension evident in Burwell 
v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. — between 
the religious freedom of institutions 
and the right of Americans to have 
reproductive care covered by their 
insurance — also manifests itself in 
certain 
religious-affiliated 
college 

health care systems, particularly at 
Catholic universities. 

While not all students use their 

school’s health insurance, many, if 
not most, students use university 
health centers. At public universities, 
contraceptives 
are 
generally 

available 
at 
these 
university-run 

clinics. At colleges and universities 

with religious affiliations, this is 
often not the case. Some schools’ 
health centers, such as those at 
Fordham University and Georgetown 
University, only prescribe hormonal 
birth control for non-contraceptive 
uses. While controversial, providing 
contraceptives at Catholic universities 
isn’t 
entirely 
without 
precedent. 

The University of Notre Dame, for 
example, recently began allowing its 
health center to prescribe hormonal 
contraceptives for the purpose of 
preventing 
pregnancy 
despite 
a 

federal court ruling allowing it to be 
exempt from a U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services mandate 
to supply contraception.

What 
happens 
when 
university 

health systems refuse to provide 
contraceptives 
or 
sexual 
health 

information — services that college 
students both want and need? At 
Boston College — a Jesuit institution 
in the leafy Boston suburb of Chestnut 
Hill, Mass. — friction has been growing 
between students and administrators 
over sexual health resources. This 
protracted 
enmity 
illustrates 
the 

tension between what providers want 
to offer and what Americans need — 
reflecting a bitter division that exists 
across the United States. 

Boston 
College’s 
University 

Health Services does not provide 
contraceptives since premarital sex 
is against the institution’s rules. 
Boston College’s Code of Student 
Conduct states that “incidents of 
sexual intercourse outside the bonds 

of matrimony may be referred to the 
Student 
Conduct 
System.” 
While 

this policy is not strictly enforced, 
its presence in the Code of Conduct 
is symbolic, demonstrating just how 
deeply Catholic beliefs about sexuality 
are embedded in the established 
principles of Boston College.

It seems unlikely that all students 

follow this policy, an assumption 
supported in a study conducted by 
Boston College alum Connor Kratz. 
He found that in 2018, 79.9 percent 
of students reported being sexually 
active during their tenure at the 
school.

Boston College Students for Sexual 

Health was founded in 2009 by Boston 

College 
students. 

After 89 percent of voting students 
approved a referendum asking for 
improved access to contraceptives 
and sexual health information, SSH 
was established to construct a peer-
to-peer 
network 
countering 
the 

administration’s refusal to take action. 
Notably, the group changed their 
name to Students for Sexual Health, 
excising their explicit affiliation with 
Boston College when the college’s 
administration threatened them with 
disciplinary action. 

SSH has faced significant opposition 

in their quest to provide condoms 
and other contraceptive devices to 
students, despite a 2018 non-binding 
referendum which found 94 percent 
of students in favor of accessible 
contraception. 
Furthermore, 
SSH 

initially ran so-called “safe sites” — 

places where students could obtain 
condoms and information — out of 
their dorm rooms until Boston College 
threatened disciplinary action. Now, 
SSH is turning to the postal service to 
distribute condoms.

Boston 
College 
junior 
Esteban 

Coellar, SSH acting president, said the 
group’s practice of mailing condoms 
to students is federally protected.

The Comstock Law, under which 

Margaret 
Sanger’s 
package 
was 

confiscated in 1932, prohibited the 
distribution of “obscene” materials 
such as condoms and sexual health 
information. A series of Supreme 
Court cases eventually found the law 
and others like it unconstitutional. 
This loophole is grudgingly accepted 
by the Boston College administration, 
though SSH hopes that one day 
these secretive and mecumbersome 
methods will not be necessary.

“Ultimately, our goal is to get to 

a place where University Health 
Services 
offers 
sexual 
health 

resources,” Coellar said. This year, 
they’re starting small and specific. 
“We’re trying to get UHS to provide 
Plan B to sexual assault victims.” 

Students 
at 
Vincentian-founded 

DePaul 
University 
— 
a 
Catholic 

institution in Chicago — are using 
similar methods.

DePaul University senior Jenni 

Holtz is the co-founder of Students 
for Reproductive Justice, a student-
run organization promoting sexual 
health at DePaul and in the Chicago 
community. 
They 
said 
grassroots 

efforts are important when students 
are 
asking 
for 
changes 
in 
the 

administration.

SRJ recently began running TxtJane, 

a confidential delivery service that 
began at Loyola University Chicago. 
Students can text a designated number 
and a member of SRJ will personally 
deliver contraceptives or pregnancy 
tests to a specified location. TxtJane 
was inspired by the Jane Collective, 
a clandestine network of women who 
provided abortions in Chicago during 
the four years prior to the Roe v. Wade 
decision.

“What’s important to us is to get 

resources to students even when the 
administration refuses to protect 
their students,” Holtz said. “Our 
efforts are also showing students 
what the university is not providing 
to them, so they can share in our 
anger and get involved in calling out 
the administration for their lack of 
care for students. We have been able 
to get resources to students without 
help from the university and we will 
continue to do so until DePaul does 
it.”
