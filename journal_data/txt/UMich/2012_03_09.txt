John Seto to
temporarily replace
retiring chief
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily NewsoEditor
Following the recent
announcement that Ann Arbor
Police Chief Barnett Jones plans
to retire, the city of Ann Arbor
announced yesterday that John
Seto, the deputy chief of the Ann
Arbor Police Department, will
assume the role of interim AAPD
chief and safety services area
administrator starting March 31.
Seto has worked with the
department for more than 20
years and has been in charge of
AAPD's patrol division during
his time as deputy chief. Initial
reports suggested that Jones
would retire on April 1, but a
press statement released yester-
day reported that he will retire
March 30.
The release notes that City
Administrator Steven Powers
willeventually recommend acan-
didate for the permanent replace-
ment of Jones. Powers could not
be reached for comment yester-
day.
In an interview yesterday, Seto
said he plans to meet with Jones

and Powers in the upcoming
weeks to discuss his responsibili-
ties as interim chief.
Seto said the city is losing a
valuable assetto its police depart-
ment with the
retirement of
Jones. , AO
"Chief Jones
has been a great .
leader during
some challeng-
ing times," Seto
said. "I appreciate his guidance
not only as a law enforcement
executive but also as a friend."
Last week, Seto joined Jones at
a meeting at Ann Arbor's Clague
Middle School to address a recent
trend of home invasions through-
out the city. As interim chief, Seto
will inherit the investigation into
the more than 82 home invasions
that have occurred in the city
since January.
Seto is also a member of the
Student Safety Workgroup, a
collaboration between AAPD,
the Department of Public Safety,
the Division of Student Affairs
and the Sexual Assault Preven-
tion and Awareness Center in an
effort to keep students safe on
and off campus.
Seto said in an interview in
January that he became involved
in the workgroup to demonstrate

More than 250 students and
members of the Ann Arbor com-
munity waited in line among a
smattering of art and sculptures

at the University of Michigan
Museum of Art yesterday in
hopes of attending a speech by
Bothaina Kamel - Egyptian
activist, former news anchor
and a candidate in the Egyptian
presidential election.
Kamel was invited to the
University to deliver the 2012
Motorola Lecture on Gender
and the Media sponsored by the
Women's Studies Department
and Institute for Research on
Women and Gender - sched-
uled to coincide with Interna-

tional Women's Day. During her
address, Kamel talked about
the important role of women
and the younger generation in
Egypt's revolution and the cur-
rent obstacles to the movement.
She said women in Egypt
faced challenges even after for-
mer president Hosni Mubarak
was ousted from office last
February as a result of protests
in Tahrir Square following a
30-year rule. She noted this is
particularly due to the elimi-

nation of the quota system in the
Egyptian Parliament to encour-
age gender equality, noting that
less than 1 percent of the cur-
rent parliament is comprised of
women.
She added that Mubarak and
his sons had ultimate sovereignty,
but now that he is no longer in
power, women - like Kamel -
can contribute to the government.
During her presentation,
Kamel played four videos, one of
which depicted a young woman
who said the army sexually
assaulted her in prison under the
guise of a "virginity test," though

the army denied the existence of
these tests. Another video showed
a December 2011 women's protest
march against military brutality.
"Egyptian women would face
the difficulties with courage and
bravery," Kamel said.
She added that while the rise of
Islamist and conservative parties
- which have won a large share
of votes in Tunisia and Egypt - is
problematic, it did not signal the
end of the revolution.
"The revolutionaries seek only
a free Egypt," she said.
Following a standing ovation
after her speech, Kamel held a
40-minute question-and-answer
session with attendees.
Kamel said a focus of her cam-
paign is to promote the strength

of women and her political goals,
adding that a female president
will be symbolic of revolutionary
change in Egypt.
"When the revolution is victo-
rious, there will be a female presi-
dent," she said.
Kamel also said she supports
religious freedom for all people.
Kamel, who does not wear a
headscarf, said wearing a head
covering must remain one's
choice.
Ahmed Nada, a 16-year-old
Egyptian student who attends
Skyline High School inAnnArbor,
said he was in Tahrir Square dur-
ing the protests, and told Kamel
that at the time he thought the
"revolution had already died."
Kamel disagreed with the sen-
timent and in an interview with
The Michigan Daily interview fol-
lowing the speech she expressed
sadness at the aggressiveness of
Egyptian students. She said the

youth in Egypt are shaped by the
atmosphere of the revolution and
are constantly critical.
"The youth wants to break
everything," Kamel said.
However, she differentiated
between Egyptian students and
those at the University, who she
said were very courteous.
"Your students give the energy
of this city (Ann Arbor)," Kamel
said.
Kamel stressed that the foun-
dation of the revolution stems
from the younger generation
while adults "merely support it."
"When the youth sacrifice, the
adults try to steal it," Kamel said.
Business and LSA senior
Ahmad Soliman, president of the
Egyptian Student Association,
said he thought coming to see
Kamel's speech was worthwhile.
"Talks like this give us a chance
to understand some of the nuance
of what is going on," Soliman said.

outside the ballroom so students
could sign up to volunteers for
the campaign.
The forum also included
two University students - LSA
freshman Pavitra Abraham, a
campus organizer for the Obama
campaign in Ann Arbor, and
Business junior Taqee Vernon,
the spokesman for the Black
Student Union - Matt Kerry, a
student at the University's Dear-
born campus, also participated.
The three students shared per-
sonal stories about why they
decided to support Obama.
Penn said he decided to join
the Obama campaign primar-
ily because he was bothered
the handling of national affairs
by former President George W.
Bush, noting examples of how
faulty policy negatively impact-
ed his friends.
Specifically, Penn said Bush's
lack of priorities were exempli-
fied by one friend of his who
couldn't afford eyeglasses due
to financial strife, while anoth-
er friend of his was offered a
$90,000 contract to work for the
organization formerly known as
Halliburton, a defense contrac-
tor, in Iraq.
"I thought it was absolutely
crazy that my friends had to
make a decision in the world's
richest, most powerful coun-
try, to make a decision between
a minimum wage job and
90-grand for driving a truck
through a warzone for a private
company, or eyeglasses or text-
books," Penn said. "To me, that
seemed nuts."
Penn said he learned about
what youth voters cared about
by working as Obama's youth
liaison.
"I realized that most young
people, regardless of their politi-
cal affiliations, agreed on quite a
lot," Penn said.
He added that it is impor-
tant Obama is re-elected so that
he can continue to strengthen
achievements made during his
first term.

"It was a distinct honor to
serve the president as he dou-
bled the Pell Grant, created the
American Opportunity Tax
Credit, repealing 'don't ask,
don't tell,' ending the war in
Iraq - taking care of bin Laden
wasn't so bad - and making sure
that 2.5 million young Ameri-
cans could stay on their parent's
health-insurance plan," Penn
said.
In an interview with the Daily
after the event, Penn said though
he understands that though citi-
zens may be cynical about the
political climate in America,
Obama is a better choice com-
pared to the current field of
Republican challengers,
During the panel, Dingell
lauded the importance of col-
lege students in comprising
the American workforce of the
future.
"You're only 25 percent of the
population, but you're 100 per-
cent of our future," Dingell said.
Dingell criticized Republi-
can presidential candidate Rick
Santorum for recent comments
in opposition to Obama's prior-
ity on increasing college afford-
ability.
"(Santorum) said President
Obama was a snob for wanting
everyone to go to college," Ding-
ell said. "Well I was of that gen-
eration that fought in World War
II, and we came back and they
gave us an education to thank
us for what we did for our coun-
try. It was great for us, but it was
even better for the country."
Kerry, who accepted a job as
a field manager for the Obama
campaign, became paralyzed
from a dive into shallow water
several years ago. Kerry spoke
about how his family ran into
financial issues following his
accident, noting that he is grate-
ful for Obama's work toward
passing the Affordable Care Act.
"I no longer have to worry
about my pre-existing condition
in the future. I can't be dropped
from plan for my condition,"
Kerry said. "Even more than
that, tens of millions of young
Americans will have insurance
now."

NEWS BRIEFS
LANSING
Mich. group pushes
for campaign
finance disclosure
A Michigan group began col-
lecting signatures yesterday for
a ballot measure requiring far
more disclosure of corporate
donations so voters can see who's
making unlimited gifts to spe-
cial interest groups. The Corpo-
rate Accountability Amendment
would change the state constitu-
tion to require corporations as
well as any group receiving cor-
porate donations to identify who
gave the money.
A 2010 U.S. Supreme Court
ruling enabled corporations and
other well-financed donors to give
unlimited money to political com-
mittees that don't directly work
with campaigns. The decision has
resulted in political action com-
mittees known as super PACs
pouring millions of dollars into
the 2012 presidential race.

Texas could fund

Gov. Rick Perry has told Texas
health officials to find a way to
pay for a women's health care pro-
gram if the federal government
pulls Medicaid funding amid a
fight over Planned Parenthood. '
The governor sent a letter
Thursday telling the head of the
Texas Health and Human Servic-
es Commission to work with legis-
lative leaders to identify money to
keep the program going.
Perry's office made a copy of
that letter available to The Associ-
ated Press before it was released to
the public.
The program was expected to
close when the state starts enforc-
ing a law keeping money from

Knowles discussed how the
the involvement of college stu-
dents and teenagers across the
country helped the movement be
successful.
"Literally overnight we came
up with the idea Love is Loud-
er," Knowles said. "And we just
watched it take off and it came
to mean any form of support or
change in perspective that takes
us away from that dark negative
place to make us feel better."
Laura Blake Jones, associate
vice president for student affairs
and dean of students, attended
the conference and said it was an
important opportunity to bring
people together and foster dis-
cussion of mental health issues.
Jones added that the Univer-
sity has established efforts to
address these issues, including
the development of a new the-
atre performance by the ETC
titled "Finding our Footholds:
College Students Reflect on Pos-
itive Mental Health," that was
performed at the conference and
created using interviews with
University students.
"Peer theatre is an innova-
tive approach to engage audi-
ence and convey information in
a very personal way," Jones said.
"I've seen the ETC at orienta-
tion and their production is very
thoughtful and very high quality
and engaging. It's a really great
way to raise awareness on the
campus community and connect
students to resources."
John Greden, the execu-
tive director of the University's

Depression Center, wrote in an
e-mail interview that depres-
sion, anxiety and stress affect
one in six college students.
"The University of Michigan
is dedicated to counteracting
these problems," Greden wrote.
"The durability of this convic-
tion is reflected by fact that this
year marks the Depression on
College Campuses tenth anni-
versary."
Greden added that the con-
ference provided a medium for
campus leaders to develop bet-
ter strategies to conquer mental
health issues in the college set-
ting.
"This year we're particularly
emphasizing college students'
innate and impressive resiliency
to share best-practice approach-
es to help all students better
cope with stress," Greden wrote.
Greden also wrote that the
media only raises awareness
about depression after a tragedy,
and the conference allowed indi-
viduals to discuss mental health
issues that occur in daily life.
Angela Farrehi, student advo-
cacy manager for the College of
Engineering, moderated a panel
discussion that focused on help-
ing parents build resilience in
students.
Farrehi said each panelist
was able to bring his or her own
unique perspective, expertise
and experiences to the topic.
"It was particularly profound
to have our parent and student
panelists share so openly their
journey through college while
dealing with depression and
anxiety," Farrehi said.
Farrehi added that the dis-
cussion pinpointed areas that

University officials can focus
on when working together as a
community to best support the
mental health of students.
Callie McKee, director of the
ETC, hosted a workshop on how
educational theater can be used
to raise awareness and reduce
the stigma associated with seek-
ing therapy.
"Theatre and performance is
really everywhere," McKee said.
"It allows new ways of telling
our stories and it's about show-
ing the real-life struggles and
that other people struggle too."
McKee said ETC's part-
nership with the University's
Depression Center is key for
educating students about mental
health issues.
Patricia Ponto, the director of
the counseling center at Kalam-
azoo College, attended the
workshop and said she learned
a lot about theater and mental
health while enjoying many of
the activities.
"I thought the workshop was
a very nice break from all the
PowerPoints," Ponto said. "I
attended the workshop because
I was looking for information to
start a similar theatre program
back home. I was really pleased."
Jaspreet Malhotra, a psychol-
ogy graduate student at the Uni-
versity of Florida, attended the
conference to conduct research
for a school project and said it
was an enlightening experience.
"Brittany's speech was really
touching and it was good for her
to speak out for all the people
who are struggling," Malhotra
said. "I was really surprised
at first that a celebrity went
through all that."

can implement those in a collab-
orative effort."
Seto has also participated in
campus discussions regarding
student etiquette on Football
Saturdays. In November 2010,
Seto met with members of the

Royal Shakespeare process that
does this work at this stage in the
development of plays."
The partnership, which start-
ed after the RSC first performed
plays at the University in 2001,
will continue on Saturday when
the RSC returns to campus for its
sixth visit. Instead of perform-
ing shows at the University, the
organization is focusing on cre-
atively developing two plays for
its upcoming fall season, titled "A
World Elsewhere," at its home in
Stratford-upon-Avon, England.
The group will also host sympo-
siums and workshops on campus
through March 20.
Williams, who has been key
in forming the relationship
between the RSC and the Uni-
versity over the last decade, said
this year's visit will be more
involved than the past.
In 2010, the RSC brought
directors, writers, actors, stage
managers, voice coaches and
other players in the produc-
tion process to the University to
consult with experts about the
historical and technical aspects
of the plays, Williams said. This
year that will be the same, but
Williams added the visit would
also bring in more knowledge
and expertise fromboth parties.
"This year ... there is deep pen-
etrationby the Royal Shakespeare
Company into the University, and
our people get a chance to work
with them and the scholars else-
where," Williams said. "It touches
on the intellectual life of the Uni-
versity more broadly than ever
before. This is really exciting."
Gary Krenz, special coun-
sel to University President
Mary Sue Coleman, wrote in
an e-mail interview that both
parties were pleased with the
success of the 2010 visit, which
catalyzed mutual interest in a
return trip.
"They thought that the inter-
actions with faculty, students
and audiences here were really
topnotch and instrumental inthe
development of the three plays
they worked on - all of which
have gone on to successful pro-
duction in England,"he wrote.
Krenz added he heard from
various members of the campus
community that the visit two

years ago spurred desire for the
company to return among both
faculty and students.
"From our standpoint, the
2010 residency was also a great
success," he wrote. "I've had a
number of faculty tell me that
it was a fantastic experience for
themselves and their students,
and that they would welcome the
RSC any time. So the question

complaints to the Ann Arbor
City Council.

wasn't so much whether to come,
but rather when."
Ina Feb. 16 press release, Cole-
man said the return of the RSC is
important to fostering the arts at
the University.
"Creating and conveying the
arts to inspire, captivate and edu-
cate is part of our mission," Cole-
man said.
Williams pointed specifically
to a daylong symposium that the
University's Confucius Institute
will host with the RSC on March
12 as one example of the intel-
lectual collaboration that will be
showcased during the visit.
The visit will also center on
the plays "Boris Godunov" by
Alexander Pushkin, as recently
adapted by Adrian Mitchell, and
"The Orphan of Zhao," which
Williams said is one of the most
important Chinese plays. Wil-
liams said he is excited to be
working on the two productions,
noting that they are "really not
just two plays - they are cultural
artistic streams."
The upcoming RSC visit grew
out of the group's first creative
residency at the University in
2010 titled "Creative Project
2010," which Williams called
"mutually enriching."
Williams added that Univer-
sity students stand to gain from
working with members of the
RSC, who are true professionals
in their fields.
"It's a mutually deeply benefi-
cial relationship," Williams said.
"It gives our students a sense of
possible excellence. They get
to work with and observe and
imagine the processes of the very
best, and learn that they can do
that too."
School of Theatre junior Emily
Lyon, a self-proclaimed "Shake-
speare dork" who was chosen to
be an assistant director for the
RSC's upcoming residency, said
she is thrilled for the RSC to
return to the University and for
the opportunity to work with its
directors and actors.
Lyon was able to view the
RSC's production of Macbeth
- directed by the RSC artis-
tic director Michael Boyd, who
will be among the group mem-
bers traveling to the University
this week - as part of a theater
program she participated in last
summer in London. Lyon said
her experience watching the
production and the skill of the

RSC makes her hopeful about
her opportunitycto work with the
RSC in the coming weeks.
"Working with the Royal
Shakespeare Company has actu-
ally been my dream .since sev-
enth grade," she said. "It's a huge
opportunity, and extremely
thrilling and exciting. It's sort
of absurd in terms of how lucky
I feel."

For students interested in
learning more about the Occupy
movement,but notkeenon camp-
ing outside in the cold or going
days without showering, the
University recently announced a
lecture series focused on activist
movements and contemporary
political issues.
Titled "Equity, Justice and
Social Change: The Michigan
Tradition of Activism and Edu-
cational Opportunity," the pro-
gram is a month-long series of
lectures and panels that will
address pressing issues facing
students today. The series was
put together by groups of stu-
dents and administrators across
campus, and will cover a broad
range of topics including the
University budget, the history
of activism at the University and
the growing income and educa-
tional gaps in America.
Philip Deloria, the LSA asso-
ciate dean for undergraduate
education, helped plan the series
and will serve as a panelist in the
"Growing Up Activist: Discus-
sion of U-M Faculty from Activ-
ist Families" session. Deloria

the lecture series wil contrioute
to the University's mission to
foster critical discussions about
important issues.
"We'd like to engage thebroad
University community in a broad
set of presentations and discus-
sions concerning these issues,"
Deloria wrote. "In doing so, (we
hope to) continue the tradition
of the University's long and deep
engagement in matters of equity,
social justice, activism, educa-
tional opportunity, and to fulfill
our role as the location for some
of the conversations about things
that matter most in our society."
Deloria noted that the Univer-
sity's campus offers an ideal set-
ting to instigate change.
"Michigan has a long and
storied history of activism,"
he wrote. "Students and young
people in general, are in the best
position to change the world.
They have energy, ideas, and a
serious stake in the future. Of
course universities will be the
places where they organize their
thoughts - and their friends -
and try to bring about change."
Laura Blake Jones, associate
vice president for student affairs
and dean of students, also helped
plan the lecture series and said it
will appeal to a large audience.
"We think that all students
have interest in this ... the well-
being of our society and our
future as a campus community

nity that we live in, are an attect-
ed by all of this. So we want to
engage as many people as we can
in the conversation."
She added that the issues cov-
ered by the lectures are relevant
and touch on topics that the cam-
pus community is passionate
about.
Deloria added that the events
have widespread appeal to indi-
viduals with varying interests,
noting specifically that students
studying economics may be par-
ticularly engaged in lectures on
Universitybudgeting, the history
of social justice activism at the
University and the language of
the 99 percent and one percent.
Vice President of Central
Student Government Brendan
Campbell said the series will
focus on past and present activ-
ism at the University.
"The University of Michigan
has a proud tradition of progres-
sive social movements and we
wanted to plan the lecture series
to help students understand the
history and inspire them to con-
tinue in that tradition," Camp-
bell said.
The first event, "Financingthe
University of Michigan" by Pro-
vost Phil Hanlon, will take place
tonight at 5:15 p.m. on North
Campus.

Practice what you teach
'U' should expand massive open online courses
The cost of higher education has been steadily climbing -
especially in recent years due to the economic downturn.
Recently, universities such as the Georgia Institute of Tech-
nology and Stanford University have offered courses online. On
Feb. 13, 2011, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology unveiled
an expansion of its OpenCourseWare, which allows students to
take online classes for credit - a system better known as a massive
open online course. The University should follow this current trend
in higher education and explore MOOCs as a worthwhile medium
for the dissemination of its curriculum.


Business, the 'U'and you

The University's mission statement pledg-
es to "serve the people of Michigan and
the world through preeminence in creat-
ing, communicating, preserving and apply-
ing knowledge, art, and academic values."
Though these courses don't ultimately lead
to a diploma, the democratization of educa-
tion stands to benefit a group of students that
are strapped for cash yet driven to succeed.
According to the National Center for Educa-
tion Statistics, the cost of tuition at a four-
year institution has tripled since the 1980s,
and more than 700,000 students turned to
distance learning to earn their degrees after
the recession that began in the fall of 2008 -
the number accounts for about 4 percent of
all college undergraduates.
The University has its own MOOC avail-
able as of last month, a course titled "Model
Thinking" taught by Scott Page, a professor of
complex systems, economics and political sci-
ence. The University should expand its aims of
profitable research to make education for all a
priority, and MOOCs are a natural start. Such
an initiative would be a positive influence on
the University's reputation as a proponent
of higher learning. Online, for-profit college
courses, although a possible alternative solu-
tion to getting an education in a recession, are
often criticized as negligent programs that

deliver low-quality results. According to a
recent Huffington Post article, 13 percentof all
college students attended for-profit schools in
2009, and those in bachelor's degree programs
suffered higher rates of unemployment and
loan debt than students attending a public or
private university.
Though education for education's sake is
an admirable rallying cry, it's not necessarily
practical, which is why one school has taken
its MOOC a step further.The Massachusetts
Institute of Technology recently increased
the scope of its own online course program,
unveiling a new venture in December 2011
called MITx. This free program is open learn-
ingsoftware available to all students, including
those from other schools, and users can also
use MITx to obtain a credential for "a modest
fee." Though MITx is not far-reaching enough
to allow students to graduate, certainly this
online option a step in the right direction.
In order to move forward, the University
should seriously consider researching and
implementing more MOOCs. This not-for-
profit action would be admirable and would
increase the University's alumni base. Free
online courses like Page's, whether accred-
ited or not, would be a boon to the University's
reputation and, more importantly, the minds
of hopeful learners.

s the business of America busi-
ness? Is what's good for General
Motors good for the country?
How about
what's good for
Google? .M
These ques-
tions resist
simple answers. 1
Liberal and con-
servative argu-
ments on the JOEL
subject often fail BATTERMAN
to admit just how
deeply involved
our government has always been in
shaping the growth of private enter-
prise. But it's a good time for us to
think about the relationship between
businesses, especially one familiar
public institution: the University of
Michigan. Are the evolving connec-
tions between the University and
for-profit industries evidence of the
corporate conquest of American life?
Are they a potentially transformative
cure for Michigan's economic woes?
A complex phenomenon that merits
careful analysis?
I tend to think it could be all of the
above.
Like other public research uni-
versities, the University has long-
held close ties to business. The
campus landscape is embedded with
the names of private sector leaders
from lumber baron Arthur Hill to
Ford investor Horace Rackham. And
like its peers, the University formed a
crucial link in the postwar partner-
ship between business and the U.S.
government, absorbing billions in
state research dollars for science and
technology.
Under the leadership of University
President Mary Sue Coleman and
Vice President for Research Stephen
Forrest, however, the University has
taken unprecedented steps to deep-
en its relationships with corpora-
tions and make entrepreneurship
a major part of its mission. This is
best symbolized by the University's
purchase of the former Pfizer corpo-

rate campus on Plymouth Road, now
the North Campus Research Com-
plex. The University's campaign to
"galvanize innovation" includes an
expanding range of programs that
train students to startbusinesses and
provide material support, including
direct investment, for student and
faculty-run firms. Since 2007, the
University's Business Engagement
Center has lured companies with the
promise that it will "maximize the
growth potential for your business...
by identifying and accessing the Uni-
versity's vast resources, including
research discoveries, new technol-
ogy, high-tech facilities, student and
alumni talent, continuing education
programs and strategic giving."
These are bigchanges, and they've
put the University on the cutting
edge of a national trend. Coleman
is now chair of the Association of
American Universities and the public
sector co-chair of President Barack
Obama's National Advisory Council
on Innovation and Entrepreneur-
ship. The University can justly claim
to be a leader in the movement to
integrate the public research univer-
sity with the for-profit sector. But is
that for the best?
At its most promising, the trend
could help universities become big-
ger players in American life. If you
asked the average citizen what the
University does for the state of Mich-
igan, a lot of people might be hard-
pressed to come up with answers
not involving football. I would love
to see our University's vast creative
capacities applied to more directly
confront the challenges facing U.S.
society instead of simply churning
out literature on its margins. Univer-
sities are notoriously slow-moving,
and they could learn a lot from the
private sector when it comes to more
nimble practical engagements with
a changing world. On a more imme-
diate level, I'm not sorry to see the
University attracting more industry
to Michigan (especially in cleantech-
nology) instead of simply exporting

our state's best-prepared young peo-
ple to Chicago and the coasts.
Ontheotherhand,thetransforma-
tion of the American public universi-
ty alsoriskserodingits mostvaluable
qualities. Key staffers now say "U-M
must itself become entrepreneurial."
But what. does that mean? Despite
recent buzz about "social entrepre-
neurship," most entrepreneurs are
out for one primary purpose: to make
a large amount of personal profit in
a short amount of time. The Univer-
sity, by contrast, is not a for-profit
institution. It operates on a scale of
centuries, not years. And on paper, at
least, it exists for the benefitof all the
state's citizens.
Industry ties
bring oppurtunity
along with risk.
It is somewhat ironic that the
University is pioneering the inte-
gration of the public research uni-
versity with private enterprise,
since most of Michigan's current
woes arise from certain limitations
of the latter. My own opinion of
global capitalism is far from fixed,
but it's pretty clear that its habit of
sacrificing long-term community
prosperity for short-term gain has
not always served our state so well.
The various elements of our society
desperately need to be reconciled
around civil and ecological sus-
tainability, and learning between
different sectors could conceivably
further that goal. The real question
is who's dictating the terms, and
that's a question for another col-
umn. Stay tuned.

Record debt under Obama

(Critical) reading on the beach

President Obama's campaign announced
that it plans to send campaign staffers to 10 col-
leges in swing states to reach out to youth vot-
ers in what they're calling "Student Summits."
The University of Michigan was one of the
schools selected by campaign staff for a visit.
In 2008, the youth voting demographic
went heavily to Obama - he carried a whop-
ping 66 percent to McCain's 32 percent.
Obama utilized social media, celebrity
endorsements and refreshing campaign rhet-
oric to help capture that key demographic.
He had little record to run on as a first-term
U.S. Senator. Now, more than three years
later, he has a record for voters to look at -
but it's grim.
Under the Obama administration, the grad-
uating class of 2011 became the most indebted
graduating class in history, with average per
student debt sitting at $22,900. In addition, the
average portion of the national debt per citizen
sits at approximately $49,000.
In addition, unemployment among young
people is twice the national average at nearly
18 percent. Real-unemployment is even higher.
In Michigan, the rate of unemployment is
above the national average at an astounding

9.3 percent, according to the U.S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics.
Meanwhile, Michigan's underemploy-
ment rate, which is generally believed to be
a better indicator of the actual job market,
ties with four other states for highest in the
nation, sitting between 21 and 24 percent in
December 201L
Major cities in Michigan have been hit
even harder than the state as a whole. Unem-
ployment in Detroit hovers at 20 percent as
of early 2012.
Young people in Michigan, as well as
nationwide, are graduating college with
more debt than ever before in history and
entering one of worst job markets to date. We
will be curious to see what Obama campaign
staffers say to young people to try to win back
their support after his administration spent
the last three years failing them.
College Republicans at the 10 schools select-
ed will be doing their part over the next few
weeks to educate their peers regarding how the
administration has failed young people.
Gus Portela is the Michigan state
chairman of College Republicans.

Over spring break, I read
Khaled Hosseini's "The Kite
Runner"
for essentially
the first time. I
say "essentially"
because I began
reading it over
winter break, but
ended up putting
it down when
I got back to LEAH
school because I POTKIN
was immediately
bombarded with
tests, papers and the like.
However, I ended up having to
read the bestseller for a course.
While reading for class, I was able to
get caught up in the story, emoting at
the proper times and feeling a great
sense of connection with the charac-
ters. And while my reactions to the
novel were normal enough, I couldn't
help but reflect on my readingstyle as
I turned the pages of the text, eager
to see what would happen next.
What I came to realize was that
whenever I read something for a
class or for an academic purpose,
I couldn't help but read critically.
My style shifts away from naive and
unassuming and toward analytical.
For better or for worse, it alters my
relationship with the text and men-
tally keeps me on my toes.
The concept of reading critically
versus reading for pleasure is some-
thing I have been studying in one of
my classes and hasled me to explore
and examine my personal reading
habits. I've discovered, contrary to
what I'd expected, I get more fulfill-
ment and enjoyment from my critical
reading than I do from my vacation-
style reading.
In fact, I encourage all students
to take a step back and examine how
they read. I truly think that under-

standing how we read can greatly
enhance the benefits and enjoyment
of reading itself.
I can pinpoint my own experience
with "The Kite Runner" as evidence.
When I began reading the book over
winter break, Iread carelessly for the
sole purpose of mindless enjoyment.
And, while there's nothing wrong
with this approach - after all, I was
on vacation - I found when I went
back to it from where I had left off
only a few short weeks before, I could
hardlyremember character names or
major plot themes - embarrassing, I
know.'
Intrigued, I went back to review
some of the books I'd read for class
before an exam, and discovered I had
no trouble remembering the same
information I had so easily forgotten
when I wasn't reading critically.
From this experience, it seems
that unlike pleasure reading, during
which most people are merely look-
ing for interesting plots or charac-
ters to entertain them while idling
away time on the beach or trying to
fall asleep, critical reading forces
people to become more involved in
all aspects of a book. Critical read-
ers seek, among other things, the
author's perspective, the book's dis-
tinguishing features and the book's
relevance to the general topic being
taught by the assigning professor.
When critically reading "The Kite
Runner," I found myself marking or
re-reading certain passages in an
effort to comprehensively understand
their significance and consider their
relevance - something I can never
remember doing when reading on the
beach. This deeper immersion left
me with an enhanced appreciation of
the book's message and overall better
understandingof the issues raised.
I would venture to say that as stu-
dents at a prestigious university, it's

in our nature to read critically when
reading for class. We all strive to suc-
ceed, and in doing so, we read with
the purpose of extracting informa-
tion and applying it later,- often only
for exams, mind you.
But it seems this increasingly aca-
Take a step back
and examine
how you read.
demic critical reading approach has
its benefits inside and outside the
classroom.Atleast in my recent expe-
rience with "The Kite Runner," criti-
cally I realized that books ranging
from great novels like Hosseini's to
what some would call trashy "beach
reads" are more enjoyable when read
through a slightly critical lens. Not
to mention, as we're presented with
countless reading materials every
day, reading critically is vital in order
to extract the important informa-
tion from sources that aren't already
tweet-length.
This might all sound a bit abstract,
but ultimately there is pedagogical
value in critically readingtexts of all
sorts, and students should capitalize
on their abilities to hone in on texts
for more than just the sake of a good
grade or a classroom discussion. In
myexperience, it certainlymakes for
a far more interesting, if not enlight-
ening, reading experience both
inside and outside the classroom.

Found-footage party film is
failed, uninspiring 'Project'

By AKSHAY SETH
Daily Arts Writer
It was a novel idea - a teenage
comedy shot in found-footage
format, soaked in the traditional
dose of sadis-
tic vulgarity*
while manag-
ing to maintain ProjctY

connection to At Qualty 16
reality. Even and Rave

to come off as
hilarious yet relatable. And to cop
it all off, comedic mastermind
Todd Phillips ("The Hangover")
took the reins, promising to
redeem himself after the disas-
ter that was "The Hangover Part
II." Everyone was excited about
"Project X," the film that would
change the comedy genre for the
better. Then the movie came out.
And to be frank, there's no better
way of describing it than saying
chat it flat out sucked ass.
It starts out nicely enough,
pulling the audience through the
boring lives of the three nerdy
protagonists, Thomas (new-
comer Thomas Mann), Costa
(newcomer Oliver Cooper) and
JB (newcomer Jonathan Daniel
* Brown), in expectedly slow fash-
ion. The jokes at this point in the
film are sparse but entertaining,
as if hinting at something great
that's about to come.
Sadly, that something great
never makes an appearance, and
all we're left with is a bunch of
stupid kids getting drunk and
puking into the camera every
other second. All the faux badas-
sery on display could have been
funny, but only if it wasn't the
focal point for the entire film.

Michigan squares off with Gophers

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Writer
One down, two to go.

Michigan men's basketball team
have talked about champion-
ships. Having already accom-
plished their

"We've still TV/Radio:
got goals ahead BTN
of us," said
senior guard
Zack Novak on Monday. "(Win-
ning the conference tourna-
ment) was one of the goals we
had since the beginning of the
season. We're going to go there
with all we got."
Added Michigan coach John
Beilein: "It's really important
that we go in there with that
mindset right now that, 'Alright,
this is another step.' You want
to really have a great season?
Go win a Big Ten Tournament
Championship, because you
don't have to share that with
anyone."
Having received a first-round
bye, Michigan will square off
with No. 10 seed Minnesota
(6-12 Big Ten, 19-13 overall),
fresh off its upset over North-
western on Thursday.
The Wolverines have had
almost a full week of rest.
Beilein said Monday that the
early portion of the week would
be dedicated mostly to rest and
recovery, while the latter part
would be spent preparing for
both the Wildcats and Gophers.
Beilein said the teamwould
prepare equally for both poten-
tial opponents because both
teams pose different problems.

Louisville

TODD NEEDLE/Daily
Sophomore guard Tim Hardaway Jr. and Michigan had a five-point victory over Minnesota early in the season. The teams face off in Indianapolis today.

plan needs to be reinforced.
"Minnesota seems like it
was a year ago, so that's where
I'm going first in my scouting,"
Beilein said. "(In practice), it's
going to be very difficult to
duplicate Minnesota's athleti-
cism, their shot-blocking ability,
their speed and quickness."
The Wolverines and Min-
nesota met just once this sea-
son. In that contest, the Golden
Gophers jumped out to a quick
6-0 lead, but thanks to a break-
out game from freshman point
guard Trey Burke, who scored a
career-best 27 points, Michigan
won, 61-56.
Minnesota trailed the entire
second half, but managed to cut
its deficit to one point, before

squandering a chance to take the
lead with a shot-clock violation
that occurred with less than 70
seconds remaining.
The Gophers are led by junior
forward Rodney Williams, who
leads the team in both points
(10.9) and rebounds (5.5), but
will likely be without their top
low-post presence. Senior cen-
ter Ralph Sampson III - who
averages 1.3 blocks per game -
is expected to miss the entire
tournament with a knee injury
he suffered earlier this week in
practice.
Minnesota's overtime win
over the Wildcats was sparked
by the return of junior point
guard Julian Welch, who missed
the final two regular season

games with a hip injury. Nor-
mally a starter, Welch came
off the bench to score 11 points
Thursday.
Michigan (13-5, 23-8), mean-
while, has been playing perhaps
its best basketball of the season
lately. The 13th-ranked Wolver-
ines have won six of their last
seven games, closing out the
regular season with back-to-
back victories on the road.
The emergence of two pre-
viously slumping sophomores,
guard Tim Hardaway Jr. and
forward Evan Smotrycz, pro-
pelled Michigan to wins at Illi-
nois and Penn State. The duo
combined to score 58 points in
the wins. After shooting below
30 percent from long range

for most of the season, Hard-
away Jr. shot 7-of-10 from deep,
while Smotrycz shot 4-of-5 from
3-point land. With its two most
dangerous scorers producing
at such efficient levels, Novak
believes Michigan can pose a
serious threat to take home the
tournament crown.
"When they're clicking like
that ... it felt like we were getting
good looks," Novak said. "I think
we're very dangerous. Just with
how deep we go, and obviously
when we've got those guys mak-
ing the shots that they were, it
just makes us harder to guard."
Should the Wolverines win on
Friday, they'll advance to play
the Ohio State-Purdue winner
in Saturday's semifinals.

The Michigan softball team is
heading south again.
The 14th-ranked Wolverines
have traveled to Louisville, Kent.
annually since 2008, and this
year they'll face No. 16 Louisville,
Saint Louis and Illinois State
in the Red and Black Classic at
Ulmer Stadium.
Michigan (15-5 overall) is
coming off a loaded spring break
trip to Florida. The Wolverines
played 11 games in .10 days and
faced tough competition in the
two tournaments. Last weekend,
the squad went 4-1and took down
then-No. 14 UCLA and then-No.
19 Auburn thanks to rallying
efforts from senior centerfielder
Bree Evans and senior first base-
man Amanda Chidester and solid
pitching from freshman lefty
Haylie Wagner.
Though Michigan's offense
was proficient, the Wolverine
defense had its faults.
The games during the Florida
campaign were riddled with
errors - 11 in total. Michigan
dropped a 10-7 slugfest to Loui-
siana-Lafayette as a result of two
errors, but did a better job recov-
ering defensively in its game
againstVirginia after committing
three errors.
Senior second baseman Ashley
Lane realizes the defense hasn't
been on the top of its game late-
ly but has confidence that it will
continue to improve before con-
ference play.
"We take
every team we
play with the *
same process."
"We know we're a good defen-
sive team," Lane said. "I think
it's just staying in that one-pitch
focus. We might lose it some-
times, but we're a really good 0
team, (both) defensively and
offensively."
And though the defense has
been struggling, it's come up big
in games against ranked oppo-
nents.
So far this season, the Wolver-
ines are 4-1 against ranked teams,
committing just three errors in
those five games. This weekend,
Michigan takes on tournament
host No.16 Louisville on Saturday
morning.
Lane notes that the team isn't
focusing its preparation on one
particular team.
"We take every team we play
with the same process, the same
mindset, because anything could
happen on any given day," she
said. "We could be playing a non-
ranked team and they could have
the best game of their life, so we
have to come out ready every sin-
gle game.
"We'll talk about the pitchers *
and what they'll be throwing and
their strengths and weaknesses
(later in the week), but right now,
we're working on fundamentals.
We're focusing on things we need
to improve on."
Michigan will be tested this

weekend, especially when it takes
on Louisville (15-0) in the second
game of the tournament.
The Cardinals return two of
the best pitchers in the Big East:
senior Tori Collins and sopho-
more Caralisa Connell. The duo is
undefeated and combines for an
ERA under 2.00.
But the Wolverines aren't
without star pitching. Wagner
and fellow freshman Sara Dri-
esenga have posted impressive
numbers for such an early point
in their careers and look to be
improving with every game.
Lane is confident in the two
rookies and is excited about their
early, dominating performances.
"They're doing awesome," she
said.
"I think we'll be just fine (with
them this weekend)."

Breakdown: Michigan vs. Gophers

Junior center fielder Patrick Biondi and the Michigan baseball team have started the season with a 6-6 record.
Michigan looks to improve
fundamentals in Louisiana

By STEVEN BRAID
Daily Sports Writer
Michigan baseball coach Rich
Maloney consistently states that
the key to his team's success is
"making the routine play, rou-
tinely."
And if the Wolverines (6-6
overall) are going to find any
success this weekend at the LSU
Tournament, they will need to
get back to fundamentals.
"I don't think that we haven't
played well, we just haven't done
the little things that we need
to do to win," said junior cen-
ter fielder Patrick Biondi. "It's
not like we're not playing well
enough to win, we just need to
capitalize, and hopefully we'll do
that this weekend."
Michigan heads to Baton
Rouge, La. to face No.13 LSU (11-
2) and Notre Dame (5-4) in two
games apiece in front of what
will be a sold-out Alex Box Sta-
dium. Biondi and the rest of the
Wolverines recognize that they
aren't going to get many chances
on offense this weekend, espe-
cially against the Tigers, so they
know that they must do the little
things - something they haven't
done of late.
After starting off the season
by winning five of its first seven
games, Michigan has hit a rough
stretch. Its recent slide can be
traced back to defense and pitch-
ing.
"The less freebies you give
away, the better chance you're
going to have," Maloney said.
"We just have to get back to play-

ing that good, fundamental base-
ball and focus on not giving away
freebies out in the field."
In their last five games, the
Wolverines' defense and pitching
has been less than spectacular.
During that period, the defense
has committed eight of its sea-
son-total 13 errors and the pitch-
ing staff has allowed 30 earned
runs - about six runs per nine
innings. The pitching staff has
also given up late leads in two of
those four losses.
In a 5-3 defeat against Xavier
last Sunday, Michigan allowed
four late runs after holding a
3-1 lead heading into the sev-
enth inning. And in a 9-4 defeat
against Ohio State last Friday,
after getting six-plus innings
of superb pitching from senior
right-hander Brandon Sinnery,
the bullpen allowed three runs
across the seventh and eighth
innings that led to a 4-2 deficit
into the bottom of the eighth
inning. After Michigan's bats tied
the score, the Buckeyes scored
five unearned runs off of two
Wolverine errors and three wild
pitches.
"Most of our losses have come
where the other team has scored
late, so we have to pitch a little
better late in games," Maloney
said.
Though the Wolverines have
struggled in the field, their
offense has hit consistently.
Led by sophomore right fielder
Michael O'Neill and freshman
left fielder Will Drake, Michigan
ranks second in the Big Ten with
81 runs scored. O'Neill ranks first

in the country with 47 total bases
and leads the Big Ten in slugging
percentage (.940), hits (24), RBIs
(16), doubles (8), home runs (5)
and stolen bases (9). Drake, who's
hitting .372, has been a pleas-
ant surprise for Michigan. The
freshman ranks second in the
conference in runs scored (15),
fifth in hits (16) and first in triples
(3) while collecting two Big Ten
Freshman of the Week awards.
The Wolverines will also need
to lean on their excellent base
running to disrupt the opposing
pitching staffs. Led by Biondi
and O'Neill, Michigan ranks first
in the conference- with 28 stolen
bases in 36 attempts.
Though Michigan is not over-
looking the Fighting Irish, their
attention will most likely focus
on LSU. The Wolverines will
have their hands full against the
Tigers. LSU's Mason Katz was
recently named National Player
of the Week and is hitting .477.
He is one of five batters hitting
over .300 for the Tigers.
Michigan's pitchers will need
to try to contain LSU's lineup
because the Wolverines' lineup
will not get many good pitches
to hit against the Tigers. Consid-
ered by Maloney to be elite MLB
prospects, Ryan Eades and Kevin
Gausman headline LSU's pitch-
ing staff, and both sport ERAs
under 2.00.
The Wolverines, though, view
this as a great opportunity and
are just excited to get a chance to
play in front of 11,000 against one
of the better teams in the coun-
try.

Consistency

Maloney drew a flat line
through the air with his hand to
demonstrate the plateau of con-
sistency.
But O'Neill's career would be
better represented as a slope.
He is steadily improving while
remaining reliable at bat, on base
and in the outfield. Time and time
again, he shows dependability.
O'Neill hit home runs in three
consecutive games, starting with
a first-in. C bomb over left field
at Florida Gulf Coast. Then, after
a loss to the Buckeyes, Michi-
gan dominated in a 17-8 win over
Chicago State, where O'Neill
went 3-for-5 with four runs and
four RBIs. Maloney likes to call
it "good fundamental baseball."
And O'Neill continues to impress
Michigan's 10th-year head coach
with every crack of the bat.
Competition, confidence and
consistency are the three char-
acteristics that led O'Neill to be
named the Big Ten Player of the
Week, again.
"Nobody else deserves it but
him," said freshman left fielder
Will Drake. "It's great to see him
succeeding."

son's glare before, but not here.
M ac Bennett had seen Red Beren-
There wasn't a rink in sight.
But at 35,000 feet, the coach
had a lot on his mind.
The Michigan hockey team was fly-
ing to Alaska, in search of its first win
in seven tries. Mired in its longest losing
streak since 1998, the Wolverines were
nothing short of desperate. Their coach,
however, chose not to focus on all of the
negatives surrounding his team, and
instead decided to get to know one of its
defenseman.
He turned to Bennett.
"What are you studying, Mac?"
"I think I'm goingto major in musicol-
ogy," Bennett offered.
Then he caught Berenson's stare.
Bennett's major, outrageously
different from his coach's business
degree, took about 10 seconds for
Berenson to process. And when he
finally did, he didn't mince words.
"What the hell is that?"
Undeterred, Bennett calmly
explained what is possibly the Col-
lege of Literature, Science and the
Arts' most obscure major, hoping to
earn Berenson's respect off the ice as
he had with his play on it.
"I'm still trying to figure (the
degree) out myself," Bennett said
later. "You learn about the history of
music, music theory and all that stuff.
...It's a broad degree of music."
Berenson mulled it over. If hockey
doesn't work out, does this kid have a
plan to fall back on? So he asked one
more question, looking for reassur-
ance.
"Can you make money doing that?"
Bennett promised him that it was,
in fact, possible. Satisfied, Berenson
turned away and the aircraft continued
its cruise against the jet stream into the
great white north.
With the coach's inquisition finally
over, Bennett searched for an escape -
from the white noise of a commercial
plane and the burdens of a mid-season
slump. He reached over for his fix of a
drug that can get him through even the
most difficult weekends. He dove into an
alternate reality that relieves him of the
stress that comes with being a Division
I athlete.

Mac Bennett turned to music.
In a corner of the room - beneath a
collection of papers, pens, candy wrap-
pers and a Nyquil cup - is a desk. Beneath
the rubble sits music-making equipment
valuable enough to break the bank and
powerful enough to fill auditoriums.
Don't call that Rhode Island native
with the NHL pedigree seated at the
desk Mac Bennett.
In that setting, he goes by Beats.0, the
stage name coined by Bennett and former
teammate Scooter Vaughan, who gradu-
ated from Michigan in 2011. ("Probably
the only black guy you'll ever meet who's
I was over at (Scooter
Vaughan's) house one
day and he had all of
his DJ stuff out. Buttons
and wheels and stuff - I
wanted to touch things.
Mac Bennett
into electronic nusic," Bennett said)
Fixated on the Iluminated screens in
front of him, Ben ett's transition from
blue liner to artist is as quick as the trip
from Yost to his homemade studio.
Bennett's bede m, a converted din-
ing room at th use he shares with
teammates Lu lendening, Shawn
Hunwick, Greg ryn, David Wohlberg
and best friend Derek DeBlois, offers vir-
tually no privacy. His bed is separated
from his rambuitious teammates in the
living room by a sliding door that opens
from either side.

At night, the setup can be a nuisance.
Sleep is a precious commodity after log-
ging hours at the rink. But when Bennett
throws his Beats by Dr. Dre headphones
over his ears, it's like he's still thousands
of miles away in Alaska, too far away to
be bothered, too focused to care.
Bennett has no shortage of musi-
cal influences, but Vaughan's has been
the most powerful. As an impression-
able freshman last year, Bennett saw
Vaughan, one of the team's leaders, disc
jockeying at house parties. By about
December of 2010, Bennett decided that
was something he wanted to pursue.
"I was over at (Vaughan's) house one
day and he had all of his (disc jockey)
stuff out," Bennett recalls. "Buttons
and wheels and stuff - I wanted to
touch things."
Under Vaughan's tutelage, Ben-
nett learned the ropes. Like he would
with a Berenson defensive scheme,
he learned quickly. But the sounds he
spun weren't uniquely his - yet.
"And even when you're gone, you're
always right here in my heart. I think
about you all the time so we're never
apart."
Mac looked across the stage at his
then-girlfriend Sarah. With all 600
of The Hotchkiss School's students
waiting intently, he knew this was his
chance.
Mac sat with his heart in his hands
- and a guitar too. His serenade of
Sarah went perfectly. By the time he
was finished, there was hardly a dry
eye in the place among the girls. After
they stopped crying, they rushed
home and downloaded the song, "Blue
Eyes."
If Bennett doesn't look like he has the
least bit of stage fright under the bright
lights of Yost, it's probably because he
had to get over all of that really fast at
boarding school.
Mac's sister, Carly, a college-hockey
prospect herself at Hotchkiss, won't ever
stop hearing about her heartthrob older
brother.
"I cannot tell you the amount of times
girls have come up to me and said 'your
brother's song is so cute,"' Carly said.

Michigan prepares to

ning to keep its com
NCAA Tourna-
ment hopes alive, they practiced
on Thursday as if it were any
other practice. They skated hard
- sprinting between each up-
tempo drill - but they also skated
loose. In between shifts, players
would jokingly fire a slap shot at
the boards to scare a spectator, try
to flip a puck off the mesh netting
under the giant scoreboard, or
laugh and derisively slap sticks on
the ice when a player took a fall.
And though the No. 4 Michigan
hockey team has to like its odds to
secure a No. 1 seed in the NCAA
Tournament, the Wolverines
spoke cautiously about the Fight-
ing Irish. Maybe that's because in
Michigan's best-of-three matchup
with Notre Dame in the second
round of the CCHA playoffs,
Michigan will play a version of
itself.
"It's kind of where we were
(in 2010), where we had to win
to keep playing," said junior for-
ward Chris Brown. "All the pres-
sure just feeds into energy that we
used on the ice just to play well.
And I think having that despera-
tion helped us get to where we
were (in 2010), and we probably
should've went on to the Frozen
Four after that.
"Notre Dame's going to come
out with that same desperation,
and we have to match that."
Or, as Hunwick put it: "A team
with a back against the wall is a
dangerous team."
In 2010, Michigan's worst
start in years put it out of posi-
tion to receive an at-large bid to
the NCAA Tournament. The Wol-
verines needed to win the CCHA
Tournament or they would've
become the first Michigan team
in two decades to miss The Dance.

And Michigan senior guard Car-
men Reynolds broke the program
record for most 3-pointers ina
career on Jan. 30 at Wisconsin
and currently holds the top spot
with 200.
But there is one more.
The Big Ten has never sent
seven teams to the NCAA Tour-
nament, even with the tourna-
ment's expansion to include 64
teams. This year, the conference
has enough depth to send that
seventh team to the Big Dance.
That seventh team would be
Michigan.
Despite a late-season collapse
in which the Wolverines (20-11
overall) lost six of their last nine
games and suffered tough road
losses to Penn State and Wis-
consin, they have put together a
strong resum6 for the selection
committee.
Michigan played a respectable
nonconference schedule this year,
opening up the season with a
road win against a quality Florida
squad. The Wolverines recorded
signature wins against Iowa
State - who is expecting to earn
a sixth-straightberth to the Big
Dance - and Illinois State.
They also won their divi-
sion of the Paradise Jam back in
November, winning three games
in three days, and played then-
No. 6 Maryland down to the wire
in College Park. The Wolverines
r--" ian1-1 n--nnf-- r

record for one of the best starts in
program history.
Then they picked up coveted
win number 20 in the Big Ten
Tournament last weekend.
Michigan's record speaks for
itself.
But if the record isn't enough,
Michigan has an RPI of 45 -
which takes into account the
team's winning percentage, the
opponent's winning percentage
and strength of schedule - and
a strength of schedule of 43, two
of the main factors the selection
committee looks at. Half of the
Big Ten teams have RPIs in the
top 50, and the Wolverines have
the fourth-toughest schedule in
the conference.
But I'm not here to scrutinize
the stats or break down each
game to determine whether or
not Michigan should get a bid.
The Wolverines deserve inclusion
in the field of 64 because of their
success playing through a strong
conference schedule.
The Big Ten has developed
into one of the toughest, grit-
tiest conferences in the nation.
Four of the 12 teams have been
ranked this season, with two
more receiving votes at some
point in the season: the Wolver-
ines garnered votes eight times
this year. And now that the Big
Ten Tournament has played out,
there are multiple teams looking
for postseason bids. The Boiler-
makers received the automatic
qualifying bid for the Big Ten,
and the top three teams - regu-
lar-season champion Penn State,
Ohio State, and Iowa - are locks.
Nebraska, which finished sixth
in the regular season, made a run
to the championship game in the
conference tournament, proving
itself worthy of an at-large bid.
And Michigan State, after start-
ing off 8-6 in nonconference play,
finished 11-5 in the conference
and recorded two wins over Penn
State late in the season. That
should be good enough for aspot

That makes six. So where
does Michigan fall amongthese
teams?
The Wolverines finished sev-
enth in the Big Ten with an 8-8
conference record. It's a mediocre
conference record, but they beat
two top-25 teams in the confer-
ence - home against the Buck-
eyes, handing them their first loss
of the season, and Nebraska on
the road.
They also played it close with
Iowa and Michigan State - a
team with a better record but
worse RPI and strength of sched-
ule than Michigan - and both
the Hawkeyes and Spartans got
hot near the end of the season.
Michigan finished the regular
season with 19 wins, knowing
that a strong showing in the con-
ference tournament would boost
its resume. The Wolverines did
just that. They defeated Illinois in
the first round with the help of an
excellent performance from one
of the conference's best defenses,
but they ended up losing in the
quarterfinals to Ohio State.
Not losing in the first round
of the Big Ten Tournament, not
having anyugly losses in the con-
ference and notplaying poorly in
the nonconference schedule all
help Michigan's case.
But more importantly, the
Wolverines did everything they
needed to in one of the most
physically demandingconfer-
ences in the nation.
And that should be enough.
The Big Ten is one of the deepest
conferences in the country, and
it's about time that the committee
recognizes that good basketball
isn't just played in the Big East
and Atlantic Coast Conference.
I may not be able to influence
the selection committee, nor am I
the next Joe Lunardi - or Charlie
Creme, if you prefer the women's
bracketologist - but from what
I've witnessed over the course of
the season, the Big Ten is power-
ful enough to have seven teams

in the NCAA field. This year, the
Fighting Irish sit at No. 18 in the
pairwise rankings - the rankings
used to determine the 16-team
NCAA Tournament.
"I remember (Michigan's run)
well because that was the year we
were hoping to host the regionals
in Fort Wayne," said Notre Dame
coach Jeff Jackson. "And when we
played Michigan at the end of that
year, I thought they were the best
team we had played all year.
"Certainly, I'd love to be able to
emulate them.... WhenI started at
Notre Dame, one of my goals was
to try to emulate what Michigan
does."
Notre Dame stumbled into the
eighth seed in a deep CCHA field,
and an upset by last-place Bowling
Green over Northern Michigan in
the first round of the playoffs set
up the series with Michigan. It
was a decidedly difficult draw for
both teams.
"I think this is what we've been
waiting for," said Michigan coach
Red Berenson. "This is the kind
of playoff challenge that you're
going to get, whether you get it
now or get it later."
There has been something a
little different in practice this
week. The players and coaches
have tried to maintain a sense of
normalcy, but still, the difference
is there.
Berenson said his players will
feel it before ever stepping onto
the ice on Friday.
Associate Athletic Director
Bruce Madej smiled and told of a
saying Berenson's wife, Joy, has
been known to say: There are

three different Reds. Offseason
Red, in-season Red and playoff
Red.
Well, it's playoff time. And not
just the playoffs - the playoffs
against Notre Dame, no less.
Hunwick said that Yost comes
alive for the playoffs, but it's
always electric for good teams.
Michigan can count on facing
a good team this weekend. Notre
Dame played Michigan as tough
as any team this season in a late-
January series split in South Bend.
During that series, some
Michigan players took excep-
tion to what they perceived as
Notre Dame players running into
Hunwick. After the series finale,
freshman forward Alex Gup-
till called the tactics "dirty." He
backed away from the accusation
this week.
"I think it wasjust a really emo-
tional series," Guptill said. "Obvi-
ously, you go through games like
that, and you're a little bit pissed
after the game."
Jackson said he never wants his
players to bump an opposing goal-
tender, and noted that he pulled
a player from the game during
a series against Miami when he
"took a couple foolish penalties."
The Wolverines aren't try-
ing to change much. Some play-
ers - notably Hunwick - have
their superstitions, but none have
admitted to any special supersti-
tions just for the playoffs.
Except for one, revealed by
senior forward David Wohlberg
on Monday.
The superstition?
"Win games."

BEATS BY MAC
From Page 8
"I don't know how much I like
other girls saying how cute my
brother is, but I do think it was
very brave of him to perform that
song in front of everyone, and I
think any girl would be happy to
have a song like that written about
them."
The gift of music wasn't in Ben-
nett's DNA, so his parents had to
find other ways to give it to him.
Bennett's folks deserve credit
for helping his musical journey,
but it's onlytheir generosity - not
their genes. In fact, Mac can't help
but laugh when asked if his folks
have musical talent.
"Not at all," he smirks.
Luckily for Mac, their gift-giv-
ing abilities far surpass anything
they could do with their voices or
on the guitar.
And when Christmas of their
son's freshman year came and
there was just one thing on his list,
they were happy to oblige.
On his laptop, Mac used to work
with GarageBand - a basic pro-
gramwithlimited capabilities. But
ifhe wanted to get serious with his
music, he needed an upgrade.
"Around Christmas time, I was
looking at equipment and stuff,"
Mac said. "There's this program
called Ableton Live, which I had
done my research on."
There were no surprises under
the Bennett family tree in 2010,
but what was waiting for Mac
allowed him to surpass the learn-
ing curve. Using Ableton Live,
Mac let his passion take over as he
delved deeper into producing. He
began to formulate his own musi-
cal identity.

Mac and DeBlois did every-
thing together growing up. Their
fathers played college hockey
together at Brown and they've
spent all but two years on thesame
team. The two were destined to be
Wolverines together.
DeBlois' earliest memory of the
friendship is him chasing Mac
around the house with a shovel.
But their best memories together
are of the 12-by-16 foot rink on the
Bennett family deck.
That makeshift rink might as
well have been Joe Louis Arena
or Madison Square Garden to the
youngsters. Now, they don't have
to pretend that's where they're
skating.
Mac imagines each of his musi-
cal creations being played over
the sound system at arenas. If he
can't picture it blaring through the
speakers during warm-ups at Yost,
or Joe Louis, where Mac is 6-2 as
a Wolverine, then the song gets
scrapped.
It's not at all uncommon for
him to begin producing a tune but
scratch it before completion. It's
a process that Mac goes through
constantly - ideas for songs hit
him at the most random of times,
but not all of them will come to
fruition.
"If I'm bored, I'll come in here
and put up something and just
start playing notes on a keyboard,"
Mac said, motioning to the syn-
thesizer resting on his desk. "At
the time, I'll think it sounds great.
Then I'll come back to it like two or
three hours later and it's like, 'This
sucks.' I never delete anything. I
just kind of forget about it."
The rare gems that Mac doesn't
tire of - even after listening to

them on loop for sometimes hun-
dreds of times in a row - get
added to his SoundCloud page
(www.soundcloud.com/beats_0).
SoundCloud is an audio distribu-
tion platform for artists like Mac
to promote their work. There, his
music can be downloaded. From
"Give Me Sex" - Mac's coked-

Sunday mornings are the lazi-
est time of the week at the team-
mates'house. On one in particular,
Mac stirs in bed. He smiles - the

league sweep of Miami (Ohio) the
night before, avenging an earlier

If hockey didn't work out, I
think the next coolest thing to do
would be to open up a studio and
kind of do my own thing. That
would be the dream. But hope-
fully hockey works out first.
Mac Bennett

wick was recently introduced to
the Ultimate Fighting Champion-
ship games and finds that to be
a better outlet than getting in a
melee himself like he did earlier
this season.
"Watching Shawn play is so
funny because he gets really into
it," Mac said. "He'll be like grind-
ing on controllers with his teeth
and stuff."
Mac chooses to hobble over to
his home studio, conveniently just
a few paces away.
His two favorite pastimes,
hockey and music, occupy his
weekend. You'd be hard pressed
to find any similarities between
the two. Mac thinks hard and then
shakes his head.
"Complete, polar opposites," he
said.
Then Mac pauses.
"That's why it's awesome."
As Mac's learned, being a Divi-
sion-I athlete istough work. When
he's not at the rink, he wants to be
as far removed from the hockey
world as possible. He emphasizes
the importance of exploring pas-
sions outside of athletics. With-
out a release, the weeks pass by in
a wearied blur. The music helps
Mac escape that lonely road.
"I think you play your best when
you're relaxed and stress free,"
Mac said. "At least for me, this is
a big part of that. You go into the
games and you're gripping your
stick too tight, or you're thinking
too much, you're going to make
mistakes. This ..." he says, gestur-
ing to the wealth of equipment on
his desk, "keeps me levelheaded."
To say the hockey team's music
selection for its post-practice lift-
ing sessions is eccentric would be

an understatement. The speakers
blast Taylor Swift as grown men
move weights. The song changes
- gangster rap.
Finally, one of Mac's mash-ups
begins to play. Pateryn's ears perk
up. He's the biggest fan of Mac's
music amongst the team. He's
usually the first one Mac gives a
finished song.
"I think (the team) has mixed
reactions," Mac said. "I think the
part they dislike the most is that
it's loud."
Regardless of how they feel
about the constant racket coming
from Mac's room, the Wolverines
acceptthatwhathe doesoffthe ice
is every bit a part of him as what he
does on it. They even dubbed him
"Mac Beats," a name that's stuck.
Asforthe future, Bennetthopes
he'll succeed in what brought him
to Michigan in the first place - the
hockey. But all of his eggs aren't in
one basket. And for that, Berenson
is thankful. Too often, he hears
about how former players of his
have turned into "hockey bums,"
or people who never know when
to hang up the skates and move on.
If the Montreal Canadians, who
drafted Mac in 2009 never come
calling, well ... he'll be just fine.
"If hockey didn't work out, I
think the next coolest thing to
do would be to open up a studio
and kind of do my own thing,"
Mac said. "That would be like the
dream."
But it's not what he dreamt
about on that 12-by-16 foot rink on
his back porch. So he reconsiders.
"But hopefully hockey works
out first."
Mac picked up music as an
escape from hockey. But as he's
learned, there's no escaping the
music.

up remix of Rufus Wainwright's
"Instant Pleasure" - to the love-
struck ditty he sang to his girl-
friend on stage at Hotchkiss, his
sound can vary.
Mac prefers to stick to elec-
tronic music, though he's dabbled
in other genres.
Michigan captain Luke Glen-
dening sang over a country song
that Mac wrote.
It doesn't even matter what
kind of music Mac's making. That
he's doing it at all isenough to keep
him sane.

series. Then, as he rolls out of bed,
he winces. Mac's everything hurts
after a physical weekend.
Sundays aren't for hockey.
Everyone on the team takes the
day to rejuvenate, doingtheir own
thing.
"That's what Sundays are there
for," Mac said. "You have a hard
week, you've got practice and
school and stuff so you got a lot of
time put towards that, so on Sun-
days you just kind of want to do
nothing."
