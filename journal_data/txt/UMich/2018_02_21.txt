Dozens filed in and out of 

Seek Refuge’s first clothing 
line launch party held in the 
Michigan League’s Hussey 
Room on Tuesday evening. 
Seek Refuge is an organization, 
founded by Dearborn native 
Shazia Ijaz, committed to 
bringing awareness to aid 
refugees, empower women 
and 
represent 
Muslims 

through its clothing line. The 
organization currently gives 
a portion of its proceeds to a 
refugee aid program and was 
recently featured in Vogue 
magazine.

In its mission statement, 

Seek 
Refuge 
stresses 
the 

need to empower millennial 
Muslim women, and says the 
clothing line combines Islamic 
messages and aesthetics with 
American style to produce a 
forward fashion choice for 
millennial Muslim women.

The 
mission 
statement 

continues 
to 
focus 
on 

how 
Muslim 
women 
are 

misrepresented 
in 
society 

and how “in today’s social 
and 
political 
climate, 
it 

is 
crucial 
to 
accurately 

represent American Muslims 
in society.”

The mission statement was 

echoed at the event, as a video 
played on repeat showing 
President 
Donald 
Trump 

exclaiming, 
“Islam 
hates 

us” and other Islamophobic 

comments made by political 
figures and other figures in 
the media. The sequence was 
then followed by a segment 
with Seek Refuge founder 
Shazia Ijaz, a University of 
Michigan alum, who briefly 
explained 
Seek 
Refuge’s 

message.

Four models sported the 

four clothing pieces currently 

released by Seek Refuge as 
the video, mentioned above, 
played in the background, and 
Ijaz spoke with event guests.

Ijaz 
described 
the 

label 
as,“the 
world’s 
first 

streetwear clothing brand for 
Muslim women.”

“What makes Seek Refuge 

different as a brand is that 
we focus on representing 

Muslim 
women 
through 

our Islamic designs and not 
through enforcing a modesty 
standard,” 
she 
said. 
“We 

design clothes that work for 
Muslim women who practice 
all levels of modesty … And 
our American street style 
combined with our Islamic 
designs allow women who 

Central Student Government 

met on Tuesday evening to 
discuss 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan’s 
decision 
to 
end 

Michigan time, the tradition of 
starting classes 10 minutes after 
the hour. Beginning on May 1, 
classes will start on the hour and 
end 10 minutes before the next to 
allow for students to get to back-
to-back classes. The assembly also 
passed resolutions support the 
demands for more representation 
by Latinx students, and increased 
transparency in the Univeristy’s 
endowment investments. 

The 
assembly 
welcomed 

Dean of Students Laura Blake 

Jones, 
who 
explained 
the 

administration’s 
reasoning 

and answered representatives’ 
questions. 
Jones 
said 
the 

University’s professional schools, 
such as the School of Nursing 
and the Dental School, operate 
on the hour. Classes that run on 
Michigan time cannot use rooms 
in these professional schools 
because of the difference in start 
times.

“Other 
schools 
could 
use 

those classrooms, but they’re 
hindered from being able to do 
that currently because if the 
classes start at 10 after the hour 
and that room needs to be ready 
for transition at 10 until the hour,” 
Jones said. “It’s not possible to 
schedule them as efficiently as we

to the handling of the sexual 
assault 
allegations 
against 

Larry Nassar, a former USA 
Gymnastics doctor and MSU 
sports

doctor, 

according to the State News on 
Tuesday. Just days after these

spoke at Nassar’s trial in 
Ingham County in January, 
where he received 40 to 175 
years for sexual assault. She is

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | FEBRUARY 21, 2018


As students gear up for the Uni-

versity of Michigan’s Central Student 
Government elections on March 21 
and 22, The Daily sat down with ex-
ecutive candidates to talk platforms, 
vision, and plans. In this installment, 
we profile the MomentUM party, 
headlined by presidential candidate 
AJ Ashman and vice presidential 
candidate Charlie Bingham.

Engineering junior AJ Ashman 

said his inspiration to run for CSG 
President comes from three places: 
His mother, those on CSG who have 
come before him and an innate 
sense of obligation to give back to 
others. Furthermore, Ashman em-
phasized the importance of ensur-
ing all students feel welcome at the 
University as he did not always feel 
that way.

“I have tried to spend every day 

on this campus trying to find ways 
to give back, and I hope to continue 
to do so next year as student body 
president,” he said. “To serve and 
help move the ball forward, make 
life at Michigan a little bit easier 
for those who come after me than it 
was for me. I say this because while 
I love the University of Michigan, it 
has not always been easy, I did not 
always feel welcome and I know 
a lot of students have had and are 
having similar experiences. That is 
a terrible feeling that no one should 
have to experience and so my ser-
vice is dedicated to making sure that 
the students here now and those 
that come after me do not feel that 
way, and that if they do their student 
government takes that experience 
seriously and works to improve it.”

Ashman chose to describe his 

leadership style using the words 
“forthright, purpose-driven and 
steadfast.”

In a similar vein, LSA junior 

Charlie Bingham explained how 
the philosophical framework of 
“self-transcendence” fueled his de-
cision to run as vice president on 
Ashman’s campaign. Rather than 
focusing solely on winning, Bing-
ham said he hopes to foster a sense 
of community, raise awareness for 
important issues and create positive 
change on campus to last long after 
his time.

He described his leadership style 

as, “principled, but open-minded.”

“From my time as youth gov-

ernor of Michigan to my current 
term as a CSG representative, there 
has always been a sense of urgency 
for me to involve myself in fight-
ing for the greater good,” he said. 
“Running with AJ aligns with this 
sense of urgency. I believe in this 
campaign because it is more than 
just a campaign; it is a philosophical 
framework, one that says we refuse 
to regress, retreat or even stand still, 
and that we want everyone to keep 
moving forward. Running is about 
more than the competition and the 
quest for winning the most votes; 
it’s about bolstering community, 
creating awareness, enacting posi-
tive changes, and making it easier 
for those who come after you. Run-
ning is an investment in the Uni-
versity, one that, if successful, will 
allow us to leave behind a legacy of 
service and progress.”

Ashman broke his party’s plat-

form down into four major com-
ponents revolving around health, 
academic affairs, student life and 
government relations as these is-
sues affect every student on cam-
pus, and provide a tangible sphere 
in which the party can make ef-
fective changes regarding the way 
students engage with the University 
community.

“The first that comes to mind is 

housing affordability. This is an is-
sue that affects all students, but es-
pecially minority students on our 
campus because Ann Arbor is the 
8th most segregated mid-sized city 
in the country,” he said. “That af-
fects the most basic ways in which 

students engage with this Uni-
versity and the community 
here. In CSG, we have a chance 
to really stand up for students 
on housing and tackle issues 
like zoning and changing the 
height limit for downtown, in-
creasing the waiting period for 
asking tenants to resign, and 
bringing back the Ann Arbor 
Tenants’ Union to provide re-
sources for students involved 
in disputes with their landlord.”

He further discussed the 

importance of making educa-
tion accessible for all students 
through initiatives such as ex-
panding electronic textbook 
use, lowering the prices of 
course packs and pushing pro-
fessors to aid students in secur-
ing the most affordable resourc-
es to succeed.

“The second major initiative 

of ours is on educational afford-
ability, and this obviously spans 
a vast range of issues, but CSG 
can be a real player in discus-
sions about textbook afford-
ability, open-educational re-
sources, an expansion of course 
reserves, more use of electronic 
textbooks and holding faculty 
accountable when it comes to 
federal and University rules 
regarding listing textbooks,” he 
said. “Additionally, we can do 
a lot to help make it easier for 
students to take professional or 
graduate exams, making course 
packs more affordable, gener-
ally giving students access to 
the tools they need to excel at 
this University regardless of in-
come.”

Ashman also called for CSG 

to increase its advocacy of 
strengthening student recruit-
ment programs in order to 
develop a more diverse foun-
dation for future students and 
faculty. He emphasized these 
initiatives are realistic, as long 
as students stand strong in their 
desire to foster lasting change.

“Issues like recruiting fac-

A group of University students 
interrupted quiet studying in 
the Law Library last night in a 
dramatized protest of the death 
sentence of a California man.
 English Prof. William Alex-
ander and San Francisco activist 
Richard Kamler organized the 
event, and the participating stu-
dents were enrolled in Alexan-
der’s University course, “Theater 
and Social Change.”
 The protest was in the form of 
a theatrical piece titled “Sound of 
Lions Roaring,” created by Kam-
ler and first displayed at Alcatraz 
in response to an earlier death 
sentence. Familiar with
Kamler, Alexander wanted to 
bring the work to the University.
 “The idea dates back a couple 
of years, but it finally came to 
fruition this year,” Alexander said.
 At about 9:30 p.m., several 
members of the group in the li-
brary stood on their chairs and 
pointed toward Alexander, who 
portrayed William Bonin. Bonin, 
responsible for the deaths of 14 
young men in California, was 
scheduled to be executed by 

lethal injection at 3:01 a.m. last 
night.
 Alexander, standing in the 
midst of about 125 students in 
the library, began speaking to the 
crowd in the role of Bonin. Dur-
ing his speech, members of the 
group posed around Alexander, 
forming what participants called 
a “hu- man statue.” Flashlights 
were used to enhance visual 
aspects of the performance, and 
sound speakers broadcasted an 
audio tape of roaring lions.
 Kamler said the presentation 
was devised to bring awareness 
to the death penalty. Kamler, 
Alexander and many students 
performing in the piece expressed 
opposition to capital punishment.
 “Basically, I don’t think there 
is ever a need to kill another 
person,” said LSA senior Ben 
McDonough, who worked in the 
formation of the human statue 
surrounding Alexander.
 Many students in the Law Li-
brary stopped studying to watch 
the performance, which lasted for 
more than three minutes. Student 
reaction to the event was mixed.

 LSA first-year student Susanne 
Kalman said she thought the mes-
sage could have been clearer.
 “(The presentation) didn’t re-
ally get the point across,” Kalman 
said. “It didn’t give any feeling of 
why they were against (capital 
punishment).”
 Kinesiology first-year student 
Tomas Filipcik thought a larger 
crowd might have made the 
performance more effective. “I 
think they should have done it in 
a place where there are more peo-
ple,” he said. Both Kalman and 
Filipcik said they were opposed 
to capital punishment.
 Some performers said they 
felt that the crowd was hostile 
to the performance. Performer 
Erin Crowley, an LSA senior, said 
“there was a lot of hostility in the 
room towards the effort and the
cause, but that doesn’t mean that 
we didn’t somehow give it visibil-
ity and recognition, which is what 
we were after.”

On Monday evening, Maia and 

Alex Shibutani— University of 
Michigan alums affectionately 
known as the “Shib Sibs”— won 
a bronze medal in the ice dancing 
competition at the 2018 Winter 
Olympics 
in 
PyeongChang, 

marking the 168th medal won on 
the Olympic stage by a University 
of Michigan Wolverine.

Skating to a Coldplay melody, 

the 
performance 
earned 
the 

pair a score of 192.59, edging out 

Okemos natives and teammates 
Madison Hubbell and Zachary 
Donohue. Hubbell and Donohue 
took a devastating fall during the 
free dance which eliminated their 
podium chances. Both pairs train 
in Canton at the rink where 2014 
gold medalists Charlie White and 
Meryl Davis also trained.

The 
siblings 
were 
the 

first sibling ice dancing pair 
representing the United States to 
earn a medal.

“We had no path to follow,” 

Alex Shibutani told CBS News. 
“There was no blueprint for us. 
(Coach) Marina Zueva had no 
experience with siblings or Asian-

American ice dancers and we had 
to discover by ourselves our own 
path.”

For the Shib Sibs, their bronze 

medal finish marked an important 
milestone in their career that 
began over 14 years ago. After 
growing up on the East Coast, the 
pair moved to Ann Arbor in 2007 
to train in nearby Canton and have 
the opportunity to continue their 
higher education at the University.

Following their 9th place finish 

in 2014 at the Sochi Olympics, the 
pair has gained a loyal following 
that spans beyond the ice dancing 
community. The pair is active on 
social media with over 36,000 

followers on their Instagram 
account, @ShibSibs. They also 
have an active following on 
their YouTube channel where 
they post weekly video blogs 
chronicling their lives as elite 
athletes 
with 
the 
relatable 

nuance of sibling antics and 
morning routines.

In true millennial form, Maia 

Shibutani shared her excitement 
with fans on Twitter following 
the performance, capturing her 
and Alex’s emotion for their 
achievement.

“So proud! No matter what. @

AlexShibutani and I just had the 
best skate of our lives!!!”

In run-up to March elections, party platform calls for housing affordability, campus equity

could.”

Jones noted the University will 

save on classroom construction, 
which 
“dries 
up 
tuition,” 
by 

standardizing start times across all 
campuses.

She also said “interdisciplinary” 

students will benefit from the 
switch. Jones explained under the 
current system, a student taking 
back-to-back LSA and nursing 
courses has no transition time 
between classes.

University 
spokesman 
Rick 

Fitzgerald and Christine Gerdes, 
Special Counsel to the Provost, 
reiterated Jones’ points. Fitzgerald, 
who 
also 
visited 
University 

Council’s 
meeting 
Tuesday 

night, mentioned the importance 
of 
communication, 
saying 
the 

administration 
hopes 
to 
keep 

students up-to-date on the switch 
from Michigan time using Canvas, 
social media, posters and student 
publications.

Multiple representatives raised 

concerns about the University’s 
lack of transparency in making 
the decision to end Michigan time. 
Jones said she had hoped to speak 
with CSG before the news broke.

CSG also hosted Architecture 

students Courtney Klee and Ellis 

Wills-Begley 
of 
the 
Initiative 

for Inclusive Design, a project 
aiming aims to foster dialogue 
about 
building 
accessibility 

issues. According to Wills-Begley, 
architecture often discriminates 
against people with disabilities.

After listening to the guest 

speakers, 
CSG 
moved 
on 
to 

community concerns, executive 
communications, general updates 
and resolutions.

Dental 
student 
Tommy 
Vu 

introduced a reading day resolution 
also authored by by Public Policy 
senior Ben Keller, a senior policy 
advisor. The resolution would 
block professors from scheduling 
tests right before or after a school 
break. Vu said the resolution aims 
to address mental health concerns.

Abby Richburg, a project leader 

for CSG’s Mental Health Task 
Force, updated representatives on 
the motion to establish a Wellness 
Zone on North Campus. Richburg 
reminded the assembly that mental 
health resources are less accessible 
to students on North Campus.

“Fifty percent of students overall 

on campus have been deterred 
from CAPS resources as a result of 
the distance from North Campus,” 
Richburg said.

Richburg noted the project 

is making progress. The Mental 
Health Task Force has been 
gathering student input through 
focus groups.

CSG voted on several resolutions 

Tuesday night, including a proposal 
that would change the University’s 
academic calendar. According to 
CSG Vice President Nadine Jawad, 
the motion would give students 
additional days off on election day 
and around the holidays, but school 
would start before Labor Day.

LSA junior Nicholas Fadanelli, 

LSA student government president, 
also spoke on the matter. He said the 
administration needs to see student 
support for the proposal before 
offering its approval. According 
to surveys, Fadanelli said, many 
students are in favor of the changes 
to the academic calendar.

“Overwhelmingly the students 

say that if they can either get out 
earlier or maintain having certain 
days off they would prefer to start 
before Labor Day,” Fadanelli said.

The 
academic 
calendar 

resolution had already passed 
through University Council, so 
representatives could not propose 
amendments. 
The 
resolution 

passed with 24 in favor and several 
abstensions.

CSG voted on another resolution 

requiring drama students to receive 
consent training. Sierra Stephens, 
School of Music, Theatre & Dance 
representative, said she had updated 
the document with statistics on 
sexual harassment. The resolution 
passed unanimously.

including 
Nassar, 
William 

Strampel, the former dean of 
the College of Osteopathic 
Medicine and MSU athletic 
trainer 
Destiny 
Teachnor-

Hauk and more. The lawsuit 
was filed on Feb. 17 by the 
law 
firms 
Manly, 
Stewart 

& Finaldi in California and 
Drew, Cooper & Anding in 
Grand Rapids.

The 
second 
and 
third 

lawsuits, which were filed 
on Sunday, are represented 
by Louis Corey of the Corey 
Law Firm and were filed on 
behalf of Jane Doe 01 and 
Jane Doe 02, minors who were 
reportedly abused by Nassar. 
These lawsuits both name 
MSU, the Board of Trustees, 
Nassar, MSU Sports Medicine 
Clinic and USA Gymnastics, 
Inc. as defendants.

In a comment in the State 

News, the Corey Law Firm 
said the two cases are seeking 
compensation for the “acts, 
conduct, and omissions” by 
Nassar, MSU and the other 
defendants.

All 
three 
lawsuits 
are 

reportedly requesting a trial 
by jury.

In addition to the recent 

lawsuit 
announcement, 

Noto’s retirement is coming 

on the heels of MSU Trustee 
Brian 
Mosallam’s 
calling 

for Noto to resign from his 
position last month. Mosallam 
tweeted 
demanding 
Noto 

resign and called for “an 
independent review of the 
legal department’s handling 
of the Nassar matter,” after 
a copy of the Title IX report 
filed against Nassar published 
online seemed to implicate 
MSU and Noto in hiding 
details about the case and the 
university’s knowledge of the 
abuse.

In 
the 
wake 
of 
Noto’s 

retirement 
announcement, 

Robert Young, former chief 
justice 
of 
the 
Michigan 

Supreme 
Court, 
has 
been 

named lead counsel by the 
university to coordinate the 
legal team representing the 
university in these recently 
filed lawsuits and the other 
Title IX suits pending against 
MSU.

In the press release, Young 

said he and interim MSU 
President John Engler, who 
took over the position after 
former President Lou Anna 
Simon resigned last month, 
will cooperate with all Title 
IX lawsuits filed against the 
university.

“I am pleased to assist the 

university in addressing its 
multiple challenges,” he said. 
“President Engler has made it 
clear that MSU is cooperating 

fully 
with 
the 
various 

investigations and that will be 
an ongoing priority for me.”

According to the Detroit 

News, 
Young 
is 
also 

representing Gov. Rick Snyder 
in a lawsuit to force Snyder to 
oust current MSU trustees as 
of last week.

Kristine Zayko, a former 

deputy general counsel for the 
university, will temporarily fill 
the position of vice president 
for Legal Affairs effective 
March 5. Zayko will serve in 
the role while the university 
searches 
for 
a 
permanent 

replacement.

In the press release, Noto 

did not mention his specific 
reasons 
for 
leaving 
the 

position but instead heralded 
the university’s values and said 
he hopes the university will 
continue to serve Michigan 
and the country.

“It has been my privilege 

and pleasure to build and lead 
MSU’s legal team, in which I 
have great confidence,” Noto 
said. “I am proud to have 
Kristine Zayko as acting vice 
president for legal affairs and 
general counsel. I am deeply 
committed to the university’s 
land-grant mission and have 
worked with colleagues and 
clients to help MSU serve 
our state and nation. I am 
fortunate to have devoted 
my career to these goals and 
principles.”

nonprofits in tow provide services 
on site of the housing commission 
and the other 75 percent of the 
million dollars would go to the 
Affordable Housing Fund.”

Zachary Ackerman, D-Ward 3, 

highlighted though the housing 
commission has been successful 
with rehabilitating affordable 
housing units, their difficult 
financial position may restrict 
them from continuing to provide 
Section 
8 
housing 
vouchers 

— a primary function of the 
commission.

“Over 
the 
course 
of 
the 

next months, we will better 
understand 
what 
Congress 

intends to do with our Section 8 
program, but it’s looking like cuts 
of at least 10 percent, which looks 
like a real effect on our housing 
commission and our ability to 
provide housing vouchers for 
people to live in our community 
who may not otherwise be able 
to,” Ackerman said.

Ackerman 
emphasized 
the 

commission’s current concern 
to ensure they can support their 
own regulatory costs.

“The result is a very fiscally 

responsible manner, the housing 
commission has looked inward 
about how to keep their house in 
order and has decided to focus 
revenues on ensuring they can 
handle 
their 
administrative 

costs,” Ackerman said.

However, 
Ackerman 
also 

stressed the significant role local 
service providers play in Ann 
Arbor and their reliance on the 
commission’s funds.

“There 
are 
eight 
service 

providers in the community who 
do tremendous good staffing 
after-school 
programs 
and 

support programs at our various 
housing commission properties,” 
Ackerman said. “They may be 
looking to us for support to 
continue those services which 
are absolutely necessary for our 
affordable housing system.”

Ackerman said the legislation 

passed on the mental health 
millage from the past year will 
aid the commission through their 
financial struggle.

“Fortunately, 
during 
the 

Trump 
administration, 
we 

passed a mental health millage 
that will help us carry our 
efforts 
forward,” 
Ackerman 

said. “The Housing and Human 
Services Board will be working 
on a resolution expressing some 
guidance to make sure the 
housing 
commission 
remains 

afloat.”

The Council also voted on an 

ordinance to amend a chapter 
of the city’s zoning ordinance. 
The ordinance passed with eight 
votes in favor and two votes 
opposed.

The ordinance supports the 

efficient use of solar energy 
systems and outlines guidelines 
for their siting, design and 
installation. 
Within 
these 

standards, the ordinance allows 
ground-mounting solar panels on 
the rear or side yards of single-
family homes, but prohibits the 
installation of panels in front 
yards.

Ackerman 
expressed 
his 

support for the ordinance and 
need for clarity in the current 
zoning ordinance.

“I 
think 
that 
accessory 

structures are a blind spot in 
our zoning ordinance when it 
comes to single-family homes,” 
Ackerman said. “They allow for 
21-foot structures to be put in 
place. But for the reasons I’ve 
stated tonight, I will be voting for 
this ordinance as written today.”

However, Ann Arbor resident 

Ernest Figueroa brought up his 
disapproval of the ordinance and 
desire to install solar panels in 
front yards rather than limiting 
homeowners.

“What I can’t understand is 

that our neighbors simply don’t 
like the aesthetics of solar panels 
in front yards,” Figueroa. “It 
appears that it’s the aesthetic of an 
open, green front yard. Working 
with a landscape architect, we 
can put solar installation in the 
front yard. We’re simply trying 
to do what we think is right and 
according to our conscious.”

Yet, Jane Lumm, I-Ward 2, 

emphasized 
the 
community’s 

commitment to the beauty of 
the residential neighborhoods 
and supported the ordinance’s 
limit to only side and rear panel 
installation.

“There’s 
a 
clear 
lesson 

learned here: The aesthetics and 
character of our neighborhood 
is something our residents care 
deeply about and that shouldn’t 
come as a surprise to us,” Lumm 
said. “It’s a major contributor 
to our quality of life. We clearly 
need to engage the community 
and ask them what they think.”

However, Chip Smith, D-Ward 

5, emphasized the city’s need for 
community-level solar to support 
residents who own properties 
unfit for solar panel installations.

“I view climate change as the 

most serious existential threat 
that we face and I think that 
aesthetics 
versus 
presenting 

somebody with no other options, 
the 
opportunity 
to 
create 

renewable energy is a mistake,” 
Smith 
said. 
“Unfortunately, 

we 
have 
DTE, 
it 
has 
not 

communicated a willingness to 
partner with us for community 
solar.”

are millennial Muslims to feel 
like they’re representing their 
religion and their culture at the 
same time.”

When 
discussing 
her 

motivation to start the brand 
and help empower millennial 
Muslim 
women, 
Ijaz 
cited 

today’s Islamophobic climate. 

“We 
focus 
on 
Muslims, 

women and refugees because 
those are three groups that we 
feel have been targeted since 
the 2016 election, for example, 
with 
sexist 
rhetoric, 
with 

the Muslim ban and with the 
decreased number of refugees 
being accepted into the United 
States,” she said. “These are 
things that we are actively 
fighting 
against 
with 
our 

clothes and our brand and our 
voice.”

Each of the four models on 

the platform exhibited one 
of the clothing line’s shirts, 

hoodies or jackets. One of the 
pieces, an ocean blue jean 
jacket, 
sported 
the 
phrase 

“Seek Refuge” and an Arabic 
poem on the back.

Ijaz described the meaning of 

the poem and its representation 
of the refugee experience.

“It’s written by a Syrian 

Refugee,” she said. “It is about 
their journey and about their 
feelings of being displaced from 
their home and forced into a 
country where they don’t feel 
comfortable … But they can’t go 
back to their home.”

LSA senior Nazmun Nahar 

was thrilled when given the 
opportunity to model for the 
clothing brand at the event, 
as she feels the brand gives 
Muslim women a new way to 
express themselves.

“I’m a Muslim woman and 

it does represent me because I 
do wear street style a lot so I’m 
really happy that this is a thing 
now, she said.

LSA junior Adam Bowen was 

fascinated by Seek Refuge’s 
efforts to use fashion as a 

source of activism for refugees.

“I think it’s a really cool 

mission, the idea of working 
the 
fashion 
industry 
into 

activism because it’s something 
that can be really left out,” he 
said. “It’s hard to find a way to 
be progressive with fashion.”

The event was co-sponsored 

by the University’s Muslim 
Students’ Association, the South 
Asian 
Awareness 
Network, 

Humanity First, the Michigan 
Refugee Assistance Program, 
Students Organize for Syria 
at the University of Michigan, 
Michigan Pakistanis, Redefine 
and MPak.

In an interview, Ijaz told 

Vogue she hopes her brand 
ensures Muslim women feel 
empowered 
as 
leaders 
in 

today’s society.

“It’s more important than 

ever for the next generation 
of 
Muslim 
leaders 
to 
feel 

represented in our society and 
to represent our religion as it 
really is: a peaceful one,” she 
said.

for a decrease in ideological 
discussion.

“We are rapidly losing the 

ability to talk to one another,” 
Stephens said. “The president 
has led the way in modeling this 
uncivil style of discourse. But he 
has plenty of imitators on the 
left who are equally as eager 
to bully or shame Republicans 
into shutting up because they 
deem their ideas as backward or 
insufficiently ‘woke.’”

Stephens also belives hateful 

speech falls well within the 
scope of the First Amendment 
and 
sees 
banning 
speakers 

from university campuses as 
only fueling the controversial 
speakers’ movements.

“I think that the worst way 

of dealing with hateful speech 
is to try and shut it down,” 
Stephens said in an interview 
with The Daily prior to his talk. 
“The answer to hate speech is 
more speech. Hateful speakers 
thrive on controversy that some 
universities thoughtlessly afford 
them by trying to ban them. 
Censorship is oxygen to hate 
speech.”

He also commented on the 

impact social media has on 
journalism.

“Am I as a columnist no 

longer allowed to use irony as a 
rhetorical device, because there 
is always a risk that bigots and 
dimwits will take it the wrong 
way?” Stephens said. “Can I rely 
on context to make my point 
here, or must I lie in fear that 
any sentence can be lifted out of 
context and pasted onto Twitter 

and used against me?”

Stephens ended his talk asking 

the audience to make the choice 
to listen to others’ points of view.

“It isn’t, or is not nearly, so 

that we can hear ourselves or 
those who completely agree 
speak,” he said. “It’s also to hear 
other people, with other views, 
have to say. To hear such speech 
may make us uncomfortable, as 
well it should.”

The talk was followed by a 

question and answer session, 
with Stephens taking questions 
from audience members and 
over Twitter. Several students 
from the audience criticized 
his talk as hypocritical and 
questions ranged from critiques 
of Stephens’s op-ed piece on 
Woody Allen to questions about 
the future of the conservatism 
and the political right wing.

“I think part of an intelligent 

pedagogy, particularly at places 
like the University of Michigan, 
is to say, ‘Good, let’s talk about 
your offense,’” Stephens said in 
response to one Twitter question 
about why people are sensitive 
to opposing views. “Let’s take 
it another step further. Let’s 
turn offense into a conversation 
starter and not a conversation 
ender.”

Throughout 
the 
session, 

Stephens 
maintained 

uncomfortable discussion was 
essential 
for 
understanding 

different 
viewpoints, 
and 

emphasized 
accepting 
and 

understanding these viewpoints. 
This 
took 
on 
a 
similar 

perspective to Joshua Johnson’s 
panel last Thursday.

“Discomfort is not injury, and 

intellectual provocation is not a 
physical assault,” Stephens said. 
“To hear speech with which we 
disagree may cause us to wince. 

But with time it can also 
sharpen our thinking, or even 
change our minds.”

After 
the 
talk, 
audience 

members continued to express 
opposing 
opinions 
regarding 

Stephens and the event.

LSA freshman Jason Higdon 

was one audience member who 
was opposed to having Stephens 
give this particular talk on 
campus. 

“He and basically the rest of 

the conservative commentary 
on the Times, on WaPo, on 
any major newspaper, are just 
as bad as the conservative 
establishment that enabled them, 
in a sense,” Higdon said. “I just 
thought it wasn’t good to have 
someone like Bret Stephens here 
to lecture us on the necessity of 
ideological diversity.”

In an earlier interview with 

the Daily, Michigan Mellon 
Fellow 
Austin 
McCoy 
said 

he believes the free speech 
and inclusion series does not 
adequately 
combat 
Spencer’s 

hateful rhetoric.

“It would be better if there 

were 
actual 
conversations 

about the resurgence of white 
supremacists or white nationalist 
politics and what that means for 
political culture, but also having 
a frank conversation about the 
intentions of people like Richard 
Spencer,” McCoy said.

On the other hand, LSA 

senior Ben Decatur felt it was 
important to have a conservative 
speak on campus about Trump. 

“I 
think 
it 
was 
really 

important for students to hear 
on campus a conservative who 
is against Trump,” Decatur said. 
“I think he was incredibly smart 
and hit on important points of 
what conservatives need to do in 
the future in the age of Trump.”

ulty and students of color require 
some level of structural change in 
how we seek out and hire/accept 
candidates,” he said. “It requires 
involving students more in the pro-
cess for both students and faculty. 
CSG has the chance to advocate 
for expansions of cohort-programs 
that help build and foster a sense 
of community and the creation of 
student-led recruitment boards 
that go out into the community 
and across the country recruiting 
students to Michigan. If our ad-
ministration can make headway on 
those issues, we will leave behind 
a solid foundation upon which fu-
ture efforts can be built. And we 
can achieve those things. Those 
things are not beyond us. We just 
have to be bold enough to stand for 
them and, in the face of opposition, 
not be too quick to fold for fear of 
“wasting” political capital, or being 
“iced out” by the University ad-
ministration.”

Furthermore, 
Ashman 
ex-

plained the oftentimes immense 
barriers which prevent students 
from joining campus organizations 
such as CSG.

“There are structural reasons 

why CSG feels inaccessible. An 
example being that CSG meets at 7 
p.m. on a Tuesday,” he said. “Those 
are working hours for many stu-
dents who hold an on-campus 
job. And personally, my involve-
ment in CSG has always required 
a sizable investment of time to do 
the job well, routinely upwards of 
20 hours a week. That is a heavy 
burden to bare if you’re a student 
working to make ends meet. I’ve 
worked a job every day I have been 
on this campus; it’s hard to bal-
ance classes, student government, 
and working. We need to think a 
lot about how to tear down those 
barriers to involvement because 
it’s not just student government 
that has this problem. This leads 
to the Leadership Engagement 
Scholarship, which we call for the 
expansion of as a matter of equity, 
inclusivity and justice.”

Ultimately, 
Ashman 
empha-

sized although the University is 
large, change is tangible by work-

ing with students and amplifying 
their voices through solidarity and 
action.

“Connecting with communities 

that feel underrepresented is about 
finding ways to bring those people 
into the fold, through informal 
or more structural means, so that 
is where you go to recruit lead-
ers from,” he said. “Having those 
leaders helps establish a culture of 
representation from the top-down. 
You have to make people feel as 
though their work is valued and 
the time they are spending on that 
work is justified; they must realize 
they are part of something larger 
than themselves. It is then about 
listening to those underrepresent-
ed communities and, rather than 
just hearing them, showing that we 
are with them. Sometimes, it’s easy 
to feel like Michigan is too large 
to change. Even having worked in 
CSG it is possible to feel that way, 
but students are counting on us to 
take up their causes, to see them, 
to hear them and to stand beside 
them. We know that without be-
ing a part of the conversation, we 
cannot reasonably expect things to 
change.”

MOMENTUM
From Page 2A


E

very time a classroom door 
opens in the middle of a 
class, I momentarily freeze. 

I look toward the door, no longer able 
to hear my professor’s words, only 
coming to a place of relaxation when 
a student or somebody else who’s 
meant to be there meets my eyes.

I’m scared of it being someone 

who has come to shoot my peers 
and me.

This has been true throughout 

my time at college, in all kinds of 
classrooms. Maybe you think this 
is paranoid and stupid. As the child 
of two psychoanalysts, I might try 
to consider this a quirk of mine that 
speaks to some larger insecurity 
relating to some larger truth about 
myself that only a professional can 
solve for me.

Or maybe this is a sign of how 

internalized these shootings have 
become, how automatically the 
shootings are part of our lexicon, 
both with each other and within 
ourselves. My understanding of 
what is conceivable on a moment-to-
moment basis, of what my present 
environment might bring me, feels 
like it has to include these shootings 
because of how often they occur.

I imagine what the implications 

of this automatic acceptance of the 
possibility that this would take place 
would have on younger kids. The 
Sandy Hook shooting, frequently 
cited as the event that introduced 
this modern era of public shootings 
in the U.S. (at schools, concerts and 
movie theaters alike), only happened 
in 2012, when I was 15. I imagine 
what it’s like to be growing up in 
elementary schools around the 
country that are under threat, as 
silence continues to emanate from 
our lawmakers.

I saw an Instagram post from 

Shaun King, the writer and civil 
rights activist. He had taken a 

photograph of travel blogger Tanai 
Benard’s Facebook feed. Benard 
is a mother of a 10-year-old child 
who was explaining the protocol 
his teachers taught him in case an 
“active shooter” came to his school.

The child says, “The teacher is 

supposed to shut and lock the door, 
put the black paper over the window 
on the door. Then myself and three 
other boys are supposed to push the 
table against the door. After that the 
class is going to stand behind us on 
the back wall.”

Shocked that her Black son — 

only one of three Black children in 
a class of 23 students — would be 
asked to stand in front of the whole 
group, Benard asks him, “Why did 
you get picked to stand in front of 
everyone else if a shooter came to 
your school?” And the child answers: 
“I didn’t get picked. I volunteered 
to push the table and protect my 
friends.” Benard asks him why. And 
he says, “If it came down to it I would 
rather be the one that died protecting 
my friends than have an entire class 
die and I be the only one that lived.”

Benard’s 
10-year-old 
child 

goes to school with a life-or-death 
mindset, willing to sacrifice his body 
for his classmates. This is simply part 
of the process of going to school, even 
from such an early age as 10.

This question of gun control, 

then, is not about anything besides 
these children. This is not about 
preserving the cultural tradition 
of the Second Amendment — that 
is an argument that deals with the 
connotations of the debate rather 
than the debate itself. This is not 
about mental health, either — of 
course, people who kill others en 
masse are mentally deranged. Every 
single country in the world has these 
people. But only the United States 
arms them. Last year, President 
Donald Trump signed a bill revoking 

gun checks for mentally ill people.

No. There are two sides in 

this debate: the National Rifle 
Association and the government 
that it funds versus these children in 
American schools. How we respond 
to this set of questions will impact 
not only the future students to die at 
the hands of one of these attacks, but 
also those who survive; left to learn 
in an environment of danger and 
potentially grave sacrifice. Students 
have been forced to understand 
themselves and their peers as 
competitors, not collaborators. They 
become tactical pieces in an effort 
to save their own lives, using time in 
school to push tables against walls 
and hide.

Hide. Go to school and 

learn to hide. Is there no more 
backward lesson to teach our 
children than that? Elementary 
schools and high schools alike 
ought to be a place where 
students 
flourish 
and 
find 

themselves in their passions, 
their friendships, where they 
can freely and safely navigate the 
pressures and contradictions and 
messy developments of life.

I do not know the implications 

of 
this 
kind 
of 
fear-based 

education. I don’t think any of 
us can until some time further 
down the line. But I do know that 
in my own life, my most fruitful 
educational 
experiences, 
in 

and outside of classrooms, have 
occurred when I have felt least 
strongly a need to hide. Instead, 
they have come when I have 
been able to come out and speak 
in such a way that my voice and 
my story gets developed, where 
there’s a free and open exchange 
of ideas across differences.

#RespecttheLecs

T

his evening, the University 
of Michigan’s Department 
of History is sponsoring 

“Disrupting 
White 
Supremacy,” 

a teach-in on the global history of 
white supremacy, from 5 p.m. to 
9 p.m. in Mendelssohn Theatre in 
the Michigan League. The teach-
in’s mission reads in part: “White 
supremacy uses history to fuel its 
fictions. Its promulgators anchor 
their vision of a racist future in 
mythical depictions of the past. But 
the past is not the place that white 
supremacists imagine it to be. We 
must reclaim and retell the global 
history of race.” Or to put it another 
way, Richard Spencer is largely 
beside the point. 

Yes, Spencer and his followers in 

the “alt-right” constitute a dangerous 
force in American society. As we saw 
last summer in Charlottesville, Va., 
they are a real and present danger 
to Black and brown people and all 
who stand up for racial equality 
and justice. His simplistic and 
hateful message of white identity 
politics and ethnic cleansing is 
easy to identify and oppose. But the 
true challenge is to root out white 
supremacy in the very institutions 
we inhabit every day.

When the controversy over 

Spencer’s request to speak at 
the University of Michigan first 
emerged, I worried it would distract 
the University community from 
essential discussions of what it 
will take to build a racially-just 
university. In one sense, I was right. 
For months now, students, faculty 
and 
community 
activists 
have 

devoted countless hours to building 
coalitions and debating strategic 
options for confronting Spencer’s 
white supremacy and hate speech. 
But far from distracting activists 
from the imperative to work for 
racial justice on campus and in 
the local community, these efforts 
have produced a renewed sense of 
solidarity and commitment within 
the anti-racist community. Activists 
have organized a series of principled, 
creative protests and educational 
initiatives that have not only voiced 
their outrage against the resurgence 
of white supremacist hate but 
also served to remind us all of the 
continual need to work for racial 
justice. This is the message that 
tonight’s teach-in seeks to reinforce: 
that white supremacy is more than a 
project of a few extremists on the far 
right, that ideologies and practices 
of racial superiority have been a 
driving force in constructing the 
radical disparities in health, wealth 
and opportunity that characterize 

the modern world, and that in order 
to win local struggles for racial 
equity and justice we must grapple 
with the long, global history of racial 
domination and exploitation.

As the saying goes, if you are not 

outraged, you have not been paying 
attention. But outrage is not enough. 
It will take much more than outrage 
if we are going to systematically 
address 
the 
structural 
forces 

that continue to leave Black and 
brown people excluded from and 
marginalized within the University 
community.

Take, for example, the issue 

of African-American, Latinx and 
Native American enrollment at the 
University. For its first 150 years, the 
University was virtually an all-white 
institution. While Michigan was not 
legally segregated like its southern 
counterparts, 
the 
University 

operated within a cultural milieu 
that assumed that all but a very 
small handful of people of color 
lacked the intellectual capacity to 
attend the University. Before 1970, 
as educational historian James 
Anderson has put it, Michigan 
“engaged in racially discriminatory 
and exclusionary practices that 
earned it a reputation as an institution 
for White students.” In fact, for most 
of its history, the University did not 
even keep track of the number of 
students of color enrolled. Only now 
has the Bentley Library undertaken 
a project to identify and document 
all the African Americans who 
attended the University in the years 
before the civil rights movement. As 
of last April, the library’s researchers 
had identified 1,700 Black students 
for the 117 years between 1853 
and 1970. As late as 1966, the 
University estimated the Black 
student population to have been 
about 400 students, or 1.2 percent 
of that year’s total enrollment of 
32,500 undergraduate and graduate 
students.

The movement to demand 

racial equity in U-M student 
enrollment began with the “Black 
Action Movement” in 1970, which 
demanded the University achieve 
10 percent Black enrollment by 
1973. The story of the three “Black 
Action Movements” and the rise 
and fall of affirmative action at the 
University is too long and involved 
for this article. What we can say 
is that student activism led to the 
establishment of the Michigan 
Mandate in 1988 and a new set of 
admissions policies that raised black 
undergraduate enrollment to a peak 
of 2,101 students (9.2 percent) in 1997 
and 
underrepresented 
minority 

enrollment 
(African-American, 

Native 
American, 
and 
Latinx 

students) to a peak of 3,297 (14.5 
percent) in that same year. But these 
were short-lived gains. Following 
the 2006 passage of Proposition 2, 
the referendum that banned the 
use of racial preferences in college 
admissions in Michigan, the number 
of Black undergraduates fell to 1,166 
or 4.6 percent of total enrollment 
and 
underrepresented 
minority 

enrollment to 2,822 (10.7 percent) 
in 2014. Once again it took student 
activism, this time in in the form of 
the #BBUM (Being Black at U-M) 
movement, to push the University 
administration to prioritize diversity 
in undergraduate enrollment. Four 
years later, overall underrepresented 
minority undergraduate enrollment 
has increased to 12.8 percent. 
However, Black student enrollment 
remains stuck at 4.57 percent, ten 
percentage points below the state’s 
Black population. 

The 
cultural 
biases 
and 

structural barriers that excluded 
African 
Americans 
from 
the 

University during its first 150 years 
continue to shape Black and brown 
educational opportunity in the state 
and at the University as it enters 
its third century. It is one thing to 
oppose the Richard Spencers of the 
world. But unless we are willing to 
insist that the University take action 
to admit a student body that reflects 
our state and nation’s diversity, we 
will have done little to dismantle 
the white supremacist practices that 
pervade daily life on campus. 

Nor is diversity enough. We 

must also address the often-
overlooked 
structures 
and 

practices that undergird the 
sense that students and faculty 
of color are more interlopers 
than valued members of the 
community. This will be hard 
work as it involves attitudes and 
expectations as much as formal 
rules and procedures. At this 
point, the University’s Diversity, 
Equity and Inclusion plan seems 
more focused on process, long-
term goals and feel-good visions 
than on benchmarks and tangible 
steps. Plans are important but 
what we need is accountability, 
from the University, from its 
academic programs and from 
every member of the campus 
community. 

Disrupting White Supremacy

Hiding from our lives

Professor Matthew Countryman is 

an Associate Professor of History and 

American Culture in the College of LSA

M

y 
friends 
always 

complain that I know 
my teachers by first 

name. They scoff when 
I wave to my Spanish 
instructor in the hall. 
They complain about 
their own professors, 
nameless bodies who 
occupy a lecture hall 
for an hour and then 
disappear into space, 
their purpose fulfilled.

As 
a 
student 
in 

the 
University 
of 

Michigan’s Residential 
College, I have the advantage 
of creating close relationships 
with my teachers: Class sizes are 
smaller, meaning more one-on-
one interaction. Additionally, RC 
faculty plans an overwhelming 
number 
of 
extracurricular 

events to help students, such 
as language lunch tables and 
community engagement classes. 
In other words, they go above 
and beyond.

It 
wasn’t 
until 
halfway 

through 
my 
first 
semester 

that one of those above-and-
beyond 
mentors, 
Katherine 

Mendeloff, 
my 
first-year 

writing requirement instructor, 
mentioned 
the 
Lecturers’ 

Employee Organization to my 
class. She described how the 
majority of RC faculty do not 
serve as tenured staff, but as 
non-tenure track faculty called 
lecturers. I thought about my 
own instructors, and how every 
one of my passionate, dedicated 
and knowledgeable teachers has 
been a lecturer. As I researched 
more into the labor union, and 
the work they do, I became 
increasingly irritated. How could 
the University disrespect such a 
large, impactful and necessary 
population of their staff, one 
that had eased and enhanced my 
transition to college?

LEO is a labor union of 

lecturers on all three University 
of 
Michigan 
campuses. 
As 

stated previously, lecturers are 
non-tenure track instructional 
faculty; this means that, unlike 
their tenured colleagues, they 
don’t possess guaranteed job 
stability, decent wages or other 
benefits. For example, whereas 
the 
average 
University 
full 

professor makes about $149,000 
per academic year, the minimum 
salary for a full-time Lecturer 
is about $35,000 in Ann Arbor, 
$28,000 in Dearborn and $27,000 
in Flint. This translates to a $15 
per hour pay, which is below a 
living wage for a single parent 
with children, or a two-parent 

household with more than one 
child. Many of these struggling 
lecturers turn to other part-

time occupations, 
such 
as 
driving 

for Uber or other 
jobs that add to 
their 
workweek. 

Additionally, 
lecturers 
are 

benefits-
insecure; due to 
administration 
policies, 
part-

time 
lecturers 

cannot 
obtain 

consistent health care coverage. 
This inequality has pushed LEO 
lecturers to fight for an improved 
contract for years.

These 
are 
not 
greedy, 

unsupported demands. As I 
described, my own experience 
has proven lecturers are qualified 
instructors 
who 
go 
beyond 

what is expected to create a 
stimulating 
and 
constructive 

learning 
environment. 
Each 

coffee hour I attended for 
Spanish was organized, helpful 
and fun. Every extracurricular 
event I visited brought me closer 
to 
my 
teachers, 
classmates 

and coursework. In addition, 
there 
is 
statistical 
evidence 

that lecturers are a crucial 
force in our University; they 
generate a massive surplus of 
tuition revenue. In the 2016-
2017 academic year, lecturers 
induced a $377 million surplus 
tuition, and yet only 4 percent of 
this contribution was diverted 
to lecturer pay and benefits. 
Many argue that the reason 
for this is that the University 
cannot afford to raise lecturer 
salary without raising student 
tuition. This is false and simply 
an excuse, as last academic 
year, the University generated 
$513 million in unrestricted 
excess cash flow. This reflects 
how the University can afford 
to better pay lecturers. Our 
administration 
just 
chooses 

not to.

Due 
to 
this 
constant 

exploitation, 
this 
year, 
the 

fight for respect swelled. LEO 
lecturers began bargaining with 
University administration for 
a new contract to secure fair 
and consistent rights. Members 
are 
pushing 
for 
increased 

wages, reliable health care, 
job security, recognition for 
inclusive teaching and improved 
disability accommodations. In a 
meeting on Feb. 12, University 
administration 
finally 

introduced a counterproposal — 
one that served as a slap in the 

face. The University responded 
with an offer of a $1,000 starting 
salary 
increase; 
this 
solely 

demonstrates that the University 
wants to move on, not actually 
solve a problem. $1,000 is not a 
sufficient raise by any measure; 
even with this increase, lecturers 
will struggle and suffer.

If this injustice does not 

morally motivate change within 
the student body, we should note 
that it does affect us as students 
as well. Student tuition is already 
very substantial and creeping 
higher and higher. Why isn’t 
our money being invested back 
into our education? Lecturers 
often teach introductory or 
undergraduate 
courses, 
so 

their motivation, attention and 
dedication are important to 
our development in academia. 
If a lecturer has to split time 
between teaching and driving 
Uber, they obviously cannot 
give their 100 percent in 
the 
classroom. 
Therefore, 

everyone 
suffers 
and 
the 

highly paid administration 
turns a blind eye.

This is a difficult and often 

hidden fight. Many students 
don’t know about the struggles 
their 
own 
teachers 
face. 

Therefore, my call to action is 
advocacy and presence. The 
University 
cannot 
function 

without lecturers — they teach 
a third of student credit hours 
in Ann Arbor — and we cannot 
receive 
a 
good 
education 

without them. I urge my peers 
to sport a #RespectTheLecs 
pin, attend Board of Regents 
meetings and create discourse 
among our student body. Any 
noise can be impactful in 
showing support for lecturers. 
It is easy to overlook your first 
teachers in college, or to take 
crucial 
introductory 
classes 

for granted. However, these 
teachers, who often fly under 
the radar in their importance, 
cannot be pushed aside in 
their vitality. We do need to 
#RespectTheLecs, but we also 
need to be active in our fight for 
them.

Maybe the strangest thing 

to come out of the rise of the 
television antihero was the 
writers’ room assumption that 
if viewers could root for the 
flawed and morally ambiguous 
— the Don Drapers and Tony 
Sopranos — surely we would 
find it in ourselves to extend 
that empathy to the downright 
insufferable.

Sometimes, if executed well, 

we actually might; “Girls” and 
“You’re the Worst” come to 
mind. But that’s not the case 
with “Here and Now,” a new 
HBO series from Alan Ball 
(“Six Feet Under”) that feels 
simultaneously 
overstuffed 

and empty, all while serving up 
perhaps the most unpleasant 
bunch of characters in recent 
TV history.

At the center of the show 

is the Portland-based Bayer-
Boatwright 
family, 
led 
by 

matriarch 
Audrey 
(Holly 

Hunter, 
“The 
Big 
Sick”) 

— 
a 
conflict 
resolution 

specialist 
and 
director 
of 

one-woman 
nonprofit 
The 

Empathy Initiative — and her 
husband Greg (Tim Robbins, 
“The Brink”), a washed-up 
philosophy professor.

The 
couple 
has 
three 

grown, adopted children, each 
varying degrees of unlikable: 
Vietnamese 
Duc 
(Raymond 

Lee, “Mozart in the Jungle”), a 
“motivational architect” whose 
job appears to involve little 
more than barking meaningless 
platitudes at his Instagram 
followers while being paid 
an infuriatingly large sum of 
money for it; Liberian Ashley 
(Jerrika 
Hinton, 
“Grey’s 

Anatomy”), the owner of an 
online fashion boutique; and 
Colombian 
Ramon 
(Daniel 

Zovatto, “Fear the Walking 

Dead”), a video game designer. 
The 
Bayer-Boatwrights 
also 

have a biological daughter, the 
whiny 17-year-old Kristen, who 
unconvincingly maintains her 
contentment being “the boring 
white chick in the family.”

For 
Greg 
and 
Audrey, 

Berkeley alums who met at 
a protest for disarmament, 
this multiracial family is the 
living embodiment of their 
progressive dream for America. 
But things are different now. 

Donald Trump won the election. 
The 
truth 
doesn’t 
matter 

anymore. White supremacy is 
on the rise. And even Portland 
— the self-styled progressive 
utopia — isn’t safe from any 
of this. “We lost, folks,” says 
Greg, at his birthday dinner in 
the first episode. “I look back 
on this great experiment that 
is our family and I wonder, I 
really do wonder, did any of it 
make any difference?”

And so the show finds itself 

very much in the here and now, 
keenly aware of its place in 
the Trump era. But instead of 
capturing the mood of America, 
Ball’s answer to this peculiar 
time is a bizarre, whirlwind 
tour through every hot-button 
issue imaginable, never quite 
stopping to give any of them 
the time or depth they deserve. 
Each character throws around 
buzzwords 
(“genderqueer,” 

“slutshaming”) 
with 
the 

avidity and preachiness of a 
college freshman home for 
Thanksgiving break, recently 
mindblown by the first two 
months 
of 
Introduction 
to 

Sociology and simply dying 
to tell you all about it. There’s 
plenty of talking about plenty 
of different things — abortion, 
policing, gender identity, white 
pride, religion and political 
correctness — but for all that 
talking, it’s remarkable how 
little is actually said.

As if that weren’t enough 

material, there’s also a hint of 
the supernatural — Ramon, 
the 
golden 
child 
of 
the 

family, 
begins 
experiencing 

hallucinations, and the number 
11:11 seems to be haunting him. 
It’s in this storyline that the 
show begins to find its real 
narrative and emotional core, 
which lies not in any of the 
Bayer-Boatwrights, but with 
Dr. Farid Shokrani (an excellent 
Peter 
Macdissi, 
“Six 
Feet 

Under”), Ramon’s psychiatrist.

At home with Dr. Shokrani, 

his 
wife 
Layla 
(Necar 

Zadegan, “Girlfriends’ Guide 
to Divorce”) and his son Navid 
(Marwan Salama, “American 
Crime”) is where we finally get 
characters worth caring about. 
Like the Bayer-Boatwrights, 
the Shokranis have problems of 
their own; they disagree about 
how to practice their Muslim 
faith and worry that Navid’s 
gender fluidity will put him in 
danger. But unlike the Bayer-
Boatwrights, 
they 
actually 

come across as real people, not 
television characters.

And that’s the fundamental 

problem with “Here and Now.” 
It’s so obvious what Ball is 
trying to do here that nearly 
every scene, every miserable 
character, 
every 
piece 
of 

dialogue 
seems 
inauthentic, 

carefully 
constructed 
to 

get 
some 
heavy-handed 

message across. The result is 
a disingenuous, self-involved 
rumination on upper middle 
class 
ennui 
that 
doesn’t 

accomplish any of the things 
it’s clearly trying to.

‘Here and Now’ is a great
experiment gone wrong

MUSIC ALBUM REVIEW

 The intrigue of Beach 
House, composed of Baltimore 
duo Victoria Legrand and 
Alex Scally, stems from their 
minimalism. Albums seemed 
to be endless, largely unbroken 
by variation or complexity. 
Within the empty stretches of 
Depression Cherry’s “Days of 
Candy” or Bloom’s “Lazuli,” 
the mind wandered, filling in 
gaps with daydreams. Beach 
House was the music to bring 
on long plane rides. Suspended 
in air, their lethargic pull dis-
solved time, holding every 
second spellbound — forever 
immortalized in the amber of 
repetitive melodies and even-
toned vocals.
 Beach House’s newest 
single “Lemon Glow” builds 

off of the band’s trademark 
creeping sensuality, but sharp-
ens it. The hazy smudge that 
their past discography left 
behind becomes more defined 

with every layered component. 
“When you turn the lights 
down low / Lemon color, 
honey glow,” Legrand sings, 
and the tempo pulses under-
neath, unwavering. Organ 
meshes with keyboard meshes 
with electronic abstraction 
until the song itself vibrates 
with tension — the final build 

into “Candy-colored mystery 
/ The color of your mind” is a 
dramatic cacophony. There’s 
an abrasiveness here that isn’t 
normally heard with Beach 
House. Vocals are harsher, 
brought into focus through the 
jarring kick of an unwavering 
synth line. Somewhere, almost 
lost in the dissonance, a bass 
drum races on. 
 “Lemon Glow” is constantly 
in motion and hopefully this 
is indicative of a new direc-
tion for Beach House, a 
much-needed change after 
the dreary trudge of their last 
full album, 2015’s Thank Your 
Lucky Stars.

History 
was 
made 
this 

past Saturday night at Hill 
Auditorium. 
The 
University 

Musical Society and the School 
of Music, Theatre & Dance 
presented the new, scholarly 
performing edition of the score 
of the Gershwins’ “Porgy and 
Bess” in a concert style. The 
original Gershwin score was 
edited and refined by Wayne 
Shirley from the University’s 
Gershwin 
Initiative, 
which 

aims 
to 
create 
scholarly 

versions of the Gershwins’ 
works.

A standing ovation at the 

end of the four-hour long 
performance and the multiple 
applauses that exploded from 
the audience in the middle of 
acts attest to the incredible 
vocal and performing skill of 
the entire cast. “Porgy and 
Bess” is a work that deals 
with heavy topics, such as 
drug abuse, sexual abuse and 
racism, 
in 
a 
controversial 

way. The opera was not only 
vocally exhaustive — singing 
for four hours is no small feat 
— the content of the opera 
inevitably makes it emotionally 
exhaustive, as well. Soprano 
Karen Slack, who was the 
role of Serena, gave a notably 
heartbreaking 
performance 

of “My Man’s Gone Now.” 
Her 
powerful 
voice 
and 

expressiveness sent a wave of 
anguish over the audience. As 
Slack sang about the heart-
wrenching grief of a widow, I 
found my own heart aching and 
paining for Serena’s loss of her 
husband.

Tenor 
Chauncey 
Parker 

gave 
a 
lively 
performance 

playing Sportin’ Life, a dope 
dealer. Parker fully embodied 
this 
deceivingly 
charming 

character in both voice and 
movement. One of his most 
memorable 
moments 
was 

his performance of “It Ain’t 
Necessarily So,” where Parker 
masterfully inflected his voice 
to embellish the already jazzy 
and bluesy music, and danced 
to 
the 
more 
light-hearted 

jazz melody. His fun energy 
emanated 
from 
the 
stage, 

giving the audience a rest 
from the heavy emotions that 
are constantly hammered at 
throughout the entire opera. 
Parker 
used 
the 
character 

to charm the audience as he 
charms most of the rest of 
the characters in “Porgy.” It’s 

a genius way to approach a 
character that is supposed to 
represent a malicious force in 
the community.

The 
chorus, 
under 
the 

direction of Jerry Blackstone 
and Willis C. Patterson, played 
an interesting role in the 
scheme of events of the opera. 
They provided many functions 
in 
this 
performance, 
such 

as commentators, narrators, 

scene setters or informants 
interacting with the lead roles. 
They produced a beautiful, 
well-blended 
sound 
and 

partook in the emotions that all 
of the main roles were feeling. 
The chorus was flexible and 
effectively acted in whatever 
role they were in at the time 
— not just singing words from 
a 
page, 
but 
understanding 

the significance of the words 
they were singing and finding 
their own individual meanings 
behind the words. Whenever 
they chimed in on the action of 
Porgy and Bess, it was always 
a memorable and powerful 
moment.

The singing was exquisite. 

Morris Robinson (who played 
Porgy) had a bass voice that 
bellowed 
every 
time 
he 

opened his mouth, sending 
dark, rich tones sweeping over 
the audience. His bombastic 

grumbles vibrated the walls of 
Hill Auditorium, a beautiful 
contrast with the smooth and 
floaty tones that soprano Talise 
Trevigne, who played Bess, 
produced. 
Trevigne’s 
voice 

was enchanting to listen to 
and complimented her graceful 
stage presence.

All of the title roles displayed 

great 
attention 
to 
vocal 

technique, 
which 
produced 

powerful and alluring sounds. 
Still, at times, I wished that 
the performers would have 
paid more attention to detail 
when it came to physically 
embodying their characters. 
The performance was given 
in a concert style, giving room 
for the performers to not 
only showcase their beautiful 
voices, but to fill the stage 
completely 
with 
the 
raw 

emotion that the opera lends 
itself to. When characters were 
alone on stage in order to sing 
their arias, it seemed more 
natural and easier for them to 
express the emotions of their 
characters in a convincing and 
natural way.

However, when more than 

one performer was on stage, 
the body language of the 
characters seemed to change. 
I wished that the performers 
would have gone further in 
establishing their relationships 
by making more eye contact 
and 
interacting 
with 
each 

other in a non-superficial way. 
“Porgy and Bess” is a work 
that should leave the audience 
in tears from the pain, in a 
cloud of bittersweetness. This 
performance 
did 
not 
have 

that effect on me, despite 
the 
beautiful 
voices 
and 

orchestration.

The University Orchestra, 

under 
the 
direction 
of 

Kenneth 
Kiesler, 
gave 
a 

stellar performance. I really 
enjoyed hearing the bluesy 
and 
jazzy 
tones 
coming 

from the orchestra — it gave 
a very cool dynamic to the 
show. 
The 
instrumentalists 

displayed such stamina and 
professionality 
— 
playing 

together for four hours straight 
and not seeming the least bit 
exhausted by the end of the 
show.

Time flew by watching this 

spectacular 
performance 
of 

“Porgy and Bess” and listening 
to the premiere of the new 
scholarly 
performing 
score 

edited by Wayne Shirley. It was 
an incredible experience to see 
a piece of history form before 
my own eyes.

BOOKS

No one is proud of reading 

self-help 
books. 
I’m 
not 

referring to the pop-science 
books about harnessing your 
brain power, or the Malcolm 
Gladwell-type stuff that tells 
you how to beat the odds. I 
mean real self-help: I’m talking 
“Chicken Soup for the Teenage 
Soul.”

I’m sure most people aged 15 

to 25 have stumbled across (or 
been gifted) “Chicken Soup for 
the Teenage Soul.” It’s a self-
help book (of sorts) made up of 
a series of personal narratives 
written by teenagers about love, 
friendship, school and family. 
In a bizarre turn, I recently 
found out that the publishers 
of that book also created a 
number of ridiculously specific 
variations: “Chicken Soup for 

the Cat and Dog Lover’s Soul,” 
“Chicken Soup for the Mother 
of 
Preschooler’s 
Soul” 
and 

“Chicken Soup for the Latter-
day Saint Soul.” My personal 
favorite title is “Chicken Soup 
for the Woman Golfer’s Soul.”

Why is it so easy to make 

fun of these books? Maybe 
because the first-person stories 
are so eager, so simple, naive 
and nice. A review by Will 
Friedle of “Boy Meets World” 
(how very ‘90s) on the first 
page of “Chicken Soup for the 
Teenage Soul” commends the 
very concept of the book: “The 
idea of teenagers writing about 
their experiences to help other 
teenagers is brilliant.”

Is it? The advice my mom 

gave me in high school and 
middle school was a lot better 
(in retrospect) than whatever 
convoluted solutions my friends 
came up with. I don’t think the 
power of this book is that the 

content is really helpful in any 
tangible way, although I guess 
it’s comforting to know that 
everyone else is heartbroken and 
pimply, too. Instead, it’s that it’s 
entertaining. This book is like 
all the gossip that went around 
your middle school, written 
up and condensed. There’s a 
disappointing first kiss, a young 
romance cut short by a cross-
country move and many, many, 
many stories of unrequited love.

Rereading “Chicken Soup,” I 

was surprised by how deeply I 
was drawn into the narratives. 
The intensity of their emotions 
is somehow both ridiculous and 
poignant. I’m not much older 
than the contributing authors, 
and I vividly remember how hard 
it is to be 15 — everything is the 
end of the world.

A few days ago on his blog 

“Not a Blog,” George R.R. 
Martin wrote to a commenter 
that “Fire and Blood” will be 
the next book he publishes. 
“Fire and Blood” is to be a 
history 
of 
the 
Targaryen 

family, who are the central 
dragon riders of Martin’s “A 
Song of Ice and Fire” novels 
and feature prominently in 
the immensely popular HBO 
series 
“Game 
of 
Thrones.” 

For fans of the book series, 
though, this was not cause for 
celebration. Beginning in 1996 
with “A Game of Thrones,” 
for over 20 years Martin has 
strung readers along with the 
promise of a conclusion to 
his expansive saga, a journey 
that has become all the more 
agonizing in the past decade 
with the emergence of “Game 
of Thrones” as a pop culture TV 
phenomenon. The fifth volume 
“A Dance With Dragons” was 
published in 2011, the same year 
the TV series began. Since then, 
Martin’s readers have waited 
patiently for the sixth book in 
the planned seven-book series. 
Readers have openly wondered 
whether Martin, at the age of 
69, writing a book every six to 
eight years, will die before he 
reaches the end. Many have 
criticized 
these 
demanding 

readers for acting as though 
Martin owes them something. 
In my eyes, he absolutely does.

When you begin telling a 

story, you sign a social contract 
with the people listening. You 
agree to an unspoken rule that 
you will tell them how the story 
ends. The only way you can 
escape from this agreement is 
if something external happens 
that makes it impossible for you 
to continue the story. A TV show 
being canceled, for example. 
No such situation exists for 
Martin. It does not matter how 
long it takes him to write. He 
has had time to write “Game 
of Thrones” spin-off books, so 
surely he has had time to write 
the main saga. Fans don’t want 
the history of the Targaryens, 
or at least, they don’t want it 
as much as they want the next 
book in the series. If Martin is 
simply no longer interested in 
finishing the story, he should 
just come out and say so. Better 
to announce that the series will 
never be concluded than to 
continue stringing his devoted 
readers along for years on end.

It is becoming increasingly 

likely that in the time between 
Martin publishing “A Dance 
With 
Dragons” 
and 
the 

forthcoming “The Winds of 
Winter,” HBO will have told the 
entire story in eight seasons of 
“Game of Thrones.” Certainly, 
no one could have predicted 
when the show started how 
popular it would become and 
certainly no one could have 
predicted that by the time 
the show ended Martin still 
wouldn’t have released his next 

book, but that is where we are. 
Starting with season six, the 
show entered territory that few 
book to screen adaptations have 
ever had to face, continuing 
the story without the original 
source 
material 
to 
draw 

upon. Now your mileage may 
vary as it comes to the post 
season four/five episodes of 
“Thrones.” The show continues 
to be enormously well received, 
but amongst the most hardcore 
of book readers and show-
watchers, the tides have slowly 
shifted.

The most recent season was 

widely and rightly criticized 
for ridiculous storytelling that 
at times asked audiences to 
suspend every ounce of disbelief 
they 
had 
left. 
Characters 

made 
the 
distance 
across 

continents looks like a walk 
across the street. Long awaited 
revelations and moments were 
handled in the clumsiest of 
fashions. 
Main 
characters 

appeared to have death proof 
shields that allowed them to 
survive even the most unlikely 
of circumstances. “Game of 
Thrones,” the show that built 
its reputation of the death of its 
first season main character, had 
suddenly become safe. If you 
ask the average show-watcher, 
they might tell you that this 
season was a disappointment, 
but if you ask a book-reader, 
they will tell you that the 
problems began long ago.

Without Martin to go on, 

it became clear to me that 
D.B. Weiss and David Benioff 
had no idea what they were 
doing. As far back as season 
five, they began making story 
and character decisions that 
seemed to defy even basic 
reason or rationale. A lot of the 
characters (Jaime Lannister in 
particular, but also Ayra Stark, 
Sansa Stark and to an extent 
Tyrion Lannister) no longer 
bear almost any resemblance 
to the people portrayed in 
Martin’s books. The story has 
veered so far away from not 
just the events Martin was 
portraying, but moreover the 
themes that he was writing 
about, that it’s hard for anyone 
who has read the books to see 
how “Game of Thrones” can 
ever end in a way that will leave 
those still waiting for Martin’s 
next tome satisfied.

It’s hard to say why George 

R.R. Martin appears to be 
writing at the pace of a snail. 
It’s possible that he’s become 
uninterested in the story and 
has been for some time. It’s 
possible that he lost a significant 
amount of motivation when he 
realized that the show would 
beat him to the punch. It’s 
possible that he just writes slow. 
Regardless of the reason, one of 
the greatest fantasy stories of 
all time seems destined to have 
an unsatisfying ending. Fans of 
the book series will likely never 
see what Martin intended for 
his final volumes and fans of the 
TV show will get an ending that 
is based on Weiss and Benioff’s 
late-season blunders, not what 
was promised in the inherent 
premise of the show when it 
began in season one. For many 
involved, the story will end 
happily. Benioff and Weiss have 
a future making “Star Wars” to 
look forward to. Many actors 
from the HBO series have 
jump-started 
their 
careers 

and will have many more great 
performances to come. HBO 
itself will continue pumping 
out “Game of Thrones” spinoffs 
for as long as they make money. 
Audiences will move on to the 
next thing. But for Martin and 
his fans, the ones who began 
reading his books at any point 
between 1996 and now, this 
story will sadly end like the late 
Robb Stark’s, with a betrayal 
from his allies and in a personal 
tragedy of his own for failing 
to finish what he started. Valar 
Morghulis.

COMMUNITY CULTURE
‘The Last Days of Judas 
Iscariot’ is darkly funny

The play opens on a judge sitting 

with a gavel behind a makeshift 
bench calling to his bailiff. At first 
glance, this is a standard courtroom 
drama. After the opening lines, 
however, the impression is broken — 
this is not a legal court, but a quasi-
religious court of judgment in which 
lawyers and a judge deliberate over 
the guilt or innocence of Judas 
Iscariot. This was last week’s 
Department of Musical Theatre 
production of “The Last Days of 
Judas Iscariot,” a dark, humorous 
and thought-provoking production 
full of modern cultural references 
and absurd juxtapositions.

The play features a diverse 

array of important cultural figures: 
everyone from Satan and Caiaphas 
the Elder to Mother Teresa and 
Sigmund Freud. Saint Monica, for 
example, was played by SMTD 
freshman Mikaela Secada in a Cardi 
B-esque fashion, a humorous blend 
of hip hop and Biblical culture. 
These juxtapositions also raise 
new questions about these Biblical 
figures; Mason Reeve’s depiction of 
Jesus in modern, casual attire, for 
example, undercuts the inherent 
Westernized perception of Jesus. 
He probably did not appear divine 

at the beginning of his life. The 
play suggests him to have instead 
been a revolutionary, if not outright 
rebellious leader.

While 
these 
juxtapositions 

can be extremely comedic, this 
energy quickly loses focus against 
the serious backdrop of the trial 
occurring onstage. The first act of 
the play was extremely humorous, 
the 
outrageous 
comparisons 

between 
popular 
culture 
and 

Biblical culture leading to some 
truly memorable jokes. The humor 
was extremely dark, though — I 
found myself regretting the fact 
that I had laughed at certain 
points. While I was never outright 
uncomfortable, 
the 
humor 

definitely lent the play a shocking 
quality that carried through the 
entire act.

The 
second 
act, 
however, 

quickly dropped this comedic 
tone in favor of more serious 
subject matter, though this was 
still delivered through a dark lens. 
Satan’s second appearance as a 
witness, for example, results in an 
incredibly dark sequence in which 
Satan (played by SMTD senior 
Simon Longnight) quickly parses 
through both lawyers’ characters 
before 
finding 
and 
provoking 

their most vulnerable weaknesses. 
He 
criticizes 
the 
overzealous 

prosecution lawyer (played by 

SMTD senior Alexander Sherwin) 
for caring more about his fame 
than 
his 
reputation, 
suddenly 

proclaiming that he will amount 
to nothing. And he criticizes the 
high-minded 
defense 
lawyer 

(played by SMTD senior Kat Ward) 
for refusing to listen to others, 
proclaiming again that she, at her 
very core, is unsure of these beliefs.

Compared to the first act, this 

second act moved slower and 
lasted almost twice as long. It had 
brilliant moments, but it took a lot 
of development to reach them. It 
seemed to move in a predictable 
pattern 
— 
conflicts 
between 

characters would crescendo until 
every character was yelling, then 
they would slowly resolve. While 
these conflicts were extremely 
thought-provoking, this predictable 
pattern took away slightly from 
the 
overall 
experience: 
The 

predictability of the development 
slowly overshadowed the impact of 
the resolution.

At the end of the play, the 

comedic references to modern and 
Biblical culture had been stripped 
away. It was this eerie focus on 
the incnsistencies in our modern 
understanding 
of 
the 
human 

condition that rang true.

There’s 
a 
terrific 
movie 

somewhere in “Early Man” that 
apparently got lost in translation. 
The 
latest 
from 
Aardman 

Animation, 
the 
studio 
most 

well-known for their “Wallace 
and Gromit” cartoons, boasts 
an insane voice cast featuring 
the likes of Eddie Redmayne 
(“Fantastic Beasts and Where to 
Find Them”), Maisie Williams 
(“Game of Thrones”) and Tom 
Hiddleston (“Thor: Ragnarok”), 
as well as some undeniably 
beautiful 
animation. 
At 
first 

glance, the idea of a group of 
cavemen having to face Bronze 
Age-invaders even seems ripe for 
the kind of Monty Python-esque 
humor that Aardman trades in, 
but after an inspired first act, 
the humor steadily spirals into 
clumsy pratfalls and dragged-out 
unfunny gags.

The argument will be made 

that part of the problem is the 
aforementioned poor translation 
between the decidedly British 
script and American audiences. 
This is first and foremost a soccer 
movie, a sport that doesn’t hold as 
much water in the U.S. as it does 
overseas. However, “Early Man” 
is missing the one thing that every 
underdog sports movie must have: 

its heart.

For all its montages set to 

inspiring music and “teamwork 
makes 
the 
dream 
work” 

speeches, there’s nothing going 
on beneath the surface to keep 
viewers engaged. None of the 
characters are interesting beyond 

the ludicrous amounts of talent 
behind them, even for memorable 
quirks. Likewise, nothing about 
the story takes advantage of its 
unique prehistoric trappings after 
the familiarity of the sports movie 
tropes set in. It’s just a bore.

This goes double for the humor. 

Every once in a great while, 
there’s a funny line or artfully 
constructed pun, but these are 
drowned out by a painful series of 
attempts at physical comedy that 
lack any sense of timing or wit. 
They’re simply not funny because 
they either overstay their welcome 
or aren’t any good to begin with. 
The best moments are those when 
writers Mark Burton and James 
Higginson (“Shaun the Sheep 
Movie”) lean into the insanity of 
their core idea. There’s a hysterical 
sequence involving a giant duck 

that’s so unexpectedly brilliant it 
dwarfs every aspect of the movie 
around it. Instead of taking ideas 
like this further, though, they 
usually settle for, “Get it? It’s 
funny because they’re cavemen.”

At the very least, the animation 

is 
consistently 
dynamic 
and 

idiosyncratically dazzling. The 
first scene alone features a perfect 
combination of stop-motion and 
CGI that the talented animators 
at Aardman work to create a 
grander sense of scale than any of 
their previous productions. The 
scenes set in the soccer stadium 
may lack energy from the writing, 
but the animation does lend it a 
certain amount of liveliness. Even 
when there’s nothing going on in 
the foreground, the backgrounds 
alone are almost gorgeous in how 
they evoke the era in which “Early 
Man” takes place. At several 
points, they’re almost reminiscent 
of the Academy Award-winning 
production design from “The Lord 
of the Rings.”

The vocal talent also exceeds 

the 
script, 
with 
Hiddleston 

in particular donning a thick, 
unrecognizable French accent, 
but visuals and voices alone aren’t 
enough of a substitute for stale 
writing. Any intermittent charm 
offered by the animation or brief 
forays into smarter humor is 
canceled out by a crippling lack of 
heart and laughs.

‘Early Man’ falls a bit flat

A dad and his daughter: How Katelynn Flaherty became the face of Michigan

Katelynn Flaherty’s back was 

acting up again.

During the summer, she spent six 

weeks off the court recovering from 
a back injury, her only basketball 
activities consisting of dribbling a 
ball as she walked around the block 
and taking between 800 and 1,000 
foul shots every day. She pushed 
herself — that’s a habit of hers — 
and got clearance to start pushing 
a little harder with three weeks left 
in the summer.

“We knew that we were gonna 

do it,” said Tom Flaherty, her dad 
and Amateur Athletic Union coach. 
“It was just me and her — and then 
all the sudden, with three weeks 
to go, the other girls came down, 
couple of the high school girls came 
around that were real good players, 
couple of the college girls came 
down, couple guys came down. We 
used to have some 2-on-2, 3-on-3 
games. … She looked real good.”

But now — at halftime of a Jan. 

10 contest against Indiana — she 
had just four points and to go along 
with four turnovers in the first 
20 minutes, an uncharacteristic 
performance for a player who 
was on the verge of becoming 
Michigan’s all-time leading scorer, 
woman or man.

Her dad knew something was 

wrong. She knew that she would 
get through it.

19 second-half points and an 

84-79 win later, Flaherty had done 
just that. Three days later, she 
passed Glen Rice to become the 
Wolverines’ all-time leading scorer. 
The scare had passed.

On that day, actions spoke louder 

than words. Flaherty got through 
it. She always does.

***
Flaherty’s story starts before 

she could even walk, with one 
of the best women’s basketball 
players of all-time: Asjha Jones, 
a two-time national champion at 
the University of Connecticut, who 
was then a high school freshman 
looking for a team.

She found HoopsAmerica, a 

clinic operated by Rich Leary and 
Tom Flaherty. At the time, it was 
without a girls’ team, but Jones 
seemed a pretty good reason to 
start one.

“I was coaching just boys and 

one of the fathers kept inquiring, 
inquiring, inquiring at the location 
where we played, and then a girl, 
Asjha Jones, was his daughter, and 
he wanted me to train her,” Leary 
said. “Now, I had no idea the level 
of girls’ basketball player (she was), 
this was just some random, rising 
ninth-grade girl.”

Jones 
started 
training 
at 

HoopsAmerica regularly and it 
didn’t take long to see what she 
could do.

“I let her come down to work 

out with us, she fit in pretty well,” 
Leary said. “It was a gym full of 
very, very talented boys … and 
Asjha and a friend of hers started 
working out with us and then they 
brought their whole team over and 
we started a New Jersey Demons 
team.”

Tom coached the newly formed 

squad, and soon enough, Flaherty, 
age four by Leary’s recollection, 
was in the huddle with him. And in 
practices.

“We’d be in my backyard with 

the Demons team that I was 
coaching and we were playing in 
games,” Tom said. “And say I would 
have her in a game — she was 
maybe five, six years old — and she 
was fast-breaking, she got the ball 
and we’d throw to her the ball, if 
she would go down and she’d make 
the layup, it was good. If not, they 
would rebound and play the game 
back. She would do that and then, 
while we were going over work, 
practice and stuff like that, she 
would do her coloring book and 
stuff like that.

“But then after that, we would do 

baby hooks on a little basket, little 
moves, we started doing moves 
right away, like, basic moves. Jab 
step moves, in-and-out moves, little 
(dribble) moves, stuff like that.”

Even at a young age, Flaherty’s 

competitiveness and athleticism 
were evident. She was a standout in 
neighborhood softball, kickball and 
wiffleball games. When her cousin, 
two years her elder and a next-door 
neighbor, learned to ride a bike, so 
did she — while young enough to be 
in kindergarten.

“She took her training wheels 

off and then I was like, ‘Well, I 
want mine off,’ ” Flaherty said. 
“Cause we hung out all the time, so 
whatever she wanted — it’s like a 

sister — that I wanted just as good. 
So I remember telling (Tom), he’s 
like, ‘No, we’re not doing that.’ … I 
like begged him and begged him. 
And I remember by the end of that 
day … I was riding my bike without 
training wheels.”

By the time Flaherty reached 

seventh grade, basketball was a 
constant. Tom would organize 
pickup 
games 
between 
other 

girls from HoopsAmerica and his 
daughter that often went to 30, 
full-court, no matter the weather. 
When people came down the bike 
trail that cut through the same 
park as the court, they stopped and 
gawked.

After that, Flaherty would take 

300 extra shots and run two miles 
on the boardwalk.

Tom had two rules: Flaherty had 

to do well in school and she had 
to work out. They only ran into a 
problem once — a day in middle 
school when Flaherty decided she 
didn’t want to go play basketball.

The Flahertys’ backyard had a 

stone wall, and Tom got creative.

“Here, shovel stones,” he told 

her. “See how you like that.”

Flaherty obliged and soon had 

tears in her eyes. She stopped after 
two minutes.

“He was just making me dig 

stones and put them back,” Flaherty 
said. “Like, the most pointless thing 
ever.”

“Dad, I think I’d rather play 

basketball,” Tom recounts her 
saying. “I’d rather work out at a 
sport.”

***
The blacktop smelt like tar, the 

humidity was thick enough to add 
extra weight to clothing and still 
the games went on.

Tom kept an attendance book 

throughout, to see who kept 
showing up every summer, every 
day, to work out and play pickup. 
The initial workout was for two-
and-a-half-hours, 
followed 
by 

two or three games, then a two-
mile run. Flaherty estimates they 
started in fifth grade and went until 
her freshman year in college. Only 
the strong survived.

“There’d be 20 girls on again at 

the beginning of that summer that 
started. And you would see the 
attendance, and maybe five lasted 
through the whole (time),” Tom 
said. “ … And you could see the 
five or six or seven or eight people 
that stayed with it went to major 
Division I colleges.

“ … It’s pretty intense. I mean, a 

lot of people would say, ‘Oh yeah, 

we’ll go down to the park and play,’ 
or ‘We’ll go down.’ They ended up 
not lasting long. Because these 
kids had the ability to work hard. 
They wanted to make something of 
themselves, you know?”

“It felt fun. It felt free,” said 

Sadie Edwards, a former Demon 
and current senior guard at USC. 
“ … It was much different from like, 
structured basketball. But, that’s 
for me, personally. I don’t know, 
that’s where you learn to play 
basketball.”

With Tom, a former guard at 

Seton Hall, involved — and often 
playing in the games himself — 
hours stretched into full days.

“We’d play like three games to 

20 and he’d be like, ‘No, do another 
one,’ ” Flaherty recalled. “So you’re 
there all day, basically. That’s your 
whole day.”

Once everyone else went home 

for the day, drenched in sweat, 
Flaherty stayed and worked. She 
would do 300-400 extra shots 
those days, just like the extra 
workouts with her dad after AAU 
practice, just like the 500-600 
extra shots she does on the gun 
now, even with leftover soreness 
from a foot injury sustained two 
weeks ago against Northwestern — 
the same game in which she scored 
a season-high 36 points.

Not everybody on the team 

worked as hard as Flaherty. Then 
again, not everybody had Tom, 
the impetus for working out seven 
relentless days a week. When the 
team was together at practice, 
the workouts were the same. But 
Flaherty 
separated 
herself 
by 

working at home.

“I would say other girls all 

worked hard, but Katelynn would 
be an exception because she had 
her dad there to do the work each 
and every day and make sure that 
she was doing it,” Leary said. “And 
ultimately, it became who she was. 
That’s who Katelynn is.”

Flaherty’s dad rode her harder 

than everybody else in practice, 
in part because it dispelled any 
notion of bias and in part because 
he wanted her to develop an ethos 
of hard work.

“I think he wanted a lot out 

of me,” Flaherty said. “And then 
showing that he could get on his 
own daughter made other people 
feel comfortable when he yelled at 
them.”

In the summer of 2016, when 

both were going into their junior 
collegiate 
years, 
now-senior 

forward Jillian Dunston joined the 

festivities. The workouts nearly 
broke Dunston — a basketball 
warrior in her own right.

“I was so beat up after two 

days that (Flaherty’s) dad told me 
just to do the drills to half-court,” 
Dunston said. “Everyone else did 
them full-court. I said, ‘I can’t 
move.’ My body was cramping — I 
only cramp in basketball games, 
not in workouts — I mean, it was 
tough.”

Added Flaherty: “People say it’s 

crazy and (Dunston) was like, ‘No, 
you’re literally crazy.’ But I think 
it’s just been a way of life.”

Tom and Leary preach the value 

of hard work like nuns preaching 
abstinence.

“(Flaherty) would come back 

(after practice) and work out,” 
Tom said. “Other girls had the 
opportunity to, but they did other 
things.

“Which was cool,” he adds in 

a tone that makes you question 
just how cool it was. “You know, 
everybody has their own thing, you 
know?”

It’s rare that anybody actually 

works hard for such a sustained 
period of time. Flaherty did, and 
started reaping the rewards before 
high school.

After a local tournament at 

Rutgers 
when 
Flaherty 
was 

between eighth and ninth grade, 
C. Vivian Stringer, the coach of 
the Scarlet Knights, asked to meet 
with Tom. She promptly offered 
Flaherty a scholarship. Tom’s 
reaction was one of incredulity.

He didn’t know if his daughter 

had the speed to play in Division I. 
He knew she could shoot, sure, but 
running with the best competition 
in the nation was a different issue 
altogether. And if he didn’t know 
for sure, neither did Stringer.

“ ‘It’s ridiculous to think my 

daughter can play Division I 
basketball when she’s just starting 
9th grade,’ ” Leary recounted Tom 
saying. “ ‘That’s impossible.’ ”

In the coming years, however, 

Stringer would be proven right.

“I think that’s when I knew, 

‘Okay, well if I can start working 
really hard, then I can get a lot 
of these pretty big-time offers,” 
Flaherty said. “ … That was 
definitely 
incredible, 
in 
ninth 

grade, you have a full ride to a huge 
school.”

***
The Demons are unlike most 

AAU programs. Leary describes 
their philosophy as similar to the 
Golden State Warriors — sharing 

the ball and shooting a lot of 
3-pointers — then explains they 
don’t practice shooting 3-pointers 
and believe in the value of 1-on-1 
games for development.

“It’s been Tom’s feeling that 

you don’t have to practice a large 
number of 3-point shots in order to 
be a really good 3-point shooter,” 
Leary said. “It’s developing a 
rhythm in that your body identifies 
with the distance that you are 
from the basket. You don’t have 
to rethink it, when you’re — or 
make 
adjustments, 
conscious 

adjustments, when you’re shooting 
from 17 feet to 25 or 26 feet. You’re 
— if you’ve done enough repetitions, 
your body just naturally knows the 
additional force that you need in 
order to shoot from (distance).”

It’s a contradiction, but one that’s 

developed, among others, Flaherty 
and Jones on the women’s side and 
Luol Deng and Jay Williams on the 
men’s.

“You just practice your form 

over and over and over again, so it 
becomes natural,” Flaherty said. 
“And then when I was at the point 
where I was strong enough to shoot 
from (3-point range), it just felt like 
shooting a regular shot.”

The Demons don’t play in many 

tournaments either, purposefully 
so, preferring to focus on training.

They do, however, participate in 

the Rose Classic, a New York City 
staple. The Demons were in the 
finals against Exodus during the 
summer before Flaherty’s junior 
year. Then, Tom got ejected, with 
his team down big and without 
doing anything wrong.

The first technical went against 

him because someone affiliated 
with the program yelled at the 
referee. The second because the 
referee mistook his yelling at a 
player for arguing. Tom was forced 
to leave the gym.

“Tom never talks to referees,” 

Leary said. “I mean, he’ll talk to 
them, but he doesn’t complain 
about fouls, that’s just not what 
he does. He coaches, and is just 
entirely focused on the coaching. 
Whatever happens with the refs 
happens with the refs, so be it.”

Added Flaherty: “I think that’s 

the first and only time ever (he was 
ejected).”

Exactly how much the Demons 

were losing by at this point varies 
depending on who you ask — the 
consensus is between nine and 
15. What doesn’t is the awe in 
describing what happened next.

Flaherty went off, raining triples 

like a math savant rattling off digits 
of pi.

“She scored like the next 17 

points,” said Leary, who coached 
in 
Tom’s 
absence. 
“It 
was 

unbelievable.”

Added Edwards: “They were 

tough (shots). They were like, off 
the dribble, stepbacks, all sorts.

“... That moment, I was like, 

‘She’s special.’ Like, she has a 
chance to do something special. As 
she can channel that and be that all 
the time. Because she can be that 
all the time.”

Tom watched part of the 

ensuing action from the door, but 
not enough.

“After the game is over, I go out 

and tell Tom, ‘Tom, you gotta come 
back in for the awards ceremony,’” 
Leary said. “So he’s obviously 
fuming — he just got kicked out 
of a game in which he did nothing 
wrong. He said, ‘Let’s just go. I 
don’t want to, I’m so upset right 
now, I don’t want to go in.’

“Tom,” Leary replied, “we won.”
***
Her first year in Ann Arbor, 

Flaherty was coming off a lisfranc 
injury and struggled in the early 
goings of practice.

When the tide changed, though, 

it changed fast.

“We came back from (a trip to) 

Cedar Point and she didn’t miss a 
single shot in open gym that day,” 
Dunston said. “ … We played like 10 
games. I’m talking not one thing. 
I was like, ‘What’s wrong with 
you?’ She was like, ‘That’s how I 
normally shoot.’ ”

Flaherty’s work ethic also made 

an impression. Nicole Munger had 
met her just once — an awkward 
hello forced by their parents 
when the two future Wolverines 
attended the same game in New 
York — before she enrolled a year 
behind Flaherty.

Munger thought she worked 

hard, but she hadn’t worked out 
with Flaherty. She kept trying to 
outlast her and kept falling short.

“She’ll be in the gym for four 

hours on a summer day,” Munger 
said. “I’ll just be like, ‘I’m going 
home.’ ”

That work ethic has always 

paid dividends for Flaherty, but 
none more this season. The senior 
has turned Crisler Center into her 
personal 
playground, 
draining 

pull-up triples and blowing by 
anyone who closes too hard. She 
has played 40 or more minutes 
eight times this season and hasn’t 
slowed down. Against Illinois — 
days after playing the entirety of 
an upset win at then-No. 8 Ohio 
State — she heaved a half-court 
shot at the first quarter’s buzzer to 
the delight of a group of little girls 
in the crowd, then finished 5-of-8 
from outside for the game.

On Senior Day this Thursday, 

she’ll play her last regular season 
home game at Crisler Center, 
leaving as the face of the program 
— not just for this season, but ever. 
Her number will likely be the 
first ever retired by the Michigan 
women’s basketball team. She 
deserves that honor without a 
shadow of a doubt.

***
The game ended 45 minutes 

ago, a standard blowout over 
the Fighting Illini, but the girls 
are still waiting. They’re on the 
Blissfield travel basketball team, 
age nine, and can’t stop asking the 
same question: “When is Flaherty 
coming?”

Without ever spending hours on 

a blacktop, running extra miles or 
taking extra shots together — hell, 
without ever meeting — Flaherty 
imprinted a love of basketball onto 
the group.

“I’ve been following her a long 

time,” says Kara Perser, proudly 
informing her audience that she 
has been to almost every home 
game and watches them on the 
road. She even brought a poster to 
the game.

Flaherty had left the interview 

room a few minutes prior after 
taking questions, mostly about a 
half-court shot and another great 
game in the midst of another great 
season. Whether she’s coming to 
meet this starry-eyed crowd is an 
unanswerable question, at least for 
a reporter who stopped to talk on 
his way out of the building.

“When is Flaherty coming?” the 

chorus chimes.

Finally, one changes up the 

question.

“Have 
you 
interviewed 

Flaherty?” another one asks.

Once she hears an affirmative 

from the reporter, she makes a 
request.

“Tell her I love her.”

Versatile players help Michigan 

In South Bend, Ind. on Friday, 

sophomore 
forward 
Adam 

Winborg notched the first goal 
of the Michigan hockey team’s 
series against Notre Dame, a 
goal that would catalyze the 
rest of the offense to rout the 
top team in the country.

Winborg is just one example 

of an emerging category of 
Wolverine skaters who fill a 
utility role.

“Yeah, he scored a number of 

goals on a couple power plays 
last year and he’s willing to 
block shots on the PKs,” said 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson, 
“and he’s good on face-offs. So 
he can play, he’s one of those 
utility players.

“I guess you can play him in 

a lot of different situations and 
trust him. And that allows us to 
be able to slot him into different 
areas in the game and that’s 
where his value comes. It’s just, 
he’s so versatile.”

While the spotlight for the 

13th-ranked Wolverines (11-10-
3 Big Ten, 16-3-3 overall) have 
mostly been placed on veteran 
top-line leadership, Michigan 
has found its backbone in the 
younger utility players.

Joining Winborg’s ranks on 

offense are sophomore Nick 
Pastujov, freshman Jack Becker 
and junior Brendan Warren.

The trio has combined for 32 

points thus far — which isn’t 
even as many points as junior 
forward 
Cooper 
Marody’s 

leading 37 — that adds a marginal 
advantage. 
While 
Winborg’s 

goal helped the Wolverines 
prevail over Notre Dame, their 
offensive contribution pales in 
comparison to their off-puck 
feats.

“Personally, for me, it’s been 

a little bit of a different season 
than last year, but it’s been 
good,” Winborg said. “I have 
a good role on the team, like 
killing penalties and working 
five-on-five and trying to do 
that to the best of my ability.”

As evident in the series against 

the Fighting Irish, the entire 
Michigan squad was hustling all 
over the ice, blocking shots and 
killing penalties — something 
that wasn’t so apparent in the 
beginning of the season.

In roughly four minutes of 

man-disadvantage time Sunday, 
the 
Wolverines 
yielded 
no 

tallies.

In 
its 
two 
past 
series, 

Michigan has let just two 
power-play goals in, and much 
of that can be attributed to 
the likes of Winborg, Pastujov, 

Becker and Warren, all of whom 
have taken a prominent role in 
shot-blocking and clearing.

“This year is more of a PK 

role and I’m enjoying that,” 
Winborg said. “I think that’s a 
big part of the game and it for 
sure can help a team like in tight 
games like last weekend, it’s 
one goal games and if you can 
prevent them from scoring then 
it’s going to help out the team.”

And, with Pearson’s recent 

emphasis on varying the lineup, 
every player has gotten the 
chance to work on different 
lines, even in huge games like 
this past weekend.

“Now we know we have some 

good 
chemistry 
on 
certain 

lines,” Pearson said. “And you 
know you always have that in 
the bank but it’s good to be able 
to, even in a game, just throw 
different guys out to see what 
you have.”

While teams in the past have 

found success when specializing 
players into different concrete 
roles, this year, Michigan has 
found success in quite the 
opposite.

With 
numerous 
young 

utility players on the roster 
with substantial playing time, 
the Wolverines have excelled 
in having their skaters play 
loosely.

Penn State gelling ahead of clash with Wolverines

Wednesday is Senior Day for 

the Penn State men’s basketball 
team. That has meant a larger 
crowd than the usual barren 
amount and a jovial atmosphere 
at Bryce Jordan Center. A slew 
of pregame senior festivities is 
typically the sole attraction for 
fans. By the time the final home 
game of the year rolls around, the 
Nittany Lions have seldom had 
much to compete for.

But this year is different, and 

everyone in State College knows 
it. The slogan ‘We’re climbin’ 
decorates the shirts the school 
will give away Wednesday. It’s an 
apt slogan. 

After years of mediocrity, 

Penn State has been a surprise 
this year, positioning itself for a 
shot at the NCAA Tournament 
contingent on a strong finish. 
Last Thursday, the Nittany Lions 
completed a sweep of then-No. 
8 Ohio State with a dominant 
23-point victory before playing 
No. 9 Purdue to the wire on the 
road Sunday.

Penn State (9-7 Big Ten, 19-10 

overall) is quite dangerous and 
has everything to play for as it 
welcomes No. 17 Michigan (11-
5, 22-7) on Wednesday. A win 
could push the Nittany Lions off 
the bubble for the first time since 
2011.

“This Penn State team is 

making a great run right now and 
is really talented,” said Michigan 
coach John Beilein. “They’re 
young, and they’re extremely 
talented.”

That 
youth 
and 
skill 
is 

perfectly 
embodied 
by 
the 

Nittany Lions’ sophomore class. 
With one of the purest outside 
strokes in college basketball, 
sophomore point guard Tony 
Carr leads the Big Ten, averaging 
nearly 20 points and ranks fifth 
in assists with around five per-
game.

Manning the interior is one 

of the conference’s best interior 
defenders in Mike Watkins — a 
6-foot-9, 
254-pound 
forward 

good for nearly three blocks 
and 10 rebounds a contest. 
Small forward Lamar Stevens, 
meanwhile, adds a scoring threat 
to the frontcourt, averaging over 
15 points a contest.

“Their 
sophomores 
are 

outstanding,” Beilein said. “They 
got a shot blocker inside. They 
can shoot it, they can pass it.”

That all contributes to a strong 

sense of trepidation for the 
Wolverines. Two weeks ago, they 
ran into another surging team 
on the road in Northwestern and 
lost after a disastrous second 
half. A similar story unraveled 
in Lincoln, where Nebraska 
dominated 
Michigan 
to 
a 

20-point win in January.

Penn State could be an even 

taller task for the Wolverines.

“This is one that will be really 

difficult for us,” Beilein said. 
“This is a game where we’re 
absolutely going to have to play 
our best game of the year if we’re 
going to be in it at the end.”

Further complicating things 

for Michigan is the possibility 
that the Nittany Lions play 
zone 
defense 
— 
something 

they’ve 
flashed 
throughout 

the 
season. 
From 
Southern 

Mississippi in November to the 
Feb. 6 Northwestern loss, the 
Wolverines have struggled to 
adjust against the zone.

“That’s the challenge,” Beilein 

said. “We’re going to have to 
make foul shots, we’re going 
to have to limit their (second-
chance) shots, and when we’re 
open from 3, we’re going to have 
to knock it down because you 
won’t have much of a margin of 
error in this game.”

Michigan 
did 
many 
of 

these things well in Sunday’s 
victory over Ohio State. Senior 
guard Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman, who will be making 
his final regular season trip to his 
home state of Pennsylvania on 
Wednesday, led the Wolverines 
with 17 points, while understudy 
and freshman guard Jordan 
Poole added 15.

Michigan is playing its best 

basketball of the season as March 
approaches — but so are the 
Nittany Lions.

Penn State is indeed climbing, 

and Wednesday will be its biggest 
game in recent memory. A sold-
out Bryce Jordan Center will 
undoubtedly let the Wolverines 
know it.

“They’ve 
done 
it 
before 

against big crowds,” Beilein said. 
“But we’re going to have to play 
at our best.”

Michigan coach John Beilein recognizes the challenge ahead as his team will take on a Penn State team eager to earn a NCAA bid.

‘M’ struggles at Moon Golf 

Invitational, finishes in 10th

Controlling the golf ball 

was the theme of this week’s 
tournament for Emily White.

The senior headlined the 

Michigan women’s golf team 
at the Moon Golf Invitational 
with the team’s highest score, 
tying for 28th place. The 
wind was howling throughout 
the third round, but White’s 
control allowed her to move up 
seven spots after that round of 
play.

“She made a lot of birdies 

this week and controlled her 
golf ball really well,” said 
Michigan coach Jan Dowling. 
“She came out pretty strong 
to start the spring and she was 
ready to go.”

White’s performance was an 

outlier, though, as the rest of 
the team struggled through its 
first competition of the spring 
season with a 10th place finish 
out of 13 teams. The team 
hadn’t competed since the end 
of October, so there was quite 
a bit of dust to knock off in the 
first round Monday as the team 
scored 312, its worst score of 
the season.

But 
the 
team 
adjusted 

to the course in Monday’s 
second round and scored 298 
with 
a 
large 

improvement 
in the quality 
of play and ball 
control. 
The 

Wolverines 
finished 
the 

first day in 11th 
place, 
with 

sophomore 
Hannah Ghelfi 
tied 
for 
21st 

individually. 

“We dug ourselves into a 

pretty big hole after the first 
round, it certainly wasn’t our 
best golf,” Dowling said. “We 

played two solid team rounds 
in round two and round three. 
In round two we made some 
nice adjustments … so that was 
good.”

A solid showing in Tuesday’s 

final round moved Michigan up 
one spot to 10th place overall.

The 
Wolverines’ 
two 

individual golfers, Ghelfi and 
sophomore Alisa Snyder, were 
consistent 
throughout 
the 

three rounds. Ghelfi scored 
a career-best 73 in Monday’s 
second 
round, 
and 
Snyder 

finished in a tie for 48th 
with scores of 78, 76, and 77. 
Their scores did not count 
for the team score, but the 
performances may lead Ghelfi 
and Snyder to a spot in the 
starting lineup.

“There’s a lot of pieces that 

go into picking the lineup, 
including past play,” Dowling 
said. “The good thing about 
our team is that we’ve got some 
depth, and we’ve got some 
things to figure out as far as 
who’s going to be in the starting 
lineup moving forwards.”

Resilience was a highlight 

for 
Michigan 
during 
the 

competition after a challenging 
first 
round. 
Each 
golfer 

improved upon her first-round 
score in the second or third 
rounds, an encouraging sight 

for 
Dowling 

as the spring 
season begins.

The positive 

takeaways 
from 
the 

spring’s 
first 

competition 
show 
early 

signs of a solid 
campaign 
for 

the Wolverines, 
but they will 

need to continue to work on 
losing the cobwebs before the 
team can be where it wants to 
be.

An 
Afternoon 

Tea


M

y relatives like to joke 
that 
Asians 
and 
Asian-

Americans 
shouldn’t 
do 

hip-hop because we haven’t faced the 
same tribulations as other races. They 
especially 
ridicule 
certain 
rappers 

from their native Japan, who never 
suffered from racism, abject poverty, 
street violence or drug dealing but don 
expensive sneakers and talk about swag.

I wonder what they would think of 

Rich Chigga.

“And you don’t wanna f--k with a 

chigga like me / When I pull up in that 
Maserati / Better duck ’fore ya brain 
splatter on the concrete / I’ma hit you 
with that .45, bullet hit yo neck round the 
bow tie”

In 2016, hip-hop artist Rich Brian (born 

Brian Imanuel) became a sensation online 
after his viral hit, “Dat $tick” racked up 
tens of millions of views on YouTube and 
scored approval by established rappers 
like Desiigner and Ghostface Killah, the 
latter of which recorded an official remix 
of the song with him.

The song also became a target for 

heavy criticism for the supposed sin of 
cultural appropriation.

That’s 
because 
Rich 
Chigga, 
as 

Imanuel 
was 
known 
professionally 

before 
2018, 
was 
a 
homeschooled 

Chinese-Indonesian 
teenager 
whose 

father was a lawyer. And though for sure 
he saw plenty of ugly things growing up 
in a middle-to-low class neighborhood 
in West Jakarta, it was questionable 
whether it was appropriate for him to 
borrow the language and style of Black 
street culture.

Even his stage name was controversial. 

“Chigga,” a portmanteau of “Chinese” 
and a racial slur, was a ploy to attract 
attention by naming himself “the most 
controversial s--t ever,” hardly a good 
reason to offend numerous people.

Musicians like Rich Brian (as he now 

prefers to go by) become a flashpoint 
around cultural appropriation, or the 
adoption of elements of a minority culture 
by a member of the dominant culture. 
A blatant example would be fetishizing 
a minority culture by wearing an Arab 
thawb or a fake Fu Manchu for Halloween.

But, the common counter-argument 

goes, every present-day culture is the 
result of appropriations other cultures 
have developed by adopting aspects of 
other cultures. Indeed, most of the time 
it’s difficult to determine whether a 
song or dance is cultural appropriation, 
appreciation or exchange.

“Hip-hop is for everyone,” they say. “It 

transcends race.”

I believe cultural appropriation no 

doubt exists; weeaboos, for instance, 

offend my Japanese heritage when they 
reduce my culture to cute anime girls. 
But the question is where the limit is, and 
in cases like Rich Chigga, the line is so 
hard to draw.

The debate about non-Black people 

doing hip-hop reminds me of another 
form of Black music picked up by another 
race: Rock ‘n’ roll. When Elvis Presley 
shocked white America in the 50s, it 
wasn’t because rock ‘n’ roll was an 
inherently “degenerate” genre for young 
people; it was because Presley’s singing 
style and hip gyrations reminded parents 
of African-American musicians.

So were The Rolling Stones, lifelong 

adherents and promoters of Black R&B 
music, Jack Hamilton writes in “How 
Rock and Roll Became White.” “The 
world’s greatest rock-and-roll band” (to 
some) truly respected and focused on 
covers of blues and R&B musicians like 
Muddy Waters, Chuck Berry and Bo 
Diddley, and were annoyed that their 
fans were more obsessed with them than 
the American originals.

When the group first arrived on U.S. 

soil, the press vilified them with attacks 
against their physical appearance and 
dehumanizing comparisons to animals. 
It was a dog-whistle tactic to convince 
white adults that Mick Jagger, Keith 
Richards and the rest of these Englishmen 
were subversive beings who adored Black 
music; the press even played on the fear of 
miscegenation when they asked, “Would 
you let your sister go out with a Rolling 
Stone?” But the Stones didn’t counter 
these claims; in fact, they adopted it as 
part of their dangerous image.

I see a similar phenomenon happening 

in hip-hop. Hip-hop, which developed in 
New York City as the music of African-
Americans, immigrants and children of 
immigrants from the Caribbean, contains 
lyrics borne out of that community’s 
culture and struggles. “The Message” 
by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious 
Five, the first prominent hip-hop song 
to provide social commentary, talks of 
difficulties of living in inner cities, which 
is a common theme in hip-hop today.

The problem with non-Black musicians 

rapping these days is that hip-hop has 

become a cheap shortcut to evoke a 
thuggish and criminal cool that doesn’t 
belong in a white or Asian middle-class 
suburb. It fetishizes the real struggles 
some of these artists have gone through 
on a daily basis.

Hamilton writes that the Stones were 

guilty of this too; “Brown Sugar” is an 
upbeat song that casually talks about 
slave rape as part of Jagger’s discussion 
on interracial sex.

We shouldn’t pretend, especially in 

Asian hip-hop, there is absolutely no 
power dynamic between Asians and 
African-Americans in the U.S. Asians on 
a whole definitely yield more privilege, 
so “hip-hop is for everyone” rings hollow 
when the phrase equates Black struggles 
with Asian struggles.

Rich Brian is then indeed guilty of 

appropriating aspects of Black culture. 
And though in “Dat $tick” he provides 
insights from the streets of Jakarta, I 
believe there is a way to do that without 
so overtly featuring cliché hip-hop tropes.

That isn’t to say non-Black people 

shouldn’t listen, appreciate or perform 
hip-hop on their own. With due respect 
to the original and staying within 
one’s boundaries, non-Black rappers 
like Eminem can create an art that is 
rightfully their own.

We 
also 
shouldn’t 
cast 
cultural 

appropriation in popular music as 
some capitalist and colonialist scheme 
to dominate minority cultures. The 
irony of genres like hip-hop and rock is 
they’re rebellious in content, yet at the 
same time they line the pockets of rich 
executives in record companies that 
promote these tracks to mass audiences; 
this irony is what makes hip-hop and 
rock reach mass audiences.

In the end, sometimes whether 

culture is appropriated or appreciated 
is determined by whether a work is 
tasteful and artistic. As Rivka Galchen 
points out, nobody accuses the Wu-Tang 
Clan of appropriating Chinese culture; 
we as a culture bestowed the rap group 
artistic license because they gave back 
with good music that goes beyond 
the inspiration borrowed from their 
Chinese neighbors.

Let’s Bitch About It: 
 
 
 
 
 
Your study space is trash

W

hen not fawning over Reggie 
or tailgating before football 
games (both of which are 

overrated), most students spend their 
time outside of class studying for said 
classes. Students spend night after night 
in various study spaces cramming for 
exams, having mental breakdowns or 
procrastinating on Facebook.

However, despite these long hours 

spent studying, the ideal study spot 
(especially for late-night workers) can be 
hard to find. Coffee shops close, studying 
at home too easily leads to Netflix or 
sleeping, and the Law Library never 
seems to have an open table.

A lack of options leads to students 

cramming 
into 
bleak 
study 
spots 

featuring loud patrons, dirty bathrooms 
and ugly views.

The 
University 
of 
Michigan 
is 

decidedly 
beautiful. 
Every 
other 

Instagram has a photo of the inside of 
Hatcher during finals season or the Law 
Quadrangle during the first snow. Why 
does it seem that there are maybe four 
spots on campus worthy of Instagram 
but the rest of the widely-known study 
spaces are generally trash?

The Shapiro Undergraduate Library
Appearance: 1/10
Environment: 0/10
Productivity: 2/10

The UGLi is notorious for being the 

worst study space on campus. Despite 
this infamy, there are never any open 
tables. The second you walk into the 
building you can feel the unhealthy mix 
of procrastination and stress.

The third and fourth floors can be 

nice if you get one of those tables by the 
windows, but of course, the only way 
to get one of those is to sell your soul 
to Mark Schlissel himself or study at 10 
p.m. on a Saturday.

The UGLi earns the descriptor of the 

seventh circle of Hell due to the less-
than-studious students who populate 
the first and second floors. I personally 
prefer not to hear about Chad from Tau 
Mu Delta’s wild night at Skeeps while 
trying to do my homework. Legend has 
it even when the second floor appears 
completely empty, you can still hear the 
sound of a frat star dragging his Timbs 
while walking.

I would also like to remind my fellow 

library patrons that the UGLi is not a 
restaurant where you and your pals can 
eat and catch up: I do not want to have 
to smell your greasy food. Yet you cannot 
walk through the UGLi after 10 p.m. 
without seeing at least four Pizza House 
boxes and likely a mix of Chipotle, 

Buffalo Wild Wings and Jimmy Johns. 
Does the party of 10 talking loudly next 
to me not have any homework to do?

The 
UGLi 
is 
a 
hotbed 
of 

procrastination as groups of friends 
sit around complaining that they are 
incredibly busy and stressed out while 
actually getting no work done. Then 
suddenly when midnight hits, half of the 
population begins leaving after finishing 
little to no work. Meanwhile, the other 
half realizes the error of their ways 
and proceeds to cram their work before 
ultimately going to bed at 3 a.m. under 
entirely preventable circumstances.

The Stacks
Appearance: 1.5/10
Environment: 2/10
Productivity: 3.5/10

I understand the appeal of a quiet, 

private study space, but the Stacks offers 
the same sort of silent solidarity as a 
prison cell. The uniform boxes do nothing 
to motivate the young student, offering 
only a window to the outside world full of 
free individuals.

The Stacks is the place fake, tortured 

freshman gather to stress over a five-
page intro-level English essay, which 
apparently requires an all-nighter to 
finish. It’s the place where you stress out 
over your first Math 116 exam, which you 
plan to spend 36 straight hours studying 
for, but you will actually spend much of 
this time procrastinating. It’s the place for 
students who love the idea of being more 
stressed than their friends — the kid who 
can’t help but one-up you in workload.

“Oh, you were up until 1:00 a.m. doing 

Poli Sci 101? I was in the Stacks until they 
closed cramming for this Orgo exam,” 
Some freshman who doesn’t understand 
how college works yet says.

Stop torturing yourself! It’s not cool to 

be stressed out and sleep deprived.

Most people graduate from the Stacks 

when they realize it’s not high school 
anymore and they learn of better study 
spaces. Though there are the few who 
never change this mindset (I’m sure you 
know at least one).

 
Ross Winter Gardens
Appearance: 5/10
Environment: 3/10
Productivity: 2/10

Walking into Ross (if you are 

not a Ross student) offers the same 
internal feeling of a thousand frat boys 
asking, “Who do you know here?” It’s 
intimidating. It feels like everyone is 
watching you with the knowledge that 
you are not one of them.

While that feeling can pass with time 

(or an acceptance to the minor in my 
case), what never passes is the white men 
in Canada Goose jackets blocking the 
hallway. There is never a shortage of bro 
hugs in the Ross Winter Gardens.

From the perspective of being a study 

spot, Ross continues to fall short. Ross 
students do have the luxury of booking 
private study rooms (which is admittedly 
nice for group projects), but for any other 
student who chooses to study there, 
space is often limited to the Winter 
Gardens, which are almost always loud, 
crowded and weirdly echoic.

Also, why are the chairs and tables 

so weird? Is the rounded black plastic 
with a strange curvature at the bottom 
supposed to be ergonomic? With all the 
money tax-avoidance expert Stephen 
M. Ross donated, you would think they 
could furnish the space with something 
better 
than 
inconveniently 
shaped 

cheap plastic.

The Michigan Union
Appearance: 4/10
Environment: 3/10
Productivity: 3/10

I love the Union, but I love the Union 

as a convenient place to buy coffee on 
my way to class, not as a place to study. 
I love that I can get food there (Au Bon 
Pain is my true love). But I do not know 
why I would want to study in the same 
place I’m grabbing a quick Blue Bucks-
funded, between-class bite.

Eating should be a time to relax 

between classes, studying, work and 
all the rest. It’s a time for mindlessly 
staring at your phone while shoveling 
down the arguably disgusting and 
disappointing Panda Express. It is not a 
time to try to do your homework.

Conversely, while studying, I do not 

want to smell food — or even worse 
watch or hear other people eat. If I’m 
trying to finish an assignment, I do not 
want to smell the nauseating mix of 
Wendy’s and Subway while working on 
a perpetually sticky table.

There are the few nice study tables 

in the two study rooms in the front, but 
seating is so limited, so why bother? You 
could have the same style of study space 
in more beautiful buildings like the 
Law Library or in Hatcher’s Reference 
Room. Much better to try one of those 
places than awkwardly walk into the 
Union study room only to have to walk 
out again 30 seconds later after finding 
all the chairs taken.

As a whole, the Union has its merits, 

but at best it’s an aggressively average 
study space.
T

here are of course hidden gems 
(like Rackham or a few others 
which I will not name as to not 

publicize my favorite study spots) but 
in looking for a nice spot to settle down 
for several hours for a late night study 
session, options are limited.

Then again, your favorite study spot 

may be trash, but if it keeps you out of 
mine, feel free to remain blissful in your 
ignorance.

The stark traditionalism of Martha Cook

An Afternoon Tea

A

s I pass through the doors 
of Martha Cook Residence 
Hall at the University of 
Michigan, I enter a hallway 

clad in wooden panels whose austerity 
of color and design evokes past eras. 
Brightly lit by ostentatious chandeliers 
and archaic windows, the space draws 
the eye to the Venus de Milo statue situ-
ated at the end of the hallway. To the 
left, near the windows, there’s a table 
that displays silver platters with per-
fectly manicured pyramids of cucumber 
sandwiches and chocolate pastries. The 
sound of laughter and the clinking of 
glasses echoes through the main floor. 
The effervescent atmosphere in the 
building can be felt as women stroll in 
and out of rooms in their formal dress: 
It is Friday afternoon tea time.

Walking into Martha Cook is like 

traveling back to the early 20th century. 
The halls and impeccable entertainment 
chambers feel unfamiliar and incongru-
ous with the happenings and progres-
sive values of our modern campus. The 
building, standing almost unchanged 
from the time of its inauguration, seems 
to be a world away from the University, 
yet it occupies a central place on our 
campus.

Coming to campus as a woman of 

color, I never questioned my place at 
this university. I believed myself to be 
as qualified and deserving of a world-
class education as any other student 
who vowed to never step on the bronze 
block ‘M.’ Like most, I took a tour before 
officially enrolling as a student. My tour 
guide briefly signaled Martha Cook 
as a women’s only dormitory, but any 
thought or preoccupation with it was 
forgotten by the time we walked past. 
I was highly ignorant of the history of 
women on this campus and complete-
ly unaware of the origin of the word 
“coed.”

It wasn’t until one of my professors 

assigned a reading on Martha Cook that 
I first considered the history of women 
on campus. It should not have come as a 
surprise to read about the long-lasting 
paternalism faced by women on cam-
pus. However, the most jarring aspect of 
learning about this history was becom-
ing aware of every blind tradition and 
system of oppression that has prevailed. 
I came to see the dormitory as a constant 
reminder that, despite being an enclave 
for progressive thinking and inclusion, 
the University of Michigan still held 
onto small artifacts of its exclusive past. 

But in my incredulity, I wanted to see 
this community firsthand, not satisfied 
to simply read critiques of it on paper. 
O

nce inside, I was ushered 
by the Tea Chair — the 
member of the house board 
who organizes Friday teas 

— into the Gold Room. Heavy curtains 
framed the windows. An antique piano, 
Elizabethan furniture and two fireplac-
es adorned the room, which is illumi-
nated by the dim light of gilded lamps 
and the reflection of the snow outside. 
Almost every chair or sofa was taken up 
by girls immersed in conversation. The 
majesty of the room astounded me, but 
it seemed to be a given for the rest of 
the girls who were sipping on their tea 
and eating cucumber sandwiches off of 
crystal platters.

Most of the girls who come to tea 

every week, like Business freshman Jac-
queline Kenny, use it as an opportunity 
to socialize.

“I knew I didn’t want to rush a soror-

ity, but I still wanted an all-female com-
munity where I could live and make 
friends so Martha Cook sort of fit the 
bill,” Kenny noted.

Martha Cook’s lively tea tradition 

may seem innocent from an outsider’s 

perspective, but an intuitive Univer-
sity student or community member may 
realize that the dormitory’s walls are 
tainted with a history of female oppres-
sion as well as racial and socioeconomic 
divides. The girls that once inhabited its 
rooms and walked its halls came from 
predominantly white, upper-class back-
grounds with much more rigid social 
norms.

Women were first permitted to enroll 

in the University in 1870, and the first 
cohort of women arrived the following 
year. At the time of Martha Cook’s inau-
guration in 1915, they were still relegat-
ed to second-class status to their male 
classmates.

“All the spaces of a college campus 

were assumed to be for men, unless 
they were specifically carved out for 
women,” Carla Yanni, a professor of art 
history at Rutgers University, writes in 
an architecture journal. In fact, women 
were referred to as “coeds,” because 
“student” had implicitly only referred 
to males during the era.

The idea for a women’s dorm came 

about when the University Women’s 
League — an organization representing 
female students — discussed inadequate 
housing situations for its members. 
Plans were drawn for the construction 
of the first University-affiliated dormi-
tory, which would also be women-only. 
Upon hearing of the project, William 
Cook — a wealthy lawyer, Michigan 
alum and namesake of the Law Library 
— immediately offered a large donation 
for the construction of this building.

However, once he saw the ideas origi-

nally brought forth by the Woman’s 
League, he deemed them insufficient 
and set forth a plan of his own. In 
exchange for his large donation, Cook 
ensured the building’s administrators 
were to follow a specific set of rules to 
create an environment that fostered a 
“model for gracious living,” according 
to the “Martha Cook Building History 
and Traditions” pamphlet.

As a patron, Cook intended for his 

building to “create young women of out-
standing sophistication and savoir faire,” 
according to Yanni. Though portrayed 
as a beacon of egalitarianism, Martha 
Cook, Yanni explains, “was intended as 
a quasi-domestic retreat within the set-
ting of a masculinist campus.”

The result of these guiding principles, 

and Cook’s place in society as a white 
upper-class male, created exclusivity in 
the Martha Cook residence hall. Only 
upper-class Anglo-Saxon women who 
intended to become caretakers of their 
homes were encouraged to reside in 
Martha Cook.

At the time of Martha Cook’s estab-

lishment, women’s dormitories were 
places where “coeds” needed to stay 
in order to be subdued and kept on the 
domestic and bridal tracks. In a way, 
these buildings typified gender repres-
sion and ensured educated women 
were always reminded of their place in 
society. As residents of Martha Cook, 
women typically aspired to be cul-
tured housewives, and these aspira-
tions were encouraged by invitations to 
dances, teas and other socials and “baby 
days” where they would practice tak-
ing care of faculty members’ children. 
The norms and environment of Martha 
Cook thus promoted their social status 
as second-class citizens and as domes-
tic, inferior beings only deserving cer-
tain types of education.

Other than exemplifying the stereo-

typical roles of women, classism was 
ingrained in William Cook’s beliefs and 
practices when it came to his patronage 
of Martha Cook, despite his intentions 
to keep room and board accessible to 
less privileged women. Decades after 
the dormitory first opened its doors, 
Cook reversed his original belief and 
promoted his building as an exclusive 
space only meant for women of high 
class. In addition, he expressed his dis-
taste for “blue stocking” women, who 
were known to have a “taste for lit-
erature and scholarship” according to 
Yanni.

Many current Martha Cook residents 

acknowledge the contrast of its original 
benefactor’s values to those of its pres-
ent residents. 

“(Cook) thought that women should 

go to finishing school, but then he was 
like, ‘Well I guess if you’re going to go 
to college, we are going to let you be in a 
place that looks like a finishing school,’” 
said Engineering junior Jenny Jasperse, 
house board president.

Even though the building still looks 

like a finishing school — a place where 
women went to be prepared to enter 
high society as housewives — Friday 
afternoon tea no longer suggests this. 
The girls I saw sitting in the Gold Room 
were typical University students talk-
ing about the Shapiro Undergraduate 
Library and complaining about their 
computer science or business classes.

As LSA junior Jillian Hurst said it, 

“What is important is that the build-
ing evolves their curriculum and their 
space to be inclusive of other walks of 
life and to adapt to the modernization 
of feminism and the female experi-
ence.”

T

hough all three all-womens’ 
dorms on campus — includ-
ing 
Betsy 
Barbour 
and 

Helen Newberry — origi-

nated in the same decade, only Martha 
Cook retains such a distinctive reputa-
tion. Since its establishment, Martha 
Cook has operated autonomously from 
the rest of the residence halls on cam-
pus. Amassing its own alumni associa-
tion, board of governors and detailed 
instructions from William Cook’s will, 
the building has imposed traditions, 
like Friday afternoon tea, that can’t 
be found elsewhere on campus. This 
autonomy has allowed the dormitory to 
function on the periphery of University 
Housing, serving a largely homogenous 
cohort of self-selecting girls living in a 
unique situation.

Residents, or “Cookies,” as they refer 

to themselves, reside in a limbo between 
the modern campus and the old-fash-
ioned traditions that regulate their 
home. They are modern, intelligent and 
diverse women who have chosen — or, 
in the case of legacy women, have been 
prompted by their families — to live in a 
place that still upholds the traditional-
ist values of a man who lived a century 
ago. The surface Martha Cook experi-
ence, as exemplified by formal dinners, 
dress codes and century-old traditions, 
is being challenged every day by its resi-
dents.

Residential life in Martha Cook, like 

everything else on campus, has changed 
throughout the years. Today, women 
can freely use all campus facilities with-
out second thought. For the most part, 
women are treated equally by profes-
sors, advisers and University staff. Teas 
are only once a week instead of every 
day, and women are now allowed to 

wear pants in the Gold Room. In addi-
tion, the women attending Friday after-
noon tea today are not preoccupied with 
marriage or entertaining their male 
counterparts.

The Alumni Association of Martha 

Cook has instituted the “gap” scholar-
ship which subsidizes the difference in 
the cost of housing between other Uni-
versity housing and the significantly 
more expensive Martha Cook dormito-
ry. In this way, a woman from any class 
who wants to live in Martha Cook, and 
demonstrates financial need, is able to 
do so if awarded this scholarship.

Even though traditions have evolved 

since its inauguration, Martha Cook’s 
preservation of traditional values and 
gendered experiences poses many ques-
tions about its design and purpose. Its 
regulations still include “boy hours” 
— limiting the hours when members of 
the opposite sex could be present, and 
only if escorted by a resident — and a 
restricted meal plan that, except for 
Saturday evenings and lunch on North 
Campus, requires residents to have all 
of their meals in the Martha Cook din-
ing hall.

This 
old-fashioned 
and 
mostly 

homogenous space stands in stark con-
trast to the experiences of other women 
on campus who are not residents of 
Martha Cook.

Women not originally intended or 

allowed to live in the building by Wil-
liam Cook now enjoy the perks and 
experience the challenges of being a 
Cookie. Hurst, who only happened to 
be at afternoon tea because she was ful-
filling her required “tea service” hours, 
expressed her indifference toward the 
building’s history. 

“There are a lot of institutions on this 

campus that have roots in things that 
don’t benefit me as a woman of color, but 
I have to fight my fight elsewhere,” she 
said. “I think that the way I overcome 
that is just by living in this building and 
getting my education and working my 
way out.”

As I interviewed modern day Cook-

ies, I learned this indifference is wide-
spread. Cookies are not fully aware of, 
or at least are not preoccupied with, 
the history of their residence hall. They 
occupy its rooms and follow its tradi-
tions without thinking about the impli-
cations of its history. By overlooking 
this history, Cookies uphold Martha 
Cook’s image of a residence hall peopled 
by, as expressed by Hurst, “predomi-
nantly upper middle-class women with 
values and interests I can only describe 
as traditional.”

As for me, visiting Martha Cook was 

an eye-opening experience. As a self-
proclaimed feminist, the persistence of 
this building on our campus was ini-
tially alarming, but when I walked out 
and said my last goodbye to the Venus 
of Milo, I was more understanding of 
the value given to the building by its 
residents. I realized that the residents 
and staff didn’t dwell on its history, and 
instead viewed the dorm as their home 
and a place to be proud of.

William Cook’s beliefs still permeate 

the environment in the dorm; however, 
they seem to be set aside by the mem-
bers of the Martha Cook community. 
Modern Cookies are a part of the every-
day campus, but at night, when they 
retire to their rooms that stand mostly 
untouched, they are living an alterna-
tive reality and in some ways, upholding 
old-fashioned values that contrast our 
modern campus.

The entryway in Martha Cook.


I 

planned out everything I wanted 
to say and how much I wanted 
to reveal about myself in this 

personal statement the entire week 
prior to the moment I sat down to write. 
I would pretend to write it in my head 
during class, dictating telepathically 
to someone somewhere with a pad and 
paper. I expected to wake up and have 
all of my emotions and experiences 
laying on my lap typed, double-spaced 
and stapled with eloquent prose to 
boot. Sadly, I had to do the heavy lifting 
myself.

If you read my columns, you’ve 

probably gotten used to my meaningless 
rants 
on 
music 
and 
second-hand 

embarrassment. This is not that. You’ll 
just have to wait another week for the 
goofy, cheerful facade of Matt Harmon 
to return. I’m honestly on the edge of 
my seat, waiting for him to come back 
with another playlist and an amusing 
tale of woe. I prefer that Matt Harmon 
as opposed to this one: introspective 
and brooding. At this point, I expect 
Godot to show up sooner than the 
happy Matt Harmon.

Whenever anyone has approached 

me looking for solace, my response 
has always ended with, “Just try and 
concentrate on the happier moments 
of life.” Am I proud of that response? 
Hell no. I’m actually ashamed of it. But 
it shows how I dealt with problems; 
I 
suffocated 
them 
with 
smiles 

and extraversion and just general 
clowniness.

I’ve always assumed all of the 

problems and situations I’ve been 
through with family, relationships (or 
lack thereof) and anxiety were solely 
my burdens to bear. I was the camel and 
every straw broke my back repeatedly. 
If I couldn’t keep up, it was my fault.

I don’t mean to let my column seep 

into this piece too much but sometimes 
song lyrics hit a little too close to home. 
I hear a line, a certain chord in my 
heart is struck and my eyes open wide. 
I become obsessed with the song for 
weeks, expecting more to be revealed 
about myself through that one line. 
While music can’t respond or listen to 
your problems, it channels what you’re 
feeling into something that makes 
sense.

Music was my first therapist.
“I say the loudest in the room / Is 

prolly the loneliest one in the room” - 
Tyler, the Creator

“Lovin’ you sure makes me afraid of 

losin” - Field Medic

“I’m not the only man who’s scared to 

be alone” - Joe Hertler and the Rainbow 
Seekers

For years, instead of seeking the help 

I most definitely needed, I receded 
into a den of music and emotional 
suppression. When my heart sank into 
the bottom of my chest and my breaths 
became short and sharp, my hand 
would immediately fly to my pocket 
where my earbuds resided. I’d plug in, 
listen to something positive and wait 
until I regained control of my body and 
could smile again.

The first time I realized what I was 

experiencing was a genuine mental 
health issue, I was driving in my 
hometown — a less than ideal location 
for a moment of self-discovery and 
trauma. I had received a very alarming 
text from someone — specific details 
are not important — but someone I 
cared about was not addressing me in 
the greatest of lights. As the yellow 
line dividing the road hugged my tire, 
my chest grew heavy. I was scared. 
What if I genuinely hurt someone and 
lost a friend? What did I do? What if 
they hated me? A barrage of questions 
in this vein swirled about in my head, 

tormenting me and gnawing at my 
sense of self.

I pulled over to the side of the road 

and tried to recoup. In the suburbs, 
it’s safe to say many people do not like 
cars with their lights on pulling up and 
waiting outside their house. Though 
they expected to see someone in a full, 
black and white-striped burglar’s outfit 
with mask and all ready to ransack 
the place, what they would’ve seen is 
a 17-year-old boy with tears streaming 
down his face, a shock in either case. 
When homeowners would come to the 

door to see what I was doing, I would 
get scared and pull off, searching for a 
new street to park on and breathe.

I called my best friend Michael and 

practically forced him to come with me 
to a diner so I could talk out what was 
happening to me. He didn’t hesitate and 
I’ll always love him for that. Sitting in 
the booth for what seemed like hours, 
I ranted and raved and tried to make 
sense of how I was feeling. Though he 
didn’t have any answers, he sat and 
listened and made me feel like I wasn’t 
alone.

My second therapist.
That was a year-and-a-half ago. My 

first taste of what it could be like to talk 
about my feelings and try to improve 
my mental state. After that night 
with Michael at the diner, I was more 
conscious of my emotions and anxiety 
even though I didn’t know it was called 
anxiety at the time. I began to notice 
when I was distressed.

One of my problems is I unconsciously 

sabotage chances for me to experience 
some form of happiness because I’m 
afraid I will hurt people in the end. The 
last thing I want to do is be the cause of 
someone’s pain. I’d rather cry for hours, 
filling an ocean with my sobs, than be 
the root of one person’s single tear.

I spent so many years with my 

emotions bottled up in my chest, hiding 
behind jokes and a wide grin. This new 
mode of self-reflection was incredibly 
foreign. Still, I believed it was a solitary 
effort to conquer these fears. I can talk 
to friends about it but in the end, it was 
my psyche and I should probably be the 
one to make myself well again.

I had never even considered the 

idea of official therapy until my friend 
mentioned it during this past winter 
break.

“Have you thought about going to 

CAPS?” she said.

The short answer was no, I hadn’t. 

The long answer was I had, deep in 
the back of my brain, but was terrified. 
I thought the moment you entered a 
bonafide therapist’s office was the 
moment you announced to the world 
something was wrong with you. I 
couldn’t bear the idea of sitting in that 
room, having someone not only listen 
to my troubles but try to find the cause 
of them. They’d tell me things I already 
knew but didn’t want to admit, not even 
to myself. It may sound irrational but 
it’s how I felt and sometimes still feel.

No one wants to admit their happiness 

is being hindered by their own actions.

After many days and nights of 

wrestling with the idea while Frank 
Ocean helped the stress leave my body, 
I entered the Michigan Union, ready 
to find the CAPS office and jump over 
the first hurdle. Every tour guide and 
campus representative will say CAPS 
is on the third floor of the Union. 
However, the third floor was an enigma 
to me. I had never been there before. I 
didn’t think I had a reason to.

I walked in the front doors of 

the Union and saw a mass of people 
studying on the first floor, a common 
sight for any U-M student. I climbed 
the stairs to the second floor. Again,

This isn’t easy to write

BY MATT HARMON, SENIOR NEWS EDITOR

I 

remember practice lockdowns 
to be some of the most awkward 
experiences 
of 
my 
early 

schooling. The entire class huddled 
into the corner of a dark classroom 
so we would be prepared if anyone 
potentially 
dangerous 
entered 
the 

school. I remember thinking it unlikely 
that turning the lights off would be 
enough to keep someone from trying to 
enter the room.

I thought about what decisions my 

teacher would have to make if someone 
did find us. Some mornings, when 
I walked into school or came late, I 
noticed how easy it 
would be to enter a 
school, even with a 
required sign-in.

But 
I 
never 

anticipated 
that 

school 
shootings 

would 
become 
so 

common.

As 
a 
student 

teacher, 
I 
worry 

for the safety of my 
students. Sometimes I 
worry what decisions 
I might have to make 
when I have my own 
classroom, and how 
to mentally prepare 
my students for this 
reality. 

Unfortunately, 

these 
thoughts 

are 
only 
becoming 

increasingly relevant 
in the United States, 
where there has been 
little to no progress 
in 
school 
shooting 

prevention. 
Thirty-

one percent of school 
shootings 
occur 
in 

the U.S., with eight 
school shootings in 2018 alone. Just this 
week, I overheard students in the school 
I teach at talking about the recent school 
shooting in Florida and what they would 
do if there were to be a shooting in their 
own school.

Yet, I struggle to explain these realities 

to my students so that they take school 
lockdowns more seriously, but in doing 
so, would I shatter any feeling of safety 
that students feel at school? Though 
public outrage should be increasing in 
response to these shootings, people are 
becoming desensitized to the unending 
violence that permeates mainstream 
and social media.

Even when people post about a school 

shooting, or any issue, social media 
w“slacktivism” —posting about issues 
without enacting real change — is 
more prevalent than concrete actions. 
Sometimes it seems that people lose 
hope in creating change, though many 
other countries have taken practical 
steps to reduce the occurrence of 
school shootings and gun violence, and 
have been successful.

As a country, we are stuck in an 

unending debate over gun control and 
other discussions on how to make 
schools safer, such as having more 

security, or police officers in schools. 
And though to some, having a police 
presence in schools is a viable option, the 
truth is the people that suffer the most 
from this are students of color. These 
students are often preemptively seen as 
troublemakers and dealt with forcefully 
by police officers. Even as an adult, I 
find the police presence to be nerve-
wracking as a person of color. I can 
imagine my students could have similar 
reactions. Some schools hire security 
guards for their school instead, which 
may be a better alternative, but is not a 
preventive measure to keep shootings 
from happening in the first place.

National 
public 
debates 
usually 

focus on less significant aspects of 
the issue, repeatedly asking the same 
questions after each occurrence: Who 
was the shooter? If the shooter had a 
family, why did they still do it? Did the 
shooter play violent video games?

Meanwhile, 
the 
National 
Rifle 

Association spends millions of dollars 
lobbying not only for the protection 
of the right to arms, but also for a 
lack of regulation on gun purchases. 
This system prevents finding concrete 
solutions to public safety, but the issue 
is often dismissed as unsolvable, as 

if it is impossible to 
know the factors that 
contribute to school 
shootings.

Over 16 years ago, 

filmmaker 
Michael 

Moore attempted to 
answer the question, 
“Why is gun violence 
so 
prevalent 
in 

America?” 
Is 
it 

America’s 
history 

of violence? Is it the 
number 
of 
citizens 

that own guns? Moore 
concluded that though 
these 
factors 
are 

important, the most 
distinctive factor in 
America, it seems, is 
fear. Media outlets 
and politicians, only 
worsening the issue, 
constantly feed the 
fear that we have 
of 
others 
in 
this 

country. It is this 
extreme 
fear 
that 

festers in our society, 
along with the lack of 
gun regulations that 
causes 
these 
mass 

shootings to become so prevalent. And 
while it is true that we have to try as a 
society to reduce the factors that cause 
someone to want to pick up a gun to 
kill mass amounts of people — whether 
it be mental health, extreme racism, 
fear or other factors — guns should not 
be so easily accessible to people.

It should not take a shooting in 

every school in the nation to make 
people concerned about the epidemic, 
but without any concrete changes 
in 
legislation 
to 
prevent 
school 

shootings, they will only become 
more commonplace.

anyone could have a reason to go to the 
second floor. As I began to ascend the 
next flight of stairs to the third floor, 
I looked around. I swore people were 
looking at me.

“We know why you’re going to the 

third floor,” they seemed to say.

“Why else would anyone go higher 

than the second floor unless they’re 
sick in the head?” they said.

I powered through and started up 

the stairs to the third floor. When I 
looked back for the last time, I saw my 
extroverted-self staring at me from 
the second floor. He’s perfectly fine; 
nothing going on in that ol’ noggin 
of his beside Hawaiian shirts and a 
happy-go-lucky demeanor. I envied 
him. I wanted to go back to the way 
things were and be ignorant of my 
anxiety.

Just then, the vision of that past-self 

shattered into a million pieces, shards 
flying all about the second floor of the 
Union. I ran up to the third floor before 
he could come back. I stepped into 
the CAPS office and was paired with 
someone who listens to my stories, asks 
questions and works to help me with 
my anxiety towards relationships and 
happiness.

My third and current therapist.
I wouldn’t call it fun to dive into 

your past experiences and cry for a 
while. I sometimes think I look like the 
Kim Kardashian crying meme, which 
is never a good look, but when I leave, 
I feel a little more and more relieved. I 
wrote this poem on my phone’s Notes 
app after my first session. It hurts to 
share but I trust all of you.

“when i left my first therapy session
the cold wind stung more than it 

ever had before

cause my tears
that had stained the circles under my 

eyes

and draped down my cheeks
made my face bare
a fresh coat of paint
ready for next week at 3:30”

I wrote this piece not only to help 

Statement fill pages but also to help 
myself. If I can put this inner struggle 
out there and feel comfortable with 
my decision to do so, I have a base to 
grow from. There’s no big lesson here 
for everyone to relate to and it wasn’t 
easy to write but I guess I’ll end with 
this: I hope happiness is just around 
the corner for all of us.
