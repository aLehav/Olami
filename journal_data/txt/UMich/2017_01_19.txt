This semester, in honor of 

the University of Michigan’s 
bicentennial, LSA is carrying 
on its tradition of a themed 
semester by offering over 
20 classes centered around 
the 200th anniversary of the 
University.

The 
classes, 
offered 

in 
several 
different 
LSA 

departments 
with 
an 

overarching theme of Making 
Michigan, 
focus 
on 
the 

school’s place in important 
events of the past 200 years 
and where it lies in the 
current 
social 
landscape. 

Many also emphasize the 

future of higher education 
and the issues it faces today.

Terrence McDonald, the 

former dean of LSA and now 
a history professor as well 
as director of the Bentley 
Historical Library, is teaching 
a class called “22 Ways to 
Think About the History of the 
University of Michigan.” The 
class will offer many different 
perspectives on the school’s 
past. It is also cross-listed 
with the Applied Liberal Arts 
department, 
which 
houses 

classes that have extensive 
extracurricular opportunities 
and 
a 
multi-disciplinary 

focus.

“(In the class) we think of 

the University as a place, as a 

About 50 professors, students, 

faculty members and members 
of the Ann Arbor community 
gathered Wednesday afternoon 
in the Hatcher Graduate Library 
to listen to three University 
of Michigan faculty members 
discuss the recent publication of 
“Toward an Intellectual History 
of Black Women,” a collection 
of essays on the experiences 
and roles of Black women in the 
history of intellectuals.

Law 
Prof. 
Martha 
Jones, 

English Prof. Megan Sweeney and 
Tiya Miles professor of African 
Studies all spoke on the panel, 
who used the book as a platform 
to address the importance of 
uncovering the stories of Black 
women, and women in general, 
that often go untold.

“We want to unearth lies, 

ideas, narratives and analyze and 
interpret them,” Miles said to the 
audience.

Jones, one of the editors of the 

book, further encouraged the 
audience to strive for uncovering 
unknown narratives.

“Recovery is at the core of 

what we do, and there is still so 
much more we need to do,” she 
said.

Jones also recognized the 

importance of making the history 
more accessible to people outside 
of academia.

“I 
think 
many 
of 
the 

challenges that are attuned to 
doing Black women history will 

continue, and the burden will be 
on many of us, including those 
of us who are intellectuals, to 
take the work out of the academy 
and into the public sphere to be 
sure that the histories, as well as 
the perspectives that come, are 
available to everybody,” she said.

Miles provided evidence of the 

success of the book in expanding 
people’s views, despite occasional 
negative comments on the work.

“These 
are 
little 
steps 

forward,” she said.

Rackham student Michelle 

May-Curry, a member of the 
predominantly graduate student 
audience, said she admired every 

woman on the panel for their 
surprising conclusions.

“It’s astonishing how Black 

women’s 
history 
has 
been 

relegated to the cracks,” May-
Curry said. “If we’re going to talk 
about Black women, we have to 
piece it together and we have to 
know that many people will not 
take us seriously in starting those 
conversations.”

May-Curry 
also 
echoed 

panelists’ sentiments regarding 
the importance of uncovering and 
highlighting the history of Black 
women in academic settings.

“Our 
histories 
are 
being 

devalued in the classrooms and 

the archives, and this work is 
essential to uncovering that,” she 
said.

Jones mentioned after the 

event that she will be attending 
a Women’s March in Baltimore 
this Saturday.

“When I go to a women’s 

march on the 21st, wouldn’t it be 
cool to carry a sack of these books 
and books like it?” Jones said. “It 
feels like there are going to be 
thousands of women and fellow 
travelers for whom this kind of 
knowledge and understanding 
is more pertinent perhaps than 
ever … maybe I will take a stack of 
books to the march.” 

Celebrating 
the 
art 
of 

student music and film, 50 
students and faculty attended 
the first Spotlight music and 
filmmaking 
competition 

closing ceremony Wednesday 
night at Stamps Auditorium. 
Sponsored by MPowered, a 
student 
entrepreneurship 

organization 
on 
campus, 

awards were given to teams of 
up to four producers for their 
projects.

The 
50-hour

featured student works from 
every school at the University 
of 
Michigan. 
Participants 

filmed 
all 
footage 
on 

smartphones, and winners of

The two winning projects 

will be shown Thursday night

300 attendees gather for MLK symposium lecture by best-selling author in Rackham

Author and activist Junot Díaz 

delivered a speech Wednesday 
afternoon on white supremacy, 
racialized 
immigrants 
and 

solidarity to about 300 people in 
Rackham Auditorium as a part 

of the University of Michigan’s 
annual symposium in honor of 
Martin Luther King Jr.

Díaz began by discussing 

racial neoliberalism and its 
function 
in 
derailing 
how 

people talk about race. Racial 
neoliberalism, 
he 
argued, 

prevents people from addressing 
problems 
of 
racism 
and 

questioning if anyone can racist.

“One of the things that has 

become very clear to me is … 
the evolving derangement of 
race and racial politics in this 
country has been exceptionally 
problematic,” Díaz said. “Racial 
neoliberalism 
(is) 
perhaps 

best understood as an almost 
global racial gaslight, derailing 

our ability to speak about the 
way white supremacy works 
at a political and global level 
while permitting hegemony to 
practice white supremacy full 
blast.”

Díaz further explored how 

the United States is organized 
along white supremacist lines,

It is expected that Gov. 

Rick Snyder will support the 

state’s Healthy Michigan Plan 

on Thursday in a U.S. Senate 

committee discussion. The 

roundtable in Washington D.C. 

will be discussing the future of 

Medicaid in the country.

Healthy Michigan, the state’s 

brand of Medicaid for low-income 

residents, is funded through the 

Affordable Care Act. Recently, the 

Republican-majority Congress, 

fueled by President-elect Trump, 

have taken steps to repeal the ACA.

In his State of the State address 

on Tuesday, Snyder expressed his 

support for Healthy Michigan, 

stressing the program is a crucial 

part of Michigan’s health care plan 

and a good example for the nation.

“The important thing is we 

need to let them know that Healthy 

Michigan is a model that can work 

for the rest of the country,” Snyder 

said in his speech. “We should be 

speaking out, and I look forward to 

working with my federal partners 

to talk about the value of this 

program and how it can even be 

enhanced.”

The meeting was organized 

by Republicans on the U.S. Senate 

Finance Committee after a letter 

from the Republican Governors 

Association requested more input 

in health care discussions. Though 

Snyder did not publicly endorse 

Trump during the election, reports 

expect him to stay in town for the 

inauguration on Friday.

Healthy Michigan has enrolled 

about 640,000 Michigan residents 

and has decreased hospital costs 

for uncompensated care by 40 

percent from 2013 to 2015, Snyder 

said. Snyder also underscored 

his high hopes for the Senate 

meeting and the results he expects 

afterward.

“I look forward to working 

with my federal partners to talk 

about the value of this program, 

how it may even be enhanced as 

we go through these difficult and 

challenging questions,” Snyder 

said.

Betsy DeVos, the nominee for 

secretary of the U.S. Department 

of Education under President-

elect Donald Trump, participated 

in a contentious confirmation 

hearing on Tuesday evening.

The confirmation hearing 

was initially scheduled for Jan. 

11, but the Senate Committee 

on Health, Education, Labor 

and Pensions postponed the 

hearing to Tuesday due to Devos’ 

incomplete financial disclosures 

and unfinished ethics reviews.

Michigan native DeVos has 

received flak for her support of 

school choice, a controversial 

issue in the national education 

debate. Even before the hearing, 

her 
appointment 
received 

criticism from the American 

Civil 
Liberties 
Union 
and 

the 
American 
Federation 
of 

Teachers. 
The 
Devos’ 
were 

also 
large 
donors 
to 
the 

Trump campaign. Despite the 

previously expressed concerns, 

it was Devos’ answers to other 

questions posed by Democratic 

senators 
regarding 
Title 
IX 

measures on sexual assault and 

the extent of gun regulation in 

schools which raised the most 

eyebrows.

The University of Michigan 

is currently under Title IX 

investigation.

The 
Title 
IX 
guidance, 

created 
in 
2011, 
requires 

schools to respond to sexual 

assault 
complaints 
promptly 

and effectively. It also requires 

school employees who respond 

to sexual assault complaints to 

have adequate training.

When Sen. Bob Casey (D–Pa.) 

questioned DeVos on whether 

she would preserve the Title IX 

guidance, she was unable to give 

an affirmative response.

“If confirmed, I look forward 

to understanding the past actions 

and current situation better, and 

to ensuring that the intent of the 

law is actually carried out in a 

way that recognizes both the 

victim … as well as those who are 

accused,” DeVos said.

Casey, who called campus 

sexual assault “an epidemic,” 

continued to press DeVos for a 

definitive answer on whether 

she would preserve the guidance.

“It would be premature for 

me to do that today,” DeVos said.

As DeVos struggled to answer 

questions regarding the Title 

IX guideline, senators raised 

questions regarding her stance 

on gun regulation in schools.

Chris Murphy, a Democratic 

senator from Connecticut — the 

site of the 2012 Sandy Hook 

shooting in where over 20 were 

killed — brought up the issue, 

asking: “Do you think guns have 

any place in or around schools?”

“I think that’s best left to 

locales and states to decide,” 

DeVos said.

She then went on to cite 

the presence of guns in a 

school in Wyoming.

“I think probably there, 

I would imagine there is 

probably a gun in a school 

to 
protect 
from 
potential 

grizzlies,” she said.

DeVos also said she would 

support 
President-elect 

Trump if he moves forward 

with his plan to ban gun-free 

school zones.

DeVos, who has been a 

controversial nominee, has 

drawn more criticism after 

her confirmation hearing.

Lonnie Scott, executive 

director of Progress Michigan, 

said DeVos is unqualified to be 

the secretary of education.

“The United States Senate 

should reject her appointment 

and send a clear message that 

our public-school system is 

not for sale to the highest 

bidder,” Scott said in an MLive 

report.

DeVos confirmation hearings raise

Senators question Michigan native’s proficiency in sexual assault and gun policy

built form, as a kind of generator 
of records,” McDonald said. 
“We’re going to spend some 
time at the Bentley Library, 
attend a special tour of the 
show at UMMA on the history 
of the Union and the League, 
and we’re having a variety of 
guests come in and speak about 
other topics.”

McDonald, who has been 

teaching at the University since 
1980, believes that studying the 
school’s past will help students 
understand its significance on 
a global scale.

“If you spend time studying 

the history of the University, 
one fact about it is that it was 
one of the most important 
universities 
in 
American 

history,” McDonald said. “I 
think we have a vague sense 
of the current rankings, but 
really from the 1950s on, the 
University of Michigan has 
been one of the most important 
universities in the country 
and in the world. I think it’s 
important to know that.”

American 
Culture 
Prof. 

Kristin Hass is also taking 
a hands-on approach to the 
bicentennial in her class, titled 
“University of Michigan Time 
Capsule.” 
In 
Hass’s 
class, 

students create work that will 
be included in the bicentennial 
time capsule, which will be 
launched into space this year 
and brought down for the 
tricentennial in 2117.

While 
preparing 
for 
the 

class, Hass discovered that 
very few time capsules have 
been successful in revealing 

novel information about the 
past. She wants her students 
to use the class to create pieces 
that will actually affect future 
views of the last century at the 
University.

“In 
100 
years, 
people 

will 
have 
so 
much 
more 

information about us,” Hass 
said. 
“The 
challenge 
is 

producing something that will 
cut through that avalanche of 
data.”

Hass describes the 16-person 

class as much more fun than 
most of her other courses. 

It’s an important one though, 
she said, because it hones in 
on the true purpose of the 
bicentennial.

“Having classes that really 

engage students for a whole 
semester 
celebrates 
the 

University by doing what we do 
best: teaching,” Hass said.

Other 
classes 
honor 
the 

landmark year in more abstract 

ways. Heather Thompson, also a 
professor of history, is teaching 
a themed class called “The 
History of Detroit in the 20th 
Century.” The class grapples 
with 
both 
historical 
and 

modern issues faced by the city 
and examines its relationship 
with the University.

“I think it’s really important 

that students know the history 
of the largest metropolitan 
area around,” Thompson said. 
“Over the decades, there’s been 
a sense that the University 
of Michigan and Detroit are 
really disconnected, and we’ve 
been trying to reconnect the 
two.”

Thompson’s 
class 
aligns 

with the bicentennial theme 
of challenging society, and 
she hopes her class will give 
students 
an 
insight 
into 

what she sees as a notorious 
gap between Ann Arbor and 
Detroit.

“I think it’s really important 

that 
Michigan 
students 

question why they are so 
disconnected from this major 
metropolitan 
region 
and 

actually engage,” Thompson 
said. “I hope they see it as 
a 
place 
that’s 
incredibly 

interesting, and … I hope they 
learn to listen to Detroiters, 
and what they have to say — 
what they feel needs to happen 
to 
their 
city, 
rather 
than 

treating it like a laboratory.”

There 
are 
also 
many 

bicentennial 
research 

projects 
focused 
on 
the 

solely 
University’s 
internal 

affairs. 
LSA 
Senior 
Katie 

Zoller, participated in a study, 
conducted by German studies 
prof. Dr. Kerstin Barndt, on 
the 
University’s 
museums. 

The 
experience, 
she 
said, 

broadened both her view and 
her appreciation of the school.

 
“(The 
research) 
tells 
us 

how we got started, how our 
university developed, and also 
shows us how the tradition of 
excellence that we see today has 
been here since the University 
started,” Zoller said. “There 
are lots of discoveries we made 
that have impacted the history 
of the University.”

The project ended in April, 

but 
Zoller 
is 
continuing 

her 
involvement 
with 
the 

bicentennial 
by 
taking 

“Michigan 
in 
the 
Era 
of 

Industrialization.” The class 
involves more research than 
Zoller’s 
other 
classes, 
and 

allows her to explore a more 
specific topic.

“It looks like we’ll have 

a lot more time to go to the 
Bentley library and do primary 
research,” 
Zoller 
said. 
“It 

seems really interesting to talk 
about the University at the 
University, as opposed to going 
to the University and learning

Aside 
from

to involve all aspects of this

Professor McDonald says this 
is his favorite part about it.

“People 
from

McDonald 
said. 

“It’s a phenomenal banquet of

sustained outreach with ESG.

“I pledge to all of you tonight 

that I’m going to be working 
with my commissions, asking 
them and encouraging them, 
to hold more events on North 
Campus, because for every 
event that we do on Central 
Campus I deeply believe we 
should have an event on North 
Campus as well,” Schafer said. 

Following his presentation, 

ESG members asked follow-
up 
questions 
and 
offered 

suggestions to create a more 
collaborative 
relationship 

between the two governments.

Engineering senior Neha 

Chopra 
asked 
Schafer 
to 

differentiate 
between 
the 

roles of members of ESG and 
Engineering representatives 
on CSG, aiming to ensure that 
the two student government 
bodies are not duplicating 
efforts. 
Schafer 
suggested 

an addition be made to CSG 
bylaws that would require 

CSG members to attend their 
respective school or college 
student government meeting 
once a month or once a 
semester.

“I think a lot of it is 

really 
strengthening 
and 

institutionalizing 
linkages 

of communication between 
each governing body, Schafer 

said “and I think that that 
is something that all of us 
should aim to do.”

The 
meeting 
continued 

to cover new business, in 
which the development of a 
biomedical engineering minor 

was discussed.

Engineering 
sophomore 

Xavier Yeshayahu introduced 
the 
idea, 
and 
noted 
the 

number of minors offered in 
LSA subjects is significantly 
higher than the minor options 
in Engineering subjects.

“Our BME program is really 

comprehensive 
and 
really 

open to different majors,” 
Yeshayahu said.

Because of the fast growth 

in the BME field, Yeshayahu 
thinks 
the 
minor 
would 

increase interest in the BME, 
particularly 
for 
graduate 

students. The idea received 
substantial support from the 
members of ESG.

Engineering 
sophomore 

Ainsley 
Ashman 
Jr. 

supported 
the 
idea, 
but 

expressed concern about the 
development process.

“I really like this idea, 

but I know that the process 
of approving new courses 
is cumbersome so getting a 
whole new minor approved 
could be very difficult to do, 
but I think it’s a great idea,” 
Ashman said.

something that was challenged 
during the question and answer 
session later in the afternoon.

“There 
is 
an 
enormous 

resistance 
both 
inside 
my 

own community and inside 
what we would call the larger, 
mainstream community … to 
thinking about the world in any 
critically, racially interesting 
way,” Díaz said. “Often, what 
we are asked to do is to have 
solidarity with a point of view 
(white supremacy) that erases 
our lived experience.”

LSA senior Juyeln Ha said 

Díaz’s voice as a Hispanic 
activist was new to her.

“I guess there aren’t that 

many Hispanic activists that I 
know of,” Ha said. “I thought 
that this was a really good 
chance to explore that kind of 
area and just educate myself 
more.”

Díaz’s speech drew parallels 

between 
the 
Dominican 

Republic 
and 
the 
United 

States and how each country 
racializes immigrants for its 
own political purposes. He 
emphasized that both have a 
border wherein the outside is 
viewed as inferior.

In the United States, he 

highlighted, 
Mexicans 
are 

framed as inferior, while in 
the Dominican Republic — 
where Díaz emigrated from 
— Haitians are deemed second-
class.

Both countries, Díaz said, 

use racialized immigrants as 
a political touchstone, and use 
it to activate a shift in popular 
mentality from thinking about 
the world critically to being 
dictated by fear.

In recent history, politicians 

in 
both 
countries 
use 

immigrants to control political 
conversation.

In the Dominican Republic, 

Díaz 
explained, 
citizens 

rallied around a collective 
action in a fight for education 
funding until there was a 
sudden emphasis on Haitian 
immigrants, 
disrupting 

solidarity and creating fear of 
foreigners.

“This dream-like moment, 

of 
cross-class, 
cross-race, 

cross-geography, 
cross-age, 

solidarity begins to absolutely 
unravel when the political 
elites 
of 
the 
Dominican 

Republic awaken this very 

charged, very emotional issue 
of the invader immigrant,” 
Díaz said.

In the recent U.S. election 

Donald Trump created a fear 
of Mexican immigrants, which 
in turn controlled the political 
conversation and climate in 
the recent election, according 
to Díaz.

LSA senior Kennedy Clark 

said she valued the opinions 
Díaz voiced and issues he 
brought to light.

“He’s dealing with a subject 

matter 
that 
affects 
him 

personally—it 
affects 
many 

people 
personally—but 
that 

isn’t necessarily acknowledged 
by a vast majority of people,” 
Clark said.

Halfway 
through 
the 

lecture, the floor was opened 
up 
to 
questions, 
allowing 

audience members to ask about 
topics such as institutionalized 
racism and the books Díaz is 
currently reading.

“That sort of anti-Latino and 

anti-Islam rhetoric fits right 
back into anti-Blackness,” Díaz 
said. “What’s interesting is 
that our enemies have created 
antagonistic 
solidarities 

between 
our 
communities 

that we have not yet begun to 
equal.”

One 
question 
received 

shouts of disapproval from 
the audience and led to Díaz 
dismissing the questioner.

“I don’t deny racism exists, 

sure it does,” the audience 
member said. “But I do deny 
that America is defined and 
controlled by white supremacy 
— it seems to be real nonsense.”

Díaz repeatedly emphasized 

that gutted public education 
systems 
have 
led 
to 
a 

misinformed public and have 
undermined critical thinking.

“Nevertheless, 
I 
would 

simply point to the fact that 
the 
average 
American 
has 

been educated in a system that 
makes 
them 
fundamentally 

ill-prepared to defend their 
rights,” Díaz said.

Altruda relayed stories of 

attempting to establish himself 
as a promoter in the Ann Arbor 
music 
scene, 
including 
his 

failures and how he learned 
to better market himself as a 
music entrepreneur in the 21st 
century.

In his final words, Altruda 

said since most students at 
the ceremony are going to be 
graduating in the near future 
and keeping one’s vision in 
mind and doing what makes 
one happy is crucial after 
leaving the University.

“You’re young right now,” 

Altruda said. “It’s really time 
to start thinking about your 
vision and your career and your 
life. Earn it. Life is so short … 
so whatever you do, earn it. If 
that means drop out of school, 
go to Costa Rica and live on the 
beach for the rest of your life, 
if that’s gonna make you happy, 
then you heard it from me. You 
should do it.”

The first place winner for the 

Film category was a short film 
named “Roll Call” produced 
by students LSA junior Dylan 
Hancook, LSA senior Kelsey 
Comeau and LSA sophomore 

Dylan Lange. Inspired by the 
pedantic spiel of professors on 
the first day of classes taking 
roll, Hancook, wrote a comedic 
short featuring characters such 
as Marie Antoinette, Big Bird 
on his day off, a Grandfather’s 
urn and others on the first 
day of an American cultures 
lecture.

While 
filming, 
Hancook 

said he was glad he had plenty 
of friends willing to be extras 
in the project. Since the time 
crunch for the competition 
is tight, a large ground of 
friends gave Hancook the extra 
support he needed.

“My project in particular 

is a great example of why you 
need friends to make things,” 
he said. “I think we had about 
30 different characters. It’s so 
important to have friends that 
are interested and available.”

For 
the 
Music 
category, 

the song “Have to Go (Hope 
You Don’t)” by SMTD senior 
Steven Ciasullo, LSA junior 
Tim Everett, SMTD senior 
Cedric Lee and LSA senior Jin 
Kim took home first place. An 
R&B track about friends going 
through similar experiences 
throughout their time at the 
University, LSA senior Sarah 
Shelby 
contributed 
to 
the 

songwriting on the project. 
Shelby said the song attempts to 
draw together the experiences 
of her and her other friends 

who worked on the project.

“We’re 
all 
really 
good 

friends and we were discussing 
different 
relationships 
and 

we’ve 
all 
been 
through 
a 

million 
different 
things 
in 

college that are similar and 
kind of understood this feeling 
of moving on and changing 

so much,” Shelby said. “We 
all were able to get into that 
feeling 
based 
on 
different 

experiences in the past.”

Ciasullo, who did the final 

mixing and mastering on the 
track, said Spotlight gave him 
the chance to spend time with 
his friends and create music.

“It’s really nice to have a 

goal to work towards,” Ciasullo 
said. “I was brought on to 

work on this fun project with 
my friends and that’s kind of 
exactly what we got out of it I 
think. The creative process for 
me is really hard individually 
but with other people, it was 
really great to feed off of their 
ideas.”

After 
its 
first 
year, 

participants 
said 
the 

competition 
elevate 
both 

artistic 
innovation 
and 

cooperation.

“It 
definitely 
promotes 

people who are just naturally 
creative and want to go out 
and 
make 
things, 
whether 

it’s music film or whatever,” 
Hancook 
said. 
“It’s 
really 

promoting Michigan students 
being creative and doing things 
in a short amount of time. 
You know coming into this 
competition that you’re going 
to have something by the end of 
the weekend which is always a 
really good feeling.”

Shelby said the competition’s 

format lends itself well to 
friend groups who want to 
create art in a short amount of 
time.

“I would encourage people 

to try and do something like 
this on their own having this 
example,” Shelby said. “You 
really just need two days and 
set time aside for what you feel 
like you really want to do. Have 
trust in your friends and be 
honest.”

T

uesday marked the end 
of an era, as President 
Barack Obama bid the 

American 
public 

farewell during his final 
presidential 
rally 
in 

Chicago. The departing 
commander in chief 
has, in my estimation, 
always had tremendous 
skill in public speaking. 
Presenting 
himself 

with the same gravitas 
that 
we 
have 
seen 

for the better half of 
a 
decade, 
President 

Obama addressed the 
continued need for racial unity 
and economic opportunities for 
all. It seemed as if every laptop 
and television screen in the nation 
was tuned in to the broadcast, with 
continuous praise on various social 
media platforms.

In fact, President Obama’s 

approval 
rating 
rests 
at 
an 

impressive 57 percent. While 
this cumulative evaluation sits 
agreeably 
with 
many, 
others 

might raise the question — why? 
When elected, Obama marketed 
himself as a man of change. He 
was seen as an individual separate 
and distinct from presidential 
norms. His modest upbringing 
and accomplishment as the first 
African-American president of 
the Harvard Law Review are 
merely two examples of how he 
distinguished himself from the lot.

Yet, public opinion seems to 

suggest that the prospects for the 
future now are not much different 
than they were eight years ago. 
An NBC-Wall Street Journal poll 
taken in January 2009 states that 
26 percent of respondents believed 
that the country was going in the 
right direction, whereas 59 percent 
said that it was on the wrong path. 
A recent NBC-Wall Street Journal 
poll, however, similarly shows that 
29 percent of respondents felt as 
if the country were headed in the 
right direction, while a gaping 65 
percent disagreed. It also must be 
noted that this data was taken in 
late October, a time in which the 
majority of politicians and political 
pundits saw the victory of Donald 
Trump as incredibly unlikely.

By 
voting 
for 
Clinton, 
the 

electorate was, in part, voting for a 
continuation of Obama. Thus, it is 
very hard to believe that the majority 
of 
Obama-voting 
Democrats 

would view Clinton as the “wrong 
direction.” Moreover, these numbers 
ultimately illustrate the fact that 
Obama’s presidency did not do much 
in the realm of American optimism. 
Yet, 
his 
approval 
rating 

persists: 57 percent.

Domestically, Obama focused 

almost 
exclusively 
on 
the 

Affordable Care Act 
— a piece of legislation 
that 
he 
effectively 

rammed 
through 

Congress 
without 

any 
bipartisan 

approval. 
The 
bill, 

popularly 
known 

as Obamacare, was 
crafted behind closed 
doors with virtually 
no 
transparency. 

What is worse is that 
the American public 

was wholly misguided on a variety 
of its principles. For instance, on 
numerous occasions Obama was 
seen at rallies saying, “First of all, 
if you’ve got health insurance, 
you like your doctor, you like your 
plan — you can keep your doctor, 
you can keep your plan. Nobody is 
talking about taking that away 
from you.”

These 
promises, 
however, 

turned out to be specious. The fact 
of the matter is that the majority of 
Americans receive health care plans 
from their place of employment 
and although the law does prohibit 
employers from dropping coverage 
if they have “50 or more full-time 
equivalent employees,” the law did 
not prohibit employers with fewer 
than 50 employees that provided 
insurance before the ACA was 
passed to end their coverage. Thus, 
with the passage of the bill, while 
many Americans were unscathed, 
many were forced to seek alternative 
methods of care. This scenario is 
particularly complex, though, and 
does not rest solely on the employers’ 
shoulders. In other cases, many plans 
were not grandfathered over into 
exchanges, thus forcing individuals 
to seek new plans as well.

Surely, this attempt to mislead 

the 
American 
public 
would 

result in a lower number than a 
55-percent presidential approval 
rating. While a “minority” was 
affected, it does not take a large 
body of people to affect approval 
ratings or, at least, spread negative 
emotions about his legislation. 
Regardless of the number, his 
misguiding words were harmful 
and, due to the effects, have the 
potential to affect ratings. But no, 
the number continues to persist.

While there obviously are a 

variety of factors that contribute 
to this, I ultimately believe that his 
popularity stems, at least in part, from 
his personal domain. At the time of 
his election, he was the husband to a 
well-respected Michelle Obama and 
the father of two charming little girls. 

I can vividly remember sitting down 
many years ago in my elementary 
school classroom to watch the 
inauguration. It was history. Many 
young children felt as if they closely 
grew up with President Obama. As 
his children matured, we matured 
with them. By combatting racial 
stereotypes 
and 
discrimination, 

President Obama served as an 
inspirational father figure and leader 
to countless youth across America. 
He transcended boundaries and 
made a lasting impact on the lives of 
those around him.

In 
the 
second 
presidential 

debate, both candidates were asked, 
“Regardless of the current rhetoric, 
would either of you name one 
positive thing that you respect in one 
another?” Hillary Clinton ultimately 
responded with high praise for 
Trump’s children. She stated, “Look, 
I respect his children. His children 
are incredibly able and devoted, and 
I think that says a lot about Donald. I 
don’t agree with nearly anything else 
he says or does, but I do respect that, 
and I think that is something that as 
a mother and a grandmother is very 
important to me.”

As Secretary Clinton notes, Mr. 

Trump’s children are a reflection 
of his dedication and values. They 
have grown to be successful, 
respected individuals in their 
fields. Politics aside, this is a 
noticeable commonality between 
Trump and Obama. Have the 
circumstances of their families’ 
upbringings differed? Absolutely. 
Now, one might say, “Clinton 
is merely commenting on his 
parenting skills, not his character!” 
The point, though, is that they 
have both devoted time and effort 
into 
becoming 
attentive 
and 

caring fathers for their families. It 
is incredibly difficult to separate 
parenting abilities from the man 
himself. However, at the end of the 
day, I have a sneaking suspicion 
that this component of Donald 
Trump will unfairly receive half 
the amount of recognition from 
what was given to Obama.

With the inauguration a few 

days away, I urge everyone to take 
this into consideration: While you 
can fervently dispute someone in 
the political realm, it is important to 
recognize the good in someone as 
well. So, as President-elect Trump 
stands on the steps of the Capitol 
Friday morning with his family 
alongside 
him, 
remember 
the 

reasoning behind the praise Tuesday 
and, perhaps, apply it here.

Base tuition on expected earnings

SARAH SALMAN | OP-ED

E

arlier this year, my little 
sister 
approached 
me 

while I was enjoying a 

bowl of Honey Bunches of Oats 
with a particular announcement: 
“I want to major in art when I go 
to college.” Ever since she started 
middle school, art became her 
creative outlet. She would ask for 
distinct markers for Christmas, 
and the money she would save up 
from miscellaneous chores went 
into savings for a Wacom drawing 
tablet. So, this would have seemed 
like a reasonable declaration for 
someone who expresses so much 
passion for drawing, right? My 
immediate response: “Don’t.”

The average tuition for a 

public four-year college is $9,410. 
For out-of-state students, the 
cost rises to $23,890. Private 
four-year universities are even 
higher: $32,410. Student debt, 
meanwhile, 
has 
skyrocketed. 

The graduating class of 2015 
has most student debt in U.S. 
history. 
Students 
cumulatively 

owe lenders more than $1 trillion 
dollars. For someone planning 
to get a degree in art, is college 
worth the investment? Especially 
since graduates from art-focused 
schools seem to rack up the most 
student-loan debt. With this in 
mind, colleges should raise tuition 
accordingly to majors with higher 
expected lifetime earnings.

This wouldn’t even be an issue 

if colleges exclusively acted within 
the public sector — eliminating the 
cost completely. With even public 
universities functioning within the 
capitalistic model — boasting that 
it is the “one of the top 50 public 
universities” or offering more than 
“150 academic majors” like the 
University of Nebraska-Lincoln, 
for example — it is hard to claim 
that university’s sole motivation 
is to act in the best interest of the 
students. Universities have been 
increasingly moving toward a 
business model. In 1960, California 
residents had free tuition. Now if a 
student attended the University of 
California at Los Angeles, it would 
cost $27,987 for room and board for 
in-state students. With universities 
becoming more and more like 
big businesses and treating their 
students like customers, it makes 

sense for the consumers, students, 
to demand the best package deal 
with their education value. 

Moreover, it makes sense to 

hike up the price for engineering 
majors: It costs more. For example, 
in New York’s state colleges, hard 
sciences and engineering courses 
cost twice as much as fine/applied 
arts and five times as much as 
low-level psychology classes. That 
means that if someone wants 
to utilize the English courses 
or history courses, they would 
be paying for not just their own 
share/value, but for someone with 
a completely unrelated career path 
than their own. Imagine if you 
bought pizza with four friends. 
Each of you equally spent $2.99 
for this pizza. When the pizza 
comes, two of your four friends eat 
75 percent of that pizza whereas 
you and your other friend have to 
divide the rest of it. The system is 
inherently unfair. Why not change 
it? Wouldn’t it make sense for two 
of your friends to pay a little more 
for the pizza if they were going to 
use a greater amount of resource? 
The same applies to the university. 
It doesn’t make sense to go for a 
one-price-fits-all if other degrees 
are reaping more of the rewards.

The sad part is that engineering 

majors have a higher expected 
income after graduation than 
people who major in art. A system 
that taxes majors with higher 
expected lifetime earnings will 
allow people to pursue their 
passions rather than think about 
practicality. My sister absolutely 
loves art, but knowing the risks 
and high debt associated with 
the major, I was reluctant to fully 
support her decision. “Definitely 
pursue your passions,” I told 
her, “but consider majoring in 
computer science with a minor in 
art when you’re in college.” This 
was not the answer that she was 
expecting, but it was the most 
realistic one.

Not all share this sentiment. 

The Florida State Task Force also 
wants to vary tuition by majors 
— but in a completely different 
regard: 
pushing 
to 
decrease 

tuition for STEM majors and 
increase tuition in fields such as 
political science, anthropology 
and psychology. Its aim is to 
dissuade people from pursuing 
paths that are in much lower 
demand compared to STEM 

fields. The problem is that it 
may end up saddling people who 
pursue the social sciences and 
the humanities with an even 
greater burden of debt. Logically, 
it doesn’t make sense either. 
Majors such as political science 
or English do not teach to a 
specific career paths. Students 
who major in these fields find 
positions 
anywhere 
from 

being a barista to working in 
Washington headquarters. They 
are not guaranteed a lot of money 
on 
graduation, 
whereas 
the 

starting salary for someone with 
a degree in computer science can 
be six figures.

Additionally, it also suggests 

that these degrees are worth less 
than STEM. A stigma already 
perpetuated by popular culture, 
like the recent controversy with 
Wells Fargo ads implying that 
the arts are worth less than 
sciences. I remember telling an 
individual what I planned to 
major in college: “English.” The 
response: “Oh,” accompanied by 
the puzzled frown and “What are 
you planning to do with that?”

Increasing tuition for engineers 

and business majors may deter 
students from pursuing that path, 
opponents argue. It might. But 
that argument is fundamentally 
flawed. If paying extra for a 
biomedical engineering degree, 
for example, dissuades students, 
wouldn’t that logic play with 
the knowledge that the lifetime 
expected earnings for political 
science, for example, are lower 
than 
biomedical 
engineering 

also deter the same students for 
exactly those reasons?

My sister’s declaration plagued 

my mind. I always maintain 
follow your passion, but would 
that end up hurting her more than 
helping her? With a system that 
places a greater price-tag on more 
financially rewarding careers, 
my sister wouldn’t have to worry 
about being “practical” and would 
be able to actually do what she 
wants. As students, we must stop 
the one-price-fits-all philosophy 
and 
demand 
a 
progressive 

tuition. If universities continue to 
emulate big businesses, then we 
as customers should demand our 
fair share.

Trumpy the clown

NICHOLAS
TOMAINO

S

ometimes it’s refreshing to 
hear a distinction between 
America’s political parties 

that isn’t the hackneyed “liberals 
drive 
BMWs 
and 

conservatives 
drive 

pickup trucks” shtick. 
Other times, however, 
it can be a bit jarring, 
as you realize just 
how 
ideologically 

divergent 
the 
two 

parties are.

In 
2015, 
while 

campaigning for Rand 
Paul 
in 
Oklahoma, 

conservative 
politician J.C. Watts told writer 
Robert Leonard, “The difference 
between 
Republicans 
and 

Democrats is that Republicans 
believe people are fundamentally 
bad, while Democrats see people 
as fundamentally good.” It took 
me a while to determine what 
Watts meant by this, as he seemed 
at first to be revering Democrats 
for their kindness. Of course, as a 
Republican himself, he was not; he 
was calling them naive for putting 
their faith in people rather than a 
higher power.

I grew up in a conservative 

evangelical 
household 
that 

always emphasized the binary of 
saints and sinners. The mantra 
was something along the lines of 
“we’re all sinners, there is a desire 
to sin in all of us, and the only way 
we can become clean is through 
repentance and baptism.”

(Now, the notion that people are 

naturally inclined to be bad may 
seem hopelessly cynical, but when 
you believe your god is the purest 
thing there is, it’s actually kind 
of comforting. It’s like, the world 
sucks but someone will eventually 
save us from all of this suckage.)

I never once thought to apply 

this to politics, but doing so sheds 
an LED torch on Watts’ logic. 
Keeping in mind the fact that many 
Democrats are actually religious, I 
dissected this statement using the 
ethical tools bestowed upon me 
by a powerhouse team of Sunday 
school teachers (shoutout to you, 

Mrs. Wriston) in the first 13 years 
of my life.

My conclusion? The Republican 

ideology Watts evokes is not a 

holistic approach to 
solving 
the 
world’s 

problems — rather, it 
assumes that people are 
the world’s problems 
and ends the analysis 
there. This nature over 
nurture argument, I 
believe, is a cop-out 
and its infiltration of 
the 
political 
sphere 

has stripped rhetoric 
and, more importantly, 

policy of its compassion.

If people are essentially defined by 

their sins — the prostitute is lustful, 
the gang member is murderous, 
the poor are lazy — then it so easy 
to write people off, to dismiss their 
suffering as a choice rather than 
a product of circumstance. After 
all, what incentive do you have to 
eradicate sex trafficking, improve 
the conditions of inner cities or 
implement a more robust welfare 
program if you perceive those 
affected as having chosen their fate, 
as being characterized by their sin?

Take Ronald Reagan’s classic 

“welfare 
queen” 
speech, 
for 

example. Though the realities of 
an average welfare recipient are 
far more nuanced (and less classist 
and racist) than those of which the 
president spoke, he nonetheless 
managed to employ the effective 
conservative argument at the 
time, which involved evoking a 
caricature of deviance. The rhetoric 
that paints people — particularly 
those who are suffering or in need 
of government assistance — as 
one-dimensionally awful is useful 
in both religion and politics for 
the same reason: It justifies our 
inability or unwillingness to help 
them. In this case, if we assume 
individuals 
who 
use 
welfare 

programs do so by their own 
volition, and that they must be bad 
people who cheat the system, then 
we are absolved of blame (or even 
revered as heroes) when we take 
this system away from them.

Because the welfare queens of 

the world are few and far between, 
it is therefore not naive to inquire 
further into the actual motivations 
of so-called sinners. Aristotle made 
the argument that humans are 
fundamentally virtuous because 
no person causes harm with the 
intention of causing harm — in 
other words, people always assume 
their actions are for the greater 
good. 
However, 
one 
mustn’t 

necessarily subscribe to this in 
order to see the merit in helping 
others; they simply must consider 
how 
circumstances 
impact 

decisions, and how alleviation of 
certain circumstances through 
thoughtful policy can prevent 
people from making less-than-
desirable choices.

In his final blow, Watts went on 

to attribute this liberal tendency to 
over-empathize to our godlessness: 
“If we are our own God, as the 
Democrats say, then we need to 
look at something else to blame 
when things go wrong — not us.” 
The assumption here is that the 
decisions people make — good or 
bad — are isolated and deliberate 
rather than guided by (or a direct 
product of) their circumstances. 
That is not to say people should not 
ultimately be held accountable for 
the poor choices they make, but 
from a policy perspective, it seems 
counterproductive 
to 
suggest 

that there is nothing we can do to 
prevent people from making them.

Actions, after all, are not 

completely 
disconnected 
from 

their contexts — they are directly 
influenced by them. Politicians 
such as Watts and his constituents 
are in a unique position to shape 
the contexts that beget negative 
actions. 
By 
assuming 
these 

decisions will be made with or 
without their intervention, they 
are forfeiting their responsibility 
to make the world a better place. 
And that, more so than people, is 
pretty fundamentally bad.

Michigan in need of role players’ production

With a little more than 10 

minutes left in its game against 
Minnesota on Saturday, the 
Michigan hockey team trailed, 
3-0, and needed a spark.

While the Wolverines would 

normally rely on players like 
senior 
forward 
Alex 
Kile 

or 
freshman 
forward 
Will 

Lockwood to supply a key goal, 
instead they got help from some 
unlikely sources.

Sophomore forward Brendan 

Warren was just inside the 
blue line when he passed to 
freshman 
forward 
Steven 

Merl along the boards. Merl 
immedialley fired the puck at 
the net, and while it wasn’t a 
menacing shot, the puck slid 
past Minnesota goaltender Eric 
Schierhorn for the first goal of 
Merl’s his career.

Then, just six minutes later, 

senior 
forward 
Evan 
Allen 

tipped a shot from the point 
into the net for his first goal of 
the season, and Michigan was 
suddenly down only one.

The Wolverines’ comeback 

efforts would eventually fall 
short, but the offensive output 
from Allen and Merl provided 
the two players with some hope 
for the future.

“I finally got my (first) point 

in a while, so that always helps 
with the confidence,” Allen 
said. “And hockey’s all about 
confidence, so that helps a 
lot. And hopefully, I can take 
that moving forward into this 
weekend.”

Michigan has struggled to 

find successful offense this 
season. And while the most 
glaring examples of that come 
predominantly from the players 
on the top lines, like Kile — who 
were expected to produce at 
a high level — the fourth line 
has left Michigan coach Red 
Berenson with more questions 
than answers.

This has forced Berenson to 

shuffle multiple players in and 
out of the lineup seemingly 
every game.

“They’re competing for a job 

every week,” Berenson said. 
“We could have the same players 
on the fourth line every week 
if they’d separated themselves 
from the other guys. And then if 

they get in the lineup and they 
play well, then that gives them 
a chance to stay in the lineup or 
to get back into the lineup.”

The players understand this, 

too. With the constant changes 
in the lineup, 
it can be hard 
for the players 
involved in the 
substitutions 
to 
maintain 

confidence 
from 
game 

to 
game. 
For 

them, 
practice 

is not only an 
opportunity for 
them to prove 
themselves, but also a chance 
build confidence without the 
eyes of the Yost faithful on 
them.

“You have to play every 

practice like you’re getting 
ready for the game that weekend 
no matter if you’re in the lineup 
or not,” Merl said. “So that way 
when you do get called, you’re 

ready to go.”

Added Allen: “Confidence is 

something you’ve got to build 
off, it doesn’t just come. It’s got 
to come from your play and your 
teammates being behind you. 

So, that always 
helps when the 
teammates 
are 

behind you and 
the coaches are 
behind you and 
you get a few 
points here and 
there. 
But 
it 

also comes with 
playing hard and 
playing well. … 
There’s a lot of 

different factors, but once you 
get it, it’s nice to keep it on you.”

The duo’s play this weekend 

may be a step in the right 
direction for not just Allen and 
Merl, but also for the team as 
a whole. Because if the two of 
them can get results, it will take 
some of the pressure off the 
other forwards’ shoulders.

Berenson seems like he may 

reward the strong play against 
the Golden Gophers, especially 
in the case of Allen. Though 
lineups haven’t been officially 
set, Allen has been practicing 
with Kile and senior forward 
Max Shuart, who both played 
on the first line in Saturday’s 
game.

“I was really pleased that 

Evan Allen took a step last 
week,” Berenson said. “That’s 
what you’re looking for from 
those guys, is to step up. We 
didn’t think Evan Allen would 
be a fourth line player when 
we recruited him. … It’s about 
performance, really. It’s about 
performance every day, and 
then when you get a chance in 
games.”

With time still left this 

season, Allen and Merl will 
look to ride any momentum 
they have and earn more time 
on the ice. And if they do, they 
could provide the spark that the 
Wolverines desperately need.

Michigan dominates 
Hoosiers in dual meet

In its previous 15 consecutive 

Big Ten dual meets since the 
2013-14 season, the sixth-ranked 
Michigan women’s swimming 
and diving team (2-0 Big Ten, 3-1 
overall) has posted an impressive 
15-0 record. After Friday’s 211-
87 victory over No. 13 Indiana 
(1-1, 6-3), it seems Michigan’s 
winning streak isn’t showing any 
signs of stopping.

Following 
a 
strong 

performance 
in 
last 
week’s 

Orange Bowl Classic — where 
the team won all 12 events and 
set meet records in nine of them 
— the Wolverines rode their 
momentum into Bloomington 
and continued to post solid times 
against some of the fiercest 
competition they will face this 
season.

“We saw some women who 

needed to see themselves in a 
different light,” said Michigan 
coach Mike Bottom. “They’ve 
been looking at Indiana as a 
really, really good team, so to 
see how we (had 1-2-3 finishes) 
and (a 1-2-3-4 finish) in one 
event, the women gained a lot of 
confidence.”

Buoyed by a balanced attack, 

the Wolverines won 12 of 16 
events and went 1-2-3 in five of 
them. Four swimmers earned 
multiple 
individual 
victories, 

headlined by sophomore Siobhán 
Haughey (100-yard freestyle, 
200-yard 
freestyle, 
200-yard 

IM) and junior Clara Smiddy 
(100-yard backstroke, 200-yard 
backstroke).

“We will move forward on 

our team, not on any individual,” 
Bottom said. “Whether it be 
(sophomore) Rose Bi swimming 
the 100-yard breaststroke and 
getting second or (junior) Sam 
Yeo getting third in the 200 IM, 
those are points for Michigan, 
and that is how we will move 
forward.”

Bi added wins in both the 500 

and 1000-yard freestyle races, 
and her 9:43.77 in the latter 
was almost 15 seconds faster 
than the second-place finisher. 
Usually a distance specialist, the 
sophomore was mere seconds 
behind Indiana star Lilly King in 

the 100-yard breaststroke.

Keeping up with King, the 

two-time 2016 Rio Olympics 
gold medalist, was an important 
takeaway for the Wolverines, 
encouraging them to trust in 
their abilities even more.

“Lilly King is the name in 

our sport right now, and we 
had breaststrokers who, yes, 
got beat by her, but it wasn’t the 
pouncing we expected,” Bottom 
said. “So even that, to stay in 
range of a superstar like that, 
we gained confidence from that, 
and that’s what we need heading 
into the Big Tens and NCAA 
Tournament.”

Reigning Big Ten Freshman 

of the Week Vanessa Krause 
— who has already captured 
the award three times this 
season — continued to impress 
with individual wins in both 
the 100 and 200-yard butterfly 
events. The Indiana native, who 
was cheered on by her entire 
family, credited her familiarity 
with 
Indiana’s 
Counsilman-

Billingsley Aquatics Center as an 
advantage. This experience paid 
dividends, as Krause narrowly 
prevailed by .06 and .5 seconds, 
respectively.

While winning is a bonus at 

dual meets, they are primarily 
used as barometers for teams to 
analyze their performances and 
see where they stand midway 
through the season.

“They’re a good check for us to 

see what is working and what we 
need to improve on,” Haughey 
said. “After dual meets, we have 
some time to go back to our own 
pool and work on things that we 
have to work on.”

Even after a dominant victory, 

the ability to make adjustments 
and tune the finer details of 
a swimmer’s race is essential 
for Michigan, especially in the 
stretch run.

“This win definitely boosted 

our confidence, but you never 
know who’s going to come 
out strong at (the Big Ten 
Championships), so we always 
have to be ready and can’t let 
up,” Krause said. “They say you 
have to work hard up until the 
last race, so we have to make sure 
we’re putting in the work before 
conferences.”

An endless gratitude

To 
the 
loyal 
Michigan 

community —

I would be remiss to leave 

Michigan 
after 
five 
years 

without thanking you all for 
everything you have done for me. 
This school and community has 
supported me since the moment 
I signed my letter of intent and 
I can only hope to express a 
fraction of my gratitude in this 
letter. 

I would like to begin by 

thanking 
Coach 
Harbaugh, 

Coach Brown, Coach Mattison, 
the trainers, equipment staff 
and support staff that worked 
tirelessly to help me succeed 
each and every week. You all had 
a hand in helping me realize that 
my dream of becoming an NFL 
player could become a reality. 
I leave Ann Arbor a better 
person and player than when I 
first arrived, and it is due to the 
amazing support my teammates 

and I had surrounding us every 
day. I would also like to thank 
Coach Hoke for recruiting me 
to the school of my dreams and 
giving me the opportunity to 
become a Wolverine. 

Michigan football fans are 

some of the most proud and 
passionate fans in all of college 
football. 
Your 
unwavering 

support means so much to us. 
 

You filled the Big House every 
single week with maize and blue 
and supported us no matter the 
outcome of each game. 

I would also like to thank my 

academic 
advisor, 
Claiborne 

Greene, 
for 
his 
help 
and 

guidance over the past five years. 
Thank you to all of my professors 
and peers for supporting me in 
and out of the classroom each 
day. I am proud to have earned 
a degree from such a prestigious 
university.

Thank you to all of my 

teammates who I have had the 
honor and privilege of playing 
with for five seasons. We have 
shared so many memories and 
created a brotherhood on and off 
the field. Your faith in me to lead 
this team as a captain my final 
season means the world to me. I 
hope the bonds we have built and 
friendships that we made will 
continue for years to come. 

Finally, thank you to my 

family and girlfriend for your 
constant love and support. You 
have inspired me and continue 
to be my motivation for success 
every day.

While this may end my time 

as a student athlete at Michigan, 
I will never stop bleeding maize 
and blue. I hope to return to 
Michigan 
Stadium 
and 
sing 

“Hail to the Victors” alongside 
all of you for seasons to come. 

Go Blue!

Wolverines open indoor season
in Simmons-Harvey Invitiational 

While the Simmons-Harvey 

Invitational 
signaled 
the 

beginning of the 2017 indoor 
season for the Michigan men’s 
and women’s track and field 
teams, it also marked the final 
collegiate competition in the U-M 
Indoor Track Building after 43 
years in use. Going forward, the 
Wolverines will compete in the 
Stephen Ross Athletic Complex 
when it is completed in fall 2017.

“I’ve been here since 1976,” 

said women’s coach James Henry. 
“There are a lot of things that I’ve 
seen here, and there are a lot of 
great, great memories.”

The women’s team came out 

strong, notching four event titles 
and 15 personal records on the 
day. The Wolverines dominated in 
the first event of the competition, 
taking the top four spots in the 
high jump, with junior Claire 
Kieffer-Wright taking the victory 
after clearing a height of 1.7 
meters.

“It’s a good place to start for 

me, to shake off the rust,” Kieffer-
Wright said. “There’s more to 
come, but I think tomorrow 
waking up I’ll feel good about 
what I did today.”

Other impressive performances 

in the field events came from 
Michigan’s 
throwers. 
In 
the 

weight throw, freshman Courtney 
Jacobsen tied for first place with 
a throw of 17.94 meters. She 
eventually lost the tiebreaker, 
though resulting in a second place 
finish.

In the shot put, the Wolverines 

claimed three of the top seven 
spots, with junior Kayla Deering 
setting a personal record with a 
throw of 13.46 meters, good for 
second place.

Michigan excelled in the track 

events as well. Six Wolverines set 
personal bests in the one-mile 
contest, including junior Erin 
Finn, whose time of 4:39.76 placed 
her in third.

The Wolverines also came away 

with victories in the 60-meter, 
400-meter, and 600-meter events. 
In the 60-meter race, freshman 
Torisa Johnson won with a time of 
7.54 seconds. Racing 400 meters, 
freshman Jade Harrison led the 
entire way, finishing in a time of 
55.88 seconds. In the 600-meter 
contest, freshman Julia Hall won 
in 1:35.65, an impressive 6.46 
seconds ahead of the second-place 
competitor.

“I’m happy because it was my 

first college race ever,” Hall said. 
“It’s back to training, because 
I want to do better, but overall 
I’m excited about the start of the 
season and happy about where it 
started.”

While 
recognizing 
that 

improvements still need to be 
made, Henry was impressed with 
the unity and hard work his team 
displayed.

“Across the board, in every 

single event, we had kids have 
personal bests,” Henry said. “If 
this is any indication of how we’re 
going to do, I’m excited for the 
next meet and beyond.”

Not to be outshone by their 

female counterparts, the men’s 
team claimed victory in five 
events, and set seven personal 
records on the day.

“After you get through the first 

meet, there’s going to be a lot of 
adjustments,” said men’s coach 
Jerry Clayton. “But overall it was 
a solid first day.”

The Wolverines’ first victory 

came in the shot put, where junior 
Grant Cartwright’s best throw 
traveled 18.32 meters, a full 1.53 

meters ahead of the second place 
finisher.

“You kind of look at each meet 

as a building block,” Cartwright 
said. “I felt like, as a team, we did 
a pretty good job of putting down 
a good foundation for our season 
today.”

Also 
in 
the 
field 
events, 

sophomore Joe Ellis finished 
first in the weight throw with a 
distance of 21.05 meters, while 
Cartwright set a personal best 
with a toss of 20.09 meters, good 
for second place. In the pole vault, 
Michigan’s competitors finished 
fourth through sixth, with junior 
Kevin Haughn, senior Steven 
Bastien, and sophomore Nicholas 
Burkhalter each setting personal 
records in the event.

The Wolverines had a strong 

showing in the track events as 
well, where senior Drake Johnson 
won the 60-meter hurdles with a 
time of 7.97 seconds.

“For him (Johnson) to break 

eight seconds the first time out,” 
Clayton said. “On the track, 
that was probably our most 
outstanding performance there.”

In 
the 
800-meter 
race, 

sophomore 
Matt 
Plowman 

finished in first with a time 
of 1:56.06. In the mile run, 
sophomore Kevin Hall came in 
first, clocking in at 4:15.39.

“Although I’m happy that I 

won, and it’s a good start, there’s 
definitely a lot more to do,” Hall 
said. “More than anything, it’s 
just a motivator for the rest of the 
season.”

While both teams recognized 

that this meet served more as 
a stepping stone for the rest of 
the season, the competitors and 
coaches alike were happy to 
perform well as a final farewell 
to their longtime their longtime

“Can we rest on today? No,”

Michigan to face Terrapins
with chance at marquee win

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team has hit its stride 
in Big Ten play, 
but a daunting 
obstacle stands 
in the way as it 
looks to upset 
No. 3 Maryland 
on Thursday.

The 
third-

ranked 
Terrapins’ (5-0 
Big Ten, 17-1 
overall) 
only 

loss this season 
came 
at 
the 

hand of No. 1 
Connecticut 
on 
Dec. 
29, 

narrowly falling, 87-81.

The last time the Wolverines 

(4-1, 15-4) met Maryland was 
last season, when the sixth-
ranked Terrapins ran away with 
a 20-point win in College Park. 
But with new offensive weapons 
along with momentum, Michigan 
knows it just has to stick to its 
gameplan.

“We’re very excited to play a 

great team like Maryland,” said 
senior guard Siera Thompson. 
“We come in that game like we 
come into every game: Preparing, 
scouting, learning their tendencies 
and just trying to stop their great 
players.”

For 
Michigan 
to 
remain 

competitive 
against 
such 
an 

elite team, it will have to match 
the success of its two previous 
matchups against Indiana and 
Minnesota, with four players 
scoring into the double-digits. The 
Wolverines are thriving with their 
current offensive balance, as they 
came in ranked 29th in this week’s 
AP poll.

In other words, Michigan needs 

its stars to play to their potential 
— especially Hallie Thome, who 

is coming off a commanding 
20-point, 17-rebound game against 
the Golden Gophers.

The sophomore center will have 

the toughest matchup of the game, 
battling against Maryland center 
Brionna Jones. While Thome has 
a height advantage, Jones has been 
dominant in the post, averaging 
19.5 points and 10.4 rebounds. 
Jones’ performance has earned 
her three Big Ten Player of the 
Week honors this year and most 
recently, the ESPNW National 
Player of the Week.

“They rebound the ball well,” 

said Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “… I think it’s going to be key 
for us to hold them to one shot, to 
be able to defend (Brionna Jones), 
and rebound with them.”

The Wolverines will have their 

hands full if Jones controls the 
paint or if Thome gets into early 
foul trouble, and will have to rely 
more heavily on outside shooting. 
Michigan, though, has no shortage 
of prolific shooters. Junior guard 
Katelynn Flaherty and freshman 
guard Kysre Gondrezick have 
spearheaded a productive offense 
that owns the second-best 3-point 
field goal percentage in the 
country.

“As long as we scout them and 

know their tendencies I think 
we’ve got a good shot at them,” 
Flaherty said after Sunday’s game 
against Minnesota. “If we played 
like we did in the first half (against 
Minnesota), then we a have shot to 
play with anyone in the country.”

Unfortunately 
for 
the 

Wolverines, the Terrapins also 
have a slew of effective scorers that 
have wreaked havoc on opposing 
defenses this season. Guards 
Shatori Walker-Kimbrough and 
Destiny Slocum have been a 
dynamic one-two punch from the 
perimeter, collectively knocking 
down over 40 percent of their 
3-pointers. As a do-it-all 5-foot-11 
guard, Walker-Kimbrough will 

also pose a matchup problem for 
junior forward Jillian Dunston if 
she can’t stay out of foul trouble.

An upset over Maryland would 

surely be one of Michigan’s 
biggest wins in program history, 
especially for a team that has 
done everything right thus far in 
hopes of snapping its three-year 
NCAA 
Tournament 
drought. 

But few teams have been able to 
muster any success against the 
Terrapins, and a loss would barely 
be a setback on the Wolverines’ 
tournament resume.

The same can’t be said about 

Michigan’s 
contest 
Sunday 

against 
Nebraska 
(1-5, 
5-13). 

Barring extreme circumstances, 
the Wolverines should be able to 
top the Cornhuskers with ease. 
Nebraska is tied with Wisconsin 
for the worst Big Ten record 
overall and has lost its conference 
matchups by an average of 14.5 
points.

The lone bright spot for the 

Cornhuskers 
has 
been 
their 

low-post presence, led by 6-foot-
4 
forward 
Jessica 
Shepherd. 

Shepherd is the only double-digit 
scorer on the team, averaging a 
double-double with 18.6 points 
and 10.3 boards.

Similar to the matchup with 

Maryland, Thome will be the 
busiest Wolverine on the court, 
as it will be her responsibility to 
keep Shepherd in check. But given 
Thome’s current dominance in 
Big Ten play, the matchup will 
definitely be one to keep an eye on.

“As long as (Thome) is in the 

game, she’ll do great things for 
us,” Flaherty said. “She opens up 
the court for our guards (and) 
she’s very much improved on her 
rebounding game.”

Regardless of what happens 

in the paint, the Wolverines are 
simply more talented on both sides 
of the basketball and should leave 
Lincoln with one more tally in the 
win column.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

Simpson seeing new opportunities
as freshman campaign continues

Michigan men’s basketball 

coach John Beilein says you’d 
laugh at how many times his 
freshman point guard Xavier 
Simpson begs to play.

The Lima, Ohio native came 

to Ann Arbor as the No. 48 
recruit in the country, but has 
struggled to adapt to the pace 
of play in the NCAA.

Still, 
these 
transitional 

difficulties 
haven’t 
stopped 

him from wanting to play in big 
moments.

“He has the attitude of a 

winner,” 
Beilein 
said. 
“He 

wants to be good, he wants his 
team to be good. He has a lot 
of energy on the bench. He’s 
trying to get ready and little by 
little, that’s our hope.”

And as the Big Ten season 

progressed, Simpson has gotten 
his chance.

In two of Michigan’s five 

conference games, Walton has 
picked up two fouls in the first 
half, forcing Beilein to give 
extended minutes to his first-
year point guard.

While the newfound playing 

time may not have paid off 
as much as Beilein hoped, he 
has noticed the progression 
of Simpson’s play and most 
importantly, 
his 
confidence. 

That much was evident in the 
players-only meeting that was 
called by senior guard Derrick 
Walton Jr. the night before 
the Wolverines’ game against 
Nebraska last Saturday.

“Actually, 
shockingly, 
we 

had our freshman, Xavier, step 
up and speak,” Walton said. “I 
think that’s great.”

Realistically, situations like 

Saturday night’s are expected. 
Coming out of high school as a 
pass-first point guard and Ohio 
Mr. Basketball, one of Simpson’s 
best traits on his scouting report 
was his leadership ability. The 
same scouting report, though, 
described Simpson as just a 
“good” shooter. 

“Most point guards are going 

to be pass-first guys,” Beilein 

said. “They can shoot and they 
can score, but they’re looking 
to set up others. So that’s his 
mindset right now — ‘How can 
I make others better around 
me,’ and ‘How can I go down 
and give Derrick a rest and play 
great defense while I’m at it?’

But Beilein wants Simpson 

to bring more to the table than 
just passing.

While Simpson may not be 

ready to play 30 to 40 minutes 
a night, Beilein understands his 
role on the team.

“It’s hard to ever expect 

anything from a freshman,” 
Beilein said. “I never really 
expect it, being a freshman and 
come in and (play) like a Trey 
Burke. That’s so rare that they 
just come in, and they’re game 
ready at this level.”

As 
Beilein 
stated, 
Burke 

was an outlier. He came to 
Michigan with a level of talent 
and “swagger” that allowed 
him to claim the 2011-12 Big 

Ten Freshman Player of the 
Year award, which hadn’t been 
won by a Michigan player in 
nine years.

For most, though, the path 

to conference awards is an 
arduous one, and Beilein also 
understands that developing a 
point guard like Walton over a 
four-year period takes time.

“We’re trying to develop 

him as quickly as we can,” 
Beilein said. “But it’s not easy 
for a freshman. He’s making 
developments everyday, and he 
knows and I know that he has 
a long way to go. He works his 
tail off, and that’s all we can ask 
for.”

While Simpson may not be 

a point guard of Trey Burke’s 
caliber just yet, Beilein put it 
best when he said Simpson’s job 
at the moment is to fill in for 
Walton while also playing good 
defense.

And so far, he’s doing a good 

job of it.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

The internet is, and always has 

been, a weird place.

I’ll elaborate: The internet has 

developed into an uninhibited 
digital space where anyone, no 
matter how weird or strange one’s 
taste, can express oneself in any way 
one wants. Users can feel as if they 
are part of a community without 
actually physically interacting with 
it. Given this autonomy, the most 
avid of users can explore the World 
Wide Web and end up traveling 
through an infinite amount of 
virtual rabbit holes. Some get lost 
in watching YouTube conspiracies 
for hours on end, while others 
delve deep into Reddit forums 
and the never-ending abyss that is 
Wikipedia.

But what is most intriguing 

about the internet is how its online 
communities have developed into 
individualized subcultures. Weird 
Twitter, in particular, is one such 
subculture, in which a loosely 
connected group of Twitter users 
create a series of statuses that can 
be absurdist, bizarre, meta and 
straight-up nonsensical. Somehow, 
Weird 
Twitter 
has 
managed 

to attract a wide underground 
audience. If you’re an avid Twitter 
user, like I am, you’re likely 
following a Weird Twitter account 
without even realizing it.

To describe Weird Twitter in this 

way, however, is oversimplifying 
the concept as a whole. It’s not 
just a collection of snarky users 
mocking modern society through 
odd posts on Twitter. Rather, it’s a 
postmodern, underground, cyber-
cultural movement that is almost 
impossible to categorize through 
just one definition. The Awl’s Ken 
Layne called it “(an) intentionally 
wrong style of idiotic comedy.” The 
Daily Dot’s Fernando Alfonso III 
deemed it “a burgeoning comedy 
subculture.” Sebastian Benthall of 
the blog Digifesto claimed it was 
“aleatoric poetry.” The New York 
Times described it as “inane” and 
posited that early adopters of Weird 
Twitter used “inside humor to 
subtly mock the site’s corporate and 
mainstream users.”

Perhaps 
Slacktory.com’s 

definition 
is 
the 
closest 

representation 
of 
Weird 

Twitter, 
particularly 
in 

its 
description 
of 
Weird 

Twitter’s 
distinctive 
aesthetic 

appeal: 
“Sloppy 
punctuation/

spelling/capitalization, 
poetic 

experimentation 
with 
sentence 

format, 
first-person 
throwaway 

characters, and other techniques 
little known to the vast majority of 
‘serious’ Twitter users.”

While Weird Twitter has grown 

more popular in the past few years, 
the origins of its school of thought, 
so to speak, date back even before 
the site’s existence. In 2002, the 
website 
SomethingAwful.com 

created an exclusive subforum 
titled FYAD (short for Fuck You 
and Die, of course), which was 
arguably a precursor to Weird 
Twitter. Like Weird Twitter, FYAD 
was 
known 
for 
incorporating 

brevity, surrealism, lack of context 
and ironic humor into the content 
produced by its users. The subforum 
no longer lives — though there’s a 
best-of collection that exists — but 
FYAD certainly prompted users of 
Something Awful to utilize their 
voices on other free-form platforms 
like the controversial forum site 
4chan. 
Eventually, 
however, 

Twitter would become the more 
mainstream site that hosted and 
popularized this kind of small, 
niche community.

One of the earliest examples of 

Weird Twitter as a concept came 
from a guy named Jon Hendren, 
who created his Twitter account 
@fart (119k followers) in 2008. He 
garnered online attention when 
he posted this status in May 2012: 
“i saw an ad on craigslist once that 
said ‘free firewood, u collect it’ so 
i wrote the guy and said ‘bud you 
just wrote an ad for the woods.’ ” 
It’s this kind of random, deadpan 
and guffaw-inducing post that 
represents one of the many facets of 
a vaguely inexplicable concept like 
Weird Twitter.

After that status blew up, Weird 

Twitter gradually proliferated into 
the baffling marvel that it is today. 
Accounts like @Seinfeld2000 (137k 
followers), @Horse_ebooks (177k 
followers), @dril (470k followers) 
and @NYTMinusContext (147k 
followers) have become popular 
among consumers of the subculture. 
Each 
of 
these 
accounts 
are 

idiosyncratic in their own way, yet 
they share a similar self-awareness 
in making intentionally stupid or 
eccentric tweets. Even stand-up 
comedian Brandon Wardell (74.8k 
followers), hip-hop artist Lil B 

(1.35m followers) and actor/writer 
Rob Delaney (1.33m followers) could 
be considered part of Weird Twitter. 
Wardell integrates his abbreviated, 
text-message-like vernacular with 
hilarious, thought-provoking quips 
about pop culture, while Lil B puts 
his signature on almost every one 
of his bizarre tweets, suggesting 
that he is, in fact, Lil B and not some 
online bot. Alernatively, Delaney 
was an early user of Weird Twitter, 
but due to the success of his Amazon 
show “Catastrophe,” he has merged 
into the mainstream part of Twitter 
and become more outspoken on hot-
button political issues.

Weird Twitter is as entertaining 

and bewildering as it is amoebic 
and ineffable. Critics may just 
pass it off as unimportant jargon 
or a pretentious display of how 
millennials communicate online. 
On the contrary, Weird Twitter 
offers a creative, comedic space 
for some of the internet’s most 
sarcastic, 
anti-intellectual 
and 

angsty voices. As Buzzfeed’s John 
Herrman and Katie Notopoulos 
noted in their comprehensive 2013 
oral history of Weird Twitter, it is 
“where the language of Twitter gets 
created, where its funniest jokes 
come from, and where its worst 
tendencies are isolated, rebroadcast, 
and sometimes destroyed.” Weird 
Twitter is uniquely insular not only 
in how it transcends the normal 
barriers of the internet with its 
unusual, off beat discourse, but also 
in how it critiques other users.

Since 2014, a committee of 

several 
Weird 
Twitter-like 

accounts led by The Tourney 
Organizer, a member of the group, 
engage in a March Madness style 
online tournament called the Shit 
Account Tourney. The objective 
of the SAT is simple: choose the 
worst, shittiest Twitter account of 
the year. According to an article 
from New York Magazine, the top 
picks from 2015’s SAT included 
the overtly patriotic Cloyd Rivers, 
conservative actor James Woods, 
Trayvon Martin killer George 
Zimmerman and The Tweet of 
God, an account that imagines what 
God’s Twitter account would look 
like. The foursome were deemed 
the “Fuccboi Four.”

The 16 contenders of this past 

year’s SAT were divided into 
regions that were named based on 
each account’s level of “shittiness.” 
With the intense politics of 2016, 
pro-Trump 
conservatives 
on 

Twitter, like online commentator 
Mike 
Cernovich, 
dominated 

the “cuck” region, while vocal 
Hillary Clinton supporters, like 
“Jeopardy!” winner Arthur Chu, 
commanded the “headass” region. 
For those confused by the terms 
“cuck” and “headass,” both are 
pejorative terms that are often used 
on Twitter. The former denotes 
someone perceived as emasculated 
and the latter is defined by Urban 
Dictionary as a bothersome person 
who uses “constant social faux pas, 
obnoxious mannerisms, unrealistic 
expectations 
and 
general 

ineptitude” in their tweets. 

Given these accounts are based 

around political opinions, it’s easy 
to assume the SAT committee is 
biased when it comes to judging 
accounts. But according to an SAT 
Committee Member (who declined 
to provide his name or handle, but 
whom we will refer to as Kevin), 
the tournament is judged relatively 
fairly and the judges do their best 
to critique an account more on its 
quality than on its political views.

“We’re all good buds, but have 

political opinions all over the 
spectrum, which helps to make 
a fair tourney,” Kevin wrote in 
a direct message interview on 
Twitter. “The only thing that truly 
matters is how bad your account is, 
not whether you support free trade 
or some political bullshit.”

In addition to the “cuck” and 

“headass” 
regions, 
there’s 
the 

“Patreon” region, consisting of 
“woke” 
feminists 
(actor 
Matt 

McGorry, writer Sady Doyle), and 
the “spirit cooking” region, which is 
made up of athletes and celebrities 
who tweet too much (“Dilbert” 
creator Scott Adams, actresses 
Lena Dunham and Amy Schumer). 
By making a democratic process, 
the SAT committee allows Twitter 
users to vote via Twitter polls and 
determine who has the shittiest 
account. And with a tight race 
between Cernovich, Chu, former 
Hillary 
Clinton 
adviser 
Peter 

Daou and New York Times best-
selling author Kurt Eichenwald, 
Eichenwald 
was 
crowned 
the 

winner of the 2016 Shit Account 
Tourney.

In regards to what actually 

makes a shit account “shit,” another 
committee member, who wished 
to be named Paul, mentioned that 
it depends on “how thin-skinned 
they are, proportional to the size of 

their platform or their actual offline 
power.”

Weird Twitter accounts and 

tournament organizers, like writer 
Sam 
Grady 
(@TheSamGrady), 

believe the SAT “offers a form 
of entertaining self-policing to a 
community that for too long has 
gotten away with parading around 
awful content that plebes eat up.”

Similarly, the Tourney organizer 

believes that the SAT is a fun 
experience, saying “the humor of 
the Tourney itself is to illuminate 
that online opinions are mostly 
shitty.” The Tourney’s purpose, 
according to the Tourney trganizer, 
is to mock these people but “allow 
the general population to decide 
who is the shittiest.”

Though most might classify 

these accounts as Weird Twitter, 
Paul and The Tourney Organizer 
don’t consider themselves as such.

“I don’t think the committee 

is 
really 
‘weird-twitter,’” 
Paul 

wrote. “Most of us don’t have tons 
of followers or put a lot of time or 
thought into our jokes. We just riff 
on dumb shit.”

He also suggested, even, that 

the tourney is “not there for Weird 
Twitter, or any other specific 
faction. It’s basically for the people 
who spend a decent amount of time 
on here.”

Despite 
these 
contradictory 

statements, Weird Twitter can play 
a pivotal role in shaping the SAT 
for some, especially with Grady. As 
a struggling writer who joined the 
Weird Twitter community in 2011, 
Grady believes the movement and 
the SAT are much more relevant 
than we give them credit for. He 
believes Weird Twitter and the 
SAT “allow us to get above the 
BS of feigned manners and fake 
sincerity 
and 
really 
critically 

examine some of the accounts on 
here who genuinely add nothing to 
the larger conversation aside from 
ego stroking and creating a mass 
hug-box.”

This internal conflict of Weird 

Twitter’s identity brings up an 
interesting 
existential 
question. 

If certain accounts that would 
be considered part of the Weird 
Twitter community don’t identify 
as such, then what exactly is 
Weird Twitter? And if the SAT is 
not a product of Weird Twitter, 
then how and where does it fit in 
within the larger paradigm of the 
Twitter community?As a genre 
of online humor, Weird Twitter 
seems concerned with provoking 
the most bewildered reactions from 
people. But as a postmodern online 
subculture, Weird Twitter lacks an 
inherent unity and thus remains 
divided, with some believing it 
doesn’t exist anymore and others 
saying the opposite. It’s quite a 
paradox. 

What will become of Weird 

Twitter in the following years, 
where our president-elect reigns 
supreme as one of the most 
excessively active and aggressive 
Twitter users? According to Grady, 
Weird Twitter seems to be headed 
in a somewhat more political 
direction.

“The future of this subculture 

is one in which mainstream, left-
wing, political thought and online 
discourse begin to more and more 
look like the Chapo (Trap House) 
crew,” Grady wrote.

Chapo 
Trap 
House, 
an 

irreverent leftist podcast created 
by three Weird Twitter users (@
ByYourLogic, @cushbomb and @
willmenaker) during the election 
season, is one such example for how 
Weird Twitter can play a significant 
part within the larger realm of the 
internet. The podcast has garnered 
both ire and praise from the online 
community 
for 
its 
pointedly 

humorous and scathing attacks on 
both liberals and conservatives. It 
represents one of the many products 
of Weird Twitter that highlight 
the movement’s potential political 
utility.

“We already see it in the alt-

right,” Grady continued, “a kind 
of ironic detachment from sincere 
belief that will replace genuine 
ideology. A kind of hysterical-realist 
ubiquitous media nightmare where 
all cultural iconography is reduced 
to complete meaninglessness. I 
don’t think that’s a bad thing.”

The fate of Weird Twitter, and 

the greater online community at 
large, is still uncertain. But it’s hard 
not to recognize how something 
that was once deemed just a crude, 
exclusive form of online humor has 
become a social phenomenon today. 
It’s also terrifying to think of how 
something like Weird Twitter can 
cause such a blunt impact on online 
culture. But eventually, as Kevin 
pointed out, everyone is going to 
have to log off.

“Twitter is a great website, but 

you can only be on it for so long 
before your brain melts, for good.”

I have been staring into the 

abyss for a while now. And 
honestly, I’m not sure it’s staring 
back. It might be, but really it’s a 
bit difficult to tell. The abyss’ gaze 
seems to wander over a whole 
lot, and to say I’m a particular 
focus probably isn’t correct. To 
be completely frank, it might be 
looking at any number of things 
— 
underwhelming 
sentient 

televisions, 
rapid-fire 
false 

equivalencies, speculative urban 
development, etc. — but I can’t tell 
what because the abyss is sporting 
a pair of pixelated sunglasses.

This abyss is named @Dril, by 

the way.

@Dril lives in the dimly lit 

corners of the Twitter-verse, 
little-reached regions that are 
entirely alien to me. He’s one of the 
most famous of a loose collection 
of people casually referred to as 
“Weird Twitter,” a sort of Internet 
sub-culture 
that, 
until 
now, 

hasn’t intersected with my own 
existence. Somehow, despite living 
in an age in which it’s the favored 
vehicle of invective for a certain 
former reality television star, I 
have never so much as entered 
the Twitter URL before this week 
(which is why, I suppose, I’ve been 
asked to write this). So to plunge 
headfirst into the phenomenon 
of Weird Twitter has been sort 
of like trying to watch a Samuel 
Beckett play after first imbibing 
a couple hundred micrograms of 
Tim Leary’s favorite nutritional 
supplement.

Weird 
Twitter 
itself, 
I’ve 

learned, is a sort of amorphous 
collection 
of 
typically 

pseudonymous 
Twitter-users 

who have a penchant for the 
bizarre, satirical, absurd and 
generalized drollery. In short, 
they’re the sort of crowd who in 
all likelihood would mirthfully 
mock and roll their eyes at what 
I’m about to try to do, i.e., “get” 
them. But they’re probably not 
going to read this anyway, so here 
goes.

After careful consideration, 

I 
have 
concluded 
that 
the 

existence and ethos of Weird 
Twitter — like most everything 
else — perfectly align with my 
Almost Comprehensive Theory 
of Existence in the Postmodern 
American Era.

But 
seriously, 
while 
the 

ACTEPAE doesn’t actually exist, 
I do think there are a number 
of 
characteristics 
of 
Weird 

Twitter that can be viewed as 
microcosms of society at large, 
particularly in regard to the socio-
political developments of the 
last few decades (and especially 
the last few months). The most 
prevalent of these is probably the 
overwhelming ubiquity of irony.

We live in a culture that’s 

saturated with sarcasm. I won’t 
bother listing many examples 
because it’s next to impossible that 
you don’t know what I’m talking 
about, but to give one, there’s the 
fact that for nine years one of 
the most watched late-night TV 
shows (“The Colbert Report”) 
starred a character who literally 
never spoke unironically. My own 
generation, in particular, seems to 
be extraordinarily deft at this sort 
of thing — and I include myself in 
that characterization. It’s certainly 
not uncommon for me to have an 
entire conversation with a friend 
using the sort of straight-tone 
sarcasm that leaves some people 
from older generations (e.g., my 
mother) baffled at the turn of the 
talk. We’re the generation who 
can casually suggest that the 
appropriate retributive response 
to a perceived slight is an action 
that would make Hammurabi look 
like the author of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, 
all without our conversational 
partner batting an eye.

Hardly ever would our words 

be regarded as literal by our 
peers. Despite the fact that we no 
longer go through the same type 
of baroque contortions to signify 
our use of sarcasm, as did previous 
groups, 
we 
almost 
perfectly 

understand one another. We have 
developed our own subdermal 
language beneath the spoken/
written word, a jargon built as 
an imago to the vernacular. One 
discerns intent primarily through 
anticipation of insincerity.

The reasons why we do this 

are more opaque, but I grow more 
and more convinced as time goes 
on that irony today principally 
functions as an antidote to (or 
fortification against) pain. No 
matter what your politics are, 
most of us can agree that the 
world today is generally what 
could be classified as “screwed 
up” — and while we might know, 
objectively, that it’s on the whole 
a lot better than it was in the past, 
we feel acutely all the anxieties 
and discomforts of living in a 
flawed planet that increasingly 
appears to lead an absurd and 
meaningless existence in the 
galactic 
boondocks. 
Almost 

certainly this collective existential 
dread stems from the newfound 
interconnectivity of the world, 
and the omnipresence of 24-hour 
mass media, but knowledge of the 
conduits doesn’t do anything to 
mitigate the feeling. But coming 
at this pain obliquely via irony 
certainly takes off the edge.

Explanations 
as 
to 
why 

(with respect to the “screw[ed] 
up[ness]”) 
differ 
greatly, 
of 

course, but my personal view is, 
to a great extent, derived from 
observations about the culture of 
postmodernity, especially in this 
country. To me, one of our main 
problems lies in the misalignment 
of our value systems, which 
springs principally from our 
economic model. For instance, 
in contemporary parlance the 
words “value” (n. in the financial 
sense) and worth (n. in the 
definitional sense) have come to 
be inextricably bound-up with 
one another, circuitously leading 
to such absurdities as a belief in 
the automatic virtue of the rich, 
or the cult of wealth — warped 
perspectives 
that 
no 
doubt 

contributed to the calamitous 
consummation our country will 
be undergoing tomorrow at noon.

Though it’s not as if this mindset 

is new: Albert Camus noted it 
in his day, remarking, “A man 
wants to earn money in order to 
be happy, and his whole effort and 
the best of a life are devoted to the 
earning of that money. Happiness 
is forgotten; the means are taken 
for the end.” A person confuses the 
value of something with its worth, 
and sets up the false equation of 
“money = happiness.” These same 
concerns that troubled Camus 
when he was developing his views 
on absurdism are pertinent today.

And it’s not just this value vs. 

worth confusion that’s the issue 
in postmodern life — one of the 
worst culprits in our collective 
malcontentment is the sheer 
biting dullness of it all. Most of 
us go through our limited days 
following 
an 
unimaginative 

rubric that goes something like 
this: childhood, high school, 
college, nine-to-five job, spouse, 
kids, social security paycheck, 
retirement and la fin. In our free 
time we’re concerned with our 
lawns, our houses, our cars, the 
next winner of The Voice and 
all the other humdrum bullshit 
that’s part of a standard-issue 
postmodern existence c. 2017. 
 

We use these minutiae to try to 
find fulfillment, but somehow it 
still eludes our grasp — hence, the 
perception that it’s all “screwed 
up.”

Throw a bit of the recent 

political scene into the mix and 
it just exacerbates the problem. 
The colossal absurdity of it all 
still makes one’s mind spin. 
We’ve come to such a point in 
our crisis of culture that the 
previously 
referenced 
former 

reality television star has been 
selected to lead the free world. 
That such a man, who is easily 
the most mendacious candidate 
in history and whose maladroit 
syntax scrambles the senses, 
could achieve the highest office in 
the nation is troubling, to say the 
least. But the fact that so many of 
us can still sit here and pretend 

that we — as a culture — were 
asymptomatic prior to this, that 
what has happened doesn’t have 
anything to do with how we live, 
is perhaps more surprising. No 
wonder “surreal” managed to 
be 
named 
Merriam-Webster’s 

2016’s word of the year. With all 
this strangeness floating around, 
the present moment has honestly 
turned out to be a breakdown 
of 
Baudrillardian 
magnitude. 

Scheming billionaires, corrupt 
officials, Russian cabals — the 
whole thing is really turning into a 
bad satire of a Bond movie without 
the love-interest.

All of which, believe it or not, 

brings me back to Weird Twitter. 
Because even though they offer 
their message 140 characters at a 
time and don’t spend 1,000 words 
prattling on about the perils of 
postmodernity, they get it. Maybe 
they don’t ever articulate it in 
quite the same way as I do, but 
the more I read their tweets the 
more I become convinced they 
understand that our society has 
come to a crisis of culture, and 
that this crisis stems from the 
way we view and experience the 
world. Sure, some of their stuff is 
mindless shitposting, but if you 
look past the irony and absurdity 
and vulgarity often you’ll find a 
message containing a keen social 
critique.

Some of those from Weird 

Twitter realize it too. At the 
heart of the Weird Twitter 
political scene is a collective 
known as Chapo Trap House, 
a group of three core members 
who originally came together to 
do an ad-hoc radio comedy show 
mocking the then-recent film “13 
Hours,” by Hollywood director 
and 
part-time 
conservative 

propagandist 
Michael 
“more-

explosions-is-always-better” 
Bay. But CTH ended up sticking 
together, and have since been 
producing 
a 
profanity-laced, 

firmly 
leftist 
(not 
“liberal”) 

podcast that has been perhaps 
the loudest voice in the self-titled 
“Dirtbag Left.”

CTH has had a real run of 

it in recent months, the pack 
of 
vulgarians 
turning 
their 

vituperative scorn on the short-
fingered vulgarian. But following 
the failure of Hillary Clinton’s 
campaign especially, CTH has 
turned much of its ridicule 
toward other targets closer to 
home, namely, they lambast the 
sort of lackadaisical liberals who 
they feel handed the nomination 
to Clinton, and subsequently, 
the presidency to Trump. They 
demand a left that is more resolute 
in its convictions and fierce in 
its fights, mocking those in the 
Democratic Party who lacked 
either the passion or the courage 
— or maybe both — to truly stand 
up for the ideals of the left in the 
same sort of invigorating way that 
an FDR or JFK might have.

And certainly CTH has been 

noticed; in November, The New 
Yorker ran an article about them 
and their future (though am I the 
only one that finds it strange that 
CTH agreed to be interviewed 
by a publication which is exactly 
the sort of liberal elitist snobbery 
they rail against? The New Yorker 
spells it “élitist,” for God’s sake). 
But it will be interesting to watch 
where they go from this point 
forward, particularly as it pertains 
to the reform of the American left.

But in my view CTH, and 

Weird Twitter as a whole, faces a 
very real challenge to its efficacy 
as an agent of change. And this 
challenge comes from within itself 
— just as I have spent the last few 
days gazing into the abyss of Weird 
Twitter, so too has Weird Twitter 
spent its lifetime gazing into the 
abyss of our reality, and they 
would do well to remember the 
first half of that Nietzsche quote: 
“He who fights with monsters 
should look to it that he himself 
does not become a monster.” For 
mockery and ridicule will only get 
one so far. Perhaps I sound like a 
follower of Burke or a Girondin 
or some such thing, but to me one 
must not only tear down, but also 
build up. To commentate is easy — 
creation is harder.

postmodernity

the b-side
Thursday, January 19, 2017 — 3B

The first time I saw that 

specific permutation of symbols 
— “@fart” — was on a Headline 
News Network chyron. Someone 
had sent me a link to what he 
claimed was “the funniest shit 
I’ve ever seen.” Sure enough, 
it was; this stunt was peak 
performance art in the age of 
social media, a brilliantly stupid 
and stupidly brilliant confluence 
of the 24-hour news cycle and 
pure absurdism. The man behind 
it all is more tastefully known as 
Jon Hendren, a Bay Area-based 
web developer specializing in a 
fairly new field called DevOps. 
But that “@fart” handle proved 
too intriguing for me. Relatively 
naive to Twitter, I took a deep 
dive into Hendren’s hilarious, 
wonderful profile and everything 
that came with it — the infamous 
shoe roast is another golden 
moment — and thus, I was 
converted: I was now a Weird 
Twitter devotee. I managed to 
get ahold of Hendren and ask 
him a bit about his craft — he’s a 
personal hero of mine, so having 
him respond was quite the thrill.

What’s 
a 
bit 
of 
your 

background, and how did you 
get into “Weird Twitter”?

I’m 
just 
some 
dude. 
I’m 

not 
particularly 
interesting 

or well-educated, but I’ve got 
a background in writing for 
websites and sometimes mobile 
games. Now I do marketing. 
Interestingly enough, the guys 
who hired me did so in part 
because when you google me, one 
of the first results is an article 
where I talk about how much I 
hate marketing.

“Weird Twitter” is primarily 

made up of people who came 
over 
from 
SomethingAwful 

around 2008-2010. There are a 
handful of reasons people made 
the leap, but I think the big one 
was that Twitter was just easier 
to use on smartphones at that 
period, and most of us had jobs 
so it was just a better place to 
post our dumb things. Then along 
came style-biters with cartoon 
avatars and names like Random 
McBaconspoon and now I hate 
Twitter.

So how did you come up with 

your Twitter handle (which is 
an all-time great)?

Honestly, I just typed it in and 

it worked. I never really planned 
to “use” Twitter for anything, so 
I was goofing off, and it said the 
name was available and I jumped 
on it.

In your own words, what 

characterizes 
the 
specific 

“Weird 
Twitter” 
sense 
of 

humor?

A lot of it I think has its root in 

some of the old SomethingAwful 
stuff. If you go back and read 
some of the front page and 
the FYAD (Fuck You And Die) 
subforum from like 2000-2010 
you’ll probably notice a lot of the 
same themes and tone. A lot of it 
hasn’t held up over time, but some 
of it is really good still. Lots of 
diapers, if you’re into diapers.

The first time I read about 

you was the HLN Edward 
Scissorhands 
stunt, 
which, 

for the record, is one of the 
funniest 
things 
I’ve 
ever 

seen. Can you give a little 
background behind that — how 
it happened, the logistics, what 
you think was the point of it, 

etc.?

I still don’t know how it 

happened. I got a pretty short 
email the day before from a 
producer or someone with just 
a couple lines like, “Hey, want 
to come on via Skype and talk 
about Edward Snowden joining 
Twitter?” and I immediately 
replied “yes” before even fully 
thinking it through. I think 
there was also a bit in there 
suggesting I might be having a 
back-and-forth 
with 
someone 

who was anti-Snowden, so I was 
mentally preparing myself for 
that. But I didn’t really have a 
plan at all because I didn’t know 
the structure of it for sure, I just 
thought it’d be funny to make 
it sound like I was there to talk 
about Edward Scissorhands. I 
figured they’d hang up on me as 
soon as I said something weird, 
but they didn’t and it kept going 
for like 2 minutes. I asked my 
friend Jesse Farrar to record it 
in case it ended up being funny, 
and as soon as the thing ended I 
was convinced it was going to be 
bad. I asked how bad it turned 
out and he said, “No dude, this is 
really good.” Then I went to work 
and opened my laptop and there 
were trending topics about it and 
whatever else. Really weird day.

Has 
that 
whole 
episode 

changed anything for you?

Every couple months someone 

recognizes me somewhere, which 
is basically horrifying because 
I’m usually doing something 
dumb or dressed like shit.

How do you come up with 

tweets? Does it come easily to 
you?

I don’t know, ideas just sort of 

happen as I go about my business. 
I don’t really work on them unless 
I have to get the wording into 
shape. Some guys really enjoy 
workshopping their tweets and 
posting revisions to see how they 
perform and whatnot. That’s not 
for me. I just have to get a funny 
idea out before I stop thinking it’s 
funny and before I bother anyone 
I know in real life with it.

Do you think Twitter is 

legitimately an art form?

I think it is if you treat it a 

certain way. Like, if you want to 
convey an idea or a concept or get 
some sort of result or reaction in 
just this small space, I think that 
and (a bunch of other uses) are 
legitimate art. But at the same 
time, you also will come across 
folks who are just re-engineering 
worn-out concepts and line-
break tweets in a desperate bid to 
get the favs and RTs. That part is 
sad and not artistic.

Given that, what are some 

of 
your 
favorite 
Twitter 

accounts?

I love @dogboner, @dril, @

degg, @bronzehammer, and all 
my other wonderful boys.

Can 
you 
speak 
a 
little 

bit about DevOps and your 
involvement in it?

Without getting too far into the 

weeds, DevOps is a methodology 
software 
developers 
and 
IT 

admins can use to create their 
software better and faster. It 
is a good thing, but incredibly 
boring and irrelevant to 99.99% 
of people. (Like me)

The software my company 

makes deals with a lot of what 
makes DevOps hard for people, 
so I have to think about it a lot. 
What we make is actually useful 
for people interested in DevOps, 
but it’s practically impossible for 
anyone to cut through the sea of 

buzzwords and self-appointed 
“Thought Leaders’” meaningless 
blog posts, so I figured I should 
just tell everyone I’m one of those 
thought leaders now, and also 
the best one. And it worked. I’m 
the best one now. Smartest, most 
handsome, highest libido. Most 
of the “real” thought leaders hate 
me for it, which is how I know 
it’s good. I don’t really mention 
the company on my Twitter 
account or tie it back in, I mainly 
just enjoy making self-righteous 
people mad.

So is DevOps work a career 

path that sprung out of your 
Twitter usage?

Yup, it’s absolutely something 

I never would have learned 
anything about otherwise. I’m 
extremely lazy.

Because of the election, a 

certain subset of Weird Twitter 
has become identified with the 
Chapo/”Dirtbag Left” crowd. 
Do you think there’s a political 
utility to Weird Twitter? And 
if so, is it worthwhile?

Yeah, and it is worthwhile. I 

think people in that Dirtbag Left 
community are usually seen as 
outspoken and even credible(!) 
on matters of politics. From what 
I’ve seen they typically don’t 
roast someone unless they can 
back it up. They criticize a wide 
range of things and people, but 
do it eloquently and lay out their 
arguments pretty well. It gives 
them a certain type of credibility 
that’s in short supply lately. Of 
course, this will all come back 
to bite me as soon as we find out 
one of them is a serial killer or 
something.

But like, if the world’s most 

popular celebrity tweets, “Hey, 
mango-flavored 
chapstick 
is 

great, maybe get some next 
time you’re at the gas station,” 
I’ll think, “hey fuck you pal, 
mind your business,” but if 
Larry Website says to join the 
Democratic Socialists of America 
and yourself get involved in 
politics, well shit, I will join the 
DSA (and I have, along with 
thousands of other people). I 
think there’s a huge amount of 
potential in people like that so 
long as they keep pushing into the 
mainstream and don’t just peak 
with a successful podcast.

That said, I don’t know any 

of the Dirtbag Left people on a 
personal level, but they seem to 
be doing something good at an 
important point in time, so I like 
‘em and think they’re good.

So what do you see as the 

future of this subculture?

We’re moving the whole thing 

into VR as soon as Big Toilet 
Simulator 
2018 
is 
released. 

DLC will let you choose from 4 
different pee stream colors.

This might still be a sore 

spot, but want to talk about 
the infamous shoe roast at 
all—what the whole deal was, 
were you actually pissed, etc.? 
Another one of my favorite 
Twitter moments.

Nah, it was cool. Greg and Dave 

and used to work together at a 
weird startup where we had way 
too much time on our hands, and 
we roasted each other constantly. 
That particular day I was fairly 
busy and didn’t see a lot of it until 
later. I deserved it though, the 
shoes were bad. I dropped them 
off at a thrift store I lived near at 
the time, which then closed a few 
months later. Totally unrelated 
probably I hope.

UNSPLASH

An example of a clothing showroom
The uneven crossroad of Twitter 
and the modern fashion zeitgeist

The role of‘Fashion Twitter’ and its unique space on the expansive website

The 
corner 
of 
Twitter 

dedicated to fashion, or “Fashion 
Twitter,” is a weird place. It has 
never really been a place for 
in-depth exploration of fashion 
trends or to share what’s hot this 
Spring/Summer, but is more of a 
space for surface-level content. 
I think this is primarily due to 
the fact that other social media 
platforms 
have 
much 
more 

pointed communities for serious 
fashion talk, leaving Twitter to 
be the home of more superficial 
discussion.

Fashion Twitter has many 

different facets, but at its roots, it 
primarily serves two purposes: 
First as a medium for people to 
vent and second, to post fashion 
memes. Both of these uses of 
Fashion Twitter have attracted 
fashion snobs and marginally 
attached 
fashion 
consumers 

alike.

While the brands themselves 

don’t have a hold on the Fashion 
Twitter market, designers from 
Kanye West to Hedi Slimane 
have used the site to express 
their 
various 
troubles 
with 

the industry. Slimane’s since-
deleted rant started with the 
following tweet:

“FACT CHECKING / THERE 

HAVE BEEN INACCURATE 
STATEMENTS ON RECENT 
ARTICLES REGARDING HEDI 
AND THE USAGE OF THE YSL 
HISTORICAL LOGO”

It 
then 
snowballed 
into 

an 
in-depth, 
third-person 

account that I call “YSL: FOR 
THE RECORD,” highlighting 
Silmane’s long history of using 
the YSL logo in his two different 
tenures at the helm of the 
fashion house (first as Menswear 
Ready-to-Wear director, then as 
Creative Director).

Kanye West has had his fair 

share of Twitter diatribes, as 
well: He (questionably) took 
to Twitter to ask Facebook 

founder, Mark Zuckerberg, to 
invest in him after pointing out 
how many fashion houses have 
shot down his ideas because he 
is considered an outsider.

West also used the site to 

complain about how so many 
houses were biting the designs of 
Slimane rather than pushing the 
envelope, which is something 
that has been seen over the past 
few years.

It is interesting to me how 

designers and artists on the level 
of Slimane and West have used 
Twitter as the choice outlet for 
their frustrations. To me, the 
value of Twitter has always been 
the ability to send small tidbits of 
information to a large audience, 

so from that perspective it makes 
perfect sense to use it to express 
discontent with a situation. At 
the same time, however, the 
Twitter demographic does not 
seem to align perfectly with 
the group that someone like 
Slimane would be looking to 
reach through his self-defense. 
A couple fashion blogs will 
pick up the story and run with 
it, which is where it will gain 
traction, but it’s extremely rare 
to see Fashion Twitter having a 
serious conversation about the 
tweets themselves.

On the other end of Fashion 

Twitter are accounts like Four 
Pins. Since shutting down its 

blog in late 2015, Four Pins 
Twitter account has continued 
in high spirits. They can be 
found talking trash about Roshe 
Runs.

Or providing plenty of content 

to tag “your most swagless 
homie” (i.e. your only other 
friends interested in fashion on 
Twitter) in.

These tweets are lighthearted 

jokes that people who are 
interested in fashion can relate 
to, just like any other Twitter 
community but on a much 
smaller 
scale 
(compared 
to 

Four Pins who has 200,000 
followers).

Something that I’ve asked 

myself is what value does Fashion 
Twitter add to the fashion scene 
as a whole? Facebook is great 
for buying and selling highly 
sought-after items, Instagram is 
a fantastic platform (for better 
or worse) to “flex“ the latest 
pickup and for the proliferation 
of trends in general and then 
there’s Twitter. Besides memes 
and the occasional tirade, I don’t 
think that Twitter adds much 
else, but paradoxically that’s 
what makes it so useful.

For something that many 

people view as a hobby, fashion 
can be terribly competitive: 
Competition shows itself on 
Facebook 
through 
people 

constantly seeking the most 
iconic (and expensive) garments 
from a designer, and it shows on 
Instagram with users always 
trying to post outfits in the most 
exclusive pieces. This sense 
of 
competition 
comes 
from 

the sense of urgency that has 
plagued the fashion industry. 
While everyone from designers 
to Instagram users are working 
so hard to be perceived as 
trailblazers in their own ways, 
Fashion Twitter hangs back and 
provides a place for people to 
complain from time-to-time 
and to post dumb jokes. For 
people like myself, this can be 
a much-needed break from the 
competitive scene.

 Young Thug’s known for the 
outrageous shit he does. He 
wears women’s clothing. He 
doesn’t eat, like, anything. He 
takes molly regularly. 
Etc., etc. The dude 
just doesn’t care. And 
apparently, he didn’t 
give enough to show 
up to the filming of 
his “Wyclef Jean” 
video. But that didn’t 
stop director Ryan Staake from 
making one anyways. And, while 
the end result isn’t necessarily a 
music video, that’s kind of what 
makes it the greatest music video 
ever.
 
The video opens on a 

black screen that features text 
through which Staake introduces 
himself to us: “I don’t have any 
of what I planned to film. So, I’ll 
just explain how this video fell 
apart,” the screen reads at one 

point. He goes on to humorously 
chronicle the day’s events via this 
text on the screen, where we’re 
told they continued shooting 

without Thug, under 
the impression he 
would eventually 
arrive. We see shots of 
girls in bikinis, shots of 
girls smashing bikinis, 
shots of girls eating 
hot dogs, but not shots 

of Thug. And this does not go 
unmentioned by the director.
 
He tells us, too, that 

his only interaction with Thug 
was via an audio recording sent 
to him, in which Thug details 
the premise for the video. This 
recording goes on to narrate the 
entire video. For example, over 
the audio sample Thug says, “I 
want like, police cars. I want kids 
in the adult car,” and we see a 
shot of just that: kids dressed in 

police uniforms sitting in a police 
car. This continues throughout. 
And the humor is not subtle, as 
Staake adds his own little quips 
throughout. One scene features 
“bitches” hitting the police car 
with bats, in which he comments: 
“This scene actually worked out 
pretty well. It even feels like a 
real video.” There’s commentary 
on artistry, and wealth and 
celebrity, as well, with Staake 
concluding: “Maybe that’s the 
moral of the story: None of this 
matters. This video costs over 
$100,000 and the artist never 
showed.”
 
But this is a rap music 

video, and we don’t have time for 
that shit. Just keep the girls in 
the bikinis coming.

STYLE NOTEBOOK


4B — Thursday, January 19, 2017
the b-side
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

 

I know I’m in on “The Young Pope” from its first shot: a baby’s bare ass, climbing 

across a mountain of more naked babies. And who emerges from the infantile rubble? None 
other than 
my main man, David Jude Heyworth Law. I love this show already.

 
I feel like I could write about “The Young Pope” for hours. 
The incredible, blistering, surreal, subversive, miraculous 

opening 15 minutes (Buzzed, who went to Catholic 

school: “This is NOT the Catholic Church”), the 

lush cinematography, Jude Law’s career-best 

performance, its winking self-awareness that 

renders any and all previous Twitter-based 
memes dated, if not outright irrelevant — but I 
can’t stop thinking about “Pope” ’s complete 
and utter command of tone. The supposedly 
wide chasm between pretentiousness and 
camp isn’t so much a yawning gap as it is a 
circle that bends back upon itself. Sorrentino 
pitches the show at that perfect intersection, 
and it’s a minor miracle that he pulls it off.

Which is why this whole viewing might 

be an exercise in futility. “The Young Pope” 
knows its premise is absurd, it’s aware of 
the inherent outrageousness; it’s essentially 
a living, breathing meme. You’re not laughing 

at this show because it’s bad, you’re laughing 

because the writers literally wrote a joke. It’s OK 

to laugh! It’s the anti-prestige drama, a splash of cold 

water in the face of HBO stiffness. As Buzzed looks 

through her laptop files to find a sonnet she once wrote to 

Jude Law in middle school and Baked is unnervingly silent, a 

Cardinal on the screen is scrolling through his iPhone. It’s such a 

simple but outlandish image, cartoonish but effective. Jude Law, the Pope, asking for a Cherry 
Coke Zero — incredible.

There are so many other things I’d like to pontificate on, but Baked just yelled out, “WHAT 

IF THE POPE BLASTED CIGS THOUGH?” Shouts to Brandon Wardell.

“You don’t just cast a guy with a small pee-pee as a pope”
And off we go to Neverland! So many dead babies dear 

lord. But lords are all the rage these days, didn’t you know? 

He drops his robe and my oh my Catholic education never 

gave me a jude law it gave me some homophobic priests, a 
puppet, and catholic guilt but NOT jude law.

Catholic guilt and insecure men, what did I tell you. All 

the ingredients you need to enter priesthood is right there.

Fourteen years and what does it get me? Several bible 

passages and a woman telling me that we “can talk to her” 
about our problems “because she was a college counselor 
and she understands.” It also gave me Pam Stenzel. Why did 
one girl in my graduating class get pregnant and two drop 
out? Pam Stenzel. Why did my sex education consist of the 
identification of defense mechanisms and the map of the 
female vagina? Catholicism.

Lenny’s a contradiction. He’s the pope, but he’s also Jude 

Law. I can’t tell you what this does to my psyche. Because in 
high school, yes, I wrote a sonnet about Jude Law. 14 lines, 
and a rhyming couplet at the end. Oh how rich, how sweet, 
how rich.

My teacher had me read it in front of the class as the 

“ideal example of a sonnet.” I told her it was about Jude. She 
made me return to my seat.

And now, I bestow it onto you my dear readers. Please, 

remark on it in peace and in pure adoration for the art of 
those who came before us —

There holds not much use in comparing thee
To the summer’s day, or rose buds of springs
For such drawings are made in falsity
You are more pristine than either beings
Those eyes shine bright, full of life and laughter
A voice melodious with an accent
Mirroring a song, but a bit faster
If only from thy lips a kiss be lent
Deceit can be seen in thy awful past
But there is mercy for a handsome face
My love for you is sure to always last
But your heart may not always keep the pace
From afar these feelings have collected
While any hope of requite has melted

I also did an interpretation of Macbeth’s murder based 

on the Sopranos. There were nerf guns involved and i made 
them buy wifebeaters. Ask me about it sometimes. And then 
ask why I didn’t have any friends.

Back in high school, I 

remember my friends and 
I once had a contest to see 
who could get the most 
rappers to follow us on 
Twitter. It all started one 
day, when totally out of the 
blue, frequent Riff Raff-
collaborator TKO Capone 
blessed me with a gracious 
follow. It wasn’t much, but 
it stood as the beginning 
of something truly special; 
in the ensuing weeks, my 
friends and I would scheme 
and strategize our way 
to eventually earning the 
prized Kanye West follow.

I 
decided 
I 
would 

circumvent 
all 
of 
the 

mixtape scrubs and jump 
straight to the big shots. 
I called the White House 
Communications 
Agency 

to see if I could get a 
follow 
from 
President 

Obama (not a rapper), but 
I guess my request was 
deemed 
unimportant. 

When V-Nasty leaked Riff 
Raff’s phone number that 
same week, I spam-called 
him at least 15 times to 
see if he would follow me 
on Twitter. He eventually 
picked up up the phone, but 
I was only on the receiving 
end of swear words in his 
surprisingly authentic Texas 
drawl (though, it should be 
noted that he did follow me 
sometime thereafter).

My friends had begun 

to rack up all sorts of 
struggling rappers, and yet, 
I had nothing. They angled 
for shoutouts on Datpiff 
cuts, while all I could do 
was refresh my page. I felt 
directionless, worthless — 
unworthy, even.

One friend happened to 

become particularly close 
with Soulja Boy through Xbox 
Live, and mentioned that Mr. 
Boy was very responsive to 
fans that repped his label, 
SODMG (Stacks On Deck 
Money Gang). It was free 

marketing and made the 
fans feel acknowledged on 
an individual level. At that 
moment it became very clear 
what I had to do to redeem 
myself. I updated my Twitter 
handle to include his label, 
and within a few days, I was 
in.

The internet proved to 

be 
shockingly 
powerful 

guerrilla marketing tool for 

up-and-coming artists, and I 
think early internet rappers 
that existed between the 
years of 2008 and 2011 were 
most exemplary in their 
approach. Wiz Khalifa was 
an infamous Twitter user 
in his pre-Kush & OJ days, 
keeping his ears to the pulse 
of his cargo short-wearing 
fans. 
Curren$y 
typically 

responded at every time of 
asking, and all it took was 
a name-change to receive 
affirmation from the first 
guy to ever “superman” on 
us all.

None were quite as prolific 

as 
Lil 
B, 
though. 
Born 

Brandon McCartney, Lil B 
‘From The Pack’ BasedGod 
was (and continues to be) 
the greatest Twitter user 
of our time. Before the 
cooking dance memes, ESPN 
appearances, 
Pitchfork 

endorsements and university 
lectures, there were the 
tweets. My god, the tweets.

From 
the 
beginning, 

Lil 
B 
was 
the 
most 

unpredictable and eccentric 
rapper at the intersection 
of 
popular 
culture 
and 

Twitter, populated with a 
wide variety of characters 
ranging 
from 
Father 
to 

Earl Sweatshirt. His tweets 
were most identifiable by a 
childlike 
juxtaposition 
of 

vulgarity and sincerity — 
tweets about mental illness 
awareness were released in 
tandem with confusing and 
offensive takes on feminism 
and sexual violence.

He was so passionate on 

issues that most rappers 
couldn’t give a damn about, 
and yet, his Twitter presence 
amplified his status as the 
poster child of “whack new 
rap” that his music gave 
him. His virtual signature 
gracing the end of every 
tweet, it almost feels like he’s 
speaking to you personally 
when he tweets that he loves 
you every day.

At this point it’s gone too 

far to be a joke or gimmick; 
in a recent interview with 
Noisey 
he 
discussed 
his 

challenges 
of 
coexisting 

peacefully 
with 
insects. 

I would love to hear, say, 
Tyga’s take on insect rights 
(not that it matters).

Lil B followed me on 

Twitter on September 14th, 
2011. I was a junior in high 
school, and it meant a lot to 
me. Having grown up and 
experienced music fanhood 
without the direct lines of 
communication, 
Twitter 

was awesome to me because 
I could hear about Kanye’s 
favorite 
movies, 
Earl’s 

favorite books, Tyler the 
Creator’s favorite Roy Ayers 
albums, etc. It brought me 
closer to my favorite artists 
in a way that removed 
them from their respective 
pedestals (in a good way). 
They were regular “music 

kids” like me, and Twitter 
made me feel like a genuine 
part of the artistic and 
cultural movements I most 
identified with.

I was 16 at the time and 

admittedly 
thought 
the 

“Thank You Based God” 
jokes and cooking dance 
celebrations were hilarious. 
I once tweeted a video of 
an American soccer player 
celebrating a goal against 
Suriname with the Lil B 
cooking dance, and a guy 
from Lil B’s camp named 
“Caseeno 
Truwop” 
(no 

longer online) retweeted it. 
It eventually found it’s way 
to Lil B, who then shared the 
video on Facebook. To this 
day, I still think he wouldn’t 

have found it had I not 
tweeted; his incredibly close 
internet-relationship 
with 

his fans makes it possible 
to influence the artists who 
most influence us.

A faction of his fans, 

affectionately known as the 
“Task Force,” have been 
responsible 
for 
elevating 

Lil B’s most infamous beefs 
to 
unforeseen 
levels 
via 

Twitter. One fan ordered 
30 cheese pizzas to Space 
Ghost Purrp’s home, and 
collectively, they managed 
to make Joey Bada$$ delete 
his 
Twitter 
altogether. 

They are very much a force 
to be reckoned with, and I 
think the dedication these 
fans show Lil B is merely a 
reciprocation of the respect 
he has shown to us in every 
tweet, like, follow and song.

Lil B is the 21st century 

iPhone-wielding Black Monk 
of rap, blessing us with 
aphorisms and criminally 
underrated 
music 
with 

each extension of his digital 
consciousness. He generally 
doesn’t 
use 
punctuation 

in his tweets or music, 
constantly finding ways to 
express 
himself 
through 

the 
constraints 
of 
our 

satellites and keyboards. As 
a generation of kids typified 
by a feeling of loneliness 
from incessant connectivity, 
Lil B’s resilient messages 
of 
all-too-real 
positivity 

really do hit close to home.

 Thursday, January 19, 2017 — 5B

President-elect 
Donald 

Trump’s unique penchant for 
tweeting — and his distinct, 
brash style on that platform 
— has proven to be ripe for 
parody. But unlike that of 
Alec Baldwin on “Saturday 
Night Live,” which requires 
excellent acting in real time, 
plus all the production that 
accompanies 
it, 
Trumpian 

parodies 
on 
Twitter 
are 

essentially 
democratic; 

they 
only 
require 
an 

internet connection and a 
working knowledge of pithy 
exclamations.

During 
and 
after 
the 

election, 
when 
it 
seemed 

Trump’s 
tweets 
alone 

gained 
as 
much 
media 

attention as all his opponents 
combined, Trump parodies 
and 
complements 
became 

something 
of 
a 
cottage 

industry.

Not all parody accounts, 

though, are created equal. 
Many that have spread virally 
are steeped in pop culture, 
and film in particular.

For 
Jimmy 
Lynch, 
a 

32-year-old 
cycle 
courier 

from London, Trump’s tweet 
this past December attacking 
the magazine Vanity Fair 
after it negatively reviewed a 
restaurant in one of his towers 
spawned the creation of @
Trump_Is_Hip. The account 
has over 5,000 followers and 
has provided Trump-esque 
criticism of various facets of 
pop culture.

“I think parody accounts 

help people laugh at the 
absurdity and hypocrisy of 
politics,” wrote Lynch in a 
private message on Twitter.

The most popular tweet to 

date from @Trump_Is_Hip 
was posted on January 4: 
“People say the movie E.T. is 
a classic but he entered the 
country 
ILLEGALLY 
and 

also wore a child’s dress! Not 
good!”

Lynch uses his Twitter 

account to project an image of 
an “uncultured” Trump. He 
revealed, “I thought tweeting 
about pop culture as Trump 
would be funny because he’s 
soon to be president, he’s mad 
as fuck, and I thought it would 
be funny if all he did was 
tweet about films and books 
and bands, mostly because 
I don’t imagine he has any 
interest in that stuff.”

Twitter parodies serve as a 

potentially powerful form of 
modern political discourse. 
The details of politicians’ 
personal lives used to be 
concealed behind front-facing 
policies. Now, they’re not 
only widely discussed, but 
often used by voters to make 
their choices as well. Lynch 
embraces the role his account 
may play. 

“Copying 
Trump’s 
style 

of tweeting means that it is 
hard for people to tell which 
account is actually him when 
they’re 
scanning 
through 

their timeline,” Lynch wrote.

That 
conflation 
of 

parody and truth — and its 
accompanying power — is 
troubling 
for 
Tom 
Hunt, 

a 
25-year-old 
aspiring 

lawyer 
who 
created 

Emperor 
Trumpatine 
(@

RealTrumpatine) 
with 
his 

friend, Daniel Bogre Udell, 
also 
25, 
and 
director 
at 

Wikitongues, which serves 
as 
a 
platform 
for 
global 

languages. 
The 
account 

depicts the arch-villain in 
the “Star Wars” anthology, 
Emperor 
Palpatine, 
as 
a 

Trump-like figure. One was 
visiting the other during the 
primary season last spring 
when they began recognizing 
similarities 
between 
the 

candidate and the character.

“I 
don’t 
think 
parody 

accounts should play any role 
in shaping anyone’s politics,” 
Hunt wrote in a private 
message over Twitter. “The 
parody account is just that 
— parody — and anyone who 
uses it to inform themselves 
of actual news I think is doing 

themselves and the country a 
disservice.”

Bogre Udell disagrees. The 

type of parody the two create 
“can play a role in political 
discourse — in pointing out 
hypocrisies, highlighting the 
absurd, and speaking truth 
to power,” he wrote. “As the 
saying 
goes, 
‘good 
satire 

punches up.’”

For Hunt, his parody is less 

political than his peers.

“Some people might read 

into it that we’re trying to 
deliver 
some 
subliminal 

message that Trump is going 
to be an emperor or dictator,” 
he wrote. “That’s not how I 
see it at all.”

Hunt 
and 
Bogre 
Udell 

believe 
that 
mimicking 

Trump’s defining brash tone 
is key. According to Hunt, 
Trump’s 
“brashness 
and 

constant need to respond to 
critics add to the absurdity 
and humor of this evil Star 
Wars villain acting similarly 
brash and ‘sensitive’ if you 
will.”

The duo is particularly 

adept at copying that style. 
When 
Trump 
started 
to 

appropriate the term “fake 
news” (see his January 12 
tweet: “.@CNN is in a total 
meltdown with their FAKE 
NEWS because their ratings 
are tanking since election and 
their credibility will soon be 
gone!”), their account tweeted 
later that day: “Jedi Council is 
in total meltdown with their 
FAKE PROPHECIES because 
their 
powers 
are 
tanking 

(clouded)&their 
credibility 

will soon be gone!”

The mass appeal of the 

“Star Wars” franchise, Hunt 

and Bogre Udell wrote, is what 
makes their form of parody 
so popular. Its followership 
is bipartisan and its world-
construction is “sprawling,” 
allowing an endless supply 
of material so long as Trump 
keeps being Trump.

Ironically, 
one 
of 
the 

most popular of the Trump 
parody 
accounts 
is 
@

ArtHouseTrump, with over 
24,000 followers, in which 
Donald Trump participates in 
rather niche film discussion. 
The account is run by David 
Johnston, who after starting 
in March has since ceased 
tweeting. @ArtHouseTrump, 
which didn’t respond to a 
request 
for 
an 
interview, 

gained traction during the 
2016 Toronto International 
Film Festival last September.

It’s 
unambiguously 

entertaining for film fans, 
perhaps because of a jarring 
juxtaposition 
between 
the 

populist brand that Trump 
exuded during the campaign 
and the elite circles that 
typically enjoy the films in 
question. In fact, when other 
similar parodies began to 
appear, modeled on other 
candidates 
like 
Jill 
Stein 

and Hillary Clinton, they 
didn’t have the same bite or 
familiarity. In other words, 
Ted Cruz’s Twitter cadence 
isn’t particularly distinctive; 
Trump’s is.

Take, 
for 
instance, 
a 

criticism of the Democratic 
Party’s donkey logo rooted 
in a reference to Robert 
Bresson’s 1966 French drama 
“Au 
Hasard 
Balthazar:” 

“What does it say about the 
Democratic Party that they 
would steal Balthazar for 
their main symbol? I don’t 
know, folks! But it’s not right!”

Like 
the 
“Star 
Wars” 

account, 
@ArtHouseTrump 

is particularly at successful 
at translating Trump’s own 
talking points into thematic 
tweets. For instance, Trump’s 
criticism of coastal media 
elites is transformed into 
disdain 
for 
high-minded 

critics who are disconnected 
from the common filmgoer.

The parody Trump even 

replicates 
its 
namesake’s 

tendency to respond over 
Twitter to criticism. When 
actress 
Jessica 
Chastain 

tweeted 
negatively 
about 

Trump’s tax policy history, in 
which 
the 
then-Republican 

candidate for president said 
in a debate that he was smart 
to 
avoid 
paying 
taxes, 
@

ArtHouseTrump 
responded 

by tweeting, “To be fair, you 
owe the American people for 
Interstellar!”

These 
three 
parody 

accounts are engaged in a sort 
of blurring of popular fiction 
and populist free thought. 
By 
juxtaposing 
Trumpian 

rhetoric with a niche topic 
like 
film, 
the 
parodies 

equalize the president-elect 
with more familiar faces: the 
critical co-worker, the space 
opera super villain or that one 
annoying guy in your friend 
circle. Sad!

Last year was one 

of romantic chaos for Keh-
lani — the singer-songwriter 
found herself in the middle 
of a love triangle with ris-
ing R&B stud 
PARTYNEXT-
DOOR 
and 

NBA star Kyrie 
Irving, with the 
media-hyped 
aftermath 
reportedly 
pushing her to 
the brink of sui-
cide — but 2017’s Kehlani is 
an artist chomping at the bit 
to separate this past with her 
career. So far she’s worked 
quite successfully toward 
a 
musical 
vindication.

 
Released Jan. 13, 

“Do U Dirty,” essentially an 

emotionally-turbulent kick-
back, is extremely promising 
in light of her Jan. 27 album 
SweetSexySavage. It makes 
its stake not in creativity 

but consisten-
cy, 
utilizing 

straightfor-
ward 
synth 

and 
snare. 

OVO-esque 
sound is fitting 
considering 
her PartyNext-
Door ties; the 

ambience of the harmonic 
background vocals comple-
ment her persona. “Sign 
the deal and then they cut 
the check / And ever since, 
my color’s showing,” she 
claims. “Change the scene, 
the things are better now 

/ And you know the wave 
is never slowing, the wave 
is never slowing,” as her 
explosiveness is surrounded 
by an echoing hook, revolv-
ing around Kehlani and only 
Kehlani, 
further 
provid-

ing a spotlight to punch as 
much as she feels necessary.
 
At times it sounds 

like Keyshia Cole 2.0, which 
isn’t at all a bad thing. Sim-
ple yet nuanced, Kehlani 
delivers further justifica-
tion of her somewhat low 
key foray into an infrequent-
ly penetrated gold mine of 
sound. Few have succeeded 
in establishing a Drake-like 
sound; this comes close.

The secret happiness in 
the unhappy ending

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK

Writer Eli Rallo talks about the satisfaction and contentment she finds 
in unhappy endings, savoring their authenticity and appeal to reality

There is so much to be 

said about the happy ending. 
The 
attentive 
reader, 
the 

seasoned moviegoer, the overly 
optimistic Netflix aficionado — 
they all crave the happy ending. 
It’s Dorothy finding home at 
the end of “The Wizard of Oz,” 
it’s Ferris Bueller somehow 
making it back from Chicago 
unscathed in “Ferris Bueller’s 
Day Off.” It is a monster that 
looms under our bed, that 
happy ending; it often feels 
forced or expected, however, 
we ignore these notions and 
accept it. The protagonist ends 
up with the love of their life, 
they get the job, they beat the 
odds, they save the day and 
they are the hero. We watch 
an entire movie, read a book, 
obsess over an entire series 
of television just to know the 
ending. And secretly the entire 
time, deep down, we silently 
beg for that ending to be happy.

We as the audience are so 

incredibly 
attached 
to 
the 

happy ending. I’ve thought 
about the happy ending a 
lot. 
Unfortunately, 
because 

I 
overanalyze 
every 
book, 

movie and TV show I come 
in contact with, I’m prone 
to questioning the ending. I 
like happy endings. They are 
pleasant, they make us feel 
satisfied. I always want the 
main character to succeed, 
and I am happy that Blair and 
Chuck end up together, or 
that Regina George can live in 
harmony with the rest of the 
high school world, but I wonder 
if this is how it would really 
be. I imagine every Nicholas 
Sparks couple springing to life, 
and I cannot fathom that they’d 
all end up together. That every 
couple would be happily eating 
dinner on a sailboat, or getting 
married in a barn surrounded 
by a field of wildflowers. I’m 
sure sometimes it would work 
out that way, but realistically, 
life doesn’t always work out as 
such.

We’re attached to the happy 

ending because it brings us 
hope. It shows us that in our 
fictional worlds, the ones we 
use to terminate the fears and 
stress that come up in our 
realities, things turn out all 
right. It gives us a tiny grain of 
something to hold on to, that in 
our lives if things aren’t going 
how we planned, somewhere 
far, far away (like Monica’s 

apartment 
in 
“Friends” 
or 

Elsa’s 
castle 
in 
“Frozen”), 

everything turned out just fine.

I 
find 
myself 
rejecting 

that artificial or unrealistic 
happy ending, so I also think 
about the unhappy ending. In 
famous literature, well-known 
movies and popular TV shows 
we’ve all seen the successful 
execution 
of 
the 
unhappy 

ending — the no resolve, the 
vague cliffhanger, the lonely 
protagonist. 
Something 
not 

our 
typical 
cathartic 
and 

beautiful, but that redefines a 
beautiful resolve. Something 
that drags us out of our 
fictional worlds and forces 
us to think. Something that 
asks the constantly reiterating 
question: Why did the author 
or director do this to us?

Society 
often 
complains 

about that “unhappy ending,” 
and yet, audiences still return 

to it over and over again. 
“The 
Fault 
in 
Our 
Stars” 

is so successful because it 
mirrors real life. Sure, it’s 
heartbreaking, and I sat in a 
comfortable 
movie 
theatre 

chair 
sobbing 
over 
John 

Green’s decision to end his 
characters’ stories the way 
he did. But there’s a catch to 
the whole thing. I went back 
and saw it again because it’s 
real, honest and painful, but it 
bleeds truth.

Jojo Meyer’s “Me Before 

You” is another example of 
the unhappy ending. After I 
finished the book, I still went 
to the movie theatre to see the 
film. It shocked me that Meyer 
would end her enticing story 
the way that she did, and I was 
drawn to it. Part of me wished 
that she would have ended 
the story with an intricately 
described wedding, something 
stunning that I could picture 
perfectly 
in 
my 
romantic 

head. But relationships in life 
don’t always end with a lovely 
wedding, so there’s not a reason 
for every romantic novel to end 
that way either. All that does 
for an audience is constantly 
provide unexpected realities.

There 
are 
many 
more 

unhappy endings. “My Sister’s 
Keeper,” “Marley and Me,” 
“1984,” “One Flew Over the 
Cuckoo’s 
Nest,” 
“Titanic,” 

“Saving Private Ryan” and 
the list goes on. We return 
to these movies, we return 
to these books, despite their 
unhappy 
endings, 
because 

they are wonderful. They are 
magnificent and they are real 
and they provoke us to think 
about reality through the lense 
of fiction. However tough or 
scary they may be, they give us 
something to hold on to when 
we feel like there is nothing 
else. This is what the story aims 
to do. Not to provide the world 
with the idea that everything 
always goes our way, but to 
be there for us once we’ve 
accepted that not everything 
can go our way, just as it 
didn’t for many of our beloved 
characters. 
These 
difficult 

endings 
are 
so 
tragically 

alluring that we return to it in a 
myriad of mediums, constantly 
in our everyday lives. 

There’s something to be said 

about all endings. They’re put 
in place because our favorite 
books and movies and TV 
shows unfortunately don’t last 
forever. The unhappy ending 
knocks 
the 
reader 
or 
the 

audience unconscious from its 
element of surprise. It puts the 
world in prospective. It speaks 
truth and honesty, it proves 
that things go wrong in the 
world all the time — every day, 
in fact. It’s our job as humans 
to take a deep breath, just as 
many of our fictional heroes 
had to, and carry on. I’d like to 
stand by the unhappy ending. It 
gives us a blissful piece of truth 
to hang on to. It proves that not 
everything can go our way. It 
shows a reality about the world 
that is often shadowed by the 
happy endings that we have 
become so reliant on. It boils 
down to a simple dichotomy: 
the person who turns to fiction 
to escape versus the person who 
turns to fiction for catharsis. I 
don’t turn to fiction to escape 
to another place, I turn to 
fiction to help me make sense 
of the world I’m in. And that 
to me is the happiest ending of 
them all.

To be honest, it’s impos-

sible to choose just one out 
of the many amazing Vines 
that exist out 
there. But if I 
had to pick, it 
would be this 
wonderful clip 
of a man skip-
ping 
to 
the 

beat of Carly 
Rae 
Jepsen’s 

effervescent 
‘80s 
reminis-

cent “Run Away 
With Me.” This was one of 
several Vines that used Jep-
sen’s song, but this one is by 
far the most hilarious and 
creative. Whoever recorded 

this was extremely lucky, 
especially since the man’s 
dancing in the Vine is scar-

ily 
in 
sync 

with the “Run 
Away 
With 

Me,” 
making 

for a perfect, 
smooth 
loop. 

It 
reaffirms 

the 
undeni-

able fact that 
Vine will truly 
be 
missed. 

God bless this 

video, God bless Carly Rae 
Jepsen, God bless Vine.

Trash. Blue Ribbon Select, 

USDA Grade A, organic, cage 
free millennial trash. Vine oper-
ated on the exploitations of the 
absurdist shit our shameless 
generation never ceases to 
produce, and for good rea-
son — it’s great #content. An 
ambassador of these antics 
to the greater generational 
fringes of our world, Asspizza, 

a teenage anti-wunderkind 
whose various sar-
torial exploits and 
Sharpie-scribbled

the adolescent 
a bizarre public 
stage, unknow-

our generation did not deserve 

— this Vine being the 
best and foremost 
example. Vine has 
come and gone in, all 
things considered, 
an instant, but we 
will still remain 
the maligned, mal-
feasant gaggle of 

degenerates that American 

society has had the displea-
sure of welcoming. Thank you 
Asspizza. Thank you for your 
candid self-portraiture, thank 
you for your cultural contribu-
tions and thank you for your 
wonderfully haphazardly

ding star among aging nebulas.

NOT THE REAL VINE 
BUT STILL FUNNY
Gavin got us. After his 

uncle put a lizard on his 
head, the kid sky-
rocketed 
to 
Vine 

stardom, 
quickly 

becoming the face 
of a generation much 
older than himself. 
Gavin reacted the 
world the way we 
did, so everything 
he did was instantly 
deemed worthy of #relatable-
post status. Yes, Simone Biles, 
there is a Gavin meme for 
everything. Because Gavin 
was one of us. He was a child 
with the soul of a millennial, 

at once fascinated and horri-
fied by the world around him. 

He was the heart 
of the Internet. 
This vine is Gavin 
at his best. It’s the 
ultimate clapback 
Vine, aptly subti-
tled “tag your ugly 
friend 
#cute.” 

And tag our ugly 
friends we did.

In 2013, we were blessed. Two days 

ago, we were cursed. Vine’s all-too-
brief life span was, of course, longer 
than six seconds, but it’s impossible to 
feel like our collective time with the 
app was cut heartbreakingly short. 
Vine was essential to the culture at 
large, an outlet for people from any 
corner of the world to express their 
creative passion, yet it died at the 

hands of of cut-and-dry, joyless, Sili-
con Valley business dealings. For Twit-
ter, specifically, its relationship to Vine 
was almost symbiotic; one fed into the 
other, artistic expression crossing the 
blurred lines of vaguely related social 
media. Here, we’ve compiled a list of 
our favorite Vines. Enjoy.

My favorite Vine of all 

time is one that I have 
never been able to find 
after the first time I saw 
it (such is the tragedy of 
trying to Google 
one of these mas-
terpieces). The 
basic premise is a 
gym full of boys 
running at high 
speed, one large 
rope in hand. 
Mariah Carey, The Elusive 
Chanteuse, sings in her 
upbeat vibrato, working 
towards that impossible 
high note. As soon as she 
hits it, we discover what it 

is the boys have been pull-
ing the entire time (esti-
mated 3.5 seconds): a final 
boy appears, catapulted 
from the rope attached to 

his hips, and smash-
es into the ceiling 
above. Post-climax, 
a large part of the 
ceiling drops and 
crumbles to dust on 
the gym floor. End 
scene. (If you see or 

know anything about the 
whereabouts of this Vine, 
please email it to arts@

VINE
BACK AT IT AGAIN AT 

KRISPY KREME

This is my favorite Vine for so many 

reasons. First, the guy starts off by saying 
“Back at it again at Krispy Kreme,” 
implying that back handsprings 
in fast-food donut shops is a 
normal Friday night activity. 
Then, can we stop for a second 
to talk about the athleticism 
involved? I mean, this is the type 
of stuff that people — myself 
included — can only dream 

about pulling off, and this man seems 
to be on his way to landing it without a 
hitch, until the last split-second of the 

vine, where he kicks the neon 
sign at full force, which is where 
the Vine ends. Did he stick the 
landing? What happened to 
the sign? Did he get in trouble? 
All of these questions are left 
unanswered, and that’s what 
makes this Vine so amazing.

College: The best four years of 

your life.

Have you heard this before? 

I have, plenty. We are set up to 
believe that these four years 
are the best of the best. Leaving 
school and entering a world 
more “real” than the one within 
university borders will lead us on 
an inevitable spiral downward. 
This isn’t hopeful thinking, nor is 
it at all realistic.

In 
a 
video 
on 
Stanford 

University’s YouTube channel 
titled 
“Stanford 
Open 
Office 

Hours,” two professors, Dave 
Evans of the Design Program 
and Bill Burnett of the Design 
Program, discuss this false idea 
that college is the best and life 
following only gets worse. They 
suggest that if we are to believe 
this, that will mean that at fifty or 
sixty years old, we will be wishing 
we were our twenty-year-old 

selves. We don’t want our young 
minds to make the ultimate 
decisions about our futures. Life is 
a process and it will take us years 
to really know what we want.

We have to work gradually 

to tailor our skills and reach 
our desired future. It can’t just 
happen in one neat construction 
of a four year academic plan. That 
sets us up to believe all we have to 
look forward to is a world of the 
mundane, set in a dull workplace, 
far worse than the lives we once 
had as undergraduates.

Evans and Burnett go on to talk 

about how some of the negativity 
attached to life post-grad comes 
from confusion with what we think 
has to happen while on campus. 
We fall into a trap while declaring 
majors and minors, finding our 
directed field and starting to 
discard any of our passions that 
don’t “align” with a given major. 

If someone has many different 
interests (let’s say music, physics 
and literature), they often choose 
one and assume the others cannot 
be 
pursued. 
There 

isn’t quite a clear 
thread between those 
three 
passions, 
so 

many just choose one 
and forget about the 
rest.

These 

misconstrued 
ideas that circulate 
in 
academic 

environments 
are 

something: 
careers 

and 
passions 
have 

to be distinctly identified in 
college or after years and years 
in one profession, the prospect of 
eventually switching directions 
is impossible. This causes us to 
fix our gaze on just one thing. We 
limit ourselves, which may lead us 

to keep jobs that maybe we once 
loved and then eventually lose 
interest in. In the future, if you find 
yourself in a career that isn’t fully 

suiting your interests, 
especially because those 
interests are constantly 
evolving, both professors 
suggest you have to do 
something in order to 
fix the problem. Evans 
and Burnett warn us: 
“You really can’t solve 
a problem you’re not 
willing to have.” If you 
identify 
that 
you’ve 

let something go that 
really 
wasn’t 
worth 

abandoning, identify that as a 
problem and move forward to fix it.

We’ve confused the idea that a 

lack of narrowing in on one interest 
is a lack of progression. We want 
to specialize, but in doing so, we 
often abandon other passions that 

aren’t relevant or helpful. Love for 
music, physics and literature might 
not seem to mesh. The neat, clear 
picture of choosing one often seems 
easier to adopt.

What do Evans and Burnett say 

to the notion of forward motion?

“Don’t try to decide your way 

forward, just do something.”

I’ve lived so little life to try to 

decide my way toward the exact 
place I want to end up. Or try to 
predict the person I’ll be when I get 
there. Or even worse, put myself 
in a place now to assume life after 
college will only get worse.

This past Monday, I had the 

pleasure of hearing filmmaker Issa 
Rae (“Insecure,” “Awkward Black 
Girl”) speak at the Symposium 
keynote memorial lecture in Hill 
Auditorium, and I found that what 
she shared paralleled some of the 
ideas from the Stanford video. 
When asked about her immense 

success, she credited her career to 
the idea of just going out and doing 
something that mattered to her. In 
order to pursue her love for the arts, 
she began asking her friends and 
family to participate in her films, 
and she quickly gained a following.

It wasn’t a matter of having a 

perfect plan or abandoning certain 
interests to fit the mold of what 
could be successful to the public. 
She just created art about real 
people and real things.

Someone said to me once that 

each day you’re doing one of two 
things — you’re either getting better 
or you’re getting worse. As for me, 
I’d take future advancement at 
the expense of a coherent, neat 
life plan that revolves around 
one interest. If chaos and random 
interests are what carry me 
forward, I’m happy to say I can 
only get better.

There is more to life than college

BAILEY 
KADIAN

Maltese artist Joe Sacco to talk social justice

Activist, 
cartoonist 
and 

journalist Joe Sacco will be 
sharing his work today at the 
Michigan 
Theater. 
Sacco’s 

presentation is affiliated with 
the 
International 
Institute’s 

Conflict and Peace Initiative and 
the Penny Stamps Distinguished 
Lecture Series, and receives 
additional 
support 
from 
25 

campus co-sponsors.

A world traveler, Sacco has used 

his journeys to inspire his writing 
and drawings in order to create 
multiple award-winning novels, 
including “Days of Destruction,” 
“Days of Revolt,” “Footnotes in 
Gaza” and “Safe Area Goražde.” 
Additionally, Sacco took his real 
accounts in Europe and produced 

them into his critically acclaimed 
comic “Yahoo.” Although much 
of his work is rooted in Middle 
Eastern 
tensions 

and global justice 
issues in general, 
he did not begin in 
that field.

“I 
started 

drawing 
when 

I was about six-
years-old,” 
the 

Malta-born 
and 

American-raised 
Sacco said in an 
interview 
with 

the Daily. “I really 
enjoyed 
drawing 

funny stuff, mainly 
for humor, because I was in it for 
the laugh.”

However, as Sacco got older, 

he 
became 
more 
interested 

in connecting his humorous 
drawings with real world events 
— thus, his satirical lens led 
to more “pointed journalistic 

works.”

When asked to describe his 

work in one sentence, Sacco said: 

“The 
reality 

I see.” As an 
artist, he can 
neither 
make 

claims for every 
artistic 
viewer 

nor 
for 
the 

overall 
world. 

“I 
can 
only 

recreate 
what 

I have seen … 
it’s 
completely 

subjective,” 
he 

continued. 
“I 

cannot be the 
monopoly on the 

concept of truth.”

The 
question 
about 
the 

controversial and radical time of 
Trump’s America came into the 
interview and how Sacco would 
go about this in his work. He 
answered simply: “Comics is a 
flow form of work.”

When creating his graphics, 

he must think about how the 
drawing 
will 
represent 
“a 

long term scene,” or in other 
words, long term issues and not 
necessarily bound to this specific 
time in our nation’s history.

Finally, 
Sacco 
was 
asked 

what he believed to be the most 
important 
thing 
for 
people 

to know when reading and 
observing his work. Even as a 
popular journalist, an artist and 
an activist, Sacco answered: 
“Journalism is imperfect.”

But journalism, in all its 

various mediums — whether 
broadcast, print or radio — has 
the ability to alter the world. 
Perhaps more now than ever 
before, today’s social climate 
demands that inquisitive and self-
aware journalists, like Joe Sacco, 
remain critical in the work that 
they do in order to preserve the 
integrity of the media and defend 
the notion of truth.
