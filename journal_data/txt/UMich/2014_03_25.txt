University President-
elect reflects on
tenure as researcher
and administrator
By YARDAIN AMRON
Daily StaffReporter
PROVIDENCE, R.I. - The pro-
vost's office is on the first floor of
an unremarkable brick building.
The shades are drawn, but just out-
side lies Brown University's Main
Green, the school's equivalent to
the University's Diag. It's noon and
the pathways are bustling with
students between classes, jackets
unzipped under a tall sun.
Brown Provost Mark Schlissel
- who was selected as the Uni-
versity of Michigan's next presi-
dent in January - stands maybe
6-feet-2-inches. His suit is gray, tie
maroon and glasses neither rect-
angle nor oval. His beard is griz-
zly and beginning to lose color. He
gives a firm handshake and says,
"Take a seat wherever."
I took one of 10 seats at a long
mahogany table and looked
around. The office was grand, fea-
turing a large U-shaped desk, used
but tidy, filled bookcases across one
wall, a grandfather clock, a fire-

place with no wood, four armchairs
for intimate meetings and bamboo
shoots for a natural touch. This has
been Schlissel's situation room for
almost three years now.
He must have noticed my eyes
widening because he said, "You
should check this out," and walked
over to a wall and punched what
must have been a button. A 60-inch
television rose from a hidden com-
partment, but before it rose two
inches he clicked again and the TV
disappeared.
"Pretty neat, eh, if anyone needs
togive a presentation." I mentioned
the computer speakers on a nearby
secondary desk, and he said, "Yeah,
I joke I should have a Super Bowl
party in here."
He had missed his last oppor-
tunity, though. On Jan. 24, about
a week before Seattle blew Denver
out 48-7 in Super Bowl XLVIII,
Schlissel was in Ann Arbor accept-
ing the title of 14th president of
University of Michigan.
I asked if he knew he'd be get-
ting an office downgrade when he
arrives at the University.
"Yeah, I've seen President Cole-
man's office. I'm not too worried,"
he said. "Certain things are worth
sacrificing."
He took the seat at the head of
the table.

discuss #UMDivest,
student government
budget priorities
By KRISTEN FEDOR
Daily StaffReporter
The discussion at the Cen-
tral Student Government presi-
dential debate Monday evening
centered on the current state of
student government at the Uni-
versity, but lacked focus on spe-
cific future initiatives.
Public Policy junior Carly
Manes, a FORUM candidate,

LSA junior Ryan Hayes of The
Party Party and LSA sopho-
more Mical Holt of the Defend
Affirmative Action Party all
expressed discontent with the
status quo. Public Policy junior
Bobby Dishell, Make Michigan's
candidate, focused on his role
as current CSG vice president
and how he will expand on that
experience if elected.
In the opening statements,
Dishell specified major plat-
form points of Make Michigan,
such as increased support of
the LEAD Scholars Program to
foster minority enrollment and
the creation of a peer support
network aimed at bettering the
mental health of students across

campus. He referenced these
points several times throughout
the debates.
Manes reiterated FORUM's
commitment to increasing
diversity on campus and sup-
port of what she referred to as
"student-centered initiatives" in
her opening statement, an echo
of the party's slogan, "Empow-
erment, Not Politics."
Hayes began with a direct
criticism of CSG and said the
way student government has
functioned reveals a lack of
engagement with the student
body.
"We need to open doors,
not have people find our open
doors," he said.

open
As a single-issue party, Holt's
opening statement reflected
DAAP's focus on increasing
minority enrollment. Through-
out the debate, Holt's responses
circled back to this sentiment
of increasing minority voices on
campus.
The CSG budget was the most
divisive issue of the debate.
While every candidate agreed
that student organizations
should see increased funding,
the methods in which this goal
would be achieved and its fea-
sibility given current funding
provided intense disagreement
amongthe candidates.
Manes and Hayes held similar

Between the Dare to Dream grant
program and the Michigan Business
Challenge competition, both spon-
sored by the Zell Lurie Institute for
Entrepreneurial Studies, startups
campus-wide have won over $113,000
to boost their new businesses.
The Michigan Business Chal-
lenge, which initially included only
the Ross School of Business, has been
conducted for 31 years. The competi-
tion's campus-wide scope has encour-
aged the mingling of various colleges
within the University, creating more
diverse, successful entrepreneurial
teams.
In addition to the prize money
awarded to the four finalists, other
awards recognize specific strengths
of a team: best-written business plan,
outstanding presentation, participa-
tion, most successful undergradu-
ate team, and the Williamson Award
for the best cross-functional team. A
total of six teams won these awards.
The grand prize Pryor-Hale Award
is worth $20,000, and the runner up
receives $10,000.

The newly elected mem-
bers of the Senate Advisory
Committee on University
Affairs attended their first
meeting Monday afternoon.
At the Senate Assembly
meeting March 16, three pro-
fessors were elected to serve
three-year terms on the
committee, Pharmaceutical
Sciences Prof. David Smith;
William Schultz, professor

of mechanical engineer-
ing, naval architecture and
marine engineering and Sil-
ke-Maria Weineck, chair of
the Department of Compara-

professor of Germanic Lan-
guages and Literature.
The committee also held
SACUA officer elections for
the positions of chair and
vice chair. After some dis-
cussion and a quick paper
ballot, Scott Masten, profes-
sor of business economics
and public policy, was unani-
mously elected to the posi-
tion of SACUA chair, while
Astronomy Prof. Sally Oey
was unanimously elected to
be vice-chair.
SACUA Chair Karen Stall-

"Overall it was an
extremely positive exchange,

very informed questions,"
Staller said. "I'm very opti-

Court of Appeals
ruling may just be a
step towards the U.S.
Supreme Court
By RACHEL PREMACK
Daily News Editor
On Wednesday, the Sixth Circuit
court will hold a hearing concern-
ing same-sex marriage in Mich-
igan--the next step in what legal
experts said will likely be a lengthy
legal battle over the issue.
Late Saturday, following a deci-
sion on Friday by U.S. District Judge
Bernard Friedman to strike down .
Michigan's ban on same-sex mar-
riage, Michigan Attorney General
Bill Schuette requested a stay and
filed an appeal on the case. The U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Sixth Cir-
cuit accepted the stay, temporarily
preventing further same-sex mar-
riage licenses from being issued.
The stay is temporary and may
end Wednesday, pending the Court
of Appeals' ruling. More than 300
marriages that occurred early Sat-
urday are valid under state and
federal law. However, if the stay
progresses through the Court of
Appeals, located in Cincinnati, as
Schuette and other proponents of
traditional marriage hope, there
may be no more same-sex marriag-
es in Michigan for a longer period.

Furthermore, Schuette, repre-
senting the state of Michigan, may
file for an appeal in Friedman's
overturning of the 2004 ban. If the
Sixth Circuit Court rules in favor
of the state, same-sex marriage
will likely become illegal again in
Michigan.
However, Anna Kirkland, asso-
ciate professor in the department
of women's studies, said same-sex
marriage was likely to become
legal in Michigan.
"I think there's a clear path for
victory on this for the same-sex
couples seeking to get married,"
Kirkland said. "The fight is basi-
cally over for conservatives on this
one, I think, but it could still take
a while with some up and downs."
The legal team representing the
plaintiffs in the case, April DeBoer
and Jayne Rowse, has until Tues-
day to respond to the state's request
for a stay.
Kenneth Mogill and Carole
Stanyar, two of the five lawyers for
the plaintiffs, confirmed Monday
the legal team for the plaintiffs will
file the response Tuesday, which
comes in the form of a legal brief.
"All we can do is make the best
arguments we can, which we believe
areverystrong, andthe courtwilldo
what it does," Mogill said.
Sara Wurfel, press secretary for
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder, said
the governor is not weighing into
those issues yet.

OBERON DAY

Prof. explores bones adaptability

Maureen Devlin is an assis-
tant professor of anthropology,
specializing in how bones adapt
to certain environments. She
earned her master's in anthro-
pology from George Washington
University and her Ph.D. from
Harvard University, She has been
with the Universityfor two years.
How exactly do bones adapt?
Well, for example, while
you're still growing in height,
your bones can actually grow
thicker if you're doing a lot of
exercise because they adapt to
the mechanical environment
they're in. Tennis players will
have a thicker humerus - arm

bone - on the racket side than
on the non-racket side because
they're doing extra mechanical
loading on that side.
What research projects are
you working on right now?
Right now I'm starting a new
project about how bones grow
in different temperatures. I'm
interested in whether bones
grow to be different sizes or
shapes depending on whether
you grow up in a cooler climate
or a warmer climate. That's a
project I just started, so the
results are still to come. I'm
also part of an MCubed project,
which are University collabora-

tive grants to work with people
from different departments.
We're doing experiments to
look at how exercise and caloric
restriction affect how bones
grow.
What's your favorite
class to teach?
I really love the class I'm
teaching right now, which is
called "Nutrition and Evolu-
tion." I get to talk about junk
food, the changes in eating hab-
its of the last century, trying to
look at big patterns in the West-
ern diet. It's a lot of fun. .

Independent CSG candidate Officials: Missing plane
campaigns without agendas crashed in Indian Ocean

'Divisiveness' of
student government
politics inspire
Coumarbatch's bid
By MAX RADWIN
Daily StaffReporter
With polls for the Central
Student Government elections
opening midnight on Tuesday,
members of the various political
parties have been campaigning
for students' votes, some choos-
ing to pursue campaign videos
or chalk advertisments along the
Diag on behalf of their political
party.
LSA senior Aristide Coumar-
batch, who is running for CSG
president as an independent, is
forgoing the support of a party
because he feels it's achievable.
"I'm running to try to set a
good example for other people
H-S

so they won't feel like running
for president is out of their reach,
and also to show the importance
of creating equality and imple-
menting diversity," Coumarbatch
said.
Independent candidates often
run with the knowledge that
parties give their opponents an
advantage, and instead use the
election to raise awareness or to
spread their political message.
But Coumarbatch said he has his
eyes on the presidency.
"I wouldn't run if I didn't
think I could win," he said.
Coumarbatch said that most
of his campaigning is through
the use of hashtags such as
#Aristideforpresident2014 and
#fightingforchange on social
media sites, such as Twitter and
Facebook.
Coumarbatch is new to CSG,
with no affiliation to any pre-
vious party or time spent as a
representative. Though Cou-
marbatch said he considered
5-

creating his own party - espe-
cially since it would make get-
ting the word out that much
easier - he ultimately decided
to run as an independent.
"I'm not affiliated with a party
and I think that's what makes me
different," he said. "That par-
ties do have agendas and certain
things that they want to pass. But
as an independent, I'mjust trying
to take the word of the students,
to be the voice of the students."
Part of his decision was born
out of the divisiveness that can
overwhelm student government
politics. He said he could imag-
ine having a vice president of
a different ideology of his own
and representatives coming from
many different parties.
"I didn't really want it just to
be me and my party getting the
things that we wanted," he said.
"We could try to make a collec-
tive government with a lot of
different points of view instead
of just one party dominating the
entire government."
What Coumarbatch does
stress is a "fight for change" as
well as the need to "increase
diversity."
"I really do think that we can
help in a lot of different ways," he
said. "As time goes on, when I'm
in a position to do that, I'll have a
better answer for that."

Investigators say all
aboard perished in
mysterious case of
Flight 370
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia
(AP) - After 17 days of despera-
tion and doubt over the missing
Malaysia Airlines jet, the coun-
try's officials said an analysis of
satellite data points to a "heart-
breaking" conclusion: Flight 370
met its end inthe southernreach-
es of the Indian Ocean, and none
of those aboard survived.
The somber announcement
late Monday by Prime Minis-
ter Najib Razak left unresolved
many more troubling questions
about what went wrong aboard
the Boeing 777 to take it so far
off-course.
It also unleashed a maelstrom
of sorrow and anger among the
families of the jet's 239 passen-
gers and crew.
A solemn Najib, clad in a black
suit, read a brief statement about
what he called an unparalleled
study of the jet's last-known sig-
nals to a satellite. That analysis
showed that the missing plane,
which took off from Kuala Lum-
pur for Beijing early on March 8,
veered "to a remote location, far

from any possible landing sites."
"It is therefore with deep
sadness and regret that I must
inform you that, according to this
new data, Flight MH370 ended in
the southern Indian Ocean," he
said.
His carefully chosen words
did not directly address the fate
of those aboard. But in a sepa-
rate message, sent to some of
their relatives just before he
spoke, Malaysia Airlines officials
said that "we have to assume
beyond any reasonable doubt that
MH370 has been lost and that
none of those on board survived."
Officials said they concluded
that the flight had been lost in the
deep waters west of Perth, Aus-
tralia, based on more thorough
analysis of the brief signals the
plane sent every hour to a satel-
lite belongingto Inmarsat, a Brit-
ish company, even after other
communication systems on the
jetliner shut down.
The pings did not include any
location information. But Inmar-
sat and British aviation officials
used "a type of analysis never
before used in an investigation of
this sort" to zero in on the plane's
last direction, as it reached the
end of its fuel, Najib said.
In a statement, Inmarsat said
the company used "detailed anal-
ysis and modelling" of transmis-
sions from the Malaysia Airlines
jet and other known flights to
describe "the likely direction of
flight of MH370."
Najib gave no indication of
exactly where in the Indian
Ocean the plane was last heard
from, but searchers have sighted
possible debris in an area about
2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles)
southwest of Perth.
High waves, gale-force winds
and low-hanging clouds forced
the multinational search to be
suspended for 24 hours Tuesday,
the Australian Maritime Safety
Authority said in a statement.
Australian Transport Minis-
ter Warren Truss, who is respon-
sible for the search coordination,
said Tuesday in Canberra the

determination that the plane had
crashed shifts the search to a new
phase, but that it would be a dif-
ficult and long one.
"The Malaysian announce-
ment is purely based on the sat-
ellite imagery that's available,
the calculations about fuel and
capacity of the aircraft to stay in
the air, so it's really a long, long
way away before much can be
done bywayof physical examina-
tion," he said.
He said that under interna-
tional agreements governing air
travel "Malaysia needs to take
control" and decide how to pro-
ceed.
Truss said the Australian naval
supply ship HMAS Success had
beeninthe areawhereobjectshad
been spotted Mondaybutits crew
had been unable to find anything.
He said he did not expect the
search for debris would be scaled
back in the short term.
"Obviously, recovery of any
kind of debris that may be related
to the aircraft will be important
for the investigative stage," he
said. "So it's still important for us
to try and find as much of the air-
craft as possible."
There is also a race against
the clock to find any trace of the
plane that could lead them to the
location of the black boxes, the
common name for the cockpit
voice and data recorders, whose
battery-powered "pinger" could
stop sending signals within
two weeks. The batteries are
designed to last at least a month
and can last longer. The plane
disappeared March 8.
Some of the relatives who
gathered to listen to Najib, met
the news with shrieks and uncon-
trolled sobs. Others collapsed
into the arms of loved ones.
"My son! My son!" cried a
woman in a group of about 50
gathered at a hotel near Beijing's
airport, before falling to her
knees. Minutes later, medical
teams carried one elderly man
out of the conference room on a
stretcher, his face covered by a
jacket.

molding the plan were strong, but
malleable when presented a per-
suasive argument. For example,
Huidekoper said, he wanted to
move the engineering building
down to a part of town called the
Jewelry District.
Walkingover to a large campus
map above her desk, Huidekoper
pointed to an area far away from
the main campus.
"I think there was resistance to
that and what we did was brought
in a campus master plan group
and they went through some very
deep data analysis about how our
faculty and students interact,"
she said. "And what came out of
that was if you move engineer-
ing down there it's going to break
the fabric of the university. That's
when he said 'I've been con-
vinced' and changed his mind.
That was really his decision."
She cited Schlissel's decision to
detach the public health program
from the medical as an example of
his sometimes-bold decisiveness.
"He made the call. It was abso-
lutely his call and he decided to
separate the two and had to work
through the intense resistance
from the medical school," she
said. "He's been bold and made
some calls that weren't necessari-
ly controversial but they were just
brave and they've gone down fine
because he can explain them well.
However, the plan's perceived
priority for science, technology,
engineering and mathematics -
focuses that speak to Schlissel's
science and research background
- has taken heat, according to
articles in the Brown Daily Her-
ald, the student newspaper on
campus.
Brown senior Todd Harris,
president of the Undergraduate
Council of Students, spoke to the
tensions stirred among the stu-
dent body.
"There has been concern
among the undergraduate stu-
dents about the trajectory of the
university's investment in under-
graduates," he said. "And I think
this symbol of the 'university-
college' was something a lot of
students really grasp on to so
we pushed back on that and one
of things the president and pro-
vost did was include the mission
statement back into the Strategic
Plan."
Harris also noted Schlissel's
involvement with UCS initia-
tives such as increasing student
representation on the University
Resources Committee, the entity
that determines tuition and the
university's budget.
"It had two undergraduate stu-
dents and we wanted four. And
yeah he helped - he's the chair of
that committee and helped us get
those four students."
Yet, for all the work he's put
in, Schlissel will leave without
seeing the strategic plan' mate-
rialization. Huidekoper dropped
a few hints as to his motives for
departing Brown.
"I think Brown is a little...
parochial for his long term ambi-
tions," she said. "It's been a good
place for him to be but I think
he's really excited to have a bigger
platform."
She hesitated on the word
'parochial,' adding: "I think work-
ing on the future of a university in
the context of the health of the

state is something really intrigu-
ing to him. We don't talk that way
at Brown. We are not the Univer-
sity of Rhode Island."
To the top andback
When Schlissel assumes office
in July, he will be at the climax of
his career and at the reigns of one
of the largest and most influential
executive session, Oey asked Pol-
lack about the state of the search
for the next LSA dean. The posi-
tion is currently filled by interim
LSA dean Susan Gelman.
Pollack said the LSA dean
search is proceeding well, with a
group of finalists who are meet-
ing with University President
Mary Sue Coleman, Schlissel and
Pollack. There are some external
candidates among the finalists.
SACUA member Finn Larsen,
associate chair of the physics
department, raised a question
about the University's current
weather closure standards, and
how a consistency in decisions
can be established. Pollack said
there is a group, which includes
Christina Whitman, vice provost
for academic and faculty affairs,
and Dentistry Prof. Rex Holland,
SACUA vice chair, that works
with faculty and human resourc-
es staff to figure out when the
University needs to close.

public universities in the world.
The slipper fit, both ways.
For the University, the choice
was not a risky one.
His history matches many
presidential characteristics out-
lined in a 2012 study on "The
American College President," by
the American Council on Educa-
tion.
Today, a majority of presidents
are white, Protestant and have a
wife and kids. Schlissel is Jew-
ish, from Brooklyn and has four
kids with wife, Monica Schwebs.
Today, the average age of college
and university presidents is 61 -
Schlissel's almost 57.
Like Schlissel, about 70 percent
of presidents were full-time fac-
ulty earlier in their careers and a
majority of presidents spent their
entire professional life in higher
education.
The University's selection of
Schlissel mirrors Coleman, a
biochemist who ascended to the
presidency at about the same age.
However, Schlissel most
recently hails from a private insti-
tution, whereas Coleman was
formerly the president of the Uni-
versity of Iowa.
"One of the reasons I'm par-
ticularly excited about coming to
lead a public institution is I think
society doesn't adequately appre-
ciate the importance of public
higher education, and the evi-
dence is the continuous disinvest-
ment in public higher education,"
Schlissel said. "So I think part of
my role in leadership is also out-
wardly facing and I want to be a
strong and persuasive spokes-
man for the importance of what
Michigan and other research uni-
versities do for our current soci-
ety here in the United States and
globally."
Money could have also been
a factor. His contract runs five
years and for each, his stacks will
stand at a base of $750,000, plus
a $500,000 retention incentive
payable after five years, com-
plimentary health care and the
President's House. Coleman cur-
rently earns $603,000 a year, but
has historically donated her sal-
ary increases back to the Univer-
sity.
But the package comes with
high stakes and higher expecta-

tions.
He will be the face of the Uni-
versity and the most influen-
tial mind charting its path. And
through Ann Arbor's bitter and
snowiest winter, the campus cli-
mate has grown heated.
Take two developing stories
that have landed national head-
lines: the Being Black at Universi-
ty of Michigan Twitter campaign
- #BBUM - and the impending
federal investigation of former
football kicker Brendan Gibbons'
permanent separation from the
University.
Schlissel knows he's stepping
into big shoes and with almost 40
years in academia, he's a seasoned
veteran coming in with both ears
perked and ideology defined.
"I'm not the kind of person that
can sit in an office with the door
closed and figure out what other
people should do," he said. "I'm
much better at cultivating a bot-
toms-up approach to leadership
where I try to develop a sense of
what it is the faculty and students
are already interested in and help
build and support that."
He offered pragmatism on the
contentious topic of diversity and
minority enrollment.
"I'm confident we can make
progress," he said. "I think it's a
mistake though to think universi-
ties can solve society's problems
in this regard. It's a broader prob-
lem. The equality of opportunity
isn't just a university issue; it's
across our whole society. But in
our own house I think we can be
held responsible to work as hard
and as diligently towards this as
we can for reasons of both fair-
ness and to achieve excellence."
His eyes narrowed almost
to slits as he spoke, like he was
focusing in on some distant goal.
I asked him if he knew Uni-
versity administrators had been
meeting with BSU organizers.
"Frankly I think student pro-
test is fantastic," he said. "Some-
times it's annoying and it disrupts
the other things leadership is
trying to accomplish, but it also
serves a tremendously positive
purpose of helping us not for-
get things that are important.
Everyone needs to have their feet
held to the fire once in a while.
Although it's uncomfortable, it

actually results in progress."
Schlissel will also have to navi-
gate the prominent and delicate
relationship between athletics
and academics, and his roots in
academia place him more clearly
on one side.
"Certainly we're fortunate
that the athletic program covers
all its own costs. But there are
900 athletes and 42,000 non-
athletes and I want to be sure
they all have similar high quality
experiences. I want to keep a bit
of proportionality between how
we invest in athletics and how we
invest in academics so all our stu-
dents have that same high level
outstanding experience."
Schlissel's excitement was
muted, but his eyes look far into
the future.
"The average college presi-
dent around the United States
lasts about five years before they
wear out their welcome. I would
think if I'm successful and I can
accomplish good things onbehalf
of the university and the regents
remain interested, I could see
myself doing this for a decade but
I think that's presumptuous right
now."
After that, all that's left is
down. No matter what, expect to
see Schlissel around Ann Arbor
for long time.
"When I'm done being presi-
dent I want to go back and be a
faculty member," Schlissel said.
A presidential tradition
Outside University Hall, the
buildingthat houses the provost's
office, Mark Nickel, Brown's act-
ing director of news and commu-
nications, pointed out a piece of
the building's history.
In 1790, after Rhode Island
ratified the Constitution, George
Washington visited Brown and
was honored with a special illu-
mination - students had lit a
candle in every window of Uni-
versity Hall. From then on, a
tradition was born, and every
commencement, the building's
red brick has glowed in tribute to
a remarkable president.
When the candles are lighted
this May though, the tribute will
be for two presidents, one of the
past and another of the future.

A presumptuous policy
The state legislature should focus on employment rather than drug testing
Last Thursday, the Republican-controlled state Senate passed House
Bill 4118, which allows for suspicion-based drug testing of welfare
recipients as a pilot program in three counties. The Department
of Human Services is set to be in charge of the drug testing and will be
endowed with $500,000 to cover testing expenses. Welfare recipients
are slated to lose their benefits if they test positive or refuse to test. Gov.
Rick Snyder should reject the bill because welfare-based drug testing is
ineffective and discriminates against lower socioeconomic classes. Snyder
should focus on helping welfare recipients find reliable employment instead.

Programming education for our reality

O recent day t the library,
Iasked my friends to humor

association about

majors. This

number of ways,
but among all r

and jokes, JULIA

about one
distinct major
stuck out: computer programming.
The responses I received ranged
from hilarious to inaccurate, but the
message was clear. To most people,
computer science is still inaccessible,
intimidating and the realm of
white, possibly un-showered male
hackers who haven't seen the sun or
interacted with another human in a
non-Dungeons and Dragons scenario
in months.
In the United States and many
other countries around the world,
there is a distinct mismatch between
our perceptions and attitudes
towards computer programming and
our society's need for it. The reality is
that nearly all of us interact with and
rely on computers, phones and other
machines that require software on
a daily basis, but very few of us con-
sider ourselves to be "programmer
material" at even the most basic
level. We tweet, make Excel charts
and shop online without even a fun-
damental understanding of how the
pictures on our screens came to be
or how the words we type are used as
inputs in any form we fill out, pass-
word we type or application we use
Beyond our personal lives,
computer programming is an even
more relevant and important field.
Projections show that 1.4 million
programming jobs will be necessary
in the upcoming decade, but current
estimates predict that there will only
be 400,000 graduates in the field
over that time.
These numbers reflect some
discouraging trends in both
primary and secondary education
in the United States. Despite our
shift toward an information-based
economy, computer science is the
only subject that has declined in
popularity in U.S. schools in the
last decade. In 2012 only 1.4 percent
of high school AP students took the
computer science exam, compared
with nearly 40 percent of the same
group that took exams in English.
It's time for us to change that.

House Bill 4118 was passed by the
Michigan House in May 2013 but will return
for the approval of Senate amendments. The
bill is different from its legal precedents
due to a clause that only allows drug testing
with reasonable suspicion. Supporters of
the bill argue that the program is addressed
to protect the children of welfare recipients
whose parents potentially spend benefits
- $394 per month - on illegal drugs. If a
recipient tests positive, they will be referred
to a substance abuse agency for intervention
and ordered to pay for their drug tests.
Failure of a second drug test may result in the
suspension of benefits. Medical marijuana
and prescription drugs will not be considered
a violation of the law.
There are about 31,400 people who will be
affected by the bill. People who continually
test positive and are taken off welfare benefits
are expected to save the state $4,700 per year.
However, a similar program in Florida turned
out to be ineffective. The implementation of
the program ended up being more expensive
than cost-saving with only 2.6 percent of the
people testing positive. Similarly, Arizona
tested 87,000 people between 2009 and
2012 with only one person testing positive.

Programs such as these have proven costly
and difficult to execute.
In 1999 and 2003, similar Michigan bills
were deemed unconstitutional by a federal
judge and were struck down as unreasonable
forms of search. Legal precedent shows
that these laws aren't in accordance with
individual rights. While it's admirable that
legislators are ostensibly looking for ways to
protect children, a discriminatory procedure
that's been proven ineffective numerous times
isn't a logical solution. The legislature should
look for a better way to address the issue.
It's especially concerning that the drafting
of the law allows room for discrimination
due to the level of ambiguity. There aren't
sufficient regulations to prevent racist or
other biased suspicions. In addition, under
the law, if welfare recipients who test positive
for the drug test have children, there will be a
determined payee through whom the children
will continue to receive Family Independence
Program benefits. Such an implementation
will potentially put a lot of pressure on
children, as they will become the only ones
in the household to receive benefits. This may
further deteriorate familial relations and
only worsen the problem.

Taking a look at the bigger picture

To the Assembly of the University of
Michigan Central Student Government:
We write to endorse the divestment
resolution proposed by Students Allied for
Freedom and Equality, and supported at
last week's meeting by 300 students and
36 student organizations, including groups
representing a broad spectrum of students of
color, human rights and social interests.
The resolution calls on the University to
divest from four named U.S. corporations
and all others that directly "profit from and
facilitate the Israeli occupation and siege of
Palestinian land in violation of international
law and human rights." It is explicitly offered
that "it is the opinion of the authors that
ethical divestment fits with UM's deeply
held principles of justice and equality for
all people." In calling for divestment from
companies that profit from and enable the
commission of egregious human rights
violations, this resolution follows the model
of nonviolent economic resistance against
the Jim Crow laws of the American South
and South African apartheid. The resolution
honors the Palestinians' own call for global
nonviolent economic resistance.
The Israeli occupation destroys Palestinian
homes; depletes aquifers essential to family
farming in a fragile ecosystem; seizes sleeping
children from their beds in the middle of the
night for throwing stones at armor-plated
bulldozers that rip their centuries-old olive
trees from their family orchards before their
eyes; and has forced women in labor to give
birth on the ground at checkpoints, even
in winter, causing the deaths of women and
infants, in arbitrary exercises of total power
and control over a captive population. Victims
of South African apartheid, including former
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, after seeing it
with their own eyes, have called the Israeli
occupation "apartheid."
Growing numbers of Jews reject such
brutality and say instead: "Not in our names!"
We believe that the only path to peace and
security for Israeli Jews and Palestinians
alike follows justice, fairness and equality.
Israel, as all other nations, must adhere to
universally accepted standards of human
behavior and international law, and we join

with others in applying nonviolent economic
pressure to persuade Israel to do so. It is
not anti-Semitic for Palestinians to demand
equal rights, just as it was not anti-white
for African-Americans and South Africans
to demand equal rights, and just as it is not
bigotry against Chinese people to demand a
change in official policy and practices toward
Tibetans. The resolution that should be before
the Assembly seeks equality and fairness
and is neither racist nor discriminatory; it
is a demand for an end to oppression. The
target is not the "Jewish people," but official
misconduct by the State of Israel.
In all struggles for equality, those holding
advantaged positions will be reluctant to
relinquishthe personalbenefits ofinequality,
oppression, exploitation and slavery. When
Black South Africa turned to nonviolent
boycott and divestment campaigns to seek
equality, and when civil rights activists
in the United States tried nonviolently to
enforce the civil rights of Black Americans
in the 1960s and '70s, it was not their
nonviolent pressures that caused turmoil.
They were responding to oppression in ways
now universally recognized as appropriate.
The turmoil' was caused by the underlying
injustices and the repressive reactions to
peaceful efforts to end them. Fears of heated
debate on campus in response to peaceful
efforts to vindicate human rights provide no
justification for suppressing or abandoning
the struggle for justice.
The divestment resolution is strongly
protected free speech. The rights to petition for
and engage in boycotts and divestment in the
name of human rights and the rule of law are
afforded the highest degree of legal protection
under theFirst Amendment ofthe Constitution,
and such advocacy and related action do not
lose their protected character simply because
they may embarrass or vex others.
Please stand proudly in solidarity with the
courageous proponents of this resolution,
and make us proud of the student government
of this great University. It is the right and
just decision.

Jewish Voice for Peace National.

I'm tired. Tired of spewing facts
that fall into empty places, hearing
statistics from the "other side" that
can be easily contested with facts of
my own. It is not a game, this back
and forth, and it needs to end. I have
spenttoday, the day after the Boycott,
Divestment and Sanction bill went
before Central Student Government,
wondering what this movement
is all about. What are those in the
pro-Palestinian community at the
University trying to accomplish?
The recent pro-Palestinian
activities on campus, the mock
eviction as well as the divestment
campaign, have created an
environment that dehumanizes the
Israeli narrative and allows for no
middle ground.
I am pro-Israel, meaning I believe
Israel as a country has a right to
exist. But still I have many deeply
felt problems with its government
and its laws. These movements have
made it hard for me to come forward
and admit that, without fearing I
will look like I am demonizing the
country I love. Why is that?
Because these movements, very
intentionally, create no space for
those on both sides to come together
in conversation, ask questions and
try to understand the issues more
deeply. Some people in the pro-
Palestine community on campus
have said they will not talk to us,
those in the pro-Israel community,
because we are oppressors. I want
justice and peace for Palestinians
and Israelis. I don't believe that those
are values an oppressor possesses. I
cannot take away the title that I am
given by others, that is in their power
alone. ButI do ask that those in the
pro-Palestinian community who
say or believe these things, to think
about what you are making me into
when you deny me the right to tell my
story and when I ask to hear yours.
I am sad that it has come to this.
I do not want to have to play this
game, to share my story of hurt in
such an impersonal way, in order to
try and balance the sides. Comparing
battle wounds for the eternity of

our lives, showing our pain and the
blood of our brothers and sisters to
one another doesn't do any justice
to them, this dire situation or us.
But the conversation on campus has
been so terribly biased and one-sided
that I feel I have no place to share a
story, the narrative of a close friend
who was on the Israeli side. This is a
small attempt at showing that there
are two sides, both of which deserve
to be listened to and heard.
Growing up my family had very
little connection to Israel. We
were good friends with only one
family that lived in the land. In
2001 the husband and father of that
family was shot and murdered by
a Palestinian sniper while driving
his car down the highway. Let me
add, it was a highway within what is
agreed upon as Israel, not theWest
Bank or Gaza Strip. He kissed his
wife that morning, maybe he even
forgot, and just like that he was gone.
This man was pro-peace, pro-two-
state solution and was against the
settlements in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip. It may seem like a sad
coincidence that the only family we
knew in Israel was affected by this
war, but unfortunately that is not the
case for either side.
I'm not trying to get even. The
stories we tell, the experiences
we've all had, are just snippets of
the immense pain that this warfare
has brought to both sides. Justice
is not about getting even. If we are
killing and continuing this war in the
hope that there will be a time when
both sides feel that they have found
justice through bloodshed, that time
will never come. But if this is about
peace then let us hear those stories,
to humanize one another, feel pain
together and begin to understand.
Those shared experiences will help
us make change together.
If both sides are really searching
for peace, then there is no need for
two sides, no need for those who are
"pro" and "anti" to make their claim
before CSG. Peace is something
that can bring us all together - it is
not polarizing.

For many, joining the BDS
movement or mock eviction
campaign was done not because of
a personal connection to the land or
its people but through a dedication to
social justice and human rights. But,
social justice can only come about
through hearing both sides and by
believing in and valuing peace. The
recent pro-Palestinian movements
on campus do not share those same
values. The BDS campaign is not
trying to see the humanity in all
other human beings but rather to
erase the humanity of one very
specific group of people, those on the
pro-Israel side.
If there were a pro-peace
movement on campus that brought
together people from both sides to
join in conversation, to really talk,
to honestly admit wrongs as well as
hopes for the future, then that is a
movement I would support.
I would like to believe, I need to
believe, that I, along with Zionists
and Palestinians alike, do not
want to walk the land of Israel, or
Palestine, and wonder how many
flowers growing here are thriving
because the blood of both peoples
have nourished its roots. I don't
want to see trees and ask them
what horrors they have witnessed,
look up at the sun and see it shining
down on a place that is hopeless and
filled with hate.
If we want peace, truly want
peace, let us show it in our actions by
coming together, not apart, making
space for one another, understanding
that it takes sacrificing a bit of
ourselves and our land to allow both
peoples to live in their space. For me,
it is about loving Israel and believing
I can accept anyone that loves that
same land too. It won't be easy for
either side, but it is the only hope I
have. This is why I will never support
a movement that pretends to be about
human rights when really all it does
is continue to show that it is okay
to hate rather than to try to come
together and understand.

Ann Arbor Film

AAFF still going
strong after
five decades
By GILLIAN JAKAB
Community t Culture Editor
In an era when every
neighborhood has its own film
festival and every freshman has
made a film,
it's right to 52nd Annual
celebrate one
of the pioneers, Ann Arbor
The Ann Arbor Film Festival
Film Festival,
bringing us the March 25-30
finest in film VariousLocations
fare for 52 years.
AAFF came to Single Screen-
life at a special ing: $7-$9
moment in our
city's - and
country's - cultural history. The
1960s were charged withtheenergy
from the civil rights movement,
anti-war protests and the
flowering desire to voice individual
expression; this charge propelled
cross-disciplinary collaborations
in the arts and spawned some
insane creative works. At the heart
of Ann Arbor's art scene was the
Once Group, a community of artists
spanning many media, who put on
performance-based "happenings"
and a range of festivals. One of the
group members, George Manupelli,
foundedtheAAFF in 1963.
"My sense is that one of the
things that (Manupelli) brought to
that group was the filmmaking,"
said AAFF Executive Director
Leslie Raymond. "But there were
architects involved in the group,
musicians, dancers and it was
really out of that sort of movement
that the film festival was born."
The Festival's boundary-
blurringlegacylives on bringingus
brillianttastesofwhat'shappening
in experimental and independent
film today. Program Director
David Dinnell travels to film
festivals around the world as part
of his job. He spoke about some
of his favorites, beginning with
"From Deep," a feature-length,

experimental documentary
about basketball created by Brett
Kashmere - a timely choice as the
Wolverines bask in the glow of the
Sweet Sixteen.
"I'm absolutely not a sports fan
at all," Dinnell said. "ButI found it
a really compelling film because it
looks at American history through
basketball, which includes the
history of race in this country -
and itspends a good part of the last
third ofthe film on the intersection
of hip-hop and basketball from the
'90s on to the current time. I just
thought it was really illuminating
that way."
Grounded in a sense of history,
the festival hosts retrospective
programs revisiting the works
of prominent filmmakers and
bringing them in to talk about
their work. This year's series looks
at the works of Joseph Bernard,
Penelope Spheeris and Thom
Anderson. Bernard is an artist
from Detroit. He started out as a
painter, but worked for a decade
making collage-like films in the
Super 8 format, which was made
for small, personal filmmaking.
These films have rarely been
exhibited, making the screening
on March 26 an exceptional one.
"Joseph Bernard was at the Art
Institute of Chicago and he was
able to study with Stan Brakhage,
who was a seminal experimental
avant-garde filmmaker from the
period when the film festival came
about," Raymond said.
Spheeris, who many may
know as the director of "Wayne's
World," will be featured in the
Penny Stamps Speakers series and
the AAFF about her first "auteur"
film, "The Decline of Western
Civilization," a cult classic that
delves into the punk rock scene
of Los Angeles in the late '70s
and early '80s. In addition to
those screenings, there will be
a program for her short films,
including two shown originally
in the AAFF in 1971 and 1973.
Another of her films with a fierce
cult following, the 1984 film
"Suburbia," which features young
punk rockers and musicians of
the day (including Flea from the

Red Hot Chili Pepper's) rounds out
AAFF's Spheeris program.
"(Spheeris) has done a lot of
well-known popular films," Dinell
said "but she's also had this sort of
parallel career as an independent
filmmaker ... she has this really
amazing capability of just being
present with her subjects and
really capturing unguarded
glimpses of their lives. I think that
really comes out in the third film."
The festival is finalizing its
education program "Expanding
Frames" this year, which
offers workshops, discussions
and collaborates with various
University departments. The
favorite "What the Hell Was
That?" panel is a space to ask
questions, because, as the AAFF
staffexplain,whensomething's an
experiment, you're not supposed
to "get it," but rather observe how
you react to it.
"I think one of the things that's
really great about that panel is
that the title is really inviting in a
way," Raymond said. "There's not
a sense of barrier ... you don't have
to have a special language or you
don't have to feel like you need to
unlock a secret meaning, but this
is a place to really explore the
work andget deeper into it -meet
some of the filmmakers and things
like that."
Beginning Tuesday, the
screenings will attest to the
festival's history and tradition
of innovation. Some of the films
look back at the careers of artists,
while others push the traditional
limits of narration and imaging by
blurring the boundaries of fiction
and nonfiction, or employing new
filmmaking technologies such as
Lidar - a way to render images
through radar-like sensors.
"That kind of spirit of
exploration and personal
expression really has continued
all the way through each year,"
Dinnell said. "Technology
changes; different concerns about
the medium or about fiction -all
these things constantly evolve and
change, butI think the underlying
force is this exploration in
expression."

Music and film collide
in Bollywood culture

Before Bryan Fuller was
mesmerizing "Hannibal" viewers
on NBC, his quirky creation
"Pushing Daisies" became a quick
hit when it premiered on ABC in
2007. A victim of bad timing -
premiering just one month before
the Writers Guild Strike - the
show was only able to air nine
episodes before a 10-month hiatus
between seasons. Not surprisingly,
the show fizzled in its return and
was tragically cancelled after only
22 episodes. For its visual splendor,
fantastic imagination and
hilarious wit, "Pushing Daisies" is
gone yet not forgotten - and ripe
for a comeback. So, let's touch this
thing on the cheek and bring it
back to life in a big way. The world
needs more "Pushing Daisies," one
of television's most original and
magical series ever.

Chuck
When "Chuck" ended its run
in 2012, it ended in a way that set
up a "new beginning" for Chuck
and Sarah. If Zachary Levi and
Chris Fedak feel like they have
a story worth telling, "Chuck"
could naturally jump onto the big
screen. With a bigger budget, the
stunts could be even better and
more exciting, and the producers
could probably get a B-list movie
star to play an out-of-this-world
villain. There's potential for a
"Chuck" movie tobe huge, in both

Party Down
"Party Down" was a mediocre
TV show. The humor was quirky
and the general premise of the
show was almost too simple -
a bunch of actors, writers and
directors trying to make it in

trying to follow their dreams. The
best thingabout"Party Down"was
the cast. Featuring Jane Lynch,
Martin Starr and Kristen Bell,
as well as Adam Scott and Lizzy
Caplan as an on-again-off-again
lead romantic duo, the characters
were hilarious, charming and most
importantly, memorable. Due to
its somewhat formulaic nature, it
failed as a half-hour comedy. But
a movie version could reinvigorate
the writers, mandating a definitive
start and end point that would
help remedy structural issues and
give the actors a chance to shine.

By AMRUTHA SIVAKUMAR
Daily Arts Writer
In Bollywood, there's no
popular music without film.
Search for Bollywood music
on YouTube, and you'll get a
loud, overwhelming dance set to
melody. Search for movies, and
you'll get music suited for a party.
It's ridiculous, really. It's
strange, the idea that chart-
topping songs in India wouldn't
be where they are had they not
had a place on the soundtrack of
a movie. But at the same time, it
felt normal while I was growing
up. While classical forms of
Indian music reminded me of
crinkled, old women and dusty
cars, popular Bollywood songs
played an integral part of what
I perceived to be my culture.
A Bollywood movie without
musical interludes was a stale
experience, and music that didn't
draw any recollection of a movie
was forgotten moments after.
Since the early 1900s, the vast
majority of Bollywood movies has
been musicals. However, while
most Indian movies are inter-
spersed with music and dance,
the music is rarely considered a
natural progression of the plot
like something you would see on
Broadway. Rather, the music cre-
ates a break from the story, help-
ing the characters materialize
their inner fantasies, or giving the
writers a chance to fast forward
through several scenes at once.
Indian music is peculiar in the
way that a large share of the music
industry is embedded within the
film industry. If I were a popular
singer in India, I would always run
the risk of being overshadowed by
the actors and actresses who lip

MARRIAGE
From Page 1
"We await that court or legal
direction on this complex, unusu-
al situation," Wurfel wrote in an
e-mail interview. "It wouldn't be
appropriate for us to speculate
on these matters while legal pro-
ceedings are ongoing. We're sen-
sitive to feelings on this issue and
are hoping for a swift resolution
for all involved."
The Attorney General's office
did not provide a statement by
press time. However, Schuette
has stated that his reason for
filing an appeal concerns the
alleged violation of the federal
court ruling on the popularly-
passed 2004 vote to ban same-sex
marriage in Michigan.
"Michigan voters enshrined

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com

that decision in our State con-
stitution, and their will should
stand and be respected," Schuette
wrote in a statement. "I will con-
tinue to carry out my duty to pro-
tect and defend the Constitution."
Kirkland said that if Michi-
gan's Constitution violates the
14th amendment of the U.S. Con-
stitution, which states that all
people receive equal treatment
under the law, then Schuette's
argument is null.
The tension between state
and federal law is also clear in
the unlikely case that same-sex
marriage is deemed illegal in
Michigan. Kirkland said she was
unsure what would occur in this
situation, but marriages would
maintain their legality at the fed-
eral level.
However, same-sex couples are
seeking rights at the state level,
including health and adoption

rights.
"It would be a political issue in
the state at that point," Kirkland
said.
In any case, Washtenaw Coun-
ty Clerk Larry Kestenbaum said
that the weddings on Saturday
morning occurred legally. The
marriage licenses remain in the
county's records proving their
legality.
"In the end, when it's all done,
the state will have no choice but
to recognize them," Kestenbaum
said.
He mentioned the example
of these same-sex couples filing
joint tax returns and adopting
children, rights that married cou-
ples have.
After that, the brief willbe sub-
mitted to a panel of three appeals
judges, the makeup of which has
not been publicly announced.
The panel will either choose to

extend the initial stay - expir-
ing Wednesday - for a specified
period of time or indefinitely.
The decision on whether to
continue the stay will hinge on
who the court thinks suffers
more harm, said Jay Kaplan, staff
attorney for the ACLU of Michi-
gan LGBT Project.
"It's sort of a balancing test,"
Kaplan said. "It's looking at what
the state's interest and what the
plaintiffs' interest are, and what
is more compelling."
The court must also rule on
the request of a pending appeal
submitted by the state. The plain-
tiffs are requesting an expedited
appeal for the case.
The case may go beyond the
court of appeals all the way to the
U.S. Supreme Court. Mogill weit-
ed DeBoer v. Snyder, the series
of arguments which took place
after the state denied a same-sex

couple the joint adoption of their
children, which led to Friday's
ruling. It's also the first case since
Hollingsworth v. Perry in which a
trial with expert testimony con-
cerning LGBT matters occurred.
This 2010 Supreme Court case
allowed same-sex marriage to
resume in the state of California.
"As result of that, the district
court has made very detailed
findings of fact and determina-
tions as to credibility," Mogill said
concerning DeBoer v. Snyder. "All
that having been said though, it's
entirely up to the court to decide
which case or cases it will take."
At the University, students
envision going beyond marriage
equality.
LSA junior Robert Schwar-
zhaupt, chair of Central Stu-
dent Government's LGBT Issues
Commission, said that while
the spread of marriage equal-

ity in Michigan is an exciting
development for the LGBT com-
munity at the University, the
focus when it comes to activism
around the issue is a little more
far reaching.
"We also want to make sure
that as a community we're look-
ing toward to the future, and
understanding that marriage is
only the first step, that momen-
tum doesn't end there, that we
recognize that people's lives are
impacted by a myriad of differ-
ent things," Schwarzhaupt said.
"As a community we have a real
responsibility towards mak-
ing sure that those needs are
addressed, on a personal and on a
policy level."
Schwarzhaupt cited issues
such as education on gender
expression, healthcare and
employment rights as some of
those next steps.

"I think that helps with creat-
ing stronger ideas and building
stronger businesses," said Sarika
Gupta, program manager at the Zell
Lurie Institute. "I think it's all of
the schools within U of M coming
together and creating teams and
learning how to build businesses
together - that's probably the big-
ger theme."
The Michigan Business Chal-
lenge is comprised of four rounds,
which become increasingly difficult
as pitch time increases from three
to 25 minutes. Startup teams apply
in November and the competition
ends in late February. The compe-
tition kicked off with 68 teams and
was reduced to 16 by the second
round.
The panel of judges expects the
contestants to improve along the
way, as they acquire the tools and
knowledge to evaluate their own
business from a more professional
and realistic stance.
"Students who enter the compe-
tition don't yet have a fully devel-
oped idea," Guptasaid. "Theymight

help them go through that step by

DuringFaisal's doctoral research
in the Department of Electrical
Engineering, Faisal developed tech-

niques for improving clock genera-
tors, which he calls the "heartbeat
of all electronics" so that they con-
sume less power, are lighter and
are smaller. He added that even
today, the systems are designed
using techniques that are over four
decades old.
Faisal had little background in
business, but since the competition
was campus-wide, decided to take
his chances and sign up to give his
pitch.
"I had been thinking about it
for two years, but hadn't taken any
steps because I wasn't sure how
it was going to be, I didn't go the
business school, I didn't know how
it worked," Faisal said. "But then I
said 'okay, I'm going to sign up for
the competition and see what hap-
pens' - it was really encouraging."
He said that a large takeaway

prize money, which the team plans
to use towards patents and custom-
er acquisition, was learning how to
deal with investors.
"Therbusiness school has pro-
vided me with all of the resources
to develop my business plan, to
really do some business develop-
ment around my idea and at the
same time, College of Engineering
and the Tech Transfer Office have
helped me really figure out what
is it that I need, what are the next
steps," Faisal said.
The University is also helping to
fund his postdoctoral studies after
graduation so the idea may be fur-
ther developed.
Daniel Andersen, also a founder
of Movellus Circuits, said their
collaboration has blended their

distinct expertise to give them an
advantage in the competition.
"It really helps for us to have a
technology expert on the team, as
well as me, coming from the busi-
ness school and having the busi-
ness background," Andersen said.
"Having a balance of the two really
gave us an edge over some of the
teams that maybe just had one or
the other."
The panel of judges rotates each
round and is made up of entrepre-
neurs, investors, venture capitalists
and service providers from the Ann
Arbor area. Aside from the pros-
pect of winning the cash awards,
the competition also supports net-
working and business development.
Finalists are evaluated based on
their ability to take risks, proposed
financial strategy, management
capability, and competitive advan-
tage in their industry.
Gupta added that even in the
beginning rounds, it is typical for
judges to show interest in teams,
especially those involved in similar
industries. By the end, some ven-
ture capitalists and investors ask
the University, with whom they
already have connections, to put
them in touch with the competitors
so that they may conduct further
business.
During the competition, part-
ners learn from each other's back-
ground, but at the same time are
exposed to the wider range of busi-
ness ideas by conversing with other
teams.
"What helps is learning from
other people's mistakes by watch-
ingother people presentand seethe
questions that the judges asked."

Andersen said.
The University's involvement
extend past the boundaries of the
competition, with the business
school's funding for Movellus Cir-
cuit to participate in various other
business competitions at both the
University of Texas in Austin and at
Rice University in Houston. Ander-
sen said that in preparation for
these events, the Zell Lurie Insti-
tute matches them with professors
who lead sessions as well as individ-
ual meetings based upon their own
first hand knowledge of business.
The other finalists include Flipsi,
a reusable water bottle that can
be flipped inside-out, Keravnos
Energy, an energy systems geared
towards electric vehicle drivers and
MyDermPortal, a web-based medi-
cal application that provides follow-
up treatment more efficiently.
The finalist teams also won
grants from the Dare to Dream
program, which awarded a total
of around $50,000 to startups this
year. The program also offers busi-
ness development seminars. Other
resources available to startups
through the University include
the TechArb, a University startup
acceleratorthatgives office space to
promising student-run companies
still in their early stages.
Startups do not always begin
at the Ross School of Business.
The University's interdisciplin-
ary approach to award allocation
and startup program participation
has helped the trend spread across
campus.
"They're definitely a lot of
resources around campus to foster
entrepreneurship," Andersen said.

stances on the issue. Both said
they have goals of increasing
funding for student organiza-
tions to exceed 50 percent of
the total CSG budget. How-
ever, both candidates also said
they do not believe in raising
the current $7.19 fee students
pay towards CSG as part of
their tuition payments. They
said a more efficient restruc-
turing of the budget is possible
without increasing these fees.
Manes said she does not
believe CSG has functioned
well enough to be able to ask
for more money.
"Student government has
not been accountable enough
to the students yet to trust
in the student government
enough to take more of their
money," she said.
Hayes said he is confident
he would be able to find a way
to allocate more money to
student organization funding
without a fee increase.
"If you want something, you
can make a budget happen," he
said.
Dishell spoke about his
experience dealing with the
CSG budget. He said in the
past year, the overall executive
budget was severely cut and
the resulting increase in cash
flow was redirected towards
the Student Organizations
Funding Commission. He said
they zeroed out all Execu-
tive Commission budgets at
the start of the year and made
them reapply for funding as
the year progressed.
In past years, the individu-
al commission budgets were
preset at the start of the year.
Dishell said the only way he
would have been able to reach
the goal of 50 percent of the
budget for student organiza-
tions would be if CSG cut its
Program Manager.
As a solution, Dishell said he
supports a $2 increase to the
$7.19 student government fee.
He said a fee increase would
supply the funds necessary to
increase funding for student
organizations.
"I feel terribly every time a
student org has to get turned
away," he said. "We simply
need more money to give out
to student orgs."
Dishell added that he is the
only candidate who has expe-
rience directly working with
the CSG budget. In response,
Manes and Hayes both reit-
erated that they feel they are
competent to deal with this
issue. Manes said she has
experience with the LSA stu-
dent government budget.
Hayes said that Dishell's
experience is invaluable, but
that this should not dictate
the legitimacy of other candi-
dates.
"If that's the precedence,
why don't we always just
reelect the incumbent?" he
said.
Dishell pointed to his
experience as vice president
again later when a question
was raised from the audience

regarding the respective can-
didates' role in campus activ-
ism.
"What's important as you
come into your role as a leader
as a representative of 43,000
voices is that you know how
to be an activist for a student
voice, not just for one cause,"
he said. "We've done that this
past year. That's evidenced
by our work, that's evidenced

by the national press we've
gotten, and that's evidenced
the regents' reports and their
comments tous."
Manes said she has identi-
fied as a student activist since
her freshmanyear and she will
continue to do so whether or
not she is elected.
"Student activism is the
most effective tactic to achiev-
ing goals on campus," she said.
Hayes said The Party Party
would increase the role of stu-
dent activism on campus. He
pointed to the #BBUM move-
ment as an effective use of the
student voice. He said student
government needs to make
more of an effort to engage the
student voice.
"You can't wait for some-
thing to happen," he said. "For
43,000 people, there is liter-
ally less than a lecture hall
here."
The candidates also dis-
cussed the #UMDivest move-
ment. They were to commit
to a decision on the resolu-
tion proposed that CSG sup-
port divestment from several
companies. Dishell and Manes
both said they do not support
the resolution. Holt was the
only candidate who said he
supported divestment.
Hayes did notspedify, his
personal decision on the
divestment resolution.
"It should be a composition
of student voices. It is not my
personal decision," he said.
Regarding the decision of
CSG to table the resolution
indefinitely, Manes reiterated
that she voted against this
decision, regardless of her per-
sonal opinion regarding the
resolution.
"It matters to students, it
should matter to their student
government," she said.
Dishell said that this was a
decision of the CSG Assembly
and not within his power as
an executive member of CSG.
However, he said he regrets
not meeting with SAFE mem-
bers earlier to hear their con-
cerns following last Tuesday's
meeting.
Hayes said Dishell's tech-
nical role should not be taken
into consideration when
addressing the decision of CSG
to postpone the vote on the
divestment resolution.
"We should never wait to
engage," he said.
In closing statements, Holt
reiterated DAAP's commit-
ment to addressing issues such
as racism and sexism on cam-
pus.
Manes said she is running
because she wants to see a
change in the way CSG oper-
ates. She said that even if she
does not win, she will contin-
ue to be a student activist and
address the issues raised in
FORUM's platform.
"We know student govern-
ment has failed students, and
that's why we are running,"
she said.
Dishell reiterated Make
Michgian's campaign slogan
multiple times in his closing
statements, saying that the
party will "Make the Differ-
ence."

Hayes was the final speaker
of the debate and repeated
that he believes student gov-
ernment has not been effective
in engaging students. He said
The Party Party would be the
change that is needed. He ref-
erenced the comical #SaveR-
oss video that has received
over 2,500 views in its first day
as a testament to his ability to
spark interest in student gov-
ernment moving forward.

Beckwith's journey through the unexpecte

Sophomore endures
recovery path after
season-ending
wrist surgery
By BRAD WHIPPLE
Daily Sports Writer
On a rainy Wednesday,
Canham Natatorium - an old,
bricked building - is a retreat
to find warmth from the cold
Ann Arbor morning. To many,
this place is a sight for winning
championships and shattering
records. For others, it's home.
The lane lines are set, and
twenty-some maize-capped
athletes are swimming laps as
part of their daily routine, the
block 'M' bobbing up and down
in the water. The Michigan
water polo team looks healthy
and full of energy at first glance,
and it should - the Wolverines
have won their last 12 games.
But one player stands out
among the rest.
Bryce Beckwith's goggles

splint, which gradually rotates
her hand upward as if she were
reading a book. With roughly
55 degrees of rotation left, she
doesn't have full mobility.
But Beckwith is able to get
through the pain and make a
running joke about her "giant
and kind of embarrassing"
brace.
"Now the term is my Robocop
arm," she said. "I love it. I
Instagrammed a picture of it
saying 'I am Robocop,' with
'#Robocop,' which I thought
was funny. I don't know why I
didn't get more likes on it."
"I think in total, you really
have to expect the unexpected."
Beckwith expected to make
a strong entrance into her
sophomore season, but instead
watched it fly by while she sat on
the bench. With her whiteboard
and marker in hand, she wanted
nothing more than to be in
the water. to find twine and to
rightftully earn a win.
The entire injuryinitiallytook
a toll on her mentally, leaving
her without her dominant hand
for months.
Though her teammates were
largely involved in leading the
way through adversity, it was
mostly a matter of Beckwith
changing herownperspective.

the words Beckwith woke
up to from the doctor. What
was originally thought to be a
four-week recovery from scar
tissue turned into a much more
arduous journey.
"I didn't expect that,"
Beckwith said. "I thought I was
going to come back and play the
season, but you've just got to roll
with the punches, I guess."
Coming out of surgery,
Beckwith had to wear a series
of different splints for her right
arm: first a soft splint, then a
hard one and then a plastic one,
the latter of which limited her
mobility the most.
She spent the fall semester
with one hand, making easy
tasks like opening a door or
taking notes in class dreadful.
Things that she did without
thinking twice left her
distraught by the end of the day.
Beckwith has always had
her teammates by her side to
buoy her spirits. They made a
heartwarming video for her
to watch after surgery and
sent "get-well" postcards,

sophomore two-meter Barbara
Lanier helped Beckwith scoop
ice cream onto a cone even
though it took almost an hour.
It was the little things that
made a positive difference
for Beckwith. It was the little
things that pushed her away
from the breaking point. And
the push was forceful enough to
keep her smiling.
"Having a positive mentality
and being able to accept the
reality of it was something I did
really quickly," she said.
"Win the game."
Beckwith stands near the
outside of a team huddle during
a timeout. Those words are

during games.
According to Anderson, she's

Wagner was put in for Betsa

had to adjust following an
uncharacteristic start, and it did.
The Hoosiers allowed 12 runs

"I've seen (the nerves) in other

"It's most important that you

first series of plays out of the
timeout, the player to rise up
was sophomore forward Glenn
Robinson III.
With the lead at 13 thanks to
the Michigan men's basketball
team's 11th triple of the game
- it finished with 14, a school
record in NCAA Tournament -
it seemed that shots from deep
would keep falling in a game
that was starting to mimic the
seventh-ranked Wolverines'
Elite Eight matchup against
Florida last season.
But after a basket from
sophomore guard Nik Stauskas,
Michigan's lead in the Round of
32 against Texas shrunk to eight.
With the Longhorns
operating a mix of man defense,
a 2-3 zone and a 1-3-1 zone,
Michigan coach John Beilein
called a 30-second timeout with
8:27 left in the game.
In the timeout, Beilein could
have rehashed a few of the
previous possessions, which
resulted in a bevy of offensive
rebounds for Texas, and in
result, missed opportunities for
No. 2-seed Michigan (27-8) to
get the ball out in transition.
Instead, though, Beilein
focused on how to adjust
moving forward.

Pipeline continues

After losing two five-star
recruits, Michigan's 2015
football recruiting class received
a much-needed jolt in the form
of cornerback Garrett Taylor,
Monday afternoon,
Taylor gave the Wolverines
coaching staff its sixth verbal
commitment. The 6-foot-1,
188-pound four-star prospect
chose Michigan over Stanford,
Michigan State, South Carolina
and Tennessee.
Taylor tweeted out his
decision Monday afternoon.
The Richmond, Va. native is
the third defensive back commit
of the 2015 class, joining Shaun
Crawford and Tyree Kinnel,
both four-star commitments.
"Michigan is a great school as
well as agreatfootball program,"
Taylor told Rivals.com. "We saw
all the academic facilities and all
the academic support they have.
They definitely have a good plan
for you to stay on track for all
four years and to graduate."
Three-star offensive lineman
Jon Runyan Jr. and kicker
Andrew David currently round
out the Wolverines' class.
Taylor became new
cornerbacks coach Roy
Manning's first commitment
at his new coaching position.
He also has the physical traits
that defensive coordinator
Greg Mattison covets in his
cornerbacks.
"The coaches there are great,"
Taylor told Rivals.com. "Coach
Mattison is trying to play more

wants tall, long corners, and

Assistant coach Bacari Alexander helped inspire Michigan during a timeout that changed the course of the game.

I fit that description. I like to
play press-man coverage, so I
definitely like that.
"Coach Manning is my
position coach and recruiting
coordinator. He is a great guy and
I've built a strong relationship
with him."
Taylor has found his success
as an aggressive corner who
can jam receivers at the line
of scrimmage - something
the Wolverines have lacked in
recent years.
The new Michigan commit is
also strong in the run game and
has a knack for making big plays.
"Taylor's a smart kid,"
247Sports' Steve Lorenz said.
"He's usually going to make the
right play or put himself in the
position to make the right play.
"He's a huge pickup."
Taylor's commitment
further strengthens Michigan's
recruiting pipeline to the state
of Virginia. The Wolverines have
snagged two elite prospects from
the state in their last two classes:
freshman quarterback Wilton
Speight and sophomore running
back Derrick Green.
Taylor's commitment should
only grow this trend. The
Wolverines are currently in
the mix for a Virginia prospect
Clelin Ferrell - a four-star
defensive end in the 2015
class - who Lorenz believes
should take notice of Taylor's
commitment.
"This is (Manning's) first big
pull out of Virginia," Lorenz
said. "He's a pretty damn good
recruiter."
With Taylor's commitment,
Michigan is back on track to
welcome what could become a
top-ranked 2015 class.
And as a bonus, the
Wolverines have also secured a
stronghold on one of the nation's
top hotbeds of talent.

Added freshman guard
Derrick Walton Jr.: "He's back

driving the ball with confidence.
You're just seeing typical Glenn

The break also allowed
Michigan's coaching staff
to remind its players how it
started the contest - playing
eight straight minutes of non-
disruptive basketball that wore
out Texas and its big men.
"When you're sitting there
on the sideline, you know that
it's hard to play for 40 minutes
the way you play the first eight
minutes," said assistant coach
Jeff Meyer. "You know there's
going to be runs made."
As much as the different
zones the Longhorns brought
out and their ability to
offensive rebound in the

second half caused some
errors and confusion among
the Wolverines, the timeout
allowed Michigan to adjust for
the better and regain control for
the rest of the game.
"We decided to go back to
our man-action (offense), which
gave our kids a little bit more
comfort," Meyer said. "Our guys
made shots.
"There was just a comfort
level."
With Robinson leading his
team to victory at the most
important time of the year,
Michigan will need to ride him to
advance further in the Big Dance.
And after scoring 14 points
in each of Michigan's NCAA
Tournament games, it's hard to
forget Michigan's record when
Robinson has reached double-
digits over the past two years:
44-5.

Goree approaches record

Cyesha Goree acted like it
didn't matter. Michigan coach
Kim Barnes Arico didn't even
know.
After the Michigan women's
basketball team dispatched
Duquesne, 68-52, in the second
round of the WNIT, Goree was
just two rebounds shy of tying
the single-season program
record. After recording11 boards
in the Wolverine victory, the
junior forward has amassed 309,
two fewer than Trish Andrew's
311 in 1993.
When Michigan heads to
Bowling Green for its third-round
game Thursday night, Goree will
undoubtedly break the record.
"No way," Barnes Arico said
in disbelief.
