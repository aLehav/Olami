ITS staff scrambles
to protect Wolverine
Access, CTools after
high-stakes breach
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily News Editor
The University's Information
and Technology Services staff
are working to combat a securi-
ty flaw that left sensitive infor-
mation on some of the Internet's
most visited sites - as well as
key University portals - vulner-
able to prying eyes.
The flaw was first discovered
last week by Finnish research-
ers and engineers at Google and
made public Monday. But unlike
the December Target security
breach in which thousands of
credit card numbers were sto-
len from the retailer's servers,
this particular finding - now
nicknamed "Heartbleed" -
stemmed from a coding error
in a standard Internet security
platform.
Though it's uncertain wheth-
er any passwords or data were
compromised by the flaw, major
websites such as Facebook,

Google, Yahoo and Amazon
quickly patched the defective
code, The New York Times
reported. Many others are
scramblingto prevent data theft
and secure their affected serv-
ers.
In an interview Wednesday
evening, Paul Howell, the Uni-
versity's chief security officer,
said Information and Technolo-
gy Services staff had fixed most
of the affected University's sites
Monday, including Wolverine
Access and CTools.
"The severity of the issue was
apparent and teams here and
at many universities have been
working around the clock to get
servers patched and to get fixes
in place," Howell said.
OpenSSL, the affected soft-
ware, is a toolkit included in
many webserver programs,
such as Apache, that is designed
to encrypt communication
between web browsers and
servers.
Michael Bailey, an associate
research professor of electrical
engineering and computer sci-
ence, said OpenSSL is a tool that
is supposed to keep Internet
users secure.
For example, OpenSSL
prevents others from eaves-

dropping on communication
between a professor entering
grades in CTools from his or
her browser and the Universi-
ty's server that runs CTools.It
ensures no one else can modify
the grades between the profes-
sor's input and their registry in
CTools and lets the professor
know it's really CTools, and not
an imposter site, into which the
sensitive information is being
entered.
The same principles apply to a
student using Facebook. OpenS-
SL ensures information dissem-
inated between one's Internet
browser and Facebook server is
done so securely.
But websites using the March
2012 version of OpenSSL have
not been protected due to the
coding error that - unknown
until last week - has existed
since the version's release and
has left scores of websites vul-
nerable for more than two years.
While there are different
security programs and versions
available, The New York Times
estimated the flaw in OpenSSL
2012 versions affects two-thirds
of Internet sites.

ed Tuesday by Bailey and Alex

The title of Wednesday's

On Wednesday, the LSA organized the event, which
Honors Program hosted an was held at the Literati Book-
event aimed to explore a broad store at 124 E. Washington St.

Wright said the event helped
improve relationships between
students and staff by provid-
ing a safe space for students
to speak and learn more about
different identities at the Uni-
versity.
"We thought this would be a
great, creative way for students
to express their thoughts, and
we really wanted to tie it in to
what it means to be here at the
University," Wright said.

BUSINESS
Students build
app to keep
track of friends

Student-launched
app 'Merge' shows
others' free time
By ARIANA ASSAFF
Daily StaffReporter
Early on in their freshman
year, Business sophomores Dan-
iel Steinmetz and Brandon Alster
discovered how hard it could
be to connect with friends on
short notice. Oftentimes, they'd
find themselves spending time
between classes reaching out to
friends who were already busy,
and they needed something that
could instantly tell them which
friends were available.
In January 2013, Steinmetz
and Alster began brainstorming
ideas for a project they would
come to call Merge - a social
networking app that allows col-
lege students to instantly com-
pare schedules - designed to
make meeting up with friends
quick and easy.
Steinmetz and Alster enlisted
University alum Josh Sklar and
LSA junior Nathan Pilcowitz,
an iOS designer, in April 2013 to
bring the app to life. Now, stu-
dents can use Merge to meet
friends for coffee, plan group
projects and find out what
friends are up to.

The current version of Merge
includes a buddy list that shows
users which of their friends are
available at any given time. Stu-
dents can message available
friends through the app, and cre-
ate "events" to designate a time
and place to meet.
The app also has a comprehen-
sive list of courses that students
can add to their unique profiles.
Steinmetz and Alster used pub-
lic databases to load most course
information into their app, while
classes in the Business school
and the School of Information
had to be manually loaded.
"Merge is for the busy, driven
college student who wants to stay
social, but wants to save a lot of
time doing sotoo," Alster said.
As of the Fall 2014 semester,
Merge had accumulated 1,500
users. They released a video on
Monday to explain and promote
the app.
For now, Merge is a nonprofit
endeavor. Steinmetz and Alster
said their priority is creating
a good product and increasing
their user base. Until recently,
they were paying out-of-pocket
to get their idea off the ground.
"We believed in the idea, but
didn't have all this money to
spend on an app," Alster said.
"We figured if we could get an
investor, it'd be worth it."

County Circuit Judge to
direct Dearborn program

Student duo places second
in national debate contest

Shelton leaves bench
for role in criminal
justice program
By SHOHAM GEVA
Daily StaffReporter
After 24 years of service,
Washtenaw County Circuit
Court Judge Donald Shelton
announced Tuesday that he will
step down in four months early to
take a position at the University
of Michigan-Dearborn campus.
Shelton will be the new
director of Dearborn's criminal
justice program and an associate
professor starting in the Fall 2014
term. Shelton's term as judge was
set to expire Jan. 1, 2015 but will
now end Sep. 1, 2014.
In an interview Wednesday,
Shelton said stepping down
wasn't an easy decision, with or
without the last four months of
his term.
H-S

"Leaving the bench is always
a difficult decision, like leaving
anything else you've done for
almost a quarter of a century,"
Shelton said. "But frankly, four
months difference doesn't
change any of those feelings. I've
enjoyed being a judge, but I've
been preparing for and looking
forward to being a teacher for a
long time."
Shelton has previously held
positions as an adjunct professor
in several fields, including
criminology and politicalscience,
at Eastern Michigan University
and Cooley Law School. He also
served on Eastern Michigan's
Board of Regents from 1987 to
1990 and was the mayor of Saline
from 1978 to 1986.
As the director of the criminal
justice program, Shelton said his
plan for his first semester is to
learn as much as he can.
"One of the things I learned
a long time ago is that when
you come into a new program
5-M

the first thing you should do is
be a sponge and keep quiet and
listen," Shelton said. "That's
my first objective for the first
semester I'm there."
After that, he said he'd like
to increase focus on forensic
science, which is his area of
research specialty.
Barry Pyle, a political science
professor at Eastern Michigan
University, said Shelton has pro-
vided valuable contributions to
the department at EMU as an
adjunct professor and is quali-
fied for a full time academic
position.
"Judge Shelton has opened up
his chambers to a number of our
students to work closely with
him while he was a judge to give
them hands on experience," Pyle
said. "He was able to take a lot of
his real life experience into the
classroom here on campus and
give students a realistic view of
what it's like to be in a circuit
court dealing with drugs, and
crime, and family law issues."
This term would have been
Shelton's last as a judge even if
he hadn't chosen to accept the
Dearborn position. Michigan
law prevents individuals at or
over the age of 70 from being
elected or appointed to a judicial
position.
Local lawyers Veronique Liem
and Mike Woodyard announced
plans earlier this year to run for
his seat.
Judge Darlene A. O'Brien, who
serves alongside Shelton on the
court, said that Shelton has been
a strong leader and an asset to the
citizens of Washtenaw County
during his time on the court.
"Judge Shelton will be missed,
but I'm equally certain that he'll
add great value to the University
of Michigan-Dearborn's
Criminal Justice program,"
O'Brien said.
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder
will be responsible for appoint-
ing someone to fill the seat for
the four months left in Shelton's
term after he steps down in Sep-
tember.

Team records best
season finish for
University since 1991
By MAYA KALMAN
Daily StaffReporter
Business junior Ellis Allen
and LSA junior Alex Pappas
took home the second place
title at the 2014 National Debate
Tournament on March 31 at
Indiana University.
Allen and Pappas defeated
Harvard University in the
semifinals and narrowly lost
to Georgetown University in
the final round, earning the
University second place for the
first time since 1991.
Aaron Kall, who has served as
director of the debate team since
2010, said Pappas and Allen's
time commitment and efficiency
are what allowed them to come
this far.
"Work ethic is something
that's very important and our
debaters spend a lot of time
researching- the topic and
spending time practicing so
I think that's something that
really sets us apart," Kall said.
Kall said the most dedicated
debaters spend 20 to 40 hours

each week preparing for debate,
while also maintaining high
grades as full-time students. The
average GPA of the debate team
was about 3.75 last semester.
Pappas said the team's
willingness to work hard and
the vast resources the University
has to offer were also important
in the team's success.
"I really think the resources
of Michigan are sort of what
allows us to excel," he said. "I
think my partner and I have just
invested so much time and that
we're pretty darn good at it."
Allen added that the team's
success could also be attributed
to the initiative of the students
on the team.
"I think it's one of the more
student-driven ones," he said.
"There are a lot of teams out
there who have phenomenal
coaching staffs but everything,
all the work we put out is
student-motivated here and that
also gives us a lot of creative
control over what we do."
Both Allen and Pappas agreed
that success at debate is based
on the amount of work you put
in, beginning early in the year
and continuing throughout.
"I think its just preparation,
preparation, preparation,"
Pappas said. "It can be a single

piece of' evidence that's the
difference between winning and
losing."
The University has
participated in the National
Debate Tournament since 1971,
winning second place three
times, but has never taken home
the championship. Nevertheless,
Kall is optimistic about next
year, given that Pappas and
Allen will have the opportunity
to build off their success going
into their senior season.
"They've got a great chance,
probably as good a chance as
anyone next year to win the
national title, to win that final
debate, and so we're really
looking forward to next year as
well," Kall said.
Pappas and Allen both said
they hope to win the National
Debate Championship next year
and win the Copeland Award,
an award for the top-ranked
national team of the year.
"Wekindofhopeforthisgreat
end of the season," Kall said.
"But close defeat just motivates
our students to work harder,
to spend more time practicing,
more time on research, and to
kind of get them motivated to
just take it to that very next and
final level next year to win the
national championship."

Park declines additional wolves

With population
dwindling, officials
promise new plan
TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP)
- No additional gray wolves will
be transplanted to Isle Royale
National Park for now, the park's
top manager said Wednesday,
despite concerns that the Lake
Superior island chain's dwin-
dling and inbred population
might not survive much longer.
After consulting with experts
and reviewing comments from

the public, Isle Royale Superin-
tendent Phyllis Green said staff-
ers will develop a management
plan that considers the wolves'
long-term survival prospects
and their interactions with
moose. The two species' preda-
tor-prey relationship is the sub-
ject of one of the world's longest
scientific studies of its type, now
in its S6th year.
It will take about three years
to craft the plan, which also will
focus on park vegetation and the
effects of climate change, Green
said. Officials could reconsider
augmenting the wolf population
k

if gender imbalance prevents
them from reproducing or if
moose begin overbrowsing trees
and bushes, stripping them of
leaves and needles.
"As long as there'sa breeding
population, we're going to let
these animals have a chance
to live their lives without us
intervening," Green said.
Scientists, park officials and
wildlife advocates are divided
over whether to attempt a
rescue of the wolves, a popular
attraction for visitors even
though most never glimpse the
wily creatures.

APP
From Page 1A
Merge secured its first inves-
tor in the beginning of March,
and plansto start hiringstudents
to help expand Merge to other
schools.
During the process of develop-
ing Merge, Steinmetz and Alster
realized they weren't the only
ones with an idea for another
social networking app.
However, Steinmetz said, "it's
not always who does it first, it's
who does it right first."
They plan to add more new
features to Merge over the sum-

mer while expanding to more
schools like Cornell University
and the University of Pennsyl-
vania.
One major addition involves a
Snapchat-like function that will
allow users to select multiple
buddies to Merge with, creat-
ing an event for everyone that's
available.
And, similar to the Venmo
app, atriple newsfeed will allow
users to easily keep track of pri-
vate interactions, interactions
among just their Merge buddy
list or public interactions that
any Merge user can see.
"The biggest part of the fea-
ture is that you can make it pub-

lic, private, or for your friends,"
Steinmetz said. "We think it's
really fun to look through this
and see what our friends are
paying each other for. You get to
see what people are up to."
Updates to the app will also
allow users to classify their
events, enabling others to join
public events.
Because Merge is designed
as a daily scheduler more than
a long-term calendar, the devel-
opers decided against synching
users' Merge schedules with
other calendars, as some other
social networking apps have
done.

nuclear weapons that are real,"
Pozzi said. "There are nations
that are trying to develop overt,
or even covert, nuclear weap-

possibility that terrorists might
acquire and use nuclear weap-

problems, so the consortium will
address these big issues."
The Nuclear Non-Prolifer-

force in 1970, has three major
tenets: disarmament by current
nuclear countries, nonprolifera-

and the right of all countries to
pursue peaceful nuclear energy.
Of the world's 195 countries, 190
have signed the treaty. Notable
exceptions are India, Israel, Pak-

Korea, which withdrew in 2003.

countries that have more preven-
tative health policies - contrary
to most U.S. delivery models -
showed fewer instances of health
problems related to each area of
concern.
For example, he said countries
with stricter tobacco control regu-
lations and preventative measures
to discourage smoking had fewer
smokers, lower cigarette sales
and fewer smoking-related health
issues in the population.
Mackenbach discussed possible
reasons for the existing dispari-
ties. He found that many coun-
tries which could benefit from
improved healthcare models often

could help agencies, such as the
International Atomic Energy
Agency, detect these specific
geophysical signatures, alerting
them that a country is conduct-
ing illegal tests.
Another important arm of
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty will allow nations to
pursue nuclear energy without
developing nuclear weapons.
But monitoring nuclear material
to ensure that it is not enriched
into weapons-grade forms such
as plutonium, uranium-233 and
uranium-235 is currently a time-
intensive and costly enterprise
that relies on quickly disappear-
ing materials.
Current detection systems rely
on a material called helium-3,
which is growing increasingly
rare because it was manufac-
tured largely as a byproduct of
nuclear weapons manufactur-
ing. Researchers from the Cen-
ter hope to create new detection
devices that rely on specific
emissions of neutrons - small
particles that make up atoms -
to detect enriched radioactive
material.
Researchers also said they
hope the new technology would
enable inspectors to monitor
nuclear material without open-
possess the means to do so, but are
stymied by the political, social and
cultural climate of the country.

Detroit reaches bankruptcy
deal with $388M in bonds

Decision is only a
small fraction of
overall case
DETROIT (AP) - The city of
Detroit reached a deal in bank-
ruptcy over $388 million in bonds,
mediators announced Wednes-
day, a significant agreement that
could influence other creditors to
try to geta settlement.
Detroit will pay 74 cents for
each dollar. Roughly $50 million
in tax revenue that won't be need-
ed to pay the balance instead will
go to a fund to help low-income
retirees who are expected to see
smaller checks when the bank-
ruptcy case ends.
The deal still needs the bless-
ing of Judge Steven Rhodes and is
only a small part of the $18 billion
case, the largest bankruptcy by a
local government in U.S. history.
Detroit emergency manager
Kevyn Orr, appointed by the state
to run the city, said he hopes to
announce more deals soon.
"It's important that people get
on the bandwagon," Orr told The
Associated Press, referring to
other creditors, especially unions,
who have been privately meeting
with the city and mediators.

Earlier, on CNBC, Orr said he
doesn't want to turn to a "cram-
down," a bankruptcy term that
gives a judge sweeping power to
settle disputes.
The aid for low-income retirees
was welcomed by a spokesman for
the police and fire pension fund.
"However, whether the settle-
ment as a whole is advantageous
to the city and to the retirement
systems - we just do not know,"
Bruce Babiarz said.
Detroit hopes to exit bankrupt-
cy by October, but the city's plan
first faces a series of court hear-
ings in summer. The most divisive
issue: cuts to pensions.
The city is proposing a 6 per-
cent cut for retired police officers
and firefighters, and a 26 percent
cut for other retirees. The differ-
ence is tied to the health of the
two pension funds.
The size of those cuts assumes
that foundations, the state of
Michigan and other philanthro-
pists contribute $816 million to
help pensioners and prevent the
sale of city-owned art. If retir-
ees and city employees reject the
cuts, the outside money vanishes
and pensions would be slashed
even more.
Anthony Sabino, a bankruptcy
expert and St. John's University

law professor, said the bond deal
is a "good sign of progress" in the
case.
"We call that taking a hair-
cut," he said. "That's fairly typi-
cal for bondholders in a corporate
bankruptcy. There usually is a
restatement of terms, and the
bondholders take some kind of
reduction."
Bondholders earlier had been
offered 15 cents on the dollar, but
Orr said there was a risk that the
city would lose access to a prop-
erty tax earmarked for debt if it
didn't make a better deal.
Separately,-a group of creditors
with eyes on Detroit's art said it
has found buyers willing to pay
more than $1 billion for parts or
all of the collection. Creditors are
asking the judge to order Orr to
cooperate with interested parties.
New York-based Art Capital
Group said it would arrange $2
billion in loans to Detroit with
art at the Detroit Institute of Arts
used as collateral. Orr, however,
told AP he's not interested and
will stick with a plan to raise
money from foundations and the
state.
"We've committed ourselves to
that bargain. No one can compel
the city to sell assets," Orr said.

A-matter of morals
Michigan shouldn't need an economic basis to ban discrimination
The Business Leaders for Michigan have recently thrown their
support behind the banning of employment discrimination based
on sexual orientation. These leaders have rationalized their support
on the basis of an economic argument, claiming that states who limit this
kind of discrimination in the workplace would increase the number of
qualified individuals, a principle which could be applied to Michigan. While
this rationalization is sound, an economic argument shouldn't be the only
reason for the banning of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.

Christianity's g(r)ay area

n getting to know me, many
people are surprised that
I'm Christian. In an already
religiously
unaffiliated
society, LGBTQ
members,
are twice as
likely to have
no affiliation.
This trend
makes sense MICHAEL
considering SCHRAMM
73 percent of
Christians
believe homosexuality is a sin.
The argument - one that's been
passed down for generations - is
prettyeasy to understand. The Bible is
God'sword, and therefore the entirety
of its content is rules for us to follow.
Since a number of Bible verses (argu-
ably between six and 12) condemn
homosexual relations, Christianity
condemns homosexuality.
But do these verses condemn homo-
sexuality? Many hear the argument
in my last paragraph, skim through
the verses and immediately write
homosexuality off. To an extent, I can
understand why they'd reach this con-
clusion. First, they've probably always
heard that homosexuality is sinful, so
they have no reason to think other-
wise. Second, with verses like "You
shall not lie with a male as one lies
with a female; it is an abomination,"
it's easy to make quick assumptions.
Contrary to popular belief, these
verses don't concretely condemn
homosexuality. Regardless of which
verse you're reading, it's important
to note they discuss only male homo-
sexual sex. I won't bore you with each
versebutasimple Googlingof"homo-
sexuality verses" proves this point.
There is a logical explanation for only
addressing sex. During biblical times,
homosexual relations consisted pre-
dominantly of older men with boys
and men with their male slaves. These
sexual acts were often forms of rape
to show dominance, so it makes sense
why the Bible would condemn "prac-
ticed homosexuality." This explana-
tion also illuminates why these verses
address homosexual men. Only one
verse arguably addresses women's
homosexuality, yet even this verse
contains ambiguity in its reference to

lesbian acts. These acts were cultur-
ally irrelevant to women, so the Bible
didn't need to address them.
If these verses are addressing
homosexual acts of domination, this
means that the Bible never addresses
homosexual relationships. There's a
reason for this - these relationships
rarely, if ever, existed. Marriages were
dictatedby parents, and parentsbased
marriages on familial connections,
financial gain and land. Love was
frequently subordinate to benefitting
the family. Therefore, homosexual
relationships were outside cultural
norms. For example, the man's parents
were expected to provide the woman
and her parents a dowry of money
and gifts. If two men tried to marry,
this essential marriage tradition
would become muddled. Customs
like these created an expectation that
men marry women, so relationships
complicating the traditions weren't
given serious thought.
Nowadays, relationships are
different. We typically choose
long-term relationships based on
a romantic connection, and since
my previous argument assumes the
Bible doesn't condemn homosexual
relationships, the Christian
religion should have no problem
with homosexual relationships.
I wish that I could dedicate more
words to this argument because
there's so much more to discuss.
Unfortunately, I need to spend
my remaining 400 words saying
other things.
Likehowit'snotfairthatChristians
judge me for my lifestyle. I know for a
fact that part of my community looks
down on my pursuit of another young
gentleman. It stings because some of
these people are my friends, yet they
seldom make the effort to hear my
position - let alone take it seriously.
Though they won't challenge my
belief to my face, I know from enough
sources that it's a topic they've
discussed with each other. They see
megoingagainstthe church's opinion,
so they assume I'm wrong.
But the truth of the matter is, I don't
think I'm wrong, and I shouldn't feel
shame for believing I'm right. My
reasoning stems from more than my
opinion benefitting my personal life.
I've done my biblical research, and

I hold my belief because it takes the
Bible - Christianity's ultimate frame
- into consideration. Since many hold
the opposite stance because "that's
what we've always believed," I would
even argue that my opinion is more
God-rooted than theirs.
However,this doesn'tmeanthatI'm
judging your opinion if it's different
than mine. It saddens me that many
have opposite beliefs on a subject so
important to my life, but if your stance
stems from a clear and argumentative
interpretation, I'll respect your belief.
I'll even hear out what you have to say.
Likewise,though,it's only fair that you
hear my argument, and when I settle
into a relationship, it's not your place
to assume my decisions are swinful.
Like any other Christian, I'm merely
following what I believe is right.
Because - besides the biblical
arguments - I feel God directing me
on this path, andI've felt this for along
time. For too many evenings than he
can remember, mid-teenager Michael
laidhisheadonhispillow,clutchedhis
comforter in his developing palm and
prayed an assortment of prayers. The
"God, take these (gay) feelings away
from me" prayer; the "God, help me
through this" prayer; the "God, I want
a love of my life so badly, but if I'm gay,
I'm not allowed" prayer; the "God,
everyone will treat me differently
if I really am gay" prayer; the "God,
let your will be done, but please just
give me some comfort" prayer. After
reciting these prayers more times
than he can remember, mid-teenager
Michael woke up every morning to
realize that absolutely nothing had
changed. Though God doesn't give us
everything we ask for, he wasn't even
providing his fundamental promise
to ease stress in trying times. After
enough prayer sessions ending in
nothing but restless anguish, mid-
teenager Michael came to the conclu-
sion that there must be an explanation
for his God's actions. That despite an
overwhelming consensus onthe topic,
something was missing. That some-
thing was wrong. That lying under-
neath a seemingly one-sided debate
existed agray areamore complexthan
the consensus made it appear.

Michigan's Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act
was passed in 1976, prohibiting employment,
housing or public accommodation
discrimination on the basis of religion, race,
color, national origin, age, sex, height, weight,
familial status or marital status. The bill
doesn't, however, cover discrimination on
the basis of sexual orientation or expression.
Business Leaders for Michigan recently
voiced their support for the expansion of
this bill to include such sexual orientation
discrimination under the purview of the law.
Their reasoning is an economic one: with
the goal of making the state one of the top
business competitors in the country, banning
discrimination will aid in attracting qualified
job candidates and work to make all applicants
feel welcome in the Michigan workplace. A
recent Michigan Department of Civil Rights
survey discovered that a discriminatory
climate in the Michigan workplace is driving
professionals and college graduates out
of the state as well as making Michigan a
less welcoming place for non-natives, thus

hurting the Michigan economy asa whole.
While an economic argument can and
is being made for the expansion of anti-
discrimination legislation, discrimination
of any kind should not be tolerated for any
reason. The CEOs are creating a catalyst
for social change, which will greatly benefit
the state and its population, but Michigan's
citizens should take it upon themselves
to initiate this change as a matter or
moral imperative.
The state needs to step up and end
discrimination. This change needs to be
brought about by more thanjust the corporate
world aiming to increase their profits and
better their reputation in the business world.
A social component needs to be included in
this move for social change. The Business
Leaders of Michigan are supporting societal
change that must be accepted by the state
of Michigan writ large for the betterment of
our society and the acceptance of any and all
current and potential residents of the state
of Michigan.

Searching #selfie MCCARTHY
on Instagram renders
97,032,845 posts, and is
followed closely by related
hashtags such as #selfiesunday, #selfienation,
#selfiesfordays and #selfiecentral.
For $1.29, fans of the songwriting duo The
Chainsmokers can download their #14 song on
iTunes, "#SELFIE." The song tops the charts
with profound lyrical insights such as "But first,
let me take a selfie," "Can you guys help me pick
a filter? I don't know if I should go with XX Pro
or Valencia, I wanna look tan," "Whatshould my
captionbe?"and"Ionlygot10likesinthelast five
minutes, do you think I should take it down?"
I wish I were making these things up.
The HuffingtonPostrecently reported onBrit-
ain's first victim of a selfie addiction with a head-
line that reads, "Selfie Addiction Is No Laughing
Matter, Psychiatrists Say." Nineteen-year-old
Danny Bowman allegedly dropped out of school
and did not leave his house for six months in pur-
suit of capturing the perfect selfie. He apparently
dedicated about 10 hours a day taking up to 200
pictures of himself on his iPhone. Unsatisfied
with his efforts, Bowman attempted to take his
ownlife.
The article quotes psychiatrist Dr. David
Veale, whose clinic treated Bowman's addic-
tion, remarking, "Danny's case is particularly
extreme, but this is a serious problem. It's not a
vanity issue. It's a mental health one which has
an extremely high suicide rate."
It is apparent that "selfies"' sovereignty will
outlive its allotted year-long reign, as it has
warranted a chart-topping ballad and has been
allocated an entire day on Instagram in its dedi-
cation. The downside is that though amusing and
often celebrated, "selfies" are yet another soci-
etal trend that while seemingly entertaining and
inconsequential, can be taken to toxic extremes.

With the popularity of selfies and Instagram
came the subsequent invention of apps like
Skinnee Pix, which can trim anywhere from five
to 15 pounds of virtual fat off your selfies -simply
exacerbating the issue at hand. In an article
for Psychology Today, Dr. Pamela Rutledge
explains that taking selfies can be detrimental
to a person's mental health and that indulging in
them is indicative of narcissism, low self-esteem,
attention-seeking behavior and self-indulgence.
The idea that taking selfies may possibly be
responsible for a variety of troubling mental
health issues will likely not be met with
acceptance by a society enthralled by technology
and personal gadgets. Rutledge mentions that
some experts and physicians even feel that
society is collectively engaged in deep denial
about how dangerous it is to interact with screens
without settinglimits on how much time is spent
doingson- and I would not disagree.
Her concession to "put aside your anxieties
over rampant narcissism and the moral
decline of the digital generation and exhale
... like every trend, the behavior will recede
when the excitement and newness wears off,"
however, I take issue with.
Selfies are just the most recent installment
of technological trends, and when its "excite-
ment and newness wears off" another social
media craze or application is bound to take its
place. Though media fads are nothing new to
American society, the intense vulnerability
and insecurity that social networking and
personal technologies induce is both alarm-
ing and troubling. Are we setting the stage
for coming generations to be hypersensitive
to and misunderstanding of communica-
tion, self-representation, self-indulgence and
their appearance?
Our generation inherited these
technologies in our teens, but how will it
affect the 5 and 6-year-old children who
already know how to take selfies on their
parents' Macbooks, iPads and iPhones? Will
we raise children who are permanently
fixated on themselves, seeking self-validation
through 'likes' rather than intellect or wit,
capturing "the moment" by recording simply
their own appearance and perpetually living
out of touch with their surroundings?

RIMA FADLALLAH f
T
In conversations surrounding
liberation or "social justice," we talk
a lot about feelings of guilt on the
part of those with privilege. I would
argue that we talk far too much about
these feelings, so much that we (and
I say we because I, too, am guilty of
being expressively guilty) silence
others in the process. What's worse is
that we silence those whose (already
marginalized) voices we should have
been listeningto all along.
Guilt is an extremely passive
emotion - perhaps the most passive of
them all. I would know - when I feel
guilty, I'm usually in this lazy limbo
phase where I'm very emotionally
invested in my role as an activist,
but I'm not quite righteous enough
to feel resentment and I'm not quite
courageous enough to truly own up to
my silencing behavior. So I feel guilt.
Which is cool, because guilt is an
emotion and I believe that honoring
our raw emotions before we are able
to unpack them is necessary and
beneficial to our well being and our
personal growth.
It's how we express our guilt that is
important.
Not all emotions need to be
unpacked - sometimes I just don't
have, need or even want the language
to describe what is going on in the
depths of my soul. Similar to the way
blood only turns red when exposed
to oxygen, trying to put a name on
my emotions can strip them of their
true colors. So I keep them inside
and let them do what I believe they
will naturally do for me - so long as I
remain cognizant of the connection
between my mind, body and soul in
the process.
I am currently in the process of
learning what to do with my guilt, and
I figured I would share my insights
with all of my fellow guilty people
who also want to be more socially
responsible:
1. Recognize that guilt in itself is
a privilege. The fact that I feel guilty
rightsnow means that Iam complacent
in a dynamic whereby I am (directly
or indirectly) the oppressor. I'll say it
again so it sinks in: in certain circles,
my very existence (as a straight, upper
class, American, able-bodied, cis-
gendered, college educated person) is
oppressive. Guilt is aprivilege.
2. Sometimes, expressing things
is overrated - some things I should
just keep to myself. Let me tell you, I
never thought I would ever say that,
and those closest to me are probably

power of language as transformative,

just it; in truly coming to understand
the jarring effects of language, I've
learned that some things are just
better left unsaid, especially when my
motivationsforexpressionarebecause
I'd feel more credible or welcomed in
certain spaces. Expression of guilt is
self-serving.
Here are a few examples for us
both to follow: If I feel guilty that
my parents are rich, that's not really
something I need to bring up in a
circle of friends who come from a
low socio-economic background. If
you feel guilty that your conservative
Christian parents would hate me
because Iam Muslim, that's not really
something I need to hear. What are
these statements accomplishing?
Nothing productive. Some things we
should just keep to ourselves, let our
feelings fester inside until we come
up with our own answers instead of
seeking answers from people whom
we will hurt and silence with our
inquiry and confession - expression of
guilt is insensitive.
3. My guilt should be a sign that I
am not an expert in the space where
I feel guilty. Building from my last
point, I am learning that the spaces
where I feel most guilty should also
be the spaces where I speak the least
and listen the most. My guilt in itself is
an indicator that my narrative may be
one that dominates and marginalizes
voices that cannot be heard until I
shut up. While my guilt may urge me
to speak up to "compensate" for being
privileged, I should actually just keep
quiet and stop trying to center myself
because this conversation isn't about
me, not everything is about me. Guilt
is selfish,guilt is self-centered.
4. If I am still guilty, that's fine.
ButIneed to seriously reflect on howI
envision my role as an activist. This one
is a tough one, mostly because I am
still thinking and working through
it. I believe that my guilt means
that I am still trying to reconcile
my role in a given movement. I am
uncomfortable with the role I am
currently playing, so I rely on guilt
to make me feel better. As a self-
proclaimed "activist," I am learning
that guilt has the power to stymie
growth and nurture complacency by
making me feel that my feelings of
guilt alone are productive. Guilt alone
is not productive.
Icouplethislessonwithtoolkititem

#2: I'm learning that if my activism is
in the form of a Facebook status, a
Michigan in Color article or any other
form of public expression, it should be
reflective, respectful and responsible
for it to be productive. Guilt without
self-reflection, honesty and respect
cannot be productive. "Guilt as
productive" and "guilt as passive"
are mutually exclusive statements,
therefore guilt is fallacious, guilt is
deceiving.
5. My guilt does not make me an
exception. I've learned that constantly
criticizing those who are racist,
homophobic, classist, ageist, etc. does
not magically dismiss me from being
those very same things. Guilt is a cop-
out. IfIam notdirectlyoppressedbya
system - whether it be anti-Blackness,
heteronormativity, even American
exceptionalism - I am complacent
in those very systems of oppression.
This does not mean that I cannot play
a role in helping deconstruct them; it
just means that my role needs to start
within myself before I should even
think about how to criticize others,
about how to operate in that space.
Guilt is lazy, guilt is passive.
All that said, I can speak from
personal experience when I say that
consciously reflecting on all of these
things is no easy task. In fact, it is
exhausting, emotionally draining
and extremely confusing. Still, it is
absolutely necessary - especially on
a campus so hostile to minorities, the
LGBTQ community, those who come
fromlow-SESbackgrounds and people
with other targeted identities. I truly
believe our world would be a better,
less hurtful place if people stopped
focusing on the discomfort that
often comes along with recognizing
their privilege, because feeling
uncomfortable is a hell of a lot better
than having to bear oppressive blows
dayafterdaylike manyofmypeersdo.
When I contextualize my discomfort
that way, I realize how petty and
self-centered my complaints are. We
would all be more responsible if we let
those feelings of discomfort and guilt
marinate for a bit, if we truly reflected
on why we feel uncomfortable to
begin with.
As Wolverines, before we can
"expect respect," we must hold
ourselves to the same standards of
respect (for self and others) to which
we feel so entitled.

event spotlight: music matters presentscz,
bAlicia Adamczyk, Weekend Roundup Editor

at do a Shark Tank-
style business com-
petition, live music
performances from internation-
ally-acclaimed artists and TED
Talks all have in common? Uni-
versity students will get to expe-
rience all of them and much more
during Thursday's third annual
SpringFest, #IGNITE.UM.
The capstone event of MUSIC
Matters, a student organization
built to combine the power of
music and student activism to
make the world a better place,
SpringFest is a SXSW-style fes-
tival across Central Campus
designed to promote creativity
and bring students from all cor-
ners of campus together.
At the end of the day, rap art-
ist 2 Chainz will perform at the
annual benefit concert in Hill
Auditorium. Proceeds from this
year's ticket sales will be used to
create a summer camp at the Uni-
versity for underprivileged chil-
dren in grades 6-8.
This year, a "completely
revamped" SpringFest has
expanded to incorporate more
schools, colleges and student
organizations than ever before.
Business junior Nick Moeller,
SpringFest chair, said 40 student
organizations have signed on to
participate throughout the day.
In addition to the business
competition, sponsored by
MPowered, and live music per-
formances, there will also be a
photo exhibit presented by the
Black Student Union, a Start-Up
Village, demonstrations from the
Solar Car team and food trucks
and other vendors.
"Everybody sort of sticks to
their own thing during the year,"
Moeller said. "Come end of the

year, there's not really anything
that brings people together. So
we wanted to create something
that brings people from all back-
grounds together in a collabora-
tive event."
Spanning from the steps of the
Hatcher Graduate Library across
to Ingalls Mall, all of the student
organizations are designated
one of five sections: Innovation,
Art, Sustainability, Identity
and Social Justice. Moeller and
the rest of the MUSIC Matters
executive committee said they
believe these subject areas best
encapsulate the spirit of Univer-
sity students.
While in past years the event
has garnered attention as a sort
of replica of Festifall, the group's
goal this year is to drive enough
traffic and excitement around
the event that in future years
SpringFest will be able to facili-
tate collaborations between orga-
nizations that otherwise wouldn't
happen and not just entice stu-
dents to join another organization
or two, LSA senior Phil Schermer,
founder and president of MUSIC
Matters, said.
"Here is an opportunity to
bridge gaps between the colleg-
es," Schermer said. "The purpose
is broader than just a fun concert;
there's a much bigger idea here."
North University Avenue will
house the live music stages, cor-
porate sponsors and various food
trucks. Folk-rock band Grizfolk,
which recently finished a tour
opening for Bastille, will headline
the live performances. other per-
formers include Ann Arbor native
Dan Henig, best known for his
YouTube-famous acoustic cover
of Lil Jon's "Get Low," and LSA
sophomore Sylvia Yacoub, a top-

10 finalist on NBC's "The Voice."
Given the breadth of organiza-
tions, sponsors and events, stu-
dents will be hard-pressed to fit
in all of SpringFest's activities.
Information sophomore Made-
leine Chone, a member of MUSIC
Matters' talent and concert team,
said it is this diversity of groups
and ventures that makes Spring-
Fest such a unique and can't-miss
campus experience.
"It's difficult to explain to
someone in a sentence," Chone
said. "It's exactly that that makes
it so great. You can't sit down and
explain it in a sentence, it takes
five minutes."
And while connecting stu-
dents, creating a legendary
campus event and encouraging
creativity in thought and social
activism are of the utmost impor-
tance for the organizers, theyalso
admitted there are a few other
exciting aspects about the day,
particularly the headlining musi-
cal guest.
"My selfie with 2 Chainz at the
end of the night, I'm pretty excit-
ed about that," LSA sophomore
Claire Ulak, communications
senior producer for the organiza-
tion, joked.
Business sophomore Jibran
Ahmed, the fundraising senior
producer, added, "If 2 Chainz
spits a new bar, I'm going to be
pretty happy."
Last year, MUSIC Matters
gave a $50,000 gift to endow
the MUSIC Matters Big Think-
ers Scholarship - the completely
student-funded scholarship is the
first of its kind at the University
- and in 2012 the organization
donated $10,000 to C.S. Mott
Children's Hospital.

This weekend students will
gather on Palmer Field from
10 a.m. Saturday to 10 a.m. on
Sunday to participate in MRe-
lay's 12th Relay for Life walk,
the American Cancer Society's
largest international fundrais-
er to fight against cancer. This
year's MRelay theme is Disney.
Kinesiology senior Sara
Knysh, executive director of
the University's chapter of
Relay for Life, said in prior
years, MRelay's fundraiser has
had between 3,000 to 5,000
students watching and partici-
pating and draws in the second
largest student crowd behind
football games. Many stu-
dents form fundraising teams
through Greek Life or other
organizations.
The University's Relay for
Life event has been ranked the
second largest collegiate relay
in the nation for the past two
years. Last year the event raised
about $312,000 and hopes to
raise over $315,000 this year.
The 24-hour event will
begin with a survivor lap where
cancer survivors and their fam-
ilies and friends will take the
first lap around the track.
Throughout the day, stu-
dents will participate in field
games and a basketball tourna-
ment.
The event will also feature
a Fight Back ceremony, which
promotes the American Cancer
Society's "Celebrate. Remem-
ber. Fight back." initiative.

During the ceremony, MRelay
will attempt to break the world
record for the most candles
blown out at once.
"The Fight Back ceremony
is mostly to get everyone excit-
ed and thank everyone for all
their hard work and keep push-
ing forward with the fight,"
Knysh said. "We thought it
would be an extremely mov-
ing moment. This is Michigan,
so why not set another world
record?"
Later in the evening, the
event will hold the Luminaria
ceremony to honor survivors
and remember those who
lost their fight with cancer.
Throughout the event people
will share stories about their
experiences with cancer and
their reasons for participating
in the relay.
"It's an extremely moving
event," Knysh said. "I'm look-
ing forward to honoring my
family and remembering those
that we've all lost and inspire
everyone to keep fighting."
There will also be a glow-
concert with student group per-
formances including Groove.
In addition to the Relay for
Life walk, MRelay holds fund-
raisers throughout the year to
lead up to the event in April. In
addition to restaurant and bar
nights, MRelay has held a year-
ly benefit concert and a Rent the
Runway fashion show to raise
money.
"We want to provide an
atmosphere that people will
want to come to and excited to
stay at," Knysh said.

Administration investi
'Cuban Twitter' progr

Hearings focus on
whether USAID can
launch intelligence
operations
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Obama administration is look-
ing into whether a "Cuban Twit-
ter" program secretly backed by
the U.S. government contained
messages that were political
in nature, despite assertions
from the administration that
the effort was intended only to
increase the flow of informa-
tion in a country that heavily
restricts Internet access.
State Department spokes-
woman Jen Psaki said Wednes-
day it would be "troubling" if
political messages were sent
under the program. She said
the program's sponsor, the U.S.
Agency for International Devel-
opment, was tryingto determine
whether any ofthe messages that
were sent were in fact political,
as well as the timing of the mes-
sages, and whether they were
drafts or were actually sent.
An Associated Press inves-
tigation has revealed that the
U.S. government built the
now-defunct communications
network to undermine the com-
munist government and that
draft messages were produced
that were overtly political.
Documents obtained by the
AP show that the early messages
poked fun at the Castro gov-
ernment and were created by a
political satirist working for the
social media project. Those mes-
sages conflict with the U.S. gov-
ernment's earlier assertions that
its program didn't promulgate
political content.
Cuba's state-run telecommu-
nications firm said Wednesday
it had launched an investigation
into how hundreds of thousands
of customer cellphone numbers
ended up in the USAID pro-
gram. The AP's investigation
found that those phone numbers
were used to start a subscriber
base for the project, ultimately
known as ZunZuneo, for the
sound made by a Cuban hum-
mingbird.
Congressional hearings into

the creation of the program this
week focused on whether it was
appropriate for USAID to launch
such an intelligence-like opera-
tion - and not the CIA or other
spy agencies.
The AP investigation showed
program evaded Cuba's digital
restrictions by creating a text-
messaging service that could
be used to organize political
demonstrations. It drew tens of
thousands of subscribers who
were unaware it was backed
by Washington, which went
to great lengths to conceal its
involvement.
Cuban-born Rep. Ileana Ros-
Lehtinen, R-Fla., on Wednes-
day sharply defended U.S.-run
democracy programs in Cuba,
saying it was "so important to
offer the other side of the story,
the side that promotes American
values: God-given values like
freedom, justice or liberty."
She added: "This issue we're
debating ... is whether or not
USAID should be taking steps
to promote human rights, the
rule of law and democratic gov-
ernance throughout the world. I
say yes."
Other lawmakers were
uncomfortable with the notion
that an agency best known for
its humanitarian mission was
undertaking operations best left
to the professionals.
The chairman of the Sen-
ate panel that approves spend-
ing on such foreign programs,
Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said
a day earlier he was never told
about the Twitter-like opera-
tion, disputing assertions by
USAID Administrator Rajiv
Shah that Congress was proper-
ly informed. The Obama admin-
istration has said the program
operated "discreetly" but wasn't
covert.
Leahy, head of the Senate
appropriations subcommit-
tee for foreign operations, said
USAID employees working
openly on aid programs have
complained that the agency's
secretive programs were put-
ting their lives at risk.
In defending the program,
the Obama administration and
critics of the Castro government
have pointed to federal audits

was taken into custody and
treated for a minor hand wound,
then was brought into court in
shackles and a hospital gown
and charged with four counts
of attempted homicide and 21
counts of aggravated assault.
He was jailed without bail, and
authorities said he would be
prosecuted as an adult.
His attorney did not
immediately respond to a
message for comment.
The attack unfolded in the
morning just minutes before the
start of classes at 1,200-student
Franklin Regional High School,
in an upper-middle-class area
15 miles east of Pittsburgh. It
was over in about five minutes,
during which the boy ran wildly
down about 200 feet of hallway,
slashing away with knives about
8 to 10 inches long, police said.
Nate Moore, 15, said he
saw the boy tackle and stab a
freshman. He said he going to
try to break it up when the boy
got up and slashed his face,
opening a wound that required
11 stitches.
"It was really fast. It felt
like he hit me with a wet rag
because I felt the blood splash
on my face. It spurted up on my
forehead," he said.
The attacker "had the same
expression on his face that he

has every day, which was the
freakiest part," Moore said.
"He wasn't saying anything.
He didn't have any anger on
his face. It was just a blank
expression."
Assistant Principal Sam
King finally tackled the boy
and disarmed him, and a
Murrysville police officer who
is regularly assigned to the
school handcuffed him, police
said.
King's son told The
Associated Press that his father
was treated at a hospital, though
authorities have said he did not
suffer any knife wounds.
"He says he's OK. He's a
tough cookie and sometimes
hides things, but I believe he's
OK," Zack King said. He added:
"I'm proud of him."
In addition to the 22 who
were stabbed or slashed, two
people suffered other injuries
during the melee, authorities
said. The security guard, who
was wounded after intervening
early in the melee, was treated
and released.
"There are a number of
heroes in this day. Many of them
are students," Gov. Tom Corbett
said in a visit to the stricken
town. "Students who stayed
with their friends and didn't
leave their friends."

Operation involved
skydiving, three
federal agencies, a
plane and a frigate
SAN DIEGO (AP) - Six days
after a family of four found
themselves helpless and adrift
in a sailboat far into the Pacific
with a vomiting, feverish 1-year-
old, a Navy warship delivered
them safely Wednesday to San
Diego, where they began their
attempted around-the world
voyage before the child was born.
The Rebel Heart, the 36-foot
sailboat that had been their,
home for seven years, is at the
bottom of the ocean 900 miles
off Mexico, sunk by rescuers
because it was taking on water
after losing its steering and most
of its communications.
A satellite phone ping from
the boat Thursday set off a
huge rescue effort that involved
skydiving National Guardsmen,
three federal agencies, a plane, a
frigate and scores of personnel.
It also sparked a serious debate
over parenting, and the propriety
of hitting the high seas with two
young children.
The Navy warship, the USS
Vandegrift, docked at Naval Air
Station North Island with the
Kaufman family safely aboard
and the child recovering from her
illness, Navy spokeswoman Lt.
Lenaya Rotklein said.
In a photo released by the
Navy, the family looked like
typical vacationers, with father
Eric dressed in shorts and a
baseball cap while lugging bags,
and his wife Charlotte walking
behind him, holding the toddler
in a strap-on carrier and grasping
the hand of her 3-year-old

daughter.
The ship was scheduled to
move from the island to the San
Diego mainland later in the day
without the Kaufmans, who first
want to tend to their 1-year-old
daughter, Lyra, and get some rest
before talking publicly, Charlotte
Kaufman's sister, Sariah English,
said.
The Kaufmans' decision to sail
around the world with Lyra and
her sister Cora drew accusations
of reckless foolishness from some
observers and praise from others
for their courageous spirit.
"They'll probably go on the
'Today' show to talk about this,
and write a book about it, do a
miniseries and get 15 minutes
of fame because that's how our
country tends to reward people
who choose recklessly to put
themselves and their children in
danger," said Margaret Dilloway,
a San Diego novelist who has
three children.
English doesn't question the
decision of her sister's family. She
said sailing is their passion. It's
what defines them.
"Charlotte and Eric raise
their children how they see fit,"
English said. "They are very
concerned about child safety.
That's their No. 1 concern, and
they did not do this blindly. They
are responsible, good parents."
Eric Kaufman, a Coast Guard-
licensed captain, and his wife
sent a statement from the ship
defending their actions, saying
"when we departed on this
journey more than a year ago,
we were then and remain today
confident that we prepared as
well as any sailingcrew could."
Others said children benefit
in many intangible ways from
parents who show them the
world, even when they're too
young to remember it.

By BRAD WHIPPLE
Daily Sports Writer
It was the 68th minute in
the Elite Eight when Virginia
delivered the winning strike
against the Michigan women's
soccer team.
It was the goal that ended
the Wolverines' run in the
2013 NCAA Tournament, and
it was also the goal that ended
the collegiate career of seven
seniors, all of whom gave their
team a force to rally behind.
Though the questions
remained as to how Michigan
would contend next season
without players like forward
Nkem Ezurike, the Wolverines'
recent spring season success
showed glimpses of a new
identity that is forming without
their seniors.

which could be dedicated to
skill training. Now, the team
meets four to five times a week
for full practices.
Ryan has even tried to bring
the senior class back to help the
younger athletes, but he ran
into an issue in January. When
the seven seniors declared for
the National Women's Soccer
League Draft, they were labeled
as professional players, even if
they didn't get selected.
Per NCAA guidelines,
'professional players' are
restricted to stopping by a
team's practices once per
month.
But even if the seniors can't
be there as much as they'd
like, the Wolverines still found
spring success in their absence.
And Michigan isn't even at full
capacity, with nine freshmen
who have yet to arrive on
campus.
"I'm just excited that we have

But the next day, Hasselbach
put those doubts to rest when
she jacked three home runs for
eight RBI. Since entering the
starting lineup March 15, her
batting average is .484.
"I can tell you one thing
that we have in this program

"We have a culture of success,
we have a culture of working
hard, we have a culture of kids
coming in early to hit. That's
championship culture, and it
means you work harder than

through the hard times."

a lot on her
mind," Hutchins said. "She
doesn't look comfortable, kids
go through that, she'll get it
back. Sometimes you just kind
of have to let it run its course -
it's like the flu."
The former walk-on has
batted at least .350 since her
sophomore year and is known as
a clutch hitter by her coaches.
"That's something that
happens," Blanchard said. "If
you, as a baseball or softball
player, know that you are in a
slump, and you use the word
'slump,' it starts to affect how
you do long term."
But Michigan has dealt with
cold hitters plenty of times this
season already and it hasn't
slowed the team down a bit.
Blanchard will do everything
she can to get her plate presence
and her swing back even though
recent history suggests the
Wolverines will keep winning
regardless.
To be a championship-
caliber squad in a streaky
sport like softball, the team
has to transcend the player.
Michigan has met that goal
with a combination of talent and
winning culture established
by hardworking veterans like
Blanchard and Hasselbach.
Even the elder statesmen on
the team can't avoid the slumps,
though. They'll say things about
being prepared mentally, echo
their coach's 'one-pitch' softball
mantra and talk about doing
their part for the team, but what
they really mean is that slumps
don't last forever.
So freshman or senior, they'll
keep swinging, pitching and
attacking the opponent.

Irish win rematch over'M'

PAUL SHERMAN/Daily
Michigan coach John Beilein has advised his players to carefully consider whether they're ready for the lump to the NBA.
Beilein mentors prospects

By BEN FIDELMAN
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan baseball
team concluded a nine-game
homestand Wednesday night
with one of its worst losses of
the season,
falling, 9-1, MICHIGAN 1
to Notre NOTRE DAME 9
Dame.
The cause of the Irish
beatdown wasn't exactly an
extreme offensive outpouring
- the Wolverines committed
a season-high six errors, and
constantly failed to field simple
things like sacrifice bunts.
The Wolverines (4-5 Big
Ten, 14-18-1 overall) sent fifth-
year senior right-hander Ben
Ballantine to the mound, though
he has been their mainstay in the
Friday night starter slot for much
of the year. But he has struggled
recently, and Wednesday gave
him an opportunity to right the
ship on his final collegiate season
- something he failed to do.
Thetoneofthegamewas clear
early. Notre Dame (1-12 ACC,
11-20) got through to Ballantine
with hits in each of the first
three innings. The Fighting Irish
blooped back-to-back singles to
right field to begin the top of the
second. ABallantine erroronthe
ensuing sacrifice bunt loaded
the bases, but Notre Dame could
only manage to get one run in,
as it hit into a double play and
grounded out to second base to
end the inning.
The Fighting Irish got back to
it again in the third. The inning
took some time to start rolling,
but a double followed by two
walks loaded the bases with
two outs with Notre Dame left-
fielder Zak Kutsulis coming up.
The sophomore doubled to right
field, putting the Fighting Irish
up 4-0 and knocking Ballantine
out of the game after just 2.2
innings.
"There aren't a whole lot of
positives to take out of tonight,"
said senior catcher Cole Martin.
"There is still a heck of a lot of

baseball left for us."
Michigan was able to bring a
run across inthe fourth inningon
a groundout, but any momentum
was quickly squashed in the top
of the fifth inning.
AftertwoFightingIrishhitters
reached base, the Wolverines
had trouble again executing on
a Notre Dame sacrifice bunt.
This time, a throwing error from
sophomore third baseman Jacob
Cronenworth bounced into first
base, and Michigan conceded a
run after not taking advantage of
the free out.
When the ball dribbled
away at first base, the Fighting
Irish base runner didn't break
stride, powering around third
base and heading for the plate.
Michigan junior first baseman
Kyle Jusick's throw beat the
runner to the plate, but the ball
was dislodged from the catcher's
glove in the process of tagging
the runner.
By the fifth inning, the
Wolverines were down 6-1 and
had committed five errors.
Junior right-hander Donnie
Eaton came in for relief in
the third inning and went 3.1

innings, allowing two runs -
both unearned.
Michigan showed some signs
of life in the sixth and seventh,
but failed to plate one of the five
combined runners who reached.
In the end, the Wolverines
were limited to just four hits.
"Wehit alotofrockets and had
a lot of quality at-bats," Martin
said. "We couldn't put together
three or four or five of them in a
row to get the runs across."
A leadoff single followed by
a double scored a run for the
Notre Dame to make it 7-1 in the
seventh, and then things got ugly
for Michigan.
Freshman left fielder Carmen
Benedetti was on the move
tracking down a would-be
inning-ending fly ball in the
corner, and he flat-out dropped
it. It was the Wolverines' sixth
error of the game, and one that
stretched the lead to 8-1.
As if that weren't enough, the
following ball came right back
to left field, where Benedetti
attempted a diving catch and
missed.
That brought in the game's
final run, makingit 9-1.

confirmed that sophomores

the NBA Draft.
"We have notgotten anything
back yet," Beilein said, "but we
have talked to them all."
Though asking for an
evaluation can assistin a player's
decision

"You hope during the course
of their education that they're
looking at things from a much
broader perspective than
some guy that's in his cellar
projecting the NBA Draft and
still living with his mother," he
said. "There's nothing wrong
with still living with your
mother."
Beilein said other players
also applied for an evaluation
but refused to answer whom.
Specifically, he declined
comment on whether
sophomore guard Caris LeVert
would.
"'I've always dreamt of
going to the NBA,' " Beilein
said, regarding the mindset of
enteringthe draft. "That is not
a reason to go to the NBA. The
reason to go to the NBA is, 'I am
ready to go to the NBA.'
"That's an important thing.
We have to continue to cultivate

Beilein, this time of the year is
the toughest.
"When you work as hard as
we all work all year long and
all of sudden the going-home-

for me," he said. "Thank God

So what is Beilein doing with
the summer approaching? For
one, he's fixing lightbulbs in his
house.
"I (changed two) this
morning," he said. "They had
been out for a while."
Though it's likely some more
exciting things will come his
way, Beilein is ready for the
dead period of May which he'll
spend with his family.
"We'll try to stay at home, cut
the lawn and hang around," he
said.
NOTES: Beilein confirmed
Wednesday that McGary
had a 20-minute workout on
Tuesday and that the forward is
progressing toward individual
workouts, potentially for NBA
teams if he ultimately declares.
After seeing Stauskas
and LeVert show so much
improvement in their strength
and physique this season due
to their decisions to stay in
Ann Arbor last summer with
strength and conditioning coach
Jon Sanderson, Beilein said
there has been a "major push"
for athletes to stay in town.
"I expect many of our guys to
be here, but I don't have all the
numbers," he said.

The Michigan men's
gymnastics team seeks to
accomplish what no Michigan
team has done since 1959 -
win back-to-back national
championships.
The Wolverines (17-0 Big
Ten, 25-0 overall) will look to
cap their perfect season with
a storybook ending in front of
their home fans at the Crisler
Center this weekend. The
National Championship will
consist of 12 teams competing
over three days. Qualifying
rounds start Thursday, with
six teams moving on to Friday's
team finals. The individual finals
will take place on Saturday.
"We're just excited to be able
to hopefully defend our national
title at home," said graduate
student captain Syque Caesar.
"We set our goals right from the
very beginning of the season
to defend our national title and
winning it at home."
Though it sports an
unblemished record, Michigan
has had many challenges
thrown its way on the march
to perfection and a possible
national chamnionship.

Before the season even began,
junior Michael Strathern was
redshirted because of a foot
injury, and sophomore Konner
Ackerman suffered an elbow
injury that sidelined him for a
good portion of the year.
Additionally, two of the
Wolverines' top gymnasts
suffered major injuries during
the season. Junior Adrian de
los Angeles, one of the top all-
around gymnasts in the country,
tore his anterior cruciate
ligament during the Winter Cup
in February, and junior Stacey
Ervin tore his bicep during the
Big Ten Championship last week
"It's not been easy," Caesar
said. "It hasn't been just handed
to us. But that just shows how
deep of a team we are. Even
with all these injuries and set-
backs and adversity, we are still
able to push ourselves and be
the top contenders for Nationals
and Big Tens."
Despite their injuries, Ervin
and de los Angeles will still
look to contribute to the team.
Ervin plans to compete on floor
exercise and possiblyon highbar

this weekend - events that
won't require extensive use of
his torn knee.
Regardless of who will be
competing, Michigan will
face its stiffest competition
of the year. The Wolverines'
main challengers will be No. 1
Oklahoma, No. 3 Ohio State and
No. 4 Stanford. The Wolverines
beat Ohio State and Stanford
during the regular season.
"Oklahoma and Ohio State
are about equal and hopefully
we're a little notch above that,"
said Michigan coach Kurt
Golder. "But that little notch
can go away so quickly with
this format, five guys up at
each event and five guys scores
count. If you make a mistake,
you can plummet very quickly."
The Wolverines are familiar
with the "five up, five count"
format and subsequent
pressure after employing it in
almost every meet this season.
Additionally, Golder has an
veteran roster that has big-event
experience - both collegiately
and internationally. One of
the most experienced, senior
Sam Mikulak, will also have
the chance to become the most
decorated collegiate gymnast in
history this weekend.
After earning 13 All-
American honors and five NCAA
individual championships in
his first three years of college,
Mikulak needs only three more
individual championships and
four All-American distinctions
to become the all-time record
holder in both categories.
"Friday is the number one day
that we have been training for,
for this entire year," Mikulak
said. "It comes down to this
moment of how prepared are
we to come out as champions.
... Individually, I definitely
have aspirations there, but the
big focus is all on the team and
making history by repeating
national titles."
Through all the adversity
and obstacles that Michigan
has faced this year, one constant
always remained the same - the
goal of repeating as National
Champions. That is something
within its grasp this weekend.

Detroit composer
talks beginnings

About that Kimye
Vogue cover

'U' alum Alton
James founded
JIV Media
By JACKSON HOWARD
Daily Music Editor
It's no secret that Detroit gets
a bad rap, and it's probably one of
the last places you'd expect any
musician to set up shop. But for
University alum Alton James,
Detroit is not only his hometown,
but also the place that he hopes to
contribute most to.
"All these Michigan companies
are going to New York and Los
Angeles and outsourcing their
work to other locations," said
James, a composer and sound
designer. "But it's like, you've
got this group, this really, really
diverse group around Metro
Detroit that can provide all types
of music because youhave all types
of cultures around here."
This was James's thinking
when he founded JIV Media, a
Detroit-based company providing
music for advertising, television
and film. James believes that
Detroit has as much artistic
potential as any other major city
and is just as focused on working
with Michigan filmmakers,
musicians and artists as he is with
productions in Hollywood.
Though he's found his calling in

composing, his musical path has
been far from straight. His parents
were both singers in choirs, and
at age 12, James started playing
organ in churches across Detroit.
But it was the experience working
with choirsthat really made James
realize his love for composing.
"(Workingwithchoirs), Igotmy
first taste of writing and hearing
what I wrote performed back
was really profound for me as a
composer," James said.
Like most kids growing
up, James watched plenty of
blockbuster movies and discovered
John Williams and James Horner,
two of the foremost composers in
filmtoday. Betweenhisexperience
in church and the influence of
composers like Williams and
Horner, James's passion for
composingwas firmly planted.
While at the University, James
minored in music, with a major
in English and another minor in
African-American Studies. Still,
he says, music is a language itself;
his English education gave him
insight in working with scripts
and writers and also influenced
the way he composes music.
Clearly, however, music was his
main priority. Having saved all of
his music requirements for senior
year, he was able to dedicate his
total attention to it for two full
semesters. Music students can
probably relate to many of James's
memories of hiding in the music

school past the midnight closing
time until the early hours of the
morning, or playingvarious shows
on campus for student groups and
Greek life events.
Launching JIV Media and
jump into composing after
graduation wasn't the immediate
plan, though. After leaving the
UniversityJamesmet anexecutive
from Noble Music, a company
focused on providing music for
advertisements that counts Coca-
Cola, Gatorade, HBO and Verizon
among clients. The executive liked
his work and asked if James would
compose for ads, to which James
replied with a quick, "sure, I put
musictoeverything."Thoughhehad
never composed for advertisements
before, the opportunity gave James
his first commercial work, and he
hasn'tlookedbacksince.
It's the combination of all these
experiences - writing ad jingles,
sleeping in music school practice
rooms, composing for feature films,
playing organ in Detroit churches
- that really gives James his true
identity as an innovative, curious
and ever-growing artist. More
than anything, as James continues
to grow, Detroit will grow with
him, a testament to his admirable
decisiontobuck the trend and stick
by the wounded city that raised
him, working from the ground up
to remind the countrythat Detroit
is still humming, grooving and
open for business.

Dissecting the sartorial choices
in ABC's sensational 'Scandal'

By CHLOE GILKE wears
Daily Arts Writer a quee

Spoiler Alert: This article con-
tains a major spoiler from the cur-
rentseason of"Scandal."
I came forthe love story, Istayed
for the trench coats.
ABC's "Scandal" has defied rat-
ings gravity and climbed to the top
of the pop culture ladder, hook-
ing viewers with the prospect of a
soap-opera-style torrid love affair
between the President of the Unit-
ed States and the White House's
resident fixer. But despite the ups
and downs of political conspiracy,
election rigging and the occasional
licking to intimidate someone, the
real draw of "Scandal" is its flaw-
less eye for fashion.
Olivia Pope, played by the gor-
geous and talented Kerry Wash-
ington, somehow manages to hold
her own in the beautiful array
of elegant designer outfits she
parades around the White House.
Her classic style is anything but
simple - her tops are structured
and feature unique draping and
interesting shapes to offset the
understated whites and greys of
her wardrobe. And though KW
is pregnant, Olivia is still rocking
those emblematic white trench
coats and heels (shot only fromthe
neck up, of course).
Even more minor characters
have their characteristic style.

SHEI
From Page 1B
Invariably, once every
semester or so, a series of high-
quality pictures of my more well
dressed acquaintances lands on
the front page of my Facebook
feed. They're at one of those
parties I hear about but never
get invited to, the kind with
a professional photographer
taking pictures at the front door.
The backdrop of these pictures is
always the same - the ubiquitous
white, logo-emblazoned curtain,
present at every award show and
film premiere - but, unlike all
the others, this curtain only has
one name: SHEI Magazine.
These pictures are, as it turns
out, from SHEI's semiannual
launch parties, celebrating
the publication of its print
magazine at the end of each
semester. I am also not the first
person to be impressed by the
professionalism of the events
and the magazine behind them,
as one of SHEI's two fashion
editors, Art& Design senior Tara
Ellis, pointed out.
"The second I tell people that
it's all student-run, they're like
'What?,'"she said.
Their incredulity is
understandable.
SHEI Magazine is, for
all intents and purposes, a
professional fashion magazine -
85 pages of high-quality, glossy
pages featuring seven different
photo shoots and upwards of
15 articles tied around a single
theme unique to each issue. It's
the product of three-and-a-half
months of work, done by a staff
of around 150 writers, designers,
photographers, models and
managers.
Unlike a professional fashion
magazine, however, SHEI's
employees aren't working a nine
to five job. They're putting in
those hoursafter going to classes,
clubs, sports and meetings.
"It's all students," said LSA
junior Anna Fuller, SHEI's
brandingdirector."Theonething
that I usually say about SHEI is
that it's run completely by the
students. The photographers,
the models, the writers, the
directors, everything is students.
Everyone but the printers.'
That's something that we really
pride ourselves on - that it's all
student-run."
The Inner Workings
of SHEI

four teams working under the
creative director.
"The creative director
oversees the photo teams,
the fashion team, the literary
features team and the design
team," Corrigan said. "Each of
those teams then has one or two
editors who organize the work
they do, and the teams range
anywhere from 10 members to, I
think we have around 60 on the
fashion team."
Needless to say, this is
a complex operation. A
complicated organization made
all the more convoluted by the
fact that SHEI doesn't have a
central office.
"We currently have a room
upstairs in the Union, but it's
more of a storage space than
a place that we meet to do
things," Corrigan said "We have
that room and then we have
a standing reservation in the
undergraduate library for our
board meetings."
As SHEI's editors are quick
to point out, the lack of a
central meeting space requires
a great deal of flexibility and
communication to keep things
running smoothly and to builda
sense of community among the
staff.
"We're pretty good at
(working around that problem),"
said LSA senior Tanika
Raychaudhuri, one of SHEI's
literary feature editors. "I guess
one thing is that we have a lot of
small communities within SHEI.
For example, the lit team, we
have our meetings in a certain
location and we've always had
them there and everyone goes.
We do bonding activities as a
team and bonding activities as a
board."
But, unsurprisingly, the
amount of work necessary to
keep the magazine's production
on schedule while putting
together runway shows and
maintaining relationships with
retailers in the community is
daunting.
"We spend 20 to 30 hours a
week working on SHEI-related
activities by the time you
coordinate models, coordinate
our 55 team members and run the
meetings," said Lexie Miedema,
LSA junior and co-fashion editor.
"When we do photo shoots,
that's our entire Saturday - pick
up the models, bring themto hair
and makeup, communicating
with stores, organizing clothing,
going to fittings, organizing
photographers to make sure that
they're on the same page as us,

SHEI's charity fashion shows
have also helped to expand its
presence in Ann Arbor. The
magazine has worked with
several charities, and last year
the staff partnered with Merit

donates 20 percent of its profits
to fund scholarships for Detroit

Corrigan said. "He told us about

them, he was a University alum,
he has a history with SHEI,
so it just seemed like a perfect
fit. He has a charity that goes
along with it, so it was just the
clothes, the organization, just
doing something fashionable and
passing the money along."
Though the Ann Arbor
community is essential to
SHEI's work on the ground and
its runway shows, its executive
board doesn't view it as an Ann
Arbor fashion magazine.
"Even in brainstorming what
we wanted our tagline to be, we
kind of debated whether to tailor
it directly to the University of
Michigan or keep it separate,"
Fuller said. "I look at us as a
global fashion magazine. We're
very proud of Ann Arbor and the
University of Michigan, but it's
not our defining factor, I would
say."
"The slogan we came up
with this past fall is 'Flipping
pages, turning heads,"' Corrigan
said. "It starts with the actual
product, the magazine. And
then with 'turning heads,' we
want to get people's attention
for new fashion trends, articles
and concepts - our content, we
really want to draw people's
attention to that."
Pride in the Product
For an individual member of
a large organization, it's easy to
feel like just another spoke in
the wheel - you get caught up
in your day-to-day routine, focus
on the task at hand and lose sight
of where it's all headed.
At SHEI, however, that feeling
of malaise is countered by the
magazine's ability to provide
an inclusive community for its
members.
"We really want to be a
resource for students on campus
who are interested in fashion
and the publication world,"
Corrigan said. "It's for people
who are interested in fashion
and culture and self-expression
as an industry and as a creative
outlet, and just helping them
develop the skills and interests
that brought them to us in the
first place."
"I really like to say and let
people know that there's a place
for everyone at SHEI, and no
matter what your interest is you
can contribute to the magazine
in some way," Fuller added.
But, ultimately, SHEI's staff
is driven by their pride in the
product and the organization as
a whole embodied in the physical
magazine.
"I think it's really wonderful
to have everybody working so
hard, almost individually, but

then to have the team meetings
and really see that everyone's on
the same page," Ellis said. "But
just everyone's combined efforts
over a semester-long period ...
it doesn't seem like it's going
to ever actually happen, that
we're going to actually have a

The magazine is a trophy to " and

The magazine is a testament

But, above all, the magazine

community that built it.

Where do you shop?
"I try thrift shopping, but to be
honest I'm kind of impatient, you
have to have a lot of patience for
that. I'm not going to lie, Buffalo
doesn't have a lot of options, but
i still shop at Free People and
Anthropologie. I also really like
little markets when I'm traveling
with linens, scarves and jewelry
especially turquoise stones and
big rocks."

have behind a piece of clothing?

go to the family."

gettingdressedinthemorning?
"It's kind of whatever I feel like
that day, but it's really important

actually start thinking about it
the night before because I just
want to do it right and feel good
all day."
What's your favorite

item of clothing?
"I have these cyberpunk goth

design on them."
