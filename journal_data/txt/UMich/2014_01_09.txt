University President Mary Sue Cole-
man brought students back a souvenir
from her recent trip to India: a new
theme semester.
Mirroring the University's involve-
ment in the subcontinent, the LSA
Winter 2014 Theme Semester explores
India's changing role in the world
through courses, lectures, museum
exhibits and other opportunities.
Students from India make up the
fourth largest group of international
students at the University. Additionally,
the University of Michigan India Alum-
ni Association has over 1400 members,
according to the organization's Face-

book page.
Called "India in the World," the
theme semester will focus on changes
in the world's second-most-populous
country. Associate Prof. Farina Mir,
director of South Asian Studies and the
Winter 2014 Theme Semester, said the
theme aims to change some popular
perceptions of India.
"Conceptions of India have been
changing from this sort of limited spec-
trum that focuses on mysticism and
poverty to this sort of complex under-
standing of this dynamic society and
impact on the world," Mir said.
She added that - despite the fact
India is the world's largest democracy
and has the largestmiddle class - many
reduce it to a backward, poverty-strick-
en nation.
LSA has offered theme semesters
since 1980, according to its website. The
college fuses the University's classroom
and research opportunities to provide a
comprehensive discussion of a particu-
lar topic.

Alabama offensive
coordinator to replace
Borges, reports say
By ZACH HELFAND
and LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Writers
The Michigan football team has
hired Alabama offensive coordinator
DougNussmeier, accordingto multiple

reports, to replace former offensive
coordinator Al Borges after the Michi-
gan Athletic Department announced
Wednesday afternoon that he would
not be returning for the 2014 season.
The news, which appears to have
been broken by Football Scoop, came
just five hours after the Wolverines
announced that Borges had been fired.
ESPN's Joe Schad also tweeted confir-
mation.
CBS Sports's Bruce Feldman report-
ed that Nussmeier, 43, will become

one of the top-five paid coordinators
in college football. That would put his
salary at no less than $850,000. Nuss-
meier made about $680,000 at Ala-
bama. Michigan defensive coordinator
Greg Mattison is the fourth-highest
paid assistant in the nation, earning
more than $851,000, while Borges was
No. 9, at about $709,000.
The Nussmeier hiring likely signals
a continuation of the offensive phi-
losophy favored under Michigan coach

Mary Beth Seiler, director of

Messages implicate
Christie aide in NJ
bridge's traffic jam

NIH tasks health
network as part of
national initiative
By AMABEL KAROUB
Daily Staff Reporter
The National Institutes of
Health created a national net-
work earlier this month to
streamline the research and
treatment of strokes, one of the
leading causes of death in the
United States, and the University
of Michigan Health System will
play a prominent role in its imple-
mentation and administration.
The NIH Stroke Trials Net-
work, referred to as StrokeNet,
encompasses 25 regional net-
works, includingnine hospitals in
the state of Michigan. Michigan
StrokeNet will be coordinated by
UMHS, led by two co-principal
investigators: Neurology Prof.
Devin Brown and Emergency
Medicine Prof. Phillip Scott.
Scott said a network to stan-
dardize stroke clinical trials is
overdue, since research teams in
the past were often disbanded
every time a clinical trial was
complete.
"Every time we have a drug
come out, we have to rebuild a
clinical network - a group of hos-
pitals, investigators, clinicians,
researchers," Scott said. "Trials
can last anywhere from two to
five years on average. After that,
the results are published, but the
network falls apart, and waits for
the next drug to come out. The
broad picture is to streamline
that process so that we don'thave
to rebuild the wheel every time
we want to do atrial."
Strokes occur when blood flow
to the brain is interrupted, causing
brain cells in the area to die due
to lack of oxygen. Strokes are the
the fourth largest cause of death
and leading cause of disability in
the United States. StrokeNet has
set out to improve stroke care

through research in three main
categories: acute treatment, pre-
vention and rehabilitation.
As the leader of Michigan's
StrokeNet, UMHSwillberespon-
sible for the conduct of clinical
trials at all of the StrokeNet sites
in the state.
Brown and Scott have worked
together for over a decade and
they will work side by sideto man-
age the network. Even so, their
research concentrations will dif-
fer slightly. While Scott will focus
on the acute treatment or emer-
gency phase of stroke care, Brown
will focus on prevention.
Brown will also be respon-
sible for educating future
researchers. StrokeNet hospi-
tals will be provided funding
to create fellowships that will
prepare younger doctors for a
future in clinical trials related
to strokes. With these fellow-
ships, UMHS hopes to attract
residents and fellows not only
from within the University, but
from around the country.
"We are actually leading
the next generation, hopefully
not having to make them redo
what we spent 20 years doing."
Scott said. "Not only speeding
the process of clinical trials for
patients, but speeding the pro-
cess of clinician scientist devel-
opment. "
Scottsaid StrokeNetis innova-
tive because it is the first stroke
network that will focus on Phase
III clinical trials. Phase III trials
often include a thousand or more
patients and decide conclusively
whether the new treatment is a
success or a failure.
The NIH already has a network
for Phase I and Phase II clinical
trials, which it set up roughly a
decade ago. These types of trials
ensure the safety and efficacy of
new stroke drugs, but include a
relatively small number of human
patients. The network is called
Spotrias and has 10 regional cen-
ters that perform early clinical
trials.

Democrats use
"Bridgegate"
as evidence of
political bullying
TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A
political dirty-tricks investi-
gation of Gov. Chris Christie's
inner circle broke wide open
Wednesday with the release of
emails and text messages that
suggest one of his top aides
engineered traffic jams in a
New Jersey town last Septem-
ber to punish its mayor.
An "outraged and deeply
saddened" Christie responded
by saying he was misled by his
aide, and he denied involve-
ment in the apparent act of
political payback.
The messages were obtained
by The Associated Press and
other news organizations
Wednesday amid a statehouse
investigation into whether the
lane closings that led to the tie-
ups were retribution against
the mayor of Fort Lee for not
endorsing Christie for re-elec-
tion last fall.
"Time for some traffic prob-
lems in Fort Lee," Christie dep-
uty chief of staff Bridget Anne
Kelly wrote in August in a mes-
sage to David Wildstein, a top
Christie appointee on the Port
Authority of New York and New
Jersey.
"Got it," Wildstein replied.
A few weeks later, Wildstein
closed two of three lanes con-
necting Fort Lee to the heav-
ily traveled George Washington
Bridge, which runs between
New Jersey and New York City.
The messages do not directly
implicate Christie in the shut-
down. But they appear to con-
tradict his assertions that the
closings were not punitive and
that his staff was not involved.
Democrats seized on the
material as more evidence that

the potential Republican can-
didate for president in 2016 is a
bully.
The messages "indicate what
we've come to expect from
Gov. Christie - when people
oppose him, he exacts retribu-
tion. When people question
him, he belittles and snidely
jokes. And when anyone dares
to look into his administration,
he bullies and attacks," Demo-
cratic National Committee
chairwoman Debbie Wasser-
man-Schultz said.
In a statement issued late
Wednesday, Christie said: "I am
outraged and deeply saddened
to learn that not only was I mis-
led by a member of my staff, but
this completely inappropriate
and unsanctioned conduct was
made without my knowledge."
"People will be held respon-
sible for their actions," he
added, but gave no details.
Kelly had no immediate com-
ment.
Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokol-
ich called it "appalling" thatthe
traffic jams appear to have been
deliberately created.
"When it's man-made and
when it was done with venom
and when it was done intention-
ally, it is, in my mind, the prime
example of political pettiness,"
he said. He said the gridlock
put people in danger by hold-
ing up emergency vehicles, and
he added that those responsible
should resign.
While Sokolich is a Demo-
crat, Christie sought bipartisan
support during his re-election
campaign to bolster his image
as a pragmatic leader willing
to work with his political oppo-
nents.
Democratic state Assembly-
man John Wisniewski, who has
been leading the investigation,
said the material in the docu-
ments is "shocking" and "outra-
geous" and calls into question
the honesty of the governor and
his staff.

Mich. economic
outlook better, still

A statewide survey of business
people shows that their confi-
dence in Michigan's economy has
grown greatly since the bottom of
the Great Recession, with room to
improve as well.
Results of the second annual
Michigan Economic Outlook sur-
vey were released Wednesday at
the Detroit Economic Club.
Margaret Baker of Ann Arbor's
Baker Strategy Group says that
leaders of Michigan's key manu-
facturers gave the state a business
rating of 65, up from 25 in 2009.
Baker says that's still low.
Michigan State University
economist Charles Ballard says
a concern is how many Michi-

struggling to cope with a shrunk-
en tax bases after property values
fell sharply.
The forum took place at the
MotorCity Casino in Detroit.

Armon Tabrizi said he was not
immediately sure where to land
before deciding to put the Cessna
172RG Cutlass down in the mid-
dle of Boniface Parkway Tuesday
afternoon, the Anchorage Daily
News reported. Tabrizi, 27, avoid-
ed cars and stoplights, and no one
in the plane or on the ground was
injured.
BERLIN
German leader
will visit U.S. after
NSA allegations
German Chancellor Angela
Merkel has accepted an invitation
to visit the United States, months
after allegations that U.S. intel-
ligence had tapped her phone
strained relations between Berlin
and Washington.
In a call Wednesday, President
Barack Obama congratulated
Merkel on forming a new govern-
ment last month and wished her
speedy recovery from a recent
skiing accident.
Merkel's spokesman, Steffen
Seibert, said Obama also invit-
ed Merkel to Washington "in
the coming months," which she
accepted.
The White House said both
leaders noted the agenda that
awaits them this year, including
negotiations toward a proposed
free-trade deal between the U.S.
and the EU, and a NATO summit

in the spring.
PARIS
France fines
Google $204,000
over privacy policy
The French digital priva-
cy watchdog is fining Google
150,000 euros ($204,000) for
breaking rules on ensuring data
privacy.
The CNIL agency said on
Wednesday that Google's new
privacy policy - which applies
to all of its services from e-mail
to calendars - isn't specific
enough about how and why it
collects data from users and
doesn't define how long it keeps
such data, among other prob-
lems. EU authorities also have
said the new privacy policy
doesn't follow their rules.
Google has contended that its
new policy is simpler and com-
plies with European law.
Since the company did not
change its policy as request-
ed, the CNIL said it is fining
Google. The agency also asked
the search giant to post a state-
ment about the decision on its
French home page, google.fr.

Fla. citrus farmers
TRAVERSE CITY, Mich.
(AP) - From a field station in
northern Wisconsin, where
the previous night's low was a
numbing29 degrees below zero,
climate scientist John Lenters
studied computer images of
ice floes on Lake Superior with
delight.
It may be hard to think of
this week's deep. freeze as any-
thing but miserable, but to sci-
entists like Lenters there are
silver linings: The extreme cold
may help raise low water in the
Great Lakes, protect shorelines
and wetlands from erosion, kill
insect pests and slow the migra-
tion of invasive species.
"All around, it's a positive
thing," Lenters, a specialist in
the climate of lakes and.water-
sheds, said Wednesday.
Ice cover on the Great Lakes
has been shrinking for decades,
but this year more than 60 per-
cent of the surface is expected
to freeze over at soie point -
an occurrence that could help
the lakes rebound from a pro-
longed slump in water levels.

Even agriculture can benefit.
Although cold weather is gener-
ally no friend to crops, some of
southern Florida's citrus fruits
can use a perfectly timed cool-
down, which they were getting
as midweek temperatures hov-
ered around freezing.
"A good cold snap lowers the
acidity in oranges and increases
sugar content, sweetens the
fruit," said Frankie Hall, policy
director for the Florida Farm
Bureau Federation. "It's almost
been a blessing."
Scientists noted that sub-
zero temperatures and pound-
ing snowfalls like those that
gripped much of the nation for
several days are not unheard-of
in the Midwest and Northeast
and used to happen more fre-
quently.
For all the misery it inflicted,
the polar vortex that created
the painfully frigid conditions
apparently broke no all-time
records in any major U.S. cit-
ies, according to Jeff Masters,
meteorology director of Weath-
er Underground.
"I'm just happy to see that we
have a normal winter for once,"
said Lenters, who works for
Limnotech, an environmental
consulting firm in Ann Arbor.
As the climate has warmed,
the absence of bitter cold has
actually been damaging.

The emerald ash borer, an
insect native to Asia, arrived
in the U.S. around 2002 and
has killed about 50 million ash
trees in the Upper Midwest. But
some locales this winter may
have gotten cold enough to kill
at least some larvae, said Robert
Venette, a U.S. Forest Service
research biologist in St. Paul,
Minn.
A reading of minus 20 will
usually produce a 50 percent
mortality rate, and "the num-
bers go up quickly as it gets
colder than that," Venette said.
While the freeze won't wipe
out the ash borer, it will give
communities a chance to devel-
op plans for limiting the bug's
spread, he said.
Other pests that originated in
warmer places could be affect-
ed as well, including the gypsy
moth, the hemlock woolly adel-
gid and the European beetle
that carries Dutch elm disease,
said Lee Frelich, director of the
University of Minnesota Cen-
ter for Forest Ecology. Native
insects have evolved to cope
with deep freezes.
Extreme cold also reins in
invasive nuisance plants such
as kudzu, which has ravaged

Basketball star
draws criticism
in light of alleged
atrocities in country
PYONGYANG, North Korea
(AP) - Dennis Rodman sang
"Happy Birthday" to North
Korean leader Kim Jong Un
before leadinga squad of former
NBA stars in a friendly game
Wednesday as part of his "bas-
ketball diplomacy" that has been
criticized in the United States as
naive and laughable.
Rodman dedicated the game
to his "best friend" Kim, who
along with his wife and other
senior officials and their wives
watched from a special seat-
ing area. The capacity crowd of
about 14,000 at the Pyongyang
Indoor Stadium clapped loudly
as Rodman sang a verse from the
birthday song.
Rodman said he was honored
to be able to play the game in the
North Korean capital and called
the event "historic." Some mem-
bers of the U.S. Congress, the
NBA and human rights groups,
however, say he has become a
public relations tool for North
Korea's government.
The government's poorhuman
rights record and its threats to
use nuclear weapons against
rival South Korea and the Unit-
ed States have kept it a pariah
state. Kim shocked the world in
December by having his uncle,
once considered his mentor,
executed after being accused of
a litany of crimes including cor-
ruption, womanizing, drug abuse
and attempting to seize power.
Rodman, 52, has refused to
address those concerns while
continuing to forge a relation-
ship with Kim, whose age has
never been officially disclosed.
The government did not say how
old he turned Wednesday but he
is believed to be in his early30s.
At the start of the game, Rod-
man sang "Happy Birthday" to
Kim, who was seated above in

the stands at the stadium, and
then bowed deeply as North
Korean players clapped.
To keep it friendly, the Ameri-
cans played against the North
Koreans in the first half, but split
up and merged teams for the sec-
ond half.
The North Korean team
scored 47 points to 39 for the
Americans before the teams
were mixed. Rodman played only
in the first half and then sat next
to Kim during the second half.
"A lot of people have expressed
different views about me and
your leader, your marshal, and I
take that as a compliment," Rod-
man told the crowd. "Yes, he is a
great leader, he provides for his
people here in this country and
thank God the people here love
the marshal."
Rodman is the highest-pro-
file American to meet Kim. He
has carefully avoided getting
involved in overtly political
activities, saying that he is not a
statesman and instead is seeking
only to build cultural connec-
tions with the North through
basketball that may help improve
relations between Pyongyang
and Washington.
Rodman has been slammed
in particular for not using his
influence with Kim to help free
Kenneth Bae, an American mis-
sionary in poor health who is
being confined in the North for
"anti-state" crimes. In an inter-
view with CNN on Tuesday, Rod-
man implied that Bae was at fault
for being held captive.
Bae's sister, Terri Chung, said
his family couldn't believe what
Rodman said.
"Here's somebody who is in a
position to do some good for Ken-
neth and refusesto do so," Chung
told KOMO Radio in Seattle on
Wednesday. "And then after the
fact, instead, he decides to hurl
these unqualified accusations
against Kenneth. It's clear he has
no idea what he's talking about.
I'm not sure who he's talking to,
where he's getting his informa-
tion, but he's certainly no author-
ity on Kenneth Bae."

Giffords skydives
on anniversary of
riZ. mass shootin g

Several ceremonies
commemorate
three years since
supermarket attack
TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) - Gabri-
elle Giffords marked the three-
year anniversary of an attack
that left her severely wounded
and forced her to resign from
Congress by skydiving Wednes-
day in a feat that highlights her
ongoing recovery after having to
learn how to walk and talk again.
Across the city, others
gathered for bell-ringing and
flag-raising ceremonies to
remember the six killed and 13
injured, including Giffords, on
Jan. 8, 2011, as the former Ari-
zona congresswoman met with
constituents outside a grocery
store.
Giffords waved and blew
kisses to a crowd at a skydiving
site between Phoenix and Tuc-
son after successfully landing
without injury.
"Gabby landed beautifully.
Happy she's safe. So proud of
her bravery," Giffords' husband,
former astronaut Mark Kelly,
wrote on his Twitter account
after the tandem jump with his
wife strapped to a professional
skydiver.
Jimmy Hatch, a former Navy
SEAL who accompanied Gif-
fords along with others, said the
group held hands and formed a
circle shortly after exiting the
aircraft, then made a line with
Giffords in the middle.
"She was the least nervous
person on the plane," Hatch
said, calling Giffords a "rock
star" for making the jump on
such an emotional day.

"They did a little moment
of silence at the drop zone," he
said. "The emotion was really
heavy. Then she smiled and
said, 'Let's go."'
Vice President Joe Biden's
office said he called Giffords on
Wednesday to wish her good
luck.
"Gabby's courage & deter-
mination has been absolutely
inspirational," Biden wrote on
his office's Twitter account.
Giffords' jump will be
broadcast Thursday on NBC's
"Today" show.
In Tucson, about 100 resi-
dents attended a ceremony
Wednesday morning outside
the University of Arizona Med-
ical Center, where the injured
were treated. A bell was rung
once for each victim as the Rev.
Joe Fitzgerald spoke to the
crowd.
"Today, we gather to remem-
ber the tragic day three years
ago when our community was
deeply wounded," he said.
Other ceremonies and
moments of silence took place
across the city.
"I think the commemorations
are, in large part, recognition of
our community's collective care
and compassion and grit to go
on," Tucson Mayor Jonathan
Rothschild said.
Pam Simon, 66, who was a
Giffords aide at the time of the
attack and suffered a gunshot
wound to the chest, reflected on
the shooting with crisp memo-
ries, but also a positive outlook.
"When we stop on an anni-
versary to really reflect, some-
times it opens the wounds a
little bit," she said. "But it's also
gratifying in a way to see the
community come out again and
remember."

Prelates attend a mass celebrated by Cardinal Velasio De Paolis at the Legion's main headquarters, the Ateneo Pontificio
Regina Apostolorum, in Rome, Wednesday.
Vatican continues efforts to
reform Legion after scandal

Congregation
gathers to discuss
changes after sexual
misconduct
VATICAN CITY (AP) - The
Vatican delegate running the
troubled Legion of Christ urged
its priests on Wednesday to
elect a new leadership worthy
of authority, after suffering for
years from shame and suspicion
following revelations that its
founder was a pedophile.
He said the new leaders must
infuse the religious order with
a new spirit to finish a process
of reform he said had only just
begun.
Cardinal Velasio De Paolis
presided over a Mass opening a
month-long meeting of Legion
delegates to elect a new leader-
ship and finalize new constitu-
tions that must be submitted to
Pope Francis for approval. The
meeting is the culmination of a
three-year Vatican experiment

to try to turn the congregation
around after a Holy See investi-
gation uncovered serious prob-
lems in the cult-like movement.
The Legion was once held up
as a model by the Vatican, which
was impressed by the ortho-
doxy of its priests and its abil-
ity to attract seminarians and
donations at a time when voca-
tions were on the decline. But in
reality, the order's founder, the
Rev. Marcial Maciel, was lead-
ing a double life, sexually abus-
ing his seminarians, fathering
three children and creating a
twisted system of power that
kept most Legion priests in the
dark and infected the very life
of the order.
The Legion scandal repre-
sents one of the worst to afflict
the Catholic Church in the 20th
century, an egregious example
of the church's concern for
the institution over victims
of sexual abuse. Despite cred-
ible reports sent to the Vatican
starting inthe1950sthat Maciel
was a pedophile, drug addict
and manipulative liar, it took

until 2006 for then-Pope Bene-
dict XVI to bring Maciel to jus-
tice. The Mexican prelate died
two years later.
Benedict took the Legion
over in 2010 and appointed
De Paolis to oversee a whole-
scale reform, leading up to the
assembly that began Wednes-
day. While the Legion insists
great strides have been made
- decision-making is more
decentralized, priests have bet-
ter training and emails are no
longer screened - De Paolis
said the reform has only just
begun.
"It has been repeatedly
stressed that the revision of the
constitutions cannot simply be
considered a technical effort,
but should be accompanied by
a process of examination of
life, of review and of spiritual
renewal for the institute," he
told the gathering of a few hun-
dred priests in the chapel of the
Legion's seminary on the out-
skirts of Rome. "Thus far, we
have only completed the pro-
cess of preparation."

Risk without reward
Michigan's DEQ needs to redefine its environmental standards
requent patrons of Michigan's sand dunes may soon find them
littered with cul-de-sacs and vacation houses. On Monday,
Michigan's Department of Environmental Quality released a
public letter indicating its intention to permit the construction of a cluster
of houses on the Saugatuck Dunes. Located in Saugatuck, Michigan, the
state park is a fragile ecosystem that plays a significant role in Michigan's
tourist industry. The DEQ needs to reconsider its position and halt the
construction project. Preserving the Saugatuck Dunes is in the best
interest of the state and risking environmental integrity for a few houses
is an unnecessary gamble.

The proposal to build 18 houses and a road
comes from realty company Singapore Dunes.
Stephen Neumer, the managing director of
Singapore Dunes, said a permit from the DEQ
"is key to making the land usable and devel-
opable." Despite the limited initial plans,
Neumer has admitted that the company aims
to eventually construct condominium build-
ings, a resort and marina. Earlier plans even
called for a golf course. Critics have warned
against the potential economic repercussions
of disrupting the dunes. In a statement, the
Saugatuck Dunes Coastal Alliance argued
that the construction project will cause
"devastating and irreversible damage" to the
"globally rare and fragile dune system."
Coastal dunes are a vital part of the state's
environment. Primarily, they act as a natural
barrier to high winds and destructive waves
that could otherwise reach areas further inland.
Dunes are able to maintain their size by mov-
ing inland in response to water level changes;
however, buildings constructed close to dunes
prevent this reaction and slowly reduce the bar-
riers' width. Furthermore, the dunes are host to
a wide arrayof wildlife, which in turn help keep
their sand and structure in place. Plants such
as lichens, mosses, grasses ,and wildflowers
have adapted over time to the extreme weather

dunes are subjected to. High foot and vehicu-
lar traffic on dunes destroys these life forms,
decreasing the stability of the dunes' structure
and increasingthe risk of flood.
Dunes also attract tourists - a huge part of
Michigan's economy. In 2010, the state earned
$964.2 million in tourism-related revenue and
152,600 thousand jobs were created by the
tourism industry. Saugatuck itself, where the
dunes are located, depends on tourism. With
the degradation of the Saugatuck Dunes, not
only will the city's economy suffer, but the state
will lose revenue from taxes as well.
Rather than protecting Michigan's ecologi-
cal gem, the DEQ's standards are actually the
basis for allowing the encroachment of the
dunes. After reviewing its internal require-
ments, the DEQ is planning to grant a permit
for constructingtwo cul-de-sacs and 18 houses.
DEQ director Dan Wyant has said that its own
Sand Dunes Protection and Management stat-
ute allows for the construction plans proposed
by Singapore Dunes. "We are compelled to
issue the permit," said Wyant. As it stands, the
DEQ's regulation of the dunes is too relaxed and
needs to be amended. With such few protec-
tions in place already, the DEQ must take seri-
ously its responsibility to protect Michigan's
sand dunes.

ver winter break, I went
to a bar with some friends
because I can do that now.
The bar sits on
the border of
Grosse Pointe
and Detroit. It's
a cute, hole-in-

of place called
"My Dad's Bar,"
equipped with KATIE

with twitchy string lights. I went
with afew friends from high school,
and just like in high school, my dad
drove us.
It was pretty weird having my
dad drive us to the bar (albeit fitting
- my dad drove us to "My Dad's
Bar!" Ha!). It was even weirder at 2
a.m., when the bar was closing and
my dad wandered into the place -
clearly the oldest, tallest and bald-
est person there - and towered over
our table to tell me, "Hey sweetie,
just letting you know I'm here. The
car's just around the corner!"
OK. I didn't ask for this. I have a
driver's license. I wasn't planning
on drinking. I was more than capa-
ble of being the designated driver
for the night. But alas, my father
insisted, in his typical nice-yet-
controlling manner.
He had good intentions, but
these intentions were grounded in
fear. He had assumed I was driving
by myself and meeting my friends
at the bar. This, of course, would
have meant that I would have had
to walk the whole 15 feet from the
parking lot to the bar, in the dark, in

CARLY MANES '
Changing UHS condom brands

Aforum for biased discussion

All condoms are equally effective if used cor-
rectly. Whether it's Lifestyle, Trojan, Kimono
Microthin or Durex, all the contraceptives seen
in drugstores, on campus and at Planned Parr-
enthood are FDA-approved and equally likely to
protect against STI's and HIV. But just because
all condom brands have the same effectivity
rate does not mean that they are all equally pre-
ferred. Many people are influenced by majorly
marketed brands such as Trojan or Durex, and
therefore have a preconceived notion that these
brands provide the best protection.
I've been distributing condoms since I was
16, handing out every variety of contraception
on the market. Each and every time the same
thing happens - if it's not Trojan or Durex,
most students won't take it. As a freshman,
I was a sexual health peer educator for the
group PULSE in East Quad. Every weekend,
I would put the University Health Service
provided LifeStyles on my door for students
to take. That same year, I was a member of
the Great American Condom Campaign, a
program run by Advocates for Youth that
sends 500 Trojan condoms to a student to
distribute on campus. In two months of con-
dom distribution, I had zero Trojan condoms
left, and almost my entire stack of Lifestyles
untouched.Accordingto aBMC Public Health
study, patrons are much more likely to make
use of free condoms when there are a variety
of brands and styles available. "The provision
of assorted brand-name condoms, over a sin-
gle brand name, can serve to increase condom
acquisition," the study contends.
As stated before, all condoms are equal-
ly effective. Educating students about the
importance of contraception and the effec-
tivity is crucial, but even with the incred-
ible education efforts and outreach by UHS
groups such as PULSE and Sexperteam,
reducing the stigma around contraception
takes time. In order to best address student
health needs we must provide contraception
students will use.
No one is denying the merit of the amaz-
ing work that groups such as PULSE and
Sexperteam do on campus. Both groups are

dedicated to educating our campus community
about safe sexual health practices and distrib-
uting UHS-provided contraception to students
in residential halls as well as off campus. What
PULSE students do is integral to providing
information on contraception to students, but
tasking 30 students with changingcampus cul-
ture is a timely process.
What we need is a culture shift, which takes
time. We need to reduce the stigma around con-
traceptive use and ensure that all students have
access to information on safe sexual practices
as well as a variety of contraceptive options.
A culture change doesn't happen over night,
however, STI and HIV infections do. As sexual
educators, we know that regardless of what
contraceptive you may use, or what contracep-
tive UHS provides, they are all equally effective
at preventing STI's and HIV infection as well as
unintended pregnancy, as long as they're used
correctly. Because of marketing and cultural
norms, not every student feels comfortable
using lesser-known contraceptives, like the
ones that UHS provides (e.g. Kimono Microthin
and LifeStyles). While we advocate for better
education around the effectivity of these con-
traceptives, we recognize that cultural change
is a long process, and with over half of all new
STI infections are occurring in young people,
we must be proactive now to deliver the contra-
ceptives that students want, to ensure that all
young people are protected themselves.
We fully support a variety of options for stu-
dents, seeing as every individual has personal
preferences and needs. We support the contin-
ued availability of female condoms, dental dams
and non-latex condoms at UHS, but we believe
that to best serve the majority of students' sex-
ual health needs, a student requested brand like
Trojan or Durex is the best short-term solution.
We are calling on UHS to provide Trojan
condoms as one of the main contraceptives for
students. Please sign our petition to show UHS
that sexual health is important to our campus
community. If the Spartans already use Tro-
jans, why can't we?

Despite the measures taken to
provide refuge from the weather,
homeless people in Ann Arbor
expressed the need for more aid.
"There is a humanitarian crisis
in Ann Arbor - it is not going to

it," Tracy Williams, one of the
homeless, said.

Ann Arbor, Tate Williams, who

Fallujah tribal leaders warn
aainst al- Qaida occupation

Iraqi government
prepares measures
to recapture city
after recent attacks
BAGHDAD (AP) - Tribal
leaders in the besieged city
of Fallujah warned al-Qaida-
linked fighters to leave to avoid
a military showdown, echoing
a call by Iraq's prime minis-
ter Wednesday that they give
up their fight as the govern-
ment pushes to regain control
of mainly Sunni areas west of
Baghdad.
The warning came as gun-
men attacked an Iraqi army
barracks in a Sunni area north
of Baghdad, killing 12 soldiers.
Seven soldiers were wounded
in the assault in Diyala prov-
ince, authorities said.
The United Nations and the
Red Cross, meanwhile, said
Fallujah and nearby areas are
facing mounting humanitar-
ian concerns as food and water
supplies start to run out.
Sectarian tensions have been
on the rise for months in Sun-
ni-dominated Anbar province
as minority Sunnis protested
what they perceive as discrimi-
nation and random arrests by
the Shiite-led government.
Violence spiked after the Dec.
28 arrest of a Sunni lawmaker
sought on terrorism charges
and the government's disman-
tling of a year-old anti-govern-
ment Sunni protest camp in the
provincial capital of Ramadi.
Last week, al-Qaida-linked
gunmen seized control of
Ramadi and nearby Fallujah,
cities that were among the
bloodiest battlefields for U.S.
forces during the Iraq war. The
militants overran police sta-
tions and military posts, freed
prisoners and set up their own
checkpoints.
The United States and Iran
have offered material help for
the Iraqi government but say
they won't send in troops.
Speaking in his weekly tele-
vision address, Prime Minis-

ter Nouri al-Maliki hinted of a
possible pardon for supporters
of al-Qaida's local branch, the
Islamic State of Iraq and the
Levant, or ISIL, if they abandon
the fight.
"The war that is being fought
by the Iraqi security forces,
tribes and all segments of Iraqi
society against al-Qaida and its
affiliates is a sacred war," he
said. "I call on those who were
lured to be part of the terror-
ism machine led by al-Qaida to
return to reason."
In exchange, he promised
that his government will "open
a new page to settle their cases
so that they won't be fuel for
the war that is led by al-Qaida."
Iraq's government has
rushed additional troops and
military equipment to Anbar
and has been carrying out air-
strikes in an effort to dislodge
the militants.
Skirmishes between Iraqi
forces and militants broke out
on the outskirts of Fallujah
and Ramadi again Wednesday,
according to witnesses, and
militants blew up a small bridge
on the edge of Ramadi, officials
in Anbar said. There was no
immediate report of casualties.
At least four crew members
were killed when a military
helicopter crashed in Anbar,
according to army and govern-
ment officials in the province
and state TV. The officials said
the cause was poor weather
conditions in the area and there
was no indication militants
brought it down. They spoke on
condition of anonymity because
they weren't authorized to
release the information.
Influential tribal leaders
have been meeting to try to
find a way out of the crisis and
demanded that al-Qaida mem-
bers holed up in Fallujah get out
of town, said provincial spokes-
man Dhari al-Rishawi.
"They agreed on expelling
ISIL from Fallujah. The told
them to withdraw ... or face
an attack by the tribes and the,
army," he said.
That message was echoed
over mosque loudspeakers late

Tuesday, which also called on
fleeing families to come back.
Al-Rishawi and residents
reached by phone in Fallujah
said at least some of the mili-
tants had left the city, which is
about 40 miles (65 kilometers)
west of Baghdad.
It was not clear how many
had gone, or whether they were
taking up new positions in dif-
ferent parts of the city.
"We, the residents and the
tribes, don't want al-Qaida in
the city. We don't want to see
the same violence we saw when
the Americans were here," said
Ayad al-Halbosi, a 22-year-old
teacher in Fallujah.
Markets in the city began
reopening Wednesday and some
families returned to their homes,
though residents complained
of shortages of fuel and cook-
ing gas. Civilian cars and trucks
were seen on the road and traffic
policemen were on the streets.
The militant gains in Anbar
are posing the most serious
challenge to the Shiite-led gov-
ernment since American forces
withdrew in late 2011 after
years ofbitter warfare following
the 2003 invasion that ousted
Saddam Hussein's Sunni-led
regime and propelled the for-
merly repressed Shiite majority
to power.
Vice President Joe Biden
spoke to al-Maliki for the sec-
ond time this week, voicing
support Wednesday for the
Baghdad government's effort
to regain control of Fallujah.
The White House said Biden
encouraged al-Maliki to con-
tinue talks with local, tribal and
national leaders and said Biden
welcomed al-Maliki's affirma-
tion that Iraqi elections will
occur as scheduled in April.
The U.N. envoy to Iraq,
Nickolay Mladenov, warned
that the humanitarian situation
in Anbar is likely to worsen as
military operations continue.
Food and water supplies in
Fallujah are beginning to run
out; and more than 5;000 fami-
lies have fled to neighboring
provinces to escape the fight-
ing, he said.


GRANTS

ily refers to countries that
joined the EU in 2004 when it
underwent a significant enlarge-
ment. Although the countries
are grouped for the purposes of
the grant, History Prof. Brian
Porter-Szucs suggested that
grouping them together remains
confusing since they are not par-
ticularly new EU additions.
The grants will be administered
through the Weiser Center for
Europe and Eurasia, a member
of the University's International
Institute, starting this year.
Marysia Ostafin, the Center's

program director, said the new
grants align the Center's focus
on expanding opportunities for
students to engage this group of
countries and Kabcenell's person-
al connection to the region.
"(Kabcenell) lives in Hungary,
works in Hungary and is very
attached to that part of the
world," Ostafin said.
Political Science Prof. Anna
Grzymala-Busse, the academic
program director of the Weiser
Center, said the grants allow
exploration of Europe through
several unique lenses.
"The European Union is of course
a major power, there's a whole
post-Communist side of East-
ern Europe, there are places like

Prague and Poland which are
very different." Grzymala-Busse
said. "It's a great way to explore
Europe if you don't know much
about it."
The grants also shed light on less-
er-known areas of Europe, she
said.
"The beauty of it is that there are
these places that are undiscov-
ered gems," Grzymala-Busse said.
Applications will be due in March
for the first summer cohort. The
center also provides several other
grant opportunities for research
and internships in Europe.

Ford, turns down Microsoft

Oil train derails, engulled
in flames in rural Canada

Recent accidents
cause U.S. concern
over transportation
of oil via railways
PLASTER ROCK, New Bruns-
wick (AP) - Officials in Canada
said a derailed freight train carry-
ing crude oil and propane contin-
uedtoburnWednesday,and about
150 residents remained evacuated
from their homes. There were no
deaths or injuries.
Of the 17 cars that derailed late
Tuesday in New Brunswick prov-
ince, five contain crude oil and
four contain liquefied petroleum
gas, officials said. Later Wednes-
day, the Canadian National Rail-
way said two of the cars carrying
liquefied petroleum gas and one
car carrying crude oil were on
fire.
"It is contained, but it is evolv-
ing," said Claude Mongeau, the
chief executive of CN.
The derailment in a sparsely
populated region, roughly 20
miles (32 kilometers) from the

U.S. border and northern Maine,
again raised concerns about the
increasing use of rail to transport
oil throughout North America. In
July, 47 people were killed in Lac-
Megantic, Quebec, when a train
carrying crude oil derailed.
A series of recent derailments
in North America have worried
both officials and residents close
to rail lines. On Dec. 30, an oil
train derailed and exploded in
North Dakota, causing the evacu-
ation of a nearby townbut no inju-
ries.
The train's brakes came on
unexpectedly, Canada's Trans-
portation Safety Board said based
on preliminary information from
the rail company and police.
"Preliminary reports were that
the train was proceeding, and
while proceeding experienced
what we call an undesired brake
application," said Daniel Hol-
brook, a manager with the safety
board. Holbrook also said the
crew found a broken axle.
Andrew Simpson, 30, was play-
ing cards with his uncle Tuesday
evening when the train in New

Brunswick went off the tracks
less than a mile (1.6 kilometers)
away. "The table just kind of rum-
bled, and out the window went a
real bright orange," he said. "We
looked out and the whole train
yard was on fire. We panicked and
called (emergency services)."
New Brunswick Premier David
Alward said there was minimal
impact onthe environment.
Sharon DeWitt, emergency
measures coordinator for the
nearby community of Plaster
Rock, said no one was killed or
injured. She said people were
evacuated within a two-kilometer
(1.24-mile) radius of the fire.
Officials said the regularly
scheduled freight train ran into
trouble around 7 p.m. Tuesday
about 150 kilometers (93 miles)
northwest of Fredericton. Cana-
dian National Railway spokes-
man Mark Hallman said two of
the crude train cars came from
Northern Alberta and three came
from southwestern Manitoba
and were destined for an Irving
Oil refinery in Saint John, New
Brunswick.

CEO credited with
company's financial
upturn, improved
managment culture
DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -
Alan Mulally is staying at Ford.
The CEO, who was rumored
to be in the running to become
Microsoft's next leader, told
The Associated Press Tuesday
that he won't leave the Dear-
born, Mich., automaker before
the end of 2014.
"I would like to end the
Microsoft speculation because
I have no other plans to do any-
thing other than serve Ford,"
Mulally said in an interview.
When asked if this should
end investor concern about his.
departure, Mulally said, "You
don't have to worry about me
leaving." Mulally wouldn't say
if he had talked to Microsoft
about becoming CEO. But he
said the speculation was a dis-
traction for Ford.
Mulally is credited with
returning Ford Motor Co. to
profitability and changing the
company's culture, putting an
end to widespread executive
infighting. Mulally said he will
stick with the plan to stay at
Ford through at least the end
of 2014. When Ford announced
that plan in November 2012, it
also promoted Mark Fields to
chief operating officer, mak-
ing him the likely successor to
Mulally.
Over the last few months,
there have been numerous
reports that Mulally was on
the short list of candidates
to replace Microsoft Corp.
CEO Steve Ballmer. Micro-
soft announced in August that
Ballmer plans to step down as
CEO.

Daniel Ives, an analyst at
FBR Capital Markets, said in an
email that Mulally's decision
was a negative for Microsoft
because he was the front-run-
ner for the CEO job. But Micro-
soft wouldn't say Tuesday if
Mulally's announcement came
as a surprise.
"Out of respect for the pro-
cess and the potential candi-
dates, we don't comment on
individual names," a Microsoft
spokesman told the AP.
Ford shares rose 21 cents to
$15.59 in after-hours trading.
Microsoft shares fell 47 cents
to $36.94.
Mulally's withdrawal from
Microsoft's CEO derby further
shrinks the pool of company
outsiders who have been touted
as Ballmer's potential succes-
sor.
Steve Mollenkopf, the chief
operating officer of smart-
phone chip maker Qualcomm
Inc., was identified as a top
candidate in a Bloomberg
News report last month. But
Qualcomm quickly squelched
the speculation by announcing
plans to promote Mollenkopf to
CEO in March.
With Mulally out of the run-
ning, some of Ballmer's top
lieutenants might have a better
chance of replacing their boss.
The list of internal candidates
includes Satya Nadella, who
oversees the Microsoft's lucra-
tive business of selling comput-
er servers and online services
to other companies and govern-
ment agencies, and Tony Bates,
who joined Microsoft in 2011
when the company paid $8.5
billion for video calling service
Skype.
Microsoft's pending acqui-
sition of Nokia's smartphone
business also has spurred talk
that Nokia CEO Stephen Elop
will replace Ballmer. Elop left

Microsoft in 2010 to join Nokia,
a mobile phone pioneer that
continued to lose market share
to Apple Inc.'s iPhone and
Android devices under Elop's
leadership.
Mulally, 68, was trained as an
aeronautical engineer. He spent
36 years at Boeing Co. - and
was president of the company's
commercial airplane division -
before Ford Chairman Bill Ford
lured him to the struggling
automaker in 2006. He over-
came skepticism aboutbeing an
outsider in the insular ranks of
Detroit car guys by quickly pin-
pointing the reasons why Ford
was losing billions each year.
Just months into his tenure, he
mortgaged all of Ford's assets
- including its Blue Oval logo -
for a $23.5 billion loan to fund
a massive restructuring. It was
a prescient move that helped
Ford avoid the fate of General
Motors and Chrysler, which
both filed for bankruptcy pro-
tection in 2009.
During his tenure, Ford has
earned $32.9 billion in pre-
tax profit and its shares have
more than doubled. The com-
pany expects to earn $8.5 bil-
lion before taxes in 2013. But
it spooked some investors last
month when it said pretax prof-
its would be slightly lower in
2014 as it launches 23 vehicles
worldwide.
Mulally said Tuesday that
the 2014 results will be "abso-
lutely consistent with us invest-
ing even more in the enterprise
for long-term profitable
growth."
Erik Gordon, a business and
law professor at the University
of Michigan, said decision to
stay ensures an orderly transi-
tion to a new CEO.
"It's important for a com-
pany as complex as Ford to do
that," he said.

India aims at limiting perks
of members of US Embassy

An Orbital Sciences Corporation Antares rocket is seen as it is rolled out to launch Pad-OA at NASA's Wallops Flight Facil-
ity, Wallops Island, Va., Sunday, Jan. 5, 2014 in advance of the thwarted trip Wednesday, Jan. 8, 2014.
Harsh solar storm halts
space station supply flight

New regulations
come in light of
controversial arrest
NEW DELHI (AP) - India
chipped away at America's
diplomatic perks Wednesday,
ordering the envoys to obey
local traffic laws and warning
that a popular U.S. Embassy
club violates diplomatic law
because it is open to outsiders.
The moves were the latest in
a campaign to exert pressure
on the U.S. following the arrest
and strip search last month
of Devyani Khobragade, an
Indian diplomat based in New
York City. Indian officials have
called the strip search barbaric
and unnecessary.
Khobragade, 39, is accused
of paying her Indian maid less
than the U.S. minimum wage
and lying about it on a visa
application. She pleaded not
guilty to fraud charges and is
free on bail.
The case has caused an out-
cry in India, where the idea
of an educated, middle-class
woman facing a strip search is
seen as outrageous and heavy-
handed. India has unleashed

a steady stream of retaliatory
measures. Some of the moves,
such as preventing the Ameri-
can Center from screening
movies, are seen as little more
than needling the U.S.
But other actions have raised
some alarm, including the
removal of concrete traffic bar-
riers around the U.S. Embassy
and revoking diplomats' ID
cards.
On Wednesday, the Press
Trust of India news agency
reported that India ordered
the U.S. to stop all "commer-
cial activities" by Jan. 16 at the
American Community Support
Association club. The club has
a restaurant, bar, bowling alley,
swimming pool and other ame-
nities.
India says the fact that non-
diplomats can join the club, at
a cost of more than $1,300 per,
year, violates the Vienna Con-
ventionon Diplomatic Relations.
In Washington, U.S. State
Department spokeswoman Jen
Psaki said the U.S. endeavors to
always comply with local laws
and regulations, and is review-
ing India's requests for action.
She declined to criticize India,
and maintained that "both sides
want to move this relationship

forward."
PTI also reported that
New Delhi warned that U.S.
Embassy vehicles would not be
immune to penalties for traffic
offenses such as unauthorized
parking and running red lights.
Khobragade was arrested
Dec. 13 and was strip-searched
in custody, as is common prac-
tice according to the U.S.
Marshals. But anger is still
smoldering in India more than
a month after the arrest.
Khobragade could face a
maximum sentence of 10 years
for visa fraud and five years for
making a false declaration if
convicted. She has said she has
full diplomatic immunity. U.S.
federal officials dispute that,
saying her immunity is limited
to acts performed in the exer-
cise of consular functions.
U.S. prosecutors and lawyers
for Khobragade are at odds over
a possible plea deal.
A letter filed Tuesday by
attorneys for Khobragade
accused federal prosecutors
of trying to pressure her into
pleading guilty by next week.
The attorneys renewed a
request for an extension of the
Jan. 13 deadline for an indict-
ment.

Weather patterns
suspend trip until
Thursday afternoon
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.
(AP) - A strong solar storm
is interfering with the latest
grocery run to the International
Space Station.
On the bright side, the orbiting
lab has won a four-year exten-
sion, pushing its projected end-
of-lifetime to at least 2024, a full
decade from now.
"This is a big plus for us," said
NASA's human exploration chief,
Bill Gerstenmaier.
On Wednesday, Orbital Sci-
ences Corp. delayed its space
station delivery mission for the
third time.
Another launch attempt will
be made Thursday afternoon.
The company's unmanned
rocket, the Antares, was set to
blast off from Wallops Island,
Va., with a capsule full of sup-
plies and science experiments,
including ants for an educational
project. But several hours before
Wednesday afternoon's planned
flight, company officials took the
unusual step of postponing the
launch for fear that solar radia-
tion could doom the rocket.
Orbital Sciences' chief tech-
nical officer, Antonio Elias, said
solar particles might interfere

with electronics equipment in
the rocket, and lead to a launch
failure.
After evaluating the situation
all day Wednesday, Orbital Sci-
ences decided to aim for Thurs-
day at 1:07 p.m. EST.
The solar flare peaked Tues-
day afternoon and more activity
was expected, but the compa-
ny determined that the space
weather was within acceptable
risk levels. The sun is at the peak
of a weak 11-year storm cycle.
Although the solar storm bare-
ly rated moderate, some passen-
ger jets were being divertedfrom
the poles to avoid potential com-
munication and health issues.
GPS devices also were at risk.
But the six men aboard the
space station were safe from the
solar fallout, NASA said, and sat-
ellites also faced no threat. The
Cygnus cargo ship aboard the
rocket, for example, is built to
withstand radiation from solar
flare-ups.
The storm also will push the
colorful northern lights farther
south than usual to the northern
U.S.
The Cygnus was supposed
to fly in December, but a break-
down in the space station's cool-
ing system required repairs by
spacewalking astronauts. The
repair job, which was completed
on Christmas Eve, bumped the
supply mission to this week.

Then frigid temperatures forced
a launch delay from Tuesday to
Wednesday. Then came the sun
- at full force.
Frank Culbertson, an execu-
tive vice president for Virginia-
based Orbital Sciences, said the
delays can be frustrating, but
he pointed out there's nothing
wrong with the rocket itself.
"All we're really delaying is
the success that's going to come
when we execute this mission,"
he told reporters.
NASA is using two private
companies - Orbital Scienc-
es and the California-based
SpaceX - to keep the space sta-
tion stocked. The space agency
turned to private industry for
help following the space shuttle
program; the last shuttle flight
was in 2011.
Russia, Europe and Japan also
periodically launch supply ships.
Russia corners the space sta-
tion market, though, on astro-
naut travel.
NASA astronauts are hitching
rides on Russian Soyuz capsules
until American companies are
ready to launch human crews.
Gerstenmaier said that should
happen by 2017. NASA will eval-
uate the proposals again this
spring before deciding whether
to buy more Soyuz seats for that
year and beyond, he said. Each
seat costs many tens of millions
of dollars.

US doctors attempt to treat
ethnic divisions in S. Sudan

Last year, doctors
restored over 200

JUBA, South Sudan (AP)
- After receiving eye surgery
from the American doctors, a
South Sudanese man sat with
other patients who belonged to
tribes he once considered ene-
mies. The men spoke about their
newly restored vision - both
their eyesight and how they now
perceive members of other eth-
nic groups as potential friends,
not sworn enemies.

To bring warring factions, often
from rival ethnic groups, back
toward peace after violence
broke out across the country on
Dec. 15.
The group of American doc-
tors had a unique approach to
help heal age-old rifts between
ethnic groups, but it has been
put on hold because of the fight-
ing.
A dry run they tried last year
in Jonglei state, which has since
become the epicenter of the
clashes, was promising. They
restored more than200 patients'
sight through cataract and tra-
choma surgery and helped break
through tribal enmity.
As a condition for the free
surgery, the American doctors
demanded that the members
of rival groups sit together and
talk. Michael Yei of the Moran
Eye Center at the University
of Utah recalls one particular
member of the Murle tribe who
sat with men who belonged to
the Nuer and Dinka groups. The
man soon reached a conclusion
that made the hearts of the med-
ical team soar.
"I always thought in many
ways that the Dinka were devils
and had horns, but they're just
like us," the patient said, accord-
ing to Yei.
"That's the kind of response
we had and were so encour-
aged," Yei continued. "Getting
your sight back is a major and
powerful motivator for people.
It just changes your life."
Capt. Dhuor Andrew Makur,
a 31-year-old doctor in South
Sudan's military, is not sur-
prised that misconceptions like
the one held by the Murle man
could exist in South Sudan. The
population is poorly educated,
with only a 27 percent literacy
rate.
Makur studied at the London
School of Hygiene & Tropical
Medicine, an experience that
showed him what it's like to live
in an advanced society.
The West has spent hun-
dreds of millions of dollars in
South Sudan, but Makur said
not enough is being directed to
education and to ways in which
the disparate ethnic groups can
interact. There are only a couple
dozen miles of paved roads in
South Sudan, the world's newest
country but also one of its least
developed.
"The good things you want
you have to press for - educa-
tion. We're still wild. We come
from the jungle," Makur said.
"Don't bring money to our
people. Bring U.S. companies.
Investin roads. Let people inter-
act"
Four of his relatives, cousins
mostly, have been killed in the
outbreak of violence.
The violence, which forced
the American eye surgeons

to cancel a planned trip this
month to Jonglei state where
they intended to treat hundreds
of patients, has riven South
Sudan along ethnic lines. They
hope to return when the vio-
lence subsides.
Ethnic frictions have long
existed but were largely over-
looked during the civil war
with Sudan that ended with
a 2005 peace agreement that
set the stage for South Sudan
becoming a nation in 2011. Once
independence was achieved,
ethnic fault lines began shining
through.
A power struggle brewing
for months between President
Salva EMir, a Dinka, and former
Vice President Riek Machar,
a Nuer who was fired in July,
broke out into massive violence
just over three weeks ago. The
sudden violent spiral recalled a
battle in 1991 that saw Machar
lead a Nuer slaughter of the
Dinka, said Jok Madut Jok, the
co-founder of the Sudd Insti-
tute, a research body in South
Sudan.
"This conflict escalated so
fast partly due to the history of
the liberation wars, in which
South Sudanese committed
atrocities against one another
and no accountability for these
atrocities was established when
those wars ended, leaving gap-
ing wounds in the hearts and
minds of so many citizens," Jok
wrote in a paper published this
week.
South Sudan's biggest prob-
lem is that it is a patchwork of
small ethnic groups seeking
power, said Edmund Yakani,
the executive director of a
peace-building organization
called CEPO. Potential solu-
tions include more inter-mar-
riage between ethnic groups, a
government not dominated by
ethnicity and an informed citi-
zenry, Yakani said.
Dr. Alan Crandall, vice-chair
of the department of ophthal-
mology at the University of
Utah, remembers the members
of the Dinka, Nuer and Murle
tribes interacting after their
cataract surgeries last year.
Elderly men sat in a circle on
plastic chairs, their eyes shield-
ed from the sun by large black
post-operation glasses.
During the "peace circle,"
Crandall heard a Nuer man say
he would tell his tribe's young
warriors that they should not
attack other ethnic groups.
The medical group began its
mission in the village of Duk
Payuel in Jonglei through the
efforts of John Dau, a former
"Lost Boy" of Sudan who fled
the 1990s conflict by walking to
Ethiopia and eventually finding
his way to Syracuse, New York.
His foundation provides health
care and medical training.

On Recruiting: Coaching instability plaguing efforts

By JASON RUBINSTEIN
Daily Sports Writer
Let's go back to the night of
September 7th.
Everything seemed perfect
for the Michigan football team.
The Wolverines dismantled a
ranked Notre Dame in front of a
record-setting crowd. Beyoncd
even exclaimed "Go Blue!" in
a halftime video message. Life
was good for Michigan fans.
The 2014 recruiting class was
top-tier, and the 2015 class was
starting to take form. Any ques-
tions about Brady Hoke or Al
Borges's job security would've
seemed ridiculous because a
Big Ten championship looked
within reach.
But then the Wolverines sea-
son started to deteriorate, and
they fell to 7-5.
Twitter exploded with
demands for coaching
changes. But was that really
justified? Recruits noticed
these demands, leading to
uncertainty in their minds as to

whether coaching changes were
imminent.
The first to publicly voice
his concerns was five-star
cornerback Jabrill Peppers, the
Wolverines's top-rated commit.
Peppers tweeted that he would
take official visits to other
schools in a violation of Hoke's
recruiting policy, leaving
Peppers decommitted in the
coach's eye.
"I am still 100-percent com-
mitted to the University of
Michigan and that is the place
where I want to go to college,"
Peppers told ESPN's Tom Van-
Haaren after the tweet. "With
the rumors about coach Hoke
possibly not being there, I need
to make sure that IShave options
and have seen other places."
Two days after Peppers's
tweet, Michigan Athletic
Director Dave Brandon
published a blog post to dispel
rumors about the job security of
the coaching staff.
"Brady Hoke is our coach
and will be leading our football
program well into the future,"
he wrote on MoGoBlue.com.
"There is no question about it.
Anyone making efforts to stir
up a coaching controversy at
Michigan is ill-informed and
is likely promoting a personal
agenda that is not in the best
interest of Michigan football."
Brandon's assurances
worked. Peppers later took an
official visit to Ann Arbor and
decided other visits wouldn't be
part of his plan, reaffirming his
commitment to the Wolverines.
Borges, though, wasn't in
Michigan's future plans despite
Brandon's reassurances about
the staff. Wednesday, Hoke
announced Borges wasn't
retained for a fourth year, and
reports soon surfaced that the
coordinator would be replaced
by Alabama's Doug Nussmeier.

Maybe it was a necessary
change. But the Wolverines's
prized 2015 commit, five-star
running back Damien Har-
ris, soon tweeted, "Man ..... I
can't believe this about Coach
Borges."
Only time will tell whether
or not Harris will decommit,
but coaching changes certainly
won't help, even if the offense
may improve without Borges.
But Harris's high school
coach has ties to Borges. The
two coached together at Auburn
in 2007. It's possible that this
is where Harris's apparent
displeasure with the move is
rooted.
And if he decommits, it
would be the second major loss
for Michigan.
George Campbell, a 2015 five-
star wide receiver and ESPN's
No. 2 overall recruit, officially
decommitted from Michigan
in late December, shocking
Wolverine fans and defying
the promise he made when he
committed in August.
"I'm going to stick with
(Michigan)," Campbell said
in an earlier interview with
ESPN's Jared Sandler. "I
was taught to stay with my
commitment, and that's
something I'm going to do, no
matter what, with Michigan."
Weeks after the Peppers
scare, Campbell speared many
Michigan hearts, even before
Borges was fired. Many believe
Campbell's decommitment
occurred because of his fam-
ily's views. Yes, Campbell will
be able to play closer to home if
he chooses to stay in Florida or
enroll anywhere in the south.
When a player commits to
an out-of-state school, there's
always a degree of uncertainty.
Those qualms are easier to
handle with a father-like coach.
Hoke's supposed job insecurity

ADAM GLANZMANN/Daily
Michigan football eoach Brady Hoke announced that offensive coordinator Al Borges will not return to the team in 2014.

pIV 7rJVVl
Borgess annual salary, amongthe
highest in the nation for an assistant.

may well have been the factor
that caused Campbell to
decommit.
It didn't end there. Hjalte
Frojoldt, a four-star defensive
line prospect who hails from
Denmark committed to Arkan-
sas over Michigan after most
recruiting analysts considered
him a heavy Wolverine lean. In
any given year, committing to
Arkansas over Michigan may
sound ordinary and justified.
After all, would you blame a kid
who wants to play in the SEC
and warm weather?
But in 2013 Froholt was dif-
ferent. He was a Michigan lean
through thick and thin. Arkan-
sas also went 3-9 and didn't win
an SEC game. Yes, Michigan
had its struggles, but Arkan-
sas's were far greater. What

did Arkansas have over the
Wolverines? Coaching stability.
It's hard to imagine Borges's fir-
ing would've had any affect on
Froholdt's recruitment.
Bret Beilema just completed
his first year coaching the
Razorbacks after winning three
consecutive Big Ten titles at
Wisconsin.
Hoke, on the other hand,
has had a couple of strong
recruiting classes, but the team
hasn't competed in a Big Ten
championship game, much less
won the conference.
Had Michigan converted the
two-point conversion against
Ohio State, or had one of three
field-goal misses been made
against Penn State, perhaps that
coaching uncertainty wouldn't
have arisen.

Would Brandon have been
forced to make such a bold
statement defending his coach?
Losing Hoke would be
disastrous for Michigan. Just
look at his recruiting classes.
The 2014 contigent is shaping
up tobe star-studded, while the
2015 class is doing the same,
even without Campbell.
Yes, Hoke may be on the hot
seat. But consistently calling for
his firing only exacerbates the
recruiting problems.
For Hoke's recruiting prow-
ess to continue, the coaching
staff largely needs to stay put.

early in the season and had a
tendency to hold onto the ball for
too long. Sophomore quarterback
Shane Morris displayed ample
ability in the Buffalo Wild Wings
Bowl, but is still inexperienced.
Nussmeier should help groom
both quarterbacks.
Nussmeier was a quarterback
in college at Idaho and for five
seasons in the NFL. He began as
a quarterbacks coach, with stints
at Michigan State and with the
St. Louis Rams. He graduated
to offensive coordinator at
Fresno State, before moving to
Washington and Alabama.
Quarterbacks Jake Locker,
Drew Stanton, Jeff Smoker
and Marc Bulger are all former
pupils, all of whom played or
currently play in the NFL.
When Keith Price inherited the
quarterback position afterLocker
left for the NFL, Nussmeier
coached him to new records
in touchdowns, completion
percentage and passing
efficiency. In fact, Washington
improved statistically in each of
Nussmeier's three seasons there.
Nussmeier is ranked the 14th
best recruiter in the nation by 247
Sports's coaching database, and
he could push to sign five-star
quarterback and Alabama com-
mit Ricky Town. Nussmeier was
the lead recruiter in snagging
Town, though ESPN's Tom Van-
Haaren reported that the quar-
terback is planning to stick with

Alabama after the two exchanged
texts Wednesday night.
Still, the offensive line has car-
ried Nussmeier's offense while
at Alabama. In 2012, the Crim-
son Tide featured one of the best
offensive lines in college football
history, three offensive linemen
that were drafted in the first four
rounds of the NFL Draft, includ-
ing two picked in the first round.
Michigan's line will require
much more development. By the
end of the year, Borges had tin-
kered with an unbalanced look,
an end-around heavy offense
and a screen-dependent attack
to mask an interior incapable of
opening holes. None of it worked.
Nussmeier has experimented
little at Alabama.
"You didn't see a lot of new
wrinkles, a lot of new things
here and there," Torrence said.
"It got pretty predictable at some
points."
Crimson Tide fans point to
the loss to Texas A&M in 2012 as
particularly frustrating. Despite
heroics by Texas A&M quarter-
back Johnny Manziel, Alabama
still had a chance to win the game
on its last possession. Needing a
touchdown on 1st-and-goal from
the six-yard line, with the best
offensive line in the nation, Nuss-
meier called three passes out of
the shotgun, with just one run.
The Aggies intercepted the
fourth-down pass, and Alabama
lost.

AUSTIN BIGONEY/The Crimson White
Alabama offensive coordinator Doug Nussmeier will coach Michigan's offense in 2014, according to numerous reports.
Gettingto know: Oensive
coordinator Doug4 Nuss-meier

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Writer
As the offensive coordinator at
Alabama last season, Doug Nuss-
meier, reportedly the Michigan
football team's new offensive
coordinator, was the subject of an
online petition calling for his job.
The petition "To fire offensive
coordinator Doug Nussmeier"
received two signatures.
But Nussmeier, 43, has plenty
of similarities to Michigan's
outgoing offensive coordinator,
Al Borges, who was fired
Wednesday. Both favor the pro-
style, downhill running game to
set up play-action and vertical
routes. Both coach the offense
and the quarterbacks.
What Nussmeier had at
Alabama, and Borges didn't at
Michigan, was an offense good
enough to quell dissent from a
fan base that demanded better
production.
In Nussmeier, Michigan
gains a coach who runs the
pro-style offense preferred by
Michigan coach Brady Hoke, a
skilled recruiter and a proven
quarterback mentor. His early
success will hinge upon the

question that flummoxed Borges
and Hoke for all of 2012: how
to succeed despite a young and
error-prone offensive line?
The early reviews are positive.
Before the Sugar Bowl, according
to Alabama's student newspaper
The Crimson White, Oklahoma
Coach Bob Stoops praised
Nussmeier and his offense.
"It's old school. It's NFL-
style football," Stoops said. "And
they come at you in a variety of
different sets, shifts, motions.
They window dress things very
well. It's very well organized. It's
very well orchestrated."
Alabama offensive lineman
Cyrus Kouandjio told the
Crimson White that everybody
loved the offensive coordinator.
"You don't see a lot of
coaches like Coach Nussmeier,"
Kouandjio said. "That's why
coach Saban hired him. And he's
livingup to it."
In Nussmeier's first year in
Tuscaloosa in 2012, the offense
set records for touchdowns (68),
points (542), total offense (6,237)
and passing touchdowns (32).
In his first game with the Crim-
son Tide, his offense dismantled
Michigan in the Cowboys Clas-

sic. Despite shutting down for
much of the second half, the
Crimson Tide won 41-14 and
put up 431 yards of total offense,
including 232 on the ground.
Under Nussmeier, the offense
opened up - at least for a Nick
Saban-coached team - when
he implemented more vertical
routes and attacked teams over
the top. The offense showed
more three- and four-receiver
sets, usually with an H-back who
could become more involved
in the passing game than a
traditional fullback.
The Alabama passing game
grew with its quarterback, AJ
McCarron. In 2011, the year
before Nussmeier arrived,
McCarron played a role largely
described as "game manager."
By 2013, according to Marc
Torrence, sports editor at The
Crimson White, McCarron
"had the greatest season as a
quarterback in Alabama history.
You have to attribute that
somewhat to Nussmeier."
At Michigan, fifth-year senior
quarterback Devin Gardner
showed potential in his first
full season at the starter, but
he committed costly turnovers

Nussmeier will inherit an offense that averaged 373.5 yards per game in 2013 and returns its startin gquarterback.

Nebrasketballin': Big Ten play continues
Behind Enemy Lines: Tim Miles

By SIMON KAUFMAN
Daily Sports Writer
Thursday night, the Michi-
gan men's basketball team will
take on Nebraska in its third
Big Ten game of the season.
Sec-
ond-year B N
coach Tim
Miles,
one of the
Big Ten's -
funniest
and most
lighthearted personalities,
is working to turn around a
Cornhusker team that was pre-
dicted to finish last in the con-
ference in a preseason media
poll. Nebraska (0-2 Big Ten, 8-6
overall) dropped its first two
conference games to Iowa and
Michigan State, both on the
road.
The Daily sat down with
Miles in October at Big Ten
media day to talk about his
return for a second season,
playing in a new stadium and
recruiting.
The Michigan Daily: With
one year under your belt, are
you a little more relaxed going
into this season?
Tim Miles: Well, I don't
know if you can ever relax
going into the Big Ten, but it's
that comforting feeling. The
unknown always worries you,
and now you know what to
expect. But being a lifelong Big
Ten fan, growing up in Big Ten
territory in South Dakota, you
knew how tough the league was
going to be and it was certainly
all that and then some.
TMD: What is the biggest
area you want to build on from
your first year?
TM: We were able to win

five league games and we were
able to win one in the (Big
Ten) tournament (in 2013). We
want to keep showing progress,
and we did it when the league
was at its most difficult. So
just steady progress, I think,
is really important to program
building, especially at a place
like Nebraska, which isn't a
traditional well-known or well-
thought-of basketball power.
In the '90s, we had a great run,
but at this point in time now, we
need to reinvent ourselves and
that's what we're doing. We've
done it with over $200 million
in new facilities that are state
of the art, and now we've got to
get the coaching up to par and
we'll be ok.
TMD: You mentioned the
brand-new stadium. How
excited are you to break it in
and how much does it help with
recruiting?
TM: It definitely helps
recruiting. It's one of those
things that I think shows
progress. It shows commit-
ment. When a recruit sees
commitment and they see how
well done it is, it's an impres-
sive thing. The other thing
that goes right on top of that
is we've sold that thing out. I
mean, we sold it out in about
a month or six weeks of time,
and so it's been sold out since
the spring or early summer for
the whole season. That mat-
ters a lot to people when you
see that sort of commitment by
your fans.
TMD: How hard is it to get a
recruit to come out to Nebras-
ka?
TM: Recruiting is always
difficult. Everybody's got it
tough - that's just part of the
business. Any business where

you're at, when you get to kind
of a certain level and especially
the top level, the competition
is more fierce and your job
becomes more difficult. You
have to find an edge and find
a way. For us, it's finding the
right kind of guys that fit and
that want to be in Nebraska for
one reason or another. Whether
they see the progress and the
development of the program
and they like that challenge,
they see their opportunity for
an impact to come play, or they
like the coaches, or whatever
it might be, we've got to find
them. Because we don't have a
large base of local recruits and
that can be a difficult thing to
overcome sometimes.
TMD: You have a pretty laid
back demeanor. How much do
you rely on your personality to
take you guys out of the Big Ten
cellar?
TM: The personality part is
probably a disorder more than
anything, so we just try to deal
with it. Certainly, the impor-
tant part about recruiting is to
let your recruits get to know
you personally, and that's one
thing -we're not (acting like)
somebody we're not. We just
try to go out and be real guys
and (tell recruits), 'This is the
way were gonna do it, and this
is our plan for you.'"
TMD: What's your goal for
this year?
TM: We want to make the
NCAA 'tournament and win
when we're there, and I've said
that for years - even when
I was at North Dakota State
and we were a Division-I inde-
pendent and ineligible for the
NCAA tournament. I think you
just have a standard, and that's
where it belongs.

Sophomore forward Nik Stauskas is leading Michigan in scoring, averaging 17.8 points per game.

'M' to challenge perfect home mark

night. TV/Radio:
Michigan ESPN2
(2-0 Big
Ten, 10-4
overall) hopes to hand the
Cornhuskers their first-ever
loss at Pinnacle Bank Arena,
which opened September 2013.
Nebraska is a perfect 7-0 there,
but the Wolverines will be the
Cornhuskers' first real challenge
in defending their home-court
advantage after playing a fairly
easy home schedule thus far.
Michigan, on the other hand,
faced a grueling non-confer-
ence schedule, including games
against three teams ranked No.
17 or higher in the AP poll.
But the Wolverines have
kicked off Big Ten play against
teams picked to finish in the bot-
tom tier of the conference. Com-
ingoffofwins against Minnesota
and Northwestern, Michigan
will put a four-game winning

streak on the line in Lincoln.
On paper, Nebraska (0-2, 8-6)
shouldn't pose much of a chal-
lenge. The Cornhuskers came
into the season ranked last in the
Big Ten preseason media poll.
But that, of course, doesn't mean
Michigan coach John Beilein is
takingthem - or their two losses
in conference play - lightly.
"They have played a very dif-
ficult schedule overall," Beilein
said in a radio interview with
WTKA-AM. "They started off
with two road games in the Big
Ten. They came out 0-2 against
two nationally ranked teams."
Those programs - Iowa and
Michigan State - downed the
Cornhuskers handily, defeating
them by 10 and 31, respectively.
But both of those games were
on the road, and Beilein knows
full well how difficult it is to win
away from home.
"They're a good team. They
added the point guard position
with a kid from New Zealand
with a lot of game experience,"
Beilein said in the interview.
"(Ray) Gallegos is an incred-
ible shooter. They added another
transfer at the wing that is their
leading scorer right now."
Nebraska's biggest threat is
sophomore Terran Petteway,
who has deservedly earned the
respect of his teammates and
opponents. The 6-foot-6 forward
leads the team with 17.3 points
per game.
Petteway - who transferred
from Texas Tech and sat out last
year - is a dual threat who has

the ability to drive to the bas-
ket or step back for a jump shot,
making him dangerous at the
shooting guard position.
. Gallegos, a fifth-year senior,
has also been productive for the
Cornhuskers, shooting nearly 40
percent from beyond the arc.
On Michigan's end, fifth-year
senior forward Jordan Morgan
and redshirt junior forward
Jon Horford have both stepped
up their play and leadership
after being handed the share
of McGary's minutes since he
opted for surgery. Beilein said
both have continued to improve
as they've gotten in better game
shape. The coach also said he
won't hesitate to use redshirt
sophomore forward Max Bielf-
eldt if either Morgan or Horford
get in foul trouble.
Beilein refuses to admit he's
expecting a victory in Lincoln.
But if the Wolverines can over-
come their road struggles to
play at a high level, they could
blemish the Cornhuskers' home
record.
"Their talent is so much bet-
ter than it was last year," Beilein
said. "(Nebraska coach Tim
Miles) did a great job with that
team last year. Now they have a
really talented team. It's going
to be one of those games where
we're going to have to play abso-
lutely our best to get a win."
NOTES: Beilein said
"everything went well" with
McGary's surgery Tuesday,
adding that the sophomore
would be back in class Thursday.

Wolverines welcome Badgers in rematch of 2013 thriller

By SHANNON LYNCH
Daily SportsEditor
In its first conference home
game of 2014, the Michigan
women's basketball team will
focus on strength, not size, to
keep its
three-
game win- Wisconsin at
ningstreak Michigan
alive, as
the Wol- Matchup:

Ten games Where: Crisler
for the sec- Arena
ond cn- TV/Radio:

season.
But that
doesn't
mean size won't still be on the
Wolverines' minds.
The Badgers pose a challenge
in terms of size for Michigan,
led by 6-foot senior guard Tay-
lor Wurtz and 6-foot-3 redshirt
junior forward Michala John-
son. Wurtz was just named Big
Ten Player of the Week and tal-
lied 27 points in Wisconsin's
overtime win over Illinois last
week, while Johnson is averag-
ing 16.1 points per game.
The Badgers have 10 players

on their roster who stand at or
above six-feet tall.
"We do feel that we are
undersized and we're smaller
than most of our opponents,"
said Michigan coach Kim
Barnes Arico.
Luckily for the Wolverines,
it's not all about height. Fresh-
man guard Siera Thompson,
who stands at just 5-foot-7, is
expected to apply pressure on
Wisconsin (8-5 overall, 1-0 Big
Ten), just like she did against
Ohio State. More importantly,
Thompson's presence has pro-
vided consistency in the Wol-
verines' lineup, which was small
and undecided to begin with.
"Her teammates have a tre-
mendous amount of trust and
confidence in her, and really
believe she can lead our team,"
Barnes Arico said. "She's a
freshman playing 37 minutes
a game for us, going against
probably the other team's best
defender, and handling that
pressure night in and night out."
Junior forward Shannon
Smith, who also stands at just
5-foot-7, will hope to pose an
offensive threat to the Badgers.
Smith has scored more than
20 points in three games this
season and is averaging 15.1
points a game. She also became
the first Wolverine to score

more than 30 points in a game
since the 2005-06 season when
she recorded 32 points against
Detroit Mercy in November.
Michigan (1-0, 10-4) looks to
ride its momentum from Sun-
day after it opened conference
play with a 64-49 win over
Ohio State in which Thompson
scored 18 points, already her
12th double-digit scoringoutput
of the young season.
The team showed off some
newfound free-throw skills,
racking up a season-high 26
makes from the charity stripe,
while shooting 92.9 percent
from the line.
"We did a great job of getting
to the free-throw line," Barnes
Arico said. "We had to handle
some pressure and need to con-
tinue to get better at that, but we
did what we needed to do to be
successful."
The Wolverines' offensive
success has stemmed from its
offensive depth. Four different
scorers are averaging double
digits, including a pair of juniors
in guard Nicole Elmblad and
forward Cyesha Goree.
Despite losing the majority of
its scorers from last season, the
Wolverines are averaging 73.7
points per game, an increase
of 13.6 points from last season.
Additionally, Michigan leads

the Big Ten with a 47.3-percent
field-goal mark, good enough,
for a No. 12 ranking nationally.
Thursday's contest will be
the first of two between Michi-
gan and the Badgers this season,
with the Wolverines hoping to
prevail like they did last year
when they won, 54-53. Wis-
consin shot 100 percent from

the free throw line, so just like
against Ohio State, it will be
important to stay out of foul
trouble throughout the game.
Wisconsin will pose a sizable
threat at Crisler, but unless its
defense can pressure the Wol-
verines into causing turnovers
and missing shots from the
line. Michigan should have the

shooting power to overcome the
Badgers and keep a perfect Big
Ten record.
NOTES: The Wolverines
lead the Big Ten in field goal
percentage (47.3 percent). ...
Michigan is averaging 74 points
per game. ... Wisconsin has
committed 50 turnovers in its
last two games.

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily
Sophomoreguard Madison Ristovski, a question mark in the preseason, averages nearly 10 points per game.

For a series as acclaimed and adored as
"Breaking Bad;" ending the story can be a
formidable undertaking. A series' victory
lap can be the difference between a wholly
satisfying legacy (see "Six Feet Under") or
an infuriating conclusion to a once-great
show ("Dexter"). For "Breaking Bad,"
Walter White's journey from Mr. Chips to
Scarface ended with the unrivaled excel-
lence and skill with which it began.
"Breaking Bad" 's final episodes were
both surprising and captivating -- eight
hours of television in its peak form. The
sixth installment, "Ozymandias," will be
remembered as one of the finest hours of

television in history.
The finale garnered 10.3 million view-
ers, up 442 percent from the previous
year's finale, capping off "Breaking Bad"
's meteoric rise from critically acclaimed
niche programming to full-blown cultural
phenomenon. "Breaking Bad"'s final eight
episodes firmly cemented its place among
the best television series of all time and
with that, the legacy of Walter White.

How much does Kanye West not give
a fuck? Let me show you right now by
cueing up the auditory assault that is
Yeezus's opening track, "On Sight.' From
projecting his face onto hundreds of
buildings worldwide for the promotion
of "New Slaves" to splitting mountains
and bringing out Jesus in arenas across
the country on his Yeezus Tour, 2013
was the year where Mr. West either
lost his goddamn mind or turned Super
Saiyan and evolved to an unprecedented
level of genius. Personally, I believe

it was both. Yeezus is the sound of
a frustrated futurist creating harsh
compositions for no one but himself.
It's innovative, infectious and evocative
- all hallmarks of great art. More
than anything, Yeezus is an album that
understands the .power of surprise.
On his sixth album, Kanye managed to
mix memorable melodies and jagged
experimentation for a captivating
40 minutes of brilliant imperfection.

Best TV Shows of 2013

HBO

2. Orange Is The New Black 3. Game of Thrones

4. Scandal

Online streaming is the new
broadcast television, Netflix is
the new prime time and orange
is the new black - orange and
cell-block grey, that is. Based
on ex-inmate Piper Kerman's
memoir of the same name,
"Orange Is the New Black" has
introduced color to a monoto-
nous TV landscape and view-
ers to the unexplored bunks
of an all-female prison: It
bares the diverse realities of
women, unmatched by even
the most righteous TV ring-

leaders (see: Ryan Murphy
and his choir of misfit toys).
In an institution where indi-
viduality is traded for uniform
jumpsuits and shackles, it's the
characters' and cast's identi-
ties - socioeconomic, racial,
religious, gender and sexual
- that swiiiiirl to form one of
the most enlightened, vulner-
able and witty scripts of the
year. For once, we're crossing
our fingers for a longer prison
sentence.
-BRIANNE JOHNSON

Westeros is a massive world.
What "Game of Thrones" does
brilliantly is that it shows us
the pieces that fill this world,
without spending too much
or too little time in one place.
The third season of "Game of
Thrones" spent quite a bit of
time allowing the show's strong
ensemble to speak with their
own voices. The best example
of this is what they did this
season with Jamie Lannister
and Brianne. There's no way to
talk about this season without

mentioning the best scene on
TV this year not from "Break-
ing Bad." "The Red Wedding"
serves as the climax for the sea-
son and for the series. The writ-
ers and actors executed it as
close to perfectly as they could
with the impact they were look-
ing for: shock, surprise and sad-
ness.
This is a large world filled
with intriguing characters that
make spending time in Wester-
os highly worth the investment.
-ALEX INTNER

After three seasons, this
political thriller on ABC still
never has a dull moment. Oliv-
ia Pope, played by the brilliant
Kerry Washington, kicks ass
and takes names, all while
maintaining flawless (mostly
white) outfits. A quick wit-
ted, calculating career woman,
Washington's character por-
trays women in a way that
many shows don't dare to - as
the political equivalent of men,
able to manipulate and control
situations with natural ease.

2013 was a great year for "Scan-
dal" and the mid-season finale
left social media ablaze with
astonishment over the unfore-
seen plot twists. Despite a lack-
luster romantic arc between
Olivia and President Fitz, this
show continues to impress.
Like the red wine constantly
in Pope's hand, "Scandal" has
aged wonderfully, and surely
2014 promises even more nail-
biting, seat-falling-off-of splen-
dor.

Best Singles of 2013

CBC

1. Kanye West 3. James Blake

5. Orphan Black

"Blood on the Leaves"

"Retrograde"

The single best performance
on TV this year came from the
star of "Orphan Black", Tatiana
Maslany ("The Vow"). Not only
does Maslany craft one compli-
cated and layered character; she
creates seven. The show follows
a group of clones, all of whom
are played by Maslany. She
provides a center to the show,
and is the primary source of its
greatness. But a show can't sur-
vive on performance alone. In
its first season, "Orphan Black"
crafts a brilliantly executed
mythology for its characters. It

manages to take an incredibly
unrealistic premise - the exis-
tence of clones - and just for a
second, makes it seem realis-
tic. It allows the science fiction
elements to develop the story
without being overbearing.
"Orphan Black" took a ridicu-
lous premise and ran with it,
creating an advanced and com-
plicated mythology. It also cast
a perfect leading actress in
Maslany. This adds up to make
it one of the best Sci-Fi shows
on TV right now.
-ALEX INTNER

In a haunting six minutes,
Kanye West manages to make
statements about racism and
fame that most artists can't
make in an entire album. "Blood
On the Leaves" wavers between
incredibly profound statements
about conspicuous consump-
tion and racism, sampling Nina
Simone's version of "Strange
Fruit," to Auto-Tuned vocals
of Kanye singing about molly.
Yet in the range between an
emotional history of American
racism and lyrics like "She Ins-

tagram herself like #BadBitch-
Alert," "Blood On the Leaves"
represents the climax of Yeezus
and quintessential Kanye West.
The song doesn't have overt
statements politically, socially,
or musically. ButKanye's repeti-
tion of"We could've been some-
body," even if he's talking about
a drug-fueled hookup, lingers.
In the same vein, "Blood On the
Leaves" stands out among the
other Yeezus tracks because it's
both complex and catchy.
-HANNAH WEINER

From its opening notes, it's
evident that "Retrograde" is
not only the standout track on
James Blake's excellent Over-
grown, but also a song capa-
ble of stirring deep emotions
and transporting the listener
to another place completely.
Blake's otherworldly hums
compliment the sparse base-
line, and his haunting falsetto
creates an atmosphere of both
beauty and melancholy. It is
rare to find a song that reso-
nates on a personal level, but

Blake paints a canvas of isola-
tion and love through his soft-
ly sung lyrics. "Retrograde"
defies any specific genre label,
and is both a tasteful example
of what modern electronic
music should sound like and
an elegant R&B song. "Ret-
rograde" will endure as one
of the most listenable songs
of 2013 for both its modern
style and its classic evocation
of emotions that anyone can
relate to.

4. Arctic Monkeys
"Do I Wanna Know"

The Arctic Monkeys' "Do I
Wanna Know?" is a downright
catchy tune. The sustained sim-
plicityofthedrummingemphasiz-
es the clean, bluesy feel the guitar
provides, creating a basic rhythm
for the songto center itself around.
The main riff is played over a few
times during the intro prior to the
introduction of the vocals, hook-
NTERSCOPE ing in the listener. Lead singer
Alex Turner's slow, almost slightly
drugged sounding vocals then add
e i a more-than-mild flair of badass to

the song in the verses. The high-
pitched backing vocals in the cho-
rus contrast Turner's lower pitch
nicely, and combined with the
groovy main guitar riff give the
song an outer spacey feel. In some
ways, this single is highly similar
in nature to many of The Clash's
notable singles like "Should I Stay
or Should Igo":while"DoIWanna
Know?" isn't some amazing musi-
cal feat, it's nonetheless a fun, out-
standingsingle.

2. "Acid Rap"
Chance The Rapper

3. "Modern Vampires of the City"
Vampire Weekend

In April, twenty-year-old Chicago native
Chance the Rapper released his mixtape Acid
Rap, which receivied an incredible amount of
downloads and critical acclaim. The album
bounces around from genre to genre, fusing
soul and jazz into succinct and unfailingly
pleasing hip-hop. Acid Rap is catchy enough to
debut at number 63 on Billboard's R&B/Hip-
Hop Albums yet weird enough to consistently
seem fresh, and Chance has found his niche in
the area between. With his bizarre screeches
and spastically high-speed verses on tracks

like "Good Ass Intro (So Good)" and "NaNa,"
Chance has established his voice as a spunky,
brilliant, and youthful rapper. Lyrically, Acid
Rap proves Chance to be thoughtful and pro-
vocative, while musically, it's sweet, fluid and
fun. With Acid Rap, Chance the Rapper has
cemented himself as an artist full of person-
ality and spunk, mature enough to wisely rap
about serious topics yet captivating enough
to keep you singing "Cocoa Butter Kisses" for
days.
-HANNAH WEINER

At first glance, Modern Vampires of the City is a
mere maturation, a dozen-song collection in which
Vampire Weekend pushes the recipe of their past
two albums - afro-tinged punk merged with literate
lyrics - to fulfillment. But for the cosmopolitan Ivy
Leaguers, previously resolved to conceal their humil-
ity beneath wit, growingup looks a whole lot like revi-
talizing, and it sounds like the indie-rock masterpiece
of 2013. Modern Vampires is a record that adorns
itself in humanity, with each track demonstrating a
willingness to experimentbut never alienate. There's
spontaneity - lead single "Diane Young" employs an

infectious digitized vocal effect reminiscent of Elvis
- and existential gloom - the penultimate track
"Hudson" imagines a post-apocalyptic New York in
which "all apartments are prewar." A somber, visceral
production propels the album forward, exquisitely
complementing Ezra Koenig's poetic musings on the
loss of faith and time. No longer intent on espousing
their wisdom, the revamped Vampires seem content
to bask in the world's shared anxieties. Barring the
foretold apocalypse, we'll be basking with this one
for years to come.

4. "Nothing Was the Same"
Drake

5. "Random Access Memories"
Daft Punk

On the swirling, Whitney Houston-manipulating
intro to his third album, Drake observes, "This is
nothin' for the radio, but they'll still play it though/
Cause it's that new Drizzy Drake, that's just the way
it go." This confidence, which has never truly been
lacking, undoubtedly shines through more than ever
on Nothing Was the Same, a contemplative, assertive
and comprehensive effort from Drake. But unlike
his last album, the excellent but exceptionally mel-
ancholy Take Care, Nothing Was the Same has some-
thing for everybody. There's vintage Drake-tinged

R&B on "Furthest Thing" and "Hold On, We're Going
Home" but also reckless party anthems like "Started
From the Bottom" and "Worst Behaviour."NWTS is a
plethora of sounds that are nonetheless held together
by Drake's complex descriptions, effortless humor
and sometimes cringe-worthy swagger. It took three
albums and a mixtape, but it seems like rap's golden
child has finally found the formula to not only com-
mercial and critical success, but, more importantly, to
personal fulfillment.
-JACKSON HOWARD

Considering Daft Punk has always sounded
like it came from the future, Random Access
Memories was an unexpected step. In 2013, a
group made famous by its electronic dance hits
gave us an album reverent of and as irresist-
ible as the nost legendary '70s disco produc-
tions. More than probably any other record
this year, Random Access Memories sounds
confusing in MP3 format. The album is more
at home on a shelf of vinyl LPs, with other
classics from the disco era. Featuring a dream

team of collaborators, Daft Punk announced
its intentions to "Give Life Back to Music"
right in the title of the first track. While
oftentimes more understated than the ubiq-
uitous, ridiculously impossible-to-get-out-of-
your-head smash single "Get Lucky" would
suggest, Random Access Memories is never
dull, always engaging, and proves that, some-
times, the best innovation is born out of look-
ing to the past.

Games
of 2012,

2. "The Last of Us"

3. "Grand Theft Auto V"

"The Last-of Us," a PS3 exclu-
sive game, is a true winner in
every department: graphics,
story, characters and gameplay.
The game takes place in 2033,
where the world has been com-
pletely changed after an infec-
tion unleashed an apocalypse.
The player takes control of Joel,
a young man who must transport
the game's other main character,
Ellie, across the increasingly dan-
gerous landscape of the United
States. Along the way, the player
must not only fight off infected

mutants and desperate survivors,
but also face difficult ethical deci-
sions that make this game much
more than just mindless enter-
tainment. The aforementioned
graphics make the entire story
even more riveting and impactful,
while careful writing and voice
work fully flesh out these people
as they struggle to retain a sense
of hope and trust in each other.
This isn't really a game as much
as it is an experience; one that
shouldn't be missed out on.

1. "BioShock: Infinite"

Given enough time, every
medium has its moment of
transcendence. It took tele-
vision decades to reach its
"Golden Age," and many still
believe its true "Golden Age"
is yet to come. Video games are
no different. The once reviled
medium still has a lot to learn,
but if "Bioshock: Infinite" is a
preview for things to come, it
looks like gainers are in pretty
good hands. Using the conven-
tions of video games to explore
violence, free will and the fal-
lacies of American exception-
alism, "Bioshock: Infinite" is

a cultural marker for just how
far we've traveled since the
quarter slinging days of the
arcade. It's a story we've seen a
thousand times: the seemingly
stalwart hero must travel to
the mythical kingdom to defeat
the monster and save the prin-
cess from the castle. Instead, in
"Bioshock: Infinite," the story
of Booker DeWitt, Elizabeth
and the floating city of Colum-
bia become a heartbreaking
examination of American his-
tory, both of the past and years
to come.
-DREW MARON

"Pokemon X & Y" marks
another successful return to the
Pokemon franchise by Nintendo.
Though this new generation has
many of the same game elements
that helped make Pokemon into a
classic, the introduction of the new
Fairy type, "Mega Evolutions," and
69 new Pokemon made it so that
all fans, new and old, could have
something to enjoy. Meanwhile, X
& Y replaces 2D sprites with new
3D models for the Pokamon, allow-
ing players to experience a hand-

held Pokmon game in an entirely
new way. The game is no slouch
in the multiplayer department
either, with Wi-Fi capabilities that
improve upon the features of pre-
vious generations, making battling
and trading with others easier than
ever before. The balance between
new and old here is what made
"Pokdmon X & Y" one of the best
video games of 2013, but it's hard
to go wrong with Pokdmon's well-
established winning formula.

3. "American Hustle"
The camera focuses in on a bulbous, Santa Claus bent on ending political corruption and getting the
belly sticking out over 1970s swim trucks. The shot glory he craves. The film questions the meaning of

Best Film Characters of 2013

FOX SEARCHLIGHT
1. Solomon Northrup
The most emotionally intense scene
in film this year involves only a man, a
rope and a weeping willow tree. We see
Solomon Northup as he dangles from
the tree, his scrabbling toes in the
mud the only things dividing him and
death. He hangs there for hours, as the
plantation awakens behind him and
slaves leave their huts, averting their
eyes from the painful sight. Chiwetel
Ejiofor as Northup leaves an indelible
mark on the way we view slavery, not
as an'institutional but a-deeply person-
al experience.
He is not a glossy symbol nor a mini-
mizing caricature - he's not even an
indefatigable hero. Northup is a man
with depth and strength, and as his
twelve years unravel we finally see
slavery not just through the eyes of a
slave, but the eyes of a person tested
to his limit. Even when he almost cracks
- voice shaking and eyes gleaming - he
embodies strength and humanity in ways
that transcend any of our past assump-
tions of what a "slave" is.
-NATALIE GADBOIS

2. Mud
Of all of his roles this year, Matthew
McConaughey's turn as Mud might be
his finest A supporting role despite
being the titular character, Mud.is at
once mysterious, devoted and venge-
ful while subtly revealing a dam-
aged heart, a heart which he wears
on his sleeve next to the snake tattoo
wrapped around his arm.
Mud expresses a certain bravado,
a larger-than-life mentality where
love is all you need, specifically the
love of Juniper, his soulmate since
childhood. But this bravado and
attitude blinds him to the fact he has
lived his life for a woman who does
not reciprocate his feelings, going so
far as to kill a man for her. Yet, Mud
stands for something bolder, greater:
American romanticism itself. Pas-
sionate to a fault, unyielding, troubled
and timeless, Mud is an evocation of
Mark Twain and of Hemingway, a
figure that stands proudly in the ever-
expanding pantheon of American
folklore heroes.

PARAMOUNT COLUMBIA
3. Jordan Belfort 4. Rosalyn Rosenfeld

I know that I'm supposed to detest
Jordan Belfort with every fiber of my
being. He's corrupt, smug, manipula-
tive, drug-fueled and cocky. He ruins
the lives of working class Americans
and is proud of it. But I just can't look
away - Leonardo DiCaprio's Belfort
just has this way about him. You hang
onto his every word, every wink and
every howl.
Whether that charisma comes from
his "take what I want" mentality or
from the sheer hilarity of his wild she-
nanigans doesn't really matter. Much
like his excessive cocaine and quaalu-
des use, you're hooked, and you're dis-
gusted by it, by Belfort, by the whole
Wall Street culture that thrives under
our noses. It's no secret that the FBI.
catches Belfort for a number of charg-
es, including stock manipulation and
insider trading. At the film's end, sure,
I was glad this prick got his (sort of)
comeuppance, but I also was a bit upset
the party was over; that's the genius of
Jordan Belfort.

Jennifer Lawrence's show stealing
performance as the train-wreck wife
of con man Irving Rosenfeld proves yet
again Lawrence's acting prowess and
America's obsession with hopelessly
dysfunctional people. Rosalyn's manic-
depressive mood swings switch emotional
tracks like a comprehensive list of emoti-
cons. One of her most iconic moments
spawned demand for a gif that allows end-
lessviewingofher furioushousecleaning/
dance combo routine to the tune of Paul
McCartney's "Live and Let Die." Or what
about that eyebrow raising, cold shower
inducing encounter between her and
Amy Adams's character? Rosalyn's antics
both humor and infuriate audience mem-
bers while keeping everyone asking - is
she just insane or, somewhere in all that
deception and self-deception, does she
know exactly what she's doing? As Irving
himself observes, "She was the Picasso of
passive-aggressive karate. She was bet-
ter than any other con artist I've ever met
including myself. And she had me like
nobody had me."
-KARSTEN SMOLINSKI

5. P.L. Travers
P.L. Travers doesn't write for
fame nor does she write for money.
With a dying alcoholic father, an
unloving mother and a world of
isolation, Travers' childhood is
filled with demons of emotion
and sensibility, and writing about
them helps her to safely exercise
her anxieties. Her stories incor-
porate many of the important
figures from her adolescence, as
she grows to understand them
better through writing and learns
to cherish them - both good and
bad - for the roles they shared in
shaping her person.
Travers becomes truly admi-
rable, however, when she surren-
ders her characters to the world,
as she comes to understand just
how cherished they are in the
shaping of others. In this way,
she demonstrates the same empa-
thy as that of her treasured char-
acters. She becomes the hero of
her own story.
