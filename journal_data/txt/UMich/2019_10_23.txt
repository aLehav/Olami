In 2019, a record high of 
22 startups spun out of the 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 
Office 
of 
Technology 
Transfer, a unit responsible 
for the commercialization of 
U-M research. The number 
represents the most startups 
to come out of the University 
in a year and covers a 
wide range of industries, 
from 
circadian 
rhythm 
management and artificial 
intelligence video analytics 
to medicine and car safety. 
Kelly 
Sexton, 
associate 
vice president for research 
at the technology transfer 
and innovation partnerships 
at the University, said she 
expects this trend of success 
to continue going forward.
“It was a record number, 
record year for startups,” 
Sexton said. “We think that’s 

probably going to be the new 
normal. All of the increased 
activity, it’s really around 
faculty interest and seeing 
the results of their research 
have 
an 
impact 
beyond 
campus.” 
Regarding the contribution 
of faculty members, Sexton 
explained the University’s 
support system for business 
ventures. 
“The 
fact 
that 
they 
continue, year over year, to 
send us their ideas, to entrust 
us with their technologies, 
with their discoveries, shows 
that we’re headed in the right 
direction,” Sexton. “We’re 
providing the right resources 
to support our faculty.”
Students and faculty from a 
variety of departments added 
to the University’s existing 
business portfolio, focusing 
on applying technology in 
a 
more 
interdisciplinary 
manner. 

About 
60 
people 
were 
in 
attendance 
for 
a 
2020 
Presidential 
Debate 
Town 
Hall hosted by the University 
of Michigan’s Central Student 
Government Tuesday evening. 
After the announcement the 
University 
will 
be 
hosting 
a 
Presidential 
debate 
next 
fall, event organizers gave a 

presentation 
and 
answered 
student 
questions 
regarding 
campus safety, venues, tickets, 
campus climate and more. 
Venue and seats
The 
Commission 
on 
Presidential Debates determined 
the University will be hosting 
the third Presidential debate on 
Oct. 15, 2020. According to Ann 
Zalucki, operations co-lead of the 
2020 Debate Initiative, the third 
debate is traditionally the town 
hall formatted event. This means 

community members would be 
allowed to ask the candidates 
questions directly throughout 
the event.
Despite a capacity of 13,000 in 
the Crisler Center, Zalucki said 
the debate hall will only host 
800-1000 people.
“This is a studio, its meant to 
be viewed on TV,” Zalucki said. 
“Crisler is a gigantic venue, it 
is a 10,000-person venue. The 
size of the venue is not the size 
that we’re going to fill. You’ll 

notice the seating size, a 10,000 
venue, we are looking at roughly 
800-1000 seats that participate 
in this viewing pleasure. But 
again, that is not meant to be 
all housed, it is meant to be 
viewed.”
According to Zalucki, only 
about 
100-200 
tickets 
will 
be given to the University 
of Michigan to distribute to 
students and no tickets will be 
sold.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

University 
of 
Michigan 
Central Student Government 
discussed 
the 
University’s 
decision 
to 
host 
the 
2020 
presidential debate, differences 
in Advanced Placement and 
International 
Baccalaureate 
credits within LSA and the 

search for a new vice president 
of Student Life during their 
weekly meeting Tuesday night.
The meeting began with 
a 
visit 
from 
Alex 
Ramer, 
president of Be the Match 
On Campus, an organization 
which urges students to join 
a registry of potential blood 
stem cell donors. If such donors 
are then matched to a patient, 
their blood marrow transplant 

can cure blood diseases such 
as leukemia, lymphoma and 
immunodeficiency disorders. 
Ramer 
shared 
while 
Caucasians have a 77-percent 
chance of finding a match from 
the registry, African Americans 
have only about a 23-percent 
chance.
“We’re trying to get as 
many people on the registry as 
possible, but being a minority 

plays a huge role in your chance 
for finding a match,” Ramer 
said. “I would love for you to 
encourage other people to join 
the registry so that we can close 
this minority gap.” 
Following 
this, 
two 
representatives 
from 
the 
Sexual Assault Prevention and 
Awareness 
Center 
provided 
bystander intervention training. 

Located 
between 
the 
entrances 
of 
Bivouac 
and 
Ashley’s on State Street, the 
Arbor Vitae Loft is a six-person 
co-op aiming to provide a 
counterculture 
safe 
space 
for live music, community 
activism 
and 
do-it-yourself 
art.
Amid high beamed ceilings 
and 
walls 
stacked 
with 
records, LSA senior Tegwyn 
John, an advocate for the 
property, explained its rich 
historical role to The Daily. 
Arbor Vitae, John said, has 
long been seen as a symbol for 
creativity and self-expression 
in the Ann Arbor community.
Arbor Vitae’s history dates 
back to the 1800s. Over the 
years, it has functioned as 
a speakeasy, corset factory, 
dance hall and even mini-golf 
course. In 1962, Ann Arbor 
resident, traveler and architect 
Rich 
Ahern 
purchased 
it, 
and converted the loft into a 
community living space. John 
explained the eccentric nature 
of the loft is reminiscent of 
Ahern. 
“He was so multifaceted,” 
John said.

The University of Michigan’s 
Office for Diversity, Equity & 
Inclusion held a panel Tuesday 
evening in collaboration with the 
Center for Campus Involvement, 
Student 
Life 
and 
the 
Islamophobia Working Group 
to discuss respecting religious 
identities. 
The 
University 
launched 
its 
five-year 
DEI 
Strategic Plan in 2016 to foster 
a more diverse and equitable 
campus for students, faculty and 
staff. 
According to the 2016 Student 
Campus 
Climate 
Survey 
on 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, 
38.4 percent of students are non-
religious. 
Samer Ali, associate professor 
of Middle East studies and chair 
of the Islamophobia Working 
Group, introduced the event 
by admitting faith is often left 
out of DEI conversations, and 
emphasizing the importance of 
fostering 
open 
conversations 
about religion, especially at a 
secular university funded by 
public taxpayer dollars. 
Although 
the 
University 
is growing in diversity and 
working to make the campus 
more equitable, there are still 
broader, national issues affecting 
campus, Ali explained.

The 
international 
studies 
major, run by the University 
of 
Michigan 
Program 
in 
International and Comparative 
Studies, is celebrating its 10th 
anniversary.
In 2005, the Center for 
International and Comparative 
Studies 
was 
founded 
by 
Professor 
Ken 
Kollman. 
The 
minor 
in 
international 
studies was created to provide 
undergraduate 
students 
an 
interdisciplinary, 
globally 
focused course of study.
Due to the minor’s success, 
the major was created in 2009. 
Students enrolled in the major 
can select one of four sub-plans: 
international security, norms 
and 
cooperation; 
political 
economy 
and 
development; 
comparative 
culture 
and 

identity; and global environment 
and health. Kollman said the 
major was created based on the 
requirements for the minor.
“It started very small, but 
it’s become a really important 
program on campus,” Kollman 
said. “It’s very much engaged 
in student experiential learning 
and tries to encourage students 
to go places, study abroad and 
learn languages, but also to 
think about things in a very 
intelligent, structured way.”
As soon as the major was 
announced it became popular, 
quickly 
reaching 
over 
700 
students, according to Robert 
Franzese, 
director 
of 
the 
program in international and 
comparative studies. Currently, 
the international studies major 
is the eighth largest within LSA. 
Franzese said the major was 
created to give undergraduate 
students a global background. 

The Center for International 
and 
Comparative 
Studies 
was renamed the Program in 
International and Comparative 
Studies to better align with 
its 
mission 
of 
providing 
undergraduates 
with 
an 
internationally 
focused 
education.
While other majors with 
some overlap in areas of study, 
such as public health and public 
policy, began springing up after 
the major’s creation, Franzese 
said international studies is 
unique because of its focus 
on understanding large-scale 
issues and intersections within 
different areas of study.
“The students are primarily 
driven by this problem that they 
want to understand and begin 
to do something,” Franzese 
said. “They’ll want to learn 
from the disciplines, what they 
can take from the disciplines 
to 
understand 
the 
problem, and understand 
what might be the start 
of certain solutions. So, 
sometimes I would say that 
the international studies 
student is not interested 
in the substantive realm 
of politics, per se, they’re 
interested in the realm of 
a particular problem or 
dynamic 
that 
challenges 
them.”
The major is assembled 
from 
courses 
across 
numerous 
departments, 
with two core lecturers 
teaching the only three 
International 
Studies 
courses — an introductory 
course, intermediate course 
with offerings based on 
subplan and an advanced 
seminar. 
The 
students’ 
other 
coursework 
is 
composed of courses from 
across 
the 
University’s 
schools and departments.
Because the coursework 
is 
pulled 
from 
many 
departments, Kollman said 
students graduate with a 
strong understanding of the 

various disciplines that play a 
role in studying international 
issues.
“Good disciplinary training 
makes good interdisciplinary 
training,” 
Kollman 
said. 
“Students are getting a number 
of skills, but also a kind of 
grounding in some of the core 
social science disciplines.”
Nataša Gruden-Alajbegovic, 
global 
projects 
manager 
at 
the University’s International 
Institute, 
said 
creating 
a 
curriculum based on course 
availability is a challenge for 
program faculty. But she said 
the ability to pull from a wide 
range of courses, paired with 
the opportunity to select a sub-
major that more aligns with each 
student’s interests, contributes 
to the major’s opportunities for 
personalization.
Gruden-Alajbegovic 
said 
there is a pre-approved list of 
more than 400 courses which 
satisfy 
International 
Studies 
requirements 
offered 
each 
semester. She said there is also 
an option for students to come 
to advisers and request a course 
not already on the list be added.
“Interdisciplinary is a very 
key word,” Gruden-Alajbegovic 
said. “It’s almost like putting 
together your own major with 
different disciplines that you 
decide to focus on.”
Franzese 
said 
putting 
together the coursework is an 
administrative challenge each 
semester, but there is never 
a shortage of courses being 
taught among the schools and 
departments at the University.
There is also a third-year 
language requirement, which 
goes two semesters beyond 
the 
four-semester 
language 
requirement in LSA. This can 
also be fulfilled by a student 
taking four semesters of one 
language and two semesters in a 
second language.

Public Favors Impeachment for President Nixon

October 23, 1973
WASHINGTON – Demands 
for impeachment of President 
Nixon 
or 
his 
resignation 
mounted 
yesterday 
in 
Washington as a scientific 
poll showed a thin plurality 
of 
Americans 
favoring 
impeachment.
NBC News said the poll 
showed 44 per cent in favor 
of impeachment, 43 percent 
opposed 
and 
13 
percent 
undecided. The Oliver Quayle 
organization contacted nearly 
1,000 persons for the poll.
THE POLL was initiated 
after 
Nixon 
fired 
special 
Watergate 
prosecutor 

Archibald Cox. It showed 75 
per cent of those questioned 
opposed to that action, 16 
percent 
approved 
and 
9 
percent undecided, NBC said.
The network said that 48 
per cent of those questioned 
since Saturday night believe 
Nixon should step aside “and 
let someone else run the 
country,” while 43 per cent 
said he should not resign and 9 
per cent were undecided.
MEANWHILE, 
the 
new 
acting 
attorney 
general 
pledged vigorous pursuit of 
the Watergate investigation. 
House Speaker Carl Albert 
and 
other 
congressional, 

leaders 
worked 
on 
plans 
for how to proceed with 
impeachment 
resolutions 
promised by angry members 
in the wake of Nixon’s firing 
Saturday 
night 
of 
special 
Watergate 
prosecutor 
Archibald Cox. 
Nixon, first at the White 
House 
and 
then 
at 
his 
Camp David, Md., retreat, 
considered using a televised 
speech to present his side of 
the case to the nation. 
U.S. SOLICITOR General 
Robert Bork said the staff and 
evidence assembled by Cox 
would be used to pursue the 
Watergate probe. Bork became 

acting attorney general when 
Atty. Gen. Elliot Richardson 
quit and Deputy Atty. Gen. 
William 
Ruckelshaus 
was 
dismissed Saturday night over 
Cox’s firing.
He put the investigation 
under 
the 
supervision 
of 
Henry Petersen, the assistant 
attorney general in charge of 
the criminal division. Bork 
said 
he 
retains 
“ultimate 
authority and responsibility” 
for the investigation. When 
Nixon fired Cox, he also 
abolished 
the 
office 
of 
special prosecutor, which had 
handled the case since May.
WHILE WHITE HOUSE 

aides sought to mollify critical 
senators 
and 
congressmen 
with explanations of Nixon’s 
action, 
criticism 
of 
the 
move continued to pile up-a 
significant amount of it from 
Republicans.
The 
AFL-CIO’s 
national 
convention in Miami Beach, 
Fla., shouted approval to a 
resolution calling for Nixon to 
resign or be impeached if he 
didn’t.
Sen. 
Daniel 
Inouye 
(D-Hawaii), a member of the 
Senate Watergate committee, 
told the convention Nixon 
should 
resign 
because 
Americans 
“have 
suffered 

enough” and “must be spared 
this new pain and trauma.”
THE 
PUBLIC 
flooded 
Western Union with telegrams 
to Washington. Some 8,000 
were sent to Cox’s former 
office. A new Gallop Poll 
taken before Saturday’s events 
showed Nixon’s confidence 
rating with the public at a new 
low.
The 
president 
of 
the 
American 
Bar 
Association 
urged Congress to reestablish 
the 
office 
of 
the 
special 
prosecutor, a move a number of 
senators and representatives 
also advocated.

“He traveled the world a 
couple times on tours of inner-
Asia — Afghanistan, Pakistan, 
in 1952 you know, when people 
weren’t doing that … He was 
trained as an architect at MIT 
in Mechanical Engineering, 
worked as an architect and 
community 
planner 
but 
his passion was drawing — 
drawing buildings and arts, 
and his life mission was to 
advocate for world peace.”
Since taking ownership of 
the space, Ahern has hosted 
bands, artistic performances, 
political organizing meetings 
and event lectures at Arbor 
Vitae. In advocating for world 
peace, Ahern was the first 
person to invite the Dalai Lama 
to Ann Arbor. John, a Buddhist, 
explains her connection to the 
loft is largely due to its role as a 
safe space for all religions.
“Part of the reason why I 
feel connected to this space 
is 
because 
I 
am 
Tibetan 
Buddhist,” John said. “So, 
a huge part of my personal 
identity, I feel I kind of owe 
to this place and to Rich 
for literally making a place 
for 
these, 
non-traditional, 
countercultural thoughts to be 
talked about and discussed. “
Now, almost half a century 
later, 
Arbor 
Vitae 
is 
in 
danger of being shut down as 
several aspects of the loft’s 
infrastructure have not met 
building 
code 
standards 
established by the state. John 
said when Ahern converted 
the loft into a living space, 
his 
relationship 
with 
the 
property owners allowed the 
lack of infrastructure to go 
unaddressed. Yet, after the 
shift in property management 
to 
Oxford 
Companies 
and 
Ahern’s death in 2004, the 

building 
has 
come 
under 
scrutiny. 
“(Arbor Vitae) was based 
on Rich’s own communication 
power, 
after 
he 
died, 
people who lived here were 
intimidated 
by 
the 
city 
and 
property 
management 
companies and felt less and 
less agency to advocate for this 
place,” John said. “And that’s 
part of why it’s so under the 
radar now … tenants have kind 
of shrunk and tried to hide.”
Earlier this year, as the 
tenants were attempting to 
negotiate a new lease, the new 
management company ordered 
an inspection on the loft. Arbor 
Vitae’s facilities failed to meet 
building code standards on 
infrastructure such as internal 
heating. 
“Oxford 
is 
the 
property 
management 
company, 
the 
people here were working 
to get a new lease, and a city 
inspection happened during 
that process,” John said. “They 
came in, and I think it was an 
inspector, and they threw the 
book at the place. Which is 
kind of understandable.” 
The 
residents 
promptly 
received an eviction notice on 
Aug. 27. Lizy Michealson, a 
current resident of Arbor Vitae 
and University of Michigan 
alum, felt a sense of loss at the 
thought of losing Arbor Vitae. 
“When we first found out, 
it was just in a very emotional 
stage,” 
Michealson 
said. 
“Essentially, we felt this very 
intense loss … A lot of things 
have changed in Ann Arbor 
and the entire world, and this 
place has been a witness to 
that.”
The 
Daily 
reached 
out 
to 
Oxford 
Companies 
for 
comment but did not receive 
a 
response 
in 
time 
for 
publication. 
LSA 
junior 
Solomon 
Medintz said saving Arbor 

Vitae is important for the Ann 
Arbor community because of 
both its rich history and also 
because of its affordability.
“Arbor 
Vitae 
has 
this 
amazing history of community 
space 
and 
organizing 
and 
art,” Menenditz said. “So 
many amazing conversations 
and meetings have happened 
there. That space should be 
preserved. (Arbor Vitae is) 
one of the only affordable 
options — housing options — 
on our campus, and I think we 
should be preserving all of the 
affordable housing options we 
can.”
In the face of complete 
shut-down, 
community 
activists and tenants rallied 
around the issue. On Sept. 
3, a GoFundMe page was 
created to save the loft. The 
proceeds would go to possible 
renovations, 
preserving 
Ahern’s 
memorabilia. 
At 
the time of publication, the 
page had raised a little over 
$4,000, almost a fourth of its 
fundraising goal of $20,000. 
John described her sense 
of urgency in saving the loft 
because it is one of the only 
counter-culture spaces left in 
Ann Arbor.
“I mean if this place goes, 
it’s the last nail in the coffin 
of Ann Arbor turning into a 
neo-liberal hell-hole,” John 
said. “From my perspective 
as a townie, this is the secret 
beating heart of Ann Arbor.”
Michealson 
reflected 
on 
why she is fighting to keep the 
Arbor Vitae alive.
“This place is like our family 
member,” 
Michealson 
said. 
“You don’t let your family 
member go. You fight for them. 
You make sure that they can 
stay and be healthy and impact 
other people’s lives.”

The 
training 
included 
defining 
sexual 
assault, 
consent, 
coercion 
and 
the 
nuances within each of these 
topics. They then discussed 
intervention strategies using 
different scenarios to display 
how to enact these strategies. 
CSG President and Ford 
junior Ben Gerstein’s report 
included 
planning 
for 
the 
upcoming 2020 presidential 
debate to be hosted at the 
University. Gerstein discussed 
the importance of ensuring 
the environment around the 
debate is safe and inclusive for 
all students. 
“A couple of things to be 
cognizant 
of 
in 
discussing 
this debate is this experience 
is an exciting opportunity to 
engage in history but then 
it’s also an experience that 
brings 
legitimate 
concerns 

on campus,” Gerstein said. “I 
think we all recognize what 
the divisive climate of the 2020 
election is, the potential for that 
to encompass several weeks 
of the campus experience and 
our students is important to be 
reminded of.”
Gerstein, who is a student 
representative on the 2020 
presidential debate planning 
committee, said he will work 
to 
ensure 
the 
committee 
understands student concerns. 
The first town hall meeting 
regarding the upcoming debate 
was held this Tuesday. The 
second will be held next Wed. 
Oct. 30.
Gerstein also discussed the 
upcoming 
Giving 
Blueday, 
a fundraiser for University 
student 
organizations 
held 
December 3. This year, CSG 
will be fundraising for the 
Leadership 
Engagement 
Scholarship, 
a 
scholarship 
created by CSG with the goal 
of 
providing 
assistance 
to 

students who face financial 
barriers to pursuing leadership 
positions at the University. 
Gerstein 
emphasized 
this 
stipend will benefit students 
hoping to take on leadership 
positions 
in 
organizations 
across campus, rather than just 
CSG.
LSA 
sophomore 
Sam 
Braden discussed a project 
focused on the LSA Advanced 
Placement and International 
Baccalaureate 
policies 

regarding class credit. 
“LSA is not only the only 
school at Michigan that treats 
AP and IB policy differently. 
It’s also the only university 
in 
America 
where 
this 
happens,” Braden said. “I met 
with (Director of Academic 
Standards 
and 
Academic 
Opportunities) Conway-Perrin 
and she agreed this change 
needs to happen.”

“The CDP, not the University, 
controls the tickets U-M is 
going to receive,” ” Zalucki said. 
LSA freshman Daeveonna 
Middleton 
said 
she 
was 
disappointed by the low number 
of tickets being given to the 
University.
“I know they said something 
about how 1,000 students could 
help volunteer for events, but 
that’s 
not 
guaranteeing 
us 
from being able to go there 
and working directly with the 
debate,” 
Middleton 
said. 
“I 
was kind of disappointed, but 
I also have to realize this is an 
international event. But I wish 
there was more opportunity for 
students to be able to experience 
this because it’s kind of like a 
once in a lifetime thing.”
Student involvement 
According to Dean of Students 
Laura Blake Jones, there will 
be various student engagement 
volunteer positions surrounding 
democratic 
engagement, 
programming, campus climate, 
safety and student activism. The 
event staff volunteers will work 
in the coming months to help 
prepare for the debate.
Jones also said students can 
attend the next Presidential 
Debate 
Town 
Hall 
next 
Wednesday, Oct. 30, to sign 
up for the various engagement 
teams and get involved.
“I would imagine that this is 
going to continue to evolve, and 
in the next town hall meeting 
that 
we’re 
holding 
on 
the 
30th, when we get into groups, 
specifically, those of you that do 
want to come back to the next 
meeting and want to actually 
engage and be a volunteer can 
start working in these areas,” 
Jones said. “There are five 
major areas of involvement, and 
there’s overlap and connections 
between the five areas.”
Campus accommodation
According to Zalucki, the 
University 
is 
preparing 
to 
accommodate 
up 
to 
5,000 
different members of national 
media and says students should 
anticipate having the option to 
interact with media entities as 
the debate draws near.
“We’re going to have about 
1,000 to 3,000, up to 5,000 
different media center media 
entities from around the world,” 
Zalucki 
said. 
“That’s 
huge. 
A 40,000 square foot tent is 
gigantic, and we are ready to 

host such a large event because 
that means they’re going to also 
be on campus talking to all of 
you. We give you opportunities 
that you wouldn’t have every 
day.”
Zalucki said it will be the 
equivalent 
to 
six 
College 
Game Day stages placed in the 
Ingalls Mall area in order to 
accommodate the major media 
networks prior to the event.
“Think when ESPN is here 
for game day, just multiply that 
by six,” Zalucki said. “And I’m 
sure all the excitement… (will 
lead to) smaller pop ups from 
some sort of social media sites as 
well. So, the media presence on 
campus for those four days will 
be quite extraordinary and a real 
opportunity for student voices to 
be heard.”
Campus services
When asked about how the 
debate will impact on-campus 
services, Jones compared the 
shift in operations to hosting 
another special event, like a 
large football game, and said 
the University will strategically 
assign tasks to make sure campus 
services remain functional.
“We’re being very strategic 
about who is going to be involved 
with which things related to the 
debate,” Jones said. “When we 
know we have a football game, 
the hospital steps up in ways 
that are very different than our 
normal operation, so that we can 
anticipate and plan for medical 
emergencies 
that 
might 
be 
affiliated with that. So, I would 
imagine in many of our areas, 
we’re going to do the same sort 
of planning to step up and be 
ready.”
Zalucki said the University 
will also be bringing in outside 
vendors to assist with day-to-
day operations and facilities on 
campus.
“We are also bringing in 
any types of vendors who do 
this regularly,” Zalucki said. 
“On a regular basis, you want 
to go to school, you want to be 
fed, you want the lights on and 
you want to get internet. As we 
start to ramp up, there will be 
improvements and resources 
just to supply and support these 
types of activities on campus, 
so your internet won’t fall 
down, things like that, we are 
anticipating.”
Carver said arrangements 
are being made to ensure 
faculty who are helping plan the 
debate, particularly on the core 
team, will have replacements or 
ways of ensuring academics and 
normal course curriculum are 

not falling behind.
“From a curriculum and 
other management standpoint, 
everybody that has been pulled 
on to the core team, for example, 
you know, there’s a recognition 
that the person is not doing 
their regular job and steps are 
being made to take care of that,” 
Carver said.
Business 
freshman 
Karma 
Karira 
said 
she 
is 
most 
concerned 
about 
the 
functionality 
of 
student 
facilities during debate week.
“The most pressing issue to 
me was how it would intrude 
on my ability to be a student 
on campus,” Karira said. “The 
resources that are still available 
to students and how that’s 
separated from the presidential 
debate, and, just in general, I 
pay for going on those busses 
and having those study spaces, 
so those concerns are most 
pressing.”
Student safety and well-
being 
When asked about student 
health and well-being, Jones 
said 
student 
involvement, 
particularly 
from 
the 
engagement volunteer teams, 
will be critical in ensuring the 
students’ needs are met.
“So, I think I sort of started 
to talk about in terms of 
anticipating the needs of our 
students and student life,” Jones 
said. “That group is focused on 
campus climate and safety and 
well-being. But we might be 
thinking from administrative 
perspective, what can we do? 
How can we staff up availability 
of counselors and CAPS for 
example, right? But (students) 
may have other very tangible 
ideas about what we could 
be doing, and so that’s where 
(student) input is going to be 
really, really important.”
According 
to 
John 
Seto, 
Division of Public Safety and 
Security 
deputy 
director, 
there will be an increased 
security 
presence 
around 
campus buildings as the debate 
approaches to ensure the safety 
of students and faculty.
“Is it going to bring out some 
new challenges? Absolutely,” 
Seto said. “But I am here to 
tell you that based on the 
foundation that we built and 
the partnerships that we’ve 
built, I’m very confident that we 
can provide that safe and secure 
environment, right.”

One of the new companies, 
Applied Morphomics Inc., was 
founded by University faculty 
member and surgeon Stewart 
Wang to collect and apply CT 
scan biological data. 
“A CT scan is basically a 
three-dimensional, 
digital 
record of a person’s body, 
and there’s a huge amount of 
information in there,” Wang 
said. “We developed a very 
rigorous system of anatomic 
indexing to go through and 
separate out all the body 
parts, label them and use that 
annotated ground truth.”
Wang elaborated on the 
initial automotive application 
of his technology and the 
shift in focus to Applied 
Morphomics’s 
current 
goal 
of 
improved, 
personalized 
patient care. 
“The data I produce in my 
laboratory is used to produce 
the virtual crash dummies 
that the automotive industry 
uses,” Wang said. “If I’m asked 
to treat you or another person, 
if I can somehow understand 
what their body came from 
and has been through in 
the current condition, I can 
be a much better doctor … 
What we do is we go and we 
extract actionable data from 
each patient’s body using this 
medical imaging.”
Another 
interdisciplinary 
startup 
is 
Arcascope, 
a 
digital 
application 
created 
by 
research 
fellow 
Olivia 
Walch 
to 
help 
individuals 
correct disruptions in their 
circadian 
sleep 
rhythms. 
Walch initially created the app 
while pursuing her Ph.D. in 
mathematics, using research 
to help travelers adjust to time 
differences. 
“A lot of factors can affect 
your 
circadian 
clock, 
but 
the very first one and the 

most important is still light 
exposure,” Walch said. “You 
can adjust faster if you get 
light at the right time and, sort 
of equally importantly, you 
avoid it at the wrong times.”
Walch spoke on her work 
modifying the initial idea to 
be more user-oriented and 
practical in its function to help 
everybody, not just travelers. 
“I just started working on 
the problem myself from the 
perspective of how to make 
the math work better for real 
people,” Walch said. “What 
we do now is just that, using 
math to help people expose 
themselves to light and take 
action steps to help them live 
better.”
Walch 
said 
her 
current 
focus is on finding ways to 
implement their technology to 
help cancer patients strategize 
the best times for treatment. 
“(A) place it could be useful 
is helping people time when 
they should take medicine,” 
Walch said. “Because your 
body changes over the course 
of 
the 
day, 
it 
prioritizes 
healing and metabolism and 
immune response at different 
times.”
A sizable portion of the 
University’s portfolio this year 
was composed of tech startups 
like Voxel51, co-founded by 
computer science professor 
Jason Corso.
“My 
group 
focuses 
on 
research 
related 
to 
video 
understanding, and this is 
somewhat unique in the world 
of computer vision where most 
people tend to focus on just 
like 
image 
understanding, 
image 
recognition,” 
Corso 
said. 
Corso 
explained 
the 
process 
of 
building 
his 
startup independently and the 
decision to incorporate the 
University in the business. 
“When 
we 
began, 
we 
were 
completely, 
sort 
of, 
divorced from the University,” 
Corso said. “There’s a lot 

of 
mentoring 
and 
strong 
experience that the University 
brings as well as a good 
network of marketing and so 
on, so we felt it was the right 
thing to do to really reengage, 
and 
so 
we 
actually 
did 
ultimately form a relationship 
with the University.”
Wang also described the 
integral role the University 
played 
in 
facilitating 
the 
creation 
of 
Applied 
Morphomics by licensing back 
his intellectual property.
“When I talked to (the 
University) 
about 
what 
I 
wanted 
the 
technology 
to 
do, what I was hoping that it 
would be able to do out in the 
real world, they worked very 
hard with me to figure out a 
way to arrange this,” Wang.
Arcascope 
also 
was 
developed with the help of 
the 
University’s 
resources, 
according the Olivia Walch. 
“This 
is 
very 
much 
a 
company that’s been incubated 
at Michigan, took its first 
steps with Michigan holding 
its hand,” Walch said. “They 
could’ve, in 2014, come in 
and been like, ‘We own the 
technology, so we’re going to 
do whatever we want with it,’ 
and they’ve been very clear 
that they put the inventors in 
the driver’s seat.”
LSA 
sophomore 
Sahil 
Kapur 
who 
co-founded 
a 
watch company called Recrire 
Vie at U-M to fund his non-
profit Help to Fight Hunger, 
also 
emphasized 
how 
the 
University facilitates startups 
at all levels.
“There’s definitely a lot of 
resources that the University 
offers, and they’re all very 
wide-spread 
and 
equally 
spread, and I think it depends 
on you, whatever you want to 
choose,” Kapur said. “Even 
if you’re not taking a class 
at Ross, I feel like there’s so 
many 
other 
opportunities 
around the school that you can 
make a difference.”

“Is it safe to visibly be 
religious on a campus like this, 
when nationally the country 
is facing white supremacy and 
gun violence?” Ali asked the 
audience.
Kelly 
Dunlop, 
associate 
director 
for 
campus 
involvement, led a panel of five 
students who came from various 
religions and backgrounds. The 
event began with a moderated 
discussion and then opened to 
questions and comments from 
the audience. 
In response to the national 
political 
climate, 
the 
panel 
discussed how religion can be 
used as a mechanism to bridge 
divides and facilitate healing. 
Social Work student Stephanie 
Morgan-Sterenberg was raised 
in a secular Jewish household 
and attended the Tree of Life 
temple in Pittsburgh, which fell 
victim to a domestic terrorist 
attack when a white supremacist 
killed 11 people in a shooting last 
year. 
“It was shattering in so many 
ways to think that we just keep 
experiencing this barrage of 
violence, and it’s condoned 
by 
this 
culture 
of 
white 
supremacy,” 
said 
Morgan-
Sterenberg. 
Morgan-Sterenberg 
said 

this experience pushed her to 
communicate with people of 
various religious backgrounds 
in 
order 
to 
unpack 
their 
experiences of facing religious 
discrimination. 
The panelists also reflected 
on their experiences in the 
classroom and around campus. 
Law School student Areeba 
Jibril discussed the exhaustion 
she has experienced as a visible 
Muslim because of her hijab. 
Jibril said our society has 
normalized the idea people 
of color are there to enrich 
white lives, and it is important 
to remember the people on 
the other end of questions are 
human.
The panel also deliberated 
how 
the 
University 
should 
address 
religious-specific 
issues going forward. Many of 
the panelists agreed professors 
should work on lifting the 
burden 
from 
the 
religious 
minorities in the room, and 
instead explain these narratives 
through readings from authors 
from those religious groups.
LSA senior Armind Chahal 
proposed 
underclassmen 
undergo 
religion-focused 
workshops, in addition to the 
mandatory 
race/ethnicity 
course requirement. 
In an interview with The 
Daily after the event, Rackham 
student Lauren White said she 
agreed with the focus on how 

faculty can improve campus 
climate.
“A good takeaway was that 
they were talking about faculty 
involvement and talking with 
staff about how they can better 
assist and be with students who 
are students of faith and not be 
offensive,” said White.
LSA junior Lorna Brown, 
who is a Michigan in Color 
editor for The Daily, grew up 
Methodist in a Black family 
that valued attending church 
every Sunday and praying every 
evening. She explained the close 
relationship between her race 
and her religion, and reflected 
on her experience in the dorms 
her freshman year when racist 
slurs were written on dorm door 
name tags. 
“That was where we really 
started doing our marches and 
going and saying we need that 
support,” Brown said. “That is 
something I continuously see, 
and I know that’s the case for a 
lot of people.”
Marlanna Landeros, Division 
of Public Safety and Security 
program 
manager, 
oversees 
DEI 
and 
student 
program 
collaboration with DPSS. When 
asked what DPSS was doing to 
address and prevent events like 
this, Landeros explained it is an 
ongoing process.

O

n Oct. 4, Attorney General 
William P. Barr wrote a 
letter to Facebook with 
counterparts 
from 
Britain 
and Australia calling for the 
company 
to 
halt 
plans 
to 
implement strong encryption 
across all of its messaging 
services. This is the latest 
episode in the long-running 
debate over government access 
to encrypted data. Beginning in 
the 1990s with the introduction 
of strong encryption software 
such as Pretty Good Privacy, the 
United States government and 
governments around the world 
have fought for “backdoors” in 
encryption. A U.S. proposal for a 
universal backdoor was defeated 
in the ’90s, but as the Snowden 
leaks showed, the government’s 
public defeat only made it pursue 
a backdoor covertly. The U.S. 
government used a combination 
of 
secret 
hacking, 
coercion 
and subversion to achieve a de 
facto backdoor. Following the 
Snowden leaks, companies have 
strengthened their encryption 
and security practices and have 
been less publicly willing to 
cooperate 
with 
government 
requests for data. Barr’s letter 
is the latest contribution to this 
polarized debate.
First, what is encryption and 
why does it matter? Broadly, 
encryption transforms data into 
a string of bits whose original 
state can only be revealed with a 
specific key. For example, if you 
were sending a message with the 
data “I love The Michigan Daily,” 
encryption 
would 
transform 
the data into something like 
“hfoahdjdsh90112aofa00” 
— 
intelligible only to those with 
the appropriate key. Encryption 
is the foundation of much of 
what we do online, enabling the 
flow of confidential information 
like our banking and health 
data by keeping it hidden and 
secure. It protects dissenters, 
journalists and everyday people 
from 
prying 
governments, 
organizations and individuals. 
As more parts of our lives move 
online, privacy and security 
are increasingly important. We 
expect what we say and do in 
private won’t be surveilled or 
exposed. The same should be 
true of our private discussions, 
activities and existence online. 
Weakening encryption weakens 
privacy and security online and 
threatens 
people’s 
freedom, 

safety and well-being.
With 
all 
the 
benefits 
of 
encryption, 
what 
are 
governments’ 
arguments 
for a backdoor, and what is 
a backdoor? Generally, it is a 
mechanism built into encryption 
systems that allows a third party 
to decrypt data when needed. 
Governments 
argue 
that 
as 
strong encryption becomes more 
common, criminal activities are 
increasingly able to “go dark,” 
or become hidden from law 
enforcement, undermining the 
rule of law and endangering us 
all. To combat this, governments 
argue that companies need to 
create ways for law enforcement 
to 
access 
encrypted 
data 
when they need it — through 
backdoors.
In 
most 
cases, 
however, 
government 
arguments 
for backdoors are far from 
convincing. 
Privacy 
and 
security 
experts 
argue 
that 
backdoors threaten the security 
and privacy of all users, and a 
bipartisan congressional report 
concluded that backdoors would 
“(work) against the national 
interest.” 
Forcing 
companies 
to build backdoors would only 
make everyday citizens less 
secure, while doing nothing to 
prevent criminals from using 
encryption. 
Any 
backdoor 
created for governments could 
be exploited by hackers through 
either targeting the backdoor 
directly or stealing access from 
governments. 
Additionally, 
the technology to use strong 
encryption is already out there. 
Building backdoors into everyday 
applications will put everyone 
at risk while doing little to stop 
tech-savvy criminals from using 
strong encryption.
There are some situations 
where 
the 
debate 
about 
law 
enforcement 
access 
to 
encrypted data is less one-
sided. As our phones become 
the 
“everything” 
tool 
and 
strong 
encryption 
is 
more 
common, 
evidence 
such 
as 
calendars, notes, pictures and 
videos has become increasingly 
difficult to obtain, even with a 
warrant. Local law enforcement 
often lack the resources and 
expertise to bypass a device’s 
strong security and encryption 
systems on their own, and they 
don’t have many options for 
help. Compelling suspects to 

provide access to their phones 
would undermine the Fifth 
Amendment and be useless in 
situations where suspects are 
unable or unwilling to help. 
Additionally, companies are less 
willing to help law enforcement 
access data and are designing 
devices to be warrant proof. 
This combination of inadequate 
capabilities and unavailable help 
can render suspects’ devices 
useless to investigations. As 
privacy becomes a selling point 
for 
technology 
companies 
from 
Apple 
to 
Facebook, 
their 
increasingly 
absolutist 
positions 
should 
be 
taken 
with a grain of salt. A narrow 
solution that protects privacy 
and security while providing 
law enforcement access when 
appropriate is not impossible 
as tech companies often argue. 
Tech companies already comply 
with 
the 
vast 
majority 
of 
government requests for data, 
though they don’t publicize 
it. Also, there are a number 
of 
existing 
proposals 
to 
address locked out devices. If 
representatives of companies, 
privacy 
advocates 
and 
the 
government engage in good 
faith discussions, a narrow, 
communitarian solution should 
be 
possible. 
Unfortunately, 
absolutism is often simpler and 
more popular.
There are certainly some 
situations where the debate 
over encryption is less lopsided. 
However, 
they 
are 
narrow 
cases 
where 
policies 
and 
system design are essential, 
not 
encryption 
capabilities 
themselves. 
Proposals 
to 
directly undermine encryption 
with 
“backdoors” 
are

Instead of fear mongering to

How Trump is constructing a closed America
I

n the most recent installment in the crackdown on immigration, the 
Trump administration announced that they will be denying visas 
to immigrants who cannot prove that they can afford healthcare.

This proclamation comes in 
conjunction with the planned 
expansion of DNA testing on 
immigrants detained near the 
federal border. This testing 
is separate from the rapid 
DNA testing used to prove 
parentage to detect potential 
traffickers who pose as family 
members of children in order 
to avoid prolonged detention. 
Rather, this new testing will 
be used to provide extensive 
DNA profiles of potential 
convicts, and the results will 
be shared with other United 
States 
law 
enforcement 
agencies.
Both policies are deeply 
rooted in negative stereotypes 
of 
immigrants, 
and 
such 
measures can seriously harm 
a 
marginalized 
population 
that is already vulnerable to 
various forms of xenophobia. 
Through 
these 
policies, 
President 
Donald 
Trump 
characterizes 
the 
U.S. 
as an elite nation that is 
exclusive 
and 
intolerant 
of 
underprivileged, 
low-income 
and 
non-
Caucasian populations. The 
implementation 
of 
these 
policies is an extension of 
the Trump administration’s 
callous 
treatment 
of 
immigrants, 
particularly 
those from Latin American 
countries. 
Moreover, 
the 
process 
of 
immigrating 
to 
the 
U.S. 
is 
already 
extraordinarily difficult. The 
addition of further obstacles, 
such as the health insurance 
requirement, show a profound 
insensitivity to the fraught 
immigration process. 
Effective on Nov. 3, 2019, 
this proclamation will allow 
consular officers to deny visas 
for those who do not have 
approved health insurance 
or those who cannot prove 
their 
financial 
ability 
to 
afford health care in the U.S. 
This proclamation will also 
disqualify immigrants who 
already live in the country 
and applied for subsidized 
coverage, 
rendering 
their 
status illegal. The Trump 
administration has justified 
this 
classist 
policy 
with 
the 
claim 
of 
“protecting 
American 
taxpayers” 
and 
“promoting self-sufficiency” 
among immigrants. By using 
health care — a basic human 
right millions of Americans 
already struggle to afford — 
as a litmus test to assess one’s 
eligibility to be American is 
both exploitative and unjust. 
It implies that only those who 
enjoy financial privileges are 
allowed to become American 
citizens 
and 
furthers 
the 
elitist and racist undertones 
in 
American 
immigration 
policies. 
Similarly, the DNA testing 
policy evokes a sense of 

class stigma that aggravates 
the racialized immigration 
policies of our border. The 
implementation 
of 
DNA 
collection 
was 
initially 
permitted through the DNA 
Fingerprint 
Act 
of 
2005, 
but 
the 
detainees 
were 
exempt from the law due to 
an agreement by the Obama 
administration — until now. 
To 
justify 
this 
measure, 
the 
Trump 
administration 
has 
cited 
whistleblower 
complaints 
that 
accused 
the 
Customs 
and 
Border 
Protection of failing to comply 
with the act to fully carry out 
DNA collection. Nevertheless, 
the policy provides no basis 
for 
such 
infringement 
of 
personal privacy and equates 
immigrants 
to 
dangerous 
criminals. 

In addition, since most of 
the DNA pool will be composed 
of Latinx individuals from 
the 
Southern 
border, 
it 
subscribes to and furthers 
the 
incorrect 
conception 
that 
a 
disproportionately 
large number of criminals 
are Latinx. This policy also 
raises 
concerns 
regarding 
the government’s extensive 
usage of technology and the 
limits — or lack thereof — 
of such innovation. While 
providing 
security 
for 
our 
own 
citizens, 
these 
technologies are also capable 
of surveilling an exploited 
population. This is akin to 
what we have seen in the 
Xinjiang province of China 
with regard to the Uighur 
Muslims or the Chechnya 
crackdown 
on 
LGBTQ 
individuals. Vera Eidelman, 
a 
staff 
lawyer 
with 
the 
American 
Civil 
Liberties 
Union’s Speech, Privacy, and 
Technology Project, said to 
the New York Times, “(this) 
kind of mass collection alters 
the purpose of DNA collection 
from 
one 
of 
criminal 
investigation 
basically 
to 
population 
surveillance, 
which is basically contrary 
to our basic notions of a 
free, trusting, autonomous 
society.” 
The 
administration’s 
announcement of these new 
policies does not necessarily 
mean they will actually come 
to fruition, but their mere 
proposal holds weight. On 
paper, these policies are meant 

to curb illegal immigration. 
In reality, they will simply 
make the legal immigration 
process 
much 
more 
difficult and disincentivize 
legal 
immigration. 
The 
accompanying 
statement 
to these proposals contains 
the 
phrasing 
that 
too 
many 
non-citizens 
were 
taking 
advantage 
of 
the 
U.S.’s 
“generous 
public 
health programs” and that 
immigrants 
augment 
the 
country’s 
“uncompensated 
health 
care 
costs.” 
This 
manner of thinking further 
vilifies 
the 
immigrant 
population, 
clearly 
using 
them as a scapegoat for the 
massive health care crisis in 
the U.S.
Additionally, 
the 
collection 
of 
DNA 
from 
migrants 
crossing 
U.S. 
borders provides no tangible 
benefit to U.S. society and 
thus only further demonizes 
those seeking to immigrate 
to the U.S. In these instances, 
Trump is simply reaffirming 
his campaign promises of 
removing all undocumented 
immigrants 
and 
limiting 
legal 
immigration. 
Policies such as these ones 
only 
deepen 
the 
divide 
between 
“desirable” 
and 
“undesirable” populations in 
the U.S. in already extremely 
divisive times. Any effort to 
curb legal immigration is the 
antithesis of what American 
values were meant to stand 
for.
The U.S. has stigmatized 
its 
immigrant 
populations 
for 
the 
majority 
of 
its 
history, 
as 
demonstrated 
by 
the 
formation 
of 
the 
Know-Nothing Party in 1849 
against Irish and German 
immigrants, the 1882 Chinese 
Exclusion Acts and 1924’s 
Johnson-Reed 
Act, 
which 
limited 
immigrants 
from 
all over the world — except 
Asia, which was completely 
excluded. 
These 
policies 
are just a modern iteration 
of 
anti-immigrant 
ideals 
against another group. They 
are far from the first to show 
a preference for white, high-
income immigrants. Under 
the current administration, 
the rhetoric used against 
Latinx populations has been 
racist, fear-mongering and 
xenophobic. 
Policies 
like 
the 
DNA 
collection 
and 
health care registration are 
meant to criminalize Latinx 
immigrants 
and 
will 
do 
nothing to address the influx 
of illegal immigration on the 
border. Though it is likely 
these new policies will be 
challenged in some capacity 
before they go into effect, the 
attempt to implement them is 
a grossly offensive attack on 
legal immigration.

Both policies are 
deeply rooted 
in negative 
stereotypes about 
immigrants

O

n the eve of a preseason 
basketball 
exhibition 
game in Tokyo, Daryl 
Morey, general manager of the 
Houston Rockets, sent out a tweet 
that reverberated around the globe. 
Morey expressed support for the 
pro-democracy protesters in Hong 
Kong, with a graphic that read 
“Fight for Freedom, Stand with 
Hong Kong.” Such a sentiment 
has bipartisan support from many 
in the United States and while 
Morey quickly retracted it, the 
message garnered many positive 
and negative responses. The global 
significance of Morey’s single tweet 
revealed a great deal about China 
and the NBA, and brought into 
question the tensions between free 
speech and business practices.
China’s 
government, 
people 
and business sectors have been 
overwhelmingly 
angry 
about 
Morey’s since-deleted tweet and 
sought for Morey to be censored in 
addition to other consequences. In 
the days since the general manager’s 
tweet was posted, Chinese state-run 
media have pulled Rockets games 
from television, basketball apparel 
stores 
have 
removed 
Rockets 
merchandise, and fans have pulled 
their support for the Rockets and, in 
some cases, the NBA as a whole.
All of this has forced the NBA 
and the Rockets into a full-scale 
cleanup 
operation. 
The 
NBA 
issued a press release apologizing 
for any offense caused by Morey’s 
purportedly insensitive comments. 
Houston’s owner Tilman Fertitta 
publicly emphasized that his team is 
“NOT a political organization” and 
that Morey “does NOT speak for the 
@HoustonRockets.” Even Morey 
himself sent out a two-part tweet 
apologizing to anyone who was 
offended and reaffirming his team 
and the league’s commitment to 
China moving forward. All of these 
responses and more sprung out of 
one seven-word tweet.
China is the NBA’s largest foreign 

market, with millions of fans who 
purchase merchandise, tune into 
games and actively engage with 
the league. The Houston Rockets – 
often associated with China since 
2002 when Houston drafted the 
7-foot-6 Shanghai-native Yao Ming 
with the first overall draft pick – 
have been historically beloved in 
the country. Many of these Chinese 
fans have expressed willingness 
to take their team loyalties and 
expenditures on sports elsewhere. 
The league has viewed it as a wise 
business strategy to cater to the 
will of China and its people by 
avoiding any sort of critical political 
statements from league employees 
and has acted accordingly in the 
Morey affair.
Yet 
the 
NBA’s 
self-abasing 
behavior regarding China and 
its political sensitivities is deeply 
concerning. By using the Chinese 
economy and people as a weapon, 
the totalitarian Chinese media 
and government have just been 
granted 
the 
power 
to 
stifle 
American speech, even outside of 
Chinese soil. Instead of prioritizing 
values of free expression, NBA 
Commissioner Adam Silver and 
the league placed the economic 
interests of what is essentially a 
multi-billion-dollar business ahead 
of the constitutional rights of their 
own employees.
In the past, the NBA has had no 
trouble taking action in accordance 
with its stated morals. The league 
was willing to pull an All Star 
game 
from 
Charlotte, 
North 
Carolina — where one of its teams, 
the Hornets, is based — because 
league officials strongly disagreed 
with the state’s “Bathroom Bill.” 
Yet in their responses to Daryl 
Morey’s tweet, the NBA would not 
dare to risk offending President Xi 
Jinping or Chinese fans. Though 
Silver later made an effort to 
clarify the league’s position and 
show support for free speech, the 
damage of capitulation had already 

been done, and the precedent had 
already been set.
This incident from last week 
begs the question of how much 
American companies could soon 
be forced to cave to the demands 
and sensitivities of the Communist 
Party of China. What sorts of 
discussion topics could soon be off 
limits to U.S. citizens for fear of 
losing their jobs? It is frightening 
to think that authoritarian limits 
to free speech in China could be 
forced on anyone around the globe, 
especially in America, and that 
businesses would fall in line in 
their efforts to simply follow the 
money.
This recent news also brings 
about a final question as to 
how U.S. consumers — still the 
majority of the NBA’s market — 
should respond in the face of last 
week’s events. While Chinese 
fans continue to grow upset over 
Morey’s expression of his beliefs, 
American supporters should hold 
the league accountable for its 
weak handling of the situation and 
willingness to throw a member of 
its community under the bus for 
simply utilizing his right to free 
expression.
The NBA, which often speaks 
of its core values, has a choice to 
make between living up to such 
morals or not having any. If league 
executives decide to forget about 
their ethical commitments once 
their profits stand to take a hit, 
they will have granted tremendous 
and dangerous power to Xi and his 
regime. If Americans truly consider 
free speech to be a fundamental 
value, we must be willing to vote 
with our wallets and TV remotes. 
A policy of appeasement from our 
companies toward China is equally 
disturbing and as inappropriate as 
it would be for our government.

Robert M. Drake and R.H. Sin deliver an uplifting pep talk in their poetry collection “Falling 
Toward the Moon.” In their respective halves, Drake and Sin shower the reader with affirmation 
through their messages of self-love and perseverance. Despite their collective thematic effort, the 
poets manage to maintain their own unmistakable voices in their presentations of encouragement. 
Given these different styles, one inevitably ends up favoring one section of the collection to the other, 
and many will prefer Sin’s for the greater degree the complexity he includes.
In the first half of the collection, Drake opts for a direct approach, typically writing brief excerpts 
in which he relies almost entirely on emotion to captivate and move the intended audience, which 
implicitly fluctuates between the collection reader and a more specific former or current lover. Some 
excerpts incorporate greater complexity, whether it be in the form of anecdotes from Drake’s own life 
or the integration of more involved analogies, like one of a returning soldier in “Fight Wars.” These 
portions are far and away the most engaging for active readers as they attempt to unpack at which 
point in Drake’s timeline of distant and recent relationships the segments apply. 
By comparison, the more transparent emotional streams of consciousness come off as somewhat 
simplistic. The reason for their inclusion is entirely sound, as they are able to explicitly convey the 
themes needed to give context to Drake’s more thought-provoking poems. They are the crucial mortar 
to more substantive bricks of Drake’s subtler works. Unfortunately, the majority of a building should 
not be mortar. While initially emotionally charged, the excess of direct emotional commentaries causes 
several poems to lose their potency, diluting them to the level of platitudes printed on motivational 
posters. Granted, it is clear that Drake’s poems come from a place of strongly pinpointed emotion for 
past and prospective lovers. For readers still pining over what could have been or those who above all 
else want the best for a current partner, Drake’s direct poems may be better received. When poems 
are as narrowly tailored to a subject requiring the reader’s experience on the matter, all others can 
feel alienated since they cannot even cling to the author’s creative depiction. For those yearning for 
a more ambitious and well-rounded presentation of similar subjects, Sin’s portion is likely to be more 
gripping.
Similarly to Drake, Sin implements a blend of direct exposition of feelings and comparatively 
hidden sentiments. Few would be able to mix up one author’s poem for that of the other, though. Sin’s 
ratio of mortar to brick is more palatable for an involved reader, and, often times, even Sin’s more 
simplistic works feature an easily understandable metaphor or other means of spicing up his work 
while maintaining the desired straightforward tone. The complexity of most of Sin’s poems goes a step 
beyond this base level and forces the reader to more closely inspect each sentence or stanza, but the 
tactic benefits Sin — especially as it juxtaposes against his co-author’s work. Sin does not come off as 

pretentious for obscuring or complicating his emotions.
Instead, the approach comes off as endearing. His feelings become more human as he depicts them 
in a more alien nature. Few are able to accurately understand the exact way they feel, much less the 
cause of their emotions. Consequently Sin’s sometimes foreign descriptions and extended metaphors 
add credibility to the feelings of overwhelmedness, love and perseverance that he conveys.
Sin’s “Crowded Minds” discusses overwhelmed feelings towards interactions with a chaotic tone 
and idiosyncratic descriptions like the interactions being “noisy on the soul.” On the contrary, in 
“Entire Life,” Drake approaches the same sentiment as Sin but from the perspective of a therapist or 
motivational speaker, consoling the audience. While heartwarming, the technique fails to create the 
authenticity of Sin’s poems. Granted, perhaps Sin is so able to take on less straightforward depictions 
of emotion because Drake transparently introduced these emotions in the first half of the collection. 
Even still, Sin’s poems are more developed and enjoyable in isolation.
Fans of love poems, especially those in need of a pick-me-up, should not hesitate to let gravity take 
hold in “Falling Toward the Moon.” Others should not avoid giving it a chance, but should keep in 
mind that getting through the first half may not be so invigorating — luckily, the direct nature of many 
of the poems in this half expedite the process.

Distinction and halves in ‘Falling Toward the Moon’

BOOK REVIEW

ANDREW PLUTA
For The Daily

There’s gonna be a riot in the streets of Ann Arbor 
this Sunday night. He captured our hearts as a 
headliner at the 2019 Ann Arbor Folk Music Festival 
last winter, then crushed them after a cancelled 
March show at the Ark. Now, Pokey LaFarge looks 
to return to lamplit streets of Ann Arbor Oct. 27 at 
The Ark. 
Lafarge embraces the legacy of his predecessors, 
and has refashioned music of eras gone by for a 
contemporary audience. No small feat, given that 
many modern listeners would scoff at listening to 
the music popular in parents’ and grandparents’ 
time.
His magic comes from his ability to blend vintage 
and modern effortlessly. LaFarge looks like an old 
folk musician right out of Nashville’s 1950s heyday 
— almost amusingly out of place in the 21st century 
crowd. His voice has a tinge of the classic country 
warble; lyrics recall the old-timey jazz of the South. 
Yet while harmonica riffs and lyrics recall the music 
of the past, guitar riffs and swing rhythms wield a 
sharp, enjoyable edge that elevates LaFarge’s music 
from a mere rehash of old hits. At times, his music 

echoes the style of classic French or Spanish music, 
echoes which are softly carried in the picking of a 
guitar. 
And while LaFarge’s music remains distinctly 
familiar, he manages to defy expectations in all 
regards. Traditional song structure is bucked, bent 
and then twisted round to suite LaFarge’s wicked, 
musical mastery. 
The Ark’s intimate performance space is perfect 
for LaFarge. His music, which often features plenty 
of instrumental breaks and riffs, and his unique 
style of singing both lend themselves to a venue 
like The Ark. Every seat is the best seat in the house 
when you’re down at Ann Arbor’s local live music 
joint. 
Whether you’re ready to gear up for his upcoming 
performance this weekend, or you’re looking to 
jump into the world of LaFarge for the first time, 
start with “Goodbye, Barcelona,” “La La Blues” 
and “Riot in The Streets.” For a more classic feel, 
go to his earlier albums, like Beat, Move & Shake, 
then switch it up to LaFarge’s modern twists with 
Something In The Water. 
Maybe, if this preview does its job, I’ll see you in 
the audience this Sunday night. Until then, indulge 
in the old-fashioned with the world’s coolest time 
traveller, Pokey LaFarge.

LaFarge to play The Ark

Summer tends to be a season of new discoveries 
for me, especially in terms of finding new music. 
The summer after my freshman year, I was fully 
invested in the Ann Arbor music scene, but 
wanted to explore what the broader DIY scene 
had to offer. I spent much of my time poking 
around Bandcamp and the related artists section 
for some of my favorite artists on Spotify and 
found some groups I really liked, and some that 
I didn’t. Three projects that stuck out to me were 
Snail Mail, Soccer Mommy and Clairo.
I was mesmerized by the lush melodies, 
beautiful 
harmonies 
and 
overall 
fantastic 
songwriting I heard, despite the fact that none 
of these artists had a full-length release under 
their belt yet. I sent my friends demos, covers and 
EPs from these artists because I really enjoyed 
their music, so much so that I actually wrote 
an application sample for this paper on Soccer 
Mommy’s Collection.
At the end of the summer, The New York 
Times published an article titled, “Women are 
making the best rock music today. Here are 
the bands that prove it.” The article featured 
several projects that I either knew or would 
come to know like Snail Mail, Sheer Mag, Diet 
Cig in addition to many others, and discussed 
the underrepresentation of women in the genre. 
After it was published, I started to see other 
publications post about “women in indie rock” in 
a way that almost felt tokenizing. But nonetheless, 
it still exposed audiences to voices that are often 
underrepresented in the scene.
DIY has often been accused of being a bit 
of a boys club, and if you go to a few shows, 
it’s not hard to see why. Most of the bands 
consist of an all-male lineup with a pretty stark 
underrepresentation of people of color. Even the 
crowds present at these shows can sort of embody 
this masculine energy at times, which creates a 
space that feels exclusive. But how can we change 
this?
The Cohort is a new, independent organization 
on campus that seeks to promote and protect the 
art and work of women, POC and the LGBTQ+ 
community. Think of them as less of a club and 
more of an artist-based union. Started by LSA 
junior Delaney Cavanaugh and Stamps senior 
Victoria Rinaldi, the group is still in their 
beginning stages, but is already starting to put on 
events and meetings.
“I just really wanted to provide more of a 
platform for more marginalized people. I feel like 

there’s a lot of times where I’m the only woman in 
the space, or I’m the only non-white person in the 
space, and it can be really uncomfortable … I just 
want to provide a place for people that wouldn’t 
normally have that,” Rinaldi said in an interview 
with The Daily. 
Cavanaugh added that she was discussing 
some local bands with a group of her friends and 
came to the realization that along with Victoria’s 
band, Big Vic, there was only one other women-
led local DIY band, Landline, that really was 
active in the DIY scene. “And we were like, ‘why 
is that?’,” Cavanaugh said. “And we just kind of 
came to that realization that, oh, there’s not a lot 
of women, or just diversity in general within the 
scene.”
Part of what contributes to this gap is the 
omnipresence of masculine energy in these 
spaces. Rinaldi said that even when she plays 
with a group of her male friends, she sometimes 
feels uncomfortable. “No matter how much I like 
them, and how much we get along, I still feel like 
I have to prove myself,” Rinadli stated. “I identify 
as a woman, or like, I’m even on the more feminine 
side of the spectrum so it’s just kind of like ... it’s 
like you have to hold it up. Yeah, it’s like I feel 
like I have to prove myself, even though nobody 
around me actively makes me feel that way.”
Cavanaugh followed up, saying, “The point of 
the group is to have a space where women and 
underrepresented groups feel safe and are like, 
‘Oh, I’m attached to this group of people who will 
support me; I feel more confident to go out there 
book myself or play a show,’ or whatever it may 
be.”
The group aims to provide resources for these 
underrepresented artists and expose these 
artists to a larger audience. From helping with 
booking and providing practice spaces for groups 
to making playlists featuring a diverse group of 
artists and creating a community to identify with, 
their services really vary. But if you don’t identify 
as a member of a marginalized group, The Cohort 
still welcomes your support.
“We’re not going to, like, exclude anybody, 
so our thinking is that you’re here to support 
everybody else if you’re identifying with The 
Cohort. You are going to be here to be an ally, 
which means that we may not choose your art 
first (if you don’t identify with these marginalized 
communities) because we want to support 
these other people first. But it’s still completely 
welcome,” Cavanaugh said.
There’s still a ways to go before the Michigan 
DIY scene can be called diverse, but through 
increased efforts from groups like The Cohort, 
progress is slowly being made.

Human hair is not often found in stockings. 
Neither are rings, cotton balls, jewelry, 
glitter or nail polish. But hanging ominously 
in the Irving Stenn Jr. Family Gallery of the 
University of Michigan Museum of Art, several 
pairs of stockings are stuffed with these items 
and synch the waists of white pillows cradled 
in a twine hammock. The sculpture hangs 
across most of the room, eerily displaying 
fractured parts of body-image culture. 
To the left of this sculpture are three large 
photographs of a hunched woman, whose 
naked back is to the camera. The viewer 
can’t tell if over the course of the images she 
is turning toward the viewer or away from 
them. The woman appears again on hauntingly 
beautiful photographs on the back wall. She 
poses in various settings, draped in a peculiar 
sculpture 
that 
strings 
together 
multiple 
fabricated limbs into one garment for her to 
wear. She looks at the viewer with a complex 
certainty, a striking invitation for the viewer 
to look closer. 
Mari Katayama, an up-and-coming Japanese 
artist, is both model and artist in much of her 
work. Born in 1987 with tibial hemimelia (a 
rare developmental condition), she has two 
fingers on one hand and had to have her legs 
amputated at nine years old. She has worn 
prosthetics ever since. The young artist’s 
work feels incredibly intimate. She showcases 
her disabled body along with hand-sewn 
sculptures (usually of limbs or body parts she 
is missing), which makes her body seem like a 
material she is also sculpting. 

As an artist, she has taken complete 
ownership of her medium: herself. Nothing 
feels candid, but every piece feels deeply 
honest. It’s as if by crafting intricate, staged 
scenes, the artist reveals a direct line to 
herself. By leaning into the fantastical and 
strange elements of her art, she tells her 
truth more honestly than a candid photo ever 
could. Her gaze, in particular, is what caught 
me in each photo. Everything else — from her 
posture to her props to the color palette — feels 
otherworldly and staged. But her gaze cuts 
through the artifice, allowing you to view the 
captured moment through her eyes; you are 
immersed in a fabricated world that is true to 
her, however seemingly absurd or strange it 
seems.
The effect of this is an inward one; her work 
forces the viewer to reconsider how their own 
bodies fit into this strange, body-obsessed 
culture we’ve found ourselves in. Katayama 
owns her body, but it never feels trivial or 
glamorous or superficially celebratory. Rather, 
her work presents herself as one entity, as one 
spirit that fits perfectly into her own body. 
It’s blunt and asks important questions: How 
do we live honestly when we are cajoled into 
cramming our bodies into the latest fashion? 
What happens when your body and your spirit 
are the same entity? 
There are no clear answers for society at 
large, but Katayama presents an answer in 
every secretive glance she gives the camera: 
she lives with power. Despite years of body 
image culture and typical notions of femininity 
attempting to exert power over her, she lives 
well. She lives as herself, as her art, as her 
materials and her spirit, and she invites her 
viewers to do the same.

The first two episodes of “Limetown” want you 
to know one thing: This show is weird. In fact, it’s 
so weird, it can make producing a podcast seem 
interesting. 
“Limetown” follows unstable journalist Lia 
Haddock (Jessica Biel, “The Illusionist”) as she 
documents her search for a secluded town’s 
population that mysteriously disappeared. Once a 
research facility and private community of expert 
neuroscientists, Limetown has stood vacant for 
fifteen years following a lengthy investigation into 
how and why the three hundred residents vanished 
without a trace.
Lia, motivated to find her uncle, (Stanley Tucci, 
“Spotlight”) a former resident of Limetown, produces 
a podcast documenting her own search for the truth. 
Although she faces resistance from her boss on why 
a fifteen-year-old story is relevant today, Lia persists 
and is ultimately contacted by a former resident who 
is ready to share her experience. 
Upon meeting this woman, Lia discovers the 
research conducted in Limetown may be connected 
to the mass disappearance. The woman recounts 
her life in the town and her eventual realization 
that her new home was not as idyllic as it seemed. 
Now armed with more information from the source, 
including the location of another survivor, Lia sets 
off to uncover the conspiracy. Despite a violent 
attempt to intimidate her into dropping the story, Lia 
commits to following her leads and finding the rest of 

Limetown’s citizens.
Throughout the first episodes of the series, the 
plot focuses mainly on setting up Lia as a damaged 
and slightly unhinged antihero who has become 
obsessed with the town and its residents. In doing so, 
the show becomes less about the search for truth and 
more about unnerving the viewer through constant 
plot reveals and overly dramatic character building.
“Limetown” is begging the audience to be scared. 
In fact, it throws every trope it needs to at the wall just 
to see what will stick. A cult-like gated community? 
Sure. A public execution of a town leader? Okay. A 
secret tunnel system of caves underneath the whole 
city? Alright. Possible mind control? Sounds good. 
“Limetown” has got it all. Despite the twists and 
turns, the show is still mostly scenes of Lia holding a 
microphone or having an emotional breakdown. 
While “Limetown” has radical elements that 
would make any story eye-catching, the show doesn’t 
need to try so hard. When the main plot involves a 
mass conspiracy, no one needs multiple scenes of 
Jessica Biel being creepy to really hammer home 
the show’s spooky atmosphere. While “Limetown” 
wants to make the point that this mystery would 
“drive anyone insane,” it all seems a bit excessive. 
“Limetown” has a lot of ingredients to be a 
pop culture sensation. The star power of Biel and 
Tucci, source material from a popular podcast and 
captivating story could easily carry the show into 
mass popularity. However, if “Limetown” continues 
to divert its focus from the beauty of a convoluted, 
slightly campy plot, it’s unlikely to reach its potential 
as a truly wild, trippy look into a mind-altering 
thriller.

TV REVIEW

Issa Lopez (“Todo Mal”) opens “Tigers 
Are Not Afraid” with statistics on the adult 
death toll of drug trade-related violence in 
her native Mexico, then follows these with an 
anti-statistic of sorts: the unknown number 
of child casualties. Calling attention to these 
unrecorded numbers and the unwritten stories 
of ruined lives behind them, then writing one 
herself, is the chief accomplishment of Lopez’s 
film. Released in 2017 in Mexico and stateside 
in 2019, “Tigers Are Not Afraid” imaginatively 
narrates and underlines the toll that the drug 
trade in Mexico takes on children. 
In Lopez’s depiction, death literally follows 
children around. She transitions from the 
opening statistics to the middle school 
classroom of the film’s female protagonist 
Estrella (Paola Lara), who just barely survives 
an outbreak of gun violence on her campus, 
only to walk home and bypass a dead body on 
the sidewalk and arrive to an empty home. 
We later learn Estrella’s mother has been 
abducted by the Huascas, a gang that runs 
the local and seems to have all other local 
institutions at their beck and call. On her 
walk, though, something abnormal happens: 
A stream of blood coming from the corpse 
Estrella passed follows her around, and will 
for the rest of the film. I’m hesitant to call 
this moment in the film simply fantastical or 
magical or horrifying — instead, it’s a brilliant, 
appropriate merger of genres that represents 
the intersection of childhood freedom with 
adult terror.
In that way, “Tigers Are Not Afraid” 
reminds me of 2018’s “Capernaum” in its 
devastating saga and its close attention to and 
respect for its child protagonists. Unlike the 
latter, however, “Tigers” capitalizes on every 
opportunity to celebrate the unique gifts 
children have to care extraordinarily for one 
another, to express themselves, to cope with 

inexplicable evil and boundless loss. Scenes 
like an energetic soccer match between the 
children in an abandoned mansion where they 
hide from the Huasacas, or an umbrella dance 
under the water channeled through a gutter, 
stand out amid the darkness of the film that 
is overwhelming at times. Instead of walking 
away disconsolate, as many viewers surely 
did after watching the story of young Zain in 
“Capernaum,” Lopez includes scenes that let 
light in, recoloring the characters’ lives as 
well as viewers’ perceptions of them.
As much as “Tigers” is a feat of narrating 
childhood traumas, it is also a feat of visual 
storytelling. One of the most innovative 
manipulations of visuals in the film, and 
also the source of critics’ descriptions of 
the film as using “magical realism,” takes 
the form of the film’s animated graffiti art. 
Both Estrella and the male protagonist of the 
film, El Shine (Juan Ramón López), take to 
the alleys with cans of black spray paint and 
render their sorrows and fantasies on the 
walls. The English title of the film is drawn 
from the illustration Estrella makes of a tiger, 
invoked thereafter as a motif of courage and 
survival despite impossible conditions. Shine, 
leader of the band of orphaned children that 
take Estrella in after she loses her mother, 
rendered portraits of himself as well as the 
other boys in his pack of orphans. And like 
the portrait of Dorian Gray, the likenesses 
of the young children, as well as the various 
tiger illustrations, grow more menacing as 
they turn increasingly to violence in order to 
survive. I would argue Lopez does more with 
this plot device than Oscar Wilde originally 
did, using it to depict moral erosion as a result 
of young people’s social circumstances and 
not the other way around. 
“Tigers Are Not Afraid” is horrifying and 
magical, mystical and deeply troubling. Lopez 
deftly cross-pollinates these genres and in 
their product, discovers a new way to tell the 
story of young children impacted by grownups’ 
crimes and self-concern.

Jones and Wetterstrom shine in 
important win over Penn State

The noise at Crisler Center 
oscillated between deafening 
roars and eerie quiet. The 
up-and-down 
third 
set 
orchestrated 
which 
pitch 
would come next. Penn State’s 
Jonni Parker’s kill late in the 
set ushered silence over the 
arena, but Sydney Wetterstrom 
ended the sense of unease with 
a kill to close the set, 25-17, in 
favor of Michigan.
During those few minutes of 
the third set, anticipation for 
a win was palpable in Crisler 
Center. Unfortunately for the 
Michigan 
volleyball 
team, 
those few minutes were the 
only ones worth celebrating. 
A 3-1 loss for the Wolverines 
against the Nittany Lions on 
Friday shut the crowd up once 
and for all.
“We did a great job of fighting 
back in, but at that point you’re 
down by seven and eight, it’s 
a tough battle against a really 
good team,” said Michigan 
coach Mark Rosen.
While all four sets were 
plagued 
by 
defensive 
miscommunication and poor 

serving returns from Michigan, 
Wetterstrom and Jones stood 
out on an otherwise forgettable 
night.
Wetterstrom had two career-
highs against the Nittany Lions 
— 16 kills and three blocks. She 
also contributed 13 digs, and 
two service aces, becoming 
a key all-around player for 
the Wolverines. She is top-
five in four categories — kills, 
assists, service aces and digs. 
Additionally, she contributed 
17.5 points for Michigan.
“I thought (Wetterstrom) 
played the most complete game 
I’ve seen her play this year. 
Offensively, she was really 
really good,” Rosen said. “I 
thought she was just really 
dialed in tonight and played 
really 
well. 
She 
certainly 
played like a veteran.”
On Friday night, Jones was 
the difference-maker in the 
third set, when she went on 
a seven-serve run, extending 
Michigan’s 
lead 
over 
Penn 
State to seven points. She also 
had a career-high 16 kills on 
the night. Like Wetterstrom, 
Jones is also top-five in five 
categories — assists, service 
aces, digs, kills and blocks. She 

holds the team-high in kills 
with 226. 
“She got going, I thought she 
started a little slow and then 
I thought she really got into 
a rhythm which is something 
Pagie does a very good job of,” 
Rosen said. “She’s very good at 
keeping her composure.”
Composure, 
though 
something 
the 
Wolverines 
usually excel at, was lacking 
Friday night. From multiple 
back-row miscommunications 
to missed blocks, Michigan 
often found itself in deep holes, 
trailing the Nittany Lions by 
seven or eight points at times. 
As 
the 
Wolverines 
look 
towards 
the 
rest 
of 
their 
season, 
filled 
with 
tough 
conference opponents, they’ll 
need to continue to capitalize 
on key players like Jones and 
Wetterstrom. Along with the 
rest of their starting line-
up, if the Wolverines can 
find 
composure, 
Friday’s 
performance 
against 
Penn 
State can be the exception as 
opposed to the norm.
“Being in those hot battles, 
being in the fire, it makes you 
stronger,” Rosen said. “What 
doesn’t kill you makes you 

Michigan rotates players in win

Seventeen — the amount of 
Wolverines who touched the 
court on Saturday night. Also the 
total amount of active players on 
their roster.
The 
Michigan 
women’s 
volleyball team (13-5 overall, 6-2 
Big Ten) rotated through its entire 
lineup on its way to a 3-0 victory 
over Rutgers (6-13, 0-8). The win 
was reassuring, snapping a two-
game losing streak and making 
a statement about the depth of 
its lineup. The 
non-starting 
players 
upheld 
a 
dominating 
performance 
over the Scarlet 
Knights — the 
closest set being 
25-16.
The 
Wolverines 
had no trouble 
amidst 
their 
substitutions, siding out at .814 and 
ending with a .462 hit percentage 
— two impressive tallies. With 
so many substitutions, a drop in 
production is to be expected, but 
Michigan’s performance didn’t 
dip.
The 17 players who touched the 
court for Michigan was 10 more 

than opponent Rutgers, who 
stuck to their starters the full 
match. Additionally, Michigan’s 
non-starters finished the match 
with a .421 hit percentage — .382 
higher than Rutgers starters’ 
lowly .039.
“Everyone was really good 
about staying dialed in,” said 
junior libero Natalie Smith. “I 
think everyone came in and did 
a great job. I think we executed 
really well.”
The Wolverines approached 
with 
an 
aggressive 
strategy 
to get out to a quick lead with 
their starters in 
order to rotate 
in players from 
the 
sidelines. 
And 
once 
the 
substitutions 
were 
made, 
starters 
were 
working to set 
up opportunities 
for 
teammates 
who don’t play as 
often.
“It always comes from the 
older players and the leadership 
in the program,” said Michigan 
coach Mark Rosen. “I thought it 
was a really selfless match.”
Amidst 
the 
chaos 
of 
substitutions, 
the 
Scarlet 
Knights struggled to contain the 
potent Michigan attack. With 

each switch, Rutgers struggled 
to settle in against the new 
personnel. Once it did, the new 
Wolverines had already taken the 
court, ready to play.
Most of all, Michigan’s play 
was clean. It ended with just 
seven attack errors, only one of 
which was committed by a non-
starting player. Sequences were 
converted without a hitch, most 
landing a kill after merely one 
return by the Scarlet Knights. 
All done in the process of 
creating opportunities for less 
experienced players.
The 
players’ 
attitudes 
were important to note. The 
Wolverines appeared relaxed but 
in control, smiling and laughing 
with each other in between 
sets as well as encouraging one 
another after conceding a point. 
“When they came in you could 
see how excited they were,” 
Rosen said. “They were playing 
for each other. As a coach that’s 
one of those warm fuzzy feelings 
where you’re like, they’re getting 
it.”
Many positive things could 
be taken away from Saturday’s 
match, but Rosen kept his focus 
on the girls’ camaraderie. It was 
his main source of pride post-
match.
“That’s the kind of team I want 
to coach.”

Late penalty kick lifts Wolverines 
past Notre Dame on the road, 1-0

With a shade over a minute 
remaining 
in 
regulation, 
Nebojsa 
Popovic 
steadied 
himself 15 yards from the goal, 
readying for a penalty kick. The 
game’s fate hung in the balance. 
Michigan’s hopes rested firmly 
in his right foot. 
When the Wolverines needed 
him most, the graduate transfer 
forward 
delivered. 
Popovic 
buried the game-winning kick 
past Notre Dame’s goalkeeper 
Duncan Turnbull in the 89th 
minute, giving the Michigan 
men’s soccer team (7-4-3 overall, 
2-1-2 Big Ten) a 1-0 victory over 
Notre Dame (7-6-1, 1-5 ACC) on 
Tuesday. 
To 
his 
teammates 
and 
coaches alike, there was never 
a doubt that Popovic would take 
care of business in the clutch. 
“I was really confident that 
Nebojsa was gonna put it away,” 
said senior goalkeeper Andrew 
Verdi. “He stepped up, he’s been 

working on it in training. I knew 
he was gonna tuck it away and 
we were gonna walk out with a 
1-0 win.”
If Popovic played the role of 
hero, then senior forward Jack 
Hallahan 
was 
his 
sidekick. 
Returning from a two-game 
absence, Hallahan offered a 
needed boost to the Wolverine 
offense. In fact, it was Hallahan 
who forced his way through 
the teeth of the Fighting Irish 
defense, drawing the foul that 
set the stage for Popovic’s 
heroics. 
“(Hallahan) was definitely 
electric tonight,” said Michigan 
coach Chaka Daley. “Caused 
some problems for them and 
eventually got dragged down 
in the box. It was definitely a 
game-changing 
moment 
for 
him. He did a great job.”
While not able to capitalize 
until the game’s final minutes, 
the Wolverine offense created 
numerous 
opportunities 
through aggressive play up 
front. Popovic and sophomore 

forward 
Derick 
Broche 
had three shots apiece for a 
Michigan team that out-shot 
Notre Dame, 13-9. 
On the defensive end, Verdi 
keyed the shutout with another 
stellar performance, recording 
five saves on the night. 
“I was pleased that I was able 
to respond when called upon,” 
Verdi said. “Just like in any 
game though, the goalkeeper’s 
performance is really reliant on 
the line of guys in front of him. 
All (10) put in a heck of an effort 
in front of me today.”
Michigan’s 
effort 
against 
Notre Dame stood in stark 
contrast to its performance 
last time out against Western 
Michigan, 
a 
2-1 
loss 
on 
Thursday. The Wolverines let 
their emotions get the best of 
them in what was a chippy, 
foul-filled contest against the 
Broncos. This time around, 
though, the team remained 
composed amidst the Fighting 
Irish’s physicality, which came 
in the form of 20 fouls, two 
yellow cards and a late red card. 
“Our attitude and approach 
to calls and adversity was 
much stronger,” Daley said. 
“You know, we really worked 
on having conversations about 
what that looked like, and how 
to stay involved and engaged in 
the game despite the ref’s call.”
Daley 
also 
lauded 
the 
resiliency the team displayed in 
rebounding for a difficult road 
win after consecutive losses. 
With just three games left in 
the regular season, getting 
back in the win column was 
imperative. 
“Today we had great energy, 
great spirit about us, came out 
with fire,” Verdi said. “We put 
the team under pressure in the 
first half and followed that in 
the second half, so it just really 
boosted our confidence.
“The 
team’s 
definitely 
hungry for more.”

‘M’ finishes 11th at Nuttycombe

An 
event 
that 
included 
representatives from four of the 
Power Five conferences — as well 
as some lesser known but equally 
potent foes from around the 
country — was the perfect place to 
make a statement with just weeks 
until conference championships.
The No. 18 Michigan men’s 
cross country team showcased 
its abundance of depth, as well 
as 
high 
levels 
of 
individual 
consistency, with an 11th place 
showing 
at 
the 
Nuttycombe 
invitational in Wisconsin last 
Friday. The 33-team field included 
15 units ranked in the top 25 of the 
Coaches’ Poll.
The Wolverines featured one 
of the tightest spreads of the field, 
with all seven runners crossing 
the line within 45 seconds of one 
another. After a predictably fast 
first two kilometers, junior Devin 
Meyrer, freshman Nick Foster and 

junior Joost Plaetinck split low and 
even throughout the remainder of 
the race to move up the pack and 
finish in that order. 
Meyrer, a transfer from Baylor, 
noted a desire for teammates who 
would challenge him as a primary 
motivation for his change of 
scenery. 
“I realized that if I wanted to 
be the best runner I could be, I 
needed to have more guys to train 
with,” Meyrer said.
The last pair of kilometers 
were the most chaotic, with a 
large diversity of times leading to 
a shuffling of runners, especially 
outside the top 10. The geography 
of the course contributed to this 
statistical consistency.
“The race didn’t really crack 
open until 6k,” Meyrer said. “The 
course caused a lot of guys to 
bunch up ... it was hard to get up 
and keep pushing.”
The late-race frenzy cost the 
Wolverines some points in the 
back half of their lineup. Junior 

Jack Aho and sophomore Ben Hill, 
running in the crucial displacing 
roles, tumbled in the standings 
after losing steam in the latter 
half of the race. Michigan coach 
Kevin Sullivan remarked that 
this is one of the areas the team 
needs to improve on going into 
championship season. 
“Once we get a couple guys 
moved a little closer to the front, 
that’s gonna put us in a much 
better position,” Sullivan said.
Shouting his responses above 
the din of a satisfied team post-
race, Meyrer noted the importance 
of cooperation and teamwork in 
what appears, at first glance, to 
be a sport rooted in individual 
practice and performance.
“We have a group of seven 
guys and countless others all 
working 
together,” 
Meyrer 
said. “When someone’s feeling 
bad, we’ll pull them along, and 
when someone’s feeling good 
they’ll pull along someone 
else.”

Perhaps too late, offense settles in

It took a loss, 26 quarters and a 
21-7 deficit heading into the 27th, 
but we finally know what speed in 
space looks like.
Senior 
quarterback 
Shea 
Patterson slinging it. Freshman 
running back Zach Charbonnet 
bursting through open holes. A 
talented receiving corps getting 
put to use. Run-pass options 
and tempo wearing down the 
opponent. Explosive plays putting 
an exclamation mark on the whole 
thing.
It was easy to forget as 
Michigan football slogged through 
its first six games of the season 
with one unconvincing offensive 
performance after another, as 
coaches and players faced media 
and seemed to ignore the obvious 
issues right in front of them. 
But this was what offensive 
coordinator Josh Gattis came to 
Ann Arbor advertising 10 long 
months ago.
And for the last two quarters 
in a whiteout at State College on 
Saturday night, against a Penn 
State defense that came into the 
game ranked top-10 in SP+, the 
Wolverines lived up to the billing.
“Everybody saw it,” said senior 
left tackle Jon Runyan Jr. “(Being) 
able to move the ball with ease, 
running RPOs, wide receivers 
getting open, catching the ball. 
Really important, we weren’t 
getting in those second and third-
and-longs. 
“We were able to run our style of 
offense that we wanted to. Banging 
out the explosive plays, I think we 
had five explosive runs and seven 
explosive passes.”
It is, of course, no mere footnote 
that football games last four 
quarters, not two. Nor is it trivial 
that Michigan ultimately came up 
short, losing, 28-21, and as a result, 
those first 26 quarters where the 
offense looked lost will likely cost 
the Wolverines all of their goals. 
A College Football Playoff is out. 
A Big Ten title would require a lot 

of dominos falling in Michigan’s 
favor. The jury is still out on 
Gattis as a coordinator, though, 
and Saturday was the first time, 
sans-Rutgers and Illinois, that 
his offense looked like what was 
promised.
Michigan went on the road and 
outgained Penn State, 417-283. 
Patterson commanded the pocket 
like he hadn’t all year, throwing for 
276 yards with one costly mistake, 
an interception to Tariq Castro-
Fields. The Wolverines ran over 80 
plays and by the end of the game, 
the Nittany Lions were gassed.
“That’s 
kinda 
sorta 
the 
confidence we’ve had all year,” 
Patterson said Tuesday in a 
surprise appearance in front of 
reporters. “No matter how many 
times that happened, just so proud 
of our O-Line. ... Charbonnet had 
a great second half on the ground. 
The receivers were getting out on 
the perimeter and making big-time 
plays. It was really exciting.”
It’s hard to reconcile that with 
the loss and all it means, with the 
cold hard fact that the needed 
offensive progress ultimately came 
too late in the season. The most 
Michigan can reasonably hope 
to get out of the next five weeks 
are feel-good wins over its three 
biggest rivals. As much as that 
would mean (particularly beating 
Ohio State), it isn’t a Big Ten trophy.
The offense, ultimately, holds 
a lot of the fault for that. Even 
against Penn State, dropped balls, 

penalties and an early failure 
to convert a fourth down will 
haunt the Wolverines. They had 
four drives end in Nittany Lion 
territory without a point, and a 
fifth at midfield. Even in what 
was arguably his best game since 
taking the job, there are spots to 
nitpick Gattis’ performance.
Yet, it’s hard to argue with 
tangible progress. 
“I feel like our guys just went out 
there and played loose,” Patterson 
said. “I was battling some injuries 
all year, and for the first time, I 
think I went out there and was 100 
percent healthy. I felt good, and 
our guys felt good.”
For 
much 
of 
the 
season, 
Michigan has harped on how the 
offense has worked in practice and 
merely not translated into games. 
Otherwise, the Wolverines pointed 
to a lack of outside knowledge on an 
offense that came into Saturday’s 
game ranked 53rd in offensive SP+.
Outside of two games against 
the Big Ten’s bottom-feeders, 
Saturday was the first time the 
offense backed up those claims to 
the naked eye.
“We were just moving the ball,” 
said junior receiver Nico Collins. 
“We were focusing on our deals, 
fundamentals. And it worked.”
It worked. And Michigan lost. 
If Gattis is to succeed over 
the long term, he’ll need greater 
consistency than his unit has shown 
thus far. But Saturday was at least a 
step in the right direction.

Patterson shows fight in PSU loss

Michigan 
was 
scrapping 
and clawing, and its senior 
quarterback was leading the 
charge.
Down 28-14 on Saturday, Shea 
Patterson marched his team 
down to the one-yard line in the 
middle of the fourth quarter, 
facing a fourth-and-goal with 
the game in the balance. The 
Wolverines 
called 
Patterson’s 
number, a quarterback sneak, in 
hopes of muscling their way to a 
one-possession game. There was 
literal scrapping, clawing — and, 
apparently, gouging.
“The dude has his index finger 
up my eye, in my eye socket, for 
like 10 seconds,” Patterson said 
Tuesday, unable to identify which 
Penn State defensive player. “That 
wasn’t good.
“I was trying to reach the ball 
across the plane, and for a good 
while I was screaming for my life. 
I wasn’t too happy about that.”
After 
the 
referees 
finally 
signaled for a touchdown, the 
lengthy quarrel finally dispersing, 
Patterson walked over to the 
sideline, vision blurred, with 
tears streaming from his eyes. His 
team had life, if only temporary. 
Some hindered vision would not 
deter him.
It 
is 
in 
that 
context 
— 
complementing 
his 
24-for-41, 
276-yard performance — that the 
praise for his best performance 
of the season takes on a new 
meaning.
“Each game, Shea’s getting 
better and better,” said junior 
wide 
receiver 
Nico 
Collins. 
“During the season, he had a 
couple turnovers and he learned 
from turnovers. That’s hard. We 
want Shea back right now. He’s 
the quarterback and we all trust 
in Shea. He believes in us.”
Added Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh: “I think Shea has 
been 
playing 
great 
football. 
Heroic. Really pleased. He’s into 
it, his demeanor every game. 

Confident, excited about it. Likes 
being in that type of atmosphere 
and playing in that type of game. 
Sense it from everything about 
him.”
It’s the kind of praise Harbaugh 
has heaped on his signal-caller all 
year, through the good and bad. 
Patterson’s performance in the 
first six games underwhelmed 
relative 
to 
high 
external 
expectations, 
undoubtedly 
hindered by an oblique injury 
suffered on the very first play 
of the season against Middle 
Tennessee State — a play that 
resulted in a Patterson fumble.
Tuesday, Patterson noted the 
game in State College was “the 
first time I think I went out there 
and was 100 percent healthy.” It 
would help explain the newfound 
agility and tenacity that was 
readily on display last season. A 
little swagger, too.
In those six games, he made 
no such excuses, though. He 
regularly demanded better, both 
from himself and his team, and 
took the blame when things went 
awry. On the converse, Patterson 
was hesitant to accept any praise 
in the aftermath of a 28-21 loss to 
the Nittany Lions.
“Any time you don’t win, for 
me, I’m trying to do everything I 
can to win it for that locker room,” 

Patterson said. “And this offense 
is doing everything it can to win 
because we hate losing. It really 
doesn’t matter how I played. All 
that matters is the end result, and 
we didn’t win.”
A reinvigoration of Patterson’s 
season 
would 
be 
at 
once 
encouraging and deflating for 
a two-loss team now ostensibly 
eliminated from Big Ten- and 
College 
Football 
Playoff-
contention. It’s not difficult to 
envision a second-half resurgence 
lifting this Wolverines offense 
to new heights — a strong close 
to the season, maybe some 
important rivalry wins. 
Who knows where this season, 
Patterson’s last, might be if he 
had found his footing earlier in 
the year. Or if he’d never taken a 
hit to the oblique in the first place. 
Ask him, though, and he’ll tell you 
it’ll take a whole lot more than 
an index finger in his eye to stop 
fighting.
“We have an opportunity — 
we have a decision to make,” 
Patterson said Tuesday, very 
matter-of-factly. “Our goal is to 
win every game the rest of the 
season. I love this team. We’re all 
so close, and we trust each other, 
and we love playing together. 
“I don’t think there is any 
other goal than to just win.”

Play with Pearson: Jack Summers’ game-winner

The Daily sat down with 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson on 
Monday and pulled out a hockey 
whiteboard.
“Okay good,” Pearson said. 
“Some X’s and O’s.”
Pearson 
drew 
up 
the 
intricacies of a play from last 
weekend’s matchup against Lake 
Superior State that led to a Jack 
Summers goal. He broke down 
where players went with the 
puck, what they were thinking 
with the play they made and how 
it all went down — with the X’s 
and O’s on a whiteboard.
The Daily deciphered the 
board and pieced together a 
series of drawings that represent 
what Pearson had to show.
Here’s what he drew up.
***
Saturday, the Lakers scored 
back-to-back goals in the second 
period to bring their deficit to 
3-2. With tension in the air and 
momentum against them, the 
Wolverines breathed a sigh of 
relief when Summers scored 
an insurance goal to bring the 
Michigan lead back up to two. 
The 
sophomore 
defenseman’s 
tally would later turn into the 
game-winner after Lake Superior 
State scored a third, the final 
score, 4-3.
TMD: I was wondering if 
you could walk us through what 
happened with Jack Summers’ 
goal. Starting from the point 
when it was brought into the 
zone.
Pearson: 
Yeah. 
So 
what 
happened is, the thing about 
Summers’ goal is the shot itself. 
You see a lot of guys when they 
receive the puck, the first instant 
is you take it from your forehand 
to your backhand and then back 
to your forehand. And even just 
that split second, it allows a 
goalie to get in position or slide 
over. 
Pearson: 
And 
you 
see 
Summers, he just goes in. You’ll 

see (sophomore forward Nolan) 
Moyle, if you look at a two-on-
one, gets it here, but instead 
of just shooting, he gets it and 
then he goes like this — brings it 

back like that, and then shoots. 
Summers, when you watch him, 
just comes in and just shoots it. 
So the goalie is moving in and it’s 
not a great shot. It’s not top shelf. 
I mean it sort of 
beats him here, 
but the goalie’s 
moving and he 
just can’t stop it. 
He’s not set and 
it just beats him 
because he got it 
away too quick.
Pearson: But 
on the goal, it 
happened to be 
a two-on-one, so 
they’re like this, 
(junior forward) Mike Pastujov 
and (freshman forward Johnny 

Beecher), who tries to pass it. 
Instead he probably should have 
went and shot it.
Pearson: So (Summers) is 
coming up, like we tell one of 

our defenseman to be the fourth 
player in the rush. So he’s coming 
in here and Becker’s on this side 
and Becker comes in later but 
after the pass fails, it goes in the 
corner.
Pearson: 
Mikey goes and 
stays 
with 
it. 
Beecher 
comes 
with 
him, 
so 
Beecher picks it 
up at this point 
after the failed 
pass across. He 
just bumps it to 
Mike 
Pastujov. 
Mike’s here and 
we actually have 
it sorted... it’s like a two-on-one 
down low, so his defenseman is 

here and they don’t have a guy 
back. 
Pearson: Jack just sneaks in 
here and they have two guys that 
come back too hard. Beecher’s 

drifted into this position. Sort of 
this lane or gap here. Mikey sees 
it and (Summers) just finds the 
open ice, and comes in here and 
does it. 
Pearson: 
But 
he’s 
aware 
because he is the fourth guy up on 
the rush, but he’s not. He doesn’t 
get too involved and then when 
he sees Mike actually have some 
time and space, he jumps into a 
lane and a hole there. I mean it’s a 
really good shot so like I said, the 
important thing is you know they 
stayed after the puck, these two 
guys. Jack is patient. He doesn’t 
jump in too soon to close down 
the lane or jump into coverage. 
Pearson: A lot of times, we 
shrink the zone too much for 
a defenseman, so they’ll move 

down into coverage. You know, 
if he does get a pass like this, 
they got a guy right here and he 
blocks so that you don’t have any 
room. He was more patient. The 

coverage shrunk down on Becker 
here and when it comes to him, 
he’s got time and space to shoot 
it. So it’s a good play.
TMD: How hard of a read is 
that 
for 
Mike 
Pastujov 
to 
make?
Pearson: 
It was a lot of 
things 
going 
on. And I think 
first, he had to 
get the puck and 
then get his head 
up in order to 
realize he had 
time and space. 
Then once you 
get that, Mike’s really good. He’s 
got really good hockey vision and 

sense, which you can’t teach. You 
try to work on it, but it’s hard to 
teach. I think it just wasn’t easy 
for him, but wasn’t the hardest, 
hardest play. It’s sort of mid-

level, you know. Toughness and 
understanding 
about 
what’s 
going on on the ice, who’s open 
and and then you have to make 
the play too. You have to execute. 
I mean, we had 
a 
three-on-one. 
You 
can 
tell 
when they don’t 
make 
the 
play, 
it’s a bad pass or 
something. Mike 
makes a good pass 
there. And that’s 
the other thing 
I mean, there’s a 
good shot, but it 
was a good pass. 
A nice pass where 
he put it in an area where Jack 
could just one-time it.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | OCTOBER 23, 2019

I 

told Tinder I was bisexual before I 
told my mom.
This was three weeks ago now. 
After deleting and redownloading the app 
for what must have been the tenth time, I 
began typing the shorthand “bi” into my 
bio. I had mentally prepared for an hour, 
repeating over and over that this was right, 
that this was what I wanted. The “b” came 
with ease. One letter down, one to go. 
Then, my thumb recoiled, hovering over 
the “i” like a claw machine waiting to wrap 
its metal fingers around a prize. All I had 
to do was push the red button on the joy-
stick. But a cold burning in my stomach 
stopped me from finishing the word.
It took years to even get to that moment. 
I wish I could say I knew I was bi since I 
could walk. Unfortunately, I wasn’t afford-
ed that level of personal understanding. 
Throughout high school, parents, teachers 
and friends alike assumed if I was any-
thing, it definitely wasn’t straight. I always 
auditioned for school plays. I vehemently 
shopped in the women’s clothing section. 
I would spot my friend Michael from the 
end of the hall, run towards him, and jump 
into his arms before class. In our hetero-
normative society, I was an outlier.

Whenever I heard that someone thought 
I wasn’t straight, I was compelled to prove 
them wrong. Instead of exuding main-
stream masculinity, I leaned even heavier 
into their assumptions, being as boisterous 
and goony as possible. I wanted to prove 
I could be an outlier while still claiming 
I was heterosexual, that two sides of the 
spectrum aren’t mutually exclusive. 
A friend once told me I was “the most 
queer straight guy” she knew. From that 
day on, I told myself that’s what I was.
At the beginning of this semester, I was 
on the bus heading back from North to Cen-
tral Campus, chatting with a new friend 
from class. She was a freshman and wanted 
to get involved in some LGBTQIA clubs.
“Can I ask you a personal question?,” she 
asked.
I choked out an affirmative response, 
beads of sweat lining my hairline. I knew 
what was coming.
“Are you queer?”
I almost said yes. A gut instinct tried to 
take over and all of the questions I have 
asked myself about my history with my 
queer identity flooded in. Why is my favor-
ite Frank Ocean song “Good Guy”? Why 
did I pour over the written exchanges 

between 
Allen 
Ginsberg 
and Neal Cassady, soaked in 
repressed male love? Why 
was I so inspired by Amy in 
“Booksmart” coming out as 
gay when she was in the 10th 
grade? 
At the last second, my 
defenses kicked in.
“Nah, I’m not.”
For the rest of the bus ride 
home, I could feel my quick-
ening heartbeat reverberat-
ing in the pit of my stomach. 
This feeling is familiar; it 
happens about four or five 
times a week at this point. I 
feel it whenever I see a couple 
holding hands, or embracing 
each other before they part 
ways for class, or laughing 
together over steaming cups 
of coffee while I study a few 
tables away. Any act of pub-
lic intimacy makes me shrink 
inside my garish outfit of the day.
While I continued to make small talk 
with my new friend and give her what 
little advice I could about how to find 
clubs, I could only concentrate on my 
stomach pains. There were no couples 
in sight, no interwoven fingers dangling 
between the felt-covered seats, no Face-
Time conversations about how each oth-
ers’ days went, and yet I could hardly 
breathe.
For the following weeks — even while 
writing this article — I teared up every 
time I thought about that moment on the 
bus. I could have confirmed my identity 
to someone else on my own terms. No 
rumors echoing down the long, third-
mortgage-gray high school hallways, 
just an earnest question from a new-
found friend. I was given the opportu-
nity to share a moment of intimacy with 
another person and, instead, I threw it 
away. I was ashamed and wouldn’t let 
myself forget it.
But even if I had said, “Yes, I am queer 
and I’m goddamn proud of it,” it wouldn’t 
have mattered because I hadn’t told myself 
yet.
Embracing who you really are takes 

insurmountable faith and self-confidence. 
Convincing myself I was straight for so 
long meant, when it finally came down 
to being proud of my bisexuality, I had 
to reckon with the years I spent denying 
myself happiness and self-love. There’s a 
healthy amount of guilt in this too. How 
could I have given into peer pressure and 
heteronormativity, purposely sabotaging 
any chances of being myself?
In her book “All About Love: New 
Visions”, author bell hooks writes, “Giving 
ourselves love we provide our inner being 
with the opportunity to have the uncondi-
tional love we may have always longed to 
receive from someone else … When we give 
this precious gift to ourselves, we are able 
to reach out to others from a place of fulfill-
ment and not from a place of lack.” 
Rapper Kendrick Lamar confirms this 
sentiment in his song “Real” with the line, 
“What love got to do with it when you don’t 
love yourself?” 
I have my stomach aches to thank for 
clueing me in to my bisexuality. I do believe 
hooks and Lamar are right when they say 
the acts of loving yourself and loving others 
are inseparable. If my stomach turns when 
I see public displays of affection, a healthy 
dose of self-love will do more than a Tums. 
Being honest with myself about my sexual-
ity is a good first step. 
Weeks after that fateful afternoon on the 
blue bus from North to Central, I waited for 
the “i” in my Tinder bio. But frankly, I was 
tired of waiting. I’d spent too many years 
waiting. As I took a deep breath and typed 
the word “bi” in my Tinder bio, I felt a 
surge of warmth from my stomach to every 
extremity. If the shoe fits … 
While reading over this piece just a 
few days ago, making sure every word got 
across what I was trying to say, I listened to 
the new Avett Brothers album. My dad had 
recommended it, claiming it was “excep-
tional” and “def worth the time.” On the 
second track, the Brothers sing, “Tell the 
truth to yourself / and the rest will fall in 
place.”
I stopped editing and grinned like an 
idiot into my reflection in my coffee. Here’s 
everything falling into place.

Waiting for the “i”

BY MATT HARMON, DEPUTY STATEMENT EDITOR


I 

should have gone for the easy recipe. I should 
have listened to Ina Garten’s signature quip — 
“store bought is fine.” Had I added the adjective, 
“beginner,” in the google search bar, my Sunday would 
have likely been much less involved. 
But I couldn’t seem to help myself. When I opened 
my browser, I wasn’t thinking about my technical 
ability, or the fact that every time I make mac and 
cheese, the pot of water bubbles over.
Perhaps my overconfidence was a consequence of 
watching one too many YouTube episodes of Clare 
Saffitz’s, “Gourmet Makes.” Saffitz’s candid approach 
to reverse engineering Sour Patch Kids or Twinkies 
make cooking seem meditative. A sort of “anything 
goes” outlook where when you add too much milk to 
that bechamel, you just whisk in more cream. Oh, how 
naïve I was.
I

t was one of those drizzly September afternoons 
described by local weatherman as “scattered 
showers.” The type of forecast that offers no 
insight whatsoever and subsequently makes you 
question the usefulness of anchormen waving their 
arms in front of a radar map.
The brisk air had flipped the page to the season of 
burning your tongue on hot tea and cringing from the 
sensation of slipping on jeans again. 
An unexpected urge to bake a pie simmered inside 
of me. Once my eyes devoured the golden crackle of 
Bon Appetit “Best Apple 
Pie,” I knew I could stop my 
recipe search. I had found 
the pie. All it took was that 
cover photo. It was the sort 
of pie whose crust looked 
like it was kissed by mother 
nature.
I wandered downstairs 
to recruit a sous-chef … my 
mom. I knew her years of 
peeling apples for my school 
lunchbox would be essential 
to my success. It had taken 
me so long to peel a golden 
delicious apple the night 
before, that my dad had 
boiled a tea kettle before I 
finished.
When my mom nodded 
her head and granted me 
access to the kitchen, I was 
giddy. What could be more 
quintessential than a mother 
and daughter baking a pie? 
It was a moment cut straight 
from 
the 
Mrs. 
March’s 
kitchen 
in 
the 
“Little 
Women” playbook. 
A 

scan of our pantry 
confirmed 
my 
suspicions 
— 
we 
are not a baking family. No 
mason jars clouded with 
flour ready for measuring 
when an inclination to bake 
strikes. It seemed the only 
head start I was getting were 
the expired sugar crystals at 
the bottom of the Domino 

tub from last year’s holiday sugar cookies.
A trip to the grocery store was necessary. While 
strolling the aisles, I came to realize the complexity 
of the recipe I had selected. This should have been 
obvious with the first item on the ingredient list — 
vanilla bean pods. Not vanilla extract, the actual pods. 
A 10-minute scavenger hunt through the produce 
section led me to the vanilla bean pods — located 
right above shitake mushrooms priced at $6.99 for 
two pods. That was the only sign I needed to tell me I 
am going to skip the step of scraping the seeds of the 
vanilla pod to infuse apple cider. 
And then came the next item, cardamom. My fifth-
grade history class interactive activity about the Silk 
Road and the spice trade had not prepared for me for 
the sticker shock, nearly $11. I was beginning to think 
that homemade was not necessarily cheaper in the 
realm of baked goods. I decided to pursue my backup 
plan and head to the bulk foods aisle where I scooped 
a spoonful of spices into a plastic bag and sheepishly 
headed to the cashier. I am pretty sure I paid more for 
the plastic baggy than the spice itself. It was time to 
head back to the kitchen. 
W

e decided to divide and conquer — my 
mom would make the apple filling and I 
would make the pie crust. In all honesty, 
this decision was driven more by poor apple-peeling 
skills than cooking efficiency. As I began to combine 

the butter and flour, it became clear to me why people 
buy the neat Pillsbury pie crust instead. I was staring 
at a bowl of crumbles; the dough was not dough. It 
was a pebbly bowl that, no matter how much I mixed, 
refused to form. My mom was humming along, and I 
started to worry that we were going to end up making 
applesauce instead of pie. No dough meant no pie. 
So, I mashed the bits of dough rounds together 
and prayed that the carefully timed choreography of 
chilling the dough in the fridge, then the freezer, the 
room temperature would yield something rollable. 
T

he pie took much longer than anticipated. I 
credit this to my failure to read through the 
recipe before deciding to commit. Vanilla 
beans? Cardamon? Three hours of chilling? I guess 
this is the life of an apple pie baker. 
But, in the whirlwind of expensive ingredients, 
pebbled dough and a carefully timed dance of setting, 
heating and cooling, a pie came out of the oven. After a 
week of exams, there was something satisfying about 
spending an entire afternoon doing something that 
could be gone in a couple bites. 
While I should have probably heeded my mom’s 
advice and added that adjective “beginner” to my 
recipe search, there is something to be said for going 
for the romance of an oozy, delicious, crystallized pie. 
Apple crumble just wasn’t going to cut it that rainy 
afternoon.

I

’ve always liked to think I’d know what to do during 
an apocalypse. 
I read exclusively dystopian novels growing up 
— Divergent, Delirium, The Hunger Games, The Maze 
Runner, The City of Ember, The 5th Wave, Station Eleven, 
The Handmaid’s Tale — so I figured I was well-read on the 
subject. Through these books, I thought I already knew how 
it felt to experience societal collapse — the rush of surviving 
the initial fall, defending myself with a weapon I found on 
the street, running from the zombies or possessed humans 
or crazed religious extremists, the secret escape plan, the 
group of unlikely friends, the inevitable unknown. It was 
interesting, traumatic, exhilarating.
At least, I thought this was how it would unfold. Then I 
learned about climate change.
The real-life apocalypse doesn’t happen all at once; instead 
of using gas and a lighter, we’ve set the world on fire with a 
single spark that’s grown too large for us to escape. It’s just 
subtle enough that it’s never urgent or breaking news. We 
think we can sweep it under a rug, turn around to focus on 
something else, and before we know it we’re trapped in the 
flames.
I recently tried rekindling my love for dystopian novels 
with a book called “History of Bees”, which describes a 
future after our bees become extinct. I would spoil it and 
say it doesn’t end well for humans, but I couldn’t even get 
through the first chapter describing a woman pollinating 
crops by hand to survive. Just thinking about this not-so-
dystopian future felt like its own act of labor. 
The book still sits on my shelf as a reminder, or maybe a 
threat. It’s hard not to feel personally responsible for climate 
change when I know humans are the direct cause. Today, 
extreme weather is the most common way people experience 
climate change, but the under-the-rug crisis could arguably 
be more alarming. We’ve killed 50 percent of the world’s 
coral in the last three decades. Sea levels are rising. The 
Arctic is rapidly warming. We rely on bees to pollinate crops 
for 90 percent of the world, but 
environmental changes 
are making them die faster.
While 
we’ve 
been 
policing 
ourselves 
to 
do 
better 
with 
our 
vegan 
diets 
and sustainable clothing 
brands, 71 percent of global 
carbon 
emissions 
since 
1988 are directly linked 
to just 100 firms. Climate 
activists are quite literally 
carrying the burden of the 
world on their shoulders, 
shouting at each other at 
rallies to do more 

and do better, when the biggest culprit of climate change is 
systemic greed. It’s the CEOs who refuse to sacrifice revenue 
for sustainable practices, the government officials who make 
it easier for firms to pollute with minimal consequences, 
and the universities (including the University of Michigan) 
that still have over $1 billion invested in fossil fuels despite 
students calling for action.
Climate change will affect younger and minority 
populations more than it will affect the older and richer, 
who are typically the drivers of the crisis. Those in power 
have no reason to limit carbon emissions this year, or any 
year before the crisis is irreversible in 2030, as they will 
either be gone or rich enough to still live comfortably. The 
rest of us become fighting crayfish in an aquarium, while the 
culprits watch us drown from the other side of the glass.
Thinking about all of this on a daily basis really does 
feel like drowning. Is the crisis out of my hands, or is it my 
responsibility to somehow hold those in power accountable 
for their actions? How do I even do that?
Greta Thunberg, 16-year-old environmental activist 
from Sweden, calls for us to be angry, to skip school and 
fight, while others say to start preparing for our inevitable 
indolence. It seems like everyone and no one is talking about 
it simultaneously — climate change wasn’t mentioned once 
during the Democratic presidential debate in October but 
it’s all I see when I open my Twitter feed or talk with my 
friends.

OUR 
RESOURCES 
ARE 
DIMINISHING, 
THE 
GOVERNMENT IS IN SHAMBLES, AND CLIMATE 
CHANGE IS MAKING THE SEASONS MORE EXTREME. 
WELCOME TO THE APOCALYPSE!
I 

made a rule with my roommate that we can only have 
“nihilist hours” after midnight. Every night, we go 
through the same routine: she comes home from class, 
I put on Maggie Rogers and scratch her head while she lays 
in my lap, and one of us usually has an existential crisis to 
discuss. Which, without fail, will bring us to climate change.
We both have a bad habit of referencing the issue at 
inappropriate times. “I’d love to travel more when I retire. 
Too bad we’ll all be gone from climate change,” she’ll say. “I 
wonder what my kids would be like, you know, if we 
actually had time to raise kids,” I’ll say.
“Bringing another human into the world 
is the worst thing you can do for the 
environment,” we both joke. But it isn’t 
really a joke.
To save our mental health, I made a 
rule that we could only save this mindset 
for after midnight. Neither 
of us obey it very well.
The more I learned 
about 
climate 
change, the more 
I 
felt 
myself 
subconsciously 
dissociating 

from things that brought me joy. I convinced myself that 
because I wouldn’t have a future, I didn’t need to form new 
relationships or continue my passions. I regretted trying so 
hard in the past. The threat surrounded me so frequently 
that I believed the world would start burning at any given 
moment, and the only way I could cope was making dark, 
nothing-matters-anymore comments in person and on social 
media that concerned everyone around me.
I thought it would be better this way, to protect myself 
from forming close relationships or finding a new passion or 
getting married and having kids. After all, the more you have 
before the apocalypse, the more you have to lose when it hits. 
(Or at least that’s what happened in The Handmaid’s Tale.)
But it’s possible that climate change won’t affect our 
generation until the end of our lifetimes, so why was it 
bothering me now?
I’m not alone in feeling this “eco-anxiety” — young people 
all over the country are choosing not to have kids because 
of climate change. Some are dropping everything to become 
climate activists and others are somewhere stuck in the 
middle, like myself and my roommate.
She expressed to me recently, “I have nowhere to relieve 
my anger, my sadness, my disappointment, my dread, and my 
fear. We don’t have systems set up to help us process that.”
Other students at the University of Michigan feel similarly 
— Music, Theatre & Dance senior Alissa Martin feels a 
looming guilt that she must constantly be learning about and 
working against climate change.
“It feels like my generation’s responsibility to turn the 
crisis around, but it’s a responsibility none of us asked for, 
and the stakes are so high that the pressure can be truly 
taxing,” Martin said. “To be completely honest, when I start 
thinking about the future of the planet, I often shut down the 
thoughts because it’s overwhelming — and then immediately 
feel horrible for doing so. It feels like avoiding the elephant 
in the room in favor of smaller, more immediate stressors.”
But even those who do make the effort to learn about the 
crisis are still burdened with the same anxieties; Martin 
considered dropping her environmental studies class this 
semester because the depressing statistics were so mentally 
exhausting.
Learning about the end of the world can be especially 
draining for those majoring in environmental studies and 
are faced with this reality every day in and out of their 
classes. Evan Hammon and Camilla Lizundia, both seniors 
studying Program in the Environment, agreed they found it 
difficult to stay hopeful for rapid change. Yet, despite it all, 
they’re both able to cultivate love and joy.
“My mind can often spiral,” Lizundia said. “But with 

darkness, there is light. The irony is that if our world was 
not in peril, I wouldn’t seek to see the beauty that still exists. 
The trees speak to me, and their voices give me hope in my 
moments of despair. They cleanse my soul and restore my 
power to persist in achieving positive climate action.”
Hammon remarked how important it is to him to look 
for the beauty in his friends, the 
earth and strong leaders that 
are working to make a positive 
impact. 
Other 
students 
expressed 
similar methods of healing: LSA 
senior Alexandra Niforos said 
she tries to maximize her time 
doing the things she loves. Hailey 
Martin, a sophomore at Loyola 
University Chicago, decided to 
stop feeling guilty and channel 
her fear into making a more 
sustainable lifestyle. Veronica 
Stafford, 
a 
senior 
studying 
chemistry at Stanford University, 
has started to focus on her 
appreciation for the resources we 
have rather than what we’ve lost.
Hearing from these students 
has 
made 
me 
understand 
something my existential dread 
wasn’t ready to grasp: You can’t 
stop living because you’re afraid 
of dying. In fact, it just might be 
the reason to lean into love more 
than ever.
W

hat I loved most 
about dystopian novels wasn’t 
experiencing the apocalypse itself, but the 
intense passion the characters found despite the complete 
inversion of society. Every book had a love storyline: Katniss 
and Peeta in The Hunger Games, who chose each other 
when they were supposed to be hunting each other; Lina and 
Alex in Delirium, who hid their relationship from a society 
where love is prohibited; Evan in The 5th Wave, who falls for 
Cassie despite being possessed by an alien who wants to kill 
her; Kirsten in Station Eleven, who pursues her passion for 
theatre by performing Shakespeare plays even after the flu 
wipes out the population.
Though reading these novels didn’t tactically prepare me 
for how to survive the apocalypse, they did teach me the 
importance of love and relationships in unsettling times. 

My roommate once told me we need to be around people 
who are just as confused as we are to survive. I think she’s 
right. Love is what’s left even after everything else is gone, 
and cultivating that joy in the age of climate change is in 
itself an act of resistance.
This resistance is just as much about relationships as it is 
about self-love. Our practices should be sustainable both for 
the environment and for ourselves; in the same way eating 
red meat isn’t sustainable for the environment, nihilistic 
thoughts aren’t progressive for our well-being. It only 
distances ourselves from the real impact we could have if we 
could recognize ourselves as more than just a crayfish in a 
tank.
I’m inspired by the incredible youth advancements in 
climate activism. In addition to Greta Thunberg’s huge 
impact, Liza Goldberg, a high school senior, is working at 
NASA to map out the global effects of climate change. Young 
activists of color are fighting climate change and advocating 
for marginalized communities: Jamie Margolin, a queer, 
Jewish, Latina activist is working for indigenous rights 
and against the destruction of the Amazon rainforest; Isra 
Hirsi, the 16-year-old daughter of U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, 
D-Minneapolis, is working as the co-executive director of 
the U.S. Youth Climate Strike; and Mari Copeny, a 12-year-
old activist from Flint is bringing attention to the water 
crisis and the systemic effects of environmental racism. 
These are just a few names of hundreds, if not thousands, 
who give me hope.
For the rest of us who can’t 
completely devote our lives to 
climate activism, education 
will make us more powerful, 
despite how difficult it is to 
digest the information. We 
can change your actions on a 
small scale. Nature can heal 
us while it’s still here.
I often find myself saying 
I’m “burned out.” Burned out 
from imagining a hopeless 
future, burned out from not 
knowing how to fix things, 
burned out from scrolling 
through Twitter until my 
thumbs are sore. 
But 
the 
sensation 
of 
“burning” is one rooted in 
passion. As the ethereal 
witch goddess and singer-
songwriter Maggie Rogers 
sings in “Burning, “And if 
you’re giving up, would you 
tell me? / I’m gonna keep 
this love if you let me. In 
the chorus, she belts, Let 
me help you open up / I’m 
in love, I’m alive / Oh, I’m 
burning.”
In a time when everything seems to be on fire, it is 
healing to focus on the good kinds of burning. The burning 
passion. The burning love. The burning hope. Even burning 
discomfort can be a sign of growth.
So, if you’re going to be making any lifestyle changes 
because of climate change, make sure you harvest this 
sustainable burning. Keep that love and hold it close. Lean 
into your relationships and the things that bring you joy. 
Plant the seeds now and watch them grow while they’re able. 
And if the apocalypse really does come, someday, then let 
it come knowing you’ve loved — and lost — as much as you 
possibly can. Because that will be the only way to prepare.

M

y mom was standing on the front 
lawn of my best friend’s house sur-
rounded by hundreds of other par-
ents. I rushed into her arms, glad to be in the 
safety of her care. News helicopters whirred 
overhead as they passed through the grey sky, its 
dourness casting a shadow over the whole day. 
We were being evacuated from school, and being 
only in fourth grade at the time, I had no idea 
why. All I knew was that the quaint world of 
suburban New Jersey was no longer a safe place 
of serenity and security.
That day, 10 years ago, was the day the pas-
tor of my church, Father Ed, was found dead 
in the church rectory. He had been stabbed 43 
times, though my parents didn’t 
tell me that at the time. For 
the first few days after his 
death, I thought he died 
of natural causes, like 
all the old people in my 
town. There hadn’t been 
a murder in Chatham in 
over 50 years, and surely my 
Catholic school wasn’t the 
place for that trend 
to be broken. 
But, unfor-
tunately, 
it 
was. 

That holy site — the center of my faith and moral 
creed — was violated. 
The santicity of the church was destroyed in 
that instant, its status as a place of comfort for-
ever lost. The man who was the gatekeeper of 
that community was taken from us. It seemed 
like no one was protecting its status as a place 
to feel in the presence of God. The one man in 
my life who I truly believed was devoted to God 
with all of his heart, and took that commitment 
as a priest seriously, was no longer there to pro-
vide me guidance. I truly thought he was God’s 
shepherd, leading his flock to the path of righ-
teousness. 
When he spoke on issues of Catholic morality, 
I felt he had full credibility. There was no out-
ward hint of hypocrisy, either in his intensity or 
his actions. Hearing him speak, I felt like I could 
actually follow God’s path and devote myself to 
Him. Without that voice in my life, the spiritual 
journey felt far lonelier and more difficult. How 
could I follow Christ if God took away from me 
the only holy man I knew? How could God let 
a good man who had done nothing wrong die a 
horrible death?
And so began my path of disillusionment with 
the Church, his death sparking a long chain 
of events that would seemingly pull me 
further away from my spiritual commit-
ments. What made Father Ed such a won-
derful man was not just his enlightening 
sermons; he put his homilies in succinct, 
clear terms that any follower could 
understand. While I certainly appreci-
ated the fact that Father Ed always had 
me home from Mass in under an 
hour, I felt like a shorter Mass 
allowed me a stronger grasp on 
the meaning of that day’s read-
ings. 
Soon after his death, Mass 
became longer, the homilies more 
drawn out, the singing more fre-
quent and seemingly extraneous. 
Even worse, the Vatican changed 
many of the responses in 2011 with 
an update to the Roman Missal, 
the series of sayings and responses 
that guide the Mass. Ironically, 
the Church was trying to make the 
responses more in line with the 
traditional Latin Mass, but instead 
it made the Mass harder to follow 
and it alienated people like me from 
participating. We now had to say 
“And with your spirit” in response 
to the priest saying “May the Lord 
be with you,” instead of respond-
ing “And also with you.” The Mass 
I had grown to look forward to had 
changed, adding insult to the injury 
of no longer hearing from 
Father Ed. The meaning of 
the Mass became muddled, 

and I was no longer as receptive to the speaker, 
since Father Ed wasn’t the one standing at the 
lectern.
The situation became much worse when I 
went to high school. I was separated from my 
tight-knit Catholic community for the first time 
since preschool and now attended school where 
most people were not Catholic and sometimes 
outwardly hostile to religion. In my 11th-grade 
world history class, we had to read a book in 
which the author argued that religion was just 
an ideology to bind people together; it had no 
higher moral purpose or reason for existence. I 
tried to argue that religion helped fill in the gaps 
for what science could not easily explain, like 
what existed before the universe was formed. 
The only person who came to my side argued not 
in favor of religion but by using a scientific argu-
ment. 
People tried to undercut my beliefs by using 
quotes from the Bible and arguing that Christi-
anity was just another system built to oppress 
women. Arguing in favor of my faith became a 
lonely fight, and it seemed like I never had a good 
answer. This was a situation where Father Ed 
surely would have known what to say.
It didn’t help that my process for receiving 
Confirmation had very little religious content. 
Instead of taking religion classes every Sunday, 
my church mandated an all-weekend retreat, 
which we spent mostly singing non-Catholic 
songs and eating candy. I was hungry for how my 
faith could add deeper meaning to my life, but 
instead, I felt unprepared to commit to the Cath-
olic Church as an adult. 
I wanted to answer the most pressing ques-
tion: How do I apply my faith to the challenges 
of modern life? I tried to answer that question 
myself by spending nearly 30 minutes in confes-
sion during that part of the retreat, harkening 
back to my fifth-grade days when I tried to be 
the last one to leave our quiet reflection time. 
But this time, I didn’t seem to find that meaning 
in my reflection. Instead, I felt empty.
Nowadays, there seem to be few links tying 
me to the Church. Sure, I still attend Mass, but 
only on the big holidays like Christmas and Eas-
ter, and mostly out of tradition. Last year was the 
first time I truly gave up something for Lent in a 
while. The pain of not being able to enjoy all of 
the great cuisine Ann Arbor had to offer, while 
strong, offered me the first deep connection to 
my faith in a long time. I felt like I truly made a 
commitment, and stuck to it for once, something 
I had lost in the mad dash of life. 
While I am hopeful this will one day lead 
me to commit more to my Catholic faith, those 
issues with the Mass remain, and every day it 
gets harder and harder to commit myself to the 
Church. Though I may not attend church much 
anymore, I still try to have the moral code of 
Catholicism guide me, even if I often fail miser-
ably. I just hope holy people like Father Ed can 
one day forgive me.

D

uring exam season last semester, 
I was chatting with my friends 
Kartik and Nav in a café. We were 
talking about finding time to meet up over 
the summer. Kartik, always up for sponta-
neous plans, joked that he and I could bike 
from Ann Arbor to visit Nav at her house in 
Saginaw. Nav and I gave a passive chuckle 
and nodded to his idea, and I returned to 
my hometown north of Chicago with the 
understanding that no such trip was going to 
happen. I mean, who would bike 103 miles — 
206 miles counting the ride back — in mostly 
unknown, rural areas just to hang out with 
your friends for a day?
After coming back home, I was sitting in 
my basement on a yoga exercise ball starting 
an essay that was due the following morning 
when I got a text from Kartik. It read, “Let 
me know when you’d like to begin planning 
the trip.”
It would be a lie if I said I was totally 
confident in our ability to bike over a hun-
dred miles in one day and do it again a day 
later, but I went along with the plan anyway. 
There was something exhilarating about 
the idea of a bike ride across a state I’d only 
been living in for about a year. It’s easy to 
stay within the comfort that a college town 
like Ann Arbor provides, but a journey like 
this would widen our perspective of Michi-
gan and the Michiganders who live beyond 
Washtenaw County. Besides, there weren’t 
any direct buses, and it would at the very 
least be a killer workout and a great way to 
strengthen my bonds with close friends.
We typed in Nav’s address on Google Maps 
and found a feasible route from Kartik’s 
house to Saginaw. We couldn’t see all of the 
roads on Street View, but since the app had 
a bike route option, we trusted the algorithm 
would direct us to ride on the flattest paved 
roads possible. It was hard to determine how 
much supplies we would need to survive a 
day trip in which we would likely burn thou-
sands of calories, but I figured that a handful 
of energy bars, a couple of Gatorade bottles, 
a half-dozen bagels and a jar of peanut but-
ter would suffice. After two train rides from 
Chicago with Metra and Amtrak conductors 
eyeing me with distaste for taking up seats 
with my bike, I arrived in Ann Arbor on June 
20, ready to bike over a hundred miles. 
We were up at 6 a.m. the next day. We 
wanted to cover as much ground as we could 
in the light, and we estimated we’d be biking 
about 10 to 11 miles an hour, which would 
get us to Saginaw before 7 p.m. The start of 
the journey was slow, as we configured our 
phones to save the route and speak to us 
through our headphones. After passing the 
Diag and the League and taking a few turns, 
we were biking downhill heading west from 

the hospital. I stood up on my 
pedals to enjoy the breeze, and 
as I swung my head around to 
make sure Kartik was follow-
ing, I saw him standing over his 
bike squinting at his phone in 
his hand. I turned around to see 
what was up. 
“I think we missed a turn,” he 
said.
“Where?” I responded. I went 
up to his side and squinted with 
him. If we kept going down 
the hill, we would’ve run into 
a dead end about a mile later. I 
looked west toward where the 
route pointed and saw a small 
paved black trail that led into a 
forest clearing. It seemed a little 
sketchy, but since we had decided 
to trust the minds behind Google 
Maps to keep us on the right 
path, we had no other option. 
Those 
early 
frustrating 
moments served as a micro-
cosm of the entire trip — every 
few miles, we would miss a 
turn and have to pause to check 
where Google wanted us to go. 
At times Kartik would stop in the middle of 
an intersection to check, and I would have to 
gesture for him to come to the side and get 
out of the way of traffic. Soon after our hos-
pital debacle, we biked a few miles alongside 
Argo Cascades, a set of small interconnected 
waterfalls flowing into the Huron River. 
Though I had been to the Nichols Arbore-
tum, I didn’t know Ann Arbor had such a 
calm natural site just beyond Kerrytown. 
We paused to take a few photos before con-
tinuing on our way. 
About six miles later, the serene trail 
opened up onto Whitmore Lake Road, and it 
was here that I learned that all of my elemen-
tary school geography teachers lied to me for 
years about the Midwest being “pancake 
flat.” A more apt name for the road would’ve 
been Whitmore Hills as there was no flat 
pavement at all. Each time we somehow 
pushed ourselves up one steep hill, we would 
spot another five awaiting us with gradual 
downhills in between. Our legs grew heavier 
with each rotation. We stopped to rest at the 
top of one hill, which happened to be next to 
a cemetery. I took out my water bottle and 
lay down on the grass, imagining my fourth-
grade geography teacher, Ms. Pemble, bury-
ing me there under a mound of dirt.
After a few more miles on Whitmore 
Lake, we took our planned stop at a gas sta-
tion to use the bathroom and to learn that we 
were about 30 minutes behind schedule. We 
pushed ourselves to try and catch up, attack-

ing each hill with double the resolve. That 
resolve didn’t matter once we turned the 
corner onto Kearney Road and found our-
selves on a dirt road with our tires caked in 
wet mud from a rain shower the day before. 
While my bike was a hybrid designed for 
both road and off-road situations, Kartik’s 
was a racing bike meant exclusively for pave-
ment, so we pedaled slowly and just walked 
whenever we encountered a hill. He had to 
stop a couple of times to clear up the mud 
that clogged the space between the bike 
frame and his tires.
While we were taking a break on the 
side of the road at one corner, a red pickup 
truck rounding the turn slowed down as it 
approached us. We hadn’t seen a house for at 
least a couple of miles and were surrounded 
by trees. Plenty of cars had passed us, but 
none of the drivers ever stopped to interact 
with us. “Well,” I thought, “I’ve had a good 
life.” We must be trespassing or something. 
There’s no way that an Indian American and 
an Indian are going to be received well in the 
middle of nowhere. 
Once the truck came to our side, the driv-
er pulled down the window and peered out 
at us. “You guys OK? You need anything?” I 
saw concern in his eyes but was too stunned 
to reply, so Kartik thanked him and told him 
we were all good and just taking a break. He 
nodded and drove on, slinging mud back 
with his truck’s tires.
This hospitality was one of the few con-

sistent traits we encountered on our trip. 
Whenever we stopped to take a break or 
reevaluate our route along the side of the 
road, instead of being met with hostility, we 
encountered strangers who shouted friendly 
or supportive remarks at us. One woman in 
Howell asked us if we wanted any water as 
she saw us wheezing after walking up one 
hill. Another parked his car a few hundred 
yards ahead of us and ran over to us, offer-
ing to help us repair our bikes. Every truck 
driver helped me understand that, contrary 
to the popular narrative, those who don’t 
live in cities or suburban communities aren’t 
automatically hateful or ignorant. You’d 
think that being in unfamiliar territory in 
rural Michigan would unsettle me, but the 
longer we spent biking through fields and 
farm territory, the more comfortable I felt as 
Michiganders welcomed us with open arms. 
By six o’clock, we had just passed through 
Howell, then Durand and still had over 
30 miles separating us from Saginaw. We 
invoked the backup plan and called Nav 
to see if she could pick us up. The clouds 
seemed to pop out of the sky when we saw 
her van pull up beside us. Having a friend 
support you is great, but you really feel hum-
bled after she saves your life and her family 
welcomes you into her home after a sweaty 
60-mile bike ride.
