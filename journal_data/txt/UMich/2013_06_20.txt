Football seniors ready to lead team134

eekly Summer Edition MichiganDaily.com

By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Writer
By now you know the story.
Last summer, the Michi-
gan football team traveled to
Southern California for a lead-
ership weekend - a chance for
the seniors to grow off the field.
And Michigan coach Brady Hoke
was so happy with the results that
he decided to do it again.
So, during the first weekend in
June, Hoke took his small senior
class out west where the players
trained with the U.S. Navy SEALs
and hosted a youth football camp
in Pasadena. The Wolverines also
visited the Rose Bowl - the BCS
Bowl where the Big Ten champion
plays - allowing the seniors to
visualize the goal they've held
since they put on their wingtip
helmets for the first time.
"The weekend allowed us to
grow closer as a senior class,"
said senior cornerback Court-
ney Avery. "It seemed like we
discussed virtually everything.
So with our entire class having
identical goals and identical
methods on how to reach those
goals, this will allow our mes-
sage to be clear for our under-
classmen.
"This trip provided us with
the opportunity to escape our
daily routine and familiar envi-
ronment in Ann Arbor in order
to come together to create the
blue print for our upcoming
season."
But why is the story worth
repeating?
Team 134's senior class is
only made up of 13 fourth and
fifth-year scholarship players,
and with punter Will Hagerup's
yearlong suspension, just 12
scholarship seniors will dress
on Saturdays this season. The

trip to California helped ease
Hoke's worry about a small
senior class, and has left him
banking on quality making up
for quantity.
"There's a lot of vital things
when it comes to handling the
leadership," Hoke said a few
weeks ago to mlive.com. "The
biggest part of it is those seniors
putting on a camp. They're the
ones who have to run it. They
run the administration, they
run the execution of it, organi-
zation, and that's a project for
them that they've got to learn
how to motivate, hot to teach
and hot to communicate."
Added Avery: "Even though
we only have 13 seniors, this
will not affect the leadership
on this team. We have a lot of
underclassmen (that) work
hard and have proven them-
selves as being leaders. The
trip has already shown positive
effects since our senior class
is closer than ever and since
everyone embraces the same
goal and the same vision for the
season."
With the graduation of cap-
tains Denard Robinson and
Jordan Kovacs - now with
the Jacksonville Jaguars and
Miami Dolphins, respectively
- a significant leadership void
has been left behind. But like
last season, several senior lead-
ers stood out to the third-year
coach.
"(Safety) Thomas Gordon
is a guy who has gained a lot
of confidence," Hoke said. "I
think (wide receiver) Jeremy
Gallon is a guy that's continued
to grow, and that's important."
Added Gordon: "We as
seniors have to step up, and I'm
one of those. I think there were
opportunities to show leader-

Redshirt senior Thomas Gordon and the other 11 football seniors took Brady Hoke's second-annual leadership trip to Southern
California to train with Navy SEALs.

ship, and I became a little more
comfortable in that role after
this trip."
Hoke also made mention of
"obvious" leaders such as left
tackle Taylor Lewan, an early
projected top pick " in next
year's NFL draft, who was
just named No. 11 on Sporting
News's Top-25 college football
players for 2013.
There's also redshirt junior
quarterback Devin Gardner,
who has the possibility of being
the first non-senior captain
since former offensive lineman
Jake Long in 2006. Despite the
team having not yet selected
its captains, both Lewan and

Gardner are expected to lead
Michigan both on and off the
field, and will do so behind
their strong leadership.
"It's been a process," Gordon
said. "We started this in Janu-
ary when we got back from the
Outback Bowl, and some things
we've learned will carry on
through this season, and most
things carry on that way into
life."
The opportunity the seniors
had in California not only
helped bring clarity to the
senior leadership question in
the locker room, but it has also
left the players confident. More
importantly, after two weeks to
reflect, all 13 players who made
the trip are ready to translate it
onto the practice field.
"You can apply a lot of the
things we did to football," Gor-
don said. "But for us, it was
more using the classroom ses-

sions and organizing
the youth clinic to show how
much we can grow as young
men - young men that will
one day be better fathers, hus-
bands, co-workers and commu-
nity leaders. That's what I took
from it.
"One example was seeing
the smiles on the kids' faces at
youth camp, just seeing what
an impact it made. I think a lot
of us saw those things on the
trip."

The University's Board of
Regents is slated to hear and
approve proposals for oper-
ating budgets and set tuition
rates for the 2013-2014 fiscal
year at its meeting Thursday.
Following an opening speech
by University President Mary
Sue Coleman and a presentation
by Timothy Slottow, the Uni-
versity's executive vice presi-
dent and chief financial officer,
budgets will be proposed for the
three University campuses -
Ann Arbor, Dearborn and Flint
- as well as for the Athletic
Department and the University
Hospitals and Health Centers.
In addition, the Regents will
discuss several appointments
to chair departments within
various colleges in the Univer-
sity, along with the following:
1) There is a proposal to reno-
vate East Hall, as the space does
not currently meet the needs
of the department of Psychol-
ogy. The project will renovate
12,500 square feet to create new
laboratories and support spaces
for neuroscience research. The
construction is estimated to
cost $4.6 million.
2) Another proposal seeks
to relocate the department of
Astronomy to West Hall and
renovate 21,000 square feet to
accommodate the move.

Team will travel to
Australia to compete
in international race
ByTUI RADEMAKER
Daily News Editor
DETROIT - A sleek futuristic-
looking vehicle - the University
Solar Car Team's newest model
- was welcomed among the
crowd of cheering race crew
members, family and corporate
sponsors who attended the car's
unveiling at the General Motors
headquarters in Detroit this
morning.
The shiny maize vehicle,
named "Generation," is the Solar
Car Team's latest creation. Since
its inception in 1990, the team
has enjoyed wide support from
sponsors, GM and the College of
Engineering.
Jon Lauckner, GM's chief

technology officer, spoke before
the event about the confidence
that the auto giant has in the
solar team's innovation, a belief
that has carried its continued
support of the team.
"I'm confident that the new
University of Michigan solar
car will be one of the most
technologically advanced solar
vehicles ever built," Lauckner
said. "(It is) the culmination of
countless hours of dedicated
work that I think will produce
a piece of truly amazing
technology."
After speeches by additional
sponsors - including Brian
Noble, associate dean for
undergraduate education at the
College of Engineering and Dave
Taylor, vice president of global
marketing of Siemens PLM
Software - the Solar Car team
gathered around the encasement
to reveal the model. Upon
emerging, the vehicle drove to
the center of the room.

Generation's unveiling comes
in anticipation of its participation
in the World Solar Challenge, a
massive four- to five-day solar car
race that spans 3,000 kilometers
across Australia during the fall.
Twenty-two members of the
Solar Car team are scheduled to
travel to Australia. There will
be four drivers who will rotate
in five- to six-hour periods,
said Engineering senior Matt
Goldstein, head strategist for the
project. The drivers can expect
to face an inside environment
of about 30 degrees above the
outside temperature, making for
a toasty ordeal in the Australian
heat.
Engineering sophomore Pavan
Naik, business development
manager, said the team is unable
to elaborate on the vehicle's
speed for fear of over-sharing
specifics with competitors, but
added that they are constrained
by roads' posted speed limits.

Former CSG executives reflect
on past entrepreneurship efforts

Pilot intiatives
such as Month of
Entrepenuership to
continue next year
By AMRUTHA SIVAKUMAR
Daily News Editor
Last March, U.niversity alum
Manish Parikh, former Central
Student Government president,
and LSA senior Omar Hashwi,
former CSG vice president, made
a campaign promise to "promote
the spirit of entrepreneurship on
campus" if elected to executive
positions. As promised, the CSG
delivered.
Out of the 59 executive projects
cotmpleted by last year's assembly,
10 were dedicated to furthering
the entrepreneurial community.
The Annual Report compiled by
CSG hailed the newly formed
Entrepreneurship Commission as
its proudest accomplishment.
Parikh said popularizing
entrepreneurship among the
student body meant redefining
what it conventionally
represented.
"We've tried with every single
initiative to try to involve the
entire student body," Parikh said.
For those in CSG working on
spreading entrepreneurship,
involving the greater student
body meant abolishing the idea
that entrepreneurship was
limited to those with business
or engineering academic
concentrations.
Parikh said entrepreneurship
was the "mindset of using
innovation and creativity
to address huge problems."
Through supporting student
ventures that involved a more
diverse set of students - such as
OptiMize, an LSA-based social
entrepreneurship incubator, the
Entrepreneurship Commissions,
a gathering of entrepreneurs
from over 10 University schools
and colleges and the Flipped
Semester, a student-designed
educational curriculum - he
said he had "addressed a larger
part of the student body."
Hashwi said certain
entrepreneurial initiatives, such

as the Venture Expo, did not
heavily involve those outside of
the entrepreneurial community.
However, he believed that
these ventures helped raise
entrepreneurial awareness
further on campus.
"There were a lot of people
who came up to me and (asked
questions) what I was doing,"
he said. "They were learning not
only about our companies, but
what entrepreneurship really
was."
"I believe that the most
powerful message that we spread
was that anybody can become an
entrepreneur," Hashwi said.
The buzz around
entrepreneurship culminated
in March, as CSG kicked off the
Month of Entrepreneurship - a
series of over 35 events spanning
March and April that showcased
the growing entrepreneurial
community.
Although advertised as a
"month," the initiative hosted
events through a six-week period.
Parikh said a combination of high
student demand and events that
were "too huge not to showcase,"
elongated its duration.
As compared to the rest of
the year and its entrepreneurial

activities, Parikh said the month
was the "the most focused bit of
entrepreneurship," as compared
to rest of the academic year.
"We realized why make it a
month long when we can have
it for an extended period of
time," Hashwi said. "Rather
than having (the Month of
Entrepreneurship) for a month,
having it for (a longer time) was
more beneficial for the students."
Furthermore, packaging
campus-wide entrepreneurial
events into a month played a
vital role in characterizing the
University as an "entrepreneurial
university," Parikh said.
"If we aren't able to package
this, if we aren't able to show
our student body, prospective
students, alumni and different
colleges across the world just
how serious we as a University
take entrepreneurship, then I
don't really think we can be an
entrepreneurial university,"
Parikh said.
Parikh added that he sees his
pilotedinitiatives as continuing
for years to come.
"I think we've really
started a catalyst for bringing
entrepreneurship to the entire
student body," he said. "It's
absolutely unattainable to (reach

out to every student) in the
period of a year, but what we've
done is setting the ground work."
In a May interview, Business
senior Michael Proppe, president
ofCSG,saidthe Entrepreneurship
Commission and the Month
of Entrepreneurship would
continue to take place in the
next academic year. However,
available funding and its chosen
allocation would determine
whether other CSG-sponsored
entrepreneurial ventures would
continue.
Business senior Scott
Christopher said next year, one
goal would be to concentrate
events into a 30-day period that
would be more "structured and
strategic."
Rather than characterizing
the month as a mere collection
of events, Christopher said he
believed that it could be an
opportunity for entrepreneurs
to acknowledge and share their
accomplishments.
"I think the Month of
Entrepreneurship should be
a time to really celebrate it,"
he said. "Entrepreneurship
does happen every single day
of the year in Michigan but
entrepreneurs never celebrate
what they do."

his role of demonic soul singer

and Heartbreak's artful approach
to autotune and combines it with
a Late Registration-style sample
of Nina Simone's "Strange Fruit"
before the revolutionary horns of
Hudson Mohawke kick in to take
the song to the next level.
With the help of legendary
minimalist and executive pro-
ducer Rick Rubin, Kanye crafted
Yeezus into one powerful, con-
cise vision. In order to open the
album's blank physical CD and
get to the music, listeners must
literally cut through a piece of
red tape - a potent symbol of
Kanye's effort to cut through the
industry bureaucracy and get his
work directly to the people. And
what a work this is. Yeezus will
undoubtedly go down as one of
the most experimental albums in
pop music history and a career-
defining album for a man with a
catalog of masterpieces.

Medical School
receives grant

Curriculum to be
revamped after
American Medical
Association award
By MAX RADWIN
Daily StaffReporter
The University's Medical
School will be implementing
some of its most comprehensive
curriculum changes in more than
50 years.
The Medical School will be
aided in these improvements by
using a $1.1 million grant it won
last Friday from the American
Medical Association as part
of its "Accelerating Change in
Medical Education" initiative
- which awarded funding to 11
schools actively seeking to create
a "significant positive impact
on physician training and the
medical profession."
More than 130 medical
schools across the country
responded to the AMA's

competition to improve
medical education. Of those,
119 presented transformative
proposals. Thirty-one of them
advanced to the next round
and were asked to submit a full
proposal and grant request.
Ultimately, 11 medical schools,
including the University,
received funding.
The grant was awarded to the
University for its proposal to
transform the Medical School
curriculum into a competency-
based program that will be
implemented over the next five
years. The money will be used
to train faculty and staff and
fund projects that arise from the
curriculum changes.
The University has been
building toward this curriculum
change for the last three
years through a modular
implementation of small pilots
and programs - one of these,
the Taubman Health Sciences
Library renovation project, is
scheduled to begin in January and
be completed by 2015.

SSDP members from around
the country - including
one representative from the
University's chapter - met
yesterday to hear speakers and
later visited the Hill to talk with
various congressmen in support
of current bills that would alter
federal drug enforcement.
The bill being lobbied for
is HR 499, a proposal that
would prevent federal drug
enforcement from interfering
in states where marijuana
is legal either medically or

recreationally.
Law student Reid Murdoch,
who was the sole representative
from the University's chapter
of SSDP, said state and federal
drug enforcement are currently
"at war."
"Essentially what's going on
is that states around the country
are doing popular referendums
and popular opinion is vastly
in favor of marijuana policy
reform," Murdoch said. "Despite
that, the DEA, under the Obama
administration's orders, has
relentlessly pursued medical
marijuana providers and people
who are acting in accordance
with their own state laws."
While there are several bills in
the House of Representatives that
look to decriminalize marijuana,
Murdoch said HR 499 is a good
place to start, as the bill isn't
focused on legalization so much
as it is on enforcement efficiency.
"It's an easier pill to swallow,
it's a less controversial bill that
I think people from all sides of
the political spectrum can get
behind," he said.

Murdoch visited the offices
of several representatives,
including that of Rep. John
Dingell (D-Mich.). He said he
was hopeful that changes would
happen swiftly.
"It's a non-partisan issue,"
Murdoch said. "People in the
past have been terrified to
talk about it, there's a cultural
stigma about it, but I would say
absolutely it's a non-partisan
issue."
Murdoch added that the SSDP
supports decriminalization of
marijuana as a civil rights issue,
an economic issue, an individual
liberty issue and a national
security issue.
"Our position is that while
marijuana stays illegal, it's
dangerous," he said. "We just
need to get it off the streets and
we need to regulate it."
LSA senior Sebastian Blake
Swae-Shampine, legislative
action director for the
University's chapter of SSDP,
said current drug enforcement
was a poor use of resources that

Sticking togetrAher
Newspapers must support each other despite competition
Recently, former National Security Agency contractor Edward
Snowden reached out to litigator-turned-journalist Glenn Gre-
enwald - a columnist for The Guardian - in order to disclose
information regarding NSA programs. However, in reporting the leak on
their website and on Twitter, The New York Times slighted both Green-
wald and The Guardian, referring to Greenwald as a "blogger" and the
Guardian as a "British news site." This choice of language was a disap-
pointing display of pettiness by the Times - coming off as an attempt to
belittle the work of a competitor reporting a major story. Though heavy
competition is understandable in the dying world of print journalism,
respected newspapers can't discredit one another because of losing a
news scoop - they must continue to put forth the best possible journal-
ism, even if that means letting another paper take credit.

When we think of terror-
ism today, Islam is the
one religious group that
usually comes
to mind. Unfor-
tunately, this is
because the reli-
gion has been
painted in the
worst light since
9/11. Islam has
been hijacked - SARA
its reputation is SHOUHAYIB
no longer in the
hands of Mus-
lims. Rather, it's the media that have
taken over its fate.
The power of the press is
evident - the way Islam has been
portrayed is the perfect example of
that. The media need to remember,
"With great power comes great
responsibility." Even though it's a
corny Spiderman line, there's some
truth to it. The media should be
more mindful of the way they speak
about Islam because they are greatly
responsible for influencing public
opinion. The role of the press and
the media is to serve as watchdogs
of the government and to inform the
public of the world's events. What
they shouldn't do is speak slantingly
about a group of people.
Even the most reputable news
organizations we turn to for top sto-
ries have been guilty. For example,
while CNN was coveringthe Boston
bombings, Wolf Blitzer hinted Tsar-
naev might be linked to the violent
behavior because he had the same
name as a 14th-century Islamic cru-
sader who massacred millions of
people. I couldn't believe they were
making that connection on national
television. A name does not inher-
ently affect someone's actions. And
this is CNN we're talking about here
- one of the most widely viewed
news organizations in the world.
A journalist is supposed to give a
voice to the voiceless. MuslimAmer-
icans don't always have high posi-
tions in politics or positions that can
give avoice to its people. So here it is:
Terrorism is notarace --itdoesn't
have a face and it doesn't have a skin
color. One definition of terrorism is
"the use of violence and intimida-
tion in the pursuit of political aims."
Nowhere in that definition is there
a reference to a religious group or
a particular spiritual following. It's
absolutely absurd that people are
constantly making that association.
I'm not a Muslim American, but I
am an Arab American - a proud
one at that - and because the two
are often conflated I need to set the

record straight.
How are we supposed to learn to
get along and attain peace if we are
demonizing people? We say we want
a better America, a more peaceful
America - well, let's start by
eradicating ignorance. Just because
a person is Arab, does not mean they
are Muslim. Just because someone
is a Muslim, it does not mean they
support Al-Qaeda or that they
are affiliated with terrorism. The
Koran isn't telling Muslims to act
chaotically. Not all terrorists come
from the Middle East. The religion is
called Islam, not Muslim. Say it with
me - I-S-L-A-M. Educate yourself
before developing harsh opinions
about a group of people.
Learn about
other cultures
and religions.
Imagine how Christian and
Jewish communities would feel
and react if their religion was
disenfranchised like Islam is in
America. Just taking a shot in the
dark here, but I'm pretty sure they
wouldn't stand for it. I would like
to make one thing crystal clear: I'm
not in any shape or form defending
the deplorable acts of terrorism
committed by any terrorist, be they
Muslim or any other religion. Yes,
Muslimshavecarriedoutviolentacts
that were wrong and unforgivable.
But how many times do we refer
to a white criminal's religion like
we do with Arabs? Religion is not
the reason people commit crimes.
My main message is that not all
Muslims are terrorists and that the
radicals are the religion's outliers.
They are in no way whatsoever the
vast majority.
It's a shame that pockets of bad
people created a stain that nearly
covered the whole surface of Islam
in some people's eyes. There are
approximately 1.5 billion followers
of Islam around the world - doesn't
that say something? There are
beautiful aspects of the religion,
as well as outdated ones - just like
every faith.
Let's take the time to understand
and learn about other cultures and
religions. Once we do that, we all
may actually start to get along.

New York Mets hats - Nasty Nas
tore through a set of hits, from his
classic "Illmatic" all the way up
to his stellar recent release, "Life
Is Good."
As the sun set away and the
Bonnaroo Ferris wheel lit up,
we popped into a tent to see DJ
A-Trak. His trap-electronic beats
shook the ground, prompting Sofie
to ask me, half-joking and half-
serious, "Can this bass be good for
my organs? It feels like everything
is vibrating."
We moved onto Jack Johnson,
filling in last-minute for Mum-
ford & Sons, who had to cancel
due to their bass player's health.
By the time we reached John-
son, my legs might as well have
been bloody stumps. My stom-
ach churned angrily, my thighs
were red with sunburn where my
excessively short tennis shorts
neglected to cover me, and my
phone was nearly out of battery.
We left Johnson and dragged
ourselves reluctantly to R. Kelly,
quietly deciding that we'd leave
after a few songs. But that didn't
happen. What instead trans-
pired at the Which Stage from
11:30 p.m. to 1 a.m. was one of the
most bizarre and incredible per-
formances I had ever witnessed
(Fuse even dedicated an entire
article to it).
Standing about 20 feet from
the stage, I watched as a score
of gospel singers appeared
while the music from "Ignition
(Remix)" started. However, I was
instantly confused, as R. Kelly
was nowhere to be seen. Only
when I looked up did I notice a
cherry picker raised 50 feet in
the air on top of the stage, carry-
ing, you guessed it, R. Kelly. The
crowd went wild, and then the
music stopped. For 45 seconds,
the stage was silent save for the
creaking sound of R. Kelly's crane
moving slowly downward.
hhI'm not sure if Kells planned
this, or if the crane was just mal-
functioning, but it was the first
in a brilliant hit-or-miss night
from him. He sang his party jams
("Fiesta," "Gigolo," "Thoia Tho-
ing") mixed in with his baby-
making slow-burners ("Feelin' On
Yo Booty," "Your Body's Callin"')
with absolutely no rational order.
Still, his vocal range was mind-
blowing, as heard on the intro for
"Bump N' Grind," and his finale
performance of "I Believe I Can
Fly," complete with the return of
the gospel choir and the release
of dozens of plastic doves, was
miraculous. Kells did his share
of ridiculousness, too, like sing-

ing for five minutes about how he
needed a towel to wipe the sweat
off of his face. As Jason Newman
of Fuse summed it up, "The line
between earnestness and absur-
dity has never been blurrier than
at an R. Kelly concert." That's for
sure.
DAY 4
I think my mom has a slight
crush on Macklemore, which is
fine (at least it's not on FlavaFlay),
so I shuffled along with her to see
his and Ryan Lewis's afternoon
set. I must admit, though, that
I'm not a huge fan. Macklemore
live is tons of fun. His songs are
catchy, and he somehow walks
the line between aloof rapper and
touching, recovering drug-user
sentimentalist.
Then came Kendrick Lamar.
I am a huge, huge Kendrick fan,
and he did not disappoint. Stand-
ing on the festival's biggest stage
with just a microphone and a
DJ, Kendrick managed to pump
up the entire crowd by himself.
I forced my mom to join me and
a middle-aged man I met, (who
turned out to be Michael Azer-
rad, the incredible music journal-
ist), in the middle of the Kendrick
pit. There I met Sean, a midget
who I had seen at the Nas show
wearing a tutu and a red, white
and blue bikini top ("I gotta mix it
up," he explained to me.) Not only
did Sean and I dance and jump
like crazy, but he even pulled
out a wine bag from his back-
pack during "Swimming Pools
(Drank)," which he proceeded to
drink from and toss around the
entire crowd.
After a forgettable set by A$AP
Rocky - I admit I was really tired,
but he just yelled the whole time
- we arrived for the last hurrah:
Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers.
Seeing that I know next to noth-
ing about Petty, I was not happy
about going, especially consider-
ing it had started to rain. But my
unbreakable mother insisted, and
so we went to watch in a complete
downpour. The first thing Sofie
and I both noticed was how abso-
lutely baked he seemed. I'm not
talking a little bit high. I'm talk-
ing so absolutely blitzed that he
looked like he could barely finish
sentences, and the only reason
he did not mess up his songs was
because he has been playing them
for 30 years. As stoned as he was,
I must admit, he killed it beyond
belief.
At the airport the next day,
Sofie and I high-fived proudly.

Another year in the books. We
had seen 20 bands, consumed a
toxic mixture of pizza, crepes,
Amish doughnuts, ice cream and
lots of lemonade, made friends
with a legendary music journalist
and danced until blisters popped
from our feet. Though I told her
I was happy to leave, which in

part I was, I knew inside that I
was already beginning to have
serious Roo withdrawal. I started
to worry about work, checking
my phone restlessly and find-
ing myself searching desperately
throughout the Nashville airport
for anybody else with the famil-
iar wristband. Oh well. Though

my normal routine inevitably
has to resume - homework will
pile, friends will call, life will go
on - I know that if I'm ever feel-
ing down, all I have to do is think
back to a certain farm in the mid-
dle of Tennessee, where, 361 days
from now, my Bonnaroo family
will be waiting for me.

Though Greenwald began his
writing career as a blogger, he
has since written columns and
essays for both Salon and The
Guardian for several years. Fur-
thermore, he worked as an attor-
ney dealing in civil rights and
liberties for over a decade. He
is the author of three books and
is one of the most sought-after
speakers and writers on national
security and privacy issues. The
Times could have chosen to con-
vey any of this information about
Greenwald, but instead classified
him purely as a "blogger" - a title
that for better or worse implies a
far lower level of prestige than
is appropriate. The use of the
phrase "British news site" comes
nowhere near a proper descrip-
tion for The Guardian. Founded
in 1821, the news outlet has won
many awards for both individual
journalists and the newspaper as

a whole while maintaining a rep-
utation as one of Britain's most
well-regarded newspapers.
As one of the most highly
respected and well-known news-
papers in the world, it's especial-
ly disappointing to see this level
of pettiness from the Times. The
information released by Snowden
has transformed into one of the
most important news stories in
a decade. All journalists should
be interested in uncovering the
truth about exactly what the
NSA has been involved in, as well
as in investigating Snowden's
credibility and uncovering
information concerning surveil-
lance. Instead, the Times moved
toward further fighting between
newspapers. A newspaper's need
to stay on top and report ground-
breaking stories is an under-
standable concern in today's day
and age as they face increasing

pressure from new media. How-
ever, the possibility of gaining
readers from a competitor means
nothing if journalistic integrity
is sacrificed and fellow reporters
are thrown under the bus.
Last week, Rep. Peter King
(R-N.Y.) called for Greenwald's
arrest due to his reporting. Even
before that, the AP reported that
the Department of Justice had
seized call records from a num-
ber of its reporters and editors.
In a time when the government
is often at odds with the stories
that journalists report, newspa-
pers must not make it more dif-
ficult for each other to pursue
truth and hold the government
accountable. If they resort to
such seemingly dirty tactics as
the Times did, they will do noth-
ing more but discredit them-
selves and help those they should
be investigating.

Bonnaroo (the venues are named
as follows: That Tent, This Tent,
The Other Tent, Which Stage and
What Stage. Yeah. Confusing.).
We wasted no time on Thursday
night, going to see Haim, Deap
Vally and Alt-J at a variety of
tents. Thursday night is always
fun: Not as many people are
there, and more up-and-coming
bands usually play. The two girl
groups, Haim and Deap Vally,
both put on great shows, with
Haim running through a fun set
of '80s-infused, harmony-laden
pop-rock and Deap Vally shred-
ding through a ferocious, sexy,
White Stripes-esque hour of
music. We arrived at Alt-J to find
This Tent overflowing with fans,
and we fought to get even a decent
look at the group (that's another
thing about Bonnaroo. There are
<em>always</em> more people.)
The band played songs from their
incredibly catchy and well-exe-
cuted debut, An Awesome Wave,
and though their often-mumbled
lyrics were pretty difficult to
make out ("I dare you to under-
ADAM GLANZMAN/Daily stand one word" Sofie whisper-
shouted), their tight grooves and
dedicated fans made for a great
40 show, climaxing with the "I love
you so" chants of "Breezeblocks."
'IBy the end, my knees were already
shaking with fatigue, which wor-
ried me considering we had only
been at the festival for five hours.
I went to bed at 1 a.m. both excit-
ed and nervous for the next day.

Bonnaroo festival goers cool off in the fountain between musical sets.
Four days of mu
7heat and Bonnai

Stone, a hippie-looking white guy
who sang some of the best soul I'd
heard in years, then to Passion
Pit, who covered the main stage
in huge white balloons during a
set of their usual dance-pop num-
bers. Stopping for a quick snack
at a food truck (you have to eat
about seven times per day in order
to stay awake for nearly 15 hours
of music), we headed over to Big
K.R.I.T., who absolutely took the
roof off of The Other Tent.
Wu-Tang Clan was next, and
they ran through a greatest-hits
set complete with a lot of middle-
finger raising and reminders that
the Wu-Tang Clan is indeed still
nothing to fuck with.
Then came one of the high-
lights of my concert-going life.
To be honest, I did not expect
to love Paul McCartney. He's a
Beatle and a legend in his own
right, but to be frank, I thought
he'd be boring. I could not have
been more wrong. Sir Paul ran
through a three hour set - yes,
three - of hits ("Come Together,"
"Baby I'm Amazed" and "Back in
the U.S.S.R."), slower numbers
("Blackbird," "Yesterday") and
two touching tributes to John
Lennon and George Harrison,
the latter punctuated by an awe-
some rendition of "Something."
He made a crowd of around
80,000 feel tiny, telling hilari-
ous and insightful stories about
Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton
while looking more than spry at
70 years old. Sure, there were a
few missteps here and there - his
voice isn't what it used to be -but
everything was accounted for by
two roaring encores and three
hours of more than memorable
music.
We wrapped up the night by
stopping by The xx (fine as usual,
though it was too sleepy at that
point for me) and ZZ Top (abso-
lutely incredible, played to a
packed tent complete with match-
ing purple coats and trademark
beards - Billy Gibbons even had
someone come onstage and light
a cigarette in his mouth while he
soloed). The best part was that
the weekend was only half done.
DAY 3
Saturday began with Beyonce's
little sister Solange, who provided
a somewhat-entertaining, short
set of electro-funk to a surpris-
ingly large audience. Nas came
next, and though I'd seen him
twice before, I was incredibly
happy to be watching him again.
Backed by an energetic and tal-
ented band - most of whom wore

gnore what Edward Snowden
has shown the world.
Really. Ignore that the
National Security
Agency has court-
approved access
to the records of
every single call
made by Veri-
zon, AT&T and
Sprint customers
in the U.S., along ERIC
with the ability FERGUSON
to obtain records -
of online activity
from both American citizens and
foreign nationals.
You can ignore this dragnet
operation because you're a Democrat,
and during a Democratic presidency
this program can't be wrong. You
voted for Obama less than a year
ago, a suave champion of social
liberalism and universal healthcare
running against every Republican's
second choice. Barack is your guy.
There's no way he would let the NSA
do this without putting adequate
safeguards in place - it's not like it
took four years for him to publicly
acknowledge that four U.S. citizens
have been killed by drones. And even
putting that aside, aren't his critics
on this issue just a bunch of dumb
Republicans looking to score some
political points?
You could also ignore it because
it's so sensational. Right now the
NSA itself admits it only gives close
scrutiny to fewer than 300 phone
numbers, and that it has nowhere
near enough staff members to look
at each and every piece of data
PRISM makes available to them. So
there's absolutely nothing to worry
about. Further, the notion that some
government agent has the ability to
watch these words form as they're
being typed - as Snowden has
suggested - is ridiculous and should
invalidate everything else he has
said. The man is a sociopath who
has hit the jackpot thanks to some
guy named Glenn Greenwald, who is
obviously playing this whole situation
for attention. Besides, it's not like he's
a reputable journalist working for a
respected newspaper.
Even better, ignore it because this
leaker is a traitor in the eyes of so many
government officials, members of Con-
gress and at least one neoconservative,
shotgun-wielding former vice presi-
dent. The NSA says that over 50 ter-
ror plots were stopped thanks to these
programs, and let's face it - the only
conceivable way these plots could have
been stopped was through monitoring
virtually every American with a cell

phone or Internet presence. And that's
only half of the story - he also fled to
Hong Kong right after the leak went
public. That can only mean he's a Chi-
nese spy. He deserves whatever our
government throws at him over there.
Perhaps a drone strike is in order?
Your innocence
justifies your
ignorance.
Best of all, ignore that NSA officials
have your call records tucked away
and the ability to seize your online
data without your knowledge because
you have "nothingto hide." Your life is
going so well. You're working at a place
that will bring you one step closer to
that career you've been dreaming of,
and you don't have time to worry about
all this junk. You're a good person -
you keep yourself in shape, follow the
Golden Rule and have no prejudices
based on race or sexual orientation.
Your browser history is just an endless
scroll through social networks,
Bleacher Report and CNN, with
nothing but memes and other material
irrelevant to the NSA in between. The
rest ofyour computer is cleanofpirated
media, videos of extremists preaching
their gospel, flag-burning pictures,
child pornography, et cetera. You just
don't fit the profile for government
surveillance. To hell with civil
responsibility - your innocence
justifies your ignorance.
We students can all carry on with
our lives just as if Snowden never
existed. Not only are the NSA's pro-
grams completely warranted because
they're supposed to catch terrorists,
but their privacy-eroding methods are
also nothing to worry about because
we're such good people. We can worry
about our privacy when the NSA has
somehow inferred guilt out of a life-
time of innocence - and that's some-
thing our children or grandchildren
are more likely to have to worry about
than us. When that happens, all it will
take is the accused person's word to
make those NSA agents see the error
of their ways. Life is fair like that.
Come to think of it, the NSA could
probably catch even more terrorists if
they had more people.
Wait - they're hiring? Where do I
sign up?

Ignore it all

n the middle of several
voter identification laws
passed in 2012, the non-
partisan
Brennan
Center for
Justice
estimated
that about
11 percent of
Americans
had no form JAMES
of photo BRENNAN
ID, and
that these
Americans faced obstacles in
obtaining these documents even
when they tried. Federal courts
have ruled both for and against
individual state laws regarding
voter ID, meaning that in the
future the Supreme Court will
likely be forced to issue the final
judgment on the legality of such
laws. However, no one seems
to be discussing the plethora of
difficulties faced by people
without IDs.
For a huge number of
Americans, their chances of
improvingtheir station in life are
largely dependent on whether
or not they are able to obtain
documents like state IDs and
birth certificates. One's ability to
prove their identity with a photo
ID is a major requirement for a
number of government benefits,
as well as for employment, low-
cost housing and purchasing a
car. Obviously the need to prove
one's identity is important, but
requiring a state-issued photo
ID in order to do so presents
a massive barrier to millions
of people.
In the debate over voter ID
laws, the consistent reply to lib-
eral concerns over people with-
out IDs is "Why don't they just
get one?" or "How hard is it to get
an ID?" In the bubble of privilege
that some of us live in, having a
driver's license is something we

easily take for granted. If you
have ever lost your license, you
may begin to understand the dif-
ficulty some people face in try-
ing to obtain their ID - we have
our parents shuffle through their
papers for our birth certificate
and scrounge for a few pieces of
mail to prove our residency, make
the drive out to the Secretary of
State office, then wait in line and
pay $20 for a replacement.
Having spent every Friday
over the last five months
assisting poor and homeless
Detroiters obtain IDs, I've
quickly learned that for people
living in poverty, the process is
usually far more arduous.
Starting out, a huge number
of people have almost none of
the documentation needed to get
an ID. A birth certificate is usu-
ally required - and going about
obtaining it is a task within itself,
since at least three other pieces
of documentation are needed to
confirm it. Once the birth cer-
tificate is acquired, an ID may
require even more documenta-
tion, such as proof of residency
in the form of school transcripts,
bills or bank accounts - some-
thingpoor and homeless individ-
uals don't always have, especially
those who are older.
After getting past all of the
hurdles necessary to prove one's
identity, a person then must find
their way to a Secretary of State
office - which many researchers
have pointed out is especially far
from the homes of the poorest
people. Finally, these documents
usually cost between $10 and
$25. This might not sound like a
whole lot of money, but this is the
poorest of the poor we're talking
about - people who can barely
afford their bus fare just to get
to the office; people who have
no income and no one to ask for
a loan. Twenty dollars is a huge
sum of money for many people

trying to obtain an ID, and it's
often the biggest barrier between
an individual moving forward or
staying stuck in their station.
Comprehensive
ID reform is a
no-brainer.
After a voter ID law was
passed in South Carolina, pro-
grams were arranged to trans-
port people for free to offices to
obtain their IDs so they could
vote. Michigan - regardless
of any voter ID laws - should
follow South Carolina's lead
and develop comprehensive ID
reform. People should not only be
transported to the Secretary of
State office, but they also should
have clear directions on what
documentation to bring, people
who can help them obtain these
documents and the costs of their
ID covered.
Both Republicans and Demo-
crats are constantly looking for
ways to stimulate growth and
help people find work, but tak-
ing down a barrier as simple as
photo ID costs never seems to
come out as a priority. Cities like
Detroit are filled with residents
hungry to get to work, to build
something for themselves and to
take control of their lives. They
don't want anything handed to
them on a platter - they only
want to be given a chance to suc-
ceed. Comprehensive ID reform
is a liberal idea with conserva-
tive values, and, frankly, it's a
no-brainer for both social justice
and economic development in
Michigan.

Classic Tennessee
festival offers
delights, surprises
By JACKSON HOWARD
DailyArts Writer
There's something really, well,
special, about going to a farm in
the middle of Tennessee with
nearly 100,000 other people for
a four-day music festival. There
are the incredibly revolting Port-
A-Potties, the erratic weather
that can bring 100-degree heat
followed by an apocalyptic thun-
derstorm, and the inevitability
that you will be forced up against
someone that a) has not showered
-in days, b) has hair in really weird
places and/orc) is doing whatever
drug is in their possession (weed,
mushrooms, ecstasy, unrecog-
nizable powders that scare me)
in front of you and your mother,
making both of you unspeakably
'uncomfortable.
All that aside, in a world of

seemingly impending doom,
destruction and despair, Bonna-
roo is an anomaly, a paradoxical
utopia that on paper looks impos-
sible but in practice is one of 21st
century society's greatest accom-
plishments.
Think about it. Somehow, tens
of thousands of people from all
over this God-forsaken country
and planet - people from Cali-
fornia and Brazil, Jews and Bud-
dhists, straights and gays, and
everything in between - come
together once a year at a 700-acre
farm in no-man's-land, Tennes-
see in the name of music, art and
an intangible feeling that can only
be called Bonnaroo. This past
weekend was my fifth trip down
to Manchester, and despite my
swollen feet, sun-burnt shoulders
and the exhaustion of having my
never-aging mother Sofie, who
inexplicably has the energy to see
nine concerts back-to-back, as
my companion, I had maybe the
greatest weekend of my 19-year-
old life.
Yes, I got to see some of my

favorite musicians play music
non-stop for four days. But what
really makes Bonnaroo so special
are my fellow Bonnaroovians - a
family of dedicated, relentless,
costume-wearing, tattoo-flaunt-
ing, borderline-psychotic music
lovers. Three-hundred and six-
ty-one days of the year, we trod
along as students, office manag-
ers, secretaries, advertising con-
sultants and garbage men, but
for four glorious days, our inner
'Roo is allowed to emerge, and
what a sight to see: Superman
capes, an obese man with pasties
on his nipples, a woman in a full
banana costume and lots and lots
of boobs. It's hot, it's overpriced
and it's a hell-of-a schlep, but year
after year, people come back to
the farm because it's Bonnaroo.
And once the Roo is in your sys-
tem, you're never getting rid of it.
DAY 1
Being Year 5, Sofie and I had
a near-perfect sense of how to
navigate the pit of chaos that is

DAY 2
My mother and I flew through
nine concerts on Friday, and I
had to drink more than a few Red
Bulls to stay alive. First off was
Local Natives, one of my favorite
bands, who did their usual blend
of hipster, somewhat-depress-
ing, drum-heavy rock. Midway
through their set, though, I began
to get bored, as did my mother.
We decided then to go explore
something new, which ended up
being the African singer Fatou-
mata Diawara or, as my iPhone
corrected,
"Fat Pinata Diorama." Over
the years, Bonnaroo has provid-
ed us with a vast goodie bag of
spur-of-the-moment surprises,
and Fatoumata Diawara did not
disappoint. I watched happily as
Diawara - an elegant and strik-
ingly beautiful African woman
clad in bright yellow and red -
danced, preached, chirped and
dread-whipped for an enthusias-
tic audience.
We moved from Diawara to
a smaller stage to watch Allen

SOLAR
From Page 1
Among the challenges that
the car's engineers faced was
accounting for a sweeping set of
regulations recently set forth by the
competition. This year, competing
cars have been required to add a
fourth wheel, place the driver in an

upright position and incorporate a
greater field of vision.
"Those were sort of the three big
challenges thrown at us," Goldstein
said. "From there we just tried a
whole bunch of different concepts
and we believe that the one we have
now is sort of the best concept for
tackling those challenges."
In terms, of speed and efficiency,
spectators will likely not notice
much of a difference from last year's

Quantum model, with the updates
instead focused on incorporating
these new regulations.
"Having that fourth wheel is a
big big difference," Goldstein said.
"It would normally make it slower...
(but) we believe this concept is going
to compensate for those changes as
best as possible."
Despite the extra challenges,
Goldstein said the crew feels
extremely confident going into

the race. The University's Solar
Car Team has won the past seven
national championships as well as
achieving five top three finishes
in Australia.
There are mixed feelings among
creators and investors about the
future implications of the solar
car. While the technology is being
embraced by both software and
automotive companies - GM
among them - the vehicle for

now remains a phenomenon of
engineering competitions.
Goldstein said the team's main
focus remains on creating a highly
efficient and innovative vehicle that
willbeinternationally competitive in
the world of science and engineering
as opposed to turning those ideas
into everyday technology.
However both Taylor and
Lauckner expressed excitement over
the way the innovation that is being
explored can become applicable.
"We're now trying to help
companies around the world try to
solve really complicated technical
challenges around the topic of
mobility," Taylor said. "What the U
of M team here is doing fits right in to
that. We're really looking forward to
see ... what we can learn from them
in their use of the technology that
will help us help our customers."
Speaking on behalf of the team
at the unveiling, LSA senior Bryan
Mazor emphasized the crew's
confidence in both their hard work
and their technological innovation
seen in the finished result.
"Like any competitive team
we represent something more,"
Mazor said. "We're going to wear
the block M on our chest, we're
going to have our sponsors on our
car, we're going to be competing
(against) the best teams of the
world, representing Michigan."

REFORM
From Page 3
LSA senior SebastianBlake Swae-
Shampine, legislative action director
for the University's chapter of SSDP,
said current drug enforcement was
a poor use of resources that could
be used for more serious crimes
- citing a statistic published by
the National Organization for the
Reform of Marijuana Laws, which
states that of the $7.5 to $10 billion
spent on marijuana cases, about 90
percent were for possession only.
Swae said heightened drug
enforcement has led to some
CURRICULUM
From Page 3
Rajesh Mangrulkar, associate
dean for medical student
education, said the changes were
being made in order to keep the
program competitive.
"The overarching goal
here is we want to change the
architecture and the content of
our program in order to be able to
compete," Mangrulkar said.
The first component of the
new curriculum will establish
a "consolidated foundation," he
said. In most medical schools,
students complete two years of
coursework followed by two years
in a clinical setting. In contrast,
the University plans to condense
the two years of coursework and
the first year of clinical studies
into a two-year period.
The new curriculum will also
feature professional development.
Students will be able to choose
from four branches that will
help them develop the advanced
clinical and scientific skills
needed in the medical profession.
"It will be rigorous but flexible,"
Mangrulkar said. "(Students) will
be able to monitor their pace of
development based on specific
assessments and the achievement
of milestones."
The Medical School will also
introduce a "leadership and
change management" component

"egregious" laws, includingthe state
of Michigan's Asset Forfeiture law,
which has allowed enforcement
officials to seize possessions such as
cash and vehicles fromdrug holders.
"You don't need to actually be
arrested or charged with a crime
or tried in order to have your assets
be seized," he said. "All you need to
do is have that one law enforcement
encounter that goes awry."
Swae said he seesthe conversation
on drugs as "sobering" because
more people have realized that
current drug laws are problematic.
He believed marijuana could easily
become a legalized substance - like
alcohol and tobacco - which could
then be regulated and taxed.
into its curriculum that would help
students garner skills required for
leading healthcare teams.
Mangrulkar said "health
equality," "bioethics" and
"quality and safety" were possible
examples of this component.
Students would then choose to
focus on one "path of excellence."
Perhaps the largest change
to the University's Medical
School curriculum is M-Home,
a longitudinal, clinical and
educational learning community
assigned to students in their first
year and until the end of their
training. By connecting students,
Mangrulkar said a team of faculty,
instructors and advisors would
help student development.
"Imagine drawing basic
sciences and clinical sciences
from the foundation into all group
settings for discussion," he said.
"(Imagine) drawing reflections
about their leadership and
change management experiences
with each other in a small group
setting."
The actual shift to the new
curriculum will start in August
2015, but there is noset date when
the University is going to "flip the
switch" on the new program.
"I think it's absolutely
transformative what we're doing
here," Mangrulkar said. "When
you compare us to the other
schools that were funded ... I
think ours is probably proposing
the broadest change across the
curriculum."
