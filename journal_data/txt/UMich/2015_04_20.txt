A. Alfred Taubman, one of the top 

donors in the University’s history, 
passed away Friday night at age 91.

His death was confirmed in a 

statement released by his son, Robert 
S. Taubman, to employees of Taubman 
Centers, Inc, according to the Detroit 
News. Robert S. Taubman is the 
current CEO of the company.

“Tonight, after dinner in his home, a 

heart attack took him from us, ending 
what was a full, extraordinary life that 
touched so many people in so many 
wonderful ways around the world,” 
the statement read. “Right now it is 
difficult for me to express our sadness. 
One thing that will never be taken from 
us is Alfred Taubman’s vision that will 
continue to guide and inspire us.”

Day-long events 
showcase student 
groups, encourage 

collaboration

By MICHAEL SUGERMAN

Daily News Editor

Throughout 
Friday 
night’s 

capstone concert on the tail 
end 
of 
SpringFest, 
rapper 

Common 
reminded 
students 

the importance of diversity and 
inclusion.

“Music matters. We matter. All 

lives matter,” he told the crowd.

This was a theme constant 

during 
the 
day’s 
SpringFest 

events, 
which 
included 
a 

fashion show “One,” student 
organizations’ largely interactive 
booths, live music performances 
and more.

Business senior Darren Appel, 

president of MUSIC Matters 

— 
the 
student 
organization 

that put on the fourth annual 
SpringFest — said campus-wide 
collaboration was an essential 
facet of the event.

“I thought that this year, one 

of the cool things was the student 
orgs seemed to really get the idea 
a lot more of actually creating an 
engaging event,” Appel said.

LSA 
senior 
Marli 
Siegel, 

MUSIC Matters communications 
manager, added that the “perfect” 
weather, which was sunny and in 

the 70s, was conducive to student 
participation.

“I think the level of student 

engagement was the highest it 
has ever been, and I think that 
made SpringFest the best it has 
ever been,” she said. “There were 
people that set up shop to play 
guitar just because they wanted 
to. Something like that is so 
awesome.”

One 
of 
these 
impromptu 

performances was the group 
Stankface, composed of LSA 

junior 
Cody 
Fayolle, 
Music, 

Theatre & Dance junior Alex 
Greenzeig 
and 
Engineering 

junior Brent Ritter. Greenzeig 
and 
Ritter 
played 
electric 

guitar harmonies, while Fayolle 
provided percussion.

Organizers 
have 
already 

approached the group, which was 
not affiliated with SpringFest, 
about performing at next year’s 
event

ACADEMICS

Transfer students 

account for 16 
percent of new 
undergraduates

By SAMANTHA WINTNER

Daily Staff Reporter

Last 
fall, 
7,546 
new 

undergraduates 
enrolled 
at 

the University. Apart from an 
incoming freshmen class of 
6,505 students, 1,041 of these 
new enrollees were transfer 
students, according to data 
provided by the University’s 
Office of Public Affairs.

These 
transfer 
students 

represent roughly 16 percent of 
incoming undergraduates.

LSA junior Reid Klootwyk, 

LSA 
Student 
Government 

vice president for upcoming 
academic year, transferred to 
the University last fall from 
Muskegon Community College. 

He said the contrast between 
entering college as a freshmen 
and entering a new university as 
an experienced college student 
adds additional challenges.

“We’ve been through some 

small tidbit of college, but we’re 
also so fresh to the University 
and so new to things,” he said. 
“We’re a little bit like the 
upperclassmen in that we have 
(taken 
college-level 
classes) 

and think we know how to 
succeed, but, at the same time, 
it’s all so new and it’s not easy to 
transition.”

LSA senior Marissa Miars, 

chair of the Central Student 
Government Commission on 
Transfer 
Student 
Resources, 

said the college experience can 
also be difficult for transfer 
students because administrative 
policies do not entirely know 
how to address their unique 
needs. She transferred from 
Grand Valley State University 
in 2013.

Bush-era official

Richard 
Carmona, 
former 

surgeon general of the United 
States, spoke to a full auditorium 

Friday morning in the School of 
Public Health.

Carmona’s 
lecture 
focused 

on the intersection of public 
health, 
politics 
and 
his 

experience serving in the Bush 
Administration from 2002 to 
2006. One of the main themes he 
discussed was the obstruction of 
important pieces of public health 
policy by special interests in 
Congress.

“The greatest plague I ever 

faced as surgeon general was 
not infections or terrorists, but 
politics,” Carmona said. “The 
plague of politics has its own 
morbidity and its own mortality.”

As surgeon general, Carmona 

issued a prominent report on the 
negative effects of secondhand 
smoke, and served in the federal

Miars said it can be frustrating 

for transfer students — who are 
not entering college for the first 
time — to be treated like freshmen 
who are coming to the University 
from high school. However, she 
notes the University cannot treat 
transfer students like returning 
sophomores or juniors either.

“There’s also the danger of 

going the complete opposite way 
and being like: ‘Transfer students 
have already been to college, 
they already know everything 
and they don’t need our help,’” 
she said. “That attitude can also 
be problematic: We are new to 
this University, and there are 
things we don’t understand and 
challenges to overcome.”

Klootwyk 
and 
Miars 
said 

transfer students face additional 
challenges when choosing the 
right classes, joining campus 
organizations, securing housing 
and making new friends.

According to data provided 

by Public Affairs, the University 
received 
3,691 
transfer 

applications 
in 
total 
during 

Spring, Summer and Fall 2014 
— of those, 1,408 were offered 

admission and 1,041 enrolled.

This would place the 2014 

acceptance rate for transfer 
applications at about 38 percent, 
slightly higher than the 32 
percent 
acceptance 
rate 
for 

freshmen applications for the 
academic year 2014, calculated 
using data from the Office of 
Undergraduate 
Admissions’ 

“Admitted Student Profile.”

About 
53 
percent 
of 
the 

enrolling transfer students were 
out-of-state students.

Less than 35 percent of the 

applications came from students 
at two-year schools, while fewer 
than 65 percent came from 
students at four-year schools 
and the remaining few came 
from students whose current 
enrollment 
was 
unknown, 

according to the data set.

One hundred sixty students 

applied 
to 
transfer 
to 
the 

University 
from 
Washtenaw 

Community 
College, 
and 
of 

those, 51 percent were offered 
admission.

This 
year, 
the 
CSG 

Commission on Transfer Student 
Resources conducted a survey of 
334 current transfer students at 
the University.

The survey found that 75 

percent of respondents said they 
utilize some form of financial 
assistance. 
Fifty 
percent 
of 

participants self-reported their 
socioeconomic status as upper-
middle or upper class, 18 percent 
said they are lower-middle class 
and 15 percent identified as 
working class.

Additionally, 51 percent of 

current 
student 
participants 

transferred from a domestic four-
year institution, 40 percent from 
a domestic two-year community 
college and the remaining 9 
percent 
from 
international 

colleges and universities.

From community college to 

the University

Klootwyk said while many 

students would love to attend 
a university immediately after 
graduating from high school, for 
some students, that is not a realistic 
option for various reasons.

“You want to be able to tell 

everybody: ‘I’m going to MSU’ or 
‘I’m going to U of M,’” Klootwyk 
said. “And so even after a 
successful high school career, I 
went to Muskegon Community 
College. And that wasn’t the 

most glorious choice, but it was 
the cheaper option, and I am 
paying for it.”

He 
said 
though 
he 
was 

unable to come straight to the 
University after high school, 
living at home with his family 
to attend community college for 
two years saved money.

Miars said because Grand 

Valley — a state university — is 
set up similarly to the University, 
she feels she had less difficulty 
adjusting when she transferred 
than her friends and peers who 
attended 
community 
college 

before the University.

“There are just additional 

challenges 
coming 
from 
a 

community college,” she said. 
“Obviously it’s just a different 
academic setting than a four-
year institution, and so there’s 
additional challenges adjusting 
to that.”

Advising and mentoring

Klootwyk said the University 

has some resources to help 
transfer 
students 
assimilate, 

and both he and Miars have 
dedicated their time at the 
University to both improving 
those that currently exist as well 
as developing more.

“There are some resources 

that are really strong and are 
possibly under-utilized, he said. 
“And then there are resources 
that simply don’t exist that 
possibly ought to.”

One of these existing resources 

is 
Transfer 
Orientation 
for 

admitted students.

Klootwyk said orientation can 

be an enormous tool for transfer 
students and can help them 
get a feel for campus life, learn 
about student organizations and 
explore possible housing options.

“However, there’s a downside 

in that for transfer students, 
orientation is much shorter (than 
freshman orientation) — it’s a 
one-day, five-hour process,” he 
said. “At a university this size, 
how much can you tell someone 
in one afternoon?”

Another 
such 
resource 
is 

Transfer Connections, a peer-
mentoring program run by the 
Office of New Student Programs 
for LSA students.

Transfer Connections offers 

new students a chance to join 
together in small groups led by 
former transfer students to ease

 35 YEARS AGO THIS WEEK (APRIL 20, 1980)

Students leave, pets abandoned

CONNOR BADE/Daily

Rapper Common performs at Hill Auditorium on Saturday.

COMMON NIGHT AT HILL

The Humane Society of 

Huron Valley noted a sig-
nificant increase in its ani-
mal population during the 
spring, citing students leav-
ing for college who wanted 
to get rid of their pets. 

Diane Allevato, the orga-

nization’s executive direc-
tor, said the trend is nothing 
new: students often give up 
their pets after they realize 
the new location they are 
moving to does not allow 
them. 

Estimates 
from 
the 

Humane Society show that 
approximately 2,500 ani-
mals were brought to the 
animal shelter last year due 
to student housing prob-

lems. Though all animals 
brought to the society are 
put up for adoption, only 
about 18 percent of them find 
a new home.

Animals were typically 

held for about week and are 
then euthanized as new ani-
mals are brought in. In 1980, 
about 115 animals were ter-
minated weekly at the cen-
ter.

During an average week, 

only a few animals are 
turned in to the society, the 
Ann Arbor Police said. These 
animals typically have own-
ers, but only two out of five 
dogs are picked up by their 
owners within a few days.

Apart from dogs and cats, 

she said the humane society 
also receives exotic animals.

Allevato 
recommended 

that students and communi-
ty members who were forced 
to give up their pets adver-
tise to coworkers, friends 
and family before bringing 
them to the Humane Soci-
ety. 

She explained that an 

animal’s chances of being 
adopted might be higher if 
a potential owner has some 
information on the animal’s 
background.

Netanyahu faces 
coalition building 

challenges

JERUSALEM (AP) — With a 

resounding election victory last 
month, Israeli Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu seemed to 
have an easy path toward quickly 
establishing a coalition govern-
ment with his traditional nation-
alist, religious and ultra-Orthodox 
Jewish allies.

But after weeks of negotiations 

with potential partners, Netanya-
hu is finding the task harder than 
expected and is flirting with the 
idea of reaching out to his main 
dovish rivals to form a unity gov-
ernment. As he decides which 

path to take, he will seek an addi-
tional two-week extension to put 
his coalition together.

Which way Netanyahu goes 

will have broad implications. If 
he sides with the hard-line allies 
that he often calls his “natural” 
partners, Netanyahu will have a 
solid parliamentary majority of 
like-minded parties that could 
avoid much of the infighting that 
plagued the outgoing government 
and provide some welcome politi-
cal stability at home.

But such a coalition — averse to 

peace moves with the Palestinians 
and in favor of expanded settle-
ment construction in the West 
Bank — quickly would find itself 
on a collision course with the 
international community at a time 
when Netanyahu is already feud-
ing with his allies over the mori-
bund peace process and a nuclear 
deal with Iran that he loathes. A 

unity government that includes 
his leftist rivals would help blunt 
that looming international isola-
tion.

Throughout the heated cam-

paign, Netanyahu ruled out the 
possibility of joining forces with 
Isaac Herzog and his center-left 
Zionist Union and vowed to rule 
from the right.

Election results gave his Likud 

Party 30 seats and secured him 
a potential 67-seat majority of 
the 120-seat Knesset along with 
his traditional allies. In negotia-
tions, however, these allies have 
made demands to head power-
ful government ministries, and 
an initial four-week window to 
form a new government is now 
set to expire.

On Monday, he is scheduled 

to meet Israel’s largely ceremo-
nial president, Reuven Rivlin, and 
seek a two-week extension. Under 
Israeli election rules, if he fails to 
form a coalition during that time 
Rivlin then can assign someone else 
the task of doing so.

Israeli prime minister could 
unite with dovish opponents 


their transition to the University.

Additionally, Miars said the 

Commission on Transfer Student 
Resources holds “coffee hours,” 
during which former transfer 
students are available to advise 
new students and share their 
own experience and knowledge.

Though 
transfer 
students 

meet with an academic adviser at 
orientation, Klootwyk said one 
session couldn’t provide any new 
student with all the information 
they need to know.

Michael 
Hartman, 

coordinator of Transfer Student 
Programs at Newnan Academic 
Advising 
Center, 
noted 
that 

Newnan tries to explain at 
orientation the purpose of a 
college adviser, in the hope that 
new students will seek guidance 
from their advisers during their 
time at the University.

“For 
transfer 
students, 

depending on where they’re 
transferring 
from, 
we 

emphasize that (advising) might 
be different from what they’re 
used to in terms of our goal is 
not just to be there to help make 
sure they meet their degree 
requirements, but to make sure 
that they get everything out of 
their degree that they want,” 
Hartman said.

Miars said the proportion 

of transfer students who are of 
lower socioeconomic is greater 
than for the student body at large, 
citing the fact that many choose 
to transfer to the University after 

attending another institution to 
save money. Consequently, she 
said, many transfer students 
feel pressure to graduate in four 
years despite having spent fewer 
years at the University than most 
students.

“That 
pressure 
manifests 

itself in: ‘I need all my credits to 
transfer so I can be at the same 
place I was when I went to my 
former institution,’” she said.

She also noted that, often 

the University accepts fewer 
credits than transfer students 
had hoped, or accepts classes 
for departmental credit and not 
as the equivalent of a specific 
class. As a result, both Klootwyk 
and Miars said it is common for 
transfer students to petition for 
University credit.

Miars said students have had 

success with this procedure, but 
that for a while she did not know 
it was an option, and she said 
she is sure that other transfer 
students are unaware of it as well.

Hartman said students see 

a presentation at orientation 
that explains the process of 
transferring credits and what it 
means to receive departmental 
credit. 
He 
said 
Newnan 

understands 
that 
students 

receive a lot of information 
during orientation and that they 
may not remember some details 
from the presentation. However, 
he said they hope students will 
ask for clarification from their 
advisors in the event that they 
forget what they need to know.

Miars said the University 

will make students aware of 
the resources available to them, 

goal, like the other elements 
of SpringFest, was to engage 
students through their music 
improvisation.

While 
musical 
acts 
were 

performed periodically on the 
event’s main stage on North 
University Avenue on Friday, 
other collaborative activities were 
also held in the area, including a 
fashion show and MTank.

The fashion show incorporated 

numerous 
fashion 
groups 
on 

campus: NOiR, SHEI Magazine, 
EnspiRED and Bronze Elegance. 
Students lined the sidewalks on 
either side of North University to 
watch the show, which used the 
street as a runway.

LSA 
senior 
Karen 
Doh, 

president of NOiR, said NOiR 
was responsible for recruiting 
models and selecting the music 
and visuals to accompany their 
runway walks.

“We felt like one together,” 

Doh said. “It wasn’t just the motto 
… It was the students and the 
attendees, really cheering each 
other on and supporting fashion 
for a cause. It was very successful.”

Doh also noted that the models’ 

runway walks were organized to 
represent the five groups of student 
organizations 
represented 
at 

MUSIC Matters: arts, innovation, 
sustainability, social identity and 
philanthropy.

For example, she said, one of the 

walks involved numerous models 
to represent the construct of social 
identity — four models surrounded 
one central model for the first 
portion of the walk, and ultimately 
the central person walked to the 
front of the pack as an expression 
of individual identity.

MTank, the other major event 

on the SpringFest main stage, 
showcased 
numerous 
student 

startups and made its debut at 
the event this year. Modeled 
after the television show “Shark 
Tank,” University-based judges, or 
“sharks,” fielded startup pitches, 
provided critiques and offered 
monetary prizes to help further 
the startups’ mission.

LSA 
junior 
Saad 
Jangda, 

co-founder of MTank, said the 
group’s second iteration was a 
fun way to increase visibility 
for entrepreneurial efforts on 
campus.

He 
said 
MTank 
featured 

companies 
that 
had 
already 

gone through more formal pitch 
processes, including optiMize’s 
Social Innovation Challenge and 
MPowered’s 1000 Pitches event.

“An event like MTank shows 

that part of entrepreneurship that 
is exciting, that is creativity, that 
is innovation — all in one event 
where every student is walking on 
campus,” Jangda said.

Tom 
Frank, 
director 
of 

the 
University’s 
Center 
for 

Entrepreneurship, was one of 
the MTank “sharks,” and echoed 
Jangda’s feeling that it is important 
to acknowledge and encourage 
student entrepreneurship.

“I think one of the most 

important things we can keep 
doing as a community is that, 
when 
we 
identify 
would-be 

entrepreneurs, 
we 
continue 

to nurture them and provide 
help and support through every 
milestone, so that they stick with 
their ventures for as long as they 
have opportunities for it.”

Frank said his favorite of the 

pitches came from a company 
called Get Up and Go, which 
makes and sells caffeinated food 
products. The startup was one 
of the MTank competition’s 
collective 
judge 
favorites, 

subsequently winning a $1,000 
prize.

The day’s events were not 

exclusive to members of the 
University community — for the 
second year, MUSIC Matters 
also organized a program for 150 
Detroit-area students to come 
and participate in workshops, talk 
to University students and walk 
around SpringFest.

SpringFest culminated with 

the Common concert, throughout 
which 
the 
theme 
of 
people 

working to make collaborative 
change was apparent.

Video 7, a Detroit-based jazz 

collaborative 
that 
involves 

University 
alum 
Brendan 

Asante among others, opened 
for Common.

As the group was launching 

into song, one of its lead singers, 
Antwaun Stanley, told students, 
“I want you to know tonight that 
you have the ability … to change 
the world.”

Common 
held 
students 
to 

a similar standard in a small 
preamble to his performance of 
“Glory” — a song from the movie 
“Selma” that won a Golden Globe 
Award and an Academy Award.

He spoke to recent waves of 

racism in the form of nationwide 
police brutality toward Black 
people, and urged students to take 
part in making a change.

“It’s going to be up to us to 

change the system,” he said. “It’s 
up to us to go out and change the 

situation. We can’t just tweet 
about it and Instagram about it, we 
gotta plan and strategize and be 
active out there — support groups, 
vote, organize groups that will get 
better education for our youth.

“As you all go out as college 

students and people in the 
community, the things that you 
want to change, change them 
yourself,” he said.

After the concert, Common 

told 
event 
organizers 
and 

reporters from The Michigan 
Daily that he appreciated the 
cause MUSIC Matters proceeds 
will go to: establishing a summer 
program at the University for 
Detroit youth that will launch 
in the summer of 2016.

“You all are students,” he 

said. “That is very important. 
I appreciate you all having me 
be a representative of what you 
all are doing because I think 
it’s super important that we 
provide opportunities … for the 
young people that are coming 
up after us.”

“I know hip hop, for me, was 

a way to express myself in ways 
I never had done ever before,” he 
added. “Art and music and culture 
and just being able to be you 
through the art is an important 
thing. So if we empower our young 
people to be able to do that through 
MUSIC 
Matters 
and 
other 

organizations that are supporting 
that, I’m telling you we’re going to 
make a better world.”

Michigan 
and 
Lawrence 

Technological University, but did 
not graduate from either. 

“This company and all that you 

stand for were among the greatest 
joys of his life,” the statement read. 
“Just last month he was in Puerto 
Rico to celebrate with us the grand 
opening of The Mall of San Juan. 
He was so proud of what this 
wonderful company he founded 65 
years ago has accomplished.”

Over the past several decades 

Taubman — whose net worth is 
estimated at $3.1 billion by Forbes 
— gave over $150 million to the 
University. 

He also donated to multiple 

other colleges, including Harvard 
University and Brown University

In 1999, in his first major gift 

to the University, the Taubman 
College 
of 
Architecture 
and 

Urban Planning was renamed 
for Taubman after he donated 
$30 million. The gift was one of 
the largest ever received by the 
University at the time

Starting in 2007, he also gave a 

total of $100 million to start up and 
fund projects within the Taubman 
Medical Institute, part of the 
University’s Medical School. This 
included initiatives such as a $56 
million endowment for research 
into stem-cell therapy and Lou 
Gehrig’s disease. The institute 
also supports a group of scholars 

each year in pursuing individual 
research objectives. 

Last year, Taubman was one 

of several donors to support an 
expansion of the Taubman College, 
pledging $12.5 million of the $28 
million cost. The expansion was 
approved by the University’s Board 
of Regents last March. 

At a 2008 stem cell symposium 

on campus, he also announced 
plans to leave $22 million to the 
University’s Medical School as a 
bequest after his death. 

In a statement to the Detroit 

News Friday evening, University 
spokesman Rick Fitzgerald called 
Taubman a “great friend of the 
University of Michigan.”

Over 
the 
course 
of 
his 

career, Taubman faced several 
controversies, namely allegations 
of price fixing and misconduct. In 
his capacity as the former chairman 
of Sotheby’s auction house, he 
was convicted of conspiring with 
rival 
auction 
house 
Christie’s 

International in 2001 to artificially 
inflate prices and commissions 
received by both, serving close to a 
year in jail. 

In response to the conviction, 

Taubman 
did 
not 
deny 
the 

possibility of price fixing, but told 
the court he wasn’t aware it was 
taking place.

Additionally, in 2012 he was sued 

by a former employee for multiple 
counts of sex discrimination. The 
suit was dropped by the employee 
several weeks later. 

to 
educate 
themselves 
about 

cancer prevention, detection and 
treatment options — even if they 
haven’t been affected by cancer.

“It’s an opportunity to learn 

about breast health and the latest 
advancements in detecting breast 
cancer early as well as types of 
breast cancer that are genetically 
passed 
on 
from 
one 
family 

member to another,” Laatsch said.

Rep. Debbie Dingell (D–Mich.) 

delivered the summit’s opening 
remarks and emphasized the 
importance of continued efforts to 
fight breast cancer.

“Because of the talent like we 

have at the University of Michigan, 
we are going to kill this disease and 
make sure it stops killing people, 
God willing, within the lifetime 
of many of you in this room,” she 
said. “The University of Michigan, 
we thank you for creating this 
coalition 
of 
people 
to 
come 

together to learn, to educate, to 
advocate, to take care of yourself, 
your friends and family and make 
sure that this is a community that 
takes breast cancer on and tries to 
eliminate it forever.”

A panel of University oncologists 

also gave a presentation explaining 
how doctors detect and treat 
breast cancer. They focused on a 
case study from cancer survivor 
and former Cancer Center patient 

Melonie Mitchell, who also spoke 
during the event.

The panel talked extensively 

about 
the 
treatment 
options 

available to patients, including 
surgery, 
radiation, 
counseling, 

breast reconstruction, supportive 
care and drug therapy.

After the panel presentation, 

Mitchell thanked the University 
for playing a role in her treatment 
and recovery from breast cancer.

“I’m thankful for U of M and 

to have been here, all of the 
wonderful research and all of 
the wonderful practitioners and 
providers,“ Mitchell said.

In 
another 
presentation, 

Radiation Oncology Prof. Lori 
Pierce, 
the 
University’s 
vice 

provost for academic and faculty 
affairs, said it’s vital for the 
community to understand the 
modern techniques doctors are 
using to fight breast cancer.

“It’s very important to know 

what goes on behind the scenes,” 
Pierce said. “There has been a 
lot of work that has gone into 
the planning of these treatments 
before patients come in. We 
want to make sure we optimize 
the treatment for our patients 
by giving them the best possible 
chance of cure.”

The 
summit’s 
afternoon 

session, titled “Continuing to 
Thrive,” turned the focus from 
cancer treatment to a discussion 
of healthy living habits designed 
to benefit all types of people — 

including patients, survivors and 
those without cancer.

Katherine 
Goldberg, 
a 

culinary 
specialist 
with 
the 

University’s MHealthy Health 
and 
Well-Being 
Services, 

discussed the role a balanced, 
organic diet plays in good health 
and cancer prevention.

“By eating well, you don’t just 

reduce your risk of cancer but so 
many other types of diseases like 
obesity, Alzheimer’s disease, heart 
disease, macular degeneration and 
diabetes,” Goldberg said.

Public Health Prof. Vic Strecher 

closed the event with a talk about 
the process of finding purpose, 
happiness and comfort.

“Very 
importantly, 
in 
the 

cancer field, we’re starting to give 
meaning-centered 
therapy 
or 

purpose-in-life therapy to patients 
who have cancer and have been 
finding really super promising 
outcomes on well-being,” Strecher 
said. “So my own purpose is to 
help other people find a purpose.”

Ann Arbor resident Jennifer 

Wrisbrod, 
who 
is 
a 
cancer 

survivor, said the event was the 
perfect opportunity to familiarize 
herself with the new research 
available in the field.

“I live with the possibility of 

a recurrence,” said Wrisbrod. 
“It’s not behind me. It’s with me 
everyday and I learned here what’s 
in the future, which provides more 
hope and helps me live every day a 
little better.”

during Hurricane Katrina. He 
later testified before the House 
Committee on Oversight and 
Government Reform, accusing 
the 
Bush 
administration 
of 

censoring 
his 
public 
health 

research because it did not align 
with its political stance.

During the talk, Carmona 

told anecdotes related to various 
public health issues, including 
Guantanamo Bay, tobacco, the 
AIDS epidemic and Hurricane 
Katrina. He said Washington 
politics 
hindered 
potential 

solutions to all of these challenges.

Carmona 
detailed 
how 

partisan politics and special 
interests influenced both the 
state and federal response to 
Hurricane Katrina.

“The system (in Katrina) broke 

down because of special interest 
politics,” Carmona said

He 
also 
warned 
against 

appointing 
surgeons 
general 

and 
other 
officials 
without 

backgrounds in public health.

“All clinical practitioners should 

be, first and foremost, public 
health practitioners,” he said. “As 
public health professionals, we 
deserve the most qualified person 
who merits the position, not the 

person who most aligns with a 
political party... “We must work to 
prevent the politicization of public 
health. I was not the doctor of the 
Republican or the Democratic 
Party; I was the doctor of the 
people of the United States.”

Charley 
Willison, 
a 
first-

year doctoral student in Health 
Management and Policy, said 
Carmona’s 
comments 
were 

insightful.

“I appreciated his sharing his 

experiences and the importance 
of growing the network of 
public health as an authority to 
counteract politics and help to 
validate the credibility of these 
institutions,” Willison said.

policies 
and 
about

Improving resources

Klootwyk said as LSA-SG vice 

president, he has been working 
to 
update 
University 
policy 

to provide admitted transfer 
applicants the opportunity to 
defer 
enrollment, 
an 
option 

available for freshmen applicants 
that want to take a gap year.

He said he would have liked 

to have had that opportunity 
and that a gap year would have 
enriched his education and given 
him the chance to learn more 
about himself before coming to 
the University.

Miars said the Commission 

on Transfer Student Resources 
works with the administration 
to improve policies that already 

exist, as well as create new 
programs catered to the specific 
needs of transfer students.

She said finding housing has 

always been a difficult process 
for transfer students.

“We’re the last ones that get to 

apply for on-campus housing and 
typically transfer students end 
up getting placed in Northwood 
on North Campus,” Miars said.

The commission has been 

working to try and secure more 
housing on Central Campus 
for transfer students to help 
facilitate an easier transition 
for sophomores and juniors who 
may already feel removed from 
social groups that their peers 
have already formed.

“(We are trying to) make sure 

they’re not further isolated by 
being put on North Campus,” 
Miars said.

Miars 
said 
Housing 
has 

reserved spaces for transfers on 
Central Campus for next year.

She said the commission is 

also in the process of developing 
a Transfer Student Resource 
Center on campus that would 
be used as a study and hang out 
space for transfer students where 
they could meet other transfers 
and receive advice.

Newnan 
has 
offered 
the 

commission 
space 
in 
their 

basement for the center, which 
is still in its early planning 
stages, and Miars said it has 
been a very helpful resource for 
the commission as well as for 
transfer students in general.

“The (immediate) hope is to 

create a center where we can 
offer ongoing programming and 
drop in advising specifically for 
transfer students,” he said.

Miars 
also 
said 
the 

commission is in the process of 

producing a website that pools 
all transfer resources in one 
place and would ultimately be 
run by the University.

She 
said 
consolidating 

resources 
will 
be 
helpful 

because it can be difficult to 
find University resources online 
through many different websites.

Miars said she has noticed the 

administration paying a lot more 
attention to transfer student 
concerns in the last few years. 
She said University officials have 
been working to create programs 
that target concerns specifically 
impacting transfer students.

“Five 
years 
ago, 
the 

University of Michigan had a 
bad reputation when it came to 
transfer students; It wasn’t seen 
as the most transfer-friendly 
institution,” Miars said. “Now 
they’re trying to change that and 
making the effort.”

T

oday, information is more 
readily accessible than it has 
been at any point in history. 

Academic faculty 
— including pro-
fessors at the Uni-
versity 
— 
write 

blogs and op-eds 
for personal sites 
and popular news 
outlets. Cable info-
tainment — where 
comedians 
like 

John Oliver spin 
serious issues into 
entertaining bits — 
has made learning about national and 
international affairs increasingly fun 
for the average viewer. New online 
news sites increasingly blend opinion 
and reporting, producing content that 
fits the site’s “brand,” in an era where 
most readers reach content through a 
Google search or Facebook post, not 
paid subscriptions.

Meanwhile, the percentage of 

people who read print newspapers 
dropped 18 points between 2002 and 
2012, according to a Pew Research 
Center survey, and advertising reve-
nue dropped 50 percent between 2008 
and 2012, according to the American 
Enterprise Institute.

But, contrary to what those facts 

alone might suggest, news media is 
a long way away from its proverbial 
deathbed. While traditional sources 
have watched their profit projections 
crash into the red, the industry has 
provided sufficient incentive for new 
entry into the market.

News startups are free to adapt to 

the changing demands of the digital 
consumer absent the constraints of 
existing management and production 
structures. This has enabled them 
to more easily pioneer new ways to 
inform readers.

It’s not that people don’t want to 

know what’s going on in the world 
around them — they just want to 
learn about it in different ways than 
they have in the past. This is sup-
ported by a 2007 Pew study, which 
found that Americans are about as 

informed about current events as 
they were in 1989.

Further, those who got their 

information from non-newspaper 
sources were actually more likely to 
be knowledgeable about the news. 
Fifty-four percent of people who 
regularly watched the Daily Show or 
Colbert Report, 53 percent of people 
who regularly read news websites 
and 50 percent of people who lis-
tened to Rush Limbaugh’s radio 
show had “high” knowledge of cur-
rent affairs. As a point of compari-
son, only 43 percent of people who 
regularly read print newspapers had 
“high” knowledge levels.

But while news sites and enter-

taining news shows are correlated 
with higher information levels, they 
are also more likely to present opin-
ionated content. Compare a site like 
The Atlantic, Quartz or Vox with the 
type of content you see in the news-
paper. It tends to advance a view-
point and certainly doesn’t give a 
cut-and-dry, traditionally structured 
depiction of events like many news 
stories do. The same can be said for 
Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert and 
Rush Limbaugh.

There’s nothing inherently wrong 

with these sources, especially if 
they are actually more effective in 
 

educating readers.

Consuming opinionated content, 

however, requires a whole new level 
of media literacy. Based on what 
I’ve seen in my classes, media lit-
eracy is hardly, if at all, emphasized. 
Let me be clear — media literacy 
has always been important. But as 
media evolves in this direction, it 
becomes increasingly essential to a 
 

well-rounded education.

Several classes use news media 

in class to connect course content to 
real world issues — that’s awesome. 
It makes school more engaging and 
helps students make connections 
between academic work and issues 
that they might already have a bit of 
background on.

One class of mine attempted to 

show the “conservative” side of a 

debate by playing a clip from the 
Glenn Beck show. For a few minutes, 
the class watched, eyes glued to the 
projection screen, as the pundit stared 
into the camera, telling his audience 
that a particular piece of legislation 
represented the decline of America, a 
gross deviation from the vision of our 
founding fathers and would allow the 
state to take unprecedented control of 
family life.

Representing the other side of 

issue, we had read academic and New 
York Times articles.

The professor didn’t say anything 

about the type of video the class had 
just seen. She said nothing of the emo-
tional ploys the speaker had made, of 
the inherent differences between an 
opinion-based cable show and the 
other media forms we had read. The 
video was an interesting addition to 
class, but context was needed to help 
students more effectively understand 
how the media format structured the 
information they had received.

This might sound like a lesson best 

suited for a communications class, but 
probably every student at the Universi-
ty will consume media products — and 
the news articles, shows and blogs we 
consume are products — throughout 
their lives. As professors work to inte-
grate news sources into class materi-
als, it’s important that they also take 
that opportunity to educate students 
about the sources they use.

Our college education is largely 

focused on learning course material 
in preparation of work in business, 
engineering, public service, medi-
cine, law or the wide variety of fields 
University graduates work in after 
college. But our education is also 
meant to prepare us to be thoughtful, 
critical and knowledgeable citizens. 
Understanding how to critically 
evaluate the information we receive 
is a necessary skill — especially in 
a world that increasingly provides 
information that aims to influence 
our thoughts about an issue.

n May 5, Michigan will vote on Proposal 1, an initiative that 
seeks to repair Michigan’s deteriorating roads. Proposal 1 
aims to raise the sales tax from 6 to 7 percent, exempt fuel 

sales from the sales tax and create an additional tax for fuel sales that 
would go toward road repairs and public transportation, among a host 
of other measures. The additional 1 percent in sales tax would help 
cover the revenue lost from fuel sales that currently go to schools and 
municipalities. Though overly complicated and a roundabout way to 
obtain funding, voters should vote yes on Proposal 1 due to the necessity 
of road repairs and lack of sufficient alternative plans.

Passing Proposal 1 would bring 10 bills 

into effect, several of which go beyond simply 
moving around taxes to raise funds for road 
repairs. In addition to raising the sales tax 
and creating a fuel tax for road repairs, this 
proposal would also increase registration fees 
for trucks, do away with discounts for new car 
registrations and add surcharges on electric 
vehicles. Additionally, some of the revenue 
gained through the new fuel tax would be used 
to pay off debt accrued by previous roadwork. 
The Earned Income Tax Credit for low- to 
moderate-income families would also be raised 
from 6 to 20 percent, returning the rate to pre-
2011 levels.

According to a 2014 study by TRIP, a national 

transportation research group, Michiganders 
pay $2.3 billion each year in additional vehicle 
operating costs associated with poor road 
conditions, 
which 
includes 
unnecessary 

repairs. The Michigan Transportation Asset 
Management Council deemed 38 percent 
of Michigan’s roads to be in poor condition. 
While staggering, these statistics can hardly 
come as a surprise to anybody who has driven 
in Michigan; Michigan’s roads are in dire 
need of repair. 

The hike in sales tax Proposal 1 would 

allow is far from outrageous. As of Jan. 1, 
2014, Michigan had the 13th lowest sales 
tax rate in the country, and a one-percent 
increase would hardly push Michigan to 
the top. Furthermore, Michigan’s highway 
expenditures per capita are the lowest in 
the nation, at $126 per capita. Therefore, 
increasing spending on roads seems not only 
reasonable, but integral. Proposal 1 has the 
groundwork in place to fix the roads, which is 
crucial to the safety of Michiganders and the 

state of our roads.

That said, Proposal 1 is not without flaws. It 

is a complicated and bloated plan, which can 
deter and confuse voters. The state legislature 
should aim to draft bills that are concise and 
accessible to voters; Proposal 1 clearly fails 
in this regard. Additionally, sales taxes are 
regressive taxes, and as such, the one-percent 
sales tax hike and added fuel tax would 
disproportionately target those on the lower 
end of the socioeconomic spectrum. This is a 
regrettable aspect of the proposal. However, 
it should be noted that the reinstatement of 
the EITC to 20 percent would help offset 
 

this damage.

Furthermore, while Proposal 1 does include 

wording that mandates local governments 
create a system for tracking roadwork 
projects, measures to ensure preventative 
maintenance are vague. If Proposal 1 passes, 
Michigan lawmakers must develop a plan to 
guarantee the roads stay fixed.

According to the American Association of 

State Highway and Transportation Officials, 
“Costs per lane mile for reconstruction after 
25 years can be more than three times the 
costs of preservation treatments over the

FROM THE DAILY

A ‘mild’ story

One recent evening, a friend and 

I walked down Main Street. The 
night was busy. Cars rushed; wind 
rushed. Boots clucked. We touched 
strangers’ elbows by accident as we 
passed them down the street.

“Yeah, all the Michigan in Color 

pieces recently just haven’t been … 
that good,” my friend said, laughing, 
as we passed the pasta restaurant 
where inside, diners twirled curls 
of spaghetti on silver forks. “I 
mean, they’ve just been mild, like … 
eh,” she made a dark noise with her 
tongue, “It’s all just reiterations of 
the same thing.”

Outside, dusk began to spill across 

the pavement, and just as suddenly, 
the streetlights snapped on — 
automated and glinting across my 
friend’s pale face.

I paused. In front of us, a small 

dog peed into the brush, and I said 
nothing, watching the black hairs on 
my wrist rise in the wind.

As a writer, I have thought often 

about “good stories.” What makes a 
story “good,” as opposed to “mild,” 
or, in simpler terms, bad?

In 
my 
English 
classes, 
we 

learn that good stories require 
a “driving question.” We learn 
that good stories don’t “tell,” they 
“show.” We read Virginia Woolf 
and Chaucer; we learn how to use 
metaphors and footnotes; we learn 
 

how to craft.

But what we don’t learn, and 

what, I suppose, some might never 
learn, is what makes a story ours: 
How do we pass judgment — and 
how do we lay claim — over what 
is inherently our own meat, our 
 

own blood?

What do we do when our stories, 

as People of Color, are dismissed by 
others as too “easy,” “mild,” “the 
same” — clumped together and 
labeled as homogenous in anger, rage, 
pain, shame? How do we still find the 
humility and self-power to celebrate? 
How do we still find the urge within 
us to share, expose, listen?

At times, writing about how I 

move through the world — Chinese 
American, woman, black-haired, 
with two fists and a pink lip — feels 
risky. It feels frightening. It feels 
like yanking out many thick threads 
— pain and joy and violence and 

loss — tugging them from my body; 
threads which, sometimes, do not 
want to be unraveled. They want 
to sit, stuck. My stories contain as 
much pain as they do joy: I have felt 
used. I have felt trampled upon. I 
have felt loved.

When I write, and choose to give 

up my story to the world, it so often 
feels precious and painful. To lose 
a story outside of its safe nest: the 
body. To let a story be bitten into by 
other teeth.

How specific do I need to get to 

make my stories “good” enough — 
real enough — for an “audience” 
 

to “believe”?

If I write that, my sophomore 

year of college, at the intersection 
between North University and 
State, a woman rolled down her 
window and blared, “Hey, CHINK; 
What’re you lookin’ at, CHINK,” 
and I did not make eye contact, and 
the light changed, and I pressed the 
balls of my feet upon the sidewalk 
and kept walking fast, fast, away … 
If I write that, at a retreat, another 
woman told me, “I never even have 
to think about your race; it’s just 
not something I’ve ever noticed 
about you at all … ” If I write that a 
friend once asked me to show him 
how to use chopsticks, and when I 
refused, he laughed, “Are you even a 
 real Asian?”

If I write that I feel, so 

often, pummeled and seared to 
invisibility? 
Or 
brandished 
as 

exotic, alien, prop?

How much more bone do I need 

to show to make myself visible?

My white friends and peers are, 

at times, skeptical that the racist 
experiences within my poetry and 
my world can be so “tidy.” They ask 
me to complicate my claims. They 
do not believe the hurt in me. They 
do not believe that the racism can 
be the same knife making clean cuts 
— again, again, again.

Oftentimes, I am deeply offended 

when I hear my white peers speak 
about “good” stories with regards to 
race. Frequently, the conversation 
revolves only around craft: how 
“entertaining” a story is, how much 
it lives up to their expectations 
of what a PoC writing about race 
should be…

But Michigan in Color was not 

created for “craft.” Michigan in 
Color — and spaces akin to it — 
exist in order for People of Color to 
voice their narratives — not because 
we have “good” or “easy” stories to 
tell; not because we have the desire, 
frankly, to tell them … but precisely 
because these stories thrash inside 
of us. We are pulling them out of us, 
which is, in itself, a revolutionary 
act. These stories will not be killed. 
They are alive; they are injured. 
They are in love; they are tender. 
They are fearful; they are brave. 
So what if our stories are not 
different “enough”? Why should we 
have to dilute — or dress up — our 
experiences for an audience? These 
stories are not meant for outsiders, 
who purport themselves to be allies, 
to call “mild.” They are meant to 
 

nourish ourselves.

I am tired of hearing white 

“allies” and readers express that 
every East Asian woman writing 
for MiC has the “same story”; that 
every Black man writing for MiC 
has the “same story”; that it is all 
“reiterations of the same thing”; 
that acts of racism in literature 
can be “overdone,” “too much,” 
“too obvious.” I call: bullshit. You 
cannot tell our hearts to shut up 
when they cannot, instinctively, 
shut out our lived histories of 
brutality, rage, love, shame. Over, 
over, over again. We will not shut 
up. We will not shut up. We will 
tell the “same” stories — and they 
do not need to be made glossier 
in order for them to be worth 
 

your attention.

Of course, stories should always 

be constructively critiqued. We 
would not be made stronger sisters, 
humans, or artists if our stories 
were not questioned, or prodded at. 
But I am reminded, again and again, 
that the conversation needs to 
center around storytelling not only 
as “craft,” but also as tenderness 
and as loss. All stories are, in part, 
lived experiences, embedded into 
our muscle and skin. It is unfair — 
an act of erasure, even — to treat 
them as otherwise.

VICTORIA
NOBLE

Stephanie Comai, the head of Michigan’s 

Talent Investment Agency recently pointed 
out a major flaw in Michigan’s economic 
recovery: “the talent gap is one of the biggest 
issues facing Michigan.” A key reason why 
this talent gap exists is that almost 40 percent 
of graduates of Michigan’s public universities 
leave the state after graduation. Instead of 
contributing to Michigan’s economy, our 
graduates are taking their talents elsewhere.

In order to maintain the strength of 

Michigan’s economic recovery, our state needs 
to reverse this trend and strengthen the pool 
of young talent that can help our businesses 
develop. To accomplish this goal, Michigan 
needs to create the right incentives for 
graduates of Michigan’s universities to remain 
in the state. That is why on Michigan’s House of 
Representatives needs to pass House Bill 4118. 

If passed, this bill would provide up to 

$2,150 in annual tax breaks on student loans 
for graduates of Michigan universities who 
remain in the state for five years. Why, you 
might ask, is this the best way to address 
Michigan’s talent gap? Because there is one 
thing that all millennials agree on: college 
loans are a major burden.

The Class of 2014 was the most indebted in 

history, and the average college graduate now 
has nearly $30,000 in student loan debt. There 
is widespread need to alleviate the pressure 
of student loans among college graduates, and 
Michigan needs these graduates to remain in 
our state to help spur economic growth. This 
presents our state with a major opportunity. 
Signing HB 4118 into law would increase the 
pool of educated talent that our state needs 
while simultaneously reducing the burden of 
student debt.

The importance of this issue is resonating 

with millennials across the state. Earlier 
this year, a group of Michigan State students 
testified before the Michigan Senate Finance 
Committee asking our legislature to address 
this issue. It’s time for our campus to pull our 
weight and make our voices heard. Students 
on campus need to let our representatives 
know we support this bill. The millennial 
generation has the opportunity to change 
the status quo in Washington. Now, we have 
the opportunity to take ownership for the 
policies that affect our state and our students.

‘Silicon Valley’ 
subverts macho

In season two, the 
weirdest workers 
become the richest

By HAILEY MIDDLEBROOK

Daily Arts Writer

“For thousands of years, guys 

like us have gotten the shit 
kicked out of us,” said Rich-
ard Hendricks 
(Thomas 
Middleditch, 
“Splinter-
heads”), 
the 

twitchy 
and 

brilliant 
pro-

tagonist 
of 

HBO’s 
“Sili-

con 
Valley.” 

“But now, for 
the first time, 
we’re 
liv-

ing in an era 
when we can be in charge and 
build empires! We could be the 
Vikings of our day!”

His statement, delivered in 

endearing nerdiness, speaks not 
only to the rise of tech giants in 
our culture, but the shift in our 
idea of “heroes” — especially 
portrayed in media. Stock male 
characters (or TV’s “vikings,” 
if you will) have forever been 
strong, smooth and assertive, 
like President Fitz of “Scandal” 
or Don Draper of “Mad Men.”

But 
in 
“Silicon 
Valley,” 

creator Mike Judge (“Office 
Space”) flips TV’s macho char-
acters on their meaty heads — 
or, more accurately, gets rids of 
them completely. In this world, 
the weirdest workers become 
the richest bosses, pimply pro-
grammers become overnight 
millionaires 
and 
Kid 
Rock 

becomes the poorest guy at a 
tech kid’s sell-out celebration.

The setting creates a near-

perfect backdrop for comedy: 
while the Valley may be the 

“cradle of innovation,” it’s also 
an adult version of the high 
school cafeteria nerd table. 
Heated debates aren’t about 
NFL rivalries, but over which 
Steve (Wozniak or Jobs) played 
the bigger role in Apple’s cre-
ation. After-work parties con-
sist 
of 
cringingly 
awkward 

small talk, nodding into beer 
bottles and slurping delicate 
“liquid shrimp” — a far cry from 
the raucous, drug-fueled esca-
pades thrown by “Wolf of Wall 
Street”-depicted millionaires. 

Still, money pulses on the 

pristine, color-popping cam-
pus of Hooli, the fictional tech 
company à la Google or Apple, 
where Richard works in sea-
son one. While staying at the 
“Hacker Hostel” with crass 
landlord Erlich Bachman (T.J. 
Miller, “Big Hero 6”), sardonic 
Gilfoyle (Martin Starr, “Adven-
tureland”), 
competitive 
and 

gullible Denish (Kumail Nan-
jiani, “Franklin & Bash”) and 
sweet but unskilled “Big Head” 
Nelson 
(Josh 
Brener, 
“The 

Internship”), Richard designs 
“Pied Piper,” an app that allows 
musicians to screen their music 
for copyrighted material.

Though bland on its sur-

face, Richard’s app contains an 
incredible 
data-compression 

algorithm, which catches the 
eye of Hooli CEO Gavin Belson 
(Matt Ross, “Big Love”) as well 
as of eccentric venture capi-
talist Peter Gregory (Christo-
pher Evan Welch, “War of the 
Worlds”). 
Suddenly, 
Richard 

finds himself in a tug-of-war 
between the two billionaires, 
each with different offers: Bel-
son’s willing to buy the app for 
a staggering $10 million dol-
lars; Gregory will invest just 
$200,000 — but will only take 
five percent ownership of Rich-
ard’s company. 

After 
talking 
to 
Monica 

(Amanda Crew, “Charlie St. 

Cloud”), 
Gregory’s 
assistant 

and the lone female in a male-
driven cast, Richard decides to 
keep Pied Piper and build the 
company himself. What ensues 
is chaos — Richard and his pro-
gramming posse, with the new 
edition of the smart but socially 
inept Jared (Zach Woods, “The 
Office”), must build Pied Piper 
from scratch before Hooli out-
does them with its copycat 
product, “Nucleus.” Season one 
ends with a David and Goliath-
like fight between the rivals at 
TechCrunch, a tech competi-
tion. In a frenzy of last-minute 
coding, Richard’s team wins, 
making Pied Piper the hottest 
thing in Silicon Valley. 

Season two finds Pied Piper 

on the rise, as the team is wined 
and dined by venture capital-
ists eager to invest. Along with 
their newfound fame, another 
change has happened: Peter 
Gregory has died in a tragic 
safari 
accident 
involving 
a 

hippo, 
leaving 
fast-talking 

Laurie Bream (Suzanne Cryer, 
“Wag the Dog”) in his place — 
adding another much-needed 
woman to the scene.

What hasn’t changed in “Sili-

con Valley” is its comedic genius. 
Where the show could’ve pla-
teaued after Pied Piper’s mete-
oric rise, it delivers scene after 
scene of the team scrambling in 
dysfunctional perfection — like 
when Erlich states that they’re 
“three-foot cocks covered in 
Elvis dust,” and Richard blurts 
angrily to investors, “I’m a three-
foot cock! I’m covered in dust!”

Elvis-dust-covered 
or 
not, 

Pied Piper isn’t in the clear yet 
— Hooli’s rumored to be suing 
the company, investments are 
murky and Richard still can’t 
keep his lunch down under pres-
sure. But despite their grow-
ing pains (or perhaps because 
of them), we’re still rooting for 
“Silicon Valley.”

Lyon Opera Ballet 
performs ‘Cinderella’

By COSMO PAPPAS

Daily Arts Writer

Ballet and its practitioners 

study the movement of the body 
in an artistic context. Danc-
ers train for 
the 
major-

ity 
of 
their 

lifetimes 
to 

perfect 
this 

amazing, 
strenuous, 
athletic 
and 

codified form 
of movement. 
The 
Lyon 

Opera 
Bal-

let, 
visiting 

Ann 
Arbor 

this 
week-

end for three 
nights, weds 
the rigorous professionalism of 
a world-class ballet company 
to creative, spectacular set and 
costume design in their produc-
tion of “Cinderella.”

The 
Lyon 
Opera 
Ballet’s 

“Cinderella” is a carnivalesque 
retelling of the story originat-
ing (in written format) with 
17th century Neapolitan writer 
Giambattista Basile in his work 
of collected fairy tales, the 
“Pentamerone,” under the name 
Cerenrentola. Charles Perreault 
and the Brothers Grimm later 
took up the story, the former in 
his 1697 “Histoires ou contes du 
temps passé” (“Stories or Fairy 
Tales from Past Times with 
Morals”) under the name ‘Cen-
drillon’ and the latter in their 
1812 collection “Grimms’ Fairy 
Tales” under the name ‘Aschen-
puttel.’

Featuring toy cars instead of 

carriages and rocking horses in 
lieu of their breathing counter-
parts, this crowd favorite pro-
duction of “Cinderella” is a tour 
de force that would make Walt 

Disney blush. All of the danc-
ers are decked out in elaborate 
costumes, the most striking ele-
ments being the “fat-cheeked” 
baby masks. The production is 
set to Russian composer Sergei 
Prokofiev’s 
score, 
composed 

during World War II and pre-
miered in 1945. Debuting in 
1984, the Lyon Opera Ballet’s 
production has been met with 
broad acclaim and is a con-
tinuous hit. The company has 
performed it annually since its 
premiere.

Maguy Marin, the company’s 

choreographer, took a radically 
unorthodox approach to this 
staple of the classical ballet rep-
ertoire.

“Maguy Marin is one of the 

very few choreographers in 
France very much inspired, if 
I can say so, by what we call 
German expressionism. So it is 
a very theatrical dance,” said 
Yorgos Loukos, the artistic 
director of the company, in an 
interview with The Michigan 
Daily. “And what she wanted to 
do was not like a classical ballet 
with beautiful girls dancing on 
points and boys and princes and 
all that. She wanted to make a 
real theater almost in an Ori-
ental way with huge costumes. 
Everybody is like puppets.”

Loukos explained that the Lyon 

Opera Ballet prides itself on its 
international presence and team. 

With an emphasis on the commis-
sion and performance of contem-
porary ballet, they have performed 
works by renowned choreogra-
phers Trisha Brown, William For-
sythe and Lucinda Childs.

With this emphasis on theatri-

cality and exaggeration, dancers 
are faced with the challenge of pre-
senting the same level of nuance, 
precision and expression without 
their traditional means like their 
faces or their exposed limbs.

“It is like a very strange theater 

for children,” Loukos said. “The 
dancers, you don’t see their bodies. 
They have strange bodies and all 
that. So it is a very theatrical thing 
and it works very well. I’m not sure 
the dancers like to do it, since they 
have masks, big hats and wigs.”

But it would be negligent to 

reduce this performance to the 
gimmick of costume and the 
consequent “knockabout pan-
tomime.” For every measure of 
“childlike wonder” that this show 
brings to the table it has the cru-
elty and sophistication to match.

The Lyon Ballet Opera’s pro-

duction of “Cinderella” is one 
that aims to unite the emotion-
al experience of remembering 
childhood and the coming of 
age and to cull methodological 
insights from many different 
kinds of theater.

“It is a very sophisticated 

work 
theatrically 
speaking,” 

Loukos said. “It is a very full and 
rich approach of what theater is 
together with music and move-
ment. It’s definitely our biggest 
success ... We’ve done it for thirty 
years from Moscow to Beijing, 
and from Toyko to New York, 
again and again.”

Ann Arbor will be lucky as the 

only city in the country this 
year to see the Lyon Opera Bal-
let’s innovative, exciting and 
thoughtful presentation of this 
canonical work of ballet.

Common exercising his right to bare arms.
Thank God for hip 
hop: Common in A2

By ADAM THEISEN

Senior Arts Editor

Less than five minutes into 

his concert at Hill Auditorium 
last 
Friday, 
Common 
was 

already one of the common 
people.

During 
one 
of 
the 
set’s 

earliest songs, “Blak Majik” 
from 
last 
year’s 
Nobody’s 

Smiling, 
the 
Oscar- 
and 

Grammy-winning rapper left 
the stage and ran into the 
crowd, high-fiving jubilant fans 
as he moved through the aisles 
and continued to perform.

It was an early highlight 

of 
an 
especially 
intimate 

performance from Common. 
In front of fans that included 
Michigan 
football 
coach 

Jim Harbaugh and former 
Michigan quarterback Devin 
Gardner 
(with 
the 
latter 

sporting a “Do The Right 
Thing”-inspired Radio Raheem 
t-shirt), Common played a 
career-spanning set ranging 
from songs that were less than 
a year old to tracks that he laid 
down over two decades ago.

Dressed simply in jeans and 

a blue jacket over a dark shirt, 
Common looked confident and 
relaxed, happy to be there yet 
entirely ready to deliver a top-
notch set. Early on, he listed 
off all of his albums in order 
for the crowd, getting cheers 
for each one while mentioning 
that he was “still hungry” for 
more. Common connected with 
the crowd and turned Hill into 
an intimate performance space 
during energetic favorites like 
“Go!” and “Get Em High” as 
well as more dramatic work like 
“Testify.” In fact, he completely 
shattered 
the 
performer-fan 

divide when he brought a fan 
from the front row onto the 
stage, dancing with her for a bit 
before sitting her on a stool and 
performing for her.

“I’ve 
always 
felt 
like 

Michigan was a second home 
to me,” Common said from the 
stage, referencing to the Fab 
Five and the late great Detroit 
producer J Dilla. He backed 
up those words later when he 
stopped “I Used to Love H.E.R.” 
to launch into a freestyle that 
name-checked 
Ann 
Arbor 

landmarks like State Street, 
South 
Quad, 
the 
Fishbowl, 

Skeeps and Rick’s.

“I’m sorta like Jalen / the way 

that I Rose,” he improvised.

The 
show 
was 
organized 

by MUSIC Matters, with the 
proceeds from the concert going to 
a summer camp for Detroit youth, 
and Common gave the evening an 
extra helping of socially conscious 
credibility. 
Though 
fearless 

with his power to put on a great 
show, Common also took care 
to emphasize that he never let 
celebrity get to his head, telling 
the crowd that no matter how long 
he rapped, he would always stand 
for the people.

The night felt like a celebra-

tion of hip hop and old-school 
soul music as much as it did 
a Common concert. For an 
extended period of time dur-
ing the show, Common let his 
DJs spin golden age hip-hop 
tracks, from Biggie to Naughty 
by Nature, while the crowd 
cheered and grooved. In addi-
tion, 
opening 
act 
Antwaun 

Stanley and the Detroit creative 
collective Video 7 started the 
night with Stanley singing a 
medley of classic soul, includ-
ing “What’s Going On,” “O-o-h 
Child” and “Love Train.” Musi-
cal references to De La Soul and 
A Tribe Called Quest also made 
their way into Video 7’s perfor-
mance, and there was also a fan-
tastic reimagining of J Dilla’s 
“Dime Piece,” featuring just a 
harp, synthesizer and vocals.

The 
bittersweet 
memory 

of Dilla, in particular, hung 
over the entire show. Common 
even took some time to recall a 
moment long ago in Downtown 
Detroit, when Jay Dee picked 

him up, and Common became 
enthralled 
with 
the 
music 

playing on Dilla’s speakers and 
was amazed to discover that 
the tracks were Dilla’s own 
productions. Fittingly, it was 
the Dilla-made “The Light” 
that got the night’s loudest 
singalong.

Of 
course, 
the 
show’s 

most poignant moment came 
near the end, when Common 
performed 
a 
stripped-down 

version of “Glory,” his song with 
John Legend that featured in 
the end credits of “Selma” and 
won the Academy Award for 
Best Original Song just a few 
months ago. Accompanied by 
just a piano and back-up vocals, 
Common dedicated the song to 
Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice, 
Eric Garner and so many others 
“who have lost their lives to 
ignorance, to lack of humanity, 
to law enforcement who have no 
respect for life,” Common said.

“We all come from the one 

true creator, the most high,” 
he continued. “And it’s going 
to be up to us to change the 
system. It’s up to us to go out 
and change the situation. We 
can’t just tweet about it and 
Instagram about it; we gotta 
plan and strategize and be 
active out there supporting 
groups, voting, organizing ... 
and as you all go out as college 
students and people in the 
community, the things that 
you want to change, change it 
yourself.”

A hush fell over the crowd 

as Common performed the 
verses quietly and reflectively, 
ending the song not with a 
note of triumph, but with the 
knowledge that more work is 
still necessary if the Glory is 
going to come.

Outside of Hill after the 

show, 
Common 
posed 
for 

a picture with members of 
Music Matters, commending 

them for the job they did and 
encouraging them to continue 
with their work.

“I think it’s super important 

that we provide opportunities 
not only for ourselves and each 
other but for the young people 
that’s coming up after us,” he 
told the group.

“I know hip hop, for me, 

was a way to express myself in 
ways that I never had done ever 
before, so art and music and 
culture and just being able to be 
you through the art is an impor-
tant thing,” he continued. “So if 
we empower our young people 
to be able to do that through 
MUSIC Matters and other orga-
nizations that are supporting 
that, I’m telling you we’re gonna 
make a better world, because 
I know that without hip hop, I 
wouldn’t have the opportunity 
to be here.”

Thank God for hip hop.

Common was 
already one of 
the common 

people.

“I’ve always felt 
like Michigan 
was a second 
home to me.”

TV COLUMN

A final question 

for Netflix

F

or the past eight months, 
I’ve had the pleasure of 
being The Michigan Daily’s 

TV Columnist. With this role, 
I’ve used my journalistic power to 
ask the truly 
important 
questions. 
Why are you 
not watching 
“Shame-
less?” How 
did Patricia 
Arquette go 
from Oscar 
to “CSI” in 
just one week? What did “The 
Mindy Project” ’s racy sex scene 
mean for broadcast television? 
And of course, how could a Halle 
Berry-led television series about 
mysterious alien pregnancies be 
so damn unsatisfying? Now, with 
this final column — the last piece 
I’ll write for The Michigan Daily 
after three incredible years — I 
have one last question to ask.

Netflix built its television brand 

on the binge. In 2013, a press release 
from the company asserted “(Netf-
lix’s) own original series are cre-
ated for multi-episodic viewing, 
lining up the content with new 
norms of viewer control for the first 
time.” The idea: if viewers devour 
entire seasons of “Breaking Bad” in 
one weekend, why not employ that 
mindset with an original series? 
And of course, Netflix’s signature 
all-at-once delivery has paid off 
immensely, forging several hit 
series such as “House of Cards” and 
“Orange Is the New Black.” (Netflix 
doesn’t release ratings information, 
though research has estimated that 
both series are watched by many 
millions of viewers.) And two years 
later, with dozens of original series 
aimed at multiple demographics, 
it’s understandable that Netflix 
would double-down on its lucra-
tive original content. In December, 
Netflix’s Chief Content Officer Ted 
Sarandos announced that the com-
pany’s long-term goal is to premiere 
a new season or series every two 
and a half weeks.

In theory, this iniative is great. It 

means more original content from 
a now-proven television heavy-

weight. But in reality, can this 
work? How much can we binge? 
How much is too much? Because 
right about now, my many binges 
are beginning to infringe on my 
ability to binge it all. (Translation: 
I’ve been staring at this computer 
screen for too long.) My question 
to Netflix is: how can we possibly 
binge this much?

As a massive “Friday Night 

Lights” and “Damages” fan, Kyle 
Chandler’s new series “Bloodline” 
is a perfect show for me. As a lover 
of comic book movies (and a secret 
admirer of Ben Affleck’s campy 
take on the character), “Marvel’s 
Daredevil” is immensely intrigu-
ing. As someone who can quote 
almost any episode of “30 Rock,” 
“Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” 
is a must-watch. And two seasons 
in, how can I give up on Netflix’s 
flagship series “House of Cards?” 
And yet, the progress I’ve made 
on any of these series is unimpres-
sive — 10 episodes of “Schmidt,” 
four of “Cards,” one of “Bloodline” 
and none of “Daredevil.” Why? 
Because all four of these series 
debuted within just weeks of 
one another. But it’s not just that. 
Sarandos’ plan to debut new series 
every two and a half weeks forgets 
to account for one key ingredient: 
Netflix’s non-original series that 
started all the binging in the first 
place. With all the series Netflix 
has to offer — both new and old, 
original and acquired — it’s get-
ting more difficult to reconcile 
the site’s original programming 
with the rest of its catalog. In other 
words, my failure to keep up with 
Netflix’s ambitious slate of original 
programming has a name, and that 
name is “Sons of Anarchy.”

Just one week before season 

three of “House of Cards” pre-
miered, I (perhaps foolishly) started 
what would become a months-long 
journey with the Sons of Anarchy 
Motorcycle Club — six seasons on 
Netflix, right there in front of me. 
And as promised by friends and 
family, the series, led by Charlie 
Hunnam (“Pacific Rim”) and Katey 
Sagal (“Married… with Children”), 
is fantastic. But even more, it’s 
addicting, as if it were created with 

binge-ability in mind. (In reality, 
the series premiered on FX in 2008, 
long before “House of Cards” ’s 2013 
debut.) And as any Netflix enthusi-
ast knows all too well, once you’ve 
discovered that one arresting series 
— a “Breaking Bad” or a “Friday 
Night Lights” or a “Sons of Anar-
chy” — few other shows matter. 
Any free time you have is devoted 
to that series, my television viewing 
predestined for Jax Teller and his 
motorcycle cronies.

Seven seasons into “Sons of 

Anarchy” and “House of Cards” 
remains 
largely 
unwatched; 

“Bloodline” a blip on the radar; 
“Daredevil” nonexistent. And I’m 
OK with that, mainly because there 
are few series that I’ve enjoyed 
as much as I’ve enjoyed “Sons of 
Anarchy.” From start to finish, 
“Sons” was everything you hope a 
television series about a notorious 
motorcycle gang would be — its 
action exciting, its developments 
shocking, its writing and acting 
of the highest caliber. I’m OK that 
for me the words “television” and 
“Netflix” have been synonymous 
with “Sons of Anarchy” for the past 
few months. But is Netflix OK with 
it? Should Netflix be?

As long as Netflix continues to 

release its own series as quickly 
as every two and a half weeks, it 
will become harder and harder to 
enjoy the varied programming the 
service has to offer. And let’s face 
it: we’re not all going to be second 
semester seniors with endless time 
on our hands for very much lon-
ger. At some point, we’re going to 
have to choose. “Sons of Anarchy” 
or “House of Cards?” “Breaking 
Bad” or “Bloodline?” “30 Rock” or 
“Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt?” 
And at that point, when you’re in 
the real world and your time is valu-
able and the hard choices have to be 
made … that’s when we all lose.

So, with this final column, I ask 

Netflix: how can we binge it all?

Believe me, we want to. But you 

need to give us the chance.

Opposition centrists win in Finland election

Incumbent falls, 
new coalition talks 
economic recovery 

HELSINKI (AP) — The oppo-

sition Center Party has won Fin-
land’s parliamentary election but 
its new leader faces tough talks on 
forming a government following 
the success of the populist, anti-
establishment Finns Party that 
placed ahead of the main govern-
ment partners, the conservatives 
and Social Democrats.

Center Party leader Juha Sip-

ila declared victory in Sunday’s 

election and will take on the role 
of forming the new ruling coali-
tion, saying he would approach 
the leaders of the three parties on 
Monday.

“Tomorrow the phones will be 

ringing, and we’ll work out how 
to take it from there,” Sipila said. 
“Finding trust between the future 
government parties is the most 
important factor.”

The self-effacing millionaire 

businessman, who entered poli-
tics four years ago, said the main 
problem in conservative Prime 
Minister Alexander Stubb’s cur-
rent coalition had been a lack of 
trust among the ruling parties.

He warned that Finland, in 

the midst of a three-year reces-
sion, was in a “difficult” situation. 
“It will take 10 years to get Fin-
land back into shape,” Sipila told 
reporters.

Stubb had campaigned on eco-

nomic issues and acknowledged 
his government had not made suf-
ficient reforms. He has also advo-
cated spending cuts of 6 billion 
euros ($6.5 billion) over the next 
four years, a proposal strongly 
opposed by Sipila who says half 
the amount in cuts would suffice.

Stubb conceded defeat.
“It’s a fact that the Center Party 

has won the election,” he said. 

“Now we have to focus ... on how 
to get Finland back on track to 
growth.”

Finns Party leader, Timo Soini, 

who vehemently opposes bailouts 
for ailing eurozone members and 
advocates kicking Greece out 
of the euro, dropped out of gov-
ernment formation talks in 2011 
because the other parties sup-
ported bailouts.

He described his party’s per-

formance on Sunday as a “repeat 
rumble” of 2011 when they rose 
from being a tiny political force 
to become the country’s third 
largest political party, causing a 
political storm and headache for 

European countries preparing 
bailouts for eurozone partners.

Soini 
declined 
to 
discuss 

whether his party would take part 
in future government talks.

“We’re here in Finland to stay 

because we are needed,” he told 
shouting and clapping supporters 
in Helsinki. “Our work has been 
rewarded; let’s reap the benefits.”

With all the votes counted, 

Sipila’s center-right party, which 
traditionally represents farmers 
and land owners, won 21 percent 
of the votes giving it 49 seats in 
the 200-member Parliament —an 
increase of 14 from the previous 
election.

Seeking a 
stylish sense 
of yourself

Infatuation with the 
inimitable icons of 

fashion

By CAROLINE FILIPS

Daily Arts Writer

When people ask me why I like 

fashion, or why I intend to work 
in the industry, I never have an 
immediate, 
straight 
answer. 

At the initial utterance of the 
question, my mind is instantly 
flooded with images of iconic 
Vogue spreads, sketches, fabrics 
and troops of models trotting 
down the runway. I often retort 
with my usual sartorial spiel — 
how fashion is pertinent to all of 
our lives, a reflection of the past 
and an indicator of the future … 
paired with other eye roll-wor-
thy answers that the inquirer 
undoubtedly tunes out.

Sometimes I even share a 

favorite 
childhood 
anecdote: 

the time my fifth grade teacher 
complimented the way my baby-
doll Hollister blouse matched 
my blue braces, swearing I was 
destined for a career in fash-
ion design. Though my tween-
age concept of “fashion” (RIP 
Limited Too) evokes pain and 
shame, it was when I truly 
understood what fashion was 
all about — how style choices 
could be an extension of your 
character. Beyond that, fashion 
says what we can’t; it’s a voice 
we don’t have on our own. Yeah, 
there’s some heavy stuff beyond 
the cloth.

Yet when I mull it over, 

reflecting on the countless 
documentaries 
of 
doyens 

I’ve watched, chic PR-girls 
I’ve 
internet-stalked 
and 

industry editorials I’ve re-read 
endlessly, 
I’m 
reminded 
of 

the fashion world’s inimitable 
icons who keep me so bizarrely 
infatuated.

Though all unique in their 

signature 
idiosyncrasies 
(i.e. 

Tom Ford bathing thrice daily, 
Valentino Garavani’s place-set-
ting fetish, Largerfeld’s … well, 
everything) the industry’s key 
contributors are all bound by 
one distinctive characteristic: 
they’re all so unapologetically 
themselves, and that individual 
eccentricity is translated into 
their work. True fashion icons 
don’t subscribe to any notion of 
normal. Like any arts-related 
endeavor, success in the indus-
try is equal parts raw talent 
and being atypical in whichever 
facet you pursue. It’s a sphere 
for weirdos to thrive and the 

most quirky to flourish. Nor-
malcy doesn’t exist in fashion; 
it’s about the misfits. Fashion 
applauds the individual and 
gives a resting bitch face to the 
conventional.

Ranging 
from 
the 
game-

changing theatrics of wonder-
fully outrageous shows (see: 
McQueen’s Dante, Fall 1996), 
to Linda Fargo’s trademark 
platinum bob — figureheads 
know it’s all about their schtick. 
Famous for her strictly hyper-
bolic candor along with her suc-
cinct and sassy memos, there’s 
no one who emulated fashion’s 
uncanny uniqueness better than 
Diana Vreeland.

Vreeland once said, “You 

gotta have style. It helps you get 
down the stairs. It helps you to 
get up in the morning. It’s a way 
of life.”

Though I regrettably wasn’t 

alive at the height of her editor-
in-chief 
reign 
at 
American 

Vogue in the early ’60s-’70s, it’s 
clear she lived out her mantra, 
embodying 
everything 
style 

was, is and will continue to be. 
In any and all clips of Vreeland, 
particularly 
throughout 
her 

documentary, “Diana Vreeland: 
The Eye Has to Travel,” she’s 
brash, 
outspoken 
and 
100 

percent herself. Her brand of 
style consisted of accentuating 
her anomalous features and 
larger-than-life 
personality. 

She didn’t care what anyone 
thought of her, she trusted her 
instincts and her irrefutable 
eye for style and ran with it. 
And if that leads you to Vogue 
by way of Harper’s Bazaar, 
you’re doing something right.

Vreeland 
emphasized 
her 

own imperfections and those of 
others (she literally discovered 
Twiggy — THE TWIGGY — at 
the peak of youthquake). She 
knew perfection was bogus 
and uninteresting, she foresaw 
fashion’s globalization; in life 
and death, Vreeland is all that 
fashion was and ever will be 
— genuinely absurd, somewhat 
misunderstood and perpetually 
one step ahead.

And 
that’s 
why 
I’m 

enthralled with the sartorial 
sphere. Though I fawn over 
the sheer art of couture and 
commend 
the 
unparalleled 

creativity of les artistes, that’s 
not the ultimate answer to 
“why, fashion?” It’s the allure 
of the edgy factors possessed 
by all the greats — from Anna 
Wintour’s 
polarizing 
snark 

to Diane Von Furstenberg’s 
effortless elegance; that nth 
degree that is so fantastically 
fashion. That’s why.

COURTESY OF DIANA VREELAND

At least she has a good personality.

Fashion’s top 
tier doesn’t 

compromise or 

apologize.

There’s some 
heavy stuff 
beyond the 

cloth.

‘M’ sweeps 

doubleheader, 

series over 

Purdue

By NATHANIEL CLARK

Daily Sports Writer

It’s 
never 
easy 
to 

win both games of a 
doubleheader.

But that’s exactly what 

the 
Michigan 
baseball 

team did on Saturday. The 
Wolverines (8-6 Big Ten, 
23-16 
overall) 
defeated 

Purdue (1-10, 12-16), 7-0, 
in game one and took the 
second contest, 7-5.

“Our guys were on a 

mission,” said Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich. “We 
talked about not thinking 
of today as two games, but 
just thinking of today as 
giving everything we got 
to each inning, each at-bat 
and each pitch.”

The big story of game one 

was Michigan’s pitching, 
specifically freshman right-
hander Ryan Nutof. He 
pitched 7.2 shutout innings, 
giving up two hits and 
two walks while striking 
out five. His start closely 
resembled his March 28 
outing against Maryland, 
in which he struck out six 

and surrendered only one 
run in 7.1 innings.

“You 
don’t 
see 
a 

freshman 
like 
Nutof 

very often,” Bakich said. 
“He’s 
been 
consistent 

with 
his 
attitude 
and 

his 
work 
ethic. 
His 

demeanor on the mound 
and his success doesn’t 
surprise me because of his 
preparation.”

But 
the 
Wolverines’ 

offense chipped in, too. 
The first inning began with 
a single by junior infielder 
Jacob Cronenworth. Senior 
outfielder Jackson Glines 
followed up with a single of 
his own before junior third 
baseman Travis Maezes 
hit an RBI single to drive 
Glines in.

“Top to bottom, we have 

guys that can hit home 
runs,” Glines said. “We 
have good hitters top to 
bottom.”

Another RBI single by 

sophomore 
designated 

hitter Carmen Benedetti 
and a sacrifice fly by junior 
outfielder 
Cody 
Bruder 

gave Michigan a 3-0 lead.

But it wasn’t until the 

eighth 
frame 
that 
the 

Wolverines truly put the 
game out of reach. With 
Michigan up 4-0 at the start 
of the inning, Cronenworth 
got things going with a 
one-out RBI single and

HOW SWEEP IT IS

Wolverines 

earn third Big 
Ten sweep over 

Indiana

By TYLER SCOTT

Daily Sports Writer

The way the Michigan 

and Indiana softball teams 
both attacked the pitching 
throughout 
Saturday’s 

doubleheader looked like a 
welterweight title fight. As 
each team jabbed with the 
bat at the plate, the other 
stepped to counter with the 
glove. The resulting dance 
kept everyone on their toes.

The Wolverines (14-2 Big 

Ten, 41-6 overall) ultimately 
landed the punches that 
mattered and downed the 
Hoosiers in both games of 
Saturday’s 
doubleheader, 

3-0 and 7-1, respectively. 
They extended their lead 
in the Big Ten and earned 
their 
third 
conference 

series sweep.

Indiana 
(5-10, 
14-31) 

came 
out 
swinging 
at 

nearly every pitch, but 
senior left-hander Haylie 
Wagner 
handled 
the 

Hoosiers’ attack, allowing 
no runs and five hits while 
striking out five through 
seven innings in game one.

“Any team can be a good 

hitting team, and they were 
really going after the first-
pitch strikes,” Wagner said. 
“They put up a good fight. I 
was just going out there to 
attack them.”

The first hit from either 

team that did any damage 
was 
sophomore 
Abby 

Ramirez’s stand-up double 
in the third inning of game 
one. Junior centerfielder 
Sierra 
Lawrence 

immediately followed with 
a double of her own, and a 
homer from junior second 
baseman Sierra Romero 
gave the Wolverines a 
three-run lead.

Michigan recorded nine 

hits in game one, but after 
the three-run third inning, 
the 
Wolverines 
failed 

to advance a batter past 
second base.

“I felt that we were 

swinging (too) big,” said 
Michigan 
coach 
Carol 

Hutchins. 
“I 
thought 

(Michigan) was seeing the 
ball well. They were just 
trying too hard to hit it – 
and trying harder doesn’t 
really work.”

Indiana’s 
defensive 

effort was backed up by 
starts from senior right-
hander 
Lora 
Olson 
in 

Saturday’s 
first 
game 

and senior right-hander 
Miranda Tamayo in the 
series finale. They each 
took losses, but prevented 

See BASEBALL, Page 4B

See SOFTBALL, Page 3B

Michigan 
from 
doing 

catastrophic damage at the 
plate.

“It was a good game for 

us because it forced us to 
rely on our pitcher, and I 
thought (Wagner) did a 
great job,” Hutchins said. 
“There are going to be 
games like that. We’re not 
always going to run-rule 
people.”

Lawrence 
put 
the 

Wolverines on the board 
early in game two of the 
doubleheader 
with 
a 

leadoff homer. Her 11th 
home run of the season 
gave 
sophomore 
right-

hander Megan Betsa an 
immediate cushion to work 
with. 
Sophomore 
right 

fielder Kelly Christner had 
an RBI single in the third 
inning that extended the 
Wolverines’ lead to two 
before Indiana responded 
with a run of its own.

The 
Hoosiers 
were 

resilient throughout both 
games, coming within a few 
hits of erasing Michigan’s 
lead multiple times. Even 
with 14 strikeouts from 
Betsa and a fifth-inning, 
three-run jack from junior 
left fielder Kelsey Susalla, 
Indiana had chances to cut 
deeply into a 5-1 Wolverine 
advantage in the sixth 
inning.

With runners on first 

scored when Glines hit a 
triple. A wild pitch on the 
next at-bat allowed Glines to 
score, extending the lead to 
seven.

Glines, after hitting .174 

over 
the 
previous 
nine 

games, 
completed 
the 

doubleheader hitting 6-for-8 
with five runs scored.

“Hitting has peaks and 

valleys,” Bakich said. “I think 
everyone knew that (Glines) 
wasn’t going to be down for 
long. He’s kept the approach 
of hitting line drives and 
having quality at-bats.”

The scoring was more 

spread out in the second 
game as Michigan found 
itself ahead, 4-2, going into 
the seventh inning.

The Wolverines’ offense 

was then put into action, 
as a one-out RBI double by 
sophomore infielder Carmen 
Benedetti and a two-out RBI 
single by freshman infielder 
Jake Bivens extended the 
Michigan lead to three. 
Benedetti finished the day a 
combined 7-for-10 with five 
RBI — four in the second 
game alone.

“Clutch hitting is also 

known as two-out RBIs,” 
Bakich said. “When you 
get those, they are huge 
momentum plays for your 
team. It uplifts the entire 
dugout.”

Somebody has to care

B

efore I had the Daily, I 
lived for those weekends.

The ones filled with 

football and 
baseball early 
in the fall, 
when I could 
sit in front of 
the TV and 
watch games 
all day. Those 
were the 
days I could 
name starting 
lineups, 
where players 
went to college and God knows 
how many stats.

I was eight years old, at the 

house on Merrick Street. I would 
mimic the sport on TV because I 
was too excited to just sit down. 
Sometimes, the games on TV 
were too tense to run around, so I 
moved closer to the TV clutching 
my football.

I was so enthralled with the 

skill that went into hitting a 
100-mph fastball or hitting a 
buzzer-beating 3-pointer. I felt a 
sense of belonging, of pride and 
happiness, the kind you can’t get 
anywhere else, when I saw my 
favorite teams win.

Dad had been in and out on one 

of those afternoons, cleaning the 
old garage, when he returned to 
the living room. I began pleading, 
really crying, for him to join me 
on the couch. I hadn’t been able to 
attend games, so watching them 
on TV was the closest I could get 
to those moments.

“Dad, it’s the Tigers on right 

now,” I said. “They’re down two 
runs, you have to watch.”

“That’s all right, I’ll check in 

later,” he said, ready to turn back. 
“There’s plenty of work to finish 
up outside.”

“Well, somebody has to care 

about this stuff, Dad,” I shouted, 
tears running.

He looked at me, silent and 

confused. He turned to my mom 
for an answer. I lived for this 

weekend; Dad didn’t. He went 
back to work. I watched the game 
alone.

Two years later, Mom 

purchased season tickets to the 
Toledo Mud Hens for the family. 
I cheered the announcement, 
hugged her because I could 
finally go to a game in person. 
She thought they’d be good 
to make us get out and stay 
together, but Mom despised 
baseball games — “They just 
never end,” she’d say — and my 
sister, Elizabeth, looked for 
anything else to do.

So Dad and I went together, 

just the two of us. He’d buy me a 
sausage and peppers from Sofo’s, 
he’d grab a beer for himself, and 
we would watch a bunch of guys 
we’d never heard of. I’d be upset 
when they lost and chatty when 
they won. He was indifferent, 
looking at programs and chatting 
up the neighbors in the seats.

On weekdays in the summer, 

when we had moved to the house 
on Amsler, I’d sit outside on the 
brick porch 
steps. Dad used 
to call to say 
he was coming 
home, so I sped 
through dinner 
and rushed 
outside to wait 
for him.

I’d hold 

my new red-
and-blue mitt, 
tossing the ball 
to myself while Dad’s mitt was 
waiting. He’d come home in a 
shirt and tie, as usual, and most 
times he’d say he had to change 
and eat. I’d roll my eyes and beg 
him to hurry.

His shoulder was almost 

always sore, so he threw 
underhand pop-ups and 
grounders as I kept running 
and running as the sun faded. I 
didn’t have many close friends in 
Adrian, but Dad was there.

I still watched games night 

after night. My parents put me to 
bed and I’d proceed to form my 
pillows into the shape of a body 
under my sheets. I’d sneak to 
the basement to watch whatever 
game was on. Dad found out, 
after a few weeks, but he didn’t 
stop me. He saw how much I 
cared.

And he saw how much I cared 

about playing sports too, so he 
did what he could to support 
me. When the middle school 
basketball team needed a coach, 
I begged him once more, “Dad, 
please, I can’t play unless you’re 
there.” I cared, and he watched 
the way I pouted. He coached us 
that season.

When I ran cross country in 

high school, he helped pay for 
all six pairs of shoes because 
I researched them for hours. 
Eventually, he’d take the 
stopwatch with Mom and call out 
times when I asked.

Really, though, no one cared 

like I did until I walked into the 
Daily in January of my freshman 

year. There, I 
found people as 
crazy as me.

I called 

Mom and Dad 
in January, “I 
know what I 
want to do. I 
want to write 
sports.”

I wrote 

as much as I 
could, called 

Mom and Dad again, begging 
them to read my stories “just this 
time.” Sometimes, they did read. 
Sometimes they just listened.

They sat silent when I told 

them about trekking back from 
Sault Ste. Marie in the middle of 
a blizzard with Laurila driving. 
They laughed as I told them 
about singing Mulan in the 
middle of Iowa to keep Jeremy 
awake. And they cheered when 
I told them that the great people 
at Sporting News wanted the 

kid who cared so much for an 
internship.

I called to tell them when I 

met Dan and Alejandro, who 
also moved close to the TV. We 
all groaned when Trey Burke’s 
block was called a foul, and we all 
argued about what we thought 
was wrong with Michigan 
football (but this column is 
already long enough). We moved 
in with David, we drank (a lot of) 
cheap beer and we all cared.

Imagine if I hadn’t started 

believing that day that someone 
had to care? How lucky was I 
to have a place where I had met 
my best friends, to find people 
who found the joy in watching 
a step-back 3-pointer save 
the day or 40-yard heave fall 
into Roy Roundtree’s hands. I 
became passionate about beating 
(destroying) The State News, 
about fighting in a game of chair 
monkey with Max and Max or 
breaking a light with Alejandro.

And so at the Daily, watching 

sports and telling stories — 
like Andrew Copp’s or Drake 
Johnson’s, athletes, students who 
cared enough about what they 
did and who they were to share 
— were ways for me to speak to 
Dad. He cared for me as I cared 
for the 50 members of the sports 
section.

Eventually, Dad even learned 

how to use the iPad to read my 
stories — he had never even 
turned on a computer before that.

A year ago, during a hockey 

game, I sat in the press box when 
the police officer came over 
calling my name (I should have 
stopped stealing Cokes). She 
announced that my father had 
come up, said he needed to see 
me. It was the first time he had 
come to a game at which I was 
working.

I left my seat, watching the 

other reporters snicker and stare. 
I found him laughing with an 

usher.

“Pretty neat setup you get up 

here,” my dad said. “What’d did 
you have to eat? And look at all 
these TVs. Did you see me down 
there at all?” He walked around 
and lingered in the middle of that 
2-1 game, smiling the entire time.

I stayed in that moment briefly 

— long enough to realize that 
Dad had always cared. And that 
someone — the Daily, Dad and 
I — always would.

and second and the tying run on 
deck in the sixth inning, Hoosier 
outfielder Brianna Meyer lined 
a shot into the gap in center 
field. If the ball fell in, it would 
have scored at least one run, but 
Christner extinguished that hope 
with an acrobatic diving catch 

and throw to second base to turn 
the double play.

“Honestly, when it was hit, 

I didn’t think I had any chance 
of getting to it,” Christner said. 
“When I caught it, I kind of freaked 
out but I was like, ‘Alright, I’ve got 
to finish the play.’ I jumped up and 
saw the girl was still running back 
to second, so I tried to get her out at 
second then too.”

Michigan 
erupted 
in 

celebration of Christner’s display 
of athleticism. And just when 
Indiana got its best chance to come 
back, the Wolverines took it away.

In a series condensed into two 

days, the play encapsulated the 
sweep of the Hoosiers.

Just when Indiana thought it 

could sneak by the Wolverines, 
Christner delivered the knock-out 
blow — squashing any chance of a 
comeback.

Majoring in collegiate athletics

Y

ou warned me I couldn’t 
major in football spec-
tating, but you must 

have realized 
during one 
of the dozens 
of surgeries 
in Ann Arbor 
that nothing 
would keep 
me from the 
University of 
Michigan.

We would 

walk down 
State Street 
before doctor’s appointments, 
and I would sprint from store 
to store pointing at the winged 
helmets and block ‘M’s in the 
windows. You’d eventually 
give an exasperated sigh at 
my unbridled enthusiasm and 
usher me away to the hospital.

You must have known how 

much this place meant to me. On 
the worst day of my life, you sang 
me to sleep with “The Victors” 
as the anesthesia dripped like 
shards of ice into my arm.

During the month that 

followed, when the discomfort 
meant I’d spend entire days in 
bed, you watched me struggle 
up a flight of stairs to watch 
Michigan’s bowl game. The 
Wolverines won, and then they 
carried Lloyd Carr off on their 
shoulders. A 
picture of that 
moment still 
hangs on my 
wall.

It was my 

freshman year 
of high school, 
but I knew 
then I wanted 
to go to school 
here. And 
I’m not sure 
what drew me to Michigan over 
Michigan State or anywhere 
else, but thank you for helping 
make this possible.

* * *

My story begins outside 

my grandparents’ tin-roofed 
home in Orotina, Costa Rica. 
My cousin and I would play 
fútbol until abuela called us in 
for lunch, and we’d scarf down 
our meal and scurry back out 
until it became too dark to see 
the ball. When we outgrew 
the backyard, we’d play on the 
streets. The fence would be the 
goal, the birds our crowd, our 
scrapes and bruises the reward 
for a day well spent.

My story wears the red 

and white of 
Albion High 
School. We 
cared so much 
about fielding 
a squad each 
year that 
several of 
us would 
host foreign 
exchange 
students 
— on the 

condition they joined the team. 
Opponents called us the Albion 
Internationals, and I was voted 
captain twice. Our mix of 
Black, white and every color in 
between represented the very 

best of sports.

My story is a soccer field 

in Pader, a city in northern 
Uganda which was devastated 
by a terrorist group around 
the turn of the century. I stood 
between the wooden goal posts 
that had been erected behind an 
elementary school and joined 
21 other men as we played odilo. 
They didn’t understand my 
English, and I couldn’t translate 
their Acholi, but we spoke 
with our feet. They called me 
Alex Andrew, and I was their 
goalkeeper.

My story involves the passion 

of the Michigan Ultras. One 
night during welcome week my 
sophomore year, I stood at a 
match next to a freshman who 
didn’t know any of the cheers. 
For the next 90 minutes, I 
taught her. Michigan lost, but I 
got the girl.

And this story will end next 

week at the Big House, where 
100,000 people recently came 
to watch soccer.

Somehow, that’s fitting.

Sports provide people the 

outlet to reach immortality, 
where flesh, blood and tears 
may fade — but not the 
memories. They offer a place 
that fosters extraordinary 
moments, where someone 
can shatter the conventional 
boundaries that restrict us and 
achieve the spectacular.

Denard Robinson 

demonstrated that when he 
lost his shoes and kept running 
straight into Michigan lore. So 
did Trey Burke with his dagger 
3-pointer against Kansas. Their 
emotions were my emotions, 
their accomplishments mine. 
Maybe we all yearn for 
that freedom to be a part of 
something unforgettable.

There were instances that 

transcended the sports realm, 
too, like when Austin Hatch 
tallied his first point or when 
Devin Gardner comforted an 
Ohio State player after a season-
ending injury, reminding 
everyone how, at the core of 
athletic competitions, we’re 
all human. In those moments, 
the result became secondary 
to remarkable displays of 
humanity.

But sports have always meant 

more to me than a score.

The days I spent with a 

tube strapped to my leg helped 
me appreciate my ability to 
walk, run and play soccer. I’m 
appreciative every day for those 
opportunities. Thank you, Dr. 
Bloom and Dr. Malaeb, for 
making me better.

Thank you to Costa Rica 

for the 2014 World Cup. You 
allowed a nation to believe in 
the impossible.

Dad, thank you for your 

stories. Thank you for Spanish 
and for Costa Rica — for 
opening those doors in my 
world.

You warned me I couldn’t 

major in football spectating, 
Mom. But here I am. I’ve 
majored in football spectating, 

fútbol spectating, basketball 
spectating and hockey 
spectating. Thank you for 
recognizing how happy it 
makes me. Thank you for 
realizing it makes me feel free.

Thank you, Michigan. You 

were my best four years.

Zúñiga would like to thank 

everyone who has influenced 

his life — especially Greg, Dan,

‘M’ misses Super Six

By CINDY YU

Daily Sports Writer

Less than two-tenths of a 

point separated the Michigan 
women’s gymnastics team from 
securing a spot on the floor at 
Saturday’s Super Six.

Though the Wolverines came 

up just a hair short of qualifying 
among the top three teams in 
the first NCAA semifinal session 
Friday, they still have much to 
be satisfied with. Not only did 
they close out the season as the 
only team in the nation to score 
at least 49.000 in all 52 rotations, 
but they also counted zero falls 
in competition.

“I think everyone did their 

jobs like they were supposed 
to, which ended up not being 
enough to make it to the next 
day,” 
said 
sophomore 
Talia 

Chiarelli. “We’re still really 
happy with how we performed.”

Sophomore 
Nicole 
Artz 

was named a first-team All-
American in the all-around with 
a score of 39.425, and freshman 
Brianna Brown was awarded 
second-team honors with her 
39.325 total. The team put up 
the second-highest team total 
in program history at the NCAA 
Championships.

At the Fort Worth Convention 

Center in Fort Worth, Texas, 
No. 6 Michigan (27-6 overall) 
scored 197.025 to place fourth 
among six teams. No. 2 Florida 
and No. 3 Utah tied for first 
in the qualifying round with 
scores of 197.475, while No. 11 
Stanford rounded out the top 
three with a total of 197.175. 
No. 10 Georgia and No. 7 UCLA 
finished in fifth and sixth with 
scores of 196.600 and 196.400, 
respectively.

For the third consecutive 

year, Michigan drew the same 
rotation order at the NCAA 
Championships.

“Our biggest obstacle was 

having to end on a bye,” said 
Michigan coach Bev Plocki. 
“Hopefully things come in three, 
and we’re done with that.”

The Wolverines started the 

meet on the uneven bars. Though 

the entire lineup performed well, 
with each gymnast recording at 
least a score of 9.800 and a few 
even sticking their dismounts, 
leading off on that particular 
event may have been to the 
team’s disadvantage.

“Typically, the judges will 

start out a little conservatively 
and then loosen up, so I think 
that it really hurt us,” Plocki said. 
“We had a great bar rotation, but 
as the meet went on, it seemed 
like things loosened up over 
there, and other teams were able 
to take advantage of that.”

Among 
all 
six 
teams, 

Michigan had the lowest total on 
bars with a 49.225.

On the balance beam, the 

Wolverines 
matched 
their 

program record of 49.250 for the 
highest total on the event at an 
NCAA Championships. Artz and 
Chiarelli led the squad in the 
anchor positions with wobble-
free routines that each scored 
tallies of 9.900. Both gymnasts 
qualified to Sunday’s event finals 
and were named NCAA All-
Americans on beam.

While their scores ranked 

among the highest in the session, 
it was challenging to pinpoint 
what the judges took off in 
Chiarelli’s set.

“I have no idea where they 

came up with a tenth of a 
deduction because (Chiarelli) 
did not have an eyelash out of 
place in the routine and she 
stuck her dismount,” Plocki 
said. “She does a round-off 
double back, which is a more 
difficult dismount than most 
people do.”

The Wolverines finished the 

day strong on vault. Chiarelli, 
Brown and senior Brooke Parker 
stuck their Yurchenko fulls. 
Chiarelli performed the best 
vault in the lineup, scoring 9.875. 
After she stuck her vault cold, 
she immediately sprinted off 
the podium and was welcomed 
by high fives from all of her 
teammates.

“That was actually the first 

vault I’ve stuck all season,” 
Chiarelli said.

Though the vault gave Plocki 

chills, the score may not have 
warranted its merit.

“Her vault was the best I’ve 

ever seen her do, and actually, 
there was a good part of the 
audience that was kind of booing 
when they put up the 9.875,” 
Plocki said. “Nevertheless, she 
had the meet of her life.”

During 
the 
event 
finals, 

Chiarelli, senior Sachi Sugiyama 
and Artz represented the Maize 
and Blue well. On floor, Chiarelli 
and Sugiyama tied for seventh 
with identical scores of 9.900. 
Both 
gymnasts 
showed 
off 

explosive tumbling sets and 
expressive dance choreography.

Sugiyama 
closed 
out 
her 

season in fashion. The Texas 
native performed the last routine 
of her collegiate career before a 
hometown crowd.

“I 
couldn’t 
stop 
smiling 

throughout the whole routine,” 
Sugiyama said.

On beam, Chiarelli finished 

eighth with a score of 9.825. 
and Artz finished 12th with an 
impressively improvised routine 
that scored 9.8125.

“My heart breaks for these 

kids, the work they put in 
and everything to not be able 
to 
compete 
at 
Super 
Six,” 

Plocki said. “I think that our 
gymnastics should’ve been on 
the floor then, but I’m certainly 
not disappointed in any way, 
shape or form with any of these 
young ladies or their efforts.

“I couldn’t be more proud of 

everything they’ve done and 
accomplished this season.”

While 
success 
may 
be 

measured in wins, losses and 
championships, 
the 
personal 

development of the Wolverines 
this season has been tremendous. 
After graduating six seniors 
from last year’s team, many 
expected Michigan to have a 
rebuilding season this year. But 
in the end, it proved it belonged 
among the rest.

With Artz, Chiarelli and the 

majority of their teammates 
returning next season, as well 
as a strong incoming freshman 
class joining the team, the 
Wolverines can only improve.

Wolverines clinch sixth 
straight conference title

By BETELHEM ASHAME

For the Daily

The Michigan women’s tennis 

team has enjoyed an impressive 
run in Big Ten play all season 
long, and this weekend was the 
culmination of the success the 
Wolverines have achieved.

Michigan 
traveled 
to 

Columbus on Friday to take on 
No. 17 Ohio State (9-1 Big Ten, 
17-5 overall) in a must-win match 
with a share of the Big Ten 
Championship on the line.

And in order to win the 

title outright, the 14th-ranked 
Wolverines had to earn it at Penn 
State (8-3, 12-10) on Sunday.

“We haven’t really thought 

about it that much,” said senior 
Sarah Lee. “We’re looking at both 
as just another match because 
we’re focused on each team, like 
we’ve been doing all year.”

The Wolverines (11-0, 21-3) 

started off on the right foot 
Friday against the Buckeyes, 
earning the doubles point from 
the No. 1 and No. 3 positions. The 
No. 1 pair of senior Emina Bektas 
and freshman Alex Najarian 
went up 3-1 and eventually pulled 
out an 8-3 victory.

The No. 3 doubles pair of 

Michigan freshman Mira Ruder-
Hook 
and 
sophomore 
Sara 

Remynse had a tougher battle in 
their match. The two fell behind 
by three games early before 
rallying to salvage a 4-4 tie. The 
back and forth affair reached a 
7-7 tie, but Michigan’s duo took 
full control over the tiebreaker, 

winning 7-1, to secure the doubles 
point.

“Mira 
was 
definitely 
the 

reason we won that match,” 
Remynse said. “She keeps being 
positive and making me feel 
comfortable. When we’re down, 
we play more aggressively, and 
when we play within ourselves, it 
works out.”

In 
the 
singles 
matches, 

Remynse 
and 
junior 
Ronit 

Yurovsky 
gave 
Michigan 
a 

comfortable 3-0 lead over Ohio 
State with straight-set wins at 
the No. 2 and No. 6 positions. 
Both Yurovsky and Remynse 
earned 6-4, 6-2 victories against 
their Buckeye counterparts.

At No. 3 singles, Najarian 

defeated her opponent, Ohio 
State’s Sandy Niehaus, 6-0, 2-6, 
7-6 (5) with a 7-5 tiebreaker 
win to clinch a share of the Big 
Ten title for the Wolverines. 
Michigan would go on to finish 
the match with a 6-1 victory over 
the Buckeyes.

After passing its first test 

against Ohio State, only the 
Nittany Lions stood in the way of 
Michigan’s quest for the Big Ten 
Championship.

“We’ve been taking it one match 

at a time,” said Michigan coach 
Ronni Bernstein. “We haven’t 
been looking at it like we needed 
two matches to do it because we 
don’t overlook anybody.”

The Wolverines got off to 

an even brighter start Sunday 
in the doubles matches when 
Remynse and Ruder-Hook made 
quick work of the opposition, 

cruising to an 8-0 win. Bektas 
and Najarian followed in their 
footsteps by securing an 8-3 
victory against Penn State’s No. 
1 pair of Katia Blik and Victoria 
Kisialeva to clinch the doubles 
point for Michigan.

In singles play, the Wolverines 

needed just three wins to capture 
the title.

And they earned all three wins 

in impressive fashion.

Both Lee and Remynse quickly 

dispatched 
their 
opponents 

with 
6-3, 
6-1 
victories. 
In 

between, Ruder-Hook sunk her 
No. 5 singles opponent Devan 
McCluskey and dropped only one 
match in the process.

With those performances, the 

Wolverines earned a 4-0 victory 
over Penn State and the greater 
prize of capturing their sixth-
straight Big Ten Championship 
with an undefeated record.

“I’m excited for the girls,” 

Bernstein said. “The regular 
season is long and it’s challenging, 
and you have to stay healthy. But 
I’m proud of them because they 
worked hard. I thought we played 
really well. It’s not so much about 
how many in a row because every 
year is different, but it’s definitely 
good to come through.”

With the two victories this 

weekend to end the regular 
season, Michigan has now won 
15 consecutive matches and a Big 
Ten Championship to boot. The

The insurance runs proved to 

be vital with the Boilermakers 
mounting their own comeback 
in the eighth. First baseman Kyle 
Wood singled to center field to 
drive in a run, and outfielder 
Brett Carlson hit a two-RBI single 
to left two at-bats later to cut the 
Wolverines’ advantage to one.

Michigan appeared to be on 

the verge of falling behind as 
Purdue loaded the bases with two 
outs. But junior left-hander Evan 
Hill got the Wolverines out of the 
jam when he got Boilermakers 
first baseman Daniel Sander to fly 
out to center.

Michigan’s 
weekend 
series 

sweep was its first in Big Ten play 
since April 12-14, 2013, against 
Penn State, while the Wolverines’ 
last doubleheader sweep occurred 
May 11, 2008, against Minnesota. 
Michigan now sits in fifth place 
in the Big Ten standings, three 
games behind Illinois for the top 
spot.

Stars shine bright in sweep

Friday, roughly 15 to 20 

scouts were in attendance to 
watch junior right-hander Jacob 
Cronenworth pitch.

What they may not have 

been expecting, though, was his 
dominating performance at the 
plate.

Cronenworth, 
along 
with 

senior 
centerfielder 
Jackson 

Glines 
and 
sophomore 
first 

baseman 
Carmen 
Benedetti, 

dominated Purdue’s pitching all 
weekend. The trio hit .659 on the 
plate and accounted for 13 runs 
scored and 14 runs batted in of 
the team’s 23 total runs.

Friday, Cronenworth set the 

tone for the Wolverine offense, 
reaching base four times in five 
plate 
appearances. 
Michigan 

scored nine runs on the day, 
with Cronenworth credited with 
either a run scored or an RBI on 
six of them.

In the first game Saturday, 

Cronenworth picked up right 
where he left off, going 4-for-
5. The only change in his plate 
appearance was that of additional 
power, sending the ball over the 
395-foot marker in straightaway 
center field.

“I didn’t even expect it to 

go out,” Cronenworth said. “I 
thought it was just going to be a 
deep fly out, but it got caught up 
in the wind up there.”

Over the last two years, it 

has been Glines who has been 
the Batman to Cronenworth’s 
Robin. As the top two hitters in 
the lineup, the duo presents a 

daunting challenge in the first 
inning for any opposing pitcher.

Friday, Glines had three hits 

in five plate appearances. He 
managed to top those numbers 
Saturday.

Not 
to 
be 
outdone 
by 

Cronenworth, Glines reached 
base eight times in 10 plate 
appearances 
in 
the 

doubleheader. 
Like 
Cronenworth, 
he found his 
power stroke, 
tallying three 
doubles 
and 

one triple over 
the two games.

It was an 

encouraging 
line for Glines, who is back to 
leading the conference in hitting 
at .399 and on-base percentage at 
an even .500. The senior seems 
to be past a nine-game stretch in 
which he hit just .147.

“Hitting has some peaks and 

valleys,” said Michigan coach 
Erik Bakich. “Jackson Glines is 
fortunate that everybody knew 
that he wasn’t going to be down 
for long. He wasn’t really down, 
he just had some tough luck with 
balls hit right at people.”

Adding 
to 
the 
onslaught, 

Benedetti has been the third 
member of the Wolverines’ big 
three offensively this season.

Benedetti joined the party 

Saturday in the first game, also 
going 4-for-5. He went 3-for-5 in 
the second game, and collected 
four RBI, three of which plated 
Glines.

The team’s cleanup hitter has 

hit .510 over his last 12 games, 
improving his average to .378 — 
good for second in the Big Ten 
behind Glines. He also leads the 
conference in RBI with 44, 10 
clear of second place.

Bakich has said that last 

season, the team often relied 

on 
its 
stars 

to do all the 
heavy 
lifting 

on 
offense. 

That 
hasn’t 

been the case 
this 
season; 

the lineup is 
much 
deeper 

with 
players 

like freshman 
shortstop 
Jake 
Bivens 

consistently 
contributing 
and 

senior catcher Kendall Patrick 
turning in quality performances 
like his 3-for-4 line on Friday. 
Even 
sophomore 
outfielder 

Johnny Slater — gently used for 
much of his collegiate career 
— posted two multi-hit games 
in the weekend sweep that 
saw 
Michigan 
outscore 
the 

Boilermakers, 23-8, in three 
games.

The Wolverines have been 

able to win without their stars 
contributing, just like they did 
during the stretch when Glines 
hit .147. But the Wolverines are at 
their best on days like Saturday, 
when Cronenworth, Glines and 
Benedetti all reached base four 
times in five plate appearances.

Though 
Michigan 
doesn’t 

need its stars to shine to win, it 
certainly helps to have them.

“Everybody knew 

that he wasn’t 

going to be down 

for long.”

Hitting proves contagious

By CHRIS CROWDER

Daily Sports Writer

In the second inning of the 

Michigan softball team’s game on 
Friday, an epidemic came across 
the team. The hits didn’t stop 
coming from the Wolverines as 11 
straight batters reached base and 
10 of them scored.

The virus easily spread from 

teammate to teammate, and it 
doesn’t look like the Wolverines 
will be cured of it any time soon.

The epidemic that came across 

the team was hitting, and it’s 
more contagious than ever.

“Once they all start hitting, 

they all believe we can hit,” said 
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins. 
“I like for them to focus on every 
pitch as the same, whether bases 
are loaded or if nobody is on.”

This weekend, No. 4 Michigan 

(14-2 Big Ten, 41-6 overall) 
excelled at the plate, especially 
with runners in scoring position, 
going 11-for-32 in such situations. 
Hitting when it mattered most 
led the Wolverines to a sweep of 
Indiana (5-10, 14-31).

In the first game, Michigan 

went 
6-for-15 
with 
runners 

in scoring position, including 
3-for-6 with the bases loaded in 
the second inning alone. Those 
at-bats contributed six runs to 
the 10-run frame. Nearly every 
Wolverine batter stepped up 
when they walked up to the plate. 
Not a single Michigan player 
struck out in the second, and 
every batter put the ball in play, 
forcing Indiana’s defense to react. 
The Hoosiers had two errors in 
the inning, giving the Wolverines 
more opportunities to keep piling 
on their lead.

Michigan had 15 batters step 

up to the plate in the second. 
The two freshmen in the lineup, 
catcher Aidan Falk and first 
baseman Tera Blanco, each had 
two hits in the inning, driving 
two and three RBI, respectively. 
They were responsible for the 
first two runs of the inning, 

starting the rally to take control 
of the game.

“(When the bases are loaded), 

I try not to think about it,” Falk 
said. “Because if I start to think 
about it, it just doesn’t end up 
well. I didn’t even know the bases 
were loaded.”

Soon after the freshmen had 

their first at-bats, junior second 
baseman 
Sierra 
Lawrence 

tattooed a three-run homer to 
put the Wolverines up, 7-0.

Michigan wouldn’t fare as well 

with runners in scoring position 
in the third inning, going 0-4. 
After that, there wouldn’t be 
another at-bat with runners in 
scoring position for the rest of the 
game. But the damage was done 
as Michigan won game one, 11-2.

In game two of the weekend, 

the 
contagious 
hitting 
with 

runners 
in 
scoring 
position 

continued. In the third inning, 
the Wolverines went 2-for-3 
with runners in scoring position, 
scoring all three runs in those 
situations. Sophomore shortstop 
Abby 
Ramirez 
and 
junior 

centerfielder Sierra Lawrence 
hit back-to-back doubles, with 
Lawrence knocking in Ramirez 
on her knock into the right field 
gap. Romero was the next batter, 
and again, poked one over right-
field wall, this time for a two-
run homer. The home run was a 
display of Romero’s power, as the 
ball was nearly in the left-side 
batter’s box. But she stuck her bat 
out anyway, giving Michigan a 
3-0 cushion.

The Wolverines finished 2-for-

7 with runners in scoring position 
in game two, holding on to the 
3-0 lead to defeat the Hoosiers by 
the same score.

“We’re not always going to 

run-rule people,” Hutchins said. 
“I didn’t always like our at-bats, 
but I like the fact that we were in 
a tight game.”

Game three of the series 

started with a leadoff solo home 
run by Lawrence. The next 
run came in the third inning, 

as sophomore left fielder Kelly 
Christner hit an RBI single to 
score Ramirez from second. With 
two on and two down, junior 
right fielder Kelsey Susalla got 
all of a 2-0 pitch. Off the bat, it 
looked like a no-doubt home run, 
as fans stood up and cheered as 
the ball flew through the air. The 
ball went over the wall, but didn’t 
land there, as the wind blew it 
back in play, allowing the Indiana 
right fielder to catch it nearly a 
foot in front of the wall.

But Susalla got her payback 

against the wind in her next at-bat 
in the fifth inning. This time, she 
hit the ball a little harder in the 
same direction, landing in the 
right-field bleachers for a three-
run homer. The round-tripper 
gave Michigan a 5-1 lead, and 
its second hit with runners in 
scoring position for the game.

“I wasn’t too happy about (the 

near home run),” Susalla said. 
“After I hit the second one, I 
felt a lot better and a little more 
confident.”

With the bases loaded in the 

sixth inning for Romero, the 
wind was once again a factor. She 
hit what looked to be a fly out to 
right field for the second out, but 
the wind stopped the ball from 
traveling any further, as it fell 
into no-man’s land for a single. 
Two runs scored on the play, and 
Romero advanced to second. The 
Wolverines didn’t score again, 
winning 7-1 and finished 3-for-10 
with runners in scoring position.

Though sometimes the hitting 

wasn’t infectious for Michigan’s 
benefit, it hit well enough to 
earn all three wins. But if the 
contagiousness 
continues 

to strand from base hits, the 
Wolverines may reach their full 
potential soon enough.

“Honestly, 
we’re 
very 

contagious,” Hutchins said. “If 
one (batter) hits pop-ups, we all 
hit pop-ups. If one (batter) hits 
home runs, we all hit home runs. 
We’re very infectious, and we 
need somebody to break out.”
