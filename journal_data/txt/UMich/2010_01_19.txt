It was a subtle difference from
games past.
Week in and week out,
Michigan men's basketball coach
John Beilein
and his play-
ers would toss
around cliches
like "It's a
tough stretch
coming up"
or "We've got
a young team NICOLE
that needs AUERBACH
experience."
After Sun-
day's unexpected, exhilarating
68-63 upset of No. 15 Connecticut,
that language finally changed.

Michigan's next three games
are against three of the Big Ten's
highest-ranked teams: Wisconsin,
Purdue and Michigan State -
with the first two coming on the
road. Star guard Manny Harris
didn't seem too worried, calling
the upcoming slate of games a
"great" stretch, while sophomore
Zack Novak spoke at length about
the on-court maturity he's seeing.
Novak chose words like "improve-
ment" and "growth" for a reason.
The Michigan basketball team
has finally learned how to play a
full 40-minute game - and now,
how to win one, too.
"Right now, I think we're play-
ing good basketball," Novak said.

"We're improving every game,
and I think people see that. We
still have room to improve, but
this is a huge win for us."
Novak is right, of course. There
are areas for improvement every-
where - from boosting their
3-point shooting percentage to
staying out of foul trouble. But
what's incredible to consider first
is how far the Wolverines have
already come.
Start with defense. Michigan's
win over Connecticut featured
some of the scrappiest, most
smothering defense it has played
all season. According to Harris,
that was the blueprint for suc-
cess heading into Sunday's game

against a taller and more physical
team.
"No matter how much shots
we miss, just match them on the
defensive end when we go down
there, box out, just play harder
than them," said Harris of the
team's strategy. "Get the 50-50
balls, and we got a good chance
of winning the game, and that's
what we did today."
And it seemed like each time
the Huskies got into a bit of a
rhythm, or had a huge defensive
stop, the momentum would shift
back to the Wolverines - be it by
a Zack Gibson block, a Novak steal
or a Stu Douglass 3-pointer.

EXECUTIV COM PENATION
Coleman ranks sixth
in pay among public
university presidents

MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. DAY 2010
Ifill talks raising expectations

'U' president slid in
salary rankings for
second year in a row
By KYLE SWANSON
DailyNewsEditor
University President Mary Sue
Coleman continued to fall in the
rankings of highest-paid public
university presidents, coming in
at the sixth highest-paid this year,
according to figures released yes-
terday by The Chronicle of High-
er Education.
Coleman, who was the highest
paid president of a United States
public university when she took
her post as president in 2002,
has- slipped in the rankings for
the second consecutive year. Last
year, Coleman ranked as the fifth
highest-paid public university
president and in 2007 she was
the fourth highest-paid executive
among public universities.
For the last fiscal year, Cole-
man's total compensation pack-
age from the University came out
at $783,850. The compensation
package includes $553,500 in
base salary, $100,000 retention
bonus, $75,000 in deferred com-
pensation, $24,500 in retirement
pay and $30,850 in supplemental
retirement pay.
In addition to her compensa-
tion, Coleman has an expense
account for business-related

operations and travel. She is also
provided with a car and is given
full use of the historical presi-
dent's house at 815 South Univer-
sity Avenue.
Coleman's salary is determined
by the University's Board of
Regents who vote on the matter
after an annual review process
led by the Personnel, Compensa-
tion and Governance Committee
of the Board of Regents.
In the 2009 fiscal year, Cole-
man received a 4-percent raise,
increasing her base salary by
about $21,000.
Though figures for the current
fiscal year won'tbe available until
next year, Coleman is expected to
fall in the rankings next year -
having requested that the Board
of Regents not give her a pay raise
for the 2010 fiscal year.
However, in an interview this
summer after Coleman requested
the pay freeze, Phil Hanlon, vice
provost for academic and budget-
ary affairs, told The Michigan
Daily that Coleman's overall com-
pensation may change.
Hanlon explained that though
Coleman requested a pay freeze,
contributions -to her retirement
account or bonus payments may
increase.
Ohio State University's presi-
dent, E. Gordon Gee, maintained
his place at the top of the list of
highest paid public university
presidents with a compensation

At keynote for MLK
symposium, Ifill
mixes humor with
tough words on race
By JAMES LEE
For the Daily
"The key is to be who you are,
wherever you are."
This was the message Gwen
Ifill, managing editor of PBS's
"Washington Week" and co-
anchor of the "The NewsHour,"
told the standing room-only
crowd at Hill Auditorium yester-
day. Ifill delivered the keynote
speech for the University's 24th
annual symposium honoring Dr.

As Ifill approached the podium,
most of the audience rose to its

Ifill's humor permeated a lec-
ture focused on the importance of
raising expectations for children,

especially for youth in minority
communities. She described her-
self as fortunate to have lived in
a household with high expecta-

herself and the belief in the posi-

RALLYING FOR A CAUSE

A great communicator

Communication Studies
Prof. Susan Douglas not only
studies the mass media; she's
a part of it.
After her 1994 hook,
"Where the Girls Are: Grow-
ing Up Female with the Mass
Media," became a hit, Doug-
las found herself as a guest on
"The Oprah Winfrey Show."
"You're met at the airport
in Chicago by this giant limo,
and swept off to a hotel where
you have a big fancy room,"
she said of her appearance on
the show.
After the show, Douglas
even got to go shopping with
famous television personal-
ity Barbara Billingsley, who
played June Cleaver on the
sitcom, "Leave it to Beaver."
"I went shopping with
June Cleaver, which was a

total hoot!" she said.
Douglas - an expert in the
portrayal of gender roles in
the media - started teaching
in the University's Depart-
ment of Communication
Studies in 1996, but she didn't
always want to be a profes-
Douglas said when she was
a teenager she never believed
a woman could teach at a level
above high school.
"The women's movement
opened up so many doors for
my generation," she said.
Douglas said she first
became interested in the
mass media during her time
in graduate school at Brown
University, though she said
she "hardly watched televi-
sion at all" during her under-
graduate years.

But with a less social envi-
ronment in graduate school,
Douglas found herself sitting
around the T.V. more often
and was inspired to study
what she saw.
"For me it was like picking
up a rock," she said.
Douglas studies many
aspects of the mass media,
ranging from the history of
broadcasting to her current
topic of interest, celebrity cul-
cure. She said though many
think celebrity culture isn't a
serious topic, there is much to
be gleaned from studying it.
"Celebrity journalism is
filled with morality tails...of
how we're supposed to live
our lives, gender roles, suc-
cess, happiness, etc.," she
said.

MANLIUS TOWNSHIP, Mich.
Plane crash kills
students in Mich.
Hope College says a student
from Kenya was piloting a small
plane when it crashed in southwest
Michigan, killing himself and a
student from Illinois.

Canadian terror
plot ringleader
gets life sentence
A Canadian judge on yester-
day sentenced the ringleader of a
homegrown terrorist plot to set off
truck bombs in Ontario to life in
prison.
Zakaria Amara, 24, pleaded
guilty in October. He acknowl-
edged being a leader of the so-
called Toronto 18 plot to set off
bombs outside Toronto's Stock
Exchange, a building housing
Canada's spy agency and a military
base. The goal was to scare Cana-
da into removing its troops from
Afghanistan.
The 2006 arrests of Amara
and 17 others made international
headlines and heightened fears
in a country where many peo-
ple thought they were relatively
immune from terrorist strikes.

CNN'S Ted Turner
to protect bison
With 88 bison from Yellow-
stone National Park facing possible

has swept in and offered to hold
the animals for five years on his
sprawling Montana ranch while a
new home for them is found.
But Turner, ever the shrewd busi-
nessman, won't do it for nothing.
The media mogul says he will care
for the bison only if he can keep up
to 90 percent of their offspring.
And in the Rocky Mountain
West - where wildlife is cher-
ished both for its aesthetic value
and as meat on the table - the plan
is stoking a sharp debate over the
role of deep-pocketed private enti-

Hunters, environmentalists
and property law experts have all
weighed in and most say Turner's
plan sets a dangerous precedent
for the commercialization of public
wildlife. Others describe Turner as
a responsible steward of the land
with the resources needed to take
care of animals that desperately
need a home.

Church St. party
ends in violence

C ARE JUSiT/TIhe Miami Herald/ AP

doctors and aid workers poured into Haitin on Monday to deploy aid to the residents of the ravaged country.
Despite foreign efforts,
hunger persists in1 Haiti

Men allegedly
attacked partygoers
with shovels at
party's entrance
By DEVON THORSBY
Daily StaffReporter
A house party on the 1100 block
of Church Street Sunday night
turned violent as a group of young
men attempting to enter began
throwing punches and hitting
people with a shovel - resulting in
the hospitalization of two victims.
Ann Arbor Police confirmed
that a confrontation concerning
entrance into the party at 1105
Church Street escalated into a
bloody fight, and an investigation
is currently underway.
Witnesses said that at around 1
a.m. Monday morning, the party
hosted by the Pi Lambda Phi
Fraternity was at its maximum
capacity and sober monitors were
keeping people from entering the
house.
Engineering sophomore Sean
Grant was one of the many people
on the front porch at the time,
waiting to enter the party.
Grant said a group of four or five
young males was waiting in line as
well, and that they had been trying
to get into the party throughout
the night.
"They were just waiting out-
side," Grant said. "They weren't
even saying much. Then, they just
started throwing punches."
Grant said there was a sudden
burst of violence, as the group of
young men began punching others
on the porch.
But the violence was one-sided,
according to Grant.
"No one really understood what
the fight was about," Grant said.
"If the Pi-Lamb guys threw any
punches, it was in self-defense.
They were trying to stop the
fight."
Grant said one member of the

group of men who had been stand-
ing in line came onto the porch
with a shovel and began swing-
ing at both sober monitors and the
front door of the house.
AAPD Sgt. Craig Flocken said
that a curved metal digging shovel
was used by one of the assailants,
causing the most damage to both
victims and the front door.
Grant said that after a few
moments of violence, the group
stopped and ran off.
"After they did their damage,
they took off," Grant said. "They
ran so fast."
Business sophomore Andrew
Rubin said he was inside the house
at the time the confrontation
began.
Rubin said he stepped outside
when he heard yelling at the front
of the house. When he went to see
what was happening, Rubin said he
saw punches being thrown and a
man hitting people with a shovel.
"They meant for people to get
hurt," Rubin said. "It looked pretty
brutal."
Flocken confirmed that multiple
people sustained injuries from the
fight, and two went to the Univer-
sity Hospital to receive medical
attention.
A member of the Pi Lambda Phi
Fraternity, who wished to remain
anonymous, said he was inside the
house when he saw the fight break
out. When he went outside to try
to stop the violence, he said he was
hit a couple of times with others'
fists and once in the head with the
shovel.
The member of Pi Lambda Phi
said he and one other victim went
to the hospital to receive medical
attention for their wounds. He
received three staples in his head
and has a broken nose. He said the
other victim had 12 stitches above
his eyebrow for a wound from the
shovel as well.
Flocken said two persons of
interest were arrested concern-
ing the incident but were released
later that night pending further
investigation.

Relief workers
struggle to reach
victims in capital
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP)
- Troops, doctors and aid work-
ers flowed into Haiti yesterday
and officials said billions of dol-
lars more will be needed fol-
lowing the quake that killed an
estimated 200,000 people and
left many still struggling to find a
cup of water or a handful of food.
European nations pledged
more than a half-billion dollars
in emergency and long-term
aid, on top of at least $100 mil-
lion promised earlier by the U.S.
The president of the neighboring
Dominican Republic said it will
cost far more to finally rebuild
the country: $10 billion.
Help was still not reaching
many victims of last Tuesday's
quake - choked back by trans-
portation bottlenecks, bureau-
cratic confusion, fear of attacks
on aid convoys, the collapse of
local authority and the sheer
scale of the need.
Looting spread to more parts
of downtown Port-au-Prince as
hundreds of young men and boys
clambered, up broken walls to
break into shops and take what-
ever they can find. Especially
prized was toothpaste, which
people smear under their noses
to fend off the stench of decay-
ing bodies.
At a collapsed and burning
shop in the market area, youths
used broken bottles, machetes

and razors to battle for bottles
of rum and police fired shots to
break up the crowd.
"I am drinking as much as I
can. It gives courage," said Jean-
Pierre Junior, wielding a broken
wooden plank with nails to pro-
tect his bottle of rum.
Even so, the U.S. Army's on-
the-ground commander, Lt.
Gen. Ken Keen, said the city is
seeing less violence than before
the earthquake. "Is there gang
violence? Yes. Was there gang
violence before the earthquake?
Absolutely."
U.S. officials say some 2,200
Marines were arriving to join
1,700 U.S. troops now on the
ground and U.N. Secretary-Gen-
eral Ban Ki-moon announced
yesterday he wants 1,500 more
U.N. police and 2,000 more
troops to join the existing 7,000
military peacekeepers and 2,100
international police in Haiti.
While aid workers tried to
make their way into Haiti, many
people tried to leave. Hundreds
of U.S. citizens, or people claim-
ing to be, waved IDs as they
formed a long line outside the
U.S. Embassy in hopes of arrang-
ing a flight out of the country.
Dominican President Leonel
Fernandez, hosting an interna-
tional meeting to plan strategy
for Haiti, said it would cost $10
billion over five years to recon-
struct the country and confront
the immediate emergency.
Roughly 200,000 people may
have been killed in the magni-
tude-7.0 quake, the European
Union said, quoting Haitian offi-

cials who also said about 70,000
bodies have been recovered so far.
EU officials estimated that
about 250,000 were injured and
1.5 million were homeless.
Even many people whose
houses survived are sleeping
outside for aftershocks will col-
lapse unstable buildings. And
while the U.N. said that more
than 73,000 people have received
a week's rations, many more still
wait.
So many people have lost
homes that the World Food Pro-
gram is planning a tent camp for
100,000 people - an instant city
the size of Burbank, California
- on the outskirts of Port-au-
Prince, according to the agency's
country director, Myrta Kaulard.
About 50,000 people already
sleep each night on the city golf
course where the U.S. 82nd Air-
borne Division has set up an aid
camp.
In town, Bodies still lay in the
street six days after the quake,
but Haitians had made progress
in hauling many away for burial
or burning. People were seen
dragging corpses to intersections
in hopes that garbage trucks or
aid groups would arrive to take
them away.
Six days after the quake,
dozens of rescue crews were
still working to rescue victims
trapped under piles of concrete
and debris.
"There are still people liv-
ing" in collapsed buildings, U.N.
humanitarian spokeswoman
Elisabeth Byrs told The Associ-
ated Press. "Hope continues."

Mass. Senate candidates battle to
the end in surprisingly close race

If Republican wins,
Democrats would
lose filibuster proof
majority in Senate
BOSTON (AP) - Nearly one
year to the day after President
Barack Obama was sworn into
office as an agent of change, Mas-
sachusetts Senate candidates
battled to the wire Monday in an
election that threatened his agen-
da and reflected voters' frustra-
tion with the status quo.
Democrat Martha Coakley and
Republican Scott Brown scoured
the state for votes on the eve of
the special election to succeed the
late Edward M. Kennedy, with
the Democrats' 60-vote Senate
supermajority at stake.
From a distance, the president
made one last appeal in a TV ad for
Coakley, his words reflecting how
much was on the line for Demo-
crats in the face of a surprisingly
strong challenge by Republican
Scott Brown in a state that hasn't
elected a Republican senator since
1972.
"Every vote matters, every
voice matters," Obama said in the
ad that showed him campaigning
with Coakley a day earlier. "We
need you on Tuesday."
Obama needs Coakley, the
state's attorney general, to win
to deny Republicans the ability to

block his initiatives - specifically
the near-complete health care
plan- with a filibuster-sustaining
41st Republican vote. A Coakley
loss also would be an embarrass-
ment, particularly because Obama
has put so much political capital
on the line.
A Suffolk University survey
taken Saturday and Sunday shows
Brown with double-digit leads in
three communities the poll iden-
tified as bellwethers: Gardner,
Fitchburg and Peabody. But inter-
nal statewide polls for both sides
show a dead-heat.
Backers of Coakley and Brown
worked feverishly to identify their
supporters and persuade undecid-
ed voters to move their way. Each
side deployed armies of volunteers
to man phone banks and trudge
door to door through ice and snow
to encourage people to vote.
A third candidate in the race,
Joseph L. Kennedy, a Libertarian
running as an independent, said
Monday he's been bombarded
with e-mails from Brown support-
ers urging him to drop out and
endorse the Republican. But Ken-
nedy, who is polling in the single
digits and is no relation to the late
senator, said he's staying in.
Special elections tend to draw
relatively few voters, but Repub-
licans and Democrats predicted a
high turnout Tuesday. The Massa-
chusetts electorate, like the coun-
try at large, is dissatisfied with
the country's direction, and those

disgruntled voters are expected
to vote their passions in droves.
Democrats, who until just a
week ago considered the race
a lock for Coakley, have been
forced to scramble for votes in a
state where Democrats outnum-
ber Republicans 3-1. Brown has
thrown Democrats for a loop,
riding a wave of voter anger
with Obama's health care plan
and what critics call big govern-
ment spending to pull the race
even.
The concern among Democrats
was clear when they trotted out
Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry
to accuse Brown backers of dirty
tricks.
Trying desperately to slow
Brown's momentum, Coakley
and fellow Democrats rolled out
a fresh round of automated calls
to voters from Vice President Joe
Biden and from Vicki Kennedy,
the late senator's widow. They
were targeting voters who pro-
pelled Obama to victory in 2008.
Get-out-the-vote programs were
in full swing on campuses across
the state, and ads courted the
state's large Portuguese and Hai-
tian communities.
Obama's TV appeal mostly was
intended to encourage the Demo-
cratic base to vote. Democrats
need their base to turn out big,
given that surveys showed Brown
leading among independents and
Republicans incredibly energized
about his candidacy.

Aiding Haiti
Students should help earthquake relief efforts
After the devastating earthquake in Haiti, citizens through-
out the world have pledged significant support to the vic-
tims. The Haitian government - and many of the buildings
that housed the nation's highest political offices - is now in ruins.
Amid that void, the United States and other nations and relief orga-
nizations have stepped in to offer aid. As groups like the World Food
Program announce campaigns to send relief to Haiti and appeal for
public donations, it's clear that other bodies have a moral imperative
to contribute to the cause. Numerous University organizations have
already begun to arrange efforts to assist Haiti. Now, students need
to offer their help however they can.

We will have legislation that
removes all doubt that health care is
a right not a privilege."
- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), addressing the possibility that a Democratic loss in the Massachu-
setts Senate race could derail the health care reform bill, as reported yesterday by The New York Times.
The amazing, underrated race

The three million victims of the 7.0-mag-
nitude earthquake on Jan. 12 experienced
destruction of immense proportions. The
nation lost the structures that housed the
UN and Haitian government; including the
Presidential Palace. The Port-Au-Prince
Cathedral, the main jail, educational facili-
ties and most area hospitals were all com-
pletely destroyed or seriously damaged
in the quake. The Haitian Interior Min-
ister projects that death toll. has reached
200,000.
The United States has already sent con-
siderable aid. President Barack Obama has
pledged $100 million in federal funds. The
United States has begun issuing humani-
tarian visas to orphaned Haitian children.
The number of U.S. troops dispatched
to the area is expected to soon increase
to about 10,000 to aid the efforts. This
response is encouraging, but the U.S. must
continue to work closely with Haiti and
other nations and independent organiza-
tions to create a global network of support.
Many student groups here at the Univer-
sity have used their roles in the social ser-
vice arena to encourage support for Haiti.
Myron Bishop, advisor to the Multicultural
Greek Council and National Pan-Hellenic
Council, has said that the two organiza-
tions are combining efforts to create the

most effective plan for aid. On Jan. 15, the
University Health System announced the
mobilization of a multi-faceted response
- including sending packages of medical
supplies, an ambulance jet with a full med-
ical and flight crew and arranging to send
volunteers from its medical staff to care for
victims in Haiti.
The overall University response has
been inspiring and should be continued.
While the devastation that has occurred
in Haiti may seem far away to those in a
secure college bubble, this travesty must
serve as a reminder that, as Obama wrote
in this week's edition of Newsweek, "life
can be unimaginably cruel." Students
should take every available opportunity to
support these relief efforts. Students have
a multitude of organizations to choose to
help, from the Red Cross to the Greek sys-
tem, and should contribute whatever they
can to help Haiti at this pivotal moment.
The United States government and other
nations should work with Haiti to help those
affected by the earthquake. But the relief
effort needs everyone's support. Students
also have a responsibility to the glohgd com-
munity and the earthquake's victims to join
in offering aid. And with numerous options
to donate available, there's no excuse for
ignoring this pressing need.

Everybody wants to talk about
national politics. It's a fact of
life. And it's especially true on
a campus of politi-
cally-inclined col-
lege students, many
of whom actively
worked to elect the =
current group in
Washington.
The questions on
everyone's minds
are big ones. Will
Congress pass a ROBERT
health care reform SOBE
bill that exempts SOAVE
certain states and
Democratic con-
stituents from paying for it? Will the
U.S. Treasury bail out more banks?
(And then, paradoxically, tax them
without any regard for what each
bank has already paid back, as Obama
suggested last week?)
I will admit to being just as con-
cerned as you, Daily readers, about the
fate of the country. But a passion for
national political developments doesn't
translate into an ability to shape them.
Unless you live in Massachusetts and
will be voting in the special election
today to fill the late Democratic Sen.
Ted Kennedy's seat, you probably
won't have much of an effect onnation-
al health care legislation.
But there are important political
developments happening right here in
Michigan, too. And unlike the nation
as a whole, the state's issues are ones
that Michigan residents have consid-
erably more power to resolve. Case
in point: the 2010 gubernatorial elec-
tion, which is shaping up to be the
most wide-open contest in Michigan
politics in decades. So in addition
to complaining about Sarah Palin,
Ben Nelson and NBC's executives, I
encourage students to become aggres-
sively involved in the governor's race.
In case you haven't been paying
attention, here's a recap.
Gov. Jennifer Granholm is legally

barred from running for re-election
again. This is a fortunate turn of
events, as this once rising star in the
Democratic Party has overseen a com-
plete collapse of both the state econo-
my and her public approval rating over
the last few years.
Until this month, the presumptive
Democratic front-runner was Lieu-
tenant Gov. John Cherry. But on Jan.
5, he announced that he wouldn't be
a candidate, citing inadequate fund-
raising. I'm not too disappointed that
he's out, although I'm bummed that
I'll never get to use the great smear
campaign sloganI came up with all by
myself: "Higher taxes with a Cherry
on top" (brilliant, I know).
Cherry's exit raises questions. Will
House Speaker Andy Dillon enter
the race? He's got name recognition,
but his capitulation to Republican
demands not to raise taxes frus-
trated many liberals, while his talk
of reforming public employee health
care benefits won't win him many
labor endorsements. In other words,
he'll face a tough Democratic primary
but could run on an increasingly cen-
trist record in the general election,
which might be just what the Demo-
crats need to win this year.
Among the other possible names is
one of the University's own - Regent
Denise Ilitch (D-Bingham Farms).
She gets points in my book for voting
against the tuition increase in June,
one of the only non-unanimous Board
of Regents budget votes in the last few
years. On the other hand, her policy
positions are a mystery and, according
to contribution databases Money.com
and OpenSecrets, she's given a lot of
money to Republicans over the years,
which isn't exactly the popular thing
to do if you're a Democrat.
The Republican side has been more
heated, with a sort of three-sided bat-
tle going on between Attorney Gen-
eral Mike Cox, U.S. Congressman Pete
Hoekstra (R-Holland) and Oakland
County Sherriff Mike Bouchard. While

the end result can't be guaranteed, the
scale is tipping in favor of Cox, who has
raised an impressive $1.8 million.
The governor's
election is already
heating up.
Cox has some good ideas for the
state, like cutting the economically
crippling Michigan Business Tax in
half. But he has some baggage, too -
it's been alleged that he mishandled
the investigation into former Detroit
Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick's wild party
in the fall of 2002. But Hoekstra has
posted some controversial Twitter
updates and Bouchard performed
worse than expected in his 2008
campaign against U.S. Sen. Debbie
Stabenow (D-Mich.), so they've all
got issues.
Am I openly rooting for the Repub-
licans? You bet. I often despise their
party, but eight years of Democratic
rule hasn't reversed, stopped or even
slowed the state's economic decline.
The Michigan business climate was
ranked 49th among states by Forbes.
com last year, and that's not going to
improve unless business taxes are
reduced. It seems like a Republican -
Cox, perhaps - may be the- only one
willing to do that.
Feel free to disagree with my
assessment, but please care about
this election in some way or another.
We may worry about airport security,
hate on Wall Street and take sides in
Jay Leno vs. Conan O'Brien (I'm with
Coco), but when it comes to Michigan,
there's more at stake forus - and more
control in our hands.

The perils of gene patenting

Support for the smoking ban

If you wanted to patent your sister, you would
be disappointed. She, like most other humans,
is a product of nature and is therefore outside
the realm of patentability. Yet, 20 percent of
all human genes have been patented - a sig-
nificant portion of your sister. The expectation
that inventions should be novel apparently not-
withstanding, for two decades the United States
Patent and Trademark Office has issued patents
for portions of our genetic makeup to genetics
corporations and laboratories. And the theft of
our own genes is frustrating the research at uni-
versities and slowing the progress of medicine.
No part of the human genome belongs to
any one person or organization. Pending in the
federal court system is a lawsuit filed by the
American Civil Liberties Union and the Public
Patent Foundation arguing just that. The sci-
entific community is watching closely because,
should the case ultimately be ruled in favor of
the ACLU, gene patents spanning two decades
could be invalidated and the human genome
would once again belong to humanity.
Patents are important in many fields for
encouraging research and development. They
give patent holders control over their inven-
tions for 20 years in exchange for full public
disclosure of the invention's details. The for-
mer aspect provides an incentive while public
disclosure places others in a position to develop
and patent a better invention.
Gene patents are the same. Gene patent
holders make money by selling genetic screen-
ing tests for the genes they have patented. A
patient who wishes to be checked for disease-
causing mutations associated with Long QT
syndrome (which can cause sudden death), for
example, can only buy that test from the com-
pany, which has patented the genes on which
those mutations occur.
But there's a flaw in the idea of patenting the
genes themselves. With genes, there's no way
to improve the patented item - at least not for
the purposes of medical diagnosis. The premise
of genetic screening is to look at the genes as
they are and use that information to determine
a person's susceptibility to a certain disease.
For diagnostic purposes, the development of
"Genome 2.0" doesn't make much sense, and so

the patents don't, either.
More frustratingly, not only do gene pat-
ents fail to encourage research, but when pat-
ent rights are abused, they actually stifle it.
Enter Myriad Genetics, the company that holds
the patents for the famous BRCAI and BRCA2
genes - mutations on which are strongly asso-
ciated with a susceptibility to breast and ovar-
ian cancers. Since it received its patents in the
1990s, Myriad has used the power of the patent
to refuse other laboratories permission to fur-
ther research or test the genes and charges more
than $3,000 for every antiquated cancer screen-
ing test it provides.
Myriad has a monopoly over testing and
research on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. If a
woman can't afford Myriad's test for the muta-
tions associated with cancer or would like a
second opinion from a different genetics com-
pany before, say, having a hysterectomy, she is
out of luck. For her to remove her own genes
and look at the sequence would be a violation of
patent law. Scientists who oppose gene patents
have thus argued that what Myriad and other
companies have is a patent on knowledge, not a
novel invention.
Supporters of gene patents argue that tem-
porary monopolies imposed by patents are nec-
essary to reward those companies which have
made considerable investments in research
and development. But Lee Silver, professor of
molecular biology and public policy at Princeton
University, says likely "95 percent of patents on
genes are worthless in an economic sense," as
reported by CNN.com in May. Obscure diseas-
es, unlike breast cancer, simply lack the testing
numbers sufficient to turn a profit from a gene
patent. Clearly gene patents fail to do their job
of encouraging research and improving health.
In theory, the legal argument against gene
patenting is strong. Maybe 2010 will be the year
gene patenting is finally ended by the federal
judiciary. But if it isn't, it will be up to us to make
the moral argument good enough for Congress.
Sadly, the real reason you can't patent your
sister isn't so much legal precedent. It's that
someone already has.

W hy do you smell like
smoke?," asked my room-
mate, Sam Shreeman, as I
entered our room
at 1 a.m. one Octo-
ber Saturday night.
"I was at the pub
studying for my
economics mid-
term," I sighed.
By now, he found
nothing strange
about my response.
I can't study ALEX
in libraries (too
quiet), my dorm SCHIFF
(too many distrac-_
tions) or places
like Panera (I take
too many interruptions to refill my
73rd glass of Diet Pepsi.) Roughly
three weeks into my first semester
at the University, I found my oasis
of productivity: The Blue Lepre-
chaun. It has all the things I need to
study - good food, servers that bring
your 73rd free refill to the table, free
Wi-Fi and enough noise to block out
my brain saying, "Check Facebook!
Watch Family Guy! Do you need to do
laundry? Check Facebook! Who won
the football game last night? Check
your e-mail! Am I missing South
Park? Check Facebook!"
There's just one problem - I come
home smelling like a used ash tray. So
you can imagine my joy when I learned
that Michigan had passed a ban on
smoking inside all bars and restau-
rants. Not only will I no longer risk
lung cancer while studying, non-smok-
ing customers and employees won't
be forced to inhale the poison being
shoved down their throats by smokers.
I have many good reasons to agree
with the ban. But instead of telling
you what I think, I decided to put on
my reporter hat and devote this col-
umn to the thoughts of those most
affected by the ban - bar owners and
employees.
On one of my many visits to The
Blue Leprechaun, I spoke with Gen-
eral Manager Scott Meinke. "It's a
good thing for the people that work
in the service industry," he said. "As
everyone knows, secondhand smoke
is a threat to people's health. It'll be
good for the health of our staff for
them not to be subjected to second-
hand smoke."
He doesn't seem too mad about
the ban. But business might decline.
Won't the ban keep smokers - and
their money - at home?
"Personally, I don't think it will

affect business," Meinke noted. He
added that while it may discourage
some smokers from dining out, new
customers that previously wouldn't
eat in a smoking environment would
balance this loss. The ban now gives
The Blue Leprechaun a chance to bet-
ter protect the health of its employees
without risking losing customers to
other bars.
So, does anyone think that the ban
will actually hurt business?
David Root, a manager at The
Brown Jug, said, "As long as every-
one has to go non-smoking, it doesn't
bother me." While he disagreed with
the fundamental concept behind the
ban, his concern was the injustice
that casino floors, where non-smok-
ing patrons are just as vulnerable to
secondhand smoke, would receive an
exemption. He said he was not wor-
ried about the effect of the ban on
The Brown Jug's bottom line.
Non-smoking establishments don't
seem very angry either. "I think that
it was long overdue," Good Time
Charley's owner Adam Lowenstein
told me in an interview. "When we
re-opened Charley's, we re-opened
it as a non-smoking bar, and I think
every bar should be like that." When
I asked what provoked this decision,
he responded that, "It's about having
a good working environment. If I'm
going to be having managers working
full-time, I can't be subjecting them
to secondhand smoke all day." More-
over, just like every other owner or
manager I talked to, he believes that
the ban's effect on business will be
minimal, if anything.
On the subject of the rights of pri-
vate establishments to conduct them-
selves as they see fit, Lowenstein
added, "It's not unfair. The govern-
ment has the right to regulate busi-
nesses whether you agree with what
they're doing or not. They do it in a
million ways every day."
Ben Hammond, daytime manager
of Good Time Charley's, commented,
"I can understand that it's a private
property and a private establishment,
but it is the public that frequents the
establishment, so you have to go by
what's best for the public."
But the main goal of the legislation
is to protect the health of employees
who are forced to inhale the smoke,
so I asked them what they thought
about the upcoming ban, which goes
into effect May 1, 2010.
Katie MacDonald, employee of The
Blue Leprechaun, noted that even
though she smokes casually when she

goes out, she still thinks it's a great
idea. "Even people that do smoke find
the atmosphere really disgusting on
nights when it gets really bad." She
even described being burned on sev-
eral occasions while working when
inconsiderate smokers had tapped
the ashes off their cigarettes as she
was passing by.
Even employees
who smoke favor
the new law.
Good Time Charley's employee
Kristin Singleton enthusiastically
told me, "I like the fact that it's going
to happen. I'm a smoker but don't like 4
leaving a place smelling like an old
ash tray." That sounds familiar. In
the name of journalistic integrity, I
felt compelled to betray my own per-
sonal biases and play devil's advocate.
So I raised the common criticism that
employees choose to work in a smok-
ing environment when they apply for 4
the job and should work elsewhere if
they don't like it.
In response, Singleton lamented
that her sister Ashley, who suffers
from asthma, works at another bar
outside of Ann Arbor and some-
times has asthma attacks on the job
because of the smoke. She has been
told multiple times by her doctor that
she should find another job but has
nowhere else to go. Maybe it's just
me, but I don't notice many "Hir-
ing Now" signs hanging in windows
around America.
And that's not just an isolated
instance. Tatiana Klein, another Blue
Leprechaun employee, also suffers
from asthma and complained that
the "smoky atmosphere can really
exacerbate it." Should smokers ,tell
Klein and Ashley Singleton to find
other jobs because of their medical 4
condition? Does a smoker's nicotine
craving trump the health of the cus-
tomers and employees around them?
I'll let Meinke answer that: "A pre-
existing condition shouldn't deter
anyone from doing anything they
enjoy, especially as far as employ-
ment goes." Couldn't have said it bet- 4
ter myself.

Did the aughts suck?

Guns and stilettos

Historiography is essen-

maybe that's a little bit harsh, but
it's a statement
many modern
historiogra-
phers would
more or less
agree with.
Because, when
it comes down
to it, any his- JOSHUA

is basically one
party's subjective attempt to
systematize all the haphazard
sociocultural tidbits that go along
with a certain place and time. In
a sense, historiography is kind of
like staring at a random cluster of
clouds and deciding that it looks
somewhat like a bunny rabbit.
Fun? Clearly. Comprehensive? Not
in the least.
Nonetheless, I shall boldly
attempt to historicize the past
four decades of pop music in one
fell swoop: the '60s was the revo-
lutionary glory days of pop going
experimental, the '70s was the
'60s not wanting to end, the '80s
was everyone burning out and the
'90s was everyone embracing their
burnout status while dispassion-
ately smoking a cigarette.
So what about the '00s? One
could compellingly argue it was
the apocalypse. But one could
just as easily make a case that the
aughts have been the most excit-
ing decade in music since ... well,
ever. Really. It just all depends on
how much you dig the Internet.
The musical innovations of
the past decade were far more
about changing the way we listen
to music rather than drastically
changing the music we listen to.
While studio wizardry certainly
became increasingly ear-boggling
as the decade progressed, no true
ground was broken in the realm of
instrumentation. I mean, come on
- 30 years ago, we were already
bored enough to invent the keytar.
But, as the Internet gradually
replaced MTV as the primary life-
line of our country's youth, music
as an art form became vastly

democratized. Do-it-yourself pro- division between popular music

Monstrous angels
and naked witches
are great dumb fun
By NICK YRIBAR
For the Daily
Here's one you've heard before:
Video games are art. Not every-

ment, but unless

The huge strides
made by video
games in the past 10 or 15 years in
terms of graphics and complexity
are unquestionable.
But beyond that, there are new

is great for games and really great
for gamers. What's so striking
about Platinum Games's new title
"Bayonetta" is how it acknowledg-
es these changes, paying homage to
them and then flinging them into
an exploding toilet, flushing them
away with the heel of a stiletto

Bayonetta is a witch, though
what we generally associate with

"witches" is almost totally absent
from the game. Our protagonist
wields four guns - two in her
hands and two serving as high
heels for her boots (which some-
how remain functional) - and
there's not a broom to be found.
She's in the business of killing
angels, and business is a-boomin'.

A 'Mountain of stereotypes

By ANT MITCHELL
Daily Arts Writer
Champions don't come from
their mothers' wombs; they come
from their
fathers' balls.
Or so Spike TV's
new show "Blue Blue
Mountain State" Mountain
tells us. And
that's one of the State
finest examples of Tuesdays
womb envy evera
created. atlO p.m.
If ever there Spike
was a show that
could be categorized as "man
TV," this is it: Two girls blowing
a banana at the same time, Vagisil
lip balm, sex, football, more sex
and booze all figure prominently
in the premiere episode. The show
begins with the start of football
season at Blue Mountain State - a
fictional university chock full of
college-related stereotypes - and
the arrival of backup quarterback
Alex (Darin Brooks, "Days of Our
Lives"). Ready to begin his col-
lege experience, Alex strives to
enjoy all the pleasures of being
a quarterback with none of the
pressures. This means lots of
"scoring," drinking and occasion-
ally peeing on a hot cougar (who

likes it, apparently).
His roommate Sammy (Chris
Romano, "South Park") dreams of
becoming a team mascot to meet
cheerleaders and videotapes the
previous mascot masturbating (in
full costume) against the trophy
case to oust him. Classy.
Another focus in the premiere
episode is the new running back
Craig, (Sam Jones, "Smallville")
whose opportunistic girlfriend
(Gabrielle Dennis, "The Game") -
spoiler alert - turns down his sex-
ual advances because she secretly is
a lesbian.
Uptight and nervous, Craig is
like Burton Guster (Dule Hill)

from "Psych," while Alex mirrors
Shawn Spencer (James Roday). The
reserved sidekick role always seems
to go to the black guy in these tag
teams, and it's becoming tiresome.
Similarly, Alex's hazing nemesis
Thad (Alan Ritchson, "Smallville")
has a short, black sidekick who
stands close by as he sucks pills off
of scantily clad girls' tongues after
snorting coke off their bodies. Two
stereotypical pairs are two too
many.
The absolute ridiculousness of
each and every scene makes for
a viewing experience that, while
not particularly varied, is at least

Dark humor dominates 'The Maid'

By EMILY BOUDREAU
Daily Arts Writer
"The Maid" centers on the life of
Raquel (Catalina Saavedra, "Mami
Te Amo"), a
maid who spent
20 years of her
life working for
a wealthy fam-
ily in Chile before At the
entering a bizarre Michigan
midlife crisis. Forastero
Because of her
age, she's worried
about losing her position with the
people she has come to think of as
her family. Raquel suffers horrible
migraines and has difficulty even
lugging the vacuum cleaner up the
stairs, but she will stop at nothing to
thwartthefamily'sefforts to gether
an assistant maid who could later
replace her.
Raquel's efforts to maintain her
position are rife with dark humor.
Half the time, it's hard to be sure
she's really serious. She disposes
of the family cat and tries to frame
the other maids. She locks people
out of the house and pretends not
to hear them yelling for her. At one
point, the tension between Raquel
and a cranky elderly maid erupts
into a violent fistfight. The humor
seems almost too much at times

- "The Maid" could very easily
transform into a horror film about
a maid who goes insane.
A combination of the ridicu-
lous and the mundane keeps "The
Maid" going. Saavedra is an expert
at keeping people guessing. Her
face is blank and she rarely smiles,
making it hard to know what
exactly is going on in her head or
what she plans on doing next. The
drab appearance of her character
makes a perfect foil for her outra-
geous actions as well as the turmoil
going on inside her head.
From the opening scene, it's
obvious Raquel doesn't belong in
the family for which she works.
She eats her meals separately
from them and sleeps in a sparse,
cell-like room in a large, beauti-
ful house. Raquel seems trapped
somehow. She has no life outside
her work. On her days off, she wan-
ders around, lookinglost and out of
place.
It would be easy to reduce direc-
tor Sebastian Silva's film to a com-
mentary on the cruelties of class
structure, but "The Maid" is about
more than that. The contrasts
between the luxuries Raquel's
employers enjoy and the dull

monotony of Raquel's life are mov-
ing, but it's the isolation that Silva
uncovers that's really striking.
From the father (Alejandro Goic,
"Los Secretos") who has an incom-
prehensible passion for building
miniature ships to the mother's
Director Silva
highlights the
isolation of
the classes.
(Claudia Celdon, "La Vida Me
Mata") oddly symbiotic relation-
ship with Raquel, each character
has something that separates them
from all the others in the film. It
is only through the eyes of Raquel
that the fragmented family con-
nections are constructed.
"The Maid" does get repetitive
and grim as Raquel disposes of one
maid after another. It's not until

Regents to consider Crisler
renovations at next meeting

Proposed changes
expected to cost
$20 million
By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
During its monthly meeting
Thursday, the University's Board
of Regents is expected to approve
renovations to Crisler Arena.
Built in1967, the13,800 seat arena
is where the Michigan men's and
women's basketball teams practice
and play their home games. Aside
from sporting events Crisler Arena
also frequently hosts concerts,
shows, and other academic events.
The proposed renovations are
slated to cost $20 million and call for
drastic changes to the aging venue.
The blue, lower bowl, seats of the
arena will be removed and replaced
in compliance with the Americans
with Disabilities Act. Aisles will be
widened and relocated, handrails
will be added and elevators will be
installed to ease accessibility to the
seating area.
A new roof will be added to the
arena and asbestos abatement will
occur on an as-needed basis. The
building will also receive updates
to its fire detection and suppression
systems, an emergency generator,
emergency egress lighting and other
electrical improvements.

Rest assured, that hasn't been
happening all season.
At the same time, the "young"
team grew up. Freshman guard
Darius Morris said after Thurs-
day's win over Indiana that the
college game was finally slowing
down for him. He and Douglass
have been getting more and more
comfortable leading this team
down the court. And the role play-
ers finally figured out, well, their
respective roles.
"We realized what we were
doing at the beginning of the sea-
son wasn't working," Douglass
said. "The third or fourth option,
sometimes you have to look at that
instead of forcing the first or sec-
ond option to Manny or (DeShawn
Sims). ... We were just playingoff
the offense instead of trying to
create our own."
We've seen this epiphany in
action, too. Instead of standing
around passively as Harris or Sims
struggled, the rest of the team
made that extra pass to find the
open shot. In Sunday's win over
Connecticut, five players scored at
least eight points for the first time

brought students to the University.
Dong wrote in an e-mail interview
that he believes bringing his students
to campus is a "concrete and critical
step to reverse the current disturbing
trend of failure for my students."
Urban Prep Academy is the first
all-boys charter school in the Unit-
ed States geared towards African-
American men. Dong wrote in the
e-mail interview that he doesn't
want his students to be among the
about half of African-American
men who drop out of high school.
"I will not allow my students to fall
into the trap of negative stereotypes
and low expectations," he wrote. "I
intend that all ofmy students will not
only graduate from high school, but
also will succeed in college."
Dong added that he hopes to
make this an annual trip.
"I would like to expose them to
a world-class research university
with a vivid academic atmosphere
and a vibrant student commu-
nity, something completely differ-
ent from their neighborhood," he
wrote.
Students were chosen for the trip

In a statement released by Ath-
letic Director Bill Martin yesterday,
Martin said the renovation will be
a major step forward for University
athletics.
"Renovating Crisler Arena is an
integral part of our basketball pro-
gram's future success, on and off
the court," Martin said. "We really
haven't done any infrastructure
work in the arena since its construc-
tion 40 plus years ago, and this will
be a major step forward in improv-
ing ourbasketball facilities."
The regents are also expected to
authorize the issuance and award-
ing of construction contracts for the
new $23.2 million basketball prac-
tice facility - of which the regents
approved the schematic design in
September. The 57,000 square-foot
addition to Crisler Arena will house
two new practice courts, new lock-
er rooms for the men's and women's
basketball teams, offices for staff
and coaches, an expanded strength
and conditioning area and a larger
athletic medicine area. Construc-
tion is expected to be completed in
fall 2011.
PROPOSAL TO NAME THE
WRESTLING FACILITY
Also on the regent's agenda is
a proposal to name the Michigan
Wrestling Center after former var-
sity wrestler Ralph Bahna and his
wife Dorothy - also a University
since the season-opening win over
Northern Michigan on Nov. 14.
More players have contributed
on offense and re-dedicated
themselves to defense, and it
makes sense that the team's over-
all focus has narrowed. In the
past two games, I've seen that
look in the players' eyes. They
have been hungry. They have
been focused. They are back in
"hunter" mode for the first time
since last season.
The final step of that growth
came in Sunday's final minutes,
when, instead of collapsing down
the stretch like they would have
earlier this season, the Wolverines
won the tug-of-war with a defiant
Connecticut squad.
When the Huskies tied and re-
tied the game with less than four
minutes remaining in the game,
the Wolverines didn't buckle as
they have in games past. They
withstood the late-game rush,
played smart on offense and tough
on defense. In short, they listened
to their coach, and they grew up in
a big moment.
"The bottom line is, get to the
point where in the last five-to-
ten minutes, we know how to
win," Beilein said Friday. "You're
going to win it with really smart
less than Coleman.
Though 2009 figures for pri-
vate university presidents have
not yet been released, the high-
est-paid private-university presi-
dent in 2008 was Shirley Ann
Jackson, who earned nearly $1.6
million for leading Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute.
In addition to her official
capacity at the University, Cole-
man also serves on the Board of
Directors for Johnson & Johnson
and Meredith Corporation.
Though compensation fig-
ures for her service to Johnson
& Johnson last year were not
immediately available yester-

day, Coleman received $202,631

students who applied, freshmen Ste-
ven May, Lawrence Mead and Dem
etreius Russell were accepted.
During their two-day trip to Ann
Arbor, the students visited the resi-
dence halls, ate in dining halls and
toured campus.
When asked what he - thought
of the University, Steven May said
there were two things that he found
very interesting.
"The two things I was surprised
at was the one club - the squirrel-
feeding club - and then, that you
actually walk across the street
whenever you would like," he said.
Lawrence Mead said the expe-
rience at the University was "eye-
opening" and veryunlike the violent
environment he lives in.
"The University of Michigan has
one ofthemostgenerousvibes I have
ever seen, I mean everything, from
squirrels all the way up," he said.
"You have people who are there for
you. You can literally find help any
time you need it. Whatever you want
or whatever you need help with, it's
like almost there for you. If you fail
college, it's reallyyour fault."
Russell said he could also see

est a former varsity athlete has ever
given to the University's Athletic
Department. Ralph Bahna won an
individual Big Ten wrestling cham-
pionship in 1964.
The new 18,000 square-foot
wrestling facility opened last fall
and features state-of-the-art ameni-
ties like locker rooms and lounges
for the coaches and student-athletes,
strength and conditioning areas, a
training room, and three practice
mats.
APPROVAL OF FULLER
ROAD STATION PLANS
Aside from University athletics,
the regents are also expected to
approve plans for the Fuller Road
Station. The Fuller Road project is
a joint venture between the Univer-
sity and the City of Ann Arbor. The
structure will include bus ports,
bike locks,lockers and a1,000-space
parking structure.
The facility will cost $46,550,000
and willbe sharedbetween the Uni-
versity and the city according to the
number of spaces allotted to each.
The University will have 78 percent
of the spaces in the new facility and
pay 78 percent, or $36,309,000, of
the cost. The structure is expected
to be completed by mid 2012.
offensive play and with just tough
defense and rebounding."
Sunday's victory over Connecti-
cut was more than just a signature
win. By beatingthe Huskies,
Michigan has shown it has the tal-
ent to compete with anyone and
the poise down the stretch to beat
them, too.
"It gives us a lot of confidence
and also lets us know we are just
as athletic as they are or even if
we're not, we can play stronger or
tougher than the next team," Har-
ris said.
That's why the Wisconsin-
Purdue-Michigan State stretch
doesn't seem so scary anymore,
even for a team that's been so
hard to figure out. The Wolverines
don't enter it as a disjointed group
of players; they come into it asa
team that's been through some
growing pains. But it's also a team
that's looking at a glass half-full.
(And who's to tell these guys they
can't dream about the NCAA
Tournament?)
"We've got opportunities,"
Novak said. "If we just keep get-
ting better and playing well, good
things will happen."

Approximately $95,000 of that
compensation was cash, while
nearly $100,000 was given
through stock options. The rest
of the compensation came in the
form of other compensation, like
gifts to charity.
Compensation figures for
Coleman's service to - Mere-
dith Corporation were also not
immediately available yesterday,
though in 2008 Coleman earned
$144,067 for her service. Of that

one day, adding that he plans to "go
to college and I will make it to the
University of Michigan."
"I'm loving this school," he said.
"I see that the area around the
school and the people they're very
nice. They're different from our
neighborhood."
Mead said the visit inspired him
to work towards his goal of attend-
ing college, despite failures in the
education system that could make it
difficult for him to do so. During an
interview, Mead expressed his feel-
ings towards the education system
by reciting a poem he wrote.
"The biggest (failure of educa-
tion) is when a youngman or woman
does not turn around and help that
young boy or girl out of these trou-
blesome times, who does not turn
around and say, 'hey man, stay on
track; you can do it' or 'you go girl,
go ahead and do your thing,"' he
said. "So think about it, are you one
of those people?"
The students said they appreci-
ated Dong taking them to the Uni-
versity and exposing them to all it
has to offer. They called him "one
of the best" teachers at their high
school, adding that he is "always
supportive" and encourages them
to get involved with extracurricular
activities.

REPORT
From Page 1A
work to make higher education
accessible and to ensure that our
students succeed."
According to the report, from
2003 to 2007, public universities
spent 28 percent more on aid to
students whose parents jointly
earned at least $115,000 per year.
That's an increase from $282.5 mil-
lion in 2003 to $361.4 million four
years later.
The report argues that the find-
ings indicate that public universi-
ties are straying from their mission
of providing a quality education to
individuals who could not afford to
attend more expensive private uni-
versities, adding that the colleges
are neglecting lower income stu-
dents for whom the schools were
created.
"During times of rapid increas-
es in the price of college, leaders
of these universities could have
chosen to deploy their own aid
resources in ways that cushioned
families near the bottom of the
economic ladder," the report said.
"But instead they chose differently,
spending hundreds of millions of
dollars every year to attract stu-
dents who had no financial need
whatsoever."
The report went on to say that
IFILL

she has experienced in her life.
During her time in the news
industry, Ifill said she experienced
many instances of racism, adding
thathaving pride in her racial iden-
tity helped her move past incidents
like when she found a note with a
racial slur on her desk.
She credited the same pride with
motivating her to challenge editors
when they proposed making cer-
tain editorial changes that could
have portrayed African-Americans
in a biased or stereotypical way.
Ifill also spoke about the need
to change what she perceived as
America's current discomfort with
openly discussing racial issues.
"My favorite moments come
when there is only one Black per-
son in the room and (someone
refers to that person as), 'the guy
with the blue blazer, in the back...,'
and you say, 'the Black guy?"' Ifill

reduced Pell Grants, on top of
decreasing financial aid from pub-
lic universities, have made it even
more difficult for lower income
students to afford college tuition.
The federal government awards
Pell Grants to students who fill
out the Free Application for Fed-
eral Student Aid and demonstrate
financial need.
"Thirty years ago, the federal
Pell Grant covered most of the cost
to attend a four-year college. Now,
it's only about one-third," Mary
Lynch, the research analyst who
conducted the analyses for the
report, said in a statement. "Not
surprisingly, smaller proportions
of low-income students enroll in
four-year colleges today than a
generation ago."
The report explicitly outlined
the fact that the University of
Michigan has a smaller number of
students who receive Pell Grants
than other colleges in the state.
According to the report, almost
39 percent of college students in
Michigan are Pell Grant recipients,
but only 13 percent of students
attending the University of Michi-
gan receive the grants.
Though the report outlined the
failures of the University and other
public institutions to make educa-
tion affordable for lower income
and minority students, it also
showed that some public universi-
said. "Stating the obvious is per-
fectly fine, unless the obvious hap-
pens to be about race."
In her speech, Ifill said this
kind of restricted dialogue dilutes
efforts to raise expectations.
"We don't want to knock down
walls and break glass ceilings
only to discover that our sons
and daughters don't want to walk
through," she said. "So many of
our sons and daughters buy into
the limits imposed by race, no mat-
ter what race they happen to be."
Ifillsaid though thehistoric elec-
tion of a black president is cause for
celebration, there is still a lot of
work to be done to maintain and
fulfill high expectations for mutual
racial respect. She added that liv-
ing up to such expectations "is the
real, and the best way to honor the
legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King."
Many audience members
addressed the notion of maintain-
ing high expectations during the
question-and-answer session that
followed Ifil's speech.
A high school freshman visit-

ties were successful in promoting
the enrollment of those groups.
According to the report, The
State University of New York at
Buffalo is one of the most improved
public universities in terms of
promoting minority graduation.
In 2005, the report said, minority
students graduated at a 67-percent
rate of white graduates. By 2008,
though, minority students gradu-
ated at a 93-percent rate of their
white counterparts.
Kati Haycock, director of The
Education Trust, acknowledged in
a statement that public universities
are receiving less and less fund-
ing from the state governments.
However, she added that they are
still well-funded and need to offer
more financial aid to students that
need it.
"These institutions receive more
generous public subsidies than
other colleges," Haycock wrote in
the statement. "They provide more
aid to their undergraduates than
any other funding source, and they
have the power to spend that aid
differently."
"As some institutions in this
study have shown, they can be as
good at competing for and graduat-
ing low-income and minority stu-
dents as they are at so many other
things - when they want to," Hay-
cock continued. "The question is,
'When will more of them do so?'
ing from Urban Prep Academy For
Young Men- a Chicago charter
school for African-American boys -
asked Ifill for "words of wisdom" for
young men surroundedby crime.
"Resist the easy answers," Ifill
responded, also encouraging the
young man to write down his story
as it happened in order to share it
with future generations.
First year Social Work student
Maurice Murray said he found the
exchange between the high school
student and Ifill relevant to his
studies.
"I just felt like that (aspect of
the presentation) was very applied,
very on-the-ground," Murray said
of the challenges that urban Afri-
can-American men face.
School of Music, Theater &
Dance freshman Alejandro Quin-
tanilla said he enjoyed the speech
but that it was "a lot to take in."
"At one point, it seemed like
(Ifill) was talking about tak-
ing things little by little; she was
focused on changing things step-
by-step," he said.

(March 2110o April 19)
Do whatever you can to maintain your
cool today. Because the Moon is in your
sign, you're more emotional than usual.
It's all too easy to bark at someone today.
(Stay frosty.)
TAUJRUS
(April 20 to May 20)
Some days it's easy to feel content,
with a warm feeling in your tummy; this
is not one of those days. Therefore, relax
and take it easy. Be patient with every-
one. Things will be easier for you if you
do.
GEMINI
(May 21 toJune 20)
Disputes with partners or children
about shared property and shared pos-
sessions are likely today. Don't make a
big deal about things. Lighten up.
CANCER
(June 211o July 22)
This isa poor day to contradict bosses,
parents, teachers and VIPs. Just let
things slide. Do not awaken the sleeping
giot. Arguments with authority figures
will not go well and might only be
regrettable.
LEO
(July 23 to Aug. 22)
Avoid arguments about racial issues,
politics and religion today. People will
quickly get vehemently angry (or snarly
and critical)! Who needs this?
VIRGO
(Aug. 23 to Sept. 22)
Eitheryot or somebody else feels very
territorial about your possessions or your
share of something today. This is a poor
day for important discussions about
these things.
LIBRA
(Sept. 23 to Oct. 22)
Don't try to have important discus-
sions with partners and close friends

today. They will not go well. Just keep
things light.
SCORPIO
(Oct .23 10Nov. 21)
Although you might have great ideas
about improving things at work or how
to introduce reforms, don't do it today.
People will squelch your ideas.
SAGITTARIUS
(Nov. 2210o Dec. 21)
Romance is rocky today. Ditto for
relationships with children. Therefore,
skate along lightly on the surface of
things. Keep smiling.
CAPRICORN
(Dec. 22to Jan. 19)
Avoid family disputes today! They
quickly will get ugly. All discussions
with authority figures will be unproduc-

Denzel Washington brings
gravitas and samurai skills
to 'The Book of Eli'
By KAVI SHEKHAR PANDEY
DailyFilm Editor
Ah, post-apocalyptic Earth: a bleak, treach-
erous wasteland of decay and desolation. Given
global warming, nuclear
stockpiling and the predic-
tions of the Mayan calendar,
a barren planet is an all too TheBo

tures an unsettling depiction and Showcase
of a world recovering from
catastrophe. It's a land of Warner Bros.
crumbling cities and dusty
highways - a place where a tube of ChapStick
is a valuable commodity. Sure, this description
doesn't seem different from similar material
like "The Road," but "The Book of Eli" distin-
guishes itself with unflinching messages of
religion and morality along with the indispens-
able abilities of its star, Denzel Washington
("American Gangster").
Washington plays Eli, a lonesome warrior in
possession of the last remaining copy of histo-
ry's most powerful and influential book - The
Holy Bible. He's the classic man on a mission,
solely devoted to his mysterious goal of taking
the book "west." But Eli isn't a steadfast beacon
of good, as one would expect from this sage-
like persona.
"Stay on the path. It's not your concern," Eli
mutters to himself as he ignores the slaughter
of innocent civilians by highway bandits. Eli
doesn't feel obligated to "do the right thing."
He's not willing to put himself in danger and
possibly compromise his mission, a paradox
that brings about the film's captivating char-
acterization of its protagonist. In his single-

minded mission, Eli ignores the principles
- like helping those in need, for one - of the
very text he so faithfully protects.
In a role seemingly fit for a brawnier star,
Washington excels as Eli, bringing his natu-
ral talent and gravitas to a man who runs his
life on faith but is internally tormented by the
daunting task he faces.
Eli certainly doesn't avoid confrontation.
When provoked, he willingly unleashes his
supreme samurai-like skills, effortlessly slic-
ing and dicing through gangs of cannibalistic
foes with his sizable knife. The film's action
sequences are beautiful to watch, with Eli's
graceful, virtuosic precision.
Many of the goons are sent out by Carnegie,
played by Gary Oldman ("The Dark Knight").
After a period of playing good guys, Oldman
is gleefully resurfacing as a maniacal villain
- the character type that has defined much of
his career (see "The Fifth Element" and "Leon:
The Professional"). Carnegie wants the Bible at
all costs, intending to unite the illiterate mass-
es into a functional community.
Carnegie's motivations raise a profound ques-
tion. His methods may be ruthless and vile, but
he would use the Bible to recreate civilization on
Earth by giving people a reason to live and work.
Does that justify his wicked actions?
It's moral ambiguity like this that sets "The
Book of Eli" apart from typical, mindless
action fare. Yet the film falters with its ach-
ingly sluggish plot, which plods along as slow
as Eli's march across the country. Also tacked
on after the tepid climax is a fairly clever but
ultimately frustrating ending that you'll either
loathe or adore.
With an archaic name following the phrase
"The Book of," the title suggests a chapter of
the Old Testament. In many ways, it's a new
addendum to the Bible - a moral story of a man
who struggles between right and wrong before
truly finding himself and his purpose on Earth.
As a whole, "The Book of Eli" is not as timeless
of a tale, but it should still be remembered for
a long time.

As a trained architect and photog-
rapher, Christopher Payne is known
for his interest
in the unusual.
From behe- Christopher

spectives of the M
American land- Thursday, Jan.
scape. 21 at 7p.m.
His interest At UMMA's Helmut
in photography Stern Auditorium
developed as Free
a result of his
architectural
work. The images in Payne's first book,
"New York's Forgotten Substations: The
Power Behind the Subway," were born
from researching necessity, not artistic
intention.
"My first book ... was originally
envisioned as a book of mostly draw-
ings, based on detailed sketches I was
making of machines in the substations.
I rarely had time to finish sketches on
site, so I took pictures to help me com-
plete them later at home," Payne wrote
in an e-mail interview with The Michi-
gan Daily.
As his research progressed, howev-
er, Payne began to take a more artistic
approach in analyzing his subject.
"Over time, these snapshots became
more complex, requiring better light-
ing, equipment and preparation," Payne
added.
Payne will be giving a lecture at Uni-
versity of Michigan Museum of Art this
Thursday about his new book, "Asylum:
Inside the Closed World of State Mental
Hospitals," which features his six-year
study of deserted state mental institu-
tions.
"The main focus of the book and my
photographs is to portray these insti-
tutions in a more objective light, by
making palpable their incredible archi-
tecture, their operation as thriving self
sufficient communities, and the vital
role they once played in American soci-
ety, for better or worse," Payne wrote.
When asked why he chose asylums,
Payne described his exposure to men-
tal institutions as an opportunity that
came by chance.
"A friend, knowing my interest in
abandoned buildings and infrastruc-
ture, suggested mental hospitals,"
Payne wrote. "As fate would have it,
the first one I visited was Pilgrim State
Hospital, one of the largest in the world,
and it made a strong impression on me
that day."
"As methods of treating mental ill-

ness improved and people no longer
required long-term institutionaliza-
tion, the asylums outlived their useful-
ness and were gradually abandoned.
Now they are ... an obsolete typology (of
architecture)," he added.
Though Payne analyzed these aban-
doned buildings from an architectural
point of view, a more personal attach-
ment flourished.
"Over the course of six years, I spent
hundreds of hours working alone and
undisturbed in these buildings, devel-
oping an intimate connection with them
and strong sense of proprietorship, as
perhaps, their final guardian," Payne
wrote.
"The joy I gained in taking beautiful
pictures was always tempered by a pro-
found sense of loss and sadness, for the
people who lived in the asylums, and for
the buildings that now stand empty and
discarded" he added. "Most of the plac-
es I visited will be demolished."
At the lecture, Payne will discuss the
aspects of asylums that he discovered in
his research.
"My slide lecture will encompass the
rise, fall and ultimate demise of asy-
lums and state hospitals," Payne wrote.
"I will present historical images in the
beginning, to provide context, and then
my contemporary photos, taking the
audience on a journey to show what the
hospitals once were, and what they have
now become."
The beauty and
loss derived in
mental hospitals.
As a testament to the wide-reaching
influence of Payne's research, a diverse
group of University organizations is
sponsoring his visit, includingthe Taub-
man College of Architecture and Urban
Planning, the Department of English
Language and Literature and the Cen-
ter for the History of Medicine.
Branching off of his subject's diversi-
ty is Payne's assertion that mental insti-
tutions have a clouded history of which
not many people are aware.
"In their day, the asylums were the
largest buildings around, and they dom-
inated the American landscape," Payne
wrote. "Before they became objects
of derision, they were sources of great
civic pride, and not many people know
this."
In addition to breaking through the
mystery of asylums, Payne also wants
his lectures to be considered a call to
action, as he believes that these "archi-
tectural treasures" should be saved.

BLUE MOUNTAIN
From Page 5A
hard to find boring. As for the
dialogue, well, there's something
called wit, and then there's such a
thing as a kernel of clever dipped
in so much blatant sexism and
macho-esque blabber that it's
hard not to laugh at the sheer
extremity of it.
The football coach (Ed Marino,
"Circus Camp') is a prime exam-
ple of this type of writing. After
listening to quotes like "Some
weak pathetic pussy coined the
phrase 'winning isn't every-
thing' " and "We suck the milk
out of their mothers' tits and use
it as mouthwash! We rip off their
dicks and invite them to an orgy!"
there are two possible reactions.
One is throwing up. The second is
to cock an eyebrow and give in to
low-IQ laughter.
While not exactly grade-A
quality, "trickle down banging"
can be momentarily funny. How-
ever, the portrayal of women is
obnoxiously bitchy, and the heavy
metal music and testosterone-
laden boob parties are such bla-
tant objectifications that it gets to
be rather annoying.
But stereotypes seem to be
the name of the game in "Blue
Mountain State," and those who
somehow see some humor in that
might actually find it amusing.
THE MAID

appears on the scene that the
movie gets revitalized; she's loud
and affectionate and challenges
Raquel. When Raquel locks her
out of the house, Lucy sunbathes
topless on the front lawn rather
than chase after her angrily.
Despite the dark humor of the
earlier partofthe film, none of the
characters ever laugh - Loyola's
Lucy uncovers the warmth of
"The Maid."
BAYONETTA
From Page 5A
The angels in the world of
"Bayonetta" aren't so much
pudgy-faced cherubs as giant,
mono-eyed, muscle-bound,
weapon-wielding monsters who
show up in hoards, vying for the
protagonist's blood. With the
help of a short Mafioso caricature
(who sounds suspiciously like
Joe Pesci) and a towering arms
dealer, Bayonetta searches for the
answers behind her mysterious
past, one dead angel-monster at
a time.
But the story of "Bayonetta" is
very, very much beside the point
of the game. Revealed through
grainy footage and a film reel
border, the game's plot is like a
B-movie's: It's cheesy, predictable
and over the top. And it knows it.
The self-conscious awfulness of
the script is one of many aspects
that are so appealing about "Bay-
onetta." The game wants the
player laughing at the absurdity
until they are dead-focused on
the actual gameplay and combat.
And for the most part, it's quite
successful.
It's all about the combat. "Bay-
onetta" takes players through 15

levels filled to the brim with bad
guys of all shapes and sizes, from
winged heads to mammoth demi-
gods, and each needs a beating in
its own particular way. The con-
trols are just this side of button-
mashing, with enough nuance to
keep players always reaching for
that perfect combo - that exact
set of moves that will send a given
angel back to its Maker. One
might be able to hack through
the first couple of levels without
much effort, but for the most part
the dozens and dozens of battles
will require full attention and
provide an addicting challenge.
The game is not without its
problems. There are way too
many cut scenes for a plot so ter-
rible, and the outlandishness
starts to wear thin after a while.
And Bayonetta herself will start
to grate almost immediately, with
her smarmy, British sarcasm and
excessively suggestive word-
play. But that shouldn't prevent
you from giving "Bayonetta" a
try. While the rest of the gaming
industry is taking itself a little too
seriously, straining a little under
the weight of achieving the cov-
eted status of "art," it's refreshing
to have some expertly designed, 4
stylish, dumb fun - the stuff
guilty pleasures are made of.

MICHIGAN 68, CONNECTICUT 63

Recruit
Gardner
enrolled
in classes
By NICOLE AUERBACH
Daily SportsEditor
During halftime of Sunday's Michi-
gan-Connecticut basketball game, foot-
ball coach Rich Rodriguez spoke to
reporters about injury and personnel
updates. Dancing around most questions
about recruits, Rodriguez confirmed
that six of them have enrolled early. The
six are: Stephen Hopkins (RB), Jeremy
Jackson (WR), Austin White (RB), Jerald
Robinson (WR), Christian Pace (OL) and
Ricardo Miller (WR).
"We have one more spot open," said
Rodriguez. "That could or could not be
filled. Hopefully, it will sooner rather than
later."
That final spot may already be filled.
The Detroit News and Detroit Free
Press have reported that incoming fresh-
man quarterback Devin Gardner will begin
classes at Michigan on Tuesday, and in all
likelihood, he's the "one spot" Rodriguez
referred to. Rodriguez can't talk about
Gardner until he officially enrolls, but he
did sit next to the highly touted quarter-
back recruit at the basketball game.
Overall, Rodriguez felt his recruiting
has gone "very well," and that the incom-
ing recruiting class was in "good shape."
He said he can potentially sign 26 recruits
this year because the Wolverines didn't
meet the maximum 25 last year. He wasn't
sure if he will use all 26 spots.
Rodriguez also said he hasn't heard any-
thing new about the NCAA investigation.
He also confirmed that linebacker Brandon
Smith has transferred.
Rodriguez didn't seem concerned about
immediately finding a replacement for
departed linebackers coach Jay Hopson,
who left for the defensive coordinator posi-
tion at Memphis. Rodriguez said he could
find a replacement before or after National
Signing Day (Feb. 1).
Rodriguez said current sophomore
defensive tackle Mike Martin is still recov-
ering from an offseason shoulder surgery
and won't be ready to practice with the
team in the comingmonths.
"He'll miss the spring, but he should be
fine by summertime," said Rodriguez, add-
ing that Martin's procedure went well.
Rodriguez said surgeries for center
David Molk (ACL) and running back Vin-
cent Smith (ACL) went well. They, too, will
miss springpractices.

Junior Manny Harris goes up for a dunk in the Wolverines' 68-63 upset victory against Connecticut on Sunday. Harris finished the game with 18 points to lead the team in scoring. SAID ALSALAH/Daily
CONNQUERING HEROES

No, he hadn't hit either of his first two
3-point attempts in the game. In fact, Zack
Novak has been trying to find his long-range
stroke all year. Despite that, when he got
another chance to bomb one from deep late
in Michigan's 68-63 win over Connecticut
on Sunday, the sophomore was so excited to
shoot it he mishandled the ball and had to
pass it up. "(Junior Manny Harris) threw
the one to me and I'm so jacked to shoot it
that I just bobble it out of my hands," Novak
said. "So I knew the next opportunity I
got, I knew it was going in."

By JOE STAPLETON
Daily SportsEditor
That next opportunity came with
1:30 left in the game after the Huskies
tied it at 58.. Harris had the ball at the
top of the key. He hesitated, drove the
lane, and kicked out to Novak, who hit
the fadeaway 3-pointer to give Michigan
the lead for good.
In a season like the one the Wolver-
ines have had, endless optimism is a
great asset. Zack Novak's attitude in the
waning minutes of Sunday's game (just
get me the ball, this next one's going in)
is the same as the team's (let's focus on
the next game, this next one's gonna be
a win).
But this one didn't always look like
a win, with Michigan going down 12-6
early.
And then, Stu Douglass happened.
The sophomore hit two 3-pointers
in less than a minute to tie the game,
then assisted Harris on a fast break for
a crowd-igniting dunk. Just like that,
Michigan was up 14-12.

Despite entering the game with a sig-
nificant size disadvantage, as they often
do, the Wolverines controlled much of
the first half with great defense in the
paint, holding Connecticut to 23 points.
Instead of letting offensive miscues
get inside the Wolverines' heads and
effect their defensive intensity, Michi-
gan coach John Beilein said he saw his
team play tough defense throughout
- unlike what happened in last week's
game against Northwestern, when the
Wolverines let misses on offense affect
their effort on defense.
Every good college basketball team
will make a run every game, and Con-
necticut's came as the second half start-
ed. The Huskies went on a 18-8 run,
which included their lone 3-pointer of
the game, and took a 41-40 lead at the
13:15 mark.
The game went back and forth
until the final minutes when Michi-
gan regained its lead on Novak's lone
heroic 3-pointer. That shot put Michi-
gan up three and was quickly fol-

Michigan drops first-ever shootout
By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sparta Writer4
Yost Arena has seen NCAA tourna-
ment games, multiple conference and
NCAA championship hockey teams, and
just about every other conceivable situ-
ation in college hockey. Before that, it
housed the golden era of short-shorts and
Michigan basketball.
But in a seemingly normal weekend
split for the Michigan hockey team, Yost
and the Michigan hockey program saw
something for the first time: a shootout.
As Michigan headed into the weekend
series against Alaska Fairbanks, Beren-
son talked about the importance of get-
ting the first goal. But it was the last one
of the weekend - the shootout marker by
Alaska's Dion Roelsen to give the Nano-
oks a 4-3 win - that was the most impor-
tant.
Friday's 6-0 win started as freshman
Lee Moffie got the all-important open-
ing marker, streaking in from the blue
line and burying a pass from junior Carl
Hagelin. After senior Steve Kampfer's
wrist shot was tipped past Alaska goal-
tender Scott Greenham just 27 seconds
later, senior Brian Lebler fired a wrist JED MOCH/Daly
shot destined for the top corner less than Freshman Kevin Lynch fights for the puck during the Wolverines' shootout loss against Alaska.

t took until Saturday night for me
to realize that there are few things
more soul-crushing, more buzz-
killing than ending in a tie.
But losing in a shootout is definitely
one of them. One that the Michigan
hockey team now
understands after
Saturday's shoot-
out loss to Alaska.
Down by one
with just 2:19P
remaining in the
final period, senior
defenseman Chad
Langlais picked RYAN
up a loose puck in
the slot and fired it KARTJE
home to the tie the
game. Knotted at
three and controlling the momentum,
there was no way the Wolverines were
going to lose this game.
"I felt like, 'Finally, the puck finally
got to the net,'" Michigan coach Red
Berenson said.
Things were falling into place for a
second straight series sweep.
They dominated the overtime,

Tourney bid
allowing just one quality shot that slid
past Hogan and tinged off of the post
(resulting in a collective "holy crap
that should've gone in" from the Yost
crowd). Michigan outshot Alaska 6-1 in
the additional frame.
So when Nanook forward Dion
Knelsen deked junior goaltender Bryan
Hogan out of his skates for the first and
only score in the first and only shootout
in Michigan hockey history, the loud-
est crowd I had ever heard at Yost Ice
Arena came to the same solemn conclu-
sion as I did.
A tie may be like "kissingyour sis-
ter," as the old adage says, but losing in
a shootout is like your sister publicly
humiliating you after said kiss.
Berenson made it clear after the
game that the Wolverines "didn't
look very good" in their first shootout
action. Junior Carl Hagelin, freshman
Chris Brown and sophomore Louie
Caporusso - Michigan's three shootout
participants - looked mediocre, fail-
ing to challenge Alaska goalie Scott
Greenham with any flashy moves or a
deceptive shot like Knelsen did for the

Sunday. I say forget them.

because I was right out there on

of you. But
I'm not sure

ing of that
epic celebra- ANDY
tion. REID
The overall
emotion out
there on the court wasn't so much
joy, though we were pretty happy
after such a dramatic and fun
game.
It was relief.
Last week in this column, I
said this year has probably been
the worst, most disappointing
year in Michigan sports history.
I said that as a senior, it was a
shame to see all of Michigan's
biggest teams drastically fall
short of expectations.
But finally, the Wolverines
gave us something to cheer about.
And we took full advantage of it.
The game-day atmosphere
inside Crisler Arena on Saturday
just built and built until even the
old guys who usually sit with
their hands in their laps were
whooping and hollering - coach
John Beilein just better hope the
same crowd comes back next
week against Michigan State.
"The Maize Rage was awe-
some, even our other fans, every-
one was into it," Zack Novak told
reporters after the game.
The student section was better
than I've ever seen it. Finally, all
2,500 students who bought tick-
ets after last year's NCAA Tour-
nament run took the long walk

down to Crisler. There was even
a rowdy student contingent in the
upper bowl.
Students rushed the court,
other fans, too - even Brandon
Graham and quarterback recruit
Devin Gardner got into the mid-
court fun.
Until Saturday, there hadn't
been a marquee win in the big
three sports all season (I would
count Notre Dame, but that win
doesn't look very impressive at all
after the Irish tanked epically).
The fans were desperate for
something to be happy about.
That's why they rushed the
court, and that's why it's justified.
It was about more than bas-
ketball. More than Jim Calhoun,
Jerome Dyson and Stanley Rob-
inson. More than Beilein and
Manny and DeShawn.
Let's face it, this one win
doesn't mean the Wolverines
are in the Tournament, even if a
10-7 team inexplicably received
six votes in the newest Coaches'
Poll top 25. Heck, unless the
Wolverines can finish strong in
an increasingly difficult Big Ten
schedule, they might not even
have the .500 record required for
the NIT.
After the game, Manny said
this might be a turning point. It
was the kick-start that Michigan
needed to get into full gear (about
two months too late). But with
games against Purdue, Wisconsin
and Michigan State up next, a
late-season push doesn't exactly
seem likely.
But that doesn't matter right
now.
For those brief minutes we got
to spend on the court after the
game, we all finally got to say
that collective "whew." One more
disappointment might have been
just a little too crippling.

Home win against

Senior Margaret Kelly touched
the wall first in the 200-yard indi-
vidual medley, but she didn't have
much time to celebrate the vic-
tory.
Moments later, she stepped
onto the starting block to anchor
the 200-yard freestyle relay.
While the Wolverines maintained
a slight lead in the first half of the
race, Northwestern captured the
lead by 14 hundredths of a second
heading into the final leg when
Kelly took over for Michigan.
The senior finished the final
50 yards in a blistering 22.63 sec-
onds to give the Wolverines the
event victory. Kelly's final leg was
the fastest split among her team-
mates.
"It wasn't easy," Kelly said of
the final race. "I think it's easier to
go from a longer event to a shorter
one. So that kind of helped, and
I just took some deep breaths. I
knew I could do it."

Senior Margaret Kelly helped the Wolverines defeat the 23rd-ranked Wildcats with her relay anchor performance.

of the season over No. 23 North-
western, 157.5 to 142.5.
But the win took a little help
from the Wildcats.
In the first event of the after-
noon, Northwestern's 400-yard.
medley relay finished first, but
the Wildcats were disqualified for
jumping one of the exchanges.
The result could have swayed
the outcome in what turned out to
be a close meet between the two
ranked teams.
"We knew it would be close,"
Michigan coach Jim Richardson
said. "I'm sorry for Northwest-
ern that they jumped it because
it would have been a one-point
meet. I'm glad the meet didn't
come down to that relay making
a difference."
The Wolverines (1-1 Big Ten,
3-5 overall) were also propelled
to victory by fifth-year senior
distance specialist Emily Brun-
emann.

After suffering a rare loss in
one of her specialty events last
weekend, Brunemann returned
to form against Northwestern
(1-3, 4-3). She started the 500-
yard freestyle strong, cruising to
an easy victory. Brunemann also
captured an event victory in the
1000-yard freestyle. Brunemann
and senior Emily Hanson took the
top two spots in the event.
"I had a lot of motivation,"
Brunemann said. "I looked at the
score before I got. up for the 500
and at that point I don't know if it
was adjusted or not, but we were
101 and they had 105. I wasn't
okay with that and I wanted to do
something to make sure we pulled
back ahead."
For the first time this season,
Brunemann competed in the 200-
yard butterfly.
The event pinned arguably
Michigan's two best swimmers
against one another, Kelly and

Brunemann. Kelly took control
of the race early and never relin-
quished the lead, touching the
wall first. Surprisingly, Brun-
emann wasn't far behind, finish-
ing in second place in an event she
rarely swims.
The Wolverines won the final
three events to seal their first Big
Ten victory of the season. But the
win didn't come without some
adversity. Michigan sophomore
Caitlin Dauw sat out due to a back
injury and senior Emily Christy
struggled through a shoulder
injury. Junior Natasha Moodie
and freshman Julia Andracki also
battled through illness during the
meet.
"I think we needed it coming
off a couple losses," Brunemann
said. "I think it was something
that really motivated the team
and something that we needed as
a team to keep our eye on the main
prize at the end of the year."

Wright provides spark off bench

ARIEL BOND/Daly
Junior Ben Baldus-Strauss returned to the Windy City Invitational where last year
he partially tore his MCL. The junior competed in the high bar event this weekend.
Blue miast looks
to overcome injuries

By CAITLIN SMITH
Daily Sports Writer
CHICAGO - For junior Ben Bal-
dus-Strauss, a trip with the men's
gymnastics team to the Windy City
Invitational this past weekend was
more than just another competition
- it was a reminder of his health and
his injury-plagued career as a Wol-
verine.
Baldus-Strauss has endured a
cycle of sport-related injuries since
the beginning of his college gym-
nastics career.
His freshman year started with a
stress fracture to his wrist. He was
in a cast for about a month but was
back and competing by February.
Baldus-Strauss made it through
most of that season unharmed until
NCAA preliminaries.
In the final stretch of his fresh-
man season, Baldus-Strauss broke
his left ankle and tore his deltoid
ligament. He didn't compete in the
NCAA team finals, and it took him
nearly four months to complete
rehab.
His first meet back was the open-
er to his sophomore campaign at
the 2009 Windy City Invitational.
"I was second up on the first
event," Baldus-Strauss said. "I
missed my hand, peeled off the
(high) bar, and caught my knee on
the mat weird. I ended up partially
tearing my MCL, so that put me out
yet another month."
Despite another setback, Baldus-
Strauss finished the 2009 season
strong. He received an Academic
All-Big Ten selection and was a
2009 Big Tenindividual event final-
ist on the vault.
And as he returned this past
weekend to the same Chicago gym-

nasium, a year after his last injury,
he was definitely apprehensive.
"I think my freshman year on
vault, when I got hurt, I was just so
confident that I didn't even think
twice about where I was in the air,"
Baldus-Strauss said. "I was just
programmed to do it. But now I am
much more careful thinking about
absorbing the landing and having
my feet in the right position."
He considers his knee injury to
be the result of an unlucky fluke,
so performing in the same atmo-
sphere and on top of the same mats
brought increased anxiety to his
high-bar routine. As an extra pre-
caution, the Michigan coaches kept
a second mat underneath Baldus-
Strauss during the event.
More than anything, Baldus-
Strauss hopes to finish his last two
years as injury-free as possible.
Though his motivation may have
been stunted in the past, he has
high ambitions for the rest of his
college career.
"One goal I have for myself is
All-American by my senior year,"
Baldus-Strauss said. "But in terms
of the team, we obviously want to
repeat the Big Ten Championship
and hopefully an NCAA Champi-
onship."
Like any serious competitor,
pain, loss of practice, and watching
your team go on without you, can
easily take a toll on both mental and
physical capabilities. But, Baldus-
Strauss believes he has become a
stronger gymnast through injuries.
"My injuries have taught me
that you have to be so aware during
every skill," Baldus-Strauss said.
"You can't ever take anything for
granted, because anything can go
wrong and result in an injury."

After searching all season for
that elusive third scorer, Michi-
gan finally found not just a third,
but a fourth and fifth in Sunday's
upset win over Connecticut.
One of those sources came as
somewhat of a surprise.
Michigan unleashed its secret
weapon in redshirt junior Antho-
ny Wright, whose previous season
high had been five point efforts
against Northern Michigan and
Creighton.
Even more surprising, Wright
led the Wolverines in perhaps
their most vulnerable stage.
When several Michigan starters
got into foul trouble early, and
senior DeShawn Sims and junior
Manny Harris combined for
just eight points in the first half,
Wright carried some of the load.
In fact, Wright tied Harris and
sophomore Laval Lucas Perry
as the second-leading scorer for
the Wolverines in the first half
and combined with senior Zack
Gibson for 25 minutes in the
game. The two provided balanced
offense and the size to match a
more physical Husky team.
"Our bench has not been a
strength all year long," Michi-
gan coach John Beilein said. "For
whatever reason, we haven't. But
maybe this is the confidence that
those two need."
Wright made two of his three
3-point shots in the first half, hit-
ting his first spot-up jumper at
the 8:08 mark. Six minutes later,
Wright's second triple extended
Michigan's lead to eight with 2:25
to play in the half.
While the Michigan fans may
have held their breath each time
Wright went up with the ball, he
says he has confidence in his shot.
"I've been hitting in practice,
and in games I'm looking to shoot
but I'm trying to find the team
shot," Wright said. "Today, I got
a lot of team shot opportunities,
that was probably the biggest
thing."
More important, Wright hit
his third three at the beginning
of the second half, halting a 7-0
Connecticut run that cut the
Michigan lead down to just four.
Wright's three with 16 minutes to
play reignited the Wolverines.
But it wasn't just Wright who
contributed. Michigan had by far
its most balanced effort on the
stat sheet all season. And while
it was no surprise that Harris led
the Wolverines with 18 points,

Redshirtjunior Anthony Wright scored a season high nine points off of three 3-point shots in Michigan's 68-63 win Sunday.

it was a bit of a shock that Sims,
Michigan's second-leading scorer,
tallied just eight points against
the Huskies.
Both Wright and sophomore
Zack Novak finished ahead of
Sims in points scored.
While Wright may have been
the biggest surprise in Sunday's
upset win, he wasn't alone. All
season, Michigan has struggled to
find offense from any source out-
side of Harris and Sims.
And while sophomore Stu Dou-
glass and Novak are known for
their three-point shooting, they

are shooting just 32 and 27 per-
cent from behind the arc, respec-
tively.
Though the two didn't fare
much better than their season
averages, it was the quality of shot
that mattered.
In the final minutes of the
game Novak hit perhaps the
most important shot of his
career, breaking a 58-58 tie with
a 3-pointer that put Michigan up
for good.
And though Gibson scored
just four points in the contest,
he recorded a mammoth block in

the first half and made countless
hustle plays on defense with two
steals.
Even though Michigan can't
expect an effort across the board
throughout the rest of the sea-
son like it saw Sunday against
the Huskies, the Wolverines can't
continually put all of the pressure
on Harris and Sims as they head
into the meat of their conference
schedule.
"Michigan needs that," Con-
necticut coach Jim Calhoun said.
"Harris and Sims can't be the only
stars in town."

which Harris finished at the rim to
give the Wolverines a command-

left.
Harris finished with a game-
high 18 points, 12 in the second
half. The other member of Michi-
gan's Big Two, senior DeShawn
Sims, had a relatively quiet after-
noon, tallying just eight points, but
the forward still managed to grab

11 rebounds.
"I just didn't hit shots. It was
unfortunate but I did some other
things," Sims said. "I focused on
defense and rebounding and mak-
ing some ' of those hustle plays.
That was enough to get us over the
top."
And for the first time this
season, when Harris and Sims
couldn't find their shots, the rest of
the team stepped up in a big way.
Novak had 10 points and the big-

"It's just a matter of being ready

said. "Which I always have been.

Now the team has an opportu-

they believe Sunday's win leaves

That relentless optimism will
certainly come into play during
this next stretch of games.

team," Harris said. "This is giving
us a lot of confidence, and we've
got a great stretch. Hopefully we
keep it going."

a minute after that.
Michigan (8-7-1-0 CCHA,
13-10-1 overall) had scored all
three of these goals ina span of one
minute and 23 seconds.
"That is back to Michigan hock-
ey," senior defensemen Chris Sum-
mers said. "That's been my past
experience the last three years and
that has always been our style to
come out and jump the team early
on. I think that was the first time
all season we really honed in and
did that."
But Friday's relatively easy scor-
ing was short lived as goals were
at their usual premium Saturday.
Heading into the shootout tied at
three, both teams chose its three
players to shoot and try to gain the
extra point.
After four players had shot,
the Wolverines found themselves
down 1-0 with all their hopes
dependent on junior Louie Capo-
russo.
With everyone in the build-
ing on their feet, Caporusso faked
backhand and went to the five-
hole. Greenham read the deke and
shut the door on Caporusso ending
the Wolverines' season-high four-
game win streak.
"It is a fun position to be in,"
Caporusso said. "When you have
the game on your stick - that's the
type of thing you want to have. You
always think about that and imag-
ine it when you're playingwith your
little brother on the outside rink....
Hopefully, next time I put it in."

points on the weekend. But accord-
ing to the coaching staff, the team
needed more.
"No, we needed six," Berenson
said when asked just before he left
the press conference.
Perhaps the biggest difference
between the two games was in
penalties. The Nanooks (7-7-4-4,
10-7-5) came into the weekend as
the least-penalized team in the

country, but racked up 22 minutes
on Friday. The Wolverines convert-
ed on two of their 10 chances, but
held the momentum throughout
the contest because of the regular-
ity with which Alaska went to the
penalty box.
But on Saturday, Michigan's
march to the penalty box started
just over a minute into the game
when junior Tristin Llewellyn

went off, starting a 16 minute slide.
Alaska's two goals on the man

Wolverines win
SMU Classic
despite fatigue

Senior Ryan McCarthy dismounts at last year's Big Ten Championships at Crisler Arena. McCarthy turned in a great effort in the Wolverines' second-place finish at the

With new workout
regimen, Michigan
focuses on NCAA
Championship
By RYAN A. PODGES
Daily Sports Writer
Usually, a coach would be wor-
ried if his team entered a competi-
tion tired.
But going into the SMU Classic
in Dallas on Friday and Saturday,
men's swimming and diving coach
Mike Bottom wasn't concerned
that his team was exhausted.
In fact, he was glad.
Junior Tyler Clary described the
team's preparation during the days
before the meet.
"We swam a hard threshold
workout on Monday, we had a
hard lactate workout on Tuesday,
Wednesday was really tough and
we lifted hard on Thursday."
And as if that wasn't enough,
Bottom had the team swim 6,000
yards each morning before the
meet even started. Enough to swim
down the length of a football field
and back 30 times.
Despite their fatigue, the Wol-
verines battled and won the meet
for the second-straight year. They
faced a difficult field of six teams
including No. 6 Florida, No. 13
Southern California, No. 19 Purdue
and several professional swimmers
from Swim MAC Carolina, a club
team. With only two heats of each
event, Michigan was allowed to
bring just eight of its top swimmers
and one diver.
While the Wolverines may not
be used to such intensity before a
meet, it wasn't torture or punish-
ment. It's all part of the coaches'
plan to prepare for better perfor-
mances in the NCAA Champion-
ships, for which the Wolverines got
off to a slow start last year in Bot-
tom's first season as coach.
"Lastyearwe restedtoomuchfor
the in-season meets and when we
got to the NCAA meet we weren't
as sharp as we should have been,"
senior co-captain Andr6 Schultz
said. "Our approach nowis rougher,
it's tougher and it hurts a lot more
to race, but I think it's going to be
worth it in the long run."

Claryled the team in points from
individual events. He won the 400-
yard individual medley (3:50.09)
and the consolation finals of the
100-yard backstroke. Senior co-
captain Chris Brady won the 100-
yard butterfly (47.36) and placed
second in the SO-yard freestyle
behind Cullen Jones, a U.S. Olym-
pic gold medalist in 2008.
Senior Alon Mandel won the
consolation finals in the 200-yard
butterfly. He placed second in the
championship heat of the 100-yard
backstroke - losingto MAC's Nichol
Thoman, who set a new pool record.
"I had a really good meet," Man-
del said. "I swam faster than last
year when I was wearing a full
body suit (which is longer allowed)
so that was encouraging because
there is a physical and psychologi-
cal componentto notwearingthat."
And Michigan's performance
was more than encouraging. Even
though the Wolverines failed to
win a single championship final on
the second day of competition, their
overall consistency in the lineup
won the meet.
Bottom, widely considered one
of the world's best sprint coaches,
loves so develop a strong mentality
for racing in his swimmers. And he
enjoyed watching his team fight for
every point in the close races.
"We're building character,
we're building camaraderie, learn-
ing how to race and we're gaining
momentum," he said. "That's the
process of building a good team and
hopefully this carries over to the
next meet and the next meet."
If it does, there's one thing no
one will be tired of. Winning.
EMU: While nine of their team-
mates competed in Texas at the
SMU Classic, the rest of the Wol-
verines competed against, neigh-
boring Eastern Michigan.
Like last year, all events in the
meet were relays, with each relay
team consisting of swimmers from
both schools. The meet was not
scored.
"It's a great opportunity to rec-
ognize the community and fel-
lowship of athletics," Michigan
assistantcoach Dr. Josh White said.
"Competition is usually the main
focus, but the friendship between
these two schools that are so close,
the community of the sport is what
we were tryingto emphasize."

Wolverines defeat
four highly ranked
teams in annual
Invitational
By CAITLIN SMITH
Daily Sports Writer
CHICAGO - Between event
rotations, an unexpected "Go!"
emanates from the huddle of
Michigan gymnasts. From across
the gym, a group of Wolverine
fans shout, "Blue!" in response -
trying to excite both the athletes
and spectators alike. It was hard
to believe that the match was 250
miles away from Ann Arbor.
On Saturday night, the Michi-
gan men's gymnastics team took
second place at the Windy City
Invitational, ahead of Big Ten
opponents No. 7 Ohio State, No. 8
Minnesota and No. 10 Iowa, and
also No. 11 Illinois-Chicago.

Michigan was looking to win
back-to-back Windy City Invita-
tional titles, but they fell just short
of No. 5 Illinois. The fourth-ranked
Wolverines scored 351.350 points,
just two points fewer than the
Fighting Illini. Ohio State claimed
third place with a score of 347.150.
Michigan and Ohio State battled
for firstrplace throughout the invita-
