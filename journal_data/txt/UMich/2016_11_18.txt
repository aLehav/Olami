As part of Transgender 

Awareness 
Week, 
the 

Spectrum 
Center 
and 

TransForm, 
a 
student 

organization 
that 
focuses 

on 
transgender 
activism 

and support, held a panel 
discussion Thursday where 
speakers at the University 
of Michigan who identify 
as transgender women or 
transgender femme shared 
their experiences on campus.

At the discussion, attended 

by 
about 
35 
students, 

panelists told stories of when 
they 
struggled 
to 
realize 

their gender identities and 

determine how they wanted 
to represent them publicly. 
Panelists 
described 
how 

they struggled with realizing 
and 
expressing 
their 

gender identities, as well as 
anecdotes 
about 
receiving 

threats 
and 
being 
called 

names on campus because of 
them.

Panelist LaVelle Ridley, a 

Rackham graduate student, 
said it was important to 
discuss transgender women’s 
positive stories to contrast 
those 
of 
bullying 
and 

intimidation.

“Trans 
women, 
and 

especially trans women of 
color, fall into these stories 
of just being harassed or 

Students 
and 
staff 
filled 

the Hatcher Graduate Library 
gallery Thursday for the annual 
Campus Sustainability Town 
Hall Meeting to discuss the 
University of Michigan’s efforts 
to meet long-term sustainability 
goals.

In 2006, the University set 

several goals for reducing the 
campus’s negative effect on the 
environment by 2025, including 
the reduction of greenhouse gas 
emissions by 25 percent and of 
landfill waste by 40 percent. 
At Thursday’s event, various 
University 
staff 
members 

addressed 
these 
particular 

goals by outlining initiatives 
to reduce both emissions and 
waste.

Andy Berki, director of the 

Office of Campus Sustainability, 
said the University’s efforts 
thus far have been moderately 
successful, citing the relative 
stability of the University’s 
environmental 
footprint 

despite its 22 percent growth in 
infrastructure — an increase of 
8 million square feet in the past 
10 years.

However, 
he 
also 
said 

additional 
efforts 
and 

innovative 
solutions 
are 

necessary to meet the reduction 
numbers set in 2006.

“A lot of efforts are making a 

difference, yet our goals are not 
normalized,” he said. “They’re 
absolute. … As an institution, 

that’s one of the big challenges 
we face, is how to meet our long-
term sustainability goals.”

Presenters 
described 

several operations that will be 
implemented in the coming 
years, including an increase 
in the amount of power the 
University produces internally, 
the transition of the Big House 
to zero-waste production by 
2017 and a boost in composting 
opportunities around campus. 

Presenters also raised the topic 
of fostering a sustainability-
oriented 
campus 
climate, 

highlighting initiatives like the 
Sustainable Living Experience 
theme community for freshmen.

The 
event 
also 
included 

various booths, manned by 
various University departments 
and student organizations that 
audience members could visit 
before and after the event. 
Focusing 
on 
sustainability 

efforts, these booths included 
Planet Blue Student Leaders 
and the Student Sustainability 
Initiative, which aim to facilitate 
a campus-wide commitment to 
sustainability-related actions.

Tracy Artley, an employee 

with 
the 
University 
Waste 

Reduction 
and 
Recycling 

Office who presented during 
the 
town 
hall, 
emphasized 

the importance of events like 

Over 
the 
past 
month, 

MHealthy’s 
Tobacco 

Consultation 
Service 
has 

encouraged smokers in the 
University 
of 
Michigan 

community to “Quit For A 
Day” on Thursday as part of a 
nationwide anti-smoking day 
sponsored by the American 
Cancer Society.

As part of their campaign, 

TCS 
connected 
with 
other 

branches 
of 
the 
University 

Health System by attending 
staff meetings and discussing 
their services throughout the 
month.

The service also distributed 

quit kits on campus, which 
hold information about ways to 
quit, including devices like Red 
Hots candies, worry stones and 
other resources, and to patients 
across the health system who 
are interested in quitting.

Additionally, TCS sponsored 

a webinar Tuesday led by 
Kate 
Collins, 
regulatory 

counsel in the Food and Drug 
Administration’s 
Center 
for 

Tobacco Products, to discuss

Ashley Blake, community and engagement lead at Avalon House, speaks about addressing chronic homelessness in the School of Social Work Building Thursday.

The University of Michigan’s 

School of Social Work hosted 
a talk on the current state of 
homelessness 
in 
Washtenaw 

County and the efforts social 
workers 
and 
organizations 

undertake to combat it Thursday 
evening.

The 
event, 
organized 
by 

the 
Community 
Action 
and 

Social Change Student Board 
and presented to an audience 
of about 20 students, included 
speaker 
Ashley 
Blake, 
a 

community building lead with 
Avalon Housing, an Ann Arbor-

based nonprofit organization 
that both manages and develops 
affordable housing units in the 
county.

According to Blake, there are 

currently 342 known homeless 
individuals 
in 
Washtenaw 

County, 
301 
of 
whom 
are 

unsheltered. 
Blake 
said 
138 

of those individuals reported 

having a serious mental illness 
and 70 reported problems with 
substance abuse, both of which 
are issues heavily associated 
with causing homelessness.

“People with mental illness are 

disproportionately affected by 
homelessness, so it is estimated 
that 26 percent of homeless

Preparations are in place to 

fill the seat of Councilmember 
Sabra Briere (D-Ward 1) after 
she steps down in December. 
After nine years in office, 
Briere announced her intention 
to resign last week.

Briere has been an Ann 

Arbor resident since 1973 and 
the 
Ward 
1 
representative 

for City Council since 2007, 
making her the longest-seated 
current council member. On 
Nov. 7, Briere published an 
online letter announcing her 
plans to resign. She stated in 
the letter that she is resigning 
to move with her husband to 
Santa Rosa, Calif. to be closer 
to their son.

Though Ann Arbor’s city 

charter states the council must 
appoint a replacement to fill 
Briere’s seat within 30 days 
of the vacancy, Briere pointed 
out in an interview there is no 
mention in the rules of how 
the council gets news of the 
vacancy or fills the vacancy, 
just that it must be filled. When 
Briere finalized her decision to

Following 
President-elect 

Donald Trump’s upset win 
last week, the University of 
Michigan campus has been 
filled 
with 
protests, 
vigils 

and 
rallies. 
However, 
on 

Thursday night, the Diag was 
host to an hour of rest as the 
musical group Love and Peace, 
affiliated with a new movement 
on campus by the same name, 
played 
a 
variety 
of 
blues 

and reggae songs promoting 
inclusion and equity.

Peace and Love began its 

performance in front of Hatcher 
Graduate Library with a slow, 
keyboard-heavy 
and 
lyrical 

tribute to peace during tense 
times. Lead singer Christopher 
McClendon, a Business senior, 
said to the audience of nearly 50 

students that they were there 
to remind University students 
that cohesion in the campus 
community was still possible 
amid a political firestorm.

“If we just take a little time 

to love one another, there is 
power to break every chain 
of violence that exists in this 
country,” McClendon said. “It’s 
time to unite under one concept 
of love. Clap your hands and 
show that we are united.”

As students began dancing 

around the block ‘M,’ LSA 
junior Kendall Lindsey said he 
came to watch the performance 
to support its mission, but 
wished it could spark tangible 
change at the University.

“In the wake of everything 

that’s happened, all of the hate 
right now on campus, it’s good to 
see the love spinning around,” 
Lindsey said. “But that’s not 
the end of it — it’s not just about 

peace and love. There need to 
be actual services implemented 
to make sure every student here 
feels welcome, feels like they 
matter.”

LSA juniors KeeAna Lane 

and Sydny Rivers said they 
attended 
the 
performance 

looking for a positive end to a 
taxing week at the University.

“The vibe here has been 

intense, but I can’t let it get to 
me,” Lane said. “I didn’t expect 
the singing. I didn’t know what 
to expect. But it’s a positive 
thing, and if anything is needed 
right now, this is it.”

Rivers 
echoed 
Lane’s 

sentiments, adding that events 
like this one had the potential 
to change minds in a positive 
way.

“Election week had a deep 

effect on me,” Rivers said. “But 
maybe it’s time to push on and 
work together, and maybe this 

is the beginning.”

As 
McClendon 
sang 

Stevie 
Wonder’s 
“Isn’t 

She Lovely” to a gathering 
crowd of students, Public 
Policy junior Nadine Jawad, 
co-founder of the Peace and 
Love movement and a senior 
policy adviser to Central 
Student 
Government, 

addressed the crowd.

Jawad said she wanted to 

magnify the voices of people 
who 
feel 
systematically 

oppressed amid prevailing 
political and racial tensions 
in the United States.

“My message is about 

retaliation,” Jawad said. “In 
the last week, we’ve all been 
pushed and tried in ways 
that are unimaginable. But 
when we fight back with love 
and peace, instead of anger 
and frustration, we send a 
message. I could spend five 
minutes talking about how 
an Uber driver cussed me out 
last week, but instead we’re 
going to focus on us. Because 
the people on the Diag right

this one that bring together 
different groups dedicated to 
sustainability.

“You get a bigger bang for your 

buck; everything kind of reinforces 
everything else,” she added.

“What we’re doing reinforces 

what 
Recycle 
Ann 
Arbor’s 

doing, which reinforces energy 
management, all of those kinds 
of things,” she said. “It’s a 
bigger message when we all 
come together to reach a bigger 
audience.”

However, 
LSA 
senior 
Liz 

Bedrick, a board member for the 
Student Sustainability Initative, 
voiced disappointment regarding 
the lack of a Q&A session, which 
was a part of the town hall in 
previous years. Bedrick also said 
she felt the event’s scope was 
narrower than she expected and 
focused on the efforts of only a 
few departments.

“I thought it could have been 

a little more comprehensive,” 
Bedrick said. “A lot of stakeholders 

weren’t accounted for here. They 
only had four people talk from 
three different offices, so I think 
they could have had a wider array 
of people.”

Nonetheless, she said she felt 

the representatives from these 
departments 
demonstrated 

a 
positive 
trajectory 
for 

sustainability on campus.

“But I think in terms of their 

goals they all seem to be on track, 
and I think a lot of the initiatives 
going on are really great,” she said.

Engineering 
senior 
Natalie 

Salton said she appreciated the 
format of the town hall event 
because it provided opportunities 
for the community to actively 
engage 
with 
the 
topic 
and 

interact with others involved in 
sustainability programs.

“If the University only put out 

reports, I think you’ll have a lot 
lower participation and awareness 
of what’s going on,” she said. “... 
You can still talk to people, see 
what things are available around 
campus by having interpersonal 
relationships. It’s a lot more 
effective at communicating stuff 
than throwing reports and fliers 
at people.”

move to California, she said she 
promptly began working with 
city officials to create a plan for 
filling her soon-to-be vacant 
spot, minimizing the amount of 
disruption that would ensue.

“In other situations in the 

past, people have moved and 
resigned but because I have full 
warning and I’m the kind of 
person I am, when I understood 
that my son was successful in 
purchasing the house and I had 
a basic idea of when I would 
move, I worked with the mayor 
and the city administrator and 
the city attorney to create a 
reasonable process proposal, 
and council then looked at that 
process proposal and improved 
it,” Briere said.

People interested in filling 

the vacancy have until 2 p.m. 
on Nov. 23 to complete an 
online application. On Nov. 28, 
the council will interview all 
applicants individually.

Briere said the administration 

committee, which is a subgroup 
of the council, is currently 
deciding on a series of interview 
questions to ask applicants, 
which will be made public by 
Nov. 23.

At the Dec. 5 council meeting, 

Briere will offer a resolution 
declaring 
her 
resignation, 

creating a vacancy and stepping 
away from the table to allow 
council members to discuss who 
should fill the seat.

Ward 
1 
resident 
Jeffrey 

Hayner, who ran for the City 
Council seat in 2013, said he is 
currently deciding if he will 

apply for the vacancy, but hopes 
the position will be filled by 
someone who represents the 
community voice.

“Sabra has done so much 

to 
promote 
community 

involvement and participation, 
so I really want to make sure 
that seat goes to whoever it 
is that can keep some of that 
going,” 
Hayner 
said. 
“It’s 

important.”

Hayner 
also 
said 
he 
is 

concerned that this position 
will be appointed rather than 
taken to a public vote, especially 
following 
the 
city’s 
recent 

vote to move to four-year term 
lengths.

“I haven’t read what the clerk 

has to say yet, but I followed some 
of it when they were discussing 
it,” Hayner said. “I don’t love it 
because appointments always 
lend themselves to abuse of the 
majority.”

Briere said she hopes the 

opportunity to apply for this 
position will attract a different 
pool of candidates than those 
who would run in an election 
against an incumbent.

“It is my hope that a number 

of people will apply who are 
supremely qualified, but whose 
names have never appeared on 
a ballot.”

violated 
or 
experiencing 

violence or incarceration for 
whatever reason,” Ridley said.

While noting it is important 

to acknowledge the harsh 
realities 
of 
living 
as 
a 

transgender person, Ridley 
said it is equally important 
to 
remind 
others 
why 

transgender women risk so 
much to express their gender 
identity in the first place.

“I really just want to find 

and look for and dig for those 

stories, not that they haven’t 
experienced marginalization, 
but 
this 
ever 
present 

human story of overcoming 
these 
obstacles 
and 
being 

triumphant and finding love 
and finding joy with other 
people and with themselves,” 
Ridley said.

Panelist 
Mari 
Brighe, 

Spectrum 
Center 
graduate 

communications coordinator, 
agreed that more positive 
stories 
of 
transgender 

experience 
should 
be 

shared. 
Brighe, 
whose 

articles discussing life as a 
transgender woman have been 
featured in publications like 

Vice, Mic and Bustle, said she 
shares her stories publicly 
despite receiving daily threats 
because she feels obligated 
to readers who relate to her 
experiences.

“Honestly, every time I get 

an email or a tweet or a message 
from someone who tells me 
that my work is important 
to them, is important to 
them for being safe or being 
included or feeling welcomed 
or feeling like their ideas and 
experiences were validated, 
that means everything in the 
world to me and outweighs a 
million threats,” Brighe said.

Mark Chung Kwan Fan, 

assistant 
director 
of 
the 

Spectrum 
Center, 
echoed 

Ridley’s sentiments and said 
he hoped the panel discussion 
helped 
individuals 
in 
the 

University and transgender 
community hear more positive 
stories 
about 
overcoming 

marginalization 
to 
find 

happiness.

“It’s really to share their 

experiences 
of 
not 
just 

marginalization 
but 
also 

success,” Chung Kwan Fan 
said. “Because even though you 
identify within an oppressed 
community so to speak, you 
do have opportunities to be 
successful as well.”

adults staying in a shelter live 
with a serious mental illness,” 
Blake said. “Part of why this 
number is so high is because 
folks 
with 
mental 
illness, 

especially 
severe 
persistent 

mental illness, even if they 
are able to get into housing, 
they usually require or would 
like some additional support, 
and there’s not a whole lot of 
permanent support in housing 
out there.”

Avalon Housing currently 

owns and operates 21 properties 
in Ann Arbor that serve both 
single adults as well as families. 
According to Blake, housing 
units 
on 
these 
properties 

currently house more than 400 
individuals. She emphasized 
that the nonprofit operates 
more as a support service rather 
than a landlord.

“There are a lot of public 

housing 
agencies 
nationally 

that are either starting to 
move themselves in offering 
permanent supportive housing 
or are partnering with groups 
like Avalon who are already 
doing it,” she said. “What all 
the research and studies show 
is that permanent supportive 
housing is what’s most effective 
in terms of keeping people 
safely housed.”

Blake 
also 
highlighted 

efforts individuals can make 
to 
become 
more 
informed 

about homelessness, attending 
City 
Council 
meetings 
to 

hear council and community 
members 
present 
their 

positions on the issue. She noted 
public hearings in the past 
have highlight mixed attitudes 
of citizens about proposals 
and developments related to 
affordable housing.

“What we see is sort of a mix of 

folks coming out,” she said. “We 
will see some folks who show 
up and say, ‘I’m so in support of 
there being affordable housing 

in Ann Arbor.’ Then we get folks 
coming out saying, ‘Not in my 
backyard. I don’t want folks who 
need affordable housing living 
by me; I don’t want folks with 
mental illness living near me.’ ”

In an interview with the 

Daily after the event, Blake 
elaborated, 
saying 
residents 

who oppose affordable housing 
project developments in their 
neighborhoods often support 
the idea in general.

She noted that, historically, 

City Council has been highly 
supportive 
of 
Avalon’s 
and 

similar organizations’ work.

LSA junior Carly Noah, a 

member of the CASC Student 
Board who organized the talk, 
said coming from a small, rural 
town, her first experiences 
with homelessness during her 
freshman year exposed her to 
issues of wealth disparities that 
are more prevalent in urban 
environments.

“It was during the winter, and 

I saw people wearing Canada 
Goose coats, and I thought 

there are so many people who 
are homeless, so I was really 
bothered by the discrepancy 
between the two,” she said.

In her remarks, Blake also 

highlighted the gaps in wealth 
that exist in Ann Arbor and 
Washtenaw County, noting that 
while the county is relatively 
wealthy, there are a number of 
individuals who are of lower 
socioeconomic status.

“We have a lot of privilege 

in this county, we have a lot of 
privilege associated with the 
‘U,’ and I don’t think a lot of 
people realize just how much 
inequality there is in Ann Arbor 
currently,” she said.

LSA 
freshman 
Paul 

Chamberlain said after the 
event that at the start, he didn’t 
understand the full scope of the 
issue and the work of advocacy 
organizations like Avalon.

“I felt like I wasn’t really 

aware of the extent of the 
problem, and I was encouraged 
by what people are doing to 
meet the problem,” he said.

the FDA’s new tobacco rule. 
Under this rule, the FDA 
regulates all tobacco products, 
including 
hookah 
and 

e-cigarettes, among others.

The 
ACA-sponsored 
day, 

called the Great American 
Smokeout, 
began 
in 
the 

1970s and takes place every 
year on the third Thursday 
of 
November. 
Smokers 
are 

encouraged to either make a 
plan to quit smoking or use the 
day to kick off their plan.

According 
to 
the 
ACA’s 

website, 40 million Americans 
smoke cigarettes, and tobacco 
is the largest preventable cause 
of health complications and 
death.

TCS 
Program 
Manager 

Alison Nix said “Quit For A 
Day” opens a window for TCS 
to promote its resources to 
people who may be interested 
in quitting smoking or who 
would simply like to experience 
what it would be like to quit for 
a day.

“We feel like we have a role 

to share information on this 
day not only from an education 
perspective 
around 
what’s 

going on in the field, but also 
to provide information and 
support to individuals,” she 
said.

Scheduling 
the 
various 

events to culminate on the 
same day as the Great American 
Smokeout, she added, helps 
TCS take part in a national 
conversation at a community 
level.

“It’s an opportunity for us 

to share information on a day 
that people are really keyed in 
to because it’s a historical event 
that’s been happening for many 
years,” she said. “By having it on 
the Great American Smokeout, 
it’s a day that we can focus in 
on and highlight the resources 
that we have available to help 
people do that.”

Public Health Prof. Cliff 

Douglas, who teaches classes 
in tobacco policy and serves as 
the vice president for tobacco 
control at the American Cancer 
Society, noted in an interview 
that 
about 
90 
percent 
of 

smokers start smoking by the 
age of 18, and 99 percent start 
by the age of 26.

As a result, Douglas said, 

efforts like “Quit for a Day” 
in a university setting can be 
very influential. He added that 
knowledge and awareness are 

critical in a college environment 
and among students.

“One 
critical 
focus, 
of 

course, is students,” he said. 
“You’ve got a fairly significant 
percentage of smokers who 
start during the college years, 
so it’s a key transition time 
when a college student who 
smokes will either decide to 
quit or will continue smoking 
for many years to come and 
suffer the consequences. Or, 
in some cases, it determines 
whether a student starts to 
smoke.”

TCS efforts are slated to 

continue throughout the month 
— through the end of November, 
a wall in UMHS’s Towsley 
Center will continue to feature 
stories from people who used 
TCS to help them quit smoking 
as well as information about 
other methods to help quit.

now can all work to ensure that 
tomorrow is better than today 
and two days from now are

She told the crowd that the 

shock of increasingly angry 
and 
discriminatory 
rhetoric 

on campus following Trump’s 
election inspired the creation of 

an all-inclusive movement.

“We 
believe 
that 
people 

have a right to be angry and 
they have a right to be scared,” 
Jawad 
continued. 
“But 
we 

want to counteract all of that 
because if we come together as a 
community it can rise us up. It’s 
been a really frustrating week. 
My Uber driver cussed at me 
when I dropped a food crumb in 
his car. I told him, ‘Thank you 
and have a nice day,’ and that’s 
the model of our movement.”

McClendon 
reminded 
the 

group that love and peace can 
prevail as long as they allow it 
to.

“I don’t care what weapon 

may fall against me,” McClendon 
said. “I will prosper because 
I believe in peace. I love that 
hijab Nadine wears. I love the 
timbs on my feet and my nappy 
hair. I love all of you, whether 
you’re black or white or blue or 
green or yellow or anything in 
between.” 

SPEAKOUT

The University of Michigan 

Bicentennial Office hosted a 
Diag Day Thursday afternoon 
to 
spread 
information 

about 
the 
activities 
and 

events planned for the 2017 
bicentennial 
year. 
Two 

organizers — the Michigan 
Bicentennial 
Archive 
and 

the 
Bicentennial 
Student 

Advisory Committee — set 
up two booths in the center 
of the Diag with the goal 
of increasing interest and 
student involvement in the 
University’s 
bicentennial 

year.

M-BARC 
focused 
on 

disseminating 
information 

about a time capsule they are 
developing for the occasion. 
Designed 
by 
University 

engineers, it will be launched 
into space this summer to 
orbit for 100 years and will 
include information stored in 
the form of interviews, audio 
and video files and DNA.

On 
Thursday, 
LSA 

senior 
Paul 
Stefanski, 
a 

representative from M-BARC, 

signed up interested students 
to be interviewed for the 
project. 
M-BARC 
plans 

to conduct 1,000 of these 
interviews in total, which 
won’t be heard until the 
capsule is brought down from 
space by the class of 2117.

“No one has ever sent 

something into space for 100 
years before or even designed 
anything with that intention, 
especially since some of the 
information is being stored in 
DNA,” Stefanski said. “It will 
be an interesting experiment 
for scientific purposes as 
well. Our mission is to make 
a time capsule unlike any that 
has been made before.”

Nursing 
freshman 
Mary 

Kostesich was one of many 
students who signed up for an 
interview for the time capsule, 
and said she was excited to be 
involved in such a project.

“I’m really excited for the 

space 
capsule,” 
Kostesich 

said. “I think it’s so cool that 
this will be the first of its 
kind and is being created by 
University engineers.”

Members 
of 
the 

Bicentennial 
Student 

Advisory 
Committee 
also 

spoke to students in the next 
booth about the other 2017 
bicentennial events and how 
they can get involved. The 
University will be offering 
classes, open to students and 
the public, for both the winter 
and fall 2017 semesters about 
the history, effect and future 
of the institution.

Public 
Health 
student 

Peter DeJonge, a member 
of the Bicentennial Student 
Advisory 
Committee, 

said the committee is also 
encouraging 
other 
student 

organizations to get involved 
in the celebration.

“There are a lot of ways 

for your student club to get 
involved,” DeJonge said. “If 
they want to incorporate a 
bicentennial theme they can 
talk to us or they can talk to 
the bicentennial committee, 
and they can integrate that 
into their own activities.

The 
bicentennial 
year 

will also see campus visits 
from several notable alumni, 
seasonal festivals and other 
University-sponsored events.

O

ne of my favorite quotes 
comes from the poet 
Tyler 
Knott 
Gregson: 

“Out of the darkness, we can 
make light.” In so few words, he 
conveys a very simple 
concept: There is always 
a light at the end of the 
tunnel, but only if we 
seek it. Silver linings do 
not come freely.

It can be difficult, I 

know, to believe there 
will be light in the wake 
of 
this 
presidential 

election. After all, as 
I went to sleep early 
Wednesday 
morning 

with Donald Trump just shy of 
270 electoral votes, I thought the 
world was going to end. Being 
quite the dramatist, I literally 
thought the world would implode 
or explode sooner than America 
would elect Trump into the 
highest office of the country.

But, as it always does, day 

came, and the world didn’t end. 
Nov. 9, 2016, was just another day, 
albeit an extremely gloomy one. 
A depression seemed to settle 
over campus as students trudged 
to and from class (or skipped 
class entirely) with morose faces 
and empty eyes, wondering how, 
how, how could this possibly be 
reality? But don’t mistake this 
depression as defeat. No, we were 
merely taking our rightful time to 
mourn. And when we were done, 
when the shock had settled and 
our hearts finished sinking, we 
found strength and solidarity in 
each other.

That is our silver lining.
Of course, it’s disheartening 

to know that the glass ceiling 
is still very much intact, that 
America will seemingly elect 
anyone, no political experience 
required, into office as long as 
they’re not a woman. My heart 
breaks for my Muslim and 
Mexican peers who suddenly 
have to fear for their lives, and 
I’m angry that the results of the 
election have emboldened closet 
racists to threaten and harass 
people of color, even here in Ann 
Arbor. I’m sickened by the acts of 
hate and intimidation expressed 
on campus. I’m scared that all 
the social progress made in the 

last eight years on behalf of the 
LGBTQ 
community, 
women 

and minority groups will be 
eradicated. 
I’m 
disappointed 

that rape culture is so real that 

half of the country 
is willing to allow 
a man who brags 
about 
sexual 

assault to be the 
face of the country. 
I’m frightened that, 
with a Republican-
controlled 
House 

and Senate, no one 
will stop our future 
president 
from 

building 
a 
wall, 

defunding Planned Parenthood, 
deporting 
undocumented 

immigrants (many of whom 
grew up in America and know 
no other country as home) and 
so much more.

Yes, 
I 
am 
disheartened, 

angry, heartbroken, sickened, 
scared, 
disappointed 
and 

frightened, as many of us are. 
But that’s the important part — 
we are not alone.

Walking across the Diag and 

seeing messages of acceptance 
and kindness scrawled across 
the red brick in the wake of 
the election, it’s clear that this 
university is devoted to diversity, 
safety and compassion in such 
a polarizing time. The swirling 
chalk around my feet — with 
messages such as “You belong 
here” and “Love trumps hate” 
— moved me to tears. The vigil 
on the Diag the night after the 
election was haunting, as candles 
illuminated the faces of hundreds 
of students who showed up to 
support marginalized peers and 
mourn together.

Students 
again 
stood 
in 

solidarity with those who felt 
endangered after the election. 
Music, Theatre & Dance senior 
James Ross Kilmeade organized 
a protest against intimidation 
Saturday night after a student 
was threatened and forced to 
take off her hijab. Other students 
have volunteered on Facebook 
to walk those who feel unsafe 
home at night.

Despite this horrible incident, 

it is heartening to see that, for 
every act of hate this election 

has procured, this university 
and its students respond in 
love. I may be disappointed in 
Michigan as a state for voting 
the way it did, but I couldn’t be 
more proud of the University of 
Michigan for striving to make 
the campus welcoming and 
safe for everyone. It would be 
easy to sit back and say, “We’re 
screwed,” but the overwhelming 
action stemming from pure 
passion shows we will not take 
this loss lying down. In the 
midst of this darkness, the love 
and compassion of students is 
the light we need.

As we enter this trying time 

together, we must preserve our 
small and tentative light, harvest 
it and let it grow with love. In 
other words, we cannot stop. We 
must continue to fight together 
against hate, racism, xenophobia, 
sexism and homophobia with 
peace and unity. We must 
continue to protect our Black, 
Mexican, Muslim, LGBTQ and 
female peers from those who 
feel emboldened to be awful. 
We must continue to make our 
voices heard. We must make this 
loss worth something. We must 
make something good out of it.

And when the going gets 

tough, we must catch the rare 
silver linings. Though she did not 
win the electoral vote, Hillary 
Clinton won the popular vote, 
which shows that a majority of 
this country doesn’t support 
Trump’s message. This election, 
despite its result, has sparked 
important 
conversations 
on 

race, 
immigration, 
women’s 

rights 
and 
so 
much 
more. 

The American Civil Liberties 
Union and Planned Parenthood 
have received an outpouring 
of support and donations in 
the days since the election. A 
map of the Electoral College 
if just millennials voted is 
overwhelmingly 
blue. 
We 

students, in all our anger, 
passion, generosity and empathy 
— we are the future. And in these 
dark times, we must be the light.

Our silver lining

FROM THE DAILY

Response to #NotMyCampus

T 

his week on campus, students continued to react to both the 
presidential election results and the multiple hate crimes that 
have occured in Ann Arbor since, culminating Wednesday when 

nearly 1,000 students joined Rev. Jesse Jackson in a walkout protest 
against racism and violence. However, one reaction stood out because of 
its different focus. Earlier this week, students and others began circulating 
a #NotMyCampus petition condemning and commenting on both recent 
protests and a Nov. 9 vigil on the Diag in response to the election results. 
Appended to the petition were personal statements by community 
members expressing feelings of misrepresentation by the administration 
and exclusion from their community for their conservative viewpoints. 
While it’s vital that campus is a space where all feel comfortable engaging 
in thoughtful dialogue about their political leanings, we feel this petition 
misunderstands the fact that one cannot equate these feelings of exclusion 
to fearing for the safety of their life, a salient concern for students in light 
of recent indicents of violence on this campus. 

We 
recognize 
that 
the 

roughly 10 percent of students 
who 
voted 
for 
President-

elect 
Donald 
Trump 
feel 

excluded, and these feelings are 
legitimate. Research suggests 
that the kind of polarized 
rhetoric 
surrounding 
this 

election could have adverse 
effects on the social progress 
that occurs when we have 
conversations with those who 
hold different views than our 
own. It must be understood that 
many students who voted this 
way do not feel aligned with 
Trump’s offensive ideology and 
voted for him for other reasons. 
But we must also emphasize 
why the majority of our campus 
community is frustrated by 
the students who signed the 
#NotMyCampus petition. We 
fear the petition signers may 
not understand how those who 
are fearful for their physical 
safety see a vote for Trump 
as a vote for racism and other 
discriminatory ideas to reign 
in our world. It is impossible to 
divorce the idea of Trump from 
the offensive rhetoric and racist 
beliefs his campaign promoted, 
legitimized 
and 
normalized. 

It 
is 
concerning 
that 
the 

students who voted for Trump 
— regardless of whether they 
personally support such rhetoric 
— could put aside his alarmingly 
exclusionary 
and 
offensive 

claims and promises, seemingly 
not understanding how this kind 
of speech can harm our country 
and our campus.

The statement under most 

scrutiny by the petition is 
from 
a 
speech 
University 

President Mark Schlissel gave 
at the Nov. 9 vigil, in which he 
stated, “Ninety percent of you 
rejected the kind of hate and the 
fractiousness and the longing for 
some kind of idealized version 
of a non-existent yesterday 
that was expressed during the 
campaign.” With these remarks, 
Schlissel made two parallels: 
A vote for a candidate other 
than Trump is a vote against 
hate, and by extension, a vote 
for Trump is a vote for hate. 
Though 
somewhat 
indirect, 

this second parallel — along 
with administrators’ extensive 
outreach to students both over 
email and through presence 
at protests — understandably 
made many students who voted 
for Trump feel ostracized. We 
feel that Schlissel’s quote was 
not attempting to condemn 
students who voted for Trump, 
but rather prioritizing students 
who are grieving, suffering or 
fearing for their livelihood. 
But we also believe Schlissel 
should and could represent 
and support the 90 percent of 
students who voted against 
Trump without rejecting the 
10 percent of students who did 
by affirming student safety 
and concerns without wading 
into ideology. It is vital that 
Schlissel understands this and 
urges our community to come 
together instead of deepening 
the divide. 

We do want to acknowledge 

the proactive approach Schlissel 
and other administrators have 
taken. In the recent past, from 
the #BBUM movement to the 
protests against racist posters 
to the creation of this year’s 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
Plan, administrators have been 
criticized by students for not 
engaging with students enough 
and 
not 
providing 
genuine 

support 
when 
students 
are 

both frustrated and hurting. 
This week, Schlissel and many 
administrators and staff have 
been present and supportive. 
In comparison to the University 
administration’s past responses 
to 
students’ 
concerns 
on 

campus, Schlissel and other 
administrators’ 
responses 

to hateful rhetoric should be 
commended. 

Everyone in our University 

community must be careful 
not to denounce conservative 
or 
Republican 
ideology 

and 
increase 
the 
harmful 

polarization that has made 
Trump 
the 
president-elect. 

Though the 10 percent’s feelings 
of exclusion should be heard, 
these same students must, in 
turn, hear and understand why 
marginalized 
communities 

and their allies feel their 
votes supporting Trump are 
votes supporting racism. Only 
when both sides have listened 
and heard this can we begin to 
move forward toward a more 
productive, safe and united 
campus.

Don’t let BDS divide us

ALONA HENIG | OP-ED

M

y parents were born 
and raised in Israel, 
and lived there until 

they were 28 years old. They’re 
my only family members who 
don’t currently live in Israel, so 
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict 
is very near and dear to my 
heart. Human rights have also 
always been important to me. 
Last year, I met two Palestinian 
refugees around my age, and 
they welcomed me into their 
home. They offered me tea and 
cookies and showed me love, 
despite coming from a country 
whose military evicted them 
from their homes. At that point 
I knew I had to do something.

It’s incredible what three 

letters can do to a student 
body. As soon as “BDS: Boycott, 
Divest, Sanctions” is heard, we 
shut down — we pick a side. 
Some consider it a divisive 
movement, but I don’t believe 
the resolution’s intention is to 
divide us. I genuinely believe 
the Palestinian students and 
authors 
of 
this 
resolution 

are not solely at fault for this 
division — we all are.

It’s easy to stand divided, 

to surround ourselves with 
comfortable conversation and 
put down the other side. And at 
times, I do it, too. I sometimes 
shut down and tell myself BDS 
isn’t constructive and will 
drive us farther from peace. 
If we reject this proposal, 
however, then we must find an 
alternative, one that will also 
work to end the occupation of 
the West Bank and Gaza Strip 
and one that will ensure self-
determination for both Israelis 
and Palestinians. We must find 
ways to strive for peace and 
collaboration in this effort.

My 
goal, 
along 
with 
J 

Street U’s goal, is to end the 

occupation in Gaza and the 
West Bank. We strive to find 
a two-state solution — a way 
for both peoples to obtain 
and maintain sovereignty and 
liberty from one another, with 
neither side having power over 
the other, which is so clearly 
not the case right now.

The BDS movement is scary 

because it’s seen as a threat to 
Israel’s security and, globally, 
doesn’t 
recognize 
Israel’s 

right to exist as a Jewish and 
democratic state. I understand 
this is a high priority for many 
students and faculty members at 
this University. When we hear 
BDS, we, specifically Jews 
on campus, are concerned 
Israel is in danger. This 
fear is valid — it comes 
from a genuine place, but 
that fear cannot overpower 
the 
legitimate 
suffering 

taking place throughout the 
occupied territories.

That being said, economic 

pressure is an important part 
of creating change, so I’d like 
to propose an alternative. We, 
as a campus, need to fund 
peace 
projects. 
There 
are 

numerous 
organizations 
in 

the United States, Israel and 
Palestine 
working 
toward 

peace, such as Hand in Hand, 
B’Tselem, The Third Narrative 
and OneVoice. These are really 
incredible 
organizations 

working on the ground to bring 
people together and end the 
violence and hatred evident in 
this conflict.

Avoiding 
one 
another 
and 

working solely to shut one side 
down rather than hearing what 
they have to say will not bring us 
closer to peace. Just yesterday, 
Students Allied for Freedom and 
Equality hosted an event open 
to everyone to come and learn 
and ask questions and discuss. 
We, as members of the pro-Israel 
community, need to take it upon 
ourselves to attend those events.

Let me also add that we 

are all Wolverines here. As 
equal students on this campus, 
we all pay tuition, attend 
challenging classes and walk 
through the same Diag. CSG is 
a governmental body seeking 
to represent us all and it’s time 
to come together. If we, here in 
Ann Arbor, can’t work together 
and challenge ourselves to 
listen to one another, what 
does that say for any hope 
across countries?

We have a responsibility to 

mobilize and work together. 
We must include members 
of all perspectives in the 
conversation. We have to put 
ourselves 
in 
conversations 

that may hurt and frustrate 
us to ultimately come out 
with a better understanding. 
One campus’s BDS decision, 
whether 
approved 
or 
not, 

doesn’t 
end 
the 
atrocities 

happening overseas. I call on 
us to carry this momentum into 
tomorrow and the upcoming 
weeks, months and even years. 
Work to change your lens, to 
undo your bias. Don’t let this 
be an issue we care about today 
but forget about tomorrow.

The 
issue 
is 
incredibly 

controversial, 
but 
that 
is 

good — it brings passion. 
I invite you to join us at J 
Street meetings to learn and 
grow together. I encourage 
you to attend and listen to 
SAFE presentations as well 
as pro-Israel events. We are 
on such an incredible campus 
with so many opportunities to 
challenge ourselves available 
to us, so let’s use them. These 
issues are hard and I’m sorry 
for the hurt they cause, but if 
we want to see change, it has 
to start with us.

Look — “Red Oaks” is, as art 

goes, pretty inessential. It’s not 
a subversion of the ’80s movie 
archetype, nor is it 
an homage, either; 
it is almost literally 
an 
’80s 
movie, 

only extended into 
a 10-episode TV 
show.

In its first season, 

which aired last 
year, “Red Oaks” 
went out of its way 
to 
establish 
just 

how committed to 
its milieu it was. Of 
course it was set in a country club 
full of white people in suburban 
New Jersey. Of course the best 
friend is a stoner named Wheeler 
(Oliver Cooper, “Project X”). Of 
course the primary love interest 
is both the boss’s daughter and a 
doppelganger for Ally Sheedy in 
“The Breakfast Club.” Of course 
our protagonist doesn’t want to be 
a CPA like his dad, but a filmmaker 
instead.

The new season begins with 

the 
requisite 
premiere 
in 
a 

foreign country: David (Craig 
Roberts, “The Fundamentals of 
Caring”), now enrolled in a nearby 
community college after dropping 
out of New York University, visits 
Skye (Alexandra Socha, “Royal 
Pains”) in Paris, and the two of 
them are having a wonderfully 
romantic and artfully shot vacation 
until Getty (Paul Reiser, “The Paul 
Reiser Show”) — Skye’s father and 
David’s previous employer at the 

titular country club — surprises the 
two of them.

The crux of the episode is 

this awkward tension between 
David and Getty, but the standard 
“overbearing father” plot tropes 

eventually give way 
to the thematic well 
“Red Oaks” is, and 
has always been, 
more 
concerned 

with dipping into: 
namely, 
David’s 

inability to grow up.

And while the 

series 
eventually 

returns 
to 
its 

status quo — “Red 
Oaks” as a concept 
is 
inherently 

incongruent if it’s not summertime 
at the country club, and so by the 
second episode, it’s May 1986 and 
David’s back to work — the show 
seems incapable of asking more 
searching questions. What does 
it mean to become an adult? How 
does one follow one’s passions?

These issues are constantly 

addressed (albeit through the prism 
of the white suburban experience), 
but they’re just as easily denied any 
pointed analysis. And while new 
plotlines are inevitably planted 
— Getty’s ongoing legal troubles, 
David’s ex-girlfriend’s impending 
marriage to perhaps the most 
persistently 
loathsome 
and 

irritating character on television 
— “Red Oaks” is all too eager to 
return to its comfort zone, both 
temporally and thematically.

But perhaps it’s unfair to 

critique this show for complacency. 
The John Hughes movies that 
“Red Oaks” takes its cues from are, 

after all, more or less built on the 
foundation of mood over depth. 
The coming-of-age teen comedy 
isn’t always the most probing, but 
it’s often the one that sticks around 
longer in the heart. It’s a pastiche 
of tropes, sure, but those tropes are 
eminently pleasurable. “Red Oaks” 
seems like the product of some sort 
of Amazon computer algorithm 
that parses data from “Fast Times 
at Ridgemont High,” “St. Elmo’s 
Fire” and “Say Anything…” and 
then spits out an ’80s teen movie, 
plotlines expanded and stretched 
into the capacity of 10 episodes. 
This doesn’t make it any less 
enjoyable to watch.

The production values, as is 

characteristic of period shows on 
streaming services, are noticeably 
high, and while the cast, save for 
Ennis Esmer (“Blindspot”) and 
Reiser, isn’t particularly great, the 
actors are at least watchable. Each 
character is little more than a tired 
archetype, of course, from the 
thinly sketched female characters 
down to the old, white Reagan 
acolytes that populate the country 
club.

But, for better or worse, “Red 

Oaks” is surprisingly empathetic 
toward all of its characters. It’s 
unbearably cheesy at times, but 
it successfully conjures an era in 
which being a trader on Wall Street 
was an ideal to aspire to, but being 
into Eric Rohmer and Francois 
Truffaut was edgy and interesting. 
The issue is in the show’s triviality. 
It is — for lack of a better term 
— a guilty pleasure, a series 
that offers nothing more than 
inconsequential, decent escapism, 
and is content to do so.

Amazon’s ‘Red Oaks’ an entertaining 
but inessential ’80s movie rip-off

Season 2 of the escapist guilty pleasure emits a trivial kind of nostalgia

MUSIC AND GENDER

About a month ago, I attended 

a small show in Pontiac with a 
fellow punk-witch music writer. 
Let’s call her Lemina. The Garden, 
Heyrocco and So Pitted lured 
Lemina and me into the Pike Room 
in downtown Pontiac; they’re just 
the kind of grungy, off-kilter bands 
we crave. The night was rainy and 
chilly, the roads slick and shining. 
It was less than ideal. But the 
anxiety and uncertainty brought 
on by the weather was forgotten 
once we entered the cozy venue.

Upon arrival, a narrow flight of 

stairs led us up to the Pike Room, 
where a smattering of flannel-
wearing, 
mosh-pitting 
fans 

patiently waited. We milled about 
the crowd, the room not much 
bigger than a classroom. The 
audience was talkative, and we 
quickly made friends among our 
fellow fans — music can do that, 
you know.

One newfound acquaintance, 

let’s call her Alex, accompanied 
us to the bathroom, making light 
conversation. And then, you know 
the drill: Women’s bathrooms 
are a cesspool of compliments 
and camaraderie. Amid this fog, 
we made the acquaintance of 
another woman, seemingly a fan. 
She was tall and well built, with 
bobbed grey hair and a killer fur 
coat. After a few passing words, 
she exited with more grace than 
I thought ever possible in a dingy 
bar restroom.

Alex then took this opportunity 

to lean into us and breathlessly 
state, “I think she’s dating one of 
the boys in The Garden, I saw her 
with the bands earlier.” The awe 

was evident in her eyes. Having 
no real reason to doubt her, I 
nodded my head in agreement, not 
thinking much of the seemingly 
innocuous comment.

Soon after, our motley trio 

parted ways and Lemina and I 
returned to the crowd, watching 
and waiting. We watched as 
Heyrocco weaved in and out of 
the audience, setting up their 
equipment on the small stage. We 
watched as they played, shirtless, 
sweaty and drinking, and again as 
they dismantled.

The next band, So Pitted, then 

took the stage. There, gripping 
her guitar, was the girl from 
the bathroom — the supposed 
girlfriend. She wore round, black 
sunglasses and stared sternly 
ahead. So Pitted began to play 
and there she remained, plucking 
deliberately at her guitar; the 
extent of her her fingers and a 
slight sway of her hips or a nod of 
her head. She was raw and rad as 
hell.

As the evening spun forward 

and I was engulfed in the oddity 
that is The Garden, there was a 
nagging discomfort that wouldn’t 
leave me. It was that comment, that 
assumption made by Alex in the 
bathroom — the one that I didn’t 
give a second thought to at the 
time of its oration. A woman seen 
with the band is automatically a 
girlfriend or a groupie, a tagalong 
to the real musicians.

The longer I thought about 

it, I couldn’t believe I hadn’t 
immediately 
seen 
such 
an 

utterance as problematic. I’m 
a feminist, damnit. The more 
I thought about it, the more I 
realized how deeply engrained 
and pernicious this kind of 

sentiment is — especially in the 
realms of rock, punk and grunge.

This is nothing new. The role 

of women as accessories to male 
rockers has existed almost as 
long as the genre itself. Nearly 
all sub-rock genres — punk, pop, 
psychedelic, etc. — all share the 
thread of male-fronted or male-
dominated ensembles. Even when 
early punks like the New York 
Dolls subverted gender roles, 
dressing up in women’s clothing 
and heavy makeup, they did so 
without actually letting women 
into the scene. The music was too 
hard, too angry for women to pull 
off.

But, thankfully, women have 

not sat idly by. We have taken 
action, mobilized against this 
musical structure that tries to 
limit us. I think about Pussy Riot, 
and their status as one of the most 
overtly (and successfully) political 
bands — male or female. Or of 
groups like Sleater-Kinney, The 
Raincoats or Bratmobile. Even 
musicians that don’t fall under 
the rock umbrella continually and 
boldly do what they’re told they 
can’t. 

As grateful as we are for these 

talents, we shouldn’t leave all 
the legwork to them. We — the 
fans, 
aficionados, 
journalists, 

people — can help to break down 
these 
structures. 
Next 
time 

you encounter an Alex-esque 
comment, 
immediately 
think 

critically. Don’t wait for it to sink 
down and settle in you for you 
to realize the meaning behind 
the words, like I did. Engage in 
discourse. Support your local, 
national and extraterrestrial girl 
groups. Slowly but surely, it will 
make all the difference.

TV REVIEW
COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW

What happens when Sesame 

Street grows up? I mean like really 
grows up — like when you are 
all of a sudden a 
young unemployed 
puppet thrust into 
the 
cruel, 
cruel 

world of awkward 
sexual encounters, 
racism and internet 
porn? (With little 
more than a B.A. 
in 
English 
and 

relentless waves of 
anxiety about the 
future.) MUSKET’s 
“Avenue Q” seeks 
to explore these 
tribulations 
with candor and 
lightheartedness.

Both 
director 

Matt 
Kunkel, 
a 

senior in the School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance, and actor Josh 
Knoller, an LSA freshman, spoke 
of the production as something 
of a salve in a time of nationwide 
distress following the presidential 
election.

“With 
the 
whole 
political 

climate the way it’s been, we need ... 
to kind of have an escape from real 
life,” Kunkel said. He added that 
the theater is unique in bringing 
people together, with people from 
different walks of life all sharing a 
focus and space that allows them 
to enter into a different world.

And the world of “Avenue Q” 

is surreal. The show, a brainchild 
of Robert Lopez and University 
of Michigan alum Jeff Marx, 
premiered on Broadway in 2003 
and has since won multiple Tony 
awards. It has also continued to 
run Off-Broadway. The musical 
involves a cast of hand puppets, 

each 
controlled 

by actors who are 
visible on stage but 
seem to fade into 
the background as 
the plot progresses.

Although 

puppetry is so often 
relegated 
to 
the 

likes of childhood 
innocence, “Avenue 
Q” is anything but 
pure — showcasing 
musical 
numbers 

such 
as 
“The 

Internet 
is 
for 

Porn” and muddy 
discussions 
of 

topics like religion 
and financial strife, 

all played out through colorful 
puppets akin to the ones who 
taught you how to count or not to 
eat too many cookies. The puppets 
allow the cast to discuss heavier 
topics or take certain risks that 
they might not be able to take if the 
whole production were solely live 
action.

The MUSKET cast worked 

with Rick Lyon, one of the original 
puppeteers of “Avenue Q,” on 
perfecting their technique to 
give the puppets a lifelike quality, 
essentially, what allows the human 
behind the puppet to fall away 
from the narrative.

Due to the adult subject matter 

and “full puppet nudity,” Kunkel 
noted that the puppetry allows the 
script and music to take more risks 
in the content they discuss.

“If it were just two humans 

talking on stage like that, it may 
be considered too inappropriate or 
too risqué,” he said. 

Knoller, 
who 
plays 
Nicky, 

referenced comedians such as 
John Oliver and Trevor Noah, 
who use satire to shine light on 
the tense sociopolitical moment to 
explain the play.

“A lot of the most poignant 

rhetoric for people who are really 
upset is from things like that, 
somewhat raunchy but to the 
point commentary,” he said. He 
suggested that “Avenue Q” was in a 
similar movement, something that 
amid a funny and light exterior is 
an astute commentary that toes 
the line between hyperbole and 
truth.

Both Knoller and Kunkel noted 

that the script was especially 
poignant for a millennial audience, 
as it focuses on Princeton, a recent 
grad searching for a job, a home 
and above all of that, a “purpose.” 
In this vein, Kunkel highlighted 
nuggets of wisdom from the show, 
reassuring his audience, as the 
“Avenue Q” script says, “It’s okay 
not to know. It’s okay to not have 
everything figured out right away.”

Additionally, he tacked on a 

lyric from the end of the show that 
seeks to be a salve to the pain, fear 
and uncertainty present within 
the hearts of many.

“ ‘Everything in life is only for 

now.’ ”

MUSKET’s ‘Avenue Q’ 
to play at Power Center

Musical production explores the adventures of grown-up muppets

I consider myself to be patient 

and compassionate, especially 
with the elderly. When I see a 
crusty Buick cruising at 50 mph 
on the highway, I don’t curse 
out the 80-year-old driver; I 
just pass them and go on my 
way, hoping that a semi truck 
doesn’t rear end them. When 
I’m 
grocery 
shopping 
and 

my cart gets stalled by a slow 
walking senior couple debating 
which off-brand cereal to buy, 
I smile and wait. I mean, this 
decision is difficult for everyone 
regardless of age — how could I 
be cruel enough to judge them 
for this?

However, when an elderly 

couple disrupts my movie going 
experience 
by 
chit-chatting 

about 
the 
most 
mundane, 

ridiculous things, all patience 
and compassion is lost. 

There is no excuse for talking 

during a movie. If you’re guilty 
of doing this, stop ruining 90 
minutes of other people’s lives 
and reevaluate your own.

Last May, my older brother 

Cam came home from New 
York to celebrate Memorial Day 
with the family. The weekend 
was filled with Stewart-family 
rituals, 
like 
(vegetarian-

friendly) backyard barbecues 
and late night conversations 
with 
him 
pretending 
like 

we know what’s best for our 
parents — this year’s theme was 
why they need to get a new dog.

That Saturday, we followed 

another 
Stewart 
holiday 

weekend tradition and went 
to see a movie. Our happy 

Midwestern family story hit its 
first and only roadblock here.

We were decided on “The 

Lobster.” We were seated and 
comfortable in the theater, and 
the previews starting. Honestly, 
there is nothing wrong with 
talking during the previews. 
If you really care about a 
movie trailer, just search it on 
YouTube. So, when I heard loud 
mumbling behind me, at this 
point, all was well.

Once the movie started, the 

incessant 
mumbling 
didn’t 

end. I turned back, giving 
a piercing stare, to realize 
that the perpetrators were a 
happy elderly couple. This was 
heartbreaking and a real moral 
challenge. How could I ever 
chew these people out?

Any feelings of empathy and 

tolerance 
were 
thrown 
out 

the window after about three 
seconds. I was hoping they 
would catch on to my frequent 
aggressive stares followed by 
overly dramatic gestures of 
disappointment. 
They 
never 

even locked eyes with me. I’m 
guessing the problem was they 
couldn’t see much of anything 
in the darkness of the theater 
and were likely just trying to 
guide one another through the 
movie. For this, I felt kind of 
mean, but I stayed strong on my 
whole “no excuses” stand.

My brother and I turned 

to one another and loudly 
whispered things along the lines 
of “Wow, that is so (expletive) 
annoying.” This didn’t quite 
catch on.

After every time I shushed 

them 
or 
countered 
their 

rudeness with more rudeness, I 
felt this weird adrenaline rush 

while thinking, “Yeah, serves 
them right. I feel great.” It felt 
no different than the tingly 
feeling after a rollercoaster 
ride. This was probably not a 
great sign; maybe I should’ve 
eased up a bit. Nonetheless, I 
was sticking up for my seating 
section, the Robin Hood of the 
movie theater.

At this point, I probably 

sound like a spoiled college 
student with no empathy and 
a complete lack of awareness 
that people get old. I hate to 
throw my brother, the most 
compassionate 
and 
loving 

person I know, into the mix. 
Maybe that can be further proof 
that absolutely no one likes 
when people talk in a movie 
theater. If Cam gets upset, 
everyone gets upset.

In 
our 
divided 
cultural 

climate, we should all come 
together and agree that people 
who talk during a movie suck, 
like people who leave their 
disgusting mess behind at the 
dining hall table which forces 
you to do some miraculous 
balancing act carrying their 
plates on top of yours to end up 
with all of them shattered on the 
ground. We all hate these things. 
During tumultuous periods of 
partisanship and division, our 
petty grievances remind us that 
we’re not so different.

If you are someone who talks 

at the movie theater, it’s okay. 
You deserve a second chance. 
On behalf of everyone who is 
equally annoyed by this, you 
are forgiven. It is not like the 
perpetrators are consciously 
trying to ruin everyone else’s 
experience; it is incognizant 
selfishness.

See? They’re not talking, and they’re fine.

6A — Friday, November 18, 2016
Arts
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Three bodies, one boxing ring, 

several dimmed lights and an 
immeasurably ambitious project. 
Through 
dance, 

Zimbabwe-born 
choreographer 
Nora 
Chipaumire 

explores 
the 

stereotypes 
and 

realities of African 
masculinity using 
moving bodies as 
chimeras 
of 
her 

estranged 
father, 

in a Detroit exhibit 
this weekend.

Since graduating 

from the University 
of Zimbabwe and 
completing an M.A 
in Dance and M.F.A 
in 
Choreography 

& 
Performance 

from Mills College, 
Chipaumire 
has 
continued 

to 
create 
work 

deconstructing 
notions 
of 
the 

African male and female body, 
gender roles and the limits/
capabilities of art.

Her 
ongoing 
project 
and 

engagement with these questions 
is one the rest of the world, 
thankfully, although late to the 
game, has come to recognize.

“The 
Black 
Lives 
Matter 

movement emerged after I had 
already been in this process,” 
Chipaumire said in an interview. 
“I feel like the rest of the world 
caught up with what I was 
interested in. So then there’s 
the question, especially on an 
American landscape: Why is the 
black male so feared? Why is that 
black male such a threat?”

I asked how her commitment 

to exploring these questions 
precipitated.

“It was coming to America, 

and it being put to me that, ‘No, 
you’re not Black, you’re African.’ 
” she said. “There was a clear 

distinction between the two in 
the larger consciousness. Within 
the Black universe, there are 
much 
clearer 
understandings 

of who is who. And I think that 
kind of nuance is what the greater 
majority misses.”

Chipaumire’s 

work 
explores, 

beyond 
what 
it 

means to identify 
as 
one 
thing, 

what it means to 
identify as many. 
Her 
new 
piece, 

“Portrait of Myself 
as my Father,” is 
an extension of a 
2013 work, “The 
Rite 
of 
Spring,” 

which 
focused 

on 
the 
female 

African 
body 
as 

society’s figurative 
sacrificial lamb.

“I was curious 

what happens with 
the black African 
male 
body, 
and 

I found that the 
discovery 
of 
my 

father’s body kept 
it really personal 

and in a private arena. I don’t do 
work in which I’m not complicit, 
it has to be meaningful to me and 
teach me something” Chipaumire 
said. “Hence, trying to draw pull 
out, tease out and sculpt out this 
portrait of my father as this site 
of male African masculinity, 
black masculinity, as the site of 
sacrifice.”

Currently based in New York, 

Nora and the two male dancers 
who perform as her father, have 

been on tour for three months 
with the work, beginning in 
their home-base in Brooklyn, 
traveling to Europe and finishing 
with their finale in Detroit this 
weekend. The group has been met 
with standing ovations in nearly 
every city, an honor that is both 
recognized and reciprocated by 
the artists.

“There’s so much at stake for 

us three Black bodies in the space, 
especially given this timeframe 
that 
we’re 
in 
this 
week,” 

Chipaumire said. “And there’s 
just this thing where the audience 
stands up for you in recognition 
of the effort they have seen you 
unleash, so we bow to them in 
recognition of their work too.”

The week’s political climate 

was an inevitable corner in which 
our conversation could not avoid 
brushing. However, Nora and 
her dancer’s work challenge the 
understanding of many on this 
matter too: she doesn’t want to 
talk about her blackness, her 
femaleness, her belonging to the 
global South. The conversation is 
flipped.

“For all us that always expected 

that white is might, well, there it 
is. I no longer as a person from 
the global south have to concern 
myself with describing myself 
to you” she said. “This is really 
ripe, the study of otherness, that’s 
gone. We are not othered; we are 
people.”

So, with fierceness, conviction 

and 
passion, 
the 
project 

continues. While Nora plunges 
further into the arena of both 
personal and projected identities, 
she poses a challenge to many of 
the rest of us: “You need to tell us 
who you are,” she said. “I think 
that’s the beautiful unexpected 
consequence of this whole Nov. 
8 conundrum that we all find 
ourselves in.”

With 
such 
an 
alarmingly 

refreshing note of positivity, a 
testament to the power of art, we 
can all agree that’s a beautiful 
thing indeed. “Portrait of Myself 
as my Father” will offer more of 
the same.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

Some months ago, I ended 

up submerged in the depths 
of 
the 
Internet, 
blaring 

Taiwanese rap alone in my bed 
— the laptop was warm on my 
stomach, my fingers buzzing 
from their ferocious browsing. 
Had I ever listened to such a 
genre before? No, but I am glad 
I happened to stumble upon 
it. My ears were warm with 
the sensation of experiencing 
something new.

Having 
been 
in 
this 

explorative, albeit horizontal, 
position for an embarrassingly 
long amount of time, I had 
managed to traverse countless 
pages and consumed a bounty 
of music that I had never 
before known.

Basking 
in 
my 
newest 

findings, I realized the wealth 
of music that was out there 
waiting for me just beyond the 
sheen of my screen. Obviously, 
the Internet is a perfect way 
to listen to bands you already 
know, check out some that 
you’ve vaguely heard of, or 
find a few that are entirely 
new. With the expansion of 
streaming 
services, 
online 

releases and YouTube, music is 
more accessible than ever.

But what I experienced then 

was more than that — it was a 
titillating process of discovery, 
a hunt without an end. I was 
sucked down the rabbit hole.

We have all been there — 

some casual browsing that 
oh-so-easily slips into a full-
fledged 
information 
binge. 

You know, when you end up 
on Salem Witch Hunt sites for 
two hours and find yourself in 
a really peculiar headspace … 
or something. In my case, an 
innocent visit to spin.com led 
to some innocuous clicking on 
Wikipedia.

Several Wiki pages later, 

things got out of control and 
the power of the hyperlink 
dawned on me. You could 
be clicking forever, one idea 
leading endlessly to the next.

Sometimes 
this 
perusing 

is mindless, yielding nothing 
more than a brief distraction 
from other goings on. It’s 
easy to find yourself treading 
familiar ground or reliving 
previous favorites; you get 
caught up in the rush of 
nostalgia. Which is all well and 
good, but only for controlled 
blips of time. Listening to the 
same music forever would 

be like only ever eating your 
favorite 
childhood 
food: 

exciting initially, but soon 
nauseating.

But in special instances, 

magical sound bites are found 
— the kind of music that makes 
you think, This is it. Sure, there 
are plenty of duds out there. 
But for every few misses there 
is a glorious home run. You 
unearth something you never 
knew you needed.

Music can reveal things 

within yourself you didn’t 
know how to express, or even 
knew you wanted to express 
in the first place. That’s why 
stepping out of your comfort 
zone is so essential: it allows 
you to explore that little quiver 
hidden in your depths. It 
brings that desire to light.

The uncovering of these 

minute calls to action is one 
of 
the 
Internet’s 
greatest 

offerings. It allows a user 
to simultaneously find new 
information 
and 
facets 
of 

themself. 
These 
nuggets 

— a new favorite song, an 
inspirational new artist — are 
what make music so exciting, 
so transcendent. So let your 
freaky 
fingers 
work 
their 

magic. No wormhole too deep, 
no soundscape off limits.

One of the Web’s greatest offerings is the uncovering of new art

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW

The act of composing music 

is oftentimes both an act of 
discovery and of imitation. 
As a part of his 
or her process, 
a composer may 
sit 
down 
and 

explore 
new 

sound-worlds, 
or perhaps they 
may mimic the 
sonic 
events 

around 
them. 

Frequently, they 
may do both in 
the same piece. 
Once in a while, 
they may do so 
with the same 
sound.

This dualism is no paradox, 

and 
the 
result 
of 
such 

exploration and recollection 
can be exhilarating. Friday, 
one such example will be 
performed by the University 
of Michigan School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance Symphony 
Band — American composer 
Steven Mackey’s “Ohm.”

“This is my first [piece for 

a concert band],” Mackey said 
in an interview. “I’ve written 
a lot for orchestra. I realize 
it’s a very different animal — 
orchestra and concert band 
— so it was great. It was a 
challenge, but it was fun.”

Mackey is one of the most 

successful 
and 
respected 

composers 
active 
today, 

with 
works 
commissioned 

and performed by some of 
the leading ensembles in the 
nation. Well-known for his 
dramatic works — such as 
“Lonely Motel,” which was 
composed for the ensemble 
Eighth Blackbird and won a 
Grammy in 2011 — Mackey’s 
entry into the classical music 
world was non-traditional.

“I started music when I was 

about nine or ten,” he said. “But 
I started just playing guitar, 
and in my teen years played in 
bands. I was very serious about 
the electric guitar, but I didn’t 
read music until I was 20, and 
I hadn’t heard any classical 
music until I was 19. When 
I did hear classical music, I 
thought, ‘Wow, that’s what I 
should be doing,’ and that was 
in college, at the University of 
California Davis.”

Mackey went on to continue 

his education with a Masters 
degree from State University 
of New York at Stony Brook 
and a doctorate from Brandeis 
University, 
both 
in 
music 

composition. 
At 
present, 

Mackey teaches as a professor 

of 
music 
at 

Princeton 
University. 
Viewing 
music 

as a means to 
express 
the 

eccentricities of 
human existence, 
Mackey 
composes 
works that are 
both 
explicitly 

and 
implicitly 

dramatic.

“I 
think 

that I have a 

predilection that the reason 
I’ve done dramatic music is 
because I have an interest 
in making things happen,” 
Mackey 
said. 
“I’ve 
always 

found 
music 
to 
be 
this 

wonderful mystery. You know, 
how can varying frequencies 
at varying intervals of time 
mean anything at all, let alone 
convey all this drama and 
excitement and expression?

“And so, being in search 

of that — finding things that 
really feel like they happen, 
finding notes that change the 
destiny of a piece, the little 
turns of phrase that really 
make an impact — has been an 
interest in all my music. I think 
that’s led me to write dramatic 
music, music explicitly for 
the stage, but I think that’s a 
sort of driving force in all my 
music.”

Mackey’s 
piece 
for 

concert band, “Ohm,” while 
not 
explicitly 
dramatic 
in 

a 
theatrical 
sense, 
is 
no 

exception. 
Throughout, 
the 

drama is in some ways found in 
the contrasts within the music. 
Taking its germinal idea from 
two different sources, the 
music lives out a dichotomy.

“Like a lot of my music, 

it starts from an accidental 
discovery 
or 
experiment,” 

he said. “In this case I was 
thinking about all of these 
wonderful 
low 
instruments 

at my disposal, — you don’t 
usually 
have 
a 
contrabass 

clarinet and bass clarinet and 
contrabassoon in an orchestra. 
Meanwhile, I have a son … 
who is very interested in Star 
Wars 
and 
lightsabers 
that 

kind of stuff. The sound of the 
lightsaber, the vroomv, must 
have been in the back of my 
mind, because I ended up kind 
of creating that at the opening 
of the piece.”

Taking 
inspiration 
from 

the central sound in the piece, 
Mackey’s choice of title also 
reflects a duality, in addition 
to being a pun.

“It’s a very electric sound, 

so the title of the piece is a play 
on words between ohm, o-h-
m, which refers to electricity 
and that kind of lightsaber 
vroomv — and of course more 
metaphorically, 
electricity,” 

Mackey said.

“I think it’s a pretty exciting 

piece, it gets rockin’ as it 
goes, so there’s that kind of 
electricity. But also, a lot of the 
piece has this undercurrent 
of low pedal tones, one note 
just sort of, ‘om,’ like the 
meditation phrase o-m, so 
it’s a play between those two 
contradictory forces, the o-m 
of serenity and the o-h-m of 
electricity.”

In explaining his process 

of composing “Ohm,” Mackey 
drew attention to the fact 
that 
composition 
is 
very 

much an exploratory process, 
saying often, musical gestures 
and 
ideas 
are 
generated 

unintentionally.

“In this case, it’s not that I set 

out to make that sound, it’s that 
I was kind of fooling around 
with it — I call it ‘digging in the 
garden,’ when I’m beginning 
a piece,” Mackey said. “I 
don’t know what I’m doing or 
where I’m going or what I’m 
looking for sometimes, I’m 
just seeing what I can unearth. 
And I unearthed something 
that had that electric quality, 
that lightsaber quality, and I 
recognized it.

“I probably wouldn’t have 

been drawn to it when I 
discovered 
it, 
as 
strongly, 

had I not been living this 
fascination with my son. Yes 
I’m inspired by sounds around 
me, but partly I’m just inspired 
by what I discover when I’m 
sketching work.”

In addition to Mackey’s 

“Ohm,” 
— 
which 
was 

commissioned by a consortium 
of 
bands 
— 
Friday’s 

performance 
will 
feature 

compositions by Robert Beaser, 
Steven Stucky, Percy Grainger 
and a David John arrangement 
of Ginastera.

Wolverines bracing to 
host U.S. Development 
program in exhibition

From Jacob Trouba to Tyler 

Motte 
to 
Zach 
Werenski, 

there has been no shortage of 
talented players that Michigan 
coach 
Red 
Berenson 
has 

recruited from the USA Hockey 
National Team Development 
Program. It’s a relationship 
that has been beneficial for 
both sides, especially recently. 
This year’s Wolverine squad 
features eight former NTDP 
players, including five of the 
freshmen — forwards Will 
Lockwood, James Sanchez and 
Nick Pastujov and defensemen 
Luke Martin and Griffin Luce 
all played for the NTDP’s 
Under-18 team last year.

The two teams will meet 

Friday night at 
Yost Ice Arena 
in an exhibition 
game, a yearly 
tradition 
that 

has taken place 
for more than a 
decade. 

The 
NTDP 

moved to Ann 
Arbor in 1996, 
signing a lease 
to practice at 
the nearby Ice Cube. Players 
attend local high schools and 
live with billet families if they 
weren’t from the area.

But according to Berenson, 

the proximity between both 
programs 
hasn’t 
provided 

much of a recruiting advantage 
over the years. He has recruited 
players he would’ve gone after 
even if they weren’t part of the 
NTDP — recruits who were 
either from Michigan or the 
surrounding area, or some who 
already had ties to the program 
(like Sanchez, who grew up 
rooting for the team). Most of 
the time, Michigan has already 
received verbal commitments 
from NTDP players before they 
even join the program.

“We’ve recruited kids from 

that program, but when you look 
at the rules that we’re under as 
coaches, we can’t see them play 
any more than the coaches from 
Wisconsin 
or 

North 
Dakota 

can,” 
Berenson 

said. “We can 
only go to so 
many 
games 

each year. You’d 
think we have a 
big 
advantage, 

but 
we 
found 

out early in the 
process we don’t.

“For a lot of 

kids, it’s changed their lives, 
(and) it’s given them a great 
opportunity. We’re just one of 
the many schools that benefit 
from the program.”

Added Pastujov: “I don’t 

think it made a huge difference 
(in my commitment), but I think 
it helped just being close. We 
got to go to a lot of the games 
(and) talk to the coaches.”

If anything, being so close to 

the NTDP allowed Michigan to 
continue building relationships 
with players already verbally 
committed. Recruits can take 
as many unofficial visits as 
they want, getting a taste of 
Ann Arbor at football or hockey 
games, while Wolverine coaches 
are able to keep in close contact.

This year’s NTDP under-

18 team features four players 
in the 2017-18 class who have 
committed 
to 
Michigan: 

goaltender 
Dylan 
St. 
Cyr, 

defenseman 
Quinn 
Hughes 

and forwards Josh Norris and 
Michael Pastujov — the younger 
brother of Nick. Norris and 
Pastujov signed their letters 
of intent earlier this week, 
officially joining the program, 
while Michigan still waits upon 
signatures from St. Cyr and 
Hughes.

Berenson had high praise 

for the two early signees, who 

are both expected to be taken 
within the first few rounds of 
the 2017 NHL Draft.

“I like (Norris),” Berenson 

said. 
“He’s 
a 
good-sized 

centerman. Good skater, good 
worker, good two-way player. 
I think he’ll come in and be a 
solid player right from the get-
go.

“Michael 
(Pastujov) 
is 
a 

little bit like Nick (Pastujov) 
in that he’s had some shoulder 
problems. Right now, he’s on 
the injured list, so we’re not 
going to see him tomorrow. But 
I think he’s going to bring skill 
to our team, and he’s a player 
that should be able to provide 
offense and become a real good 
Division I player.”

Added Nick Pastujov: “I really 

like (Michael’s) game. I think 

he’s 
definitely 

a smart player. 
He’s got a lot of 
skill, and he can 
definitely finish. 
So I think he 
brings a lot to 
the table, and 
I’m excited to 
play with him 
next year.”

Michigan’s 

continued 

recruiting 
presence 
within 

the NTDP signals that the ties 
between each program remain 
strong, even if the NTDP moved 
from Ann Arbor to Plymouth 
about a year ago. 

The 
NTDP 
has 
beaten 

Michigan in the past, and even 
though the Wolverines win 
most years, the competition 
is still intense between both 
sides — perhaps an effect of 
younger players trying to prove 
themselves to future teammates 
or opponents.

“The atmosphere (last year) 

was definitely cool,” Pastujov 
said. “We stuck with (Michigan) 
for two solid periods. The 
crowd was really into it ... It was 
a really physical and fast game. 
Third period (Michigan) kinda 
pulled away, and they ended up 
winning, but it was still a really 
fun game the whole time.

“It’s the first time you run 

into your future 
(teammates), 
and it’s kinda 
like 
a 
first 

impression 
— 
your 
first 

impression 
of 

them and their 
first impression 
of you on the 
ice as a player. 
It’s your first 
chance to prove 

a little bit about yourself.”

After 
splitting 
a 
series 

against No. 5 Boston University 
last weekend, Michigan has just 
three games left — including 
the exhibition — before the 
start of Big Ten play. And while 
tomorrow’s result won’t count 
in the record books, Berenson 
is 
hoping 
to 
see 
marked 

improvement from his squad.

“We have to play this game 

like we’re playing a Division 
I program,” Berenson said. 
“We have to take a step from 
(playing) 
Boston 
University 

and put it on the ice against this 
team. And the (NTDP) will do 
the same thing. They’ve played 
a lot of good programs. We’re 
just another game on their 
schedule, except we’re more of 
a home game. I think it’s a little 
special for them. All the billet 
families will come to the game 
and cheer for them, so there’ll 
be a mixed crowd here.

“I 
think 
we’ve 
got 
to 

capitalize on our chances when 
we get chances in the offensive 
zone, and I think we’ve got to 
be stingier defensively. It’s not 
just our goalies, but it’s our 
defensemen and our forward 
in our zone. We can’t give up 
unearned goals because of poor 
defensive zone play. We’ve got 
to be better without the puck.”

Wolverines’ Finn one race from history

Eighteen years have passed 

since Michigan last had an 
NCAA 
champion 
in 
cross 

country. Katie McGregor ran 
her way to victory in 1998, and 
on Saturday, Erin Finn will 
attempt to match her historic 
feat.

A two-time high school state 

champion, the West Bloomfield 
native was already a star runner 
before setting foot on campus.

Three years have passed 

since she first donned the the 
block ‘M’, but in that short time, 
Finn has ensured that her name 
will be long remembered in Ann 
Arbor. 

As a freshman, Finn propelled 

Michigan to 4th place in the 
2013 
NCAA 
Championship, 

a feat that earned her All-
American honors.

She followed that up in 

subsequent years by becoming 
the 
first 
Wolverine 
since 

McGregor 
to 
win 
back-to-

back Big Ten championships, 
winning 
three 
overall. 
She 

also is a three-time Big Ten 
Athlete of the Year, the fastest 
Michigander to ever run a 
10,000-meter race, and in 2015, 
she was once again named an 
All-American.

“She’s accomplished a lot,” 

said 
Michigan 
coach 
Mike 

McGuire. “But she’s just getting 
started on her career.”

Saturday, 
at 
the 
NCAA 

Championships 
in 
Terre 

Haute, Ind., Finn will have the 
opportunity to add another 
milestone to this impressive 
list. It will be her last cross 
country race as a Wolverine.

McGregor 
has 
followed 

Finn’s career, and now, she 
could watch the senior match 
her as an NCAA champion.

“I’m really confident in the 

talent she has,” McGregor said. 
“It definitely is going to be huge 

to have her go out there and win 
the National Championship.”

McGuire 
also 
coached 

McGregor 
to 

her NCAA win 
in 
1998, 
and 

he 
noted 
the 

similarities 
between 
his 

former 
star 

runner and his 
current one.

“Both 
are 

ferocious 
competitors,” 
McGuire 
said. 

“(They are) two athletes that 
have a burning desire to prepare 
and a burning desire to show 
their preparation on race day.”

Despite 
her 
countless 

successes, Finn’s road to victory 

has not been without its bumps. 
Ahead of the 2016 Olympics 
in Rio de Janeiro, Finn was 

selected 
to 

participate 
in 
the 
United 

States’ Olympic 
trials 
for 
the 

10,000-meter 
category. 
Prior 

to fulfilling this 
dream, 
a 
foot 

injury kept her 
from competing 
in 
the 
trials, 

dashing 
her 

hopes of joining the American 
team in Brazil. 

During last year’s NCAA 

championships, Finn lost her 
socks and shoes while running, 
yet still managed to finish an 

impressive 19th in the race.

“She just does really well 

against adversity,” McGregor 
said. “No matter how high the 
obstacle.”

While this weekend’s race 

could place pressure on Finn, 
McGregor says that it’s equally 
important for Finn to maintain 
the routines and tactics that 
have brought success so far.

“Go there being prepared 

and confident,” McGregor said. 
“It’s more about keeping your 
emotions in check, because 
your body is ready to do it.”

Added McGuire: “She has a 

passion to prepare, she loves 
everything about the sport. … 
She loves to prepare to compete. 
And she loves to do it on a daily 
basis.”

High-scoring Wolverines to take on Howard

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team has reached 
a triple-digit score 14 times in 
its history, and four of those 
occasions have come under 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. 
Most 
recently, 
the 

Wolverines dominated Oakland, 
101-63, last Friday. 

After winning both games of 

the season-opening weekend in 
Crisler Center, Michigan has a 
chance to continue that streak 
on Friday and Monday against 
Howard and Western Michigan, 
respectively. If it does, Barnes 
Arico will push her way into the 
number-three slot of the school’s 
all-time wins list. She currently 
holds a .612 winning percentage. 

As of Tuesday, the Wolverines 

are ranked first in the nation for 
scoring offense. 

“Everyone that has come 

in has really contributed and 
done a great job,” said Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico said to 

Michigan Insider. “Right now 
we’re in a rotation of nine or 
10 deep that are really able to 
contribute.” 

Michigan 
has 
promising 

statistics to bolster its claim to 
victory, including coming off 
just the second time in program 
history that six players scored in 
double digits. 

Leading the charge against 

the Bison and Broncos will 
be 
junior 
guard 
Katelynn 

Flaherty, freshman guard Kysre 
Gondrezick 
and 
sophomore 

center Hallie Thome. Sophomore 
guard Nicole Munger and junior 
guard Jillian Dunston will most 
likely make a splash on the court, 
too. 

“This is the most depth we’ve 

had since I’ve been here,” Barnes 
Arico said. “It’s a pretty exciting 
time because if someone gets in 
foul trouble, if someone gets hurt, 
if someone’s not feeling well, if 
someone’s having an off game, 
we’ve had someone we’ve been 
able to sub in and not lose much. 

“It’s still early in the season, 

and the competition will change, 
but we really were able to play 
the entire team the other night 
and not lose a beat.” 

Another milestone to look 

out for — potentially — will be 
senior guard Siera Thompson 
shooting her way to become the 
career leader in three-pointers 
at Michigan. She will need just 
five 3’s away to surpass Carmen 
Reynolds, who holds 205. 

Flaherty 
is 
jockeying 
to 

achieve that milestone, too, 
already ranking fourth all-time 
with 188 in just her third year of 
collegiate play. 

But whoever gets there first 

will still have to play Howard 
and Western Michigan. 

The 
Wolverines 
will 
be 

playing 
the 
Bison 
for 
the 

first time in program history. 
Howard lost its first two games 
of the season and boasts just 
two players who are scoring in 
double digits, guard Te’Shya 
Heslip and forward Erin Blaine. 

Don’t count the Bison out, 

though — Heslip is tied for first 

in her conference for scoring 
with 24 points per game and 
leads in assists per game with an 
average of 6.5. 

Next up are the Broncos, who 

defeated Davidson in their home 
opener, 76-63. A player to look 
out for will be forward Breanna 
Mobley, who was named both 
the MAC West Player of the 
Week and the College Sports 
Madness MAC Player of the 
Week. 

Notably, Western Michigan 

leads the all-time series against 
Michigan 15-13 — though the 
Wolverines have won three 
straight. 

Looking 
ahead, 
the 

Wolverines are gearing up for 
a 
seven-game 
away 
stretch 

that will take them all around 
the nation. But first, they are 
looking to give a meaningful 
“see ya later” to Crisler Center. 

“We have a real tough stretch 

coming up,” Barnes Arico said. 
“We’re just trying to focus on 
one game at a time. We’re trying 
get better as a team today.”

NEW YORK CITY — Just over 

three minutes into the opening 
half of the Michigan men’s 
basketball 
team’s 
2K 

Classic 
game 
against 
Marquette, 
Derrick 

Walton Jr. picked up his second 
foul. It was part of a string of 
uncharacteristic errors made by 
the senior guard that forced him 
to spend a majority of the first 
half on the bench.

Behind 
Walton, 
the 

Wolverines 
had 
overcome 

a pair of first-half deficits 
against Howard and IUPUI last 
weekend. But when it became 
a reality Walton wouldn’t have 
that same impact against the 
Golden Eagles on Friday, the 
rest of the team did more than 
its part to make sure the senior’s 
absence wasn’t felt.

After 
being 
tied 
15-15, 

the 
Wolverines 
completely 

overwhelmed 
Marquette 
for 

the remaining 13 minutes of the 
first half, outscoring the Golden 
Eagles by 24 in that stretch en 
route to a 79-61 win.

With freshman guard Xavier 

Simpson 
and 
junior 
guard 

Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman 
leading 
Michigan’s 
backcourt, 

the Wolverines built up their 
advantage 
without 
Walton 

heading into the second half.

“We have a next man up 

mentality,” said senior guard 
Zak Irvin. “I think that showed. 
We knew it was going to be 
tough once Derrick went out 
with two fouls. But I love that 
(Xavier) came on — you know, 

kind of first road game, neutral 
game whatever you want to 
call it. We didn’t miss a beat. 
We kept it going forward, and I 
think that was huge for us.”

Abdur-Rahkman 
was 

aggressive driving to the basket 
all night, scoring 15 points and 
going a perfect 7-for-7 from the 
free throw line. His scoring 
took the pressure off Simpson, 
who was forced to play more 
than he previously had in his 
college career.

If 
anyone 
embodied 
the 

efficiency Michigan displayed 
all night, it was Irvin. The senior 
ended up leading all scorers with 
16 points. His 5-for-9 shooting 
fell just above the Wolverines’ 
51 percent conversion from the 
field Thursday. Irvin’s offensive 
consistency, combined with seven 
rebounds and five assists, was 
exactly what Michigan expects 
out of its seasoned veteran. Irvin’s 
teammates followed his suit, and 
that powered the Wolverines all 
night.

“I think we all came out 

pretty amped up,” Irvin said. 
“Obviously 
playing 
in 
the 

Garden is a great experience 
for all of us, and we knew it was 
going to kind of be like a home 
game for us, with all the fans 
that travel and come and support 
us, so I think that’s what got us 
off to the start we had.”

Wilson and senior forward 

Mark Donnal built off strong 
outings in Michigan’s opening 
two games and put together a 
pair of complete performances. 
After being handed his first 
start of his career, Wilson 
had 
his 
third 
double-digit 

rebounding night in as many 
games, grabbing 12 boards.

Donnal, 
along 
with 

sophomore 
forward 
Moritz 

Wagner, outsized the Golden 
Eagles at the post. The pair 
combined for 24 points and four 
rebounds, all while giving the 
Wolverines a size advantage 
they had been lacking in similar 
matchups in years past. Both 
bigs also showed off their 
perimeter abilities, each making 
a shot from behind the arc.

“(Wagner’s) more seasoned. 

DJ’s more seasoned. It’s a huge 
lift for us,” said Michigan coach 
John Beilein. “Really those two 
guys were non-factors for us 
last season. It’s more about what 
they do as they develop.”

Despite being benched in 

light of Wilson’s emergence, 
redshirt junior guard Duncan 
Robinson came on and looked 
as confident as ever doing what 
he does best. Robinson was 
3-for-5 from 3-point range, 
boosting 
Michigan’s 
offense 

with 10 points. He helped the 
Wolverines shoot an impressive 
39 percent from behind the arc.

Michigan will have just a 

few hours to admire its win 
before it takes on Southern 
Methodist in the 2K Classic 
final on Friday. The Wolverines 
not only hope to close out their 
first tournament of the season 
with a championship, but also 
to get revenge over a team that 
has handed them a loss in each 
of the previous two seasons.

“This’ll 
be 
a 
great, 
great 

barometer for us right now 
to see where we are,” Beilein 
said. “We’re trying to win a 
championship. We’d love to win 
this championship, get out to a 4-0 
start. But we’re playing an NCAA 
Tournament team (in) SMU.”

Senior guard Derrick Walton Jr. dribbles past a Marquette defender in Thursday night’s game at the 2K Sports Classic in New York City. Walton contributed a double-double, scoring 10 points and leading Michigan with 12 rebounds.

NEW YORK CITY — Since 

returning to the starting lineup 
after missing the Michigan men’s 
basketball 
team’s 
exhibition 

opener with an ankle injury, junior 
guard Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman has stepped up when 
the Wolverines needed him in 
both games of the 2K Classic’s Ann 
Arbor regional. And his timely 
play traveled with him all the way 
to New York City, as Michigan 
took on Marquette in the semifinal 
round of the tournament at 
Madison Square Garden.

Against Howard last Friday, 

the Wolverines failed to score 
for the opening five minutes of 
the game. Opportunities came 
and went, and Michigan couldn’t 
capitalize, so Abdur-Rahkman 
took matters into his own hands. 
Knocking 
down 
back-to-back 

triples just 30 seconds apart, 
Abdur-Rahkman not only put 
Michigan on the board, but tied 
the game at six to stop the Bison 
in their tracks.

Against IUPUI the following 

Sunday, Abdur-Rahkman played 
all but four minutes for the 
Wolverines, 
finishing 
among 

the team’s top scorers with 12 
points. Adding in two rebounds, 
two steals and a block for good 
measure, Abdur-Rahkman made 
his presence felt all over the floor 
in a comfortable win.

So when senior guard Derrick 

Walton Jr. committed two quick 
fouls and had to sit out the majority 
of the first half Thursday night 
against Marquette, it came as no 
surprise that Abdur-Rahkman 
would be the one to shoulder the 
burden for Michigan.

“With Derrick gone, not only 

did he need to look to score a little 
bit more, he had to run the team 
a little bit with (freshman guard 
Xavier Simpson),” said Michigan 
coach John Beilein. “(Simpson) is 
still getting some of the timing on 

some of our stuff, and so he was 
really running like half a point 
guard at that time.

“So as he was out there, 

that was what I was thinking 
— ‘All right, if we ever have 
these injuries again, or we 
have two point guards out, can 
Muhammad fulfill this role?’ And 
he did at times today.”

In an opening half in which 

the Wolverines simply ran away 
from the Golden Eagles, Abdur-
Rahkman guided the offensive 
explosion by assuming the point 
guard role and facilitating the 
run of play. While Michigan led 
by double digits for much of that 
stretch, Abdur-Rahkman poured 
in 11 points, seven of which came 
from the free-throw line.

Adopting a more aggressive 

approach than he has shown so 
far this season, Abdur-Rahkman 
pressured Marquette’s defense 
relentlessly. Driving to the basket 

continuously, he cut through 
the Golden Eagles left and right 
to open up space in the middle 
for himself and his teammates. 
His up-tempo tone fed into 
his defensive mindset as well, 
forcing a pair of steals to launch 
counterattacks on the other end.

“I think Muhammad did a 

great job bringing the ball up, 
getting us set on offense and also 
being aggressive as well,” said 
senior forward Zak Irvin. “So 
it’s huge when you have other 
players who can step up when 
Derrick isn’t in the game.”

By the time the half came to 

its conclusion, the Wolverines 
held a 50-26 advantage and never 
looked back. Though Abdur-
Rahkman scored just four points 
in the second half, he had already 
done his part, as Michigan 
emerged with a 79-61 victory to 
advance to the championship 
round of the 2K Classic.

NOVEMBER 19, 2016: INDIANA


FootballSaturday, November 19, 2016

A few weeks ago, Ben Braden 

recalled sitting around watching the 
Ohio State-Penn State football game 
the previous Saturday night with his 
roommates.

He listed them: Ben Pliska, a fifth-

year senior offensive lineman; Greg 
Froelich, a redshirt junior offensive 
lineman; Mike Jocz — “You guys 
know, the really smart guy,” Braden 
said with a laugh.

That label follows Jocz, a fifth-year 

senior tight end, around Schembechler 
Hall. It’s understandable. He is, 
after all, well on his way to earning 
a master’s degree in mechanical 
engineering after graduating with 
a team-high 3.964 GPA in the same 
major.

So it’s no surprise that Jocz’s 

academic prowess has captured media 
attention. His teammates routinely 
field reporters’ questions on the 
subject, and coach Jim Harbaugh has 
faced exactly one question about Jocz 
this season, on the same topic.

“We always kind of joke about how 

he’s the genius of the group,” said 

redshirt sophomore Ian Bunting, a 
tight end like Jocz.

Coaches seize it as a motivational 

tool — tight ends coach Jay Harbaugh 
even created the Michael Jocz Honor 
Society to recognize the tight end with 
the top score on the weekly playbook 
test. It is usually Michael Jocz.

Jocz seems more than comfortable 

with the notion that he will follow 
a different path than many of his 
teammates who land in the NFL 
next year. He hopes instead to earn 
headlines for designing concussion-
preventing helmets or improving self-
driving cars.

Either way, to many, Jocz’s path 

has captured two labels: great student 
and great football player. Braden’s joke 
aside, those close to him know him as 
much more.

“To them, I’m just their friend that 

happens to do well in school,” Jocz 
said. “I’m with them all the time, 
hanging out with them, so they just 
think of me as one of the guys.”

He doesn’t often think of himself as 

an incredible student or an incredible 
athlete. Those are just two things he 
enjoys doing. His career at Michigan 
has really been about realizing a 

lifelong dream — but if you thought 
everything has gone smoothly, you’d 
be wrong about Jocz again.

***

When Jocz was little, his family 

put an addition onto their Novi 
home. After months observing the 
head carpenter every day, 2-year-old 
Michael walked up to the man and 
said, matter-of-factly, “You have a new 
saw, don’t you? I’ve been watching 
you, and you’ve got a brand-new saw.”

Sure enough, the carpenter had 

just purchased a compound miter saw. 
Michael’s father, Warren, watched in 
shock and wondered: “What 2-year-
old picks that kind of thing up?”

Michael took off from there. Soon, 

he beat everyone at adding up the 
dice during Yahtzee games, and 
he’d calculate how much change his 
mother, Ann-Marie, would receive at 
the grocery store.

Before long, Warren — who also 

earned a bachelor’s and master’s 
in 
mechanical 
engineering 
from 

Michigan — began enlisting Michael’s 
help in chores around the house. 
Warren, a Ford Motor Company 

engineer for the past 29 years, was a 
worthy teacher, and Michael was his 
eager student.

In that sense, Jocz’s path to 

mechanical engineering wasn’t a 
surprise. His place on the football 
team, on the other hand, wasn’t easily 
forecast.

Jocz didn’t even begin playing 

football until his freshman year in 
high school. His prep career netted 
a handful of Division III offers, but 
Jocz only ever wanted to go to one 
school. He wore Michigan T-shirts, 
sweatshirts 
and 
hats 
nonstop. 

He estimates that 17 of his family 
members across five generations have 

gone to the University. As a kid, he 
even dressed up as a Michigan football 
player for Halloween.

So committed to this dream, he 

applied and committed to attend 
before the football team was even 
an option. That’s when his offensive 
coordinator at Novi stepped in and 
sent his highlight tape to former 
Michigan assistant Al Borges, who 
offered Jocz a spot as a walk-on.

“I got this opportunity to play for 

the winningest program in football 
history, and it was something that I’ve 
always dreamed about doing,” Jocz 
said. “I was like, ‘You know, why not? 
I’m never going to get this opportunity 
again, and why not make the best of 
it?’ ”

With that, Jocz joined the team, 

and he’s been there ever since. On 
the surface, it sounds like a charmed 
journey. Getting here required much 
more work.

***

On the third day of his first fall camp 

as a freshman, Jocz wanted to quit. In 
fairness, so did Vincent Smith, then an 
established senior running back.

“We always kind 

of joke about how 

he’s the genius of 

the group.”

CLAIRE ABDO/Daily


Jocz’s parents dropped him off on 

an August Sunday in 2012. By Tuesday, 
he wasn’t sure if he would last. He was 
struggling and exhausted, and another 
walk-on tight end had already quit.

In times like those, Jocz often calls 

his parents to talk through them, and 
this time he told them he wasn’t sure 
if he’d make it. Warren Jocz recalls 
Michael relaying a similar sentiment 
from Smith, who was in his fourth fall 
camp. “I just want to call home and tell 
Mom I quit,” Smith had told Jocz in an 
ice bath after practice.

“It was huge going forward, because 

it helped me know that obviously I 
wasn’t alone, and that everyone was 
going through that, so I could make it 
through,” Jocz said.

Jocz broke things down: First he’d 

make it through the first week. Then 
the next. Then the duration of camp. 
Then the first game. Finally, he ran 
out to midfield at Michigan Stadium, 
touched the banner and thought: “I’m 
going to do everything I can to do this 
for the next five years.”

Over time, Jocz took enough small 

steps to see where he was going in the 
end, though it took a while. He spent 
his first two years almost exclusively 
on scout team, going up against the 
starters, doing the hardest of work and 
receiving no recognition.

As he worked on the scout punt-

block team, he presented a problem: 
He kept blocking punts. In drills 
intended to give the starters practice 
covering the kick, Jocz wouldn’t let 
it get that far. He once showed his 
mother a bruise on his arm from the 
impact of the ball.

Mary-Ann Jocz made her son a 

prediction: “One of these days, you are 
going to block a punt in a game, and it’s 
going to change the whole game.” Just 
like in that ice bath, Jocz wasn’t sure 
things would ever work out.

But he kept at it, eventually earning 

himself game reps on special teams. 
On Sept. 17, in the third game of Jocz’s 
fifth year, the Wolverines faced their 
first adversity of the season. Down 
14-0 against Colorado early in the 
first quarter, they sent out Jocz and 
the punt-block team to try to shift the 
momentum.

As four Michigan players broke 

through 
the 
line 
against 
three 

blockers, Jocz charged at the punter 
untouched, once again sticking his 
arm into the ball’s path. Sophomore 
wide receiver Grant Perry turned 
the loose ball into a touchdown, 
permanently shifting the momentum. 
The Wolverines went on to win, 45-28. 
The man who never thought he’d play 
for Michigan had proven his mother 
right.

“Obviously, when it happened this 

year, I was like, ‘Mike…’ ” Ann-Marie 
said, “and he just smiled at me and he 
goes, ‘Mom, I know.’ ”

***

Strange as it sounds, Jocz faced 

that adversity in the classroom, too. 
Two years ago, Jocz had adjusted to 
Michigan football, proven himself on 
the scout team and even saw the field 
a few times. He had found a way to 
manage all of it, and yet he feared it 
could all come crashing down.

The more difficult mechanical 

engineering 
classes 
stressed 
him 

out. The pressure to perform in 
front of 110,000 people on Saturdays 
compounded that. He pushed his 
body to hold that spot on the field, but 
suddenly lost it. He spent long hours 
studying heat transfer in an Evanston 
hotel room, but the same week he 
struggled on an exam.

The student perceived as perfect 

experienced one of his first brushes 
with the stress most students know so 
well. Again, Jocz thought to himself: 
Man, this is getting to be a little much.

He called his parents again.
Ann-Marie remembers that call. 

She remembers her son sweating, his 
heart racing, his mind again doubting 
whether he could handle the workload.

Jocz went back to breaking things 

down. First he made it through that 
week, then back onto the special teams 
unit, then to an “A” in the class.

It was not his best semester. He did 

not sleep enough. He did not relax 
much. His team went 5-7, its worst 
finish of his career. And yet he grew.

“I learned that I can push myself 

further than I think I can,” Jocz said. 
“Your mind oftentimes gives out 

before the body, so your mind is telling 
you to stop well before your actual 
limits. Football, you can always take 
another snap, give a little bit more. And 
in the classroom, if you put your mind 

to it, you can retain more information, 
you can figure stuff out better. I think 
it’s just more that I can do both.”

Each time Jocz overcame one of 

those hurdles, he gained confidence 
that his work would help lift him 
over the next. In the end, he found 
perspective.

“It was a lot of self-induced stress, 

but then again, there’s nowhere else 
I’d rather be doing this,” Jocz said. “I 
don’t think I’d be able to push myself or 
put in the amount of time at any other 
school besides Michigan. It’s just kind 
of what I’ve dreamed about. So I don’t 
mind staying up later trying to get this 
stuff done, because I take a lot of pride 
in succeeding at both.”

***

Saturday, Jocz will run out of the 

tunnel at Michigan Stadium for the last 
time. His dream ride is almost over, not 
so much the one of being an engineer 
or the one of being a football player, 
but the one of being at Michigan, the 
school his family attended, the school 
he grew up at, the only school he’s ever 
known. Football and engineering are 
only parts of that.

Asked what more he’d want to 

be known for, Jocz paused before 
saying, “I guess it’s how much I care 
about my teammates and my friends. 
Some of my best friends I made on 
the team, I’m living with them now. 
Some of the friendships I’ve made 
with them will last a lifetime. Some 
of the memories, I’ll do anything for 
my friends. That’s what people don’t 
really know about me.”

Jocz’s intelligence and athleticism 

are just two facts about him. Here 
are some more: He is engaged to be 
married in July to Natalie Paul, his 
high school sweetheart who graduated 
last spring from Washington and 
Jefferson (Pa.) College.

He has a younger sister, Kathryn, 

9, and an older sister, Jennifer, 25, 
who also graduated from Michigan 
and is now studying toward a Ph.D. in 
chemical engineering. “She got more 
brains than I did,” Jocz quipped.

He certainly got plenty. When he’s in 

the locker room, he stands out because 
of his academic ability. When Jocz is in 
the classroom, he stands out because of 
his football ability. When he’s with his 

friends, he’s just himself.

“It’s always nice, to get away from 

both,” he said. “I don’t think it’s a bad 
thing to be known as the smart guy and 
the athletic guy, but it’s nice to not be 
thought of as one or the other. When 
you’re with your friends, you’re just 
Michael, just as they’re Ben Braden, 
Ben Pliska, Juwann Bushell-Beatty, 
Greg Froelich.”

With those four offensive linemen 

as 
roommates, 
Jocz 
has 
good 

company for dinner. Jocz’s father 
calls him a “home body,” more 
interested in spending time with a 
small, tight-knit group of friends 
than going out and being part of a 
bigger party. He likes to tease his 
roommates and have them tease him 
back. He likes to laugh.

There, he doesn’t have to trumpet 

his status as an academic or a football 
player, either. (“If you talked to him 
and didn’t know that,” his mother 
adds, “he’s not going to tell you.”)

As his career winds down, Jocz 

may go down as one of the top 
scholars in the history of the football 
program. He hopes to be more than 
that, but in the end, he’s grateful for 
every part of his dream.

“When you’re at football, you’re 

focused on football. When you’re in 
class, you’re in class,” Jocz said. “But 
then you can really be yourself outside 
with your friends. It’s nice to not be 
thought of one as the other.

“But I guess (they’re) not bad things 

to be known for.”

Michigan owns a 20-game winning streak over Indiana dating 
back to 1987, but that run does not lack drama. The last time the 
two teams met, the Wolverines hobbled into Bloomington and 
struggled to stop the Hoosiers’ up-tempo offense, but rallied and 
pulled out a 48-41, double-overtime victory. This time, they head 
into Senior Day hoping to keep their Big Ten title hopes alive.

The Wolverines still have the advantage, 
even if Wilton Speight is out.

Hawaii (Sept. 3): Alohahahahaha.

Central Florida (Sept. 10): Is that what it looks 
like to get outhit?

Illinois (Oct. 22): It turned out the Illini had no 
fight after all.

Michigan State (Oct. 29): They had trouble 
with the pitch, the ball was free and it might as 
well have been the last play of the game.

Maryland (Nov. 5): Congratulations, DJ Khaled 
Durkin, you played yourself.

Colorado (Sept. 17): Colorado figured scoring 
28 would be plenty.

Iowa (Nov. 12): Kirk Ferentz is the new governor 
of Iowa.

Penn State (Sept. 24): Might need to rename 
Happy Valley soon.

Wisconsin (Oct. 1): Jourdan Lewis typed this 
joke with one hand.

Rutgers (Oct. 8): That’s it. That’s the joke.
Ohio State (Nov. 26): Who schedules a game

‘M’ ready for new-look Indiana team

Though the Michigan football 

team hasn’t lost to Indiana (3-4 
Big Ten, 5-5 overall) since 1987, 
a win over the 
third-ranked 
Wolverines 
would 
mean 

more 
to 
the 

Hoosiers 
this 

week.

Michigan 

(6-1, 
9-1) 
is 

in 
College 

Football Playoff 
contention, 
and 
Indiana 

will try to take 
advantage 
of 

the Wolverines while they’re still 
reeling from their first loss of the 
season.

On top of rebounding from 

last 
Saturday, 
Michigan 
also 

likely faces a major change on 
its offense. Redshirt sophomore 
quarterback Wilton Speight has 
grown leaps and bounds over the 
last nine games, but now reports 
say he may not play for the rest 
of the regular season. Harbaugh 
said the injury is day-to-day, and 
if Speight doesn’t take the field 
on Saturday, redshirt junior John 
O’Korn should do so instead.

Though O’Korn hasn’t started 

a game this season, he has played 
plenty in garbage time. He also has 
over a year of starter experience 
from his time at Houston, so there 
may not be as much of a decline as 
some fans are bracing for. 

Running backs coach Tyrone 

Wheatley hasn’t noticed much of 
a change in practice this week, 
with O’Korn and redshirt junior 
quarterback Shane 
Morris 
taking 

most of the reps. 

“We don’t look 

at it as a drop-off,” 
Wheatley 
said. 

“We 
don’t 
look 

at it as anything 
different. It’s the 
next guy in. Game 
normal. We don’t 
look at it as, ‘Hey, 
now it falls on us.’ 
To be honest with 
you, hell, it always falls on us. 
That’s the way I always like to look 
at it. It’s nothing different.”

Senior running back De’Veon 

Smith told some of his teammates 
that they needed the loss and 
could grow from it after the 
group rushed for just 98 yards and 
averaged 2.8 yards per run in their 
loss to Iowa.

If the defense is as effective as 

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
has praised it to be, then the 
Wolverines may see a replay of last 
week’s rushing game.

“(Indiana coach Kevin Wilson 

is doing) well, really coaching a 
good football team,” Harbaugh 
said. “Doing a very good job. 
The defense is an aggressive, 
athletic, fast (group). They create 

turnovers, 
they 

tackle 
extremely 

well, they cover 
a lot of the field 
physically. Really 
good 
defensive 

linemen. 
Active, 

athletic 
backers 

that cause a lot of 
the havoc and very 
good players in the 
secondary.”

But 
Indiana 

ranks 
55th 
in 

overall team defense, allowing 
156.2 yards per game on the 
ground, so the Wolverines will 

still have plenty of opportunity to 
create space.

On the offensive side of the 

ball, the Hoosiers are just one 
slot 
behind 
the 
Wolverines 

in total offense. This can be 
mostly attributed to quarterback 
Richard Lagow, who has thrown 
for 2,866 yards already this 
season. Though he has thrown 
13 
interceptions, 
he 
has 
a 

completion rate of 61 percent.

“They’ve got a good offense,” 

said defensive backs coach Brian 
Smith. “They have one of the best 
receiving corps that we’ve faced so 
far. The quarterback’s got a strong 
arm. He can throw it deep. He can 
make all the throws. Just know 
that their tempo and different 
things that they do schematically 
can pose different problems for 
you, so we’ve got our hands full 
this week.”

Indiana has its work cut out, 

but its fast pace can throw off 
opponents. It worked against 
Michigan 
State, 
Rutgers 
and 

Maryland, but it wasn’t sufficient 
against Big Ten powerhouses 
Penn State and Ohio State.

The Wolverines will certainly 

be occupied on Saturday, but they 
should easily be able to escape the 
scrappy Hoosiers.

Wolverines may start O’Korn on Saturday against Hoosiers, who also feature new starting quarterback

Jocz’s parents dropped him off on 

an August Sunday in 2012. By Tuesday, 
he wasn’t sure if he would last. He was 
struggling and exhausted, and another 
walk-on tight end had already quit.

In times like those, Jocz often calls 

his parents to talk through them, and 
this time he told them he wasn’t sure 
if he’d make it. Warren Jocz recalls 
Michael relaying a similar sentiment 
from Smith, who was in his fourth fall 
camp. “I just want to call home and tell 
Mom I quit,” Smith had told Jocz in an 
ice bath after practice.

“It was huge going forward, because 

it helped me know that obviously I 
wasn’t alone, and that everyone was 
going through that, so I could make it 
through,” Jocz said.

Jocz broke things down: First he’d 

make it through the first week. Then 
the next. Then the duration of camp. 
Then the first game. Finally, he ran 
out to midfield at Michigan Stadium, 
touched the banner and thought: “I’m 
going to do everything I can to do this 
for the next five years.”

Over time, Jocz took enough small 

steps to see where he was going in the 
end, though it took a while. He spent 
his first two years almost exclusively 
on scout team, going up against the 
starters, doing the hardest of work and 
receiving no recognition.

As he worked on the scout punt-

block team, he presented a problem: 
He kept blocking punts. In drills 
intended to give the starters practice 
covering the kick, Jocz wouldn’t let 
it get that far. He once showed his 
mother a bruise on his arm from the 
impact of the ball.

Mary-Ann Jocz made her son a 

prediction: “One of these days, you are 
going to block a punt in a game, and it’s 
going to change the whole game.” Just 
like in that ice bath, Jocz wasn’t sure 
things would ever work out.

But he kept at it, eventually earning 

himself game reps on special teams. 
On Sept. 17, in the third game of Jocz’s 
fifth year, the Wolverines faced their 
first adversity of the season. Down 
14-0 against Colorado early in the 
first quarter, they sent out Jocz and 
the punt-block team to try to shift the 
momentum.

As four Michigan players broke 

through 
the 
line 
against 
three 

blockers, Jocz charged at the punter 
untouched, once again sticking his 
arm into the ball’s path. Sophomore 
wide receiver Grant Perry turned 
the loose ball into a touchdown, 
permanently shifting the momentum. 
The Wolverines went on to win, 45-28. 
The man who never thought he’d play 
for Michigan had proven his mother 
right.

“Obviously, when it happened this 

year, I was like, ‘Mike…’ ” Ann-Marie 
said, “and he just smiled at me and he 
goes, ‘Mom, I know.’ ”

***

Strange as it sounds, Jocz faced 

that adversity in the classroom, too. 
Two years ago, Jocz had adjusted to 
Michigan football, proven himself on 
the scout team and even saw the field 
a few times. He had found a way to 
manage all of it, and yet he feared it 
could all come crashing down.

The more difficult mechanical 

engineering 
classes 
stressed 
him 

out. The pressure to perform in 
front of 110,000 people on Saturdays 
compounded that. He pushed his 
body to hold that spot on the field, but 
suddenly lost it. He spent long hours 
studying heat transfer in an Evanston 
hotel room, but the same week he 
struggled on an exam.

The student perceived as perfect 

experienced one of his first brushes 
with the stress most students know so 
well. Again, Jocz thought to himself: 
Man, this is getting to be a little much.

He called his parents again.
Ann-Marie remembers that call. 

She remembers her son sweating, his 
heart racing, his mind again doubting 
whether he could handle the workload.

Jocz went back to breaking things 

down. First he made it through that 
week, then back onto the special teams 
unit, then to an “A” in the class.

It was not his best semester. He did 

not sleep enough. He did not relax 
much. His team went 5-7, its worst 
finish of his career. And yet he grew.

“I learned that I can push myself 

further than I think I can,” Jocz said. 
“Your mind oftentimes gives out 

before the body, so your mind is telling 
you to stop well before your actual 
limits. Football, you can always take 
another snap, give a little bit more. And 
in the classroom, if you put your mind 

to it, you can retain more information, 
you can figure stuff out better. I think 
it’s just more that I can do both.”

Each time Jocz overcame one of 

those hurdles, he gained confidence 
that his work would help lift him 
over the next. In the end, he found 
perspective.

“It was a lot of self-induced stress, 

but then again, there’s nowhere else 
I’d rather be doing this,” Jocz said. “I 
don’t think I’d be able to push myself or 
put in the amount of time at any other 
school besides Michigan. It’s just kind 
of what I’ve dreamed about. So I don’t 
mind staying up later trying to get this 
stuff done, because I take a lot of pride 
in succeeding at both.”

***

Saturday, Jocz will run out of the 

tunnel at Michigan Stadium for the last 
time. His dream ride is almost over, not 
so much the one of being an engineer 
or the one of being a football player, 
but the one of being at Michigan, the 
school his family attended, the school 
he grew up at, the only school he’s ever 
known. Football and engineering are 
only parts of that.

Asked what more he’d want to 

be known for, Jocz paused before 
saying, “I guess it’s how much I care 
about my teammates and my friends. 
Some of my best friends I made on 
the team, I’m living with them now. 
Some of the friendships I’ve made 
with them will last a lifetime. Some 
of the memories, I’ll do anything for 
my friends. That’s what people don’t 
really know about me.”

Jocz’s intelligence and athleticism 

are just two facts about him. Here 
are some more: He is engaged to be 
married in July to Natalie Paul, his 
high school sweetheart who graduated 
last spring from Washington and 
Jefferson (Pa.) College.

He has a younger sister, Kathryn, 

9, and an older sister, Jennifer, 25, 
who also graduated from Michigan 
and is now studying toward a Ph.D. in 
chemical engineering. “She got more 
brains than I did,” Jocz quipped.

He certainly got plenty. When he’s in 

the locker room, he stands out because 
of his academic ability. When Jocz is in 
the classroom, he stands out because of 
his football ability. When he’s with his 

friends, he’s just himself.

“It’s always nice, to get away from 

both,” he said. “I don’t think it’s a bad 
thing to be known as the smart guy and 
the athletic guy, but it’s nice to not be 
thought of as one or the other. When 
you’re with your friends, you’re just 
Michael, just as they’re Ben Braden, 
Ben Pliska, Juwann Bushell-Beatty, 
Greg Froelich.”

With those four offensive linemen 

as 
roommates, 
Jocz 
has 
good 

company for dinner. Jocz’s father 
calls him a “home body,” more 
interested in spending time with a 
small, tight-knit group of friends 
than going out and being part of a 
bigger party. He likes to tease his 
roommates and have them tease him 
back. He likes to laugh.

There, he doesn’t have to trumpet 

his status as an academic or a football 
player, either. (“If you talked to him 
and didn’t know that,” his mother 
adds, “he’s not going to tell you.”)

As his career winds down, Jocz 

may go down as one of the top 
scholars in the history of the football 
program. He hopes to be more than 
that, but in the end, he’s grateful for 
every part of his dream.

“When you’re at football, you’re 

focused on football. When you’re in 
class, you’re in class,” Jocz said. “But 
then you can really be yourself outside 
with your friends. It’s nice to not be 
thought of one as the other.

“But I guess (they’re) not bad things 

to be known for.”

A few weeks ago, Ben Braden 

recalled sitting around watching the 
Ohio State-Penn State football game 
the previous Saturday night with his 
roommates.

He listed them: Ben Pliska, a fifth-

year senior offensive lineman; Greg 
Froelich, a redshirt junior offensive 
lineman; Mike Jocz — “You guys 
know, the really smart guy,” Braden 
said with a laugh.

That label follows Jocz, a fifth-year 

senior tight end, around Schembechler 
Hall. It’s understandable. He is, 
after all, well on his way to earning 
a master’s degree in mechanical 
engineering after graduating with 
a team-high 3.964 GPA in the same 
major.

So it’s no surprise that Jocz’s 

academic prowess has captured media 
attention. His teammates routinely 
field reporters’ questions on the 
subject, and coach Jim Harbaugh has 
faced exactly one question about Jocz 
this season, on the same topic.

“We always kind of joke about how 

he’s the genius of the group,” said 

redshirt sophomore Ian Bunting, a 
tight end like Jocz.

Coaches seize it as a motivational 

tool — tight ends coach Jay Harbaugh 
even created the Michael Jocz Honor 
Society to recognize the tight end with 
the top score on the weekly playbook 
test. It is usually Michael Jocz.

Jocz seems more than comfortable 

with the notion that he will follow 
a different path than many of his 
teammates who land in the NFL 
next year. He hopes instead to earn 
headlines for designing concussion-
preventing helmets or improving self-
driving cars.

Either way, to many, Jocz’s path 

has captured two labels: great student 
and great football player. Braden’s joke 
aside, those close to him know him as 
much more.

“To them, I’m just their friend that 

happens to do well in school,” Jocz 
said. “I’m with them all the time, 
hanging out with them, so they just 
think of me as one of the guys.”

He doesn’t often think of himself as 

an incredible student or an incredible 
athlete. Those are just two things he 
enjoys doing. His career at Michigan 
has really been about realizing a 

lifelong dream — but if you thought 
everything has gone smoothly, you’d 
be wrong about Jocz again.

***

When Jocz was little, his family 

put an addition onto their Novi 
home. After months observing the 
head carpenter every day, 2-year-old 
Michael walked up to the man and 
said, matter-of-factly, “You have a new 
saw, don’t you? I’ve been watching 
you, and you’ve got a brand-new saw.”

Sure enough, the carpenter had 

just purchased a compound miter saw. 
Michael’s father, Warren, watched in 
shock and wondered: “What 2-year-
old picks that kind of thing up?”

Michael took off from there. Soon, 

he beat everyone at adding up the 
dice during Yahtzee games, and 
he’d calculate how much change his 
mother, Ann-Marie, would receive at 
the grocery store.

Before long, Warren — who also 

earned a bachelor’s and master’s 
in 
mechanical 
engineering 
from 

Michigan — began enlisting Michael’s 
help in chores around the house. 
Warren, a Ford Motor Company 

engineer for the past 29 years, was a 
worthy teacher, and Michael was his 
eager student.

In that sense, Jocz’s path to 

mechanical engineering wasn’t a 
surprise. His place on the football 
team, on the other hand, wasn’t easily 
forecast.

Jocz didn’t even begin playing 

football until his freshman year in 
high school. His prep career netted 
a handful of Division III offers, but 
Jocz only ever wanted to go to one 
school. He wore Michigan T-shirts, 
sweatshirts 
and 
hats 
nonstop. 

He estimates that 17 of his family 
members across five generations have 

gone to the University. As a kid, he 
even dressed up as a Michigan football 
player for Halloween.

So committed to this dream, he 

applied and committed to attend 
before the football team was even 
an option. That’s when his offensive 
coordinator at Novi stepped in and 
sent his highlight tape to former 
Michigan assistant Al Borges, who 
offered Jocz a spot as a walk-on.

“I got this opportunity to play for 

the winningest program in football 
history, and it was something that I’ve 
always dreamed about doing,” Jocz 
said. “I was like, ‘You know, why not? 
I’m never going to get this opportunity 
again, and why not make the best of 
it?’ ”

With that, Jocz joined the team, 

and he’s been there ever since. On 
the surface, it sounds like a charmed 
journey. Getting here required much 
more work.

***

On the third day of his first fall camp 

as a freshman, Jocz wanted to quit. In 
fairness, so did Vincent Smith, then an 
established senior running back.

Breakdown: How will Speight’s 
absence affect Michigan offense?

The hope for an undefeated 

season is gone, but the Michigan 
football team has plenty to play for.

One week after a jarring loss at 

Iowa, the Wolverines return to action 
Saturday when they host Indiana at 
Michigan Stadium. Michigan still 
controls its own destiny, but any 
safety net it had is no more. The Daily 
breaks down the key matchups for 
when the teams take the field.

Michigan rushing offense vs. 
Indiana rushing defense

With a unit that gives up just 

156.2 rushing yards per game, 
Indiana could be poised to stuff the 
Wolverines on the ground. Michigan 
struggled on the ground at Iowa last 
week, and with Speight likely out, 
it’s a safe bet that the running backs 
will be counted on. Watch for the 
Hoosiers to stack the box, a look that 
has given the Wolverines trouble 
at times this season, particularly 
against Central Florida.

Senior running back De’Veon 

Smith 
still 
leads 
Michigan’s 

crowded backfield, but against an 
Indiana defense that has totaled 
70 tackles for loss this year, it may 
need production out of the whole 
backfield committee to have success.

Edge: Indiana

Michigan passing offense vs. 
Indiana passing defense

This is the great question mark 

of the week. Redshirt sophomore 
quarterback Wilton Speight will 
reportedly miss the game with 
either a shoulder or collarbone 
injury, 
leaving 
redshirt 
junior 

John O’Korn to guide the offense 
in his absence. A former starter at 
Houston before he transferred to 
Michigan, O’Korn has sufficient 
in-game experience to lead the 
offense, though he has not played 
meaningful minutes as a Wolverine.

His greatest advantage, perhaps, 

could be his mobility. Whereas 
Speight relied on his size and 
strength to stave off tacklers, O’Korn 
has the quickness to elude them 
with his feet. Armed with a loaded 
receiving corps made up of fifth-year 

seniors Jehu Chesson and Amara 
Darboh and senior tight end Jake 
Butt, he will have plenty of weapons 
to help him ease into the game.

Fortunately for O’Korn, Indiana’s 

pass defense has fallen short of 
stellar so far this year. The Hoosiers 
are giving up an average of 235.8 
yards per game, and while they do 
have 10 interceptions, that could be 
a sign O’Korn will have some room 
to work on Saturday.

Edge: Michigan

Indiana 
rush 
defense 
vs. 

Michigan rush defense

Gone is Jordan Howard, but 

Indiana’s Devine Redding has kept 
opponents on their toes all season. 
Against No. 8 Penn State last week, 
Redding rushed for 108 yards and 
two touchdowns, putting a scare in 
one of the nation’s top-ranked teams.

Given 
that 
Michigan 
has 

struggled in recent weeks against 
Michigan State’s LJ Scott and 
Iowa’s Akrum Wadley, it wouldn’t 
be a shock if Redding had a similar 
measure of success on Saturday. 

There’s no doubt the Wolverine line 
will be fired up to reassert itself 
after a loss, but sometimes that 
aggression leads to mistakes, too.

Once again, this one is close, but 

Michigan’s track record is enough 
to earn the benefit of the doubt.

Edge: Michigan

Indiana 
passing 
offense 
vs. 

Michigan passing defense

Hoosiers quarterback Richard 

Lagow has the unenviable task of 
attacking the nation’s most effective 
pass defense Saturday.

In senior cornerbacks Channing 

Stribling and Jourdan Lewis, the 
Wolverines boast an athletic pair of 
corners capable of changing the game 
on any play. Lewis has hardly been 
targeted this season, and Stribling has 
capitalized with four interceptions.

Saturday, 
though, 
they’ll 
be 

guarding an impressive trio in 
Ricky Jones, Mitchell Paige and 
Nick 
Westbrook. 
Westbrook 

has accounted for 793 yards and 
five touchdowns this year, while 
Paige leads the team with 49 

receptions. All three are capable of 
stretching the field, and this may 
be the toughest test for Michigan’s 
secondary since Colorado visited 
Ann Arbor in September.

We’ll give the slight edge to the 

nation’s top pass defense, but don’t 
be surprised if Indiana makes some 
noise through the air.

Edge: Michigan

Special teams

Just as the Wolverines got their 

field goal problem figured out, new 
troubles have emerged on special 
teams. Michigan was hampered 
by a series of penalties against the 
Hawkeyes, including a targeting 
penalty on freshman linebacker 
Devin Bush and a critical late-
game facemask on redshirt junior 
linebacker Mike McCray.

With Jabrill Peppers neutralized 

in the return game of late, the 
Wolverines do not appear as 
dangerous on fourth down as they 
did earlier this season. Meanwhile, 
Paige is a dangerous return man 
himself, and he may actually get the 

chance to field some punts. Hoosier 
kicker Griffin Oakes is having a 
rough year, making 12 of 21 field 
goals, so Saturday’s special teams 
battle may come down to who 
makes fewer mistakes.

Oakes knocked in a big 47-yard 

field goal against Penn State last 
week, and if he is indeed back in 
form for the Hoosiers, they could 
win that battle.

Edge: Indiana

Intangibles

On one hand, Michigan will be 

looking to rebound from a major 
letdown last week. But Indiana 
will still view the third-ranked 
Wolverines as upset bait.

The Hoosiers can qualify for a 

bowl game with a win, but on Senior 
Day at Michigan Stadium, it’s hard 
to give this one to anyone but the 
home team.

Edge: Michigan

Prediction: Michigan 34, 
Indiana 17

Behind Enemy Lines: Marcus Oliver

Last year, Indiana took the 

Michigan football team down 
to the wire in Bloomington. The 
contest was decided by a second 
overtime goal-line stand, and the 
Wolverines escaped shaken, but 
unscathed, 48-41.

This year, the two teams will 

meet in Ann Arbor for No. 3 
Michigan’s senior day. Indiana 
linebacker Marcus Oliver, who 
has recorded 74 tackles this year 
for the Hoosiers (3-4 Big Ten, 
5-5 overall), will be looking to 
improve his leadership skills this 
year after being upset with his 
role against Michigan last season.

In July, The Michigan Daily 

chatted with the team captain 
at Big Ten Media Days about last 
season’s crazy finish, his role as a 
team leader and the food at Media 
Days.

The 
Michigan 
Daily: 
The 

game 
against 
Michigan 
last 

season was pretty intense. What 
do you remember from that game, 
and what are you going to take 
with you going forward into this 
season?

Marcus Oliver: There were 

a lot of times — I remember 
watching film — a lot of times 
where 
instead 
of 
linebackers 

bringing their feet and driving 
through them, it allowed them to 
be third-and-one or pick up the 
first down on third down. There 
were a lot of times when we gave 
up extra yards when we shouldn’t 
have.

That was probably my worst 

leadership year I had. I was 
frustrated, and I learned a lot 
and was able to be a better leader 
from then on during the season, so 
there were a lot of things we were 
able to take from that game.

TMD: So this year, playing 

in the Big House, what are you 
going to do from a leadership 
perspective that’s different from 
last season?

MO: Make sure everyone keeps 

their confidence and plays each 
play. Not every play is going to 
go the way you want it to go. Not 
every quarter or half is going 
to go the way you want it to go. 
(Our game against Rutgers last 
season) was the perfect testament 
to just playing every play and 

keep playing and keep battling. 
Anything can happen in a game.

Question: How much more 

comfortable are you this year than 
last year? Coming 
in and getting back 
and playing again, 
how much more 
confident 
and 

comfortable 
are 

you?

MO: 
I’m 

extremely 
confident. 
This 

offseason, I was 
able to work on 
things that I had 
to work on. I feel better than ever, 
and I’m just ready to go. I’m ready 
for camp to start.

Q: How good was last year’s 

bowl just to kind of break through?

MO: I think the best thing 

about last year’s bowl was just 

getting a taste of it. 
Anytime someone 
gets a taste of 
something 
they 

want 
more 
and 

more and more, 
and that’s when 
you see guys start 
to 
work 
harder 

and start playing 
better and start 
preparing 
better. 

I think that’s the 

best thing we got from it, and the 
bowl was awesome, it was great to 
be there. It was a cool experience.

TMD: Being named a team 

captain, especially as a younger 
guy, what did that mean to you?

MO: It’s a huge privilege and 

honor. It doesn’t really happen 
around here, or any team. It just 
says what the team thinks about 
me because the team is the one that 
votes. To be able to picked with all 
of those great guys still there and 
leaving, it’s a huge honor.

TMD: How have you been 

enjoying your media day?

MO: It’s been neat. I’ll tell you 

what, I can’t eat nothing else. I’ve 
been eating since I got here. The 
food is really good and you meet 
some really great people. This place 
is huge, so I think I got all of my 
walking in for the rest of the month.

What to Watch For: O’Korn, 
running back, defense, chaos

Home games have been a cake 

walk for the No. 3 Michigan 
football team this season — the 
Wolverines are 7-0 at Michigan 
Stadium, with only one win 
coming by fewer than 17 points.

But after losing its first game 

of the season at Iowa last week 
and perhaps losing its starting 
quarterback 
for 
the 
season, 

Michigan 
(6-1 
Big 
Ten, 
9-1 

overall) enters its final home 
game against Indiana (3-4, 5-5) 
with a lot more questions than it 
has had in a long time.

Here’s what to watch for on 

Senior Day in Ann Arbor.

1. Is it John O’Korn time?

Redshirt 
sophomore 

quarterback 
Wilton 
Speight 

suffered an unspecified shoulder 
injury near the end of the game in 
Iowa City — some reports claim it 
was a broken collarbone, which 
would sideline the Wolverines’ 
starter for the rest of the season.

In any case, Speight seems 

unlikely to play on Saturday. His 
likely replacement is redshirt 
junior John O’Korn, a transfer 
from Houston whom many fans 
believed would win the starting 
job before the season. Despite 
being a backup all year, O’Korn 
has earned a reputation among his 
teammates for being a hard worker 
and an avid film studier, and 
Michigan says it isn’t expecting 
much of a drop-off.

Because the Wolverines have 

won so many blowouts, O’Korn 
has been fortunate to see the 
field in six games already this 
season. He has been fairly sharp — 
admittedly playing largely against 
backup defenses — completing 13 
of his 18 passes for 114 yards and 
two touchdowns. One thing that 
O’Korn hasn’t shown too much 
of yet, though, is a quality that 
sets up apart from Speight: his 
mobility. If he can replicate some 
of the success he had his freshman 

year at Houston — 3,117 passing 
yards and 104 rushing — Michigan 
should be in good shape.

2. Which running back carries 
the load?

Running backs coach Tyrone 

Wheatley continues to rotate four 
backs every week, and the result 
keep changing. Senior De’Veon 
Smith remains the go-to guy, and 
Wheatley has made it clear he 
trusts Smith the most. Wednesday, 
Wheatley 
cited 
Smith’s 
off-

the-ball talents (including pass 
protection, experience and field 
awareness) as qualities that set 
him apart.

Smith has been up and down so 

far in terms of statistics, though. 
He ran for 114 yards and three 
touchdowns 
against 
Maryland 

two weeks ago, but the Hawkeyes 
held him to just 28 yards on 12 
carries last week. Shifty freshman 
Chris Evans was the team’s 
leading rusher with 52 yards and 
is averaging 7.8 yards a carry this 
year, but he hasn’t earned enough 
trust to be a lead back yet.

Wheatley has proven all year 

long that he’s willing to ride the 
hot hand, but it’s anyone’s guess 
which back will perform the best 
against an opposing defense in any 
given week.

3. Can the Wolverines’ defense 
keep up?

Over the last few weeks, the 

Wolverines have been sliced and 
diced by screen passes, with Iowa 
running back Akrum Wadley 
and Maryland’s entire offense 

finding tremendous success on 
the 
edge. 
Michigan’s 
defense 

has had some uncharacteristic 
tackling problems as well, further 
exasperating those struggles.

Those challenges could come 

to the forefront again this week, 
as the Hoosiers’ up-tempo offense 
has been known to give defenses 
trouble. 
The 
Wolverines 
are 

no exception — last year, then-
running back Jordan Howard ran 
all over an exhausted Michigan 
defense for 238 yards and nearly 
helped his team pull off an upset.

Michigan has one of the most 

talented defensive fronts in the 
country, but its conditioning is 
sure to be tested this weekend. 

4. Chaos.

Indiana is certainly not the 

best team in the Big Ten, but it 
may be the most unpredictable. 
It currently sits right at .500, 
one win from bowl eligibility, 
but the Hoosiers have put up a 
fight in losses against No. 2 Ohio 
State, No. 8 Penn State and No. 18 
Nebraska.

The 
Wolverines 
have 
seen 

Indiana’s “chaos team” potential 
firsthand over the last few years, 
but they have been fortunate 
to come out on top every time. 
Michigan 
hasn’t 
lost 
to 
the 

Hoosiers since 1987, but games 
like a 63-47 shootout in 2013 and 
a 48-41 double-overtime thriller 
last year have threatened that 
streak.

With the Wolverines looking 

more vulnerable than ever, the 
seeds for more chaos this weekend 
may already be planted.

Michigan, Indiana head into rematch of 48-41, double-overtime thriller last season in Bloomington

Senior running back De’Veon Smith (4) had some trouble getting going Saturday against Iowa, but he’ll be back in the starting lineup this week against Indiana.
