HOSPITAL

Medical School, 
health system 

to increase 
collaboration

By KATIE PENROD

Daily Staff Reporter

A few days after the University’s 

Board of Regents approved a 
reorganization of the University 
of Michigan Health System and 
the University’s Medical School’s 
top leadership structure, the 
President’s Advisory Panel on the 
Biosciences released a final report 
detailing recommendations for 
change.

Though 
the 
developments 

mark a new push to evaluate 
the 
University’s 
approach 

to medicine, health and the 
biosciences 
— 
which 
cover 

scientific disciplines that focus 
on the study of life and living 
organisms 
— 
several 
faculty 

members interviewed by The 
Michigan 
Daily 
are 
unsure 

exactly what these changes will 
mean in the near future.

The 
first 
major 
change 

occurred 
last 
month, 
when 

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel 
recommended 
that 

Marschall Runge, the University’s 
executive 
vice 
president 
for 

medical affairs and the chief 
executive officer of UMHS, also 
serve as dean of the University’s 
Medical 
School. 
Runge 
will 

assume the deanship in January, 
in addition to his current roles.

University 
President 

Mark Schlissel convened the 
President’s Advisory Panel on the 
Biosciences last fall to determine 
how best to capitalize on the 
University’s existing resources 
in the sciences. Chaired by 
University 
Provost 
Martha 

Pollack, 
the 
panel 
consisted 

of 17 faculty members from a 
variety of departments, including 
chemistry, biology, psychology, 
biomedical 
engineering 
and 

mathematics.

The 
panel 
made 
four 

recommendations: 
foster 

leadership and hire deans and 
department chairs who lead by 
example, use measures of success 
that support innovative ideas, 
foster 
further 
collaboration 

between faculty members and

HEALTH

Vaccinations now 
required for all 
health system 
volunteers, staff

By TOM MCBRIEN

Daily Staff Reporter

As part of ongoing efforts 

to prevent the spread of the 
seasonal 
influenza 
virus, 

the 
University 
of 
Michigan 

Health System has instituted 
a new policy mandating that 
all employees must get a flu 
vaccination.

The policy, which replaces 

the five-year-old policy that only 
required employees working in 
clinical settings to get a vaccine, 
stipulates that all employees 
must get their vaccination before 
Dec. 1 unless they are exempted 
for medical or religious purposes. 
Employees who do not comply 

will face disciplinary action.

“Progressive corrective action 

could include a verbal warning 
through 
termination,” 
said 

UMHS 
spokeswoman 
Mary 

Masson.

An e-mail sent to all UMHS 

employees said the health system 
is not the first to implement this 
practice.

“Health systems across the 

country have already adopted 
this best practice, which is 
proven to reduce the spread of 

flu,” the e-mail read.

The 
new 
system 
will 

considerably expand the number 
of employees required to get 
vaccinated.

Though 
the 
old 
policy 

covered employees who had 
direct contact with patients, 
the new policy aims to ensure 
that the entire health system 
environment is free from the 
virus; even employees without 
patient contact, like volunteers,

Former player accused 
of taking nude photos 
of a woman without 

permission

By EMMA KERR

Daily Staff Reporter

Former Michigan offensive 

lineman Logan Tuley-Tillman 
was charged with three felony 
counts on Wednesday, according 
to Washtenaw County court 
records.

Tuley-Tillman 
is 
facing 

two counts of capturing and 
distributing an image of an 
unclothed person and one count 
of using a computer to commit a 
crime. He was dismissed from 
the team Sept. 10, but Michigan 
football coach Jim Harbaugh 
did not specify a reason at the 
time, simply citing “conduct 

unacceptable for a Michigan 
student athlete.”

Tuley-Tillman’s arraignment 

date was Wednesday, Oct. 7, 
during which he neither plead 
guilty or innocent but instead 
stood mute for all three charges. 
The personal bond was set at 
$5,000. The third count related 
to using a computer to commit a 
crime carries four to 10 years in 
prison. 

The 
prosecutor 
for 
the 

case is Brian L. Mackie. If the 
felony is bound over, meaning a 
judge believes there is enough 
evidence for the case to move 
forward, 
the 
circuit 
court 

judge presiding over the case 
will be Justice David Swartz, 
according to court documents. 
Tuley-Tillman’s 
attorney 

is listed as Douglas Lewis, 
an 
attorney 
with 
Student 

Legal Services. Lewis could 
not be reached for comment 
Wednesday evening.

James House, professor emeritus of public policy, outlines the disparities in health care between the United States 
and other top developed nations at Weill Hall on Wednesday. 

Dr. James House 
calls for social 

reforms to reduce 

need for care

By BRIAN KUANG

For the Daily

James 
House, 
professor 

emeritus 
of 
public 
policy, 

challenged 
conventional 

approaches 
to 
improving 

health care during a panel 
discussion hosted by the Ford 
School of Public Policy on 
Wednesday.

Discussing his new book, 

“Beyond 
Obamacare: 
Life, 

Death 
and 
Social 
Policy,” 

House 
addressed 
what 
he 

describes as the “growing 
paradoxical crisis” of U.S. 
health care: the United States 
spends about twice as much 
of its GDP on health care as 
similar developed countries, 
yet counterintuitively has a 

lower level of health overall.

He attributed the failure 

of 
reform 
attempts 
to 
a 

misperception that health care 
is the primary determinant of a 
population’s health, pointing to 
evidence that quality of health 
care only has a 10 percent 
correlation with the health of a 
population.

House said the primary 

determinants of a population’s 
health are socioeconomic in 
nature, including educational

DPSS crime alert says 
suspect brandished 
handgun at retail 
store near campus

By TANAZ AHMED

Daily Staff Reporter

The Department of Public 

Safety and Security issued a 
crime alert Wednesday at 11:58 
a.m. after an armed robbery 
occurred on the 1200 block of 
South University near South 
Forest Avenue.

Witnesses told the the Ann 

Arbor Police Department that 
two men robbed a retail store 
at approximately 2:55 a.m. on 
Wednesday. According to the 
witnesses, one of the robbers 
displayed a small handgun.

The two men ran away on foot 

in the direction of the Church

attainment, income and gender 
and racial equality. House said the 
divergence between the quality 
of care in Western Europe and 
the United States began during 
the 1970s, when socioeconomic 
inequality increased in the United 
States.

“We can’t just rely on rescuing 

people after they’ve gotten sick 
by living a lifetime in deprived 
conditions,” he said.

According 
to 
House, 
this 

misconception has caused the 
United States to primarily pursue 
a “supply-side” health care policy 
since the 1980s, which focuses on 
increasing access to health care 
for the population rather than 
reducing their health care needs, 
the most recent example of which is 
the 2008 Affordable Care Act.

Though he said the Affordable 

Care Act passed under President 
Barack Obama was a step in the 
right direction for extending 
health coverage to more of the 
population, House was skeptical 
of its ability to resolve the 
broader issues facing health care 
in the United States.

“Obamacare, like all prior health 

care reforms, is largely a supply-
side policy focused on expanding 
and managing the supply of health 
services and the price of it, rather 
than altering the major driver of the 
demand for health services, which 
is the health of the population,” he 
said.

House advocated for what he 

described as a “demand-side” 
approach to health care policy. This 
approach would reduce the demand 
for health care and rein in costs by 
promoting healthier behavior and 
mitigating the consequences of 
economic inequality.

“All social policy is health 

policy,” he said.

Though 
he 
was 
ultimately 

optimistic about the eventuality of 
this kind of health care reform, he 
addressed its political feasibility 
with hints of realism about the 
present political climate.

“Our role in the policy field isn’t 

to say what is politically palpable at 
the given moment, but to say what is 
actually going to make a difference 
and hope that at some point things 
are going to come in that direction,” 
he said. “There are political 
disputes about things, but there are 
moments when we have been able 
to enact positive changes.”

Orchestra allows 
passersby to serve 
as guest conductors 

By TANAZ AHMED

Daily Staff Reporter

Instead of the usual squirrels 

and students crossing the Diag on 
Wednesday afternoon, members 
of the Michigan Pops Orchestra 
put on a pop-up show.

The student-run pops orches-

tra 
is 
the 
oldest 
collegiate 

orchestra in the country and is 
comprised of non-music major 

students. Throughout the day the 
group offered anyone crossing 
through the Diag an opportunity 
to conduct the ensemble as a part 
of their Conduct Us! event. 

The 
orchestra 
performed 

several musical pieces such as 
“The Victors” for impromptu 
conductors to choose from. 
People with a variety of musical 
experiences were encouraged 
to participate. 

The organization held the 

same event during last fall and 
winter semester. The ensemble 
was inspired by a similar event 
hosted by the New York Phil-
harmonic-Symphony where the 

symphony took to the streets and 
allowed people passing by to con-
duct the orchestra. 

Michigan 
Pops 
Orchestra 

hopes to continue hosting the 
Conduct Us! event once every 
semester. 

“We only have one concert 

per semester so we wanted more 
opportunities to get out and play 
for the people and also get peo-
ple more engaged with music,” 
Payne said.

Scott Fladzinski, an LSA and 

Engineering senior and one of 
the volunteer conductors, was 
excited by the opportunity to 
lead the orchestra in the middle 

of the Diag. 

“I’ve studied music for maybe 

six or seven years but I’ve never 
actually conducted an orchestra, 
let alone on the Michigan Diag, 
which was pretty cool,” Fladzin-
ski said. “As long as it’s a beautiful 
day, this is awesome.”

LSA freshman Meha Patel was 

one of the many onlookers on the 
Diag. 

“It’s awesome that the orches-

tra is out in this weather and let-
ting people conduct them,” she 
said. “Conductors are one of the 
most integral parts of the orches-
tra since they have to make sure 
everyone is on the right beat.”

increase faculty productiveness 
and the efficacy of the institution.

Mary 
O’Riordan, 
associate 

dean of graduate and postdoctoral 
studies, said Runge’s way forward 
will likely be guided by the panel’s 
suggestions.

“This is likely to have significant 

impact on how Dr. Runge will 
shape the sciences and therefore 
our educational mission as well,” 
O’Riordan wrote in an e-mail to 
the Daily. “We are still waiting to 
see how this will impact graduate 
education.”

The panel identified several 

strengths 
of 
the 
University’s 
current 

efforts in the biosciences included 
the size of the overall biosciences 
enterprise at the University, the 
breadth of disciplines outside of the 
biosciences, the scores top-notch 
scientists 
pursuing 
bioscience 

research at the University, the 
spirit of faculty collaboration, the 
highly ranked science facilities 
and the existence of a University-
owned hospital.

The weaknesses listed in the 

panel’s report include leadership 
that does not incentivize risk-
taking, a lack of a common mission 
— especially between the Medical 
School and other entities — and 
insufficient support for graduate 
programs in research.

“While there are many examples 

of productive collaborations across 
disciplines at UM, our highly 
decentralized 
structure 
and 

traditionally defined departments 
limit our ability to take full 
advantage of our large investment 
in faculty and infrastructure in 
this vital domain of scholarship,” 
a statement released by the panel 
read.

When he originally appointed 

Marshall Runge as EVPMA in 
November 2014, Schlissel said 
he made the recommendation 
based on his accomplishments 
as a scientist, doctor and leader. 
In 
September, 
Schlissel 
said 

appointing Runge to the deanship 
is logical because of the emphasis 
he places on innovation and 
progress.

This shift in leadership comes 

at a time when UMHS is looking 
to create a more collaborative 
environment to make way for 
greater 
achievements 
in 
the 

biosciences.

Neuroscience Prof. Huda Akil, 

a panel member, said she believes 
the panel was a good first step 
in planning how to build on the 
advantages that the University 
already has.

“Nobody can do this in a 

vacuum,” she said. “You could 
never duplicate all the strengths 
and weaknesses that already exist. 
You can just build around them and 
hope at the same time you can find 
new direction.”

Panel member Tom Schmidt, 

professor 
of 
ecology 
and 

evolutionary biology, said though 
the panel made recommendations 
about how to improve biosciences 
at the University, no decisions were 
made on the ultimate methods.

“That’ll be the next phase — 

how do we address some of these 
barriers that the panel identified?” 
Schmidt said.

One way the University is 

addressing 
those 
challenges, 

Schmidt said, is by fostering a closer 
relationship between UMHS and 
the Medical School, as illustrated 
by Runge’s dual position.

“We have tremendous strength 

in the biological sciences, and so 
how do we better coordinate that 
and take advantage of it?” Schmidt 
said. “Having the dean and the vice 
president for medical affairs be the 
same person, I think, will help with 
that.”

Sally Camper, chair of the 

Department of Human Genetics, 
wrote in an e-mail interview that 
some faculty members worry 
UMHS may be inefficient while 
Runge adjusts to his additional 
role. For example, Camper’s term 
as chair is nearing an end, and 
she’s worried the search for a 
replacement could be stalled.

“I think there is a fear that it 

will slow things down,” Camper 
wrote. “But his office has already 
contacted 
me 
about 
forming 

a 
search 
committee 
for 
my 

replacement, and he aims to fill it 
quickly.”

Medical School student Brendan 

Heiden applauded the move to 
combine the positions. He said 
he thinks the changes would be 
positive, though perhaps slow to 
occur. He added that it would be 
beneficial for UMHS and Medical 
School to work together in the 
changing healthcare landscape.

“I think medicine is changing 

rapidly 
right 
now,” 
Heiden 

said. “From a research funding 
perspective, 
from 
a 
health 

insurance perspective, the rising 
costs of patient care, all of that is 
changing tremendously. Being able 
to tie those two components of the 
health system together would be 
very beneficial for all those areas.”

However, 
Heiden 
said 
he 

recognized the transition might be 
difficult.

“I think that the one challenge 

here is that these are two very big 
positions for one person to have, so 
I think that the only tentativeness 
that one could take from this is how 
much one individual will have to 
oversee,” he said.

Akil noted that with all of this 

change, it will still be a waiting 
game to see how the implications of 
the panel come to light. She said the 
panel left room for interpretation, 
and it is up to Schlissel and the 
administration to make decisions 
based on the recommendations.

“The 
panel’s 
goal 
was 
to 

envision possibility,” Akil said. “To 
put that in front of the president, 
administration and the regents 
and to see which path they need to 
choose. We did not try to impose 
one single approach as the only way 

to do it.”

LSA senior Alexandra Laps 

said 
she 
believes 
pre-medical 

undergraduate students are already 
attracted to both the University’s 
hospital and Medical School, so 
this restructuring can only further 
the University’s high standing with 
matriculating students.

“In terms of converging the 

hospital and Medical School more 
together, I think that people will 
be able to get a lot more clinical 
experience early on in Med School,” 
she said. “This is something that, 
especially me, in going through 
the process am definitely attracted 
to and would consider when I’m 
looking at a Med School. I also think 
that it will probably open up more 
opportunities for undergrads to 
get involved in clinical experience 
while they’re at Michigan in order 
to better prepare them for Med 
School.”

Though the panel will not meet 

again, Akil and Schmidt said they 
believe its goals were achieved. 
Akil said surveying the strengths 
and weaknesses of the University 
was their mission, and she believes 
they did just that.

Schmidt 
said 
the 
various 

departments represented in the 
panel all contributed to the final 
recommendations.

“We wanted a diversity of 

opinion and we wanted to have 
the 
strengths 
across 
campus 

recognized,” he said. “There were 
people there who were able to 
speak about the museums, the 
biological station, chemistry — how 
advances in chemistry are affecting 
the biological sciences. We wanted 
that diversity of expertise to weigh 
in on this because I think that’s 
Michigan’s strength and how we’ll 
achieve this goal is by building 
bridges that connect some of these 
people and areas of expertise.”

Kristen 
Verhey, 
associate 

professor 
of 
cellular 
and 

developmental biology, said UMHS 
needs change, particularly in its 
culture.

“What is clear is that the overall 

culture here needs to change,” 
Verhey said. “And I think just 
recognizing that and putting it in 
paper is the first step, and therefore 
I believe that it is going to be a good 
thing.”

Scott Barolo, director of the 

University’s Program in Biomedical 
Sciences, said as of now, he does not 
know of any obvious changes that 
will occur to graduate education. 
He added that he is optimistic 
about the panel’s report, as it seems 
likely the University will increase 
support for the sciences.

Verhey added that basic support 

for research and faculty was 
lacking under past leadership, 
and she hopes the restructuring 
will create a more encouraging 
environment.

vendors, contract workers and 
temporary workers, will now have 
to get a vaccination.

“This year we have improved 

the policy to better ensure that our 
patients remain safe while in our 
care,” Masson said.

Employees who receive medical 

or religious exemptions will have 
to wear face masks before entering 
patient care areas throughout the 
flu season.

Influenza causes millions of 

infections and thousands of deaths 
every year in the United States. 
The virus can survive on hard, 
non-porous surfaces for hours to 
days depending on environmental 
factors. It can be contagious a 
day before symptoms appear and 
remain contagious for five to seven 
days after symptoms emerge.

UMHS employees can get their 

flu vaccinations at free clinics 
throughout 
October, 
several 

of which are offered through 
Occupational 
Health 
Services 

in the Med Inn Building. For all 
other members of the University 
community, the University Health 
Service 
provides 
appointments 

for flu shots. The University 
is 
currently 
participating 
in 

the College and University Flu 
Vaccination 
Challenge 
against 

schools across the state such as 
Michigan State University and 
Wayne State University.

Avoidance and tales of adulthood
M

y pedometer is an opti-
mist. It always says that 
I am running, when in 

reality 
I 
just 

walk very quick-
ly. While I know 
this should have 
no effect on my 
day, it hurts to 
have the application on my phone 
telling me another way in which I 
am a failure. To its movement-sens-
ing technology, I appear to be the 
world’s slowest runner.

The point is not the many ways 

in which I fail or my actual running 
speed, but to ask myself: Why am 
I always in such a hurry? While I 
have a schedule full of classes, work 
and meetings, so does every other 
student at the University. Yet, it is 
only some students who walk like 
someone trying to race a bicycle, 
outrun adulthood or perform some 
more difficult feat.

I am almost always 15 minutes 

early to class. I don’t know why. I 
think I am worried that I will for-
get where I am going or I will for-
get my homework and have to give 
myself enough time to run back and 
retrieve it. Neither of these things 
has ever happened. I use the extra 
time to walk across the Diag and 
back or take a lap around the MLB.

When I am at home with my fami-

ly, we go on walks down the dirt road 
we live on. Since I can remember, I 
have found myself at least 20 strides 
ahead of the pack (a small pack, 
that is). During walks, my (hilari-
ous) dad often shouts up to me to 
ask how the weather is. Sometimes, 
after turning around to stick out my 
tongue, I reassure myself that I like 
to stretch my legs with the fast pace. 
Other times, I reassure myself that I 
like the space between us to think. 

And when I’m not doing that, as my 
(brilliant) twin sister hustles to stay 
beside me, I tell myself I just have to 
beat her at this one thing.

But 
that 
(obviously 
insane) 

determination does not exist for me 
here. I do not have a person to irra-
tionally compete against, nor is it 
that difficult to find a place to think 
(well, it is a 
little). And that 
excuse 
about 

short legs? I am 
5-foot-4; 
my 

legs stretch eas-
ily, they have to 
stretch to reach 
the ground as I 
get out of bed in 
the morning.

Then 
why 

am I in a hurry 
at home? Why 
would anyone be in a hurry in the 
Upper Peninsula of Michigan? There 
is not much reason to rush; life there 
is slow and patient. I would say I 
am racing to leave, but that would 
be hurtful, slightly untrue and 
would not explain the issue here. I 
think the best way I could describe 
what I was trying to do was a joke I 
made earlier. Maybe I try to outrun 
adulthood, like maybe if I run more 
quickly then it cannot touch me.

This is something I see students, as 

well as other members of the Univer-
sity community, try to do every day. 
Everyone has coping mechanisms. 
People oversleep or never sleep. They 
bury themselves in Netflix. They 
drink way too much. The other day, 
some friends of mine from high school 
drove the eight hours to Ann Arbor 
just to go to the Briarwood Mall, walk 
around the Diag and leave. On Mon-
day, my friend Haley told me, eagerly 
yet firmly, that time does not exist. I 

avoid adulthood by walking quickly, 
because if I am always moving, always 
between destinations, I am nowhere. 
You cannot be an adult if you are 
nowhere, Haley convinced herself.

But now that I can identify the 

problem, I can admit a worse fate than 
the denial of adulthood: accepting it. 
The other day, one of my classmates 

asked my Spanish 
teacher how old 
he was, and my 
teacher sucked in 
his cheeks before 
bashfully admit-
ting, 24 (but it 
was in Spanish, 
so make sure you 
read it “veinticu-
atro”). Then he 
said he felt old. I 
wanted to shake 
him, to tell him 

he was young, so close to my age 
that if we were dogs we would be the 
same. I wanted to tell him to slow 
his embrace of responsibility and he 
should stay and explore with us, but 
I am not that good at speaking Span-
ish and he already thinks I am odd.

Something I have been realizing as 

I get older is that no one ever knows 
what they are doing. Yeah, think of 
that next time you get into a car with 
your parents or have surgery or ask 
your GSI a question. It is scary. But, 
it also puts us all on a similar level. 
Not to say you are smarter than your 
professors or Donald Trump (yes, 
in this case), but I want you to know 
that adulthood is not something you 
have to run away from or run toward. 
When you cross its path, acknowl-
edge that it means very little and 
walk calmly beside it.

— University President Mark Schlissel to reporters about the future of Greek life after 

speaking at the Detroit Economic Club on Tuesday afternoon. 

“

NOTABLE QUOTABLE

Unless … the students 

themselves moderate some of 
the risky behavior … they may 
naturally wither and people 

may want to stop joining 

(fraternities and sororities).”

When you cross 
adulthood’s path, 

acknowledge that it 
means very little.

O

n Sept. 30, Congress passed 
an emergency bill to keep 
the government running for 

another 10 weeks. 
If this bill had not 
passed, 
federal 

agencies 
would 

have run out of 
money 
within 

seven hours. Even 
more 
disturb-

ingly, more than 
half of Congres-
sional 
Repub-

licans 
voted 

against 
this 

bill in an effort 
to end federal 
funding for Planned Parenthood.

Contention over federal fund-

ing for Planned Parenthood and 
the deficit were among the possible 
factors that contributed to House 
Speaker John Boehner’s decision to 
step down from his position, which 
he announced on Sept. 25.

He has expressed a strong sense 

of commitment to addressing our 
government’s budget deficiencies 
before he leaves Congress. Boehner 
said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on 
Sept. 27, “I don’t want to leave my 
successor a dirty barn. I want to 
clean the barn up a bit before the 
next person gets there.” This indi-
cates that he will most likely push 
for a resolution to strengthen the 
standing of our nation’s finances.

However, on Oct. 1, Secretary of 

the Treasury Jacob Lew wrote in a 
letter to Boehner that we may face 
a dire debt crisis by November 5 
— in spite of the emergency resolu-
tion. Lew proclaimed in the letter: 
“Without sufficient cash, it would be 
impossible for the United States of 
America to meet all of its obligations 
for the first time in our history.”

He went on to explain that reach-

ing the legal debt ceiling of $18.1 
trillion would result in the U.S. 
government having $30 billion in 
working capital.

These 
factors 
suggest 
that 

Speaker Boehner’s efforts to clean 
out “the barn” are paramount to 
our country’s future. The govern-
ment shutdown of 2013, launched 
by House Republicans in response 
to failed efforts to repeal or amend 
the Affordable Care Act, damaged 
our economy. According to Stan-
dard & Poor’s, the 2013 federal 
shutdown cost the government $24 
billion and reduced fourth-quarter 
GDP growth by about 0.6 percent.

Despite the fact the government 

shut down in 2013, and may do so 
again in the near future, recent 
congressional sessions have not 
brought about the results to ensure 
long-term fiscal stability. If voters 
do not demand change for the stra-
tegic diminishment of debt, our 
generation will fully experience 
the consequences.

Indeed, as of Oct. 4, the U.S. 

national debt loomed above $18 tril-
lion, the debt per citizen greater 
than $57,100 and the debt per tax-
payer greater than $154,400. These 
numbers hint at a future of oppres-
sive financial burdens — burdens 
that these politicians probably will 
not live to experience. But these are 
burdens that we will deal with when 
foreign creditors, including the Chi-
nese and Japanese governments, 
demand payments. At the very least, 
this could mean diminished access 
to Social Security, Medicare and 
other federal government services 
that we will continue to pay for.

In terms of national debt, China 

and Japan each hold more than $1 
trillion of our national securities. 
China seeks to hold our treasur-
ies to peg its currency, the yuan, to 

our dollar. This helps the Chinese 
government lower the value of 
the yuan, making China’s exports 
more competitive in the foreign 
economy. The lower value of the 
yuan is a contributing factor in 
the decisions of many U.S.-based 
corporations to outsource manu-
facturing jobs to China, damaging 
the U.S. economy and workforce. 
Japan also buys U.S. treasuries to 
devalue their currency to enhance 
the attractiveness of their exports, 
such as cars, in American and 
other foreign marketplaces. These 
governments are being proactive 
in their support of production sec-
tors of their economies, while our 
government unsustainably spends 
abroad and neglects economic 
development at home.

Owing money to the Chinese gov-

ernment is concerning, considering 
that hackers sponsored by the Chi-
nese government procured millions 
of records of U.S. federal government 
employees. Additionally, the National 
Security Agency revealed that there 
have been nearly 700 successful 
hacking attempts by the Chinese gov-
ernment in the last five years aimed 
at U.S. corporations and individuals. 
This encroachment upon the cyber 
security of Americans connected to 
the government and national finan-
cial engines is not a good sign. The 
Chinese government has established 
leverage for future financial interac-
tions with the United States.

Evidently, the current status quo 

of borrowing and spending cannot be 
maintained. The time has come for 
Congress to take farsighted action 
to avoid these debt crises and loom-
ing government shutdowns, thereby 
ensuring stability for our generation.

A

t first glance, Carly Fiorina seems like a 
great role model for female leadership. 
She’s forceful and unapologetic, and her 

shining presence against the 
backdrop of male candidates 
hints at a future of equal 
gender representation in the 
government. She’s running 
the campaign I wish Hillary 
Clinton would run, exuding 
a “no-nonsense business-
woman” vibe while convey-
ing passion and sincerity in 
her causes. And she’s quick, 
too — her concise but sharp 
response at the most recent 
Republican debate obliter-
ated Trump’s misogynistic remark and left me 
cheering at my TV. Erin Gloria Ryan, managing 
editor of Jezebel, tweeted it best: “Carly Fiorina is 
an ice-cold shade queen debate princess and I’m 
in love with and terrified of her.” 

It’s during these fleeting moments that I 

find myself drawn to Fiorina. I picture her in 
the Oval Office with her feet up on a desk, a 
badass lady president kicking butt and tak-
ing names. However, all it takes is for her to 
begin discussing her platform, and the spell 
is broken.

Fiorina’s 
policies 
unequivocally 
hurt 

women, especially those of lower socioeco-
nomic status and women of color. She’s led 
the assault against Planned Parenthood and 
openly opposes the Affordable Care Act, 
increased regulation of an equal wage, feder-
ally mandated paid leave and the federal mini-
mum wage — all issues that disproportionately 
impact women — yet repeatedly claims to 
have our best interests in mind. Though Fio-
rina’s encouragements for women to lean in 
and lead sound empowering on the surface, 
her failure to support concrete policies that 
enable women to do so ultimately make her 
feminist doctrine hollow.

I don’t doubt that Fiorina meets the most 

basic definition of a feminist: someone who 
believes in equal rights for men and women. 
But, when digging deeper, I’ve found that 
Fiorina’s calls for equality and empower-
ment are unsubstantiated.

Fiorina’s definition of feminism, one that 

she articulated in a piece published in June 
titled “Redefining Feminism: The State of 
Women in America,” is unconventional at 
best and detrimental to the cause at worst. 
Though Fiorina’s definition of a feminist — “a 
woman who lives the life she chooses” — may 
sound uplifting on the surface, it rests upon 
entirely misguided principles. Fiorina’s prop-

osition is narrow-minded because it fails to 
take into account the many obstacles Ameri-
can women face today. Some women aren’t 
in a position where they can make the best 
choices for themselves, and sometimes those 
choices are simply not easy to make. 

Through no fault of their own, some women 

are forced to make incredibly difficult deci-
sions that are unique to their gender, and the 
government has the ability to help support 
women through these decisions. The Family 
and Medical Insurance Leave Act, for example, 
does exactly that, by ensuring women have 
some income during family or medical leave. 
Paid leave is instrumental in helping women 
balance work and family, and mothers who take 
paid leave are more likely to stay in the work-
force after a pregnancy. This job security helps 
soften the blow of the classic career vs. family 
dilemma many women face, and allows moth-
ers to stay on track for promotions and leader-
ship positions even while pregnant. Simply put, 
guaranteed paid leave helps increase the num-
ber of women both in the workforce at large and 
in leadership positions — something that Fio-
rina herself says is a good thing in her column. 
Why then does Fiorina oppose a paid maternity 
leave requirement?

When Fiorina calls for the gutting of Planned 

Parenthood’s federal funding, an organiza-
tion that provides 2.7 million women and men 
affordable, reliable health care, she’s threaten-
ing many women’s ability to take care of them-
selves. When Fiorina claims that programs like 
SNAP (food stamps) “make it so difficult to 
strive for more,” when in reality, the program 
improves the long-term health outcomes of 
children, she’s threatening many women’s abil-
ity to care for their families. If Fiorina really 
thinks that feminism is all about women mak-
ing their own choices, why do her policies rob 
us of the opportunity to do so?

But even though Fiorina is a hypocrite, I still 

feel oddly drawn to her, constantly pivoting from 
fascination back to repulsion. Her clear articula-
tion of her views is refreshing; it’s unfortunate 
that the views themselves fail to support women. 
Though she fits certain dimensions of what we 
envision as a feminist leader, until Fiorina com-
mits to empowering and supporting all women 
through policy, she’s holding us back. It’s not that 
feminism is some elite club, or that the movement 
has become too “ideological,” like Fiorina claims. 
It’s that in order to be a feminist, you have to 
actively work to empower women. Fiorina’s poli-
cies do the opposite.

Dawkins looks to build 
upon freshman success

By LEV FACHER

Managing Editor

Ask Aubrey Dawkins if he 

expected to enter the 2015-16 
season as a player who’d racked 
up 
substantial, 
meaningful 

minutes against top-tier Big Ten 
competition during his freshman 
year. The sophomore guard won’t 
hesitate.

“No, I did not,” Dawkins said 

Friday before the Wolverines’ first 
practice of the season. “You could 
say it’s a blessing in disguise.”

While 
Dawkins 
benefited 

immensely from being thrown 
into the fire, the circumstances 
that led to his opportunity were 
far from ideal for the Michigan 
men’s basketball team. Junior 
guard Derrick Walton Jr. and 
senior guard Caris LeVert both 
succumbed 
to 
mid-season 

injuries, 
forcing 
then-junior 

Spike Albrecht to take over the 
leadership role in the Wolverines’ 
backcourt.

It also forced Dawkins and 

fellow freshman Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-Rahkman off the bench 
and into the limelight.

“Obviously, I always want the 

best for Caris,” Dawkins said. “I 
think he’s going to have a great 
season this year, and I can’t wait 
to see him back on the court. But 
yeah, it was a blessing in disguise. 
It happened, and I got better from 
it.”

The improvement during last 

season’s final months and over 
the summer has been readily 
apparent, even to the point that 
Michigan coach John Beilein 

singled out Dawkins this offseason 
as one of the Wolverines’ most 
improved players.

The extra attention Dawkins 

is dealing with could have added 
some level of extra pressure. But 
not so, he claimed — Beilein’s 
comments were flattering, but 
nothing more.

“It’s good to hear,” Dawkins 

said. 
“It’s 
good 
positive 

reinforcement.”

Dawkins added inches to his 

vertical and improved his handle 
during his summer in Ann Arbor, 
which gave him the opportunity to 
work out in a calmer environment 
than the frenzied winter months 
on campus.

“It was great,” Dawkins said. 

“Much more relaxed. Campus is a 
little more quiet. It was fun, (and) 
I got a lot better.”

Despite 
the 
physical 

improvements, 
Dawkins 
cited 

a heightened basketball IQ as 
his most substantial gain of the 
offseason.

“There’s no need to rush,” he 

said. “Coming in as a freshman, 
I was kind of deer in the 
headlights. You’re shocked — you 
want to play as fast as you can. 
But you don’t need to do that. In 
slowing down and just making 
smart plays is where I think I 
grew the most.”

Between spending the summer 

on campus and working at Adidas 
Nations camp in early August, 
the sophomore said his father 
— Stanford head coach Johnny 
Dawkins — didn’t get the chance 
to see him play in a formal setting 
over the offseason.

Dawkins 
said 
not 
much 

has changed in terms of their 
dynamic, a hybrid of father-son 
and coach-player relationship, 
even though he now has a season 
of Division I competition under 
his belt.

“Same old, same old,” Dawkins 

said. “(He’s) always giving me 
teaching points, telling me what 
I need to get better at. That’s how 
it’s always going to be.”

The 
three-hour 
time 

difference makes staying up 
to date tougher for the elder 
Dawkins, but his son said the 
Cardinal’s 
eighth-year 
coach 

manages to record all of the 
Michigan games, nonetheless. 

As much as seeing Aubrey earn 

substantial minutes at shooting 
guard last season must have been 
a pleasant surprise for the entire 
Dawkins 
family, 
Michigan’s 

budding star is showing no 
signs 
of 
complacency. 
With 

the unexpected advantage of 
experience, a bolstered vertical 
jump, a higher basketball IQ and 
a less-frenetic on-court mindset, 
a breakout sophmore season for 
Dawkins wouldn’t come as a 
surprise. 

There’s only one problem: 

LeVert, Walton and a plethora 
of other capable guards are all 
expected to be fully healthy 
and ready to contribute for a 
Michigan squad that could have 
at least a dozen players earn 
substantial time on the floor. 
Nobody is immune to the battle 
for minutes, but Dawkins is as 
well-positioned as anybody else 
to earn his time.

Michigan wins thriller

Wolverines 

victorious despite 
trailing early in 

match

By JESSE KLEIN 

Daily Sports Writer

After rallying for a tough 

3-2 win over Michigan State 
last Wednesday, the Michigan 
volleyball team traveled to Iowa 
City hoping to dominate from 
the start rather than play from 
behind. But the Wolverines got a 
taste of déjà 
vu as they 
once again 
rallied 
from a 2-0 deficit for another 3-2 
victory.

In the first set, Michigan (3-2 

Big Ten, 13-3 overall) hit a slump 
due to changes in the starting 
rotation. Iowa (0-5, 10-8) held 
a narrow lead before Michigan 
redshirt junior outside hitter 
Ally 
Davis 
and 
Michigan 

sophomore 
middle 
blocker 

Claire Kieffer-Wright cut the 
lead with four kills each.

But it wasn’t enough to fend 

off the Hawkeyes, who stayed 
ahead the entire set and won it, 
25-23.

The Wolverines held on for 

the first half of the second set by 
tying it up at seven before Iowa 
went on a 4-0 run. Michigan 
called a timeout in hopes of 
reigniting its offense as the 
Hawkeyes continued to stretch 
their lead. The timeout was 
ineffective, though, as Iowa 
scored six straight points to take 

the second set, 25-13.

“Tonight we had to change 

our lineup a lot because of some 
injuries, so it took us a while to 
find a combo that worked,” said 
Michigan coach Mark Rosen. 
“We kept changing all night.”

One 
of 
those 
injuries 

included sophomore defensive 
specialist Caroline Knop, the 
only Wolverine who had played 
in every set of every match this 
season. 

“She was a real point of 

emotional 
and rotational 
stability 
for 

us,” 
Rosen 

said. 
“So 

tonight, 
everyone had 
to step up.” 

The 
third 

set 
started 

out to be more 
of the same with a 4-1 run by 
Iowa. However, Michigan’s next 
timeout was more successful, 
as the team regrouped before 
scoring five straight points.

“No one was making eye 

contact (in the first two sets),” 
Kieffer-Wright 
said. 
“Our 

captain said that we should find 
someone to make eye contact 
with after every point, and 
then communication started to 
increase.”

But Iowa battled back to gain 

a 21-20 advantage. Two straight 
kills from junior middle blocker 
Abby Cole while facing match 
point tied the score at 24 and 
kept Michigan from succumbing 
to defeat. 

The Wolverines refused to 

give up. A kill by Davis, a block 
by Cole with help from senior 

setter Carly Warner and an Iowa 
error forced the Hawkeyes to 
call a time out. Michigan then 
fought off four match points 
to win the third set, 28-26, and 
avoid a shutout.

The 
combined 
efforts 
of 

Kieffer-Wright and Cole helped 
Michigan dominate the fourth 
set and take a 25-21 win. Davis 
and Cole totaled double-digit 
kills and Kieffer-Wright tallied 
a career high of 12.

“It couldn’t have been a more 

competitive 
atmosphere 
to get a career 
high,” Kieffer-
Wright 
said. 

“Our 
setters 

put us in really 
good situations 
to get kills.”

The 

Wolverines 

finally seemed to be in a groove 
as they tied the game with two 
sets apiece.

In the decisive set, the lead 

continued to change back and 
forth between Michigan and the 
Hawkeyes, but neither was able 
to take control. Cole proved just 
as effective on defense, teaming 
up with Warner once again to 
fend off an aggressive Iowa 
attack.

Though Iowa fought off two 

match points, the Wolverines 
had just enough stamina to 
outlast the Hawkeyes to win 
the match point, 15-13. The 
Wolverines once again won 
three straight sets to come out 
victorious. 

“We find a way to win,” Cole 

said. “If it’s ugly or it’s pretty, it 
doesn’t matter.”

‘M’ ties Notre 
Dame on road

Wolverines draw 
against top-10 foe 
for the second time 

this season

By RILEY NELSON 

Daily Sports Writer

With two seconds left in 

double 
overtime, 
sophomore 

goalkeeper Evan Louro snatched 
the ball out of the air, saving the 
Michigan men’s soccer team 
from a last-
minute 
defeat.

It 
was 

one of the career-high eight 
saves Louro made Wednesday, 
helping the Wolverines to a 1-1 
draw at No. 7 Notre Dame.

The draw marks Michigan’s 

second against a top-10 team 
this season, and the Wolverines 
remain unbeaten in their last 
five games. Expectations were 
high ahead of 
the 
matchup 

with 
the 

Fighting Irish, 
so 
Michigan 

was uncertain 
about how the 
game 
would 

play out.

“They’re 
a 

good 
team,” 

said Michigan coach Chaka 
Daley. “We’re a good team (too), 
so our expectations were to go in 
and win the game. It was a good 
result. We got a point on the road 
at Notre Dame, who is ranked 
high up in the NCAA.”

The Wolverines (2-0-2 Big 

Ten, 5-2-3 overall) had a quick 
start with many scoring chances 
in the opening minutes of the 
game, but it took until the 23rd 
minute for them to score their 
lone goal.

Freshman midfielder Francis 

Atuahene slotted the ball into 
the right side of the net off a 
pass 
from 
fifth-year 
senior 

midfielder Colin McAtee, who 
was positioned just outside the 
box. Atuahene leads the team in 
scoring and has netted a goal in 
each of the last five matches.

With two minutes left in the 

first half, the Fighting Irish 
scored after a long ball beat the 
Michigan defense and wound up 
at the feet of forward Thomas 
Ueland, who finished off the 
play by putting the ball into the 
net.

The rest of the game was 

dominated by tight defense and 
stellar goalkeeping from both 
sides.

“I think defensively, (junior 

defender Lars Eckenrode, junior 
defender Andre Morris) and 
certainly (Louro) down the 
stretch did an outstanding job 
of keeping things solid,” Daley 
said.

Louro had two noteworthy 

saves in the second half. One 
came in the 77th minute, when a 
Notre Dame player had a point-
blank shot from the middle of 
the box, which Louro grabbed.

“Every game, he’s kept it 

solid,” Daley said. “He had an 
opportunity to make some saves, 
and certainly he helped change 

the game.”

With three 

and 
a 
half 

minutes 
left 

in regulation, 
the 
Fighting 

Irish 
were 

awarded a free 
kick 
after 
a 

controversial 
penalty. 
The 

shot was placed in the lower left 
corner, but Louro was there in 
time to save the Wolverines once 
again.

“Obviously Notre Dame is a 

good team,” Louro said. “We 
have confidence in ourselves 
that we can go in and win games 
like that. We settled for a point, 
but if the opportunity came to 
win the game, we were going to 
take it. But we weren’t going to 
give up a point.”

With an arduous sudden-

death game now behind them, 
Michigan’s main priority these 
next few days is to get rest ahead 
of its game against Rutgers on 
Saturday.

“The main thing now is to 

recover,” Louro said. “We’re 
playing for the same thing: three 
points.”

Michigan already searching for next Blake O’Neill

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

Michigan 
football 
special 

teams coordinator John Baxter 
said Wednesday that he is well 
into his search for fifth-year 
senior 
punter 

Blake O’Neill’s 
replacement.

O’Neill, who grew up playing 

Australian rules football, has 
been stellar for the Wolverines 
this season. Through five games, 
he is averaging 40.7 yards per 
punt and has stuck 11 punts 
inside opponents’ 20-yard lines. 
Naturally, replacing him won’t 
be easy.

“Punter is the hardest position 

on your whole football team to 
find,” Baxter said. “There is no 
skill set anywhere, in any sport 

that youth play in this country, 
that has you drop a rhomboid 
spheroid flat and try to hit it with 
your foot.”

Baxter noted that kids in 

Australia 
grow 
up 
playing 

catch by punting, rather than 
throwing, and though he is still 
scouting punters in the United 
States, the Australian skill set 
makes it a fertile ground for 
recruiting.

“What do you do when the 

current farm isn’t yielding the 
crops you need?” Baxter asked. 
“You 
expand 
your 
farming 

area.”

Baxter also commented on 

O’Neill’s 
athleticism, 
which 

helps 
explain 
why 
O’Neill 

took a chance to run the ball — 
unsuccessfully — on 4th-and-16 
in Michigan’s game against 

BYU. Baxter said his punter has 
the freedom to take off on any 
play.

The running threat adds an 

additional 
dimension 
to 
the 

Wolverines’ special-teams game, 
an aspect of the missed run 
Baxter seemed pleased about.

“If people know he’s going to 

run, I think that’s good for us,” 
Baxter said. “Because he’s gonna 
run. He has that option every 
time.”

OJEMUDIA’S 

REPLACEMENT: 
Michigan’s 

defense 
took 
a 
serious 
hit 

when senior linebacker Mario 
Ojemudia was ruled out for the 
season after injuring his achilles 
tendon against Maryland on 
Saturday.

Ojemudia is second on the 

team with six tackles for loss, 

trailing only redshirt junior 
defensive end Chris Wormley, 
who has seven.

And while Ojemudia’s talents 

won’t be easily replaced, there 
are 
many 

candidates 
to 

fill 
his 
spot 

at the BUCK 
position.

“(Senior 

linebacker 
Royce 
Jenkins-Stone) 
has played well 
with the snaps 
he’s 
had,” 

said defensive 
coordinator D.J. Durkin. “We’ll 
mix it around. We have some 
depth up front, so we have some 
guys that can do that, and we’ll 
play several guys there like we 

always do.”

Ojemudia and Jenkins-Stone 

have taken the bulk of the snaps 
at the BUCK position this season, 
with Jenkins-Stone making 12 

tackles, one for 
a loss.

Durkin was 

asked whether 
redshirt 
freshman 
defensive end 
Lawrence 
Marshall 
was 
in 
the 

fold for time 
at the BUCK 
position, 
but 

Durkin 
was 
noncommittal, 

merely noting that Marshall was 
a good player.

TULEY-TILLMAN 

CHARGES: Wednesday, former 

Michigan 
offensive 
lineman 

Logan 
Tuley-Tillman 
was 

charged with three felonies.

Tuley-Tillman 
is 
facing 

two counts of capturing and 
distributing an image of an 
unclothed person and one count 
of using a computer to commit 
a crime, the Ann Arbor News 
first reported. He was dismissed 
from the team on Sept. 10, but 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
did not specify a reason at the 
time, simply citing “conduct 
unacceptable for a Michigan 
student athlete.”

Tuley-Tillman 
joins 
Chris 

Fox (medical hardship), Kyle 
Bosch 
(transferred 
to 
West 

Virginia) and Dan Samuelson 
(transferring) as linemen in the 
2013 recruiting class who have 
left the program.

Michigan 
Hosts The Big 
House 5

By Jacob Rich
Daily Film Editor

enter 

I heard The Big House 5 before I saw it. 
 It was a cold, blustery Friday night in Dear-
born, and I was running late. The world’s sec-
ond biggest “Super Smash Bros.” tournament 
of all time was happening less than an hour 
from my hometown, and I couldn’t miss it. 
I ducked past the Royal Dearborn Hotel’s 
lobby into the nearby hallway to grab my me-
dia pass. There was a low rumble in the hall as 
I sauntered past groups of guys with badg-
es around their neck and GameCube control-
lers in their hands. The hall was alive with the 
sound of a crowd coming from the ballroom: 
cheers, chants and the occasional hoarse 
“let’s go” bounced off the walls and into my 
eardrums.
The second I finally set foot in the ball-
room, the place absolutely erupted. Under-
dog Massachusetts player MattDotZeb had 
just pulled off an insane kill on Westballz, one 
of the best Smash players in the world. It was 
the SoCal vs. Northeast crew battle, and the 
hype was off the charts. “The Big House” was 
immediately living up to its namesake. 
Indeed named after Michigan Stadium, The 
Big House is an annual Super Smash Bros. 
tournament organized by University alum 
Robin “Juggleguy” Harn. It’s “national,” 
[COPY: why put this in quotes?] which means 
that the best players from around the world 
are flying in to duke it out over trophies and 
cash prizes. 

“Juggleguy is the best TO (tournament or-
ganizer) ever. He schedules everything on 
the dot. Every single Big House has run ei-
ther on time or behind by a maximum of 30 min-
utes, which you cannot say about any other 
national, ever,” said University Engineering 
alum James “Duck” Ma.
Duck is widely regarded as the best Smash 
player in Michigan and one of the top 50 play-
ers in the world. A friend of Juggleguy’s, Duck 
credits him with the The Big House’s reputa-
tion of high quality.
“He graduated IOE (Industiral & Opera-
tions Engineering), actually, so this is pretty 
much what he does for work anyway. He’s the 
perfect combination of being likeable and be-
ing really anal, I guess. He’s not afraid to DQ 
people, which I think is huge, because it adds 
to sort of, like, the respect that people give 
him.”
To call The Big House noteworthy in the 
Smash scene would be a huge understate-
ment. The tournament managed to attract 
more than 2,000 attendees, [COPY: only fact 
i’m finding is that the hotel space can hold 
2,000+ people; can we verify this?] includ-
ing 1,317 entrants for “Melee” singles and 512 
for “Smash 4” singles. This was also the first 
Big House event to be officially sponsored by 
the notoriously stingy Nintendo, the devel-
oper and publisher of the Super Smash Bros. 
games. 

It’s not just the size and the sponsorships 
of The Big House that attracts so many play-
ers, though. The event has a distinct history 
of hype moments and rowdy crowds, immor-
talized in fan videos.
Most of the attendees over the weekend 
were hobby competitors, guys and girls who 
just love to play Smash for fun and wanted 
in on the action. Some of these guys, though, 
were career Smashers professionals paid 
big bucks by huge e-Sports organizations to 
play the game full-time. 
I ended up tracking down one of these pro-
fessionals, Kashan “Chillindude” Kahn, for a 
brief interview. A veteran competitive Me-
lee player, Chillin can be seen in some of the 
earliest tournament videos from the game’s 
grassroots beginnings. He’s sponsored by 
Team Liquid and was flown to Michigan on their 
bill from his home state of Virginia. 
“I think it’s amazing because there are so 
many people that don’t get to do what they 
love for a living, and I’m literally living the 
dream right now of doing what I love to do, 
which happens to be playing games. It’s also 
nice just because I had a lot of people when 
I was younger telling me I was wasting my time. 
You know, stop playing those games, stop 
wasting your time, and I’m like, oh, well now I’m 
making money off of it, so that’s definitely a 
cool feeling.”


2B — Thursday, October 8, 2015
the b-side
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

 On our way to the slightly 

quieter back of the room to talk, 
Chillin was stopped several times 
for pictures, autographs and even a 
“Hey, do you remember me?” from 
various members of the crowd. It 
was made clear by the dozens of 
glances he got on our short walk 
to the back that almost everyone in 
the room knew who he was. 

An atmosphere of celebrity 

pervaded The Big House that 
weekend. If you’re one of the best 
at the game, within these walls 
you’re a rock star. 

“It’s actually crazy because a 

couple years ago, it was just like, 
one or two people might come up 
to you throughout a whole tourna-
ment to either say ‘Hi,’ take a pic-
ture, sign their stuff or whatever. 
Now it happens almost constantly. 
It’s just a sign of how much the 
community has blown up in the 
past couple years, how quick the 
growth has happened.”

Indeed, the “Smash” competi-

tive scene has skyrocketed in pop-
ularity over the past few years. The 
top 10 biggest “Super Smash Bros. 
Melee” tournaments of all time all 
took place since 2013, even though 
the game has been around since 
2001. The Big House has increased 
in attendance so much each year 
that Juggleguy has had to relocate 
the event to a bigger venue every 
single year. 

So what is it that made “Melee” 

huge so recently? Chillin says that 
one of the big contributing fac-
tors was “The Smash Brothers,” a 
2013 documentary series about the 
great players of the early scene.

“It was crazy, because I never 

expected the documentary to 
actually get that big. I figured it 
might get maybe 10,000 hits on 
YouTube or something,” he said. 

“The Smash Brothers” series 

has accrued millions of views, 
overwhelmingly positive ratings 
and comments. Being a fan of the 
documentary already, I recog-
nized the film’s director, Travis 
“Samox” Beauchamp, recording 
footage around the event floor. 
He’s working on a feature-length 
sequel to his series, and he fre-
quently travels to the major com-
petitive events to film them.

“I really didn’t get into the 

‘Smash’ community until I discov-
ered how terrible I was at ‘Melee’ 
after my younger brother kicked 
my ass at it,” Beauchamp said. 
“And yeah, eventually he let me in 
on the big secret that there’s actu-
ally a game within the game. And 
that there’s a lot more to it than 
meets the eye. After he showed me 
MOAST 3, this spectacular show-
down between Ken and Isai, these 
two incredible players, I just got 

hooked. I had to learn everything 
I possibly could about this game, 
these players, their stories.”

I then brought up to him an 

anecdote or two about how his 
documentary 
had 
impacted 

“Smash” players I knew. I asked 
him how he felt about being able 
to make such an impact on peo-
ples’ lives. 

“It’s amazing,” he said. “I actu-

ally get a lot of e-mails all the time 
from people saying that, essen-
tially, the documentary helped 
them emotionally as well as get 
into the game just for fun. Just to 
have that kind of impact is a great 
feeling but that was never my 
intention. I just wanted to show 
the world that this great game 
was worth playing more and get 
more people back into it.”

I spoke with multiple play-

ers over the weekend that said 
that they started playing “Melee” 
specifically because of Samox’s 
documentary series. One of them, 
recent Michigan State graduate 
Josh “FendrickLamar” Fendrick, 
had just made it out of pools. This 
meant that out of the 1,317 players 
who entered the tournament, he 
made the top 256. 

“I want to be the best. As cliché 

as that is, I want to come into a 
national and make waves. I want to 
get wins. I wanna do the best that I 
can,” Fendrick said.

I tracked him down because I 

had previously seen him playing 
at Ann Arbor “Smash” events. A 
tall, boisterous guy, Fendrick cur-
rently works as a staff assistant for 
Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) in D.C. 
But when he’s not working, he’s 
Smashing. 

“While I’m sort of growing 

nationally in prominence through 
my commentary, I do consider 
myself a competitor first, so I 
really do want to be really, really 
good at this game,” Fendrick said. 
“So I’m putting in the time, going 
to as many tournaments as I possi-
bly can, like, there was a stretch of 
time from The Big House 4, which 
was early October to March where 
I went to at least one tournament a 
week. I put in the work. I was like, 
‘I want to get good at this game.’ ”

Fendrick was certainly loud and 

clear with his intent to win, but 
he wasn’t the only one with this 
caliber of intense sportsmanship. 
Duck also made clear his own per-
sonal drive to succeed. 

“I want to be good. I want to be 

the best, that’s the goal,” Duck said.

I asked Duck about his his-

tory with “Smash” and about 
what keeps him coming back to 
the community.

“The ‘Smash’ community is 

awesome 
because 
everybody 

feels like family,” he said. “Noth-
ing about you matters except for 
how you play the game, how good 
are you, do you really like playing 
the game … You can walk up to 
anybody at this venue and talk to 
them about ‘Smash’ for hours. It’s 
just something really cool. It’s just 
like, I separate it into ‘Smash’ life 
and real life.”

For him, this separation is key to 

his enjoyment of “Smash.” 

“For ‘Smash’ life at least, when 

you go to a national or you travel, 
you can basically just do whatev-
er you want. You have this other 
persona that you can sort of just 
walk into. And you get to just play 
the game, you don’t really have 
to worry about anything else. 
Nobody’s going to judge you for 
you know, anything other than 
did you win? Did you lose? Did 
you know about the game? It’s just 
cool to hang out with a big group 
of people that share your inter-
ests,” Duck said.

It became clear to me while 

watching Chillin, Duck, Fendrick 
and others compete through-
out the weekend that the biggest 
moments of hype didn’t appear 
simply from gameplay. They came 
from moments of personality and 
celebrity. Just like in the best 
sports rivalries, at The Big House 
there were heroes, villains, under-
dogs and dynasties. The best 
moments were when these larger-
than-life characters clashed and 
made noise. 

One of my favorite moments 

happened during the “Smash 4” 
Loser’s Semifinals, when New 
York player Anti came so damn 
close to ending the Chilean cham-
pion ZeRo’s (the undisputed best 
“Smash 4” player in the world) 
more than 50-tournament win-
ning streak. The tension in the 
crowd was palpable as Anti took 
two games out of the five-game 
set, only faltering in the end as 
ZeRo squeezed by to take the win 
in the final round. A young, fan-
favorite challenger almost took 
out the dynasty, and it was awe-
some. 

Another 
incredible 
moment 

was the entirety of the “Melee” 
grand finals Sunday night. At this 
point, the ballroom’s atmosphere 
changed from that of a gaming con-
vention with people milling about, 
to that of a sports arena. Everyone 
at the event was crammed into 
the room, and all eyes were on 
the enormous screens at the front, 
making the two competitors liter-
ally larger than life. 

Sweden’s 
Adam 
“Armada” 

Lindgren was facing off against 
Florida’s 
Juan 
“Hungrybox” 

Debiedma. Armada hadn’t lost 
a single match the entire week-
end. Hungrybox had only lost one 
match — to Armada, earlier that 
night. In that match, Armada had 
shown 
significant 
dominance, 

winning 3-0. 

Hungrybox wasn’t going to let 

that happen again. Through grit 
and determination, he went for 
broke and tied up the match, 2-2. 

The final game was a true clash 

of the titans. The crowd was on fire, 
reacting violently to every twist 
and turn happening onscreen. 
When Armada pulled out the stops 
and took the final victory, the place 
went wild again, like I had seen the 
moment I walked in, but amplified 
tenfold. A chant emanated through 
the hotel:

“AR MAH DAH! AR MAH 

DAH! AR MAH DAH!”

The Big House 5 was my favor-

ite live gaming event that I have 
ever been to, and I’ve been to cul-
tural gaming events and conven-
tions across the country. Once you 
get past the initial “otherness” of a 
packed room of guys competing in 
a 14-year-old video game, competi-
tive Smash becomes a maelstrom 
of competition and celebrity, deliv-
ering great moment after great 
moment of sports drama. It may 
not be athletic, but the competition 
is real. 

Next year, I won’t be covering 

The Big House 6. You’ll have to find 
someone else to write the story 
and do the interviews because I’m 
going to be on the ballroom floor, 
badge around my neck, GameCube 
controller in my hand.

Armada, I’m coming for you.

There is no denying that Ann 

Arbor, and the University that 
calls it home, is special and 
transformative. 
The 
unique 

energy of the city undoubtedly 
leaves a lasting impression on 
those students and residents 
lucky enough to tread these 
cultured streets.

This 
is 
the 
feeling 
that 

University alum and up-and-
coming 
musician 
Hannah 

Elizabeth has.

“I am obsessed with (the 

University of) Michigan; it’s really 
where music started for me,” 
Elizabeth said in an interview 
with The Michigan Daily.

Elizabeth grew up in West 

Bloomfield, 
Mich., 
a 
familiar 

town 
for 
many 
University 

students. Because of her suburban 
upbringing, Elizabeth felt it wasn’t 
until she was in college that she 
was truly free to express her art.

“I was too afraid to perform 

until people at school found a 
video of me and they just blew 
it up and told me I needed to 
perform around Ann Arbor,” she 
said. “It gave me the confidence, 
courage and support team to 
actually go about doing it, whereas 
in West Bloomfield I really did not 
perform much.”

Growing up, Elizabeth was shy 

about her interest in the music 
industry — so shy, in fact, that she 
wouldn’t even sing in front of her 
parents. Eventually, in middle 
school she began letting her 
parents in on her passion, asking 
them for guitar lessons and voice 
lessons. When she landed the lead 
in her school musical, Hannah’s 
parents realized their daughter’s 
talent and have been supportive 
ever since. Though making her 
musical talent did not come until 
later, Hannah’s love of music and 
drive to be a musician was present 
all her life.

“I’ve known early on that this 

is what I want to do,” Elizabeth 
said. “I would always be singing, 
I would be very attentive to the 
music, my dad showed me a bunch 
at a young age.”

Once Elizabeth was able to 

embrace her musicality, with 
the support of her friends and 
family, she began playing gigs all 
around town. Potbelly, the first 
place Elizabeth played in Ann 
Arbor, would often host open-mic 
nights. When the young singer-
songwriter asked a manager about 
performing, he set her up with her 
own private show.

“I would do a Potbelly show 

every year. I did a huge set, it was 
so fun,” Elizabeth said. “That’s 
really when I found my love for 
performing live.”

The songstress also performed 

at many of the University clubs 
and events, including Relay For 
Life, an annual event that raises 
money for cancer research and 
honors survivors.

“Survivors and people who 

were affected by cancer would 
speak and I was able to sing at that. 
It was definitely the most special 
performance I have ever done,” 
Elizabeth said. “People would 
tell these stories about loved ones 
passing from cancer and then I 
had to get up and sing. I would be 
bawling and then go on stage and 
sing. It was intense but I loved it.”

As a member of Greek life, she 

had access to a large network of 
students, other organizations and 

local charities, which she used to 
make her music known. During 
her time at school, she performed 
at Kappa Kappa Gamma’s Concert 
on the Lawn.

“I would utilize the Greek Life 

system to kind of make my own 
concert,” she said. “We started 
this Kappa concert thing on the 
lawn and we would raise money 
for charities. I would do stuff with 
Kappa that really helped.”

As far as Elizabeth’s musical 

tendencies, her music is poppy 
and radio-friendly, with a dark, 
emotive current running through 
it. The young artist doesn’t shy 
away from being associated with 
the mainstream, as she wants her 
art to be easily accessible to as 
many people possible. Even though 
she 
follows 
pop 
conventions, 

Elizabeth made it clear that her 
work is not a cookie-cutter copy of 
other popular icons.

“I would say that my music is 

under the pop umbrella, but it 
definitely has a more alternative, 
darker side,” she said. “I define 
myself as pop because I do want my 
music to be mainstream – whereas 
that’s not something that a regular 
indie artist would say. I want it to 
reach as many people as possible 
and if its gonna be mainstream, its 
gonna be mainstream. Obviously 
I want it to have my own personal 
touch to it, I don’t want it to be like 
any other pop artist.”

Elizabeth listens to any and 

all music, especially those female 
artists who share affinity for 
under 
the 
surface, 
brooding 

content. As a lyricist herself, she 
especially appreciates artists who 
share her passion for words and 
crafting lyrics.

“I pull from all different artists, 

all different genres. A lot of the 
artists that I really appreciate 
happen to be songwriters as well 
– Ryan Tedder of One Republic, 
he’s amazing and just whips out 
hit songs for so many other artists, 
and Sia is another person who just 
writes for everyone,” Elizabeth 
said. “I love Demi Lovato, Taylor 
Swift, Miley Cyrus (even though 
she’s insane). I think they’re very 
talented and it’s really inspiring 
to see people my age doing what I 
want to do.”

Following her passions post-

graduation, Elizabeth teamed up 
with the Artist Refinery, a start-up 
company based in Arizona. The 
goal of the Artist Refinery is to help 
blossoming artists define their 
sound, become better songwriters 
and to learn what it is like to be in 
the music industry – they help get 
up-and-coming musicians signed 
with a major record label.

“Basically, I went through this 

boot camp (in Phoenix), day-in-

the-life of what it takes to be an 
artist,” Elizabeth said. “I woke 
up at 5 a.m. to workout then I 
had three hours of choreography, 
voice lessons, and interview coach 
and studio time. It’s very small, 
it’s a start-up. I work with a team 
of producers, writers, I write for 
myself, they have a full on team.”

While 
working 
with 
the 

professionals 
at 
the 
Artist 

Refinery, Elizabeth pulled heavily 
from her background as an English 
major. Initially, Elizabeth did not 
see herself as a lyricist, but rather 
as someone with a literature focus. 
It was not until she was able to 
work with a song-writing team 
that she realized how beneficial 
her academic background would 
be in her art.

“I read all the time,” she said. “I 

think that the way that I was able 
to write was by finding my voice 
through these creative writing 
classes 
at 
Michigan. 
Getting 

the English degree was the best 
decision, cause I could just take 
my stories, basically like journal 
entries, and I could take those and 
form them into lyrics.”

In true English major fashion, 

Elizabeth draws inspiration from 
the words of others — poet Lang 
Leav, 
E.E. 
Cummings, 
Oscar 

Wilde, the list goes on.

“She’s like the Taylor Swift 

of poets, it’s just so relatable,” 
Elizabeth said of Leav.

The Refinery helped Elizabeth 

to flesh out the image of who she 
wants to be as an artist, all the 
while maintaining her personal 
voice. She feels strongly about the 
place that women hold in not only 
the music industry, but in society 
as a whole.

“The 
campaign 
that 
Demi 

Lovato is doing is very personal 
to me,” she said. “I really think 
that the whole body image, and 
people struggling with depression 
or emotional issues — I want that 
to be a topic of discussion. And I 
love how Demi really reps it and 
lets people know that its normal. 
Today’s beauty standards are 
absurd and that would definitely 
be my message.”

Going forward, Elizabeth looks 

forward to more live performances, 
the continued release of her music 
and, her main goal, getting signed 
to a major record label. Her latest 
single, “No Good,” was recently 
released and has a music video set 
to release on her YouTube page 
Oct. 8 for this latest track.

“I love performing live, I 

definitely see touring as the 
future. I don’t want to be another 
hopeful, starving artist. I want to 
get signed. I want people to hear 
this song. I want people to hear my 
music. I’m very determined.”

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

 The most underrated party 
jam of the summer finally gets a 
video, as Dej Loaf and Big Sean 
take a trip to a 
Detroit roller 
rink to dance 
and groove to 
“Back Up,” off 
Dej’s #And-
SeeThatsTheT-
hing EP.
 The roller 
rink setting 
is actually a 
pretty good substitute for the 
clubs where you’re most likely 
to hear “Back Up.” The bright 
colorful lights that cut through 
the dark fog sync surprisingly 
well with the song’s murky 
bass and the production’s airy, 
synthesized hook. Dej — who 
keeps creeping closer and clos-
er to mainstream success — 

still looks like no one else with 
her hair short, her sunglasses 
large and her camo No. 88 
jersey a size too big so it quali-
fies as a dress. All throughout, 
she’s backed up by a talented 
posse that makes skating and 
dancing look easy.
 It’s cool to see Sean in a neon 
green hoodie and black vest 
rapping against a multi-colored 
neon background (his guest spot 

separate from all the others, like-
ly because of tour commitments), 
and it’s nice to see Dej having 
fun back in her hometown, but 
“Back Up” ’s video, on the whole, 
doesn’t sink or elevate the song. 
The dancing and the rollerskat-
ing tricks are fun, but it’s the 
audio, not the visuals, that make 
it all memorable.

By KARL WILLIAMS

Online Arts Editor

The 
American 
Jewish 

experience 
has 
been 
most 

famously captured in great 
novels such as Saul Bellow’s 
“The 
Adventures 
of 
Augie 

March” 
and 
Philip 
Roth’s 

“American Pastoral.” However, 
Aviva Kempner — who attended 
the University and wrote for 
the Michigan Daily from 1965 
to 1969 and earned a Master 
of Arts in 1971— took another 
artistic route. During her time 
at the University, she sold 
tickets at the Michigan Theater, 
where 
her 
co-workers 
said 

“maybe someday you’ll show 
your films there.”

 An Emmy nominee and 

Guggenheim Fellow, Kempner 
wanted to make “films that talk 
about Jewish heroes.”

 “I always grew up loving 

cinema, and I had a lot of 
friends that were doing human 
rights in law school who were 
documentary filmmakers, and 
I really respected the format,” 
she said. “I think the stories that 
can be told in documentaries 
can really make a difference.”

Along with her filmmaking, 

Kempner is also the founder of the 
Washington Jewish Film Festival 
and the Ciesla Foundation.

Kempner’s 
journey 
to 

documentary 
filmmaking 

wasn’t straightforward. After 
her time at the University, she 
attended law school, but failing 
the bar exam (“I don’t do well on 
multiple choice questions,” she 
says), she decided to return to 
her Jewish heritage: “I decided 
I had to make a film about Jews 
fighting Nazis.” She began work 
in 1979, and in 1986 she produced 
her first feature film “Partisans 
of Vilna,” the story of Jewish 
men and women who created the 
partisan movement during World 
War II in Vilna, Lithuania.

Her films are not just about 

Jewish 
heroes, 
but 
“Jewish 

heroes fighting ‘isms.’ ” Similar 
to the fight against Fascism and 
anti-Semitism by the partisans 
in Europe, her Peabody Award-
winning 
second 
feature, 

“The Life and Times of Hank 
Greenberg” 
chronicles 
the 

life of Hank Greenberg who 

battled against American anti-
Semitism. Greenberg, one of 
the greatest Detroit Tigers and 
baseball players ever, was the 
first Jewish superstar athlete. 
His story was a predecessor for, 
and usurped by, that of Jackie 
Robinson. Unlike the majority of 
Major League Baseball players, 
Greenberg welcomed Robinson 
to the league, and he was one 
of the first to do so. Nicknamed 
“the Hebrew Hammer,” he was 
the idol of young Jewish boys 
across America. However, he 
faced heavy hostility from a 
predominantly white, working-
class audience, especially when 
he refused to play on Yom Kippur.

After “The Life and Times 

of Hank Greenberg,” Kempner 
directed a documentary on 
the life of radio and television 
personality 
Gertrude 
Berg, 

“Yoo-Hoo, 
Mrs. 
Goldberg.” 

Berg, who created and starred 
in the radio and television 
serials “The Goldbergs,” faced 
her own ’isms: sexism and 
McCarthyism.

Like 
a 
former 
ball 
boy 

who becomes a major league 
slugger, three of Kempner’s 
films have been shown at the 
Michigan Theater, including 
her latest “Rosenwald,” which 
was screened in September. 
After 
hearing 
famous 
civil 

rights 
activist 
Julian 
Bond 

— who features heavily in 
the film — speak about the 
intersection between Black and 
Jewish communities, Kempner 
thought, “My God! I have got to 
do this movie.”

The film documents the life 

of 
millionaire 
businessman 

and 
philanthropist 
Julius 

Rosenwald, who was both a 
partial owner and leader of 
Sears, Roebuck and Company. 
He 
founded 
the 
Museum 

of Science and Industry in 
Chicago, and the Rosenwald 
Fund, which provided matching 
donations to African American 
communities to build more than 
5,300 schools across the nation, 
though 
many 
were 
burned 

down. He also worked closely 
with famous educator Booker 
T. Washington. By funding 
the schools fully, he allowed 
the 
communities 
to 
work 

together to finish the funding. 

Furthermore, the foundation 
gave out hundreds of grants to 
African-American intellectuals 
in various fields. Described by 
Bond as a “who’s who of Black 
America,” recipients of the 
grants include Ralph Ellison, 
Marian Anderson, W.E.B. Du 
Bois, Gordon Parks, Dr. Charles 
Drew, Langston Hughes, Jacob 
Lawrence and Claude McKay.

Unlike 19th century industrial 

giants 
Andrew 
Carnegie 

and 
John 
D. 
Rockefeller, 

who have become American 
folklore, 
Julius 
Rosenwald 

has faded from history. It’s 
doubtful many outside of the 
Jewish community — or the 
generations 
after 
the 
fund 

dissolved in 1948 — are aware 
of the profound contributions 
and 
influence 
Rosenwald 

had on American society. As 
Kempner notes, he was a poor 
exemplar for the Gilded Age: 
“He was very modest and doing 
things without getting credit 
for it.” Rosenwald himself, who 
didn’t even finish high school, 
comically dispelled the mythos 
of the heroic entrepreneur. “Do 
not be fooled into believing 
that because a man is rich he 
is necessarily smart. There is 
ample proof to the contrary.”

 
Together 
with 
archival 

footage 
and 
clips 
from 

American movies — “I don’t 
just want talking heads” — 
Kempner 
interviewed 
the 

family members that have kept 
Rosenwald’s legacy alive. The 
documentary is a testament 
to the importance of keeping 
generational 
histories. 
“Go 

through oral histories. You 
never know when they’ll come 
in handy,” she advised.

Despite 
the 
nearly 
100 

years that have passed since 
Rosenwald’s 
death, 
his 

story 
remains 
relevant 
for 

contemporary America.

“There’s 
so 
many 
issues 

and after effects from the 
Jim Crow era, there’s a lot of 
lessons to be told in this film 
about what we need to do,” 
Kempner said. “Communities 
can work together. We can 
make a difference, and all of 
us have some J.R. in us. We’re 
all responsible for improving 
people’s lives.”

SINGLE REVIEW

 Another heavy helping of nos-
talgia, lyrical madness and intri-
cate musicality has been served 
up in the third 
single, “Paul 
is Alive,” off 
the upcoming 
collaborative 
effort by The 
National’s 
frontman, Matt 
Berninger, and 
Brent Knopf of 
Menomena and 
Ramona Falls. 
This artistically experimental 
group, titled EL VY, is set to 
explode at the end of October.
 From the song’s very first 
plucked notes and cleared throat, 
“Paul is Alive” buries the listener 
in waves of nostalgia. Berninger 
sings of a “sugar-coated child-
hood” lying far back in the past 
now, back there in a place where 
his mother’s favorite band, The 
Beatles, wasn’t broken up and 
half dead. Despite the gloomy 
narration of Berninger’s monoto-

nous vocals, a voice that sits us 
down in the favorite jockey club 
of his 16-year-old self where he 
first found The Cramps and The 
Smiths and cried into his 7-Up, 
EL VY quietly, and elegantly, 
juxtaposes this lyrical heaviness 
to the light and layered nature of 
the song’s instrumentations.
 As the song progresses, lyri-
cally and sonically, the sedated 
pleasure that Berninger has for 
the past envelopes the song. The 
music ebbs and flows upward, 
building from the simple chord 
progressions from which it 
started as the lyrics concurrently 
grow in depth and inner conflict. 
Now that the older Berninger 
is aware of the unchanging 
velocity of the present, and the 
constant nostalgia for the past, 
he can remain aware (and numb) 
in his current reality. “Nobody 
stays above, out in the waves 
of love,” he sings. The only 
solace to be found was back in 
with his 16-year-old self, hair 
slicked back and teary-eyed 

with a 7-Up in hand, where 
“inside the jockey club, I’m 
even with heaven.”
 The depth of the lyrical sto-
ryline in EL VY’s new “Paul is 
Alive” is so haunting and mov-
ing, but as Berninger’s syrupy 
vocals glide from verse to verse, 
pouring on the nostalgia until 

the listener is drowning, the 
uneducated or non-fan of The 
National may lose interest. But 
to them I say, build some taste 
and emotional depth. But to the 
highly talented men of EL VY, I 
say, you’re depressing me.

An Evening of Scenes?

in this series, three daily arts writers in 

varying states of mind visit the same 

place and write about their experiences.

baked.buzzed.bored.

this week’s destination:

Honestly, I don’t remember a fair amount of it. Time seems to have compounded into itself. Funny how it 

does things like that. “Evening of Scenes” is a collection of short comedy sketches written and direct-

ed by students in the Residential College. The first one was about a classroom of students who 

are emotionally manipulated by a girl named “Samantha Jones.” Do they know that’s 

the name of Carrie Bradshaw’s puny and sexually adventurous best friend on 

hit ’90s sitcom “Sex and the City?!?” They moved on to a skit personify-

ing the characters from the board game Clue, showing the vapid 

monopoly characters as people with financial motives. As 

to be expected from the Residential College, the 

play contained unsubtle hints of sarcasm 

scoffing at a capitalist society.

Things are NOT moving in real 

time right now. Readers, I have not been 

this high in QUITE some time. In Australia, 

where I am considering studying abroad, they would 

say I am “off my head!” I have been doing a fair amount 

of research on Australian slang. OK, third scene with the kin-

dergarteners was on point and that’s not just something I would say 

because maybe I have some best friends in the scene. It really was very 

funny and capitalized on the absurdness of a power-hungry child, while inter-

jecting the scene with short interactions of a father being excluded from a playgroup 

clique based on his gender. Commentary! We ended with a couponing show sketch that was 

positively overrun by gingers, not that there’s anything wrong with that. Red is a color of power 

so technically red hair should actually be more sexually appealing to us than other hair colors. While 

viewing the play, I was unaware of an actual couponing show, but apparently it exists. So while I believed 

during the show that it subverted reality to create a film of echoey obstruction, it actually REINFORCED the 
concepts of fatuous chaos that we have chosen to revel in as a society.

—DAILY ARTS WRITER

This theater is a lot smaller than expected. Someone’s 

perfume smells like old lady. This is how I perish. Why is 
theater so funny? Why can I not do that? Why did I not bring 
a drink for the road? Apparently monopoly is the only Ayn 
Rand endorsed board game. Cool. There’s this whole scene 
about killing Caesar and literally all I can think about is in 
mean girls when Gretchen Wieners (daughter of the inven-
tor of toaster strudel) freaks out and is like “WHY DON’T 
WE JUST STAB CAESAR?!” I relate to this awkward, gawky 
suburban dad way more than I should. Oh my sweet Jesus 
they brought back the Harry Potter puppet song ... I am weak 
... with joy. Seventy-five percent of the people in this sketch 
are red heads. I wonder if they’ll make a joke about it. (They 
did) All these people are so witty and talented. What if I 
started doing a standing ovation every time I got an article 
published. That would be too much. I’ll stick to what I know 
and let the real ac-tòrs do what they do.

—DAILY ARTS WRITER

I had no clue where I was even going tonight before we 

got here. I need to stop blindly committing to things, 
but this one really paid off. We’re on the second 
act and they’ve covered my three favorite things: 
weird celebrity obsessions, Clue the board 
game and the phrase “yas kween.” Not too 
shabby for a sober Friday night. Maybe I 
should do this kind of stuff more often.

Ahh now is the fourth act and one of 

our Daily Arts writers is on stage. #Rep-
resent. The delivery has been fantastic, 
a well-performed mix of slapstick and 
sharp humor. The range in topics and 
length of individual skits kept the eve-
ning moving along in a fashion that didn’t 
allow for dips in engagement. Even the 
intermissions were expertly played. Who-
ever chose to play “Harry Potter Puppet 
Pals” during the intermission deserves end-
less high-fives because I am dying.

RC Players is something I will definitely be 

attending again (you should too), and this time all 
I can hope for is that if there’s another scene about 
killing Julius Caesar (most likely, there won’t be) and 
someone will make a Gretchen Weiners reference.
