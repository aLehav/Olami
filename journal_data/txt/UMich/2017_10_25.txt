ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Tim 
Retzloff, 
professor 

of history at Michigan State 
University and University of 
Michigan 
alum, 
connected 

LGBTQ history at the University 
of Michigan to the University’s 
bicentennial year in his lecture 
Tuesday, 
“Maize, 
Blue, 
and 

Lavender: 
Revisiting 
U-M’s 

LGBTQ Past.”

As an undergraduate, Retzloff 

was asked by a political science 
professor to write a history 
appendix of LGBTQ history in 
Michigan. 
Implementing 
The 

Daily’s records, as well as bits 
and pieces from other Michigan 
newspapers, 
he 
wrote 
an 

appendix titled “Outcast, Miscast, 
Recast: A documentary history 
of lesbians and gay men at the 
University of Michigan.”

Retzloff, a guest of the Institute 

for Research on Women and 
Gender, 
graduated 
from 
the 

University of Michigan in 2006 
before getting his Ph.D. in history 
from Yale University in 2014. He 
has been featured on Stateside of 
Michigan Radio and The Craig 
Fahle Show on WDET. The event 
was also sponsored by several 
departments in the University, 
including the LSA Bicentennial 
Theme Semester program, and 
was attended by 30 students. 

Gayle Rubin, an associate 

professor of anthropology and 
women’s 
studies, 
introduced 

Retzloff, noting the importance 

of the event’s inclusion in the 
Bicentennial, since knowledge of 
LGBTQ history at the University 
is very limited.

Throughout the discussion, 

Retzloff 
presented 
different 

pictures to pinpoint three main 
eras central to LGBTQ history: 
the modern era (1991 to present), 
the ’70s and ’80s, and the pre-
Stonewall era. Retzloff focused on 
periods in which the University 
adapted to accept, or at least 
tolerate, 
LGBTQ 
individuals. 

He also discussed points when 

LGBTQ people faced extreme 
isolation.

“The outcast portion (of the 

append) … reflected the official 
hostility of the University toward 
homosexual people and reflected 
how people that we now see as 
LGBTQ were outcasts,” Retzloff 
said.

Retzloff discussed in detail 

the effects of the 1959 and 1960 
crackdowns at the University on 
homosexual activity that occurred 
in various campus restrooms. 
Reminiscent of the Communist 

era, people staked down men 
engaging in sexual behavior in the 
bathroom and then arrested them 
for gross indecency. According 
to Retzloff, they were sentenced 
to five years of probation and 
had to pay a $275 fine. This was 
a particularly harsh punishment, 
he noted, as others charged with 
gross indecency in Detroit at this 
time had to pay much less. 

Further 
troubles 
arose 
in 

2003, Retzloff said, as the records 
of the crackdowns and other 
Central Student Government 

convened on Tuesday evening to 
discuss the renaming of the C.C. 
Little Building, eventually passing 
the resolution to support the name 
change.

After 
efforts 
from 
student 

governments on campus, stemming 
from LSA Student Government, 
steps have been taken to discuss 
the name change of the academic 
building. The C.C. Little Building 
has a controversial past, due to its 
attribution to former University of 
Michigan President Clarence Cook 
Little and his role in the eugenics 
movement in the United States.

LSA 
SG 
Vice 
President 

Ryan Gillcrist, an LSA senior 
and 
co-author 
of 
the 
initial 

resolution, opened the discussion 
with a statement regarding the 
necessity to change the C.C. 
Little Building, both in an act to 
condemn the ideology of his work 
in eugenics as well as to stand in 
solidarity with students who feel 
underrepresented on campus. 

“It’s incredibly important for us 

to preserve and to remember the 
past, and that’s exactly why we

The Treatment, Innovation

Lab, 
a 

multidisciplinary 
lab 
at 
the 

University of Michigan, recently 
launched its new website. Also 
known as TIDL, the lab is 
focused on developing technology 
and initiatives to help those 
with mental health disorders, 
especially in underserved areas.

TIDL began in 2011 and 

consists of 24 members from 
multiple disciplines, including 
both students and faculty. 

Joe Himle, co-director of 

TIDL and associate dean for 
research at the School of Social 
Work, described TIDL as a 
multidisciplinary group of post-
ops, faculty members, graduate 
students 
and 
community 

members that is focused on two 
main areas of mental health 
research.

“So many people with mental 

health troubles do not have access 
to appropriate treatment for their 
problems, so we’re trying to close 
that treatment access gap by doing 
research that brings treatment to 
people who wouldn’t normally get 
it,” Himle said. “We’re focused on 
both people in underserved urban 
and rural areas.”

Himle said TIDL is also 

working to improve employment 
outcomes for people with mental 
health problems, which Himle 
described as a two-sided issue.

“People with mental health 

problems 
often 
avoid 
job 

interviews — they sometimes 
don’t have a very extensive peer 
network to call on for job leads,” 
Himle said. “So there is the

On book tour, Hillary Clinton talks 
fake news, Russia and 2016 election

Hill Auditorium full to hear former presidential candidate reflect on campaign challenges

On Nov. 8, 2016, Hillary Clinton 

lost the presidential election. With 
opponent — and now-president 
— 
Donald 
Trump 
receiving 

304 electoral votes, and a year’s 
worth of work on her campaign 

now shattered, Clinton was left 
wondering, what happened?

This is what Clinton discussed at 

her book tour stop Tuesday in Ann 
Arbor. With Hill Auditorium full of 
students, faculty and community 
members attending her talk, Clinton 
highlighted her experiences writing 
her book, “What Happened,” not 
long after the election. The Ann 

Arbor stop was one of several in the 
tour spanning across the nation and 
Canada.

Prior to her visit, students 

were divided on their feelings 
about Clinton’s book tour, as late-
September pre-sale ticket prices for 
the event ranged from about $82 to 
$170 and many students questioned 
the purpose of the book.

In September, LSA junior Jim 

Stehlin said he sees politicians’ 
book tours as problematic for the 
country’s 
interests; 
instead 
of 

focusing on policy, he thinks the 
“hero-worship” of politicians forces 
citizens to consider how politicians 
function as celebrities rather than 
public servants.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | OCTOBER 25, 2017


Former Eastern Michigan 

University 
student 
Eddie 

Curlin has been arrested as a 
suspect for the series of racist 
graffiti found on EMU’s campus 
last year. The suspect, while 
currently serving a sentence 
involving stolen property, has 
been charged with three counts 
of identity theft and one count 
for use of computers in order to 
commit a crime, according to 
WEMU.

During 
September 
2016, 

graffiti found on the side of 
King Hall included the letters 
“KKK” and “Leave N****RS,” 
according to the Detroit News. 
The next day, a racist slur was 
found written on a stairwell in 

one of the campus dormitories. 
One month later, more graffiti 
was found — the words “Leave 
N******” painted on the outside 
walls of Ford Hall, another 
EMU campus building.

Following 
the 
incidents, 

EMU 
President 
Jim 
Smith 

stated a $10,000 reward would 
be 
offered 
for 
information 

on 
the 
occurrences, 
and 

spoke of the administration’s 
commitment to providing a 
campus of inclusion.

“The deeper and systemic 

issues that are behind these 
incidents continue to be a focus 
for our student leaders, our 
faculty, 
our 
administration 

and all who care about this 
institution and the welfare 
of our students,” Smith said.

to the values and mission of the

STUDE NT GOV

AYUSH THAKUR/Daily

Liz Barry, Special Council to the President, speaks about ongoing projects of the President at the CSG 
meeting in the Union Tuesday.

“I 
find 
myself 
consistently 

disappointed by the hero-worship 
within 
the 
Democratic 
Party 

because it distracts from the policy 
issues that actually affect people’s 
lives,” 
Stehlin 
said. 
“Former 

presidents often do release books, 
(but) Hillary was not a former 
president. She was a presidential 
nominee who failed to win the 
election.”

Prior to the event, Engineering 

freshman Simrun Buttar said while 
she was a bit swayed by the price of 
attending, Clinton has been one of 
her role models since long before the 
2016 election.

“I think especially with this 

past election, so many events were 
skewed in ways that the general 
public wasn’t really made aware 
of, like the way things actually 
happened,” Buttar said. “I think, 
especially in Michigan itself, it 
was such a pivotal state in the last 
election that in being a swing state, 
she can maybe help things for the 
future.” 

Similarly, LSA freshman Brett 

Zaslavsky said he had been looking 

forward to the event due to the fact 
Clinton would be spending time in a 
state she lost in the election.

“It’s not every day that a former 

presidential candidate comes onto 
campus, particularly not one with 
the historical significance that 
Hillary Clinton has,” Zaslavsky said. 
“It was an election with tremendous 
consequences whatever side you’re 
on, and to be able to hear such a 
firsthand and unique perspective I 
think is a special opportunity.”

Nevertheless, 
the 
audience 

applauded 
for 
Clinton 
when 

she took the stage. Clinton first 
addressed some of the main points 
of her book, including the double-
edged sword of being a woman in 
politics.

“The only way we will get sexism 

out of politics is to get more women 
in them,” Clinton said, but she also 
noted one caveat: “Women are seen 
favorably when we advocate for 
others but unfavorably when we 
advocate for ourselves.”

A substantial part of Clinton’s 

talk was focused on addressing 
Russian 
interference. 
Clinton 

noted a necessity to demand 
evidence among media filled with 
“alternative facts,” especially with 
regard to critically considering the 

issues with cyber interference.

Clinton received applause when 

she called Russian interference in 
the election “more than alarming.”

“The administration is doing 

virtually 
nothing 
to 
prevent 

future attacks. … If you are an 
American, this should alarm you. 
It is shameful,” Clinton said. “The 
president swore an oath to faithfully 
execute the law and defend our 
constitution, and he should start 
doing his job, and the rest of us 
have to keep up the pressure.”

While the election was nearly 

a year ago, Clinton listed several 
next steps for the American 
public, particularly with regard 
to cyber safety and demanding 
transparency 
from 
those 
in 

office. 

“I know when it comes to 

Russia, we’ve got to get serious 
about 
cybersecurity,” 
Clinton 

said. “Beyond that, we must insist 
on truth and accuracy, and hold 
elected leaders and the press 
accountable. … We must summon 
the courage to stand up for human 
rights and democracy.”

In the Q&A portion of the 

evening, moderator and English 
professor Anne Curzan took 
questions from the audience, 

many of which primarily focused 
on Clinton’s personal experience 
writing the book and her advice 
for the future.

When discussing her decision 

to 
write 
the 
book, 
Clinton 

said after the election she was 
“devastated and shocked.”

However, 
touting 
again 

the negative impact Russian 
interference 
held 
in 
the 

election, 
Clinton 
noted 
the 

novel experience of having to 
circumvent this contemporary 
issue.

“It’s 
so 
unprecedented,” 

Clinton said. “It’s hard if you 
have never lived in the midst of a 
propaganda campaign.”

Clinton 
noted 
technology 

companies were slow to accept 
responsibility for the breach 
of cyber security, to applause 
from the audience. She then 
emphasized that the acceptance 
of this information by the public 
was accompanied by denial and a 
question of the legitimacy of the 
reports.

However, Clinton’s tone turned 

hopeful when addressing different 
types of leadership in position of 
power.

“If we get more people who 

put country before party, I think 
… some positive changes could 
actually come about,” Clinton 
said. “The cooperation between 
the parties has really deteriorated 
to the great harm of our nation 
and getting things done.”

Noting a need for women in 

leadership roles, Clinton said 
women should be prepared for 
character attacks, criticism and 
questions. However, she cited the 
importance of encouraging girls 
from a young age to succeed and 
gave advice for young women 
looking to lead. 

“Don’t become so closed off, 

so bitter, so cynical that you can’t 
remain open to the people you 
need, the people you’re trying to 
represent,” Clinton said.

Eastern Michigan University 

alum Asia David said she looked 
to Clinton for ways to improve the 
future.

“I 
supported 
Hillary 
in 

the primary and the general 
election,” David said. “We need to 
understand what happened in that 
election and … also maybe get tools 
for what we can do next time.”

After the event, Public Policy 

graduate student Ammara Ansari, 
who was previously an organizer 

for the Clinton campaign, said 
she admired the honesty Clinton 
demonstrated 
throughout 
the 

evening.

“After almost a year of the 

election, 
it’s 
good 
to 
know 

that she’s still around,” Ansari 
said; however, Ansari did not 
think Clinton was completely 
comprehensive in her talk. Ansari 
said, having worked on Clinton’s 
campaign, she wanted to know 
more of the former Secretary of 
State’s personal experiences in 
this aspect of her presidential 
run. “I wanted to know what she 
thought of her (campaign) staff.” 

Wayne 
State 
University 

sophomore Robert Swetlic said he 
appreciated Clinton’s tasteful and 
humorous demeanor, particularly 
with regard to “alternative facts.”

“I 
especially 
liked 
her 

comments about fake news. As 
someone who considers himself 
very active politically and in 
the realms of communication 
in journalism, I think it’s really 
important that we don’t let the 
conversation about fake news and 
propaganda die, and I like that she 
was really hitting on that, as well 
as telling us a more personal view 
of the election,” Swetlic said.

patient side, where the mental 
health problem makes it difficult 
to go out there and try to do the 
things you need to do to find 
employment.”

“But then there’s also the 

employer’s side, and on the 
employer’s 
side 
people 
with 

mental 
health 
problems 
are 

sometimes discriminated against 
in employment situations, because 
employers worry about people 
with a history of mental illness. 
Our job is to try and help people 
with mental health problems be 
more active in trying to find work, 
and also be more successful in 
sustaining work over time,” he 
added.

TIDL has numerous projects 

they are working on to help 
achieve their goal of a world 
where mental health issues do 
not prevent people from finding 
and keeping employment, as well 
as bettering the treatment these 
people receive. For example, 
Himle is the principal investigator 
of a project called Reaching 
Independence through Successful 

Employment, which is funded by 
the National Institute of Mental 
Health.

RISE, which has locations in 

Detroit and Los Angeles, focuses 
on helping people with anxiety-
related barriers to finding and 
keeping work. They have placed 
the intervention program in a 
vocational service center, and are 
working on training vocational 
service 
professionals 
at 
the 

center to deliver mental health 
interventions focused on work in 
their employment agency.

“Most mental health treatments 

are developed in university towns, 
or areas where people are highly 
educated, or large cities, often 
with mostly white, educated 
participants helping to evaluate 
and design the new mental health 
treatment,” Himle said. “But in 
our case, we often do the design 
and development as well as the 
initial testing of new mental health 
interventions 
in 
underserved 

communities, for later use by the 
broader population.”

He added hosting the sessions 

in Detroit allows the researchers 
to form better relationships with 
the group.

“If we develop a treatment in 

Detroit, it will always have a sort 

of home-field advantage — it will 
have a foundation that fits well 
with that group. It doesn’t mean 
that a person in Ann Arbor might 
not find that intervention useful, 
but the idea is to develop that 
intervention in an underserved 
urban and rural areas. Treatments 
often fit best with the people 
they’re initially developed with, 
and we would like turn that 
typical pattern around.”

Addie 
Weaver, 
another 

co-director of TIDL, is the 
principal investigator of another 
project, 
Raising 
Our 
Spirits 

Together. Weaver, who grew up in 
a rural area of Pennsylvania, feels 
a personal connection to the work 
TIDL does.

“I had first-hand experiences 

where I saw friends and family 
members in need of mental or 
physical health care that had a lot 
of difficulty,” Weaver said. “There 
just really weren’t treatment 
options available, so it required 
substantial travel and substantial 
resources in terms of having the 
right type of insurance, having a 
job that allowed you to take time 
off to address your needs, or being 
able to arrange childcare support. 
And really the underlying issue is 
that there just aren’t a lot of mental 

health providers in rural settings.”

ROST, which is funded by 

the National Institute of Mental 
Health via a Mentored Research 
Scientist 
Career 
Development 

Award Weaver received, and has 
an intervention site located in 
Hillsdale, is focused on providing 
more 
accessible 
depression 

treatment to those in rural areas.

“What kept coming up was 

that many times when someone 
is feeling down or depressed, 
they are very likely to seek 
support from their clergy. So we 
started to talk about creating 
and developing an intervention 
for depression that could be 
delivered in the church setting in 
rural communities,” Weaver said.

Weaver and her team have 

found there is large community 
interest in this initiative, both 
among the clergy and those 
afflicted 
by 
mental 
health 

problems, as well as the general 
community as a whole. She will 
be using her grant to engage in 
community-based participatory 
research 
to 
adapt 
and 
test 

behavioral therapy for depression 
in the church setting.

controversial occurrences on 
campus had vanished.

LSA 
sophomore 
Kevin 

Keegan, one of the students 
who attended the event, was 
intrigued by this notion.

“There’s still limited stories 

that are accessible about LGBTQ 
people and definitely as thinking 
about the erasure of stories as a 
form of discrimination and how 
that can allow discrimination 
to continue by erasing the 
hardships of the past,” Keegan 
said.

While much of what Retzloff 

described was negative, as time 
progressed there were certain 
landmarks 
that 
made 
the 

University notable in terms of 
being one of the first to recognize 
and accept LGBTQ people.

In 1984, University President 

Harold Shapiro instituted a policy 
statement that the University 
could not discriminate based on 
sexuality.

“The experience of queer 

people at Flint and Dearborn in 
the 1980s were worlds away from 

what was available here in Ann 
Arbor,” Retzloff said.

There were many people who 

were active in contributing to 
LGBTQ history, Retzloff said, 
including 
Nancy 
Wechsler, 

the first openly LGBTQ City 
Councilmember in Ann Arbor.

Retzloff included a picture 

of himself with a friend making 
a poster for the first gay and 
lesbian awareness day at the 
University in 1988. He noted 
this was a pivotal moment as 
a gay man and it was then that 
he was empowered through 
documenting the history.

He also spoke on the creation 

of 
the 
then-named 
Human 

Sexuality Office in the ’60s. He 
explained the students had to 
petition the University for an 
office space like other student 
organizations. The University 
did not want to have a name 
that specifically dealt with 
“gay” or “lesbian” students 
when they agreed upon the 
establishment of the office.

The Midwest, and Michigan 

in particular, offers a different 
narrative of LGBTQ history, 
which Retzloff studies. While 
cities like New York and 
San Francisco have a well-

documented 
history, 
social 

change within the LGBTQ 
movement also comes from 
areas like the Midwest and 
often get overlooked. Retzloff 
is currently writing a book on 
Detroit as a “gay city.”

When asked about how he 

felt impacted by this work, 
David Hutchinson, a Ph.D. 
candidate 
in 
the 
History 

Department, said it is vital to 
learn about the University’s 
relationship with activism.

“I 
think 
it’s 
important 

to learn about how queer 
students in the past navigated 
the very halls that we walked 
through today to understand 
how it is we are able to make 
up our lives that we live now,” 
he said.

Jennifer 
Jones, 
LSA 

collegiate postdoctoral fellow 
in the History Department, 
also enjoyed hearing about 
the Midwest’s role in LGBTQ 
history.

“I love the way in which the 

talk says yes there was violence, 
yes there was discrimination, 
but there was also opportunity 
to forge connections and build 
community and create lives,” 
Jones concluded.

from 
communities 
that 
could 

benefit most from listening to 
Cox — Black women and Black 
transgender women — may not 
have the opportunity to attend the 
event because of a limited amount 
of tickets. The tickets for the live 
event at Rackham Auditorium, 
which can fit about 1,000 people, 
are sold out, and the live-streaming 
locations are also at full capacity. As 
a way to ensure that Black women 
and Black trans women can listen to 
Cox’s presentation, some students 
are giving away their tickets. One 
of these students is Public Health 
student 
Vikrant 
Garg, 
whose 

Facebook post offered tickets to 
members of those communities 
who were interested in attending 
the event.

LSA junior Mayah Wheeler is 

one of the students who was not 
able to receive tickets to the live 

event. Wheeler explained the lack 
of availability was unfortunate 
because there are not many Black 
transgender 
women 
who 
are 

prominent social figures, and she 
felt it would be valuable to hear 
what Cox had to say.

“It’s important to see people who 

look like you creating social change 
because a lot of the time, especially 
for Black women and Black trans 
women, there aren’t many figures,” 
Wheeler said. “The way that Black 
women are represented in the 
media is ultimately a negative 
image, so if we have activists who 
are working to change that image it 
should be accessible.”

Wheeler was pleasantly surprised 

to hear about Garg’s actions and 
talked about how, as a Black woman 
on campus, sometimes it’s hard to 
remember she has the support of 
other communities.

“I think that giving the tickets 

away is really nice and really 
thoughtful,” Wheeler said. “It’s a 
horrible thing that you don’t expect 
people to support you, but being 

Black on this campus, you don’t 
expect it because of the way that 
a lot people act and what a lot of 
people do — you just don’t expect 
people to care.”

Garg 
also 
pointed 
out 
the 

multiple obstacles that made it 
difficult to get tickets to the event, 
such as limited seating capacity and 
institutional inaccessibility.

“It really depended on who 

was able to get there and reserve 
at the right time. When you talk 
about institutional access, there 
are people who don’t have access 
to the University as a whole,” Garg 
said. “For instance, Black student 
involvement is less than 4 percent, 
so if you’re looking at institutional 
access, U of M is highly inaccessible 
to Black people as a whole, let alone 
people with multiple marginalized 
identities.”

In the future, Wheeler hopes the 

University can offer Black students 
a chance to access events like these 
slightly ahead of time.

have libraries and museums and 
the department of history,” he said. 
“But it’s equally as important to 
learn from the past. Right now, we 
have a building that’s named after 
someone who, if he were here today, 
would have believed that thousands 
of people who have walked these 
grounds are unfit to be members of 
society.”

CSG members discussed the 

distinction between controversial 
science 
and 
ideology 
which, 

presently, is no longer appropriate 
to preserve.

Members affirmed the ideology 

of C.C. Little’s work is against what 
the University stands for as an 
institution, and the act of changing 
the 
name 
would 
demonstrate 

solidarity with the beliefs of the 
current administration.

“One of the big things that I 

find extremely troubling about 
this situation is how normalized 
the name is within the campus 
community, so a lot of the times, 
students don’t even realize that 
buildings are named after vice 
presidents, let alone the history 
there,” said CSG Vice President 
Nadine Jawad, a Public Policy 
senior. 

Engineering 
sophomore 

Zeke Majeske claimed since the 
building’s name does not hold 
significance to the vast majority of 
the student population, this action 
would ultimately be ineffective.

He 
also 
pointed 
out 
the 

connection between C.C. Little 
and Planned Parenthood founder 
Margaret Sanger, who were both 
part of the eugenics movement 

but are not both condemned by 
University students today.

He attempted to amend the 

language of a section of the 
resolution that connected C.C. 
Little to the rhetoric which inspired 
Nazism, arguing Little’s actions 
historically preceded and thus were 
not linked to the rise of Hitler. He said 
C.C. Little was speaking in a scientific 
context and Nazism appropriated 
that thinking. However, the other 
members did not join Majeske in his 
amendment and it failed.

The original resolution eventually 

passed, with 25 in favor and four 
against renaming the C.C. Little 
Building.

Majeske later said in an interview 

with The Daily he had concerns with 
the lack of historical context in the 
resolution.

I

t’s Monday night and I’m 
wasting homework time by 
way of my usual outlet for 

laziness — the internet. When I 
find 
myself 
wondering 

about 
the 
recent 
life 

events of a friend I haven’t 
spoken to in years, I’m 
able — thanks to Facebook 
— to search her name in 
seconds. A slight wave of 
envy sweeps over me as 
my search results come up 
empty; the realization that 
she’s left this corner of the 
virtual world is somehow 
a little jealousy-inducing.

While millennials are often 

criticized for their overuse of 
social media platforms, these 
internet outlets have become 
favorites of older and younger 
generations 
alike. 
Since 
the 

emergence of social media has 
been labeled a primarily millennial 
phenomenon by the public and 
mainstream media, an antithesis 
to fragmenting life into curated 
snapshots has also surfaced in 
this generation. The movement to 
permanently delete social media 
accounts has itself fostered a new 
subcategory of elitism, foiling to a 
more easily visible phenomenon of 
internet snobbery.

This is by no means a jab at 

the friend I attempted to softcore 
Facebook stalk that night — I look 
pretty foolish here because if I’d 
truly wanted to know what she 
was up to, I could’ve picked up the 
phone and called her. In no way do 
I wish to claim that anyone who 
decides to rid themselves of social 
media accounts should be placed 
in the same category as those who 
openly flaunt their less-connected 
lifestyles, wearing their conscious 
withdrawal from the internet like 
an unnecessary patch on a high 
school letterman jacket.

If an obvious downfall of social 

media seems often attributed to 
its publicity of otherwise private 
or unnecessary information on 
a widely accessible platform, 
why shouldn’t the same logic be 
applied in the opposite direction? 

That is to say, why shouldn’t over-
aggressive proponents of “more 
unplugged” lifestyles face the 
same societal scrutiny as internet 

over-sharers? This 
double 
standard 

seems 
to 
stem 

from the skeptical 
eyes 
of 
older 

generations 
and 

the association of 
less technological 
involvement with 
a 
purer 
human 

experience.

There 
are 

countless reasons 

for the deletion of social media 
accounts, 
and 
all 
are 
valid. 

Constantly engaging with such 
platforms can be psychologically 
depleting 
and 
mind-numbing. 

Some users are more prone to 
social 
media 
addiction 
than 

others, so a decisive detachment 
from 
these 
online 
spaces 

would especially benefit this 
demographic. 
Whatever 
the 

reason, 
users-turned-non-users 

frequently claim their removal 
from internet profiles has allowed 
them a heightened sense of 
happiness and productivity in 
their day-to-day lives.

For especially affected non-

users, unplugging is more of 
a necessary individual choice 
than a trend. This may be the 
case for all non-users — but in 
the openly boastful subcategory, 
attitudes toward users can quite 
easily 
become 
condescending 

and demonstrate the fine line 
between 
lifestyle 
choice 
and 

indulgence in the stereotypically 
negative portrayals of millennial 
engagement with social media. 

As with all generalizations, 

an 
exaggerated 
demonization 

of social media masks most 
of its positive attributes. For 
example 
— 
though 
riddled 

with clickbait news titles and 
advertising ploys — social media 
is often an incentivized source 
of social and political awareness 
for those who aren’t looking to 
seek these updates elsewhere. 

Though users often remain on 
social media for the benefits of 
interconnectivity among friends 
and family members, people also 
love to assess what others are 
doing and evaluate themselves 
accordingly. This mechanism 
of easy comparison is perhaps 
even more “human” than its 
less-connected 
antithesis, 
a 

counterargument for those who 
claim that technology disjoints 
the human state.

It makes sense, then, that the 

successful denial of this innate 
urge should elicit a feeling of 
hard-earned pride. However, with 
the inherent benefits that exist 
in a highly connected world, this 
pride is not totally warranted. 
Many argue that social media 
enhances necessary competencies 
of 21st century living, from the 
encouragement of discourse and 
information sharing to digital 
citizenship and critical assessment 
of subjective agendas.

This is not to suggest, however, 

that a life without social media 
platforms 
is 
always 
socially 

irresponsible. Over half of social 
media users assess news articles at 
mere face value: reading headlines, 
a couple introductory sentences and 
perhaps nothing else. To state the 
obvious, social medi a platforms 
themselves don’t seem to foster such 
careful user attention to current 
events. It’s not the possibility of social 
irresponsibility, then, that seems 
most bothersome from the more 
boastful demographic of non-users.

Perhaps the most troubling part 

is the denial of the double standard 
created by this disconnected 
image, the elitist rhetoric it 
condones and the failure to 
consider the beneficial effects of 
social media on other individuals 
— be it professionally, politically 
or otherwise. It’s important to 
recognize, in the age of human-
technology integration, there’s 
no one-size-fits-all formula for 
healthy social engagement.

T

his month, two remarkable 
events 
occurred 
that 

passed mostly under the 

radar here on campus. First, to start 
off the month, the University of 
Michigan celebrated its bicentennial 
with an entire week of climate 
change-themed activities, called 
MC2: Michigan & The Climate 
Crisis. This event was organized 
to explore the existential threat of 
climate change and to reflect on 
the University’s role in confronting 
this crisis as we move into our next 
100 years. 

Second, only a few days after these 

activities wrapped up, Scott Pruitt, 
administrator of the Environmental 
Protection 
Agency, 
announced 

the organization’s commitment to 
abandon all responsibility to uphold 
the United States’s pledge to the 
Paris agreement of 2015, which was 
devised to lower carbon emissions 
to a level that will keep the world’s 
temperature below catastrophic 
warming. The EPA has now 
officially repealed the Clean Power 
Plan, which was our country’s 
framework to meet the goals of the 
Paris agreement.

Meanwhile, 
the 
impacts 
of 

climate change have become all 
too apparent, in the almost-routine 
natural disasters that are occurring 
worldwide. While these events 
are not entirely caused by climate 
change, their severity and frequency 
most likely are. Indeed, the record 
floods, droughts, fires and major 
hurricanes are exactly what climate 
models and scientists have been 
predicting. The estimated cost of 
these disasters in the United States, 
this year alone, is over $300 billion 
(not to mention the loss of human 
life), which dwarfs the $33 billion 
Scott Pruitt claims the Clean Power 
Plan would have cost to implement.

In the face of this global crisis, 

the federal government’s failure 
has created an opportunity and an 
imperative for other institutions to 
lead. Across the country, churches, 
business, universities, and local 
and regional governments are 
signing on in support of the Paris 
climate accord. Many are doubling 
down on their efforts to advance 
renewable 
energy 
and 
reduce 

their carbon footprints. Colleges 
and universities, including our 
peers in the Big Ten, have laid out 
substantive plans to tackle the 
climate crisis on campus.

Our biggest rival, Ohio State 

University, is far ahead of the 
University of Michigan in its 
climate commitment; it has the 
capacity to generate 21 percent of 
the main campus’s energy needs 
from renewables. The University 
of Maryland, another Big Ten rival, 
has fully divested its endowment 
from fossil fuels. Other prestigious 
universities, 
including 
Yale 

University, Stanford University and 
the University of California, have 
partially divested, while Harvard 
University has at least frozen some 
fossil fuel investments.

Considering 
that, 
it’s 

disappointing 
that 
a 
report 

published by Bloomberg News 
this summer revealed that the 
University of Michigan has not 
only failed to address fossil fuel 
divestment, but that we have 
actually increased our estimated 
$1 billion worth of investments in 
these climate-altering companies 
by nearly 40 percent since 2015. 
As MC2 speaker Stephen Mulkey 
said, “It is ethically indefensible 
that an institution dedicated to 
the proposition of the renewal of 
civilization would simultaneously 
invest in its destruction.”

Though 
some 
from 
the 

University’s administration may 
rebut that those new investments 
are going into natural gas, which 
is supposedly more sustainable, 
recent scientific assessments have 
revealed that because of methane 
leaks during the fracking process, 
natural gas use may actually be one 
of the most carbon-intensive fossil 
fuels around — potentially worse 
than coal. The bottom line is, if 
we want to solve the climate crisis 
and avert catastrophe for human 
civilization, we cannot continue to 
burn fossil fuels.

The urgency to act is paramount. 

As a new University of Michigan 
study suggests, the window for 
action may be closing — the longer 
we wait, the worse climate change 
will become and the harder it will 
be to stop. That means action by 
nonfederal U.S. institutions is 
essential, because this country 
contributes a huge proportion 
of the world’s carbon emissions, 
and we cannot afford to wait for 
another presidential election to 
change that.

Despite saying that “the threat 

of climate change is one of the 

great generational challenges of our 
current and future students. We 
remain steadfast in our commitment 
to tackle that threat head-on at the 
University of Michigan,” President 
Mark Schlissel declined divestment 
in 2015. I hope he will reconsider 
this inaction, by taking the clear 
first step in committing our 
University to the Paris agreement 
goals — a proposal that was drafted 
by the Climate Blue student group 
and jointly supported by the MC2 
committee. Thereafter, so that our 
commitment does not ring hollow, 
I hope the University will begin 
implementing plans to transform 
our campus energy production to 
renewables and will stop investing 
in the very activity the Paris 
agreement is attempting to curb.

Furthermore, 
because 
we, 

the students, faculty, staff and 
alumni of the University, are its 
essence, it is our responsibility to 
urge President Schlissel and our 
University administration to act on 
climate change. We can sign the 
Paris petition ourselves to show the 
University leadership our support. 
We can ask them to compete with 
our rivals at Ohio State, to drop the 
excuses and find a way to get solar 
panels on top of every building on 
campus. We can demand that the 
University join other universities 
and divest our endowment from 
fossil fuels.

We can ask the University to 

lead by offering scholarships to 
students dedicated to fighting 
climate change. We can insist that 
they commit to a 100 percent 
renewable energy campus. We, 
ourselves, can directly engage at 
the University by participating in 
a climate action summit on Friday, 
Oct. 27, for the inauguration of 
the new School for Environment 
and Sustainability.

Finally, we can call on the 

University to live up to its creed 
to be “Leaders and Best” by 
actually taking the lead on climate 
change. Otherwise, what will 
future generations say when they 
look back on the University of 
Michigan’s third century?

 A modern manical Leviathan

 ISAIAH ZEAVIN-MOSS | COLUMN

I

n 
my 
Modern 
Political 

Thought 
class, 
we’re 

reading, among other things, 

Thomas Hobbes’s “Leviathan.” 
Themes 
in 
the 

book 
reminded 

me 
of 
thoughts 

and feelings I’ve 
experienced 
under 
Trump’s 

administration, 
so 
I 
decided 

to 
write 
this 

column. 

Hobbes suggests 

that the people will 
sacrifice their own 
“natural right” — that is, their 
right to preserve their own life 
— for the sake of the Sovereign, a 
figure who has absolute power to 
do as he wishes.

One thing to note: Hobbes uses 

the male pronoun to describe the 
Sovereign, illuminating a central 
fact 
of 
Hobbes’s 
philosophy, 

namely that the only people who 
were “free” were landowning 
white patriarchs. I often think 
about how normalized this kind 
of patent exclusion and prejudice 
was, and how that fundamentally 
changes how legitimate any of 
these philosophies are in the first 
place. Essentially, these people 
were living in a fantasy that 
affirmed their own superiority 
as 
landowning 
white 
men 

themselves. More on this later.

According to Hobbes, the 

Sovereign literally cannot act 
unjustly, since the Sovereign 
creates the state and all its 
institutions, laws and customs. 
Hobbes defines an unjust act as 
one that breaks the law; since 
the Sovereign is creating the 
very environment in which the 
law is decreed and enforced, the 
Sovereign cannot break the law.

We give this power to the 

Sovereign in order to be protected 
from, as Hobbes puts it, the 
natural condition of war between 
people. As everyone tries to 
preserve their own life, conflicts 
inevitably arise, and icky human 
passions and desires take over. 
To avoid this, we succumb and 
submit to the Sovereign, who will 
protect its citizens.

Hobbes 
wrote 
within 
the 

context of the English Civil 
War, which happened between 
the years of 1642 and 1651. 
On one side, there were the 
Parliamentarians (also known as 
the “Roundheads”), led by Oliver 
Cromwell — a name I had always 
oddly revered but only now 
learned about. And on the other, 
the Royalists (or “Cavaliers”). 
Cromwell and his cronies had 

just taken over, which led to 
the execution of Charles I and 
the exile of his son — who, in a 
shocking turn of history, is named 

Charles II.

Hobbes’s 
text 

responds to the ongoing 
debate between these 
two 
factions. 
The 

Royalists, since being 
deposed, decried the 
new 
government 
as 

illegitimate. 
But 
for 

Hobbes, 
these 
calls 

were hapless and held 
no ground, since the 
Parliamentarians were 

the ones in legitimate control. 
They were the Sovereign.

We can use Hobbes’s work as 

a foundation for understanding 
Donald Trump’s emergence, and 
that of the far right in general.

Donald 
Trump, 
I 
think, 

understands himself in similar 
terms to those of Hobbes’s 
Sovereign. According to Trump, 
he can do whatever he wants to 
because of the power he holds. 
This has always been true. It’s 
what’s allowed him to sexually 
assault women, deny housing 
to Blacks, publicly shame every 
demographic that is not his own, 
run a campaign based on his 
persistent disobeying of customs 
in the electoral process and get 
away with it all.

And now he is our president. 

Every time he shatters another 
custom, defies what we expect of 
him with some gaffe that no longer 
can be described that way because 
of how frequently it occurs, I think 
Trump tries to fundamentally 
change how much power we give 
him, our collective understanding 
of our nation’s customs, what is 
normal, the boundaries of the 
American discourse and how 
much we sacrifice for the sake of 
his regime.

By aligning with the Ku 

Klux Klan, for example, Trump 
has brought white nationalists 
into the mainstream political 
discourse. 
Richard 
Spencer 

and Charles Murray are being 
invited to college campuses in 
the name of discourse, when, in 
fact, these are men promoting 
specifically 
racist, 
hateful 

agendas. The blurring of this 
line — between hate speech and 
free speech — has been one of the 
most sweeping consequences of 
Trump’s presidency thus far.

He is trying to reset the terms 

by which he can legitimately rule, 
the threats he can make to our 
very way of life — with respect 
to the environment, to North 
Korea and to his conspicuous 

respect for white nationalist hate 
groups — while still remaining 
in office. And this is how he ran 
his campaign; by the time of the 
actual election, he had thoroughly 
reduced the individual impact of 
each new headline detailing some 
new disgusting act.

We can see instances of 

Hobbes’s 
notion 
that 
the 

Sovereign is always legitimate in 
contemporary discourse as well. 
In Ann Arbor, for example, in 
the days after Trump’s election, 
I heard some of his supporters 
dismissing the outraged, crying 
students — mostly students of 
color — with the logic that these 
people should “get over it,” that 
Trump won fair and square and 
that there was nothing to do but 
“move on.”

But today, so many of those 

people who voted for him are 
discovering the hollowness and 
deception of Trump’s messages. 
They’ve been blindsided by the 
fact they themselves surrendered 
their own sovereignty — just as 
Hobbes describes — for the sake 
of this new leader, a leader who 
would reclaim the United States 
as they knew it, or as they wanted 
to know it.

Because 
unlike 
Hobbes’s 

Sovereign, Trump is not trying 
to 
protect 
his 
constituents, 

to 
preserve 
their 
lives 
and 

livelihoods. Instead, Trump uses 
his power for his own nefarious 
goals: to push an agenda of 
derision, violence and hatred. 
He is, in fact, openly combative 
when marginalized communities 
express dissent and anger. For 
example, 
he 
blamed 
Puerto 

Ricans themselves for the level 
of destruction they faced in the 
wake of Hurricane Maria. Like 
his supporters before him, this is 
Trump saying, “I have won. I am 
the legitimate power-holder. Get 
over it. Fend for yourself.”

Hobbes wrote in a time 

when dissenters were routinely 
hanged or drawn and quartered. 
A time when, as I mentioned 
earlier, 
everyone 
besides 

landowning patriarchs was, as 
custom, regarded as sub-human 
or subservient.

The 
possibility 
of 
this 

comparison, between Hobbes’s 
imagined leader, one who has 
absolute 
sovereign 
power, 

and our actual one, who we, 
as a nation, elected in 2016, 
ought to make us confront our 
contemporary social society in a 
new, skeptical light.

On 
her 
seventh 
studio 

album, P!nk nears 21st century 
pop 
perfection. 
The 
lovably 

spunky singer’s latest release, 
Beautiful Trauma, delivers to 
fans all of P!nk’s characteristic 

contradictions; it’s joyful and it’s 
angry, it’s bright and it’s dark, 
it’s beautiful and it’s traumatic. 
Some music connoisseurs may be 
skeptical of the singer’s raw pop, as 
some tracks lack substance and are 
plagued by love song cliches, but 
even the snobbiest of music snobs 
won’t be able to resist stomping 
their feet to Beautiful Trauma’s 
energetic anthems and indulging 

in the album’s moving ballads.

From the get-go, the Beautiful 

Trauma’s 
titular 
track 
sets 

the tone of the record with an 
irresistible pop anthem. The song 
has everything a pop track needs: 
a strong chord progression, an 
empowering beat and a melody 
dynamic enough to be musically 
engaging while anthemic enough 
to be a sing-along. When the

P!nk returns with ‘Beautiful Trauma’
New ‘Beautiful Trauma’ is 
P!nk with her perfect pop

Angry, bright, dark and poppy — P!nk’s back and better than ever

MIKE WATKINS

For the Daily

chorus hits, it’s pop — it’s slightly 
corny, but it’s good.

P!nk also took a page out of 

the 21st Century female pop 
star playbook by featuring a 
traditionally 
rough-around-the-

edges rapper to give the album’s 
second track some grit (e.g. Taylor 
Swift’s “Bad Blood,” with Kendrick 
Lamar). In this case, that rapper 
is Eminem. The track “Revenge” 
features an infallible “My Name 
Is”-esque hip hop beat blended 
with modern synths to develop 
an overall bright sound, one that 
contradicts the song’s lyrics that 
depict a messy and unhealthy 
relationship, an interesting and 
slightly comical technique that 
both P!nk and Eminem have 
deployed in the past. The song is a 
head-bouncer, and Eminem’s verse 
approaches The Marshall Mathers 
LP-level crudeness with the final 
line, “You’re a whore. You’re a 
whore. This is war.” P!nk did not 
miss on Revenge by bringing on the 
king of brutally honest tracks about 
relationship struggles.

Another 
interesting 

characteristic 
of 
Beautiful 

Trauma is its current relevance. 
P!nk 
manages 
to 
extrapolate 

turbulence within a relationship 
to turbulence within the United 
States in 2017. “What About Us” is 
both a meditation on a struggling 
couple and an analysis of modern 
political and social turmoil. In the 
second verse, P!nk sings, “We are 
problems that want to be solved 
/ We are children that need to be 
loved / We were willin’, we came 
when you called / But man, you 

fooled us, enough is enough.” 
In the context of a pop song, a 
listener could take these lines as 
a description of broken promises 
and 
disappointment 
within 
a 

relationship, but P!nk’s use of 
the words “we” and “children” 
hints at a deeper meaning, one 
that relates to a nation of people 
looking for answers. As Billboard 
writer Patrick Crowley notes, P!nk 
has not shied away from political 
commentary in the past, as she 
actively shared her objection to 
the white supremacist rallies in 
Virginia and was vocal about her 

support for Hillary Clinton. “[I]t’s 
not far-fetched to think that the 
double meaning was intentional,” 
Crowley wrote, and in a time of 
racial struggle and frustration over 
political inaction, P!nk deserves 
some credit for making music 
bigger than herself.

Now, do not be mistaken — 

Beautiful Trauma certainly has 
its cliche moments, but what 
pop album doesn’t? In the track 
“Whatever You Want,” the line, 
“I feel like a ship’s going down 
tonight, but it’s always darkest 
before the light,” will have many 
listeners groaning and rolling their 
eyes, and unfortunately there is 
no shortage of these cheesy lines 

throughout the album. P!nk can get 
away with these eye-roll-inducing 
lines, though, because her brand 
is essentially relatable heartbreak, 
and there is little one can do to 
avoid sounding corny or mushy 
when meditating on love and its 
consequences. As a listener, just 
remember that pop with a universal 
appeal has its base consequences, 
and take P!nk’s shallow lyricism 
with a grain of salt.

Beautiful Trauma has another 

cliche characteristic, but this one is 
less likely to make listeners cringe. 
P!nk sprinkles her album with 
classic, heart-string-pulling ballads 
that reveal the singer’s status as 
more than just a pop star, and 
exhibit her expertise as a vocalist. 
These slower, piano-driven songs 
may be basic and slightly hackneyed, 
but they speak on the ever-relatable 
topic of the struggle for love by 
including some of the shallow but 
accessible lyrics aforementioned, 
and P!nk’s impressive vocal range 
and emotional vulnerability make 
these songs even more powerful. 
The love-ballad is alive and well on 
Beautiful Trauma.

From top to bottom, P!nk’s latest 

release is a well strung together pop 
project. The pleasantly abrasive 
pop star successfully delivers to her 
listeners a unique blend of grit, love 
and political commentary, a breath 
of fresh air in today’s pop music 
world. With relatable content, 
invigorating 
beats, 
exciting 

features and P!nk’s undeniable 
talent, Beautiful Trauma is worth 
the listen for both pop-lovers and 
pop-skeptics.

SYFY

It’s a bad show
‘Superstition’ is laughable

Series combines bad acting and bad visuals to make a bad show

At the risk of sounding overly 

cynical, I hope I’m not the only 
one who has ever watched a 
series and immediately thought, 
“Wow, this absolutely sucks.” 
It’s only happened a few times 
(see: “Taken”), but it’s almost 
comical when it does. To have 
such a glaringly and obviously 
terrible show is hilarious to me 
— it always leads me to try and 
imagine simply how and why 
the series was greenlit in the 
first place. I mention all of this, 
of course, because this was my 
exact reaction upon screening 
the pilot of Syfy’s “Superstition.”

At 
the 
time 
I 
watched 

“Superstition” ’s excuse of a 
premiere, I was in a sort-of 
shitty mood from our loss to 
Penn State Saturday evening. 
I was exhausted, down and, to 
top it off, my buddies at Penn 
State were flooding my phone 
with texts about their blowout 
victory. I needed a reprieve from 
my grief and, oddly enough, 
I 
found 
that 
much-needed 

shot 
of 
optimism 
through 

“Superstition.” As I settled in 
and began taking notes during 
my viewing, I had to force myself 
to stop ripping every element of 
the show because it was getting 
exhausting. Instead, I took a 
more 
entertaining 
approach 

and started focusing on how 
hilariously bad this episode is, 
but even that wasn’t enough 
to redeem this masterpiece in 
garbage television.

For “Superstition,” its issues 

are rooted in its downright awful 
writing. The series is centered 
around the occult experiences of 
the Hastings family, who operate 
a funeral home in a quaint 

Georgian town. Aside from the 
overdone Southern gothic trope, 
this basic idea isn’t awful in and 
of itself, but its already weak 
storyline is hardly propped up 
by its dialogue, which is stiff and 
awkwardly phrased.

In one especially horrific 

scene, 
the 
town 
sheriff, 

Officer Westbrook (Demetria 
McKinney, “House of Payne”), 
speaks at a murder scene to 
a local Satanist, who claims 
to Westbrook: “We brought 
this 
upon 
ourselves, 
Chief 

Westbrook.” The line was so 
forced and cringe-worthy that 

I had to restrain myself from 
doubling over with laughter. 
In what world does a regular 
person, let alone a Satanist, call 
a police officer “Chief”? Maybe 
I’m harping on one word, but 
the entire line reeks of being 
one of the most boring and 
awkward-sounding things I’ve 
heard on television in a while. 
And that’s saying something 
considering that I saw the trailer 
for “Geostorm” this morning.

Next on the laundry list 

of 
problems 
inherent 
in 

“Superstition” is, like most bad 
television, its “acting.” In fact, 
the only actual acting happening 
in the series is its cast pretending 
that they’re actors — yes, it’s that 
terrible. Playing the Hastings 
family patriarch, Mario Van 
Peebles (“New Jack City”) is 
entirely unconvincing in his 

plethora of clichéd wisdom and 
obvious desire to be a cop in 
another life. As the prodigal son 
returning home, Brad James 
(“For Better or Worse”) isn’t able 
to arouse any sort of emotion 
or sympathy for his character 
from the audience. Rounding 
out its utterly disastrous cast 
is McKinney, whose tone-deaf 
performance begs us to ask why 
Hollywood assigns police officer 
roles indiscriminately.

As awful as its acting remains, 

“Superstition” ’s visuals are 
somehow nearly just as bad. 
Armed with a camera that I 
would guess is from the 18th 
century, the series offers zero 
sense of visual appeal. With 
hardly 
any 
exterior 
shots, 

“Superstition” seems perfectly 
content to stay indoors, despite 
its bland set design. Exemplified 
by the Hastings house, the 
sets of each scene are hastily 
and 
generically 
generated, 

causing me to believe that the 
only research the writers did 
for this show was to read “To 
Kill a Mockingbird” and hope 
that Southern stereotypes of 
grandfather clocks and creaky 
mansions were still in-vogue.

Witnessing 
such 
blatant 

indolence 
in 
Hollywood 

astounds even me, but it also 
makes me glad that sites like 
Rotten Tomatoes exist to give 
each new movie or show a 
single, simple review score so 
as to punish these lazy artists 
and push viewers and their 
dollars 
away. 
If 
Hollywood 

hasn’t learned its lesson about 
lazy 
stereotypes 
yet, 
I’m 

(unfortunately) not sure it ever 
will, but at least audiences can 
steer clear of “Superstition” and 
let Hollywood’s latest small-
screen blunder fall flat on its 
Satanic face.

People smoke pipes in ‘1922’
‘1922’ has potential but 
fails to land a decent blow

Stephen King’s ‘1922’ gets the Netflix treatment to mixed results

The last line, “In the end we all 

get caught,” of Netflix’s new horror 
film “1922,” sums up the film’s 
takeaway in one sentence. The 
movie, based on the Stephen King 
novel, the line, spoken by Wilfred 
James, the protagonist, (Thomas 
Jane, “The Mist”), embodies a 
central theme: You can’t get away 
with murder. Despite Wilfred 
James’s evasion of the law, he is 
ultimately unable to avoid his guilt 
and delusions, putting himself in 
a sort of mental prison. Wilfred 
eventually comes to represent the 
paranoia that manifests from the 
guilt after a crime, in his case, the 
gruesome murder of his wife while 
she’s in a blurred drunken state.

The film opens up without 

hesitation to begin the exposition 
of Wilfred’s obsessive plot to 
murder of his wife to save his 
money and land. He even convinces 
his 15-year-old son, Henry (Dylan 
Schmid, “Once Upon a Time”) 
to co-conspire with him. The 
plotting is coupled with the film’s 
initial slow, ominous pace, as the 
maniacal father son duo walk 
through towering green cornfields 
where the husks mask their faces 
in an oddly ethereal fashion. 
Director and screenwriter, Zak 
Hilditch (“These Final Hours”) 
uses very few artificial lighting 
techniques and employs the use 
of available lighting, which in 
1922, truly only came in the form 
of daylight, burning lamps and 
candles. When Wilfred and Henry 
hover over warmly-lit lamps on 
their dark porch in the middle of 
Idaho, the eeriness and tension is 

heightened because the viewer can 
only see within the parameters of 
what is lit in the dim lights. This 
leaves the viewer left to wonder 
what extends into the darkness. 
Overall, the direction was not 
the film’s issue, and it was even at 
times artful, where Hilditch plays 
with blurring and focus of natural 
elements on the ranch to tightly 
control the masking of characters 
from camera.

Like the title of the film, the year 

is 1922 in Des Moine, where women 
were recently granted universal 
suffrage. But in this rural setting, 
ranchers’ wives were expected 
to keep a tidy home for their 

husbands, with no room for greater 
personal aspirations, a societal 
hierarchy which Wilfred James 
supports. When his wife, Arlette 
(Molly Parker, “Deadwood”), a 
gifted seamstress before she was 
murdered, began talking dreams 
of selling their land and moving to 
the city to open up a dress shop, 
Wilfrid began to get nervous. For 
Wilfred, and like other men at this 
period, this threatened his role as 
the family’s decision maker, his 
land and his masculinity. Wilfred, 
with the assistance of his only son, 
Henry, brutally murder Arlette 
and throw her into the abyss of 
a dark well without thinking of 
consequences. Not shortly after, 
rats begin to eat at her body and 
emerge from her orifices, which 
ultimately serve as a metaphor 
for Wilfred’s festering paranoia of 

the rats bursting out of crevices, 
constantly reminding him of the 
great deed he did.

The murder occurs within 

30 minutes of the film, allowing 
for no true narrative build up. 
With the rising action of the film 
completed at the beginning, it 
leaves over an hour remaining of 
watching Wilfred increasingly rot 
from his turmoil and paranoia. 
This narrative pace and structure 
can be successful, but the slow-
burning, building mystery for 
which Hilditch presumably strived 
was sort of like extinguishing the 
candle altogether. The direction 
was dull at moments, but the true 
problem was rather more the story 
itself. The premise is not new, 
which isn’t to say that every film 
has to include a revolutionary plot 
or theme. But for such a common 
genre of small-town horror, it 
necessitates something unique that 
differentiates it from the rest, which 
this film lacks. There are plenty of 
acclaimed rural horror movies, 
and adding this to the collection 
doesn’t make a compelling push for 
it audiences to watch. It is barely 
terrifying or mysterious, and the 
only jarring element was how foul 
it was to witness rat infestations 
and see their revolting tails scurry 
across the screen about every ten 
minutes.

Lastly, Hilditch could’ve used 

this film as an opportunity to 
explore the larger picture of female 
liberation and breaking out of 
gender roles during this period, 
which would have added an extra 
narrative layer to augment its 
staleness. But sadly, “1922” goes 
into a large pile of attempts but fails 
at true, nail-biting, hair-on-the-
arm standing horror.

WARNER BROS

It’s a bad movie
‘Geostorm’ is disastrous 
(but still kind of funny)

New disaster movie stays true to its genre in its poor quality

“Geostorm” will probably be 

heralded as one of the worst movies 
of the year. Filled with bad CGI, 
insipidly stupid characters and 
a plot so confusing that hours of 
trying to dissect it afterwards will 
still lead one to failure, there’s no 
doubt “Geostorm” is a bad movie. 
It is a very, very bad movie. But it’s 
not the worst movie ever made. 
For all of its faults, against all odds, 
with absolutely nothing going 
for it and not a single character 
that is likable in even the loosest 
sense of the word, the third act 
of “Geostorm” is actually a really 
good time.

Dean Devlin directed and wrote 

“Geostorm” as his directorial 
debut, and it seems more likely 
he simply went with the first idea 
he had every single step of the 
way and never bothered to think 
through any moment of the film 
for longer than three seconds. 
The plot, which stems from the 
seemingly simple idea of weather-
controlling 
satellites 
going 

haywire, quickly becomes mired in 
confusing government allegiances, 
unclear character motivations and 
an evil plan so nonsensical that it 
renders almost every single action 
taken by a character in the film to 
be meaningless.

The villain’s goal appears to 

be to use the weather satellites to 
unleash extreme weather upon 
countries and peoples he doesn’t 
like, but then he later initiates the 
self-destruct mechanism of the 
satellite control station, which if 
successful would render all the 
satellites worthless, returning the 
earth to a state of global warming-
induced chaos. Why the villain 
would be okay dying with everyone 
else on earth when the satellites 

go down is not explained in the 
movie. How or why the villain is 
doing anything that he does is not 
explained in the movie. There’s an 
attempt to explain why the space 
station even has a self-destruct 
feature, but the explanation falls 
flat on its face and only serves to 
call out the idiotic story that is 
being told to the audience.

Gerard 
Butler 
(“London 

Has 
Fallen”), 
Jim 
Sturgess 

(“Kidnapping Freddy Heineken”) 
and Abbie Cornish (“6 Days”) all 
fall completely flat as the main 
characters of this film. Only Andy 
García (“Passengers”), as the U.S. 

President Andrew Palma, shows 
any signs of life, and it is the third 
act in which he begins to throw in 
one-liners that the movie finally 
becomes watchable. After an hour 
and a half of what essentially 
amounts to different people sitting 
in rooms, staring at computer 
screens and exclaiming, “Ahhhh 
— so that’s what’s going on!” the 
movie finally arrives at the actual 
storms, and a semblance of what 
could’ve been an entertaining 
movie begins to assert itself.

Make no mistake: the final act 

of “Geostorm” is still completely 
asinine. Butler, at one point, 
survives 
a 
giant 
spaceship 

explosion by wearing nothing more 
then a spacesuit. But unlike the rest 
of the movie, the last half hour is at 
least fun to watch. It’s dumb fun, 
rather than dumb drivel. It’s what 
the trailers and advertisements for 
“Geostorm” actually promised. At 
last, the movie finally acts like the 
garbage disaster flick that it is. At 
last we get to watch Andy García 
utter lines like, “I’m the goddamn 
President of the United States.” 
This is what we came for. Not for 
the hackneyed plot. Not for the 
terrible special effects. Not for the 
actors and not for the first-time 
director. For dumb punch lines 
and famous people running from 
falling buildings. “Geostorm” isn’t 
enough of a disaster to be worth 
the effort.

DAILY COMMUNITY CULTURE COLUMN

How far would we go to 

achieve fame?

Columnist Bailey Kadian contemplates the price of fame

In one of the greatest works 

of 
Old 
English 
literature, 

“Beowulf,” there is a scene 
in which Beowulf heroically 
defeats the monster Grendel and 
is told, “You have won renown: 
you are known to all men far 
and near, now and forever.” 
This is an extraordinary sort of 
fame, one that will live beyond 
Beowulf’s lifetime. From ancient 
texts to beloved stories to our 
modern realities, our desire 
for fame appears. Beowulf is 
the archetypal hero — and his 
never-ending fame serves as the 
reward for his act of defeat.

To be remembered is our 

inherent desire. We hope our 
identity will stretch far beyond 
our short-lived existence. It’s 
intriguing 
how 
enthralled 

we are by the idea of doing 
something to be remembered. 
It’s complicated in that much 
of what we do for our earned 
recognition is fundamentally 
good. Why we do it is harder 
to 
understand. 
Some 
claim 

their fame came as a surprise, 
for their efforts towards their 
campaign, their organization, 
their business or their movement 
were totally directed towards 
a specific purpose. It wasn’t for 
personal recognition — their 
fame just came as a byproduct. 
Others were passionate about 
the potential of earning fame 
and therefore used some other 
platform to go about attaining it.

In leading a movement of 

some sort, does the glory rest in 
the original intent? Or perhaps 
if we traced the root of the 
movement, would we find a 
desire for esteem at its core? If 
the overarching goal is fame, the 
initial motive or passion loses its 
significance.

Let’s 
consider 
a 
singer 

writing her own music. Music 
starts as a passion, in hopes to 
reach audiences that can relate 
to her lyrics and experiences. 
Maybe 
after 
enough 
years 

in the spotlight, the artist 
is encouraged to shift her 
priorities. Now that she has 
overwhelming fame, everything 
suddenly feels different. What 
once was a genuine interest 
has now become one strand 
of a larger image; an image 
revolving around the person, 
not the passion.

If I lead a movement to 

provide clean water for people 
in 
impoverished 
countries 

who cannot access it, and I 
gain publicity for my efforts, 
I imagine much of the lasting 
impact would be about myself, 
and not entirely about the act 
that earned the recognition. The 

idea we once pursued, a generous 
act of public service, becomes 
the thing we must pursue for us. 
For the fame. For being known. 
And of course, for that fame to 
surpass our lifetime.

There is a plaque hanging up 

on the wall at my high school. 
My sister’s name is on it. She 
won some award during her 
senior year. I can’t remember 
what the award was called, or 
even why she specifically won 
it, other than the fact that she 
was one of the most talented 
people who ever joined our 
school’s 
drama 
department, 

and the award recognized that 
accomplishment. I remember 
noting the significance of the 
plaque, and how it would last 
for years beyond her time 
there. Why is that worth more? 
There was something distinctly 

valuable about her name being 
planted on the wall. It was a 
name that would be known and 
seen by those passing through 
the hallways for years following 
her time there.

We 
often 
assume 
that 

acquiring fame will make our 
circumstances better. Or maybe 
it just reminds us that we 
have indeed “made it,” in life, 
because our efforts have been 
noted by many people, thus 
making them worth something.

What does this desire for 

fame say about our intentions? 
In an age where you can be 
“exposed” on social media, 
or publically hated, there is 
more risk to acquiring fame. 
In becoming a “known name,” 
there is great potential for 
immense criticism, almost to an 
inhumane degree. If you make 
one wrong move, it can stain 
your name. It is permanent 
— marked with the stamp of 
impossible removal, for that one 
mistake is just a Google search 
away, locked in the histories of 
our devices that never forget. 
Our eternal glory may last, but 
it rests in the hands of all of 
us, with our widespread ability 
to make whatever we want 
known to the world. Our use 
of technology has bridged the 
gap between those in the public 
spotlight and those who simply 
observe the figures illuminated 
by the light.

Now, more than ever, we have 

the ability to be remembered. 
But it does not promise a 
favorable result. If anything, 
there 
is 
more 
risk, 
more 

publicity and more knowledge 
about oneself that can circulate 
all over this universe. Your 
name may very well be known, 
possibly resulting in a lasting 
legacy, or likely, leaving the 
remnants of its antithesis — 
a tainted identity “known to 
all men far and near, now and 
forever.”

TV REVIEW
Ron Livingston thrives 
as lead in ‘Loudermilk’

Loudermilk to join the ranks of Bojack and Frank Gallagher

In a world of Frank Gallaghers 

and BoJack Horsemans, the trope 
of the alcoholic male lead has found 
sufficient footholds in recent years. 
On Oct. 17, the Audience Network, 
 

accessible 
only 
to 
DirecTV, 

AT&T U-verse and DirecTV Now 
customers, premiered the pilot 
of its new show “Loudermilk,” 
from co-creators Peter Farrelly 
(“Dumb and Dumber”) and Bobby 
Mort (“The Colbert Report”), 
ushering 
in 
another 
abrasive 

drunk protagonist to add to the 
list. 
“Loudermilk” 
stars 
Ron 

Livingston (“Office Space”) as Sam 
Loudermilk, a caustic recovering 
alcoholic and substance abuse 
counselor.

In the first few scenes, Sam tells 

one of his AA attendees that “life’s 
about fucking things up — and then 
unfucking the things you fucked 
up,” and the theme of this pilot 
episode seems to be Sam doing just 
that. Due to his acerbic attitude 
and behavior, the priest (Eric 
Keenleyside, “Godzilla”) of the 
church where Sam holds meetings 
informs him that his meeting 
space will be revoked if he does not 
help one of the church member’s in 
rehabilitating her stubborn, drug-
abusing daughter Claire (Anja 
Savcic, “Extraterrestrial”).

While 
the 
boozehound 

character is not a new one, not 
often do we find him as the focal 
point of a TV show — probably due 
in part to the fact that the attributes 

of someone truly suffering from 
alcoholism don’t lend themselves 
well to making a loveable lead. 
“Loudermilk,” however, creates 
a compelling twist on the role of 
the classic drunk. It may not seem 
fair to categorize Sam in this trope, 
considering he is four years sober 
and leading sobriety meetings, 
but he has the biting, me-against-
the-world attitude of someone just 
getting “off the sauce.”

The 
most 
defining 
points 

of Sam’s character build are 
dichotomous to the point of 
verging on unbelieveable. Sam is 

depicted as an extremely dedicated 
counselor — denoted more by his 
actions than his usually apathetic 
comments — but he also goes on to 
display an utter callousness toward 
his fellow man, exemplified by 
him pushing past an elderly man 
going up the stairs. I believe it is 
this same disconcerting, polarized 
quality about him that makes him 
a suitable lead — he’s constantly 
pushing you away and pulling you 
back in.

For many of the doubts I did 

have, the writers would close the 
gaps with the occasionally self-
aware comment from Sam. He tells 
his budding love interest Allison 

(Laura 
Mennell, 
“Watchmen”) 

that he’s learned to be blunt and 
harsh to cut through the lies and 
excuses of the addicts he works 
with, which bleeds over into his 
personal life.

While so many of Sam’s traits 

are abrasive to the point of 
discomfort, I saw a lot of my darker, 
hidden qualities in him, which 
helped me relate much better to 
the show and feel justified in my 
own grating characteristics. When 
Sam’s roommate and “only friend” 
Ben (Will Sasso, “MADtv”) asks 
why he pushed past an old man on 
the stairs, Sam replies, “Maybe I 
just wanted to get nowhere faster,” 
and I’ll be damned if those words 
didn’t come out of my own mouth. 
These humanizing moments in the 
face of otherwise atrocious actions 
are what endears Sam to the few in 
his life strong enough to withstand 
his rough edges — and the same 
can be said for the viewers.

Where the show does falter, 

however, is in the strength of 
the dialogue. Often times it 
feels as though the writing is 
more of a vehicle for delivering 
social commentary and setting 
up overthought jokes than it is 
for carrying the plot along, or 
communicating 
relationships 

between characters. Don’t get 
me wrong, the show is definitely 
comedic in nature, but the humor 
wavers when it tries too hard. 
While the show does have its 
flaws and lulls, the pilot episode 
and the show’s namesake present 
a compelling case for viewers to 
tune in again next week.

‘M’ goaltending competition still open

Now, four games and an 

exhibition into its season, 
the Michigan hockey team 
has split goaltending time 
evenly between sophomores 
Jack LaFontaine and Hayden 
Lavigne. 

Mel Pearson has set the 

deadline 
for 
selecting 
a 

starting 
netminder 
at 
the 

eight-game 
mark. 
This 

deadline will come around 
in approximately two weeks 
after the Wolverines open 
conference play this weekend 
against Penn State and face 
Ferris 
State 
at 
home 
the 

following weekend.

“It’s not unlike quarterbacks 

here at Michigan,” Pearson 
said at the onset of the season. 
“You’ve got three, four, five 
quarterbacks 
who 
are 
all 

pretty good, but usually one 
emerges and then takes the 
job.”

LaFontaine 
and 
Lavigne 

have already put up half of 
the showings that will dictate 
who will get to be the primary 
goaltender for the remainder 
of the season.

With this important cut off 

looming in the near future, 
here is a closer look at the 
efforts of each 
goaltender 
so far in the 
season. 

Jack 

LaFontaine:

LaFontaine 

boasts 
a 

perfect 
2-0-0 

record on the 
ice, 
an 
elite 

.950 
save 

percentage and 
a minuscule 1.01 goals-against 
average. 
The 
goaltender’s 

performance 
has 
already 

transcended 
that 
of 
his 

freshman season where he 
recorded one win while in 
net. He has started the Friday 
nightcap against St. Lawrence 
and Vermont.

LaFontaine picked up his 

first win of the season against 
the Saints, which came in 
the Wolverines’ first game of 
the season. He registered 24 
saves, and allowed only one 
goal throughout regulation.

“LaFontaine was excellent 

in net (against 
St. Lawrence),” 
Pearson 
said. 

“You 
need 

goaltending, 
and I thought 
Jack was a huge 
difference for us 
in this game.”

In the home-

opener 
against 

Vermont 
on 

Friday 
night, 

LaFontaine 
again 
put 
on 

a stellar performance and 
recorded his second complete-
game win of the season. The 
sophomore netminder made 
five saves in each period, and 
let the puck slide by him only 
once.

Notably, 
when 
the 

Catamounts 
held 
a 
5-on-3 

advantage during the second 
period, LaFontaine remained 
unfazed, notching four saves 
en route to Michigan escaping 
the dangerous penalty kill 
unscathed.

Hayden Lavigne:
Lavigne has gone 1-1-0 over 

his two outings this season, 
holding a quality .898 save 
percentage and a 2.50 goals-
against average. 

In his season debut, the 

sophomore goaltender had to 
settle for a 3-0 loss to Clarkson. 
However, he still put up a solid 
effort, making 16 saves on the 
night and was instrumental in 
the Wolverines’ 5-for-6 mark 
on penalty kills. 

Lavigne 
notched 
his 

standout performance in the 
second game of the Vermont 
series.

Saturday night he earned 

his first win in the net, and 
was 
fundamental 
to 
the 

Wolverines’ clutch weekend 
sweep. Lavigne registered 28 
saves, shutting down many of 
the Catamounts’ most viable 
scoring opportunities.

“I 
thought 
they 
had 

a 
few 
very 
good 
scoring 

opportunities,” Pearson said. 
“And (Lavigne) came up big.”

After the first weekend of 

play, LaFontaine may appear to 
have a slight edge over Lavigne 
in the battle for the starting 
position. 
Yet, 
subsequent 

to the Vermont series, each 
goaltender has displayed at 
least one standout night and 
both hold impressive stats this 
year. These factors ensure that 
Pearson’s impending decision 
will be anything but easy.

“Two 
good 
goalies 
in 

both Hayden and Jack,” said 
sophomore 
forward 
Adam 

Winborg 
following 
the 

Vermont series. “… As long as 
we do our job in front of them, 
they’re there, so they’ll always 
give us a chance to win the 
games.”

RYAN MCLOUGHLIN/Daily

Sophomore goaltender Hayden Lavigne has gone 1-1 over two starting outings this year, posting a .898 save percentage.

It’s not unlike 
quarterbacks 

here at 

Michigan.

FIELD HOCKEY
Wolverines close out 
season with shutout

It has been a regular season 

characterized by near-perfect 
execution for the No. 4 Michigan 
field hockey team — a sonorous 
symphony 
conducted 
with 

perfection by coach Marcia 
Pankratz 
and 
passionately 

played by a bevy of seniors. 

Tuesday night, that symphony 

concluded with a satisfying 
crescendo.

The 
Wolverines 
easily 

dispatched Central Michigan, 
4-0, in Mount Pleasant.

The 
victory 
resulted, 
in 

part, from relentless offensive 
pressure and excellent passing 
by the Wolverines.

“(The offense) does really well 

with basic skills – fundamentals,” 
Pankratz said. “Trapping and 
passing is the cornerstone of 
the game. We’ve been able to do 
it well and that’s allowed us to 
sustain our success.”

From 
the 
outset 
of 
the 

match, the Wolverines (8-0 Big 
Ten, 16-2 overall) thoroughly 
dominated the Chippewas (0-5 
Mid-American 
Conference, 

0-16 overall). Michigan kept 
possession and generated several 
scoring chances early in the 
first half, but Central Michigan 
desperately fended off each of 
these chances.

Then, 
Michigan 
junior 

defender 
Leah 
Cardarelli 

deftly beat goalie Lily Amadio, 
spinning with Bachian grace 
and chopping the ball at the 
seemingly 
wide-open 
net. 

Suddenly, Chippewa defender 
Ali Huddleson came out of 
nowhere and stretched her stick 
out, barely stopping the ball from 
rolling over the line. Mere inches 
separated Cardarelli from her 
second goal of the season.

Yet again, Central Michigan 

had fended off an excellent 
Wolverine attack.

But the Chippewas defense 

would not hold forever.

With about 20 minutes left in 

the half, sophomore midfielder 
Meg Dowthwaite received the 
ball on the right side of the field 
and fired a cross to the front of 
the net. Junior forward Emma 
Way redirected it to junior 
midfielder Katie Walker, who 
pounded it into the back of the 
net to give Michigan a 1-0 lead.

A mere 35 seconds later, 

Dowthwaite pounced on a ball 
in the middle of the shooting 
circle and flung it past several 
Chippewa 
defenders 
and 
a 

sprawling Amadio with the sheer 
force of Mozart’s symphony No. 
25.

The 
Wolverines 
suddenly 

had a 2-0 lead — a lead that they 
would never look back from.

In the second half, senior 

back 
Katie 
Trombetta 
and 

graduate 
forward 
Carly 

Bennet each tacked on another 
goal to Michigan’s lead. Due 
to 
suffocating 
defense, 
the 

Wolverines didn’t concede a 
single shot attempt, let alone a 
goal, to the Chippewas — the 
10th shutout of their 13-game 
winning streak.

“They 
just 
communicate 

really well and organize the 
defense,” Pankratz said. “Of 
course, (senior goalkeeper Sam 
Swenson) does a great job in 
goal as well. And we’ve got some 
speed back there on the side back 
position. Put that all together 
and that’s a very solid foundation 
(for our defense).”

As the final notes of a truly 

stellar regular season begin to 
fade into silence, the Wolverines 
know that they are capable of 
ending the postseason with a 
national title — but Pankratz 
doesn’t want her team to focus 
on that.

Even-keeled 
as 
always, 

Pankratz said, “the next game is 
the most important one.”

Wolverines aim to put blowout in the past

These are uncertain times for 

the Michigan football team.

Saturday 
night, 
the 
now-

unranked Wolverines suffered their 
worst loss since 2015 — another 
42-13 blowout at the hands of then-
No. 2 Ohio State — and they have 
faced a storm of backlash as a result.

Though they faced a wave of 

criticism after their first loss to 
Michigan State, this is the wave 
that could threaten to bring their 
sails crashing down.

In the high-stakes atmosphere 

of college football, one loss has the 
potential to poke holes in a resume. 
Two losses has the potential to sink 
a season.

But Monday, Michigan argued 

that its ship is still intact.

“With any team and fanbase, 

there’s going to be negative talk 
about it. That’s just the way it is,” 
said fifth-year senior fullback Henry 
Poggi. “Everyone wants perfection, 
and when that doesn’t happen, 
people start falling off the ship.

“We know that no one on our 

team can fall off the ship.”

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 

has taken it upon himself to 
steer the Wolverines in the right 
direction. After Saturday’s game, 
he told them about those fans who 
would hop off the bandwagon and 
express negative opinions about 
the state of the team.

He didn’t have to tell them. 

In the often-critical landscape 
of social media, Twitter and 
Instagram give those types of fans 
a platform to voice their complaints 
either directly or indirectly. College 
athletes, 
whose 
social 
media 

presence is typically monitored by 
the communications departments 
of their respective programs, have 
to learn how to deal with the hits 
without hitting back.

Junior wide receiver Grant 

Perry said he just keeps scrolling 
to bypass the negativity. Poggi said 
he just doesn’t follow people who 
engage in that kind of activity.

For a Michigan team dominated 

by underclassmen, it can be easy for 
the outside noise to seep through. 

The Wolverines’ veterans see it as 
their responsibility to turn down 
the dial.

“It’s a pretty bad loss,” Poggi said. 

“But the best thing about football 
during the season is that you have 
another game coming up to correct 
your wrongs. … The best way to put 
something in the young guys is just 
to lead by example. Show them that 
we’re still practicing hard. Practice 
harder to correct what happened.”

Added redshirt junior right 

tackle Juwann Bushell-Beatty: “I 
think emotions are high. Going 
forward, I think we’re just going to 
continue to do what we do and try 
to improve our game and continue 
to learn from our mistakes. I think, 
most importantly, going forward 
as a team we just need to learn 
confidence and trust in ourselves.”

Michigan doesn’t have to look 

very far back to find an example of 
how one loss can turn into a string 
of them if the Wolverines aren’t 
careful about how they respond to 
it.

In 2016, Michigan’s first loss, 

to Iowa in November, was also 

unexpected. 
And 
while 
the 

Wolverines were able to respond 
with a win over Indiana — as they 
also did this year — they lost the 
final two games of their season to 
then-No. 2 Ohio State and then-No. 
10 Florida State.

Though Michigan’s losses have 

come much earlier this season, 
Harbaugh said Monday that the 
lesson he intends to teach is the 
same.

“The team that goes through 

this understands — can have a 
great opportunity of understanding 
— where there needs to be a 
response,” he said. “The response 
that comes as coaches and players 
(is) gotta keep coaching and players 
gotta find out what they’re made of 
from a competitive standpoint.

“The going gets tough, the tough 

get going. It’s a cliché, but clichés 
are usually clichés because they’re 
true.”

Harbaugh was then asked if he 

thought the Wolverines had it in 
them.

“I believe we do,” he said. “(I) 

believe that this team will respond.”

‘M’ finishes fifth 
in last fall match

For a day, the Michigan men’s 

golf team looked like it could 
hang with the nation’s cream of 
the crop. Well actually, a half a 
day. 

After 
the 
first 
round, 

Michigan was just six shots 
behind No. 8 Baylor — the 
eventual-champion 
— 
with 

Carlson and Mueller shooting a 
67 (-4) and 69 (-2), respectively.

From there, the Wolverines 

didn’t fare as well. In their 
last match of the fall season, 
Michigan finished fifth out of 
13 schools at the Royal Oaks 
course, 
a 
familiar 
location 

for experienced seniors Kyle 
Mueller 
and 
Ian 
Kim, 
as 

well as junior Nick Carlson, 
and it clearly showed in the 
tournament.

“This tournament was really 

unusual because all five of the 
players played in one group 
together,” said Michigan coach 
Chris Whitten. “We’ve never 
done that since I’ve been head 
coach here. That team dynamic 
this 
week 
of 
seeing 
your 

teammates do well and having 
the momentum [spread] through 
the group was a big deal.”

Indeed, it was a big deal. No 

one shot green numbers in the 
first round, as freshman Charlie 
Pilon and Kim both produced an 
even 71 for the first round.

Michigan’s 
top-three 

standing in the tournament 
was short-lived, though. On the 
second round of day one, birdies 
were hard to come by and more 
bogeys creeped their way onto 
the scoreboard. Baylor, No. 15 
Kent State and No. 17 Arkansas 
began to show their true colors 
as well, with all three schools 
shooting tremendous second-
round scores.

“In the second round, it’s 

not that we did anything a lot 
worse,” Whitten said. “We just 
didn’t make as many birdies. 
Sometimes, 
that’s 
just 
the 

difference of (getting) a few feet 
closer on your approach shots 
and then just getting a couple 
more putts to go.”

Heavy wind — a golfer’s worst 

enemy — dominated the course 
on the second day, and it showed 
especially in round 3 scores.

“It was funny because (in) 

some other tournaments, our 
worst round a lot of times was 
our first round,” Whitten said. 
“Today, I would say the course 
played totally different. I mean, 
it was so windy that you almost 
had to play the wind on a five-
foot putt or a four-foot putt.”

Contrary from the usual, the 

Wolverines played the par-3 
holes as good as anyone but 
finished dead last in average 
scores for par-5 holes.

Individually, 
Michigan’s 

top tandem of Carlson and 
Mueller continued their success, 
finishing 
third 
and 
12th, 

respectively. But the Wolverines 
still couldn’t make up for the 
loss of freshman Henry Spring, 
who is currently back in his 
home country playing for a 
potential spot in the Masters 
and the Open Championship.

“This is kind of a cool story 

actually,” Whitten said. “He’s 
qualified for the Asia Pacific 
Amateur, which is a really big 
tournament in New Zealand, 
his home country. So he’s in 
New Zealand right now about to 
play that and the winner of that 
tournament gets an exemption 
in the British Open and the 
Masters.”

For the rest of the team, 

however, there is a long three-
month 
break 
before 
their 

next tournament in February, 
which kicks off the spring 
season. During this break, the 
Wolverines will have five days 
of strength and conditioning 
on 
top 
of 
swing 
practice, 

continuing their hunt to break 
into the nation’s top-25 come 
February.

After winding path to Michigan, 
Hawkins settling in on defense

Brad Hawkins committed 

to Michigan over two years 
ago on July 3, 2015.

Then ranked as a four-star 

athlete 
from 
New 
Jersey, 

Hawkins expected to sign 
with 
the 
Wolverines 
in 

February of 2016 and arrive on 
campus that summer.

As it turned out, his path 

to Ann Arbor would be longer 
than expected.

While 
his 
grades 
were 

fine and he was a qualifier, 
an 
NCAA 
Clearinghouse 

issue popped up: Hawkins 
had 
attended 
two 
high 

schools 
in 
Camden, 
and 

the 
first 
school 
had 
not 

submitted his transcript to 
the NCAA. Because of the 
miscommunication, Hawkins 
wouldn’t find out his status 
until mid-summer of 2016 at 
the earliest — too late for him 
to participate in Michigan’s 
summer program.

Faced with the decision of 

waiting for an answer from 
the NCAA — that he couldn’t 
even be sure would clear 
him — or taking a prep year, 
Hawkins chose the latter. 
His coaches at Camden High 
School helped him look for 
a new school that he could 
attend 
before 
arriving 
at 

Michigan as a member of the 
2017 class.

Suffield Academy, led by 

head coach Drew Gamere, 
quickly stood out as an option.

“I’d been in contact with 

one of the coaches and I 
think they felt like Brad could 
benefit from an extra year 
anyway,” Gamere told The 
Daily in July. “We had Brad on 
campus, and he just struck me 
right away as a great kid. Very 
humble and eager to learn and 
develop his skills — football 
being one of them, but then 
everything else that comes 
with it. The study skills in the 
classroom, all that stuff.”

In 
initial 
conversations, 

Gamere sensed Hawkins was 
disappointed he wouldn’t be 
able to enroll at Michigan as 
planned. But that emotion, 
according to Gamere, quickly 
turned to excitement once 
Hawkins 
visited 
Suffield’s 

campus and met his future 
teammates and coaching staff.

Gamere 
himself, 
of 

course, was excited for the 
opportunity to coach a player 
of Hawkins’ caliber — and 
personality.

“He was a pleasure to work 

with and very coachable, and 
I think that for us, it was 
the most important thing,” 
Gamere said, “because you 
don’t always get that with 
the guys that are the most 
talented.”

Gamere witnessed Hawkins 

continue 
to 
develop 
on 

the field as he recorded 51 
receptions for 868 yards and 
11 touchdowns. But the coach 
also saw personal growth from 
his new star — something that 
Jim Harbaugh quickly became 
aware of, as well.

“When 
Coach 
Harbaugh 

visited here, he said to us that 
he couldn’t believe how much 
Brad had grown,” Gamere 
said. “He had gone from this 
kid that didn’t really say much 
and was shy and didn’t talk 
much, to a guy that was giving 
Coach Harbaugh a tour and 
was as popular as anybody on 
campus.”

Things 
never 
wavered 

between 
Michigan 
and 

Hawkins, and he finally made 
his way to Ann Arbor this past 
summer. He’s appeared in 
several games thus far, mostly 
on special teams as a kick 
returner.

When 
asked 
whether 

his 
prep 
year 
gave 
him 

an 
advantage 
over 
other 

freshmen, Hawkins was non-
committal. That’s not to say it 
didn’t change him, though.

“It just gave me a better 

year academically, basically,” 

Hawkins said Tuesday night. 
“I got a lot stronger, I got more 
mature, so that helped.”

One of the biggest questions 

facing Hawkins was which 
position he would play in 
college. In high school, he 
did most of his damage on 
offense while moonlighting as 
a safety.

He’s 
still 
practicing 
at 

multiple spots. But right now, 
it appears Hawkins is closer to 
figuring things out.

“Right now, I’m playing 

VIPER,” he said. “VIPER and 
safety.”

Hawkins had already moved 

to the secondary entering the 
season. But he didn’t start 
repping at Michigan’s hybrid 
linebacker-safety 
position 

until 
around 
when 
the 

Wolverines played Air Force.

Hawkins recalled that it 

wasn’t his decision. One day, 
the coaches simply told him 
he’d be moving to VIPER.

For someone who already 

went through one position 
change, it would have been 
understandable had Hawkins 
faced his next move with 
trepidation. After all, another 
switch 
means 
more 
time 

learning the system, more 
time studying the playbook — 
and less of a chance to hit the 
field.

Hawkins, though, has made 

the move with enthusiasm.

“I think that’s where I 

can make my money at in 
the future,” Hawkins said. 
“We made the move, and 
everything feels comfortable 
right now.”

Hawkins admitted that he 

still has to get used to his new 
position. He says he was used 
to “hanging out in the middle 
of the field” as a safety and 
needs to improve his blitzing.

But, 
according 
to 
him, 

things are still going smoothly.

“Everything’s 
falling 
in 

place right now,” Hawkins 
said. “I’m just being patient 
and just waiting my turn.”

The picture stays in the kid: ‘Custody’

X

avier Legrand’s film “Custody,” which 
I watched this past weekend at the 
Chicago International Film Festival, 

centers around a custody battle in which two 
children, a boy who looks to be about 9 or 10 years 
old and a girl nearing her 18th birthday with 
one foot already out the door, feel threatened by 
their father. Their protestations fail to persuade 
a judge to avoid granting some degree of custody 
to the father.

We learn the father is a 

menace. He’s easily frustrated 
and feels insecure about his 
distance from his children. 
He takes his anger out on 
his children and essentially 
stalks his ex-wife. In the film’s 
conclusion, the boy is broken 
inside.

But in the film’s opening 

scene, the hearing to determine 
custody, 
there’s 
a 
degree 

of 
uncertainty 
about 
the 

parents’ respective parenting 
abilities. We get both parents’ 
perspectives 
(albeit 
mostly 

through their lawyers’ words) 
and we’re not sure whether the 
complaints about the father are 
valid. Not to mention, it seems 
rather unfair that a father 
would be all but barred from 
seeing his children.

But, of course, by the end, one can’t help 

but feel regret for even feeling a modicum of 
sympathy for the monster.

I wasn’t terribly surprised when my parents, 

in a nondescript Ann Arbor hotel room in the 
fall of 2015, announced their divorce, but I 
was still shaken. The informal discussion that 
followed clarified that I could spend my time 
with which parent I wanted to, that there would 
be no judgment.

I’ll give my parents all due credit: I’ve never 

really felt outward pressure from them to 
spend all my time with either in particular. 
Not to mention, since they divorced after I 
turned 18, I was not subject to the often-terrible 
proceedings of a custody battle. And I in no way 
mean to classify either my mother or father as 
in a similar camp as the father in “Custody.” 

But intra-marital disputes have a peculiar 
effect on children, and splitting the home into 
two separate circles of people exacerbates that 
tension, especially for children, regardless of 
intent.

It was easy at first. The realities of the suburban 

housing market trapped us in our house for 
about two years, but even then, it was easy to 
feel that my allegiance was being tested. Mom 
would work during the day and Dad would work 

in the evenings, so when I returned home from 
breaks, one half of each day would be dedicated 
to either parent. An invitation to join Mom or 
Dad to an event or to go to a museum or go out 
to dinner seemed like a ploy to monopolize my 
time, to breed loyalty.

When the house was sold and Dad moved to 

the city while Mom stayed in the suburbs, my 
ability to split my time between the two became 
more complicated. This was partly beneficial 
since Mom’s apartment had more room, and 
thus a room for me, staying in the suburbs made 
more logistical sense. But I hate the suburbs. 
Aside from the library’s large music collection 
and this one pizza place I eat at quite frequently, 
I find myself so restless in Northbrook. My 
friends have different breaks than me, and I’m 
often alone. Not that I know that many people 

in the city of Chicago either, but at least there’s 
a view and parks right outside.

When Mom and Dad lived together, even 

post-divorce, there was an appearance of 
responsibility for me to play an equal role in 
both of my parents’ lives. Now, I know Dad’s 
rental of a single apartment is mostly out of 
convenience and financial concerns — how am I 
supposed to not read some value, or lack thereof, 
into that decision?

This, I learned, is the 

cost of divorce: It’s not 
that your parents are not 
together, it’s that they’re 
separated. It’s that every 
interaction with either one 
of them is a reminder that 
you have to repeat the same 
information to the other, 
too, and pretend as if they 
were the one you called 
first.

Any bit of news they 

get 
from 
you 
about 

their 
former 
significant 

other 
is 
potentially 
an 

armament that serves to 
justify their decision, and 
you become complicit in 
their war. This is all a bit 
exaggerated; I doubt my 
parents consciously use me 
to air out their grievances 

against each other or to serve as a conduit to 
each other, so they don’t have to talk to each 
other, but it’s impossible to escape these feelings 
when you have to drive the pants that one parent 
mistakenly took from the house but waited to 
return them until you arrived so you wouldn’t 
have to see your ex.

The worst part — OK, not the worst, but 

perhaps the visibly irksome — is the assortment 
of old rugs and furniture that dots each parent’s 
new home. Our living room is in Mom’s. Our 
family room is in Dad’s. Visible reminders of a 
house that once was and a family that has been 
since split apart, ripped into pieces but sewn 
together to keep up the appearance that things 
are just as they were.

It’s not that I want the furniture to go away. I 

want it all back together.

P

eople 
have 
been 

going on pilgrimages 
for eons. Whether 

it’s to gaze upon the Shroud 
of Turin, visit the tomb of 
St. James or stand inside 
the vaulted nave of some 
distant cathedral, humans 
as a species have shown 
a remarkable capacity for 
uprooting themselves and 
their lives just for the chance 
to seek out meaning in some 
distant destination. In the 
Middle Ages, members of the 
faithful might travel for weeks 
on end to reach a holy site — 
some never arrived, and many 
never returned.

My trip took three days, 

more or less, a sort of hyper-
condensed there and back 
again. Automobility is a lovely 
thing, really, if you discount 
its contribution to the ongoing 
ecological catastrophe that is 
industrial capitalism. Not that 
I actually drove myself, though 
— somehow, over the course of 
the past half-decade or so, I’ve 
managed to avoid getting a 
driver’s license. I even took a 
driver’s education course once, 
but never followed up on the 
actual license acquisition part. 
Honestly, this fact probably 
isn’t a positive, but I’ve come 
to view it as a kind of eccentric 
point of pride. Regardless, 
when it came time to make the 
journey, I was reliant on two 
friends to make my way there.

Oh yeah, we went to see the 

eclipse. That’s there.

Does anyone really want to 

read about people going on 
a road trip of self-discovery 
anymore? We’ve had Kerouac, 
Nabokov and all the rest of 
them, so why bother with 
another? But whether we’ve 
had enough, somehow I can’t 
settle on any other story of 
my own to share, at least not 
one that I’d be comfortable 
presenting in a public setting. 
So this is what you get to read 
about, something that maybe 
has something meaningful 

to say but, unlike some other 
topics I considered, doesn’t 
make me address any of the 
uncomfortable 
questions 

bouncing around my head. 
So, tired a topic though it is, 
this is what I have, cliché and 
all.

The 
drive 
itself 
was 

enjoyable. I’d rather this piece 
not be documentarian in 
nature, but a few things that 
happened are worth writing 
down. Somewhere in Ohio on 

the first day we stopped at a 
diner for breakfast, whereat 
I was called a quitter by our 
server for turning down 
a 14th cup of coffee. Once 
we made it to Kentucky, 
the scenery was beautiful, 
and once we were on the 
winding mountain roads of 
the Appalachians, one of my 
friends took the wheel and 
led us on a high-speed ride 
that 
was 
simultaneously 

thrilling and terrifying.

When we arrived at my 

family’s home in Georgia, we 
were exhausted and happy 
to have a rest. We spend the 
night socializing with my 
parents, who were happy 
to actually see me at all 

last summer (I took classes 
spring and summer terms), 
and turned in relatively early 
to compensate for the hour at 
which we had to rise the next 
morning. When we got up, we 
hopped in the car and rode an 
hour or so north, traveling by 
back roads to avoid traffic.

Not surprisingly, when we 

entered the path of totality 
there were absurd numbers 
of people. The eclipse was 
certainly the largest secular 

pilgrimage I can think of, 
and it showed. Conservative 
estimates suggest that 20 
million people went out of 
their way to watch it, less 
conservative (ironically from 
the University of Michigan) 
estimates give 215 million 
as the number. A CNN poll 
beforehand indicated that a 
full half of the U.S. population 
at least considered watching 
it. Somehow we found a 
place to park, and along with 
innumerable others, set about 
climbing a mountain in a state 
park to get the best view. By 
this point in the day, the wet, 
Southern August heat felt 
oppressive, and though it was 
an easy trek, the walk felt long. 

In front of us on our way up 
was a shirtless, hippie-ish man 
burning incense and playing 
a wooden recorder. I really 
wonder what his story is.

At the apex of the mountain 

a crowd had gathered, far too 
many people to really settle 
in comfortably, so we looked 
around for alternative viewing 
options. After a consultation 
with 
a 
park 
ranger, 
we 

decided to hike back down the 
mountain (via a different route) 

in search of a lake that was 
allegedly there. Thankfully, it 
was, and after a few miles we 
arrived at the lakeside about an 
hour and a half before totality. 
So, we waited.

I’m not certain what to say 

about the eclipse itself. The sky 
went dark and the temperature 
dropped. 
Shadows 
shifted 

in uncanny ways and colors 
changed to subtly strange hues. 
Crickets began to chirp and 
birds flew in confused circles. 
A few bright stars appeared in 
the sky. For a few minutes, it 
felt as if the world had stopped 
turning on its axis — the whole 
thing was eerily biblical, really. 
When it passed, a moment had 
to be taken just to reorient.

Months later, the event (aside 

from being a memory that is just 
generally “cool”) left me with 
a few muddled up thoughts. 
Sitting there, watching as one 
gargantuan object passed in 
front of another astronomically 
— 
literally 
astronomically 

— larger one, I just couldn’t 
shake the feelings associated 
with being incredibly small 
compared to the sheer scale of 
the forces involved with what 
I was seeing. I’ve always had a 
sort of cursory fascination with 
the cosmos, in a kind of gee-isn’t-
this-really-cool-but-terrifying 
sort of way, and every so often 
— usually at night, always 
when alone — I experience this 
almost physical sensation of my 
person collapsing down into 
somewhere in my viscera while 
the whole incomprehensible 
expanse of the cosmos opens 
above me. Watching the eclipse 
was like that, but in slow 
motion.

I’ve 
always 
wondered 

about the expression “one in a 
million.” Most often it’s used to 
convey this idea of uniqueness, 
a kind of “you are special” 
utterance. But to my ears it can 
take on a far less comforting 
tone. When I hear “one in a 
million,” it reminds me of the 
mind-boggling immensity of 
it all, and of my own relative 
smallness. One out of a million 
is a very insignificant piece. 
But in journeying to see this 
astronomical event, I was 
one in millions, not a million. 
And the star that I watched 
be blotted out, our own life-
giving incandescent orb, isn’t 
even one in millions, but one 
in septillions. The hugeness 
of the universe is literally 
inconceivable to me. And 
that’s why, in the scheme of it 
all, I’m not sure what exactly 
my eclipse pilgrimage means, 
if anything at all. Maybe the 
lesson is simply that you’re 
not always the main character 
in the story you thought of as 
your own.

SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL 

The balance between performance and body image

b y Yo s h i k o I w a i, Deputy Statement Editor

“

Forty 
kilograms,” 
the 
ballet 

instructor 
announces. 
Silent 

agreement among faculty and 

other students is palpable in the studio, 
albeit the obvious tension. It’s an easy 4 
kilograms below the number where the 
scale’s needle hovers — a sigh escapes, 
relief fills my chest. I step off and watch 
the needle bobble back to zero, a number 
I will never be.

This was my seventh grade. It was 

routine for me. After four hours of ballet 
every day, we weighed in and heard our 
“ideal” weights announced to the class, 
a public service announcement to spark 
incentive. A scale was kept under the 
piano, right by the accompanist’s feet. 
We were praised when we were under, 
condemned for every half-pound we were 
over. No amount of sweat — enough to 
wring from our leotards — was ever good 
enough. It was a balance between satis-
faction with the reflection in the mirror 
and having enough fuel in your body to 
get through the night. It was nothing 
short of destructive.

I kept this mentality with me, through 

boarding school and part of college after-
ward — the pressure to conform, the 
ever-present desire to be liked by a cho-
reographer, a teacher, a coach lingered 
in the back of my mind. In high school, 
I listened to my friends purging in the 
bathrooms, taking laxatives like candy 
and throwing away food without giving 
it a second thought.

The phases came in and out of my 

life, as they did for many of my friends 
in dance. It’s difficult to denounce a 
lifestyle that has been etched into your 
brain, diet and outlook on food. It’s con-
suming — present at every store, social 
event, relationship. You never realize 
how pervasive food is — the way it brings 
people together, maintains friendships 
and creates new ones.

It wasn’t until college and a pre-med 

curriculum that I found some peace 
with my body. Or made efforts to do so. 
The facts became harder and harder to 
neglect: anemia, brain defects, infertil-
ity, multiorgan failure. It quickly became 
apparent that the effects were long-last-
ing and severe. For the first time, it was 

real.

Over the past few decades, eating dis-

orders have been a topic of conversation 
on college campuses. Universities across 
the country have dedicated services spe-
cifically for eating disorder treatment. 
The University of Michigan offers help 
to students battling eating disorders 
through programs at University Health 
Services and Counseling and Psychologi-
cal Services, along with other smaller 
organizations and student-run groups 
like Wolverine Wellness and MBody. 
Michigan Medicine has a Comprehensive 
Eating Disorders Program, providing 
individualized care for patients between 
8 and 24 years old.

Dr. Terrill Bravender, David S. Rosen 

Collegiate Professor of Adolescent Medi-
cine, is a program physician and section 
chief of the University’s Comprehen-
sive Eating Disorders program. When I 
interviewed him, Bravender spoke of the 
college campus as a stimulant of eating 
disorders.

“If you think about it, if you’re at risk 

for developing eating disorders, college 
culture is perfect,” he said. “You’ve got 
rec centers that are open 24 hours a day, 
you have high emphasis on appearance, 
you have an opportunity for 24-hour-a-
day eating and all of a sudden as a college 
freshmen, you are responsible for creat-
ing your own structure in your life. All of 
these distractors can make people’s lives 
feel like they’re spinning out of control.”

Despite the prevalence and sever-

ity of eating disorders, there are few 
nationwide studies on the disease within 
college students. Although surveys on 
individual campuses and wellness cen-
ters have been conducted, there has been 
a lack of nationwide data on the younger 
18-to-24 year-old population in general. 
It wasn’t until recently that two Univer-
sity public health researchers took mat-
ters in their own hands.

University professors Kendrin Sonn-

eville and Sarah Lipson, assistant profes-
sors in nutritional sciences and health 
management and policy respectively, 
conducted a nationwide study on uni-
versity students with eating disorders. 
Published in 2017, the 9,713-person study 
aimed to determine risk profiles for eat-
ing disorders in a diverse population. 
The study measured the risks of students 
from various backgrounds to develop an 
eating disorder or disordered eating hab-

its with the long-term goal of taking pre-
ventive measures and improving current 
treatment.

Although eating disorders and dis-

ordered eating often result in physi-
cal symptoms, the disorder is a mental 
illness, characterized by an obsessive, 
unhealthy relationship with food. With 
the highest mortality rate among mental 
illness, eating disorders remain an insidi-
ous part of American culture. According 
to DSM-5, the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders published 
by the American Psychiatric Association, 
there are five categories of eating dis-
orders: anorexia, bulimia, binge-eating 
disorder, feeling or eating disorders not 
elsewhere classified (FED-NEC), and 
other eating disorders including body 
dysmorphic disorder (intrusive, imag-
ined or inaccurate perceptions of one’s 
body image) and orthorexia (the fixation 
on overly righteous eating habits).

Researchers are studying people who 

do not fit into the strict criteria of the 
DSM-5, but nonetheless have unhealthy 
relationships with food. Although these 
people do not have full-fledged eating 
disorders such as anorexia or bulimia, 
they are characterized as having sub-
clinical eating pathology, or “disordered 
eating,” which can develop into a clini-
cal disorder. Disordered eating affects a 
much larger population in college com-
munities and is now being targeted for 
earlier preventative measures.

“If you think about eating disorders 

like other conditions, it would be like 
saying, ‘We’re not going to treat you until 
you have stage 5 cancer.’” Sonneville 
said. “When you think about it that way, 
it doesn’t make any sense. There are early 
symptoms that if not addressed will prog-
ress to worse symptoms, and so Sarah 
and I took a public health approach. We 
looked at high levels of disordered eating 
behaviors that are themselves problem-
atic, but may actually progress if unad-
dressed.”

The study sought to observe other 

potentially 
influential 
characteristics 

like age, degree-level, gender, sexual ori-
entation, race and ethnicity, and citizen-
ship. After extensive analysis, the two 
researchers concluded undergraduate 
student status, non-straight men, and 
overweight or obese students were at the 
highest risk for developing an eating dis-
order.

“There’s been appreciation in my field 

of public health and descriptive epide-
miology about what is the face of eating 
disorders,” Sonneville said. “There’s this 
long-standing myth that eating disorders 
affect skinny, white, affluent girls. … We 
are seeing it across socioeconomic spec-
trum and across racial, ethnic groups. 
What we’re realizing is that the face 
of eating disorders — the stereotypical 
notion of what eating disorders look like 
— is not true.”

Sonneville and Lipson reported a 

startling 49 percent of female students 
engaging 
in 
binge-eating 
behaviors 

and 30 percent in men engaged in these 
behaviors. Female students were also 
more likely to engage in compensatory 
behaviors like food restriction and diet-
ing compared to men — 31 percent to 29 
percent.

“We wanted to get a sense of who is 

actually struggling and suffering on cam-
pus, because unless you understand who 
is suffering, it’s really hard to understand 
how you target early intervention, how 
you target prevention efforts,” Sonnev-
ille said.

Based on these findings, the two 

researchers urge universities to take pre-
ventative actions by conducting earlier 
and more regular eating disorder screen-
ings.

“What we found is that eating disorder 

pathology is really common on college 
campuses. We saw even smaller sex dif-
ferences than others find — with com-
pensatory behaviors like self-induced 
vomiting and compulsive exercising to 
be almost the same among males and 
females in our sample,” Sonneville said.

The ever-rising, incessant presence 

of social media in college culture often 
perpetuates the existing problem. The 
risks of exposure to idealized body types 
through social media is an emerging 
field of research. Bravender spoke about 
unrealistic body images being projected 
through media like Instagram.

“When we saw photoshopped or digi-

tally altered images 10 years ago, it was 
because a beauty company or fashion 
company or diet company was trying to 
sell us a product. Now, if we see a digital-
ly altered image, it might be our friends 
on social media using filters or other 
things,” Sonneville said. “It used to be 
for-profit industries that were trying to 
propagate this ideal, and now, we’re all 
trying to do it. That is a totally new phe-
nomena in eating disorder risk factors.”

Former U-M rower Traci Carson is 

now a Ph.D. candidate in the School of 
Public Health. Having personally expe-
rience with disordered eating, Carson 
spoke about the role of social media in 
her college and graduate school life.

“Being somebody that is constantly 

comparing myself to other people, I have 
seen how social media can be damag-
ing for my own thoughts about food and 
thoughts about my body,” Carson said. 
“In the last few months, I’ve made a con-

scious effort to make sure that the people 
I’m seeing on social media are not people 
who are feeding into my disorder. I will 
delete or unfollow people as soon as I 
see anything that triggers me to want to 
restrict or go exercise more or feel shame 
about the way that I look.”

Shannon Nulf, a School of Music, The-

atre & Dance freshman studying dance, 
echoed Carson’s sentiments. 

“When there’s a medium that’s usually 

edited, polished and filtered, I definitely 
think that plays into a mental self-loath-
ing. When you see all of this perfection 
in social media, that can mess with your 
head,” Nulf said.

She also spoke about the dangers of 

certain social media. Some contain blogs 
or accounts acting as instruction manu-
als for someone at risk or in the midst of 
an eating disorder. Nulf spoke about find-
ing information on specific social media 
sites that encouraged unhealthy habits 
and eating disorders.

“When I was in the throes of anorex-

ia, I was trying to find other people like 
me and see what I was doing,” Nulf said. 
She spoke about using social media sites 
like Tumblr to see how other people 
with anorexia were restricting their food 
intake and cutting weight—She often 
compared their methods to her own or 
looked for ideas on how to continue los-
ing weight. “There are Tumblrs on how 
to have an eating disorder. … It was all 
there for me, it was a resource that I wish 
I hadn’t had.”

Perhaps our next steps may involve 

using this pervasive medium to reach 
large groups of people and encourage 
more constructive ways of thinking about 
food. Bravender spoke about the dangers 
of teenagers and young adults viewing 
social media’s idealized body types as 
direct messages to them.

“If you’re looking at these Instagram 

feeds of perfection and you believe that 
that’s speaking to you and telling you 
how you should be, then it significantly 
raises your risk for developing an eating 
disorder,” Bravender said. “If you’re able 
to push that off to the side and be a savvy 
media consumer and realize that these 
perfect images aren’t possible and real-
ize they’re just images and just a brand 
someone is trying to sell you, then that 
doesn’t confer risk of an eating disorder.”

However, social media doesn’t seem 

to be entirely negative. Nulf and Carson 
raised similar ideas of filtering content 
by unfollowing or selectively choosing 
accounts. Kinesiology freshman Maddie 
Ross has proactively incorporated social 
media into her path to recovery, posting 
on an Instagram account the food she 
makes.

“I started this food Instagram account 

at the beginning of my recovery because 
I found other people who were in recov-
ery on Instagram,” Ross said. “There 
are nutrition blogs that focus on intui-
tive eating and health at every size. You 
have to find the positive pockets in social 

media, because there is so much negative. 
You have to realize where the negative is 
and put your blinders on when you see it 
or get away from it. It’s much easier said 
than done.”

Despite the abundance of these “com-

munication” channels for photos and 
videos, many illness narratives and expe-
riences are left untold.

Ross spoke about the onset of her 

anorexia when she was in middle school 
and high school.

“I felt like I had no control over my 

friendships or anything, but eating was 
the one place I could control. I thought 
that I was being healthy,” she said.

Nulf’s story followed a similar pattern 

of downward spiral and loss of control.

“It was all rooted in a big, body dys-

morphic view I had of myself. Then, it 
just spiraled and spiraled,” she said. “My 
hair started falling out and I just wanted 
to sleep. I started to fight with my friends 
and parents. I couldn’t sleep. I lost my 
period — a lot of medical effects.”

Students, myself included, are often 

unaware of exactly how ubiquitous the 
issue is. For how widespread and lethal 
the consequences are, the lack of dia-

logue on campus is striking.

“Eating disorders in general are dis-

eases of denial and secrecy,” Sonneville 
said. “There is shame, there is fear, there 
are a lot of underlying emotional things 
for someone who is actively struggling.”

Eating disorders, like other mental ill-

nesses, generally lack dialogue on cam-
pus, there is a smaller subpopulation 
within the community that is often over-
looked: athletes.

According to Bravender, there are 

three types of athletic endeavors that 
put students at particular susceptibility 
for developing eating disorders or disor-
dered eating.

The first group are athletes who may 

experience an initial improvement in 
performance from weight loss. These 
often include cross-country or long-dis-
tance runners.

“In people who are at risk, there’s a lit-

tle click that happens, and thinks, ‘Well if 
I lose five pounds and I improved a little 
bit, maybe if I lose 10 pounds I’ll improve 
more,’ and they try that,” Bravender said. 
“Of course, there’s a point of diminishing 
return, and as you lose more weight, your 
running

worsens. And in those 

who are at particular risk, 
they’ll think, ‘Well, I need 
to lose more weight,” and it 
becomes a self-perpetuating 
spiral downwards of worsen-
ing physical condition.”

The second group of ath-

letes are those engaging in 
aesthetic sports where per-
formance is judged subjec-
tively. Dancers, gymnasts 
and figure skaters are com-
mon for this category of sus-
ceptibility.

“There’s no free-throw 

percentage or soccer goal 
being scored. You are per-
forming for a judge, and 
because it’s a performance 
where all eyes are on you, it 
increases the self-conscious-
ness of appearance and rais-
es your risk of developing an 
eating disorder,” Bravender 
explained.

The third group includes 

sports that divide its compet-
itors into weight classes like 
wrestling, judo and rowing. 
According to Bravender, this 
is a massive issue, in which 
athletes feel pressured to 
reduce to their lowest weight 
for competitive advantage. It 
wasn’t until multiple tragic 
deaths of collegiate wres-
tlers that the National Col-
legiate Athletic Association 
made regulations in 2012 
and has since, not observed 
any deaths from unhealthy 
weight cutting practices.

However, 
the 
tensions 

around body image and 
weight remain high among 
college athletes. The shield-
ed nature of the topic makes 
it particularly hard to speak 
about in competitive set-
tings.

“I think it came from the 

Type A nature that is Michi-
gan, that is Michigan sports, 
that is a Michigan student-
athlete. I definitely did not 
see it across my whole team, 
and I can only speak from my 
own experience that it start-
ed much earlier for me than 
rowing,” Carson said.

Carson’s 
sports 
career 

started with soccer and 
then cross-country, until she 
began rowing at the Univer-
sity.

“You can usually pick 

out a rower because they 

are significantly taller than 
other athletes and have 
strong, beautiful shoulders. 
I wouldn’t say that it was my 
sport involvement that lead 
to my desire to fit my desired 
body image that was smaller 
than what I was,” she said. “I 
think for me, it started much 
earlier. I had already had that 
mentality and the disordered 
frame of thinking.”

Nulf’s story shared simi-

lar elements of disorder and 
conformity. She traced the 
beginnings of her abnormal 
relationship with food to her 
earlier figure-skating career.

“I definitely had skating 

coaches who made com-
ments and put pressure on 
kids in our skating clubs to 
look a certain way and be a 
certain way,” she said.

At the beginning of high 

school, she began cross-
country and then dance. 
With the stress of col-
lege auditions for dance 
programs, 
the 
anorexia 

morphed 
into 
something 

else.

“That stress made me 

snap and I really started 
binge-eating, but to compen-
sate for that, I began bing-
ing and purging. It was a 
one-time thing, then it was 
a two-time thing, and then 
a once-a-week thing, until it 
progressed and progressed 
to 
a 
multiple-times-daily 

thing,” Nulf said.

When thinking about the 

heightened risk for eating 
disorders and disordered 
eating among athletes, I 
question my own habits. 
Maybe it’s something in the 
regimented 
training 
that 

permits this sort of body-
mind detachment to occur. 
I remember thinking my 
decisions around food were 
promoting my artistic career 
and therefore saw no nega-
tive consequence in strain-
ing my body — in fact, I was 
proud of my achievements 
in weight loss. However, the 
balance 
between 
perfor-

mance and body image is a 
constant, underlying current 
of tension.

“It’s a huge regret that I 

have,” Carson said. “In col-
lege, what my body looked 
like became more important 
than what my performance 
looked like. … I wanted to be 
the best athlete I could, but 
at that time, the disordered 
thoughts were stronger than 

my rational thoughts.”

Carson spoke about being 

clouded by her disordered 
thoughts that she had con-
vinced herself she was aiding 
her performance.

“I kept losing weight 

through my years, and my 
physical performance went 
down with my weight,” she 
said. “It’s hard for to look 
back at that time because 
I was putting my body 
through so much physical 
and emotional stress, all for 
what I now know was want-
ing to look a certain way.”

As a dancer of 19 years, 

this 
performance-versus-

body sacrifice is something 
that resonates deeply. Sonn-
eville explained this tug of 
war as a common pressure 
among young athletes.

“There is a real trade-off, 

in order to maintain a par-
ticular body type for some 
people is going to require 
disordered eating,” she said. 
“People who have a skill and 
ability in a sport will face a 
moment in their career that 
says, in order to maintain 
this body type, this is a real 
sacrifice I have to make — I 
cannot have both things.”

Sonneville 
emphasized 

the difficulty in this decision, 
especially 
when 
athletes 

are surrounded by people 
who praise them for their 
sport, have parents who have 
invested time and energy, or 
even a coach that reinforces 
unhealthy messages of eat-
ing.

She urges coaches to cul-

tivate a team culture that is 
a safe space. “A place where 
people 
disclose, 
a 
place 

where people are allowed 
to suffer and struggle,” she 
said. “I think you have to 
model vulnerability if you 
are in a position of authority. 
Be particularly mindful of 
who your athletes are, who 
your students are and what 
they’re at risk of.”

As a former U-M athlete, 

Carson reiterates the neces-
sity for fostering the right 
environment for students.

“Seeing help-seeking as 

a strength and not a weak-
ness — I think that’s some-
thing sports struggle with is 
viewing mental health as a 
weakness and it’s not,” Car-
son said. “At the end of the 
day, your mental health is 
more important than your 
physical performance. But 

when you’re in the culture 
of athletics, it doesn’t feel 
that way. Even when I was in 
that place, it didn’t feel that 
way: the team, the team, the 
team.”

However, there is exten-

sive work being done to 
better treat and prevent 
eating-related 
disorders 

among athletes. The NCAA 
has implemented various 
eating 
disorder 
research 

and prevention programs 
like The Female Athlete 
Body Project — an interac-
tive series of verbal, written 
and behavioral exercises to 
promote a healthier lifestyle 
and mindset. Carson stresses 
the importance of mental 
health and pushes for annual 
screenings earlier on in ath-
letes’ careers.

“I really think the ath-

letic department could better 
serve its athletes by allocat-
ing some more funding to 
this area,” Carson said. “I 
think that mental health, 
which includes eating dis-
orders, should be a bigger 
priority. Because without 
mental health, you can’t be a 
great student, a great athlete, 
a great friend, a great team-
mate.”

The urgency for better 

prevention and intervention 
is apparent. Eating disorders 
are a physical and mental 
problem in need of attention 
and appropriate care. It isn’t 
a diet pill or exercise plan you 
can unsubscribe to. It’s much 
more complex.

Sometimes 
I 
wonder 

what my body would be like 
without the scale under the 
piano and the traumatizing 
embarrassment of a target 
weight too far below the 
actual. I wonder if I wouldn’t 
have stopped growing and 
could’ve been taller like my 
brother. Sometimes I won-
der if sacrificing my health 
for my craft was worth it — 
and I still don’t have a clear 
answer.

So where do we being? 

How do we tackle this ill-
ness, this stigma, this fine 
balance between sacrifice 
and well-being?

“I’m hoping we are going 

towards a more holistic 
approach 
to 
prevention,” 

Sonneville said. “Right now, 
there’s a lot of money and 
research dedicated to obesity 
prevention and there’s this 
idea that this has to be dif-
ferent from eating disorder 
prevention. … We are work-
ing towards the same goal, 
but we get stuck in these silos 
with this messaging that is 
off-putting to the other field. 
If we are addressing obesity 
with the expense of increas-
ing weight stigma, body dis-
satisfaction and disordered 
eating, that’s a real prob-
lem.”

As a researcher, former 

athlete and subject of disor-
dered eating, Carson hopes 
to see greater efforts into 
redefining the face of eating 
disorders.

“Eating disorders are not 

about the size of your body, 
they’re about your thoughts. 
I think it’s really good for 
people to be aware of that 
— you may have friends and 
family members who may 
not look like what you see 
on a TV show, but it’s really 
not about your size or your 
BMI,” Carson said. “It’s 
about this obsessive thought 
process 
around 
food. 
I 

always thought I couldn’t 
have an eating disorder — 
I’m not small enough, I’m 
not thin enough. It’s not 
about that.”

Bravender 
pushes 
for 

eating disorders to be rec-
ognized as the medical con-
ditions they are.

“You can look at that as 

having a glass of wine with 
dinner is normal, but if the 
emphasis becomes so much 
on the drinking that you 
become an alcoholic, we treat 
that as an illness,” he said. 
“We don’t treat that as just an 
annoying behavior, there is 
something wrong that needs 
specific treatment.”

Like addiction, like any 

mental illness, eating disor-
ders and disordered eating 
should be treated the same 
way.

“The right thing to do is 

to get treated, just as if you 
had diabetes or cancer or a 
broken leg, you’d seek treat-
ment,” he said. “And there’s 
no stigma attached to those 
other medical issues, why 
should there be for eating 
disorders?”

Personal Statement: Capturing the small sports

W

e’re all taught at a very 
young age that great results 
come from hard work and 

perseverance. Athleticism has always fas-
cinated me, and it’s safe to say that most 
of America feels this way, too. We spend 
hours of our Saturdays glued to the TV 
watching football games. We stay up late 
if our teams are playing in different time 
zones. Sports culture is enormous in the 
United States, and this rings especially 
true at the University of Michigan.

As a senior at the University, I’ve done 

an obscene amount of self reflection 
these past few weeks. More specifically, 
reflecting on my time at The Daily and 
memories of some of the biggest trips 
I’ve taken to cover athletics: to Joe Louis 
Arena for the last “Duel at the D” in histo-
ry, to Kansas City (which isn’t actually in 
Kansas) to see Oregon defeat Michigan in 
the Sweet Sixteen by one point, to Iowa to 
see the Hawkeyes defeat the Wolverines 
by one point. These were all exciting and 
monumental moments in my photogra-
phy career, but I find myself reflecting on 
small, less popular sports as some of the 
pinnacle moments in crafting my images. 
I believe it will always be the less popular 
sports like women’s basketball, lacrosse 
or tennis, that I can accredit to my suc-
cess.

There are certain photos you have to 

capture at major sports like football, 
basketball or hockey. There’s immense 
pressure to get these photos because cap-
turing the biggest moments of action are 
critical. If you fail, it’s obvious; your pub-
lication doesn’t feature the shots. While 
I am always grateful to be able to cover 
football or men’s basketball, it oftentimes 
feels as though the creative, storytell-
ing aspect isn’t as important as getting 
these game-specific shots. If you miss 
a touchdown or scored point, your work 
doesn’t seem to hold as much credibil-
ity compared to someone who captured 
every pivotal moment in a game. While 
this pressure creates incredible oppor-
tunities for growth in the field of sports 
photography, I sometimes feel as though 
my creative voice is lost in the demand 
for specific photographs. Though photo-
graphing the big sports provides a unique 
wave of energy, I often prefer the intima-
cy of smaller ones.

I can still remember my first time walk-

ing into the Crisler Center to photograph 
women’s basketball — it was my first 
time photographing a Michigan Athletics 
event. I’m sure I looked like I had no idea 
what I was doing (two different event staff 
asked if I knew where I was going), but I 
was determined. Even though this was an 

important game against Michigan’s bit-
ter rival Ohio State, hardly any photog-
raphers were present. The atmosphere in 
Crisler felt relaxed, but I still felt the need 
to purely capture action shots.

During my second basketball game a 

few weeks later, I walked into Crisler and 
noticed a sea of pink: pink jerseys, pink 
shoes, pink headbands, pink pompoms. 
I quickly learned it was the team’s annu-
al Pink Game, an afternoon spent pay-
ing tribute to those fighting or who have 
already fought against breast cancer. This 
was my second time taking photographs 
of a Michigan game. I snapped a few pho-
tos of the pink elements but figured they 
wouldn’t have much use because they 
weren’t action-related. During halftime, a 
Daily reporter found me on the court and 
said he was writing about the impact and 
importance of the Pink Game. He asked if 
I could try to capture as many pink-related 
photos as I could because they would add 
to the story. It seemed like a simple ges-
ture at the time, but this moment had a 
profound impact on my view of sports pho-

tography.

I still hold onto this moment today — it 

has taught me time and time again to cap-
ture stories beyond just the game itself. 
Though peak action shots are important 
to any given game, it’s equally as impor-
tant to tell a story with my photography 
— especially one that isn’t often told. The 
smaller sports at Michigan often don’t 
receive much publicity. As a photogra-
pher, I believe it’s part of my responsibil-
ity to give these teams the same attention I 
would the football, hockey and basketball 
teams.

With this in mind, I cover as many 

Michigan Athletics events as my schedule 
allows. My favorite is covering women’s 
gymnastics.

While popular sports like football 

present the challenge of capturing the 
perfect image of peak action, gymnas-
tics has its own set of challenges: find-
ing a unique angle that fully captures the 
event. Women’s gymnastics never fails 
to present me with this wonderful chal-
lenge of finding unique angles. Meets are 

always fast-paced, not taking any time for 
lengthy breaks in between events. With a 
challenge to create unique visual imagery 
with each different meet I photograph, 
this sport gives me tools to succeed in any 
other sport I’m shooting. If I feel myself 
getting too comfortable in a position on 
the hardwood floor, I force myself to move 
elsewhere to find a new angle. Though 
I’m not actually performing the difficult 
routines that gymnasts do, I perform to 
capture their grace and elegance in their 
athleticism. That is the challenge of story-
telling.

I’ve received photo credentials on behalf 

of The Daily to access places like Joe Louis 
Arena, the Sprint and Kohl Centers, and 
the Kinnick and Beaver Stadiums. Though 
I proudly display the fancy photo creden-
tials that hang on my wall, every other 
credential I’ve ever received from photo-
graphing Michigan Athletics events hangs 
right next to them, reminding me of all 
the smaller, intimate sports moments that 
have led me to where I am today.

Last Saturday I went to Detroit to practice night photogrphy from the top of the Z Parking Garage in Detroit. The Z Garage is a popular location for photographers to 
shoot from, as the tenth level provides 360 degree views of the city. This was my first time using a tripod and shooting the bright lights of the city at night, so I wasn’t 

confident that they would turn out well. However, I ended up happy with the result, and shooting Detroit after dark is something I definitely want to do again.
