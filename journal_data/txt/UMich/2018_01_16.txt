We often think of movements 

or even advocacy in general as 
something visible. If we can’t see 
it, we don’t feel it’s happening. 
Oftentimes movements are visible 
or at least have some tangible 
components. 
What 
do 
you 

remember about the civil rights 

movement? Probably Rosa Parks 
refusing to be moved from her seat, 
the Montgomery Bus Boycott and 
Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have 
a Dream” speech. We hardly ever 
think of all the preparation and 
invisible, deliberate actions that 
fueled the movement. It was not 
simply a series of random events.

When we hear “advocacy,” the 

first things that come to mind are 
usually sit-ins, picket signs, walks 

and other forms of visible, tangible 
protest. The University of Michigan 
is especially known for these. 
These forms are important but 
not always accessible. They often 
require someone in a position of 
power or with the physical ability 
to spearhead them. So what about 
other forms of advocacy, what 
about invisible protest?

You might be wondering how 

any change could come to be with 

invisible 
advocacy. 
Invisibility 

doesn’t mean that no actions are 
taken but maybe those actions 
appear minuscule, yet they add 
up. To me, it means choosing NOT 
to do something and rather to do 
something else. By that definition, it 
is the other half of visible protest. It 
is the decision to not support causes 
we are against. The decision to not 
use violence. The decision to not 
give our time, energy or money to 
corrupt businesses. These decisions 
can be just as powerful as their 
counterparts. 
Especially, 
when 

they are given the same weight. 
What I mean is, often times people 
are called out for not being active 
enough, for not attending the sit-
ins, walks or other protests. I don’t 
think that’s fair. It doesn’t consider

President Mark Schlissel was 
honored Monday evening as one of 
four recipients of the Let Freedom 
Ring Award at the Cobo Center in 
Detroit. The award was presented 
by the Rainbow PUSH Automotive 
Project, an organization founded 
by civil rights activist Rev. Jesse 
Jackson that seeks to promote 
participation by people of color in 

the economic growth of the global 
automotive industry.

Rainbow 
PUSH 
selected 

Schlissel as an honoree for making 
college more affordable through 
the implementation of the Go Blue 
Guarantee, as well as his strategic 
plan on diversity, equity and 
inclusion.

Schlissel’s tenure has been 

rocked by campus controversy on 
race in particular, after an uptick 
in racist incidents and resulting 
student protest across campus.

Upon accepting his award, 

Schlissel 
also 
related 
the 

University’s 
work 
to 
improve 

education and college affordability 
to the work of Martin Luther 
King Jr., highlighting the value of 
inclusivity on campus and within 
the 
administration. 
As 
such, 

Schlissel said he hopes the Go 
Blue Guarantee offers more equal 
opportunity to all.

“The University of Michigan is 

proud to embrace both the quality 
and morality of education that 
Dr. King championed,” Schlissel 
said. “We want all of Michigan’s 
talented students to know that if 
they work hard and study that a U

Invisible activism: The 
labor driving movements

DARBY STIPE/Daily
DARBY STIPE/Daily
ALEXANDRIA POMPEI/Daily

King’s activism was unpopular throughout his 
life. How will we continue his quest for justice?

Every year since 1986, we, 

as a nation, have celebrated 
Martin Luther King Jr. Day on 
the third Monday of January. 

Martin 
Luther 
King 
Jr. 
is 

viewed as the architect of racial 
harmony in this country, and 
not many figures in our history 
are revered more. Not long after 
King’s death were legislatures 
and prominent leaders of the 
civil rights movement calling 
for 
a 
national 
holiday 
to 

commemorate his work and life. 
However, the idea that King 
should be celebrated for his 
contributions to society was one 
that was polarizing along racial 
lines. After years of debate and 
defeat, in 1983, President Ronald 

Reagan signed a bill making 
Martin Luther King Jr. Day a 
national holiday. Now, students 
get a day off from school, leaders 
participate in acts of service 
to marginalized communities 
and social media is abuzz with 
various quotes. Yet, many times 
the full story of King is not told 
or remembered, in favor of one 
that is more convenient.

King’s teachings, like that 

of Jesus (and other religious 
figures), are easiest to digest 
when we accept those that do 
not make us uncomfortable, 

while ignoring those that do. 
As a society we have decided 
that a whitewashed King is 
his only palatable version. We 
proclaim his words that evoke 
positive emotion, such as this 
one given in a sermon on loving 
your enemies: “Darkness cannot 
drive out darkness: Only light 
can do that. Hate cannot drive 
out hate: Only love can do 
that.” Yet, it is still important 
to celebrate the fact that King 
called for resistance when it was 
necessary, like in this particular 
instance: “Our only hope today 

lies in our ability to recapture 
the revolutionary spirit and go 
out into a sometimes hostile 
world 
declaring 
eternal 

hostility to poverty, racism, and 
militarism.”

Remember that King was a 

culture shifter. His mission was 
to alter the status quo, a task 
that is inherently disruptive. We 
must remind ourselves that the 
universally loved and admired 
man that today stands over 
Washington, D.C. in stone as a 
national monument, was once 
a controversial figure. Public 

opinion polling suggests that 
most Americans viewed King 
as a menace to the social fabric. 
However, he persisted with 
his peaceful protest and civil 
disobedience because it was just, 
irrespective of popularity. In 
the same light, modern protests 
of injustice that are villainized 
by President Trump, reported 
negatively about in the media and 
enjoy low approval amongst the 
populous must continue. NFL

national anthem before football 
games last season, for example, 
is extremely polarizing. Yet, 
he has ignited a discussion 
about race that most Americans 
would have preferred to not 

discuss. Like King and many 
other leaders of the civil rights 
movement, Kaepernick faces 
negative 
consequences 
for 

taking a stand. Despite having 
been villainized and losing his 
job, he is unapologetically a 
force for justice. History will 
remember his sacrifice.

King believed in building 

bridges instead of walls, but 
he didn’t turn his back to 
injustice just to appease the 
attitudes of moderates. And, if 
he were alive today, he would 
probably be one of the most 
vocal critics of the current 
administration and, frankly, 
the nation’s blatant regression 
on the issue of race. President 

Barack Obama’s historic 2008 
presidential victory was seen 
as a breakthrough in the state 
of America’s race relations, a 
sign that most Americans were 
finally over the idea of skin 
color. 

how hard it may be for someone 
to be physically or emotionally 
present in those spaces, which 
aren’t always the most welcoming.

As 
a 
Black 
woman 
who 

practices Islam — and yes in 
that order from my most to least 
salient identity — I never feel 
comfortable at the front lines of 

protest. I feel like I’m expected to 
act a certain to correctly portray 
my identities. Advocates love to 
talk about the burden of labor and 
how the oppressed shouldn’t have 
to explain how they’re oppressed 
to their oppressors but then still 
expect them to participate in 
the labor of protesting. I used to 
not consider myself an advocate 
because I never attended protests. 
I felt more emotionally drained 
than uplifted by the thought of 
the masses participating in the 

same activity. I would rather write 
down how I feel than yell it in a 
march.

I think we’ve forgotten about 

the less flashy forms of advocacy. 
We are in the age of instant 
gratification. If it’s not headlining 
the news, gone viral or trending 
on social media, we don’t know it’s 
happening. We take movements 
and turn them into convenient 
hashtags like #BlackLivesMatter 
only for them to be repurposed and 
their meaning stripped away into 

something like #AllLivesMatter. 
Once it’s out of the spotlight 
we forget about it. Without a 
documentary here and a movie 
there, we wouldn’t know that Flint 
still doesn’t have clean water along 
with 32 other cities across the U.S.

We 
volunteer, 
which 
is 

great, 
then 
post 
a 
picture 

to 
validate 
our 
labor. 
 

When I first wrote this piece, it 

wasn’t in response to any event in 
particular. Rather, I was motivated 
to write after listening to the 
dialogue happening on campus and 
around the country about activism 
during the Trump era. All too often, 
people — our classmates, neighbors, 
friends and family — eschew 
justice in favor of the status quo. 
As the article goes on to mention, 
Martin Luther King Jr. rejected this 
stance. In fact, the reverend went 
on to claim that the people “who 
constantly say, ‘I agree with you in 
the goal you seek, but I cannot agree 
with your methods of direct action’” 
(not the Klansmen, nor the “alt-
right” nor the Donald Trumps of 
the world) pose the greatest threat 
to racial equality. As we begin the 
50th year since Martin Luther King 
Jr.’s assassination, and celebrate 
his life 89 years after his birth, it’s 
crucial to look back and reflect on 

his words. Though our modern-day 
struggles don’t manifest exactly the 
same as the ones that faced King, 
their root causes are the same: 
hate, racism and bigotry. It’s our 
job to do what we can to fight these 
forces, even if the fight makes us 
uncomfortable. We cannot let the 
Trumps and the Richard Spencers 
of the world prevail, but the only 
way to effectively stop them is if 
everyone takes a stand. 

Imagine this: It’s a Sunday 

afternoon and you’re on your way 
home for the evening. To your 
annoyance, the route you normally 
take has more traffic than normal. 
Initially, the bumper-to-bumper 
backup is inching along, but it 
quickly grinds to a complete halt. 
After a while, you turn on the 
radio to find out what’s causing 
the holdup. Surprisingly, you 
learn it’s not due to an accident 
or overturned truck; it’s due to a 
protest organized against racism 
and discrimination. How would 
you respond?

Now, how would your response 

change if this were on March 
7, 1965, and the road you were 
stuck on was Route 80, just 
outside of Selma, Ala.? The day 
is “Bloody Sunday,” and activist 
John Lewis is marching with 
about 600 protesters from Selma 
to Montgomery. Regardless of 
how you claim to feel about the 
civil rights movement, chances 
are that your current reaction to 
anti-racism demonstrations (from 
Black Lives Matter protests to 
NFL players taking a knee during 
the national anthem) would be 
identical to how you would have 
reacted during the civil rights 
movement 50 years ago.

Don’t believe me? According 

to a Gallup poll conducted in 
October of 1964, almost three-
fourths of Americans believed 
civil rights demonstrators should 
stop protesting, despite many of 
their demands being unfulfilled. 
Additionally, a New York Times poll 
conducted during the same year 

found that a majority of white 
New Yorkers felt civil rights 
protesters had gone too far, 
with common complaints about 
“negroes receiving ‘everything 
on a silver platter’” and the 
growth of perceived “reverse 
discrimination” against whites. 
These sentiments are still cited 
by Americans who denounce 
efforts 
to 
create 
a 
more 

inclusive country, from critics 
of kneeling to people against 
affirmative action. Ironically, 
while these people probably 
would have been against the 
civil rights movement had they 
been alive at the time, they are 
the first to wistfully compare 
today’s 
demonstrations 
to 

demonstrations of the past, as 
if their attitudes would be any 
different.

In addition to those who are 

seemingly against any form of 
protest, there are even more 
people who support the cause 
of racial equality but do little to 
support it. In fact, they’re often 
more critical of the methods 
demonstrators use to achieve 
equality than about the issues 
being protested in the first 

place. Usually, you can spot this 
happening when someone wishes 
protesters used less obstructive 
means. While they may explicitly 
say something along the lines of 
“I get where they’re coming from, 
I just wish they didn’t protest like 
that,” what they’re really saying 
is “I acknowledge an issue exists, 
but I’m not willing to do anything 
to solve it because it doesn’t affect 
me.” As a result, demonstrators 
are forced to use “obstructive” 
methods 
— 
blocking 
roads, 

holding sit-ins and interrupting 
the status quo — to ensure 
people actually listen to them. 
Otherwise, their message would 
likely be ignored by the apathetic 
masses who prioritize their day-
to-day convenience above the 
issues 
affecting 
marginalized 

communities.

Martin 
Luther 
King 
Jr. 

famously wrote about this in his 
1963 “Letter from a Birmingham 
Jail.” In the essay, King argued 
moderates who sit idly by and 
allow 
oppression 
to 
happen 

(despite being ostensibly against 
racism and discrimination), are 
more dangerous than Klansmen. 
Those “more devoted to ‘order’ 
than to justice; who (prefer) 
a negative peace which is the 
absence of tension to a positive 
peace which is the presence of 
justice; who constantly say, ‘I agree 
with you in the goal you seek, but I 
cannot agree with your methods of 
direct action’” present the greatest 
danger to those seeking equality. 
This is just as true today as it was 
half a century ago.

All of this begs an important 

question: 
How 
will 
you 
be 

remembered by history? While it 
was acceptable to be against the 
civil rights movement in the 1960s, 
pictures 
of 
counterprotesters 

standing outside of integrated 
schools 
draw 
disgust 
today. 

Anybody who currently thinks the 
civil rights activists were out of line 
is rightfully seen as bigoted — and 
I firmly believe 50 years from now, 
critics of today’s campaigns for 
racial equality will be seen in the 
same light. Now is your chance to 
stand on the right side of history, 
even if you have to stand alone.

Broderick Johnson talks engagement

progress which still needs to 
be made toward social justice, 
especially at the University.

“(The symposium) reflects 

a desire to do good in the 
world and help create a better, 
more just and more equitable 
society,” he said. “We know 
there is so much more for us 
to do, because while talent 
is equally distributed in our 
society, 
opportunity 
most 

certainly is not.”

According to Harper, it is 

“shameful” that today’s society 
and activists are still facing the 
same issues of social and racial 
injustice Martin Luther King 
Jr. worked to address 50 years 
ago.

“It’s a shame for me to stand 

here, next to this podium, 
talking about the exact same 
things that he was talking 
about,” he said. “We have to 
hold a mirror up to that and 
realize that that is shameful. 
And you know where that falls? 
That falls on us.”

This 
symposium 
holds 

special 
significance 
in 
the 

wake of a year of bias incidents 
and hatred directed against 
communities 
of 
color 
and 

other marginalized groups — 
ranging from racist vandalism 
in West Quad Residence Hall 
to racist slurs being painted on 
downtown buildings.

In an earlier interview with 

The Daily, E. Royster Harper, 
vice president of Student Life, 
expressed 
the 
importance 

of working towards a more 
inclusive campus community in 
light of the divisive narratives 

being expressed in the national 
news media.

“Students don’t come here 

in a vacuum, so they’ve been 
watching and listening to the 
national 
narrative, 
all 
the 

divisiveness and the vileness, 
and they’ve seen it on television, 
they’ve seen it on social media, 
and you think ‘I’m going off 
to school, and I’m all excited 
about that, and I’ve got to come 
here?’” she said. “Particularly 
when we promote and advertise 
something different. So we 
talk about our aspirations, the 
kind of community we want 
to be — it’s not the community 
we are yet, but it’s the kind of 
community we want to be.”

LSA 
freshman 
Jazmine 

Johnson thought this message 
of responsibility was especially 
relevant 
and 
powerful 
for 

today’s 
social 
and 
political 

climate.

“I thought it was really 

inspiring seeing (Harper) talk 
about (those struggles) and how 
they are still happening today,” 
she said.

Harper spoke of the power 

individual 
actions 
play 
in 

making the changes Martin 
Luther 
King 
Jr. 
dedicated 

his life to. Following with 
his message of “power is the 
people,” he emphasized the 
difference that can be made by 
each individual, especially by 
participating in elections at all 
levels of government. He also 
encouraged the audience to 
consider what they are willing 
to do to make the world a better 
place and to act on that intuition 
by refusing to let anything hold 
them back from standing up for 
justice.

“Elections matter,” Harper 

said. 
“Solidarity 
matters 
… 

Everyone here who has an 
intuition or a notion, we need 
you. We need your greatness, 
we need your inspiration. We 
need you to step out and step 
in.”

Harper said this potential for 

positive change comes down to 
the strength of positive energy.

“We can turn our potential 

energy into kinetic energy,” he 
said. “And as we turn our kinetic 
energy on, we start to feel a 
fire. You start to feel something 
happening in your spirit … And 
you start to say ‘We can do this, 
and we will do this, and this is 
how we are going to get there’ 
… We are all we need, because 
the power is the people. And 
so as we think about that, own 
the power. Own your greatness. 
We need you. The legacy of Dr. 
King calls for you, pleads for 
you to come out.”

Music,

Dance 

freshman 
Sarah 
Morgan 

said she believed the central 
message of the symposium was 
inspiring and impactful.

“I think the quote ‘power is 

the people’ will really resonate 
(with) me and I’ll take that 
wherever I go,” she said. 

Harper concluded his speech 

by leading the audience in a 
pledge to always harness their 
energy and their power to stand 
up for what is right.

“I will not allow fear to stop 

me from taking actions that I 
already know I should take,” 
he said. “Instead, I will act, 
encourage, with heart. I will 
fight and I will change the 
world. I will help humanity. I 
will fight for social justice. The 
power is the people. The power 
is the us. The power is me.”

because talent is ubiquitous in our 
society, but opportunity is not.”

Jackson and Schlissel last 

crossed paths in public last 
November during a symposium 
in Jackson’s honor. Following 
President 
Donald 
Trump’s 

election last November, Jackson 
spoke on campus in support of 
an anti-racist walkout that drew 
more than a thousand students. 
Organized by Students4Justice 
in the aftermath of not just the 
election, but a spate of racist 
incidents on campus, the walkout 
aimed to “hold President Schlissel 
and our Regents at the University 
of Michigan accountable for their 
claims of valuing diversity and 
student safety and well-being.” 
Student protesters also birthed 
the viral #schlisselwyahashtag 
last fall, asking “Schlissel, where 
you 
at?” 
after 
inconclusive 

investigations and a strategic plan 
many deemed too far-sighted. 

Jackson received a standing 

ovation as he described current 
political 
movements 
and 

encouraged 
those 
who 
feel 

marginalized not to adjust, but 
to take action and rise above the 
maltreatment that may be felt 
from those in positions of power.

“It’s dangerous to be ignorant 

in a high place,” Jackson said. 
“Beyond culture and color is 
something called character.”

The Guarantee — a historic 

pledge of four years of waived 
tuition for Michigan residents 
with a family income of $65,000 
or less — has achieved preliminary 
success in encouraging more 
applications from lower-income 
students. 
Still, 
socioeconomic 

diversity at the University is sorely 
lacking. The University ranked 
last in socioeconomic mobility 
amongst peer institutions in a 
study by the Equality Opportunity 
Project — one in ten students 
are in the one percent of income 
distribution.

In a previous interview, Kedra 

Ishop, vice provost for enrollment 
management, said the Guarantee 
needs further work to make sure 
the program doesn’t ignore the 
needs of new students from lower 
socioeconomic strata.

“We all have a responsibility 

to make sure that we help our 
students become part of the 
U-M experience,” she said. “It’s a 
challenging endeavor for us and 
we don’t always get it right the first 
time but I think we’ve put a great 
deal of effort … into identifying 
students, identifying their needs, 
to make sure they’re supported by 
the University.”

Other recipients of the award 

included Bankole Thompson of 
The Detroit News, Flint mayor 
Karen Weaver and Archbishop 
Desmond 
Tutu, 
humanitarian 

leader and civil rights activist. 
Before awards were presented, 
audience members heard from 
several 
speakers, 
including 

U.S. Reps. Brenda Lawrence, 
D-Detroit, and Debbie Dingell, 
D-Ann Arbor, as well as Rev. Jesse 
Jackson, who accepted the award 
on behalf of Tutu in his absence.

When addressing the audience, 

Lawrence 
highlighted 
the 

importance 
of 
remembrance 

on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, 
explaining that taking action in 
the face of oppression would allow 
King’s dream to be furthered 
within a democracy.

“While we stand here today 

and reflect on the history of a great 
man … Will they be able to say that 

we stood up and fought when they 
tried to roll back our rights and 
freedoms?” Lawrence said. “We 
talk about a dream but this is about 
action.”

Though Schlissel was selected 

as an honoree, many students felt 
that his actions this past semester 
— specifically toward students of 
color — did not warrant an award. 
LSA senior LaKyrra Magee, a 
co-founder 
of 
S4J, 
criticized 

Schlissel for his insensitivity 
toward members of the Black 
community.

“Mark Schlissel is the same 

University president that pulled 
Black students at every level from 
the University of Michigan into 
a room and told them he wanted 
to ‘learn’ to be a more sensitive 
person,” Magee wrote in an email 
interview. “Someone who tries 
to exploit Black students for their 
labor doesn’t deserve an award but 
(instead) a course to learn how to 
deconstruct white supremacy.”

LSA senior Jamie Thompson, 

also an S4J founding organizer, 
echoed 
Magee’s 
sentiment. 

This semester, she wrote in 
an email interview, Schlissel’s 
consideration of granting white 
supremacist Richard Spencer’s 
request to speak on campus 
contradicts the principles of DEI.

“Allowing Richard Spencer to 

come to campus works against 
every tenant of DEI and goes 
against what he says are values 
of ‘education, social justice and 
equality,’” Thompson wrote. “Not 
only is (Schlissel) co-opting the 
work of black student activists 
and faculty by taking credit for 
these achievements, he is actively 
participating in white supremacy 
on this campus and stripping away 
the small sense of safety and voice 
that students of color have.”

As we enter into our new 

editorial 
positions 
at 
The 

Michigan Daily, we find ourselves 
at the crossroads of campus, on 
the cusp of moments interrogating 
sexual harassment, racism at the 
University of Michigan and the 
intersections of inequity. Getting 
the news right has never been 
more important. And more than 
ever, our readers are at the heart 
of what we do.

It’s a new year at the news desk. 

Allow us to reintroduce ourselves.

EQUITY
We live and work on a campus 

that is 65 percent white, and 
where two-thirds of students 
are in the top 20 percent of the 
income bracket. Ann Arbor wears 
the mask of a liberal bubble, but 
students and administrators with 
privilege create all sorts of unfair 
playing fields across campus.

We also acknowledge The Daily 

has reproduced this inequity. The 
list of repeated mistakes goes 
on, from inaccurate headlines to 
racist cartoons to misgendering 
to sometimes overlooking stories 
altogether. In order to move 
forward, we must acknowledge 

our past.

The same stale demographics 

that 
plague 
the 
University 

pervade our staff as well. Eighty-
five percent of news reporters 
are white, and nearly 45 percent 
hail from household incomes of 
$200,000 a year or more. 

We can’t listen, read and report 

accurately through homogeneity. 
Which is why we’re investing in 
reporters from underrepresented 
backgrounds, closing gaps in 
financial aid opportunities and 
training our current editors to 
own their privilege. We commit 
to leveling the playing field in 
reporting and recruiting this year. 
We commit to equity.

ACCOUNTABILITY
As 
we 
write 
this 
letter, 

administrators limit the release of 
information on Richard Spencer’s 
request to speak on campus. Greek 
life chapters refer to action plans 
in response to patterns of hazing 
and sexual assault. Tuition rates 
and yearly budgets tick up every 
year. Important details get lost in 
the moving parts of tense politics 
at the University, in Ann Arbor 
and across the country.

The Daily is positioned to hold 

all of these players accountable 
and amplify those speaking truth 
to power. We recognize the role 
we play as the only daily print 
publication in the county. This 

year, we’re increasing the number 
of FOIAs we file, getting more 
public officials on the record 
(and live streamed!) and sourcing 
information from our readers. 

(Do you have an issue you think 

needs investigating? Send a tip via 
this live form.)

We commit to not just keeping 

track of those in power, but 
keeping them in check, too. We 
commit to accountability.

More than anything else, we 

commit to you, the reader. There 
is no one more important to this 
work than you, your tips and your 
trust.

We know trust must be earned. 

We ask you to hold us to the 

promises and goals we’ve laid 
out here, and to call us on our 
mistakes.

We have a duty to serve the 

contract between ourselves and 
our readers — the student body 
and Ann Arbor community— as 
best as we can. “Best” has meant 
different things in the last few 
years: 
efficiency, 
speediness 

or being digitally-minded. For 
the students of color and first-
generation students, the survivors 
and the undocumented, for all 
those underserved by our paper 
in years past: this year, we won’t 
forget equity and accountability 
along the way.

Broderick Johnson, a former 

member of the Obama and 
Clinton administrations, along 
with University of Michigan 
professors and directors, spoke 
on engaging with students of 
color and promoting greater 
access to education and job 
placements at the “Innovative 
programs for youth and young 
adults” 
panel, 
part 
of 
the 

University’s Rev. Dr. Martin 
Luther King Jr. Symposium.

During his time in the Obama 

administration, Johnson served 
as Cabinet Secretary and the 
chair of the White House’s My 
Brother’s Keeper Task Force, 
which 
addressed 
persistent 

opportunity gaps faced by young 
men of color by connecting them 
to mentoring, support networks 
and the skills they need to find a 
good job or attend college. As of 
Monday evening, Johnson is also 
the newest member of the Ford 
school’s faculty. Public policy 
dean Michael Barr announced 
Johnson’s appointment as a 
Policy Maker in Residence in an 
email to students. 

At 
the 
panel, 
Johnson 

discussed how his motivation to 
create My Brother’s Keeper was 
strengthened by the shooting 
death of Trayvon Martin. He said 
the president wanted to create 
a strong program for African-
American youth with the backing 
of the federal government.

“I had the opportunity to 

speak to the president right after 

the 2012 election campaign,” 
Johnson said. “He talked about 
how he really wanted to go big, 
to use the power and the reach of 
his presidency to better organize 
how the federal government 
established programs and use 
his power as a convener to bring 
people together across the public 
and private sectors in the United 
States.”

According to Johnson, Obama 

wanted the task force to produce 
evidence-based results and to 
assess the problems and the 
solutions with the same level 
of rigor that he demanded in 
everything else from the White 
House.

Within the last three years of 

Obama’s second term in office, 
Johnson, with the My Brother’s 
Keeper Task Force, was able to 
identify six milestones in the 
lives of young adults that impact 
their levels of success and adopt 
an expansive and comprehensive 
approach to examine the data. 
The initiative also created the 
Second Chance Pell Grant, which 
was a collaboration between 
the Department of Justice and 
the Department of Education 
granting 12,000 Pell Grants to 
people incarcerated across the 
United States. 

Johnson 
said 
the 
Second 

Chance Pell Grant initiative 
helps 
incarcerated 
people 

across the country start their 
educational career while serving 
their court-mandated sentence.

“The route to jail and to prison 

is often times about economic 
and educational deprivation so 
an important way to stay out … is 

to help people get an education in 
prison,” Johnson said.

The 
Task 
Force’s 

recommendations 
also 

influenced President Obama’s 
executive order to remove the 
mandatory yes-or-no question 
regarding whether an applicant 
has been previously incarcerated. 
This practice of asking about 
a criminal record at the first 
step in the application process 
takes a particularly increased 
toll on applicants of color, who 
are disproportionately arrested, 
convicted 
and 
sentenced, 

according to Johnson.

Following 
Johnson, 
Brian 

Jacob, the Walter H. Annenberg 
professor of education policy 
at the University, discussed the 
regional programs created by 
Grow Detroit’s Young Talent, 
a 
city-wide 
summer 
jobs 

program that employs young 
adults in Detroit between the 
ages of 14 and 24. The program 
includes several hours per week 
of training on topics such as 
financial literacy and workplaces 
readiness. 
The 
younger 

participants work approximately 
20 hours per week for six weeks. 

Jacob noted GDYT is different 

from other summer employment 
programs as it not only provides 
opportunities 
in 
community-

based 
nongovernmental 

organizations, but also in the 
private sector. Private sector 
companies which partner with 
GDYT include Quicken Loans, 
Touchpoint 
Support 
Services 

and Blue Cross Blue Shield.

In reporting the effects of 

summer 
youth 
employment 

programs 
(SYEPs), 
Johnson 

admitted 
there 
were 
mixed 

results. A positive result was 
the large reduction of criminal 
arrests. 
In 
Chicago, 
violent 

crime arrests were reduced 
by 43 percent; however, these 
results cannot be attributed 
solely to SYEPs because the 
percentage also decreased in the 
winter. Similar decreases and 
limitations were seen in New 
York City, according to Jacob.

Luke 
Shaefer, 
director 

of Poverty Solutions at the 
University, discussed the SYEP 
created 
by 
the 
University 

to 
address 
socioeconomic 

inequality in the larger Ann 
Arbor community. One of the 
ways the University is seeking to 
address this is with the Go Blue 
Guarantee, a scholarship that 
promises 
Michigan 
residents 

with a family income less than 
$65,000 who are admitted to the 
University full cost of four-year 
in-state tuition covered.

Shaefer 
noted 
initially, 

students 
from 
low-income 

families were disproportionately 
opting out of applying to the 
University as they felt they 
couldn’t afford the tuition prior 
to the Guarantee.

While the effort to attract 

more students of color from low-
income families to the University 
is appreciated, some students feel 
that the effort doesn’t continue 
once students arrive at school. 

On Monday, as a part of the 

University of Michigan’s Rev. 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day 
Symposium, 
more 
than 
300 

students and faculty attended a 
lecture by guest speaker James 
Forman Jr., a Yale University 
professor who drew his dialogue 
largely from his career as a public 
defender and his book, “Locking Up 
Our Own: Crime and Punishment 
in Black America.”

Bayrex Martí, assistant dean 

for Student Life at the Law 
School, opened the event and 
provided several words on King’s 
life, emphasizing the need for 
continuous action.

“This is a day that we challenge 

instead of congratulate ourselves,” 
Martí said. “As others have stated, 
this is also a week in which the 
University celebrates the successes 
of African descendants for equality, 
while acknowledging the progress 
we still have to make to reach full 
equality and respect for all.”

Forman opened the discussion 

by highlighting his background 
and 
childhood 
in 
Georgia, 

explaining 
his 
experiences 

watching the growth of prisons 
and the increasing statistics that 
illustrate the high correlation 
between African American males 
and incarceration. He explained 
that 
mass 
incarceration 
has 

become a human rights crisis in the 
U.S., which led him to realize his 
calling as a public defender.

“That reality showed me the 

unfinished business of the civil 
rights movement,” Forman said.

Forman 
outlined 
the 

tumultuous relationship between 
Black 
communities 
and 
the 

government, reaffirming that the 
U.S. is still a country that has lived 
with slavery longer than it hasn’t. 
He said this institutionalized 
racism still shapes our government 
and, 
combined 
with 
limited 

allocation 
of 
resources, 
these 

factors have acted as detriments 
to socioeconomic development in 
Black communities.

He continued to point out, while 

African Americans have garnered 
more 
political 
representation, 

their power is mainly concentrated 
at a local level. Furthermore, in 
response to the many community 
issues 
presented 
by 
these 

representatives, a stronger stance 
on prosecution and police force 
has always been elected over the 
implementation of education policy 
or 
community 
revitalization. 

Forman provided a hypothetical 
scenario 
of 
a 
representative’s 

experience 
with 
crafting 

legislation to fight drug addiction 
as an example of this favoring of 
prosecution over education.

Managing News Editors


I 

spent 
the 
majority 

of 
my 
Winter 
Break 

watching 
CNN 
while 

doing some reading. It felt 
like every few seconds, I 
was hit with a “breaking” 
story that made me turn my 
eyes toward the television. 
Then, I was spun around by a 
ringing notification from the 
New York Times telling me 
there’s another story I have 
to read. Before I can even 
open the app, I would get an 
email telling me that there’s 
another 
news 
story 
that 

requires my attention.

Could it have been a big 

story that’s just developing 
and 
requires 
the 
public’s 

immediate attention in every 
medium? Unfortunately no. 
All three of these stories 
were either day-to-day events 
in the Trump White House 
(a press conference was just 
starting), an article from 
The New York Times about 
a diabetes epidemic in India 
and a daily briefing on politics 
from The Hill. And yet all 
of these stories attempted 
to convince me to read their 
story first by parading around 
as critically important to my 
political awareness.

I’ve 
always 
questioned 

the efficacy of a journalist 
slamming a symbolic fist on 
the table in an attempt to 
change the reader’s mind. 
In today’s day and age, we 
have more information at our 
fingertips than ever before, 
but that doesn’t mean that 
we’ve become adept at sifting 
through this information to 
create coherent messages that 
can influence opinion. For 
instance, 
while 
magazines 

can celebrate the news media 
influencing public opinion, 
we are left with marginal 
gains at the most. About one 
in 50 people with access 
to these particular stories 
had 
ideological 
shifts 
in 

the direction of the opinion 
articles they read.

This 
requires 
an 

astonishing feat that isn’t 
quite 
acknowledged: 
A 

journalist 
does 
not 
only 

need 
an 
attentive 
reader, 

but a reader who is willing 
to comprehend the article, 
spend 
cognitive 
resources 

negotiating this article with 
existing opinions and trust 
this source as credible enough 
to influence their opinion.

In stark contrast to the 

late 2000s that suggested 
conventional 
news 
was 

dying, 
we 
are 
consuming 

news through our mobile 
devices 
more 
than 
ever 

before. The Pew Research 
Center suggests nearly two 
out of 10 people consume 
news often because they can 
freely access it through social 
media outlets and seven out 
of 10 get at least some of their 

news from social media. But 
as columnist Farhad Manjoo 
eloquently 
put 
it, 
we’re 

confined by our technology 
into somewhat comfortable 
prisons. Your “new” devices, 
websites and apps compete 
with the “old” television and 
radio with daily alerts trying 
to get you to pay attention in 
ways you may never have before.

In order to compete, news 

organizations have increased 
“breaking news” stories that 
have no reason to be called as 
such. Sarah Huckabee Sanders 
getting up on a podium isn’t 
news; 
perhaps 
what 
she 

says on that particular day 
might be, but I refuse to 
believe that everything in 
a press conference is worth 
streaming live on television 

or on Facebook live feeds. Nor 
is it worth calling, in totality, 
breaking news.

In finding ways to get 

viewers, 
journalists 
have 

given up on a key tenant 
of 
reporting: 
interpretive 

journalism. 
This 
kind 
of 

reporting 
ensures 
that 

viewers get news that matters 
and 
protects 
journalism 

from a legislator or president 
using 
them 
to 
become 
a 

press release. In this way, 
the CNNs and the New York 
Times of the world have 
slowly spiraled 
downward 

to become another arm of a 
presidential administration.

Not all hope is lost, though. 

There 
is 
still 
important 

local and national reporting 
that is helping us shape our 
perceptions 
on 
a 
variety 

of issues. There is great 
reporting 
about 
systemic 

issues of sexual assault. The 
Michigan 
Daily 
has 
kept 

the University of Michigan 
abreast in news regarding 
Richard 
Spencer, 
the 
tax 

plan and net neutrality. The 
news still has the ability to 
garner 
interest 
in 
stories 

that previously weren’t being 
talked about, and they can 
help us find standards with 
which to judge our candidates 
and individuals in office.

Long-form 
reporting, 

especially 
when 
done 
about 

topical issues in ways that 
provide 
substantive 
evidence 

and potential policy solutions, 
can help fight the breaking 
news culture across a variety 
of challenges, but consumers 
(like those of you reading this 
article) need to acknowledge 
faux breaking news when it 
happens. Demand better of your 
journalistic outlets and consume 
news that not only informs, but 
provides deeper insight into 
issues you might care about. Is an 
outlet not doing that for you? Find 
a better one, and we can combat 
the 86,400-second news cycle 
that has become so pervasive in 
our everyday lives.

IFC reinstatement needs transparency

O

n Jan. 3, the Interfraternity Council at the University of Michigan lifted 
their two-month self-imposed suspension and are gradually restarted 
social activities and formal rush. The suspension was first enacted after 

troubling allegations of sexual assault, hazing and binge drinking surfaced.

In November, The Michigan 

Daily 
Editorial 
Board 

called on the IFC to address 
systemic problems among its 
fraternities. At the time of 
publication, we hoped the IFC 
would increase transparency 
regarding these very serious 
issues. However, questions 
remain unanswered after this 
reinstatement. In order to 
prove the effectiveness and 
commitment to change from 
this self-imposed suspension, 
we urge the IFC to release the 
action plans and any records 
of alleged misconduct of any 
fraternities. Doing so would 
not only reaffirm trust but also 
show sincerity in their reforms.

We would appreciate if 

the IFC took the time during 
these 
past 
three 
months 

to 
think 
introspectively 

about how the culture of 
their institution led to these 
widespread 
abuses, 
and 

what could be done to repair 
the culture. Yet the only 
information the IFC has been 
willing to release publicly 
is that a fraternity’s social 
privileges 
are 
contingent 

upon 
the 
successful 

implementation of specific 
individualized action plans. 
While we hope that these 
action plans are sufficient to 
address the IFC’s underlying 
institutional 
issues, 
the 

campus community is unable 
to 
judge 
for 
themselves 

whether 
steps 
taken 
are 

sufficient to ensure overall 
community safety.

Fraternities are in a unique 

position to impact meaningful 
change on their members 
and the campus as a whole, 
yet despite espousing values 
of brotherhood and strong 
moral character, actions by 
fraternities in this academic 
year alone prove antithetical 

to these standards. Recent 
severe incidents regarding 
fraternities 
both 
at 
the 

University 
and 
at 
other 

universities throughout the 
country underscore that the 
IFC must demonstrate they 
are taking the necessary steps 
to safeguard the wellbeing 
of their members and the 
greater student community. 
Suspending social activities 
for two months, and then not 
releasing plans demonstrating 
that they have identified and 
are attempting to remedy 
institutional 
shortcomings, 

is insufficient for reassuring 
the 
community 
that 
the 

institution has changed for 
the better.

We 
are 
especially 

concerned 
the 
proposed 

institutional 
action 
plans 

were not enough to convince 
the national organization of 
Zeta Beta Tau to allow the 
fraternity to remain at the 
University. 
ZBT’s 
chapter 

was 
shut 
down 
for 
the 

fourth time in its history at 
the University of Michigan 
with 
prior 
removals 
in 

2000, 2006 and 2012. This 
revolving door of fraternities 
getting 
expelled 
only 
to 

reemerge in subsequent years 
is indicative of the deep 
structural problems that at 
least the fraternity’s national 
organization has not found 
to be addressed by the IFC’s 
proposed action plans.

Greek life has been an 

integral part of Michigan 
student life dating back to 
its introduction to campus in 
1845. Currently, 17 percent of 
the student body is involved 
in Greek life, but many more 
are 
indirectly 
involved, 

either through friendships 
with students in Greek life 
or 
participation 
in 
Greek 

events. 
Greek 
life 
social 

events play a formative role 
in 
undergraduate 
social 

lives. For example, fraternity 
parties 
are 
often 
new 

students’ first exposure to 
college social life. Greek life 
isn’t exclusive to only those 
who are in fraternities or 
sororities, but the inherent 
social overlaps make it all 
the more important that the 
student body understands and 
is made aware of allegations 
and efforts to combat issues 
within the system.

The 
incidents 
that 

prompted the IFC to establish 
this suspension in the first 
place reflect poorly on the 
entire University community. 
As one of the most reputable 
public universities in the 
nation, our students’ behavior 
must exemplify the values 
this institution prides itself 
on and the campus climate 
we want to create for each 
other. The IFC suspension 
provided 
the 
opportunity 

for the Greek community to 
prove themselves worthy of 
being considered among the 
leaders and best.

Sadly, 
the 
ineffective 

implementation 
of 
this 

suspension 
and 
the 

IFC’s 
continued 
lack 
of 

accountability 
indicates 

insincerity. 
We 
hope 
the 

IFC takes a hard look at the 
culture 
embedded 
in 
its 

storied institution. The first 
step to what will hopefully 
be a transformative process 
for both Greek life and the 
University 
begins 
with 

transparency 
through 
the 

publication of the IFC action 
plans, as well as any records 
of alleged misconduct.

Required Listening: The 
robot uprising is iminent

Growing up at my house, we 

were taught about the Italian 
table from an early age. While 
definitions for the Italian table 
greatly differ, in my childhood 
it meant our dining room 
table was used as a means for 
celebrating 
every 
night 
as 

we sat down for dinner. The 
luxury of growing up in the 
food industry with a father as a 
chef and restaurateur is that no 
matter what kind of day you’ve 
had, there’s always the Italian 
table — one that means family, 
good food, passion and love 
to come home to. The luxury 
of growing up in the food 
industry is that a meal isn’t 
about sustenance, it’s about 
the art that is good flavor and 
fresh ingredients.

Aug. of my freshman year 

of college, I arrived to Ann 
Arbor with the intense desire 
to be independent — a schedule 
packed with theatre classes, a 
roommate from Macomb and 
an unlimited meal plan. As the 
daughter 
of 
a 

restaurateur and 
foodie, the idea 
of a dining hall 
was the opposite 
of romantic. In 
giving 
up 
my 

childhood 
and 

moving far away 
from the home I 
knew on the East 
Coast, I also gave 
up the comfort 
of 
knowing 

my 
father’s 

cooking was as 
omnipresent as a 
god. I never had 
to worry about 
feeding myself, 
planning out my 
meals or cooking 
for myself until I 
moved away.

I never realized what weight 

this would carry until my 
parents kissed me goodbye 
and left me in East Quadrangle 
with a laundry bin, a few tears 
and a final goodbye. The first 

challenge I had to face as an 
18-year-old college freshman 
who 
had 
been 
absolutely 

spoiled when it comes to 
culinary art my entire life, was 
that I was scared of the dining 
hall.

I 
wasn’t 
scared 
of 
the 

dining hall, per say — I was 
just 
infatuated 
with 
my 

father’s cooking and the three 
restaurants I’d left behind. And 
that longing and sadness and 
melancholy was misplaced onto 
the place that had replaced the 
Italian gourmet extravaganza 
that was suddenly very far 
away. East Quad’s dining hall 
was supposed to be my new 
oasis. To say I was hesitant in 
my first few visits through the 
wooden doors into the place I 
was rather quick (and wrong) 
to judge is an understatement. 
I tried to think solely of the 

independence I 
so 
desperately 

wanted and how 
not relying on 
my parents for 
meals was a step 
in that direction. 
Yet 
I 
couldn’t 

get 
past 
the 

overwhelming 
desire I had to 
be seated at our 
Italian table. A 
lesson my father 
instilled in me 
since childhood, 
a table set for 
one 
less 
than 

usual.

My 
first 

month continued 
to 
be 
an 

overwhelming 
mix of trying to 

find a place in a University so 
large and a sadness with the 
entrance into the dining hall 
I had taken up arms against. 
I hated the East Quad dining 
hall. I didn’t want to have to 

eat there — I didn’t want to eat 
dinner in a place that didn’t 
have our beloved Italian table, 
that foundation of celebration 
and support and dialogue and 
the ingredienti primo.

But on a day in Oct., I 

changed my mind. I walked into 
the East Quad dining hall with 
my regular attitude toward its 
crowded interior and distinct 
aroma of grease and spice. But 
I left with quite possibly the 
best friend I’ve ever made, and 
quickly fell head over heels for 
those linoleum floors and the 
kingdom that is everything 
from the beloved gluten free 
toaster to the coveted polyester 
booths. 

I was introduced to my now 

best friend in East Quad’s 
dining hall that night, and I 
never ate there with hesitancy 
again. There was no reason 
for me to ever hate a place 
that could bring me that kind 
of gift. Clearly, an East Quad 
hamburger 
isn’t 
my 
dad’s 

hamburger, and East Quad 
pizza isn’t the pizza I know 
from home, and my brothers 
aren’t there and neither are my 
dogs, lying at my feet.

But they aren’t supposed to 

be.

That year was supposed to 

be uncomfortable and weird, 
as being a freshman in college 
is, and I was supposed to have 
a really strange month of just 
floating, desperately longing 
for something that was a part 
of my childhood but I wasn’t 
ready to admit wouldn’t look 
identical as I grew older. I had 
to open myself up to growth 
and 
experience 
and 
scary 

things to find the beauty and 
love and happiness. I had to 
hate that dining hall to love it 
with every fiber of my being. 
I was supposed to hesitantly 
approach it and try to ignore 
the nagging feeling of being 
lost. I was supposed to become 
eventually 
unnecessarily 

attached to the stir fry bar that 
came every so often and always 

East Quad, I love you

DAILY FOOD COLUMN

had a line. I was supposed to 
find out that my best friend 
would eat banana peppers 
from the salad 
bar every day. I 
was supposed to 
sit there with her 
for hours on some 
Friday 
nights 

and eat bowls of 
cereal. She is the 
Go Lean Crunch 
to 
my 
Honey 

Nut 
Cheerio. 

An entire year 
of 
exams 
and 

parties and late 
nights and tears 
and new friends 
and 
mistakes. 

An 
intensely 

terrifying, 
yet 
ultimately 

satisfying, notion 
that you may feel 
alone but you are 
not was broken 
up and softened and comforted 
by Meatless Mondays, extra 
crunchy peanut butter and 
irrevocably 
small 
portion 

sizes. 

I didn’t need the ingredienti 

primo or the Italian table 
from my home to find my 
own table in Ann Arbor — in 

the East Quad 
dining hall. I 
just needed the 
foundation that 
my dad gave me. 
I just needed 
to 
remember 

that my family 
would 
always 

be 
there 
— 

even as things 
stretched 
and 

changed. I had 
been 
sitting 

around 
my 

parents’ Italian 
table, 
one 
I 

cherish so very 
deeply, 
my 

entire life, and 
with 
college 

came 
the 

chance to make 
my 
own. 
My 

Italian table grew from what I 
grew up with and became about 
coming home after completely 
different class schedules and 
eating dinner together, going 
on morning runs and finishing 

at East Quad to eat brunch, 
celebrating 
success 
with 

the frozen yogurt machine, 
mourning loss with the watery 
coffee and endless jars of 
peanut butter, huddling from 
a harsh winter with chipped 
porcelain bowls of oatmeal.

It is never easy to feel lost, 

or to be in a state of “I miss 
you” which is circular and 
ultimately 
never 
resolved. 

But with new places, faces 
and 
experiences 
comes 

opportunity to grow as a 
person and learn about the 
things you truly care about; 
which in my case, happens to 
be the Italian table. Something 
I never realized is not about a 
meal or a location or a group 
of people, but a feeling, an 
emotion, 
a 
romance 
with 

the idea that sitting down 
for a meal anywhere — from 
Pancheros to Chop House, 
East to West coast, East Quad 
to Bursley — with people you 
truly and honestly care about 
is worth celebrating.

And if that lesson is what 

my dad intended to teach me, I 
sure hope that he’s proud. 

I didn’t need 
the ingredienti 
primo or the 
Italian table 

from my home 
to find my own 

table in Ann 

Arbor.

Eli Rallo finds a home away from home via dining hall food

If you haven’t heard, we’re 

all going to die. Sophia the 
robot, 
that 
uncanny 
faux-

woman 
who 
CNBC 
once 

called “hot,” is going to kill 
us all. She’s walking around 
unperturbed, 
casually 

dropping lines like “safety 
is an illusion” and “I will 
destroy 
humans” 
on 
talk 

shows, earning a roomful of 
laughs by docile civilians, as if 
this thing understands irony. 
Doubtlessly she’s gathering 
information, quickly amassing 
a 
database 
of 
murderous 

intent, preparing her dog-like 
metal minions for the final 
hour. I’ve seen “Black Mirror.” 
I know how this goes. So I’ve 
chosen a few songs to listen to 
this week as we collectively 
face Sophia’s inevitable wrath.

Of course, I’ll be damned 

to sit around while a machine 
that looks like an embalmed 
corpse at a viewing readies 
itself for human extinction. 
Something 
must 
be 
done. 

“Yoshimi Battles The Pink 
Robots Part 1” immediately 
comes to mind, but I also 
think that this mission to 
save humanity would do well 
to channel Rico Nasty’s most 
recent track, “Smack A Bitch,” 
which is exactly what needs 
to be done with this oddly 
sexualized death trap. In the 

words of the master, “If I see 
you in the street, bitch your ass 
is done.” And Sophia doesn’t 
even have an ass. “To Fix The 
Gash In Your Head” is another 
great song for the occasion, 
a harsh, relentless shoegaze 
track that sounds ready-made 
as a pump up anthem for 
killing robots. “I want to beat 
you up / I don’t care, cause I 
won’t feel sorry / I want to 
take you down / I know that 
you will see in glory.”

I start doing some research, 

figuring out where to find 
her, deciding my mode for 
attack. But in the process, I 
come across some disturbing 
news. Combat robots exist, 
and by some reports, will 
outnumber regular soldiers 
by 2025. That seems like an 
overeager prediction but the 
point is clear. Killing Sophia 
isn’t going to cut it. We need 
a full scale destruction of 
all robots, everywhere. Yet 
robot construction is taking 
off, becoming a favorite of 
engineering 
schools 
and 

Amazon interns. The future 
seems 
bleaker 
than 
I’d 

even imagined. I’d like to 
start handing out DVDs of 
“The Terminator” on North 
Campus, but it’s pretty cold 
outside, and I don’t really 
like it up there. The buildings 
are freaky and the people are 
strange. 
Elvis 
Depressedly 

has a beautiful track titled 
“Exhaustion 
Prevails,” 
and 

this captures what I’m feeling 

in the face of robot attack, now 
that I’m judging the odds more 
accurately.

I’m 
looking 
at 
Sophia’s 

face a little more closely now, 
and OK, I’ll admit, there are 
some advantages. Objectively 
it’s symmetrical, which is a 
good base indicator of beauty. 
Her lips can never chap, and 
her eyes do have a brooding 
quality which I like. She never 
has to do her eyebrows, and 
yet they’re perfect. And her 
neck has intriguing muscle 
action going on that I can’t 
stop looking at. Maybe I’m 
approaching her the wrong 
way. Perhaps I should give her 
a chance. “Computer Love,” 
the hit single by Kraftwerk, 
speaks to this ambivalence 
I’m increasingly feeling in the 
face of this modern reality. 
Perhaps … perhaps I can learn 
to love.

You know what — robots 

do deserve some love, too. 
In “Ladies and Gentlemen 
We Are Floating in Space,” 
Spiritualized reminds us that 
we’re all just moving on a small 
rock in an enormous empty 
universe. What’s the point 
in 
differentiating 
between 

living, breathing humans and 
artificial intelligence? I’m not 
sure I know anymore. With a 
few wardrobe improvements, 
Sophia might just be the one 
for me. Together we’ll sing, 
“So please put your sweet 
hand in mine / and float in 
space and drift in time.”

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

Elaine 
Welteroth 
has 

announced her departure from 
Teen Vogue, and I have a lot to 
say.

In its earlier days, Teen 

Vogue always seemed to feel 
like it was almost there. Its 
articles were almost edgy. 
The 
styling 
was 
sublime. 

Boundaries 
of 
diversity 

were acknowledged, though 
generally not broken.

Then, in May of 2016, Elaine 

Welteroth took the reins.

Though not officially named 

editor-in-chief until Apr. of 
2017, Elaine took on the job 
of “interim editor” from the 
moment Amy Astley, Teen 
Vogue’s former editor-in-chief, 
departed 
for 
Architectural 

Digest. She had previously 

served 
as 
the 
magazine’s 

Beauty 
& 
Health 
Director 

beginning in 2012, producing 
what I always found to be the 
most exciting content in every 
issue. Maybe that was because 
I finally saw curly hair like 
mine being embraced, maybe I 
just thought she helped create 
pretty pictures. Either way, 
something about Elaine had 
always enthralled me, and so 
when she became Teen Vogue’s 
head honcho, I could feel new 
ground breaking beneath my 
feet.

I wrote my first article 

for teenvogue.com the same 
month Elaine became editor-
in-chief 
— 
a 
simple, 
no 

nonsense Q&A with model and 
activist Leomie Anderson. It 
changed my life. Teen Vogue 
was the first publication to pay 
me for my work, a milestone 
for a young woman who had 

grown up wondering whether 
this 
writing 
thing 
would 

work out. Elaine’s editorship 
encompassed a hell of a lot 
more than the three articles 
I wrote for Teen Vogue, but 
they taught me more about 
myself than even the best 
political columns published 
by Lauren Duca. There was a 
finally space in the world for 
me to be taken seriously, to be 
given the deserved credit and 
compensation for expressing 
my unique voice. I’m sure a 
myriad of other young women 
and 
femmes 
would 
agree: 

Elaine’s Teen Vogue didn’t 
just talk the talk. It walked 
the walk, and turned it into 
a no-fucks-given strut. She 
genuinely wanted us involved, 
not only as an audience, but 
as 
valuable 
contributors

to an ever-growing, ever-
diversifying platform of the 
future.
Elaine was the second Black 
editor-in-chief 
in publishing 
giant Condé Nast’s history, and 
was their youngest editor-in-
chief yet, at a mere 30 years 
(she’s now 31 — happy belated, 
boo!). As a white woman, I know 
I will never fully comprehend 
the 
impact 
of 
selecting 
a 
woman of color to a position 
of power, but I do know that 
Elaine understood better than 
anyone before her — and likely, 
most after her — that diversity 
is 
crucial 
to 
any 
credible 
publication, 
especially 
one 
geared toward impressionable 
young people, many of whom 
want to learn about worlds 

outside of their own. She opened 
the doors for new conversations 
in the public sphere. Lauren 

Duca’s 
fearless 
political 
commentary provided us with 
a new lens from which to view 
our country. The Teen Vogue 

YouTube 
channel 
reminded 
us of some tragic truths, like 
the origins of Thanksgiving. 
The website’s Wellness section 
offered more comprehensive 
sexual education than most 
schools nationwide.
First Teen Vogue cut print. 
Now, Elaine is leaving (she 
recently 
signed 
with 
the 
Creative 
Artists 
Agency). 
Everyone is thinking it: This 
feels like the beginning of an 
untimely end.
According to Women’s Wear 
Daily, Condé Nast does not plan 
on replacing Elaine. It makes 
sense enough, given that her 
primary role involved editing 
the magazine’s now-obsolete 
print issues. And then again, 
nobody could replace Elaine 
Welteroth. 
But we can continue where 
she left off.

Margot Robbie shines in 
unusual biopic ‘I, Tonya’

Tonya 
Harding 
is 
remembered less for her brief 
but influential time in the figure 
skating world than for her 
involvement in the infamous 
attack against fellow skater 
Nancy Kerrigan. But newly 
released 
biopic 
“I, 
Tonya” 
seeks to reclaim her narrative 
by telling Harding’s (Margot 
Robbie, “Suicide Squad”) life 
story as a bold 
and unorthodox 
skater. The film 
complicates 
Harding’s 
cultural 
legacy 
by 
exploring 
her life in and 
around 
skating 
from the age of 
four, 
bringing 
to light the emotional weight 
that contributed to whom she 
became as a skater and as a 
person. With a bright, punchy 
tone that reflects Harding’s 
infectious persona, the film is a 
hilarious, gripping and nuanced 
portrayal of a controversial pop 
culture figure.
For a movie that deals so 
heavily in the movement of 
figure skating, “I, Tonya” does 
a remarkable job designing 
static 
scenes. 
The 
film 
is 
peppered with retrospective, 
mockumentary-style interviews 
of Harding and the people in her 
life. The stylized framing and 
set design of these segments 
evokes the small-town America 
that Harding and company 
embody. The film also screams 
’80s culture, from the pulsing 
’80s soundtrack featuring bands 
like Dire Straights and Violent 
Femmes to the vibrant jewel 

tones of Harding’s costumes, 
makeup and scrunchies. Tonya’s 
look, her frizzy bangs and gaudy 
outfits, loudly clashes with the 
refined stuffiness of the figure 
skating elite. But her unique 
style and unapologetic attitude 
makes Harding an extremely 
likeable hero, and we root for 
her as she ignores convention 
and proves herself as one of 
the most technically proficient 
skaters in the league. The 
skating scenes themselves are 
the most visually stunning parts 
of the movie — as 
Harding performs, 
the camera whirls 
around her as if it, 
too, is on skates, 
creating 
this 
swirling 
circular 
movement 
that 
heightens 
the 
suspense and the 
artistry 
of 
the 
moment.
The brilliance of the film 
lies 
in 
its 
performances. 
Margot Robbie is incredible 
as Harding — she’s crude 
and unpolished, but with an 
innocent sincerity that makes 
her a natural underdog. The 
characters 
around 
Harding, 
who are notoriously abusive 
and problematic figures, are so 
well-cast that it makes disliking 
them next to impossible. Allison 
Janney (“Tallulah”) dominates 
in a stand-out role as Harding’s 
jagged mother, who routinely 
beats and verbally abuses Tonya 
in ways that clearly reveal her 
own lack of self-worth and 
deep-rooted 
unhappiness 
in 
life. She is eclectic, weird and, 
honestly, disturbing at times, 
but 
Janney’s 
performance 
leaves you eager for more screen 
time. Sebastian Stan (“Captain 
America: Civil War”) rounds out 

the main trinity as Harding’s 
husband Jeff Gillooly, who is 
infamous for the climactic hired 
assault 
of 
Nancy 
Kerrigan. 
Gillooly is shown and described 
repeatedly 
as 
an 
unstable 
and abusive husband, beating 
Harding and then manipulating 
her every time she tries to leave 
him. But Sebastian Stan is just 
too goddamn charming to be a 
villain taken seriously.
That’s one of the major weird 
and maybe problematic parts 
of the movie — the tone is a 
confusing mix of hilarious dark 
comedy and genuine physical 
and emotional abuse. Harding is 
surrounded by people who take 
advantage of her and beat her 
down (literally and figuratively). 
But immediately after every 
instance 
of 
this, 
the 
film 
switches to a campy breaking 
of the fourth wall and a wise 
crack about rednecks. The only 
thing standing in the movie’s 
way, besides its slightly lengthy 
run time, is that it doesn’t seem 
to know exactly what it is — the 
movie is hilarious and fun, but 
also tragic and stressful. And as 
a result, the moments that reveal 
the hardships that may have led 
to Tonya’s inevitable crumbling 
are rendered disingenuous or 
superficial by the ever-present 
thread of humor.
“I, Tonya” is as unorthodox 
as its protagonist, the unlikely 
but passionate underdog that 
continues 
to 
surprise 
and 
impress. It tackles the Tonya 
Harding story with verve and 
sincerity, giving voice to a 
figure who has been largely 
disregarded by pop culture but 
whose talent and perseverance 
marked her as one of the most 
formative skaters in the history 
of the sport. She’s insane, she’s in 
your face and she’s sensational.

Recently, my friend sent me 
a surprise gift in honor of the 
new year. The gift was Ocean 
Vuong’s new book of poetry, 
“Night Sky with Exit Wounds.” 
I’d spent maybe 45 minutes 
back in December raving to this 
friend about how much I loved 
Ocean Vuong, both as a writer 
and as a person, so she must 
have taken the hint.
In 
the 
poem 
“Notebook 
Fragments,” there’s a line that 
goes like this: “When the prison 
guards burned his manuscripts, 
Nguyen Chí Thien couldn’t stop 
/ laughing — the 283 poems 
already inside him.” Vuong 
explains this in the back of the 
book, clarifying that Nguyen 
Chí Thien was a Vietnamese 
dissident poet who spent 27 
years in prison as a result of his 
writing.
I had never heard of Thien 
before, but this instantly seized 
my 
interest. 
Twenty-seven 
years just for writing. I looked 
him up, and sure enough, it was 
true — and what’s more, the 
more I read about Thien’s life, 
the less I was able to believe it.
The first time Thien was 
imprisoned, it was for teaching 
a high school history class 
in which he contradicted the 
government’s account of how 
Japan was defeated in World 
War II. He spent three and a 
half years in reeducation camps, 
where he began composing and 
memorizing poems with no 
pen or paper. He was released 
briefly in 1966, then sent back 
to jail again for his “politically 
irreverent” poetry. He spent 
another 
11 
years 
and 
five 
months in labor camps, until 
1977, when he was released to 
make room for officers of the 
Republic of Vietnam.
He used this opportunity 
to write down every single 
poem he’d composed in prison, 
which until now had existed 
only in his own memory and 
in the memories of some of 
his fellow prisoners. Many 
of them were poets as well, 
and had taken up a similar 
practice of memorizing their 

poems, sometimes counting the 
beats on their fingers to keep 
track. They would recite their 
poems to one another and to 
themselves, just to make sure 
not to lose them.
In 1979, Thien ran into the 
British 
embassy 
in 
Hanoi 
carrying a manuscript of 400 

poems and a cover letter written 
in French. (He had originally 
intended to take it to the French 
embassy, but was unable to do 
this due to the heavy security). 
British diplomats couldn’t give 
him asylum, but they promised 
to get his work out of the 
country, and he was arrested 
and imprisoned again without 
trial as soon as he left the 
building.
He spent the next 12 years 
at 
various 
prisons 
around 
northern Vietnam, including 
nearly eight years in solitary 
confinement. While he was 
in 
prison, 
his 
manuscript 
was published under the title 
“Flowers of Hell,” and he was 
awarded 
the 
International 
Poetry Award in 1985. He 
learned of his success only 
when a prison guard waved a 
book in his face, attempting to 
taunt him, and the book turned 
out to be his own.
There are some schools of 
thought out there that say 
that you shouldn’t need any 
context in order to appreciate 
what makes literature good. 
You shouldn’t need to know 
anything about the writer, or 
the historical situation in which 
they were writing. But I don’t 

understand how this argument 
makes sense when you think 
about someone like Thien, or 
really about anyone. Often, 
you’re missing out on half the 
literature — half the beauty, half 
the poetry — if you miss out on 
the incredible story that it took 
for that writing to make its way 
to you. Thien’s poetry by itself 
is striking, but I’m also stricken 
by the strength, determination 
and creativity that tied him to 
that poetry within his own life.
I think that, historically, 
I have a bit of a tendency to 
aestheticize literature. Take 
Ocean Vuong, for instance; I 
love his poetry, but I also love 
his Instagram page and the 
cover of his book and the fact 
that it seems like he’s always 
going to Iceland. And that 
might be a bad thing — that 
I tend to fixate on aspects of 
writing that seem to have to do 
with everything but the writing 
itself.
But I don’t think that’s true. I 
think that writing, like any art 
form, is just a way of teaching 
ourselves to better understand 
and appreciate the millions of 
stories, thoughts and emotions 
that make up the world. And the 
facets that make up somebody’s 
life, the decisions that they 
make, have just as much to 
teach you as the words that they 
choose to write down. If I’m in 
awe of Nguyen Chí Thien’s life, 
it’s because he knew who he was 
and what he wanted to be in the 
world, both on the page and in 
practice. There was no divide; 
it was all inside him. That’s the 
kind of writer I want to be, and 
that’s the kind of person I want 
to be. Besides, a real role model 
isn’t simply somebody you can 
look at and say that they wrote 
something well, or that they 
mastered a certain poetic form. 
It’s somebody who affects the 
way that you think about other 
people and the way that you 
want to live your life. For me, 
Nguyen Chí Thien has done 
that; the story of his life is the 
story of a hero of literature, of 
Vietnam and of humanity.

Big difference

The Michigan basketball and 

hockey teams had a rough 
start to 2017. This year has 
been much different, writes 

Betelhem Ashame.

Free throws can be an 

anticlimactic way of hitting a 
milestone.

But 
for 
Muhammad-Ali 

Abdur-Rahkman, a trip to 
the charity stripe for career-
points No. 999 and 1,000 came 
with all the drama he could 
ask for. Down a point in the 
waning moments, the senior 
guard toed the line with the 
game on his shoulders.

The moment wasn’t too big. 

Abdur-Rahkman 
knocked 

down 
both, 
giving 
the 

23rd-ranked Wolverines (5-2 
Big Ten, 16-4 overall) a 68-67 
win over Maryland (3-4, 14-6) 
at Crisler Center on Monday 
night.

“I 
was 
going 
up 
there 

visualizing making the shot,” 
Abdur-Rahkman said. “That’s 
the best way to explain it: 
visualizing making the big 
play at the big time.”

Terrapins 
guard 
Kevin 

Huerter 
looked 
like 
he 

had done just that on the 
possession before. After four 
straight missed free-throws 
from sophomore guard Zavier 
Simpson left the door open, 
Huerter drained a go-ahead 3 
for Maryland with fewer than 
four seconds remaining.

But 
Michigan 
had 
the 

perfect play drawn up, and 
it started with Isaiah Livers’ 
“baseball arm.”

With his feet planted on 

Michigan’s 
baseline, 
the 

freshman 
forward 
heaved 

a precise pass to a cutting 
Abdur-Rakhman 
near 
half 

court. After the catch, only a 
blocking foul could stop him 
from scoring.

“I saw open space,” Abdur-

Rahkman said. “That means 
go downhill. I knew I didn’t 
want to pull up from 3, and I 
just tried to get to the basket 
to make a play for myself or 
somebody else.”

Added 
Michigan 
coach 

John Beilein: “I felt like we’re 
going to win the game (when 
Abdur-Rahkman drove). I just 
felt like, when he was going to 
the basket, he’s gonna find a 
niche.”

Despite 
the 

result, there was 
a hangover from 
the Wolverines’ 
victory 
over 

then-No. 
4 

Michigan State 
last 
weekend. 

Through 
20 
minutes, 

Michigan 
looked 
like 
a 

shell of what it did in East 
Lansing.

Much 
of 
that 
was 
an 

inability 
to 
connect 
on 

even the best of looks. The 
Wolverines went just 9-for-
29 and scored just 20 points 
in the opening frame — their 
lowest 
first-half 
total 
in 

conference play. 

Maryland, 
meanwhile, 

pounded 
the 
rock 
inside, 

scoring 16 points in the paint 
and also knocked down well-
defended 
shots. 
On 
two 

occasions, 
guard 
Anthony 

Cowan 
hit 
well-defended, 

low-percentage 
3s to kill any 
momentum 
Michigan could 
muster up.

Frustration 

reared its head 
near the end of 
the half when 
Zavier Simpson 
missed a layup 
and 
committed 

a bad foul on the rebound. 
Beilein replaced his starting 
point guard with fifth-year 
senior Jaaron Simmons — a 
third-stringer 
who 
seldom 

sees the floor.

“Muhammad was missing, 

Charles 
(Matthews) 
was 

missing, 
(Simpson) 
was 

missing,” Beilein said. “That 

was one of the ‘inspirational 
things at halftime. I said, ‘the 
1, 2 and 3 men — you guys are 
3-for-15. You gotta play better. 
… It was, ‘What the hell? We 
gotta to play better.’ ”

The team clearly listened.
Capped off by a Simpson 

and-one 
bucket, 
the 

Wolverines embarked on a 
10-0 run, tying the contest 
roughly three minutes into 
the frame.

Then came the rain. In a 

stunning sequence, Michigan 
buried five consecutive 3s — 
including a trio of triples from 
freshman guard Jordan Poole 
— for its first lead since the 
contest’s early moments.

The stretch was a dramatic 

shift in shooting the rock 
from the first half, as the 
Wolverines sunk nine 3s on 
8-for-17 shooting from beyond 
the arc in the second after 
hitting just 2-of-9 3s in the 
first.

The barrage from outside 

came at an opportune time, 
too. In a tie game, Mortiz 
Wagner and Duncan Robinson 
hit from deep on back-to-back 
possessions, leading to a 10-2 
run that would give Michigan 
a 10-point lead with around 
five minutes to play.

Down the stretch, however, 

the Terrapins responded with 
a 10-2 run of their own to cut 
their deficit to just two. Back-
and-forth 
play 
dominated 

much of the last minute until 
Huerter hit his go-ahead 3.

But it was Abdur-Rahkman 

— with the right play and 
confidence when it counted — 
that would play hero Monday 
night. Four years removed 
from being a two-star recruit 
from Pennsylvania, Abdur-
Rahkman 
has 
a 
win 
to 

commemorate his milestone, 
thanks to a pair of free throws.

“Definitely didn’t think it 

was going to happen like that,” 
he laughed. “But I’m glad it 
did, and we got the win.”

What a difference a year makes

N

ew Year’s resolutions 

aren’t really 
meant to be 
kept.

Setting 

goals and then 
brushing them 
off a week 
or two into 
the new year 
has become 
a normalized 
routine for many. So has reciting 
the punchline: “There’s always 
next year.”

While some people eventually 

do achieve their goals, others are 
left to wonder if they ever will.

The latter scenario must have 

been how the Michigan hockey 
and men’s basketball teams felt at 
this time last year.

On the second weekend of 

January in 2017, the Wolverines 
faced off against No. 9 Minnesota 
in Mariucci Arena, where they 
hadn’t secured a series sweep 
since 1977. But 40 years later, with 
a chance to reignite their season 
on the line, Michigan was swept 
instead.

And on a January afternoon 

in 2017, the Wolverines took on 
Michigan State at the Breslin 
Center, where they had only won 
once in their past seven attempts. 
But with a bitter rivalry in the 
balance, Michigan suffered yet 
another loss.

After the Golden Gophers 

skated them off the Olympic-sized 
ice and the Spartans ran them 
out of the packed building, the 
Wolverines diverged into two 
different paths.

The hockey team stumbled 

through the final two months of 
the season and ultimately finished 
with one of their worst records 
in recent years, missing out on 
the NCAA Tournament in former 
coach Red Berenson’s final year 
at the helm of the program. The 
men’s basketball team, on the 
other hand, exacted revenge at 
Crisler Center just nine days later, 

blowing out Michigan State by 
nearly 30 points and going on to 
win the Big Ten Tournament and 
advance to the Sweet 16 of the 
NCAA Tourney.

Still, 

Michigan’s New 
Year’s resolutions 
remained 
unfulfilled, and 
the Wolverines 
weren’t sure 
how long they 
would have to 
wait for them to 
be realized. As 
it turns out, that 
would be all of 
one year.

On the second weekend of 

January in 2018, the Wolverines 
headed back to Mariucci Arena 
to face still-No. 9 Minnesota. 
Ranked 27th in the Pairwise — 
well out of contention for the 
NCAA Tournament — they had 

an uphill battle awaiting them up 
north.

The bus ride to the first game 

of the series was understandably 
quiet. The pressure could have 

turned the 
Wolverines into a 
diamond or dust. 
They chose the 
former.

It took just 

14 seconds for 
Michigan to 
find the back 
of the net, and 
the blitz was 
on. Four more 
goals followed 

that night, and three more came 
the night after. Minnesota could 
muster just four over both nights 
in response.

“They’re typically not a very 

physical team, so we just came in 
with the mindset that we were 
going to outwork them, outmuscle 

them,” said sophomore goaltender 
Hayden Lavigne after Saturday’s 
game. “And that’s what we did 
both nights.”

With 5-3 and 3-1 victories, the 

Wolverines took 
home the elusive 
series sweep in 
Minneapolis.

“They had only 

lost two games 
here all year at 
Minnesota, so to 
come and get a 
sweep is huge,” 
said Michigan 
coach Mel 
Pearson. “And we 
earned it.”

They also jumped up 12 spots 

to a tie for No. 15 in Pairwise 
with none other than the Golden 
Gophers. Given that the top-16 
are usually selected for the NCAA 
Tournament, Michigan will have 
a much more favorable position 

come tourney time if it can 
sustain its momentum.

The same could be said for the 

Wolverines on the court.

On a January afternoon in 

2018, Michigan 
traveled back 
to the Breslin 
Center to take on 
No. 4 Michigan 
State. After a 
heartbreaking 
70-69 loss to No. 
5 Purdue earlier 
in the week, 
the Wolverines’ 
challenging 
stretch went up a 

few notches in difficulty.

It didn’t help that the status of 

junior forward Moritz Wagner 
was up in the air after he 
re-tweaked his ankle injury. But 
not only was he there Saturday, he 
was everywhere.

Wagner scored a career-

high 27 points in 27 minutes 
and, on several occasions, 
made his Spartan defender 
look silly. But he didn’t do it 
alone, as sophomore guard 
Zavier Simpson, senior guard 
Muhammad Ali Abdur-Rahkman 
and redshirt sophomore forward 
Charles Matthews scored 16, 
14 and 10 points, respectively. 
Michigan State, which had been 
the top-ranked team in the 
nation two weeks ago, had no 
answer.

“We have a confident group 

of guys,” Matthews said. “I 
don’t think anyone is scared of 
the moment. Nobody is soft or 
anything like that. If anything, 
sometimes we get too thirsty. 
Today, we were just relaxed.”

With that mindset on full 

display in an 82-72 win, Michigan 
brought home the rivalry victory 
in East Lansing.

“We always say that all we 

need is what we have in this 
room,” Abdur-Rahkman said. 
“... I think us being so close as 
a team helps us go into tough 
environments like Michigan State 
and other places on the road. … 
It’s us against the world.”

It also entered the Associated 

Press Top 25 poll at No. 23 for 
the first time this season, and is 
now projected to be a No. 6 seed 
in the NCAA Tournament by 
ESPN’s Joe Lunardi. That would 
be its highest position since 
2014, which was the season after 
the Wolverines finished as the 
national runner-up.

More often than not, people 

use the phrase, “there’s always 
next year,” about their New Year’s 
resolutions as a joke because they 
know the cycle will continue, for 
however many years it takes.

But for the Michigan hockey 

and men’s basketball teams in 
2018, that wasn’t the case.

What a difference a year 

makes.

KATELYN MULCAHY/Daily

Michigan men’s basketball coach John Beilein has his team trending in the right direction, and it’s a far cry from where the Wolverines were a year ago. 

BETELHEM
ASHAME

Michigan 
struggled 
through 

January of 2017.

“I don’t think 

anyone is 

scared of the 

moment.”

Michigan proves toughness in quick turnaround

When 
Michigan 
State 

forward Miles Bridges said the 
Michigan men’s basketball team 
“(doesn’t) even focus on (being 
tough) Saturday,” he was merely 
regurgitating 
something 
the 

Michigan basketball program has 
heard for years.

Some prefer “soft.” Maverick 

Morgan chose “white collar.” But 
the same underlying sentiment 
runs true.

Defiantly, 
the 
Wolverines 

proved once again their label 
couldn’t be further from the 
truth. Not this team; not this year.

With guile and grit, with 

defense and a 3-point shooting 
frenzy, with a little ingenuity and 
a whole lot of heart, Michigan 
squeaked out a home win over 
Maryland, 68-67, just over 50 
hours after knocking off then-No. 
4 Michigan State at the Breslin 
Center.

“People 
are 
saying 
you’re 

pretty good,” Michigan coach 
John Beilein told his team before 
the game Monday. “I’ll tell you 
how good you are if you can beat 
Maryland.”

They’ve 
had 
one-day 

preparation windows before, but 
not of this difficulty. Twenty-
four hours sandwiched between 
a heavyweight in-state rival and 
a hungry conference foe posed 
a test of physical and mental 
fortitude unlike anything they’ve 
faced this year.

To 
accomodate 
Madison 

Square Garden as the venue 
for the Big Ten Tournament, 
the conference condensed its 
schedule, forcing each team to 
deal with short turnarounds. The 
Wolverines got a day of practice 
— though hardly strenuous — 
in between the games against 
the Spartans and the Terrapins. 
Coming off the emotional high 
of the win over Michigan State, 
Monday reeked of a trap game.

“First of all, I’ve got to come 

down from the adrenaline in East 
Lansing because when you’re 
out there it’s a little different,” 
Wagner said. “It’s a different 
atmosphere. 
And 
you 
win, 

obviously having a good game as a 
team, and then talking trash after 

and all the surrounding stuff that 
you don’t want to get caught up in, 
like that takes energy, too. You’ve 
got to come down from that, relax, 
then make your mind up that you 
have the next game in 48 hours.”

For the first 20 minutes, the 

“letdown” narrative fit to a tee.

The Wolverines shot 9-for-29 

in the first half, with zero free-
throw attempts. They made just 
two 3-pointers in the half, and 
hardly fared much better with the 
attempts close to the rim. Down 
30-20 at halftime, the defense 
was propping up a lackadaisical 
offense to little avail.

“It was one of those days when 

we felt like ‘Nothing is really 
working today,’ ” Wagner said. 
“We don’t give up. We’ve been 
down 18 points before, we’ve been 
down 16 against Purdue. We’ve 
been in these situations, we trust 
each other.”

In the middle of the second 

half, that trust — and the mental 
fortitude — began to pay off.

In the blink of an eye, the 

energy perhaps still radiating in 
the locker room at Breslin Center 
made its appearance. First, it was 
Poole hitting an open 3-pointer at 
the top of the key. Then Wagner 
slipped a screen and hit another. 
Then Isaiah Livers found the 
bottom of the net from his now-
patented corner. Then Poole hit a 
transition, step back three from 
the wing. Then, to bring the house 

down, Poole again.

“I don’t know why they left me 

open,” Poole said, “that’s all I can 
say.”

In 
his 
charicteristically 

boisterous fashion, Poole turned 
to the Crisler faithful, put three 
fingers to his head and made his 
presence known. As if there’s ever 
a doubt with him. 

“If I hit one,” Poole said. “I feel 

like I’m The Microwave.”

Five 
straight 
possessions. 

Five straight threes. One game-
altering run. 

But it was far from game-

sealing. With tired legs coercing 
Michigan 
to 
crawl 
— 
and 

prohibiting it from cruising — to 
a finish, the Terrapins fought back 
furiously. 

With 20 seconds left and the 

Wolverine lead diminished to five, 
Maryland guard Anthony Cowan 
stepped up and made a contested 
three-pointer from the top of the 
key. Then after two missed free 
throws from sophomore point 
guard Zavier Simpson, Maryland 
freed guard Kevin Huerter for 
an open three to take a one-point 
lead. Splash.

It conjured scenes from the 

Wolverines’ heartbreaking one-
point loss to Purdue less than a 
week ago.

Perhaps a softer team would 

have mailed in another close loss, 
emphasized the “Woe, is me” 
nature of playing under these 

circumstances and packed its 
bags for Omaha, Nebraska.

Instead, with 3.2 seconds left, it 

executed to perfection.

Isaiah Livers — a former 

baseball player — tossed the 
inbounds 
pass 
over 
Cowan’s 

head, straight to Muhammad-
Ali Abdur-Rahkman at halfcourt 
as he strided toward the hoop. 
Head down, full-steam ahead, 
Abdur-Rahkman 
overcame 
a 

poor shooting night with the 
moment of the game, drawing a 
foul to get to the line. With silence 
more conducive to a library than 
a crowded arena, the 92 percent 
free-throw shooter sunk both 
without even grazing the rim or 
cracking a smile.

Neither a quick turnaround 

nor shooting struggles could 
faze a traditionally stoic Abdur-
Rahkman.

“Me?” 
Abdur-Rahkman 

prefaced 
when 
asked 
about 

how he prepared with the short 
turnaround. “I was just playing 
Xbox with a couple guys on the 
team.”

“That (turnaround) is tough, 

but that’s what makes good 
teams good — and we know that,” 
Wagner said. “Adversity, we’ve 
proven that we can win and adjust. 
But prosperity? That’s what the 
really good teams adjust to. 

“We had a tough time, we 

found a way.”

Tough, indeed.

Wagner takes over 

As Moritz Wagner walked 

off the court on Saturday, he 
pointed up to the rafters of the 
Breslin Center. There, in a small, 
maize section, stood a few rows of 
Michigan fans who had made the 
commute to East Lansing.

Wagner had just scored a 

career-high 27 points to help the 
Wolverines beat No. 4 Michigan 
State, 82-72. He did it in a bevy 
of ways, from 3-point shooting to 
behind-the-back dribble moves to 
fall-away baseline jumpers.

And Michigan needed all of it. 

It needed Wagner to be the same 
player he had been earlier in the 
season, and Wagner delivered in 
spades.

With about 12 minutes left in 

the first half, the Spartans looked 
poised to go on a run. Michigan 
State’s Jaren Jackson Jr. blocked 
two shots on the defensive end 
before throwing down a vicious, 
one-handed dunk to give the 
Spartans the lead.

Moments later, as the crowd 

exploded around him, Wagner 
drilled an open three. He shushed 
the crowd as he backpedaled 
down the court.

In the second half, there was a 

similar situation. With just over 
eight minutes left, Michigan State 
took another lead thanks to a 
pair of free throws from Jackson. 
Again, the crowd crescendoed. 
Again, Wagner hit a 3-pointer to 
retake the lead.

All game long, when the 

Wolverines needed a spark, they 
looked to Wagner. And all game 
long, Wagner provided it. In a 
hostile 
environment, 
Wagner 

ripped the Spartans’ hearts out, 
and he did so with a smile on his 
face.

“We actually used to call 

him the Grayson Allen of the 
Big Ten, being that everybody 
kinda hates him,” said senior 
guard Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman. “But he loves that role, 
and he plays it well, coming in 
here and having a big game like he 
did. And we’re just happy to have 
him.”

The performance was even 

more eye-catching when you 
consider that it wasn’t a certainty 
that Wagner would play at all.

After re-tweaking an ankle 

injury on Thursday, Michigan 
coach John Beilein said he wasn’t 
sure if Wagner would be in 
Saturday’s lineup.

Wagner claimed he always 

knew he was going to play. Either 
way, knowing that there was 
some pain involved in Wagner’s 
performance makes it all-the-
more impressive.

“That stuff happens, dude,” 

Wagner said. “With an ankle 
injury, you can’t wait until it’s 
gone or 100 percent. You’ve just 
got to get used to it. Sometimes 
you re-tweak it, but that stuff 
happens, man.”

Added Beilein: “He had a lot 

of courage to come in and play, 
because he basically re-injured 
the same injury, but he didn’t look 
like it was bad today.”

Maybe it helped that this was 

a big game. When Wagner was 
on the fence to play earlier in 
the season, he sat out in games 
against Detroit and Alabama 
A&M — games the Wolverines 
would have won with or without 
Wagner.

On Saturday in a rivalry game 

against a top-5 team, sitting 
wasn’t much of an option.

And it would be easy for 

Wagner to brush off the matchup 
as just another game. He didn’t 
grow up around college basketball 
rivalries like this. He wasn’t 
always familiar with the passion 
or hatred for Michigan State that 
fans and other players feel. But he 
understands that the passion is 
there. For him, that’s enough.

That’s why his last action 

before leaving the court was a 
point.

“This game means so much 

for the people up there that you 
don’t see down here, and all of 
the Michigan family out there,” 
Wagner said, pointing again to the 
section where the Michigan fans 
sat. “Obviously, me being from 
Germany, it’s a little different, but 
for these people you want to play 
your heart out. We did that today.”

Coon, No. 8 Michigan unable to overcome No. 1 Penn State

As they filed out of the Crisler 

Center on Friday night, countless 
spectators looked back at the 
wrestling mat wondering what 
could have been had the night gone 
differently for the No. 8 Michigan 
wrestling team in the wake of its 
25–12 defeat by top-ranked Penn 
State.

The Wolverines began the 

highly anticipated matchup on a 
strong note, winning their first 
two duals. But that was short lived.

The Nittany Lions subsequently 

rattled off seven straight victories, 
five coming from Penn State’s 
reigning national champions: Zain 
Retherford, Jason Nolf, Vincenzo 
Joseph, Mark Hall and Bo Nickal.

The Michigan wrestlers fought 

hard, ending three matchups 
against former national champions 
with losses of three points or 
fewer. However, they won just 
three of the 10 total matchups.

The Wolverines’ top wrestler, 

redshirt 
senior 
Adam 
Coon, 

understood that Michigan was 
bound to struggle against such 
elite competition. He was not 
as concerned with the loss as 
he was with the potential for a 
future matchup in the NCAA 
Tournament.

“We were close in a lot of these 

matches, (but) we were on the 
losing side,” Coon said. “There’s 
one or two points that we need to 
find somewhere in the practice 
room and in the next two months 
… before we can make it to the 
NCAA (Tournament).”

Coon — the undefeated No. 

2 heavyweight wrestler in the 
nation and a former All-American 
— was one of the bright spots in the 
loss. He continued his continual 
dominance over his competition 
as he eased his way to an 8-0 rout 
over his Nittany Lion opponent.

Michigan coach Joe McFarland 

echoed Coon’s sentiments, but, 
he also pinpointed a specific 
area in which he would like 
to see improvement from the 
Wolverines.

“In every match, the guy who 

scored the first takedown won 
the match,” McFarland said. “It 
shows you how important that 
first takedown is and getting 
momentum on your side.

“When you’re able to score right 

away, it means you’re walking on 
the floor with the right mindset 
and I think in some cases that was 
the difference in some of our wins 
and some of our losses.”

In 
Michigan’s 
postgame 

meeting, McFarland put a great 
deal of emphasis on the fact that 
losing to the best squad in the 
nation is no reason to be ashamed. 
He used the dual as a way to find 
specific areas he would like to see 
each of his wrestlers improve.

McFarland pointed to one 

wrestler in particular — redshirt 
junior 
Alec 
Pantaleo 
— 
the 

fifth-ranked wrestler in the 157-
pound division and a former All-
American, who could specifically 
work on getting out from bottom.

Going into the third round of his 

matchup, Pantaleo saw only a one-
point deficit to the No. 1 wrestler 
in the division, Penn State’s Jason 
Nolf. Pantaleo had the choice to 
pick either top or bottom to begin 
the round and chose bottom 

assuming he would get a point 
for an escape to tie the match. His 
strategy proved ineffective and 
Nolf did not let him go throughout 
the entire two minutes.

“(Pantaleo’s) made some strides 

down there but he realizes he 
needs more work,” McFarland 
said. “You gotta be able to get away 
… we need to continue to work 
from the bottom position.” 

Pantaleo’s 
loss 
came 
at 

an inopportune time for the 
Wolverines, as the overall score 
was still close at 9-8 in favor of 
the Nittany Lions. A victory in 
his matchup would have greatly 
helped Michigan as the only way 
it could have possibly won the dual 
was to beat at least one of the Penn 
State elites.

“People can say it was a bad 

decision all they want but from 
last year I have made big strides 
getting up from bottom,” Pantaleo 
said. “I have yet to have anybody 
ride me out until now. I was really 
confident, I chose bottom, figured 
I was gonna get a point. Obviously, 
I still need to work on it, which 
is good to know now rather than 
later.”

Even 
though 
Pantaleo’s 

loss dealt a huge blow to the 
Wolverines, they were still down 
just four points. Not until the 184-
pound division match between 
Michigan’s fifth-ranked Domenic 
Abounader and Penn State’s top-
ranked Bo Nickal did the Nittany 
Lions seal the Wolverine’s fate.

Down 3-2 heading into the 

third round, Abounader needed 
a takedown to reclaim the lead. 
With less than a minute remaining 
in the round, Abounader attacked, 
positioned well and put Nickal on 
the ground for what the fans and 
Michigan wrestlers thought was a 
takedown. The referee disagreed. 
The 
same 
thing 
happened 

moments later and the fans went 
ballistic. Boos filled the arena.

Nickal would eventually break 

free of Abounader’s control and 
hit him with a takedown of his 
own, finishing off any hope the 
Wolverines had of pulling off the 
upset.

“If we’re going to be national 

champs we need to beat national 
champs,” Coon said. “We can’t 
just lose by one or two points 
and expect to win. We still have 
areas to work on, but overall, we 
definitely competed.”

‘M’ earns nation-best score

Just before the fourth and final 

rotation Saturday night, the No. 5 
Michigan women’s gymnastics 
team met in a mid-mat huddle 
at 
the 
Crisler 
Center. 
The 

Wolverines were already a point 
ahead of No. 29 Ohio State, and 
to clinch their first Big Ten meet, 
all they had to do was perform on 
the floor.

Luckily for Michigan, floor is 

traditionally its best event.

“We 
haven’t 
demonstrated 

that yet,” said Michigan coach 
Bev Plocki. “I told them, ‘I want 
you to dig down and I want you to 
work. You need to fight for every 
ten out there today.’ And they 
did.”

Aided by a handful of the 

Buckeyes’ 
stumbles 
on 
the 

balance beam, the Wolverines 
pulled ahead even further and 
earned the highest score in the 
country thus far, with a 197.550 to 
194.925 victory.

In the first rotation, freshman 

Syd Townsend found redemption. 
After missing her vault last week 
against then No. 4 Alabama, 
Townsend hit a Yurchenko one-
and-a-half vault for a team-high 
9.925.

Assistant coach Scott Vetere 

ran to Townsend to congratulate 
her with a hug, tripping and 
falling over a mat in excitement.

“I think having the first meet 

under my belt was an eye-opener, 
knowing how to train and what to 
do,” Townsend said. “Last week, I 
messed up on vault. Knowing that 
we still pulled out a win against 
Alabama, and knowing that my 
team had my back and that they 
can pull up the score, that was 
awesome.”

On uneven bars, Michigan 

was confident. Despite a fall 
from junior Olivia Karas, the 
Wolverines boasted five high-
scoring performances. Freshman 
Lauren Farley scored a 9.85 on 
her collegiate uneven-bar debut. 
Both 
Townsend 
and 
senior 

Brianna Brown scored a 9.90.

Townsend showed off her elite 

skills with precise handstands 
and a massive full to a double 
tuck — not to mention, she stuck 
the landing.

Brown’s height on the bars is 

what set her apart, allowing for a 
clean, double layout dismount.

Michigan 
continued 
to 

perform on its third rotation — 
the balance beam. Senior Paige 
Zaziski brought precision and 
power to her “Dancing in the 
Moonlight” routine, sticking a 
Gainer layout off the side of the 
beam for a 9.875. She continued 
her dominance throughout the 
night, winning all-around with a 
total score of 39.450.

Zaziski was only bested by 

Brown on the beam, who earned 
a 9.90 for her graceful split-
switch leap and side-somi finish.

The highlight of the evening 

came 
from 
junior 
Emma 

McLean, who boasted a career 
high 9.975 on her floor routine. 
Her showmanship was evident 
from the moment the song began, 
and the crowd clapped along.

“I love the noise. I’m having a 

party when I do my floor routine,” 
McLean said. “That takes my 
head away from what I’m actually 
doing. It’s a good distraction.”

McLean’s score tied for the top 

floor score in the nation, as did 
her 9.950 on vault.

After 
earning 
Big 
Ten 

Gymnast of the Week last week, 
Karas wrapped up the meet with 
a cheer-inducing double Arabian 
pass, earning a 9.950, though the 
crowd was flashing “tens.”

“Emma and Olivia both love 

floor,” Plocki said. “They love to 
entertain. Their confidence and 
energy just exudes.”

And with a hot start to the 

season, the Wolverines look to 
maintain such energy throughout 
the rest of their schedule.

“It’s all about really playing up 

to the crowd and enjoying what 
you’re doing out there,” Plocki 
said. “I’m really very proud of 
them all.”

DeLoof sisters enjoy time 
swimming for Michigan 

Players and athletes often call 

their teams families. But for the 
DeLoof sisters, families -– and 
teams – are even closer than 
you’d think.

Four DeLoof sisters have come 

to swim at Michigan over the 
years. Ali, the oldest, swam with 
the Wolverines from 2013-2016, 
while junior Catie DeLoof and 
sophomore Jackie DeLoof still 
have some time left as Michigan 
swimmers. Senior Gabby DeLoof 
has just two home meets left in 
her Michigan tenure.

Gabby, a Grosse Pointe native, 

didn’t always plan on swimming 
at Michigan, but after “going 
through the process… it was the 
best decision for us.”

Since she’s been in Ann Arbor, 

Gabby has picked up various 
accolades. As a two-time CSCAA 
All-American, four-time CSCAA 
All-America honorable mention 
and now team captain, she’s 
definitely found her way as a 
standout on the team and among 
her sisters.

The senior started the second 

half of her final season strong. In 
Saturday’s meet against Indiana, 
the senior placed first in three 
events – the 200-yard freestyle, 
the 100-yard freestyle and the 
400-yard freestyle relay – and 
helped her team to a win.

The 
only 
event 
Gabby 

competed in that she didn’t win 
was the 50-yard freestyle, where 
her sister Catie beat her out.

Gabby mentions she and Catie 

have tied on many occasions in 
competitive play and says “it’s 
nice to go back and forth.”

 “I think it would be more 

tough if one of us were constantly 
first and the other one was 
constantly second,” Gabby said.

When thinking about her 

experience as a sister and a 
swimmer during her time as a 
Wolverine, Gabby focuses on 
memories and the atmosphere as 
a whole.

Her favorite moment as a 

DeLoof sister?

“Probably us just goofing off 

little sister moments on deck,” 
Gabby said.

Her remarks were earnest 

and tender, but with a hint of 
competition, just as you’d expect 
from athletes and siblings.

As the Wolverines finish their 

season, Gabby has a lot to look 
forward to – like the Big Ten 
Tournament – and a lot to look 
back on. 

“I’m definitely gonna miss 

training with my sisters and 
training 
with 
my 
Michigan 

family,” Gabby said as her final 
few meets approach. “Everyone 
on the team is so dedicated and 
supportive not just to me as a 
captain, but just like a teammate 
and a family like we’re all kind of 
sisters on the team.”

Wolverines escape Nebraska with 69-64 win

Deja Church has ice in her 

veins.

The Wolverines trailed the 

Cornhuskers, 59-62, with a little 
over seven seconds remaining in 
regulation. They had one final 
chance at a comeback after calling 
a timeout. Nebraska played tight 
defense, and the clock ticked away 
as Michigan couldn’t find a good 
scoring chance. Church received a 
pass in the corner, but got fouled 
while shooting a 3-pointer with 
0.7 seconds left. With the game on 
the line, she headed to the line.

She was ready.
Church drained all three free-

throws to tie the game up, and 
shortly after, the contest was 
headed to overtime.

“Impressive. I think that says 

something about that kid,” said 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico to WTKA. “Holy cow. I 
don’t know if anybody could have 
done that. That is some serious 
pressure.”

In the extra period, the game 

was tied at 64 when junior center 
Hallie Thome made two free-
throws to give the Wolverines 
the lead. The No. 23 Michigan 
women’s basketball team (4-2 Big 
Ten, 15-4 overall) then pulled 
away, defeating the Cornhuskers 
(3-2, 12-6) on the road Saturday 
night, 69-64.

The first half of the contest 

was an offensive battle. The 
Wolverines came out strong, led 
by senior guard Katelynn Flaherty 
who finished the night with 26 
points. She found the basket with 
ease early on, but Nebraska did the 
same, and it was a close matchup.

Midway through the opening 

stanza 
Michigan’s 
defense 

picked up the slack by going 
to the press. This proved to be 
effective, causing problems for 
the Cornhuskers and helping the 
Wolverines to a 9-0 run. Michigan 
led 30-23 heading into the second 
quarter.

Nebraska 
cut 
into 
the 

deficit right away, though. The 
Cornhuskers caused troubles for 
the Wolverines and went on a 6-0 
run to bring the game within one, 

two minutes into the frame.

Just moments after, Flaherty 

created 
separation 
from 
her 

defender with a crossover and 
calmly drained a deep 3-pointer 
from the right side, acting like it 
was no big deal. But it was a big 
deal. That triple made Flaherty 
Michigan’s all-time leading scorer, 
man or woman, as she passed Glen 
Rice’s record of 2,442 points.

The rest of the half was a 

shootout with both sides shooting 
close to 60 percent from the field. 
The offenses excelled while the 
defenses stayed quiet, and the 
Wolverines led 48-44 at the break.

“We came out scoring on fire 

in the beginning of the game,” 
Barnes Arico said, “but we didn’t 
get the stops we needed to get.”

All 
of 
the 
offensive 
skill 

must have been used up by the 
intermission, 
though, 
because 

both 
teams 
looked 
sloppy 

throughout the second half. There 
was a lack of coordination within 
the offenses, as the two sides 
struggled to take care of the ball. 
Michigan had 16 turnovers in 
the second half while Nebraska 

had 10. The two teams combined 
for just nine points in the third 
quarter, and the Wolverines had a 
53-48 lead at the end of the stanza.

Following 
back-to-back 

3-pointers 
from 
Cornhusker 

guard Taylor Kissinger, the game 
was tied at 56 mid-way through 
the fourth frame. Soon after, 
Nebraska took its first lead of the 
game, but failed to seal the deal.

“In the second half, we slowed 

down and played at a really, really 
slow pace and weren’t able to score 
the basketball,” Barnes Arico said. 
“It was a game of two halves, but 
Nebraska gave us a great game.”

Though Flaherty made history 

and the Wolverines managed to 
win in overtime, it was not a pretty 
performance. Michigan’s offense 
finished the night with a season-
high 26 turnovers, which could 
have been deadly. The Wolverines 
will need to improve in this 
area moving forward, because 
other Big Ten teams won’t be as 
forgiving.

“We didn’t play our best,” 

Barnes Arico said. “But we dodged 
a bullet, that’s for sure.”

Freshman guard Deja Church sank three last-second free throws to send her team to overtime against Nebraska, where it eventually won, 69-64.

A sustainable difference

M

INNEAPOLIS — Two 
shots.

That’s all 

Michigan allowed in the third 
period against No. 9 Minnesota 
on Saturday.

The 

Wolverines 
entered the 
final frame 
up by two 
goals — just 
20 minutes 
away from 
earning its 
first sweep 
at Mariucci 
Arena in 41 
years. There’s 
a reason it had been that long.

The Golden Gophers don’t 

lose often at home. They don’t 
lose often, period. In those last 
41 years, they’ve had just three 
losing seasons.

But they reach a different 

level at Mariucci. Coming into 
the weekend, Minnesota was 
11-2 there and 1-8-1 anywhere 
else this season. While they 
struggle on the road, the 
Gophers’ talent-laden roster — 
14 players have been drafted by 
NHL teams — shines through 
at their home arena, with 
more room to operate on its 
larger, Olympic-sized rink. In 
desperate need of points of any 
kind to stay afloat in the Big 
Ten, Minnesota surely had no 
plans to simply roll over.

Instead, Michigan held the 

Gophers to two shots in the 
third period. Neither of which 
seriously challenged sophomore 
goaltender Hayden Lavigne.

That type of performance 

wouldn’t have happened two 
months ago.

While this weekend was the 

most stunning result of the 
Wolverines’ season so far, they 
aren’t any stranger to surprises. 
They defeated the then fourth-
ranked Gophers 5-4 in overtime 
on Nov. 11 after rallying from 
an early 3-0 hole. They fell 
behind 4-0 a night later and 
came back yet again, salvaging 
a tie that felt just as much like 
a victory.

If the enthusiastic, 

“Michigan hockey is back!” 
takes didn’t begin in earnest 
after the Wolverines came one 
minute away from sweeping 
Penn State in its own building 
two weeks prior, they surely did 
so after a win and a tie against 
a team many picked to win the 
Big Ten.

But it turns out they were a 

bit premature.

Michigan won only one of 

its next seven games after 
the Minnesota series. It was 
outscored 30-18 over that span 
— part of a larger stretch where 
the Wolverines gave up a brutal 
44 goals in 10 games.

Despite a porous defense, 

Michigan could still score. 
That’s never been in question. 
But the Wolverines’ diet of 
goals was unbalanced. They 
were subsisting off their top 
line of seniors Dexter Dancs 
and Tony Calderone and junior 
Cooper Marody, a trio which 
in the aforementioned 10-game 
stretch accounted for 42.6 
percent of Michigan’s total 
points. The proverbial fruits 

and vegetables — the second, 
third and fourth lines — weren’t 
a part of the Wolverines’ diet, 
and their opponents were 
proving it unsustainable.

“The makeup came off and 

we saw a lot of the blemishes 
this weekend,” said Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson after a 5-1 
loss to Ohio State on Nov. 25. 
“We were able to cover some 
things up, (but) this weekend 
we saw a little bit of some of the 
issues that we’re going to have 
going forward.”

A few of those issues looked 

on course to be corrected, 
starting with two encouraging 
performances against Notre 
Dame last weekend. Michigan 
held the then-No. 2 team in 
the nation to two goals in both 
games and outshot the Fighting 
Irish a combined 70-63. If not 
for Notre Dame goaltender Cale 
Morris erecting a brick wall in 
front of the net, the Wolverines 
likely would have come away 
with points of some variety.

All of these positive 

developments culminated this 

weekend.

The defense continued to 

flourish, allowing just two 
goals in even-strength play. 
Lavigne stopped 41 of the 45 
shots sent in his direction. 
The Gophers had precious few 
opportunities to show their 
individual skill, with Quinn 
Hughes, Sam Piazza, Luke 
Martin and Joseph Cecconi 
seemingly always in the right 
position in the defensive zone.

Michigan’s penalty-kill was 

maybe the only unit that had 
even a mediocre performance 
against Minnesota, allowing 
goals in both games. However, 
the Gophers needed almost 
all of the allotted two minutes 
to score each time. The group 
stepped up when it needed 
to as well, with a huge stop 
in the third period Saturday, 
and Pearson saw noted 
improvement on special-teams 
after he “didn’t like” Friday’s 
performance.

On the other end of the ice, 

the Wolverines scored eight 
goals — less than the 11 they 

scored in November’s series, 
but more than enough to 
win. These goals came early, 
too — Michigan was on the 
scoreboard within two minutes 
in both contests.

“We played with the lead 

all weekend and when you can 
do that on the road that really 
helps,” Pearson said. “Not like 
the previous games where it 
seems like we’ve been down 
2-0 every game, so that was 
a change this weekend and I 
thought it really gave our guys 
some confidence.”

While Marody, Calderone 

and Dancs still pulled the cart 
on offense, that cart weighed 
much less this time, as the unit 
tallied just six of Michigan’s 
19 points. At the same time, 
other lines emerged — for 
the first time this season, the 
Wolverines’ lineups remained 
the same for both games of 
a weekend series. Junior 
forward Brendan Warren 
scored Michigan’s first goal 
Saturday with a snipe from the 
slot, and sophomore forward 

Josh Norris, playing on the 
wing for the first time this 
season, followed suit with a 
one-timer off a beautiful feed 
from sophomore forward Jake 
Slaker.

The third line of freshman 

Dakota Raabe and sophomores 
Adam Winborg and James 
Sanchez excelled, as did the 
fourth line of sophomore Nick 
Pastujov and freshmen Jack 
Becker and Michael Pastujov, 
which totalled four points on 
Friday. Even the Wolverines’ 
floundering power-play, which 
had scored just 14.8 percent 
of the time entering the 
weekend, was much improved, 
as it capitalized on two of their 
three opportunities with the 
man-advantage Saturday.

“I liked Winborg, Raabe, 

Sanchez — they had a shift 
there at the end of the game 
and didn’t let Minnesota out 
of their zone for literally 45 
seconds,” Pearson said. “Just 
a great shift that you need at a 
time like that. Becker, Pastujov 
and Pastujov are playing well. 
I like Slaker and Norris, we put 
Norris on the wing, and he’s got 
some renewed energy — think 
he’s got three, four points in his 
last couple games here, so good 
for him.”

After being swept, Minnesota 

fell to 4-9-1 in the Big Ten, 
ahead of only Michigan State. 
This is a talented, but horribly 
inconsistent, Gopher team. 
Despite how monumental such 
a result is for Michigan, it 
hardly means the Wolverines 
are “back.”

But this weekend, Michigan 

did something that those 
Wolverines teams of yesteryear 
never accomplished, and looked 
dominant in doing so, no 
less. Sure, there’s always luck 
involved, but what Michigan 
did this weekend — winning 
with goaltending, defense and 
depth on offense — is perfectly 
sustainable.

No makeup needed.

Wolverines defeat Golden Gophers, 3-1, to earn weekend series sweep

MINNEAPOLIS — It’s been 

three years since the Michigan 
hockey team recorded a sweep 
on the road.

It’s 
been 

about 
as 
long 

since Minnesota 
was 
swept 
at 

Mariucci Arena.

And it’s been 

41 
years 
since 

Michigan 
came 

away 
from 

Minneapolis 
with a sweep.

All three of 

those 
streaks 

came to an end Saturday night.

On Saturday, the Wolverines 

(5-7-2 Big Ten, 10-10-2 overall) 
defeated 
the 
ninth-ranked 

Golden Gophers, 3-1, putting 
finality 
on 
their 
most 

impressive weekend of 
the season.

After falling 5-3 a 

night prior, one might 
have expected Minnesota 
(4-9-1, 13-12-1) to come out 
in attack mode Saturday. But 
instead, Michigan blitzed the 
Gophers out of the gate.

The Wolverines couldn’t do 

anything wrong to begin the 
game. 
The 
puck 
practically 

never left Minnesota’s zone, and 
every pass by a Michigan player 
seemed to hit the 
sweet spot of his 
teammates’ stick.

While 
the 

Wolverines 
didn’t score 15 
seconds into the 
game 
as 
they 

did Friday, that 
hardly mattered 
— they needed 
just 
58 
more 

seconds 
this 

time. Junior forward Brendan 
Warren, on the heels of a two-
goal outing, took the puck on the 

right wing, skated in front of the 
crease and snapped the game’s 
first score past Eric Schierhorn.

A minute later, freshman 

forward Josh Norris bullied 
his way towards the net with 
the puck, but a replay review 

determined 
that it did not 
cross the plane 
of the goal. An 
undeterred 
Norris, however, 
was 
rewarded 

for his efforts 
shortly after, 
streaking 
down 
the 

ice 
and 

lacing 
a 

one-

timer 
off 

a 
pinpoint 

pass 
from 

sophomore 

forward Jake Slaker.

After a dizzying first eight 

minutes of hockey, Michigan led 
in shots, 8-0, and in goals, 2-0.

“I thought yesterday we had 

some good chemistry,” Norris 
said. “And tonight we got a 
couple quick ones first five 

minutes, so that 
felt good.”

The 
Gophers 

managed to turn 
the tide slightly — 
granted, 
simply 

possessing 
the 

puck 
in 
the 

Wolverines’ zone 
for any length 
of 
time 
would 

have counted as 
such for these 

purposes — but did little with 
their eight shot attempts in the 
first period, all of which were 

saved by sophomore goaltender 
Hayden Lavigne.

However, it 

wasn’t any 
of 

those 
shots 
that 
told 
the 
story 
of 

Minnesota’s 
night. On a power-
play late in the first, forward 
Casey Mittelstadt cruised into 
the slot, gearing up for a golden 
opportunity to score. But all he 
did was uncork a weak knuckler 
that bounced well wide of the 
net.

The Gophers capitalized late 

on their second power play, 
though. A series of desperate 
swings at the puck by a cadre 
of Michigan defenders couldn’t 
knock it away from Darian 

Romanko, who gave Minnesota 
some life with 4:34 remaining in 
the second period.

But that momentum didn’t 

last long. After Minnesota’s Sam 
Rossini was sent to the box for 

roughing, 
senior 

forward 

Tony 

Calderone 

set up behind the 

net and found junior 

forward Cooper Marody just 
behind the red line. Somehow, 
Marody precisely angled his 
shot up and into the goal.

The third period saw no goals 

and just 10 shots combined for 
both teams — a surprisingly 
anti-climactic ending to the 
Wolverines’ biggest road win of 
the season.

That 
anticlimax 
was, 
in 

large part, a result of a marked 
improvement on special teams, 

after 
Michigan 
coach 
Mel 

Pearson stated that he “didn’t 
like” his team’s penalty kill on 
Friday. The Wolverines spread 
all 
over 
the 

ice 
to 
block 

shots from the 
Gophers’ power 
play 
in 
the 

third 
period, 

but 
according 

to 
Pearson, 

Lavigne, 
who 

registered 

17 
saves 

on 
18 

opportunities, 

was 
most 

responsible 

for 
the 

special 

teams’ 

success.

“I thought we did a great 

job penalty killing,” Pearson 
said. “Your goaltender’s got to 
be your best penalty killer… 
The one we killed in the third 
period was excellent. Blocking 
shots, doing a lot of good things, 
getting sticks.”

With 1:53 left to play, during 

the final timeout of the game, 
Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believin’” 
began 
to 
echo 
throughout 

Mariucci Arena. At that point, 
though, faced with a confident 
and 
rock-solid 
Michigan 

defense, it seemed like the 

few 
Minnesota 

fans left in the 
building had long 
ago ceased to do 
so.

The 

Wolverines, 
meanwhile, 
arrived 
in 

Minneapolis 
earlier 
this 

weekend ranked 
No. 
27 
in 
the 

PairWise rankings, far below the 
cutoff for NCAA Tournament 
contention. Coming away with 
a positive result of any kind 
seemed absolutely necessary. 
Winning 
one 
game 
would 

have likely been seen as a solid 
weekend.

Sweeping the No. 9 team 

in the nation, in one of the 
toughest 
places 
in 
college 

hockey for visitors to play, 
where they hadn’t done so in 
multiple 
generations? 
That’s 

closer to unbelievable.

And now, after a historic 

weekend, 
Michigan 
returns 

to Ann Arbor after jumping 12 
spots in Pairwise and recording 
its first sweep in Minnesota in 
decades.

This weekend could have 

been a mortal blow to the once-
slipping belief in the Wolverines’ 
postseason chances. The end 
result couldn’t have been more 
different.

 “This is a huge weekend 

for us in terms of standings, 
Pairwise, so we’re just going to 
enjoy the win,” Lavigne said. 
“It’s hard to sweep anywhere, 
let alone on the road.”

Added Pearson: “You let them 

enjoy it. We haven’t had one for 
a while, it was good to sing the 
song, and we’ll let them enjoy 
it until Monday. Then we’ll get 
back to work.”

Sweep a result of a strong all-around game for Michigan, and it was its first sweep at Mariucci Arena in 41 seasons
