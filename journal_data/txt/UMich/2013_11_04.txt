MUSIC Matters
unveils 'Big Thinkers'
fund, raised from sales
at annual concert
By MICHAEL SUGERMAN
Daily Staff Reporter
MUSIC Matters began with 10,
freshmen and $100 in the summer
of 2011. The idea was to introduce
a capstone event at the end of the
year consisting of daylong festivi-
ties finished off by a concert that
raised money for charity. Each
year, the charity would change.
"At the time, I was hoping that
we would scale up," LSA senior
Phillip Schermer, the president of
the organization, said. "I was hop-
ing that there would be a day when
we could give big gifts."
Monday, that day came as
MUSIC Matters unveiled its
$50,000 endowed "Big Think-
ers" scholarship. The need-based
scholarship is entirely student-

funded - the first of its kind at
the University - and is the club's
second gift to the school following
its inaugural donation of $10,000
to C.S. Mott Children's Hospital in
2012.
The initial endowment funds
were raised from ticket sales at the
group's Ben Folds concert in April.
Materials for the scholarship
are likely be released either at the
beginning of the 2014 academic
year or the following year.
The idea behind the scholarship
is that, every year, MUSIC Matters
students will work with Univer-
sity administrators to determine
a theme for the "Big Thinkers"
applications materials. The first
,year's topic will tackle social sus-
tainability.
"It will force applicants to think
about big problems and what they
can do or what we can do as a com-
munity to help solve those prob-
lems," Schermer said.
Schermer said UC 270, a course
taught last year by Martha Pollack,

with more than 1.2-billion
residents and a continuously
growing middle class, India has

proven to be a focus of interna-
tional business.
The Ross India Business
Conference hosted a series of
speakers Friday and created
dialogue concerning how busi-
nesses can work with the intri-
cacies of the Indian culture and
economy with ventures in the
country to about 200 attendees.
With the theme of "Dream.
Lead. Inspire.," the aim of the

fifth-annual IBC was to bring
speakers involved with the
ongoing economic and cultural
transformation in India to the
forefront and give attendees
the opportunity to engage in
dialogue on how to best har-
ness the transformation.
"I certainly believe that stu-
dents cannot graduate from
business school today without a
clear understanding of the role

and importance of India," Busi-
ness Dean Alison Davis-Blake
said. "And that's why we have
this conference."
She stressed the importance
of India as a global "emerging
market" with a "growing mid-
dle class," and highlighted the
large cohort of Ross students
that'were of Indian origin.

IHA event at
Crisler brings

Watch party for
MSU game draws
400 attendees
By BRANDON SHAW
Daily Staff Reporter
Michigan football may
have lost Saturday in East
Lansing, but that didn't stop
a group of several hundred
Wolverines from , cheering
until the very last minute of
the game at Crisler Center.
About 400 students arrived
to a watch party event hosted
by the Residence Hall Asso-
ciation - the student-run
government of dorm residents
- at Crisler Arena, the home
of the University's basketball
teams.
At 3:37 p.m. the lights went
down to simulate the opening
of a basketball game, and the
scoreboard monitors transi-
tioned from football highlight
reels to live television cover-
age of the Michigan football
game against Michigan State

University.
Public Policy junior Gar-
rett Kessler, president of
RHA, and LSA sophomore
Christianna Pedley, RHA's
vice president for finance,
introduced the game by not-
ing that Michigan's record
against Michigan State stands
at 68-32-5.
Most guests at the event
were maize-and-blue-outfit-
ted underclassmen. Several
attendees said they were more
likely to come to the event
at Crisler and others like it
because they have less access
to televisions in the residence
halls. However, event orga-
nizers expected a much larger
audience at Crisler. Both the
media release and the offi-
cial event announcement said
RHA expected 10,000 stu-
dents to attend.
LSA sophomore Kyle
Crane, RHA's vice president
for internal relations, said
he and other members of the
association had big hopes in

Student employee
abandoned idling
bus off campus
By MATTHEW JACKONEN
Daily StaffReporter
A 22-year old male student
bus driver was arrested after
he left a Blue Bus unattended
for over two hours near the

intersection of Arch and White
Streets early Saturday morning.
The bus was left alone and
running between roughly mid-
night and 2 a.m.
University Police arrived to
check on the status of the bus
shortly after 2 a.m. After search-
ing the vehicle they found a
backpack and a wallet that may
have led to the missing driver.
The bus's driver arrived
shortly thereafter and police

proceeded to question him.
The driver promptly took
responsibility for the vehicle,
and after a series of questions, he
admitted he had left the bus and
walked to his place of residence.
He responded in the affirmative
when police officers asked if he
had been preoccupied at home.
Police on scene also said the
University's bus dispatch had
mentioned that a driver had

Kosovo: Local elections
test relations with Serbia

Gunman alleges he acted

President Jahjaga
speaks out against
violence
PRISTINA, Kosovo (AP) -
Hard-line Serbs in northern
Kosovo intimidated would-be
voters and were suspected of
attacking a polling station dur-
ing local elections Sunday. The
actions underscored Kosovo's
strained relations with Serbia,
even as both states seek closer
ties to the European Union.
It was the first time voters
in all of Kosovo were choos-
ing local councilors and mayors
since the country seceded from
Serbia in 2008.
The participation in the
election of minority Serbs in
Kosovo was being watched care-
fully. The integration of Serbs
into Kosovarpolitical life is akey
element of an EU-brokered deal
between Serbia and Kosovo that

seeks to settle their disputes and
unlock EU funds.
The Serb hard-liners' tactics,
however, appeared to suppress
voter turnout and raised con-
cerns that Serbia had not ful-
filled its pledge to stop fueling
defiance among Serbs in Kosovo,
especially in the north, where
they dominate the population.
Kosovo President Atifete Jah-
jaga warned Serb hard-liners not
to undermine the central gov-
ernment in Pristina.
"Such acts will be met with
swift response of the security
mechanisms in an attempt to
establish rule of law, a necessity
in this part of the country," Jah-
jaga said in a statement.
The comments came after a
group of some 30 masked men
barged -into the polling station
in the late afternoon, smashing
windows and tearing up voting
material.
Associated Press footage
showed police sealing off the

H,-,,

area. It also showed members
of the Organization for Secu-
rity and Cooperation in Europe,
which helped organize the vote
in the north, leaving the polling
station in their vehicles. The sta-
tign was later closed.
Serbia's prime minister, Ivica
Dacic, urged Serbs in Kosovo's
north to defy the threats and
the anti-election campaign and
cast their ballots. He said par-
ticipation in the election is in
the interest of the Serb people in
Kosovo.
"Let us once do something
that is in our interest and not
in the interest of our enemies,"
Dacic said. "The fate of Serbs in
Kosovo should be in their own
hands, and not (Kosovo Prime
Minister Hashim) Thaci's or the
extremists'."
About 1.8 million voters are
entitled to vote in 39 munici-
palities and elect mayors and
local councilors. Voter turn-
out in Kosovo stood at 46
percent, excluding the Serb-
dominated north, as polls closed
at 1800GMT.
An AP reporter witnessed
Serbs crowding outside poll-
ing stations in the northern city
of Mitrovica to discourage fel-
low Serbs from voting. Posters
describing participation in elec-
tions as treason also have sprung
up in Serb-majority areas.
Some Serbs fear the vote vali-
dates the secession of Kosovo,
which declared independence
from Serbia in 2008. The U.S.
and the majority of the 28 EU
countries recognize the new
state, but Serbia rejects Kosovo's
independence, as do many Serbs
now living in Kosovo.
"I can't vote in these elec-
tions. To me these are foreign
elections," said Zeljko Vuckovic,
a Serb resident of Mitrovica.
Another Serb, Radomir Milic,
was one of the few voters who
responded to Serbia's call to
elect their leaders in an interna-
tionally backed process.
"I vote for a better life because
if we do not vote we cannot sur-
vive here," Milic said.

Motives for attack
remain unclear as
FBI investigation
continues
LOS ANGELES (AP) - The
gunman charged in the deadly
shooting at Los Angeles Inter-
national Airport lay bloodied
and handcuffed on the floor of
Terminal 3 after being gunned
down by police, but he replied
to critical questions that helped
authorities lock down the scene.
Paul Ciancia, 23, was hauled
away moments later on a stretch-
er and later heavily sedated for
medical reasons, but not before
he told investigators he had acted
alone when he opened fire in the
terminal, a law enforcement offi-
cial who has been briefed on the
investigation told The Associ-
ated Press on Sunday.
Ciancia, an unemployed
motorcycle mechanic who
recently moved to Los Ange-
les from the small, blue-collar
town of Pennsville, N.J., also told
police a friend had dropped him
at LAX on Friday just moments
before he shot a Transportation
Security Administration officer
at point-blank range and wound-
ed three other people, including
two more TSA workers.
Officials do not believe that
the friend knew of the shooter's
plans. Ciancia arrived at the air-
port in a black Hyundai and was
not a ticketed passenger.
Ciancia was under 24-hour
armed guard at the hospital Sun-
day after being shot four times,
the official said. He was sedated
for medical reasons, the official
said, adding that one gunshot to
the mouth blew a molar out of his
jaw.
Ciancia is facing charges of
murder of a federal officer and
committing violence at an inter-
national airport. The charges
could qualify him for the death
penalty. It wasn't immediately
clear when he would make a first
court appearance given his med-

ical condition.
In court documents and inter-
views, authorities spelled out a
chilling chain of events, saying
Ciancia walked into the airport,
pulled a .223-caliber assault rifle
from his duffel bag and fired
repeatedly at 39-year-old TSA
officer Gerardo I. Hernandez. He
turned back to see Hernandez
move and returned to finish him
off, according to surveillance
video reviewed by investigators.
He then fired on two other uni-
formed TSA employees and an
airline passenger, who all were
wounded, as he moved methodi-
cally throughthe security check-
point before airport police shot
him as panicked travelers hid in
stores and restaurants.
It wasn't clear why Ciancia
targeted TSA officers, but what
he left behind indicated he was
willing to kill any of them that
crossed his path, authorities
revealed.
The shooter's duffel bag con-
tained a handwritten letter
signed by Ciancia stating he'd
"made the conscious decision to
try to kill" multiple TSA employ-
ees and that he wanted to "instill
fear in their traitorous minds,"
FBI Agent in Charge David L.
Bowdich said.
"Black, white, yellow, brown,
I don't discriminate," the note
read, according to a paraphrase
by a law enforcement official
briefed on the investigation. The
official spoke on the condition of
anonymity because he was not
authorized to speak publicly.
The screed also mentioned
"fiat currency" and "NWO,"
possible references to the New
World Order, a conspiracy theory
that foresees a totalitarian one-
world government.
The letter also talked about
"how easy it is to get a gun into
the airport," the law enforce-
ment official said.
When searched, the suspect
had five 30-round magazines,
and his bag contained hundreds
more rounds in boxes.
U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul,
R-Texas, chairman of the House

Homeland Security Committee,
said on CNN's State of the Union
on Sunday that Ciancia's actions
show how difficult it is to pro-
tect travelers at a massive airport
such as LAX.
The terminals are open and
easily accessible to thousands of
people who arrive at large slid-
ing glass doors via a broad ring
road that fronts the facility and
is designed to move people along
quickly.
"It's like a shopping mall out-
side the perimeter, it's almost
like an open shopping mall,"
McCaul said.
The FBI has served a search
warrant on a Sun Valley resi-
dence where Ciancia lived, Ari
Dekofsky, a spokeswoman for
the FBI's Los Angeles field office,
said Sunday. Agents are still
interviewing people, she said.
Authorities believe the rifle
used in the shooting was pur-
chased in Los Angeles. Ciancia
also had two additional hand-
guns that he purchased in Los
Angeles, but which weren't at the
crime scene, a law enforcement
official said. The official, who
has been briefed on the inves-
tigation, was not authorized to
speak publicly. and requested
anonymity.
The purchases themselves
appeared legal, although author-
ities were still tracing them, and
it's unclear ifthe shooter used his
own identification or someone
else's, the official said.
"He didn't buy them on the
street. He didn'tbuythem on the
Internet," the official said. "He
bought them from a licensed gun
dealer - the rifle and the two
handguns."
Hernandez, a three-year vet-
eran of the TSA, moved to the
U.S. from El Salvador at age 15,
married his sweetheart, Ana, on
Valentine's Day in 1998 and had
two children.
The other two TSA officers
wounded in the attack have been
released from the hospital. On
Sunday, the TSA identified them
as James Speer, 54, and Tony
Grigsby, 36.

EAST LANSING, Mich.
Cuban life on
display in photos
at Michigan State
A Michigan State University
professor's photos from Cuba are
going on display Monday at the
East Lansing campus.
Music composition associate
professor Mark Sullivan says the
exhibition draws on more than
6,000 photos he shot during his
visit to the Caribbean Island
nation, long under a U.S. trade
embargo.
The opening of the exhibit
"Cuba: First Times Never Come
Again" is 3:30 to 5 p.m. in the
MSUglobal Knowledge and
Learning Innovations space
in the Nisbet Building. It's up
through year's end.
The 28-year Michigan State
faculty member says life in Cuba
is "radically different" from what
he'd expected.
Sullivan will be on hand to dis-
cuss his photos and plans with
the project, which include turn-
ing his pictures and experiences
in Cuba into a book.

were resuming after authorities
secured the airport.
Police spokesman Johnny Wil-

Several flights were diverted
and the terminal was evacuated
after the threat was received in
the afternoon. The airport was
shut down for more than two
hours.
CLEVELAND
Ohio trial set
for man in wife's
hospital killing
A man charged with fatally
shooting his wife in her hospital
bed killed her out of love and will
tell jurors about the heartbreak
he felt over her debilitated condi-
tion, his attorney said.
John Wise, of Massillon, under
house arrest since last year, goes
on trial Monday and will ask for
the jury's understanding, not
sympathy, attorney Paul Adam-
son said.
The 68-year-old Wise could
face life in prison if convicted of
aggravated murder.
Police say Wise calmly walked
into his 65-year-old wife's room
at Akron General Medical Center
and shot her on Aug. 4, 2012. Bar-
bara, his wife of 45 years, died the
next morning.
A week earlier, she had suf-
* fered triple cerebral aneurysms
that left her unable to speak.
YANGON, Myanmar

Boat carrying 70
* Muslim Rohingya
sinks off Myanmar
A boat carrying at least 70
Muslim Rohingya capsized and
sank Sunday off the western coast
of Myanmar, an aid worker said.
Only eight survivors have been
found.
The boat was in the Bay of Ben-
gal and headed for Bangladesh
when it went down early Sunday,
said Abdul Melik, who works for a
humanitarian organization in the
region.
The incident comes after the
United Nations warned that an
annual and often deadly exodus
of desperate people from Myan-
mar's Rakhine state appears to
have begun. The exodus usually
kicks off in November, when seas
begin to calm following the annu-
al monsoon.
As many as 1,500 people have
fled in the last week, Dan McNor-
ton, a spokesman for the U.N.
High Commission for Refugees,
said at a press briefing Saturday
in Geneva.

Ann Arbor voters' attention
has been lured into the 4th
Ward Ann Arbor City Coun-
cil race as write-in candidate
"Twenty Pound Carp" made a
splash by announcing his can-
didacy for the seat.
According to a Twitter
account, @TwentyPoundCarp,
the carp is an Ann Arbor native
that resided in a pond in Ann
Arbor's West Park but was
removed one year ago after city
officials claimed it was destroy-
ing the pond's ecosystem.
The Ann Arbor News report-
ed in November 2012 that a
20-inch-long, 20-pound carp
was pulled from a small pond,
then released into the Huron
River. The fish was removed
due to its destruction of sur-
rounding vegetation.
Twenty Pound Carp wrote
in an e-mail interview that his
campaign platform is centered
on economic reform and "fiscal
responsibility."

"A return to Ann Arbor's
past glories and prosperity
for all ... I fully expect we can
retain recent university gradu-
ates in Ann Arbor rather than
lose them to Chicago, where
the abattoirs cast but the mer-
est shadow their former great-
ness," the Twitter user wrote.
It added that securing the
city's borders is another aspect
of the campaign.
"With the destruction of
Blimpy Burgers, I have pro-
posed the immediate construc-
tion of a series of glacis and
escarpments, ravelins and Par-
rott gun installations to encir-
cle critical strategic points such
as Dominick's and the Fleet-
wood Diner," the user wrote.
Twenty Pound Carp wrote
that if elected, it would encour-
age the city to work with the
federal government to build
canals for its fellow aquatic
creatures, creating "the Venice
of Washtenaw County."
The user declined to dis-
close its exact residence, but is
working with the city to come
to an agreement on residency in
Ward 4.
The campaign appears to
be going swimmingly with 172
Twitter followers as of Sunday
afternoon.
"Campaign rolls on, we have
momentum. I'm focusing on
the Fourth ward, but can't help
it if supporters stray across

borders," @TwentyPoundCarp
tweeted on Oct. 30 in response
to questions about the support
spawning across Ann Arbor.
Fourth Ward candidate Jack
Eaton, a Democrat who is the
only candidate on the ward's
ballot, said he's kept a good
sense of humor about the new
candidate, mentioning that he
and the carp follow each other
on Twitter.
"I take it with the humor
that's intended," Eaton said.
Eaton also said the carp has
not yet filed for candidacy,
which is required before the
election for the votes to be
counted. Additionally, the carp
currently resides in the Huron
River, which does not fall with-
in the jurisdiction of the fourth
ward, leading to some fishy cir-
cumstances surrounding the
legitimacy of the campaign.
If elected, Twenty Pound
Carp would be the self-
described "bottom feeder" to
serve on city council and would
likely give a new fresh-water
face to the council while giving
voice to the long underrepre-
sented residents of Ann Arbor's
ponds and rivers.
Twenty Pound Carp also
tweeted that, if elected, it hopes
to have its special needs accom-
modated so that it can attend
council - meetings, though
details of those logistics are
still unclear.

Details of who was
behind attack and
why remain unclear
PARIS (AP) - Two veteran
French journalists kidnapped
and killed in northern Mali
were shot to death, French
authorities said Sunday, as
questions emerged about how
the gunmen managed to carry
out the attack near a town
where both French troops and
U.N. forces are based.
The slayings of Ghislaine
Dupont, 51, and Claude Verlon,
58, shocked France and under-
scored how insecure parts of
northern Mali remain months
after a French-led military
intervention against al-Qaida
and other extremists.
The new details, shared by
French Foreign Minister Lau-
rent Fabius after a meeting
of key ministers with French
President Francois Hollande,
failed to clarify who was
behind the killings and why the
pair was targeted.
He said the two were shot
multiple times and their bod-
ies found near the vehicle that
whisked them away. Earlier,
four Malian officials, including
the head of the armed forces
in Kidal said the journalists'
throats had been slit.
Their bodies were flown to
the Malian capital of Bamako
on Sunday, and were to be
returned to France on Mon-
day.
The Radio France Inter-
nationale journalists were
kidnapped Saturday after
interviewing a Tuareg rebel
leader in Kidal. The northern
town is under de facto rebel
control despite the presence of
French and U.N. troops.
French troops, alerted to
the kidnappings, set up check-
points, sent out patrols and
called in helicopters to search
for the journalists, French
military spokesman Col. Gilles
Jaron said.
But a patrol arrived too late,
finding the abandoned vehicle
east of the town and the bod-
ies nearby. The French troops,
some 200 of whom are based at
the Kidal airport, had earlier
found no trace of the fleeing
vehicle.
Fabius said the bodies were
found some 12 kilometers (8
miles) outside Kidal and "sev-
eral meters" from the vehicle.
RFI chief Marie-Christine
Saragosse said they were found
80 meters (87 feet) from the
kidnappers' vehicle.
The killings were "odious,
abject and revolting," Fabius
said. He said one journalist
had been hit with three bullets,
the other two - but that the
car, whose doors were locked,
showed no impact from bullets.
Cecile Megie, RFI's execu-
tive editor, said the two jour-
nalists had been seized by a
group that spirited them away
in a beige pickup truck.
"The site showed no trace of
fighting, gunfire. It was an exe-

Despite January's French-
led intervention and a presi-
dential election since, much of
Mali, especially the vast north,
remains in turmoil.
Suspicion as to who was
behind the killings grew as bits
of information trickled out.
Both Tuareg separatists of
the National Movement for
the Liberation of the Azawad,
known as the NMLA, and al-
Qaida-linked fighters operate
in the area.
The NMLA rebels launched
their latest rebellion in 2012.
Those rebels were later chased
out by al-Qaida's fighters in the
region but have returned to
prominence in Kidal in recent
months.
Al-Qaida in the Islamic
Maghreb has kidnapped West-
erners, but it tends not to kill
them but rather to hold them
for ransom as a means of bank-
rolling its operations.
The killings came four days
after France rejoiced at the lib-
eration of four other citizens,
who had been kidnapped in
neighboring Niger three years
ago and were found in north-
west Mali.
"The killers are those we are
fighting, that is, the terrorist
groups who refuse democracy
and refuse elections," Fabius
said.
Mali is to hold a parliamen-
tary vote later this month.
The journalists had traveled
to Kidal to report for a special
program on Mali ahead of the
voting.
Saragosse, who heads France
24 TV along with RFI, was
traveling to Bamako on Sunday
to accompany the return of the
bodies.
She said the slain journalists
had been accompanied from
Bamako to Kidal, some 1,500
kilometers (930 miles) north,
by U.N. troops who have been
present since the end of the
French intervention.
The pair - both long-time
RFI employees familiar with
challenging terrain - were
taken to the town hall, "the saf-
est place," said Saragosse, who
also met with Hollande Sunday.
It was not immediately clear
whether the U.N. troops were
in the vicinity at the time of the
kidnapping.
The French military spokes-
man confirmed reports that
French forces in Mali had
refused to take the journalists
to Kidal for security and "oper-
ational reasons."
A U.N. spokesman said its
troops had not noticed the
vehicle used in the kidnapping
in any of the seven checkpoints
in and around the city manned
by them.
"These seven checkpoints
are at major transit locations
and the vehicle of the kidnap-
pers was not noticed at any of
these checkpoints," said Oliv-
ier Salgado, spokesman for the
U.N. mission in Mali.
He added: "You need to put
this in the context of the desert.
This is a place with dunes. They
must have used a non-official

Crackdown on charity poker
rooms brings backlash

Legislation seeks to
control community
fundraising events
LANSING, Mich. (AP) -
Explosive growth in the pop-
ularity of poker has helped
Michigan's charities, churches
and civic groups stay afloat at
a time of dwindling donations
from elsewhere.
So perhaps it should come
as no surprise that the state's
efforts to rein in the charitable
gambling industry that has
grown more than 20-fold in a
decade are sparking backlash
- some of it in the form of raw
emotion.
Gov. Rick Snyder's deputy
lawyer Dave Murley drew rare
boos in a crowded Capitol com-
mittee room the other day when
he told lawmakers: "Charitable
poker began as a good cause,
evolved into a highly lucrative
business and has degenerated
into a racket."
At stake is the future of "mil-
lionaire parties," casino-style
events where nonprofits split
cash proceeds with unlicensed
poker rooms that provide the
space, dealers, poker chips and
playing cards along with food
and drinks. Many veterans
groups, prep sports booster clubs
and other nonprofits are no lon-
ger hosting Texas Hold 'em and
blackjack fundraisers in small
church basements and halls,
instead contracting with what
authorities charge are large "de
facto casinos" run through bars
and poker rooms.
Revenue from the events
reported to the state was $7.9
million in 2002, peaked at $197
million in 2011 and dipped to

$184 million in 2012,though offi-
cials believe it is more because
loopholes have been found in
$15,000 chip caps. Charities'
profits rose from $3.6 million in
2002 to $19.2 million two years
ago before leveling at $15.8 mil-
lion.
Tension has been building
ever since Snyder in June 2012
transferred oversight of the mil-
lionaire parties from the Lottery
Bureau to the Michigan Gaming
Control Board and its regulators
familiar with monitoring highly
regulated operations at horse
tracks and Detroit's casinos. The
agency, which already had been
working with the lottery to close
down sites due to illegal gam-
bling, cracked down on some
larger bars that contributed to
a 22 percent drop in licenses
issued for millionaire parties
through the first half of this year.
The friction is boiling over,
though, over new regulations
proposed by Executive Director
Richard Kalm.
Among the most significant
proposals are requiring five bona
fide members of a charity on
hand to help run the games, lim-
iting a single location to hosting
one event a dayand no more than
120 a year, and restricting the
fees that poker room businesses
charge charities.
"What started out being the
charities' money, the charities'
profit, has been whittled away
at," said Kalm, who wants to lift
a moratorium on new charitable
gamblingsites once the rules are
in place.
He said charities got 81 per-
cent of the proceeds a decade
ago but now receive half under
profit-sharing agreements never
envisioned when the casino-
style charity games were autho-

rized in a 1976 update of the
Bingo Act..
But charities and establish-
ments running the millionaire
parties like the current system
and are suspicious that the Sny-
der administration is working at
the behest of casino interests, an
accusation denied by regulators.
Charities say modest regulations
are OK but call the proposed
rules an overreach that could
significantly hurt legitimate
fundraising and put permanent
poker sites out of business.
Dane Nickols with the
Laingsburg Lions Club said that
while charities are taking less
of the cut on a percentage basis,
they are still raising much more
money than previously.
"We want the rooms to make
money so they will continue and
be there for us to make more
money," he said.
Nickols said his club raised
just $600 the first time it orga-
nized a poker event. Lottery
officials who audited the service
organizationtold him it was alot
of labor - 10 volunteers - with-
out much bang for the buck and
recommended he try out a card
room in a Lansing-area sports
bar.
. "By going to an established
room, we were able to make
more money," he said.
The dispute has attracted
attention from legislators, who
took the unusual step of holding
a hearing Thursday before the
state has a public hearing on the
rules later in November. After
the public weighs in, the agency
can make revisions - it already
has made a couple concessions
- before submitting them to
the 10-lawmaker Joint Commit-
tee on Administrative Rules as
early as December.

Why we should vote on Tuesday

This article addresses two topics:
social justice and hip hop.
Let me start by acknowledg-
ing that I am a white male from
an upper-middle class, primarily
white suburb. I have been taught
to be racist by our society without
even realizing it. I can look back
at certain comments I've made or
thoughts I've had in the past and
see them as racist. We are sur-
rounded by more racism than we
even realize; we don't recognize
that being racist can be as simple
as making a joke or, in this case,
throwing a party.
By now, I'm sure you've heard
about the University's chapter of
Theta Xi fraternity's party theme
idea, giving the party attendees an
opportunity to make fun of Black
culture. I did not feel the need to
write this until, in their apology let-
ter, a member of Theta Xi claimed
that they were inspired to do this by
hip-hop music. Let me stop here and
explain where I'm coming from.
For the past five years, I have
been immersed into the world of
breakdancing, otherwise known
as hip-hop culture. The traditional
term for a break-dancer is "b-boy."
According to the values of the b-boy
community, it doesn't matter what
color your skin is or how much
money your family has - you just
have to have soul. This community
and its art have helped me become
who I am today, and I've loved
every moment of it.
Hip-hop culture contains five ele-
ments: b-boying, rapping, DJ-ing,
graffiti and the knowledge of this
culture and one's interpretation of
it. Rap has taken on a new life within
popular culture, and rap music can
be very sexist - nobody is denying
that. But rock 'n' roll can also be very
sexist. Music can be sexist. Televi-
sion can be sexist. The media pro-
motes images, sounds and ideas that
shape who we should be.
Just by existing in' our society,
we're taught what boys should do

and what girls should do. We learn
what rich people and poor people
should do. We're taught about how
black people should be and how
white people should be. We're all
victims of our own ignorance.
Thus, if I do something racist,
I can try to blame society. But I'm
still the one to make those choices
and execute those actions. If I try to
blame anyone or anything else, it's
because I can't accept the fact that I
am racist. The same goes for blam-
ing hip-hop.
These next two sentences are
especially directed at the white
people reading this: Diversity
doesn't mean "not 100-percent
white." It means that every race is
represented and treated equally.
Also, don't be worried about being
labeled racist - be worried about
how your intentional or uninten-
tional racism can hurt others.
But let's get back to the topic at
hand: the party. The point of this
article is not to bash Greek life. I'd
just like to point out that as soon.as
fall semester begins, thousands of
freshmen are funneled into Greek
life. In this setting, they are gen-
erally surrounded by other white,
upper-class students and partici-
pate in the hook-up culture for their
entire time at our school. There
are also multicultural fraternities
- predominantly Black, Latino,
Asian or Indian. But I'm not talking
about the multicultural fraterni-
ties, but rather the predominately-
white fraternities. Many students
will know what I mean when I say
that typical members of the largely
white fraternities and sororities
rarely leave their social climate,
cutting.themselves off from the rest
of the school.
This controversy indicates a much
larger problem: Our society is still
very racist, and most white people
are unwilling to admit it. People are
scared of the truth - we're part of
the problem. If we are part of the
problem, we need to make changes in

our lives to become part of the solu-
tion.
So if your fraternity does some-
thing racist, don't blame hip-hop.
Blame yourself for not taking the
initiative to learn how to not be
racist. Hip-hop culture showed me
that race doesn't have to matter,
but that's not where I learned about
race. I learned about race at this
school. Through classes, campus
events and friends from different
backgrounds, I have learned of these
invisible lines between us.
These lines exist because it's
easier for us to stereotype than it
is for us to look at each person as a
unique.individual. Each person is a
unique individual, and in that sense,
we're all equal. But in a much more
real sense, our society gives some
people huge advantages over others
based on skin color, family wealth,
sexual orientation, gender, religion
and a million other factors that are
so easy to overlook. The University
has taught me this.
Hip-hop taught me that we can all
vibe out in the spirit of peace, love,
unity and having fun. I wish others
could develop this same perspective
on hip-hop, but the harsh reality is
that it's easier to point blame than
it is to take responsibility for mak-
ing this change. For people like the
party planners at Theta Xi, rap can
help to create strong negative ste-
reotypes of Black people - particu-
larly Black women. But they were
racist before they listened to hip-
hop. They were born into racism.
However, we can't blame others
for their ignorance. So this is now a
call for anybody reading this article
to rise up and take every opportu-
nity to learn what racism is and how
we can stop its presence in ourlives
and in our communities.
At this school, we're supposed to
be the Leaders andthe Best.It'stime
to start acting like it.

Perpetuating harmful stereotypes

An open letter to Allen Wu:
As a Black student on this cam-
pus, I was upset with the "Hood
Ratchet" party planned by Univer-
sity's chapter of Theta Xi fraternity.
After reading your published apol-
ogy in the Daily in which you said,
"I would like to sincerely apologize
for any negative emotions that you
and any other offended members of
the community may have felt" and
"I apologize for any hurt that I've
caused in our community," the lack
of specificity in your statements
gave me the impression that you
don't truly understand what you
did that was hurtful. I have friends
of many races and ethnicities who
were offended by the incident, and
I also have friends who weren't. I
don't speak on behalf of any of them.
I only want to tell you why it upset,
angered and hurt me.
. I would not have been bothered
by a hip-hop themed party. I might
- not have even been bothered by
some of the language you chose to
use in the party description, had
it been used in a different context.
What upset me was the juxtaposi-
tion of those words with images,
costumes and a video that almost
exclusively featured or described
Black people. I do agree that hip-hop
as a genre doesn't have to be Black;
in fact, it often isn't. However, that
belief is not one your Facebook event
depicted or supported. It may not

have explicitly said hip-hop equals
Black, but it didn't have to.
I'm not someone who identi-
fies with being "hood" or "ratchet."
When you parody those aspects of
Blackculture, I knowyou aren'ttalk-
ing about me - but others might not.
Events like yours help to reinforce
negative stereotypes about people
who look like me. They encourage
people who don't know me to fall
back on preconceived notions of
who I probably am instead of trying
to get to know me. They encourage
people to say things to me such as,
"Can you teach me how to twerk
since you know how?" or "You're so
much different than all other Black
people," or even, "Are your friends
back home ghetto?" I've been asked
each of these questions on this cam-
pus within the past year.
While you may hear those stereo-
types a lot on the radio or see them
on TV, I think they're perpetuated
by only a few in my community.
Those few people might be popular,
vocal and have a platform to do so,
but they don't represent the collec-
tive voices of all Black people. It's
not that I expect you or anyone else
to represent all aspects of Black cul-
ture when you have an event that
includes one small element of it, but
I would appreciate it if you didn't
perpetuate the stereotypical image
of all Black people being thugs and
hood rats with "ratchet pussies."

When you make it easy for some-
one with undiscerning eyes to
think your event is a party about
Slack people and Black culture in
general instead of a party about
hip-hop as a musical genre, that's
when it hurts me. When you name
an event in conjunction with a web-
site that is notorious for poorly rep-
resenting Black people instead of a
website that is solely related to hip-
hop, that's when it hurts me. When
almost all the descriptors to your
event come from Black hip-hop
and rap songs and adhere to Black-
targeted stereotypes, instead of the
multicultural "music genre con-
sumed by all races" version of hip-
hop you described in your response
to Erin Fischer's viewpoint, that's
when it hurts me.
I believe that although it had to
be requested, your published apol-
ogy was sincere. I understand that
you didn't think about your actions
beforehand, and I'm not going to
condemn you for something that
seems like an honest mistake. I, too,
have done and still do things that
are hurtful to people because it's
difficult to relate to people whose
struggles aren't my own. When
you created the event, you probably
didn't consider the effects that it
would have on people like me. Now
you do. I hope you act accordingly.

These are not the federal elections. There
won't be nationally televised debates, widely
publicized gaffes by candidates nor campaign
commercials telling you to care about voting.
These are the localelections.And while they may
not offer the big, sexy issues or the widespread
appeal that federal elections do, local elections
often have a bigger impact on everyday life.
This Tuesday, the local elections will take
place in Ann Arbor. In the past, these local elec-
tions have had the lowest voter turnout of all
elections. And the college-aged bracket has had
by far the lowest turnout of all age ranges. There
were atotal of three votes cast in the Hill Campus
Precinct in 2011. That's right - out of more than
2,000registered voters,just three decided to take
the time to make their voices heard.
The above statistic is the reason why I am writ-
ingthis. Frankly,it'sdepressingtoseestudentsso

total money in taxes as the federal government
throughout the country.Instead of applyingthese
taxes to programs at the large federalscale, these
funds are used exclusively for issues in local life
-roads, schools, libraries, publictransit, to name
a few. And these are the issues that truly have an
effect on student life here at the University.
Additionally, local elections are a way to actu-
allygetyourvoiceheard.With significantlyfewer

voters, each vote carries much more weight than
it carries in federal elections. And each constitu-
ent is important to the members of Ann Arbor
City Council, meaning that if there's an issue that
you care deeply about, getting in touch with a city
council member could actually reap benefits in
the immediate future.
I know that many students find excuses not to
vote - "I'm too busy," "I have an exam coming
up," and "I don't know enough about the issues,"
are rationalizations I've heard far too often.
Leave 15 minutes early and stop at your polling
place on the way to class. Take those 30 minutes
that you inevitably spend on Facebook or Reddit
and vote instead.
If you're looking for ways to become educated
about the issues and candidates on the ballot, the
Central Student Government's Voice Your Vote
commissionwill haveatable on Mondayfrom 10
a.m. to 2 p.m. in the Angell Hall lobby with fact
sheets on each of the candidates and issues that
you will see on the ballot. We will also have a
map of polling places for addresses close to cam-
pus. Additionally, Michigan's Secretary of State's
MiVote website has information on polling plac-
es, sample ballots, and registration status.
Voting is the most important part ofthe politi-
cal process, and is one of the few ways to make
your voice heard on important issues. I implore
you to exercise your right to vote in these local
elections. Hail tothevoters.
Election Day is Nov.5. Polls will be open from 7
a.m. to 8p.m.

Disturbingly, negative stereotypes and misogynistic
behavior are woven into popular culture today. We
believe this reinforces the ongoing need to continually
pay attention to diversity and engage in thoughtful,
challenging conversations about social identities.'

affairs, and former provost Philip
Hanlon, inspired the group to
form a scholarship. Schermer
added that providing those in
need with the opportunities the
University offers seemed like the
ideal way to "pay it forward." At a
private ceremony for the scholar-
ship last week, Pollock agreed.
"on behalf of all of the faculty
on campus, our number one goal
intheupcomingcapitalcampaign
is financial aid for students," Pol-
lack said in an address to MUSIC
Matters members. "You are right
there and I couldn't be happier."
"MUSIC Matters is one of
many great student organiza-
tions - such as Dance Mara-
thon, Galens Medical Society
and Alternative Spring Break -
that fundraise to support great
causes," Jerry May, the Univer-
sity's vice president for develop-
ment, said in a statement. "That

"Not everyone can go to East
Lansing; not everyone can get
there and not everyone has a
place to go to watch the game,"
Crane said. "So we wanted
to offer them a place to come
together to watch as friends and
fellow Wolverine fans."
Crane emphasized that the
board hopes to build on the
name recognition they have
garnered from recent events,
such as the Pre-Class Bash and
the A-MAIZE-ing Race, to spur
more large-scale events moving
forward.
"We wanted to be the first
student organization to put on
an event like this, to team with
the Athletic Department and to
open up doors in the future for
other student organizations to
attempt similar initiatives," he

sense of 'creative expression in
the kids who are participating,"
Naoum said. "Here the kids are in
charge of what they're going to do
in the workshops and they're the
ones who get to dance the way
they want to dance or act the way
they want to act."
Students from Bennett Ele-
mentary School, Brewer Ele-
mentary School and Chrysler
Elementary School were greeted
with high-fives and cheers from
50 University student volunteers,'
including three students dressed
as clowns and a woman on stilts.
During the first half of the
event, Detroit students watched
various University student per-
formance groups, including
the Moanin' Frogs, G-Men and
Rhythm Tap. Naoum said the per-
formance variety was a success.

Michigan students would engage
in philanthropy on campus to
support not only the univer-
sity but also their peers, is what
makes our students special."
Schermer hopes that in the
years to come, the endowment
will grow to meet this financial
goal on an increasing basis. Part
of the success of this fundrais-
ing will -rely on changes to the
group's day of springtime activi-
ties, called SpringFest.
The club plans to expand the
event, basing its structure off of
South By Southwest, a nine-day
spring festival in Austin, Texas
that is a hub for music, film and
technology.
"It's going to be eight hours,
and it's going to be an experien-
tial arts festival, a film festival, an
innovation," Schermer said.
He also hopes to upgrade the
venue for the concert. The group
booked J. Cole in 2012 and Ben
Folds in 2013, and both artists
performed in Hill Auditorium.
Schermer wants to fit more
students in, and said the Crisler

Center and Yost Arena are both
possibilities for this year's con-
cert, although nothing is set.
"The whole idea here is to
make it as big as possible,"
Schermer said. "More students
enjoy it, that's great. More
money for charity, that's great.
The bigger the venue, the cooler
the things you can do in the con-
cert."
Ken Fischer, president of the
University Musical Society and
an advisor of the club, lauded
MUSIC Matters for its success
from its establishment onward
in a speech to the students of
MUSIC Matters.
"The success that you've had
is unprecedented," Fischer told
members of the group at the
private ceremony. "We talk
about you among university
presenters all over the coun-
try, because it's not supposed
to be this way. You're supposed
to have a set of failures, but
you've organized yourselves
in such a way to be successful
from the get-go."

students of international origin

the last few years, she said Indian
students have stood as the second
largest. There are more than 500
Ross alumni currently situated in
India as members of the Univer-
sity's.India Alumni Association.
Additionally, every year, 25 to
30 Ross students are sent to the
nation for business projects.
The keynote speaker was Mark
Fields, chief operating officer of
Ford Motor Company. As a com-
pany that has recently made sev-
eral manufacturing investments
in India and employs approxi-
mately 11,000 people in the coun-
try, Ford served as an example of
a firm that truly understands how
to succeed in the unique Indian
marketplace.

After calling the situation in to
dispatch, University Police told
the driver that he could be arrest-
ed for fraud and would "most like-
ly" be fired.
Shortly thereafter, the driv-
er was handcuffed and taken
away. University Police later
said the student was arrested
on charges of unlawfully driv-

and open eyes to learn the local
market," Fields explained, nar-
rating several examples in
which Ford's vehicles had to
be redesigned for the coun-
try - including more "vibrant"
interiors to suit the bright color
choices many Indians preferred,
strong air conditioning to fight
the country's humidity and more
durable horns as frequent honk-
ing is a common practice.
As a manufacturer, Fields said
the firm'stakeawayfromworking
in India was to "listen to the mar-
ket and make trade-offs."
"We're a growth business and
a growth industry," he said. "By
2020 we see (majority of growth)
happening in China and India,
and that's why we're so excited to
be here."

Additional speakers included
Ann Arbor Mayor John Hieftje,

tor of local business incubator
Ann Arbor SPARK, spoke about
how his firm is helping new start-
ups in the city. Ross alum G.V.
Sanjay Reddy, vice chairman of
the Indian conglomerate GVK

of leaders to make a social differ-
ence through business.
University alum Nina Davu-
luri, who was recently crowned
Miss America, also attended the
event. As the first woman of Indi-
an-American origin to win the
title, Davuluri spoke on her plat-
form of diversity and her experi-
ences traveling the country.
Given that Miss America had
always been the "girl next door"

didn't alert police to the missing

soon to comment.
Last year, Antoine James, an
ex-University bus driver, was
charged with unlawfully driving
away in a car. James, two years
after his time as a bus driver had

said.
Crane also said the Athlet-
ic Department sponsored the
event and played an active role
in its development. Athletic
Department officials helped to
rent out Crisler and attempted to
schedule an appearance by the
men's basketball team, which
ultimately fell through.
Several members of RHA's
executive board noted after
the event that a more tailored
marketing and publicity strat-
egy will be necessary for future
events as they hope to target a
more specific audience.
Crane said this event, like
several others the RHA is host-
ing this year, was aimed at bol-
stering the brand recognition
of the RHA as a key program-
ming entity for the student body
as a whole, not just the student
groups that come to them seek-
ing funding for various projects.
"We're trying to stop being
thought of as almost a bank or

an ATM-type brand, where you
just come to us for cash once
in a while," Crane said. "We're
also trying to put together fun
events to bring the student body
together."
LSA sophomore Darwin Had-
ley attended the Crisler event
and said he came because he
enjoys watching University
sporting events in a communal
atmosphere.
"I thought it would be amaz-
ing to watch in Crisler Arena,
and I was right," he said.
At halftime, the RHA board
brought several volunteers from
the audience onto the court
for shooting competitions and
raffles. Among the prizes for
the shoot-off were gift cards to
the University's athletic apparel
retailer the M Den, as well as the
outdoor outfitter Bivouac.
Raffle prizes included a Mich-
igan football jersey and a Nook
digital reading device, which
Hadley won.

"What we want is for them to
get an idea that performing arts
means a lot of different things.
I really think it is a way for each
kid that has unique interests to
connect with the performance in
some way," Naoum said.
The performers and volunteers
maintained a fun atmosphere at
the League, with some help from
the clowns to engage the young
audience.
"We're having just as much
fun as they have, probably more
fun," Music, Theatre & Dance
senior Zoe Kanters - otherwise
known by her clown alter ego,
Chonda - said. "We're just play-
ing around and trying to pump
them up."
After the performances, the
students split into groups and
rotated through four 30-minute
workshops showcasing forms
of acting, dance, film and beat
boxing. In each workshop the
students were taught about the

performing art and then par-
ticipated in creating dances and
songs.
Music, Theatre & Dance senior
Erika Henningsen, co-president
of MPOW, said the kids were very
excited to show off their new
skills during the lunch break.
"The kids always have a good
time, and it stays with them, we
hope," Henningsen said.
MPOW began planning the
event in early September. While
in the past the event was limited
to Music, Theatre & Dance stu-
dent volunteers, this year's event
included more students from
other schools in the event plan-
ning committees, said Music,
Theatre & Dance senior Ian Wil-
liams, MPOW's performance
committee head.
"We made an effort to expand
not only through the School of
Music, but to the rest of the Uni-
versity and try to make it a bigger
event," Williams said.

* Academic focus a welcome
change for WashU provost

Thorp happy to
move past student-
athlete scandels as
UNC chancellor
ST. LOUIS (AP) - After
five scandal-plagued -years as
University of North Carolina
chancellor, Holden Thorp was
downright ecstatic to start over
on a campus where the term
"student-athlete" doesn't evince
snickers and groans.
The new provost at the pri-
vate Washington University
spends little time worrying
about academically suspect
jocks - as a Division III school,
WashU doesn't even award ath-
letic scholarships. It's a far cry
from Chapel Hill, where an
academic fraud investigation
found dozens of athletes tak-
ing no-show classes, along with
assorted other abuses, and led
to Thorp's resignation from the
top job at his alma mater - the
sole college he applied to as a
high school senior in Fayette-
ville, N.C.
"I wanted to get back closer

to the academic side of things,"
said Thorp, who arrived in St.
Louis three months ago. "Wash-
ington University, more than a
public university, is onthe whole
more unapologetically devoted
to academic achievement as its
primary focus." For him, "that is
a liberating feeling."
His move down the academic
chain surprised many,but Thorp
is not alone among college CEOs
seeking such refuge, especially
those who have weathered the
turbulent world of big-time
sports. Current and past college
presidents, as well as education
industry observers, say many
campus heads are unprepared
for the white-hot glare that cam-
pus athletics emit when things
go wrong, from player arrests to
NCAA investigations and coach
firings - or in Thorp's case, all
three.
"There were a lot of miscon-
ceptions about college sports,"
Thorp said, alluding to the
notion that at UNC, the quest
for athletics successwould never
compromise the school's aca-
demic standards. "In some ways,
I was as much a part of this as
anybody, protecting people from

some of the tough truths about
college sports."
In a report last year by the
American Council on Education,
nearly one-quarter of the more
than 1,600 college presidents
surveyed said they were also
unprepared for the rigors of fun-
draising - whether for academ-
ics or athletics.
At Syracuse University, presi-
dent and chancellor Nancy Can-
torisheaded to the much smaller
Newark, N.J., campus of Rut-
gers, two years after firing an
assistant basketball coach who'd
been accused of sex crimes but
never charged.
Former University of Colo-
rado president Betsy Hoffman,
who left Boulder amid a foot-
ball recruiting controversy,
resurfaced as provost at Iowa
State and is now an economics
professor. And Martha Saun-
ders, who left the University of
Southern Mississippi after an
athletics audit found a $1 mil-
lion shortfall, quietly became
provost at the University of
West Florida, the school where
her academic career began
three decades ago as a public
relations professor.

'Chasing Utopia'
continues famed
poet's legacy
By KATHLEEN DAVIS
For the Daily
Nikki Giovanni is undoubtedly

the author of 19
collections of.B+
original poetry
and writing Chasing
10 children's Utopia
books, and she
earned a Gram- Nikki Giovanni
my Award nom-
ination for Best Harper Collins
Spoken Word
Album in 2004.
She is a seven-time winner of the
NAACP Image Award as well a
recipient of the Langston Hughes
Medal for Outstanding Poetry,
among many other awards.
Giovanni's impact on American
writing is mainly due to her poetic
stance on social justice and equal-
ity. Her latest collection, "Chasing
Utopia," however, is a lightheart-
ed reflection on younger days and
a positive outlook on growing
older.
To set the scene of the book in
cheeky fashion, Giovanni clari-
fies that the titular "utopia" she's
chasing isn't necessarily based
on the perfect society you'd
expect, but on the Samuel Adams

27-percent alcohol-by-volume
pseudo-beer called "Utopia." This
lighthearted tone sets the scene
for the book and is a testament to
Giovanni's ability to not take her-
self too seriously.
The structure of "Utopia" is
characterized by pages of poetry
broken up by longer anecdotes,
which allow her readers to gain
a more personal and straight-
forward look into her life. The
anecdotes range anywhere from
the analysis of the logistics and
,legalities that should be more
involved in "Aesop's Fables," to
peace and naivety during a segre-
gated childhood.
An overarching theme in the
book is the concept of cooking,
both traditionally and in a fan-
tastical sense. While reading
"Utopia," we gain detailed reci-
pes for soups, biscuits and even
for a perfect man (which, if you
were wondering, involves a nice
handful of intelligence, a pinch of
ambition and a sense of humor, if
desired). For the serious recipes,
Giovanni notes that she has such
a positive connotation with the
flavor because of the memories
attached with cooking them back
home.
Since Giovanni has been a pro-
lific poet for several decades and
is now 70 years old, it's appro-
priate that the idea of aging is
heavily embedded in "Chasing
Utopia." In "I Am At That Point,"
she writes, "embracing the old
things is a good new thing." This

simple phrase captures the over-
all essence of the book, looking
fondly at growing up in the sub-
urbs of Cincinnati and summers
with her grandparents in Ten-
nessee.
There is no aging without
the concept of death at the fin-
ish line, and the darker poems
within "Utopia" are unafraid to
explore it. While there are poems
about the passing of old friends
and family, one of the sadder
anecdotes withinthe book makes
mention of the lives lost during
the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre.
Giovanni, who was a professor
of English at the university dur-
ing the. shooting, actually taught
shooter Seung-Hui Cho ina poet-
ry class. But these poems tinged
with sadness are only a small
percentage of the overall content
in "Utopia."
And it couldn't be Nikki
Giovanni poetry without the
theme that made her such a pro-
lific writer during the 1960s:
equality. Many of these poems
are written through the voice of
a childish self, still naive to the
extremity of social turmoil hap-
pening outside her door. How-
ever, there doesn't seem to be
much disdain from Giovanni
when it comes to reflecting upon
her childhood. "What a pleasure
to be young and creative and so
sure of the future," she writes, a
statement which could truly be
an embodiment of the whole col-
lege experience.

the strange world author Card
makes of Battle School. The
brittle hardness that Ender
develops so quickly is a believ-
able side effect of the tension
that Ford brings to the seqeen
as his superior.
But there isn't enough run-
time to appreciate the scope of
Card's universe. Because of the
film's brevity, one of the more
complex relationships of the
film, the intimacy Ender shares
with his sister, Valentine (Abi-
gail Breslin, "Little Miss Sun-

incestuous. On a positive note,

Still, there's no getting
around the fact that this film
is too ambitious and ultimately
fails the book. But the sheer
possibility of "Ender's Game"
finding box-office success is a
raised fist in the air for any fan
who has witnessed a number of
studios struggle to bring this
film to life. The movie is both
an honorable attempt and a
worthwhile ride.

comedy about

cans.
In "A.C.O.D."
- which stands for Adult Chil-
dren of Divorce - restaurant
owner Carter (Adam Scott,
"Parks and Recreation") discov-
ers that as achildhe unknowingly
participated in a study on the psy-
chological effects of divorce. The
original researcher, Dr. Judith
(Jane Lynch, "Glee"), decides to
begin a study on how his parents'
divorce affected his adult life
right as his naive younger broth-
er Trey (Clark Duke, "Hot Tub
Time Machine") decides to get
married to his girlfriend of four
months. When Clark attempts
to get his parents, Hugh (Rich-
ard Jenkins, "Step Brothers")
and Melissa (Catherine O'Hara,
"Where the Wild Things Are"),
to agree to attend the same
wedding, his own carefully con-
trolled life gets shaken up.
A mediocre
'Crazy, Stupid,
Love.'
While the entire cast per-
forms commendably, the sto-
ryline neglects to give it much
emotional depth with which
to work. The film never finds
any strength in the connec-
tions between its main charac-
ters, making their relationships
seem tenuous at best. Amy
Poehler ("Parks and Recre-
ation") and Jessica Alba ("Val-
entine's Day") pop in and out
with minimal character devel-
opment, Carter's parents can't
commit to anything and Trey
comes off as a dumb kid rush-
ing into marriage. Carter him-
self fears committing to his
girlfriend of four years (Mary
Elizabeth Winstead, "Scott Pil-
grim vs. the World"), and their
relationship feels woefully
underdeveloped.
"A.C.O.D." doesn't neces-
sarily come across as cynical
on the subject of love; it just
never ceases treating it like a
farce. This wouldn't present a
problem if the jokes delivered
enough laughs, but the per-

formers struggle against the
limitations of the script here as
well. Genuinely humorous situ-
ations fill the plot, but none of
them manage to elicit anything
more than the lightest chuckle.
Focused mainly on the unique
details of several intricately
entwined relationships and the
unpredictable nature of love,
"A.C.O.D." resembles a less
amusing, less poignant version
of 2011's "Crazy, Stupid, Love."
The movie tries to legitimately
portray the effects of divorce on
adult life, perhaps even hoping
to help people in similar circum-
stances as Dr. Judith suggests
her research will. However, the
plot fails to offer compelling
insight or guidance. When the
credits roll, they frustrate audi-

ence expectations with a clever
ambiguity, but they also leave
many of the film's conflicts unre-
solved.
Carter's improved under-
standing of himself becomes
the storyline's primary resolu-
tion. Undermined by the farcical
treatment of the conflicts Carter
confronts, this personal real-
ization hardly carries enough
emotional weight to make an
impact. Perhaps for those audi-
ence members familiar with the
effects of divorce, this film will
hold more affectation and enter-
tainment. However, for most
audiences, "A.C.O.D." provides
a thoroughly mediocre experi-
ence, not witty enough to suc-
ceed as a comedy and not moving
enough to succeed as a romance.

TV REVdEW
'Styled' to unnderwhelm

EPIX original
documentary looks
at horror icons
By DREW MARON
Daily Arts Writer
This past month, Video-on-
Demand provider EPIX featured
their 2011 documentary "The
Nightmare Fac-
tory" in honor A-
of Halloween.
The film depicts The
the rise of KNB Nightmare
EFX as the pre- '
mier practical Factory
effects mae- Avaiable for
stros in televi-s
sion and film.
Their 'work EPIX
spans multiple
genres; how-
ever, their specialty is definitely
their work on cult favorites
like George A. Romero's "Liv-
ing Dead" saga and the films of
Quentin Tarantino. For those
who faint at blood or avoid horror
at all costs, you probably won't
enjoy "The Nightmare Factory."
As for hardcore fans who binge-
watch old horror movies this
movie might as well be nirvana.
The documentary focuses
on KNB founders Greg Nico-

tero, Howard Berger and Rob-
ert Kurtzman as they pursue
their dreams of making mov-
ies, monsters, zombies and gore.
They sport '80s rock hair and
work long, demanding hours all
for "the love of the movies," as
Berger puts it. It's a film geek's
paradise and atruly inspirational
story for anyone interested in
joining the industry.
The movie's an original pro-
duction from EPIX, and it's
nice seeing EPIX pursue con-
tent like "The Nightmare Fac-
tory" instead of just competing
with Netflix. "Factory" itself is
a fantastic expose on an art form
largely ignored by the public,
which is a shame because Nico-
tero and his colleagues embody
the words "master craftsmen" -
their work provides an Authentic-
ity seldom seen in today's world
of CGI blockbusters.
After re-watching "Evil Dead
II" and "Land of The Dead," both
worked on by KNB, I'm reminded
of something horror is slowly los-
ing: the terror of reality. To me,
that's what makes Greg Nicotero
invaluable. His creations look
so real yet stem from the illu-
sory wonderment of cinenia in a
way that is both bloodcurdlingly
scary and oddly statuesque.
Think Michelangelo's David, but
covered in blood and guts.

The documentary includes
interviews with filmmakers
Quentin Tarantino, George A.
Romero, Frank Darabont, Robert
Rodriguez and John Carpenter,
among others. There are also
several behind-the-scenes clips,
including Sam Raimi's "Evil
Dead II" and Robert Rodriguez's
"From Dusk Till Dawn." Addi-
tional cameos are supplied by Eli-
jah Wood ("Sin City") and Simon
Pegg ("Star Trek"). If that lineup
doesn't fill you with nerdish glee,
this movie might not be for you.
It's understandable that a great
majority of film-watchers don't
really care ifa movie has practi-
cal or digital effects. In fact, for
a great many, the effects of '80s-
and '90s-genre pictures would
be considered campy or obsolete.
"Factory" definitely touches on
this through revelations of how
bad the studio system has got-
ten about the tiny details and the
bottom-line profit versus pure
love for movie-making.
Despite this bitterness, "The
Nightmare Factory" still suc-
ceeds as required viewing for
film buffs. It's a modern day Hol-
lywood success story, a tragic
bemoaning of the current state of
special effects and an unabashed
celebration of some of the most
influential figures in the indus-
try.

Five Things
We Learned
By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
1. Things haven't gotten better for the
offensive line.
They've. gotten worse. Blood ran
down Taylor Lewan's forehead as he
stepped to the press conference podium
after Michigan's 29-6 loss to Michigan
State on Saturday. The cut above his

brow opens upnearly every game. This
time, he didn't bother to wipe away the
blood.
His quarterback, after all, was in
worse condition. The Spartans' defense
battered redshirt junior quarterback
Devin Gardner all game, breaking
through a porous Michigan offensive
line that again couldn't protect the
passer or open holes for the running
game. He was pulled for Michigan's last
offensive series because he had already
taken enough abuse. Lewan said he felt
bad for him, that the line let him down.
The pummeling was so thorough
that Michigan State coach Mark Danto-

nio, in his postgame press conference,
felt the need to address the thought that
the Spartans' dominance was somehow
too mean. In a football game.
This is the current state of Michi-
gan's offensive line. The team rushed
for negative 48 yards, the lowest total
in 134 years of Michigan football. It
allowed seven sacks and seven more
quarterback hurries, crippling the
passing attack. The opposing coach had
to defend his players from accusations
of bullying.
"We're not trying to go out there and
bully anybody," Dantonio said after
the game. "We're not trying to do that.

They've got big guys too, OK?"
At the start 'of the year, the line
underperformed but ' still allowed'
Gardner enough time in the pocket in
wins over Central Michigan and Notre
Dame. Now, after four failed combina-
tions in the interior of the line, it looks
as bad as ever.
2..Michigan is not a power team.
Michigan State is a power team. That
is the team Michigan wants to be. That
is not the team Michigan is.
The negative 48 rushing yards says
it all, really. But there was physical

dominance on both sides, of the ball.
The Spartans' offense didn't perform
particularly well. Had it capitalized on
its field-position advantage, the score
would've been even more lopsided.
But the offense wore down Michi-
gan's defense late in the game after
rushing 39 times for 142 yards. Those
aren't world-beating numbers, but this
was a classic.Big Ten game plan. Michi-
gan wants to be more than that - more
dynamic and explosive - but first, it
wants to execute the downhill running
game. It wants to control the line of
scrimmage on both sides of the ball. It

com, a differ-
ence of a yard
of starting
field position
amounts to an MATT
advantage of SLOVIN
.06 points per
drive.
This seems negligible, at least
before considering the massive
advantage Michigan State held
over Michigan in field position Sat-

urday, and how that helped trans-
late into a 29-6 Spartans victory
that was close for all of a half.
The Wolverines' drives began,
on average, at their own 24-yard
line.That lent zero favors to an
offense facing its toughest task of
the season in what is likely Michi-
gan State defensive mastermind
Pat Narduzzi's strongest unit in his
time in East Lansing.
To make Saturday's game com-
petitive - and make no mistake,
the Spartans' biggest win over
the Wolverines since 1967 was
nowhere near competitive - Mich-
igan probably would've needed to

By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Editor
EAST LANSING - Michi-
gan State has a great defense,
the Michigan football team's
offensive line is inexperienced,
and Michigan was playing in a
hostile road environment. All
of those things are true.
But it's easy for the excuses
to pile up, to make the number
"-48" seem unimportant and to
blame sacks and a missed snap
for that atrocious number.
The bottom line is that no
team in the 134 year history
of Michigan football has ever
run for fewer yards than the
Wolverines did on Saturday in
a 29-6 loss to Michigan State.
The next closest Michigan
team to rush for that many
negative yards (48) was the

1962 squad, which ran for -46
against Minnesota. That team
went 2-7, was outscored 214-70
on the year and finished dead
last in the Big Ten.
This 2013 team was still
very much alive in the Big Ten
title race before Saturday's
debacle began.
Now, a game later, the Wol-
verines have muffed them-
selves out of contentionwhile
putting themselves in the
record book in the worst pos-
sible way.
"It's a matter of straining for
that extra half-second," said
fifth-year senior left tackle
Taylor Lewan. "There were a
couple runs where (fifth-year
senior running back Fitzgerald
Toussaint) really could have
broke out, but we just needed
to straighten that much more

on blocks. These guys will get
it, they will, but this is going to
sting for a bit."
Through all the switches
and substitutions, the offen-
sive line has been criticized all
season, particularly, the three
interior lineman. Saturday
saw another starting unit, the
fourth different starting offen-
sive line in as many games, get
beaten up the middle.
Redshirt sophomore Gra-
ham Glasgow remained at cen-
ter after a mid-season move
from guard. Freshman Kyle
Bosch made his first career
start at left guard. Redshirt
freshman Erik Magnuson
made his second at right guard.
Evaluation will have to wait,
though, because of the beating
the entire unit took. It's hard
to single out players when a

whole line struggles.
"It's not just those guys,"
Lewan said. "Absolutely not.
This is a team effort, but a lot
of it falls on the offensive line.
It's not just those three guys."
Part of the reason for the
new record-setting number
was the number of sacks red-
shirt junior quarterback Devin
Gardner took - seven.
That bumped the total, as
did a high snap that moved
Michigan's offense back 20
yards.
Still, a dominant - or even
average - running game
would have pushed Michigan
past that 1962 team. Toussaint
had another underwhelming
game, finishing with 20 yards
on eight attempts.

Time to re-examine Brady Hoke

word in case things
get too rough and as his secu-

in case things
get too scary,
needs tobe
retired.
Every time

this Michigan EVERETT
football team COOK
- and recent-
ly, that's been
fairly often
- Hoke blames "execution." The
reason why Michigan was domi-
nated in every aspect in Satur-
day's 29-6 loss to Michigan State
on Saturday? A lack of execution,
says Hoke.
Putting the blame on executing
the existing gameplan means put-
ting the blame on the players and
not on the coaching staff. This
matters because, yes, there were
execution issues, but that was not
the biggest problem.'
Hoke had two weeks to prepare
his team for Michigan State, and
offensive coordinator Al Borges
had two weeks to come up with
a plan that made sure redshirt
junior quarterback Devin Gard-
ner didn'tgettrampled.
Gardner was sacked seven
times. Michigan's offense did
absolutely nothing. And after
the game, both fifth-year senior
offensive tackle Taylor Lewan
and redshirt junior linebacker
Jake Ryan blamed intensity for
the loss.
"I think it's who is tougher,
that's what it comes down to,"
Ryan said. "We played a tough
game, but it came down to who
wanted it more and who played
their technique better. That's
something we definitely, definite-
ly need to improve on these weeks
coming up.

Michigan State offense that has
struggled to put up points against
teams like Western Michigan and
Purdue.
His teams have gone 4-8 on the
road while statistically getting
worse every year in his three sea-
sons as head coach.
The reality is that Hoke's best
season came in 2011, his first
year, when he was coaching
Rich Rodriguez's players. That
was also the onlytime in Hoke's
tenure that Michigan has won a
game as an underdog: the second
game of the season, against Notre

The Wolverines lost five games

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Offense leads 'M' in exhibition

ICE HOCKEY
Blue completes sweep to
spoil Pearson's return.

By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Writer
Friday night, the Michigan
women's basketball team took
the court for the first time this
season in the team's lone exhibi-
tion game. Playing Division II foe
Wayne State, the Wolverines got
to work early onthe offensive side
of the ball.
Michigan had no problems
brushing off the offseason rust by
scoring on its first six possessions
and never looking back, holding
on for a 81-55 win.
After leading 21-4 early, the
offense stayed hot throughout
the first half, leading by as many
as 25. The Wolverines went into
halftime shooting 56.4 percent
from the field. But coming out of
the locker room for the second
half, Michigan looked sluggish
and tired, letting the Warriors
cut into the lead - the Wolverines
only outscored Wayne State by

four in the second half.
With a significant part of last
season's squad gone, sophomore
guard Madison Ristovski and
junior forward Nicole Elmblad
jumped into the spotlight as the
most experienced returning play-
ers.
While both rose to the occa-
sion, Ristovski was particularly
impressive early in her firstcareer
start, showing an aggressive,
offensive instinct she lacked last
season.
"It was an amazing feeling
having my name called out, first
time being out there at the begin-
ning of the game," Ristovski said.
"I definitely had butterflies going
through my stomach."
The sophomore attacked the
basket early and often and found
success with layups, long-range
jumpers and even from beyond
the arc for her first 3-pointer in
Crisler Center. Ristovski had 13
first-half points and finished the

game with 15 points, six rebounds
and four assists.
"I thought (Ristovski) did a
great job," said Michigan coach
Kim Barnes Arico. "One of the
things we were talking about was
her really being able to contribute
on the offensive end and knock
down some open shots. I thought
she really showed that tonight
and did a great job.
"I was really pleased with how
she played tonight, and hopefully
that gives her some confidence
because I know a big thing for
her is confidence. So I hope, after
tonight, she feels real good about
her performance."
Elmblad, the only returning
starter, added eight points and led
the team with 15 rebounds. Last
season, Elmblad brought a defen-
sive dimension the team desper-
ately needed, but this year Barnes
Arico needs her to play an offen-
sive role as well as be aggressive
on the boards.
As for the newer faces, junior
transfer guard Shannon Smith -
who Barnes Arico pointed to as
the team's biggest scoring threat
- showcased her shooting ability
and led the team in scoring with
22 points. Smith also added eight
rebounds.
"I was really proud of Shan-
non," Barnes Arico said. "She
knows it's an adjustment period
playing for a new coach."
Meanwhile, freshman guard
Siera Thompson also contributed
heavily despite finding herself in
early foul trouble. Thompson has
a firm hold on the starting point
guard position and showed her
flashy quickness early, ending the
game with 13 points and seven
assists.
Thompson kicked off the
team's offense, scoring the first of
Michigan's 21 points, which led to
a 21-4 run to open the game. But
after the Wolverines' fast start,
Michigan soon looked tired and
winded, forcing Barnes Arico to
turn to her bench.
"We ran out of gas a little bit,"
Barnes Arico said. "What we've
really been emphasizing is trying
to get stops on the defensive end,
and I think when we run out of
gas we slack on defense. "

The Huskies tallied a late goal

to limit their penalties. Forward
Dennis Rix slapped one past
Nagelvoort when he found the
puck near the slot. A late penal-
ty and a 6-on-4 advantage were
not enough to force a second
straight overtime, though.
The loss spoiled former
Michigan assistant coach and
current Michigan Tech coach

under Berenson, helping to lead
the Wolverines to 11 Frozen

kies came back from a two-goal
deficit.
Copp took the puck across
the center line before he wound

fired a shot that was too quick
for the glove of Copley.
Junior forward Phil Di
Giuseppe scored his third goal
of the season and added an
assist, while senior forward
Luke Moffatt tallied a goal of
his own. Nagelvoort, mean-
while, continued his strong per-
formance in Racine's absence,
stopping 34 shots.

Nebraska win
means Michigan
falls short of Big
Ten title
By JUSTIN MEYER
Daily Sports Writer
With the players' families sit-
ting in the stands after traveling
from all across North America
for senior night, no one would've
blamed the Michigan women's
soccer team for being a bit dis-
tracted.
But they weren't.
The eighth-ranked Wolver-
ines (9-1-1 Big Ten, 15-2-1 over-
all) took the field Saturday night
with a determination and drive
that has propelled them through
the regular season. At stake was
the senior class' first-ever vic-
tory against Ohio State (4-5-2,
10-6-3) and a program-record
eight-game win streak that
extended back to Sept. 29.
The unfazed Wolverines fin-
ished the game with a 2-0 win
and mounds of confidence as
they head toward the Big Ten
Tournament.
After walking onto the field
arm-in-arm with their fam-
ily members, all seven seniors
started for the Wolverines not
out of charity, but rather as a
testament to the strength and
commitment of the group.
"My whole class coming into
Michigan, we knew that it was
going to be a rebuilding year,"
said senior forward Shelby
Chambers-Garcia. "We were
our coach's first recruiting class
as a whole; (fifth-year senior
defender) Holly (Hein) was his
first recruit. We knew that we
were going to be starting some-
thing special here at Michigan.
Growing up together, training
together, building this program
together has been an amazing

a ball past the keeper for the
go-ahead goal in the second
half, her first of the season.
Senior forward Nkem Ezurike
undressed the Buckeyes'
defense before cutting back on
the goaltender and tucking the
ball inside the far post to give
the Wolverines the 2-0 advan-
tage and extend the Michigan
career goals record to 46.
Senior midfielders Tori
McCombs, Meghan Toohey
and Kayla Mannino all turned
in solid performances as well.
McCombs threatened to score
multiple times, including a
point-blank chance on a long
ball she blew past a defender to
reach.
Mannino and Toohey both
helped hold the defense togeth-
er, even as Ohio State brought
four attackers forward in the
second half. Mannino spent sig-
nificant time watching the Buck-
eyes' speedy Nichelle Prince on
the wing, and Toohey broke up
plays at midfield all game, frus-
trating Ohio State by forcing its
forwards wide and not allowing
plays to build up.
When the final whistle sound-
ed and the crowd stood cheer-
ing, the Wolverines finally let
themselves soak in the scene of
their final regular-season game.
"We're all emotional and
upset," Chambers-Garcia said,
gesturing at the stadium around
her. "I mean you look at this, and
this wasn't here when we got
recruited. We've been here since
the very beginning, and it's just
been an honor to represent the
block 'M' on this beautiful field
for this great university."
Fighting back tears, Cham-
bers-Garcia headed to the lock-
er room to celebrate the victory
with her family, but also with
her fellow seniors that have put
the Michigan women's soccer
team in the best position it has
ever been in to win a Big Ten
title.

Senior defenders Shelina Zadorsky and Holly Hein helped freshman goaltender Taylor Bucklinto a shutout Saturday.

experience."
Michigan coach Greg Ryan
said he was worried about how
his team would start the game
with all of the distractions, even
going so far as to make time
for a second warm-up after the
ceremonies. When the Wolver-
ines took the field against the
opponent that eliminated them
from the 2012 Big Ten Tourna-
ment, though, they looked every
bit the postseason contender
they've proved themselves to be

this last month.
Senior defenders Shelina
Zadorsky and Hein stonewalled
the Buckeyes to help give fresh-
man goaltender Taylor Bucklin
her ninth shutout of the season.
Ryan called the pair two of the
best center backs in the Big Ten,
and the cool and collected duo
displayed that on Saturday night
to back up their coach's praise.
"I think we had a solid defen-
sive day, but I also think we had
a lot of confidence going into

this game," Zadorsky said. "We
weren't cocky by any means, but
we were confident and I think
that was a different feeling for
me. In the past, we might have
been a little hesitant to play
Ohio State, but this year I think
we prepared so well and we
were excited."
Every member of the senior
class displayed that confidence
Friday as Michigan put on a
clinic at both ends of the field.

State dominated the line' of
scrimmage. Lewan said after
the game that the Spartans ran
similar blitzes to the ones they
ran two years ago. Michigan just

couldn't stop them.
"A lot of this game absolute-
ly falls on this offensive line,"
Lewan said. "They ran a bunch
of blitzes, a lot of the same exact
blitzes they ran in 2011, but when
it came down to it, we couldn't
pick it up. That's our job."
That might have been Lewan's

opinion, but it wasn't the opin-
ion of everyone.
"It's not just the line," said
Michigan coach Brady Hoke.
"There are backs involved, there
are routes involved, there's tim-
ing - all those issues are part of
it."
And maybe that's the biggest
issue. It would be easier to point
at one specific unit and place the
blame on them, but it's not that

easy.
Toussaint was blown up
repeatedly on blitz pickups,
which essentially erased Gard-
ner's safety net. Wide receivers
got no separation all night, while
Gardner held onto the ball for
too long and was hit on almost
every passing attempt. Part of
that is on offensive coordinator
Al Borges, but part of that is also
on Gardner.

You can blame it on the line,
or on Gardner, Toussaint, Borg-
es, Hoke - whomever. There are
many holes with many needed
solutions.
All that's important is that on
a night where Michigan could
have made a statement win, it
instead put up the worst rushing
performance in school history.
Sometimes, numbers say all that
needs to be said.

Buteven thatmight not have
been enough against the nation's
top-ranked defense. Follow-
ing an interception by junior
defensive back Raymon Taylor,
the Wolverines set up shop at
the Michigan State 41-yard line.
Though they trailed by 10 at the
time, which in this game felt
like a three-score deficit, the
tusnover could have changed
the game completely. Best-case
scenario, it results in a touch-
down and suddenly Michigan
is right back in the game. At the
very least, it should've ended in
a field goal, cutting it to a one-
possession game.
Instead, it became the worst-
case scenario. The Wolverines'
offense had been moving back-
ward all game, which left the
team shell-shocked after moving
the ball with hardly any resis-
tance against Indiana in its last
game. And even given a rare
short field, the trend continued.
Michigan State brought the
pressure on redshirt junior
quarterback Devin Gardner,
who had no place to go on an
option call to begin the drive
and lost five yards. Two plays
later, each resulting in one of
the Spartans' seven sacks on the
afternoon, the ball had moved
from the Michigan State 41 back
to Michigan's own 38.
Forget that outlier drive -
and Michigan offensive coor-
dinator Al Borges would surely
prefer that you do anyway - and
the Wolverines' average starting
field positionbecomes their own
18-yard line.
Now let's revisit the .06 points
per drive that teams sacrifice
with every yard of starting field
position lost. The Spartans
began their drives, on average, at
their own 35-yard line. For ref-
erence, in 2011, one of the years
of the aforementioned statistical

analysis, the biggest discrep-
ancy between a team's starting
position and its opponents was
15.9 yards, showing just how
big Saturday's field position dif-
ferential was. It's no coincidence
that NCAA-leading field position
team, Boise State, went 12-1 in
2011.
Ignoring the miserable drive
that netted negative 21yards,
Michigan State had a 17-yard
edge in the field-position battle.
According to the statistical
analysis, done by a better math
student than I, that difference
equates to an advantage of about
a point per drive. Each team held
the ball 13 times in Saturday's
game, suggesting that Michigan
cost itself about two touchdowns
with its field position.
Not all of the blame for that
falls on the Wolverines. On three
occasions, Spartan punter Mike
Sadler pinned Michigan inside
of its own 10-yard line. There's
nothing the Wolverines can do
about that, except be thankful
they only have to see Sadler one
more time before he graduates.
But on the nine other drives
that began inside the Michigan
35, the Wolverines shot them-
selves in the foot. Poor starting
field position meant little oppor-
tunity to move the ball on likely
the best defense they'll face all
year. Drives were killed before
they truly began.
After the game, the Spartan
Stadium scoreboard told you
that 13 points wouldn't have
made up for what Michigan
coach Brady Hoke called alack
of execution by his team. The
Wolverines didn't lose this game
because of the field-position
battle alone.
But any time a math whiz tells
you you're spotting the other
team 13 points worth of field
position, don't feel good about
your chances.

FIVE
From Pagei1B.
wants Michigan State's physical-
ity.
After the game, Michigan
coach Brady Hoke said the Spar-
tans outplayed his team, but he
doesn't see a difference in the pro-
grams. -
"I don't think there is a gap," he
said. "I think they played awfully
well, executed awfully well.I
don't think we did."
But Michigan State was the
better team. And it is the team
Michigan aspires to be.
3. Play calling wasn't the problem.
It may be a problem. But offen-
sive coordinator Al Surges's
hands were pretty well tied. Run-
ning the ball, clearly, was not an
option. And in the passing game,
for every two completions Gard-
ner had, he was sacked once. For
Borges, it was pick your poison.
Fourteen negative plays will
sabotage almost any game plan.
After 'the game, Hoke defended

the play calling.
"We wouldn't have run the
plays we ran if we weren't sat-
isfied," he said, adding: "Hind-
sight's always 20/20, right?"
But in' hindsight, what else
could Michigan have done? Short-
ened routes would've helped
Gardner get rid of the boll quick-
er, but that would've removed
any big-play threat and made life
easier on the Spartans' talented
secondary. The play action was
ineffective because Michigan
State didn't have to respect the
run, and it takes too long to devel-
op. But that wasn't close to the dif-
ference in the game.
Michigan has struggled to run
the ball with its tailbacks all sea-
son, so Borges largely avoided it.
Fifth-year senior running back
Fitzgerald Toussaint carried the
ball just eight times for 20 yards.
Plus, Michigan trailed for the
entire second half. Surges had few
other options aside from the pass.
Despite all the sacks, Gardner still
threw for 210 yards, a respectable
figure against a fearsome second-
ary.
This wasn't Surges at his best,

as he was against Indiana two
weeks ago. But the best play caller
in the world likely wouldn't have
avoided a loss to a superior Michi-
gao State team.
4. The secondary has sprung a
leak.
Michigan State quarterback
Connor Cook- is something less
than the world's best quarterback.
He had to beat out Andrew Max-
well for the starting position and
has been middling, though reli-
able, since.
Still, even Cook found room
in the Michigan secondary. His
14-yard touchdown pass to Ben-
nie Fowler - beating fifth-year
senior safety Thomas Gordon - at
the end of the half proved deci-
sive. He completed 18 of his 33
attempts foe 251 yards.
And he left many throws on the
field. Had Cook connected on the
missed opportunities - an easy
third-down completion over the
receiver's head, a would-be touch-
down pass just underthrown
- the score would've been even
more lopsided.

Overall, the Michigan defense-
limited the Spartans' production
for much of the day. The second-
ary, though, remains an issue.
S. Bold Prediction: B-Dubs Bound
Maybe this is wishful thinking
because wings are yummy and
Arizona is warm, but Michigan
will end up in the Buffalo Wild
Wings Bowl in Tempe, Arizona.
This is just speculation, of
course, but here's why it's likely:
the Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl
is slotted for the Big Ten's No.
S team. That's not concrete, but
that's a reasonable projection for
Michigan this season.
To make the Capital One Bowl,
Michigan may need to win out, or
take three of its next four games.
The Outback Bowl could hesitate
to take the Wolverines for the sec-
ond year in a row. That leaves the
Gator Bowl and the Buffalo Wild
Wings Bowl. The Wolverines0
haven't played a bowl in Arizona
since the 1986 Fiesta Bowl, and
the Tempe-basedhbowl committee
would likely push hard for them.
Wings for everyone!
