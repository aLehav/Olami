Jeremy Bassis, an assistant 

professor of Climate and Space 
Sciences 
and 
Engineering 

currently 
on 
sabbatical 
in 

San Francisco, says he was 
introduced to glaciology, the 
focus of his research, by several 
happy accidents.

As an undergraduate studying 

physics at Pennsylvania State 
University, he says he discovered 
climate 
and 
environmental 

research by walking into the 
wrong classroom.

“Penn State is a big campus, 

kind 
of 
like 
University 
of 

Michigan; it’s kind of spread 
out,” Bassis said. “The first day 
of class, I was late for my class, 
and I rushed in at the last minute. 
And one of the few seats available 
(in the classroom) was right at 
the front kind of in the middle. 
I kind of slinked into that seat 
and slouched down a little bit. 
Five or 10 minutes into the class, 
I realized it was not the class I 
intended to take.”

Bassis says the subject of the 

class, weather and meteorology, 
was not something he had 
thought of before as a point of 
interest. He approached the 
professor to ask about research 

opportunities 
on 
campus 
in 

relation to the subject, which he 
later became involved in. 

Bassis’s 
research 
as 
an 

undergrad led to his research 
as a graduate student at Scripps 

Institution 
of 
Oceanography 

as part of the University of 
California-San 
Diego. 
When 

Bassis 
arrived 
on 
campus, 

however, the professor under 
which Bassis wished to study 

was on sabbatical. In order to 
keep himself busy, Bassis began 
to look for a research project 
and was offered a research trip 
to Antarctica to study glaciers, 

Students were reminded of 

their rights on Saturday in the 
School of Social Work Building 
was centered around personal 
civil liberties and issues such as 
rights for protestors, self-care and 
bystander intervention for sexual 
assault. 

“Know 
Our 
Rights” 
was 

born out of an idea pioneered by 
seven LSA students, who each 
met with lawyers, professors 
and community members over 
the course of several weeks to 
figure out what they, as students, 
could do to make an impact at the 
University of Michigan. 

LSA senior ’Dolapo Adeniji, 

one of the original organizers, 

said the community emphasis 
surrounding the event was core 
to the mission of the organizers — 
the education and empowerment 
of others in an uncertain political 
environment.

“It started as Know Your 

Rights, but the more we talked 
about it, we wanted it to be Know 
Our Rights because it’s very 
important that it is a community 
type of thing going on here,” 
Adeniji said. “It’s not only about 
me knowing how to assert my 
rights, but knowing how to assert 
the rights of others.”

Students from all 19 colleges 

at the University and Ann Arbor 
community members were in 
attendance. LSA sophomore Will 
Krause said he attended because 

Despite 
being 
outsiders 
to 

Central 
Student 
Government, 

LSA juniors Evan Rosen and Dan 
Sweeney are ready to make waves 
on the University of Michigan 
campus as elected leaders. Rosen 
and Sweeney are running for 
president 
and 
vice 
president, 

respectively, with Movement Party. 

Rosen said he decided to run 

in order to create a more united 
campus.

“We’re very excited about trying 

to effect positive change on this 
campus,” Rosen said. “We have a 
very detailed and diverse platform 
that we’re excited to talk about and 
a lot of people behind us who are 
trying to make it happen.”

Freedom House is the only 

organization in the United States 
that provides shelter, legal aid and 
other 
comprehensive 
services 

free of charge to asylum-seekers 
and victims of human trafficking, 

according to TJ Rogers, the Detroit 
branch’s program manager. The 
Detroit branch of the organization 
was founded in 1983 with the 
growing community of Salvadoran 
asylum-seekers 
escaping 

persecution during the country’s 
war.

Asylum-seekers are individuals 

who are awaiting decisions on 

international protections from a 
foreign country, while potentially 
recovering from fear of persecution 
based on discrimination such as 
political thought, religion, race or 
sexual orientation. Refugees — 
Rogers calls the label essentially an 
umbrella term — are people who 
fled a country due to persecution. 
Upon entering the country, their 

applications are considered to be 
successful, while asylum-seekers 
are still waiting on a response and 
working with organizations such 
as Freedom House in order to have 
shelter in the meantime.

To some, making the decision 

to run for a Central Student 
Government office without any 
prior experience within University 
of Michigan student governments 
and without a campaign plan may 
seem like a pretty big leap. But for 
Engineering 
sophomores 
Alec 

Beljanski and Nathan Minsk, this 
sort of feat is something they look 
forward to.

Beljanski, running for CSG

Better Than The Rest Party, a

Emotions ran high Saturday 

night among the University of 

Michigan’s fraternities. Cheers 

were shouted, blood was spilled and 

rivalries were ignited — all before the 

night’s festivities even began. 

The inaugural Greek Fight 

Night, organized by the University of 

Michigan Boxing Club and sponsored 

by TITLE Boxing Club Ann Arbor, 

was held at the Intramural Sports 

Building, and aimed to raise money 

for charity. Thirteen social and 

professional fraternities participated, 

each using the event to fundraise for a 

different organization.

Twenty-one fights were held 

over the course of the night. Though 

most of the participants were male, 

the event began with three fights 

between women on the club boxing 

teams from the University of Illinois 

and the University of Michigan. The 

next 18 fights were between two men 

from different fraternities, although 

some members of the boxing team 

also participated.

According to a comment on 

the event’s Facebook page, several 

sororities denied invitations to 

participate, but the University of 

Michigan Boxing Club does hope to 

have sororities participate next year.

“Unfortunately, after reaching 

out to several sorority boards, many 

declined the offer to participate!” 

University of Michigan Boxing Club 

wrote. “We hope to include sorority 

fights for our second annual!”

Although all fraternity members 

were amateur boxers, the men spent 

two and a half months training before 

the event with the Boxing Club. Each 

match was a sanctioned USA Boxing 

Bout, and officials from USA Boxing 

were there to moderate the fights.

“The guys have been training 

long and hard for the past month … 

each boxer is matched up by weight 

and experience level,” the Boxing 

Club wrote on its Facebook page. “It 

is a completely sanctioned event with 

USA Boxing officials there to look 

after the safety of the boxers.”

LSA sophomore Sam Finn, 

president of the Delta Sigma Phi 

fraternity, participated in the fight 

because it seemed like a good way 

to raise money for charity and have 

fun with the greater Greek life 

community.

“It definitely seemed like an 

opportunity to do one of the coolest 

things I’ve ever done,” Finn said. 

“And it wasn’t really nerve-wracking 

because the second you walk in, the 

only thing you’re focused on is the 

other person. But it’s definitely a 

really intense adrenaline rush.”

Finn’s fraternity was raising 

money for the American Red Cross, 

and while they don’t yet know how 

much money the event raised, he 

estimates over 500 tickets were 

sold. The ticket revenue will be split 

between the 13 different philanthropy 

organizations.

Finn said the night was an 

incredible experience.

“If they let me do it next year, I 

would 100 percent do it again,” he 

said.

student involvement in CSG, and 
ensuring the student body has the 
opportunity to unite to create a 
lasting impact.

When 
asked 
where 
the 

inspiration for the name came 
from, Rosen said there was a lot 
of symbolism behind it, drawing 
parallels to the force of a wave.

“We see Movement as another 

kind of term for change,” Rosen 
said. “We keep moving, keep 
changing — Michigan is an elite 
public university, does a lot of 
great things, but we feel like we 
can get even better, so we want 

to keep moving forward, and 
that’s where the movement comes 
from. Our logo is the wave emoji, 
and we’re big on that because we 
see the student body as coming 
together and forming instead of 
being individual water droplets — 
coming together to be a wave, an 
ocean.”

Business junior Ethan Lutz, 

campaign manager of Movement, 
reiterated that Movement’s focus 
is the student body, and the group 
was looking for ways to make CSG 
more accessible to the average 
University student.

“We’ve talked about how the 

school may be a little divided, 
and we want to bring the school 
together,” Lutz said. “One way 
we want to do that is through 

giving the students more of a 
voice; we want to have more 
transparent processes within 
the student government, more 
open 
forums, 
sending 
out 

more surveys to gauge student 
opinion.”

While most parties running 

for CSG have historically had 
members with robust student 
government experience at the 
University, Movement is unique 
in that most of its executive 
board members have not served 
in CSG. Rosen and Sweeney 
believe they will be able to relate 
to the student body and bring 
new ideas and initiatives to the 
table.

“We 
are 
very 
clearly 

outsiders,” Rosen said. “We’re 
not part of CSG, most of 
the people involved in our 
campaign are not with CSG and 
I think that results in a lot of 
new ideas and a lot of change … I 
think we bring new fresh ideas, 
and we’re going to reach more 
people by making it a more fun, 
creative campaign.”

Sweeney pointed out that 

their lack of CSG experience 
may 
be 
an 
advantage 
for 

the candidates, and that it’s 
important to their campaign 
that they address students 
who have felt estranged from 
student government, and reach 
out to students who may not 
be as politically active and 
engaged as others.

“One of the most exciting 

things each year, for me at least, 
is the CSG elections,” Sweeney 
said. “But what I sort of realize 
now is that each year it’s sort of 
the same process … the people 
that I know that are involved 
are the same people that have 
been involved every year. One 
thing that … is important and 
integral to our campaign, is 
focusing on how we can get 
other people involved who 
aren’t political activists or really 
up to date on the initiatives 
that are being passed — how 
can we make Central Student 
Government 
something 
the 

average Wolverine is going to 
be interested in, and feel like 
applies to them?”

specifically cracks in the ice, 
which led him to his current 
research today.

He says he did not anticipate the 

direction his study took him, as he 
originally had anticipated that, as 
a student of physics, he would “be 
playing with lasers in a basement 
somewhere.”

Bassis 
continued 
to 
study 

glaciers when he realized the 
research he was doing — on 
the ways global warming was 
affecting 
the 
ice 
sheets 
in 

Antarctica — would have a wide-

ranging impact.

“When I first started, we knew 

about global warming,” he said. 
“We were not quite sure how the 
ice sheets were going to respond. 
And the big debate was whether 
or not we should even be worried 
about the way in which the ice 
sheets were going to respond 
within the next century.”

Bassis studies the way in which 

glaciers calve, or break apart. 
Bassis’s research on the way 
ancient glaciers affect sea level 
change was recently published 
in the research journal Nature 
Geoscience. Bassis worked on 
the study with Sierra Petersen, a 
University of Michigan’s National 
Science 
Foundation 
Ocean 

Sciences postdoctoral fellow.

Bassis said during the beginning 

of his career he “was at the right 
place at the right time.” Certain 
events, like the disintegration of a 
particular ice sheet in Greenland 
around 2002, triggered more 
investigation in his field.

His research, looking at the 

ways changes in glaciers affect the 
rise in sea levels and how glaciers 
are, in turn, affected by a changing 
climate, portrays a drastically 
different image of the originally 
predicted numbers for sea level 
change.

with CSG and those who are not. 

“I think that CSG does a lot 

of things, but those who are not 
involved in CSG are not so much 
interested,” Minsk said. “Very few 
things come across when they think 
of CSG. They probably think of the 
airBus, and then they probably also 
think of these diversity events and 
mental health events, those two 
specifically because we get a lot of 
emails about them.”

Knowing they serve as a party 

with independence in its own 

sense, their decision to run comes 
with the hope to represent students 
who also feel this separation from 
CSG, but as a result, the two expect 
to end up gaining more experience 
with CSG in the process.

“We 
wanted 
to 
see 
this 

experience, 
we 
wanted 
to 

especially since we have no 
experience,” Minsk said. “I feel like 
we’re kind of contrary to a lot of the 
culture of the CSG elections.”

When it comes to campaigning, 

the two will solely rely on the 
name of the party itself.

Specifically, their hope is when 

students scroll through CSG’s 
website and browse through the 
names of running parties, the 

name Better Than The Rest will 
stand apart from its opposing 
groups and will garner interest 
from potential voters.

In 
a 
discussion 
of 
these 

opposing groups, they stated 
they 
feel 
the 
eMerge 
and 

Movementparties 
bring 

essentially the same things to 
the table. On the contrary, they 
said Better Than The Rest looks 
to differentiate itself from these 
parties, though Beljanki and 
Minsk do agree with the policies 
put forward by other parties.

he was looking to be more informed 
given the increased amount of 
political activism following the 
inauguration of President Donald 
Trump.

“I want to learn a bit more 

knowledge about the rights of 
various people,” Krause said. “There 
are a lot of things like protestor 
rights that are very specific, and 
knowing more about that would be 
very cool.”

Another 
event 
attendee, 

Engineering 
sophomore 
Jovana 

Paripovic, 
echoed 
Krause’s 

sentiments 
regarding 
the 

importance of being knowledgable 
amid current political climate. 

“I feel like we should all come 

together because there are a lot of 
controversial things going on out 
there,” Paripovic said.

When asked about the racist 

and 
anti-Semitic 
and 
emails 

sent out to computer science and 
engineering students a few weeks 
ago, Paripovic noted she believes 
they 
failed 
to 
create 
racial 

division on campus.

“If anything, I think it really 

brought us closer together,” she 
said. Paripovic also said the 
positive response from students 

on campus made her think, “I am 
so lucky to be part of an inclusive 
community.”

During 
the 
event, 
the 

organizers 
announced 
the 

creation of the “I’ve Got Your 
Back” campaign — an initiative 
that aims to distribute pins with 
different messages to spread 
awareness about social justice 
issues and inform others they are 
allies.

“We wanted to do something 

that you couldn’t just wear and get 
away with not doing anything,” 
Adeniji explained.

University of Michigan’s Asylum 
Collaborative, many of the asylum-
seekers aided in Detroit are from

estimate of 90 percent coming

He 

explained that, unlike refugees, 
asylum-seekers are fleeing more 
isolated

than 
active 

conflict.

Because 
of 
the 
lack 
of

during this process, asylum-

cannot 
receive

funding from the government.

“Without

he explainined that getting an 
apartment after a stay at a shelter 
would be impossible without 
being granted asylum by the

“And 
emergency 

shelters typically have 90-day 
maximum length of stay.”

From the linens on the mattress 

to daily transportation to legal 
aid, Freedom House provides 
essentials and support for more 
than 45 people every day of 
the year, through cultural and 
linguistic barriers. According to 
the Freedom House website, in 
2015, the organization helped 144 
people, with 110 singles and 10 

families.

“The ultimate goal of the 

program is to help our residents 
secure legal status and to have 
the necessary skills, tips and tools 
to be independent and stable and 
self-sufficient when they exit our 
program and enter permanent 
housing,” Rogers said, adding the 
average length of stay is a year to 
a year and a half. The maximum 
length of stay is, however, two 
years.

The organization also has an 

attorney on site, but also has a 
partnership with the University 
and its immigration law clinic. 
Upon admission to the United 
States, individuals have a year 
to 
submit 
their 
applications 

for asylum. Working with the 
legal team, the seekers usually 
take six months to pull together 
an 
application 
of 
medical 

records, evidence of injuries and 
translation of documents.

Upon 
submitting 
the 

application, seekers then receive a 
receipt date with an alien number 
and are granted three months 
of residency from that date. 
Despite having a year for asylum 
status, the end of those three 
months can leave individuals as 
undocumented and at risk of being 
detained by immigration. Rogers 
said the receipt serves as proof 
of an individual seeking safety 
within the States. In six months 
from receipt date, one can apply 
for work authorization, leading 

to greater chances of financial 
independence.

“Without Freedom House, 

they would be bouncing around 
from 
emergency 
shelter 
to 

emergency 
shelter,” 
Rogers 

said. “Which increases their 
vulnerability, especially with 
this 
political 
climate 
and 

these executive orders. The 
vulnerability has the potential 
to interact and come across 
immigration 
officials 
and 

that would certainly result in 
detention and being deporting. 
And most likely, if you are 
deported, there is the case once 
you land back home, you are 
going to be killed.”

In fact, in all facets of Freedom 

House’s work, the organization 
has 
strong 
partnerships 

with 
other 
organizations 

throughout the state. From 
Gleaner’s 
Community 
Food 

Bank which provides meals and 
nutrition lessons to ProsperUS 
Detroit for entrepreneurship 
courses, 
Freedom 
House 

has a personalized schedule 
of workshops and classes to 
provide relief to its occupants.

Advanced French students 

at the University can volunteer 
at Freedom House with either 
as a tutoring resident or by 
translating documents for legal 
aid.

O

ver the last week, public 
criticism (via the news 
and social media) has 

been aimed at Students4Justice, 
an organization that has been 
fighting for racial justice on 
campus since September 2016. 
This criticism stemmed from 
an op-ed originally published 
in The Michigan Review, which 
was then picked up by The 
College Fix and the Daily Mail. 
The writers of these articles 
claimed that S4J’s demand for 
an activist center where students 
of color could do social justice 
work 
was 
segregationist, 
a 

complete 
mischaracterization 

of S4J’s demand and a cynical 
deployment of an ahistorical 
definition of segregation. This 
lead to online harassment of 
S4J in the form of misinformed 
critiques, racial slurs and threats. 
Rooted in gross misconceptions, 
such 
concern-trolling 
directs 

our attention away from the real 
question at hand: What will stop 
the consistent racist attacks and 
hostility toward people of color in 
our community?

One starting point is better 

contextualization 
of 
the 

environment in which the demand 
emerged. 
While 
the 
articles 

mentioned above de-emphasized 
incidents 
of 
racism 
against 

students of color, we want to 
clarify that racist violence has 
been a persistent presence on 
campus. The most recent rash of 
racist incidents began on Sept. 
26, 2016, when white supremacist 
fliers with anti-Black messaging 
were posted on campus. Over 
the next five months, a series 
of attacks was directed toward 
students of color. More racist 
and anti-LGBTQ+ fliers were 
posted, racist slurs were directed 
at Black prospective students 
on a student group chat, a man 
defiled a Muslim prayer rug 
in a reflection room and racist 
emails threatening Black and 
Jewish students were sent out to 
University listservs.

These incidents were only 

the most recent examples of 
overt racist attacks on a campus 
where 65 percent of incoming 
students is white, and classes 
take place in a building named 

after former University president 
and outspoken eugenicist C.C. 
Little. More recent articles about 
the S4J demands published in 
the Washington Post and The 
Detroit News offer more details 
about the racist incidents at the 
University of Michigan, Michigan 
State University and Wayne State 
University, further contextualizing 
how S4J’s demands arose.

A second important context is 

historical, since the demands made 
by S4J build on decades worth of 
organizing to end institutionalized 
and interpersonal racism at the 
University. Since the late 1960s, 
student movements such as the 
Black Action Movement 1, 2 and 
3, the United Coalition Against 
Racism, Being Black at Michigan 
which 
spawned 
the 
hashtag 

#BBUM and the United Coalition 
for Racial Justice have advanced 
demands for a more inclusive 
campus. Many of these movements 
have called for the University to 
create multicultural spaces that 
could foster racial solidarity. S4J’s 
demands are in the spirit of this 
tradition and struggle.

Characterizing 
S4J’s 
call 

for an organizing space as a 
return to “segregation” elides 
this local context and instead 
misappropriates 
a 
historical 

phenomenon for contemporary 
political means. Spaces that center 
around students of color are not 
the same as a “no-whites-allowed” 
space as the author of the article 
published in The College Fix stated 
or the “non-whites-only space” the 
author of The Daily Mail article 
erroneously claimed. Segregation 
was 
a 
legally 
sanctioned, 

institutionalized 
system 

historically enforced by violently 
policing Black, Brown, Asian and 
Indigenous people in the United 
States. It is not “segregation” for 
marginalized students to ask for 
a space in which they can build 
solidarity and participate in anti-
racist organizing.

Instead, this claim was used 

to 
harass 
student-organizers, 

harassment that included anti-
Black slurs, disparaging comments 
about the intelligence of students 
of color and calls for a return to 
segregation 
in 
the 
comments 

sections of The Michigan Daily, 

The College Fix and the Daily Mail 
articles. The proliferation of racist 
social media comments, in the 
hours after The College Fix and the 
Daily Mail articles were published, 
illustrates how mischaracterizing 
S4J’s demands contributed to an 
already toxic climate in which 
people felt, and continue to feel, 
comfortable 
advancing 
violent 

and racist threats. The University 
administration 
continues 

to 
respond 
to 
these 
threats 

inadequately, and as a result, 
students have expressed fears that 
their concerns will only be taken 
seriously after students of color are 
physically injured. At the heart of 
S4J’s demands was a call for the 
University to take concrete action 
against the widespread racism on 
campus. Now, more than ever, this 
call to action should be recognized.

These 
racist 
attacks 
and 

social media comments further 
demonstrate the need for a 
dedicated activist space where 
students of color can organize 
for racial justice on campus. 
S4J is one of the few groups at 
the University that is proposing 
concrete, actionable steps to end 
white supremacy and racism. 
The University has put forth the 
“Diversity, Equity and Inclusion” 
plan, an extensive conceptual 
strategy for resolving these issues, 
but it has done so without offering 
material strategies to ensure the 
plan’s successful implementation.

S4J’s list of demands precisely 

and powerfully proposes answers 
to the necessary question: What 
material structures and resources 
will allow the work of “Diversity, 
Equity and Inclusion” and the 
dismantling of white supremacy 
to be accomplished? Creating an 
activist center where students 
of color can build solidarity and 
engage in social justice organizing 
is an important step in working 
toward that goal. Those who value 
racial justice and equity should 
(re)consider the importance of 
S4J’s demands.

Though 
the 
University 

highlights a long list of past 
responses 
and 
actions 
it 

has taken to combat racist 
and 
discriminatory 
policies 

and incidents, it continues 
to 
ignore 
many 
current 

concerns. When speaking on 
the underlying problem of 
affordable housing for students 
of lower socioeconomic status, 
for example, the University 
points to lower rental rates in 
Ypsilanti instead of attempting 
to confront the high cost of 
living in Ann Arbor. This is 
especially disheartening when 
considering The New York 
Times’ 
The 
Upshot 
report 

on the University’s lack of 
socioeconomic 
diversity. 

Thus, 
while 
we 
commend 

the University for showing 
more thought about the issues 
marginalized 
groups 
face 

on 
campus, 
that 
response 

depended too heavily on past 
initiatives, 
avoiding 
issues 

clearly communicated to the 
administration by students. 
As a result, the University’s 
response veers from concrete 
goal-setting and instead relies 
on plans lacking in specificity.

Furthermore, one of S4J’s 

main requests was for a “space 
solely dedicated to community 
organizing and social justice 
work specifically for people 
of color,” and the University 
responded 
by 
saying 
that 

the Connector in the West 
Quad Residence Hall is a 
“currently identifiable cross-
cultural (space) on campus.” 
This 
response 
exemplifies 

a vague solution to a hyper-
specific request made by S4J. 
Ambiguous answers like these 

are scattered throughout the 
University’s 
response 
and 

do not address the specific 
concerns S4J outlined.

But 
even 
when 

comprehensively outlining the 
work that has already been 
done to appease prior demands 
from S4J and other student 
organizations, the University 
fails to adequately expand 
upon how its work can be built 
upon to continually improve 
diversity 
and 
inclusion 
on 

campus. S4J reiterates one 
#BBUM demand from 2013 
calling for a Race and Ethnicity 
Requirement that “should be 
required for all students at 
the University … and should 
be more selective.” Nearly four 
years later, only LSA students 
are required to take a course 
focused on race and ethnicity.

Nonetheless, the University 

response 
to 
this 
demand 

consists of referencing “Change 
it Up,” a program started in 
the fall of 2014, and involved 
little clarity for the future of 
the requirement. Goals with 
timelines and concrete ways 
of achieving them are needed 
to change the campus climate 
and take on issues of racism 
and discrimination. Instead 
of proposing programs and 
classes 
that 
students 
can 

partake 
in, 
the 
University 

should focus on implementing 
programs that encompass the 
entire University community. 
It was commendable that the 
University 
noted 
the 
new 

building 
renaming 
policy 

and a roundtable to discuss 
renaming 
the 
C.C. 
Little 

Building; however, more could 
be done to bridge the gap 

between administrators and 
other University members.

Furthermore, 
there 
is 
a 

notable lack of compassion in the 
University’s response. Instead 
of 
providing 
the 
initiatives 

of the past and avoiding the 
issues at hand, the University 
should have addressed what S4J 
asked for first and foremost: “to 
acknowledge (their) humanity.” 
In 
the 
entire 
document 

released by the University, we 
were hard-pressed to find an 
instance when the University 
recognized, on a basic level, 
how members of S4J, along with 
many other students, felt after 
these racist incidents. Though 
they address their concerns, the 
nature of the responses seemed 
removed from the empathy 
necessary for these students 
to feel their voices were heard. 
Instead of using vague language 
and taking a defensive tone, 
the University should employ 
a more empathetic tone for its 
marginalized students who face 
unique challenges every day.

Not 
only 
is 
it 
the 

responsibility of the University 
to respond to the fears and 
concerns of its students, but 
it is also their duty to address 
students with empathy and 
recognize the student body’s 
humanity 
and 
feelings. 

Additionally, as these bias 
incidents have shown, previous 
actions — that the University 
spent most of their response 
relaying — have not been 
enough. The University must 
recognize this and instead of 
simply digging into the past, 
think into the future and take 
concrete, actionable steps to 
change our campus climate.

W

e live in a dark, 
confusing 
and 

turbulent 
time. 

Many of my friends and I 
frequently 
struggle 

to 
maintain 
hope 

that 
this 
country 

can figure itself out 
with 
a 
president 

who won’t distance 
himself from white 
supremacists, 
with 

a 
climate 
change 

denier as the head of 
the 
Environmental 

Protection 
Agency 

and with a man who 
described slaves as immigrants 
leading 
the 
Department 
of 

Housing and Urban Development.

But on Tuesday, March 7, 

while listening to the remarks of 
the Wallenberg Medal winner, 
Bryan Stevenson, a civil rights 
lawyer and activist, I felt a bit 
more hopeful. Stevenson actually 
described hopelessness as the 
enemy of justice. We have no choice 
beside remaining hopeful, beside 
believing that change can happen. 
If we cannot find ways to change 
surrounding circumstances, why 
are we here?

I want to think about Stevenson’s 

ideas in the context of our campus, 
and try to imagine the possible 
outcomes if we collectively decided 
to take the steps he described. How 
might we imagine the ways acting 
out Stevenson’s positions would 
alter the campus experience, both 
inside and outside the classroom?

Stevenson began his lecture 

by discussing the need to get 
“proximate” to people and stories 
that are not familiar to us. He 
articulated that we must work 
directly with the poor, neglected, 
abused and incarcerated among 
us. And we ought to do this not 
because we, the more privileged 
members of society, have answers 
to bestow upon the marginalized; 
instead, we ought to approach 
these people with an open mind 
and an open heart, ready to learn 
from them.

Immediately, this aspect of 

Stevenson’s talk reminded me of 
a kind of community service. I 

think one way to imagine how this 
idea might impact the University 
of Michigan would be if students 
were required to engage with 

the larger Ann Arbor 
community 
in 
some 

collaborative 
effort. 

As students entering a 
novel situation, we could 
not adopt a position of 
superiority. We would be 
learning from and with 
people we would never 
otherwise encounter.

Imagine if this sort 

of community service 
became a pillar of the 

educational experience on this 
campus. It would force us to 
consider our standing in the world, 
to understand our privilege as 
college students, to work across 
difference with people in this 
community.

Another vital point Stevenson 

hit on was the idea that we, as 
Americans, need to increase the 
shame index in the United States. 
By this, Stevenson meant that we 
must willingly confront our past — 
Stevenson’s organization, the Equal 
Justice Initiative, is working on an 
ongoing project to post markers at 
every lynching site in the country. 
Stevenson pointed out that we are 
living in a post-genocidal state; 
this country was “founded” and 
cultivated 
through 
that 
cruel, 

massive genocide. In order to move 
forward, we must look back. 

Here, we can imagine the 

impact of the University fully 
reckoning with its past — instead 
of a slogan like “forever valiant” 
(which appears across campus on 
advertisements for the University’s 
bicentennial), which denies the 
fact, for example, that University 
President James Angell made 
integral contributions to the 1882 
Chinese Exclusion Act, or the fact 
that there is currently a significant 
swath of students who feel silenced 
and ignored on this campus. We 
are not always valiant. Nobody 
is. That is a ludicrous idea to even 
propose, nevertheless to identify 
with. It is not only meaningless; 
the act of willed ignorance, of not 
confronting a prejudiced past and 

a prejudiced present, is an act of 
extremely destructive violence. 

As Stevenson also noted, we 

must change the narratives that 
keep us from getting proximate, 
that keep us from engaging with 
people across difference. But the 
University, in fact, loves to promote 
certain narratives that have this 
precise effect: How are we, the 
students, meant to believe the 
administration is actually working 
to change itself and change this 
campus culture if it creates slogans 
like “forever valiant” to describe 
our school? That slogan promotes 
stasis, it promotes ignorance and 
it promotes a sense that we here 
at the University are — and have 
always been — egalitarian.

At one point in his lecture, 

Stevenson asked why we as a 
society have collectively agreed 
to silence, to jail and to kill the 
most broken among us. And I 
think this relates integrally to an 
unwillingness to confront our past. 
The mere fact that people in our 
society today can be made broken 
is a sign that our present moment 
maintains antecedents within the 
very outwardly and publicly evil 
past of slavery and segregation. 
Consequently, we silence them to 
keep them in their place, to assure 
they cannot remind a critical mass 
about the past from which we have 
all emerged.

Stevenson 
remarked 
that 

throughout his 30-year career 
defending people on death row, 
he has been made to feel “a little 
bit broken as well.” But, crucially, 
he noted that it is in a state of 
brokenness that we can recognize 
the power of what it means to be 
human. By confronting our broken 
past and working collaboratively 
with people made broken by our 
present, 
we 
will 
intrinsically 

become broken, ourselves.

And it is only once we do this, 

once we accept that collectively, we 
are and always have been broken, 
only then can we legitimately begin 
to heal and to move forward.

FROM THE DAILY

Bias incidents require empathy
A

s bias incidents continue to occur across campus, student organizations 
are pressing the University to reevaluate its responses to such incidents. 
In the wake of racist fliers that were posted in September 2016, racist 

and anti-Semitic emails sent out to engineering and computer science students 
and the defilement of a prayer rug in February, a University of Michigan student 
organization, Students4Justice, drafted a petition, organized multiple sit-ins 
and put forward a list of demands addressing the administration’s reactions 
to the racist incidents. Shortly thereafter, University administrators issued a 
formal response to each of the demands listed that included, for the most part, 
descriptions of procedures and programs already in place at the University. 
While The Michigan Daily Editorial Board appreciates the University’s prompt 
and specific response, we call on the University to issue more forward-thinking 
and empathetic responses that establish more concrete goals to combat many 
of the issues S4J outlined.

‘Kong’ is empty but pretty

“Kong: Skull Island” is a King 

Kong movie more or less inspired 
by “Apocalypse Now.” If that 
doesn’t catch your fancy, this 
probably isn’t the movie for you. 
This is a gleefully absurd monster 
flick drenched in Vietnam War-era 
pastiche, and it understands and 
embraces that identity to an insane 
degree. It’s certainly not perfect — 
in fact, there’s an argument to be 
had about whether 
or not it’s even good 
— but for what it is, 
it’s a rollicking good 
time.

Film 
fans 
will 

know that “Kong” 
takes place in the 
same universe as 
the 
most 
recent 

American iteration of “Godzilla” 
in 
preparation 
for 
the 
2020 

cinematic throw down between 
the two titanic monsters. To the 
film’s credit, it avoids the common 
pitfall of trying to build the entire 
universe in a single movie without 
telling 
a 
good, 
self-contained 

story (see: “Iron Man 2” and “The 
Amazing 
Spider-Man 
2”). 
To 

its discredit, it then goes about 
repeating “Godzilla” ’s gravest 
mistake: the complete misuse of its 
cast and characters.

“Kong” 
has 
an 
almost 

ludicrously 
accomplished 
cast, 

including Tom Hiddleston (“I Saw 
the Light”), Brie Larson (“Room”), 
John Goodman (“10 Cloverfield 
Lane”), 
Samuel 
L. 
Jackson 

(“Kingsman: The Secret Service”) 
and John C. Reilly (“The Lobster”), 
and with all this A-list, top-tier 
talent, only the latter two are ever 
given any weight. While the human 
characters won’t be the reason the 
vast majority of people see this 
movie, the sheer amount of screen 
time spent with them necessitates 
some sort of depth.

Jackson and Reilly are actually 

given solid characterization, and 
correspondingly, they are the 
highlights of the piece. Jackson 
portrays the thinly veiled Colonel 
Kurtz 
stand-in 
as 
primarily 

unhinged, 
but 
earlier 
scenes 

showing his inability to move past 
the ending of the Vietnam War 

make him more of an interesting 
and complex antagonist. Reilly, on 
the other hand, is the human heart 
and soul of the piece, and his ability 
to switch between touching drama 
and 
his 
trademark 
screwball 

comedy provides a memorable, 
eminently likable character.

Then we come to the Eighth 

Wonder of the World himself, 
King Kong, and here is where 
“Kong” truly delivers. Apparently 
acting on the complaints that the 
2014 rendition of Godzilla wasn’t 
given enough to do in his own 

movie, 
Kong 
is 

given a series of 
exhilarating action 
scenes, each one 
more rousing and 
exciting than the 
last. The sequence 
teased 
in 
the 

trailers 
where 

Kong 
fights 
off 

a small fleet of helicopters is an 
early highlight of the film and acts 
as a fabulous introduction to this 
new interpretation of the beloved 
character.

As good as these action beats 

are, the Kong-less ones that feature 
the human cast facing off against 
the Skull Island’s other monstrous 
inhabitants are even better. They 
would have undoubtedly been 
stronger had those characters 
been fleshed out, but as they stand 
now, they’re still great. Director 
Jordan Vogt-Roberts, previously 
best known for his excellent indie 
comedy “The Kings of Summer,” 
shows himself to be more than 
capable creating inventive, fast-
paced sequences that effortlessly 
hold his audience’s rapt attention, 
and together with cinematographer 
Larry Fong (“Super 8”), he creates 
some truly superb, brightly colored 
imagery that compliments the 
send-ups to ‘70s era film.

Even with all that in mind, 

it’s hard to overlook “Kong” ’s 
many problems, though. It has a 
remarkably skilled cast, yet does 
nothing with them. The jokes are 
welcome, but they often either 
don’t work or clash with the tone of 
what is supposed to be an intense 
scene. While Vogt-Roberts is adept 
at creating distinct action scenes, 
he seems to still struggle with 
balancing his ensemble and tone. 
It’s a wild ride from start to finish 

— there’s no mistake there — but 
these problems keep it from being 
the “Apocalypse Now” homage it 
clearly aspires to be.

Loss, as seen on television

When 
the 
Judd 
Apatow-

produced “Love” premiered on 
Netflix early last year, its premise 
was on the verge of sounding 
generic: A decidedly low-key sitcom 
with raunchy undertones about a 
restless white heterosexual couple 
in Los Angeles. We’ve already seen 
this kind of a rom-com plot with 
Apatow’s films “This is 40” and 
“Knocked Up.” However, instead of 
fulfilling the tropes of its executive 
producer or the clichés of its 
genre, “Love” ended up subverting 
expectations by taking a more 
realistic, humanistic approach to 
its subject matter, which explored 
modern 
relationships 
through 

the nerdy Gus (Paul Rust, “I 
Love You Beth Cooper”) and the 
rebellious Mickey (Gillian Jacobs, 
“Community”). It also became one 
of the most authentic depictions of 
L.A. on television — FX’s “You’re 
The Worst,” a similarly themed 
show, is a close second.

Now, in its second season, 

“Love” 
still 
embraces 
its 

awkward, cringeworthy humor 
and 
naturalistic 
dialogue, 

but it continues to develop its 
protagonists as nuanced characters 
by placing them in even weirder, 
funnier and more discomforting 
scenarios. 
Even 
though 
it 

fumbles a bit within the first 
two episodes, “Love” is keen on 
growing and maturing, effectively 
distinguishing itself among other 
new additions of Netflix rom-com 
shows — Joe Swanberg’s romance 
anthology 
“Easy” 
and 
Tom 

Edge’s inventive British sitcom 
“Lovesick.”

“On 
Lockdown,” 
the 
first 

episode of the new season, picks up 
where last season ended, with Gus 
and Mickey kissing at a gas station 
after Mickey reveals her intentions 

to quit dating for awhile. While the 
season finale may have had a bit of 
an on-the-nose rom-com ending, 
“On Lockdown” concerns itself 
more with the repercussions of 
Gus and Mickey’s pact to not have 
sex or date indefinitely.

As much as they liked to be 

apart, the two end up spending 
the entire night together due 
to 
a 
series 
of 
unfortunate 

circumstances. Mickey can’t stay at 
her house because her Australian 
roommate Bertie (the hysterical 
Claudia 
O’Herty, 

“Trainwreck”) 
is 

having 
sex 
with 

Gus’s friend Randy 
(Mike 
Mitchell, 

“Comedy 
Bang 

Bang”). Later, Gus 
and 
Mickey 
are 

stuck at Gus’s apartment complex, 
where the cops have confined 
the residents as they lead an 
investigation of a nearby loose 
criminal. This situation sounds 
like an overused rom-com trope at 
first, but thankfully, “Love” does 
what it does best by displaying Rust 
and Jacobs’ surprisingly strong 
chemistry and their witty banter in 
order to push the story along. After 
a hilariously bizarre sequence of 
Gus and Mickey’s attempt to escape 
the complex, the two still end up in 
bed together, but not in the way one 
would think. This scene contrasts 
greatly with the previous episode’s 
final moments with an anti-climax 
that will either anger or surprise 
fans, but nevertheless deliver on 
the promise that “Love” wants to 
give its characters room to evolve.

However, as seen in the next 

episode, “Friends Night Out,” 
Gus and Mickey are still stuck in 
personal gridlocks, engaged in a 
sexual and romantic tension that 
keeps viewers guessing if they 
can really stay off of each other. 
This episode, while funnier, more 
entertaining and revealing than the 

first one, still showcases “Love” ’s 
flaws when it puts Gus and Mickey 
in a very classic sitcom setup. After 
deciding to spend some time away 
from one another, they each hang 
out with their respective friend 
groups and immediately regret 
doing so when each situation 
reminds them of the trials and 
tribulations of being single.

Gus wants to hang out with 

his buds at a bar, but becomes 
unsettled when a group of women 
decide to join them; Mickey grows 

distressed as the 
seventh 
wheel 

to the group of 
married couples she 
eats dinner with. 
Considering 
how 

the characters have 
acted in previous 

episodes, it doesn’t come as surprise 
that Gus and Mickey are as great 
together as they are horrible people 
to everyone else. With his “asshole-
disguised-as-nice-guy” demeanor, 
a withdrawn Gus rebuffs Kali 
(Tipper Newton, “Southbound”), 
one of the women who joins his 
group, mistakenly believing she 
was flirting with him when she 
was just trying to be friendly. 
Seeing all the couples get along, a 
jealous, detached Mickey stirs up 
some drama when asking a dirty 
question of her own during a game 
of Table Topics. Both leave their 
respective parties in despair, but as 
expected, they come together for a 
dialogue-less final sequence, where 
Mickey breaks her abstinence and 
the two have car sex to the apt tune 
of the Avett Brothers’s “No Hard 
Feelings.” While it was nice to see 
Gus and Mickey back together, 
this ending might have been more 
rewarding had Gus and Mickey 
spent more than just one episode 
without being a romantic couple.

‘Love’ matures with plot

SAM ROSENBERG

Daily Arts Writer

Over spring break, my Grandpa 

died. I remember my eyes shooting 
open in the middle of the night, 
because I’d heard a sound: A single 
choked sob. My door was cracked 
open, and I saw that the lights 
were on downstairs — there was 
a faint buzzing of the TV in the 
background, and I heard my dad’s 
voice.

My first thought was that 

something terrible had happened 
between my mom and dad. Their 
marriage was falling apart. Maybe 
my dad had admitted to cheating 
on my mom, and she was crying 
and he was trying to calm her 
down. I had no particular reason to 
believe this, except that I couldn’t 
think of any other reason why 
they’d be talking in the basement 
at 4:00 in the morning, with my 
dad speaking and my mom crying. 
Unless someone died.

I heard Mom come upstairs and 

I knew I wouldn’t fall back asleep 
without knowing what was going 
on, so I went to her room, my heart 
pounding, dreading the worst. She 
looked at me, tears in her eyes, and 
said, “Your grandpa has passed 
away.” I felt guilty for how relieved 
I was. My parents were fine.

Four days later, we were on the 

road to Rochester, Minnesota, 
where the funeral would be held. 
Grandpa Chuck was my mom’s 
stepdad, and he’d been married 
before my Grandma Carol. He and 
his first wife had had three kids by 
the time my parents were born, 
and those kids had kids of their 
own, and some of those kids had 
kids of their own. Most of that side 
of the family lived in Minnesota, so 
I hadn’t met any of them in my life. 
This would be the first time I met 
them — all new uncles and aunts 
and cousins, or, I guess, step-uncles 
and step-aunts and step-cousins.

As we went to the viewing, and 

then the funeral, I observed the 
people around me. Uncle Matt, 
my mom’s brother, was quiet as 
usual, sometimes even indifferent-
looking, but once I thought I caught 
him dabbing his eyes with a tissue 
— or maybe I didn’t. Three of my 
new cousins all had the same basic 
characteristics, and I tried in vain 
to figure out which was which. My 
new uncle Steve, with the same 
white mustache and gravelly voice 
of my grandpa, stood over the 
coffin, crying as other men rubbed 

his shoulders consolingly. My other 
new uncle Tim stood solemnly to 
the side, more subdued. I thought 
he looked more like Grandpa, but 
everyone told me that I was wrong, 
that Steve was his spitting image.

Looking around at everything, 

I thought about how surreal it 
was. I’d never lost a close family 
member before; my closest loss was 
probably my first cat, or maybe my 
piano teacher. In any case, I’d never 
been to a funeral, never heard a 
family member’s eulogy, never 
heard “Amazing Grace” blaring 
from a set of bagpipes. I’d never 
heard a pastor explaining that that 
we could feel safe and comforted 
because our loved ones were in a 
glorious place with God now.

Scratch that: I’d heard all those 

things before, but only on TV. Being 
a person that takes in so much 
narrative means that I’ve always 

compared things to TV, but as I get 
older, it only increases. There have 
been so many times this year when 
something happened and I thought 
about how I’d only ever seen that 
thing on TV — seeing someone at 
a party doing a line of cocaine, or 
walking through the clinical, over-
lit white hallways of an emergency 
room, or stepping into a cabin in 
the middle of the woods.

I’d seen countless funerals on 

TV, but never in real life, and now it 
was all happening and it was real. 
That body in that coffin, which 
didn’t look like Grandpa at all, really 
was him. Old hymns reverberated 
throughout the chapel. The stained 
glass windows depicted warm 
chartreuse meadows and deep 
blue skies. I’m not religious, but as 
we stood and prayed, I felt that this 
was important.

Afterward we drove to the 

cemetery to bury him, and since he 
was a veteran, there were several 
men from the Army who shot 
rifles into the air. The sun was on 
my back but it was chilly outside, 
and as another veteran handed 
Grandma a folded up American 

flag and spoke softly to her, I 
couldn’t tell if the tears in my eyes 
were from sadness or the cold sting 
of the wind.

After it was all over we went to 

my new uncle Tim and my new 
aunt Paula’s house with the rest of 
my new family. We all drank and 
ate good food and watched the 
funny little kids be funny little kids. 
At the end of the night we went 
downstairs and Tim fired up a 
slide projector, and we all huddled 
around looking at old pictures of 
the family I never really knew. The 
lights were dim, and we were all 
laughing. Part of me felt like I was 
intruding on an intimate family 
moment, but I mostly felt happy 
that I was able to be here, finally 
getting to know these people I’d 
heard so much about from my 
grandparents. Even if they were 
this fully-formed family, we had 
Grandpa in common.

When I think of Grandpa 

Chuck, I think of his stories. I have 
so many memories of sitting across 
from him at the dining room table 
and hearing a story about fishing, 
or hunting, or his times in the army. 
On their own, many of the stories 
were pretty anticlimactic; they 
were small, subtle, often just about 
an amusing conversation Grandpa 
had or something he had to fix on 
his boat. But there was a quiet force 
to the way he spoke, something 
both engaging and calming, and 
no matter how the story ended, it 
always felt powerful and complete.

At the funeral, when Steve went 

up and told some last stories about 
Grandpa, I couldn’t help but think 
of how they really did look and 
sound alike. Steve had that same 
storytelling ability Grandpa had. 
As he spoke about his father, about 
how there was a warmth his gruff 
exterior couldn’t totally hide, I 
felt myself blinking away tears. 
Even if I didn’t believe in heaven 
or hell, this was an afterlife of its 
own: my mom, and my brother, 
and Grandma, and Steve, and Tim 
and all my new cousins and their 
children.

I watched a movie yesterday 

called “The Father of My Children,” 
by Mia Hansen-Løve. In the movie, 
a film producer dies, and his family 
is left to finish his films while they 
privately go through their own

The Wolverines earned a 

No. 7 seed in the NCAA 

Tournament and a Friday 

matchup against Oklahoma 

State in Indianapolis

A long time coming

Behind its seniors, Michigan 
finally finished the job 
and won its first Big Ten 
Tournament since the title 
that was vacated in 1998
» Page 2B

A little over a month ago, 

Michigan hit rock bottom.

The Wolverines had just lost 

to Big Ten bottom-dweller Ohio 
State, and looked completely 
shook while doing so.

But following the game, senior 

guard Derrick Walton Jr. stood in 
the corner of the Crisler Center 
pressroom looking as poised as 
ever.

He knew his team had just 

hit its lowest point, but realized 
things could only get better.

“If 
what 
we’re 

going 
through 

at this point 

spearheads a run and us taking 
the next step in some places we 
lagged in, then I’m all for it,” 
Walton said following the Ohio 
State loss. “I’m more so excited. I 
think it’ll make it a better story.”

And what a story it has 

become, as the Wolverines have 
done what looked impossible 
over a month ago and improbable 
just four days ago.

They’ve 
won 
a 
Big 
Ten 

championship.

There were a lot of questions 

asked of Michigan following 
that Ohio State loss. Could 
Walton and senior wing Zak 
Irvin 
put 
together 

complete 

performances in the same game? 
Could the Wolverines’ defense 
get out of the basement of almost 
every statistical category of the 
Big Ten? Did Michigan players 
overall 
have 

a 
winning 

mentality?

“The loss at 

home to Ohio 
State 
really 

opened 
our 

eyes,” 
Walton 

said on Sunday. 
“I 
think 
we 

played well but 
we 
just 
layed 

down and that was the biggest 
moment for us as a team. I knew 
after that very moment guys took 

it to heart, and really wanted to 

make the key adjustments to 
be successful for the rest of 
the season. We did that, and 
that’s why I was so confident 
going into the rest of the 
season.”

Over the past four days, 

the Wolverines have turned 

the weaknesses present against 

the Buckeyes into strengths. 
And that all culminated in 

Michigan’s 
title-winning 

71-56 
victory 
over 

Wisconsin.

The 
most 

suspect 
of 
all 

those 
questions 

was 
Michigan’s 

defense, 
but 

after watching 
today, 
one 

would 
never 

know 
the 

struggles the 
Wolverines 
once 
faced 

while 
defending.

Michigan opened the second 

half on an 11-2 run to get out 
to a 10-point lead. That stretch 
included 
a 
5:19 
Wisconsin 

scoring drought and denying the 

Badgers 
from 

getting 
points 

from the field 
for over eight 
minutes. 
The 

Wolverines also 
were struggling 
to find points 
as the second 
half 
wore 

on, 
but 
their 

defense helped 

Michigan maintain a comfortable 
lead over that period.

“Especially 
in 
the 
second 

half, we all came together and 
connected well on all cylinders on 
the defensive end,” said redshirt 
sophomore forward DJ Wilson. 
“Even when they brought 
in within six, we were 
able to get crucial 
stops and crucial 
rebounds. I think 
that’s really what 
sealed the deal.”

But if there was 

ever a team built to respond 
to those types of runs, it’s the 
Badgers. Guard Bronson Koenig 
and 
forward 
Ethan 
Happ 

combined to score Wisconsin’s 
last 12 points of the half, reducing 
the Wolverines’ lead to only one 
heading into intermission.

Again in the second half, the 

Badgers began chipping away 
at an 11-point Michigan lead 
slowly but with the sort of poise 
their core group of seniors have 
become known for over the past 
few seasons. The Badgers would 
get within six of the Wolverines, 
but Michigan had a response 

every time they were closing in.

Irvin 
and 
redshirt 
junior 

wing Duncan Robinson each 
hit 
massive 
three-pointers 

when Wisconsin looked like it 
had found the slightest bit of 
momentum to get on a run.

“I just feel lucky my teammates 

had that sort of confidence in 
me,” Robinson said. “I hadn’t 
really gotten any clean looks in 
the game. But to get that shot 
and knock it in was a special 
moment.”

When the Badgers put on a 

full-court press for the final 
three minutes of the game, 
Wilson found junior guard 
Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-

Rahkman for a slam that 
brought the fans at the 
Verizon Center to their 
feet and all but shut 
the door on Wisconsin. 

Wilson 
was 

essential 

in 
the 

Wolverines 
maintaining 
their 
lead 

down 
the 

stretch, 
scoring 
12 

of 
his 
17 

points 
in 

the second 
half, while 
shutting 
down 
a 

first team all-Big Ten player in 
Happ defensively too.

Walton 
and 
Irvin 
were 

Michigan’s primary drivers on 
both ends all game long. Irvin 
was efficient scoring points early 
on, mixing up cuts to the hoop 
through the Wisconsin defense 
and his signature mid-range 
jumper. He’s put together one of 
the most consistent runs of his 
career through the conference 
tournament, and finished Sunday 
with 15 points, seven rebounds 
and five assists.

But no performance could 

compare to what Walton was 

doing 
single-

handedly. The senior earned 
assists 
on 
the 
Wolverines’ 

first two scores of the half, 
and midway through the first, 
went on a personal 9-0 run, 
hitting three shots from beyond 
the arc on three consecutive 
possessions to give Michigan 
its initial 10-point lead.

Most importantly, Walton 

quarterbacked 
his 
offense 

through a tough stretch in 
the second half, and put the 
ball in his teammates’ hands. 
His 22 point, six rebound, 
seven assist outing will go 
down as the final jewel that 
helped him earn the crown 
of 
the 
tournament’s 
most 

outstanding player.

The 
Wolverines 
leave 

Washington as the Big Ten’s 

highest seeded team to win the 
conference tournament, and, 
most importantly to them, will 
be raising a banner at Crisler 
Center next fall. More than 
anything, they have a trophy 
with their names engraved in 
Michigan basketball lore for 
what they proved over the past 
five days.

“I wanted them to imagine 

what it would be like for them 
to walk into that beautiful 
William 
Davidson 
Player 

Development Center and see 
that trophy and tell people 
about not the four games, 
the five days, and be able to 
tell them that story,” said 
Michigan coach John Beilein. 
“Because that’s part of their 
legacy together, all 16 of those 
guys.”

‘M’ draws 
No. 7 seed 
in tourney

By making an unexpected 

run 
to 
win 
the 
Big 
Ten 

Tournament 
Championship, 

the Michigan men’s basketball 
team earned an automatic bid 
into the NCAA Tournament.

Sunday, the Wolverines (10-8 

Big Ten, 23-11 overall) received 
the No. 7 seed in the Midwest 
Region of the bracket. They 
will take on Oklahoma State 
(9-9 Big 12, 20-12 Overall) in 
Indianapolis on Friday.

The Cowboys finished their 

season with three consecutive 
losses, but won 10 of the 11 
games 
before 
that 
stretch 

to secure their spot in the 
tournament field. 

If Michigan beats Oklahoma 

State, it will likely take on 
Louisville, the No. 2 seed in the 
region.

Other notable teams in the 

Midwest Regional include No. 1 
seed Kansas, No. 3 seed Oregon, 
No. 4 seed Purdue and in-state 
rival Michigan State as the No. 
9 seed. The finals and semifinals 
for the Midwest Region will 
take place in Kansas City, Mo.

The Big Ten has seven teams 

playing in the tournament, 
with Maryland, Northwestern, 
Minnesota 
and 
Wisconsin 

earning spots in the field as well.

The Wolverines will take on 

the Cowboys at 12:15 p.m. on

Michigan follows Walton’s lead again
I

t started in East Lansing.

Before the confetti falling 

from the rafters, before the 

practice 
uniforms and 
before the 
plane accident 
on the runway 
at Willow Run 
Airport, the 
Wolverines 
had a date 
with the 
Spartans.

On Jan. 

29, Michigan entered the Breslin 
Center, and the final scoreline 
didn’t do the tale justice. 
Michigan was dominated, 
manhandled, embarrassed. Pick 
one, they all apply.

Or just take Duncan Robinson’s 

word for it.

“We went in there and kind of 

got punched in the mouth to be 
honest with you,” he said.

Fifteen Wolverines went down 

for the count. One swallowed his 
teeth and kept fighting.

You can probably guess who 

that is.

He’s the same guy who poured 

in a game-high 22 points, grabbed 
six rebounds and dished out 
seven assists to take a Big Ten 
Tournament championship 
trophy from Wisconsin on Sunday 
afternoon.

He’s the same guy who scored 

a career-high 29 while pitching in 
nine rebounds and five assists the 
day prior to get Michigan there in 
the first place.

He’s Derrick Walton Jr., the 

man who changed the course of 
the Wolverines’ season in the way 
he has always wanted to, but never 
realized he was.

Walton has never desired the 

role of the vocal leader. That 
spot had Zak Irvin’s name on 
it. For a while, that relationship 
functioned harmoniously. That is, 
until it didn’t.

Now, Walton doesn’t shy away 

from opening his mouth — far 
from it.

“Being emotional is fine, but 

just not bashing guys,” Walton 
said. “I know I get on Moe 
(Wagner) all the time. I just cuss 
him out for no reason.”

Still, his entire career he simply 

wanted his teammates to watch 
him and follow suit. No poetic 
pregame speeches, no bull****. Go 
out. Compete.

“That’s all I’ve been taught to 

do,” he said.

Little did he know it at the 

time, but he finally got his wish 
in East Lansing. He scored a 
game-high 24 points and took 
a beating doing so, going to the 
line 15 times and missing only 
once. And the Wolverines still 
lost.

The light bulbs didn’t just go 

on, Walton turned on a couple of 
floodlights.

“We were down probably 10 or 

11 and Derrick was just keeping 
us in the game,” Robinson said. 

“He hit a couple shots where 
he was really just doing it from 
playing hard.

“He was just making plays, 

and you could just tell by the way 
he was playing that he was doing 
everything he could, leaving 
everything out there just to 
make something happen, and I 
think everyone ... acknowledged, 
‘Look, if this guy just did this 
on his own, and kept us in that 
game, what can happen if we 
collectively all follow him and 
really all 16 of us do it every single 
day in practice and games?’ ”

What can happen? Michigan’s 

new trophy is the answer.

But it’s not just the tournament 

championship trophy, but how the 
Wolverines got it.

On Jan. 17, when Michigan 

faced the Badgers for the first 
time in Madison, the Wolverines 
surrendered a six-point lead 
with roughly six minutes left, as 
Bronson Koenig spearheaded a 
personal 10-0 run.

Plain and simple, Michigan 

couldn’t defend, so it couldn’t 
capture the upset.

With 6:19 left in Sunday’s 

championship game, Michigan 
found itself in an eerily similar 
situation. Michigan coach John 
Beilein called a timeout.

Behind a 3-pointer from Vitto 

Brown and a breakaway layup 
from Zak Showalter, the Badgers 
had cut the Wolverines’ 11-point 
lead to six in 30 seconds.

It was either buckle down or go 

home empty-handed.

Koenig went 0-for-7 in the half. 

Wisconsin made just three field 
goals in the final six minutes. The 
Wolverines could defend, and they 
captured a lot more than an upset.

After the game, redshirt 

sophomore forward DJ Wilson 
was asked if this team likes 
defending.

“I think we love it now,” he said.
Yeah, this is the same team that 

gave up over 80 points three times 
in its first five conference games.

But Walton’s performance in 

East Lansing changed that. 

“I think with the Michigan 

State game, at State, D-Walt really 
took over,” Wilson said. “And we 
look back at how many defensive 
lapses we had and how close we 
were to winning that game if we 
just had a few more stops down 
the stretch.

“I think that’s one (game) that 

everybody really bought in. From 
then on, it’s been working real 
good for us.”

Now, as the Wolverines 

prepare to face Oklahoma State 
— the No. 1 team in adjusted 
offensive efficiency and one of 
just four teams above Michigan 
in that category according to 
Ken Pomeroy — in the NCAA 
Tournament, much like Sunday 
afternoon, they are going to need 
to win a game with defense and a 
whole lot of heart.

Luckily for them, Walton 

supplied these 15 with that a long 
time ago.

Walton and Irvin come full circle

W

ASHINGTON — It was 
a moment that Derrick 
Walton Jr. and Zak 

Irvin had been 
anticipating 
for over three 
years.

Standing 

on the stage 
at midcourt 
of the Verizon 
Center, 
holding up 
the Big Ten 
Tournament 
trophy, they were finally in the 
place they’d been waiting most of 
their careers to be.

Three years ago, in 2014, the 

two then-freshmen were in the 
same position, celebrating at 
midcourt after the Michigan 
men’s basketball team won a Big 
Ten regular-season title.

That was their first time 

hanging a banner at Crisler 
Center.

Now, three years later, Walton 

and Irvin will come full circle 
and hang another one after 
beating Wisconsin in the Big Ten 
Tournament title game Sunday 
afternoon.

It was the culmination of four 

tough years that put both of them 
through quite a bit of adversity.

***

Irvin and Walton both came 

to Ann Arbor as highly touted 
recruits expected to continue 
the momentum set forth by the 
“Fresh Five” during their NCAA 
Tournament run in 2013.

Irvin was the No. 29 recruit 

in the country and Indiana’s Mr. 
Basketball. Walton was the No. 44 
recruit in the nation and a finalist 
for Michigan’s Mr. Basketball.

Together, many expected the 

duo to flourish from the start and 
keep Michigan at the top of the 
Big Ten for years.

And for a season, they did just 

that. Walton started as a freshman 
point guard while Irvin came 
off the bench as a shooter, a role 
similar to what junior forward 
Duncan Robinson plays now, as 
the Wolverines won the Big Ten 
regular-season title and made it 
to the Elite Eight of the NCAA 
Tournament.

But then things started to 

unravel. Three players — Nik 
Stauskas, Glenn Robinson III 
and Mitch McGary — left for the 
NBA, leaving behind a depleted 
Michigan roster to pick up the 
pieces.

Thrust into bigger roles on the 

team, Walton and Irvin couldn’t 
quite put the pieces together.

With future NBA Draft pick 

Caris LeVert out for most of the 
season, and Walton injured down 
the stretch, Irvin was forced 
to become Michigan’s primary 
scorer.

But Michigan coach John 

Beilein called the season a big year 
for the duo’s growth.

“Zak became a better player 

out of that,” Beilein said. “He 
really became a better player, and 
Derrick has a new appreciation for 
the game because he was out.”

It was a trying time for the two, 

but also an important period of 
growth: Irvin became a smarter 
basketball player, evident in his 
play in Washington this past 
weekend, while Walton looked 
a like a player possessed who 
appreciated the moment given to 
him this weekend.

After rough sophomore years, 

Walton and Irvin came back with 
a year of adversity under their belt. 
Once again, LeVert went down 
with an injury midway through 
the season, leaving Walton and 
Irvin again to pick up the pieces.

And for the most part, the duo 

did well. They both averaged 
about 12 points and led Michigan 
to an NCAA Tournament 
appearance before bowing out to 
Notre Dame in the second round.

But Beilein didn’t believe they 

were ready for the moment just 
yet. They got too complacent, 
happy to just make it back to the 
NCAA Tournament.

“The worst thing that happened 

to us last year was making the 
NCAA Tournament,” Beilein said. 
“We made it, and I don’t think it 
toughened us up enough.”

While their sophomore year 

was about developing their play, 
the duo’s junior year was all about 
developing their drive and desire.

Heading into their senior years, 

taking in all the lessons they’d 

learned so far, they were hungrier 
than ever.

“This past summer, I don’t 

think I’ve ever worked harder 
than I have in my entire life, and I 
wanted this so bad,” Walton said. 
“I just wanted everything that 
comes with winning so bad … and 
being able to come through for my 
team, that’s all I really care about.”

Beilein noticed it as well, citing 

that as the season progressed, he 
noticed Walton and Irvin taking 
the lesson they learned junior 
year about being complacent and 
took it upon themselves to make 
sure the team was ready for the 
postseason.

And, man, did they come to 

Washington prepared for the 
postseason.

***

One thing that has been 

consistent throughout Walton’s 
and Irvin’s four years at Michigan 
is the number of doubters that 
have come from outside of the 
team.

For Irvin, it was the thought 

that he had the affinity to take too 
many bad shots. And for Walton, 
the chirp was that he was too 
small to play point guard and he 
was too much of a passer.

It’s flak that they admit they 

look at, whether on social media 

or in the newspapers, but they’ve 
also gotten good at keeping it from 
affecting their play.

“Both of them have taken a 

lot of flak from a lot of different 
people,” said senior forward Sean 
Lonergan. “They just block it out 
better than just about anybody. 
They stay confident in themselves 
and this team, and they have guys 
who won’t let that waver.”

Added senior guard Andrew 

Dakich: “The thing that stands 
out to me is their mentality. 
They could probably fade away if 
things go wrong, but they’ve been 
consistent with the energy they’ve 
brought all year.”

And this week, the duo laid 

most of that criticism to bed, 
maybe for good, with their 
performances.

Walton and Irvin were 

both phenomenal leading the 
Wolverines through a grueling 
four games in four days that saw 
both of them come up big on 
numerous occasions.

The duo made clutch play 

after clutch play. Whether it was 
a dazzling assist, a crucial drive 
to the hoop or an important 
3-pointer, they did it all when 
their team needed them the most.

***

As roommates and best friends, 

Walton and Irvin talk often about 
the legacy they want to leave 
behind at Michigan.

With the duo leading the 

Wolverines to their first Big Ten 
Tournament title since 1998 (one 
that was later vacated), it’s already 
pretty clear. They’ve come full 
circle from making it to the title 
game their freshman year and 
getting blown out by Michigan 
State.

But if their junior year has 

taught them anything, they’re 
hungry for more.

The duo will get another 

chance to come full circle with 
the NCAA Tournament, when 
they travel to Indianapolis to take 
on Oklahoma State in the second 
round of the NCAA Tournament.

If Michigan fans remember 

correctly, Indianapolis is also 
where the Wolverines lost a 
heartbreaker to Kentucky on 
Aaron Harrison’s last-second 
triple in the Elite Eight in 2014.

Three years later, Walton 

and Irvin will travel back to 
Indianapolis for redemption.

And if this season has taught us 

anything, they’ll be ready for it.

Seniors Derrick Walton Jr. and Zak Irvin won their long-awaited Big Ten Tournament trophy Sunday in Washington.

Wolverines win thriller

WASHINGTON — With just 

over 12 minutes left to play in the 
first half, Michigan held a 25-11 
lead and sophomore forward 
Moritz Wagner was living it up on 
the Wolverines’ bench.

He sat grinning ear-to-ear, 

head reclined back looking at the 
jumbotron, raising his eyebrows at 
the pull-up jumper his point guard, 
Derrick Walton Jr., had just hit.

If only he knew what else was 

coming.

Though the Michigan men’s 

basketball team emerged with an 
84-77 victory against Minnesota 
(24-9), 
Saturday 
afternoon’s 

matchup at the Verizon Center 
turned out to be a second-half 
thriller in which Wagner and the 
Wolverines would need Walton 
more than ever.

“It was another day that, 

as a coaching staff, you had 
opportunities to really appreciate 
your team (like) many times 
during the year, and that was a 
great opportunity to sit back and 
watch them play ball again,” said 
Michigan coach John Beilein.

“… What I like best is they 

played connected again. It was 
just a gutty performance. When 
Minnesota made that run to come 
back, Derrick, Zak, put the team on 
their back and we got the W.”

With the victory, the Wolverines 

(23-11) advanced to the Big Ten 
Tournament championship game, 
where they will face No. 2 seed 
Wisconsin.

The first half was Wagner’s 

forum. Michigan’s big man went 
through a tough stretch to begin 
the 
conference 
tournament, 

scoring just 11 points on 3-for-
13 shooting. Only a day earlier, 
Beilein had said he didn’t like the 
way Wagner’s shot looked. But on 
Saturday, it sure looked pretty.

Wagner 
finally 
found 
his 

stroke against the fourth-seeded 

Golden Gophers and finished the 
frame with 14 points while going 
perfect from the floor and the 
charity stripe.

With Wagner as the headliner, 

Michigan’s offense shot 80 percent 
through the first five minutes to 
build a 21-9 lead from the get-
go. The Wolverines didn’t slow 
down either, finishing the stanza 
shooting 63.3 percent from the 
field en route to an 11-point lead at 
the break.

“They jumped out on us early,” 

said Minnesota guard Dupree 
McBrayer. 
“We 
was 
a 
little 

sluggish. We thought it would be 
handed to us. That’s it. We got to 
come out with more intensity.”

And yet, things weren’t all 

sunshine and rainbows. Wagner 
picked up his second foul with 
7:41 remaining, and with him on 
the bench for the remainder of 
the frame, the paint was open for 
the taking.

Twenty-six 
of 
Minnesota’s 

44 points came from down low, 
and they attempted just four 
3-pointers. For a brief period, it 

proved to be the recipe for success.

With 
7:18 
remaining, 
the 

Golden Gophers notched a 9-2 run 
to trim what was once a 16-point 
Michigan lead down to six. It 
didn’t last long, though.

Coming out of a timeout, the 

Wolverines went on a 10-5 run of 
their own to finish with an 11-point 
cushion at the break.

But that cushion vanished 

rather quickly. Minnesota opened 
the second half on fire, shooting 
8-for-14 from the floor — including 
three straight from beyond the arc 
that were interrupted only by a 
pair of Walton free throws.

The connections from deep 

locked the game at 55 with just 
over 13 minutes remaining, and 
concretely shifted the momentum 
in the Golden Gophers’ favor.

The Wolverines kept their head 

above water but things looked 
bleak when Wagner picked up 
his fourth foul with 9:44 to go. 
The Wolverines were hanging on 
by a thread, and Minnesota had 
planted its roots firmly in the paint 
— dominating Michigan for 14 of 

its 23 second-half points.

And yet, as the Golden Gophers 

mounted a comeback attempt 
that had all the steam to end 
Michigan’s miracle run, Walton 
took matters into his own hands. 
First he knocked down a mid-
range jumper. Then he buried 
two daggers from behind the arc 
to give Michigan a 72-63 lead it 
wouldn’t relinquish in the final 
five minutes of the game.

 “Like we said before the game, 

nobody cares that you were tough 
yesterday,” Walton said. “It’s all 
about what you do today. I took 
that approach. Helped my team 
win it whatever way I could.”

Walton finished with a career-

high 29 points, scoring or assisting 
on 18 of the Wolverines’ 20 points 
in the final seven minutes.

Wagner may have gotten the 

ball rolling, but Walton finished the 
job, and now Michigan has a shot 
at their first Big Ten Tournament 
title since the Wolverines’ 1998 
championship was vacated.

That’s 
certainly 
something 

Wagner can smile about.

Not a coincidence
W

ASHINGTON — 
After finishing 
practice in the dark 

on Wednesday, John Beilein 
gathered his 
team to tell a 
story.

The 

Michigan 
coach 
spoke of a 
team that 
entered its 
conference 
tournament 
as an 
eight-seed, in need of wins 
to strengthen its NCAA 
Tournament résumé.

It was a team full of 

experienced veterans and 
talented youth, who had hit 
a fair share of speed bumps 
throughout the regular season, 
but was poised to make a run 
in the postseason if they found 
their heads were in the right 
place.

There was adversity that 

had to be 
overcome. 
The team had 
issues with 
their flight 
the day before 
they were 
scheduled 
for an early 
afternoon tip-
off. But they 
persevered, 
easily 
winning 
their opening 
game despite the travel 
troubles the day before. The 
team then went on to beat the 
tournament’s No. 1 seed, and 
escape a close one against 
the four-seed to get into the 
conference championship.

No, John Beilein wasn’t 

predicting the future when he 
told this story Wednesday.

He already lived it.
Back in 2005, when he was 

coaching West Virginia, Beilein 
took a scrappy yet skilled 
bunch of country boys on an 
improbable run to the Big East 
Tournament championship 
game. It was one of, if not the 
most, memorable postseason 
runs Beilein had been on in his 
40-plus years of coaching.

Before that tournament, 

Beilein had little experience 
coaching on stages as big as 
the one he was on in Madison 
Square Garden that year. 
His team entered New York 
needing two wins to feel good 
of its chances of making the 
NCAA Tournament field.

While the run became 

one of the defining stretches 
of Beilein’s career, in the 
moment, every game was 
a learning experience. He 
noted how his Mountaineer 
team came together as one, 
developed a belief that 
anything was possible and 
learned to dream big while 
staying grounded enough to 
face the immediate challenge 
ahead.

That Big East Tournament 

came to shape Beilein’s 
identity as a coach.

And it’s apparent the lessons 

from it have made an impact 
on Beilein’s current group, as 
Michigan has fought its way 
into the Big Ten Tournament 
championship.

“At the time, we listened 

to him, but I didn’t really 
understand what he was 
trying to say,” said redshirt 
sophomore forward DJ 
Wilson. “I think it was fitting 
with everything that had 
happened over the past few 
days. It matches up to the story 
he told us.”

But the similarities don’t 

just stop at what’s happened 
the past four days — they 
extend to the future as well.

West Virginia faced an 

experienced Syracuse side two 
years removed from a national 
title game appearance in the 
conference championship 
game.

Fast-forward 12 years and 

once again Beilein will be 
matched up with a team that 
made a trip to the national 
championship two years ago in 
Wisconsin.

While this is where the 

story took a downturn in 
2005 — the Mountaineers 
lost by nine to the Orange — 

tomorrow, Beilein can write a 
different ending in this latest, 
almost identical saga.

Beilein has made seven 

NCAA Tournament 
appearances and a Final Four 
since then. He’s soaked up 
every one of his postseason 
runs and continues evolve his 
tournament coaching style 
with every additional game he 
takes in.

More than ever, Beilein 

realizes this time of year is 
a mental marathon. Rather 
than focusing on fixing the 
negatives, Beilein has built his 
most successful teams on their 
strengths.

“You have to always believe 

in your team, especially this 
time of year,” Beilein said. 
“Anything can happen. So 
when you’re with a team all 
year long, you have a tendency 
to think too much about their 
weaknesses and not their 
strengths. When you have 
strength of character like we 

have, and we 
have multi-
dimensional 
players, that 
can really 
serve you 
well here in 
March.”

Every 

game of 
Michigan’s 
Big Ten 
Tournament 
run has had 
a moment in 

which Beilein and his coaching 
staff has challenged their 
players to look inward for 
strength rather than outward 
at improving their weaknesses.

That began in the hotel 

in Ann Arbor following 
all of Wednesday’s plane 
drama, when Beilein realized 
basketball was the last thing 
his team should be focused 
on after all, and brought 
in counselors to help the 
players process the accident 
emotionally so their minds 
could be clear.

Before Purdue, Beilein let 

assistant coach Billy Donlon 
preach the simple, yet effective 
message of “not today” that 
resonated with the team as 
they came back and closed out 
the Boilermakers in overtime.

But most impressive of them 

all, with his team on the verge 
of breaking after allowing 
Minnesota to erase a 16-point 
deficit and tie the game at 55, 
Beilein called a timeout to get 
his players’ heads in the right 
place mentally.

“That timeout was nothing 

about basketball,” Beilein said. 
“We never bicker with each 
other. People were yelling at 
players for not boxing out. 
People were yelling for not 
defending. That timeout was 
like, ‘Hey, guys, I’m not going 
to yell at you here. Here’s 
why we win — because we’re 
connected. Let just get back 
together. We’re going to 
win this game if we just stay 
together and stop pointing 
fingers. Just go out and guard 
each other and let the talent 
you have come to work.’”

That timeout was the 

turning point for Michigan, 
as the Wolverines jumped 
back out to the lead after 
the timeout and never 
relinquished it from there.

Moments like that show 

how important the mental 
game is in college basketball’s 
postseason. That’s the 
lesson Beilein began to fully 
understand in 2005, and he has 
tried to prove his proficiency 
in the seasons that have 
followed.

On Sunday, Beilein will 

take the big stage again, 
with a chance to show how 
he’s mastered the mindset of 
March against a team that 
has shown it year after year in 
Wisconsin.

And if it’s the Wolverines 

who walk off the Verizon 
Center floor with the trophy, 
just remember: it’s more than 
a coincidence that Beilein 
had the chance to make sure 
history didn’t repeat itself 
twice.

Walton’s masterful seven minutes

WASHINGTON — A seven-

minute stretch to end the game 
defined 
everything 
Derrick 

Walton Jr. is to the Michigan 
men’s basketball team.

With the Wolverines up only 

one possession against Minnesota 
on Saturday at the Verizon Center 
in the Big Ten Tournament 
semifinals, 
the 
senior 
guard 

thought it was time to take matters 
into his own hands.

It started with 7:03 left, when 

Walton came off a screen from 
redshirt junior Mark Donnal and 
buried a jumper with a hand in 
his face.

From there, his best friend and 

roommate, senior wing Zak Irvin, 
knew Walton was in the zone.

“I’ve seen this so many times,” 

Irvin said. “It’s nothing new to me. 
I knew once he hit that pull up, I 
could tell in his eyes.”

The shot was the start of 

Walton’s seven-minute run, when 
he had a hand in 18 of Michigan’s 
final 20 points.

It was also succeeded by two 

dazzling 
3-pointers, 
both 
of 

which coming off screens when 
Minnesota switched a big man 
onto Walton, to give Michigan a 
nine-point cushion.

The 
big 
shots 
gave 
the 

Wolverines 
some 
breathing 

room after Minnesota came 
back from as much as 16 points 
down in the first half to tie the 
game with less than 10 minutes 
remaining in the game.

“He’s real clutch,” said redshirt 

sophomore forward DJ Wilson. 
“When (the shot) left his hand, I 
knew it was good.”

But with Minnesota guard Nate 

Mason putting on a show himself 
on the other side of the court, 
Walton wasn’t done.

Two possessions after Walton 

hit the trey to put Michigan up 
nine, coach John Beilein stayed 
seated as Walton dribbled the 
ball up the court, allowing the 
Detroit, Mich. native to run a 
play as he pleased.

Walton 
called 
a 
pick-and-

roll, drawing two defenders and 
leaving redshirt junior Mark 

Donnal wide open for a layup.

“He’s one of those guys that’s 

going to get his own points, but 
he’s also looking out for everybody 
else,” Donnal said. “He’s always 
looking out for his teammates. 
He’s always able to find the open 
guys. Since he’s able to score, it 
opens up everybody, and we have 
a lot of weapons that can put the 
ball in the basket when he throws 
them the ball.”

A minute and 40 seconds 

later, after Walton winded down 
the clock, drew a foul, and hit 
two free throws, he found a 
pass between two defenders 
to Wilson, who went up for a 
thunderous dunk to put the 
Wolverines back up by nine.

It was a pass that Beilein said 

the team had been trying to 
complete all season. Saturday 
night, Walton’s precision was on 
point, and it finally worked.

“That pass to DJ, we’ve been 

trying to get that all year long and 
then he was on it,” Beilein said. 
“That was a big basket.”

With Walton in the zone calling 

his own plays, it showed the 
amount of trust Beilein had in him 
to run the offense.

It’s trust that has taken a long 

time — four years to be exact —for 
Walton to earn. But now that he 
has it, Walton is running with it.

“(Walton and Beilein) have 

gotten to point where they have 
a lot of trust in each other, so 
sometimes (Beilein) will call a 
play, and Derrick will be like ‘No, 
no, I got something,’ ” said senior 
forward Sean Lonergan.

Added Walton: “(Beilein and I) 

have the same mindset, it’s just I 
get to see it from a different lens 
because I’m on the court. He trusts 
me completely, and I know for a 
fact that he has complete faith in 
me to make the right call.”

Even after Walton’s two assists, 

though, Minnesota kept attacking 
on the shoulders of Mason, 
dwindling Michigan’s lead to 
three with 49 seconds remaining 
in the game.

At that point, the Golden 

Gophers began to foul, and Walton 
was the one to go to the line.

Just 
two 
weeks 
prior 
in 

Minneapolis, 
Walton 
missed 

two crucial free throws with the 
Wolverines down two in overtime 
that ultimately led to a crushing 
83-78 loss.

While the circumstances were 

a bit different Saturday afternoon, 
the implications were just as big.

This time, though, Walton 

couldn’t miss, nailing both free 
throws as well as two more 16 
seconds later to ice the game and 
send Michigan to the Big Ten 
Tournament championship game.

All in all, Walton ended the 

seven-minute stretch with 10 
points, two assists and a rebound 
as well as a steal on Lynch to 
keep Minnesota at bay. Those 
final 
seven 
minutes 
capped 

a phenomenal 29-point, five-
rebound, nine-assist night. His 29 
points were a career high.

It was an outing that captured 

everything Walton does well 
for the Wolverines, and one 
that Wilson said afterward was 
a “first team All-Big Ten-type 
performance,” a direct knock to 
that fact that Mason had been 

given the honor over Walton.

“I’d very, very surprised if you 

found anyone in this locker room, 
maybe anyone in this conference, 
who doesn’t agree with that,” said 
junior guard Duncan Robinson 
when asked if Walton deserved to 
be on the first team All-Big Ten.

But Walton, being the reserved 

person that he is, didn’t want to 
get into that discussion after the 
game, citing that he only wants to 
be the best point guard on the floor 
every time he’s out there.

It’s a demeanor that he’s shown 

all season, and throughout the 
four years of his Michigan career 
off the court.

But with his tenure as a 

Wolverine starting to come to 
a close, Walton has shown — 
especially over the last half of the 
season — that his play is anything 
but reserved, citing his “alter ego” 
when he’s on the court.

And with a chance to add a 

banner to the rafters of Crisler 
Center, Walton’s “alter ego” might 
be just what it takes to get it.

QUARTERFINALS: NO. 8 MICHIGAN 74, NO. 1 PURDUE 70 (OT)

‘M’ upsets Boilermakers

WASHINGTON — Before the 

Michigan men’s basketball team 
went into overtime against No. 13 
Purdue, Zak Irvin had a message 
for his team.

The senior wing came into the 

huddle and screamed incessantly, 
“Not today, not today.”

It was the same message that 

assistant coach Billy Donlon 
wrote on the locker room wall 
before the game. The Wolverines 
had lost to the Boilermakers a year 
ago in the Big Ten Tournament, 
and “Not today” was a symbol of 
the fact that they didn’t want to 
run into the same fate again.

“They ended our Big Ten 

Tournament chances last year,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
John 

Beilein. “We had to make sure 
going forward that we came down 
(to the Big Ten Tournament) to 
win it. We didn’t come down 
here to try to make the NCAA 
Tournament, we came down here 
to win it.”

And in a game pundits called a 

matchup between the two hottest 
teams currently in the Big Ten 
— the teams were a combined 
16-4 in their last 10 games — it 
certainly lived up to its billing as 
Michigan prevailed, 74-70, in an 
overtime thriller at the Verizon 
Center on Friday afternoon.

After a wild ending to regulation 

that saw Irvin tie up the game 
with four seconds left in the game, 
he also provided the spark the 
Wolverines, scoring Michigan’s 
only two field goals in the extra 
period to push it to victory.

“(Zak’s bucket) was a big one,” 

said senior guard Derrick Walton 
Jr. “He got a great look and got two 
big buckets in a row. I just ran over 
and told him ‘I’m proud of you, 
you made a big play in one of the 
biggest moments of the season.’ ”

It was a quick turnaround for 

Michigan (10-8 Big Ten, 22-11 
overall), which had just beaten 
Illinois less than 24 hours prior. 
Many wondered if the Wolverines 
would have the legs to keep up 
with a physical Boilermaker team.

But Michigan came to play in a 

tight game in which there were 18 
lead changes.

“(We) just (had) a warrior 

mentality,” Irvin said. “Going into 
the game, not today, we didn’t 
want to go home. We wanted to be 
able to outlast Purdue’s toughness 
and how physical they are.”

After 
sophomore 
forward 

Moritz 
Wagner 
pummeled 

Purdue (14-4, 25-7) for 24 points 
in the two teams’ first matchup 
13 days ago, Purdue made it a 
priority to stop him.

And it was effective. Wagner 

struggled with the physicality 
of 
Purdue 
forwards 
Caleb 

Swanigan and Isaac Haas down 
low and played just four minutes 
in the first half due to foul 
trouble. Wagner didn’t score 
in the stanza and ended the 
game with just five points in 17 
minutes of action that didn’t see 
him touch the floor in overtime.

“(Purdue) started off switching 

on me,” Wagner said. “They 
cross matched. They put (Purdue 
forward Vince Edwards) on me 
and (Swanigan) on DJ.

“It’s not easy when they cross 

match because you have to get out 
of your normal offensive zone.”

But 
in 
Wagner’s 
scoring 

absence, 
redshirt 
sophomore 

forward DJ Wilson stepped up. 
The Sacramento, Calif. native 
scored 18 points on 8-for-11 
shooting in the first half, which 
included 10 straight points to take 
the lead back from Purdue as the 
first half wound down.

“That’s the beauty of sport,” 

Wagner said. “You don’t know 
who’s gonna go out that day. It’s just 
a very talented group, a group that 
is not only talented but also believes 

in themselves, (and) in each other. 
We all know what we got, and all 
we got is all we need. It’s a beautiful 
thing to be a part of.”

On the other side of the court, 

the duo of Swanigan and Haas 
were almost perfect for Purdue. 
The duo combined for 21 points on 
10-of-14 shooting in the first half.

But the second half was a 

different story as Wilson played 
exceptional defense on the duo 
to slow them down — holding 
Swanigan and Haas to just three 
and six points, respectively. 

It was just enough for Michigan 

to push the game to overtime, 
where the defense was even 
better, allowing only one field 
goal — a desperation 3-pointer by 
Purdue guard Ryan Cline with 
time running out.

It was the kind of defensive 

performance that Wagner had 
been waiting to see from his team, 
and he made his voice known after 
the game that he didn’t want to be 
labeled as an “offense-only team.”

“I’m a little bit tired of being 

that team that only wins when 
they hit big shots,” Wagner said. 
“It kind of bothers you as a player.”

Now, it’ll be another quick 

24-hour 
turnaround 
for 
the 

Wolverines, as they will play 
Minnesota on Saturday afternoon 
after the Golden Gophers beat 
Michigan State on Friday.

It’s a tough task for a group 

that has had a whirlwind of a 
48 hours. But at least for now, 
Michigan is just happy its Big Ten 
Tournament run wasn’t ended in 
the same fashion as last year.

Wilson shines in all phases

WASHINGTON 
— 
Billy 

Donlon is building a reputation for 
defacing walls.

It all started with one word — 

“streetfight” — scrawled across 
a wall in Michigan’s locker room 
before the Wolverines’ regular-
season rematch against Illinois on 
Jan. 21.

Thursday afternoon, before the 

Michigan men’s basketball team 
faced the top-seeded Boilermakers 
with a chance to advance to 
the semifinals of the Big Ten 
Tournament, its assistant coach’s 
antics came back in full force. This 
time, it was “Not today”, imprinted 
on a locker room wall at the 
Verizon Center in between a clock 
and a TV.

When Duncan Robinson saw it, 

he thought it meant the Wolverines 
weren’t going to let Purdue do 
what they wanted on offense. 
Sean Lonergan echoed Robinson’s 
statement, explaining the team 
screams “not today” when it is 
going through defensive slides.

Zak Irvin viewed it as a 

symbolic declaration Michigan 
wasn’t going home Thursday.

And DJ Wilson said it meant 

Purdue wasn’t going to knock 
the Wolverines out of the Big 
Ten Tournament for the second 
straight year. He sure as hell made 
sure of it.

The 
redshirt 
sophomore 

forward finished with a game-high 
26 points on 11-for-18 shooting, 
grabbed 
a 
team-high 
eight 

rebounds and pitched in three 
blocks to boot. More importantly, 
Wilson seemed to put his stamp on 
the game when Michigan needed 
him most, ultimately leading 
Michigan to its 74-70 overtime 
victory against No. 13 Purdue.

“He was hoopin’, he was 

absolutely hoopin,’ ” Lonergan 
said. “DJ’s — you’ve seen it 
before out of him — he’s a hell of a 
player. I think that’s what makes 
this team special. I think you’ve 
seen it … each and every one of 
them is capable of having a really 
big game.

“… I think that’s what makes 

us really hard to stop because 
you’ve got to play with five guys 
every single night who are capable 
of making big time plays. Today 
happened to be DJ’s day, he seized 
the moment and took care of 
business.”

And 
without 
him, 
the 

Wolverines would have been back 
in Ann Arbor by Thursday night.

With 4.2 seconds remaining in 

regulation, Michigan had knotted 
the game at 66 behind Irvin’s 
layup. Purdue was taking the ball 
out from underneath its basket. It 
felt like déjà vu all over again.

Just 
nine 
days 
prior, 
the 

Wolverines 
had 
traveled 
to 

Evanston only to have their 
hearts broken by Dererk Pardon’s 
buzzer-beating 
layup. 
Wilson 

was one of the men who had a 
chance to stop it, coming inches 
away from pinning Pardon’s shot 
to the backboard. Those inches 
became the difference between an 
opportunity in overtime and a long 
trip back to Ann Arbor.

So when Purdue managed to 

push the ball up the court and 
forward Vince Edwards caught 
the ball on the left wing and pulled 
up from beyond the arc, it felt like 
a cruel twist of fate was about to 

befall Michigan for the second 
time in just over a week.

But Wilson made sure that 

wasn’t going to happen, at least, not 
today. He managed to tip Edwards’ 
shot, notching his third block 
of the day and simultaneously 
giving the Wolverines an overtime 
period during which they would 
ultimately win the game. 

“It’s kind of a 50-50 play,” said 

senior forward Mark Donnal. 
“He’s got the length to be able 
to 
disrupt 
anybody’s 
shot. 

Fortunately, he was at the good 
end of it and he was able to tip it 
into the air and force overtime.”

Michigan would have never 

been in the situation of losing on a 
final shot if not for Wilson either.

Just over four minutes into the 

game, Michigan’s big man had 
already grabbed two of his final 
three offensive rebounds and 
finished the half with a game-high 
18 points. Ten of those 18 came 
during an unanswered scoring run 
with 4:18 left in the first half, prior 
to which Purdue was threatening 
to pull away and held a nine-point 
lead — its largest of the game.

With Wagner logging just four 

minutes in the first half due to foul 
trouble, Wilson’s effort kept the 

Wolverines far away from falling 
into what could have been an 
insurmountable hole — entering 
the break with a one-point lead.

Though Wilson scored just 

eight points in the second half, 
they all came at the right time 
for Michigan, as he was the only 
Wolverine — until Irvin’s game-
tying bucket — to score from 
the field in the final 7:21, and 
that doesn’t even account for his 
defensive 
performance. 
With 

Wagner’s foul trouble persisting in 
the second half, Wilson was left as 
the sole rim protector.

Though 
Purdue’s 
Caleb 

Swanigan 
and 
Isaac 
Haas 

combined for 30 points on 12-for-
23 shooting, Wilson helped hold 
them to just eight in the second 
frame before capping it off with 
his block.

Billy Donlon wrote “Not today” 

on the wall. DJ Wilson made sure 
the cost of a new paint job was 
worth it.

“He’s a big fan of his writing 

on walls and knowing that it can’t 
come off,” Wilson said. “I don’t 
how he’s gonna get that off or 
who’s gonna pay for it, but that’s 
on him. … I’m not opposed to it. It 
gets us Ws.”

Hero ball

W

ASHINGTON — Zak 
Irvin had the ball 
in his hands with 

the score tied at 65 and just 12 
seconds left 
in regulation.

It was bad 

enough that 
the senior 
wing decided 
to launch 
a triple 
attempt that 
clanged off 
the rim. 
Worse yet, 
the clock 
still read 1.7. Worst of all, 
Northwestern threw a full-
court Hail Mary pass and laid it 
up as the buzzer sounded to win 
the game.

“Hero ball” — a phrase not 

meant to be a compliment 
— has been widely used to 
characterize Irvin throughout 
the season, and the chorus rang 
louder than ever before after a 
tight back-and-
forth affair in a 
crucial contest 
between the two 
teams tied for 
sixth place in 
the conference 
last Wednesday.

Fast forward 

to Friday 
afternoon.

Irvin had 

the ball in his 
hands with just 18 seconds left 
in regulation. But this time, 
Michigan faced a 66-64 deficit 
in the quarterfinals of the Big 
Ten Tournament.

Calling off any help with 

Purdue guard Dakota Mathias 
stationed directly between him 
and the hoop, Irvin put himself 
in the position of becoming the 
scapegoat once again.

That’s not to say he hasn’t 

been used to it. Irvin’s start to 
conference play gave off the 
impression that he had the 
potential to be more than an 
All-Big Ten honorable mention, 
but he instead fell victim to a 
lengthy scoring slump.

While he dealt with a 

decreased level of production, 
his roommate and fellow 
captain Derrick Walton Jr. 
became the undisputed go-to 
guy for the Wolverines. The 
senior guard posted five 
consecutive games with over 
20 points, notched four double-
doubles and joined Michigan’s 
exclusive 1,000-point, 
400-rebound, 400-assist club.

Any betting person watching 

the game Friday would have 
wagered a lot of money that the 
ball would — and should — be in 
Walton’s hands. But that’s not 
the way Walton sees it.

“You got two guys that want 

to make big plays in the biggest 
moments of the game, and you 
can’t go wrong,” Walton said. 
“When it’s not him, it’s me, and 
when it’s not me, it’s him.”

Though Walton had a 

strong first half against the 
Boilermakers, finishing with 
10 points — second only to 
redshirt sophomore forward 
DJ Wilson’s 18-point outburst 
— he hadn’t put the ball in 

the basket at all in the second 
half. In what Walton described 
as a frequent “rock, paper, 
scissors” fight for the big shot 
between the two, Irvin had the 
upper hand.

With Mathias guarding him 

closely, Irvin drove to his left 
and gained enough separation 
to see daylight. He ran right by 
Mathias and laid it up off the 
glass to tie the game at 66 and 
send it to overtime. 

“It’s great to have somebody 

like that,” said junior guard 
Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman. “Somebody who 
wants to take the big shots and 
makes the big shots.”

Even better than the climax 

was his encore performance.

Neither team had managed 

to score for the opening 2:14 
of the extra period, and the 
tension on both sidelines had 
reached a boiling point. Though 
he may not have been wearing a 
cape, Irvin swooped in to take 

matters into 
his own hands 
again.

He drove to 

the basket on 
back-to-back 
possessions, 
bypassing 
Mathias with 
ease and putting 
the Wolverines 
ahead, 70-67, 
with 1:53 left on 

the clock. In an overtime period 
plagued by misses from the floor 
and fouls on both sides — the two 
teams combined for just seven 
points away from the charity 
stripe — Irvin embraced a self-
described “warrior mentality” 
and took it upon himself to 
decide the outcome of the game.

That’s not to say he hadn’t 

already been doing it. While 
he scored just six points before 
his clutch streak, he played 
lockdown defense on Mathias, 
the fourth-best 3-point shooter 
in the conference at 45.6 
percent, and played all 45 
minutes of the game. Mathias 
hit only one trey all game, and 
it marked his only points of the 
contest.

“He has handled this 

perceived slump that he’s 
had by just becoming a better 
defender,” said Michigan coach 
John Beilein. “What he gives us 
in intangibles, the shot is not as 
important as what he does.”

In this particular game, 

however, his big shots made all 
the difference.

With 7.6 seconds left in 

overtime, Michigan took a five-
point lead, forcing Purdue to 
foul. Before heading toward the 
bench, Irvin strutted toward the 
collection of elated Michigan 
supporters in the stands, 
sporting a wide grin and raising 
his arms jubilantly.

He might as well have had a 

giant block ‘M’ in the middle of 
his chest.

“Hero ball” might have a 

different connotation now.
