ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

WELCOME 
to 
 MICHIGAN

2021 New Student Edition


It’s been an eventful 

summer at the University 
of Michigan. While the 
pandemic remains front of 
mind, the University has 
also dealt with the fallout 
from 
a 
massive 
sexual 

assault tragedy, grappled 
with 
buildings 
named 

after 
prominent 
figures 

with problematic actions, 
committed 
to 
carbon 

neutrality and more. 

If you’ve been away from 

the news for the summer, 
here’s what you need to 
know.

April 
27: 
President’s 

advisory 
committee 

recommends 
renaming 

Yost Ice Arena

After numerous requests 

from community members, 
The President’s Advisory 
Committee on University 
History released a report 
that 
recommended 
the 

University remove Fielding 
H. Yost’s name from Yost 
Ice Arena. Yost was the 
University’s head football 
coach 
from 
1901-1923; 

the University’s athletic 
director from 1925-1926; 
and 
led 
the 
Michigan 

football team to ten Big 10 
conference titles and six 
national 
championships 

from 1921-41. 

During 
Yost’s 
tenure 

as athletic director, he 
infamously benched Willis 
Ward, the second Black 
U-M football player and 
the 1933 Big Ten Athlete 
of the Year, for a game 
against Georgia Tech after 
Georgia refused to play if 
a Black player was allowed 
on the field. The Advisory 
Committee 
specifically 

cites this incident in their 
case for removing Yost’s 
name 
from 
the 
arena. 

The committee received 
hundreds 
of 
community 

comments on the report. 
University President Mark 
Schlissel said he will renew 
the 
conversation 
during 

the fall semester. 

May 11: Report finds 

37 years of abuse by 
U-M doctor, alleges top 
U-M officials including 
football 
coach 
Bo 

Schembechler knew

A class action complaint 

was filed on May 20 in 
the U.S. District Court 
for the Eastern District 
of Michigan against the 
University of Michigan for 
its handling of allegations 
of sexual assault against 
deceased University doctor 
Robert E. Anderson. 

The 
law 
firm 

WilmerHale, which was 
hired by the University to 
conduct the investigation 
into 
these 
allegations, 

concluded in its May 11 
report that there was “no 
doubt” that the hundreds 
of 
complaints 
against 

Anderson were credible. 
WilmerHale’s report also 
recommended 
steps 
to 

improve the University’s 
practices around sexual and 
gender-based misconduct. 

The 
class 
action 

complaint seeks a court 
order that will require the 
University to carry out 
major reforms surrounding 
the school’s best-practice 
policies 
and 
procedures 

related 
to 
sexual 
and 

gender-based 
abuse 
on 

campus. The University has 
made a motion to dismiss 
the case. 

On 
June 
11, 
Matt 

Schembechler, the son of 
former Michigan football 
coach Bo Schembechler, 
in 
addition 
to 
former 

players Gilvanni Johnson 
and Daniel Kwiatkowski, 
alleged in a press conference 
that 
Bo 
Schembechler 

was aware that Anderson 
sexually assaulted student-
athletes. 
The 
claims 

sparked widespread debate 
on campus about renaming 
Schembechler 
Hall 
and 

removing 
Schembechler’s 

statue on campus. 

May 
20: 
Schlissel, 

Regents 
commit 
to 

decades-long 
carbon 

neutrality plan

At 
the 
Board 
of 

Regents meeting in May, 
Schlissel 
announced 
a 

commitment to becoming 
carbon neutrality by 2040 
across 
the 
three 
U-M 

campuses after years of 
community activism. The 
announcement came two 
years after the President’s 
Commission 
on 
Carbon 

Neutrality was formed to 
draft 
recommendations 

and 
seek 
community 

feedback on achieving this 
goal.

The plan aims to eliminate 

Scope 1 emissions, which 
derive directly from the 
University’s 
operations, 

by 2040. The University 
committed 
to 
achieving 

carbon 
neutrality 
for 

Scope 2 emissions, which 
come from the purchase of 
power off-campus, by 2025. 
Defined goals for achieving 
carbon neutrality for Scope 
3 emissions, which are 
any emissions indirectly 
related to the University, 
will also be laid out by 
2025. 

June 3: Weiser Hall 

retains its name

After 
a 
petition 
to 

rename Weiser Hall gained 
hundreds 
of 
signatures 

from 
members 
of 
the 

physics 
and 
astronomy 

departments, 
Schlissel 

decided to not recommend 
renaming 
the 
building. 

Weiser Hall is named for 
Ronald Weiser, U-M regent 
and chair of the Michigan 
Republican Party, as well 
as his wife Eileen Weiser. 

In 
April, 
Michigan 

community 
members 

known as the Network for 
Ongoing 
Reconsideration 

of 
Our 
Nomenclature 

(NORON) 
voiced 
their 

displeasure with the hall’s 
namesake by hosting a 
mock “renaming,” calling 
the building the “Weiser 
Center for Voter Supression, 
Political Assassination and 
Witch Burning.” 

The name derived from 

a remark Weiser made at a 
March 25 North Oakland 
Republican Club meeting, 

when he labeled Michigan’s 
top officeholders — three 
Democratic women — as 
“witches” and joked about 
political 
assassination. 

Soon after, Weiser was 
censured by the Board and 
removed from committees, 
though he remains on the 
Board. 

June 
17: 
University 

briefly 
lifts 
mask 

requirement 
for 
fully 

vaccinated individuals

For nearly two months 

this 
summer, 
fully 

vaccinated 
individuals 

were not required to wear 
masks 
in 
most 
indoor 

campus 
spaces. 
The 

University had reported 
single-digit 
COVID-19 

cases in each of the previous 
six weeks. The move came 
the same day Gov. Gretchen 
Whitmer 
announced 
an 

end to all statewide mask 
and capacity restrictions 
as Michigan saw its lowest 
case numbers since the 
pandemic began. 

June 
17: 
Board 
of 

Regents expands the Go 
Blue Guarantee to the 
University of Michigan’s 
Flint 
and 
Dearborn 

campuses

After years of activism 

from cross-campus groups 
such as One University, 
the University expanded 
its signature financial aid 
program to the Flint and 
Dearborn campuses. The 
Go Blue Guarantee is a 
free-tuition 
scholarship 

for in-state students whose 
family income is less than 
$65,000 annually, which is 
the state’s median income.

The 
expansion 
was 

not without controversy, 
as 
some 
protested 
the 

requirement that incoming 
students 
at 
Flint 
and 

Dearborn 
earn 
an 
3.5 

incoming GPA to receive 
the 
scholarship 
— 
a 

requirement not in place 
on the Ann Arbor campus. 
University 
officials 

responded that nearly all 
Ann Arbor campus students 

enter with higher than a 3.5 
GPA due to the Ann Arbor 
admissions process, so a 
GPA requirement is not 
necessary.

July 
15: 
Office 
of 

Institutional 
Equity 

rebranded as Equity, Civil 
Rights and Title IX office 
in attempt to overhaul 
culture 
around 
sexual 

misconduct 

Faced with scrutiny for 

high-profile 
mishandling 

of 
sexual 
misconduct 

cases 
in 
recent 
years, 

Schlissel announced that 
the 
University 
would 

create a new unit known 
as the Equity, Civil Rights 
and Title IX Office to 
replace 
the 
Office 
of 

Institutional Equity. ECRT 
will handle the same cases 
as OIE, but will focus on 
providing more “support 
and prevention” measures, 
Schlissel said.

Though the office was 

rebranded, it will continue 
to 
be 
led 
by 
Tamiko 

Strickman, the associate 
vice president and director 
of OIE who faced scrutiny 
over alleged mishandling 
cases of student sexual 
assault and racism during 
her time at the University 
of Nebraksa-Lincoln. 

The 
University 
also 

attempted to reform the 
culture around responding 
to misconduct, including 
protecting 
those 
who 

report 
misconduct 
from 

retaliation; 
prohibiting 

supervisors 
from 

attempting to initiate a 
relationship 
with 
those 

they 
supervise; 
and 

outlining plans to improve 
how potential outside hires 
and candidates for board-
approved appointments are 
vetted. 

The 
University 
also 

established a large Title IX 
advisory group composed 
of students, faculty and 
staff 
that 
will 
provide 

input on matters related to 
sexual and gender-based 
misconduct 
policy 
and 

prevention.

July 
18: 
Librarians, 

archivists and curators 
join LEO with bargaining 
status

Librarians, 
archivists 

and curators were formally 
recognized as a bargaining 
unit within the Lecturers 
Employee 
Organization, 

the University’s main union 
of non-tenure-track faculty 
on all three campuses. 
The new unit is called 
LEO-GLAM, which stands 
for 
galleries, 
libraries, 

archives and museums, to 
reflect the environments in 
which most LACs work.

July 
30: 
Schlissel 

announces 
vaccine 

requirement 
for 
all 

students, 
faculty 
and 

staff

As 
the 
Delta 
variant 

spread across the country 
after 
an 
early 
summer 

COVID-19 
lull, 
the 

University announced it 
would require all students, 
faculty and staff to be 
fully vaccinated for the 
fall semester. The policy 
grants 
limited 
medical 

and religious exemptions, 
in addition to deferrals for 
students to get vaccinated 
right away once they arrive 
on campus. 

The 
requirement 

was 
well-received, 
as 

community members said 
it 
alleviated 
confusion 

over 
different 
policies 

for 
vaccinated 
and 

unvaccinated 
students. 

The campus community 
has a higher vaccination 
rate than the surrounding 
area — 92% of students 
and 75% of employees are 
fully vaccinated, compared 
to 67% of eligible residents 
in Washtenaw County — 
but rates are much lower 
among 
University 
staff 

than students and faculty. 

Aug. 9: Indoor mask 

mandate reinstated with 
exception for residence 
halls

After Washtenaw County 

COVID-19 
transmission 

rose to levels at which 

the Centers for Disease 
Control 
and 
Prevention 

recommends 
indoor 

masking, 
the 
University 

reinstated 
its 
mask 

mandate 
regardless 
of 

vaccination status. Though 
student vaccination rates 
had surpassed the 75% 
benchmark 
originally 

set to allow unmasking 
in classrooms, the policy 
change 
means 
students 

will need to wear a mask 
indoors for the foreseeable 
future. 

A large exception is for 

students living in residence 
halls, who will be able to go 
unmasked on their floors. 
Masks 
are 
encouraged, 

but not required, at large 
outdoor gatherings such as 
football games.

Aug. 
9: 
Lecturers’ 

Employee 
Organization 

quits 
their 
contract, 

threatening a strike

After 
negotiations 

stalled, University lecturers 
announced that LEO would 
quit their contract with 
the University due to pay 
inequities 
for 
lecturers 

on the Flint and Dearborn 
campuses. Though LEO’s 
previous 
contract 
with 

the 
University 
already 

lapsed on April 20, the 
union has spent the last 
several months attempting 
to negotiate the terms of 
a new contract before the 
start of the fall semester. 

This decision means a 

large portion of faculty 
instructors could possibly 
go on strike on Sept. 8, 
just 
before 
the 
second 

week of school. It would 
mark the second straight 
year of strikes to begin the 
fall term, as the Graduate 
Employees’ 
Organization 

striked for nine days in 
September 2020 to protest 
the University’s pandemic 
response.

Campus life this fall ‘much 

closer’ to 2019 than 2020

Schlissel talks preparations, predictions for this semester

The 
Michigan 
Daily 
sat 

down with University of 
Michigan President Mark 
Schlissel Aug. 25 to discuss 
preparations for the fall 
semester amid the ongoing 
pandemic. This interview has 
been edited for clarity. 

Mark Schlissel: Students 

are coming back, we’re 
planning to have now 93% 
of our classes being taught 
in person and the residence 
halls are nearly full. We’ve 
had very good success and 
uptake on our vaccination 
requirements. We’re up to 
91% of students on the Ann 
Arbor campus — and I think 
that continues to go up — 
and 87% of faculty and then 
looking at 72% of staff have 
already 
completed 
their 

vaccination 
requirement. 

Those rates are much higher 
than 
the 
surrounding 

community, and it really 
puts us in strong shape to 
have the kind of semester 
that we’re all trying to have. 

That has to be balanced 

against concern around this 
Delta variant that certainly 
can 
infect 
vaccinated 

people. Thankfully it doesn’t 
make them ill enough to 
require hospitalization, and 
you almost never see severe 
illness 
in 
a 
vaccinated 

person, but we have to 
continue to be vigilant. 

Overall, the message is it’s 
a pretty exciting time of the 
year at the University, and 
it’s a very different feel.

The 
Michigan 
Daily: 

At the end of last semester, 
you said that the best case 
scenario for fall was having 
a vast majority of campus 
vaccinated, and the worst 
case 
a 
variant 
forcing 

more mitigation measures. 
Considering both played out 
to some extent, what should 
students expect campus life 
to be like this semester? For 
example, 
should 
student 

organizations or individual 
students 
host 
large 

meetings, shows, tailgates 
or parties?

MS: I think life on campus 

is going to be much closer to 
2019 than it will be to 2020 
in the fall. We are having the 
residence halls running at 
essentially full occupancy; 
we put aside some rooms 
in case we need to do 
quarantine, but basically the 
residence halls are up and 
running again. You don’t 
have to mask inside the 
residence halls. Everyone 
has to be vaccinated in the 
residence halls, and the very 
tiny number of students 
that aren’t for medical or 
religious reasons will be 
masked. All of the lounges 
in the residence halls will be 
open, the dining halls will 
be open, so that part of the 
student experience — the 
lived experience — will be 
much closer to normal. 

Student 
orgs 
will 
be 

free to meet. We’ll have 

at least in the beginning 
of the year a masking 
requirement regardless of 
your vaccination status if 
you’re operating indoors. 
Outdoors, it’s up to you, 
though I would still advise 
people 
in 
big 
crowds 

outdoors to wear a mask, 
to be prudent regardless of 
whether they’re vaccinated, 
but it won’t be a requirement 
at this stage. So life will be 
much more like what you 
recall, what brings joy to 
students.

TMD: Given some of the 

Delta variant concerns, the 
fact that cases are still rising, 
how optimistic are you that 
classes will stay in person, 
that athletic events will 
have full fan capacity and 
that students in residence 
halls will be housed there 
the entire school year?

MS: 
My 
crystal 
ball 

has a big crack in it. The 
ability to predict a novel 
once-in-a-lifetime event is 
tough. I think we’re very 
well-positioned 
to 
make 

it all the way through this 
semester without the kinds 
of interventions that we 
had to impose last year, but 
we have to continue to be 
vigilant.

For example, we’ll still 

require 
folks 
who 
are 

unvaccinated to be tested 
weekly for COVID, and 
if the levels of COVID 
increase, we’ll test more 
frequently than that. We’re

Potential lecturers’ strike would 

‘represent a failure’ 

From The Daily’s interview with U-M’s president:

LEO union can vote to take labor action beginning Sept. 8

The Michigan Daily sat 
down with University of 
Michigan President Mark 
Schlissel Aug. 25 to discuss 
a potential lecturers’ strike, 
calls to rename campus 
buildings, Schlissel’s football 
season prediction and more. 
This interview has been 
edited for clarity. 

The Michigan Daily: 

The Lecturers’ Employee 
Organization 
quit 
their 

contract with the University 
earlier this month, meaning 
a large portion of faculty 
instructors could go on 
strike the second week 
of school. What is the 
likelihood of a LEO strike?

Mark Schlissel: It’s up to 

LEO. I really don’t believe 
that a strike is necessary. 
I think a strike represents 
a failure. It represents the 
failure of both parties to 
diligently negotiate in good 
faith with one another with 
the shared intention of 
arriving at a fair contract. 
So if there’s a strike, we 
failed. I’m very hopeful that 
there won’t be, but that’s 
really in LEO’s hands.

The University made a 

recent salary offer. LEO 
told us the most important 
issue to them was starting 
salaries, 
particularly 
in 

Flint 
and 
in 
Dearborn 

where 
they 
had 
been 

quite low. With the last 
contract, 
the 
starting 

salaries went up quite a 
bit, and the University just 
last week offered increases 
to 
lecturers’ 
starting 

minimums between 16% 
and 
17% 
increase. 
16% 

and 17%, that’s a pretty 
fair amount all at once, as 
well as across-the-board 
annual increases. There’s a 
negotiating session today. 
The University is ready to 
negotiate every single day, 
and we remain committed 
to continuing to bargain to 
come to a fair resolution. 

A strike would cause 

tremendous 
harm 
to 

students. 
Lecturers 
are 

critical 
colleagues 
in 

delivering the Michigan 
curriculum. They’re a great 
part of our educational 
experience. 
They’re 

our 
colleagues, 
they’re 

our friends, they’re our 
neighbors. We would really 
love to find an amicable 
way to move forward and 
treat 
everybody 
fairly 

and not really cause the 
challenge and the chaos of 
a strike at the beginning of 
the semester. Last fall was a 
rocky semester. We’d really 
love to give our students the 
gift of a Michigan education 
instead of this labor strife. 

We’ve 
called 
upon 
a 

state mediator who’s been 
working with us. We also 
petitioned the state for a 
fact finder — that’s the next 
step after mediation where 
someone comes in and 
determines facts on both 

sides and then proposes 
a 
way 
forward. 
We’re 

committed to that process. 

TMD: What did you learn 

from last fall’s Graduate 
Employees’ Union strike 
as you prepare for the 
potential of a similar one?

MS: I think one of the 

common lessons of the 
whole pandemic is that 
communication is really 
important, and having open 
lines 
of 
communication, 

so that we don’t just think 
we understand a group or 
a person’s situation — we 
actually ask them about 
it. And what we’ve been 
doing in the many months 
since last academic year is 
really meeting with GEO 
regularly, absent a crisis, 
on often on a weekly basis, 
to work on shared issues 
of concern to try to head 
things off at the pass before 
they get to the stage of 
provoking frustration and 
anger that might lead to 
some kind of work action.

So that’s what we have 

learned from GEO last 
year, and we continue to 
work on it optimistically 
in partnership to avoid 
the same kind of thing 
moving forward. The GEO 
has been very supportive 
of vaccination efforts, for 
example, 
and 
masking 

indoors and the like. Efforts 
to keep people safe have 
been quite collaborative.

Incoming tenants at The One ask for half off rent, free parking 
after construction delays push back move-in with days’ notice

Luxury student housing complex offering residents temporary housing, stipends, as they wait up to weeks to occupy units

Incoming 
residents 

of The One Ann Arbor, 
a 
new, 
student-oriented 

luxury housing complex, 
are calling for 50% off 
rent and free parking after 
construction delays pushed 
their move-in dates up to 
weeks behind what was 
promised in their leases.

Approximately 
175 

residents, many of whom 
are University of Michigan 
students, signed onto an 
open letter sent to The 
One management on Aug. 
23. 
The 
letter 
writers 

demanded the return of a 
$275 “no-hassle” fee and 
a new utility management 
system, in addition to 50% 
off rent and free parking 
for the entirety of the lease. 

The One Ann Arbor, 

which 
charges 
between 

$945 and $1805 a month 
per tenant, has been under 
construction for the past 
year with the intention of 
opening for the 2020-2021 
school year.

“We have been lied to, 

misled, manipulated, and 
treated inhumanely,” the 
tenants wrote in the letter, 
which was obtained by The 
Michigan Daily.

The 
One 
began 

publicizing 
itself 
to 

students during the 2019-
2020 school year, when 
they stationed employees at 
tables around campus and 
offered students gifts like 
free smoothies to garner 
interest in the housing 
complex. 

Using 
phrases 
like 

“you’ve never lived like 
this!”, 
the 
company 

advertised 
itself 
as 
a 

luxury 
alternative 
to 

other off-campus housing. 
The complex also hired 
ambassadors, 
many 
of 

whom 
were 
University 

students, to promote The 
One on their social media 
platforms. 

The letter writers said 

they are frustrated with 
the delays in construction 
and safety certifications on 
their townhouses, arguing 
they signed leases months 
ago with the expectation 
that 
the 
move-in 
date 

would be honored. 

Many 
future 
tenants 

were notified Aug. 19 — just 
days before the expected 
move-in date of Aug. 24 — 
that their housing was not 
ready, according to emails 
from The One management 
reviewed by The Daily.

Tenants 
were 
given 

three 
options: 
receive 

temporary housing from 
The One in addition to $50 
per day; arrange their own 
housing and receive $100 
per day; or terminate their 
leases.

Trinitas Ventures, the 

Indiana-based 
parent 

company 
of 
The 
One, 

wrote in a statement to 
The Daily that they are 
“deeply disappointed” by 
the occupancy delays and 
sympathize with residents 
and their parents.

“We are parents, too,” 

the statement read. “We 
are doing everything in 
our 
power 
to 
provide 

solutions for our residents 
to minimize the impact on 
the start of their school 
year. We are offering hotel 

rooms, daily stipends, rent 
prorations and rent waivers 
as 
well 
as 
increased 

shuttle service during the 
temporary 
hotel 
stays—

and ultimately, if that is 
insufficient, the option to 
terminate the lease. For all 
of those that stick with us, 
we look forward to serving 
them well.”

In the letter, the tenants 

said 
they 
were 
caught 

off guard by the last-
minute change after being 
repeatedly reassured that 
the 
complex 
would 
be 

ready on time. The tenants 
also wrote that these delays 
upended expensive travel 
arrangements, 
making 

the 
already 
stressful 

experience of moving even 
worse. 

“These 
actions 
are 

inexcusable,” the tenants 
wrote. 
“An 
unforeseen 

delay 
is 
one 
thing; 
a 

complete and utter failure 
to communicate with the 
residents, or show them 
the simple respect of giving 
them what they paid for, is 
malicious and intentional.”

The letter states The One 

management 
reportedly 

encouraged 
tenants 
to 

secure their own housing or 
“stay with a friend,” which 
they found irresponsible 
given the ongoing COVID-
19 pandemic. They also felt 
frustrated after being told 
“to pack less” when they 
asked for storage units to 
store their belongings.

The tenants said the 

hotels designated by The 
One as temporary housing 
until they can move in are 
in Canton and Livonia, 
making getting to class 
difficult. 
While 
tenants 

heard about the possibility 
of shuttles from the hotels 
to campus, they said the 
plans lacked clarity.

On Aug. 23, tenants were 

asked to sign an addendum 
in return for temporary 
housing 
arrangements, 

a 
copy 
of 
which 
was 

reviewed by The Daily, 
in part asking them to 
absolve The One and its 
parent company from any 
wrongdoing. Tenants said 
they felt this aspect of the 
addendum limited their 
ability 
to 
pursue 
legal 

recourse.

“Essentially, 
students 

had 24 hours to decide if 
they were going to accept 
The One’s new addendum, 
which released them of 
liability, or be homeless,” 

the letter reads.

Some tenants noted that 

they signed “under duress,” 
meaning they were forced 
or coerced, but the online 
signature platform didn’t 
allow them to specify their 
signature as so.

These 
tenants 
said 

their demands will help 
mitigate 
the 
“mental 

anguish” they face during 
the weeks leading up to 
move-in, a process made 
even more stressful by this 
year’s return to in-person 
learning.

The first of the expected 

move-in dates falls three 
days after classes begin 
for the fall semester on 
Monday, Aug. 30. Writers 
of the letter who are not 
staying in a hotel said 

they have had to scramble 
to 
find 
housing 
while 

also 
coordinating 
with 

instructors in the event 
they cannot be in Ann 
Arbor for the start of 
classes.

“All in all, the actions 

taken by The One are 
negligent, dishonest, and 
inhumane,” 
the 
tenants 

wrote. 
“Their 
lack 
of 

communication 
has 

imminent 
consequences, 

such 
as 
homelessness 

and food insecurity, for 
students who have already 
paid their first month’s 
rent.”

 Summer semester in South Korea draws mixed reviews as study 

abroad opens for 2021-22 school year

Students to travel to Germany, Iceland, the United Kingdom and South Korea for six programs this fall

LSA senior Tiffani Ihrke 

was supposed to return home 
from the South Korea trial 
study abroad program in early 
August with fellow students. 
Instead, frontline workers 
dressed 
in 
hazmat 
suits 

picked Ihrke up and rushed 
her to a treatment facility in 
Seoul after she tested positive 
for COVID-19 just a couple of 
days before her flight back to 
the U.S.

Ihrke had been a part of the 

Yonsei International Summer 
School (YISS) program for the 
Spring/Summer 2021 term. 
It was the first study abroad 
program to take place at the 
University of Michigan since 
all were suspended in March 
2020 due to the pandemic.

Despite testing positive at 

the end of the program, Ihrke 
said she sincerely enjoyed 
her time in South Korea. 
She attributed her positive 
experience 
to 
living 
off-

campus due to both financial 
reasons and the desire to 
experience more of South 
Korean society. 

“I personally learned so 

much about myself, and 
I gained so much insight 
about different cultures and 
the different ways that the 
pandemic is being handled in 
different areas,” Ihrke said. 

Once 
her 
10-day 

quarantine is finished, Ihrke 
can 
request 
confirmation 

of her recovery from the 
local center of public health 
and reenter the U.S. with 
documentation 
confirming 

her recovery starting Aug. 21. 
Ihrke was fully vaccinated 
when she tested positive for 

the virus, as the University 
has required all students 
participating in on- and 
off-campus 
programs 
— 

including study abroad — to 
be vaccinated. 

For 
now, 
Ihrke 
is 
in 

quarantine at the treatment 
facility with a government-
assigned random roommate 
who also tested positive and 
is dealing with the downsides 
of studying abroad during a 
pandemic. 

“I’ve 
been 
very 
well 

taken 
care 
of, 
and 
I’m 

really fortunate that the 
Korean government is so 
accommodating for COVID 
specifically, but it’s definitely 
been a headache, to say the 
least,” Ihrke told The Daily 
while in the Seoul National 
University Treatment Center. 

The Centers for Disease 

Control 
and 
Prevention 

currently 
classifies 
South 

Korea 
as 
a 
“Level 
2: 

Moderate” out of a scale from 
“Level unknown” to “Level 
4: Very High” in terms of 
COVID-19 risk. Both new 
daily infections and deaths 
have increased since June, 
and roughly 21% of the 
country is fully vaccinated.

Business junior Gabriella 

Jakubczak, another student 
who 
participated 
in 
the 

program but lived on campus 
at YISS, said physically being 
in South Korea was “better 
than anything else I would 
have done this summer.”

But as rising COVID-19 

cases in the country led to 
YISS’s and South Korea’s 
increasingly stricter social 
distancing rules, Jakubczak 
began to realize how much 
the pandemic still inevitably 
impacted the program. 

“Eventually 
you 
could 

only go out in pairs after 6 
p.m,” Jakubczak said. “They 
shut down all the street food 
in Korea, which is insane, 
considering how much that’s 
a part of their culture and 
how prevalent that is within 
the city. It was like walking 
in an empty Times Square; 
you’d just see storefronts 
empty.”

Jakubczak 
said 
if 
she 

knew how bad the COVID-
19 situation was going to 
be earlier in the year, she 
probably 
would’ve 
opted 

to complete the program 
online from the U.S. instead. 
According 
to 
Jakubczak, 

studying abroad amidst the 
pandemic also sometimes led 
to miscommunication from 
CGIS staff about program 
details like dates for certain 
activities.

“I think the problem is 

there 
was 
an 
increased 

demand for support and 
responsiveness 
that 
we 

needed because it was a 
COVID program (during the 
pandemic),” Jakubczak said.

CGIS 
Director 
Michael 

Jordan said he has yet to 
send out surveys and receive 
feedback from students who 
were in South Korea. He 
told The Daily that CGIS 
often communicated with 
students in the program, and 
he asked for “flexibility” and 
“patience” 
from 
students 

when traveling abroad given 
the current circumstances of 
the pandemic.

Jordan said CGIS has 

been communicating “quite 
frequently” with students 
in the South Korea program 
especially because it was the 
office’s first ongoing program 
in a year.

“Information 
has 
been 

and continues to change 
very 
frequently 
under 

these circumstances, so I 
can imagine it could get 
confusing,” Jordan said. “But 
again, it is a situation that’s 
changing on a daily basis, 
so we definitely require our 
partners’ and the students’ 
patience 
and 
flexibility, 

because this virus and the 
pandemic just keep throwing 
curveballs at us.”

Looking ahead to the fall

Six 
programs 
will 
be 

running this fall semester 
in South Korea, Germany, 
Iceland 
and 
the 
United 

Kingdom, 
including 
a 

different program in Yonsei.

Jordan said CGIS had to 

cancel numerous programs 
for both the fall and winter 
semesters after evaluating 
the status of the pandemic in 
various countries.

“We’ve worked for years 

to expand the options for our 
students’ interest among our 
students and destinations 
outside of Western Europe,” 
Jordan said. “But at this 
point in time, those are the 
countries that are letting 
Americans in and that meet 
the University’s criteria for 
health and safety during a 
pandemic.”

Some 
of 
the 
criteria 

include infection rates and 
vaccination rates among that 
country or city’s population, 
quality 
of 
the 
country’s 

healthcare 
system 
and 

potential overuse of that 
country’s healthcare system 
by U-M students.

“Even though our students 

are vaccinated they could 
still transmit the virus, so it 
seems unethical to be sending 

them 
into 
unvaccinated 

countries,” Jordan said. “If 
the local medical system is 
already being overtaxed by 
the pandemic, then obviously 
we don’t want to exacerbate 
that.”

LSA junior Jorge Blanes 

will be studying in Germany 
this fall to earn credit for his 
double major in International 
Studies and German.

Though he admitted that 

potential 
lockdowns 
and 

risk of being sent back to the 
U.S. were “daunting,” Blanes 
said he considers the pros 
of meeting new people and 
venturing into a new country 
worth the challenges. He 
said studying abroad this fall 
is the best time academically 
for him to do so. 

“It’s basically a risk-reward 

thing, and the rewards seem 
to outweigh the risks right 
now,” Blanes said. “They 
won’t really let the program 
happen unless they see that 
we’re going to be, for the 
most part, safe.” 

LSA 
junior 
Garrett 

Ashlock also contemplated 
the benefits and drawbacks 
of 
studying 
abroad 
and 

ultimately chose to enroll 
in a program at University 
of 
Cambridge 
Pembroke 

College in the fall. Feeling 
like his time was running out 
in addition to being accepted 
into his “dream school” of 
Cambridge, Ashlock said he 
felt it was necessary to seize 
the opportunity. 

“Ultimately, it came down 

to the fact that this was 
basically going to be my 
only chance to study abroad 
that I had left, and this was 
such a great program and 
one that is very selective to 
get into,” Ashlock said. “So 

after weighing the options, 
even though there are some 
inherent risks with traveling 
abroad during the pandemic, 
I thought it was still the best 
thing to do.”

Though Ashlock is fully 

vaccinated, 
he 
said 
he 

remains 
worried 
about 

potentially contracting the 
virus. However, he said he 
is grateful CGIS and the 
University are able to support 
him if he must navigate a 
foreign system.

“I think the amount of 

effort that Michigan puts 
into sending students abroad, 
and the amount of resources 
that they have, helps me 
feel a lot better about going 
somewhere, 
especially 
in 

the middle of a pandemic,” 
Ashlock said.

After the challenges she 

faced during the program 
in South Korea, Jakubczak 
said she is debating whether 
or not to follow through 
with another study abroad 
program planned for the 
winter semester. 

“It’s very isolating in a 

way that you already know 
what COVID feels like in the 
United States,” Jakubczak 
said. “Now imagine you 
have no friends, you have no 
family support and maybe 
now you have a language 
barrier, depending on where 
you’re going. So now you’re 
really truly alone. I was 
supposed to go on a study 
abroad program to Madrid in 
the winter semester this year, 
and I’m wondering whether 
or not I want to go through 
that again.”

Ross professor goes viral dancing 
as potato in Zoom review session

Student’s TikTok has 20 million views, 4.7 million likes

It’s not always business 

as usual when it comes to 
assistant professor Ryan 
Ball’s graduate accounting 
class.

In August, an anything-

but-conventional 
Zoom 

review session kicked off 
with a blaring rendition 
of Michael Buffer’s “Let’s 
Get Ready to Rumble!” 
and a stock image of the 
University of Michigan’s 
Ross School of Business on 
screen. Students, confused 
yet intrigued, danced along 
to the music not knowing 
what exactly was to come. 

Then, in an entrance 

nothing 
short 
of 
spud-

tacular, Ball, with the screen 
name Dr. Po Tato, suddenly 
emerged 
as 
a 
floating 

potato with sparklers and 
a birthday hat, dancing 
around the Zoom screen.

After 
watching 
the 

entire 
sequence 
unfold, 

Business graduate student 
Amelia Charamand-Quelas 
told The Michigan Daily 
she wanted to share the 
spectacle with her family in 
Argentina.

“The 
primary 
way 

(my 
family 
and 
I) 

communicate because of 
the 
time 
differences 
is 

we just send each other 
WhatsApps, 
YouTube 

videos and TikTok videos,” 
Charamand-Quelas 
said. 

“I just posted on (TikTok) 
for my four followers, who 
were all pretty much family 
members, to see.”

The 
next 
morning, 

Charamand-Quelas awoke 
to find that her video, 

originally 
intended 
for 

family and friends, became 
a viral hit on TikTok with 
hundreds of thousands of 
views. Not expecting the 
video to go viral overnight, 
Charamand-Quelas had not 
previously asked Ball for 
permission to post the clip, 
so she quickly deleted it.

“My initial thought was, 

‘Oh, I’m getting kicked 
out 
of 
the 
(Master 
of 

Management 
program),’” 

Charamand-Quelas said. “I 
knew I needed to contact 
the professor and let him 
know this happened.”

Despite fearing the worst, 

Charamand-Quelas 
said 

Ball asked her to repost 
the TikTok for his children 
to see. Soon after being 
re-uploaded, the TikTok 
went viral again, rapidly 
drawing in 20 million views 
and 4.7 million likes.

As the viral video found 

its way into nearly every 
U-M 
student’s 
direct 

messages, For You Page and 
Facebook group, the entire 
U-M community shared the 
joy of watching a professor 
dance around as a potato. 

For Ball, humor plays a 

key role in his instruction, 
and he said his potato 
prank was just another 
way of keeping his students 
engaged — especially over 
Zoom.

“I think with any class, 

particularly virtually, you 
reach a certain point where 
you can just tell people are 
fatigued,” Ball said. “And 
I think that that occurs in 
person as well, but I would 
do other stuff, tell stories, 
whatever, just to capture 
their attention … I don’t 
plan it. It just feels right.”

When 
Business 
junior 

Alysse 
Armstrong 
first 

saw the TikTok, she said 
her reaction was like most 
users’.

“Initially, I was surprised 

by 
the 
whole 
thing,” 

Armstrong said. “But I 
appreciate that professors 
are making an effort to 
make Zoom classes more 
enjoyable and fun even 
though we’ve all been doing 
them for so long.”

Brands 
across 
the 

globe even joined in on 
the fun, with the official 
Zoom 
TikTok 
account 

commenting, 
“They 
just 

won at Zoom.”

The video’s response was 

so overwhelmingly positive 
that 
Charamand-Quelas 

worked alongside Ball and 
posted a follow-up video, 
which, not to her surprise, 
outperformed the original 
with 26.1 million views and 
5.9 million likes.

“I had hoped that it 

would (perform better) just 
because I knew it was such 
a good video,” Charamand-
Quelas said. 

In part two of the spud 

saga, Dr. Po Tato checks in 
on his “family members” 
who, to his absolute horror, 
have 
all 
been 
baked. 

Afterward, 
Ball 
“gets 

serious” and moves into his 
exam review session, still as 
a floating potato.

Among the most-liked 

comments on this second 
video is one from the official 
account of “The Office” that 
says, “Truly such Michael 
Scott energy.”

M-36 Coffee Roasters opens at old 

South U. Espresso Royale location 

New cafe owned & operated by former ER employees

M-36 
Coffee 
Roasters 

opened a new cafe Aug. 
16, filling both the vacant 
storefront and coffee void 
on South University Avenue 
left after Espresso Royale 
closed in June 2020 due to 
pandemic hardships. 

M-36 
owners 
Ken 

Pargulski and Lisa Tuveson 
were both Espresso Royale 
employees. They started their 
business after purchasing 
Espresso 
Royale’s 
coffee 

roaster last June. 

“(After Espresso Royale 

closed), 
my 
immediate 

thought was that I wanted 
to keep doing what I do,” 
Pargulski said. “I really love 
coffee roasting, I really love 
coffee, and Lisa and I have 
had a long working history 
and a lot of experience. I just 
wanted to keep going.”

M-36 
Coffee 
Roasters 

can be found at 1101 South 

University Ave. Their hours 
Monday-Friday are 7 a.m.-6 
p.m. and Saturday-Sunday 
from 8 a.m.-6 p.m. 

After buying the roaster, 

Pargulski 
and 
Tuveson 

said their initial goal was 
to continue selling their 
coffee to grocery stores and 
other remaining Espresso 
Royale locations in Urbana-
Champaign, Ill. When the 
opportunity came to lease 
the old Espresso Royale 
location, Pargulski said they 
were excited to return to 
their roots. 

“We 
started 
really 

thinking about it … (and said) 
this is a good opportunity,” 
Pargulski said. “I mean 
we miss(ed) having that 
presence directly in Ann 
Arbor, and this was an 
opportunity to do it.”

Tuveson said the cafe’s 

atmosphere is diverse and 
inclusive, catering to both 
Ann Arbor residents and 
University 
of 
Michigan 

students. 

 “There has always been a 

mix of ages, types of people, 
demographic, 
anything 

at all of our cafes … we’re 
pretty laid back people and 
we 
welcome 
everybody,” 

Tuveson said. 

Tuveson said that many 

old Espresso Royale staples, 
such 
as 
the 
pumpkin 

chocolate chip bread, vegan 
zucchini bread and almond 
raspberry scones will be 
returning to the M-36 menu. 

For Ann Arbor resident 

Sofia Csazar, the return 
of a coffee shop to the old 
Espresso Royale location is 
a welcome surprise. Csaszar 
said she frequented Espresso 
Royale and is happy she 
can get her favorite coffee 
beverages from the new 
location. 

“I used to really miss the 

Espresso Royale that used to 
be here, but I’m really very 
happy with (M-36),” Csazar 
said.

In a summer of upheaval for col-

lege football, yet another development 
threatens to fundamentally change the 
structure of the sport. 

The Big Ten, Pac-12 and ACC 

announced Tuesday that they are join-
ing forces in an inter-conference “alli-
ance,” intended to both counter the 
SEC’s expansion into a 16-team super-
conference and reinforce “shared val-
ues” among the three conferences. 

“I think we have to keep in mind 

what brought us to this day — what 
brought us all to college athletics — and 
that is the student athletes,” Big Ten 
Commissioner Kevin Warren said. “We 
need to make sure we have shared val-
ues, we keep academics first, we keep 
our integrity and honor and collabora-
tion together,” 

The alliance includes a scheduling 

partnership in football and men’s and 
women’s basketball which, according 
to ACC commissioner Jim Phillips, will 
“elevate the national profile of all of our 
teams by playing from coast to coast 
with college fans across the country 
as the beneficiaries.” While the specif-
ics of the partnership remain unclear, 
the existing ACC-Big Ten Challenge 
in men’s and women’s basketball could 
serve as a baseline model for what inter-
conference competition will look like. 

Crucially, the scheduling alliance 

in football comes alongside a round of 
College Football Playoff (CFP) expan-
sion, which in turn could remove dis-
incentives against scheduling tough 
non-conference opponents. In June, 
a sub-group of the CFP management 
committee proposed a 12-team playoff 
format to supplant the existing four-
team model. All three commissioners 
expressed support for the expansion 
but also emphasized the challenges that 
come with it. 

“I’m a big believer in expanding the 

College Football Playoff,” Warren said. 
“But also, I’m a big believer in being 
methodical and doing our homework. … 
We need to think through the length of 
the season, health and wellness issues 
— not only physical but also mental — 
primarily the academics, how does this 
affect final exams.”

The three conferences will also work 

together to confront the challenges of 
changing name, image and likeness 
(NIL) legislation brought about by the 
Supreme Court decision in National Col-
legiate Athletic Association v. Alston. As 

of now, there is little NCAA guidance or 
rules regarding NIL. If the three confer-
ences have similar priorities, the alliance 
could help them coordinate in the cre-
ation of league-wide guidance. 

“These matters, while challeng-

ing, also present once-in-a-generation 
opportunities for the leaders in college 
sports to reevaluate long-standing ways 
of conducting our business,” Pac-12 
Commissioner George Kliavkoff said. “ 
… Despite the shifting landscape, there 
are some critical constants among 
many in college athletics, and specifi-
cally among every one of the 41 member 
institutions in our three conferences.”

Still, the agreement between the 

three conferences is just that: an agree-
ment. There is no signed contract laying 
out expectations, nor is there a specific 
timeline to the plans laid out by the 
alliance. Another round of unexpected 
conference realignment or a drastic 
shift in TV deals could, in theory, send 
the whole alliance up in smoke. 

The commissioners don’t see that 

happening. 

“It’s about trust,” Phillips said. “… 

We’ve looked each other in the eye, 
we’ve made an agreement. We have 
great confidence and faith, our board 
charis have looked each other in the eye 
and have committed to the same level of 
support and connection to one another, 
our athletic directors have done that.”

After a strong showing in 

the first half of the Olym-
pics, more Wolverine ath-
letes will be returning from 
Tokyo with some new hard-
ware.

Wolverine Shelina Zador-
sky (2010 – 2013) helped 
their soccer team defeat 
Sweden in a game that was 
decided by penalty kicks. 

Riviere played 27 minutes 

in extra time as a defend-
er while Zadorsky only 
logged less than a minute 
in match time. Zadorsky 
won a bronze medal at the 

2016 Rio games, while this 
is Riviere’s first Olympic 
medal. Additionally, it is 
also the first time a Cana-
dian women’s soccer team 
has brought gold back to 
the North American coun-
try. 

In addition to the two 

soccer 
medals, 
graduate 

student 
wrestler 
Myles 

Amine will be bringing a 
bronze medal to San Mari-
no. Amine was one of the 
flag bearers for the small 
country and is the first 
individual male Olympic 
medalist in the nation’s his-
tory.

Thanks to a late take-

down, Amine became the 
second Michigan wrestler 
to ever win an Olympic 
medal, and is the first free-
style wrestling medalist to 
emerge from the program. 

Ultimately, the Wolver-

ines won 11 medals: 3 gold, 5 
silver, and 3 bronze. Swim-
mer Maggie MacNeil con-
tributed most to that total 
after leaving Tokyo with 
three medals (1 gold, 1 sil-
ver, 1 bronze). In addition 
to MacNeil, former swim-
mer Siobhán Haughey won 
two silver medals and for-
mer swimmer Catie DeLoof 
won a bronze. Softball play-
er Amanda Chidester and 
graduate assistant diving 
coach Michael Hixon both 
won silver medals as well. 

With its 11 total medals, 

Michigan would have tied 
for 18th with the Czech 
Republic in the total medal 
standings, proving that the 
Wolverine athletic domi-
nance of the past was no 
different for these Olympic 
games.

The way Donovan Jeter 

sees it, last year’s season-
opening demolition of then-
No. 21 Minnesota was the 
worst thing to happen to the 
Michigan football team. 

“We 
were 
feeling 
our-

selves a little too much,” the 
fifth-year defensive tackle 
recounted on Tuesday, ten 
months later and two weeks 
into Michigan’s 2021 fall 
camp. “All the players were 
on social media. I don’t 
wanna say, ‘took our foot off 
the gas,’ like we weren’t pre-
paring hard, (but) we started 
feeling ourselves too much. 
In college football, you can’t 
do that. It doesn’t matter who 
you play.” 

The Wolverines learned 

that the hard way last year, 
slogging through a calami-
tous 
2-4 
campaign 
and 

reaching the nadir of the 
Jim Harbaugh era. By the 
time a COVID-19 outbreak 
brought the season to a mer-
ciless close, the victory over 
Minnesota seemed like a 
mirage. 

Michigan’s defense played 

a significant role in the Wol-
verines’ demise. As a collec-
tive unit, it bottomed out as 
the third-worst defense in 

the Big Ten, sinking Michi-
gan’s season along with it. 

Those struggles induced 

an offseason overhaul. Out 
went defensive coordinator 
Don Brown, replaced by Mike 
Macdonald. In came a new 
scheme and an array of new 
philosophies. 

“Coming from last year, we 

really didn’t have too much to 
really show our true talents,” 
Michigan safety Daxton Hill 
said. “Now I feel like we have 
more freedom, a lot more 
tools to work from, whether 
it’s our talent or the coaches’ 
calls. That comes with more 
abilities, more freedom to the 
ball, not being one dimen-
sional.”

While players are confi-

dent that Macdonald’s sys-
tem will pay dividends, the 
early reviews come with an 
asterisk. Fall camp discourse 
is often fallacious, with the 
season looming as the true 
barometer of a team’s suc-
cess. No one knows that bet-
ter than Jeter. 

A 4-star prospect out of 

high school, Jeter has been 
met with lofty expectations 
since he first arrived in Ann 
Arbor. And yet, four years 
into his Michigan career, his 
production has been subpar.

Last week, Michigan coach 

Jim Harbaugh noted that 
Jeter is in the midst of his 

“best month, best offseason” 
as a Wolverine. Entering his 
fifth and perhaps final year 
in the program, Jeter recog-
nizes that it’s time to make 
good on Harbaugh’s words. 

“The compliments from 

Coach 
(Harbaugh) 
are 

always 
nice, 
but 
dude, 

I’ve been getting compli-
ments 
since 
like 
2019,” 

Jeter said. “… I don’t want 
to say it doesn’t mean noth-
ing because that comes off 
wrong. But I just really got 
to go and show it on Satur-
days in the Big House.” 

That holds true for the 

whole unit. If Michigan is 
going to out-perform its pre-
season 
expectations, 
the 

defense will surely be at the 
forefront of the revitaliza-
tion.

And that starts with a fresh 

mindset, as much as any-
thing. 

“Don’t rest on what you did 

yesterday,” Jeter said. “When 
you go to sleep and wake up, 
what you did yesterday does 
not matter — it doesn’t mat-
ter if you had a great day, ter-
rible day, doesn’t matter. You 
can’t go back and change it or 
fix it. 

“We’ve all been preaching 

to, every day, find something 
to get better at. Every day, 
get a step closer to where you 
want to get to.”

I’m sitting in a car, the win-

dows down. A nice lake breeze 
and the beach a few feet away 
remind me of home. When 
the phone rings, I take a deep 
breath. My high school physics 
teacher is calling.

Almost a year ago her son, 

Ian Miskelley, passed away. Ian 
swam at Michigan for two years 
and won four state champion-
ships in high school.

Ian struggled his whole life 

with anxiety and depression, 
familiarizing the family with 
the mental health system of 
both West Michigan and the 
University of Michigan. At the 
University, Ian had the help of 
the athletic department and his 
family to make sure he got the 
care he needed, but the same 
can’t be said for his time in West 
Michigan.

So, soon after he passed, Jill 

and Steve Miskelley founded 

Be Better;, a nonprofit based in 
Holland, Mich., that focuses on 
two different aspects of mental 
health.

“We wanted to do something 

in Ian’s name, we just weren’t 
sure what it was gonna be,” Jill 
Miskelley told The Daily. “Then 
the more I thought about it, talk-
ed about it, we wanted to focus 
on the treatment side of mental 
health, not so much the aware-
ness.”

The first area of focus is based 

around building communities 
for teenagers, young adults and 
grieving parents via a network 
of support groups.

“We want this to be a place for 

kids to hang out because a lot of 

kids we talk to — I know for Ian 
it was the same — was he had 
his friends, his team, but it was 
also really good to have a group 
of friends that knew what he 
was talking about,” Jill Miskel-
ley said. “That could understand 
what it’s like to have real bad 
anxiety, 
depression, 
border-

line personality. Somebody else 
that he didn’t feel like he was 
constantly burdening his room-
mates or his best friends. We’re 
trying to make a community like 
that and a safe place for every-
body to be.”

These support groups are 

going to be led by counselors 
from Mosaic counseling, an 
outpatient therapy group based 
out of Grand Haven, Mich. For 
now, the groups will be confined 
to 15 people due to space con-
straints, but as the foundation’s 
ultimate goal means having its 
own building, those sizes seem 
bound to grow.

While the support groups will 

be a way for people to discuss 
their problems, they also offer 

an avenue for counselors to lend 
their support. Should they see 
someone struggling with their 
problems, the counselors may 
work with the individual to find 
more care.

The second area of mental 

health treatment that Be Better; 
is focusing on is to connect the 
aspects of treatment. Rather than 
being a game of telephone where 
a prospective patient is passed 
from one service to another, Be 
Better; aims to put one in touch 
with the help they need.

“Steve (Miskelley) calls it 

‘one-stop shopping.’ You walk 
in and we got you, we can get 
you through the whole system,” 
Jill Miskelley said. “Even if 
that means we call the Ottawa 
County Crisis Line, because 
we’re also in contact with them, 
and then they come and get you 
or we bring you to the hospital. 
Or we get ahold of an inpatient 
or outpatient service, or we get 
ahold of a different counselor or 
therapist because maybe yours 
isn’t working. You know what 

I mean? We want to pull all the 
resources.”

This area of service offers a 

glimpse of what they want Be Bet-
ter; to be, a place where therapy, 
support and navigation can all 
occur as one cohesive unit. The 
Miskelley’s envision a service 
where a student can take an after-
noon off class and get walk-in 
therapy or family members can 
show up and ask questions about 
how to support their children.

West Michigan is a very 

reserved place, particularly in 
Holland — mental healthcare 
there is hard to figure out and 
even if you get a referral from 
a hospital, it can be difficult to 
get an appointment. And while 

more focus than ever is on men-
tal health, the familiarity and 
maneuverability of the system 
lags behind. 

At the University, it can be 

difficult to find help, too. Even 
with CAPS and a network of 
resources, navigating them 
can be difficult. A nonprofit 
like Be Better; is attempting to 
take the stress out of a stressful 
process.

When a student has to ask 

for help, they’ll be greeted with 
open arms and a single point of 
contact. In a community as large 
as Michigan’s, a service like 
that can prove the difference 
between a positive and negative 
experience.

There’s not much new to 

say about Michigan’s 2020 
defense. 

The numbers tell the story: 

12th in the Big Ten and 89th 
in the country in total defense; 
13th and 96th in passing 
defense. Put simply, the Wol-
verines weren’t good enough, 
especially defending the pass. 

For new defensive backs 

coach 
Steve 
Clinkscale, 

though, what’s past is past. 

“It wasn’t that (the players) 

didn’t want to talk about it,” 
Clinkscale said to reporters 
Thursday. “I didn’t want to talk 
about it. I just really feel like, if 
coach (Jim Harbaugh) is going 

to hire all these coaches, let’s 
be real, he wants a different 
mindset. He wants a different 
attitude, a different approach.”

It seems he got what he 

wanted. 

When the dust settled from 

all the offseason reshuffling, 
his staff consisted of six new 
coaches, and the average age 
plummeted from 46 to 37. One 
presumed goal of that shift 
was to reinvigorate Michi-
gan’s recruiting department, 
and it’s already partially paid 
off with the continued com-
mitment of Will Johnson, a 
five-star cornerback from the 
class of 2022. 

But on the defensive side of 

the ball, the youthful coaching 
staff is targeted at the existing 
players, too. The Wolverines’ 

defensive struggles in 2020 
were just as much schematic 
as they were personnel issues. 
The hope is that the young 
coaches will bring more cre-
ative schemes that play to the 
strengths of the current team 
and don’t leave first-year start-
ing corners without help. More 
specifically, that means pass-
ing downs should feature less 
one-deep man-to-man packag-
es and more zone and pattern-
matching looks. 

“As a defense, you can’t show 

the same things,” fifth-year 
senior safety Brad Hawkins 
said. “You can’t show the same 
pressures and things like that, 
so you gotta disguise, you gotta 
rotate. That’s what we’ve been 
doing, working on in camp, 
just showing different looks. If 

we’re in Cover 2, show Cover 4, 
or things like that.”

Still, those changes take 

time. A team that’s been play-
ing defense one way for five 
years can’t just flip a switch 
and start playing another way. 
Defensive coordinator Mike 
Macdonald, for his part, joined 
the program in January, so 
he had some opportunity to 
introduce the team to his ideas 
during spring ball. Clinkscale, 
though, wasn’t hired until 
May. Even with an entire sum-
mer of studying, a team can’t 
truly learn a new system with-
out reps, so any concepts he 
wanted to bring in have had to 
wait until fall camp. 

Even so, it helps to return 

some experience to the sec-
ondary. Seniors Gemon Green 

and Vincent Gray — who 
struggled in one-on-one cover-
age last season — seem likely 
to spend significant time at 
corner again in 2021. However, 
junior DJ Turner could also 
challenge for snaps on the out-
side. 

Clinkscale also said that 

junior safety Daxton Hill has 
rotated between secondary 
positions in practice. If he 
takes more snaps as a nickel 
corner instead of as a deep 
safety, he should be in a bet-
ter position to leverage the 
athleticism that earned him 
five stars coming out of high 
school. 

“I think the guys are excit-

ed about it, because they see 
how it’s all coming together,” 
Clinkscale said. “I think in 

the spring, they just wanted 
to create a foundation. … And 
now that we have that baseline 
understanding, we’re starting 
to be more creative, and the 
players are really excited about 
it.”

Nobody can be sure what 

that translates to in the imme-
diate term. After last season, it 
was clear that things needed 
to change on defense, and 
obviously, doubts over Har-
baugh’s longevity at Michigan 
have crept in. His gamble with 
assistant coaches this offsea-
son could determine which 
way that question goes. 

“I don’t think he gets the 

credit he deserves,” Clink-
scale said. “So we’re gonna 
go out there and prove people 
wrong.”

For Michigan’s defense, it’s a summer of progress

BRENDAN ROOSE

Michigan’s national 

championship hopes just 
became much more achiev-
able. 

Alongside defenseman 

Owen Power — who was 
earlier this week already 
reported to be returning 
to Ann Arbor — forwards 
Kent Johnson and Matty 
Beniers will come back for 
their sophomore seasons, 
the team announced on 
Twitter. The return of all 
three means that the Wol-
verines will have the first, 
second, and fifth overall 

picks in the 2021 NHL 
Draft as sophomores, as 
well as the No. 4 and No. 
24 picks in defenseman 
Luke Hughes and forward 
Matthew Samoskevich 
coming in as freshmen. 

Sophomore and junior 

forwards Brendan Bris-
son and Johnny Beecher 
— who were selected in 
the first round of the 2020 
and 2019 NHL Drafts, 
respectively — bring the 
total number of first-round 
picks on Michigan’s roster 
to seven. To put that num-
ber into perspective, just 
12 former first-round picks 
were playing on any college 
hockey team last season. 

The return of Power, 

Beniers and Johnson also 
means a return of a large 
portion of the Wolver-
ines’ scoring, as the trio 
combined for 22 of the 
team’s 91 goals and 45 of 
its 165 assists last season. 
Even more, Johnson and 
Beniers often played on a 
line together, putting up 
plus-minuses of +15 and 
+21, respectively. Power, 
for his part, was on Mich-
igan’s top defensive pair-
ing with then-junior Nick 
Blankenburg last season, 
earning a plus-minus of 
+20. 

“Got a really good group 

coming back, a lot of good 

players,” Beniers said 
July 1, when the three 
were still mulling over 
the decision to stay or go. 
“We’re gonna get a real 
run at a national title, I 
think, and I definitely 
want to win a Big Ten 
championship. (Defense-
man Owen Power) is kind 
of leaning towards coming 
back, so that’d be fun if 
he came back and we got 
kind of the whole crew 
back together and gave it 
another go.”

That crew is back 

together now. Whether 
the national championship 
dreams come true is anoth-
er question.

MADELINE HINKLEY/Daily 

Sophomore defenseman Owen powers is among a plethora of first rounders to 
return to Michigan ahead of next season.

Early returns seem to be 

positive for the Michigan 
football team’s new-look 
defense, and an unheralded 
linebacker is at the fore-
front of the unit’s success. 

In a team scrimmage last 

Wednesday, the Wolverines’ 
defense allegedly dominat-
ed, spurring senior receiver 
Ronnie Bell to proclaim 
that the offense “got (their) 
butts kicked.” 

Whether that’s more of 

an indictment of the Michi-
gan offense than it is a fair 
assessment of the defense 
remains to be seen. But 
for now, in the anonym-
ity of Schembechler Hall, 
the Wolverines appear 
confident in the 3-4 base 
scheme implemented by 
new defensive coordinator 
Mike Macdonald, a stark 
shift from the speed-heavy 
system that Don Brown ran 
during his five seasons in 
Ann Arbor. 

“We’re trying to get our 

best players to match their 
best players,” linebackers 
coach George Helow said 
on Thursday. “Who’s your 
best blitzers? Who’s your 
best man-to-man guy? 

Who’s your best run-stop-
pers? Hopefully, you have 
enough packages to be able 

to provide relief to guys and 
get your best 11 out on the 
field at the same time.” 

Perhaps no player has 

reaped the benefits of 
Michigan’s revamped sys-
tem more than Nikhai Hill-

Green. On the heels of a 
strong fall camp, the sopho-
more linebacker is penciled 

in as the starter on the 
weak side, flanking fifth-
year senior Josh Ross. 

“He’s earned the right to 

start,” Helow said. “Does 
everything you ask him 
to do. He’s very coach-

able. He’s playing with his 
hands, downhill and has a 
good understanding of the 

defense and what we’re try-
ing to do.” 

Hill-Green was a non-fac-

tor as a freshman last sea-
son, appearing in just three 
games on special teams. 
The former 3-star recruit 
tackled the offseason with 
the goal of becoming a con-
sistent contributor. Those 
offseason efforts induced 
what Hill-Green recently 
referred to as the best 
camp in his 12-year football 
career, spanning from pee-
wee to college. 

“I really just put my all 

into this time and really to 
myself,” Hill-Green said 
earlier in August. “Really 
just bet on myself. I put 
everything into my nutri-
tion, my film study and just 
being all-in for this team. 
That is really the biggest 
difference. I take this so 
seriously because I just 
want success for my team. 
That’s my ultimate goal.” 

Hill-Green’s growth cer-

tainly comes at a fortuitous 
time for the Wolverines. 
Beyond Ross, Michigan has 

little depth at linebacker, 
especially with freshman 
Junior Colson missing time 
in camp with injury. 

Last year, then-junior 

linebacker Michael Bar-
rett started as the viper, a 
hybrid linebacker/safety 
position. Yet with Macdon-
ald’s schemes supplanting 
Brown’s, the Wolverines 
scrapped the viper in favor 
of a more traditional two 
middle linebacker set — 
opening up an opportunity 
for Hill-Green. While Bar-
rett deals with the learning 
curve, Hill-Green is seeing 
his off-the-field efforts vali-
dated on the gridiron. 

In Saturday’s season-open-

er against Western Michi-
gan, the Wolverines will, at 
last, be able to showcase any 
defensive improvements. 
For Hill-Green, it presents a 
chance to further cement a 
grip on his new role. 

“I’m just hoping to build 

on it,” Hill-Green said. 
“Everyone feels good. The 
energy is high and I feel 
good.” 

Nikhai Hill-Green emerging as key cog in Michigan defense

JARED GREENSPAN

Daily Sports Editor

ALEC COHEN/Daily 

Michigan’s defense could get a boost in 2021 from sophomore linebacker Nikhai Hill-Green. 


Ahead of the 2020 Tokyo 

Olympic Games, The Michi-
gan Daily takes a look at 
Michigan’s olympic athletes 
and their performances at 
the Games, both past and 
present. The data takes a 
deep dive into what coun-
tries Wolverines hail from, 
what sports they perform 
best in and how they stack up 
against their Big Ten rivals.

Michigan students per-

form in the highest arenas 
of college sports. They’re 
also no strangers to shoul-
dering the dreams of their 
countries at the Olympics.

After Friday’s opening 

ceremony, 
29 
Michigan 

athletes will look to join 
Olympic heavyweights like 
Michael Phelps, Gustavo 
Borges and the duo of Meryl 
Davis and Charlie White in 
bringing Olympic glory to 
both their countries and 
their university.

Since 1900, 243 Michigan 

students, future students, 
and alumni have competed 
at the Olympics. The num-
ber of Wolverines at each 
Olympiad has grown over 
time, and 38% of them have 
medaled.

While the majority of 

those 
competitors 
hail 

from the United States and 
Canada, Michigan students 
have represented 32 nations 
at the Games. Wolverines 
from every continent but 
Antarctica have competed 
in an Olympiad. 

Some Michigan Olympi-

ans hail from nations as far 
apart as Nigeria and Ban-
gladesh, while many come 
from 
European 
nations 

like the United Kingdom, 
Ireland, Austria and Hun-
gary. Seven athletes have 
represented Scandinavian 
countries including Fin-
land, Sweden, Norway and 
Denmark.

This 
year, 
Wolverines 

from 12 different coun-
tries 
will 
carry 
their 

nations’ Olympic aspira-
tions, including wrestlers 
Myles Amine (San Marino) 

and Stevan Micic (Serbia). 
Both are the first Michi-
gan students to represent 
their respective countries 
at the Games, and both will 
be coached by Wolverines 
coach Sean Bormet at the 
Games.

Bormet will not be the 

only 
current 
Michigan 

coach in Tokyo, as swim 
coach Mike Bottom, div-
ing coach Mike Hilde and 
men’s 
gymnastics 
coach 

Jordan Gaarenstroom will 
hope to guide their athletes 
to top performances. They 
will coach athletes from 
Yemen, the United States 
and Nigeria, respectively.

In total, Michigan ath-

letes have won 73 gold med-
als — and Americans have 
earned most of them. The 
only 
non-American 
gold 

medal winner was Austra-
lian John Davies in the 1952 
200-meter 
breaststroke. 

Davies 
set 
an 
Olympic 

record in the event, some-
thing Wolverine athletes 
have done 21 times. 

Twelve of those broken 

records belonged to Phelps, 
who attended Michigan but 
did not compete in NCAA 
swimming. The most deco-
rated Olympian in history

gold medals in his illustri-
ous career.

Former shot put record 

holder Ralph Rose earned

als among the Michigan 
community, a more reach-
able six over three Games.

While the athletes head-

ed to Tokyo might not 
challenge for such acclaim 
just yet, some Wolverines 
headed to the games domi-
nated in their sports while 
on campus, including Cana-
dian soccer player Jayde 
Riviere, Canadian swim-
mer Maggie MacNeil, and 
German basketball player 

Moritz Wagner, the first 
Michigan Olympian from 
his country.

Swimming, diving and 

track and field have been 
the bread and butter of 
Michigan 
Olympians. 

Eighty 
Wolverines 
have 

competed in swimming, 
20 have dived and 67 have 
performed in track and 
field 
events.Michigan’s 

first Olympians — John 
McLean, Howard Hayes, 
Charles Dvorak and Char-
lie Leiblee — all competed 
in track and field for the 
United States. 

Some of these athletes 

come from South America. 
Five Peruvians competed 
in swimming and diving 
events, but none were able 
to medal. Guyanese sprint-
er Adam Harris competed 
in 2008’s Beijing Games, 
while two Brazlians have 
earned 
four 
medals 
in 

swimming.

From Asia, two of three 

Wolverine 
Olympians 

competed in swimming or 
diving. The other was Ban-
gladeshi 
gymnast 
Syque 

Caesar. This year, Siobhan 
Haughey and Jamie Yeung 
will add Hong Kong to 
that list as they compete in 
swimming.

Outside of those popular 

events, Michigan athletes 
have participated in the 
more unique competitions 
across 
Olympic 
history. 

American decathlete Ken 
Doherty captured bronze 
in 1928, while Eeles Land-
strom competed in the 
event for Finland in 1952.

Five-time All-American 

Steve Bastien will be the 
first Michigan athlete to 
compete in the decathlon 
in 69 years at this year’s 
games. He qualified for 
the event with one of the 
best athletic displays of 
his career, setting person-

al bests in seven of the 10 
events. Now he shifts his 
focus to breaking those 
records again on a much 
more 
intense 
stage 
in 

Tokyo.

Some 
Wolverines 
will 

appear in their first Olym-
piad this month. Michi-
gan’s 
record 
for 
most 

Olympics belongs to Turk-
ish swimmer Derya Buyu-
kuncu, who competed six 
times from 1992 to 2012 but 
was unable to earn a medal. 
He was the first Wolverine 
from Turkey to compete at 
the Olympics.

Despite the plethora of 

Michigan athletes in the 
Olympics, 
the 
Paralym-

pics have only recently 
seen Wolverines compete. 
Jerome Singleton compet-
ed in 2008 and 2012, earn-
ing silver and gold track 
medals 
for 
the 
United 

States at his first Olympi-
ad. Zach Burns won a sil-

ver medal in rowing at the 
2016 Rio Olympics. Non-
Americans from Michigan 
have not competed at the 
Paralympics yet.

Andy Potts, an Olympic 

triathlete who placed 22nd 
for Team USA in 2004, 
will compete as a guide for 
American 
paratriathlete 

Kyle Coon. After beating 
dominant 
paratriathlete 

Aaron Schneidies for the 
first time earlier this year, 
Coon and Potts could claim 
gold medals at the end of 
their event.

When the opening cer-

emonies conclude, Michi-
gan will see its students, 
coaches and alumni pursue 
their Olympic dreams for 
nations scattered all across 
the Earth. They will join a 
long list of Wolverines to 
participate in the games, 
and some will likely add to 
the 160 medals they have 
accumulated.

Olympic tradition includes Wolverines from across the globe

U-M Olympians across the globe: Olympians associated with the University have competed for 32 countries. 

With a Central Michigan 

forward streaking toward 
the goal, senior defender 
Sydney 
Shepherd 
found 

herself in a jam. Shepherd 
paced just a few inches 
behind the attacker, who 
saw nothing but open grass 

ahead and eight minutes 
left in the game.

As the forward pre-

pared to fire a shot past 
senior 
goalkeeper 
Izzy 

Nino, Shepherd made her 
move. She swept toward 
the ball, pushing around 
the attacker to break up 
the play.

The only chance the 

Chippewas could muster 
was snuffed out. The ensu-
ing free kick was easily 
saved by Nino, and the No. 
18 Michigan women’s soc-
cer team won 1-0.

From the start of the 

game, the backline of Shep-
herd, senior Janiece Joyner 
and junior Jayde Riviere 
controlled the pitch.

Much of this came from 

maneuvering 
around 

attacking players. Wheth-
er they boxed them out or 
shook them off with fancy 
footwork, the trio would 
give the Chippewas just 
one or two touches before 
winning it back and lob-
bing the ball to an open 
Wolverine midfielder.

Michigan didn’t force 

the play, however, choos-
ing to keep possession and 
rotate back. These came 
often, as the Wolverines’ 
speed kept Central Michi-

gan playing from catch up.

“I think the backline 

was really cohesive the 
entire game,” Shepherd 
said. “But I can give a lot 
of credit to the holding 
mids and the midfield that 
dropped back and played a 
big role in staying tucked 
and together defensively. 
We’ve really been working 
on staying together as a 
unit in training, so I think 
it all kind of came through 
this weekend.”

That teamwork led to 

a 26-1 shot-attempt dis-
parity. However, commu-
nication seemed to fall 
apart deeper in the offen-
sive zone. Multiple times, 
Michigan attackers found 
an overwhelming chance 
but ran offside, squander-
ing the opportunity. This 
even caused a goal to be 
disallowed late in the sec-
ond half.

Part of that came from 

the very root of their style: 
aggressive play. With mul-
tiple Wolverines swarm-
ing the goal, there were 
more players to manage. 
Michigan 
struggled 
to 

find a solution to break 
them 
down 
throughout 

the game.

Other problems surfaced 

when the Wolverines took 
longer passes. With more 
time to track the ball, the 
Chippewas broke up many 
passes to deep midfield-
ers, putting more weight 
on Michigan’s defenders. 
While they handled this 
with no panic, substitu-
tions came quickly and 
often to keep them from 
wearing out, and to put 
the pressure on Central 
Michigan.

With so much posses-

sion time, the Wolverines 
remained 
frustrated 
as 

the game continued, and 
Chippewas’s 
goalkeeper 

Allison Lapoint gobbled 
up shot after shot. She 
single-handedly kept the 
game within reach.

Early in the second half, 

fifth-year midfielder Nicki 
Hernandez faced Lapoint 
one-on-one, with yards of 
open net on both sides. She 
shot across, and finally, 
Lapoint couldn’t get there 
in time. A tinny clang rang 
through the stadium as 
the ball bounced off of the 
goalpost and was cleared 
by Central Michigan. Her-
nandez put her hands to 
her head. She would even-
tually break through with 

the game’s only goal on 
a quick pass from junior 
forward Lily Farkas in the 
63rd minute.

“I think we just need 

to get some better timing, 
timing within our move-
ment, speed of our passes,” 
Michigan coach Jennifer 
Klein said. “I think we’ll 
clean a lot of that up. The 
ideas are right, and now 
it’s just making sure we 
can get the execution.”

Michigan entered Sun-

day’s game with an expec-
tation to win the game 
handily. While the defense 
performed like a brick 
wall, the offense couldn’t 
find the same rhythm.

Let’s Get Moving Again, Together!

For the Michigan football program, the 

start of fall camp in 2021 carries a different 
tone than it has in years past. 

The general mood, of course, remains 

the same: optimistic. With the blank slate 
of a new season comes new visions and 
new possibilities. The shortcomings of 
the previous campaign are distant enough 
in the past — and the threat of Ohio State 
distant enough in the future — to believe 
they’ve been potentially fixed enough for 
the Wolverines to take a step forward in 
the new year. 

But for 2021, that step forward comes 

from unfamiliar territory. Whereas in 
Harbaugh’s previous campaigns, Michi-
gan hoped to finally bridge the gap with 
the nation’s elite (and, to an extent, some 
level of success felt certain), the vast disap-
pointment of 2020 means this season’s fall 
camp carries more tempered expectations. 
Whether or not the coaches want to admit 
it, the Wolverines aren’t destined for a con-
ference title in 2021. Mostly, they’ll just be 
looking to compete. 

A lot of that improvement will have to 

start in the run game. Last season, Michi-
gan mustered just 131.5 rushing yards per 
game, good for 95th in the country and 11th 
in the Big Ten. Even worse, the Wolverines 
put up those numbers with a running-back 
room that was, by all accounts, fairly deep. 
From there, the run game becomes a ques-
tion of coaching and offensive line play. 

“I think we were productive at times,” 

offensive coordinator Josh Gattis said. “The 
issue is, we didn’t run the ball enough. … 
We just had two or three games where we 
had under 20 carries a game, and so your 
numbers, comparatively, when you look at 
them at the end of the season, they’re gonna 
be low.”

Gattis is correct that there were two 

games in 2020 — against Indiana and 
Wisconsin — where Michigan ran the ball 
fewer than 20 times. But looking at the 
numbers, choosing to throw the ball more 
at the time made sense, as the Wolver-
ines averaged 0.7 and 2.5 yards per carry 
against the Hoosiers and Badgers, respec-
tively. They finished both of those games 
with under 50 yards on the ground, but 
even if they had run it more, that wouldn’t 

have made any difference in the offense’s 
success. 

Realistically, growth will have to come 

on the offensive line, and although there’s 
a decent amount of depth in that position 
group, the most talented players remain 
young and unproven. Some, like current 
sophomore Zak Zinter, whom Gattis has 
anointed as potentially being Michigan’s 
best offensive player, were thrown into the 
fire last season after injuries derailed the 
starting lineup, while others, like junior 
Trente Jones, have yet to see significant 
playing time. Their development will be 
crucial to any growth in the run game in 
2021. 

“Our depth at the offensive line position, 

I think that’s a strength,” Gattis said. “… We 
feel like we’ve got almost eight guys that 
can compete for a starting job, and obvious-
ly we’ve got some high-level players there.”

There’s also, of course, Sherrone Moore’s 

move to coaching the offensive line. His 
predecessor — Ed Warinner, now the run-
game coordinator at Florida Atlantic — was 
generally well-respected in college football 
as a skilled tactician, so Moore does have 
some pretty big shoes to fill. Still, at just 35 
years old and as a former offensive lineman 
himself, he brings a different perspective to 
his unit that could help with player devel-
opment. 

“I think the younger guys really appre-

ciate it,” fifth-year senior offensive line-
man Andrew Stueber said in March. “It’s 
become a more open-room environment, 
you can ask a lot more questions, and he 
knows from experience, too. I think also 
the older guys are liking the new kind of 
energy and vibe he’s bringing to the room, 
the practice field, and just his overall ener-
gy.”

Whether that translates into success, 

though, is yet to be seen. Even if the Wol-
verines aren’t expected to compete for a 
national championship in 2021, the run 
game cannot remain stagnant. That could 
be complicated by injuries and youth 
on the offensive line, but sooner or later, 
that unit will need to find something that 
works. 

“The 2020 offense is gonna look dif-

ferent than the 2021 offense,” Gattis said. 
“Because you have to shape that to the 
identity of your team.”

One way or another, that identity will be 

forged in the trenches.

run game in the trenches

Following last season’s heart-

breaking overtime loss in the 
National Championship Game to 
North Carolina, the No. 2 Michigan 
field hockey team entered this week-
end’s Big Ten/ACC Challenge with a 
chip on its shoulder.

This time, the matchup against 

the Tarheels would end differently.

Strong defense and precise goal-

keeping put the Wolverines in the 
driver’s seat for much of its 3-2 victo-
ry over No. 1 North Carolina on Fri-
day. That same aggressive defense 
helped Michigan blank No. 11 Wake 
Forest 2-0 on Sunday.

Against the Tarheels, familiar 

foes felt each other out as the game 
began, and it seemed like both 
teams waited for an opportunity 
to strike. Michigan found one first 
when freshman midfielder Alana 
Richardson chipped in a rebound 
from senior forward Tina D’Anjolell 
shortly before the first period 
expired. 

D’Anjolell added her own tally 

around ten minutes later, and she 
notched a goal and an assist against 
the Demon Deacons on Sunday. 
However, it wasn’t just her ability to 
score that helped her team capture 
difficult wins.

“She’s very fast, and she’s a senior 

so she’s very experienced,” Michi-
gan coach Marcia Pankratz said. “… 
She set the tone on defense because 
she can close them down, which 
helps our defense create turnovers.”

Much of D’Anjolell’s success came 

from overwhelming opponents with 
quick passes and unpredictable foot-
work. Each time a defender shifted 
their positioning and prepared to 
stymy a Michigan threat, she — and 
the rest of the team — changed on 
the fly to create shots. Time after 
time, opposing defenders came up 
with no answer.

This game plan originated largely 

from Michigan’s energy. The Wol-
verines used speed and aggression 
to control the game, frustrating 

opposing forwards.

“Our team embraces that type of 

play,” Pankratz said. “… We know if 
we get the other team’s head down, 
that they’re not going to be able to 
perform the tactics that they want 
because we put them under so much 
pressure.”

Early on, the defense was able to 

keep up with opposing threats and 
get the ball out of their zone. But, by 
the third and fourth quarters, North 
Carolina and Wake Forest main-
tained possession for longer, stretch-
ing out Michigan’s defenders and 
looking for seams in tight coverage. 
The Wolverines started falling a step 
behind attackers and struggled to 
make clean exits from their 25-yard 
zone.

Michigan had to lean on the depth 

of its defenders to overcome this, 
shifting to a more reserved style 
against later possessions. Junior mid-
fielder Nina Apoola and sophomore 
back Serena Brimacombe both used 
their positioning to slash the angles 
that opposing forwards could choose.

This overall defensive structure 

complemented transitions back to 
the Wolverines’ normal, aggres-
sive play. As the team collapsed into 
tighter zones, both the Tarheels’ and 
Demon Deacons’ explosive offenses 
came up empty-handed on chance 
after chance, and the Wolverines 
started playing tighter coverage as 
the opponents tired. 

This wasn’t just the Wolverines 

showing off their offseason train-
ing; this showed targeted growth 
of their defensive capabilities. They 
scored the same amount of goals this 
time against North Carolina as they 
did last season, but they slashed their 

goals-against in half.

“… Even if the ball does get 

through the forward line, I know 
I can trust my midfielders enough 
for them to step up,” D’Anjolell said. 
“And then we can counterattack and 
score the goals that we need.”

Perhaps the greatest indicator of 

this was Michigan’s containment of 
two-time NFHCA National Player 
of the Year Erin Matson. The for-
ward scored two goals in last year’s 
championship game — including the 
game winner. This time around, the 
defense stopped her from putting a 
shot on net.

For the opponents who managed 

to squeeze off shots, senior goal-
keeper Anna Spieker stood like a 
brick wall, challenging forwards as 

they came into her zone all weekend. 
This brazen strategy forced many 
high shots that soared over the net.

Michigan’s performance wasn’t 

all perfection, as the Tarheels were 
able to score goals by pinning the 
Wolverines twice and pouncing on 
minor positioning mistakes, includ-
ing a close call as time expired 
against North Carolina.

These proved to be the exception, 

not the rule. Momentum swayed 
back toward the Wolverines after 
each goal, and a loss seemed surpris-
ingly out of the question against two 
of the best teams in the country.

For Michigan, this weekend 

wasn’t about proving it can handle 
the nation’s best, nor was it about 
simply establishing a good start to 
the season. It was about proving that 
the Wolverines were a new team on 
both sides of the field.

And Michigan’s performance 

shouted that message.

Carolina, one of two wins this weekend.

Stepping up on the block, 
I wait for the whistle that 
commands my body to get in 
a diving position. Next to the 
five other swimmers lined up 
on the blocks, I curl my toes 
and squeeze my hands on 
the edge of the block when I 
hear the second whistle. Go. 
I push off in a horizontal dive 
into the water and immedi-
ately start dolphin kicking 
to the surface. As my head 
comes out of the water, I re-
alize something is missing: 
my swim cap. 

I’ve loved the water since I 
was a kid. My dad threw me 
in the pool when I was nine 
months old and suddenly, I 
could float. When I am sub-
merged in the water, it feels 
like time stops. It comforts 
me to be surrounded by 
water, knowing that it was 
there to support me even if I 
couldn’t support myself. 

I was 12 when I decided to 
start 
swimming 
competi-

tively, and that’s where I met 
my first swim coach: Kwame. 
When we were too slow to get 
in the water, Kwame would 
yell “SPARTA!” and kick us in 
the pool. When I fell asleep 
doing dryland workouts, he 
poured a bucket of water on 
me to wake me up. He always 
made us play soccer because 
it would help us with our 
kicking skills — although 
sometimes I think Kwame 
just wanted to play soccer. 
Kwame not only taught me 
how to swim all 4 strokes — 
freestyle, backstroke, breast-
stroke and butterfly — but 
most importantly, he taught 

with a tough coach who was 
known for molding champi-
on swimmers. 

Joining this new team was 
a wake-up call for me in the 
swimming world. I swam 
year-round, so when high 
school season was over, the 
club season began. Even 
though I was able to score 
points for my high school 
team, I never ranked high 

enough on my club team to 
even compete for points. All 
the swimmers were consid-
erably faster than me and 
I was always delegated to 
the last lane, the slow lane. 
These swimmers had started 
swimming as early as five 
years old and their parents 
spent the extra time and 
money on private coaching 
and the best training equip-
ment on the market. I was 
years late to the game and I 
qualified for free lunch in my 
school district, which did not 
always make the most nutri-
tional meals for high-inten-
sity swimming. Any time I 
tried to rest, the main coach 
— an old white man — and as-
sistant coaches would scold

me how to have fun even in 
difficult situations. 

I met my closest friends, Dur-
ga and Eva, at the community 
swim team. During practices, 
we would encourage each 
other to go faster and com-
plain about how sore we 
were afterward. We declared 
ourselves the “Mermaid Sis-
ters” and would practice our 
backflips in the water as if we 
were magical — no one could 
tell us otherwise.

In the water, I was both 
weightless and powerful all 
at once as I glided through 
the water and barely broke 
the surface to reach the oth-
er side. And I only wanted to 
get better. I never felt lonely 
or the slightest out of place, 
because I was surrounded by 
my closest friends and swim 
coach, who were all people of 
color. Although most people 
I practiced with looked like 
me, this was not the case out-
side of my community team. 

Whenever I told my Black 
friends in high school that I 
was on the swim team, they 
would respond with some-
thing along the lines of, 
“Girl, I could never! I don’t 
even know how to swim, 
and I don’t want to mess up 
my hair.” As a young BIPOC 
swimmer, I was looking 
for role models to follow in 
swimming — a field domi-
nated by white athletes in 
America — and that’s when 
I looked to social media. In-
stagram had introduced me 
to Lia Neal years before she 
became the first African-
American and Asian-Ameri-
can swimmer to compete in 
the Olympics for the United 

States, but even then, I saw 
myself in Neal: a mixed-race 
athlete who aspired to great-
ness. Since I also come from 
a mixed-race background, 
Neal was my swimming idol 
and I wanted to break re-

cords just like her. At the 
same time, I learned about 
Stanford University swim-
ming commit Simone Manu-
el, who would go on to be the 
first African American wom-
an to win an Olympic gold 
medal in swimming. Seeing 
Neal and Manuel succeed in 
swimming made me believe 
I could, too, thrive as a com-
petitive swimmer.

After a couple of years of 
swimming with Kwame, I 
realized swim practices were 
not challenging me as much 
as I wanted. If I wanted to 
get faster, I needed to make 
a change. As I entered high 
school, I decided to join a 
competitive club swim team 

How can I extend an

and tranquility yet trampled

centuries-old fruit bearer, 
ripped from its roots, as 
though it holds no weight, no 
meaning. 

I’ve been lucky enough to be

me for missing even one set 
despite not knowing my limi-
tations. “Why didn’t you go?” 
they had said. “Everyone else 
is making the set, why aren’t 
you?” This unhelpful criti-
cism and more like it felt like 
personal attacks on my work 
ethic as an athlete. As a re-
sult, I pushed myself past my 
limits to make the interval 
times — even when I would 
be so behind that I had no 

breaks in between sets — in 
hopes that I would get faster.

Ultimately, this effort back-
fired on my mental and phys-
ical health. I ended up hav-
ing a panic attack every time 
I went to practice and, in 
order to prioritize my well-
being, I had to quit the com-
petitive team and join a team 
that was less rigorous. How-
ever, the cost of this club was 
much more than I could af-
ford. I ended up working for 
this club as a swim instructor 
in order to afford the cost to 
practice with the team, but 
the work-life balance was 
not ideal. I was so tired most 
days I could barely muster 
up the energy to go to prac-

tice after a full day of school 
and work. 
In high school, I was swim-
ming almost 20 hours a week 
during the season, which in-
cluded daily 5 a.m. practices, 
dryland workouts and week-
end practices. After my high 
school swim season finished, 
I would have swim practice 
for three hours every day af-
ter school and on the week-
ends when there weren’t 
swim meets. I tried to love 
swimming in its competitive 
form, I really did. But while 
swimming used to be an ac-
tivity associated with joy, 
friendships and community, 
it now brought about memo-
ries of panic attacks, asthma 
attacks, several muscle inju-
ries and regret. And, amid all 
the emotional and physical 
labor, my swim cap would 
never stay on my head.

When I put my hair into a 
bun, a regular-sized swim 
cap would stretch to its lim-
its and then slide off the 
more time I spent in the wa-
ter. After one lap, I would of-
ten have to readjust my cap 
or dive to the bottom of the 
pool to retrieve it. Once, at a 
swim meet, I was swimming 
the 100-yard butterfly — a 
very difficult race — and my 
swim cap slid off my head. 
All of my hair fell out onto 
my back and weighed me 
down as I desperately tried 
to reach the other side of 
the pool. As this became a 
regular occurrence, everyone 
would joke about swim caps 
not being able to stay on my 
head. My new coach even 
jokingly told me that I should 
get my cap “stapled to my 
head” so it would stop falling 
off. I tried everything from 
using fewer hair products to 
buying an extra-large swim 
cap — which broke as soon 
as I put it on — but nothing 
seemed to work.

and hear the innocent chil-
dren as they screamed at 
soldiers to put them down. 
After crossing the Allenby 
bridge at the Jordanian bor-
der and waiting for over a 
day at military checkpoints 
in the occupied West Bank 
with nausea sweeping over 
me through the countless 
bumpy bus rides, we had fi-
nally arrived at my grand-
parents’ house in the small 
village of Kifl Haris. They 
immediately greeted me: my 
sitti with her warm embrace, 
and my sido lifting me up into 
the air while screams of joy 
escaped me, my fatigue su-
perseded by the excitement 
of seeing my estranged fam-
ily. When he finally put me 
down, the sound of a small 

kitten drew me near the back 
of the house. In an attempt 
to follow the soft purrs, I 
stumbled upon their colorful 
garden, pervaded by plants I 
did not know the names of. 
Treading through the greens 
with careful steps, the leaves 
of the fruits and flowers 
brushed over the back of my 
hand, tickling me as though 
they longed for the presence 
of a child among them. Us-
ing one of the purple plas-
tic chairs lying on the back 
deck, I stood to reach grape 
vines hanging above me and 
climbed trees to pluck sweet 
figs and bitter pomegran-
ates. My arms overflowing 
with fruit and with a kitten 
in tow, I emerged 15 minutes 
later with the biggest smile 
plastered onto my face. See-
ing how much I adored their 
garden, 
my 
grandparents 

were excited to introduce 
me to their eminent glory: 
their olive tree groves. After 
freshening up, we all piled 
into my grandpa’s 10-year-
old Volkswagen that rattled 
at every turn. As we drove 
the short distance together, I 
was awestruck by the majes-
tic mountains that crowned 
the landscape and the palm 
trees that lined the streets. 
Children played soccer with 
a makeshift ball while sol-
diers strapped with AK-47s 
loomed in the background.

As we approached our desti-
nation, I nearly jumped out 
of the moving car as I got a 
glimpse of what awaited me. 
The beautiful earthy green 
field was filled with olive 
trees standing tall, laden with 
olives and stretching beyond 
the corners of my eyes. Wav-
ing at me in the breeze, they 
begged me to climb up their 
strong limbs and pluck their 
olives gently. For the second 
time that day, I was com-
pletely blown away by the 
scene that surrounded me. 
As I ran towards the first tree 
I laid eyes on, standing on 
my tiptoes to reach the tall 
branches, my sido hauled me 
up on his shoulders. While I 
struggled to grab as many as 
I could, my sido grabbed my 
wrist and set me back down. 
He explained why we don’t 
pick olives one by one — there 
are simply too many of them 
on each tree. Instead, with 
his instruction, we spread 
out a few white cloth sheets 
underneath the tree. As my 
sido beat the olive tree with 
his wooden cane, the sheet-
covered ground beneath us 
quickly filled with black and 
green olives. While I sorted 
through the ripe black ol-
ives and put away the firm 
green ones that still had to 
be cured, the olives gleamed 
under the scorching sun. I 
suddenly wondered if my an-

cestors also experienced this 
feeling of inner peace at this 
very spot while they sorted 
through olives like me. 

While we worked, my sido 
told me stories about the 
history of the land: ancient 
prophets who roamed the 
lush fields centuries ago, the 
religious significance of the 
monotheistic faiths associ-
ated with the region and the
Crusades that were fought 

not far from where we were 
standing. His face was over-
taken with a childlike marvel 
when describing the spiri-
tual aura surrounding the 
Al-Aqsa mosque and golden 
Dome of Rock, but the light 
in his eyes dimmed when he 
mentioned the Gaza Strip, 
which was still under com-
plete siege. This meant that 
little kids like me had re-
stricted access to clean water 
to wash their favorite shirts 
or take baths with their 
toys. They were forbidden 
from getting too close to the 
beach, even on a bright sum-
mer day. They were denied 
usage of electricity to watch 
TV as their family shared 
breakfast or stay up late to 
play computer games. They 
were barred from traveling 
for vacations or leaving Gaza 
to visit family. They were 
stripped of the opportunity 
to grow up and attend col-
lege or carry dreams for their 
future. As I listened to my 
sido in silence, blood rushed 
to my head and tears welled 
up in my eyes. I gripped each 
olive harder, afraid that they 
would fall out of my trem-
bling hands and smash on 
the ground. How could the 
world remain silent as chil-
dren suffered under such 
brutal conditions?

“
How can I remain 
silent when an 
apartheid power is 
actively profiting 
off of the conquest 
of my land? How 
can I be asked to 
“understand both 
sides” when a colo-
nizer still denies 
me access to the 
land my ancestors 
called home less 
than 73 years ago?

“Dear Susan Muaddi Darraj,

My name is Reem Hassan, 
and I am a first-year un-
dergraduate student at the 
University of Michigan-Ann 
Arbor. I identify as a Mus-
lim 
Palestinian 
American 

woman, and I am currently 
studying on a pre-law track 
with hopes of majoring in 
public policy and minoring 
in Arab and Muslim Ameri-
can Studies. I was first intro-
duced to your piece “It’s Not 
an Oxymoron” during my 
first semester in university, 
where I took an introduc-
tory course to women’s and 
gender studies (WGS). To 
say the least, I found myself 
absolutely astounded by your 
work. Having registered for 
the course on a whim and 
expecting to only mildly re-
late to the material, I was 
shocked to be so completely 
moved by our first reading. I 

Intersectional

feminism
is real and alive

REEM HASSAN
MiC Columnist

explicitly remember feeling 
as though you had taken my 
thoughts on the intersection 
of my Arab identity on my 
feminist experience straight 
out of my head and put it on 
paper. I felt heard. Your short 
piece had the ability to influ-
ence my work for the rest of 
that semester and inspired 
me to take my understanding 
to new and deeper levels and 
enroll in our Arab American 
Feminists course this semes-
ter. Upon interacting with 
your piece yet again this se-
mester, I was reminded of 
why it had such an impact on 
me, and how deeply I reso-
nate with your story.” 

This is an excerpt taken 
from one of the first “Femi-
nist Love Letters” I wrote 
last semester while taking 
an Arab American Feminists 
course with Professor Char-
lotte Karem Albrecht — an 

absolute icon in the WGS de-
partment. We were asked to 
address a “love letter” to one 
of the authors we had read in 
class, both celebrating and 
critiquing their work. I was 
immediately drawn to write 
to Susan Muaddi Darraj, who 
authored “It’s Not an Oxy-
moron: The Search for an 
Arab Feminism.”

****

Although I have always con-
sidered my feminist awak-
ening as something deeply 
personal, I have come to 
learn that many other Arab 
American women empower 
themselves in a similar ex-
perience. It is an experi-
ence where we constantly 
question the grounds upon 
which we are allowed to call 
ourselves feminists, where 
we never feel as though we 
are allowed to call ourselves 

such a phrase because of 
western impositions onto the 
definition of feminism, and 
where we live an experience 
that we never feel like we 
have the right to articulate. 
In all truth, “Middle East-
ern” (in quotations because 
the phrase is a colonial in-
vention that I am not exactly 
fond of ) or Arab women are 
not exactly regarded as the 
token feminist figures in the 
western lens. We are forced 
to carry a stereotyped repu-
tation of arranged marriages, 
housework, oppression, be-
ing forced to cover up and 
countless other baseless tags 
and labels. And beyond this, 
even after I have finally come 
to understand what femi-
nism really entailed, it was 
something that was treated 
with so much animosity by 
the people around me. In 
high school, boys amped up 
their “women belong in the 
kitchen” jokes and poked fun 
at the girls who identified as 
feminists for being “crazy.” 
Girls who were not inter-
ested in saying anything else 
only laughed with them. I re-
member watching in disgust 
and confusion as girls at my 
school — some of whom were 
even my friends — would 
proudly announce that they 
don’t consider themselves 
feminists just so that they’d 
be applauded by the boys. I 
could not fathom why they 
chose to view feminism as a 
surface-level ideology, fixat-
ing on buzzwords like “man-
hating” and “wage gap” 
while overlooking the soci-
etal benefits from the over-
arching goals of women’s lib-
eration. 

On the other hand, I realized 
that feminism came so natu-
rally to me because it did not 

defy the values or the prac-
tices that I was raised upon — 
it actually gave them a name. 
I grew up in a household 
where my sisters and I were 
encouraged to shoot for the 
stars and be ambitious with 
our goals, to defy gendered 
career expectations and to 
never give in to socially con-
structed gender roles. Both 
of my parents worked full 
time and distributed chores 
among themselves equal-
ly. I grew up watching my 
dad cook and clean and my 
brothers being given equal 
responsibility in maintaining 
the home. The contradictory 
attitudes that I encountered 
while coming to terms with 
my feminist identity motivat-
ed me to take Introduction 
to Women’s Studies upon 
starting at the University of 
Michigan. 

While much of the class 
was introducing and giving 
names to basic concepts like 
intersectionality, patriarchy 
and male-gaze, I noticed 
a vast difference between 
the backgrounds of the stu-
dents who were enrolled in 
the course and how that in-
fluenced the ways in which 
they absorbed and compre-
hended the course mate-
rial. I found myself engaged 
in productive conversation 
with students of color more 
than I did with the white 
students in the course. Dur-
ing the weekly discussion 
sections where we would 
share individual interpreta-
tions of the readings based 
on our own experience, I 
was shocked by how unin-
formed many of my white, 
straight, financially privi-
leged, cisgender classmates 
were about the struggles that 
marginalized 
communities 

confront without reflecting 
on their own privileges. And 
while I would never deny the 
fact that objectively, being a 
woman in itself is a margin-
alized identity that suffers 
from patriarchal oppression, 
for me and other women of 
color, it is our intersecting 
identities that really amplify 
the impacts of being a wom-
an. The yearning to have 
conversations 
with 
more 

people who understood how 
my intersectionality impact-
ed my feminist experience 
prompted me to enroll in an 
upper-level Arab American 
Feminism course during my 
second semester. 

One of the most important 
themes that Susan touches 
upon in her writing — also 
reiterated 
throughout 
al-

most every lesson of my 
WGS classes — is the role 
that white western feminism 
plays in aiding the misun-
derstanding of women who 
are not white, Western, cis-
gender, financially privileged 
or straight. White western 
feminism is a one-dimen-
sional ideology that fails to 
regard the ways in which a 
person’s intersecting identi-
ties influence their feminist 
experience. It applies the 
same European/U.S.-centric 
critiques to populations and 
cultures all over the world, 
failing to account for differ-
ent cultural practices and 
traditions in the fight for 
gender equality. In the words 
of Susan, it places an em-
phasis on the experience of 
“liberated, assertive Western 
women with voices” while 
depicting women from the 
global south as women who 
are in need of liberation from 
their oppressive societies.

When I sat down with Moon 
Choe, owner and operator 
of Moon Cafe, a Korean res-
taurant and frozen yogurt 
shop on State Street, for a 
40-minute interview, I’ll ad-
mit I expected something 
of a sob story: a few cliché 
sentiments 
about 
being 

down on his luck and need-
ing students to stop by so he 
can pay the bills. What I got 
instead was a chance to gain 
new insights on laissez-faire 
parenting, the subtle rac-
ism that is a hallmark of the 
immigrant experience and 
the private joys he is able to 
embrace from the COVID-19 
pandemic, among other top-
ics of discussion. Choe is full 
of surprising wisdom, which 
he dishes out freely, sans 
condescension.

As soon as you walk in, Moon 
Cafe comforts you. The walls 
are painted yellow and pur-
ple, clashing with the black-
and-white 
checkerboard 

floor. Large-framed, abstract 
art prints hang on the walls, 
and the entire stretch of a 
mantel piece is lined with 
small figurines. The eclec-
tic interior reminds me of 
the yummy hole-in-the-wall 
eateries my friends and I 
frequented during our high 
school years back at home 
and immediately assuages 
those requisite nerves I feel 
as a newcomer to the jour-
nalism scene.

Choe is in his early 60s and, 
despite his gray hair, looks 
much younger than his years. 
On the afternoon that I walk 
into his shop, he wears wire 
glasses, a yellow University 
of Michigan hoodie (like 
the true Michigan dad he 
is) with a few sauce stains, 
comfy sweatpants and pad-
ded slides with Puma socks. 
He’s dressed, in other words, 

for a long shift at the restau-
rant. Choe is thoughtful and 
very eloquent. Though he 
gestures for me to take a seat 
at the booth in front of him, 
he never quite settles into the 
bench facing me. Instead, he 
hovers by it, always ready to 
take a call or hand a custom-
er their order.

I’m caught off guard when 
Choe begins the interview by 
throwing me the first ques-
tion: he wants to know what 
my position at The Michigan 
Daily is. I tell him I’m a Se-
nior MiC Editor, and he nods 
and replies that his daughter, 
Gina, also used to hold a Se-
nior Editor position at The 
Daily during her undergrad-
uate years. In our brief con-
versation, he mentions his 
children’s academic achieve-
ments several times. I can 
tell by the way he casually 
namedrops “neuroscience at 

Princeton” that he speaks of 
his son and daughter fondly 
and often.

Much of Choe’s identity is, in 
many ways, tied to his role as 
a father and husband. Short-
ly into our conversation, 
Choe takes a phone order 

and calls out to the kitchen: 
“Yeobo? Spicy pork!” (Yeobo 
is a pet name, roughly trans-
lated from Korean to “dar-
ling” or “honey.”) Later, she 
calls him dangshin — another 
sweet term of endearment — 
when they’re working in the 
kitchen together. While try-
ing to put into words what 
it’s like to work with his wife, 
he chuckles and says, “I can-
not think of any bad things. 
Just wake up early in the 
morning, eat together — we 
always eat together … there’s 
no special meaning, we’re 
just married … and then we 
spend time together. That’s 
it.” The restaurant is a two-
person operation. Last year, 
they employed a couple U-M 
students part-time, but now, 
since business is slower than 
usual, it’s just Choe and his 
wife, Yoon, running the cafe.

Choe and Yoon, along with 

their son and daughter, im-
migrated to America from 
South Korea nearly 15 years 
ago and eventually settled in 
Ann Arbor, Mich. During his 
career, Choe worked in the 
automotive industry for 32 
years. (His engineering back-
ground shows in the way he 

tends to speak in exact fig-
ures, precise times and per-
centages.) When he retired a 
couple years back, he decided 
he wanted to take on “fresh 
and new” work. “My (chil-
dren) grew up here in Ann 
Arbor … so it is our town,” he 
tells me. He decided to open 
a frozen yogurt shop to meet 
new students, and he calls 
this new job a different 
type of “good stress.”

In addition to frozen yo-
gurt, Moon Cafe serves Ko-
rean food, which according 
to Choe, is simply “healthy 
food… It’s homemade, like 
Mom’s cooking.” There are, 
however, many other Ko-
rean restaurants in Ann Ar-
bor. When I ask Choe what 
makes his restaurant differ-
ent from the others, I expect 
him to tell me that he has 
some special recipe passed 
down from his ancestors or 
even that he also serves fro-
zen yogurt — which is so de-
licious that it’s a valid point, 
in my opinion. But instead, 
he refuses to justify my ques-
tion with an answer, out of 

solidarity with the other Ko-
rean spots on campus. “Ko-
rean food is Korean food. I 
respect the restaurants… we 
work all together,” he says.

Growing up as a first-gen-
eration Korean American 
in the Korean church, I was 
taught to think of others 
first: take care of the younger 
ones in our community, be 
on standby to help my par-
ents whenever needed, don’t 
start eating until the eldest at 
the table takes the first bite. 
In my family, love was often, 
and almost always, sacrifi-
cial. And while I am incred-
ibly grateful for my back-
ground and recognize the 
character and values it has 
instilled in me, I think it also 
gradually conditioned me to 
disregard myself and my own 
needs. I quietly taught my-
self I never needed to be at 
the center. Seeking help was 
unnecessary, self-indulgence 
was never the answer and 
the extent of my daily pro-
ductivity was a measure of 
my internal strength. I grew 
up never allowing myself to 
be “that person” who needed 
to take a day off at work or 
gratify their whims, and I re-
member thinking as a child 
that the last thing I should 
even do was ask my mom to 
buy me a candy bar or some 
other trinket displayed on 
the sides of the cashier line.

So when the term “self-care” 
resurfaced in popular media 
several years ago, I naturally 
scoffed and brushed it aside 
as just a trend for the privi-
leged — those who could af-
ford to splurge on Lush bath 
bombs, essential oil diffus-
ers or ten-step skincare rou-
tines. In my mind, self-care 
was just another way for rich 
people to make excuses for 
themselves, and to be honest, 
I regarded it as an activity 
only white people participat-
ed in because I had only seen 
it as such. But especially after 
attending the teach-in host-
ed by United Asian American 
Organizations (UAAO) for 
Asian American and Pacific 
Islander 
Heritage 
Month 

on March 31 about burnout 
and anti-capitalist self-care, 
I have come to understand 
that self-care is not for the 
privileged but, in fact, for all 
— and it is especially for the 
marginalized, for those who 
cannot afford to think twice 
about their self-preservation. 

As explained in UAAO’s pre-
sentation, though self-care 
has been commodified into 
a ten-million dollar industry 
by U.S. capitalism, the origins 
of self-care actually stem 
from anti-capitalist roots in 
the Black Power movement 
of the 1960s and 70s. 

fulness techniques like yoga 
and meditation while in 
prison. For these organizers, 
often Black queer women, 
the idea of maintaining their 
health and preserving their 
existence was not only a 
means of survival but an act 
of political warfare. 

Self-care quickly be-

came community care, 

a term illustrated by Dean-
na Zandt that describes larg-
er methods of maintaining 
the health and safety of one’s 
community and collectively 
resisting the oppressive na-
ture of our capitalist society. 
In 1972, the Black Communi-
ty Survival Conference held 
in Oakland, Ca. provided 
resources about the Party’s 
free community-service pro-
grams, such as healthcare 
clinics, local transportation 
and free breakfast programs 
that became a means of sur-
vival and support against 
the harassment and violence 
inflicted upon Black people 
by the police and federal 
government. In a white-
dominated, capitalist society 
where leaders, institutions 
and systems failed to protect 
and fulfill their needs, active 
self-care translated to caring 
for one’s community in a way 
that would ultimately lead to 
structural change. 

While I used to roll my eyes 
at the phrase “self-care” and 
only throw the term around 
lightly, I realized the weight 
of what true self-care for 
me meant when I could 
no longer afford to dismiss 
it— when I physically could 
not breathe under the im-
measurable distress caused 
by the reality of our society. 
When I heard about the At-
lanta shootings on March 
16, I needed to stop what-
ever I was working on and 
do something, anything, that 
would offer me some sem-
blance of solace and healing. 
That night, my roommates 
and I had a long discussion 
about the news and talked 
for several hours. All of us 
were at a loss of words and 
still processing what had 
happened, and I think we all 
knew we needed to simply be 
together in that space. 

In the days following the 
shooting, 
as 
more 
news 

sources 
started 
revealing 

the names of the victims and 
social media exploded with 
threads of who and what 
was responsible and which 
organizations 
to 
support, 

the weight of what had hap-
pened continued to steadily 
creep into my being. I had an 
online interview for a sum-
mer internship scheduled 
two days after the event, and 
I remember the coordinator 
reaching out to the appli-
cants the morning of March 
17 to give us the option to re-
schedule in case we were not 
in the right headspace for an 
interview. While I genuinely 
appreciated the email and 
recognized that it would be 
helpful for many, I told her 
I was fine. I could handle it, 
I thought to myself. There 
was no need for the hassle of 
altering this other person’s 
schedule for my own conve-
nience. 

Poetry and technicality: Amanda 

Gorman’s “The Hill We Climb”

Thursday, August 5, 2021 — 15

At President Joe Biden’s in-
auguration on Jan. 20, 2021, 
22-year-old Amanda Gorman 
delivered an original poem, 
“The Hill We Climb.” The 
Los Angeles resident and 
Harvard College graduate 
made history as the youngest 
known inaugural poet, spark-
ing admiration and conversa-
tion in the following weeks.

Her poem isn’t without criti-
cism, however. Some people 
have taken to the comment 
sections in newspapers like 
The Hill to demean her val-
ues with matters of techni-
cality. Check out Reddit’s r/
Poetry subreddit, a place to 
share and discuss published 
poetry, and you’ll find simi-
lar sentiments. One user said, 
“The meter is all over the 
place. The wordplay is inane. 
It’s full of patriotic platitudes 
and contains nothing new or 
surprising. It wouldn’t in-
spire anyone at any time ex-
cept Americans, today.”

So, I am inclined to ask, what 
makes a good poem? The 
structure? Its impact? I’ve 
heard various people com-
mend the artist yet criticize 
the poem for things such as 
“clichés” and 
“frustrating 

meter.” Additionally, others 
have praised “The Hill We 
Climb” for its messages and

pacing but question whether 
it is “technically strong.” Re-
gardless, I think that there is 
great merit in the work as a 
piece of art. Art and creativ-
ity can be important tools for 
inspiring people, and Gor-
man utilized them to do just 
that. A Forbes article says, 
“Gorman has produced po-
etry and studied sociology, so 

in combining complex social 
science into an art form, she 
has developed a unique of-
fering in both fields.” I’d have 
to agree.

Journalists, 
teachers 
and 

YouTubers alike have begun 
analyzing Gorman’s piece, 
noting references to the Bible 
and other poets’ work. Per-

sonally, I hear rhythms and 
repetitions that remind me 
of the musical “Hamilton.” 
There are two references to 
the musical within the poem, 
in addition to commentary 
on current events. The sig-
nificance? Gorman is pur-
poseful in her words and pre-
sentation. The accessibility 
of her piece, though indiffer-

ent to the poem’s technical-
ity, is, bluntly put, incredible. 
There is still value that can 
be measured in the concise-
ness of words and density 
of thought within it, but the 
poem’s reach to general audi-
ences should be considered 
invaluable. The feelings it 
evoked in countless people, 
even if only for a moment, 

have been monumental (just

lated to #AmandaGorman on 
Twitter). Gorman’s position 
as an inaugural poet gave her 
a platform to deliver a mes-
sage in a moving way, reach-
ing those who previously 
wouldn’t have given poetry a 
second thought. I think this 
is one area that she succeeds, 
not just in her poem, but in 
her empowering execution.

In her delivery, Gorman’s 
presence exudes strength, 
but her words also reflect 
pain. Poignant lines remind 
young Americans — not un-
like Gorman — that our work 
is not done. We must strive 
for progress in a society that 
is fast-paced and continu-
ously evolving. Accommo-
dating changing times also 
means acknowledging the 
dark that remains. In doing 
so, and in the words of Gor-
man herself in “The Hill We 
Climb,” perhaps we might 
“raise this wounded world 
into a wondrous one.” What 
exactly does it mean “to 
forge a union with purpose?” 
Can love truly “become our 
legacy?” Will the poem that 
implores such affirmations 
be remembered and recited 
for years to come? has to 
tell. If anything, the call for 
light and unity is one that we 
needed.

I like to joke that I-94 and 
I-80 are my second homes. 
I’ve spent thousands of miles 
on them, miles that trade 
scenery for ease — hop on 
and drive, no directions 
needed. The “check engine” 
light on the dashboard of my 
old car kept me company, a 
constant presence lingering 
in the corner of my vision. 
It was accompanied by a 
symphony of other warning 
lights who came and went 
as they pleased. My brain 
felt a lot like that dashboard: 
internal problems and topics 
I didn’t understand sim-
mering away under layers of 
metal and avoidance.

“It’s when the lights aren’t 

flashing that something’s 
actually wrong,” I’d profess 
to nervous passengers with a 
laugh. “She runs just fine.” 

Of course, she didn’t. My car, 
referred to by friends as “the 
Deathbox,” eventually ended 
up in the shop, a mechanic 
instructing my parents to 
never let me drive it again. 
“The frame’s rusted out,” the 
mechanic told them. “If she 
gets hit, the car will basically 
disintegrate.” 

Turns out, an inadvertent 
car crash is what happens 
when you bushwack through 
life on someone else’s rules. 
I’d had warning lights sim-
mering in my body for years, 
finally coming into them-
selves during my first years 

of college. My warning lights 
looked like nervous shots of 
Svedka in my dark kitchen 
while my boyfriend drove 
to my house, my first time 
looming, unspoken, between 
us. It’s easier when you’re 
drunk, obviously. And more 
fun. Or, later, anxiety attacks 
on the cold concrete floor 
of my workplace, my body 
pulled to the ground by guilt 
and shame after hooking up 
with a longtime male friend. 
Or a journal page, folded 
away from even my closest 
friends, where I’d written, “I 
feel as if sex is something I 
owe to my partner — I’m not 
doing it against my will, but 
I don’t understand how it’s 
supposed to make me feel.” 
Or finishing a movie next 
to a boyfriend, wondering 
how long I could watch the 
screensaver camera pan over 
the Sahara before we’d have 
to go to bed. I felt defective. 

I shook during every physi-
cal interaction, a small but 
noticeable tremble, and I 
told partners to ignore it. 

And ignore it, we did. Fol-
lowing my friend’s exam-
ples, I tried everything to fix 
this part of me. I pined after 
a friend for two years, went 
on an almost-blind date that 
turned into a six-month 
relationship, even initiated 
a friends with benefits situ-
ation during my semester 
abroad (trying everything 
doesn’t quite lend itself to 
originality). Each was man-
ageable — which isn’t the 
same as enjoyable.

I thought casual hookups 
would be empowering — 
in a society that profits 
off women’s sexualization 
through advertising but 
punishes them for taking 

ownership of their bodies 
through sex work, casual 
dating and hookup culture 
makes more sense. Women 
don’t need a relationship, 
which deems sex appropri-
ate and private, to enjoy 
themselves. I’ll shout from 
the rooftops about sex 
positivity, and actually have, 
but it wasn’t helping me get 
anywhere.

***

I never had a successful 
relationship in high school, 
and I find it perplexing that 
some people start college 
with zero relationship expe-
rience and others come con-
vinced they’d already found 
their life partner. What an 
odd world to enter: By age 
and education level college 
students are mostly on the 
same page, but emotionally, 
we’re all over the map. 

way, where I don’t start to 
enjoy them until they are 
about to end. Yet unfortu-
nately, this cycle continually 
repeats itself. It’s a sad truth 
that applies to more than just 
books: In life, people tend to 
not enjoy things until they 
are over. 

The problem is that people 
are constantly projecting into 
the future and ruminating 
in the past. We have all be-
come victims of the attention 
economy, one where so much 
available information and 
stimuli has created a huge at-

tention deficit. Hustle porn, 
or the fetishization of over-
working oneself, is another 
force driving people away 
from focusing on the process. 
And of course, our capitalis-
tic attitudes don’t help us de-
ter our attention away from 
results. Even mindfulness, 
the antithesis of capitalism, 
has been exploited for profit.

In her book “How to Do 
Nothing: Resisting the Atten-
tion Economy,” Jenny Odell 
discusses how the very es-
sence of what makes us hu-
man has become threatened 

the piano. Spontaneous sing-
alongs. The salty taste of 
tears.

We lose a lot when we are not 
in the present. 

Before her tragic accident 
in 2012, in her essay “Op-
posite of Loneliness,” Ma-
rina Keegan wrote, “The best 
years of our lives are not be-
hind us. They’re part of us 
and they are set for repeti-
tion as we grow up and move 
to New York and away from 
New York and wish we did 
or didn’t live in New York … 
of course there are things we 
wish we’d done: our read-
ings, that boy across the hall. 
We’re our own hardest crit-
ics and it’s easy to let our-
selves down.”

A tweet I recently read said, 
“I feel like I’m constantly 
worrying about the next part 
of my life without realizing 
that I’m right in the middle 
of what I used to look for-
ward to.” By obsessing over 
everything but the reality in 
front of us, we are depriving 
ourselves of life. Life should 
not (only) be a past experi-
ence or a future plan — it 
should be the now. 

Take a deep breath right now. 
Where are you? Who are you 
with? How do you feel? Why 
are you reading this? 

The practice of being pro-
cess-oriented rather than 
results-oriented 
takes 
in-

tentionality. Resisting forces 
such as the attention econo-
my and the pressure to work 
hard means not only seeing 
the problem but developing 
the strength to fight power-
ful tendencies: Don’t con-
stantly check your phone in 
the car, gaze out the window; 
Don’t fill your weeks with too 
many tasks, welcome what 
each day brings. To focus on 
the process means to find 
success in everything (F you 
capitalism!) — learning from 
failure, accepting an unpro-
ductive day, appreciating the 
little things (as demonstrat-
ed by Big Mouth’s Gratitoad). 

Over time I have discovered 
habits and hobbies that keep 
me grounded, thoughtful and 
intentional.

crease in “time” we now have 
to find new hobbies or to re-
lax has been taken advantage 
of by educators and CEOS 
alike, 
over-assigning 
and 

over-expecting from their 
students and employees. The 
faux luxury of time that the 
pandemic has brought on has 
led to intense burnout and 
dangerously busy schedules.

But it is possible to take back 
the time that has been stolen 
away from us by back-to-
back Zoom meetings and the 
pressure to master crochet-
ing with all the freedom we 
have. Instead of asking what-
ifs, we can focus on what we 
do know — what is right in 
front of us. We can strive to 
be what my therapist calls 
process-oriented, 
rather 

than results-oriented. 

I first noticed this distinction 
as I reflected on my reading 
habits. I always have a par-
ticularly difficult time start-
ing a new book. My selection 
process is unnecessarily long 
and usually leads to option 
paralysis, where there are 
so many choices that I ulti-
mately end up with nothing. 
There are simply too many 
books in the world and so 
little time. This may explain 
why walking into Barnes & 
Noble is simultaneously ex-
citing and sickening. Same 
with The Salvation Army. I 
digress. 

But if I do decide to embark 
on an intimate endeavor 
with literature, my new and 
carefully selected read of-
ten sits on my bedside table, 
lonely, waiting to be touched. 
Sometimes I tease the book 
by picking it up, but this is 
usually just to show a friend 
what I am “currently read-
ing.” And all-too-often, I’ll 
emit the familiar line: “Yeah 
I’m really only on page four 
— haha. So I have nothing to 
report about it yet.” 

And I likely won’t for several 
months. Right now, this book 
is the New York Times best-

Book seduction, meditation 

and other processes

SAMANTHA COLE

Statement Correspondent

This morning I woke up with 
big plans: Go for a long walk, 
catch up on “The Daily” pod-
cast episodes from The New 
York Times, fold my sweat-
shirt pile, call my dad, finish 
a finance problem set, write 
an essay, draft this piece. At 
the crack of dawn (10 a.m.), 
I stepped into my Ugg slip-
pers, stumbled down two 
flights of stairs in an over-
sized grey T-shirt and Mon-
sters Inc. fluffy pants and 
landed in the kitchen. I was 
compelled to walk outside 
and check the weather im-
mediately after being blind-
ed by the sunlight shining 
through the window. To my 
surprise, I was greeted with 
a gentle warm-ish breeze, 
one that felt unfamiliar after 
a chilling Ann Arbor winter. 
I inhaled the welcoming air 
with a deep breath. And then 
I did it again. And again. 

I closed my eyes. I felt calm. I 
felt peaceful. The sun melted 
away my exhaustion.

After what felt like a moment 
of tranquility, my long list 
of morning plans suddenly 
came flooding back into my 
mind. I pivoted my feet to-
wards the door, but some-
thing kept me in place as I 
tried to reenter the kitchen. 
I fed the urge to turn back to 
the sun, close my eyes and be-
gin to breathe slowly again. I 
couldn’t help but smile. I was 
resisting the urge to move, to 
do, to achieve. I was stand-
ing alone in a t-shirt on my 
Joe’s Pizza box-covered back 
porch, and I felt more alive 
than I had in weeks. 

If 2020 has shown us any-
thing, it is that we never truly 
know what to expect in life. 
And while this uncertainty 
naturally leads to feelings 
of stress and anxiety, it also 
gives us space to practice 
being comfortable with the 
unknown. 
This 
so-called 

“space” that I am referring to 
has been a contentious topic 
throughout the pandemic. 
For example, the alleged in-

cover art happens to match 
my cute little purple lamp. 

When I am finally compelled 
to pick the book up, it takes 
a significant amount of time 
for me to focus on the first 
few pages. I often have to 
read them over twice. Five 
or six pages in, I flip forward 
to see when the chapter will 
end. 10 more pages! I can 

do this, I think to cheer my-
self on. I continue reading 
with the goal of finishing a 
chapter. I read with a results 
mindset. 

Flash forward a few weeks 
and I am sitting upright in 
my bed at 3 a.m., my book 
propped 
up 
against 
my 

knees. Now, I turn the pag-
es with less haste and more 
hesitation. I am attached to 
the characters and lost in 
the words on the page. I read 
with a process mindset. 

I try not to read books this 

by the urge towards constant 
productivity.

 “What I’m suggesting is that 
we take a protective stance 
toward ourselves, each other, 
and whatever is left of what 
makes us human,” Odell 
writes. “I’m suggesting that 
we protect our spaces and our 
time for non-instrumental, 
noncommercial activity and 
thought, for maintenance, for 
care, for conviviality. And I’m 
suggesting that we fiercely 
protect our human animality 
against all technologies that 
actively ignore and disdain 

the body, the bodies of other 
beings, and the body of the 
landscape that we inhabit.”

Odell preaches something 
that is essential, especially 
during a pandemic: We must 
do everything in our power 
to focus on our humanity 
and appreciate what comes 
with it rather than fighting 
for what we cannot always 
control. I live for an extra 
hour of laughter at the din-
ner table. The sweet sound 
and serenity of Jimi Hendrix 
on the highway. The passion

Town or gown: the two sides of Ann Arbor

LANE KIZZIAH

Statement Correspondent

Painting the rock at the cor-
ner of Hill Street and Washt-
enaw Avenue is much more 
than just a longstanding 
campus tradition. 

In 1953, Michigan students 
and their Michigan State 
counterparts began vandal-
izing each other’s campuses 
with paint the week before a 
rivalry football game, a tradi-
tion that escalated to student 
arrests 
and 
suspensions. 

While the vandalism subsid-
ed on campus, the Spartans 
tried to get the final word, 
painting “M.S.U.” on the side 
of a limestone boulder in an 
Ann Arbor park sometime 
in the late 1950s. The tradi-
tion of “Painting the Rock” 
persists at both schools to-
day. Almost every time I 
drive down Washtenaw, the 
Rock looks different after a 
new student group or sports 
team has covered it with ev-
erything from “Go Blue”s to 
students’ names to political 
slogans.

But the Rock had a life long 
before the 1950s. If you were 
to scrape off the hundreds 
— maybe thousands — of 
layers of paint, you’d find a 
copper plaque depicting the 
stone’s original purpose: “To 
George Washington this me-
morial erected in celebration 
of the two hundredth an-
niversary of his birth, 1932.” 
For years after the painting 
began, there was a push to 
preserve the monument’s 
integrity with a sign erected 
as recently as the 1970s beg-
ging people not to paint the 

memorial, but the tradition 
was too cemented in campus 
culture to be shut down. 

For at least some residents in 
the area, the Rock represents 
a lot more harm than good. 
Despite its co-optation by the 
University community, the 
Rock sits in George Wash-
ington Park, on city property. 
For Lauren (whose name has 
been changed due to her fear 
of retribution to her business 
by University clients), a born 
and raised Ann Arbor resi-
dent, the rock is the perfect 
depiction of the University’s 
relationship to the broader 
community. 

Lauren expressed her frus-
tration to me in a recent 
phone call. She’s one of sev-
eral local residents who have 
complained about the litter-
ing of paint buckets or con-
cerns of toxins getting into 
the gutter. In 2016, Nehama 
Glogower, another resident, 
wrote an article for the Ann 
Arbor Observer about her 
experience slipping in wet 
paint on the surrounding 

sidewalk. 
 
According to the women in 
both cases, they were unable 
to get their concerns heard.

“(Residents) 
resent 
(the 

University’s) 
entitlement,” 

Lauren said. “Where (the 
students are) a transient 
population, they don’t have 
a sense of placemaking be-
cause this isn’t their perma-
nent home. And the Univer-
sity sort of allows that for 
their brand, and they don’t 
have a sense of collabora-
tion.”

Colin Smith, Parks and Rec-
reation Services Manager for 
the City of Ann Arbor, gets 
occasional complaints about 
the park, mostly when paint 
gets on the sidewalk or be-
yond. He said his department 
has to maintain the park at 
least twice a year, which he 
estimates costs about $500-
$750 per visit when account-
ing for the materials needed 
to repaint the sidewalk and 
the labor. However, Michael 
Rein, U-M director of com-
munity relations, said he has 
 never heard complaints 
 
 

 about the Rock.

What is remarkable about 
the history of tension be-
tween the University and 
the town is how seldom it is 
addressed. Ann Arbor is con-
stantly ranked among the top 
college towns in the country 
and is considered one of the 
University’s biggest assets. 
The school is so intertwined 
with the surrounding area 
— 
geographically, 
cultur-

ally and economically — that 
town and gown problems can 
seem nonexistent.

Ann Arbor was founded 
in 1824 by John Allen and 
Elisha W. Rumsey. The two 
men headed west from De-
troit in January of that year 
and reached what is now 
present-day Ann Arbor by 
early February. The pair 
purchased a collective 2.6 
square kilometers of land for 
$800 (what would be about 
$22,000 today) and opened 
up the Washtenaw Coffee 
House, the town’s first struc-
ture. Ann Arbor — named in 
honor of Rumsey and Allen’s 
wives, both named Ann — 
started to expand as an agri-
cultural trading 
center. 

The University of Michigan, 
which had been founded 
in Detroit in 1817, relocated 
to Ann Arbor in 1839 while 
both school and town were 
in their infancy. Less than 
20 years after its founding, 
the city had a population of 
2,000, a courthouse, a jail, 
a bank, four churches and 
two mills. The University 
was even smaller. During its 
first year in the new town, 
the University had just seven 
students and two professors. 
Now, the city’s population 
stands at over 120,000, and 
the school’s total enrollment 
is over 44,700. Michigan and 
Ann Arbor have grown, si-
multaneously, but not neces-
sarily together. 

While most state constitu-
tions give state legislatures 
power to provide for higher 
education, Michigan is one of 
the few that mentions specif-
ic institutions and enumer-
ates specific forms of gover-
nance and autonomy. Most 
states’ public higher educa-
tion systems are controlled 
by a governing board, while
Michigan’s 15 
universities 

are 
independent 
schools. 

Each has their own school 
board that generally super-
vises the university’s actions 
and controls its finances. 
The governing bodies of 
Michigan’s three flagship in-
stitutions — the University 
of Michigan, Michigan State 
and Wayne State — are given 
almost complete autonomy 
over the universities’ opera-
tions. This has a number of 
implications, one being that 
the University isn’t bound by 
the Ann Arbor local govern-
ment in nearly any form — it 
doesn’t pay taxes or follow 
the same zoning regulations 
— which, naturally, can cause 
some town and gown prob-
lems.

“The University doesn’t need 
to follow any of our rules,” 
Ann Arbor Mayor Christo-
pher Taylor said. “They don’t 
follow our zoning; they don’t 
follow our planning. And, 
of course, they have the re-
sources to do what they want 
when they want to do it.”

The perfect example of this 
dynamic is the 27-foot-tall, 
48-foot-wide billboard be-
tween 
Michigan 
Stadium 

and the Crisler Center. The 
huge electronic sign was put 
up in 2013 much to the dis-
may of permanent residents. 
At the time, then-City Coun-
cilmember Taylor urged the 
University to take it down, 
arguing that it was a dis-
traction to drivers. Former 
University President Mary 
Sue Coleman responded by 
saying that it is the responsi-
bility of the driver to not be 
distracted.

“They did not mean me 
when they said disabled”

MARISA WRIGHT

Statement Correspondent

They tell me I look so 
healthy. They tell me I’m 
just so young. They just can-
not believe it. They ask me if 
I’m really sick, like am I re-
ally sure? They ask me if I’ve 
actually received a diagnosis. 
They tell me it’s in my head, 
that it’s psychosomatic. They 
tell me it’s part of being a 
woman. 

There are so many things 
people tell me about my own 
body. If they’re not telling 
me, they’re second-guessing 
the information and descrip-
tions I share. 

Me disclosing an illness or 
disability that is invisible, 
which is to say it is not ob-
servable or evident in any 
readily apparent sense, often 
leads to these kinds of reac-
tions. Without the ability to 
observe my condition, many 
people question or refuse to 
believe its validity. 

Aside from any symptoms, 
the reality of living with an 
invisible condition is that 
people — doctors, family, 
friends, professors, cowork-
ers and so on — simply won’t 
believe you. They will label 
you as overdramatic, tell you 
that you’re just lazy or call 
you a liar. 

LSA senior Cheyanne Killin, 
who has multiple chronic ill-
nesses stemming from a rare 
genetic 
connective 
tissue 

disorder called hypermobile 

Ehlers-Danlos 
Syndrome 

(hEDS), shared her experi-
ence with this reality in an 
email to The Michigan Daily. 

“Because I do not look visibly 
disabled, many people often 
assume that I’m not a

tually sick, or, worse, that I’m 
actually only mildly sick and 
exaggerating my conditions 
for personal gain and/or ma-
licious intent,” Killin wrote. 

In medical settings, this kind 
of disbelief can have extreme 
consequences. 
Proper 
di-

agnosis and treatment are 
predicated by a doctor tak-
ing their patient’s concerns 
and description of symptoms 
seriously. When they don’t, 
patients can suffer unneces-

sarily. 

It is easier for a doctor’s un-
conscious biases to play a 
greater role in their evalua-
tion and course of treatment, 
particularly when conditions 
are not visible to a doctor, 

which is the case for 96% of 
the nearly 133 million Ameri-
cans with at least one chronic 
illness. In this way, a doctor’s 
biases about one’s identities 
can stand in the way of prop-
er treatment. 

Doctors are less likely to 
believe and properly treat 
women’s pain than men’s. 
Doctors 
also 
undertreat 

Black Americans’ pain rela-
tive to white Americans. 
Black women in particular 

are harmed by doctors who 
dismiss their concerns and 
improperly treat them: Pro-
Publica reports that “a black 
woman is 22 percent more 
likely to die from heart dis-
ease than a white woman, 71 
percent more likely to perish 
from cervical cancer, but 243 
percent more likely to die 
from pregnancy- or child-
birth-related causes.” Doc-
tors’ bias against fat people 
and queer people also leads 
to worse health outcomes. 

Killin has felt this acutely 
when treated by male physi-
cians. 

“I was often told that I was 
just anxious, stressed, or 
pregnant,” Killin wrote. “If 
those were negated, like a 
negative pregnancy test, I 
was just shown the door 
without options or treat-
ment. I’ve been sick since 
October 2017, and I am just 
now finding out exactly what 
is going on with my body.”

For my own primary condi-
tion endometriosis, patients 
typically face a diagnostic 
delay of seven to 10 years 
from the onset of disease. In 
my case, a doctor misdiag-
nosed me with appendicitis 
— for which I underwent an 
appendectomy — seven years 
before I received my proper 
diagnosis of endo. For those 
seven years, my pain was un-
treated and the progression 
of the disease continued. 

While part of this diagnostic 
delay is due to doctors’ lack 
of training on conditions that 
are traditionally associated 
with the female reproductive 
system, it is also certainly 
caused in part by doctors 
who dismiss their patient’s 
pain as “part of being a wom-
an.”

Art & Design senior Anna 
DeLuca, who has endometri-
osis and chronic migraines, 
shared a similar experience 

in trying to receive a proper 
diagnosis and having doctors 
dismiss her pain as a woman. 

“Especially if you initially go 
in for painful periods, you are 
often dismissed because you 
know, periods are supposed 
to be painful or whatever,” 
she told me in a Zoom inter-
view. 

DeLuca described the impact 
this dismissal had on her.

“And then you’re sort of 
hit with that wall and then 
you 
can’t 
say 
anything 

else,”DeLuca said. “When 
you are immediately dis-
missed I shut down, I feel 
like I sort of I can’t say any-
thing else because you know 
they’re not going to listen 
and so, then you try it again 
with another doctor and you 
get the same experience.” 

In addition to complicating 
diagnosis and treatment in 
medical contexts, the perva-
siveness of disbelief of invis-
ible conditions affects issues 
of access to resources for 
chronically ill and disabled 
people, including govern-
ment benefits and accommo-
dations at school or work. At 
the University of Michigan, 
the laborious process re-
quired to prove a need for ac-
commodations through the 
Services for Students with 
Disabilities office can leave a 
lot of students out. 

DeLuca explained how the 
form SSD requires to request 
accommodations is “so long” 
and requires that your doctor 
complete most of it.

level, where one’s sport is 
not a hobby but a job in 
the public eye. 
Student-

are 
al-

ready under a lot of 
pressure from having to bal-
ance schoolwork, games and 
practice, so how do their dif-
fering identities — like which

tus — and the intersectional-
ity of these identities impact 
their ability to thrive in ath-
letics and academics, as well 
as their self-esteem, identity 

The University of Michigan 
has 13 men’s and 14 women’s 
varsity sports, but if you’re 
not an avid sports fan, you 
are probably only familiar 
with two: men’s football and 
men’s 
basketball. 
Indeed,

central to our 
campus spirit and iden-

builds a sense of camara-
derie even for those who 
barely watch the games, and 
the March Madness tourna-
ment is another excuse to 
get drunk and excited over a 
maize-colored jersey. Much 
of these sports’ popularity 
comes from American cul-
ture and tradition, as well 
as the history of the athletic 
program, but it is sustained 
through powerful market-
ing and resourcing — which 
is possible, considering these 
sports are the major drivers 
of revenue for the University. 
The NCAA’s model, which 
has shifted from providing 
holistic academic and athlet-
ic opportunities to optimiz-
ing profit, has led to the cuts 
of many D1 athletic programs 
and hindered the growth of 
already existing ones.

For women’s athletics, this 
model can be an even deeper 
threat, as retaining popu-
larity and viewership has 
proven difficult for these 
teams in the past. Not only 
do women athletes have to 
break through patriarchal 
stereotypes about who sport 
is for (traditionally, men) and 
which sports are “better” to

How women student athletes navigate college life

Statement Correspondent

This March, outcry arose 
during the NCAA March 
Madness 
tournament 

when Sedona Prince, 
a forward for the 
Oregon 
Ducks 

women’s 
bas-

ketball 
team, 

posted a Tik-
Tok 
compar-

ing her team’s 
weight 
room 

to that of their 
male 
coun-

terparts. 
The 

men’s 
weight 

room was an ex-
pansive gym full of 
machines, equipment 
and free weights. The 
women’s weight room was 
a single rack of dumbbells 
and yoga mats. The NCAA 
claimed it was a space issue, 
but the TikTok clearly shows 
that the women’s area had 
ample room for a full gym. 
And while the internet ex-
ploded in discourse and de-
bate, many women athletes 
expressed that these dispari-
ties are nothing new.

Indeed, this controversy 
is a reflection of a great-
er issue in sports and 
in society overall. 
Women 
athletes, 

and 
especially 

women athletes 
of color, are not 
only paid less 
for the same or 
better 
work, 

but they are 
denied 
equal 

economic re-
sources 
and 

facilities, 
do 

not receive fair 
marketing 
and 

coverage 
and 

suffer 
stereotyp-

ing, 
sexualization 

and 
discrimination. 

Despite the passage of 
Title IX in 1972, women 
athletes today — at the club, 
high school, collegiate and 
professional levels — face 
substantial 
roadblocks 
to 

true equality. And while the 
University of Michigan does 
a good job supporting its stu-
dent athletes who are wom-
en, the institution of sport 
overall is still skewed to sup-
port men and their success.

As a woman who grew up 
playing competitive soccer, 
I am well aware of the social 
disparities that occur on and 
off the field — less fans com-

and worldview?

I spoke with seven women 
from six different sports 
— track & field and cross 
country, gymnastics, rowing, 

field hockey, softball and 

lacrosse — in the hopes 

of learning about their 

experiences as wom-
en student athletes 
at the University. 
As a non-student-
athlete, 
I 
have 

witnessed within 
myself, and among 
other peers who 
don’t play college 
sports, a tendency to 

make assumptions or 

stereotypes about stu-

dent-athletes, especially 

with gendered, racial and 
sport-specific lenses. And 
while these seven women 
graciously allowed me a look 
into their academic, athletic 
and personal lives with com-
mon themes linking their 
experiences, this article is 

merely a glance into 

the 
di-

verse, 

complex 
in-

stitution of sport.

Dr. Ketra Armstrong, profes-
sor of Sport Management and 
director of Diversity, Equity 
& Inclusion for the School of 
Kinesiology, touched on the 
idea of a universal student-
athlete experience during a 
Zoom interview.

“I’m always hesitant to paint 
that experience as a mono-
lith,” Armstrong said. “It 
differs if they’re a Black stu-
dent or a student of color. 
Or if they’re a student of 
color, and they’re female and 
they’re an athlete playing 
what is considered a ‘mascu-
line type sport.’ So there’s a 
multiplicity of identities that 
are at play when you look at 
those two buckets of be-
ing a student and be-
ing an athlete.”

Indeed, identity 
impacts experi-
ence; even so, 
there are the 
typical 
ob-

stacles 
most 

women 
ath-

letes face ev-
ery day. Sex-
ist comments. 
Body image is-
sues. Social and 
political engage-
ment. Viewership 
disparities. 
These 

are encountered in the 
classroom or while com-
peting; women athletes suf-

fer many of the common 

grievances of the patri-

archy and those that 

come with their 

sport.

“They’re try-
ing to deal 
with a lot,” 
Armstrong 
s a i d . 
“They’re 
trying to 
be 
stu-

d e n t s , 
t h e y ’ r e 
trying to 
be athletes 
and they’re 
trying to be 
citizens 
… 

citizens of the 
campus, 
citi-

zens of the com-

munity, citizens of 

the world. So that’s 

a lot to ask of a person 

to do and to do it success-

fully and impactfully.”

And yet, just as they do on 
their field, court, track or 
floor — they push through, 
they persevere. 

“Athletes, 
particularly, 

they’re high performing,” 
Armstrong said. “They’re 
resilient, first and foremost, 
let’s not forget that. They’re 
resilient.”

games are more exciting), but 
they have to fight for equal 
representation in marketing 
and media. The NCAA was 
criticized this year not only 
for the weight room fiasco 
but also because of its March 
Madness Twitter account. 
Its bio reads: “The official 

NCAA March Mad-

ness destination

Division I

Men’s

It seems 

unfair 
to 

claim 
that 

“just not enough 

people 
like 
watch-

ing women’s sports” when 
there’s barely a mention of 
the 
women’s 
tournament 

— how are you supposed to 
get new fans if people aren’t 
aware of the games?

It’s a phenomenon that LSA 
fifth-year 
senior 
Nadine 

Stewart, a lacrosse player 
studying 
Biopsychology, 

Cognition and Neuroscience, 
described to me over a Zoom 
call. Stewart explained how 
the 
University’s 
women’s 

lacrosse 
games 
are 
not 

televised; rather, they are 
streamed on Big Ten Net-
work Plus, which requires a 
paid subscription. 

“Some 
people 
obviously 

don’t have (BTN Plus), so 
they can’t watch, so we can’t 
really get a huge following,” 
Stewart said.

This lack of proper represen-
tation is also visible in the 
sports media. In one study 
of sports news in Southern 
California, it was found that 
while women and girls make 
up 40% of all athletes, they 
received only about 4% of 
news coverage.

Graduation looms on the ho-
rizon. For every college stu-
dent, the idea of graduating 
college holds a bittersweet 
flavor, caught between the 
satisfaction of accomplish-
ment and the sadness of 
goodbyes. For some, it holds 
more of one than the other. 
It is sometimes hard to tell 
which is stronger. Some-
times, the bitterness wins. 

At 21 years old, I’ve been a 
college student for five years 
and have been at the Univer-
sity of Michigan for three 
of them. I took courses at a 
community college for two 
years in my childhood state 
of California before trans-
ferring to the University. My 
mom encouraged me to apply 
since her and my stepfather’s 
resident status would trans-
fer to me. One acceptance 

letter and months later, I 
was living much closer to my 
mom and my sister Sydney’s 
family, which I liked because 
I could visit them any time I 
wanted. 

I look back on the clueless 
18-year-old from the mid-
dle of nowhere in Northern 
California, who was over-
whelmed by the University’s 
size and the sheer number of 
people during her first few 
weeks of class. I remember 
how excited she was to wake 
up to snow on the ground. 
That girl could never have 
imagined 
that 
her 
path 

would bring her this far or 
to this particular place. That 
her senior year would be 
spent shut away in an apart-
ment off-campus. That by 
now she would have accom-
plished and lost so much. 

It was only three weeks into 
this winter semester that I 

received a phone call from 
my sister that our mom had 
passed away. She lived only 
25 minutes away from me, 
but I hadn’t risked hugging 
her in over a month because 
of the risk of coronavirus 
contagion. She lived alone, 
having separated from my 
stepfather a couple of years 
ago. The only hint I got that 
something was wrong was 
that she wasn’t responding 
to my texts. I didn’t know 
she was gone until almost 24 
hours after it happened. She 
was only 57 years old. 

Her funeral was simple. We 
wore masks and social dis-
tanced. We ordered a bou-
quet of flowers in her fa-
vorite color, purple, looking 
as much like a bouquet of 
wildflowers she would have 
picked herself as we could 
make it. I played her favorite 
music and put together a long 
slideshow of photos of her, 
even though she never liked 
having her picture taken. We 
felt we needed some event to 
celebrate her life, to mark the 
fact that she was gone even 

though we couldn’t believe 
it, couldn’t accept it. Closure 
was the idea, but we felt and 
still feel no closure. 

I mark every accomplish-
ment now in my mind on a 
calendar of months since 
she was alive. My first col-
umn in The Michigan Daily 

this semester was spread out 
on her coffee table when we 
went to her house to begin 
packing her things. She had 
said she planned to frame it. 

Since then, I published my 
first article in a non-student 
publication and I won a Hop-
wood Undergraduate Non-
fiction Award: the outcome 
of efforts she witnessed but 
of which never got to see the 
rewards. On the one hand, I 
can’t imagine having done 
any more or better in my un-

dergraduate career. 
But on the other side of that, 
I thought that I would be tak-
ing graduation pictures with 
her now. She would be telling 

me how proud of me she was. 

I still haven’t taken any grad-
uation pictures. 

This chapter has a bitter end-
ing for a lot of people, with 
not a lot of closure. I know 
this is not the senior year any 
of us imagined, distanced 

from friends and family and 
normal life.

In the coming weeks, se-
lect students in the College 
of Literature, Science & the 
Arts will receive an email 
congratulating them for be-
ing named James B. An-
gell Scholars. The award, 
named for the University of 
Michigan’s third president, 
celebrates any LSA student 
who receives an “A” record 
for two consecutive terms 
at the University. While we 
wish to offer congratulations 

for these students’ diligent 
dedication to their stud-
ies, it is also critical to learn 
about the award’s namesake. 
While Angell’s legacy is com-
plex — and potentially prob-
lematic — it is unlikely that 
more than a small percent-
age of the students that walk 
through the doors of Angell 
Hall are aware of this legacy. 

Amid a nationwide reckon-
ing with the memorialization 
of controversial historical 
figures, the University must 
also partake in increasing our 

efforts to thoroughly under-
stand the leaders we choose 
to highlight on campus, in-
cluding Angell. Angell served 
as University President from 
1871 to 1909. During his 38 
year tenure as president, 
the University’s enrollment 
more than tripled. He was 
adamant that education be 
accessible to all, not just for 
the elite. To this point, he 
emphasized the admission 
of first-generation college 
students; in 1880, fewer than 
one in four students had par-
ents with a college degree. 

Angell also oversaw the first 
female students to join the 
University at the beginning 
of his term in 1870 and 1871 
and later became a vocal sup-
porter of co-education. 

Angell saw education as a 
public service and greatly ex-
panded resources for faculty 
research to this end. Under 
his leadership, the number 
of departments on campus 
grew from three to seven and 
the number of professors 
went from 35 to 250. Histori-
an James Tobin asserted that 
it was Angell who supported 
the University in becoming 
the leading public university 
in the country.

On the night of April 11, 2019, 
Columbia University student 
Alexander McNabb entered 
a library on Barnard Univer-
sity’s campus. Students at 
Columbia — with which Bar-
nard is affiliated — are per-
mitted to freely access and 
use Barnard’s campus build-
ings and resources. Despite 
having done nothing at all to 
indicate himself as a threat 
of any kind, McNabb was 
stopped by campus police 
and physically restrained. A 
Barnard student captured 
the encounter, which many 
described as an incidence of 
racial profiling because the 
school library’s ID policy 

after 11 p.m. is unevenly en-
forced. McNabb is Black, and 
he wasn’t bothering anyone. 

Toward the end of the vid-
eo, one of the five campus 
security officers that con-
vened around McNabb for 
no apparent reason can be 
seen wandering off with 
McNabb’s 
ID, 
imploring 

McNabb to come outside 
with him. The ID clearly 
identified McNabb as a Co-
lumbia student. Clearly and 
understandably 
distressed, 

he can be heard asking, “You 
saw my ID, what else do you 
need to see?” 

While this might seem like a 
one-off occurrence at anoth-
er institution that can be ex-
plained as an unfortunate in-
cident where mistakes have 
been made, it very clearly 
isn’t. Due to the demands 
of the Graduate Employees’ 
Organization demands — in 
particular its call to cut the 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 

funding to its Department of 
Public Safety and Security in 
half — stories about students 
of color at U-M experienc-
ing horrifying treatment by 
DPSS have been surfacing. 
One in particular, that of Jus-
tin Gordon, is beyond appall-
ing. He was held in limbo, 
in a jail cell, as punishment 
for going to the campus gym 
without his ID. 

His entire life has been 
stained by that injustice. 
For example, Gordon was 

hired by the National Foot-
ball League, only to have his 
job offer rescinded due to 
his criminal record, despite 
his University of Michigan 
degree and letters of recom-
mendation from his profes-
sors. Gordon was stopped 
because he was Black, and 
that a confluence of biases 
which 
permeate 
through 

both policing practices and 
society caused his life to be 
upended. My rage is directed 
at not only the racist systems 
held in place by entities such 
as DPSS that have severely 
impacted his life, but also 
with the administration here 
at the University. 

Although Gordon was pro-
moted to impressive posi-
tions within the University 

and continued to be an honor 
roll student even after his in-
carceration, the school argu-
ably created yet another per-
manent barrier to students 
with a prison record. On Feb. 
1, 2019, the University imple-
mented SPG 601.38, which 
requires faculty, staff, stu-
dent employees, volunteers 
and visiting scholars to re-
port all felony charges, even 
if not convicted, to the Uni-
versity. 

Instead of removing possible 
instruments for discriminat-
ing against individuals such 
as Gordon, based on precon-
ceived notions held about 
criminality that can have an 
indelible, lifelong influence 
on someone’s interactions 
with society, the University 
has created another. Fur-
ther, there is no evidence to 
suggest that criminal history 
information in general ad-
missions decisions improves 
public safety.

Seeing the University step in 
to assist a smart and ambi-
tious alum and enable him 
to thrive in the long-term, 
rather than only promoting 
him to positions of visibility 
in service of Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion in the short-
term would be the right thing 
to do. The University has not 
done the latter, but they did 
do the former while Gordon 
was still a student, even after 
his incarceration.

Thursday, August 5, 2021 — 21

When 
asked 
about 
my 

strengths, my default an-
swers are writing and “peo-
ple skills.” What do I mean by 
“people skills?” While defi-
nitions vary, I would define 
them as the communicative 
tools used to connect with 
another person. I put them 
in quotations because these 
tools carry different mean-
ings for different people. 
Similar to the blurry distinc-
tion between a good writer 
and a great writer, there is not 
a universal metric by which 
someone can be pinpointed 
as “great with people” ver-
sus “good with people.” This 
blurriness continues to cre-
ate doubt in my abilities. It 
is easy for me to say I’m not 
actually a good writer and, 
instead, say my professors 
have just graded my work 
easily. As it is almost impos-
sible to measure human con-
nection, it is also easy for me 
to say that I’m not actually 
good with people. With these 
doubts, which are exacer-
bated by societal pressures 
to validate skills through 
quantifying their value, I of-
ten find myself scrambling 
to explain how these immea-
surable skills are actually my 
strengths.

The idea of constantly doubt-
ing my strongest abilities is 
both contradictory and limit-
ing. However, the two skills 
I am best at both happen to 
be subjective and therefore 
more easily belittled than 
more objective skills. Com-
pared to experience with 
Photoshop, 
Javascript 
or 

statistical modeling, experi-
ence with people or writing 
sounds obvious and self-ag-
grandizing. With skills that 
are less quantifiable, it be-
comes easier to assume that 
the majority of people have 
the same capabilities with 
these skills because distinc-
tions between different pro-
ficiencies in them are less 
absolute.

The last few years have wit-
nessed an increased empha-

sis on science, technology, 
engineering and math educa-
tion and careers, a decline of 
humanities majors that rely 
more on soft skills and the 
resulting employability fears 
associated with this decline. 
Somewhere in the midst 

of this, we have mistakenly 
come to equate measurabil-
ity — more specifically, quan-
tifiability — to value. And 
considering the management 
system of many universities, 
our society’s general margin-
alization of soft skills can be 
traced back to the way our 
education system pits studies 
that rely more on soft skills 
against ones that emphasize 
hard skills. 

Recently, responsibility-cen-
tered management (a univer-
sity budgeting system under 
which each department has 
autonomy over its revenue 
and expenditures) has be-
come the budgeting model 
of choice for many academ-
ic institutions. Under this 
model, large classes — which 
are more profitable — are 
prioritized over smaller, dis-
cussion-based classes, which 
typically happen to be classes 
that are centered around soft 
skills. Operating as busi-
nesses, universities further 
devalue subjective skills and 
the discussion-based class-
es that go along with these 
skills because they are not 
as fiscally advantageous for 

them. However, what is valu-
able to a business and what 
is valuable to society should 
not and cannot be viewed as 
equivalent to each other. The 
mere fact that classes cen-
tered on soft skills are not 
as profitable to universities 
as classes centered on hard 
skills does not mean soft 
skills themselves are not as 
beneficial to society as hard 
skills are.

Despite this prioritization 
of hard skills, these “soft” 

abilities are still valued by 
American companies, with 
61% claiming that skills like 
communication and problem 
solving are the most valued in 
prospective hires. In a study 
conducted by Boston Col-
lege, Harvard University and 
the University of Michigan, 
soft skills training was found 
to increase worker produc-
tivity by 12%. With this addi-
tional productivity and sub-
sequent increase in retention 
rates, the training produced 
a 256% net return on in-
vestment after nine months. 
LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner 
believes the skills gap asso-
ciated with soft skills is the 
widest in the United States. 
It is undeniable: There is 
ample evidence to support 
the argument that soft skills 
are valuable and capitalisti-
cally productive. Even so, 
justifying the importance of 
soft skills using statistics — 
quantifiable numbers — on 
why these skills are valuable 
in the workplace perpetuates 
and perhaps even validates 
our society’s obsession with 
numbers and hard facts.

When researching why soft 
skills are important, the vast 

majority of articles are cen-
tered around soft skills’ im-
portance in the workplace. 
However, the true power of 
soft skills lies in their un-
avoidable and fundamen-
tal presence in our daily 
lives. Self-awareness allows 
you to recognize your own 
strengths, 
fears, 
insecuri-

ties and priorities — and also 
those of the people around 
you. The ability to negotiate 
enables you to effectively and 
respectfully voice your opin-
ions without losing sight of 

your perspective. More gen-
erally, communication allows 
you to both set and maintain 
expectations for yourself and 
others. While proficiencies 
in different soft skills are 
clearly economically profit-
able, more importantly, they 
are personally fulfilling and 
socially valuable. Soft skills 
enable us to be empathetic 
and 
self-aware 
members 

of society without losing 
our analytical side — that is 
priceless.

This is not to say that soft 
skills are more important 
than hard skills. This is sim-
ply to say that they are also 
important — and not at the 
expense of more measurable 
skills. As a society, we seem 
to have manufactured a scar-
city mindset around the skills 
we deem valuable. With all 
of the multifaceted merits 
of both hard and soft skills, 
there is no need to depreciate 
one set of skills for the sake 
of another set of skills with 
completely unrelated assets 
and uses. Instead, we should 
take different kinds of skills

While University leadership would 
likely respond to thse allegations by 
asserting that U-M has a rich history 
of activism and stands with marginal-
ized groups on campus, it has clearly 
shown the multitude of ways it doesn’t 
prioritize the well-being of our com-

Two weeks ago, University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel 

used an evaluative survey 
sent to all governing faculty 
at the University of Michi-
gan to ask whether they sup-
ported expanding the Go 
Blue Guarantee for the Uni-
versity’s Flint and Dearborn 
campuses. The survey ques-
tion framed the program’s 
expansion as a trade-off with 
academic excellence and sal-
ary growth on the Ann Ar-
bor campus. The question’s 
elitist connotations raised 
eyebrows, a bit of disbelief 
and understandable outrage 
among many campus groups.

Schlissel offered a tepid 
apology a few weeks later, 
though not in a full or public 
fashion. Perhaps he hoped 
to leave this issue behind 
him — yet another episode 
in a list of controversies that 
include being forced to re-
move his provost for sexual 
misconduct, 
overseeing 
a 

controversial COVID-19 re-
sponse that many felt lacked 
transparency and receiving 
an unprecedented vote of no 
confidence from the 2020 
Faculty Senate.

But this incident also reveals 
a deeper problem, both with 
President Schlissel and the 
current structure of the Uni-
versity: There remains a fla-
grant disregard for fulfilling 

the role of a public institu-
tion and serving the people 
of the state of Michigan. 

President Schlissel was edu-
cated and spent his career at 
elite institutions, from Princ-
eton University to Brown 
University to the University 
of California, Berkeley. Un-
like his role at the University 
of Michigan, Schlissel’s lead-
ership at these institutions 
did not carry the responsi-
bility of developing regional, 
comprehensive 
campuses 

that support large numbers 
of working-class students. 
Schlissel’s lack of experience, 
and clear lack of interest, in 
the missions and strengths of 
these campuses has compro-
mised his ability to lead.

In an era rightfully attuned 
to racial and class inequali-
ties, 
Schlissel’s 
treatment 

of the Flint and Dearborn 
campuses undermines the 
institution’s commitment to 
justice and equity.

Sadly, 
President 
Schlissel 

seems ignorant of this — of-
ten willfully so. His admin-
istration misrepresented the 
goals of the One University 
campaign, claiming that it 
wants to “merge” the cam-
puses. One University does 
not believe the mission of the 
Flint and Dearborn campus-
es is the same as the Ann Ar-
bor campus. In fact, it is pre-
cisely the divergent missions 
of our campuses that make 
the University of Michigan 
stronger and positions us to 

make the greatest impact on 
the families and students of 
our state and nation.

The Flint and Dearborn cam-
puses instruct half of the Uni-

versity of Michigan’s in-state 
students. Close to 40% of 
University of Michigan-Flint 
and University of Michigan-
Dearborn students are low-
er-income and therefore Pell 
Grant eligible, while almost 
half of Ann Arbor’s students 
come from the top 10% of 
earners. This means the Flint 
and Dearborn campuses are 

the University’s work-horses 
of upward mobility. They are 
precious resources that — for 
over half a century — have 
built deep ties to two of the 
most dynamic and resilient 
communities in our state.

President Schlissel clearly 
does not see the three cam-
puses in this light. He has 
fought tooth-and-nail against 
expanding programs like the 
Go Blue Guarantee. He has 

resisted 
extending 
other 

resources that would help 
many University of Mich-
igan-Flint 
and 
University 

of Michigan-Dearborn stu-
dents overcome the layered 
inequalities that they face on 
their educational journeys. 
And he has stood by as these 
campuses have cut music and 
foreign language programs 

due to financial pressures, 
taking away opportunities 
from these students.

His position has become in-
creasingly untenable and out 
of step with the views of fac-
ulty, staff and students from 
across the University. It is 
also equally out of step with 
burgeoning support within 
our broader society for a 
more equitable higher edu-
cation system.

At University of Michigan-
Flint and University of Mich-
igan-Dearborn, 
students, 

staff and faculty think of 
President Schlissel as their 
president too. They want him 
to succeed, and they want 
him to want them to succeed. 
This is why it has been so 
disappointing to watch him 

blatantly act like the chancel-
lor of the Ann Arbor campus, 
rather than the president of 
all three campuses — only 
invoking his role as president 
to justify austerity on the 
Flint and Dearborn campus-
es in the name of a distant, 
better future.

A truly great university de-
serves a president who can 
use “both-and” thinking, not 
“either-or.” We can marshal 

our resources in a manner 
that cultivates and enhances 
Ann Arbor’s distinct research 
mission while supporting the 
crucial work taking place at 
the Flint and Dearborn cam-
puses.

President Schlissel: Are you the 
President of U-M or the Presi-

dent of U-M Ann Arbor?

Since the University of Mich-
igan welcomed its students 
back to campus for the 2020 
fall semester, many students 
have felt torn between risk-
ing exposure to COVID-19 
and 
remaining 
isolated. 

Even when people make the 
choice to stay in, some still 
risk exposure if those they 
live with attend large indoor 
gatherings with no masks or 
distancing. The COVID-19 
pandemic has complicated 
social pressures from friends, 
tensions with roommates 
and the natural desire to so-
cialize. Amid these compli-
cations, Fraternity & Sorority 
Life’s life’s tight-knit, socially 
competitive community in-
tensifies 
groupthink 
and 

places undue social pressure 
on members. 

In order to better understand 
the experience and decision-
making of FSL members, I 
interviewed three members 
whose approaches to social-
ization vary greatly: one so-
rority member, whom I will 
call Rachel, who is not going 
to fraternity parties; one so-
rority member, whom I will 
call Julia, who is going to 
parties at different fraterni-
ties; and one fraternity mem-
ber, whom I will call Zach, 
who is attending his own fra-
ternity’s parties. 

All three FSL members told 
me that one of the greatest 
factors driving their social 
decisions is a fear of missing 
out. They said fellow mem-
bers often talk about the par-
ties and social events they 
attend, and not attending 
parties can make members 
feel they are missing out on 
important chapter bonding. 

“It seems like everyone I live 
with has accepted that get-
ting COVID-19 is inevitable 
and are just partying while 
they can,” Rachel said. “Ev-
eryone I talk to says that 
since other people in the 
house are, there is no point 
in not going. It’s hard be-
cause I feel like everyone is 
getting closer and making 
these memories together, but 
I have to remind myself that 
close, real friendships are 
rarely formed at parties.”

The members I inter-
viewed seem to count 
the risk of catching CO-
VID-19 as analogous to 
other risks that young 
people take, like drinking 
or smoking. However, the 
disease’s high transmis-
sion rate means that if one 
person in a living com-
munity adopts the risk, 
they raise the risk factor 
for their entire commu-
nity. Members of FSL 

who entered the school 
year planning on social 
distancing said they now 
feel burdened by the risk 
of COVID-19 exposure 
but without the upside 
of getting to socialize. 
However, 
this 
creates 

a 
dangerous 
feedback 

loop wherein people put 
themselves at risk based 
on the notion that they 
are missing out. They go 
out, making more people 
feel like the odd one out 
for not doing so, and then 
they contribute to the cul-
ture of partying with little 
regard for the greater im-

plications on the Univer-
sity community. 

Julia, who regularly at-
tends indoor parties at 
fraternities, explains that 
while she does not be-
lieve fraternities are safe 
to visit, her “frat guy 
friends are getting tested 
regularly and being super 
open and honest, so I feel 
safe in those specific situ-
ations.” 

Fraternity party attendees 
may feel relatively uncon-
cerned about transmitting 
COVID-19, as testing and 

symptom checking pro-
vide a sense of security. 
However, there is still 
high inaccuracy in test-
ing, especially the rapid 
testing that many in FSL 
are opting to take, and the 
average incubation period 
for an infected person 
with COVID-19 is 4-5 
days. This means that an 
infected individual could 
test negative, continue 
to socialize with multi-
ple circles of friends and 
spread the disease.

Infected individuals are 
most contagious in the 24-

48 hour period before they 
start showing symptoms. 
This means that frequent 
testing 
and 
symptom-

checking are not effective 
measures for preventing 
an outbreak in indoor set-
tings. According to those 
interviewed, many frater-
nities are currently hold-
ing under-the-radar mix-
ers with multiple different 
sororities weekly. It only 
takes one person at one 
party to spark the spread 
of COVID-19 into mul-
tiple houses in just one 
week.

Elle Jimenez, President of 
the University of Michi-
gan’s Panhellenic Asso-
ciation, commented that 
“The 
Panhellenic 
and 

IFC Executive boards … 
decided together that it 
would be in the best in-
terest of our immediate 
Panhellenic and IFC com-
munities, as well as the 
University of Michigan 
community, and the sur-
rounding community of 
Ann Arbor to keep our so-
cial moratorium in place 
from March 11, 2020,” 
and that “The Panhellenic 
Association at the Univer-
sity of Michigan actively 
discourages 
attending 

gatherings that violate the 
current Washtenaw Coun-
ty 
Health 
Department 

public health order.”

If you were born in the state 
of Michigan, you likely en-
tered this world with desig-
nated colors: green and white 
or maize and blue. Whether 
or not you grew into these 
colors and attended the cor-
responding 
university 
is 

where intrastate enmity aris-
es. This is because the noto-
riety attached to your colors 
and logos extends beyond 
just being a fan — in-state 
collegiate allegiance produc-
es predetermined archetypes 
that are rooted in things 
deeper than football banter. 
Specifically, these archetypes 
view arrogance as a formally 
earned trait for those with an 
acceptance letter, and school 
pride as a mindless obsession 
for those without. 

With the University of Mich-
igan Athletic Department 
announcing the return of a 
college football season with 
spectators, the in-state rival-
ry between the University of 
Michigan and Michigan State 
University is bound to reig-
nite with a year’s worth of 
restrained animosity emerg-
ing beneath face masks and 
between six feet of distance. 
Regardless of your family’s 
membership in one of the 
largest living alumni bases in 
the world, adversaries locat-
ed in East Lansing demand 
clarification of one’s connec-
tion to the University, vali-
dating your logo and overall 

tolerability in the stands. 
In their terms and perhaps 
even in ours, you are either 
an “academic Wolverine” al-
lowed to exclaim “Go blue!” 
or a so-called “Walmart Wol-
verine” that is groundlessly 
affiliated.

The “academic Wolverine” is 
portrayed as an elitist, mak-
ing many think the acronym 
A² stands for “arrogant ass-
hole” in place of Ann Arbor. 
The University, in the eye of 
the “academic,” is a public 
Ivy with a beautiful campus 
situated in a bustling city, 
livened with the thrill of 
D-I athletics and Midwest 
tailgating. Such sentiment 
causes a possessive connec-
tion to Ann Arbor for the 
“academic,” making an ac-
ceptance letter an implied 
entry permit for those wish-
ing to take pictures in front 
of campus buildings or cheer 

at sports games. Academic 
Wolverines scored above the 
national average on the ACT 
test and will both implicitly 
and explicitly tell you about 
it, legitimizing their place at 
the University and cement-
ing themselves amongst the 
legacy of Victors.

Ann Arbor has once again 
been ranked the best college 
town in America and the 
University has maintained its 
place as the top public uni-
versity in the United States 
for five straight years. Is that 
elitist for us to constantly 
bring up? The University is 
no exception to statistic and 
rank-heavy marketing strat-
egies that create a sense of 
elitism within students, as 
demonstrated by the pro-
motional brochures which 
declare us “Leaders and the 
Best,” not “Leaders and the 
Humble.” 

With a 23% acceptance rate, 
the school pride that the 
“academic” feels is earned. 
However, our exclusive ad-
mission rate is the reason 
that there are not enough 
block M acceptance letters 
to go around, forcing many 
to purchase such school 
pride through season tick-
ets or branded t-shirts. This 
desire for school acceptance 
goes beyond admission into 
the Ann Arbor classroom, 
for access to a prestigious 
education is not equally dis-
tributable and attainable in 
both financial and societal 
aspects. 

Because of this, the “Walmart 
Wolverine” archetype was 
developed by Spartans and 
exacerbated by the “academ-
ic.” Often defined as a Michi-
gan fan who has no formal af-
filiation to the University, the 
“Walmart Wolverine” gener-

ally lacks a college education, 
tends to have a low-paying 
job and therefore resorts to 
buying 
affordable 
Michi-

gan gear from Walmart. The 
“Walmart Wolverine” is ded-
icated to the sports program 
and the Big House on a great-
er level than the “academic” 
and will recite historical suc-
cesses of the football team 
in extensive detail and with 
heightened enthusiasm. 

With no U-M diploma, the 
“Walmart Wolverine” is so-
cialized to be looked at solely 
as a mindless fan by Spartans 
and contrasts clearly with 
the “academic,” and has not 
earned the right to brag of 
the University’s athletic suc-
cesses and academic pres-
tige. Implying that arrogance 
is confined and acceptable 
only to those who pay U-M 
tuition is in itself arrogant. 

In the largest football sta-
dium in the country, there is 
a delineation between those 
who purchase tickets as 
alumni or current students to 
fill the stands and those who 
purchase tickets out of per-
sonal interest, with no formal 
school attachment. Remem-
ber when fans were seen 
hoisting up a banner read-
ing “Pardon our arrogance” 
in the stands throughout the 
early 2000s? Both teams re-
acted adversely. Filling seats 
and selling tickets has be-
come stigmatized by those 
wearing both green and 
white as well as maize and 
blue, creating rivalry in the 
stands. 

These 
archetypes 
should 

be dismantled, considering 
they stray from the intent of 
the University and the tenets 
upon which it was founded. 
In the words of former Uni-
versity President James B. 
Angell, Michigan was found-
ed and shaped to be “an un-
common education for the 
common man” and woman. 
“‘Have an aristocracy of birth 
if you will,” he said, “or of 
riches, if you wish, but give 
our plain boys from the log 
cabins a chance to develop 
their minds with the best 
learning and we fear nothing 
from your aristocracy.’” 

The two extremes of the 
Wolverine archetypes reveal 
a sense of bitter resentment 
that is instilled by our in-
state rivals to rid the Uni-
versity of inclusivity it has 
fiercely sought to foster. We 
cannot accept and foster this 
sentiment that diminishes 
our mission statement.

Few events are as exciting 
or significant to a film writ-
er as the Oscars. Normally, 
the event offers the chance 
to meet with talented ac-
tors and filmmakers during 
a celebration of some of the 
year’s biggest films. Yet in a 
year filled with delays and 
accommodations, it’s no sur-
prise that things didn’t quite 
look the same at this year’s 
Academy Awards. The typi-
cal January date, along with 
the usual timeline for eligi-
ble films, was postponed by 
three months. The setting 
was, for lack of a better word, 
intimate: Rather than invit-
ing all of Hollywood’s elite, 
the ceremony was made up 
of nominees, presenters and 
plus-ones only, held in Los 
Angeles’s Union Station with 
nominees clustered around 
small tables, as well as sat-
ellite locations around the 
world. The event was regu-
lated by COVID-19 proto-
cols determined by a team 
of epidemiologists (most of 
whom Oscars producer Ste-
ven Soderbergh had met dur-
ing the creation of his film 
“Contagion”). And, unlike in 
normal years, press were not 
allowed into the in-person 
backstage area, but instead 
brought into a Zoom meet-
ing — Michigan Daily writers 
newly amongst them.

Despite Zoom snafus and 
awkward silences, being at 
this year’s Academy Awards 
was an incredible chance to 
view the inner workings of 
the Academy and the press — 
an experience that we truly 
appreciated and enjoyed. For 
one thing, watching a live 
feed of the event without be-
ing subjected to ads was nice; 
for another, it was an honor 
to be present for some of the 
inspiring words from win-
ners that only the press got to 
hear and cherish. So even as 
we were frantically switch-
ing between the ceremony 
and the “backstage” inter-
views — truly, catching the 
tail end of Glenn Close shak-
ing her booty while switch-
ing back from an interview 
about production design was 
unexpected — it was certain-
ly an experience to remem-
ber. Here are some of our 
favorite moments from the 
night. For a full list of win-
ners, click here.

Recognizing those who are 
giving back in Hollywood

The Academy awarded two 
Jean Hersholt Humanitarian 
Awards this year, with one 
going to the Motion Picture 
and Television Fund and an-
other to Hollywood super-
star Tyler Perry. MPTF and 
Perry join the likes of Frank 
Sinatra, 
Audrey 
Hepburn 

and Oprah Winfrey as the 
40th and 41st winners of the 
award, which is named for a 
Danish-born actor, philan-
thropist and one-time MPTF 
president. MPTF, a mutual 
aid organization for the en-

tertainment industry, is cel-
ebrating its 100th year in 
2021. MPTF also operates a 
number of health and senior 
centers in Los Angeles exclu-
sively for those in the indus-
try. The award was accepted 
by Bob Beitcher, current 
president and CEO of MPTF, 
who said in his remarks, “We 
really and truly take care of 
our own.” 

Tyler Perry, the producer, 
director and star of the “Ma-
dea” films, was awarded 
for his philanthropic work, 
which includes picking up 
seniors’ grocery bills, pay-
ing Rayshard Brooks’ fu-
neral expenses and opening 
Camp Quarantine to keep 
Tyler Perry Studios employ-
ees working during the pan-
demic. Perry gave a moving 
acceptance speech, encour-
aging his audience to “refuse 

hate.” He said that he is dedi-
cating the award to those 
who “stand in the middle,” 
adding, “that’s where heal-
ing happens. That’s where 
conversation happens. That’s 
where change happens.” 

Everything’s Coming Up 

Nomadland

Nomadland was the most 
awarded film at this year’s 
Oscars, winning in three of 
its six nominated categories, 
including Best Picture. Crit-
ics and bettors were fairly 
certain 
that 
Nomadland 

would win, and The Daily 
predicted it too. There’s 
something about that sweep-
ing yet subtle narrative and 
grand imagery of the Ameri-
can landscape that was sure 
to win the hearts of the 
Academy’s voters. Frances 
McDormand produced and 
starred in Nomadland, so 
she took the stage twice, also 
winning for Best Actress in a 
Leading Role. 

At the end of the group Best 
Picture acceptance speech, 
McDormand paid tribute by 
howling at the moon to No-
madland production sound 
mixer Michael Wolf Snyder, 
who recently died at age 35. 
Chloé Zhao won the Oscar 
for Best Directing as the sec-
ond woman and first woman 
of color recognized with this 
award. In her remarks, she 

dedicated the win to “any-
one who had the faith and 
the courage to hold on to 
the goodness in themselves, 
and to hold on to the good-
ness in each other, no matter 
how difficult it is to do that.” 
Speaking to the press back-
stage, Zhao’s message was 
clear: “It’s pretty fabulous to 
be a woman in 2021.”

Daniel Kaluuya’s charm and 

passion

After winning Best Support-
ing Actor for his portrayal 
of Black Panther Chairman 
Fred Hampton in “Judas and 
the Black Messiah,” Daniel 
Kaluuya’s acceptance speech 
touched on many different 
topics with breathless ex-
citement. He shouted out co-
star LaKeith Stanfield (who 
was also nominated in the 
category) and praised the 

Black Panther Party for their 
work in the Black commu-
nity: “They showed us (the) 
power of union, the power 
of unity, that when they play 
divide and conquer, we say 
unite and ascend.” He fin-
ished his speech with a can-
did and now viral declaration 
of his conception, but more 
delightful were the words 
that came after: “So I’m so 
happy to be alive, so I’m go-
ing to celebrate that tonight, 
do you know what I’m say-
ing?”

There’s no denying that the 
man is charismatic. Back-
stage, the charm only contin-
ued as he talked to the press. 
He spoke more about the in-
fluence of Fred Hampton and 
the positive impact that “Ju-
das” will hopefully have on 
those who watch it: “The fact 
that I continue to stand on 
this stage is because of what 
he did. I think it’s just that, 
that the legacy will continue. 
It will continue, and people 
will want to engage with the 
story and the film and the 
man.” His passion for the 
story and the role was pal-
pable and really wonderful to 
see. During an event after the 
main ceremony, Kaluuya said 
it frankly: “I just do work I 
believe in.” Kaluuya’s per-
sonality and positivity made 
him a particularly bright spot 
in this year’s event.

Every word Youn Yuh-jung 

said

As the crass, convivial grand-
mother Soon-ja in “Minari,” 
Youn Yuh-jung never failed 
to switch between laugh-
out-loud wit and heartwarm-
ing sentiments with ease. At 
Sunday’s Academy Awards, 
she did the same, accepting 
the award for Best Support-
ing Actress with humility 
and humor alike. She opened 
her speech on a light note: 
“As you know, I’m from Ko-
rea and actually my name is 
Yuh-jung Youn, and most 
of European people call me 
Yuh-Youn and some of them 
call me Yuh-jung. But to-
night, you are all forgiven.” 
Her joking forgiveness was 
accompanied by a lovely 
thank you to “Minari” direc-
tor Lee Isaac Chung and the 
other “Minari” actors: “We 

became a family,” she said.

In the media center, Youn 
didn’t stop providing some 
of the best responses of the 
night. When answering a 
question about the impor-
tance of new stories, Youn 
spoke about the need to tell 
stories without the need to 
delineate 
and 
categorize 

people. “Even (a) rainbow 
has seven colors,” she said, 
following up this beautiful 
sentiment with another: “We 
have the same warm heart … 
It’s an opportunity for us to 
share in the story together.”

After a long and success-
ful career in Korea, it was 
gratifying to watch Youn 
receive recognition for her 
performance, but it was even 
more wonderful to watch 
her charmingly and humbly 
work her way through press 
questions. At one point she 
joked that she blacked out 
for a moment when present-
er Brad Pitt called her name 
for the award. “I’m still not 
myself,” she told us with a 
smile. “So don’t ask me too 
many questions, please.”

Anthony Hopkins and Chad-

wick Boseman

There were many unusual 
aspects of this year’s Oscars, 
from its small crowd to its 
limited choice in films to 
nominate, but these strange 

circumstances didn’t mean 
that these Oscars were all 
that surprising. The sweep 
for “Nomadland” was ex-
pected, with the exception 
of Best Actress in a Leading 
Role, which really could have 
gone to anyone. The one sur-
prise that the Oscars held, 
the one upset that people 
will be talking about for years 
to come, was Sir Anthony 
Hopkins’s win in the Actor 
in a Leading Role category. 
It’s not that his performance 
was weak or undeserving by 
any means; in fact, many be-
lieved he was most worthy of 
the win. It was just surpris-
ing that Chadwick Boseman 
(may he rest in peace) didn’t 
win the posthumous Acade-
my Award everyone thought 
he would. 

Whether Chadwick Bose-
man was more deserving of 

the Best Actor win than An-
thony Hopkins is up for de-
bate; the events of the night 
just made the whole thing 
more confusing. When the 
Best Picture award was pre-
sented prior to the Best Ac-
tress and Best Actor award, 
most people assumed that 
the Academy was saving Best 
Actor for last to have some 
sort of tribute for Boseman. 
Instead, a shocked audience 
heard Hopkins’s name called 
… and the night was over. 
Having expected to lose in 
his category, Anthony Hop-
kins didn’t attend the show 
on Sunday, choosing to stay 
at home amidst the pandem-
ic and what he believed to 
be a sure loss. The lackluster 
ending to Hollywood’s big-
gest night seemed fitting for 
the year Hollywood has had. 
With so many film releases 
put on hold and so much 
chaos in the entertainment 
industry over the past year 
or so, to have the Oscars end 
with no Best Actor speech 
and a major controversy in 
the category actually seemed 
right, in a very strange, very 
wrong way. Here’s hoping 
the 94th Academy Awards 
fare better than this year’s.

Some of our other favor-
ite quotes from this year’s 

Oscars: 

After being asked what his 
next project would be after 

“Soul”’s success, Peter Doct-
er responded very emphati-
cally: “Sleep. A lot of sleep.”

“I have had a group din-
ner with Kathryn Bigelow, 
and definitely fangirled big 
time,” Chloé Zhao admitted, 
revealing that she did have a 
connection to the only other 
female Best Director award 
winner.

“To begin with, (“Another 
Round”) was a celebration of 
alcohol,” Thomas Vinterberg 
stated, which fits the film’s 
title.

Emerald Fennell confessed 
that the making of “Promis-
ing Young Woman” stemmed 
from her hope “to make 
something … that people 
would want to go and see 
even if it’s about something 
difficult and troubling … and 
you would talk about it after-
wards.” 

For Pippa Erhlich, “My Oc-
topus Teacher” provided a 
“unique opportunity to tell a 
story about love and respect 
and awe between human be-
ings and the natural world.” 

“Oh, there’s absolutely going 
to be an EGOT in my future 
hopefully,” H.E.R. confident-
ly disclosed after winning an 
Oscar on Sunday night along 
with her Grammy earlier on 
in the year.

50 years into her career, 
Yuh-jung Youn announced, 
“I don’t believe in competi-
tion, especially in our field, 
because we are comparing 
different movie(s), different 
war(s).” 

Thrilled with her win in the 
Makeup and Hairstyling cat-
egory, Mia Neal summarized 
her feelings about the night: 
“Listen. I never got married. 
I didn’t go to prom. (This is 
it) all rolled up in one.” 

Tyler Perry’s mother was 
with him during his winner’s 
speech; later on in the night, 
he said, “I could feel (my 
mother) in the moment (of 
my speech). I could feel her. 
Any time I’m up there, I’m 
carrying her with me in all 
she went through and all we 
went through together.” 

A final note

Though the film industry 
has faced many challenges in 
the pandemic, the decision 
to invite press to the Oscars 
via Zoom actually made the 
event more inclusive. The 
Academy was able to wel-
come 400+ individual press 
members from a giant range 
of outlets to join their “Vir-
tual Media Center.” Although 
we had sent in our applica-
tions earlier this month, we 
had no idea that we would 
actually be accepted. This 
accreditation offered us the 
first chance in The Daily’s 
history to watch the Oscars 
not just as viewers, but as 
press.

The Ann Arbor District Li-
brary is a magical place. In 
fact, any local library, book-
store or streetside lending 
library is likely to have the 
best, most authentic book 
recommendations. The Dai-

certainly think so — so, in 
the same spirit of small city 
book recommendations, we 
offer our small list of books 
by Black writers that might 
have slipped past the New 
York Times Best Sellers list. 
Some of these books are 
non-fiction, others are liter-

“Sag Harbor” by Colson 

Whitehead 

Recommended by Daily Arts 

Writer Trina Pal 

“Sag Harbor” isn’t Colson 
Whitehead’s 
most 
well-

known novel. “The Under-
ground Railroad” or “The 
Nickel Boys” would take 
those titles. Yet, the light 
charm 
of 
“Sag 
Harbor” 

makes it my favorite among 
all of Whitehead’s books. 

“Sag Harbor” follows a group 
of Black teenagers at their 
summer retreat in Sag Har-
bor, Long Island, adjacent to 
the wealthy, predominantly-
white East Hamptons. The 
plot is lighthearted and airy, 
but Whitehead’s writing is 
razor-sharp. Most of all, the 
novel is just plain funny. Read 
“Sag Harbor” this spring for 
a glimpse of Whitehead’s 
more comedic but no less ad-
ept work. 

“For Black Girls Like Me” 
by Mariama J. Lockington 
Recommended by Daily Arts 

Writer Lilly Pearce

Mariama 
J. 
Lockington’s 

debut novel is a heartbreak-
ing novel told from the per-
spective of Makeda, a young, 
adopted, Black girl who 
struggles with her identity. 
It’s an important story that 
tackles racism and mental 
illness, while also exploring 
the complex and powerful 
relationships between fami-
lies and friends. Lockington 
incorporates several styles 
of writing — prose, poetry 
and letters — that create lay-
ered dynamics between the 
characters and helps demon-
strate the complexity of dis-
covering who you are. While 
targeted toward young read-
ers, people of all ages will be 

captivated by this coming-of-
age story — it’s a poetic ren-
dition of an essential tale.

“Beyond Survival: Strate-
gies and Stories from the 
Transformative Justice 

Movement” 

Recommended by Daily Arts 

Contributor Brenna Goss

“Beyond Survival” is a col-
lection of essays by a variety 
of organizers, activists and 
authors of color that lays out 
the steps we must take to re-
place punitive mass incarcer-
ation with community-based 
transformative and restor-
ative justice practices. It’s an 
incredibly important read for 
anyone interested in racial 

justice, criminal justice, pub-
lic health and safety. 

“Homie” by Danez Smith 
Recommended by Daily Arts 

Writer Lilly Pearce

“Homie” is Danez Smith’s 
latest collection of poems, a 
radiant array of themes that 
involve remarkable explora-
tions of friendship and grief 
to thunderous examinations 

of the violence and xeno-
phobia that infect our na-

tion. Within these themes lie 

other corporeal narratives 
that touch on race, queer-

ness and illness. Smith crafts 
beautiful intersects between 

their poems that result in 
a perfect constellation of 

poetry. It’s the kind of book 
meant to be read again and 
again, shared among friends 

and held close. “Homie” is a 
profound work of love that 
Smith easily achieves with 
their unparalleled language 

and craft. 

“Dread Nation” by Justina 

Ireland 

Recommended by Daily Book 
Review Beat Editor Elizabeth 

Yoon

“Dread Nation,” by Justina 
Ireland seamlessly incorpo-
rates zombies into U.S. his-
tory, spinning a believably 
complex, exciting and honest 
story of two girls caught in an 
absurd reality. While the U.S. 
is divided fighting the Civil 
War, the zombie apocalypse 
begins. To address the grow-
ing number of deaths, the 
U.S. drafts the “Native and 
Negro Reeducation Act” to 
train children as bodyguards 
for the wealthy. Beyond be-
ing a fantastically addictive 
read, Ireland tackles com-
plex identity issues with 
great asexual and bisexual 
representation. 

“A Song of Wraiths and 
Ruin” by Roseanne A. 

Brown

Recommended by Daily Arts 

Contributor Brenna Goss

Roseanne A. Brown’s novel 
is a wonderful YA book filled 
with magic, myth, tragedy 
and redemption. Both of the 
main characters are cap-
tivating in their own right 
and even more so together — 
even though they’re both try-
ing to kill each other. Brown 
created a beautifully written 
narrative filled with West 
African folklore, adventure 
and a thrilling battle of wits. 
It will keep you glued to the 
page until the very end.

The great enigma of 

Trisha Paytas

To a generation whose years 
of crucial brain development 
were spent watching Filthy 
Frank bake hair into a cake, 
Shane Dawson attempt to be 

funny and gamers celebrate 
bloodshed and gore on the 
physics-based biking game 
Happy Wheels, the word 
“absurd” has lost its mean-
ing. One can only be shocked 
by YouTube’s absolute worst 
so many times; however, the 
blonde-haired, 
vivacious 

Trisha Paytas continues to 
amuse even the most jaded of 
audiences. While creators on 
YouTube almost always fade 
into irrelevance, the mono-
lith that is Trisha Paytas has 
yet to crumble, clinging onto 
popularity via her unpre-
dictable style of content and 
extensive history of contro-
versies long after her start in 
2007.

In the beginning, Paytas 
was relatively tame, post-

ing beauty-related content 
on her channel “blndsun-
doll4mj.” Outside of her 
YouTube channel, Paytas ap-
peared on several television 
shows and music videos, in-
cluding an episode of TLC’s 
“My Strange Addiction” in 

which she confesses her self-
tanning obsession and an ap-
pearance in Eminem’s 2009 
music video for “We Made 
You.” Her humble beginnings 
were 
unremarkable. 
Her 

character — if she had one 
— was that of another early-
2000s California bimbo don-
ning blonde hair and orange-
tinted skin. 

When Paytas started diver-
sifying her YouTube content 
in the early 2010s, things got 
even more interesting. She 
began “trolling” viewers in 
2013, appearing to dumb her-
self down with videos like 
“Why I’m Voting for Mitt 
Romney,” 
“Why 
Women 

Can’t Be Funny” and “Do 
Dogs Even Have Brains?” Af-
ter glimpsing her somewhat 
typical personality in previ-

ous videos, it was not hard 
to tell that these titles were 
written with viewers’ reac-
tions in mind; Trisha Paytas 
was self-aware at this point, 
she got so many views that it 
didn’t matter. 

From this point on, Paytas’s 
steady catalog of beauty tips 
and fashion hauls was inter-
rupted by more and more of 
these jolting, off-topic rants 
until her “normal” videos 
were few and far between. 
Paytas could be praised for 
her savviness: She supplied 
some 
good 
old-fashioned 

not-safe-for-work shock val-
ue and, like clockwork, she 
always got enough attention 
to keep going with vast mo-
mentum.

The turbulent landscape of 
the internet doesn’t let pop-
ular things stay popular for 
long. To stay popular forev-
er, Trisha Paytas had to find 
new ways to entertain.
