The 
Michigan 
Fashion 

Media Summit held its annual 

conference on Thursday via Zoom 

webinar. MFMS had rescheduled 

their original in-person event as a 

result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The student-run group was 

set to host more than 650 people 

at the Ross School of Business 

featuring 16 speakers on March 

20. Thursday afternoon’s webinar 

hosted Caroline Gogolak, vice 

president of retail at SoulCycle 

and co-founder of Carbon38, and 

Tenley Zinke, vice president of 

marketing and communications 

at Fendi Americas. Amy Tara 

Koch, an author, journalist and 

U-M alum, moderated the event.

Gogolak said her interest in 

fashion was spurred from a class 

she took at Parsons School of 

Design. After working at Morgan 

Stanley 
and 
Goldman 
Sachs, 

she co-founded the company 

Carbon38, a luxury activewear 

lifestyle brand. Gogolak joined 

SoulCycle in 2017 after falling in 

love with the brand.

“I thought that retail, although 

it was a somewhat small business 

at that point, had an opportunity 

to grow,” Gogolak said. “It also 

enabled me to really continue 

to just operate and learn more 

in a retail business and also 

learn about brick and mortar 

since most of my business, most 

of my background had been in 

e-commerce. SoulCycle has just 

under 100 locations, so I knew I 

would quickly learn that side.”

Gogolak 
oversees 

merchandising, 
planning, 

allocation, product development, 

supply chain and e-commerce 

at SoulCycle. She described how 

she is adapting to the current 

COVID-19 climate.

LSA freshman Ishi Shukla 

felt lucky to have had her 

Biology 173 lab section earlier 

than others. Her group had 

finished the wet lab portion of 

an assignment to examine their 

own fecal matter before other 

sections later that day.

So 
when 
the 
University 

of Michigan announced the 

suspension of in-person classes 

on 
March 
11, 
Shukla 
and 

her classmates had the data 

they needed to complete the 

assignment. Others did not. 

“For other lab sections of 

(Bio 173), it was definitely more 

tricky,” Shukla said. “Honestly, 

shout out to all the professors 

who have had to put in all this 

extra time to get classes in this 

type of virtual mode because 

they only had two days to do it. 

It’s pretty impressive.”

As a result of transitioning 

classes to online platforms, lab 

courses have been faced with 

the challenge of administering 

the physical components of 

their curricula virtually. In 

an email to The Michigan 

Daily, Tim McKay, physics, 

astronomy 
and 
education 

professor and LSA associate 

dean 
for 
undergraduate 

education, explained how the 

University is adjusting to these 

changes. 

According to McKay, there 

are a variety of approaches 

among lab courses. The most 

common 
is 
for 
graduate 

students 
to 
perform 
labs 

through video presentations 

and then for students to analyze 

the 
data 
produced. 
McKay 

gave Ginger Shultz, assistant 

professor of chemistry, as an 

example: With less than a week 

to move her Chemistry 211 

course online, Shultz and three 

graduate 
students 
recorded 

four weeks of experiments in 

one day for her 771 students.

ANN ARBOR

University of Michigan students 

enrolled in Public Policy 456/756 

hosted candidates for Wards 1, 2 and 

3 of Ann Arbor City Council in an 

online forum Thursday afternoon. 

Students asked candidates about 

transportation, affordable housing 

and climate change.

Anne Bannister, D-Ward 1, is 

running to keep her current seat 

on City Council and is challenged

studies departments at the University. 

Linh Song, board president of the 

Ann Arbor District Library, is the sole 

candidate for Ward 2, the seat currently 

held by Jane Lumm, I-Ward 2. In Ward 

3, Travis Radina, an LGBTQ+ activist, 

Anthony Brown, the digital distribution 

manager at WDET and Evan Redmond, 

a targeting analyst are running for 

the seat currently held by Zachary 

Ackerman, D-Ward 3. Ackerman is not 

running for re-election. 

Disch, Song, Radina and Redmond 

all participated in Thursday’s forum.

Candidates for Wards 4 and 5 

participated in a forum last Tuesday. 

Elections for City Council candidates 

will be held Aug. 4 along with other 

statewide races. 

Lisa Disch, Democrat for Ward 1

Disch said she was compelled to run 

for City Council due to her concern 

for issues such as climate change and 

housing justice shared by many other 

community members in Ann Arbor. 

She said the creativity and quirkiness 

in the community make Ann Arbor an 

engaging place to live.

When 
asked 
about 
housing 

developments in Ann Arbor, Disch 

said student apartment developments 

are bringing significant amounts of 

revenue into the city’s budget. She said 

she supports the creation of a tenant’s 

union and renter’s commission to 

provide support for student renters.

“When we talk about development, 

we need to recognize what development 

does for us and how dependent we are 

on it and how fortunate we are to be a 

place where people want to work and 

want to live,” Disch said.

If elected to the council, Disch 

said she will advocate for the city’s 

new climate initiative A2Zero, which 

launched March 30 and aims to achieve 

carbon neutrality in Ann Arbor by 

2030.

Sens. 
Debbie 
Stabenow, 

D-Mich., 
and 
Gary 
Peters, 

D-Mich., 
participated 
in 
a 

virtual town hall meeting hosted 

jointly by WDIV Local 4, WXYZ 

7 Action News and WJBK Fox 2 

Detroit Thursday evening. The 

two senators answered questions 

from Michiganders about the 

current COVID-19 pandemic on 

topics ranging from the personal 

protective equipment shortage 

in the state to the importance of 

robust COVID-19 testing.

Anchor Devin Scillian from 

WDIV Local 4 stated before the 

town hall began that there is 

no getting around the fact the 

town hall would only feature 

representatives 
from 
the 

Democratic Party.

“We live in times that are 

politically 
charged,” 
Scillian 

said. “Our goal tonight is to 

steer clear of politics.”

Stabenow mentioned it was 

difficult as a state to acquire 

personal protective equipment 

for health care workers as well 

as for those who work in densely 

populated areas.

“It’s been really hard, very 

chaotic 
in 
the 
beginning, 

but we are working with the 

governor’s excellent team to 

make changes,” Stabenow said.

Peters 
addressed 
the 

challenge of scaling up the 

15-minute tests that are being 

used in the city of Detroit. He 

said he is in talks with a number 

of companies in order to ramp 

up production in the private 

sector.

“You have to be able to quick 

test folks,” Peters said. “So if 

you have a person who tests 

positive, their coworkers (who 

are first responders) can get this 

test and stay on their essential 

job.”

One concerned Twitter user 

addressed 
relief 
for 
college 

students who have lost their 

jobs. Under the current stimulus 

package, college students over 

the age of 18 who are classified 

as 
dependents 
under 
their 

parents are not eligible for any 

relief. 

Stabenow said she and Peters 

are working on a bill that would 

allow college students to receive 

a stimulus check of $500 if 

they are currently dependents 

of their parents. She also said 

student loans can be deferred in 

most cases by six months.

“There’s a lot more that needs 

to be done, and I’m hopeful that 

it’s done in the next package,” 

Stabenow said.

One individual asked what 

the federal government can do 

to reduce the disproportionate 

impact 
of 
the 
coronavirus 

illness and deaths in the Black 

community. Peters linked the 

problem to a higher incidence of 

people who had not received any 

type of health care over the years 

and who are thus more likely 

to 
have 
underlying 
medical 

conditions, making them more 

susceptible to COVID-19. 

According to Peters, opening 

up enrollment for the Affordable 

Care Act is important so citizens 

have the resources they need to 

keep themselves healthy.

“We are in a health care crisis 

of 
unimaginable 
proportions 

right now,” Peters said. “This 

pandemic 
has 
exposed 
the 

inequities we have in our society 

in a dramatic way.”

“It’s been an incredibly wild ride, 

especially during these crazy times the 

world is going through,” Gogolak said. 

“But I’m very grateful to be a part of their 

leadership team and to help the company 

through this.”

Gogolak said adapting the company to the 

current situation is about communication. 

She said she has daily calls, and the company 

has realized they need to expand on their 

digital strategy in order to keep riders engaged 

through email and social media.

“We’re giving our riders the ability to be 

a part of our community while being off the 

bike,” Gogolak said. “We’re actually excitingly 

launching our own retail e-commerce on a new 

platform, which will be really supporting the 

fantastic visuals and photography that we have 

been working on, up since the pandemic.”

She defined this digital movement as a 

“cultural phenomenon” with regard to what 

SoulCycle is able to deliver on the content end. 

Gogolak answered a question from an 

attendee regarding how she addresses industry 

competitors in the retail sector. She said the 

company tries to look at more general fashion 

trends as opposed to monitoring the products 

of competitors. From a brand standpoint, she 

said, SoulCycle has a very different business 

strategy than its competitors.

“We’re always keeping our finger on 

the pulse,” Gogolak said. “It’s an in-person 

experience. It’s, you know, in a room that’s 

candlelit with 60 people on a bike and so 

that is a very different experience. But we 

have recently launched our at-home content 

through Variis through Equinox, which is an 

amazing experience.”

Gogolak said with more people working 

from home, activewear will be considered 

as everyday wear. She said she believes 

activewear is resilient and seasonless and, as a 

result, it has a lot of room to grow. 

“I think that people are dressing differently 

today,” Gogolak said. “I think (retail is) going 

to be less about working out and more of ‘how 

do I outfit this with the ready-to-wear that I 

already have in my wardrobe.’”

Finally, Gogolak said SoulCycle’s vision for 

the company is very similar to its original 2020 

operating plan, but they have changed the way 

they are operating to reach that goal, especially 

with regard to their digital plan.

“We’re trying to bring the digital piece 

out,” Gogolak said. “It was almost like perfect 

timing when all of this happened and I think at 

this point, when we come back into business … 

I’m really excited to see how our studios light 

up and how people are, you know, going to be 

craving going to their favorite instructors’ class 

with their friends, even though we’re going to 

have to be operating with social distancing 

in place … I think that that fire will be super 

special when our doors reopen.”

Zinke began her talk by providing advice for 

those interested in going into the industry. She 

described the industry as a meritocracy and 

said it is possible to work your way up through 

hard work.

“You really have to be prepared to work 

extremely hard and demonstrate that you want 

to make the cut,” Zinke said. “You want to 

really make a contribution to something that is 

a group effort, a collective effort. And if you are 

able to do that, and you do get the recognition 

of the people who are the creators in the 

industry, I would say the ones who also worked 

their way up, then … the sky’s the limit.”

She said, however, the business is not possible 

without the people behind the big fashion 

names. At the same time, she referenced the 

fact that the industry requires self-direction 

with regard to career development.

“I’m usually one of the people who are 

helping to make things happen,” Zinke said. 

“And I wouldn’t be here if I wasn’t doing a 

good job at that, and it’s many years in the 

making. But I’ve also had to be very proactive 

in my own career development because it’s 

not an industry that really has a great clear 

directional path that you follow to get from 

point A to point B. You have to be very self-

motivated.”

Zinke compared her experiences working at 

American and European brand headquarters 

and regional offices. She referenced her work 

at Ralph Lauren and Tiffany & Co. as well as 

her roles at LVMH in Europe. She discussed 

how she flows between a regional sales role to 

a broader macro and global perspective of the 

fashion industry.

“I kind of like to toggle back and forth,” 

Zinke said. “I think it makes me a better-

informed business person. And I can really 

speak to my colleagues on the other side of 

the table from a more informed standpoint 

because I’ve been in both regional roles and 

global roles.”

MFMS co-president Delaney Walker, an 

LSA senior, said MFMS was disappointed they 

had to cancel the in-person event but were 

determined to fulfill their mission of providing 

opportunities for students interested in the 

fashion industry.

“We were devastated when we had to cancel 

the MFMS,” Walker said, “We were upset that 

the 600 attendees would not be able to hear our 

speakers and our 54-person student planning 

team would not be able to showcase their 

hard work. But we made a promise to educate 

students on opportunities in fashion, so there 

was no doubt in our mind that we would find 

a way to do it. It was amazing transforming it 

to a webinar because we got to reach an even 

larger audience and learn how to pivot our 

organization in times of adversity.”

Daily Staff Reporter Remy Farkas can be 

reached at rsfarkas@umich.edu.

“Instructors always have a great 

deal of autonomy in the design and 

delivery of their courses, and the 

pandemic 
hasn’t 
changed 
that,” 

McKay wrote. “Sometimes, we have 

to make a big collective decision, 

like moving all courses to remote 

instruction 
and 
Pass/No 
Record 

COVID grading. But the instructional 

team for each course is responsible 

for deciding what course adjustments 

would be best and how to make them.”

LSA freshman Sharon Shaw, who is 

taking both Biology 173 and Chemistry 

211, said the ease of adjustment was 

different for the two courses. Shaw 

emphasized that the consistency of 

her professors’ communication and 

assignment uploads determined the 

success of the online transition. 

“For Bio 173, it has kind of been 

confusing,” 
Shaw 
said. 
“Because 

everything is online, professors can 

technically upload anything anytime 

they want, and this past week my 

professor hasn’t uploaded anything.”

Shaw said she feels her lab courses 

are less rigorous without conducting 

experiments 
and 
collecting 
data. 

She said she misses the in-person 

interactions with her labmates and 

worries she is not learning skills that 

come with hands-on experience. 

“I’d totally rather drag myself to an 8 

a.m. lab,” Shaw said. “I know it sounds 

horrible, but I would much rather do 

that and actually see what’s going on 

in lab and collect my own data than 

just take other people’s data.”

Engineering 
freshman 
Chase 

Hartley’s Math 215 lab still allows 

students to work in groups with their 

former labmates. However, group 

projects for his Engineering 100 and 

Physics 141 courses have been replaced 

with individual work. 

“It’s been a little bit of a struggle 

trying to do physics lab by myself, 

since I’m so used to collaborating with 

other people,” Hartley said. “That’s 

been the toughest part. You just have 

to get into a routine and then figure 

it out.”

According 
to 
McKay, 
grading 

procedures are “very contextual” 

for these courses. He wrote the 

University has encouraged creativity 

and cooperation among instructors 

and students to solve challenges in 

making both large and small changes 

to assignments.

He wrote that each instructional 

team 
determines 
how 
grading 

guidelines change if needed. Looking 

to the future, McKay wrote spring and 

summer courses will show the lessons 

learned from the winter semester. 

“These spring/summer courses will 

incorporate a variety of improvements, 

all made possible by the fact that we 

have more than a weekend to spend 

designing them,” McKay wrote. 

McKay wrote creative ideas were 

emerging in preparation for these 

semesters, including geology classes 

where students will be asked to do 

local fieldwork and contribute to a 

class-wide data set. 

LSA freshman Heather Sherr did 

not initially consider remote learning 

when planning her schedule for next 

fall. She is currently registered for 

two courses with lab sections, but is 

concerned about how they would be 

impacted if courses were to remain 

online.

As a pre-medical student, Sherr 

plans to get other requirements out 

of the way and delay taking courses 

with 
lab 
components 
if 
remote 

learning continues. She feels that this 

semester has helped her work on her 

weaknesses as a student.

“I’m 
learning 
to 
be 
more 

independent with how I get my work 

done and be on my own clock,” Sherr 

said. “I’m setting time management 

skills and setting my own routine … 

and learning how to communicate 

better with my peers.”

McKay 
echoed 
this 
sentiment. 

He wrote students should see their 

responses to this challenge as a 

success. 

“As the end of this term approaches, 

we hope you will be proud of all 

you’ve done to help the community 

get through this, know that this is a 

term we will all always remember, and 

be prepared to continue to help the 

University, our many communities, 

and the world work through this 

pandemic,” McKay wrote.

Daily Staff Reporter Ayse Eldes can 

be reached at aeldes@umich.edu.

“I will do my best to continue to be a conduit of 

communication between the University and the 

city and also to put pressure on the University,” 

Disch said. “I think that the first kinds of things 

I would like to do as a member of City Council is 

to take the pieces of that plan that we can enact 

without spending enormous amounts of money 

and enact them.” 

Linh Song, Democrat for Ward 2

Song is a University alum and lecturer in 

the School of Social Work. She was appointed 

executive director of the Ann Arbor Public 

Schools Educational Foundation, a nonprofit 

organization that works to distribute funds to 

area public schools, in 2014. 

Song said it is important to look at models of 

development across the country when looking 

for affordable housing solutions.

“For me, I stayed here because my 

neighborhood is a family,” Song said. “We 

would all benefit from a bigger, familiar, bigger 

neighborhood. We should welcome folks here. 

And I think we should think creatively and not 

have to rely on developers to fund the work.”

When discussing student voting, Song said 

important public policies come from the people 

within a community. She said she hopes student 

voter turnout increases in the coming years, 

specifically in local elections.

“This is where elected officials are accountable 

to the voices of not just complaints and really 

narrow issues advanced but actually formulating 

them,” Song said. “So I’d hope for greater student 

participation on all levels of local government. 

More students should be at the table, deciding 

Ann Arbor’s future.” 

Travis Radina, Democrat for Ward 3

Radina, who is president of the Jim Toy 

Community Center and the LGBTQ liaison to 

the mayor’s office, said he hopes to be an agent 

for change for affordability issues in Ann Arbor. 

He said he believes political leaders should 

be careful in their use of the term NIMBY, 

meaning “Not In My Backyard,” which refers to 

residents who oppose proposed housing or parks 

development in areas close to where they reside. 

“While I do believe there is widespread public 

consensus in support of smart growth and 

density here in our community and I believe that 

an anti-growth mentality would harm our city’s 

future, I don’t believe that all of our neighbors 

who voice concerns about specific development 

projects are motivated by so-called NIMBYism,” 

Radina said. 

Radina said he thinks the city’s budget 

solutions should be creative so Ann Arbor is 

able to maintain a commitment to providing 

basic services while also avoiding layoffs and 

preventing 
outsourcing 
and 
privatization 

of work, especially following the COVID-19 

pandemic.

Radina is also a University alum and currently 

works as a senior global engagement manager at 

the University’s Alumni Association. During his 

time on campus, Radina was involved in College 

Democrats and said he participated in many 

political movements on campus. He addressed 

issues of gerrymandering in Ann Arbor. Radina 

said he remembered the student voice was 

broken up while he was a student when the ward 

system was introduced in 2015 and students 

found themselves split fairly evenly between five 

wards.

 “I think it’s really important for not only 

council members but candidates for council to 

continue participating in activities just like this 

one so that we continue to have open dialogue 

with students,” Radina said.

Evan Redmond, Democrat for Ward 3

Redmond, also a U-M alum, now works at a 

marketing analytics firm. He said he plans to 

focus a lot of his platform on climate change 

initiatives and on getting Ann Arbor to 100 

percent carbon neutrality in the future. 

“Climate change is key,” Redmond said. “Right 

now DTE is a huge obstacle blocking the city from 

getting 100 percent renewable energy, but what 

we can do is establish a publicly owned electric 

utility.” 

Redmond also talked about how he plans to 

get the University involved in his goals to get Ann 

Arbor to become carbon neutral and place it on 

100 percent renewable energy sources.

“As you know, the University is a state 

institution, so there’s little direct power that 

the Ann Arbor City Council can put on the 

University,” Redmond said. “We also know the 


A 

fter four hours of driving 

from my overnight stop 

in Des Moines, Iowa, I 

crossed the Big Muddy into my 

home state of Nebraska. The leafless 

gray trees paired with the overcast 

sky made the usually lush riverbank 

appear strikingly different from 

how I had always seen it driving 

to and from my mom’s apartment 

in Denver. The view was yet 

another change brought on by the 

coronavirus’s 
dizzyingly 
rapid 

transformation from something 

restricted to distant news reports 

to sending me home from school 

months early. After Spring Break, I 

watched my semester and summer 

plans topple like dominoes as the 

virus spread uncontained. By the 

time I left Ann Arbor with my life 

hastily packed into the back of my 

Mini Cooper, there was only one 

plan left standing in the way of the 

pandemic completely canceling my 

summer: my 21st birthday. While I 

knew the day of my birthday would 

almost surely be spent locked in 

the apartment, it was my mother’s 

present to me, a four-day trip to New 

Orleans, that held my excitement. 

Planned for late May, enjoying the 

bountiful bars and history of New 

Orleans was my final foolish hope.

Defying 
health 
officials’ 

suggestions 
and 
government 

orders aimed at reducing the 

number of people predicted to 

swamp Louisiana’s health care 

system, a group of 1,200 people 

gathered in the state capital of Baton 

Rouge. Shoulder to shoulder, the 

congregation at Life Tabernacle 

Church listened to pastor Anthony 

“Tony” Spell. “We’re free people. 

We’re not going to be intimidated. 

We’re not going to cower. We’re not 

breaking any laws,” he preached. 

In response to the backlash, 

Spell 
says 
his 
congregation 

has a “constitutional right to 

congregate” and they believe that 

the 
coronavirus 
is 
“politically 

motivated.” As they defiantly and 

foolishly gathered to pray, COVID-

19 cases in Louisiana reached 

3,540 on Sunday afternoon. In late 

February, when the confirmed 

number of cases in the United States 

numbered in the 50s, over a million 

people flocked to New Orleans to 

partake in the city’s 321-year-old 

celebration of Mardi Gras. After 

experiencing the fastest increase 

in COVID-19 cases in the world in 

the final weeks of March, the seeds 

of this disaster seem to have been 

sown on Bourbon Street.

A city still suffering from the 

effects of Hurricane Katrina from 

15 years ago, New Orleans is bracing 

to be ground zero of yet another 

natural disaster. While the number 

of cases in New York far outweigh 

those in New Orleans, the death 

rate of COVID-19 patients is seven 

times higher than in New York. The 

reason is simple: “we’re just sicker,” 

explains Rebekah Gee, former 

health secretary for Louisiana. Of 

those who died of the disease in the 

city, 94 percent had a pre-existing 

health condition, and New Orleans’s 

population exceeds the national 

averages for obesity, diabetes and 

high blood pressure. Health officials 

fear that the rapidly declining 

situation in New Orleans is just 

an early taste of what’s to come 

throughout the South.

A region known for its infamously 

decadent cuisine, high rates of 

heart disease make this region of 

America the most susceptible to the 

deadly effects of COVID-19. While 

grandma and grandpa have been 

painted as the likely victims of this 

pandemic, pre-existing conditions 

make anyone that has them — no 

matter how young — susceptible to 

the deadly effects of the virus. These 

groups of individuals are the people 

that other governors have acted so 

proactively to save.

Despite 
this 
alarming 

information, many of the region’s 

state governors have been the most 

stubborn to implement public health 

measures. Outside of Louisiana 

Gov. John Bel Edwards’ quick, 

foresightful actions, almost every 

other governor in the South has 

been a role model on how not to act 

during a global pandemic. Georgia’s 

Republican governor, Brian Kemp, 

admitted that he had just learned 

about asymptomatic carriers on 

April 2. While his ignorance is 

seemingly the most inexplicable, 

others have been equally resistant 

toward letting facts steer their 

decision-making through this crisis.

Gov. 
Ron 
DeSantis, 
R-Fla., 

drew criticism the earliest when 

thousands of students on Spring 

Break 
were 
filmed 
crowding 

beaches. Despite early warnings 

that the state would become a 

“hotspot” 
if 
measures 
weren’t 

taken quickly, DeSantis languidly 

issued a state-wide stay-at-home 

mandate to his 18 million citizens 

on April 2, after 30 other states had 

already implemented precautionary 

measures.

This 
inaction 
by 
Southern 

governors puts those with pre-

existing health conditions at high 

risk. Because of existing health 

disparities 
that 
make 
racial 

minorities more likely to have 

these risk factors, the burden of this 

disease will not be shared equally 

among citizens. The disparities 

can be seen far outside the South in 

our own state of Michigan, where 

African Americans make up 70 

percent of COVID-19 fatalities in 

places like Chicago and Louisiana. 

Similarly, Native Americans, who 

have the highest rates of pre-

existing health conditions, are 

seriously concerned for the survival 

of their communities. “When you 

look at the health disparities in 

Indian Country… we could get 

wiped out,” said Kevin Allis, chief 

executive of the National Congress 

of American Indians. 

With the response to this 

disaster now in the hands of the 

states, there is no way to ensure that 

these disparities will be accounted 

for in our responses to coronavirus, 

greatly exposing the need for 

federal action that lawmakers and 

governors struggling with this crisis 

have been requesting for weeks. Rep. 

Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., and Sen. 

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., called 

for the federal government “to step 

up in a big way,” in addressing these 

potential inequalities, including 

access to testing and treatment. 

While President Donald Trump has 

been infamous for trying to flex his 

executive power, he is refusing to do 

so at the most significant point in his 

presidency.

As the country braces for one 

of the worst nationwide disasters, 

my 21st birthday is likely to fall as 

another, altogether unimportant 

victim of the virus. While life in 

the “Big Easy” — New Orleans — is 

becoming more difficult by the day, 

it would be a lot harder if not for the 

swift action of their government. 

Other cities throughout the South 

may not have it so easy thanks to 

their inept leaders. With cases 

resurging in parts of Asia that 

thought they had it under control, 

federal inaction could lead our 

nation to the same fate.

A 

s the United States continues 

to 
battle 
the 
COVID-

19 pandemic, millions of 

Americans working essential jobs put 

their lives on the line every time they 

go to work. In particular, hospital 

and health care workers across the 

country have risked their lives daily, 

working to treat patients fighting 

the coronavirus without the critical 

masks 
and 
personal 
protective 

equipment they need. In a recent 

interview on “60 Minutes,” one 

medical worker from a New York City 

hospital described the scene inside 

the hospitals as “Hell on Earth.”

With the COVID-19 pandemic now 

claiming more than 30,000 lives 

across the nation — including a 

high but unknown number of health 

care workers who have succumbed 

to the virus — the coronavirus has 

set off a calamitous chain of events 

for our nation. Many Americans 

have questioned what the federal 

government has done over the years 

to prepare for the kind of event we 

find ourselves in today, along with 

the resulting medical and economic 

implications.

While 
our 
nation 
continues 
to 
grapple 

with the effects of the pandemic, it’s 

clear that our government wasn’t 

prepared to fight a highly contagious 

respiratory 
disease 
like 
the 
coronavirus. 

If the proper steps had been taken — 

and 
our 
stockpile 
of 
N95 
masks, 
personal 

protective equipment and ventilators 

had been maintained — our hospitals 

and health care workers wouldn’t be so 

overwhelmed right now. As one nurse 

said in the same 60 Minutes interview, 

“Every health care worker infection, 

every health care worker death is 

preventable.”

In 
response 
to 
the 
federal 

government’s 
clear 
lack 
of 
preparedness, 

the Trump administration, which 

currently 
oversees 
the 
nation’s 
response 

to COVID-19, has gotten the brunt of 

the blame. The New York Times wrote 

a recent article detailing what so many 

Americans believe to be countless 

missteps by the current occupant of the 

Oval Office.

It 
is 
true 
that 
President 
Donald 
Trump 

has had a lot to do with our country’s 

response 
to 
the 
coronavirus 
crisis. 
While 

many critics claim he should have taken 

action sooner, Trump has done the 

best job possible with the tools he was 

given by his predecessors and the data 

available at that time. The president 

has taken a number of common-sense 

steps that have protected millions of 

Americans 
from 
contracting 
COVID-19, 

as I detailed in my last column. 

The truth is that in order to really look 

at our nation’s response to COVID-19, 

we have to look back in time. Long 

before Trump was elected president, 

history shows that our government 

had the chance to prepare for a 

pandemic like the coronavirus a 

decade ago, after the worst of the 

2009 H1N1 pandemic.

According to the Centers for Disease 

Control and Prevention, the H1N1 

influenza virus was first detected in the 

U.S. in the spring of 2009. By April 2010, 

the CDC estimates that over 60 million 

people within our borders were infected 

while 12,000 people died. While the 

situation caused by H1N1 cannot be 

compared to the national shutdown 

we are currently experiencing today, 

this virus was considered a pandemic 

nonetheless.

In the midst of the spread of H1N1, 

which hit younger people who didn’t 

have the antibodies to fight off this flu 

strain harder, the federal government 

turned to its stockpile of critical medical 

supplies and equipment that is typically 

only used in extreme situations (like a 

pandemic). According to a study in the 

journal of Health Security, “75 percent 

of N95 respirators and 25 percent of face 

masks contained in the CDC’s Strategic 

National 
Stockpile 
(100 
million 
products) 

were deployed for use in health care 

settings over the course of the 2009 

H1N1 
pandemic 
response.” 
Despite 
calls 

from medical experts to build up the 

national stockpile in order to prepare 

for the next pandemic, President Barack 

Obama’s administration failed to do so, 

according to a USA Today Fact Check 

in response to a Daily Wire article 

published in March.

The truth is that Barack Obama was 

president during a medical event similar 

to COVID-19. His administration knew 

the risks of failing to rebuild the national 

stockpile of masks and other equipment, 

but failed to actually replenish that 

critical stockpile. While this inaction is 

not solely to blame for the fallout from 

the coronavirus, it undoubtedly has 

contributed immensely to the calamity 

we are living through today. Sadly, our 

depleted stockpile, paired with this 

highly contagious respiratory disease, 

has created the perfect storm, a storm 

that was somewhat preventable.

Ultimately, our society has had 

enough warnings. We lived through 

the H1N1 pandemic and continue to 

confront 
the 
COVID-19 
pandemic 
today. 

Meanwhile, we remember other health 

crises that threatened millions across 

the world in the past, including SARS, 

MERS and Ebola. There will be another 

pandemic, sooner than later, that makes 

its way into our country. Before that 

happens, we owe it to ourselves and future 

generations to invest in medical supplies 

and prepare ourselves, so we don’t have to 

watch 
thousands 
die 
and 
millions 
risk 
their 

lives at the expense of our inaction.

Once 
COVID-19 
subsides, 
we 
must 
begin 

conversations immediately about how we 

will begin to rebuild our national stockpile 

of emergency medical supplies, because 

we cannot make the same mistake twice. 

We have an obligation to learn from 

our inaction after H1N1 and prevent 

something 
like 
the 
current 
pandemic from 

ever happening again.

MUSIC REVIEW

Given the current circumstances, the 

future for small music scenes like hardcore 

is uncertain. Gigs can’t be played and bands 

can’t be paid, so what are bands to do? 

Recorded releases give a band an audience, 

but records are expensive and don’t pay the 

bills; performances pay the bills, and now 

bands can’t perform, leaving them with 

outstanding invoices, recording fees and 

unsold merchandise. Bands are making no 

money and their livelihoods may be at risk. 

A good way to support your favorite artists 

during these times is to purchase their work 

or merchandise on Bandcamp, until they can 

finally start touring again. 

***

Sunshine has always been associated 

with good times and good moods. It’s 

a universal feeling, eagerly waiting for 

spring to come after a long, cold winter. 

It’s impossible to have a bad day if it’s 

sunny, so we always look forward to the 

next day of sunshine. This isn’t exactly 

the case in places with continuous sun, 

like Santa Cruz, California. A sunny day 

is just another day, with no guarantees 

of a pleasant charm. Go-go vocalist Sam 

Ciaramitaro and the rest of his fun-loving 

wrecking crew, the hardcore punk band 

Drain, know that better than just about 

anyone.

The 
Santa 
Cruz-based 
band 
plays 

a brand of hardcore that’s distinctly 

them; their music is fast, aggressive and 

constantly on the verge of losing control, 

but most importantly, it’s an absolute blast 

to listen to. They’re heavily influenced 

by ’80s thrash metal and incorporate that 

sound seamlessly with the typically slower 

paced leanings of hardcore. However, 

Drain sets itself apart from the fray with 

leadman Ciaramitaro, the band’s neon-

shorts-wearing fire-starter. In hardcore, 

many lyricists tend to focus on how the 

band isn’t like anything in ordered society 

and if you’re against anything they say, 

get the fuck out because you don’t get it 

and you never will. While Ciaramitaro’s 

lyrics have plenty of that, they have many 

heart-wrenching moments as well. Drain’s 

newest release, California Cursed, leans 

fully into these moments, simultaneously 

opening eyes and cracking skulls.

California Cursed plays out more as 

a confessional than a hardcore record. 

Ciaramitaro wears his heart on his sleeve 

from the get-go, even though it’s difficult 

to hear when he’s shredding his vocal 

chords and bouncing off the walls at a 

million miles an hour. On lead single and 

early standout “Army of One,” a redux of 

a 2018 demo track, he talks about all the 

undesirable work he’s had to do just to 

scrounge up enough money to buy some 

groceries, and if you look down on him 

for it, you don’t understand what it’s like 

to struggle. “You weren’t broke with me / 

You weren’t naked with me / I had to wait 

for that sleazy man to give me my fuckin’ 

money,” he screams as the rest of the band 

lays down filthy bass lines, blazing guitar 

solos and thoracic cavity-crushing drum 

blasts, recounting the times he posed nude 

for a community college art class run by a 

perverted old man. 

Album opener “Feel the Pressure,” on the 

other hand, starts on a much calmer note. 

After hearing seagulls cackle for a few 

moments, someone crashes into the ocean 

and gasps for air as the band slowly comes 

into focus. Guitarist Cody Chavez chugs 

by himself for a bit, only for the rest of the 

band to join him and rip down the walls. 

It’s a song made to be played live because 

it gives pit members just enough time to 

acquaint themselves with the atmosphere 

before the carnage begins. After a quick 

breakdown 
about 
halfway 
through, 

Ciaramitaro disapprovingly shrieks at 

his detractors, “I feel the pressure of a 

thousand eyes / Staring at me / They want 

to see me fall / HA-HA / Yeah right man! 

You won’t see me at all,” in a moment made 

for two-stepping.

Drain only takes a brief mid-album 

break with the foreboding “Hollister 

Daydreamer,” meant to serve as both a relief 

from the carnage and a warning of what’s 

to come. The next three songs, particularly 

“White Coat Syndrome,” are all absolute 

shitrippers as the band kicks things into 

overdrive. Ciaramitaro touches on topics 

like mental health, self-corruption and 

the urge to do your family right even when 

the going gets tough. During a particularly 

powerful segment of “The Process of 

Weeding Out,” he tugs on the heart strings 

by exclaiming, “I can’t let down / The 

ones I love / I can’t let the ones I hate / Be 

right / I’ve got the strength / I’ve got the 

light.” The entirety of California Cursed 

serves as a build up to the album closer, the 

eponymous “California Cursed.”

“California Cursed” is a love letter to 

Santa Cruz, even though at times it has 

been a source of such anguish for the band. 

The project is Drain’s brand of hardcore 

executed to perfection as every member 

reaches deep into their bag to pull out all 

the stops, but it’s Ciaramitaro who steals 

the show. “I’m a slave to the curse and 

it’s getting worse / California Cursed / 

I was born here and I’ll die here / Until 

that day, this is where I’ll be / This state 

has swallowed me whole / Suck me down 

and set me free.” Ciaramitaro and the rest 

of Drain all know that, more often than 

not, sunshine does not equal good times, 

but they wouldn’t have it any other way. 

They’re all cursed, but it’s the only way 

they’ll ever set themselves free.

Drain opens eyes with new album ‘California Cursed’

FILM REVIEW
‘And Then We Danced’ is simple, yet heartbreaking

EMMA CHANG
Daily Arts Writer

The world of professional dance is 

ruthless — the beauty we see as an 

audience is often the result of years of both 

psychological and physical damage. To 

become a principal dancer in any kind of 

dance company requires a certain amount 

of discipline that the average person doesn’t 

have. Every dancer, whether they’re just 

starting out or are at the peak of their 

career, has questioned not only whether 

they’re technically good enough, but also if 

they have the “look.” For ballet, this means 

long, sinewy limbs that can gracefully 

hold impressive positions. Meanwhile, in 

other styles of dance, 

this 
might 
mean 

impossibly fast feet 

or sharp movements 

that look effortless. 

In 
“And 
Then 

We 
Danced,” 
the 

audience is exposed 

to 
the 
Georgian 

tradition of dance, a 

strong 
conservative 

style 
that 
values 

masculinity 
and 

confidence. 
It’s 
a 

style that leaves no room for someone 

unsure of the choreography, let alone their 

own identity.

Dance films have a very set formula 

— think along the lines of “Save the Last 

Dance” with Julia Stiles. They begin by 

introducing the main protagonist, a person 

who has dedicated their entire life to 

perfecting their technique, yet something 

is either missing from their performance 

or their career is derailed. Enter the 

rebellious newcomer; naturally talented 

with seemingly little care for the amount of 

work that others may have put in to gain a 

spot in the company, this character always 

turns the world upside-down. Whether it’s 

their unorthodox style or simply the fact 

that they are somehow effortlessly better 

than the entire dance corps, there is always 

something intriguing, and off-limits, about 

this new person. 

Though “And Then We Danced” follows 

this classic narrative with little flexibility, 

there 
are 
small 
moments 
sprinkled 

throughout the film that set it apart from 

the generic movies that often come out of 

powerhouses like Netflix. The opening ten 

minutes are efficient 

— 
they 
introduce 

the intensity of a 

Georgian 
dance 

rehearsal and both 

the 
mental 
and 

physical toll it takes 

with barely a word 

from 
any 
of 
the 

characters. In barely 

two 
scenes, 
“And 

Then 
We 
Danced” 

establishes a base for 

its story that takes 

some films thirty minutes. 

Not only are we introduced to Merab’s 

(Levan Gelbakhiani, debut) current world, 

we also watch the moment everything 

changes with the unexpected entrance 

of Irakli (Bachli Valishvili, “Until 1 

PM”). Silence cuts through the scene 

and the studio floor becomes divided; 

it is no longer an internal struggle 

between company dancers vying for duet 

opportunities. Now, the question lies in 

how this newcomer is going to affect the 

already delicate balance of the company. 

The story unfolds predictably — Irakli is 

a talented dancer, better than most, and 

his carefree attitude upsets the status quo. 

Little else is said, but as the scene comes to 

a close the audience watches Merab gaze 

at Irakli, prompting a sense of fascination 

with this new character. 

The next step in most dance films is to 

address the tension between our two new 

protagonists. Will they train together? 

Will they compete? Potentially both? 

Whatever way a film chooses to bring 

them together, the chemistry between 

the two characters must be clear. “And 

Then We Danced” takes little stock in 

conversation. Instead, the connection 

between Irakli and Merab is highlighted 

with a dance. The first time we see the 

two dance together is also the first time 

Merab is shown actually enjoying himself 

at rehearsal — his movements become 

more fluid, his performance imbued with 

a healthier sense of self in relation to 

Georgian dance. It’s the first time we see 

him at ease on the studio floor, and it’s 

beautiful to watch. 

“And Then We Danced” is a typical 

coming-of-age dance story. It highlights 

the sacrifices that people make when they 

try to monetize their art, and the effect 

that emotion can have on the way art is 

seen in the world. The minute someone 

puts their creative ventures on display, 

they risk facing the kind of debilitating 

rejection that can take away all of the 

passion needed to create art well. At 

the same time, though, if an artist has 

found a certain level of confidence, an 

understanding of both themselves and 

their art, this passion is untouchable. 

Throughout “And Then We Danced,” the 

audience watches as Merab struggles with 

this understanding, eventually finding it 

in heartbreak.

Peter 
Kispert’s 
debut 
collection 

of short stories is linked together by 

characters who, in one way or another, 

lie to their loved ones. These lies are 

sometimes 
huge 
and 
elaborately 

maintained for months. The title story, 

for instance, is about a narrator who 

makes up a friend so that his boyfriend 

doesn’t think he’s lonely. When the 

narrator’s boyfriend gets suspicious, 

the narrator hires an actor to pretend 

to be the friend and meet both of them 

for coffee. Kispert’s book travels the 

continuum between harmless white lies 

and the complete fabrication of one’s 

own identity, prompting questions such 

as what it means to be truthful, what lies 

do to relationships and how lies shape 

our own perceptions of ourselves. 

The first thing that struck me about 

this book was how hard it was to hate the 

main characters, despite knowing the 

often deep and serious lies they’ve told. 

Though very few of them draw a strong 

sense of sympathy from the reader, none 

can be thought of as bad people. I imagine 

this is due to Kisper’s shying away from 

turning his characters into unreliable 

narrators. Though many of the stories 

are told in the first person from the 

point of view of habitual liars, there is no 

indication that the characters are being 

dishonest to the reader. They’re usually 

open about their flaws, so the reader feels 

hyperaware of the characters’ thought 

processes. 

This method of keeping characters 

relatable does, however, come at a 

cost. A character type that is explored 

frequently in this book is the compulsive 

liar. Kispert attempts to introduce 

complexity to the reader’s perception 

of such characters by portraying them 

not as someone who simply lies a lot, 

but as someone whose state of mind is 

comparable to that of an addict. Essential 

to this goal is maintaining the reader’s 

trust by avoiding the unreliable narrator. 

This strategy is successful insofar as it 

creates characters that, if not worthy of 

praise, are at least worthy of sympathy. It 

falls short when Kispert tries to express 

the cognitive dissonance that allows 

these characters to simultaneously 

value their relationships while also 

jeopardizing those relationships with 

their habitual lying. Kispert intends to 

portray them such that their lies aren’t 

malicious. They’re just trying to salvage 

their relationships, but fail to realize 

that their dishonesty causes more harm 

than whatever is avoided in telling the 

lie. When told from the first person, they 

seem to recognize this, but they can only 

be sympathized with insofar as they fail 

to recognize it.

The best example of this is in 

“Rorschach.” The narrator is attending a 

pseudo-therapy session with Noah, a guy 

he’s interested in. Noah asks the narrator, 

“How does that make you feel? That you 

don’t feel sick?” The narrator then thinks 

to himself and the reader, “I gave him 

an odd look — what a stupid question. A 

little mean, but I excused it. I hoped my 

intelligence hurt him.” The narrator in 

this case is too deliberate in his thinking 

to be sympathetic. There’s no inner 

conflict; he isn’t fighting his character 

flaws, he’s leaning into them. The 

narrator can only be as honest with the 

reader as the narrator is with themself, 

but for the reader to sympathize with 

the narrator, the narrator needs to be 

somewhat dishonest with themself and 

therefore the reader. This puts Kispert in 

a catch-22 where he can’t fully make his 

point without breaking the reader’s trust, 

so the characters come off as too self-

aware, too clear in their thinking. This 

paradox is, of course, a huge part of what 

makes the subject matter so interesting. 

I think Kispert strikes a good balance 

between these two poles, but ideally 

there would be a way to circumvent the 

problem altogether.

Another major theme Kispert works 

with is how truth and lies are related to 

homosexuality. The main character of 

nearly every story in the collection is a 

gay man, and their lived experiences as 

gay men color how honesty manifests 

itself in each of them. The book deals 

with characters who have had to hide a 

fundamental part of their identity, using 

them as thought-provoking test cases 

for the question of when, if ever, is it 

acceptable to lie. This is exemplified in 

“River is to Ocean as ____ is to Heart,” in 

which the main character, Ty, negotiates 

with himself his desire to be seen as 

masculine as he cautiously comes to 

terms with his homosexuality. This 

creates an inner conflict that complicates 

questions about honesty. 

“I Know You Know Who I Am” 

grapples with interesting philosophical 

problems by grounding them in real 

experiences and presenting the nuance 

that emerges. Kispert is careful not to 

spoon-feed the reader answers, and 

instead remains agnostic on difficult 

questions he doesn’t have the answers to. 

Kispert’s book is worth a read and, given 

that it’s his first, I’m optimistic about 

anything he might write in the future.

BOOK REVIEW

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK
A few not so famous last words

ELI RALLO

Daily Arts Writer

Sometimes, writing pours from 

me— hours fall from my grip and the 

practice renders me tranquil by way of 

its leisurely, meditative nature. Poems 

fill pages and characters in lengthy 

plays and short stories begin to write 

themselves— I can see the whites of 

their eyes between the lines of a bright 

document by the time I reach their final 

words. Other times, writing reminds 

me of an unending uphill sprint. Lately, 

I’ve felt winded.

I digress. 

J.K. Rowling wrote her way out of 

extreme poverty. Sylvia Plath wrote 

through seven years of crippling 

manic-depressive 
disorder. 
Emily 

Dickinson managed lively poems from 

the bouts of self-seclusion. Hemingway 

wrote through a first-hand experience 

with both World Wars and diagnosed 

Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy. 

I remind myself of all of these 

literary heroes when I hit a brick wall 

of writer’s block, armed with nothing 

but my weak arms to knock it down. 

It isn’t a helpful practice, but one I 

fall into nonetheless. When all of this 

happened, I told myself: I should write. 

But I sit down with the greatest of 

intentions and it’s not that easy. These 

days, unless met by a deadline, I lack 

the desire to graze my fingers over 26 

letters on a keyboard and tell stories. 

When I’m not putting pressure on 

myself to be productive, I wade in 

hot guilt. I’ve known for a while now 

what I wanted to write my last piece 

for The Michigan Daily about. With 

circumstances, our writing changes. 

Words are malleable. As it turns out, I 

am too. 

***

I joined The Michigan Daily when 

my first serious boyfriend and I broke 

up. On a December night, the brink 

of a predicted snowstorm awaited 

us as I walked away from a person 

whom I thought I loved following a 

hasty conversation in an Ann Arbor 

church parking lot. I retreated to my 

dorm room and tearfully submitted an 

application to The Daily’s arts section. 

I had put off joining any clubs for my 

first semester of college, hoping to 

get settled first. I craved distraction 

and figured joining communities on 

campus would be the remedy. 

Someone recently told me you 

have to let yourself feel everything, 

especially the tough things. At the 

time of the breakup, I hadn’t heard 

this advice. I didn’t want to face the 

tough things. So instead of facing any 

strong emotion at all, I quelled my 

bitter sadness by filling my life with 

clubs and groups and obligations that 

exhausted my days so I hardly had time 

to dwell on love lost. The opportunities 

I sought out to stave off my sadness and 

self-doubt taught me, pushed me and 

enthralled me. I stuck with them — 

theater groups, three minors and every 

writing opportunity I could grasp — 

for all four years of my undergraduate 

education. They entered my life 

at a time when I thought I needed 

distraction, when in fact I needed to 

find myself. I wanted my ex-boyfriend 

to envy my productivity and stacked 

resume though my prospects were 

no longer about him. The choices 

I made both frustrate and ground 

me. I am thankful for choosing to 

join The Michigan Daily and other 

organizations on campus — these were 

good choices. But I needed to do it for 

me and not for the approval of someone 

else. Perhaps this crippling awareness 

is proof of four years of growth. 

I can’t pinpoint the moment I 

decided I was going to dedicate my 

life to writing. I do know that my first 

article for The Michigan Daily was 

published Dec. 12, 2016. It was about 

my passionate distaste for censorship, 

specifically regarding books — my first 

byline. I remember holding the paper 

in my hands in the lobby of East Quad. 

I remember leaving my first meeting 

in the newsroom and calling my 

mom to tell her I felt like I was finally 

“somewhere I was supposed to be.”

In the shadow of global 

trauma, I am drawn to the 

apogee of Midwest Emo — the 
twenty-year-old heartbreaking 
masterwork that is American 

Football’s self-titled album

Sad world? Unleash 

your inner emo

MIDWEST COLUMN

MAXWELL SCHWARZ

Daily Midwest Columnist

Sadness can’t belong to anyone. 

To drown in the swell of sadness is 

as human as breathing, even if the 

thought scares us. At the same time, 

our identifications with others, 

with ideas, with collective identities 

can trap us into shared traumas, 

cornering us into communal misery. 

The 
agonizing 
performances 

through which we disgorge this 

misery become communal, too. The 

screaming, the hollow poetry. In 

the shadow of a global trauma, I am 

drawn back to these expressions — 

to the apogee of Midwest Emo, to 

the twenty-year old heartbreaking 

masterwork 
that 
is 
American 

Football’s self-titled album.

In the mid-90s, something was 

going on in Illinois. Whatever it was, 

it made the youth there feel restless, 

alienated and reflective. Bands like 

Sunny Day Real Estate from Seattle 

were emerging, drawing from sounds 

like Nirvana, U2, Talking Heads and 

Deep Purple to create an iconic, deep 

emotional experience. They released 

“Diary” in 1994 to critical acclaim. 

At the same time, Mark Kinsella 

and his brother Tim were bouncing 

around Champaign, Illinois. They 

put together Cap’n Jazz and released 

“Burritos, Inspiration Point, Fork 

Balloon Sports, Cards in the Spokes, 

Automatic Biographies, Kites, Kung 

Fu, Trophies, Banana Peels We’ve 

Slipped On and Egg Shells We’ve 

Tippy Toed Over” in 1995. It’s been 

out of print for a long time, but the 

raw energy it produced carried on. 

Mike Kinsella initially harnessed 

that energy in creating Joan of Arc, 

a band whose sound featured dark, 

multi-layered acoustics and soft 

electronics. But then came Kinsella’s 

American Football in 1999.

American Football has haunted 

me for a long while now. The hectic 

and thick guitar riffs layered over 

distant, hopeless vocals create a 

sense of nostalgia for something that 

has never existed. The anti-rhythm 

that most of American Football’s 

songs drum along to is both 

affecting and disorienting. Their 

music recalls ideas and memories 

that are aesthetically afflicted. 

The near absence of vocals forces 

listeners to make sense of the layered 

instruments, to paint pictures out of 

the sound. What emerges reaches 

deep into the soul and tears your 

heart out. 

The band’s sound, with its 

irregular time signatures, draws 

on math rock. The songs American 

Football produces are meant to draw 

attention to itself, to break free from 

convention and pattern. Sometimes, 

songs will change time signatures 

mid-song, like in “Honestly,” which 

returns to standard time for its 

extensive riff-driven ending, each 

beat enunciated because listeners 

easily cling to the pattern. Likewise, 

American Football’s sound is heavily 

influenced by indie-rock. Catchy, 

almost-dreamy riffs are layered over 

distant vocals. The lyrics are sparse 

on most of the songs on the LP. It 

isn’t so much what Kinsella is saying, 

but rather the feeling created by the 

sounds collectively, as the album 

moves through a story of nostalgia 

and the loss of innocence. 

There are plenty of choices when 

it comes to picking one’s emotional 

poison. Why not have your heart 

ripped out by Brand New’s “The 

Devil and God Are Raging Inside 

Me” 
(or 
even 
their 
woefully 

neglected “Science Fiction”)? Or 

maybe “Diary” by Sunny Day Real 

Estate. 
Weezer’s 
“Pinkerton,” 

“Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge” 

by My Chemical Romance. All of 

these are good options. 

However, I recommend giving 

Midwest Emo a try. The sound 

is milder, the lyrics hit harder. 

American Football’s careful work 

in creating a gentle detonation has 

led others to reach for the sound. 

Modern Baseball, of Philadelphia, 

was founded with a focus on the 

sound of the ’90s. Empire! Empire! 

(I Was a Lonely Estate) and Hot 

Mulligan, both from Michigan, have 

repurposed Midwest Emo and its 

distinctive sound. Charmer, a band 

based in the U.P., just released their 

album “Ivy” as a quintessentially 

Midwest Emo album. 

The Midwest is so often thought 

of as homogenous, as conservative 

and contained. The Heartland, 

surrounded by country and away 

from the world of the coast. But 

Midwest Emo is about breaking 

free of those conventions, about 

mashing things together until you 

arrive at what feels most authentic 

and honest. While quarantined, we 

might all become suffocated by the 

walls, contained by stay-at-home 

orders. With nowhere to run, where 

do you scream? American Football 

feels that pain. They put it to music.

Hold Manuel accountable for mishandling allegations

Former Michigan wrestler 

Tad 

Deluca 

wanted a 

listening 

ear. 
He 

wanted 

to 
tell 

someone 

what had 

happened 

to 
him, 

and he wanted accountability.

His coach at the time 

didn’t listen. His athletic 

director 
didn’t, 
either. 

Deluca was forced to watch 

as 
then-wrestling 
coach 

Bill Johannesen read his 

nine-page 
letter 
detailing 

his assault by team doctor 

Robert Anderson in front of 

his teammates. Deluca was 

kicked off the team. Athletic 

director 
Don 
Canham 

revoked his scholarship.

At a press conference in 

Feburary, Deluca declared 

to reporters: “I will not be 

ignored again.”

It wasn’t just Canham and 

Johannesen that ignored him.

According 
to 
a 
report 

by the Detroit Free Press 

released Thursday, Deluca 

sent athletic director Warde 

Manuel a letter in 2018, 

detailing Anderson’s abuse. 

University policy stipulated 

that 
Manuel 
report 
the 

allegations 
to 
Michigan’s 

Office 
of 
Institutional 

Equity, which handles Title 

IX allegations. But Manuel 

instead forwarded the letter 

to the University’s lawyers, 

alerting them to potential 

upcoming litigation. It was 

a move that protected the 

University above all else.

“I expect nothing. I want 

nothing,” 
Deluca’s 
letter 

concluded, according to the 

Free Press. “I just feel the 

need to report this.”

Anderson died in 2008. 

The hundreds of athletes he 

abused will never get to see 

him held accountable — but 

that doesn’t mean there was 

nothing more the school could 

do. They could have found 

other survivors. They could 

have figured out if anyone 

who knew about Anderson’s 

allegations still worked in the 

athletic 
department. 
They 

could have done the only 

thing Deluca claimed to want 

and listened.

It wouldn’t have taken 

Manuel much to do the right 

thing. Anderson retired in 

2003, when many of the 

Wolverines’ current athletes 

were in diapers. Few — if 

any — people involved in the 

allegations still work in the 

athletic department. Many of 

them aren’t even alive.

Manuel just had to listen. 

But like the others before him, 

he didn’t.

Deluca’s allegations against 

Canham 
and 
Johannesen 

feel 
distant. 
Canham 
is 

dead. 
Johannesen 
hasn’t 

been associated with the 

University in years. It’s easy 

to look at those allegations 

and think, ‘That was 35 years 

ago. Things are different now.’

But Manuel is different. 

The others were vestiges 

of old times. Manuel is the 

one calling the shots for the 

foreseeable future.

Manuel has done good 

things as athletic director. 

His hire of Juwan Howard 

has been a hit. He’s also made 

several successful hires in 

non-revenue sports, such as 

Hannah Nielsen in women’s 

lacrosse and Sean Bormet in 

wrestling.

But none of that should 

matter if Manuel can’t do 

right by Michigan’s athletes 

— including former ones. 

Nothing in college sports is 

possible without them, and 

it’s supposed to be the job of 

the person in charge to create 

an environment where they’re 

in the best possible position 

to succeed. That means a 

culture 
of 
accountability, 

where it’s clear that abuse 

and misconduct will not be 

tolerated.

When it comes to cases 

of sexual assault, actions 

speak louder than words. The 

message Manuel sent is that he 

was committed to protecting 

the University’s image before 

the well-being of his student-

athletes. That encourages a 

culture of silence — one that 

ensures that things like this 

will keep happening.

Michigan’s Student Sexual 

Misconduct Policy is clear on 

what needed to be done.

“Responsible 
employees 

(including 
Manuel) 
must 

immediately 
report 
any 

information 
they 
learn 

about suspected Prohibited 

Conduct to OIE or the Title 

IX Coordinator,” reads the 

first sentence of the policy. 

“Failure by a responsible 

employee to timely report 

a 
suspected 
Prohibited 

Conduct may subject them to 

appropriate discipline, up to 

and including removal from 

their position.”

The policy sends a strong 

message: This is a fireable 

offense. And if it doesn’t 

cost Manuel his job, he 

should at least face strong 

punishment, such as a hefty 

fine or suspension. This, after 

all, goes deeper than one 

incident. If Manuel escapes 

unscathed, it sends a message 

to future athletes, coaches 

and athletic directors alike 

about who the University 

will protect — and it isn’t the 

athletes.

All Manuel had to do 

was listen and follow the 

correct procedure. All he 

had to do was make it clear 

that if anyone committed 

misconduct again, they would 

be held accountable.

But he didn’t. Instead, he 

protected his school’s image, 

and in the process enabled 

the kind of culture that allows 

abusers to go unchecked.

Michigan’s first priority 

in dealing with a scandal of 

this magnitude should be to 

establish a strong culture of 

accountability, one dedicated 

to making sure this never 

happens again. And now, that 

culture needs to start at the 

top.

Athletic director Warde Manuel did not follow Title IX guidelines.

Taking a hit from Zach Charbonnet: ‘I almost got paralyzed’

Zach 
Charbonnet 
has 

no qualms about playing 

with physicality. In his first 

game at Michigan last fall, 

Charbonnet earned plaudits 

for his pass protection. At 

6-foot-1 and 220 pounds, 

Charbonnet has the strength 

to go through defenders as a 

runner. Sometimes literally.

That’s where the story of 

Nathan Smidt comes in.

Smidt, 
it 
should 
be 

noted, is completely fine 

now. These days, his coach, 

Darren Carr, jokes with him 

about it. There are no hard 

feelings — in fact, just the 

opposite. Smidt interacted 

with Charbonnet for all of 

a millisecond on a football 

field during the 2018 season, 

bodies colliding, bouncing 

off each other, Charbonnet 

hurtling forward against 

undersized competition.

“I tried to hit him,” 

Smidt said, “and almost got 

paralyzed.”

The 
series 
of 
events 

leading 
to 
that 
hit 

started 
the 
week 
prior. 

A 
Bakersfield 
Christian 

safety got suspended for 

the first half of their game 

against 
Oaks 
Christian, 

Charbonnet’s team. Smidt, a 

wide receiver, would have to 

step in.

It was early in the season, 

but already clear that Oaks 

Christian was one of the 

top programs in California, 

thanks in no small part to 

Charbonnet.

“You 
saw 
this 
kid, 

running back, this guy was 

like an Eddie George type 

guy,” Carr said. “You know 

what I mean? Just a huge, 

massive kid. Like there’s no 

way this kid is a senior in 

high school, but we get out 

there, we see them pregame, 

like this guy’s a full-grown 

man.”

There 
wasn’t 
much 

optimism going into the 

game 
on 
Bakersfield 

Christian’s end, in large 

part 
because 
it 
simply 

couldn’t 
bring 
down 

Charbonnet. 
It 
tried 
to 

preach fundamentals — get 

to the football and tackle 

cleanly. Wrap Charbonnet’s 

legs up and 

roll.

But 

Carr 
calls 

Charbonnet, 

“probably 

the 
most 

impressive 

kid I’ve ever 

seen,” in 15 

years as a high 

school coach. 

There was only so much he 

could ask of his team.

Oaks Christian won the 

game 83-0. Things went off 

the rails fast.

Smidt 
hadn’t 
played 

defense 

before. 

On 
the 

game’s first 

drive, Oaks 

Christian 

lined 

Charbonnet 

up 
inside 

on 
a 
trips 

formation 

and 
threw 

him a swing pass. He made 

two corners miss, then saw 

Smidt between him and 50 

yards of grass. He slowed 

down. Smidt dropped his 

head. Charbonnet lowered 

his shoulder and made hard 

contact.

“I just remember right 

when I hit him, just like 

black,” Smidt said. “I just 

remember 
being 
on 
the 

ground.” 

He couldn’t speak or move 

his arms, but he could feel 

them. The game stopped for 

about 30 minutes. There was 

a trainer telling him they 

had to get an ambulance, 

but 
Smidt 
managed 
to 

convince his mom not to go, 

eventually getting helped off 

the field. He couldn’t shake 

a feeling in his arms. Oaks 

Christian had a specialist, 

who told Smidt’s mother he 

needed to go to the hospital. 

He thought it was a bit of an 

overreaction and, he said, 

“I kinda wanted to keep 

playing.” Still, he spent the 

night in the hospital as the 

doctors ran scans.

The next day, the injury 

was initially diagnosed as 

a stinger and Smidt figured 

he’d be able to play in a 

couple weeks. Then the 

doctors took another look 

at the scans. It turned out 

Smidt had fractured his 

T2, T3 and T4 vertebrae. 

He needed to spend four 

months in a brace.

“I was so surprised. I kept 

losing feeling in — getting 

like, 
shots 
of 
numbness 

down my legs and my arms 

and stuff,” Smidt said. “I 

thought that was all just 

part of the stinger.”

Smidt’s 
recovery 
took 

some time, but he got back on 

the field for his senior year, 

and Bakersfield Christian 

won a state championship in 

its division. Charbonnet is 

entering a sophomore year 

at Michigan in which he’ll 

compete for the lion’s share 

of carries. Now, this is all 

just a memorable fragment 

of the past.

“We 
tell 
him, 
man, 

we’re like, ‘Hey, when the 

Pittsburgh 
Steelers 
draft 

(Charbonnet) 
in 
three 

years, you got a story to tell 

everybody,’ ” Carr said.

‘It doesn’t feel real’: ‘M’ Olympians adapting after postponement

Maddy 
Steere 
was 

somewhere over the Indian 

Ocean when her world began 

to change.

She thought she knew what 

the next five months would 

hold. For Steere and the rest 

of the Australian water polo 

team, those five months were 

carefully curated years in 

advance, every action and 

every calorie geared toward 

peak performance in July. 

That’s the month they’ve had 

circled on their calendars for 

years — for some, their whole 

lives. It’s the month of this 

summer’s scheduled Olympic 

Games in Tokyo.

But before the glory of 

Tokyo, the Australians had 

a standard training trip to 

Europe, where they would 

practice with the Italian and 

Hungarian national teams. 

That’s where they were going 

back in February, back when 

they touched down in Dubai, 

not knowing their lives were 

about to change forever.

In Dubai, a short layover 

turned into a nightmare, amid 

news that the coronavirus 

situation in Italy was rapidly 

worsening. 
Throughout 

an uncertain night at the 

airport hotel, team officials 

discussed going straight to 

Hungary, 
before 
awaking 

players to news that they were 

returning home immediately.

A 
month 
later, 
the 

Olympics were postponed, 

thousands of dreams placed 

on a year-long hold.

“It’s so hard to put into 

words how much this has 

affected all of our plans,” 

Steere said. “Every single 

day, for at least the past five 

years, I have been preparing 

to make this Olympic team.”

***

Paul Juda is one of those 

thousands. Like Steere, the 

freshman gymnast is among 

a 
handful 
of 
Michigan 

athletes potentially destined 

for Tokyo.

He was one of those whose 

life changed on that eerie, 

unforgettable Thursday in 

mid-March. The day when 

the Big Ten shuttered its 

winter and spring sports 

seasons, with the NCAA 

following suit a few hours 

later.

“I was literally making 

jokes 
about 
washing 
my 

hands that Monday and then 

that Thursday, everything 

was canceled,” Juda said. “So 

I was like, ‘Wow, OK.’ ”

Felix Auböck, a senior 

from Austria who competed 

in the 2016 games, realized 

something was off when he 

and his teammates on the 

men’s swimming team were 

in the pool, while all six of 

their coaches huddled to the 

side, a serious look adorning 

each of their faces. San 

Marino’s Myles Amine found 

out when wrestling coach 

Sean Bormet stopped practice 

to pull everyone aside and 

console 
his 
heartbroken 

team. A few blocks north, 

Juda, too, found out after a 

standard afternoon practice.

“For the seniors, I cannot 

physically 
or 
emotionally 

imagine the kind of damage 

that they felt when they 

got the news that their last 

gymnastics practice ever was 

a day in the gym,” Juda said. 

“… They lost their season, 

they didn’t have a senior 

night, they weren’t able to 

compete their last meet ever.

But for weeks, as their 

teammates returned home 

to 
cope 
with 
shattered 

dreams, Michigan’s potential 

Olympians 
had 
to 
keep 

training, for an Olympics 

they knew wasn’t going to 

happen — at least not in 2020.

That, they agree, was the 

worst part.

For 
Auböck, 
it 
meant 

swimming in the ocean off 

the coast of California after 

all pools closed. For Juda, it 

meant doing strength work 

through sickness — he tested 

positive for the flu and never 

got his COVID-19 test results 

back. For Amine, who was 

among 
three 
Wolverines’ 

wrestlers taking an Olympic 

redshirt, it meant continuing 

his training without coaches 

or facilities to guide him.

Then, on March 24, the 

International 
Olympic 

Committee announced what 

each 
felt 
was 
inevitable. 

For the first time in history, 

the 
Olympics 
would 
be 

postponed, until 2021.

Across 
the 
world, 

Michigan’s Olympians found 

out like the rest of us — 

through push notifications, 

social media and concerned 

text messages.

“It was a big relief because 

the Olympics were still going 

on but we had no pool space, 

we had nowhere to train, 

all the gyms were closed,” 

Auböck said. “… I think it 

was like a four or five day 

process until they canceled 

it and it felt pretty good, I 

think everybody was pretty 

relieved.”

That 
sense 
of 
relief, 

though, isn’t shared by all of 

Michigan’s Olympians.

Across the world, Steere 

found out in an email from 

the 
Australian 
Olympic 

Committee. Like Amine, she 

took an Olympic redshirt this 

past year to spend the fall in 

Canberra and the spring in 

Sydney, training with the 

Australian national team. But 

while Amine plans to return 

to Michigan in August for 

his senior year, such luxuries 

aren’t available in a team 

sport like water polo.

For Steere, taking another 

year off school is a mandate if 

she wants to compete in 2021. 

It’s an obvious decision for 

her, but that doesn’t eliminate 

its drawbacks. It means that 

her senior season — now 

pushed back to 2021-22 — is at 

the whims of the NCAA, and 

whether it permits a second 

redshirt. 
Regardless, 
she 

won’t graduate until she’s 25, 

a thought that gnaws at her.

“It didn’t feel real,” Steere 

said of the postponement. 

“And honestly, it still doesn’t.”

Two plain black chairs 

sit beside the dinner table 

at Juda’s childhood home, a 

few miles north of Chicago. 

Normally, 
they’re 
just 

that — pieces of household 

furniture.

This month, they’ve been 

transformed 
into 
parallel 

bars, part of Juda’s makeshift 

home workout space. A few 

feet away, he holds himself 

on the corner of their kitchen 

countertops, “just to feel 

some strength.”

He says his parents have 

been supportive, but it’s still 

a far cry from the amenities 

of the sports coliseum in 

Ann Arbor, where he would 

typically be training. This, 

though, is the new life of 

thousands 
of 
quarantined 

Olympians across the world. 

It’s the reason Juda says he 

knew a 2020 Olympics would 

be impossible long before the 

official announcement came 

down, but now, he has no 

choice but to make the best 

of it.

“It’s something that you 

have to realize, well I’m in 

my house trying to figure 

out what can still give me 

that mental preparation and 

that mental satisfaction of 

that sport, even when I’m 

just here,” Juda said. “And 

that’s the biggest thing, I 

think, cause there’s gonna be 

people who come back from 

this coronavirus break and 

are gonna be kinda lost.”

For athletes like Juda, the 

extra year of preparation 

isn’t without its benefits. 

In 
contrast 
to 
women’s 

gymnastics, 
18-year-olds 

competing at the Olympics 

are rare on the men’s side, 

without the added strength 

that older gymnasts have. 

Now, Juda has more time to 

develop that strength.

Amine, too, has come 

around to that school of 

thought 
after 
his 
initial 

disappointment.

“The more that I’ve got to 

think about it, I kinda love 

the aspect of being pushed 

back another year,” Amine 

said. “Because I’m really 

process-oriented and I have 

a training mindset so it’s just 

for me, I think it gives me 

even more time to develop.”

The drawback, of course, 

is that he’ll be back at 

Michigan, 
wrestling 
in 

collegiate 
style, 
rather 

than in freestyle, which 

the Olympics are contested 

in. And though he recites 

the track records of college 

wrestlers who have gone on 

to a successful Olympics, 

there’s 
the 
underlying 

understanding 
that 
if 
a 

redshirt wasn’t preferable 

for preparation, he wouldn’t 

have taken one in the first 

place.

Auböck, 
meanwhile, 

has 
larger-scale 
concerns 

to occupy his mind. He’ll 

graduate when an email hits 

his inbox in a few weeks, and 

then he’ll be out in the world.

For now, he’s staying with 

his girlfriend in California, 

but eventually his student 

visa will expire. Without 

a new one, he won’t be 

able to spend the next year 

training in Ann Arbor — his 

ideal Olympic preparation. 

Instead, he may be forced to 

return home, to a country 

that 
has 
considered 

preventing its citizens from 

traveling 
internationally 

until the outbreak subsides.

“So far, nothing is set and I 

have no idea about anything,” 

Auböck said. “That’s pretty 

much where I’m at right now, 

how my next year’s looking.”

Still, from Ann Arbor 

to Australia, one school of 

thought prevails above the 

rest.

“It’s a lot better than it 

being canceled,” Amine said, 

chuckling into the phone 

from his parents’ house in 

Brighton. “I’ll tell you that.”
