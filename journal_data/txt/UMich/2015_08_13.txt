Campus panel 
commemorates 

anniversaries of Social 

Security, Medicare

By LYDIA BARRY

For the Daily

U.S. House Rep. Debbie Dingell 

(D-Ann Arbor) and her husband 
John Dingell, a former Congress-
man, co-hosted a roundtable dis-
cussion Tuesday at the University 
to discuss healthcare and retire-
ment policy in celebration of the 
recent 50th anniversary of Medi-
care and the upcoming 80th anni-
versary of Social Security.

The Dingell family has histori-

cally had strong ties to Medicare 
and Social Security, as well as Med-
icaid. During his time in Congress, 
John Dingell co-sponsored the first 
Medicare and Medicaid legislation 
in 1965, and his father, John Ding-
ell Sr., cosponsored the bill that 
first created Social Security. The 
first bill Debbie Dingell, who took 
office this January, introduced 
would expand Medicare to cover 
hearing aids if passed.

The Dingells were joined by 

co-hosts John Z. Ayanian, direc-
tor of the University’s Institute for 
Healthcare Policy and Innovation 
and Ford School Dean Susan M. 
Collins, as well as several Univer-
sity health scholars.

To open the discussion, Ayanian 

described the impact Medicare 
and Social Security have made in 
America since they were enacted.

“Medicare and Social Security 

have enormous consequences for 
the health and financial well-being 
of elderly and disabled Ameri-
cans,” Ayanian said. “Without

GOP candidate 
highlights plans to 
halt immigration, 

negotiate with China

By SHOHAM GEVA

Daily News Editor

BIRCH RUN — They came, 

they said, to hear his blunt, 
often-controversial 
take 
on 

issues like immigration, suc-
cinctly summed up in one of his 
more popular one-liners — “We 
need to build a wall (on the bor-
der)”. For his presence, described 
as both arrogant and confident. 
Or because they wanted to hear 
something new.

After the speech some left 

disappointed, 
citing 
lack 
of 

substance to reporters. Others 
called his presence and approach 

to politics what they’d been 
praying for.

For the crowd of roughly 

2,800 gathered Tuesday eve-
ning for Republican presiden-
tial candidate Donald Trump’s 
first visit to Michigan during his 
campaign, he seemed to spark 
high interest overall if nothing 
else, with many breaking out in 
enthusiastic chants and rising to 
their feet throughout the speech.

Trump, who is currently lead-

ing in the polls for the Republi-
can nomination despite a series 
of controversial comments about 
women, immigrants, and mem-
bers of his party, visited the state 
for a sold-out fundraiser hosted 
by the Genesee and Saginaw 
County GOP.

In a roughly 50 minute speech, 

he touched on a range of issues, 
including China, the rest of the 
GOP field, the Obama admin-
istration’s proposed deal with 

Iran, and immigration, among 
others.

On China, Trump cited the 

nation’s recent move to devalue 
its currency, which lowers its 
worth compared to other coun-
try’s currencies.

Changes in currency value 

can have international impacts 
on trade, pricing, interest rates 
and other factors.

“Now, you know what deval-

ue means, right?” he asked the 
crowd. “Devalue means suck the 
blood out of the United States. 
Our companies won’t be able to 
compete. They can’t compete 
now.”

Speaking to the Iran deal 

proposed by the Obama admin-
istration, Trump called it incom-
petent and said it could lead to 
nuclear proliferation.

“The worst thing that can 

happen is a bad deal,” he said.

FBI task force involved 
in case against James 

Daniel Cavalcoli

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

A 
University 
professor 
was 

arrested Friday in Florida after 
attempting to elicit sex from a 
minor.

James Daniel Cavalcoli, an assis-

tant professor of computational 
medicine and bioinformatics, was 
arrested by FBI agents with assis-
tance from the Florida Depart-
ment of Law Enforcement and local 
Sheriff’s deputies on Friday while 
attempting to meet with a 14-year-
old boy.

The 
FBI’s 
Internet 
Crimes 

Against Children Task Force is also 
involved in the case.

Cavalcoli, under the impression 

he was meeting with the child’s 
father, made plans with an under-
cover agent of the Florida Depart-
ment of Law Enforcement, which 
led to his arrest in Weston, Florida.

According to court documents 

acquired by The Michigan Daily, 
the FBI investigation began in 
November of 2013 when an agent 
created a profile on a social media 
site for men looking for sex. The 

fake FBI profile was from the per-
spective of a 55-year-old father 
with a 13-year-old son in Florida.

Cavalcoli, under the name “Jim,” 

responded to the posting: “A fel-
low bl [boy lover] just don’t have 
my own. Wanted to chat and share 
stories and experiences - if you’re 
interested,” and provided his email 
address, according to court docu-
ments.

The two proceeded to com-

municate with one another and 
on November 25, 2013 Cavalcoli 
described to the agent actual sexual 
experiences he has had with boys. 
Cavalcoli told the agent he travels 
to Florida for work every year in 
early August.

According to court documents, 

using a different email address in 
December of 2013, Cavalcoli began 
to talk about his interest in child 
pornography. Months later, Caval-
coli asked for a picture of the man 
and his son.

The agent on May 23, 2014 sent 

an image appearing to be of a father 
and son at soccer practice. The 
image actually was of two adult 
male Florida law enforcement offi-
cers who consented to the photo 
being sent to Cavalcoli.

According to court documents, 

Cavalcoli responded with three 
explicit photos of himself.

In June of 2014, the FBI subpoe-

naed Yahoo for information relat-
ing to the original email address 
used. With the IP address from the 
Yahoo subpoena, the FBI subpoe-
naed Comcast and on July 16, 2014 
Comcast sent information to the 
FBI confirming James Cavalcoli as 
the resident of the address.

Comparing Cavalcoli’s Michigan 

Driver’s License photo to the one 
posted on the website, the FBI was 
able to confirm his identity. Agents 
were able to reaffirm his identity 
by comparing the picture from the 
website to a photo listed on a Uni-
versity website.

On July 19, 2015 Cavalcoli posted 

on the social media site he would 
be in Florida in three weeks and 
emailed the undercover agent on 
July 25, 2015 asking if he and his 
son would like to meet up. Two days 
later the agent agreed.

Several 
emails 
were 
sent 

between the two, according to 
court documents, including one 
where Cavalcoli provided his cell 
phone number which matched the 
one from the Comcast subpoena.

On August 6, Cavalcoli emailed 

the agent: “thanks for organiz-
ing. I’m excited and nervous. Can 
you do me a favor and reassure 
me you aren’t police or FBI afflli-
ated. lt would also be good to meet 
you before going to your room ok? 
I know this sounds strange, this is 
my first time meeting. So just ner-

vous and cautious, ok??”

Court documents say the agent 

responded: “....no pressure if you 
don’t feel right then if ok not to 
come.”

The following day Cavalcoli 

went to a Florida hotel to meet with 
the agent posing as the father and 
son. He was arrested on his way 
into the hotel.

Court documents state: “CAV-

ALCOLI admitted that he was 
“Jim’’ on the social networking site 
and that he had been communicat-
ing with an adult male who had a 
14 year old son named Dormie. He 
admitted that he had arranged to 
meet at this hotel to engage in sexu-
al activity with the minor son.”

Cavalcoli told officers the trip 

was partly for work and also to 
meet up with the boy and his father. 
He also admitted to sending explic-
it photos and stated he regretted 
coming.

Several electronic devices were 

taken from Cavalcoli by police 
officers — including his laptop 
— to assist in their investigation. 
Police say the laptop is undergoing 
forensic examination, according to 
WXYZ.

Mary Masson, a University 

Health System spokesperson, told 
the Daily the University intends 
to work with law enforcement 
throughout the investigation of this 
case.

Multiple campus buildings 
flood following heavy rain

Water damage causes 

closures in Angell 
Hall, North Quad, 

CCRB

By LYDIA BARRY

For the Daily

Multiple University buildings 

were flooded after a severe thun-
derstorm 
Monday 
afternoon. 

According to the Department of 
Public Safety and Security, the 
specific buildings damaged and the 
extent of those damages remain 

unknown at this time.

“There were several buildings 

on campus that were flooded today 
because of the torrential down-
pour,” said Diane Brown, DPSS 
public information officer. “I don’t 
have any reports about which of 
the specific buildings, nor do I 
know if it was just water coming in 
through the door, or if it was more 
substantial, and we won’t know 
any of that tonight.”

Daily reporters witnessed water 

in North Quad and the CCRB. 
According to the LSA Facebook 
page, three classes were relocated 
Monday night due to flooding in 
Angell Hall.

According to Occupational Safe-

ty and Environment Health at the 
University, flooding has impacted 
the campus greatly over the past 
few years.

“The University of Michigan 

(U-M) has experienced a signifi-
cant amount of flooding in recent 
years, affecting over 10 percent of 
its 500 buildings across the 1,500 
acre Ann Arbor campus,” the 
OSEH website says. “Considering 
the complexity of U-M’s campus, 
the damage to facilities and equip-
ment caused by flooding can lead 
to substantial problems.”

Many schools in 

Michigan currently 
make notification 

voluntary

By LEA GIOTTO

Summer Daily News Editor

Republican United States Reps. 

Matt Salmon of Arizona and Kay 
Granger and Pete Sessions, both of 
Texas, proposed a bill to Congress 
that requests colleges and universi-
ties notify police after receiving a 
report of sexual assault before the 
school launches its own investiga-
tion.

The bill additionally states that 

if the police are not informed of the 
reported assault, the school is pro-
hibited from taking action.

The passing of this bill would 

impact the way many of Michigan’s 
public universities handle sexual 
assault. Currently, only about half 
of the state’s public universities 
notify police as soon as a sexual 
assault is reported; the University 
is not one of them.

With the passing of the Univer-

sity’s new Sexual Assault and Mis-
conduct policy last August, victims 
of sexual assault can decide for 
themselves whether or not they 
wish to launch a criminal investi-
gation of their case, which would 
then be handled independently by 
the University Police Department 
or the Ann Arbor Police Depart-
ment.

One of the groups advocating for 

the bill is the Fraternity and Soror-
ity Political Action Committee, 
a political group in Washington, 
which aims to preserve and and 
defend greek life experience.

“Criminal 
acts 
should 
be 

addressed by the police,” Kevin 
O’Neill, the group’s executive 
director, told the Detroit Free 
Press.

Certain victims’ rights and 

sexual assault survivor groups say 
required police involvement may 
create further emotional turmoil 
for the victim of the assault, as 
many often feel re-victimized by 
the criminal justice system.

They note the bill would vio-

late the federal Title IX act, which 
states colleges and universities 
must investigate sexual assault and 
misconduct claims.

According to the Detroit Free 

Press, some survivors of sexual 
assault feel their cases were not 
handled seriously when only pur-
sued by university administrations, 
but that they fear the emotional 
turmoil often accompanied when 
there is police and judicial involve-
ment.

The proposed bill would also 

allow universities to choose which 
standard of evidence they would 
like to use when considering a 
sexual assault case. Currently, the 
government requires a “prepon-
derance of the evidence” standard 
to be used by universities in each 
case. This standard is more easily 
proven than the “beyond a reason-
able doubt” standard used within 
the criminal justice system.

University 
spokesman 
Rick 

Fitzgerald told the Detroit Free 
Press that the University will 
anticipate the outcome of the bill, 
but noted the University does take 
several measures on its own when 
handling sexual assault cases.

“Under our policy, the Universi-

ty already takes interim measures 
such as moving one party out of a 
residence hall that the two par-
ties may share or changing class 
schedules,” Fitzgerald said. “In 
addition — and consistent with 
current federal guidance — the 
University is permitted to delay 
temporarily its fact finding during 
the evidence gathering phase of a 
criminal investigation, although 
the University may not delay until 
the entire criminal investigation is 
complete.”

Bill would require 
colleges to notify 
police after sexual 
assault is reported

DISCUSSING WITH THE DINGE LLS

A

s I spent time studying abroad 
in the United Kingdom, I was 
overwhelmed — overwhelmed 

by 
unfamiliar 

experiences, novel 
places 
and 
the 

constant bombard-
ment of new infor-
mation. Yet, it was 
the extraordinary 
amount of natural 
beauty, in particu-
lar, that stunned 
me the most.

Even amongst all 

of the astonishing 
sights and dizzy-
ing novelty of the experience, I didn’t 
stray too far from my usual Upper 
Peninsula-inspired tendency of wan-
dering about. Just like the numerous 
times I disappear from my apartment 
to walk around the Arb, if friends and 
classmates from my study abroad pro-
gram couldn’t seem 
to find me eas-
ily, I was probably 
roaming about the 
forested walkways 
located next to the 
college.

Almost 
every 

day, 
under 
the 

cover of a sky per-
fectly 
tinted 
to 

match the hue of 
a robin’s egg, I 
ventured onto my 
favorite 
wooded 

path. Cascades of 
brilliantly gradated 
green leaves rus-
tled and wavered 
overhead, and with each subtle sway 
of the branches above, slivers of light 
gilded the contours of the trees and 
illuminated splotches of the muddy 
ground. To my left, the sometimes mint 
— sometimes darker — green waters 
of the Cherwell gently flowed past 
reflecting flickers of the purple flowers 
dotting the grass alongside the sloping 
riverbank. This was not the England I 
had expected. Nor was it the England I 
had been continuously warned to bring 
an extensive amount of heavy-duty 
rain gear to.

A similar path, albeit one that pos-

sesses less sentimental value for me, 
led me to a concerning realization. On 
a more stereotypically English (Welsh, 
if I really want to be specific) day, my 
classmates and I walked along a dirt 
path enclosed by a tunnel constructed 
by overarching branches, twigs and 
leaves. Eventually, the tunnel funneled 
us out to a verdant shoreline and an 
unending expanse of steel blue water 
of the bay blurred against a misty gray 
sky above. I stared out at the horizon, 
looking toward Cardiff in the distance.

My gazing and daydreaming were 

interrupted as one of our instruc-
tors began to describe the variety and 
amount of trash and debris that con-
tinually washed upon the shoreline 
directly below us. The conversation 
then shifted to the amount of trash 
floating in the ocean. Later, I’d look 
this fact up to find out that roughly 5.25 
trillion pieces of plastic are currently 
floating in our oceans. The lecture con-

tinued as I began 
to imagine flocks 
of plastic bottles, 
wrappers, 
plas-

tic bags and other 
random articles of 
trash bobbing up 
and down in the 
water beyond my 
line of sight. As 
the lecture shifted 
to rising sea lev-
els due to climate 
change, the scene 
in my head evolved 
to an overly exag-
gerated image of 
a dramatic swell 
of 
trash-infested 

water flooding the land.

Before this trip, I had been near the 

ocean only once before in my life. It was 
only after traveling all the way “across 
the pond” that I began to understand 
how polluted it is. While I’m certain 
I’ve learned and known about water 
pollution before, it’s a topic that rarely 
received any attention in my mind. This 
phenomenon is probably quite com-
mon in our society. Our society and our 
actions are the driving force behind a 
myriad of today’s environmental prob-
lems. In the particular case of marine 
pollution, 80 percent of the debris

Motor City Match works to 

establish a network of commu-
nication between city property 
owners 
and 
entrepreneurs 

looking for spaces to start 
their businesses. The program 
analyzes vacant buildings and 
properties 
throughout 
the 

city and matches the proper-
ties with interested business 
owners. Once a business and 
a property are paired, the 
program is able to provide 
roughly $500,000 in grants 
and other technical assistance 
to help with renovations or 
other initial startup costs. 
Twenty-seven vacant build-
ings throughout Detroit were 
recently selected to be paired 
with startup firms looking for 
spaces to establish themselves.

By introducing a myriad of 

new small businesses, start-
ups and other employment 
opportunities throughout var-
ious Detroit neighborhoods, 
Motor City Match will assist 
in alleviating the city’s stag-
gering rates of poverty and 

unemployment. In addition to 
the fact that the city only pos-
sesses 200 jobs for every 1,000 
people living there, the major-
ity of jobs are concentrated 
within a small segment of the 
city that many residents with-
out suitable modes of trans-
portation find very difficult to 
travel to. A high concentration 
of jobs can be found within 
the Midtown-downtown area, 
but employment opportunities 
are far scarcer in surround-
ing neighborhoods. In fact, 
the vast majority of Detroit 
citizens, roughly 80 percent, 
reside more than 10 miles from 
a central business district

Therefore, it’s crucial that 

the 
program 
maintains 
a 

focus on ensuring these new 
businesses are cultivated in 
neighborhoods and areas that 
severely 
lack 
employment, 

making them more accessible 
for residents.

Motor City Match presents 

a mutually beneficial collabo-
ration between entrepreneurs 

and the city. While business 
owners need the city’s avail-
able real estate, Detroit needs 
the resulting population and 
revenue influx. The program, 
in addition to poverty and 
unemployment, aids in tack-
ling the issue of blight removal 
by utilizing the city’s existing 
infrastructure to develop new 
businesses. Renovating vacant 
properties will improve the 
general appearance and atmo-
sphere of the city, making it 
more inviting to workers, resi-
dents, employers and tourists. 
The allocation of new employ-
ment opportunities through 
initiatives such as these will 
lead to the allocation of more 
young talent to fill newly creat-
ed positions. As a result, more 
and more housing structures 
that currently stand empty 
may find new tenants.

The program provides a via-

ble approach to improve both 
Detroit’s economic and physical 
environment, and possesses the 
capacity to initiate long-term

A

nnounced earlier this year in Detroit Mayor Duggan’s 
State of the City address, Motor City Match — a proposed 
entrepreneurial initiative — seeks to reconstruct and revitalize 

Detroit’s struggling economy. The program, managed by the Detroit 
Economic Growth Corp., strives to bolster small business activity by 
providing venues for new and existing businesses in the area. Although 
the program is still in its introductory phase, its acknowledgement of the 
multi-faceted nature of the city’s debilitating economic situation offers 
an approach that will not only aid the growth of Detroit businesses, but 
may also spur other necessary developments within the city.

progress. These 27 new potential busi-
nesses are certainly a step in the right 
direction. However, Motor City Match 
only offers an initial solution to a host of 
complex issues requiring remediation. 
Originally, 150 available properties 
applied to be included in the program, 
illustrating the need to expand the pro-

gram or start similar initiatives in the 
future. While Motor City Match pres-
ents an avenue for productive change, 
it also highlights the vast amount of 
work still needed to correct issues sur-
rounding transportation, poverty and 
job distribution, and to continue toward 
Detroit’s revitalization.

originates from land-based human 
activities. These actions lead to a 
slow accumulation of devastating 
consequences. As a result, we don’t 
immediately know the impact of 
our actions, and other issues take 
precedence in our lives.

However, as we continue to 

knowingly, or unknowingly, alter 
the environment, the damage done 
is never a singular issue. Water 
pollution is merely one concern. 
Research has shown that far more 
issues, such as acidification of the 
water, glacial melting and rising 
water temperatures as a result of 
climate change and subsequent dis-
ruption of marine ecosystems, all 
are lurking beneath the surface and 
could pose significant changes to 
the world as we know it now.

Climate change, as a whole, 

is a subject we’ve known about, 
have discussed, have debated ad 
nauseam and have still exhibited 
a dangerously delayed response 
to. President Barack Obama, in a 
recent attempt to shift the con-
versation, recently proposed plans 
for stricter regulations to reduce 

greenhouse gas emissions and 
bolster the use of solar, wind and 
other renewable energy sources. 
Although the administration of the 
Clean Power Plan could be offset by 
dissenting opinions, legal conflicts 
and the ideology of the next per-
son to assume charge of the White 
House, Obama’s actions, at the very 
least, will help secure a place for 
discussions about the environment 
in the endless stream of upcoming 
debates and campaign speeches.

Throughout 
my 
wander-

ings, I was a student and a tourist 
seeking to find the beauty of the 
country I had found myself lost in. 
Whether it is manmade or natu-
ral, we as humans seek to uncover 
these astonishing sights, but we 
sometimes all too easily forget how 
easily the stunning natural envi-
ronment can be tarnished. We, 
in order, to protect the numerous 
paths we wander upon, need to 
relinquish our roles as mere specta-

Things I wish I did this summer

H

ere’s a line you hear 

every year: I 
can’t believe 
how 
fast 

the summer 
has gone by. 
Seriously, 
though. 
It 

feels 
like 

yesterday 
I 

was 
wait-

ing for the 
Daily’s serv-
ers to operate at a reasonable 
rate (well actually, it was yes-
terday), and now it’s August, a 
mere three weeks away from 
the beginning of fall semester 
(read: Harbaugh era of Michi-
gan football).

So, as I sit here writing this 

at the Daily, cherishing my last 
moments as managing editor, 
it seems like a great time to 
reflect on what I did this sum-
mer, or actually, what I wish 
I did and did not do because 
that’s a lot more interesting. 
And maybe, just maybe, there 
will be something to learn from 
this thought exercise:

I 
wish 
I 
watched 
less 
 

Fox News.

No, this isn’t my big “I’m actu-

ally a Republican” announcement. 
Rather, back in May, I challenged 
myself to watch the network as 
my primary TV news source. 
Huge mistake. I mean, the things 
that come out of these people’s 
mouths are too terrible to be true 
— the highlight being Bill O’Reilly 
declaring 
institutional 
racism 

no longer exists (OK, Bill, OK). I 
would be shocked if there wasn’t 
a dartboard in the middle of their 
newsroom with President Barack 
Obama and former Secretary 
of State Hillary Clinton’s faces 
tacked in the center. My prob-
lem was watching Fox became 
somewhat of a pseudo-addiction, 
where I started counting on Bill 
Hemmer and Martha McCal-
lum to start my day off right 
 

— and angry.

By July, my viewing started to 

cool down a bit, but last Thurs-
day’s Republican debate brought 
me back in. I have never enjoyed 
ignorance so much. Seriously, 
could they have found a group 

of 10 people who are more out of 
touch with reality? Probably, but 
my point is made.

While there were many posi-

tives in this Fox News-viewing 
experience — becoming more 
confident in my beliefs, copious 
amounts of unintentional comedy, 
etc. — I wish it didn’t happen. I 
feel a bit less sane now.

I 
wish 
I 
checked 
my 
 

e-mail less.

Filling out medical school 

applications may be important, 
in that I don’t get to go to medi-
cal school without doing them, 
but side effects include compul-
sive e-mail checking to the point 
of insanity. Seeing “Updated 
Just Now” with no new e-mails 
is borderline torture. This whole 
process is really the ultimate test 
of how well I handle patience. 
 

Pun intended.

I wish I watched more 
 

documentaries.

I 
love 

learning 
about 
the 

more impor-
tant 
things 

in life: a leg-
endary sushi 
chef, the his-
tory of Chi-
nese 
food, 

scientology 
and 
tennis 

matches 
that 
never 

happened. Documentaries have 
unlocked a curious spirit in me to 
educate myself on just about any-
thing, even if it’s just to add some 
excitement to a conversation. For 
all I’ve watched this summer, I’m 
committed to watching more. The 
Amy Winehouse documentary is 
next on my list.

I 
wish 
I 
wrote 
and 
 

performed a stand-up comedy 
set.

Not that I think it would be any 

good, but this has been a goal of 
mine for a while. I like to believe 
I would have a small semblance 
of stage presence and maybe have 
gotten a couple of jokes to land, so 
I wish I gave it a try. Maybe some-
day, though. I’m trying to be the 
next Larry David here!

I wish I ran more
Not actually.
I wish I went camping

I’ve spent a lot of this summer 

on the computer and my phone. 
While camping out on Facebook 
scrolling endlessly down is fun, 
it simply can’t beat the great out-
doors. I know I’m not the only one 
who is obsessed with their tech-
nology, and it’s a real problem. 
Craving virtual social interaction 
is simply not healthy. I need to dis-
connect from that world for a bit. 
Plus, I miss the tents, the camp-
fires and the hikes. I’m craving 
real conversations while eating 
hot dogs with great friends.

***
When I look at this short 

list, I see some things serious, 
most things not so much. How-
ever, believe it or not, there is an 
important question that comes 
out of this: Am I living the life I 
want to live?

In most ways, yes. I’m pur-

suing a career in medicine and 
found a genuine passion for 

public health 
this summer. 
I am proud of 
the fact that 
I 
attempt 

to 
educate 

myself in a 
wide variety 
of topics.

But 
what 

about every-
thing 
in 

between? 
My time in 

Ann Arbor is winding down 
(less than a year left), and 
there are plenty of restaurants 
and stores I have yet to eat 
and shop at. I really do want 
to write that comedy routine, 
and I want to become less 
attached to my e-mail. I want 
to 
strengthen 
my 
relation-

ships with the people I care 
 

about most.

It’s time to start prioritizing 

those things because these are 
the experiences that will go a 
long way in living the life I want 
to live — one that’s not sucked 
away by staring at social media.

Luckily, I have the next cou-

ple weeks off, so I know where 
I can start.

Anyone want to go camping?

‘Gift,’ confused, yet smart

A well-intentioned 
directorial debut 

fascinates

By BENJAMIN ROSENSTOCK

Daily Arts Writer

Is it possible for a movie to be 

consistently smart, full of clever 
subversion, palpable atmosphere 
and 
fascinating 

ideas and yet not 
quite work just 
because of some 
structural 
and 

tonal confusion? 
In his directorial 
debut “The Gift,” 
Joel 
Edgerton 

(who also wrote 
and starred in the 
thriller “Felony”) 
has created a film 
that’s admirable in its unconven-
tionality but jarring in ways that 
negate its intelligent ideas.

Jason Bateman (“Bad Words”) 

and Rebecca Hall (“Transcen-
dence”) star as Simon and Robyn 
Callen, a married couple moving 
into their new home in California. 
One day, Simon runs into Gordo 
(Edgerton again), an old friend 
from high school, and over the 
course of the film’s first half, Gordo 
becomes clingy, showing up at 
Simon and Robyn’s house at unex-
pected times and leaving them 
an abundance of gifts they never 
asked for.

The premise of “The Gift” has 

been compared to those of thrill-
ers like “Fatal Attraction,” and the 
first half of the film proceeds in 
ways you’d expect, with Gordo’s 
behavior becoming increasingly 
creepy and threatening. There’s 
a foreboding atmosphere, with 
long shots of the Callens’ opulent 
house through windows suggest-
ing an unforeseen observer. Robyn 
becomes afraid that Gordo is a real 
threat, and jump scares tease the 
inevitable moment when Gordo’s 
wrath will finally be unleashed.

Then, right when the viewer is 

primed to expect the escalating 
conflict to crescendo into all-out 
madness, everything stops, Gordo 
disappears for a long stretch of 
screen time and Robyn spends a 
chunk of the movie looking into 
her husband’s past. It’s not much 
of a spoiler to say that Simon’s not 
exactly what he seems, because 

even from early scenes, Simon 
oozes superiority, mocking Gordo 
and calling him words like “dis-
gusting” even when his behavior 
is hopelessly needy at worst. He’s 
never an outright villain, though. 
There’s never a huge twist when 
Simon tries to kill his own wife. 
“The Gift” is a patient character 
study of Simon, showing how the 
return of Gordo allows Robyn 
to see that much like “Gordo the 
Weirdo,” Simon hasn’t changed at 
all since his days as a high school 
bully.

The problem is that the mashup 

of genres leaves the viewer con-
fused about what exactly we’re 
supposed to be watching. It’s okay 
to have a structure that surprises 
the viewer, but when you watch a 
movie you still want to have some 
indication of what the overall path 
you’re going to take is, and when 
the movie suddenly switches from 
a slow-burn thriller to a psycho-
logical drama about an asshole 
in denial, it feels like the movie 
is following up on a promise it 
never made in the first place. The 
108-minute running time is pretty 
tight narratively, but it feels over-
long just because it’s impossible to 
get a sense for what the endpoint is.

The odd thing is that none of this 

is uninteresting at all. The viewer 
is constantly thrown for loops 
as Robyn uncovers secrets from 
Simon’s past. Simon’s charismatic 
exterior is peeled away to reveal his 
true nature, and it’s pulled off fan-
tastically by Jason Bateman, who’s 
always had notes of darkness in his 
performances without ever becom-
ing this openly loathsome. The idea 

of a morally gray pair of opposing 
antagonists is a strong one, more 
complex than the typical knife-
wielding creep hunting down the 
married couple. Same goes for the 
idea of past transgressions coming 
back to haunt the characters like in 
a Shakespearean tragedy.

It’s just that all these theoreti-

cally captivating ideas are thrown 
in towards the end in a movie that 
never prepares its audience to 
grapple with them. It’s difficult to 
reconcile the manipulative jump 
scares of the stereotypical first 
half with the surprising nuance of 
the second half, or to reconcile the 
slow-paced atmospheric tension of 
the buildup with the belated grue-
some final twist that deflates a lot of 
the complexity the film has creat-
ed. It’s hard to justify the ominous 
score and long, tense takes with 
the simple revelation that Simon 
was a dick in high school. It’s not 
that larger-than-life melodrama 
and horror can’t be infused with 
subtle thematic value, as proven by 
much-praised movies like “It Fol-
lows” or “The Babadook.” It’s that 
“The Gift” seems to never decide 
whether to go for all-out insanity 
or understated character-building, 
and it doesn’t manage to juggle 
both in an organic and satisfying 
way.

In his directorial debut, Joel 

Edgerton has established himself 
as a writer-director to look out for 
in the future. He has some impres-
sive ideas and striking technical 
skills, from his synthesis of camera 
and sound to the naturalistic direc-
tion of his talented cast. “The Gift,” 
though, is a compelling misstep.

‘Difficult People’ 
in need of weight

My presence is a present, kiss my ass

By ALEX INTNER

Daily Arts Writer

It was alright.
For some shows, I wish that 

was all I really had to say about 
them. The prob-
lem with “Dif-
ficult 
People” 

isn’t 
neces-

sarily that it’s 
doing anything 
that 
deserves 

harsh criticism, 
but more that 
there’s nothing 
worthy of high 
praise 
either. 

The humor of the show has a bit of 
a bite, but it’s not enough to hurt. 
The characters are portrayed as 
terrible people, but aren’t horrible 
enough to be interesting. There are 
individual moments and jokes that 
shine, but after watching two half-
hours, it starts to cement itself as an 
average, middle-of-the-road show.

“Difficult People” follows the 

misadventures of two comedians, 
Julie (Julie Klausner, “Mulaney”) 
and Billy (Billy Eichner, “Billy on 
the Street”) in New York. During 
the first two episodes of the show, 
the characters curse in front of 
children at the theater, attempt a 
poorly-conceived threesome, run 
into some trouble while preparing 
for a callback and attempt hypnosis 
therapy. The ensemble is rounded 
out with Tony Award Winner 
Andrea Martin (Broadway’s “Pip-
pin”) in the role of Julie’s mother, 
James Urbaniak (“Review”) as 
Julie’s boyfriend, and Gabourey 
Sidibe (“Precious”) as the co-own-
er of the restaurant where Billy 
waits tables. 

Just read those names, that cast 

is really strong, and their natural 
talent provides a lot of what works 
about the show. Eichner has prov-
en with “Billy on the Street” that 

he’s a gifted comedian when asked 
to yell at people. His best moments 
are where he just sits back and lets 
loose with Klausner. In The open-
ing sequence of the series, where 
they attend a matinee of “Annie,” 
they are able to just let loose a 
stream of jokes which about the-
ater (particularly understudies at 
the theater) which are laugh-out-
loud funny. However, when they’re 
not on screen together, their bite 
doesn’t feel as sharp because the 
jokes just aren’t there to back up 
their natural abilities. Martin and 
Sidibe do the best with what they 
have (especially Martin with some 
great physical comedy in the sec-
ond episode), but Sidibe is saddled 
with a character who gets several 
different versions of one joke to tell 
and Martin doesn’t get much more.

The show’s biggest problem is 

something which the show proba-
bly thinks is its biggest benefit — its 
lack of structure. “Difficult People” 
doesn’t take the time to establish 
its world and only tenuously sets 
the character’s relationships to one 
another. While a lot of exposition 
can easily become clunky, it’s still 
necessary to give the viewer some-
thing about why the characters are 
connected. While the show does 
do a great job setting up the main 
characters’ friendship, it doesn’t do 
much with anyone else. I get that 
the show is going for a light, breezy 
tone, but the writer’s guiding touch 
is a little too soft here.

If the show finds a way to give 

the talented ensemble some stron-
ger material and actually adds 
some weight to the character’s 
relationships, it might actually be 
something that is worth spend-
ing time on, especially given the 
current glut of good television 
out there. Right now though, 
it’s an average show with strong 
leads and jokes which still need 
to catch up with their abilities.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com ARTS

By DANIEL SAFFRON

Daily Arts Writer 

This last weekend, Outside Lands 

2015 brought to Golden Gate Park a 
tequila flight of musical guests and a 
cultural experience to boot. With new 
artists like Ryn Weaver to the barrel-
aged and highly pedigreed añejo, 
Elton John, the chicly-embroidered, 
RFID-fashioned tourniquet-turned-
wristband provides patrons with an 
elaborate, three day musico-experi-
ential Choose Your Own Adventure.

Both a southern California native 

and an Outside Lands virgin, yr. cor-
resp. brought along to the festival the 
opinion that, while being of a slightly 
smaller scale than Coachella, Outside 
Lands digs an arm’s length deeper 
into the curatorial aspects of music 
festival construction. In this review, 
praise for standout performances 
is handed to artists, while praise for 
atmosphere creation and vibe direc-
tion, as brought to you by the week-
ends calendar, gets next-day aired to 
whichever Outside Lands organiza-
tion deserves credit. 

That being said, Outside Lands 

both affirmed and surpassed that 
which I’d opined. Each individual 
stage’s artist series was self-sup-
porting and the different stages’ 
concurrent acts commit seldom an 
injustice to either the performers or 
spectators. Each of the three largest 
stages maintained its unique semi-
consistent vibe: Twin Peaks (Ken-
drick, Axwell & Ingrosso, Amon 
Tobin, G Eazy) inspired dancing 
and sweat, Sutro (D’Angelo, Slightly 
Stoopid, Ben Harper & The Innocent 
Criminals), a host to diverse artists on 
fringes of popular sound and Lands 
End (Mumford, Black Keys, Sam 
Smith, Sir Elton Hercules) the pro-
vider of mass-appeal pop and rock as 
the festival’s mainstage.

One, Two … Skip A Few … 

Ninety-Nine, One Hundred: The 

Artists

Outside Lands is a high profile gig 

capable of drawing music’s most in-
demand artists. Like “water” bottles 
and firearms, the festival’s Big Love 
and Free Hugs atmosphere prefers 
performer’s ego checked at the door. 
Each artist and performance is a part 
of something larger. Those that capi-
talized on this aspect were met with 
the most success, whereas ignorance 
to the larger schema proved an unat-
tractive quality – Mr. Eazy, I will 
have my word with you later.

Glass Animal’s set exhibited 

each end of the spectrum. Placed 
in between George Ezra and Chet 
Faker, the band was to ease the tran-

sition from soft rock to soul-tinged 
electronica. The design of their 
setlist lubricated nice, but their mas-
turbatory stage presence disrupted 
the night’s flow. 

Disclaimer: As a solo reporter at 

the festival, I was unable to see all 
events. Judgements and reviews in 
the below sections are formed only 
on witnessed performances. 

The Best: The Cherry On Top
3. Kendrick Lamar
Caught in the midst of the To Pimp 

A Butterfly and its cultural gumption 
and innovation, I forgot that Kendrick 
can make a crowd move. At all times 
in sync with the audience, Kendrick 
extended several invitations for the 
audience to participate in hits from 
his last three albums. The power that 
Kendrick brings to the stage is infec-
tious and awe inspiring. 

The performance was stellar, 

albeit not that much better than 
expected, however it was in a 
single gesture that Kendrick earns 
spot number three. During the 
performance of “Alright,” the set’s 
haymaker, Kendrick announced, 
“this is the livest crowd,” and 
shortly after dedicated the perfor-
mance to an attendee in a wheel-
chair, who’d been hoisted up in the 
air. Reminded instantly of Kanye’s 
wheelchair 
incident, 
Kendrick 

time and time again sets himself 
apart from other big names in 
hip-hop, amassing an ever more 
respectable reputation. 

 2. Dan Deacon
Dan Deacon’s underdog perfor-

mance at Panhandle, by far the small-
est of the significant stages, perfectly 
captured the beautiful ridiculousness 
of music festivals that makes them 
so special. Ten minutes prior to his 
set, Deacon used red masking tape to 
cross out his name on the artist plac-
ard and replaced it with The Doors 
logo, an impressive feat of tape-work 
deserving of a chuckle. Deacon start-
ed his set, but not before telling us of 
his psilocybin-enhanced enjoyment 
of the festivities the day before and 
promising a dance party, informing 
insubordinates that “the guy that 
steals songs from Tom Petty” is play-
ing in the next stage over. Finally, 
the performer requested the audi-
ence members each raise a hand to 
the sky to “blow out [their] anxieties 
to the people going to other stages… 
[and to envision the face of a victim] 
killed by someone with the power of 
authority.” This impossibly charming 
and meaningful introduction set up a 
perfect mood.

His avant-garde music isn’t the 

easiest of listenings, but is fertile 

ground for wild dancing, which is 
exactly what the crowd did. Before 
his second song, Deacon directed the 
audience to form a circle in the field 
and announced a dance off; “Rule one 
is you have to dance sassy as fuck.” 
The small crowd grew appreciably 
during the dance-off. There wasn’t a 
face in the crowd without their pearly 
whites exposed nice and bright. 

The set was enlivening, the per-

former was enthusiastic and the act 
fit the festival’s contours better than 
latex – or nitrile for those allergic. 
While an act with not more than a 
couple hundred in the audience, Dan 
Deacon was the gem of the festival 
hidden in plain sight.

1. D’Angelo and the Vanguard
 D’Angelo breathes a different 

air than the rest of us mortals. The 
aura of The Vanguard’s bandleader 
transcends stardom, verging into 
territories of music mastery describ-
able only as messianic. The instant 
D’Angelo stepped on stage, the rest of 
the world slow fades out of existence, 
its paltry light snuffed out by group’s 
fluorescent aura, which pulls in the 
helpless like quicksand, each partici-
pant sinking deeper and deeper into 
an elated, honey-sweet intoxication. 

The Black Messiah is entrancing. 

The Sutro stage was the most packed 
I’d seen all festival, but the concert 
was nonetheless intimate. The audi-
ence sat deep down into the pocket of 
the groove, a place with cares unfet-
tered and of weightless existence. 
The idea of The Groove is so far lost 
today in music, we seldom even know 
it when we hear it. The embodi-
ment of The Groove’s instauration, 
the group is unafraid to let all fall by 
the wayside and just simply groove 
for the sake of The Groove, chewing 
on repeat signs like bubblegum and 
savoring the smoky, caramel har-
monies. Their set was without a dull 
moment, featuring songs off the new 
and old albums alike. The band tran-
sitioned beautifully from horn shouts 
at the climax of one song, turning 
on the drop of a half-dollar into the 
swelling intro of another as if yanked 
by aircraft cable. 

The performer is a force to be reck-

oned with and is likewise one with a 
message, dedicating his performance 
“The Charade” to “the victims of 
senseless police brutality.” What 
isn’t there to love about this man? 
D’Angelo’s inspiring performance 
Friday night set the tempo for the rest 
of the weekend, a tempo to which my 
foot still taps. 

Just Missed The List: Elton John, 

Mac Demarco, Misterwives, St. Paul 
and the Broken Bones

The Worst: Let’s Keep These 

Short 

3. Robert DeLong
Most of DeLong’s set was very 

enjoyable, but his act rode bare-
backed into the sunset of the most 
unsavory aspects of electronic music 
performance. Solo electronic art-
ists can only reproduce so much of 
their music live, and are forced to 
just-hit-the-play-button to cover the 
remaining aspects of a song. This is 
fine; if Beethoven didn’t play every 
instrument in the orchestra, I think 
we can cut Robert DeLong a break 
if he doesn’t manually control every 
moving fader automation. What one 
should not do is feign complete con-
trol, or even worse, rig technicolored 
video game controllers to “control” 
aspects of a song that are unlikely 
controllable by such a prop – I suspect 
foul play. And even if the controllers 
were doing as their name suggests, 
there are better tools for the job, 
namely instruments, for which a prop 
is no substitute lest the music suffer. 
Duping the audience to look good is a 
big no-no in my book. 

Thou shalt not fool me once.
2. DJ Mustard
All the respect in the world 

should be paid to DJ Mustard, a 
very accomplished and reputable 
producer. That being said, DJ Mus-
tard’s set sounded as though he lit-
erally just-hit-the-play-button, then 
sometimes adjusted the volume. 
The tracks were of a Bar Mitzvah 
vintage and the act was slightly 
embarrassing, even playing behind 
you as you walk to another stage. 

Thou shalt renew thy Spotify 

Premium.

1. G Eazy
Gerald Earl Gillium was blessed 

this last weekend with the once in a 
lifetime opportunity to open for Ken-
drick Lamar, a rapper to go down as 
an all time great. While opinions 
of G Eazy tend to be very polar, his 
act is a very fitting opener for the 
stage’s headliner. The set did as it was 
intended to do, it got people moving, 
singing and excited. 

Towards the end of the set, G Eazy 

pulled the ol’ throw money into the 
audience trick: an MTV staple. The 
display of profligacy has never been 
particularly cool, but it takes on a 
new level of degeneracy when done 
to open for the creator of To Pimp 
A Butterfly – an album about Kend-
rick’s survivor’s guilt which contains 
a song that wrestles with “How Much 
A Dollar Cost.” 

Tasteless, G Eazy. 
Thou shalt sit your bitch ass down 

and listen to this true mother fuckin’ 

story told by Kendrick Lamar on 
Rosecran.

Things Tasty and Aesthetic: 

The Culture

“Half the reason I come to the fes-

tival is for the food,” a friend tells me. 
The “Taste of the Bay Area,” brings 
in local restaurants to serve at the 
festival and proves to be a highly 
successful venture. While at first 
dubious over the quality of ahi tuna 
poke served in a dusty park, I relent-
ed under the “The ocean is right 
there” argument, accompanied by a 
point and a raised fork. One taste of 
a friend’s and then began the Poke-
Man and my sensuous relationship. 
Long lines and tall prices are just 
what one comes to expect at an event 
with no ins and outs, but the quality 
of the food makes the price a lot easier 
to get down and, in many instances, 
worth every penny. 

Outside Lands takes food and 

drink very seriously. While the whole 
event is bespeckled with the “Taste of 
the Bay Area,” there also exist hubs 
of more focused comestible assort-
ments bearing templated names: 
Beer Lands, Wine Lands, Cheese 
Lands, Choco Lands and, the mold 
breaker, GastroMagic – the last-men-
tioned being “the home for innova-
tion around what is possible in food, 
drink, music, magic and more.” 

Outside Lands Music and Arts 

Festival, as it promises, brings not just 
music but is a host to the other forms 
of the arts. Put up around the festi-
val is “Outsider Art,” the product of 
a partnership with Jeben Berg from 
Juxtapoz magazine which brought 
art and various art events like live-
painting to add aesthetic garnish.

Outside Lands: The Experience
Maybe it’s the neon-light soaked 

Monterey Pines or the large inflat-
able eyes with a point of espial just 
above the towering tree tops. Maybe 
it’s the sweet smell in the air, some 
admixture of stale sweat, D’Angelo’s 
exhalations and whatever it is the 
mustachioed dad to my starboard is 
smoking a lot of. Maybe it’s San Fran-
cisco, or summer, the sequence on 
Elton John’s blazer or even the dehy-
dration talking, but there’s just some-
thing about Outside Lands that seems 
unbounded by real life. The festival is 
not a place of complete relaxation nor

Building reopens after 
two-year, $55 million 

project

By MAYA SHANKAR

Daily Staff Reporter

After a $55 million renova-

tion, the University of Michigan’s 
Taubman Health Sciences Library 
reopened its doors on August 3rd. 
The renovations took over two 
years, and were aimed at updating 
the 35-year old building and creat-
ing an environment that fostered 
collaborative learning for health 
professional students.

“It is a total renovation of the 

library to reflect the way learning 
currently occurs” said Dr. James 
Woolliscroft, dean of the University 
of Michigan Medical School, Lyle C 
Roll professor of medicine. “Years 
ago, the library was the repository 
of accumulated knowledge. Now, 
with so much information digitized 
and readily available, it was time we 
looked at the space to reconfigure it 
to support current learning modali-
ties.”

Many books were moved out of 

the library, with most of the Uni-
versity’s print health sciences col-
lection now primarily residing off 
campus. 
University 
community 

members can request printed mate-
rial from the off-campus location, 
and visit the historical collection at 
Hatcher Graduate Library.

TMP Architecture and Ball-

inger Architecture and Engineer-
ing designed the project, and it was 
constructed by the Christman Com-
pany with many Michigan-based 
subcontractors and suppliers.

Workgroups planned the health 

science library remodeling in a 
way that would allow students to 
foster skills such as active small 
group learning, digital learning and 
clinical skills, while making sure to 
allow for student relaxation.

“We did a dramatic rearchitec-

turing of the space to create a space 
designed to support how students 
learn in the 21st century” said Dr. 
Rajesh Mangrulkar, associate dean

“That’s far worse than not hav-

ing a deal. And this deal is beyond 
bad.”

An Iran deal negotiated under 

a “President Trump”, he added to 
cheers, would have included return 
of four Americans who have been 
identified by the U.S. State Depart-
ment as being held in the country 
against their will. The current deal 
doesn’t mention the four.

Moving closer to Michigan, he 

also discussed the construction of 
a $2.5 billion Ford plant in Mexico, 
which he criticized as negative for 
American businesses.

“Ford is building a $2.5 bil-

lion car factory in Mexico,” he 
told reporters before the speech. 
“I went to the Wharton School of 
Finance. How does that help us?”

Speaking to the crowd, he con-

tinued the criticism, drawing some 
of the loudest applause of the eve-
ning.

“We don’t have to be business 

geniuses to figure well, they’re 
building a plant, it’s a massive 
plant, one of the biggest in the 
world,” he said. “And I actually 
gave them a good idea. Why don’t 
we just let the illegals drive the 
cars and trucks right through the 
border?”

Trump provided few policy 

details for most of the issues he 
mentioned— a common criticism 
of his campaign —but told report-
ers before the speech that he 
would roll out “numbers and spe-
cifics” within the next two weeks.

In response to multiple media 

questions about providing more 
details on policy, he cited several 
previous business deals where he 
said he’d succeeded by not going in 
with a fully defined plan.

“I think you’re going to see lots 

of plans…and you have to under-
stand, when you’re coming up with 
a plan, in business, you’ve got to 
be flexible,” he said. “You’ve got to 
have flexibility.”

For attendees who left satisfied 

with the speech, though, Trump’s 
appeal seemed to lie more in other 
aspects.

Christian Lee, a Canton resi-

dent, said he liked Trump not nec-
essarily because of a specific policy 
platform, but more because of how 
he approached politics and policy 
overall.

“I’ve always enjoyed his take on 

politics, and saying it straight and 
not trying to be politically cor-
rect,” Lee said.

Nancy Hyd-Davis, who volun-

teered at the event, echoed the 
appreciation of Trump’s presence.

“I like him more now than I did 

coming into it,” she said after the 
speech. “I think we’re too politi-
cally correct, and I think we need 
somebody with a strong personal-
ity.”

Keith Herzog, a Linden resident, 

and Donald Crawford of San Fran-
cisco, described a similar appeal.

“(A) voice of power, instead of 

laying down — the passion and 
confidence, I wanted to see it in 
person,” Crawford said.

“Everybody says he’s overly 

arrogant,” Herzog added. “But at 
the same time, I think he’s not, 
after listening to him in person, 
because they only put one side 
to him…he’s not as arrogant, he 
thinks through his ideas.”

When 
asked 
whether 
they 

thought Trump’s message would 
resonate in Michigan, which typi-
cally has swung Democratic in 
presidential elections but leaned 
Republican in the past few mid-
term elections, responses were 
mixed.

Citing Trump’s criticism of 

Ford’s plant in Mexico, Herzog 
said the issue would help him in 
the state.

“He wants it be here, he says 

— that alone will make Michigan 
vote for him 100 percent,” Herzog 
said.

“I think he could attract more 

people because he’s different,” 
Lee said. “I don’t know if he could 
make Michigan go Republican, but 
I think he has a better shot than 
Jeb Bush or someone who’s more 
mainstream.”

Outside the venue earlier in 

the day, the roughly 70 Demo-
cratic activists gathered to pro-
test Trump had a slightly different 
view.

Bobbie Walton, head of the 

advocacy group Citizens Against 
Government Overreach, said she 
didn’t necessarily see a big chance 
for Trump in Michigan, but that 
his influence on election as a whole 
could matter.

“There will be some (votes for 

Trump),” she said. “But he’s set-
ting the standard, and he’s starting 
the conversation, and we need to 
change the conversation.”

Another protester, David Roof, a 

Grand Blanc resident, had harsher 
words for the candidate and the 
crowd.

“It’s the attraction of people 

driving down a road and looking at 
road-kill,” he said.

Social Security, one quarter 

of elderly Americans would fall 
below the poverty line, but with 
Social Security this proportion has 
been reduced to 10 percent. Simi-
larly, before Medicare was enact-
ed, about half of elderly Americans 
had no form of health insurance 
but now coverage is nearly univer-
sal for senior citizens who often 
have significant health needs.”

The discussion largely focused 

on the future direction of Medi-
care and Social Security in light 
of the fact that the main popula-
tion it serves — older Americans 
— is expected to double within the 
next 40 years, making the program 

more costly.

“America cannot afford not to 

have Social Security,” U.S Rep. 
Debbie Dingell said. “Social Secu-
rity is the bedrock of our nation’s 
safety net and the first step in 
secure retirement that our seniors 
have earned and count on.”

University professors at the 

roundtable also stressed that qual-
ity, rather than cost, should be the 
primary objective in determining 
future health care policy.

“It’s the cost of healthcare 

that’s being discussed much more 
so than the quality” said Internal 
Medicine Prof. Mark Fendrick. 
“I did not go to medical school to 
learn how to save people money. 
I really do believe whether it be 
in state capitols or boardrooms or 
in the hallowed halls of U.S Con-

gress, there’s way too much atten-
tion being spent on how it’s being 
spent as opposed to how well we’re 
spending it.”

In an interview after the event, 

Debbie Dingell said while people 
might not think about issues like 
long-term care or retirement when 
they’re young, it’s relevant to 
younger generations too because 
of their opportunity to be proac-
tive.

“You don’t think about it when 

you’re young, but that’s the time 
when you should invest in long 
term care because it’s not expen-
sive at that point” Dingell said. 
“Young people need to think about 
retirement, not only in terms of 
starting to save… but they also 
need to think about these kinds of 
issues because they want to have a

for medical student education.

The timing of the renovations 

coincides with the newly imple-
mented medical school curricu-
lum. Dr. Mangrulkar spoke about 
how the new curriculum will 
focus on creating students who 
are able to think scientifically 
and 
communicate 
effectively, 

working as leaders to problem 
solve. “The library really ties 
into these elements” said Dr. 
Mangrulkar.

The building contains many 

classrooms and meeting rooms, 
lounges, 
a 
simulated 
clinic 

and new educational technol-
ogy. There are small group class-
rooms that allow collaboration 
and facilitate discussion with 
erasable walls and tables that 

students can write on. Wellness 
and meditation rooms, lounges 
and a café allow students to 
socialize, and numerous work-
stations provide access to print-
ed and digitized material.

In addition to the classrooms 

and lounges, the library has 
a clinical skills area. This is a 
simulated clinic with 30 real-
istic patient care rooms, where 
students are able to learn and 
practice their fundamental clini-
cal skills. The rooms are set up to 
resemble a real clinic, with medi-
cal technology and facilities for 
medical students to learn hands-
on 
skills. 
Cameras 
through-

out the rooms allow faculty to 
review and provide feedback to 
the students. The library also 
contains new technology, such as 
the Anatomage table, one of the 
most technologically advanced 
anatomy visualization systems 
for anatomy education. The table 

allows students to observe and 
interact with human anatomy in 
three-dimensions.

The Taubman Health Sci-

ences Library, while open to 
the University community, will 
primarily serve as a central hub 
for University of Michigan’s 780 
medical students, acting as the 
main space for M-Home, a new 
learning community within the 
med school. In addition, it pro-
vides space for the University’s 
1,000+ graduate and postdoctor-
al fellows in the sciences. Univer-
sity students studying medicine, 
public health, dentistry, social 
work, nursing, pharmacy and 
kinesiology will all be able to uti-
lize the learning spaces within 
the library, facilitating interpro-
fessional teamwork.

“The new library supports a 

whole new way of interacting 
with our students, facilitating 
their learning and development”

Former ‘M’ star Jordan Morgan 
gives back to hometown Detroit

After starting foun-
dation earlier in the 

summer, Morgan 

cleans up ‘D’

By CHRIS CROWDER

Daily Sports Writer

DETROIT — Jordan Morgan 

emerged from the back of a house 
on the 4800 block of Courville 
Street, spectacled with safety 
goggles and hands covered with 
yard work gloves. His shirt was 
already dirty from an hour of 
work clearing out a backyard 
overgrown with tree branches 
and vine, but his demeanor was 
upbeat.

Just like in his playing days, 

the former Michigan basketball 
standout center Morgan suited 
up ready to get to work. He led 
and others graciously followed 
his example. The teamwork that 
Morgan believes is so invaluable 
improved this block in Detroit by 
way of clearing and boarding up 
two abandoned houses and their 
yards while removing debris from 
the surrounding areas last Satur-
day afternoon.

“It’s a great opportunity for 

people to come out and meet 
other people that are still deeply 
invested in the city and the wel-
fare of the city and the neighbor-
hoods,” Morgan said. “Probably 

half of our volunteers came from 
the Jordan Morgan Foundation 
and the (Ann Arbor-based Merit) 
Fate program, and the other half 
are families and neighbors and 
people that live here and want to 
be a part of it.

“They want to see the neigh-

borhood look better because they 
grew up here or they’ve lived here 
their whole life.”

Throughout 
the 
day, 
peo-

ple 
from 
the 

neighborhood, 
especially teen-
agers, 
came 

to support the 
effort. 
Neigh-

bors 
continu-

ally approached 
Morgan, asking 
if 
they 
could 

work. He quick-
ly invited them 
to put on a pair 
of gloves, grab 
a Jordan Morgan Foundation 
T-shirt from his car, and assist 
wherever help was needed.

Detroit District Four Manag-

er O’Dell Tate especially appre-
ciated the help. At first, Tate 
looked upon the community 
members working together from 
his car with an appreciative 
smile. Later, he got closer to the 
action: talking with the volun-
teers, learning about the clean-
up efforts he works to provide 
the city with.

“For one, (community clean-

ups) boosts the morale of the 
residents in the community, and 
allow them to bring back the pride 
and the hope again in restor-
ing their community,” Tate said. 
“These young people coming out 
as volunteers are making a major 
dent in some of the blight in terms 
of cleaning up abandoned houses 
and cutting down the shrubbery 
and weeds. And boarding (the 
houses) up makes them safe and 

secure.

“This allows 

the 
neighbor-

hood 
to 
take 

a step in the 
right direction 
to securing its 
home stock so 
that we can get 
potential 
new 

families 
back 

into these hous-
es and renovate 
them.”

The combined effort of the 

Jordan 
Morgan 
Foundation, 

the Fate Program, Morningside 
Neighborhood Association and 
students from the Jalen Rose 
Leadership Academy put the 
two houses well on their way to 
becoming homes again. Families 
may not inhabit the buildings any 
time soon, but the neighborhood 
was made safer in the instant the 
last board was put over the final 
window frame.

Sixteen children live on the 

block, and the volunteers not 

only made the street a safer 
place for the kids, but for every-
one who calls Courville Street 
home. Morgan cited issues like 
squatting and various criminal 
activities as examples of what 
can go wrong 
with 
leaving 

an 
abandoned 

house 
wide 

open. The yards 
of these houses, 
which can be 
unkempt 
and 

crowded 
with 

shrubbery and 
branches, 
can 

also become an 
eye sore to the 
neighbors near-
by enjoying their backyards.

“Every house that we can save 

and rehab to restore and preserve, 
that’s the goal to get families back 
into these houses — to make it a 
very strong and solid communi-
ty,” Tate said.

Morgan’s passion for volun-

teering has grown over the years. 
Even when playing basketball 
for Michigan and professionally 
all over the world, he has always 
held his hometown of Detroit in a 
special place in his heart, feeling 
a kind of obligation to give back to 
the city that raised him.

“I know that it’s not on my own 

that I got where I am,” Morgan 
said. “It’s through my hard work, 
but also from so much help from 
others, that I’ve gotten to the 
point where I’m at now. That’s 
why it’s important to me, because 
you can have a lasting impact on 
peoples’ 
lives 

just 
by 
the 

interactions you 
have with them.

“That was the 

whole 
purpose 

of starting the 
foundation, 
to 

have an impact 
on peoples’ lives 
in the city of Detroit, to impact the 
youth in Detroit and to be a good 
model and influence on youth.”

Morgan’s foundation’s mission 

states, “My hope is that through 
this foundation, myself and oth-
ers will provide education, sup-
port 
and 
encouragement 
to 

today’s youth so that each child 
has the opportunity to overcome 
any circumstance.” And even 
through just one event, one day, 
five hours, that belief and decla-
ration is evident. Morgan wants 
to be a resource to his commu-
nity, whether he is in Detroit 
or playing basketball overseas. 
Especially in Michigan’s largest 

city, he wants to be a resource to 
help others achieve as much as 
possible.

The impact Morgan wants 

to make is one that lasts, one 
that sticks. He doesn’t want his 

passion 
and 

influence 
to 

wither 
away. 

As those who 
have 
helped 

him become the 
man he is today 
through 
sup-

port, he wants 
to display his 
appreciation by 
paying it for-
ward.

For 
those 

who want to make an impact in 
their respective communities, he 
lends simple, but effective advice: 
“Just do it.”

“I didn’t have a plan,” Morgan 

said. “For a lot of this stuff that 
was done, it was like, ‘Just do 
it.’ With the foundation, we just 
jumped in and said, ‘We’re gonna 
do it,’ and we got a tremendous 
amount of support from so many 
people … If you go out with the 
right intentions, and set out to 
just do something, there are so 
many good people in this world 
that can help you achieve that 
if you just seek out the help to 
accomplish something good.”

Detroit and many other cities 

in the United States need people 
like Morgan and their founda-
tions to step up and get their 
hands dirty. So many can benefit 
from the acts of a few. Sometimes 

the work may 
seem small and 
insignificant, 
but 
citizens 

appreciate self-
less attempts to 
volunteer 
and 

serve.

Tate, 
who, 

among his other 

responsibilities, 
starts 
“block 

clubs” in Detroit neighborhoods, 
is especially grateful. The block 
clubs allow the blocks to be self-
sufficient and have their own way 
of 
self-governance. 
Saturday’s 

volunteer work was a step in the 
right direction to provide a firm 
foundation for the street.

“We’re very thankful today 

to have Jordan Morgan and his 
foundation and his volunteers 
that come out and be part of this 
great effort,” Tate said. “That’s 
what it takes. It takes a whole 
community to come together, to 
work together to stabilize the 
community.”

“They want 
to see the 

neighborhood 
look better.”

I know it’s not 
on my own that 
I got to where I 

am.”

“It takes a whole 

community to 
come together.”

Fisch, Harbaugh eyeing 
‘open’ QB competition

By JAKE LOURIM 

Managing Sports Editor

Junior 
Shane 
Morris 
led 

the 
Michigan 
football 
team’s 

starting quarterback competition 
after spring practice. But the 
Wolverines 
wanted 
an 
open 

competition, so they continued it 
all summer.

That still wasn’t contested 

enough, so they added graduate 
transfer Jake Rudock from Iowa 
to the fold.

And that still 

wasn’t contested 
enough, so the 
coaches 
insist 

each 
of 
the 

eight 
eligible 

quarterbacks on 
the roster has 
the opportunity 
to win the job during fall camp.

With three weeks until the 

season opener at Utah, they’re in 
no hurry to whittle it down.

“When it happens, it’ll happen, 

and it’ll be clear to Coach 
(Jim) Harbaugh and (offensive 
coordinator Tim Drevno) and 
myself, and the whole staff,” said 
passing game coordinator Jedd 
Fisch. “You really want it to be 
clear to everybody. You want 
the right guard to see it. You 
want the head coach to see it. 
You want everybody to feel that 
we’re now anointing that starting 
quarterback and everybody feels 
great about it.”

That competition is just getting 

started, 
because 
the 
coaches 

hadn’t 
seen 
Rudock 
practice 

before fall camp opened Friday 
and hadn’t seen Morris since the 
spring game.

Besides Rudock and Morris, 

there 
are 
four 
scholarship 

quarterbacks — though Houston 
transfer John O’Korn is ineligible 
due to NCAA transfer rules — and 
three walk-ons practicing.

In that group, experience is 

limited. Rudock started 12 games 
for Iowa last year and threw for 

2,436 yards, 16 
touchdowns 
and 
five 

interceptions. 
Among 
the 

other 
eligible 

quarterbacks, 
only 
Morris 

has seen game 

action. In his Michigan career, 
he is 43-for-87 for 389 yards, no 
touchdowns and five picks.

“Shane won the spring, I guess 

you could say, and now we’re past 
the spring,” Fisch said. “So we’ve 
kind of put that behind us. Now 
it’s a brand-new open competition 
again for the fall. Guys are healthy, 
guys are back, guys are in.”

Each 
quarterback 
has 
an 

advantage over the others: Rudock 
with his experience, Morris with 
his strong arm.

“I always try to figure out 

that percentage and how much 
of it will be a factor,” Harbaugh 
said. “Everything is a factor 
when it comes to the quarterback 

position. It’s like 
determining what’s 
more 
important 

to 
a 
carpenter. 

Is the saw more 
important, or the 
hammer, 
or 
the 

slide rule? I don’t 
know, they’re all 
important.”

After 
enrolling 

early last winter, 
freshman 
Alex 

Malzone 
started 

opposite Morris in 
the spring game. He 
went 15-for-27 for 
95 yards and two 
interceptions.

The 
other 

freshman is Zach 
Gentry, a 6-foot-
7, 
230-pound 

four-star 
recruit 

Harbaugh 
flipped 

from Texas soon 
after being hired. 
Gentry, 
however, 

does not have the 
extra spring camp 

of 
experience 
that 
Malzone 

does, so he’ll have to pick up the 
playbook quickly this fall.

Sophomore 
Wilton 
Speight 

is also back, but he did not see 
game action last fall and played 
sparingly in the spring game. 
Senior 
Brian 
Cleary, 
junior 

Garrett Moores and sophomore 
Matt Thompson are the walk-ons.

“All of our quarterbacks except 

for John O’Korn, they’ve got the 
license and the ability to compete 
and earn their position, whether 
it’s starter, backup, contributor, 
scout team, etc.,” Harbaugh said. 
“That’s what we’re here for. That’s 
what we’re going to find out.”

In Fisch’s 15 years of coaching, 

between college and pro football, 
his 
quarterback 
competitions 

have run the gamut.

Most recently, he was the 

offensive coordinator for the 
NFL’s 
Jacksonville 
Jaguars 

last season. The team had a 
competition 
between 
veteran 

Chad Henne and rookie Blake 
Bortles and gave Henne all the 
reps with the first team in training 
camp. But Bortles was playing by 
Week 3, starting by Week 4 and 
started every game the rest of the 
season.

For that reason, Fisch said he 

wants to divide reps among all 
quarterbacks.

In 1999 and 2000, Fisch 

was a graduate assistant for 
Steve Spurrier’s Florida team. 
He recalled Spurrier rotating 
quarterbacks “every play” — in 

reality, Jesse Palmer threw 223 
passes, Rex Grossman 212.

“But I don’t expect us to do that,” 

Fisch said with a smile.

Outside of those memories, the 

coaching staff revealed little about 
its plans for the 
position.

What we do 

know 
is 
that 

the Wolverines 
will shoot for a 
play distribution 
of 
50 
percent 

pass, 50 percent 
rush. Of course, 
that 
balance 

could tip if one 
is more proficient than the other, 
and Michigan could also run more 
when ahead in the fourth quarter 
or pass more when behind.

Expect the Wolverines to run 

a pro-style offense befitting of a 
coaching staff with four former pro 
coaches on offense, plus Harbaugh.

“I think we’re pro style, which 

means what you see on Sunday, 
which means all of it,” Fisch said. 
That includes, he said, the high-

speed offense of the Philadelphia 
Eagles, the no-huddle philosophy 
of the Jacksonville Jaguars or the 
run-first strategy of Harbaugh’s 
San Francisco 49ers.

Whatever it means, it needs 

a 
smart 

quarterback 
to manage the 
game.

“We 
talk 

about 
that 
all 

the 
time, 
the 

difference 
between 
being 

aggressive 
and 

reckless with the 
ball,” Fisch said. 

“We don’t want reckless. We want 
aggressive. We don’t want you to 
feel like you have to check it down 
every time. We don’t want to feel 
like, ‘What’s going to happen next?’ 
That’s not the mentality.

“The mentality is, ‘Go out there 

and sling it, but be smart. Don’t 
take an unnecessary chance. You 
never go broke taking a profit. 
You never go broke giving the ball 
to the easy completion’ ”

Junior Shane Morris was the starting quarterback after the Spring Game, but the job is still open.

“Everything is 
a factor when 

it comes to 

quarterback.”

“Go out there 
and sling it.”
