THE FINAL NOTE

State receives poor 
marks for college 
affordability in 

nonprofit’s report

By JACK TURMAN

Daily Staff Reporter

In a series of report cards 

published earlier this week by 
youth advocacy group Young 
Invincibles, the state of Michi-
gan’s investment in higher educa-
tion ranked as one of the lowest 
nationwide.

The report cards ranked Mich-

igan as the third worst state in 
the country based on five metrics 
— tuition, state appropriations 
average, average burden on fami-
lies, financial aid for students and 
higher education as a priority in 
the state government.

Michigan was one of 31 states 

to receive an “F” in appropria-
tions for higher education fund-
ing. It also numbered among 47 
states that spend less per student 
today than they did before the 
recession in 2008.

In an interview Thursday, Tom 

Allison, policy and research man-
ager at Young Invincibles, provid-
ed several reasons for Michigan’s 
ranking. He cited the fact that the 

state has cut its state appropria-
tions per student by 27 percent 
over the past few years, which is 7 
percent higher than the national 
average at 20 percent.

Republican 
Governor 
Rick 

Snyder’s 
administration 
cut 

higher education funding by 15 
percent in 2011, his first year in 
office. After the decrease his 
administration has incremen-
tally increased higher education 
funding by 3.1 percent in 2012, 2.2 
percent in 2013 and 6.1 percent in 
2014.

Snyder’s office did not return 

requests for comment on the 
ranking Thursday.

Allison added that the state 

awards fewer dollars than the 
national average, which is over 
$6,000 per student. Michigan 
allocates about $4,500 per stu-
dent.

In an interview Thursday, 

Donald Heller, dean of the College 
of Education at Michigan State 
University, noted a few factors as 
possible reasons for why the state 
ranked poorly on the report card. 
He cited the two major recessions 
of 2002 and 2008 in the state as 
possible influences.

“The cut in state funding 

which has caused the universi-
ties to raise tuition very rapidly,” 
Heller said. ” The relatively high

Larry Collins to 
be sworn in Friday 

after year-long 
search process

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

There’s a new chief in town.
After 
a 
year-long 
search, 

Monday marked the first day for 

Larry Collins, Ann Arbor’s new 
fire chief. He will be officially 
sworn in at a ceremony on Fri-
day.

Collins succeeds former Chief 

Chuck Hubbard, who retired in 
January of 2014 after serving as 
chief since 2011. Prior to that, 
Hubbard had been a firefighter 
in Ann Arbor for almost three 
decades. Ann Arbor Police Chief 
John Seto has overseen the fire 
department for the past year. 
Collins’ starting salary is set 

at $122,000 a year, an increase 
from the $104,549 he received at 
Brevard County Fire Rescue, his 
previous job.

Collins has experience serving 

at two other fire departments. 
He spent 30 years with the Day-
ton Fire Department in Ohio, 
retiring as its director and fire 
chief in 2008. Collins was also 
fire chief of the Brevard County 
Fire Rescue in Florida from 2009 
until he departed in September.

Florida 
Today 
reported 

his leave, noting differences 
between Collins and his superior 
regarding how the fire depart-
ment should operate.

“You can use the term fired, 

but really what it was an amica-
ble separation on the part of both 
parties,” Collins said in an inter-
view with The Michigan Daily.

Collins said that he had been 

hired under a progressive man-
ager in Brevard, and the assistant 
manager who succeeded him 

MOOCs taught by 
University profs. 
have reached 1.5 
million students

By CARLY NOAH

Daily Staff Reporter

Three years ago, the University 

was one of four founding partners 
of Coursera, a digital platform 
that hosts Massive Open Online 
Courses, or MOOCs, which allow 
individuals from across the world 
to take academic courses online.

Though a relatively new idea in 

higher education at the time, now 
15 University professors teach 
courses on the platform and have 
reached a collective 1.5 million 
students worldwide, according 
to the University’s department 
of Digital Education and Innova-
tion.

For University students and 

faculty, MOOCs have been a key 
example of digital education’s 
growth and change both on cam-
pus and beyond — one that’s been 
met with both enthusiasm and 
caution.

University Prof. Scott Page, 

who teaches complex systems, 
political science and econom-
ics, taught the University’s first 
MOOC, Model Thinking.

“At the time, no one knew what 

would happen — how many peo-
ple would take the course, how 
much work it would be… (I) did 
it because I thought it would be a 
learning experience and because 
I believe in the material I’m 
teaching,” Page said. “(The Uni-
versity) wanted a social science 
course that was easy to decom-
pose into models that did not rely 
on much copyrighted material.”

Page said he thought the ben-

efits of online courses were vast 
and could be altered to fit a wide 
range of students.

“The benefits everyone men-

tions are retrievability and scale,” 
Page said. “Once it’s taped, you 
can access the course anytime 
and anywhere. And you can have 
hundreds of thousands of stu-
dents — I’m nearing three-quar-
ters of a million.”

Page 
added 
that 
MOOCs 

helped improved his own skills as 
an educator.

“I found that there was an 

enormous benefit from going 
through the process of construct-
ing the lectures,” Page said. “I 
became a better teacher and 
thinker. Also, it’s really a thrill 
to interact with people globally, 
even if only electronically.”

While many professors and 

individuals in the higher educa-
tion community like Page have 
responded to MOOCs with enthu-
siasm, research also shows that

ACT loses contract 
for standardized 
testing in Michigan 

high schools

By GENEVIEVE HUMMER

Daily Staff Reporter

The state of Michigan will 

no longer require high school 
juniors take the ACT. Begin-
ning in spring of 2016, the 
SAT is the state’s new exam of 
choice.

On Wednesday, the Michi-

gan Department of Education 
and Department of Technol-
ogy, Management and Budget 
jointly announced that all stu-
dents attending high school in 
Michigan take the SAT in place 
of the ACT.

The state requires that a col-

lege entrance exam and a job 
skills test, which evaluates stu-
dents’ possible career oppor-
tunities, are provided free of 
charge to all high school stu-
dents.

These tests are competitively 

bid every few years and ranked 
by a joint evaluation commit-
tee made up of the MDE, the 

DTMB, a high school principal, 
a local school superintendent, 
a testing and assessment con-
sultant from an intermediate 
school district and the vice 
president from a Michigan 
community college.

The College Board, which 

administers the SAT, won the 
three-year contract with a $17.1 
million bid, $15.4 million less 
than the next bidder, the ACT, 
and was rated higher by a ten-
point margin.

The shift to the SAT will be 

an adjustment for high school 
students, teachers and admin-

36-year-old served 
three seasons as 

Harbaugh assistant 
while at Stanford

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

Michigan football coach Jim 

Harbaugh made his first coaching 
staff hire official Thursday morn-
ing when he named D.J. Durkin 
Michigan’s defensive coordinator 
and linebackers coach.

“D.J. is one of the top young 

defensive coordinators in foot-
ball, and I look forward to having 
him work with our student-ath-
letes,” Harbaugh said in a state-
ment.

Durkin, 36, comes to Michi-

gan after spending five years at 
Florida, where he was the team’s 
defensive coordinator and line-
backers coach for the previous 
two seasons, as well as special 
teams coordinator and defensive 
ends coach for three years before 
that. Durkin and Harbaugh have 
worked together before, when 
Durkin was Stanford’s defensive 
ends coach and special teams 
coach from 2007-2009 and Har-
baugh was the head coach.

Grand jury investigating loans 
to Kansas governor’s campaign

Sam Brownback’s 
campaign faces 
federal scrutiny

WICHITA, Kan. (AP) — A 

federal grand jury is looking 
into loans made to Kansas Gov. 
Sam Brownback’s re-election 
campaign and has ordered the 
state’s ethics chief to testify 
next week as part of its investi-
gation, according to a subpoena 
obtained by The Associated 
Press.

Carol Williams, the executive 

director of the Kansas Govern-
mental Ethics Commission, was 
summoned to appear before the 
grand jury Wednesday in Tope-
ka, according to documents the 
AP obtained through an open 
records request. She also was 
ordered to provide documents 
pertaining to loans Brownback’s 
campaign received in 2013 and 
2014.

The only loans listed on 

campaign 
disclosure 
reports 

for those years are one from 
Brownback and others from 
Lt. Gov. Jeff Colyer. Colyer 
loaned Brownback’s campaign 
$500,000 in August — the third 
such loan the governor’s run-
ning mate made to their re-
election bid — according to the 
last disclosure report, filed days 
before the November election.

The loans, the first of which 

was made in December 2013, 
raised eyebrows on the cam-
paign trail because loans in such 
large amounts are rare in Kan-
sas political races and because 
the money was repaid within 
days.

Brownback’s spokeswoman, 

Eileen Hawley, said the investi-
gation “has no merit.”

When asked in August about 

the reasoning for the loans and 
repayment, 
Brownback 
said, 

“I’m not going to explain the 
thought process.”

Some Democrats speculated 

Thursday the loans were an 
attempt to bolster Brownback’s 
fundraising totals, to make 

the campaign appear in better 
shape than it was.

Craig Holman, government 

affairs lobbyist for the cam-
paign finance watchdog Public 
Citizen, said a political motiva-
tion for the loans wouldn’t have 
sparked the grand jury probe. 
Although the loans themselves 
are probably legal, Holman said, 
the timing of them repeated 
three times is “quite suspicious.” 

Brett Berry, general coun-

sel for the ethics commission, 
released the subpoena, which 
the agency received on Dec. 
9, through the open records 
request, but otherwise declined 
comment. 

Colyer told the AP in August 

that the first two $500,000 
short-term loans he made to 
Brownback’s re-election cam-
paign are examples of the good 
stewardship Kansas residents 
expect from government offi-
cials.

Earlier finance reports indi-

cate that Colyer made his first 
$500,000 loan on Dec. 31, 2013, 
the last day covered by a finance 
report due in early January 
2014, and it was repaid on Jan. 
2, 2014. He then made a second 
$500,000 loan on July 23, 2014, 
the second-to-last day covered 
by a finance report due in late 
July. That loan was repaid two 
days later, when a new reporting 
period started.

The third $500,000 loan from 

Colyer was made on Aug. 13, 
and it’s not clear whether it has 
been repaid. The next campaign 
finance report, which would 
disclose such a repayment, is 
due Saturday.

University investment fund 
designed to bolster startups 

Adrenal cancer 
company one of 
many to recieve 

support

BY LINDSEY SCULLEN

Daily Staff Reporter

The Michigan Investment 

in New Technology Startups 
initiative has invested $6.9 
million in 11 different Univer-
sity-based startup companies, 
according to the University’s 
Investment Office.

MINTS is a $25-million 

venture fund managed by the 
University’s Investment Office, 
established by President Emer-
ita Mary Sue Coleman in 2011. 
The initiative invests in start-
up companies that produce 
technology developed at and 
licensed by the University.

Rafael Castilla, director of 

Investment Risk Management 
at the University, said these 
companies must gain prelimi-
nary funding from an inde-
pendent professional venture 
capital investment firm before 
qualifying for MINTS funding. 
Moreover, MINTS would pro-
vide supplementary support 
for research and entrepreneur-
ship.

One of those entrepreneur-

ial research efforts funded by 
MINTS is Atterocor, a com-
pany set on developing a new 
compound — ATR-101 — for 
the treatment of adrenal can-
cer. 
Atterocor 
co-founder 

Julia Owens sad adrenal is 

rare, impacting around 1,000 
patients in the United States.

Owens said that diseases as 

rare as adrenal cancer often 
lie “below the radar screen” of 
major pharmaceutical compa-
nies.

“It was much more compel-

ling for a startup to take on an 
opportunity like this,” Owens 
said. “We do think that there 
will be a reasonable financial 
return for our investors, but by 
doing this in a small company, 
very capital-efficient manner, 
we think that we can do the 
development more quickly and 
make it financially viable to 
develop a drug for such a rare 
population.”

Both 
Frazier 
Healthcare 

Ventures and the Michigan 
Pre-Seed 
Capital 
Fund, 
a 

Michigan Economic Develop-
ment Corporation program led 
by the business incubator Ann 
Arbor Spark, provided Attero-
cor with $250,000 in seed 
funding.

With preliminary financ-

ing under its belt, the company 
qualified for MINTS funding 
after receiving an introduction 
to the venture fund through the 
Office of Technology Transfer, 
the office in charge of commer-
cializing University-developed 
technology and bringing it to 
the market.

During its second round of 

financing, Atterocor received 
$500,000 from MINTS and 
$15.5 million from three other 
venture funds.

Castilla said MINTS is an 

additional support that the 
University’s Investment Office 

is able to provide to companies 
like Atterocor who are rooted 
in University research and 
entrepreneurship.

Both he and Owens noted 

that the University is heav-
ily involved in adrenal cancer 
research.

“U of M has a number of 

adrenal cancer experts and 
adrenal biologists that make 
it uniquely positioned to be 
involved in starting a company 
like Atterocor,” Owens said.

She said this unique posi-

tioning 
comes 
from 
an 

endowment made by former 
Michigan football coach Bo 
Schembechler to the Univer-
sity. Schembechler founded 
the Millie Schembechler Adre-
nal Cancer fund in memory of 
his wife, thereby providing the 
University the money it needed 
to inaugurate one of the only 
multidisciplinary adrenal can-
cer research centers in the 
world.

In addition to holding the 

Millie Schembechler Profes-
sorship in Adrenal Cancer, 
Atterocor 
co-founder 
Gary 

Hammer is the director of the 
Endocrine Oncology Program 
in the Comprehensive Can-
cer Center at the University. 
The EOP has been recognized 
internationally for its accom-
plishments in the treatment 
of adrenal cancer. Atterocor is 
one of the research initiatives 
that has resulted from the cen-
ter.

Castilla 
said 
MINTS 
is 

a “small piece” of the Uni-
versity’s 
venture 
capital 

See FUND , Page 3


investments. It allows the Uni-
versity’s endowment to invest 
in and finance startups with 
technology licensed through 

the 
University’s 
Office 
of 

Technology Transfer.

“From the Investment Office 

point of view, the purpose of 
MINTS is to generate return for 
the endowment because that’s 
what we do,” Castilla said.

MINTS is beneficial to Uni-

versity 
investments 
primar-

ily because it helps diversify 
the University’s endowment. 
MINTS typically invests in 
smaller companies and in their 
early stages while much of the 
University’s endowment lies in 
bigger companies.

Castilla said the MINTS ini-

tiative not only aims to make 
money but also to help com-
mercialize 
technology 
and 

products like Atterocor’s drug. 
MINTS strives to make sure 

that cutting-edge, worthwhile 
technology 
doesn’t 
remain 

stuck in the lab.

“If we have a drug and we 

think it can treat adrenal can-
cer, we need a way to get it 
out to the world and that costs 
money,” Castilla said. “You 
have to raise financing, you 
have to get investors, you have 
to do FDA trials.”

MINTS serves as a way to 

back University entrepreneur-
ship, to diversify the Uni-
versity’s endowment and to 

commercialize University tech-
nology.

“There aren’t many universi-

ties that have such a program,” 
he said. “We’ve had calls from 
other 
universities 
that 
are 

interested in MINTS, but there 
aren’t a lot of universities that 
have a similar program at this 
point in time.”

rate of tuition in the first place 
and the relatively low grade of 
spending by the state on schol-
arships means that Michigan 
is a fairly unaffordable state for 
higher education for most stu-
dents.”

Due to both the recessions and 

the recent cuts in state funding, 
Heller said Michigan universities 
have resorted to tuition increases 
to maintain their budgets.

“One of the reasons that 

tuition has went up so much in 
the last 12 years is because the 
state was cutting funding for the 
institutions,” he said. “The ratio-
nal response on the part of insti-
tutions is to raise tuition.”

To combat the higher tuition 

prices, Heller said MSU has 
tried to increase financial aid 
and scholarships to students, an 
approach the University has also 
championed.

However, he noted the diffi-

culty for many state universities 
with limited resources to take 
this approach for every student.

Allison said the report card is 

not meant to discredit the qual-
ity of education in each state, but 
rather to allow each student to 
see how state governments pri-
oritize higher education in their 
budgets.

“The idea here is that we want 

to provide this context and to 
inform students of the impor-
tant role the state budget plays, 
but then also use this as a tool to 
advocate for better state invest-
ment,” he said. “We don’t want 
this research to just exist in a 
bubble.”

did not believe in the direction 
that Collins was taking the fire 
department.

“I’m not saying he did a bad 

job,” Brevard County Manager 
Stockton Whitten told Florida 
Today last September. “It was 
just philosophical differences.”

In a November press confer-

ence, Seto expressed confidence 
in Collins’ selection. Collins has 

a master’s degree in operations 
management from the University 
of Arkansas, a bachelor’s degree 
in public safety management 
from Franklin University and an 
associate degree in fire-rescue 
administration 
from 
Sinclair 

Community College.

Collins said he plans to make 

Ann Arbor’s fire department 
more progressive, but has not 
been in the job long enough to 
pinpoint necessary changes.

“I will recommend changes 

that I think are appropriate for 

moving us forward, making us a 
top notch fire department in the 
state, perhaps in the midwest 
part of the country,” he said.

Ultimately, Collins said he is 

committed to keeping all Ann 
Arbor citizens safe. He added that 
the fire department makes no dif-
ferentiation between students, 
citizens and elected officials.

“Our job is to provide good, 

basic fire and life safety protec-
tion to anybody and everybody 
in the community and folks that 
visit here as well,” he said.

istrators.

Joe Greene, the principal of 

North Farmington High School 
in Farmington Hills, Mich., was 
relieved the state came to an 
agreement regarding standard-
ized testing.

“We are just pleased that the 

state made a decision, that we 
actually have a clear picture of 
what we’re aiming at, and now 
we can use that to guide our work 
going forward,” Greene said.

The College Board has prom-

ised to begin providing free SAT 
preparation materials to Michi-
gan high schools this spring.

Greene said that he wasn’t 

worried about the students at 
his high school transitioning to 
a new standardized test because 
he believes the school has made 
improvements in the last few 
years that have prepared their 
students for any type of test.

“In talking with my staff and 

my colleagues, we really believe 
that the work we’ve been doing in 
the last two years, to align with 
the Common Core and to align 
our instruction and the learn-
ing we’re causing to really create 
student achievement, it almost 
doesn’t matter what test we put 
in front of our students, we’re 
going to have them ready for it,” 
Greene said.

However, the change from the 

ACT to the SAT has some high 
school students worried that it 

will negatively affect their col-
lege admissions prospects.

Clara Kaul, a junior at Com-

munity High School in Ann 
Arbor, 
said 
the 
discrepancy 

between the ACT and SAT comes 
down to personal preference.

“There’s pretty mixed feelings 

because they’re two different 
tests, and there are people who 
do much better on one than they 
do on the other. Some people are 
for it, because it means they get 
to take the test they did better on, 
some people are against it, some 
people are like, ‘Oh, now I have to 
study for a different test.’”

Despite these worries, the 

revamped SAT, debuting in 2016, 
may alleviate the situation.

The College Board website 

said the focus of the SAT rede-
sign is to create an exam that bet-
ter predicts college performance.

The new exam will include an 

optional 50-minute essay, a read-
ing section, a written language 
test and a math section.

Other notable changes include 

removing the penalty for an 
incorrect answer, limiting mul-
tiple-choice questions to four 
options instead of five and creat-
ing a test that rewards students 
for extensive classroom experi-
ence rather than the ability to 
reason.

These changes make the SAT 

more similar to the ACT, accord-
ing to The New York Times, 
though it will take a few years to 
see if it is a better indicator of col-
lege readiness.

In spite of existing differences 

between the two standardized 
tests, the University does not 
foresee that the state’s decision 
to shift to the SAT will affect 
admissions.

“UM has long accepted either 

ACT or SAT scores with admis-
sion applications, so there is no 
immediate impact at UM from 
this change by the state,” Univer-
sity spokesman Rick Fitzgerald 
wrote in an e-mail.

Michael Bastedo, director of 

the University’s Center for the 
Study of Higher and Postsecond-
ary Education, said one thing that 
will likely change after Michigan 
high schools begin offering the 
SAT is that the percentage of 
University applicants submitting 
the SAT will increase.

Currently, the College Board’s 

website says that 33 percent of 
first-time freshmen applicants 
to a university submit the SAT, 
while 79 percent submit the ACT.

Greene said he is uncertain 

how this shift will impact state 
universities, but expects it to be 
similar to the transition his high 
school will face.

“For the last several years the 

state schools have been used to 
going off the ACT and have been 
using that significantly for Mich-
igan students,” Green said. “Now 
they’re going to have to make a 
shift, but most in-state schools, 
to my understanding, have been 
accepting the SAT for a while, so 
I think this will be a transition, 
but like us they will accommo-
date and move forward.”

Hundreds of Michigan schools 

closed Thursday as the state faced 
another day of dangerously cold 
temperatures and braced for more 
snow. Icy and snowy roads were 
blamed for four traffic deaths in 
the Lower Peninsula.

Detroit Public Schools and 

many other southern Michigan

Thursday, and some were already 
announcing plans to close again 
Friday.

Overnight 
temperatures 

dropped to minus 7 at Benton

Two dead in 
18-vehicle pileup 
on Penn. highway

Two people died and nearly 

two dozen were injured in an 
18-vehicle crash during a snow 
squall in western Pennsylvania 
that left drivers with little vis-

Clarion Township. Nine trucks, 
several of them tractor-trailers, 
and nine cars were involved in 
the crash in the highway’s west-

by the spring

O’Malley says he’ll decide on 

presidential bid by spring Mary-

for president in 2016.

O’Malley spoke Thursday at 

the University of Chicago’s Insti-

residential students — those 
who take classes in-person at a 
university— aren’t entirely sold 
on the concept. The primary 
target for MOOCs are often 
students who are not currently 
enrolled at a traditional college 
campus.

Christopher Brooks, a School 

of Information research fellow, 
has done extensive MOOCs-
related research and is a mem-
ber of DEI’s USE Lab, which 
studies instructional technolo-
gy. Brooks said while he’s found 
that a majority of students find 
value in MOOCs offered by their 
institution, more than a third 
still indicate they’re unsure of 
the benefits.

“There has been significant 

debate as to the value of MOOCs 
for 
students 
in 
traditional 

higher education,” Brooks said. 
“This uncertainty is reflected in 
the student body.”

He said the format and struc-

ture of these courses remain in 
an experimental phase.

“(MOOCs) 
are 
constantly 

changing, are being pushed 
and pulled in various ways — 
from large public universities 
like Michigan showcasing the 
breadth of programming, to 
private venture capital-backed 
corporations like Coursera, to 
quasi-governmental organiza-
tions that deal with workplace 
training,” he said.

However, Brooks predicted 

that within the next five years, 
MOOCs will become a regular 
part of public universities.

Some critics worry MOOCs 

might lead to the downfall of 
traditional college campuses in 
the future. Still, Dan Russell, 
one of Google’s top researchers 
who met with the University’s 
Board of Regents when they 

traveled to California in 2013, 
said the courses are not intend-
ed to displace four-year institu-
tions.

“Historically, once upon a 

time, universities were threat-
ened by the introduction of low-
cost printed books,” Russell said 
in a 2013 interview with The 
Michigan Daily. “They survived 
that. That seems inconceivable 
now. When we look back at this 
time 20 years from now, uni-
versities, I predict, will still be 
around and we’ll have the same 
sort of ‘you’re kidding’ response. 
‘How could they think this 
could destroy the university?’”

Citing an experiment cur-

rently underway where resi-
dential MBA students give 
virtual office hours for MOOCs 
on finance, he said the Uni-
versity’s ability to incorporate 
online courses could also pro-
vide opportunities for tradi-
tional students to both teach 
and learn.

For 
University 
professors 

who don’t currently incorpo-
rate MOOCs in the classroom, 
like John T. Lehman, ecology 
and evolutionary biology pro-
fessor, there’s also caution that 
MOOCs be created and pre-
sented in a way that students 
find the course beneficial and 
relevant to their educational 
growth.

Lehman said for them to be 

useful, they must be tailored to 
fit the needs of students.

“Digital education is a term 

with a cultural meaning that 
is changing rapidly,” Lehman 
said. “I think of it as part of the 
continuum of technologies to 
aid learning that includes spo-
ken and written language, the 
printing press, radio, televi-
sion, etc. The key is to recognize 
what it can deliver best, such 
as repetitive low-stakes learn-
ing exercises, to many students 
asynchronously.”

M

om wants me to have 
a good job. And even 
though I go to art 

school, she still 
thinks that some-
day I’m going to 
be a great doc-
tor. I know that 
it’s not likely that 
I’ll ever make the money a doctor 
makes, but like most artists, I didn’t 
major in Interarts Performance for 
the impressive starting salaries. 
In fact, a non-profit called BFAM-
FAPhD reports that only 10 percent 
of arts graduates are actually mak-
ing a living as artists.

I’m here because the University 

is a sort of utopia — a sometimes 
fractured one — that values com-
plex ideas, nuanced views, hard/
boring work and strangeness.

I’m here because artists are 

taught to be a little reckless, a little 
sloppy, but hopefully smart.

I’m here because I get to work 

with genius professors.

I’m here because my peers are 

geniuses, too.

I’m here because I believe in 

a community of artists who are 
interested in asking big and foolish 
questions.

But I’m not here for job training.
I know that the rest of my life 

is probably going to be an absolute 
pigfuck. And I’m happy about that. 
Excited, even. I knew that when I 
signed up for a degree in perfor-
mance art (or whatever).

I didn’t always know I wasn’t 

here for job training. But a class I 
took in the fall helped me find out.

Six credits of my schedule each 

semester are devoted to thesis 
work. It’s split between indepen-
dent studio time and class time 
with seventeen others also working 
on their theses. And during the fall, 
one credit is spent in a Professional 
Practice lecture.

The idea is that Professional 

Practice will teach the young art-
ists and designers how to get out 
there and get jobs. The course exists 
because past graduating classes felt 
that they were left unprepared in 
terms of job-hunting. Professional 
Practice is the Penny W. Stamps 
School of Art & Design’s way to 
help fill in those blanks. Faculty, 
alumni and other guests give pre-
sentations on topics like “Inter-

viewing Skills,” and “Resources for 
Finding Employment Opportuni-
ties and Resources About the Mate-
rials You Need to Apply for Them.” 
You know, the sort of classes they 
offer inmates.

While 
incredibly 
useful 
for 

students planning to enter the 
design field, Professional Prac-
tice is where a young artist might 
get a little queasy. The conceptual 
sculptors and installation artists 
and performance artists amongst 
us have their dreams squeezed by 
notions of “startups” and “clients” 
and “internships.” For an hour a 
week last semester, the sad cloud 
of employability hung so large over 
the Stamps School of Art & Design 
that its shadow blotted out the 
“Art” part.

If you’re a designer, you can get 

paid. If you’re an artist, you can 
become a designer.

A 
guy 
I 

will 
call 
Mr. 

Employer 
vis-

ited 
Profes-

sional 
Practice 

one 
day. 
Mr. 

Employer is a 
vice president at 
a Big Company. 
He is Important. 
He spoke with a 
deep voice in a 
kind, Midwest-
ern cadence and he offered advice 
about how to get him to give you a 
job. Don’t be too early. Don’t be ner-
vous. Don’t make any spelling mis-
takes. Do take an interest in him. 
Do look good when you show up at 
the office for an interview — “I’m 
judging you as soon as you walk 
through that door.” Do give him 
a firm handshake. Do send him a 
LinkedIn invitation soon after your 
interview — “I think that’s cool.” 
Don’t send him a LinkedIn invita-
tion while you’re still in the parking 
lot — “I think that’s too much.”

It’s nice of Mr. Employer to share 

his time with us.

But Mr. Employer is not the boss 

of me.

I don’t want someone to talk at 

me about how to become present-
able for a job interview, because I 
want to work at a place that is going 
to hire me for the big dumb idiot 
that I am. I don’t want to hear about 
having a firm handshake, because 

maybe someday I won’t have arms. 
And LinkedIn is for the birds.

I do think it is important to 

talk about jobs. Making money is 
important.

But the artists in the room know 

that being an artist is just like being 
anything else — you might work 
so hard you accidentally become 
a millionaire or you might die in a 
fire. So talk to us about how to make 
lattes or how to steal supplies from 
Jo-Ann Fabric or how to cry silent-
ly in public without disturbing oth-
ers. Because having a job is not the 
important thing. We’ll find jobs.

It’s a tough beat if a brilliant 

artist is going to be invited to the 
Venice Biennale because they gave 
Mr. Employer a very firm hand-
shake. Artists are after something 
different, and it’s OK to talk about 
how messy and terrible that might 
be. Talk to us about how for three 

years 
we’re 

going to be frus-
trated because 
it 
seems 
like 

nobody 
cares, 

but if we keep 
at it, something 
will 
finally 

give. 
Talk 
to 

us about how 
after spending 
a year trying to 
be a Real Artist 

we might find out that all we really 
wanted all along was to be a social 
worker. Talk to us about the 90 per-
cent of art grads for whom it just 
doesn’t work out. Or talk to us about 
how a young Robert Rauschenberg 
made some of his most important 
work out of garbage he found on 
the street because he was too poor 
to buy canvas.

But don’t ask Robert Rauschen-

berg to create a LinkedIn profile. 
(Note: I’m not the Rauschenberg 
in this case, but our Rauschenberg 
was there for Mr. Employer’s lec-
ture too.)

Job placement rates aren’t really 

that important. Good art doesn’t 
happen because you read Mr. 
Employer’s memos.

And you can make good art 

without making a good career.

I hope.

Resisting careerist ideology
A

s long as I can remember, I’ve always 
understood that when people asked, 
“What do you want to be when you 

grow up?” what they were 
really asking was, “What 
career do you want to have 
when you grow up?”

What’s strange is that 

none of the words in the 
first question denote any-
thing job or career-related. 
This means that our under-
standing of the question 
must rely on connotations. 
Even though the ques-
tion only denotatively asks 
about what one wants to be as an adult (or a 
“grown-up”) — which could be a wide range 
of things, like a parent, a good person, a read-
er, etc. — we interpret the meaning of the 
question very narrowly, so that it just refers 
to jobs or careers. Why would we reduce what 
could be a beautifully open-ended question to 
a depressingly close-ended one?

Careerist ideology. Instead of indepen-

dently thinking through apparently enig-
matic questions like being and one’s future, 
we prefer to defer to culturally and societally 
fabricated answers — e.g. careerist ideology, 
by which I mean a belief 
system based on the idea 
of the career, which holds 
the virtuosity of careers as 
self-evident and considers 
them centrally important 
to being.

In 
a 
society 
where 

careerist ideology is pre-
dominant, when the ques-
tion of “what to be when 
you grow up” arises, we 
connote the condition of 
“being” accordingly and allow our thought 
to be guided and constrained. The conse-
quence is that we often confuse or equivocate 
“being” with “being a (specific) career,” and 
not exclusively in the context of this question.

What scares and intrigues me is that we 

mostly process these connotations uncon-
sciously — that is, once we’re past a certain 
age, the intended meaning of this question 
is automatically clear to us. This careerist 
ideology exists within us largely outside our 
conscious awareness.

Careerist 
ideology 
can 
be 
primarily 

explained by what’s sometimes called a con-
junction fallacy — mistakenly believing that a 
conjunction of events (a hot and sunny day) is 
more probable than a single event (a hot day). 
When explaining this concept in lecture, my 
cognitive psychology professor gave us the 
following example: “Imagine a health sur-
vey was conducted on adult males. Mr. F was 
included. Which is more probable? (1) That 
Mr. F has had one or more heart attacks, or (2) 
That Mr. F has had one or more heart attacks 
and is over 55 years old? Studies show that 
about 55 percent of people say they believe (2) 
is more likely,” even though it’s not!

The probability of two events co-occurring 

(Mr. F having had one or more heart attacks 
and being over 55 years old) can only be less 
than or equal to the probability of one of the 

events occurring (Mr. F having had one or 
more heart attacks or the probability of Mr. F 
being over 55 years old), never greater.

“To be” does not necessitate “to be career.” 

Obviously there are many other ways to be, 
but in our career-oriented society, we casu-
ally believe in just the one partially because 
of this conjunction fallacy (which, in full, is 
a conjunction fallacy from casual reasoning). 
But there’s a deeper question: Why and how 
do we regularly commit the conjunction fal-
lacy? Why and how is our probability judg-
ment frequently distorted?

Psychologists have a few explanations, but 

one prominent explanation pertains to how 
we represent these scenarios in our minds. 
When we imagine someone having a heart 
attack, we typically imagine an elderly per-
son, and so we sometimes falsely conclude 
that being old and having a heart attack is 
more likely than just having a heart attack.

So it is with careerism. The careerist ide-

ology in our society is so predominant that 
we often assume that being an adult and hav-
ing a career is more likely than just being an 
adult. When we imagine ourselves as adults, 
we imagine ourselves with careers, because 
many of the adults we know have careers. 
Because modern life (or perhaps more accu-

rately postmodern life) 
is hyper-saturated with 
media that what we imag-
ine for ourselves as adults 
highly depends upon the 
simulacra shown on tele-
vision. How many televi-
sion shows today aren’t 
only about a character 
with a career, but are 
about the career itself?

Why would we reduce 

what could be a beauti-

fully open-ended question that offers the 
opportunity to actualize the highest poten-
tials of human creativity to a depressingly 
closed-ended one that basically offers a 
choice between two collars (blue or white)? 
I have maybe avoided this bigger question 
by delving specifically into careerist ideol-
ogy. Careerist ideology is but one facet of a 
much larger system, spanning multiple levels 
of analysis, not least of which is economics 
(i.e., capitalism). Understanding this single 
but critical facet of our collective societal 
consciousness can potentially awaken us to 
related latent mechanisms in our thinking.

My inkling is that individual people, once 

awakened from their dogmatic slumbers, 
would choose to focus on becoming more 
than just a lame career. Cultural thought-
control mechanisms, like the question of 
what to be, hinder the human creativity 
that precedes our great capacity for free-
dom. In recognizing these mechanisms we 
enable ourselves to push past the hindrances 
they impose. But then we’re immediately 
confronted with another challenge: the 
challenge of independently answering the 
deeper philosophical questions that ideol-
ogy answers for us.

the 

“die-in” 
before 

finals in December to the march 
down the streets of Ann Arbor in 
November, students are actively 
voicing 
their 
collective 
stance 

against the issue of police milita-
rization. A year ago, the University 
community experienced a similar 
phenomenon of race-related open 
discussions including the #BBUM 
hashtag campaign and eventual 
demands to the administration 
and sit-ins. Months before that, 
there was another incident involv-
ing a racially insensitive party (the 
“Hood Ratchet Thursday Party”) 
organized by Theta Xi fraternity. 
Both on and offline, students have 
voiced their dissent or support of 
the Black Student Union’s demands. 
Students shared their views on the 
relevance or inanity of cultural 
appropriation. Students generally 
spoke about race relations in Amer-
ica as though they were authorities 
of these issues.

And yet, it also seems that 

despite the passion presented on 
the forums, there is a dissenting 
opinion that race shouldn’t be dis-
cussed, race relations shouldn’t be 
learned. When students aren’t con-
stantly confronted with a piece of 
news related to racial tensions, dis-
cussing it becomes frowned upon. 
The “not everything is about race” 
sentiments are thrown around.

There seems to be a strange dis-

crepancy going on. Many students, 
when pressed with the headlines, 
want to talk about race. They want 
to offer their two cents. They want 
to understand what’s going on, but 
they just as much wish to erase 
issues of discrimination from casu-
al conversations. Why is this the 
case?

The answer might lie in our first 

experiences with outward discus-
sions of race in the classrooms. For 
many students, these talks were, at 
best, outdated. At worst, they were 
completely misaligned with current 
events. The narrative of racism in 
America gener-
ally goes as fol-
lows: there used 
to be racism that 
took the form of 
slavery and then 
Jim Crow seg-
regation; 
how-

ever, thanks to 
the civil rights 
movement 
and 
protesters 

such as Martin 
Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks (but 
not the Black Panther Party), these 
forms of institutional racism have 
been completely eradicated. It is 
a narrative that relegates wrong-
doings to the past and holds our 
society today up to a false ideal of 
complete equality. “Free at last! 
Free at last! Thank God almighty, 
we are free at last!” was a quote 
by Martin Luther King, Jr. that we 
sang in my elementary school while 
holding hands and swaying back 
and forth.

While MLK and civil rights 

activists have certainly succeeded 
in improving the lives of people of 
color in many different aspects, the 
way this part of history is told in the 
classrooms and textbooks shuts out 
any need to further analyze racial 
dynamics in America. It stops peo-

ple from thinking critically of how 
racism was able to transform from 
institutionalized slavery to Jim 
Crow, and how it can just as easily 
change shape in modern contexts.

We students have been given 

an overly optimistic narrative of 
where our society currently stands, 
but we also see situations of rac-
ism in the headlines. Our response 
to these clashing narratives is just 
as conflicted — we both discuss 
racism and feel the discussion is 
not needed. We both type away on 
our keyboards or try to talk over 
our friends during heated conver-
sations and complain about how 

pointless LSA’s 
race and ethnic-
ity requirement 
is.

Ideally, it is 

in these heated 
discussions 
that 
students 

discover 
for 

themselves 
what’s 
hap-

pening in the 
world. But it is 

just as crucial that we pay atten-
tion to how race is taught to our 
youngest and most impression-
able. Other than the race and 
ethnicity class required for LSA 
students, the University does not 
provide many other opportunities 
for individuals to reexamine race 
in an academic setting. Educating 
people about race should incite 
much more public interest in race 
issues. It should reflect what’s 
actually happening and allow stu-
dents to react to Ferguson not with 
stunned denial but with an out-
spoken, well informed solidarity 
for those whose experiences with 
discrimination do not end when 
the headlines go away.

5 — Friday, January 9, 2015

E

very winter, I ask myself the 
same question: Why do I live 
in this godforsaken icebox? 

In the morning, 
after 
pushing 

snooze 
at 
least 

twice, eventually 
I make the insane 
decision to trade my toasty cloud of 
a bed for the arctic atmosphere that 
is my apartment. A morning shower 
means at least a 15-minute commit-
ment to the blow dryer, a time com-
mitment which would have doubled 
had it not been for my five-inch trim 
in October. Walking to class with wet 
hair is not an option; I learned this 
when I spent most of 2012 sneezing 
and sniffling through class. Bundling 
up in January and February usually 
means leggings before jeans, at least 
two pairs of socks, waterproof hiking 
boots, three layers of shirts, a head-
band, gloves, scarf and the grand 
finale, a three-year-old down parka 
that is starting to lose feathers. Most 
days, I don’t even look good. Makeup, 
styling and further delays aside, it 
takes me — a self-proclaimed low-
maintenance girl — about 45 minutes 
to get ready in a frosty morning. Get-
ting ready to go to the bar on a Thurs-
day night, well, that’s a completely 
different animal.

We all know the drill, and if you’re 

new to Michigan and under the 
impression that November was the 
peak of our icy damnation, do your-
self a favor and invest in some Smart-
Wool socks while they’re probably on 
sale. People like to say that women 
and men are equal, but let’s get real. 
If you’re a girl, you should prob-
ably buy yourself two pairs, because 
you’re probably colder. The average 
American woman is 92 percent as tall 
as the average man, and weighs just 
85.5 percent as much. Statistically 
we’re shorter, smaller and surprise: 
have longer hair.

The additional tax we pay as 

women isn’t limited to an extra 
10-minute blow dry and an extra 
pair of socks. Forget makeup, nail 
polish and the cost differences of 
our clothing; in order for women to 
uphold societal standards of femi-
ninity, the cost is significant. Five 
products are the main culprits of 
this microeconomic division of the 
sexes: razor blades, conditioner, 
tampons, Midol and bras. Of course, 
men use conditioner and razors, but 
generally in much smaller quantities 
(as I’ll explain).

A wise woman once said, “Some-

body wrote in that book that I’m 
lying about being a virgin, ’cause I 
use super-jumbo tampons, but I can’t 

help it if I’ve got a heavy flow and a 
wide-set vagina!” She makes a good 
point. This does, however, mean that 
she’s a member of the female popula-
tion. An 18 pack of Playtex Sport tam-
pons at CVS costs $5.49: 30.5 cents 
each. At a rate of four per day for four 
days a month, the total monthly tam-
pon cost for women comes to a mod-
est $4.88. Cramps? That’ll cost you. 
Midol sells for $8.38 for a pack of 24, 
34.9 cents each. Two per day for four 
days out of the month comes to $2.79. 
Having your period every month? 
$7.67. Being a woman? Priceless.

I firmly believe that men and 

women are intellectually equal; how-
ever, men don’t have boobs. Victoria’s 
Secret sells bras for over $50 a piece, 
but as an Economics major, I can’t 
stomach dropping that much know-
ing they cost about four dollars to 
manufacture. In order to maintain 
as conservative an estimate as pos-
sible, I picked out my favorite bra by 
Gilligan & O’Malley, which goes for 
$16.99 on Target.com. If you’re a girl, 
you know that 
these 
stretch 

out 
and 
don’t 

last forever, so 
two 
bras 
per 

year is a frugal 
expenditure on 
bras. Since we’re 
calculating 
the 

extra cost on a 
monthly 
basis, 

this 
means 

women 
are 

spending $2.83 on bras monthly. Not 
bad, right?

Next, there’s everything that goes 

on inside the shower. I grew up with 
two younger brothers, who often 
accused me of using up all of the 
hot water. I typically ignored their 
complaints; I was older, smarter, a 
girl, and therefore entitled to use 
more water than them. I asked my 
brothers how much conditioner 
they used. RJ, who’s 18, poured out 
about one teaspoon. My 16-year-old 
brother denied using conditioner 
whatsoever, ran into the basement, 
and got back to his friends on Xbox 
live. At CVS, I picked out a seeming-
ly gender-neutral and cost-efficient 
conditioner, Garnier Fructis. The 
bottle costs $4.79 for 13.5 fluid ounc-
es, which comes to an average cost 
of six cents per day for my brother 
and 18 cents per day for me. Nick-
els and dimes, but still a difference 
of 300 percent. On a monthly basis, 
women are spending $3.60 more on 
conditioner than men.

We all know razors for both men 

and women are overpriced. Worse 

than that, they never go on sale. 
Before going and taking an inven-
tory of CVS, I was under the impres-
sion that women paid significantly 
more for razors. As I compared basic 
three blade razors for men and 
women, I realized I was wrong. An 
eight pack of Gillette Venus Classic 
for women costs $23.79 each, and 
an eight pack of Gillette Match 3 for 
men costs $22.99. Each razor costs a 
woman $2.97, and a man $2.87. Just 
a slight difference, right? Not when 
you account for the differences in 
total surface area women and men 
are expected to shave, prescribed 
by gender norms. For men, from the 
nose down to the chin until the ears, 
and the entire area of the front half 
of the neck, this came to 435.5 cm^2. 
For women, accounting for average 
surface area of two thighs, calves and 
armpits, this number was 7,323.08 
cm. Not only are we paying 10 cents 
more for a similar razor, we have to 
shave 16 to 17 times more surface 
area than our male counterparts.

Let’s assume 

that 
women 

shave a third as 
often 
as 
men. 

Let’s 
say 
the 

average 
man 

spends 
$22.99 

per 
year 
on 

razors, 
switch-

ing once every 
month 
and 
a 

half. This means 
that women who 

shave even one-third as much as men 
are spending 5.6 times as much for 
the same quality of shave, an annual 
fee which comes out to $133.224. 
Monthly, this means a woman would 
spend $9.20 more than men on 
 

razors alone.

Accounting for just five basic 

and necessary products, it’s clear 
that from a cost-of-living per-
spective, men and women are not 
equal. I’m not talking about fash-
ionable clothes, makeup or a girls’ 
nights out. For the bare-minimum 
hygiene, it costs the average woman 
approximately $23.30 more per 
month to live than the average man. 
Guys, next time you’re at Charley’s 
with your female colleague, consid-
er these baseline costs that she has 
to endure. If she’s wearing makeup, 
a stylish outfit or four-inch heels, 
the differential expands. Maybe 
next time, instead of splitting the 
bill for that fishbowl, you pay that 
$15. Plus tax.

Home for the holidays

O

n 
my 
first 
flight 
home 
from 

Michigan in December 2011, my 
stomach bubbled with a familiar 

Pancheros 
burrito 
and 

knots of excitement wound 
themselves tighter as I flew 
closer to my at-the-time 
long-distance 
boyfriend. 

Sophomore year, I felt the 
relief of being done with a semester that I 
finally enjoyed and belted delayed laughs 
as a result of the talent show at Detroit 
Metropolitan Wayne County Airport. Junior 
year, the flight took off for San Francisco 
and I played Alt-J’s An Awesome Wave on 
repeat as I prematurely fantasized about 
my semester that was about to take place 
in Madrid while drifting in and out of sleep 
on the plane home. This year, however, was 
different; it was calm and platonic. Although 
it’s the last time I will be making this flight 
home for such a brief time, it felt tranquil 
and I felt accustomed to the typical waves 
of nausea and excitement that one associates 
with coming home, wherever that may be and 
whatever that may mean.

There’s this weird thing that happens when 

you are dropped off at college. You watch as 
your parents cascade down 5th Bartlett as 
the heavy blue metal door slams in your face 
and you think to yourself, 
“What 
now?” 
Presum-

ably, you have been caged 
in your house for a strong 
18 years and all of sudden 
you are let loose. Maybe 
it’s just my closest friends 
and me, but I felt con-
fused. For lack of a bet-
ter word or psychological 
term, I embarked on the 
biggest identity crisis of 
my life upon seeing that 
dorm room door crash in my face. The process 
of coming home and the nostalgia of the holi-
days only exacerbate this reminiscent feeling 
about my first day on campus and serve as a 
pivotal point to understand one’s growth.

It’s difficult to tell someone to embrace 

these times. To embrace the awkward hugs 
that you face in your local supermarket or the 
run-ins with your mom’s friends at her holi-
day parties, but these moments of discomfort 
are essential and inevitably shift through 
your college formation. These encounters 
give us something to laugh about and learn 
from when you are finally 21 and can sit 
around the bar ordering tequila shots with 
three guys you took Calculus with six years 
ago. It’s not that everything is entirely normal 
or comfortable now, but there’s a certain reas-
surance in the fact that life continues upon its 
meandering and ever-changing path. The dis-
comfort and fluctuations are normalized and 
you began to feel more and more prepared for 
what’s next even as the future gets more and 
more expansive.

Now, in the depths of my senior year Win-

ter Break, I see home as a different place. I 
recognize that where I am today was not by 
fault, and is much accredited to my time at the 
University.

At a bar the other night, I spoke with a guy 

in my graduating class from high school that 
had been crowned the biggest clown in our 
grade. He was that macho man who showed 
little emotion. This year, he told me he was 
into writing and screenplays. He reminisced 
about the time his babysitter thought he was 
sleeping and he stayed up watching “Silence 
of the Lambs,” consequently crying himself 
to sleep. He didn’t stop smiling as we prom-
enaded around the saloon looking at old cou-
ples rekindling flames, or more, often-new, 
love interests emerging from the woodwork. 
I am reminded to leave room for change.

At Christmas dinner, my friend Laura spoke 

to me about her friends who had developed 
eating disorders and their strange relation-
ships with food while at college. I told her I 
remembered those times. After my freshman 
year 20-pound extravaganza and my work-
outaholic sophomore year, I was ebbing into 
a normal relationship once again with food 
and my body image. Not to say these feelings 
won’t emerge again, but I feel at ease with my 
ability to take the turns as they come.

On the way home from skiing in Lake Tahoe, 

I was discussing an encoun-
ter I had with a friend to 
my dad. He thought for a 
second and asked me if I 
remembered the first page 
of the Great Gatsby. He has 
been reciting it for years, 
but reminded me again, 
“In my younger and more 
vulnerable years my father 
gave me some advice that 
I’ve been turning over in 
my mind ever since. ‘When-

ever you feel like criticizing any one,’ he told 
me, ‘just remember that all the people in this 
world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve 
had.’ ” Sometimes it takes the simple repetition 
of sacred words.

The holidays, fortunate or not, bring back 

shadows of the past. This year my dog wasn’t 
dressed in her holiday garb and our dear-
est family friend wasn’t cutting coffee cake 
in the kitchen, but we did have a new recipe 
for garlic mashed potatoes and one young 
child joined us at the kid’s Christmas table. 
Remember the time is now. Remember this 
as hard as you can, and as you hold on to the 
present moment it lightens the holiday shad-
ows as you remind yourself that now is not 
forever. What is now the present will next 
year be a memory. We will continue to won-
der who we were and are, but this knowledge 
that the undulations of emotions and inevi-
table growth are persistent keep us thinking 
as the new years roll through.

T

he 
#BlackLivesMatter 

movement has taken over 
social, national and inter-

national media in 
recent 
months. 

Fueled by trag-
ic 
vignettes 
of 

police 
brutality 

against 
presum-

ably 
innocent 

African 
Ameri-

cans, the move-
ment is “rooted in 
the 
experiences 

of Black people in 
this country who 
actively resist (our) de-humaniza-
tion,” and “is a call to action and a 
response to the virulent anti-Black 
racism that permeates our society.”

The movement’s official media 

outlets have striven to make clear 
that all Black lives matter by call-
ing attention to the rampant sys-
temic injustices facing those Black 
individuals whose racial identi-
ties exist in conjunction with their 
sexual and gender identities, as 
well as their status within disabled, 
incarcerated or immigrant com-
munities. In vying for societal and 
judicial equality in this country, 
a movement which stresses the 
importance of solidarity across the 
spectrum of all personal identities 
serves as an example of what mod-
ern activism should be: inclusive 
and empathetic to the plights of 
similarly affected individuals.

In a December 26, 2014 op-ed in 

The Advocate magazine, freelance 
writer Randy Roberts Potts touch-
es upon this idea by attempting to 
draw parallels between the #Black-
LivesMatter 
and 
past 
LGBTQ 

rights movements. Potts calls for 
solidarity across movements, dis-
cussing how riots in Ferguson and 
subsequent rallies nationwide are 
reminiscent of the 1969 Stonewall 
riots. In these riots, LGBT-iden-
tifying individuals fought against 

police forces conducting an unso-
licited raid on the Stonewall Inn—a 
hub of sorts for impoverished and 
struggling LGBT youth in New 
York City’s Greenwich Village.

Stonewall served as a catalyst 

for the queer-rights activism of 
the 20th century and today, much 
in the same way, Potts says, that 
the recent happenings in Fergu-
son have reignited a national dis-
cussion on racial politics and the 
unequal treatment of minority 
populations. In his closing remarks 
on the topic, Potts suggests that 
respect be given to a movement rel-
ative to its importance in the public 
eye at a particular moment in his-
tory: “All lives matter,” he says, “but 
our focus must center on whichever 
lives, in our own 
time, in our own 
moment, matter 
least.”

In 
other 

words, activists 
must 
practice 

solidarity 
for 

similarly-rooted 
causes 
under 

the pretense of 
equity; provide 
the most ener-
gy to the most pressing of issues, 
only moving on to other problems 
once the most urgent matters have 
been dealt with. It’s a logical plan 
of action—at least for trauma sur-
geons. In the fight against social 
inequality, however, letting alone 
a seemingly small internal bleed in 
favor of a wound perceived as more 
threatening could prove to be fatal 
for the entire, commonly shared 
cause.

Why should combating social 

injustice be a matter of precedent in 
line with particular events? When a 
group of people who have been sub-
jugated into second-class citizenry 
experience a particularly unsettling 
event—as is the case with Ferguson, 

as was the case with Stonewall—
others should empathize and act 
for the larger cause of social, politi-
cal and economic equality for all 
groups. They should act not only 
against the wrongs made against the 
group directly affected, but also act 
in protest of a system which allows 
that wrong to occur to any minor-
ity group, regardless of color, creed, 
sexuality or gender.

Through my eyes, the reaction 

to the many instances of failures 
in the justice system pertaining 
to Black individuals over the past 
months should serve as an oppor-
tunity for the nation to reevaluate 
its handling of all crimes rooted 
in hate and social injustice. This 
reevaluation should be made in 

consideration 
of 
the 
Black 

population and 
their 
specific 

needs, but also 
in consideration 
of other subju-
gated 
minor-

ity groups in 
this nation who 
have 
experi-

enced 
similar 

wrongs 
as 
a 

result of their ascribed statuses.

All lives matter. Michael Brown’s 

life mattered just as much as the 
lives of Eric Garner, Larry King, 
and Brisenia Flores. This being 
said, combating social injustice 
should be a fight not based in equi-
ty. Rather, it should be a sweeping 
act in which all victims of social 
inequality in this country can par-
take and empathize, come together 
in solidarity and appeal for equality 
for all downtrodden groups for all 
time, not merely at a point in time 
which is most convenient for one 
group or another.

The Kouachi 

brothers were known 

to American and 
French authorities

PARIS (AP) — The younger 

brother was a ladies’ man who 
belted out rap lyrics before the 
words of a radical preacher per-
suaded him to book a flight to 
Syria to wage holy war.

Less is known about his elder 

sibling, whose ID card was 
found in the getaway car used by 
the gunmen in the newspaper-
office massacre in Paris. But 
U.S. officials said Thursday both 
were on the U.S. no-fly list and 
the older brother had traveled to 
Yemen, although it was unclear 
whether he was there to join up 
with extremist groups such as 
al-Qaida.

The 
Kouachi 
brothers 
— 

32-year-old Cherif and 34-year-
old Said — emerged as the 
subject of a huge manhunt after 
the precision attack Wednesday 
that killed 12 people at Charlie 
Hebdo, a satirical weekly that 
lampooned radical Muslims and 
the Prophet Muhammad him-
self.

Witnesses said the gunmen in 

the attack claimed allegiance to 
al-Qaida’s offshoot in Yemen.

Both Kouachi brothers — the 

Paris-born offspring of Algerian 
parents — were already known 
to American and French coun-
terterrorism authorities.

Cherif, a former pizza deliv-

eryman, had appeared in a 2005 
French TV documentary on 
Islamic extremism and was sen-
tenced to 18 months in prison in 
2008 for trying to join up with 
fighters battling in Iraq.

It was the teachings of a fire-

brand Muslim preacher that 
put him on the path to jihad in 
his rough-and-tumble neigh-
borhood of northeastern Paris, 
Kouachi was quoted as saying in 
the documentary.

The cleric “told me that 

(holy) texts prove the benefits 
of suicide attacks,” Kouachi was 
quoted as saying. “It’s written in 
the texts that it’s good to die as 
a martyr.”

Associated Press reporters 

who covered the 2008 trial, 
which exposed a recruiting 
pipeline for Muslim holy war in 
the multi-ethnic and working-
class 19th arrondissement of 
Paris, recalled a skinny young 
defendant who appeared very 
nervous in court.

Cherif Kouachi’s lawyer said 

at the time that his client had 
fallen in with the wrong crowd.

During the trial, Kouachi was 

said to have undergone only 
minimal training for combat 
— going jogging in a Paris park 
to shape up and learning how 
a Kalashnikov automatic rifle 
works by studying a sketch.

French Interior Minister Ber-

nard Cazeneuve, however, said 
Thursday that Kouachi had been 
described by fellow would-be 
jihadis at the time as “violently 
anti-Semitic.”

Imprisonment 
changed 

him, his former attorney Vin-
cent Ollivier told Le Parisien 
newspaper in a story published 
Thursday.

Kouachi became closed off 

and unresponsive and started 
growing a beard, the lawyer 
said, adding that he wondered 
whether the stint behind bars 
transformed his client into a 
ticking time bomb.

There was a time, though, 

when he had very different 
interests.

Footage in the documentary, 

part of a prestigious French 
public television series titled 
“Evidence 
for 
the 
Prosecu-

tion,” shows him in 2004, when, 
according to the narrator, the 
lanky young man in a black 
T-shirt with extremely close-
cropped hair and a chunky 
wristwatch 
was 
keener 
on 

spending time with pretty girls 
than on going to the mosque. He 
appears relaxed and smiling as 
he pals around with friends.

After he was released from 

prison, he worked in a super-
market’s fish section in the Paris 
suburbs for six months begin-
ning in 2009. Supervisors said 
he gave no cause for concern.

In 2010, police detained him 

again in a probe of an alleged 
plot to free an Islamic militant 
sentenced to life in prison for 
bombing a Paris train line in 
1995. Kouachi was ultimately 

released with no charges ever 
brought.

Much less has become public 

about the older brother, Said, 
but Cazeneuve said the jobless 
resident of the city of Reims 
was also known to authorities, 
despite having never been pros-
ecuted, because he was “on the 
periphery” of the illegal activi-
ties his younger sibling was 
involved in.

A senior U.S. counterterror-

ism official said Thursday both 
brothers had been put on the 
U.S. no fly list and another U.S. 
official said Said Kouachi had 
traveled to Yemen. 

The officials spoke on condi-

tion of anonymity because they 
were not authorized to discuss 
foreign intelligence publicly.

A French security official, 

speaking on condition of ano-
nymity because of the sensitivity 
of the matter, said that Ameri-
can authorities had shared intel-
ligence with France indicating 
that Said had traveled to Yemen 
several years ago for training. 
French authorities were seeking 
to verify the information, the 
official said.

In Reims, about 90 miles (145 

kilometers) northeast of Paris,) 
Said frequented a prayer room 
on the ground floor of an apart-
ment building, according to the 
local imam, Abdul-Hamid al-
Khalifa.

If French authorities are now 

hunting for the right suspects, 
it may be because of Said, Caze-
neuve hinted.

In the stolen Citroen aban-

doned Wednesday by the gun-
men, police found a French 
identity card in the older Koua-
chi’s name, the minister said.

Moreover, after the attack-

ers dumped the first car, they 
grabbed another, and Cazeneuve 
said the elder Kouachi had been 
identified as “the aggressor” by 
witnesses shown his photo.

A third suspect identified by 

French authorities in the attack 
turned himself in Wednesday 
night. Mourad Hamyd, 18, sur-
rendered at a police station after 
learning his name had been 
linked to the case in the news, 
said Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre, 
spokeswoman for the Paris 
prosecutor.

Suspects from Charlie Hebdo
attack were on U.S. no-fly list

Four years after 
the mass shooting, 
former Florida Rep. 
remembers victims

TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — For-

mer Arizona Rep. Gabby Gif-
fords spent part of the fourth 
year anniversary of the mass 
shooting that left her gravely 
wounded meeting with Presi-
dent Barack Obama as her city 
paused to remember the trag-
edy that left six dead and 13 
injured.

Nineteen solemn bells rang 

Thursday morning to honor the 
victims of a shooting in Tucson 
at a political event hosted by 
Giffords.

Giffords did not attend the 

event but met with Obama dur-
ing his visit to Phoenix.

“It was four years ago today 

that Gabby and some other 
wonderful 
Arizonans 
were 

gunned down outside a super-
market in Tucson. It’s a tough 
day for a lot of folks down there. 
We keep them in our thoughts 
and prayers,” Obama said.

“She’s a hero, and she’s a 

great Arizonan. So we’re really 
proud of her,” he said.

The ceremony in Tucson 

took place at 10:10 a.m. and 

included a bell-ringing for each 
of the 19 victims of the attack. 
Tucson Mayor Jonathan Roth-
schild also hosted a bell-ring-
ing ceremony at a fire station 
downtown.

“I think it’s important that 

we never forget what happened 
because there are a lot of les-
sons that can be learned from 
what happened,” said former 
Arizona Rep. Ron Barber, who 
was wounded in the shooting 
and who attended the ceremo-
ny.

Giffords did not participate 

in any public events but posted 
messages on her verified Twit-
ter account.

“Since I was shot four years 

ago today, it’s been step by 
step. Progress has come from 
working hard,” Giffords wrote. 
“Today, I remember, and I take 
another step. We have to move 
ahead.”

Peter Rhee, chief of the trau-

ma department at the Univer-
sity of Arizona Medical Center, 
is the doctor credited with sav-
ing the lives of Giffords and 
others.

Standing outside the hospi-

tal Thursday, Rhee said he was 
changed by that day and thinks 
about it often. But he said many 
positive things came of the 
tragedy.

“The discussion on gun con-

trol is much higher on a nation-
al level. We can’t just keep 
going on like this,” Rhee said.

The Jan. 8, 2011, shooting 

shook Tucson, a city that con-
siders itself a tight-knit com-
munity despite its half-million 
residents. Among those killed 
was 9-year-old Christina-Tay-
lor Green, whose face adorns 
many of the memorial messages 
left at the shooting site and the 
hospital.

U.S. District Judge John Roll 

and Giffords aide Gabe Zim-
merman also were killed. Bar-
ber, who worked for Giffords at 
the time, was wounded but later 
took over her seat in Congress.

Jared Loughner was sen-

tenced to life in prison for the 
shooting.

Giffords, who was shot in the 

head, still struggles to speak 
and walk. She has become 
the face of gun control, hav-
ing founded Americans for 
Responsible 
Solutions 
with 

her husband, retired astronaut 
Mark Kelly.

In the 2014 election, the gun 

control group raised millions 
for congressional candidates, 
including Barber, who lost his 
seat to Republican Martha 
McSally. The group has gar-
nered 
attention 
nationwide 

but has been able to do little to 
change gun laws.

17-year-old with 

Hodgkin lymphoma 
wants to make own 
medical decisions 

HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — A 

17-year-old girl being forced by 
state officials to undergo che-
motherapy for her cancer says 
she understands she’ll die if she 
stops treatment but it should be 
her decision.

The state Supreme Court 

ruled Thursday state officials 
aren’t violating the rights of 
the girl, Cassandra C., who has 
Hodgkin lymphoma.

Cassandra told The Associ-

ated Press in an exclusive text 
interview from her hospital that 
it disgusts her to have “such 
toxic harmful drugs” in her 
body and she’d like to explore 
alternative treatments.

She 
said 
she 
understands 

“death is the outcome of refusing 
chemo” but she believes in “the 
quality of my life, not the quan-
tity.”

The court ruled Cassandra’s 

lawyers had the opportunity to 
prove she’s mature enough to 
make that decision during a Juve-
nile Court hearing in December 
and failed to do so.

Cassandra will be free to make 

her own medical decisions when 
she turns 18 in September. She, 
with the support of her mother, 
had fought against the six-month 
course of chemotherapy.

The case centered on whether 

the girl is mature enough to deter-
mine how to treat her Hodgkin 
lymphoma, with which she was 
diagnosed in September. Several 
other states recognize the mature 
minor doctrine.

Cassandra was allowed to go 

home to undergo treatment in 
November but instead ran away 

for a week, according to court 
documents.

“Cassandra either intention-

ally misrepresented her inten-
tions to the trial court or she 
changed her mind on this issue 
of life and death,” Chief Justice 
Chase T. Rogers said.

Cassandra is confined in a 

room at Connecticut Children’s 
Medical Center in Hartford, 
where she is being forced to 
undergo chemotherapy, which 
doctors said would give her an 
85 percent chance of survival. 
Without it, they said, there was 
a near-certainty of death within 
two years.

The teen’s mother, Jackie For-

tin, of Windsor Locks, said after 
the arguments Thursday that she 
wouldn’t allow her daughter to 
die. The single mother said she 
and her daughter just want to 
seek alternative treatments that 
don’t include putting the “poison” 
of chemotherapy into her body.

“This is her decision and her 

rights, which is what we are 
here fighting about,” Fortin said. 
“We should have choices about 
what to do with our bodies.”

Fortin and her lawyer said they 

are considering their next step 
after losing the case but expect 
to go back to the trial court in an 
attempt to more fully explore the 
mature minor argument.

After Cassandra was diag-

nosed with high-risk Hodgkin 
lymphoma, she and her mother 
missed several appointments, 
prompting doctors at Connecti-
cut Children’s Medical Center 
to notify the state Department 
of Children and Families, court 
documents say.

The child welfare agency inves-

tigated and a trial court granted 
the agency temporary custody of 
Cassandra. Lawyers for Cassan-
dra and her mother then sought 
an injunction prohibiting medical 
treatment but were unsuccessful.

Daily Arts Writer

Joel and Ethan Coen (each 

credited with the “Unbroken” 
screenplay) are no strangers 
to 
the 
idea 

of 
suffering. 

They made “A 
Serious Man” 
in 2009, which 
is 
essentially 

an entire movie 
dedicated 
to 

the exploration 
of 
a 
single 

question: why 
do bad things happen to good 
people? Of course, the Coen 
brothers weren’t the first to 
borrow this question from the 
Book of Job in the Bible, nor 
have they really been successful 
in trying to provide a good 
answer. But what they have 
managed to do is address, with 
great honesty, the perplexity 
man faces when he tries to 
understand his circumstances. 
“Unbroken” proves, to a certain 
extent, that humanity’s struggle 
derives not from his attempt 
to comprehend evil, but rather, 
from his attempt to comprehend 
evil’s intention.

There’s a scene in the film 

that 
illustrates 
this 
point 

very simply. Louis Zamperini 
(Jack 
O’ 
Connell, 
“Harry 

Brown”), the film’s captive yet 
determined hero, stands on the 
roof of a POW barrack with a 
couple of fellow prisoners and 
soldiers. Together they watch 
as American planes bomb the 
Japanese territory just outside 
their camp. As they work to 
extinguish small fires on the 
barrack 
roofs, 
they 
begin 

discussing 
their 
fate. 
One 

prisoner remarks on how close 
the Americans are getting to 
the camp. Another prisoner 
reassures everyone that in a 
few weeks the Allied forces will 
liberate them all. More telling, 
however, is when a prisoner 
claims 
he’s 
overheard 
the 

Japanese officers talk about the 
Allied approach, and how the 
officers had made an agreement 

to kill every prisoner in the 
camp. Suddenly, the prisoners’ 
situation becomes shockingly 
clear: if the Allied forces lose, 
they will all be executed, and 
yet, if the Allied forces win, 
they will all be executed. 
After a moment of silence, one 
prisoner asks, “Then what are 
we supposed to pray for?”

This question is central to 

“Unbroken” and its effort to 
retell the remarkable story of 
Louis Zamperini, an Olympic 
runner who volunteered to fight 
in World War II, who drifted for 
45 days in a small life raft at sea 
and who was taken prisoner by 
the Japanese and tortured for 
nearly two years. We watch as 
conflict after conflict befalls 
him: the death of a friend and 
soldier, the savage assault of 
fellow prisoners, Zamperini’s 
own gruesome and frequent 
beatings. We watch as his face 
takes repeated blows — both 
from 
Mutsuhiro 
Watanabe 

(newcomer 
Miyavi), 
the 

camp’s commander, and from 
other prisoners – and we see 
it break and heal, break and 
heal what seems to be a dozen 
times. “Unbroken” runs for 137 
minutes, and a solid 110 of them 
take us straight into the grit of 
Zamperini’s suffering. Soon the 
prisoner’s 
question 
becomes 

more relevant for us, as the 
audience: where is the hope in 
all this misery?

Zamperini’s 
story 
is 
a 

testament to the unbreakable, 
irreducible will of humankind, 
and to the power of the mind 
in times of enormous adversity. 
However, Angelina Jolie, in 
her directorial debut, tells this 
grand story with sufficient 
grace, but not the necessary 

grace. 

Scenes are too often lost to 

the drama of the endeavor; 
the film actively tries to make 
the audience believe in the 
value of the story. But the 
story itself, even if it had been 
filmed on a $100 budget with 
an iPhone camera, would be 
able to deliver its own value 
a thousand times over. The 
narrative doesn’t need any 
additional drama, yet too often 
Jolie tries to streamline it as if 
the emotion needs a cue. Take, 
for example, the flashbacks 
that 
Zamperini 
experiences 

while Watanabe is beating him 
senseless. The scene shifts 
between Zamperini running 
shirtless on a beach and lying 
shirtless in a pool of blood in 
a Japanese POW camp. The 
opposing images do nothing 
to complement one another; 
instead, given the fact that at 
one point Zamperini had the 
choice to leave the camp but 
decided to stay, this flashback 
sequence almost makes you 
root against Zamperini for 
not 
taking 
his 
chance 
to 

escape. This kind of audience 
resignation 
(withdrawing 

empathy 
from 
Zamperini’s 

story) is indirectly elicited far 
too often in the film. 

Another major issue is the 

film’s conclusion, which occurs 
suddenly and fails to provide 
the joyous emotion or relief the 
viewer has been anticipating 
for two hours. After so much 
anguish, despair and defeat, 
the short-lived victory at the 
end of the film feels a bit like 
self-mockery. It’s as though the 
victory is not what matters. It’s 
as though Zamperini’s story 
hinges only on the degree of 
his suffering, and that through 
it, through his endless abuse as 
a victim and a POW, does the 
significance of his story finally 
emerge. For the film to be titled 
“Unbroken” seems almost, well, 
backward. At the end of it all, 
we’re again left wondering 
without any real direction or 
answer: what are we supposed 
to hope for? 

Film’s stars talk 
‘Into the Woods’

Anna Kendrick and 
Chris Pine sing the 
praises of musical 

adaptation

By VANESSA WONG

Daily Arts Writer

“Into the Woods” may have 

earned its name as a Sondheim 
musical, but the Disney film 
revamp adds a modern twist. In 
a conference call The Michigan 
Daily attended, “Into the Woods” 
‘s storybook couple Anna Kend-
rick (“Pitch Perfect”) and Chris 
Pine (“Star Trek”) — Cinderella 
and Prince Charming, respec-
tively — discussed the challenges 
of bridging the stage-to-film genre 
differences and ushering a classic 
fairytale into a new era.

Though any given first grader 

could coherently summarize the 
Brothers Grimm tales featured in 
“Into the Woods,” the stars argue 
that a new adaptation still holds 
relevance.

“The great thing was that 

(director Rob Marshall, “Chi-
cago”) really embraced a modern 
sensibility for all the characters, 
because since these stories kind 
of belong to the ages, you know, it 
makes sense that in some ways we 
update them every generation,” 
Kendrick said.

And update them we do. The 

film’s Cinderella differs from other 
renditions in that she has a greater 
awareness of the individual agen-
cy she has to shape her life’s trajec-
tory. Kendrick explains how she 
made Cinderella’s timeless charac-
ter her own “sort of over-thinking, 
over-logical, neurotic princess,” 
even as the world seems to be col-
liding around her.

“I think modern women have 

a tendency to over-think every-
thing and they don’t trust their gut 
and we have to look at everything 

from every angle and find the right 
decision, and she’s doing that the 
entire piece until something that 
she really has to reckon with hap-
pens,” Kendrick said. “You know, 
when the community is in crisis, 
suddenly it’s very clear for her 
what’s important ... she’s very cen-
tered and she’s very calm, more so 
than she is in any other moment in 
the piece.”

In contrast, Pine took on a 

more satirical portrayal of Prince 
Charming.

“Everybody in this film goes 

through these really wonderfully 
complex journeys and they expe-
rience joy and heartache and sor-
row and grief. And then my prince 
is just way more two-dimensional 
than that, and … I think that I had 
a lot of fun bringing some levity to 
the picture, or tried to — there’s a 
bit of a buffoon in the prince,” Pine 
said. “Cinderella gives him the 
chance to really feel and to really 
connect with her, and I think he 
does for a brief second, but then 
does make the choice to kind of go 
back and run off and relive over 
and over and over again this story-
book life that he is so accustomed 
to.”

Because of its heightened real-

istic awareness, “Into the Woods” 
sheds the idea that the stories of 
the Brothers Grimm are nothing 
more than a sweet bedtime story. 
Instead, it offers entertainment for 
children and adult audiences alike.

“There’s the element where it’s 

pure fantasy and it’s exciting for 
kids and then there’s an element 
that’s really specifically centered 
towards parents, which is we have 
to be careful what we tell our chil-
dren, and children take lessons to 
heart, and it’s sort of about under-
standing that they’re listening to 
us even if doesn’t feel that way,” 
Kendrick said.

But 
successfully 
updating 

familiar tales and their charac-
ters wasn’t the only thing the 
film adaptation had to master. 

At its core, “Into the Woods” is a 
musical, with an incredible, well-
known score by one of Broadway’s 
greatest geniuses. The film adap-
tation must do Sondheim justice, 
and though both Kendrick and 
Pine have previous singing expe-
rience, molding their technique to 
fit a new discipline was a welcome 
challenge. 

“The musical theater genre is 

very specific, and the sound that 
you’re going for is obviously quite 
different than something like the 
country music I did before. But 
I had a lot of fun learning the ins 
and outs of the technique and of 
the genre,” Pine said.

Kendrick agreed, calling this 

performance “harder, a lot harder” 
than her 2012 work in “Pitch Per-
fect.” But still, she said, “singing 
Sondheim is so rewarding and ful-
filling and it was just, it was just a 
dream come true.”

It also helps that they’re in good 

company. From director Mar-
shall to accomplished lead actors 
Meryl Streep (“The Devil Wears 
Prada”), Johnny Depp (“Pirates of 
the Caribbean”) and Emily Blunt 
(“The Adjustment Bureau”), “Into 
the Woods” features a strong, star-
studded cast. For two actors mak-
ing the technical jump, there’s no 
better place to be.

“I think Rob really set the tone 

in the beginning. You know, he’s a 
director that comes from the the-
ater world so he recognized the 
importance and the real luxury 
of having a month of rehearsal 
before you ever show your wares 
to the public. And he made sure to 
build that in,” Pine said. “And even 
though, all of us, we didn’t get a 
chance to work with everyone, we 
did get a chance in that month to 
see one another and to see what 
everybody was doing. And I think 
that really helped infuse the proj-
ect with a sense of community and 
that we’re all kind of on the same 
page. And I think you’ll hopefully 
feel that great feeling in the film.”

“What the fuck have I done?” 

This sentiment echoes like a 
heartbeat 
through 
the 
first 

scenes of “Wild,” based on the 
bestselling memoir, as inexpe-
rienced hiker Cheryl Strayed 
(Reese Witherspoon, “Mud”) 
begins 
her 

1,100 mile jour-
ney 
to 
emo-

tional recovery 
on the Pacific 
Crest 
Trail. 

Strayed’s pain 
is 
introduced 

even 
before 

she is, through 
the groans of 
agony that come from a black 
screen, leading to an image of 
her torn-up feet due to hiking 
hundreds of miles in ill-fitting 
boots. Though she loses her 
boots, she continues to walk 
through both her emotional and 
physical pain. 

As Strayed first sets out on 

the trail, the audience is forced 
to play connect-the-dots with 
jagged flashbacks to put togeth-
er the course of events that 
led her there. Though she has 
recently endured a divorce with 
her ex-husband Paul (Thomas 
Sadoski, 
“The 
Newsroom”), 

the true tragedy of her life is 
the death of her mother (Laura 

Dern, “Enlightened”), whose 
optimistic and curious spirit is 
introduced in dreamy but short 
scenes. After losing her mother, 
whom she describes as “the love 
of my life,” Strayed embarked on 
a rampage of self-destruction, 
including the heroin use and 
promiscuity that result in her 
divorce and odyssey on the PCT. 

Some of the most anxiety-

provoking scenes come not from 
the life-threatening conditions 
or rattlesnakes, but from the 
sole idea of a woman hiking 
alone for 94 days. A naïve and 
inexperienced hiker, Strayed 
often relies on the kindness of 
strangers for rides, food and 
encouragement in ways that 
her male hiking counterparts 
cannot. 
However, 
the 
dou-

ble-edged sword of this help 
rears an ugly head in the form 
of unwanted attention from 
severely creepy male hunters. 
Later when Strayed meets with 
fellow hikers, they dub her “The 
Queen of PCT,” because strange 
men are always willing to help 
her. Strayed’s weary smile at 
this supposed “gift” forces the 
audience to look deeper into 
the fist-clenching nervousness 
felt whenever she is alone and 
confronted by a man on the 
trail. The irony is that while 
these men perceive women like 
Strayed as blessed to receive 
favors and male attention, there 

is always an underlying danger 
present that they do not recog-
nize.

Witherspoon’s portrayal of 

the emotionally distant Strayed 
is authentic and well-done, but 
could have used more assistance 
from the supporting characters. 
Unsurprisingly, the film’s most 
touching moments come from 
her interactions with her moth-
er and her brutally honest best 
friend Aimee (Gaby Hoffmann, 
“Obvious Child”). Her exchang-
es with them show who Strayed 
was before her life went to hell, 
and why an audience should 
care that she finds her way back. 
When trapped in the confines 
of her own internal monologue, 
Strayed can become almost 
intolerably 
self-aggrandizing 

and pretentious. But in between 
eye-roll-provoking 
proclama-

tions of “how wild it all is,” 
Strayed proves herself to be 
funny, self-reliant and strong. 

Directed beautifully by Jean-

Marc Vallée, the film alternates 
between long shots of the harsh 
but stunning wilderness and 
close-ups 
of 
Witherspoon’s 

grimy, makeup-free face. He 
grounds the narrative well, as 
a love story between a mother 
and a daughter. Strayed walks 
her way to being the woman 
that her mother raised, letting 
the audience experience the les-
sons learned with each footstep.

Behind Enemy Lines: Richard Pitino

By JAKE LOURIM 

Managing Sports Editor

The Big Ten added another 

young name to its list of top 
college basketball coaches in 
2013 when Minnesota hired 
Richard 
Pitino.

Pitino 

spent 
two years 
working 
as 
an 

assistant 
to his dad, Rick, at Louisville 
from 2010 to 2012. The elder 
Pitino has reached seven Final 
Fours and won two national 
championships 
during 
stops 

at Providence, Kentucky and 
Louisville.

After 
a 
year 
at 
Florida 

International in 2012-13, the 
younger Pitino missed the NCAA 
Tournament in his first year at 
Minnesota but won the NIT.

In some ways, his defensive 

style resembles his dad’s with 
its full-court pressure. Last 
season, Michigan beat Pitino’s 
Minnesota team twice — 63-60 
in both teams’ Big Ten opener 
in Minneapolis, and 66-56 on 
March 1 at Crisler Center. In 
the latter game, the Wolverines 
clinched a share of the Big Ten 
title, while the Golden Gophers 
dropped 
to 
7-10, 
severely 

hurting their chances of earning 
an at-large bid to the NCAA 
Tournament.

The Daily sat down with 

Pitino at Big Ten Media Day in 
October to discuss the coach’s 
outlook on the season after 
winning the NIT championship.

The 
Michigan 
Daily: 

Last year, it seemed like your 
team played with a little bit 
of a chip on its shoulder going 
into the NIT and getting the 
championship. How does that 
translate into this season?

Richard Pitino: The beauty 

of winning the NIT is, when 
you 
make 
the 
NIT 
you’re 

obviously very close to making 

the NCAA Tournament. That 
means you missed out on the 
NCAA Tournament. So you’re 
disappointed. But then, what 
I was proud of was our guys 
regrouped, didn’t feel sorry for 
themselves and then corrected 
all the mistakes that kept us out 
of the tournament. Our defense 
got better, our rebounding got 
better, we cut our turnovers 
down — all those things I think 
they learned from, and we 
were really playing our best 
basketball at the end. So there’s 
a lot to be learned from winning 
the NIT, and there’s a lot to be 
proud of, certainly.

TMD: You won your last 

game, which not a lot of teams 
get to do. Does that, maybe even 
rather than losing early in the 
NCAA Tournament, does that 
bring more confidence into this 

year?

RP: It’s all how everything 

is 
perceived. 

It’s 
all 
how 

the 
media 

perceives 
it 

and the fans 
perceive 
it. 

We 
certainly 

understand 
that. What I 
liked 
(was) 

we played a 
really 
good 

game 
versus 

SMU (in the 
title game). You can win some 
games, and you don’t play really 
well. I thought our guys played 
a very good team, a very well-
coached team in SMU, and they 
performed. That was nice to see, 
and I think our guys are proud 
of it, and they’re excited to build 

off of it.

TMD: Mid-season last year, 

you 
played 

four 
top-15 

teams and split 
those 
games. 

When 
you’re 

a team with 
postseason 
aspirations 
like you are, 
how tough is 
that schedule 
when you run 
into a stretch 
like that?

RP: It’s funny, because you 

do these press conferences and 
the media implies that, ‘Oh, you 
got three tough games by then.’ 
There’s no easy games in the 
Big Ten. You’ve got 18 of them. 
I don’t even look at the schedule, 
I really don’t. I couldn’t tell 

you who we open up against 
because I don’t want to have 
that anxiety. I want to sleep at 
night. Because there’s not one 
easy win. I remember our first 
win — Ben Johnson, who’s my 
assistant coach, turned to me 
because he’s been in the league 
lately, he said, ‘It’s a win in the 
Big Ten. That’s all you need to be 
happy about.’ And certainly we 
understand that.

TMD: Michigan won in your 

building to start last Big Ten 
season, then down the stretch 
beat Minnesota at Crisler. Is that 
something that enters into your 
mind at all going into the season?

RP: No, I try to forget about 

that. 
(Laughs.) 
Michigan 

certainly is a very good team. 
I thought we actually played a 
much better game at their place 
last year — I thought we played 

pretty well, if I can remember. 
Certainly they’re a very good 
team. (Beilein) does a great job. 
I don’t know if we play them 
twice this year, but when that 
time comes, we’ll address it.

TMD: 
You 
lost 
Austin 

(Hollins), but you’ve got Andre 
(Hollins) back. Is he stepping up 
as a leader for you?

RP: 
Yeah, 
absolutely. 
I 

haven’t decided captains or 
anything like that, but if there’s 
a clear-cut guy, it’s him. He’s 
focused, he’s stepped up, he’s in 
great shape, he’s healthy, which 
is huge, and if there’s a leader on 
this team, it’s Andre Hollins.

TMD: 
You’ve 
also 
got 

DeAndre (Mathieu) — it’s got 
to be nice to have two senior 
guards in that backcourt.

RP: It is. Our guys last year, 

DeAndre had never been through 
the Big Ten. He had never 
played major minutes in a major 
college program before. (Drake 
transfer) Joey King was in the 
Missouri Valley, so he goes up a 
conference. Mo Walker lost 75 
pounds. Elliott (Eliason) hardly 
played. So we had guys who may 
have appeared older, but they 
were very, very inexperienced. 
It’s not that way anymore, so 
now they understand what needs 
to be done. Now it’s a matter of 
doing it.

TMD: Finally, you talked 

this morning about a little bit of 
the full-court press and a little 
bit of the running game. Are 
those some things you hope to 
implement more this season as 
you kind of get into your systems 
more?

RP: 
I 
think 
it 
was 

implemented, 
it 
wasn’t 

implemented as well as I like 
it to be implemented. In my 
opinion, like any system that 
you do, right or wrong, you’ve 
got to recruit to it. So we bring 
in a couple of guys this year, I 
think they fit that, and I think 
we’re going to continue to move 
in that direction and hopefully 
get stronger every single year.

‘M’ hosts Minnesota in pivotal series

Wolverines, Golden 
Gophers battle at 
Yost for early Big 

Ten edge

By ERIN LENNON 

Daily Sports Editor

In September, the six Big 

Ten hockey coaches gathered at 
Joe Louis Arena and cast votes 
to 
predict 

how 
the 

conference’s 
second season 
would 
shake 

out. 
Not 

surprisingly, 
preseason 
rankings listed 
Minnesota 
— which lost 
to 
Union 
in 

the 
National 

Championship 
last 
season 

— 
on 
top, 

followed 
by 

Michigan and 
a young Wisconsin squad.

Now, three months later, 

with the Badgers limping into 
the new year at 2-11-1, it seems 
this three-team race will come 
down to the two facing off at 
Yost Ice Arena this weekend.

While it’s only early January, 

when 
the 
Wolverines 
take 

on No. 8 Minnesota in their 
first series of 2015, the results 
will likely play a major role 
in determining the Big Ten 
champion come March.

“We talked about it a little 

bit this week, how hard it is 
to win (in Minneapolis),” said 
junior forward Andrew Copp. 
“There’s some added pressure 
on winning the weekend here, 
for sure, and then trying to steal 
some points up there.

“I think everyone in our 

locker room knows, not just for 
the Big Ten but for the Pairwise 
(Rankings) too, we’re in a 
pretty good spot if we win the 
weekend.”

The 
reigning 
Big 
Ten 

champion, Minnesota (1-0-1 Big 
Ten, 10-5-1 overall) currently 
occupies fourth place in the 

conference standings, having 
earned a win and a tie in its only 
Big Ten series against Michigan 
State.

Though the Wolverines will 

have the upper hand at even 
strength — Michigan boasts 
the No. 5 offense in the country, 
scoring 3.65 goals per game — 
the Golden Gophers will be even 
tougher to beat if the game is 
decided by special teams.

Minnesota 
has 
converted 

on 30 percent of its power-play 
opportunities this season, good 
for second-best in the nation. 
Four players — forwards Kyle 
Rau, 
Connor 
Reilly, 
Justin 

Kloos and Travis Boyd — have 
combined for 14 of the Gophers’ 
18 power-play goals, heading 
the lethal unit.

Both teams will also benefit 

from the return of key players 
who participated in the 2014-15 
World Junior Championships in 
Canada.

Minnesota forwards Ryan 

Collins and Hudson Fasching 
returned to the team following 
the 
United 
States’ 
loss 
to 

Russia in the quarterfinals. 
The Russians also sent Swedish 
forward Leon Bristedt back to 
Minneapolis after the semifinal 
round.

And though they managed 

two 
wins 
and 
a 
Great 

Lakes Invitational title, the 
Wolverines managed just four 
goals in the tournament without 
three of their top six forwards 
and 
their 
offensive-minded 

defenseman in freshman Zach 
Werenski. The offense will 
welcome the return of freshman 
Dylan Larkin — who scored 
seven points, including a team-
leading five goals in four games 
— as well as sophomores JT 
Compher and Tyler Motte.

Larkin will return to his 

position at center on the second 
line, flanked by sophomore Alex 
Kile and senior Zach Hyman. 
Kile and Hyman skated on the 
top line with Copp during the 
GLI and stood out as the most 
productive 
trio 
during 
the 

tournament.

Still, the versatility the three 

displayed in those two games 
means 
Berenson 
will 
have 

options should the lineup need 
changing.

Beyond conference bragging 

rights, a win over Minnesota 
would be impactful to the 
Pairwise Rankings at the end of 
the regular season.

Though Michigan bettered 

its resume with a win over 
No. 5 Michigan Tech in the 
GLI, it will need wins over its 
strongest opponents to secure 
a postseason bid. And given the 

weakness of the Big Ten, the 
Golden Gophers are the team to 
beat.

Following an MVP-worthy 

performance in net at the GLI, 
junior goaltender Steve Racine 
will likely get the start Friday 
against 
Minnesota. 
Racine 

made both losing starts against 
the first-ranked Golden Gophers 
in Minneapolis last season, but 
sophomore 
netminder 
Zach 

Nagelvoort secured the starting 
position by March, when the 
Wolverines 
split 
the 
home 

series.

No matter who starts in 

net this weekend, Berenson 
reiterated that there is still a 
decision to make in practice 
each week.

“I want them to battle,” 

Berenson said. “I told coach 
(Josh Blackburn) to tell them 
that this job is wide open. We 
need a goalie to step forward 
and earn the right to be our 
starting goalie.”

Still, Racine has been off 

ice for the better part of the 
last two weeks, and he, like 
the rest of his teammates, will 
have a tough first opponent in 
Minnesota.

“I don’t know if playing (the 

Golden Gophers) is nice or not,” 
Berenson said. “I’ll tell you after 
the weekend.”

Behind Enemy 
Lines: Cait Craft

By JACOB GASE 

Daily Sports Writer

For the second time in a week, 

the Michigan women’s basket-
ball team will be looking to use a 
home rivalry game to build some 
momentum in the Big Ten.

Just 

seven days 
after 
a 

thrilling 
nine-point 
victory 
over then-
No. 
24 

Michigan State, the Wolverines 
welcome another rival to Crisler 
Center in Sunday’s matchup with 
Ohio State.

The Buckeyes, who finished 

last season with a 5-11 conference 
record, come to Ann Arbor with 
three Big Ten victories and an 11-5 
overall record. Their most impres-
sive victory, an 85-68 rout over 
No. 24 Rutgers in Columbus, came 
against an opponent that beat 
Michigan by 13 on Wednesday.

The Wolverines (2-2 Big Ten, 

10-5 overall) nearly pulled off the 
upset in Piscataway, at one point 
eliminating a 19-point deficit to 
tie the score midway through the 
second half. But Michigan ulti-
mately dropped the game, 81-68.

The 
Wolverines 
will 
face 

a similar defensive challenge 
on Sunday. Ohio State’s roster 
features two guards scoring 
over 20 points per game: fresh-
man Kelsey Mitchell and junior 
Ameryst Alston. Mitchell has 
averaged 25.7 points, more than 
any other player in the country.

Along with Alston, junior 

guard Cait Craft is one of two 
upperclassmen in the Ohio State 
starting lineup. Through three 
seasons in Columbus, Craft has 
endured a coaching change — 
coach Kevin McGuff is in just his 
second year — and become a role 
model for a young team on the 
rise.

The Daily sat down with Craft 

at Big Ten Media Day in October 
to discuss her role in the pro-
gram, her team’s young talent, 

and of course, her brother Aaron, 
the former Buckeye basketball 
star.

The Michigan Daily: What’s 

it been like playing for an up-and-
coming program with a second-
year coach?

Cait Craft: It has been differ-

ent. The whole style is different 
here from my first year at Ohio 
State, but I definitely like it a lot 
better. I think it fits our team bet-
ter. Especially with the recruits 
they brought in, his style of play 
fits our team better than the old 
style of play I was once a part of. 
It is different, but I think every-
body has adapted to the change. 
We have such a young team that 
this style of play is all they know, 
so it’s really not a transformation 
for them at all.

TMD: Playing guard at Ohio 

State, I’m sure you get asked a lot 
of questions about your brother 
Aaron. How do you feel about 
your parallel stories, and do you 
think it’s cool or annoying to be 
asked about?

CC: It’s cool to be compared to 

him. Personally, I think Aaron is 
one of the best people that I know. 
To be compared to him as a play-
er and a person, honestly, to me, 
it’s a huge blessing and an honor. 
Certain people get annoying — 
certain people ask questions I 
really don’t have answers for. But 
it is nice to have him. Now that 
he’s gone, it’s kind of awkward for 
me, honestly. I haven’t adjusted 
to it very well yet, it’s different. 
It’s weird not having him.

TMD: Now that Aaron has 

graduated, are you excited at the 
opportunity to make your own 
name for yourself without being 
tied to your brother?

CC: I am. Around campus, it’s 

like you should just introduce 
yourself as, “Hey, I play basket-
ball,” or, “Hey, I’m Aaron’s sister,” 
because that’s all people see. Peo-
ple don’t really know just me as 
myself. In that respect, it’s kind 
of nice to be my own person now, 
not, “Oh, you’re still just Aaron’s 
sister.” As nice as that is, I like to 
be known for me.
