President wants to
find replacement
with "due speed"
By PETER SHAHIN
Daily Staff Reporter
With University Provost Philip
Hanlon set to leave the University
to become the president of Dart-
mouth College, University Presi-
dent Mary Sue Coleman said the
search for an interim provost is in
its beginning phase.
Despite his appointment, Han-
lon is scheduled to continue his
position as provost until mid-2013,
but said last week that he may take
some time offbefore beginninghis
new job at Dartmouth.
"It's a terrific opportunity and
it's a great place for me," Hanlon
said last week. "But you know
it's a bittersweet move because
Michigan is also a great place and
I'll miss our campus for sure."
In the past 50 years, only one
provost - Teresa Sullivan, Han-

Ion's predecessor and current
University of Virginia president
- was appointed as provost from
outside the University. When
Sullivan was selected as the
president of the University of Vir-
ginia, Coleman, without an offi-
cial search committee, selected
Hanlon as the University's next
provost within two weeks of Sul-
livan's announcement.
At the time, Hanlon was the
vice provost for academic and
budgetary affairs and also a can-
didate to become vice chancellor
and provost at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Hanlon's candidacy at UNC cre-
ated the impetus for Coleman's
rapid decision.
Though Coleman wouldn't
say definitively whether she
would take such decisive action
in replacing Hanlon, she said in
an interview with the Michigan
Daily on Monday no search com-
mittee for his replacement has
been formed.
"I obviously haven't known

care has improved
in new facility
By MOLLY BLOCK

Families and University of
Michigan Health System staff
topped a large evergreen in the

hospital lobby with a gold star at
the Christmas tree lighting festi-
val on Tuesday, held to celebrate
the anniversary of the C.S. Mott
Children's and Von Voigtlander
Women's Hospital's first year of
operation in its new building.
This milestone commemo-
rates the completion of the
$754-million space for UMHS
faculty, patients and families.
Chris Dickinson, the hospital's

interim executive director, said
he has watched the expansion
of the hospital systems over the
past two decades.
"Personally, I've been work-
ing here as a pediatrician since
1984, and it's just nice to see the
building, the programs asso-
ciated with the building, the
people and more importantly
the patients and families really
be happy with a first class job,"

Dickinson said.
Since the hospital moved to
the new building, 32 physicians
in nine pediatric specialties
were hired and the nursing staff
increased by 23 percent, accord-
ing to a UMHS press release.
Additionally, the new building is
unique in that it houses the chil-
dren's and women's care facilities

Daily Staff Reporter
In an effort to increase the
global impact of University stu-
dents, Central Student Govern-
ment has created "Take UM

Abroad," a new program that will
award five $1,000 scholarships
to students studying abroad next
semester.
LSA freshman Nicole Mott,
the program's director, called the
program a method of "stamping
your 'M' on the globe."
"A lot of times students go
abroad and they think, 'Oh, what
am I goingto bring back from my
trip?"' Mott said. "And this kind
of does the opposite, which is,
'What can I bring to my experi-
ence? ... How can I literally bring

the spirit and passion of being a
Michigan Wolverine abroad?"'
Take UM Abroad will cost
slightly more than $5,000 when
the costs of marketing are
accounted for and the funds will
be provided through the execu-
tive discretionary fund, accord-
ing to CSG President Manish
Parikh, a Business senior. He
added that money from the

Gilad: Jewish
state needs a
strong Palestinian
partner for peace
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
Daily StaffReporter'
Potential peace negotiations
and the ongoing conflicts in
the Middle East were the main
topics of discourse when Roey
Gilad, the consulate general of

Israel to the Midwest, visited
the University and delivered a
special address to about 25 stu-
dents at the University's Hillel
on Tuesday.
The majority of Gilad's
address focused on the effects
of the'Arab Spring on the state
of Israel and the possibility
of peace agreements between
the Palestinians and Israel, in
which he emphasized the need
for a two-state solution.
Gilad said the conflicts in
the Middle East over the past
two years highlight that mak-

log peace with the Palestinians
is not the only issue that Israel
must deal with at this time.
"If we thought that the Mid-
dle East was an unstable place
before, I think now we know
the real meaning of instability,"
Gilad said of the recent con-
flicts.
After the recent engagement
between Israel and Hamas,
Gilad noted that the future of
a ceasefire between Israel and
the militant organization that
is classified as a terrorist group

Students 'live in a yellow submarine'

If you break out singing the
Beatles' "Yellow Submarine"
during a meeting of the Universi-
ty's Human Powered Submarine
tram, prepare for some backlash.
With 22 active members, the
HPS team is constantly in the
process of building, modifying
and testing a single-person, ped-
al-powered submarine. The sub
is used to compete against teams
from around the world at the
annual International Submarine
Races, and yes, it's yellow.
Engineering junior Jeremy
Werner, the team's design man-
ager, said he initially joined in
order to become certified in
scuba diving and learn how to
pilot a submarine.

"How could I resist?" Werner
said.
Werner said the team has
become increasingly competitive
over the past few years.
"We have won fifth place and
innovation awards in the past
two competitions," Werner said.
"This year we have increased our
team's size remarkably, and we
are taking on much more design
work than ever before."
Dedication and effort are inte-
gral to the club's success, with
team -leaders working on the
submarine for between six and
10 hours a week.
The time commitment, how-
ever, is not all work and no play.
Werner said team members

enjoy scuba diving, testing the
submarine in the University's
Marine Hydrodynamic Labora-
tory and competing with peers
from other teams and institu-
tions.
"We are part of a handful of
people who get to scuba dive in
the MHL, and seeing the sub-
marine doing runs in the model
basin is the most fun you can
have out of bed," Wernuer said.
"Then comes the competition,
where we get to meet students
from around the world, share our
designs with them, and then race
our submarine against theirs."

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
Official: Enough
cash to get Detroit
through Dec.
A top Detroit financial official
says.the city has enough cash in
the pipeline to make it through
December but says a money
crunch could hit in the first quar-
ter of 2013.
William Andrews is Detroit's
program management director,
a post created under a deal with
Michigan to head off a state finan-
cial takeover.
He told reporters Tuesday that
Detroit "will get through Decem-
ber." Mayor Dave Bing has warned
that the city treasury could run
dry soon.
Andrews says the first three
months of 2013 will be critical and
says the city will have to lay off
some workers to save cash.
Officials say Detroit faces a
shortage of up to $47 million by
June 30, a figure that could grow
as Detroit deals with unfunded
pension obligations.
ATLANTA
Scare prompts
carbon monoxide
detector discussion
It's odorless, colorless and
deadly. And if carbon monoxide is
leaking in a school, it might not be
detected until people are ill.
A leak at an Atlanta elemen-
tar school that sent 42 students
and seven adults to hospitals
had school officials considering
whether to install carbon monox-
ide detectors, a possibly life-sav-
ing move that is only required in a
handful of states.
The detectors are not required
in schools by law in Georgia and
other states. Connecticut requires
them in schools, while Maryland
requires them in newly built and
remodeled schools. Building codes
and local rules can require them
in schools elsewhere. When prop-
erly installed, the detectors give a
warning when carbon monoxide
reaches unsafe levels.

China kills 14
A fire in a clothing factory
apparently caused by arson killed
14 people in southern China on
Tuesday, officials and state media
said.
The 14 were killed and one
other person was seriously injured
in the fire, which broke out at 3:30
p.m. in Shantou cityin Guangdong
province and was put out in half
an hour, the provincial emergency
department said on its microblog.
The Nanfang Daily said 84 fire-
fighters battled the blaze.
The Southern Metropolis Daily
said in an online report that the

victims were all women aged
18-20.
It said the cause of the fire
was arson, according to an initial
police and fire investigation.
LONDON
UK downplays
economic sanctions
against Israel
British Foreign Secretary Wil-
liam Hague has' downplayed the
possibility of European economic
sanctions against Israel for its
latest settlement-building plans,
saying there is "no enthusiasm
around the European Union" for
such measures.
Asked in Parliament about
whether Britain would put some
economic muscle behind its con-
demnations of Israel, Hague said
that imposing sanctions is not the
U.K.'s approach. He added he does
not believe "there would be any-
where near a consensus" on the
issue in Europe.
Hague said Tuesday that Brit-
ain will continue to try to bring
both sides back into peace talks,
and consider what further dip-
lomatic steps European coun-
tries can take if Israeli settlement
building continues.

U.N. chief rejects
warming doubts

Ban Ki-moon:
countries should
take leadership.
DOHA, Qatar (AP) - Point-
ing to the destruction caused
by Hurricane Sandy and other
weather disasters this year,
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-
moon told an international cli-
mate conference Tuesday that
it was time to "prove wrong"
those who still have doubts
about global warming.
Ban, addressing delegates
at the annual U.N. climate
talks, said time is running out
for governments to act, citing
recent reports showing rising
emissions of greenhousengases,
which most scientists say are
causing the warming trend.
"The abnormal is the new,
normal," Ban told environment
ministers and climate officials
from nearly 200 countries.
"This year we have seen Man-
hattan and Beijing under water,
hundreds of thousands of peo-
ple washed from their homes
in Colombia, Peru, the Philip-
pines, Australia."
"The danger signs are all
around," he said, noting that ice
caps are melting, permafrost
thawing and sea levels rising.
Delegates at the two-week
talks that are set to end Friday

are discussing future emis-
sions cuts and climate aid to
poor countries, issues that rich
nations and the developing
world have struggled to agree
on for years.
In Doha, developing coun-
tries have criticized richer
nations for not promising high-
er emissions cuts and notgiving
any firm commitments on how
they plan to scale up climate aid
to $100 billion by 2020, a pledge
they made three years ago.
Ban told reporters after his
speech that richer countries,
including the U.S., "should take
leadership" on climate change
because they have the resourc-
es and technology to address
the problem.
On Tuesday, Britain
announced two initiatives to
support renewable energy in
Africa and awater management
program that it said would help
18 million poor people become
more resilient to climate
change. The initiatives, total-
ing 133 million pounds ($214
million) over the next three
years, were welcomed by cli-
mate activists.
"At last, a developed country
has finally made a pledge for
future climate finance here in
Doha," Oxfam Climate Change
Policy Advisor Tracy Carty
said, but noted that the details
remain "hazy."

100,000 Egyptians protest
o utside presidential palace

Newly united
opposition rallies
against leader
CAIRO (AP) - More than
100,000 Egyptians protested
outside the presidential palace
in Cairo on Tuesday, fueling
tensions over Islamist leader
Mohammed Morsi's seizure of
nearly unrestricted powers and
the adoption by his allies of a
controversial draft constitution.
The outpouring of anger
across the Egyptian capital, the
Mediterranean port of Alexan-
dria and a string of other cities
pointed to a prolonged stand-
off between the president and a
newly united opposition.
Morsi's opponents, long frac-
tured by bickering and compet-
ing egos, have been re-energized
since he announced decrees
last month that place him above
oversight of any kind, includ-
ing by the courts, and provide
immunity to two key bodies
dominated by his allies: The
100-member panel drafting the
constitution and parliament's
upper chamber.
The decrees have led to charg-
es that Morsi's powers turned
him into a "new pharaoh."
The large turnout in Tues-
day's protests - dubbed "The
Last Warning" by organizers
- signaled sustained momen-
tum for the opposition, which
brought out at least 200,000 pro-
testers to Cairo's Tahrir Square
a week ago and a compara-

ble number on Friday to demand
that Morsi rescind the decrees.
The huge scale of the protests
have dealt a blow to the legiti-
macy of the new constitution,
which Morsi's opponents con-
tend allows religious authorities
too much influence over legisla-
tion, threatens to restrict free-
dom of expression and opens
the door to Islamist control over
day-to-day life.
What the revived opposition
has yet to make clear is what it
will do next: campaign for a'no"
vote on the draft constitution in
a nationwide referendum set for
Dec. 15, or call on Egyptians to
boycott the vote.
Already, the country's power-
ful judges have said they will not
take on their customary role of
overseeingthe vote, thus robbing
it of much of its legitimacy.
Morsi was in the presidential
palace conducting business as
usual as the protesters gathered
outside. Heleft for home through
a back door as the crowds contin-
ued to swell, according to a pres-
idential official who spoke on
condition of anonymity because
he was not authorized to speak
to the media.
The official said Morsi left on
the advice of security officials to
head off "possible dangers" and
to calm the protesters. Morsi's
spokesman, however, said the
president left the palace at the
end of his normal work day,
through the door he routinely
uses.
The protest was peaceful
except for a brief outburst when

police used tear gas to prevent
demonstrators from removing
a barricade topped with barbed
wire and converging on the pal-
ace.
Soon after, with the presi-
dent gone, the police abandoned
their lines and the protesters
surged ahead to reach the pal-
ace walls. But there were no
attempts to storm the palace,
guarded inside by the army's
Republican Guard.
Protesters also comman-
deered two police vans, climb-
ing atop the armored vehicles
to jubilantly wave Egypt's red,
white and black flag and chant
against Morsi. The protesters
later mingled freely with the
black-clad riot police, as more
and more people flocked to the
area to join the demonstration.
The protesters covered most
of the palace walls with anti-
Morsi graffiti and waved giant
banners carrying images of
revolutionaries killed in ear-
lier protests. "Down with the
regime" and "No to Morsi," they
wrote on the walls.
"He isn't the president of all
Egyptians, only of the Muslim
Brotherhood," said protester
Mariam Metwally, a postgradu-
ate student of international law.
"We don't feel like he is our
president."
A giant poster emblazoned
with an image of Morsi wearing
a Pharaonic crown was hoisted
between two street light posts
outside the presidential palace.
"Down with the president. No
to the constitution," it declared.

Typhoon kills at least
74 in the Phillippines

Rain accumulated
in mountain spills
into valley, flooding
emergence shelters
MANILA, Philippines (AP) -
At least 43 villagers and soldiers
drowned in a southern Philippine
town Tuesday when torrents
of water dumped by a powerful
typhoon cascaded down a moun-
tain, engulfing emergency shel-
ters and an army truck, officials
said. The deaths raised the toll
from one of the strongest storms
to hit the country this year to at
least 74.
Gov. Arturo Uy said rain from
Typhoon Bopha accumulated
atop a mountain and then burst
down on Andap village in New
Bataan town in hard-hit Com-
postela Valley province. The vic-
tims included villagers who had
fled from their homes to a school
and village hall, which were then
swamped by the flash flood. An
army truck carrying soldiers
and villagers was washed away,
according to Uy and army offi-
cials.
"They thought that they were
already secure in a safe area, but
they didn't know the torrents of
water would go their way," Uy
told DZBB radio.
He said the confirmed death
toll in the town was likely to
rise because several other bod-
ies could not immediately be
retrieved from floodwaters
strewn with huge logs and debris.

Bopha slammed into Davao
Orientalprovinceregionatdawn,
its ferocious winds ripping roofs
from homes and its 500-kilome-
ter (310-mile) -wide rain band
floodinglow-lying farmland.
The storm, packing winds
of 140 kilometers (87 miles) per
hour and gusts of up to 170 kph
(106 mph), toppled trees, trig-
gered landslides and sent flash
floods surging across the region's
mountains and valleys.
Two entire provinces lost
power and more than 100 domes-
tic flights were canceled. About
60,000 people fled to emergency
shelters.
Twenty-three people drowned
or were pinned by fallen trees or
collapsed houses in Davao Ori-
ental province's coastal town
of Cateel, which had the most
deaths after New Bataan, Davao
Oriental Gov. Corazon Malany-
aon told the ABS-CBN TV net-
work, citing police reports.
Some towns in the province
were so battered that no roofs
remained on buildings, Malany-
aon said.
The other deaths included
three children who were buried
by a wall of mud and boulders
that plunged down a mountain
in Marapat village, also in Com-
postela Valley. Their bodies were
wrapped in blankets by their

Mayor says LA port strike
to go to federal mediation

Representatives
have mixed
feelings going into
negotiations
LOS ANGELES (AP) - As
cargo ships idled in the harbor
or headed elsewhere, nego-
tiators prepared Tuesday to
return to the bargaining table
with a federal mediator to try
to end a costly, eight-day strike
that has all but shut down the
nation's busiest port complex.
About 44 percent of all cargo
arriving in the U.S. by sea pass-
es through the twin ports of
Los Angeles and Long Beach,
accounting for an estimated $1
billion a day in merchandise.
However, since hundreds of
clerical workers went on strike,
and thousands of dockworkers
refused to cross their picket
lines, most of that cargo has
languished on docks, rail cars
or ships.
"There's a billion-dollar
impact to a work stoppage of
this nature. It's an impact we
cannot sustain," Los Angeles
Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa
said outside the harbor com-
munity center where negotia-
tions have been held.
In the distance, giant cranes
used to unload ships stood
motionless.
Villaraigosa had emerged
from an overnight negoti-

ating session at the center
to announce both sides had
agreed to call in the mediator,
who was expected to arrive by
Tuesday evening.
The mayor said he was
optimistic that an agreement
could be reached within hours,
explaining he had seen signifi-
cant progress in the bargaining.
Representatives of both sides
did not seem to share his enthu-
siasm.
"If it's close to any agreement,
it's what kind of bagels we're
going to bring in for breakfast,"
said Steve Getzug of the Los
Angeles/Long Beach Harbor
Employers Association, which
is representing management.
Union spokesman Craig Mer-
rilees did agree with Villaraigo-
sa that significant progress had
been made.
"But more remains to be
done, particularly around the
details of a plan to end the out-
sourcing of good jobs from the
harbor area .communities," he
said.
Union leaders maintain that
management wants to save
money by outsourcing clerical
jobs to places like China and
Taiwan, where it can pay half
the money for the same work.
The result, they say, would be
one more American sector tak-
ing an economic hit just to boost
a giant company's profit mar-
gins.
Management maintains it
won't outsource any jobs, but it

wants more flexibility for hiring
future employees so it doesn't
have to pay people to fill slots
that aren't needed. It contends
the union wants "featherbed-
ding" contract language requir-
ing artificial staffing levels.
While management says
it is willing to offer lifetime
job security to all currently
employed port clerks, the union
says it wants to ensure that
future generations don't lose out
on well-paying jobs that could
go overseas or to less labor-
friendly states where workers
could be forced to take drastic
wage reductions.
The union says average cler-
ical salaries are $41 an hour,
or about $87,000 a year. When
benefits are factored in, that
raises annual compensation to
$165,000, Getzug said.
After more than two years
of unsuccessful contract nego-
tiations, about 400 of the 600
members of the local Interna-
tional Longshore and Ware-
house Union clerical workers
unit walked off their jobs last
week. They shut down 10 of
the ports' 14 terminals when
10,000 dockworkers, who are
members of their sister union,
refused to cross picket lines.
The clerks handle such tasks
as filing invoices and billing
notices, arranging dock vis-
its by customs inspectors, and
ensuring that cargo moves off
the dock quickly and gets where
it's supposed to go.

State-run exchanges provide perfect competition
Michigan House subcommittee voted down a bill that would
create a state-run health insurance exchange on Nov. 29. With
a Dec.14 compliance deadline quickly approaching, Gov. Rick
Snyder will be forced to give up hopes of a bipartisan agreement on
a state-run exchange and instead allow partial federal control of the
state's health insurance exchange which is part of President Barack
Obama's healthcare reform, the Affordable Care Act. Though the
Michigan legislature - and the legislatures of other states - may not
agree with the Affordable Care Act, politics shouldn't come before
practicality as the state proceeds. The insurance exchange provides
citizens with detailed knowledge of health care offerings and fosters
an environment of competition between insurance providers.

NOTABL.E QUOTABLE
I happen to think that the implications of
expanding the conference ... are significant
academic matters, and I was personally
very disappointed when I heard
it on the radio."
- Prof. Edie Goldenberg said about the expansion of the Big Ten Conference.
Goldenberg is a member of the Advisory Board on Intercollegiate Athletics,
which was not consulted about the changes to the conference.
The death ofsocial serendipity

The exchange will provide Michigan resi-
dents with an aggregated source of informa-
tion for comparing the offerings of insurance
companies, as well as giving residents the
means to shop for their health care plans
online in a single location. The stipulations
set by the healthcare law not only give states
the opportunity to propose their own insur-
ance exchange programs, but also establishes
a forum in which consumers can easily com-
pare all available insurance options. Though
Republicans have traditionally argued in
favor of state rights, their opposition to the
state-run health care exchange undermined
their own goals, forcing snyder to allow fed-
eral intervention. Furthermore, state Republi-
cans have also belied their alleged support of
"free market principles," since the insurance
exchanges create competitive marketplaces.
Granted, the state-run exchanges are inex-
tricably linked to the Affordable Care Act,
which Republicans oppose on the grounds that
it places government strictures on a private
healthcare enterprise. Howeverrecent reports
by the Department of Health and Human Ser-
vices show that more than a third of Americans
could be denied coverage based on pre-existing

conditions without the expansive action of the
ACA. Previous opposition to federal control of
health care asserted that government insur-
ance mandates could worsen adverse selection,
whereby young, low-risk individuals abstain
from buying insurance until they get sick, con-
sequently increasing costs for the entire insur-
ance pool. But the ACA's verdict to require all
eligible individuals to purchase an insurance
plan mitigates this problem by including all
Americans in the risk pool. It's a practical way
to allow private insurers to remain financially
productive without denying coverage to mil-
lions of Americans who need it.
Before the presidential election, state
Republicans justified their opposition to
insurance exchanges with statements such
as the claim from State Rep. Chuck Moss
(R-Birmingham) that the law was "iffy in the
courts and possibly going to be repudiated in
the next election." Going forward, the debate
regarding state implementation of insurance
exchanges should operate independently of
legislative opposition. The exchanges are the
most diplomatic way to afford fair and equal
coverage to Michigan residents and should
be unilaterally supported.

W hatever happened to
social serendipity?
I can't help but ask
myself this ques-
tion every time A
I stand outside
a lecture hall or
classroom wait-
ing for my class
to begin. Many
days, just out of
curiosity, I like MICHAEL
to take off my
headphones, put SPAETH
my phone in my
pocket and look
at the faces of the students around.
me to see if anyone would be recep-
tive to a conversation if I started
one. Nearly every time, the students
are reading textbooks, listening to
music or checking a screen. Or, even
when a few students aren't doing
any of those things, it only takes
less than a minute for cell phones to
suddenly materialize in their hands
once again.
Of course, it's completely under-
standable that we don't always
want to strike up conversations
with strangers. But it really is
remarkable how quickly we turn
to technology for companionship
when there's even the briefest lull
in our daily lives.
It makes me wonder what it must
have been like for college students
to wait for classes before cell phones
and the Internet were invented -
which wasn't all thatlong ago, bythe
way. Even if these students weren't
more willing to introduce them-
selves to their peers than we are now,
they had fewer excuses to remain
silent. Now, nobody sees anything
wrong with the fast clicking of keys
and the soft taps of fingers on touch
screens filling the hallways instead
of the sound of strangers striking up
a conversation.

So is modern technology killing
social serendipity?
Some would argue that technol-
ogy is actually increasing serendip-
ity, which is defined as "an aptitude
for making desirable discoveries
by accident." Our Facebook friends
frequently share random pho-
tos, videos, links and articles that
intrigue us or make us laugh. When
we browse news websites, we come
across interesting articles on the
sidebar that we didn't initially
intend to find. Perhaps most nota-
bly, there's StumbleUpon, which
takes users to random websites.
The problem is, although we
often find unexpected things on
the Internet, we find them on web-
sites that we regularly visit or from
people we already know. In short,
it's serendipity enclosed in a bubble
of familiarity. We discover a funny
YouTube clip ... from a best friend.
on Facebook. We find a breaking
news story ... on a website we visit
multiple times a day. Even Stumble-
Upon isn't completely random: "It
uses your stated preferences - and,
optionally, those of your friends."
The opportunities to have face-
to-face interactions with unfa-
miliar people and the unexpected
discoveries that result from those
interactions are what make life -so
interesting and exciting. They're
also some of the main reasons why
we spend so much money to go to
college in the first place.
Yes, the University offers a great
education, but Coursera and other
free massive online open courses
that are taught by professors from
some of the nation's best universi-
ties, including ours, may offer a
comparable education someday.
Some people are even question-
ing whether a college education
is necessary in the first place, cit-
ing the success stories of college

dropouts Mark Zuckerberg and
Steve Jobs. As The New York Times
recently observed, "The idea that a
college diploma is an all-but-man-
datory ticket to a successful career
is showing fissures."
Technology
leaves no room
for chance
encounters.
But one of the most important
benefits of a college education is the
social connections we develop dur-
ing our time on campus. You might
decide to go to a professor's office
hours one day and that professor
becomes an influential mentor who
can also give you their colleagues's
contact information to help you
achieve your long-term goals. You
might meet a student in lecture who
is involved with a student organiza-
tionthatintriguesyou, andyoumight
decide to major inthatsubject area as
a result. You might meet a student in
the dining hall who happens to have
the same interests and eventually
becomes your husband or wife.
These are the personal rela-
tionships that are difficult to find
online. They happen when we put
the phones and laptops away, take
a chance on someone new and are
pleasantly surprised. College pres-
ents us with these chance encoun-
ters - this potential for social
serendipity - during our daily
routines. Now we just have to take
advantage of the opportunities.

KELSEY TROTTA I VIEWP NT
A 'conscience' that can kill

Seek out summer opportunities

On Oct. 28, a woman in Ireland died after
being denied life saving medical treatment.
Savita Halappanavar was 17 weeks pregnant
when she checked into University Hospital
Galway for back pain. The doctors determined
that she was miscarrying. As a result, her cer-
vix fully dilated and she leaked amniotic fluid
for three days, causing her excruciating pain
and leaving her vulnerable to infection. Halap-
panavar and her husband begged doctors to
remove the fetus in order to save her life, but
they refused, because abortions are illegal in
Ireland. Despite protesting that she was nei-
ther Irish nor Catholic, she was denied the
procedure. After three days, the fetal heart-
beat stopped, and the fetus was removed. A few
days later, Halappanavar died of septicemia, an
often fatal form of blood poisoning. An autop-
sy confirmed that the infection was detected
while she was still alive.
Constitutionally speaking, Halappana-
var had a right to this operation because the
pregnancy was life threatening. Or, in theory
she did. In reality, the stigma associated with
these procedures, even to save someone's life,
often prevents them from being aviable option.
Instead, women take drastic measures, includ-
ing travelling abroad to obtain treatment or
undergoing illegal operations at the risk of
infertility and death.
Giving a woman a life-saving procedure
despite one's personal beliefs has been done
before. In 2009, Sister Margaret McBride,
a nun on the board of an Arizona hospital,
allowed a woman to receive a life-saving abor-
tion procedure after learning that the woman
would die if she were denied it. McBride was
temporarily excommunicated from the Cath-
olic Church, but the hospital maintains that
saving the woman's life was the right thing to
do. Sadly, there was no advocate like McBride
for Halappanavar.
It's hard to understand how letting a woman
die protects the sanctity of life. Because Halap-
panavar miscarried, there was no way the fetus

could have survived. Even if she hadn't miscar-
ried, a 17-week old fetus couldn't have lived out-
side of the womb. Any trained physician would
know this. If the doctors knew these facts and
refused'to act, wouldn't they be culpable for her
death? If so, wouldn't it make sense that they
should atcthe very least be disbarred from prac-
ticing in order to prevent another death?
It's unsettling to hear of cases like this
because they demonstrate what can happen
if we allow health care providers the right to
deny patients medically necessary treatment
on religious grounds. Though this may seem
far-fetched, something like this could happen
in the United States. Several states, including
Michigan, have enacted conscience clauses.
These clauses would allow health care pro-
viders to withhold medical treatment with
immunity from malpractice, meaning that if
a doctor denies a patient treatment on their
moral grounds and something goes wrong, the
doctor can't be sued for malpractice.
This concept raises an important ques-
tion: Is withholding medical treatment really
worth the ramifications? If a doctor couldn't
live with the idea of prescribing a woman the
pill for medical reasons, how could they live
with the fact that their "conscience" could
kill someone? Furthermore, if we allow the
providers to invoke the conscience clause
without consequences, what is to stop them
from denying a patient other life-saving pro-
cedures such as an appendectomy or a blood
transfusion on "moral grounds"?
According to her husband, Halappanavar
was overjoyed to be pregnant. Sadly, she will
never be a mother. Because she was denied a
medical procedure, a husband has lost his wife,
parents have lost their daughter and an inno-
cent woman is dead.I can only hope that health
care providers take this into consideration
before denying another person a procedure
because of their conscience.

December hardly feels like
the ideal time to be making
summer plans - who has
time for that in
between finals
and booking last-
minute flights
home? But if you
dream of landing
a coveted intern-
ship in some big
city, now might MARY
be the time to GALLAGHER
start thinking
about how you'll
be spending those four months.
A common choice, especially for
students right after their freshman
year of college, is spending the sum-
mer at home - getting a job, prob-
ably going on a family vacation for
a week or two. There's a reason why
this option is so popular among stu-
dents, of course - living at home can
save you a lot of money. And if you're
working, then you'll have a head
start on rent for the next year.
There's also the appeal of recon-
necting with friends from high
school, watching TV in your base-
ment and enjoying meals that
involve more effort than microwav-
ing a Cup-a-Soup. Most of us justify
the decision to spend four months
on the couch by hatching elaborate
plans for productivity: We'll learn
to cook! We'll learn the clarinet!
We'll write, direct and star in a stage
adaptation of "Old Gregg: The Musi-
cal!" We'll get the band back togeth-
er and tour Canada!
But if we're really honest with
ourselves, how many Spanish-Eng-
lish dictionaries lay neglected on the

bookshelf as their owners browse
Reddit? How many sequels to Mac-
beth really make it past the first few
pages? The unfortunate fact is that
without at least some constructed
time, it's easyto let the long summer
days slip past with nothing to show
for those days. There's definitely
something to be said for marathon
viewings of "Arrested Develop-
ment" and day-long strategizing
over games of the Lord of the Rings
or Risk (please invite me), but those
are pleasures probably best taken
one day or week at a time. After four
months, it can get to be a little much,
and then you're stuck in Spanish
class again trying to think of some-
thing to write about how you spent
your summer.
Fortunately, there's a huge vari-
ety of other options out there just
waiting for you to take advantage
of them. It feels a little premature
to talk about summer plans when
we've hardly even seen a real snow-
fall, but the fact is that many of
the coolest summer opportunities
available have deadlines that are
fast approaching. If you're thinking
of branching out of your hometown
this summer, I'd recommend going
to get information about concen-
tration-relevant internships from a
department adviser or trusted fac-
ulty member.
The scary - and exciting - thing
about spending the summer alone in
a new place is that it really is all on
you for the first time. Without your
family, friends and the enormous
support system that we benefit from
at the University, the world is yours
to figure out. That's a terrifying

and exhilarating moment, one that
sometimes seems best to leave until
commencement. But why wait until
then? In my opinion, a few months
spent in the "real world" is a far
better learning experience than a
semester's worth of summer classes,
and you'll come back with an insight
into how your studies will (or won't)
help you when you graduate.
A few months
spent in the 'real
world' can add to
your education.
All in all, spending at least part
of the summer out of your comfort
zone can only benefit your overall
college experience, and will defi-
nitely help you better prepare for
life after college. That's why I think
that you should take a risk this sum-
mer and do something that makes
you feel scared, something you feel
barely capable of doing. The worst
that could happen is that you screw
it up and grow as a person. Opportu-
nities are popping up left and right,
in your e-mail and on billboards in
Angell Hall: Now is the time to go
for it. Unless you're applying to the
same internships as I am, that is. In
that case, back off and get back to
playing Halo on your mom's couch.

said. "We believe there is a better
way to activate Michigan Stadi-
um for a race of this magnitude,
one that includes greater poten-
tial to raise money for charities
who were involved with CFC."
Champions for Charity is
legally a for-profit limited liabil-
ity company, though Highfield
said a majority of the money goes
to various charities and is used to
pay a small staff, with a minimal
surplus.
"It's a small little mom-and-
pop kind of business," Highfield
said.
Champions for Charity has
raised more than $3.5 million
over six years, with the help
of more than 1,000 volunteers,
Michigan athletic teams and
administrators, such as Univer-
sity Provost Philip Hanlon and
Timothy Slottow, the Universi-
ty's chief financial officer. Regis-
trants pay a fee ranging from $32
to $39, along with a $3.25 pro-

rently governs the Gaza Strip is
reliant on the prevention of the
rearmament of Hamas.
"If we succeed, the ceasefire
will be longer," Gilad said. "If we
should not succeed, unfortunately
the ceasefire will be short."
Gilad went on to say that
though there are many problems
plaguing peace agreements, he
believes stronger Palestinian
leadership will ultimately lead
to a two-state solution in which
the nations can each make con-

cessions for the greater good.
He added that the recent move
by the United Nations to recog-
nize Palestine as a non-member
observer state was not helpful in
these negotiations from Israel's
perspective.
"I strongly believe that this
(two-state solution) ... can be
achieved, should be achieved,
but again, the answer to achiev-
ing this is in Ramallah, not in
this political circus at the United
Nations," Gilad said, referring to
the current administrative capi,

tion to that to really bring U of M
with them on their trip," she said.
While the program is only
funded for the Winter 2013 semes-
ter, Parikh said its success or fail-
ure could determine whether or
not it becomes institutionalized.
Mott, who helped create the
program as a CSG intern, is reflec-
tive of the success of the newly
revived CSG interns program.
Parikh said in years past there
had been an intern program with
what was then called the Michi-
gan Student Assembly.
"I think the emphasis of the
(former) interns program - if
there was one and whatever
capacity it was - was to get
members.
Champions for Charity pays
the Athletic Department to rent
the stadium. In the event's first
year in 2006, Highfield said it
paid about $2,500 to the depart-
ment, then run by former athlet-
ic director Bill Martin. This year,
the department quoted a fig-
ure of $15,800 to rent the space
before it was cancelled.
Highfield acknowledged the
role the Athletic Department has
played in the event.
"We know the extraordinary
race finish has always been
dependent on UM Athletics
allowing access to the stadium,"
she wrote in the e-mail to sup-
porters. "Priorities do change
with administration changes."
This week, the Athletic
Department announced a part-
-nership with Special Olyp-
mics Michigan, though Ablauf
said the deal did not affect the
department's relationship with
Champions for Charity.
"That's just one of many rela-
tionships that we have or plan
to have in the future with other
organizations," Ablauf said of
the Special Olympics. "I think
people are making alot out of our
relationship with Special Olym-
pics right now as the reason, and
they're a great organization, one
that we want to be involved with,
but it's not the overriding reason
why we we've made this deci-
sion."
Ablauf also noted that Michi-
gan Stadium will still be avail-
able for other charitable events,
and that the department will
continue to work with local non-
profit groups that have benefited
from the race.
Until the Friday meeting,
Highfield said Champions for
Charity received no indica-
tion the race would not go on as
tal of the Palestinian National
Authority in the West Bank.
Gilad also responded to the
recent decision by Israel to con-
struct 3,000 homes in West Bank
settlements and East Jerusa-
lem - a decision that has led to
criticism from the United States
and formal protests from sev-
eral European nations. Gilad said
Israel has no intention of moving
back to the 1967 border estab-
lished when Israel captured the
Gaza Strip and the West Bank
from Jordan and Egypt during
the Six-Day War.
"I think the problem is that
while there is aswish and aswill to

go for the two-state solution that
will eventually be a very signifi-
cant Israeli pull-back from Gaza
and from the West Bank," Gilad
said. "No Israeli prime minister
is willing to take the chance that
they will stay in the settlements
and something bad will happen."
At the end of the discussion,
Gilad said any possible agree-
ments reached between the
parties will have to be formed
through respect or fear.

fee, print things," Parikh said.
"This interns program is like
grooming and blooming things on
campus."
Mott said she has not fetched
a single cup of coffee as an intern
and that she doesn't see that hap-
pening in the future.
"I think being an intern
involves a lot of things. Yes, there
are the practical kinds of menial
tasks that you have to do," she
said. "(Parikh) and the rest of the

interns) to learn skills ... the skills

planned. On Nov. 20, Champi-
ons for Charity sent an e-mail
to its committee heads stating
that they had agreed on a tenta-
tive date of April 14, but that date
could not be formally announced
until they received final approval
from the Athletic Department.
Highfield said she thought
"the reason for the meeting on
Friday was to get a final go-
ahead." Instead, she met for a
short time with Chrissi Rawak,
the senior associate athletic
director for development and
Rob Rademacher, the associate
athletic director of facilities and
operations, who informed her of
the cancellation, she said. They
said the decision came after a
six-to-12-month examination of
the Athletic Department's chari-
table endeavors, which sought to
streamline those efforts, accord-
ing to Highfield.
"I'm not saying I don't believe
it," Highfield said. "I believe
that. It's just, what I said to them
was I can't imagine anything
more charitable than this event.
And they said that's just not the
direction we decided to go."
Champions for Charity is cur-
rently exploring holding the
event away from Michigan Stadi-
um, calling it the Big Heart run.
Volunteers and registrants have
reacted to the cancellation with
confusion.
"I think we're all just not get-
ting it," said Carole Dubritsky,
assistant director of the Uni-
versity's Office of Institutional
Equality, who has volunteered
for the run. "I guess some of
us who were volunteering
don't understand how one race,
when Champions for Charity
says they're willing to pay for
everything like the rental of the
stadium, ... why it's such a big
deal."
president ofI-LEAD, a pro-Israe-
li group on campus - said Gilad
offered an optimistic view of the
future between the two feuding
parties, which is much different
from what she believes the media
tends to portray.
"It's always good to hear the
facts from the person who's
working with it first-hand,"
Rosen said.
LSA sophomore Michelle
Freed seconded Rosen's senti-
ments, adding that people can
get conflicting information from
many different sources today
and that all of the information
can be easily misconstrued.

"It's really nice to hear from
someone who's really involved in
the political happenings," Freed
said. "Having somebody who's
really knowledgeable and being
able to ask and answer questions
is really beneficial."
LSA junior Andrew Lieber-
man said he attended because he
wanted to see what such a high-.
ranking Jewish official would
say about the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict.
"I really enjoyed whathe had to
say, his insight," Lieberman said.
"He's a really incredible source."

said.
"The fact that we have been
able to keep the women's hospi-
tal in the children's hospital, that
doesn't happen a lot," Dickinson
said. "Most places, if you are a sick
mom or a healthy mom with a sick
baby, you are cared for in two dif-
ferent buildings and there needs
to be a transfer after delivery and
that doesn't need to happen."
The building has a 12-story
inpatient wing and a 9-story
outpatient wing that includes 16
operating rooms, two interven-
tional radiology rooms, a pediat-
ric emergency room and a Ronald
McDonald house facility. There
are 348 private rooms equipped
with food orderingecapabilities, as
well as Internet and movies.
"The biggest change has been
individual private rooms with
space dedicated for a family mem-
ber," Dickinson said. "It provides
a comfortable place to sleep and
there is not another baby waking
them up across the room."
He added that the flat screen
televisions in patient rooms have
been popular among patients and

very long time, but I'm obviously
working on it and it's very impor-
tant for the University, and I will
try to do it with all due speed,"
Coleman said. "He will be here
though until the end of this next
semester, so there's time."
Coleman added: "Every search
is really unique and one of the
things I have been proud about
at the University is that we are
developing leaders all the time."
The next provost will likely
face a perennially difficultbudget
situation and lead the University
in deciding the role of informa-
tion technology in the classroom,
among a variety of other issues,
Coleman said.
"This whole issue of how tech-
nology is both enriching experi-
ences, the experience of students

their families and create a more
welcoming environment for new
parents.
"Kids and parents enjoy the on-
demand movies on the big, flat-
panel TV screens in the rooms,"
Dickinson said. "Even the neo-
natal intensive care unit has big
screen TVs. ESPN is the number
one viewed (channel). You see
dads more engaged in care as well
as moms."
Richard Ohye, the head of
the Pediatric Cardiac Surgery
Division, said the new building
has had a significant impact on
patient care.
"We built the whole hospi-
tal with them in mind and it has
made a really big difference for
our patients and their families,"
Ohye said. "From a day-to-day
operating standpoint it hasn't
changed all that much, but it's
made a huge difference for my
program overall and my patients."
One successful program
housed in the new facility is the
C.S. Mott's Pediatrics Cardiol-
ogy and Heart Surgery Division,
ranked fourth by U.S. News and
World Report on the magazine's
2013 best hospitals list.
"Overall, it's been really suc-
cessful as far as from my pro-
and the challenges it brings,"
Coleman said. "There are continu-
ing challenges of affordability and
the investments we make in the
University thatkeep us atthe front
ranks and all of those are going to
be continuing challenges."
Dean of Libraries Paul Cou-
rant, who served as provost
between 2002 and 2005, said in
a January 2010 interview that
there is no "norm" for searching
for a University provost.
"Not uncommonly, a presi-
dent will look around, consult
with some people and make an
appointment of somebody who
is here and ready to do the job,"
Courant said.
Coleman echoed that senti-
ment Monday, noting that each
search is unique and there is no
standard operating procedure in
the case of finding a new provost.
"I think that we just consider
each situation independently and

gram, pediatric cardiovascular
surgery," Ohye said. "The abil-
ity to all be together in one area,
both the surgeons and the cardi-
ologists, (has) been really great in
helping patient care for difficult,
complex cases or talking about
research and education."
While the state-of-the-art
bedrooms entice patients, the
building's architecture is envi-
ronmentally friendly and features
reduced carbon dioxide emis-
sions, efficient toilets, rainwater
storage for site irrigation and a
LEED Silver certification.
Dickinson said the one-year
anniversary is intended to cel-
ebrate successful patient care in
the new building, which facili-
tates medical breakthroughs and
miracles on a daily basis.
"Almost every day here there
is a 'wow moment' where we do
something really remarkable for
a child or a mom that just doesn't
happen everywhere around
the 'country," Dickinson said.
"We tend to take it for granted
because we have a lot of really
great doctors, nurses and other
staff that work here every day to
make that happen. I'm just very
happy and proud to be part of
that."
we'll see what happens," Cole-
man said.
Courant also cited the vice pro-
vost as a candidate that naturally
transitions into provost either at
the University or another school.
The current vice provost is Mar-
thaPollack, who has also served as
Deanofthe School of Information.
"It's not uncommon for people
to roll from that position to a pro-
vost position here or elsewhere,"
Courant said.
Beside the search for the inter-
im provost, Coleman and Hanlon
are also overseeing the search
committees for replacemhent deans
for the College of LSA, the School
of Dentistry, the Law School and
the Libraries. Coleman said the
Law School search is the farthest
along, but added it is unlikely that
she will announce her choice at
the December meeting of the Uni-
versity's Board of-Regents which
is scheduled for December-13.

UMGASS to bring fairy
tale 'Iolanthe' on stage

By TEHREEM SAJJAD
Daily Arts Writer
Magic, fairies and forbidden
love: This year, the University of
Michigan Gilbert and Sullivan
Society brings
all the drama Iolanthe
and comedy
of fairyland Thursday,
onto the stage Friday and
with their Saturday at 8
production of' p.m., Saturday
"Iolanthe." and Sunday
"Iolanthe" at 2 p.m.
attempts to Lydia Mendelssohn
blend the fruit- Theate
ful person-
alities of the Ftsm $10
classic fantasy
world creature, fairies, with
members of the British parlia-
ment. Though on the surface
"Iolanthe" seems to be a play
about a crowd of misguided fair-
ies, its fantasy aspect is an eye-
opener into reality.
The play commences with
the fairies mourning the anni-
versary of Iolanthe's exile, a
fairy that committed the crime
of marrying a human 25 years
prior. When the Fairy Queen is
convinced to pardon Iolanthe,
the banished fairy is brought
back with her son, Strephon. It's
soon revealed that Strephon is in
love with Phyllis, the ward of the

Lord Chancellor. Unfortunately,
the Chancellor forbids Strephon
from marrying Phyllis because
of his low rank. When Phyllis
asks for Iolanthe's help, things
begin to look up for not only
Strephon, but all of fairyland as
well.
For Robyn Tierney, artistic
director of the production, this
will be her first UMGASS show.
"We wanted to focus more on
some of the previous produc-
tions that we've seen and that
have gotten good reviews," she
said. "We really wanted to make
this silly. We wanted to embrace
the comedic elements of it. We
have some funny characters and
we have very good characteriza-
tion of the actors - we really
dove into further characteriza-
tion and the personalities that
Gilbert and Sullivan have writ-
ten."
UMGASS is the oldest stu-
dent-run organization devoted
to operettas of Sir William Gil-
bert and Sir Arthur Sullivan. It
serves as a pedestal for theater
students and a creative outlet for
community members who are
devoted to the theater.
The cast consists of Univer-
sity students and community
members, Tierney explained.
"So, we have a nice blend -
younger students all the way up

to the golden age community
members - many of which are
faculty at the school. We have a
very nice variety of those who
have learned the talent, vocally
as well as just stage presence. So
the cast is very diverse."
As a fantasy, "Iolanthe" is a
classic fairy tale with a tinge of
comedic reality.
"ft's very goofy, it's very silly.
It's a light-hearted comedy: defi-
nitely a comic opera," Tierney
said.
One of Gilbert
and Sullivan's
lesser-known
classics.
"('Iolanthe') is not one of Gil-
bert and Sullivan's well known
plays," Tierney concluded.
"They are known more for
'H.M.S Pinafore' and 'Pirates of
Penzance,' but this particular
production has been a really fun
experience ... you can look back
and say that it's very entertain-
ing and that the audience will
be able to sit back and enjoy the
show."

Pin the tail on the Donaghy
'30' still rocking it

NBC's hit comedy
isn't slowing down
in seventh season
By SAM CENZHANG
DailyArts Writer
"30 Rock" has long been an
institution of TV comedy. It has
become different from the "30
Rock" that
everyone was
talking about
back in 2006, 30 Rock
having basi-
cally become Season Seven
a live-action Midseason
cartoon. While Thursdays
it struggled in asdays
season six, the
problems were NBC
mostly in the
show's architecture. The writ-
ing never noticeably declined in
quality, and the frantic, joke-a-
minute rhythm was still satisfy-
ing. Those structural issues are,
if not solved, completely incon-
sequential in this farewell tour-
of a final season. While there are
some cursory nods to season-
long narrative arc, "30 Rock" just
wants to depart making us laugh
as hardlas ever.
Clips from- fake TV shows
and movies have long been a "30
Rock" highlight, and the sea-

son premiere offered these up in
spades. Ack Donaghy (Alec Bald-
win) realized that the only way to
save NBC was to tank it so badly
that the parent company would
be forced to sell it to somebody
else, greenlighting spectacularly
bad shows like "Hunchback,"
NBC's answer to sexy vampire
programming and "Homonym,"
a game show in which contes-
tants guess which of two hom-
onyms has just been said, their
answers always happening to be
the incorrect word.
While "30 Rock" isn't known
for moments of profound pathos,
it can still spin hilarity out of
character traits. The show's
treatment of Liz Lemon's (Tina
Fey) sexuality has taken some
turns more head-scratching than
funny. The idea in the second
episode of the season that she's
turned on by organization not
only makes sense given what we
know about her, but culminates
in a montage in which Liz and her
boyfriend Criss (James Marsden)
pour paper clips and white-out
on each other in an office supply
store. Given what we know about
Liz's Germanophilia, the phrase
"Dusseldorf bus schedule sex"
was particularly amusing.
In the past, the series's nods
to current events have yielded
uneven results, and the same is
true this season. The show's elec-

tion arc became bogged down
in token topicality without add-
ing all that much to the ripped-
from-the-headlines plot points. A
plotline that featured a group of
Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakows-
ki) superfans living in northern
Floridawho would determine the
election was a little too on-the-
nose, and the political satire just
wasn't particularly incisive or
absurd enoughto be funny. There
were some nice moments, par-
ticularly Lemon putting on a Bos-
ton accent somehow even worse
than Julianne Moore's when she
guest-starred, albeit intentionally
so. Ultimately, the two-episode
arc just felt clunky and thrown
together to accommodate the
need to address the election in
some capacity.
"30 Rock" has touched on the
women-in-comedy issue before,
specifically in season five's "TGS
Hates Women." The third episode
of the seventh season explicitly
takes on the question of'whether
women are funny, the impetus
for which is Tracy Jordan (Tracy
Morgan) tweeting at Stephen
Hawking, because that's just the,
kind of show "30 Rock" is now.
Liz refuses to engage until she
can't take itanymore, and she and
Jenna revive their two-woman
show to prove Tracy wrong. The
show is apparently hilarious, but
we (the viewers) don't get to see
much of it. It's a subtle reminder
that Tina Fey doesn't need to
prove to us that women are funny,
even if Lemon feels like she does.
Also, the episode featured Ryan
Lochte guest starring as a "sex
idiot." That's all that needs to be
said about that.
While the final season hasn't
been perfect, it has been a lot
closer to the original comedy in
recent seasons. Perhaps the writ-.
ers always meant to go out in a
blaze of glory, or maybe fans of
the show are just more willing to
indulge the occasional missteps,
but whatever the case, it's worth
seeing how one of the seminal sit-
coms ofthe 2000s makes its final
exit.

Grace, confusion in
Memory Tapes's latest

Translating Tagore,
his legacy at Hill

By KATIE STEEN
Daily Arts Writer
Sometimes, if you're feeling
like shit, it's better to not fight it.
Sometimes shit moods can even
sublimate into
a reasonably (3

as is the case T
with Memory
Tapes's latest Grace/
work, Grace/ Confusion
Confusion.
The album Carpark
offers a glimpse
into the inner unrest of Dayve
Hawk, the man behind Memory
Tapes, who explained in an inter-
view with MTV Hive that he felt
like a mess while working on it.
Grace/Confusion is an LP that
squirms, that quickly becomes
tired and restless if forced to stay
in one place for too long. The
shortest track is almost five min-
utes long, though, so the songs
have plenty of wiggle room. This
allows Hawk the opportunity
to twist a track into a number of
shapes, leaving listeners in a diz-
zied, giddy vertigo .by the end of
the album.
The opening track, "Neighbor-
hood Watch," starts off pretty
straightforward with a drowsy
guitar and Hawk's delightfully
androgynous vocals, but 45 sec-
onds in, shifts to a springy refrain
that remains sleek and polished
despite the change in pace. Hawk
goes back and forth between the
two personalities up until the
end, which involves a clumsy
transition into a screechy guitar
solo that tears the song apart for
no reason. It's essentially a tan-
trum - out of place and unpre-
dictable - but if messy is what
Hawk is going for, he's accom-
plished it.
Now for the Grace aspect of the
album. Hawk redeems himself

Ron Swanson once said,
"Awards are stupid. But they'd
be less stupid if they went to the
right people."
I have toyed with this perfect
ideology for years asI find myself
overly invested in an addiction to
Hollywood award shows - every
year I get excited for the awards
season, from Emmys to Oscars,
and every year I face disappoint-
ment as the voters and I disagree.
"Well, the Academy is stupid,"
my friends and I will say to each
other, as we take Amy Poehler's

ally than she did herself. Last year, I wrote a paper on
ust don't understand." how this episode doesn't try to be
a lesson in culture but immerses
the audience in Diwali celebra-
tions as if they are normal for
'arks for al everyone. Despite the mislead-
he Pronys. ing title, this episode is still about
these characters and their inter-
actions, with Kaling's brilliant
portrayal of Indian celebrations

That maybe a classic sore-loser
response, but it's the basis of Ron
F***ing Swanson's Great Awards
Epiphany. I wouldn't think the
Academy of Television Arts & Sci-
ences were stupid if they awarded
all my favorite shows, would I?
With that in mind, and with a few
too many cups of tea consumed, I
decided to create my own awards
for television shows - not just
this season, but throughout my
life. I have named them, most
humbly, the Promys.
Best Holiday Episode
"The Office," season three, epi-
sode 6, "Diwali": This is a nice way
to disclaim at the beginning of
the Promys that I am completely
and 100-percent biased. "Diwali,"
written and directed by my spirit
animal, Mindy Kaling, shows
the Dunder Mifflin gang going
to Kelly Kapoor's (Kaling) fam-
ily celebration of the Diwali, the

as vibrant background.
Most Rewatchable Episode of
Anything Ever
"Parks and Recreation," sea-
son three, episode 14, "The Fight":
The title of this award is pretty
much dooming me to dissent
from our readers, but let me make
my case. "The Fight" is a comedy
acting powerhouse. Look no fur-
ther than the montage of Paw-
nee Parks employees interacting
drunkenly with the camera crew.
Each actor has his or own spin on
the disastrous effects of Tom's
(Aziz Ansari) "Snake Juice"
liqueur, and the extra attention
on Leslie (Amy Poehler) and
Ann's (Rashida Jones) friendship
makes it the most rewatchable
episode ... especially after a night
of drinking.
Best Finale

'Avatar: The Last Airbender,"
the season three finale, "Sozin's
Comet": "Avatar" is up there in
my favorite shows, but "Sozin's
Comet" ranks at the top of my
list of finales because of just how
well the writers thought it out.
-Each part focuses on a differ-
ent aspect of the battle against
Ozai (Mark Hamill), including
Aang's (Zach Tyler Eisen) inter-
nal struggle about possibly hav-
ing to take someone's life. The
best scene may be when Azula
(Grey DeLisle) becomes com-
pletely unhinged before a spec-
tacular final firebending duel
with Zuko (Dante Basco). Unlike
"The Fight," I can only watch
this episode sparingly because it
takes too much to cope with its
awesomeness.
Those are the three I came
up with on the spot, but the Pro-
mys list goes on. I won't impose
the rest on this world - yet -
because we have real awards
shows to disagree with. The
point, I realized, isn't who does
or doesn't win a gold statue from
some abstract group of alleg-
edly impressive individuals. The
point is that someone, some-
where appreciates this show,
character or actor for its work.
Someone thinks the award went
to the right person, which makes
it a little less stupid.

Michigan transition
too fast for Broncos

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Writer
With a little more than three
minutes left in the first half and
the Maize Rage counting down
the ticking seconds left on the shot
clock, Trey Burke tried creating
space for himself, going first to his
left and then to his right.
Five. Four. Three.
Fresh-
man guard WMU 41
Caris LeVert MICHIGAN 73
stood alone
at the top of the key, so Burke
passed to him, and out of despera-
tion, LeVert heaved up the first
shot of his career, barely beating
the buzzer.
Swish.
Moments later, the situation
repeated itself, this time with
freshman guard Nik Stauskas
launching the shot with the clock
winding down. And after drawing
an offensive foul on the other end,
another freshman, forward Mitch
McGary, finished an easy layup,
capping a 15-2 Wolverine run to
give No. 3 Michigan an 18-point
advantage after another sluggish
start to a game.
After each team scored just one
field goal - both 3-pointers - in
the second half's first four min-
utes, the Wolverines pulled away
with an 11-2 run to extend their
lead to 23, and hung on to win eas-
ily, 73-41, over Western Michigan.
In the second half, the Broncos
(6-2) couldn't keep up. Michigan's
decisiverunbeganwith Stauskas's
second 3-pointer of the half and
was punctuated by back-to-back
and-1s from freshman forward
Glenn Robinson III and Burke.
Burke led all scorers with 20
points - two short of his season
high - and also dished out seven
assists. Perhaps more impressive-
ly, he finished with no turnovers,
while recording three steals.
"He's got an edge of toughness
and a pace to him that he under-
stands when we need him to do
more and when we need him to
just find these good shooters we
have around him," said Michigan
coach John Beilein.
Added Burke: "(The Broncos)
were giving me the elbow jump
shot, and that's the shot that I've
been working on with Coach
(LaVall Jordan). He told me that
that shot would be there. Once
they started taking that away,
that's when I would start kicking

it out."
After Burke, Michigan (8-0)
relied on a wealth of diverse scor-
ing options, including 18 points
from the bench. Just two other
players - Stauskas (11 points) and
McGary (10) - scored in double
figures, with Stauskas knocking
down 3-of-4 of his 3-pointers.
Junior guard Tim Hardaway, Jr.
and Robinson each struggled to
find the bottom of the net, shoot-
ing a combined 6-for-20. But on
this night, it didn't matter as 'M'
outscored - Western Michigan,
38-19, in the second half.
"It's good to rotate everyone
in there, because you never know
who we're going to need at what
point in the season," said redshirt
junior Jordan Morgan. "We've got
to have that 'next man up' mental-
ity as Coach (Jordan) says, where
the next guy's ready to step up and
fill in. It is refreshing to be able to
play whoever and they come in
and get the job done."
Despite 10 first-half points from
Burke, Michigan failed early on
to do what it had done so well for
much of the season. The Wolver-
ines shot just 3-of-10 from 3-point
range in the opening stanza and
were outrebounded, 16-12. The
Broncos trailed by 14 at the half,
35-21, thanks largely to five first-
half offensive boards that helped
keep them within reach.
"If you looked at our faces inthe
first 10 minutes, we did not predict
that outcome," Beilein said. "The
ball was flying around. They've
got a great scheme that they're
running and they ran it with such
speed and precision (that) our
heads were spinning."
But in the second half, Michi-
gan improved on both statistics,
shooting 5-for-11 from 3-point
land to finish with a 38.1 percent
mark and winning the overall
rebounding battle, 35-31.
Forward Darius Paul was the
only Bronco to score in double fig-
ures, finishing with just 10 points.
Though 10 Western Michigan
players scored, the team shot just
28.1 percent from the field, made
just 2-of-17 3-pointers and turned
the ball over 18 times, leadingto 22
Michigan points.
NOTES: Redshirt freshman
forward Max Bielfeldt sprained
his ankle during practice on Tues-
day and missed Wednesday's
game. His status is uncertain for
Saturday's game against Arkan-
sas.


By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Writer
Sophomore guard Trey Burke
found himself alone in Michi-
gan's offensive half of the court
multiple times on Tuesday.
Whether it be for his third career
dunk or an easy layup, he was
consistently yards away from the
nearest Bronco.
Burke and the Wolverines'
defense took advantage of West-
ern Michigan's giveaways in
Tuesday's 73-41 win. The Bron-
cos committed 13 turnovers in
the first half and 18 in total. From
shot clock violations to bad pass-
es to steals - you name it, Michi-
gan forced them all.
Though tough defense isn't
normally Michigan's strength,
the Wolverines played a full 40
minutes, forcing Western Michi-
gan to take errant shots and
force bad passes. With Burke and
redshirt junior forward Jordan
Morgan leading, No. 3 Michigan
added 22 points off of turnovers,
many times adding a dunk as an
exclamation point. For Michigan
coach John Beilein, this is a sign
of maturation on defense.
"Our fast break keyed our
first half and the second half, we
executed offense really well and
our defense was terrific," Beilein
said. "We haven't been turn-
ing people over a lot. There are
a couple of schools of thought,
when you can really block out
and defensive rebound and
defend - that's sort of a turnover
too, a bad shot with a rebound. I
do like those because usually the
turnovers are easy baskets."
Though the game didn't start
out crisply on defense - Western
Michigan held within five points
of Michigan until late in the first
half from multiple shots per pos-
session - Beilein credited turn-
overs as the deciding factor in
winning the possession battle in
the first half.
Many of the Broncos' turn-
overs were a result of great guard
play on defense.
Western Michigan was forced
to play on the perimeter and
couldn't effectively rotate the
ball to find an open man in the
paint.
The Broncos made bad pass-
es and seconds later, Burke or
another Wolverine would be on
the other end of the floor to pad
Michigan's lead.
Western Michigan coach
Steve Hawkins said that after

several failed attempts to set up
the outside game, the Broncos
would look down low for scoring
but often times forced the ball
inside, which resulted in another
turnover.
"They're able to get out in
transition because of turnovers
- some were in the variety of bad
passes and others we charged
too much," Hawkins said.
"I felt like a huge difference in
the game was guard play. Trey
Burke, Tim Hardaway, Jr., Nik
Stauskas - they can play the
game."
As the ball fell into the Wol-
verines' hands from bad passes
or ball-handling, Michigan was
easily able to go coast-to-coast
for a layup or kick it out for an
open three on the perimeter.
Burke and freshman forward
Mitch McGary recorded dunks
in transition and junior guard
Tim Hardaway, Jr. recorded
seven of his nine points in tran-
sition.
Burke scored just six of his 20
points from fast breaks, but he
was a pivotal player in almost
every transition point scored
Tuesday. Though the sophomore
guard was critical of how the
team played overall on defense,
Burke noted that the 22 points
off turnovers often started
with a good defensive stop or a
rebound.
. "The coaches, they prefer
you get steals and that's our
best offense," Burke said. "Get-
ting a steal and moving it ahead
for a fast break layup or dunk.
Stay solid on defense, make the
defense get the ball to you and
go from there. That's the key for
us, making consistent plays on
defense.
"I think our transition offense
is one of our best offenses (and)
we did a great job tonight."

After tough 2-game stretch, Wolverines play at Illinois State

By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan women's bas-
ketball team is on the road again.
After closing out a five-game
home stand on Saturday with a
59-53 win over Florida, the Wol-
verines are set to face off against
Illinois State (4-2) in Normal, Ill.
on Wednesday.
Initslasttwogames, Michigan
(6-2)-has faced its two toughest
opponents of the young season.

rally in the sec-
ond half.
After a two-day break, Michi-
gan trumped the Gators on Sat-
urday, ending its home stand
with its fourth victories in five
games.
During that stretch the Wol-
verines started senior forward
Nya Jordan in place of sopho-
more guard Brenae Harris.
Jordan has given Michigan a
much-needed rebounding pres-
ence
"I definitely think rebounding
is an issue for us," said Michigan
coach Kim Barnes Arico. "(Flor-
ida) really hurt us on the offen-
sive boards and that's probably

where they scored most of their
points, especially in the second
half.
"We need to have bigger,
stronger kids out there, and Nya
gives us that presence."
Plagued by ACL injuries, the
Wolverines are very thin at for-
ward and have constantly looked
to guards to help on the boards.
Another issue this season has
been turnovers, an area that
Michigan improved upon against
Florida.
"We had some silly turnovers,
but for the most part I think we
handled the ball pretty well,
especially late in the second
half," Barnes Arico said. "Late in
the game we did a nice job tak-
ing care of the ball. If we limit
our turnovers we limit their
transition - the strength of their
team."
With improved rebounding
and fewer turnovers, the Wol-
verines are ready to hit the road.
They will travel to face Illinois
State Wednesday.
The Red Birds features senior
guard Jamie Russell - who aver-
ages 17.3 points per game, 7.2
rebounds per game and three
steals per game - sophomore
forward Janae Smith who aver-
ages 17 points per game on
54-percent shooting and adds a
team-high eight rebounds per
game.
As if Russell and Smith
weren't lethal enough, Illinois
State also adds senior guard Can-
dace Sykes, who has emerged off
the bench to average a team-high
17.8 points per game with 5.8
rebounds per game.
With a potent Red Birds
offense, the Wolverines will

need to continue to rely on their
strong trio of seniors, guard
Jenny Ryan, center Rachel Shef-
fer and forward Kate Thompson.
In addition, the strong guard
play from Illinois State will pres-
sure the Wolverines to continue
forcing turnovers in Normal,
something the Red Birds are suc-
cessful at - they force 12.9 per
game.
In addition, the Wolverines
will look to their experience and

improved defensive presence to
match the offensive firepower of
the Red Birds.
"Our kids know you go on the
road and sometimes you have to
play in front of a hostile crowd,"
Barnes Arico said. "We've been
down this road before and (we)
know we've got to keep (our)
focus.
"It doesn't matter where we're
playing, it's about Michigan bas-
ketball."

SB - I-WW'

Honey, they've got a full line
By Zach Bergson

Name: Beth Karmeisol
Education: Masters in Public Health, University of
Michigan
Age: 43
Hometown: Metamora, Mich.
How did you get into the sex store business?
Twenty plus years ago I was doing volunteer work with
adolescents that were dying of AIDS. I saw a huge need
to establish a sex-positive environment that disseminated
consistent and correct information about sexual health in
a positive way. In addition to being a retail environment
that you can then purchase all of these products to help
keep you safe - reduce the risk of sexually transmitted
diseases and infections, and unintended pregnancies - I
wanted to promote the educational side of it.
Every single person that works for me has to be trained
and has to have a background of sexual health, women's
health or men's health that then we build upon in here.
We're not selling T-shirts: if someone comes in and buys
a T-shirt somewhere and it's not the right fit or it's not the
right color, it's no big deal. But if somebody comes in and
we sell them the wrong condom or a lubricant that's not
compatible with a condom then that's a potential risk. The
people here have to understand that sexual health and
background.
Ok, we're going to do a 180 now. What's the best start-
er toy for a couple that's never used a sex toy before?
It's hard to answer that question. I can't just pick some-
thing magically out of the air and present it. The biggest
reason for that is perception. Each couple has a comfort
'Yevel. Questions have to asked before products can be
assigned. Questions that I would address is: Are you look-
ing for a massage item, a vibrating item, are you looking
for a game? Things of that sort and then zero in accord-
ingly.
But there's no magical answer for that, because of that
perception. I can't take something off the shelf and shove
it in your face and say this is the end-all-be-all product,
because the person might look at me and say "Oh my
god, that scares the crap out of me," and they might be
too uncomfortable to tell me they're uncomfortable with
it, and feel pressure to buy. And nobody ever feels pres-
sure to buy in here, because we want the individual to be
educated about the product and then make their decision
about what is best for them.
Is there one bestselling toy that you have here?
The Lelo line, Iwill say, does really well for us, for a
-couple of different reasons. The quality of the product,
its name recognition and we're now offering all Lelo
products on sale until the end of the year.

Could yougive me some examples of the different Lelo
products?
Honey, they have a full line. From start to finish, they
have a full line of products. They start with a basic dildo
- a dildo or a dong is a product that is non-vibrating.
And then they move into internal and external products.
Vibrators, that can be used for penetrative stimulation or
k3

external stimulation of the clitoris or penis. Vaginal, anal,
cock-rings, they make a full line for everything. They have
back massagers, dual stimulators - those that stimulate
internally and externally for a female. They run from $40
to $200. A full range.
One of the coolest things that they have is a USB charged
product, so you don't have to worry about batteries. You
just plug it into your computer and go. They have remote
controlled items as well for partner play or if you want to
wear the product through town and hold the remote con-
trol, you can do that too. You never know what's going on in
those lecture halls.
I'm sure you get crazy phone calls here. What's the
weirdest call you've gotten?
The one thing that is a little irritating is when you're in the
middle of something and you get the prank- phone calls.
Yesterday we were really busy and I was working by myself,
and I had an individual call that was obviously a prank call.
Any of the prank phone calls start off really hesitant and
then they go into it, and then the person kept on asking for
sex and wouldn't stop. The funnything is that the prank
phone calls pick up when school lets out. When the parents
are away, they have nothing to do so they think it's funny to
prank us. Sometimes you do know that somebody is on the
other end pleasuring themselves and that's very uncom-
fortable, but we can usually figure it out. We just state that
that is inappropriate for this type of location, if you need
help with something you need to take of that yourself.
The categories that define sexual relations can be lim-
iting at times, what do you think the role of the Safe
Sex Store has in helping these people come to terms
with these definitions in reference to themselves?
I actuallytaught a class here to undergraduates called
Human Sexuality and Gender Issues. Gender issue is a big
deal and identity comes from within, and it's very difficult to
label somebody. My stance - it's going to sound harsh -S3
Safe Sex Store, we don't care who you or how you identify.
We want to make sure that whenever or however you identi-
fy, you're proceeding safely. That's our number one concern.
If somebody is struggling with trying to find their iden-
tity - we've worked with numerous people and counseled
them to the point where they're on the brink of suicide.
I have one particular case that this person was ready to
commit suicide and I had gone to a hotel room and met
this person, and literally talked them off the edge, because
they didn't see an out. He felt homosexual, but his outward
identity to the world was heterosexual, and he needed to
come to grips on how to come out. Today, he is an amazing,
thriving, beautiful homosexual man. It's really about build-
ing the confidence in the individual to establish their own
identity within and makingsure that they don't feel judged.

Casual encounters: Tapping into a secret sex space

letter from the editors
by dylan cinti and jennifer xu
We're very excited to present our Sex Issue. So excited, in fact,
that we went ahead and released one of the pieces - "Casual
Encounters" - online on Monday evening. Perhaps you read it:If not,
we advise you to. It's a University senior's riveting account of gay cruis-
ing in the age of Craigslist and Grindr. In the story,he describes aseries
of random hookupswith students he's met on Craigslist and other sites.
But beyond its salacious premise, the piece is an astute commentary
on the nature of intimacy when sex is as easy as, in the words of the
author, "logging on, perusing, messaging, waiting." Sites such as Craig-
slist, Grindr and Manhunt constitute an entire sexual sphere - a space
where anything goes, and where gratification is almost instantaneous.
After publishing this piece online, we were surfing around the Craig-
slist "m4m" section when an entry caught our eye: "Casual Encoun-
ters MI Daily Article." "To the guy who wrote the Casual Encounters
in the Michigan Daily article," the post read, "wanna have some fun?"
The Internet can be a terrifying place. But it is also be a place where
meaningful connections begin. And who's to say that something that
starts through Craigslist can't lead to something special? If the author
of "Casual Encounters" is reading this, there's a 6'2" stud who's inter-
ested in you. He's a successful guy with bedroom eyes, and he's looking
to "have some fun." Message him.

random student interview
by kaitlin williams / illustrations by megan mulholland

Welcome to the Random Student
Interview, where we talk about
sex for twice as long as it lasts.
OK, so we're only going to print
your first name, so be as candid
as possible. What is it, by the
way?
Westley.
Westley? That's the main charac-
ter's name from one of my favor-
ite movies, "The Princess Bride.'
"The Princess Bride" is my favorite
movie as well! Because I'm in it.
I can see that. You've even got
the flowy blonde hair going!
Sexy.
Thanks.

Oh gosh. At what point during
the coitus was this walking in
on?
Um ... this is graphic. Can I be
graphic?
Yeah! No one is going to know it's
you! It could be any Westley.
There's only a couple Westleys. I
know for a fact there's only two or
three others at this school, but it's
OK.
OK. Go on then.
We were both just naked on her
bed and she walked ... she walked
completely in the room. She didn't
knock. She walked in the room and
it wasn't a big room.
Oh. Intimate setting.
It was a cozy moment for us three.
Oh gosh, that's horrible. So, on
to better sexy topics. Another
question a lot of people ask, if
you could have sex with anyone
in the world, who would it be
and why?
Gosh, you're asking tough ques-

Q
Nice. Don't borrow Westley's
copy of "Into the Blue". OK, so
I've forgotten my other question
during all this sex talk ... So what
do you think is the weirdest sex
story you've heard?
Well, one of my friends told me
about a four-way he did with two
other guys and a girl. It was the
weirdest thing I've ever heard in
my life. It revolted me in several
ways.
Was he, like, bragging about it?
No, he was just ... I don't know!
We were talking about it at hockey
practice and he was just like, "Yeah,
we just did it because we thought
it'd be a good story." And I was like,
"that's a terrible reason!"
Yeah, I mean he could've just
made it up if he was looking for
a story. That's what everybody
else does; they pretend to have
the sex.
That's what I told him. Don't actu-
ally do that. Gosh. The details were
graphic and weird and I'm not
going to get into them so as to save
you the awkwardness.
Well, I thank you for that, and
my readership thanks you for
that. I hope you get laid this
weekend.

at are you into?
Last year, I was walking past
Pizza House at 2 a.m. when a tall,
athletic guy stumbled out and shouted "Hey,
FAG!" in my direction.
Fag. Well, sort of, I thought.
I do have sex with men. Usually it's late
at night, and usually it's with men I've met
on the Internet. I also have sex with women,
though that's a bit more complicated than
getting online, sending a few e-mails, and
dropping my pants in a stranger's bed.
"Hey, FAG!" The guy did have a point,
because less than 20 minutes later I was at a
political science major's apartment. He was
crouched in front of me on the ground, his
hands bound with a belt behind his back.
Hey man. Whatsup?
not too much. u?pretty horny... to!.
Not the most romantic of beginnings, but
this isn't about romance. It's about sex.
can you host? ineed to be super discreet if
that's ok. not out.
I could have guessed as much from the
picture he sent. Tall, dark hair, fit and wear-
ing a Michigan Football T-shirt. A college
bro who just happens to like fucking other
college bros.
Sure. You can come to my apartment.
Now, I wait. It's always nerve-wracking,
but in exciting kind of way. -I take a shot of

bad whiskey. In 15 minutes I will be face-to-
face with a guy I just met online, and a few
minutes after he will be taking off his pants.
When he gets to the door we shake hands,
which seems oddly formal. His hair looks
wet from the shower, and he smells a little too
strongly of Old Spice.
"My roommate's asleep, so try to be quiet,"
I say while leading him toward my bedroom.
He notices a glass bowl on my dresser and
says far too loudly, "You smoke weed, man?"
Yeah. I start packing a bowl. -
We make out between hits. He looks like
he's having a good time. I am, too. He starts
to fumble with my belt buckle. Finally he gets
it undone.
"Nice dick, bro."
Don't think anonymous sex between men
is some product of the digital age. It's been
around as long as locker rooms, bathroom
stalls and the CCRB sauna. But for a lot of gay
men our age, "cruising" has migrated online.
This is hook-up culture on steroids. It's easier,
more anonymous and probably safer. Estab-
lishing what you're comfortable with before-
hand is simple.
What are you into? Top or bottom? Any
kinks? FWB? I'm 4/20 friendly. m4mm. Bot-
tom for use. I want to be ridden. I want your
load. I wanna take it slow. Safe sex only. Just
looking to kiss. Just looking for kicks. I'm just
curious.
Craigslist, Adam4Adam, Grindr, Manhunt
- these are the places to meet, chat, and hook
up with other men. Any night of the week you
can find pages and pages of profiles, a good
number of them University students. Some

guys look for friends or dates, but most are
just looking to get off. A lot of students iden-
tify as either "straight" or "curious." Even
more are "discreet" about their sexualities -
in other words, closeted.
Coming out is hard to do. Responding to
"Bottom up for grabs" on Craigslist isn't. So
for the frat guy who laughs when his friends
call someone a fag but secretly wants to kiss
another man; for the freshman whose family
and politics tells him it's not OK to get off on
the gay porn he's been watching since high
school; for the guy who's confused and just
wants to try it out; for all these people, online
hookups offer the simple thing they've been
denied: release.
I'd been with a guy once in high school. In
college, I wanted to try it again, but I wasn't
comfortable with the idea of being "out" in
any sort of public setting. Somehow, I stum-
bled upon the m4m section of Craigslist. The
more people I hooked up with, the more com-
fortable I became.
This all must sound kind of seedy. But as
long as the sex is safe, consensual and plea-
surable, does it really matter how it starts?
Is getting online to look for sex any different
than goingto Rick's or Charley's?
Logging on. Perusing. Messaging. Wait-
ing...
It's another night, another guy. I pick him
up in front of his dorm around 1 a.m. After
saying hello, we both fall silent. I can tell he's
nervous.
"Have you done this sort of thing before,
with a guy?"
"Yeah. A few times."

He's hot. Dark skin, curly hair, a strong,
masculine jawline. Beneath his baggy sweat-
shirt is a toned and muscular physique.
I ask him if he's out, and his tone turns
defensive.
"No. But I'm not gay. I'm bi."
"Metoo."
It's clear he doesn't want to talk, so instead
I reach over the stick shift and put my hand
on his leg.
"Fuck," he says. "I forgot the condom."
I pull my hand away. Maybe he's nervous,
or maybe I'm just not his type.
"Oh, that's fine. We don't have to do this. I
can take you back."
But he really has forgotten the condom.
After he goes back into his dorm to get one,
we fuck in the backseat of my car, parked in
the back corner of the Music School parking
lot. As soon as his shirt comes off, he's not
anxious anymore.
But as we're driving back to his dorm, he's
silent again.
Then he asks: "Are you in a frat? You look
familiar. I think I saw you at a rushing event."
I laugh. "No. Not me."
I can't tell you how many of these hookups
I've had. I can tell you there are many more to
come. One day I'll settle down, probably with
a woman. But that day won't be anytime soon.
For the moment, it's more strangers. More
Michigan Football T-shirts. More bad whis-
key and Old Spice. There's a whole sexual
space on campus that you now know a little
about. If it's up your alley, go for it. Log on,'
peruse. Throw caution to the wind. What are
you into?

Three, according to triangles, tricycles
and charm, is the best number. Three
says "I have two others helping me
out." Three is sturdy; three is the spice of life;
three is a party.
Unfortunately, I've never mastered the art
of three. I learned to ride a bicycle when I
was 7: no third wheel required.
And yet, during my freshman year at
the University, I found myself being rudely
pushed into the designated third spot of my
friends' blossoming relationship. It started
out very innocently:
"Josh and I are going to Meijer, want to
come?" Sara would ask. I'd agree: My stock of
granola was always at a dangerous low when-
ever she asked, and, after all, there is nothing
inherently sexy about grocery shopping.
But things quickly progressed:
"Want to grab some lunch?" Josh offered
one day. I agreed, thinking it was going to be
"a quick pick-up, so it was a shock to find Sara
saving us a seat as we pulled up.
"WE'RE THE THREE BEST FRIENDS-"
Things only went downhill from there. It
wasn't that my friends had turned into the
sickeningly sweet couple no one likes, but
-when they started dating, they had unoffi-
cially agreed to be a team of two. Suddenly,
I wasn't a part of every joke, or every story,
which was fine! But to make up for time lost,

this third wheel position was created for
me, and I was forever the person they called
when they needed to get back in touch with
their mutually respective lives.
Enter Friday, September 17, 2010.
"So, Josh's housemate is throwing a party
this Friday. We're goingto dress up like cray-
ons and go!"
Protesting a party was like committing a
crime, so rather than lamely sit at home and
watch the Food Network, I put on a green
dress and accepted that this was as good as
it would get.
"This willbe fun!" was Sara's mantra. And
it was fun, until I remembered the onlythree
people I knew there were my puppy-love
friends and a girl from my biology class that
was dressed as a Teletubby.
"Listen, listen, do you think Josh really
loves me?" Sara asked throughout the night.
And there we were, the place a designated
third wheel will inevitably end up. I couldn't
even turn a blind eye and argue I hadn't
seen them together, that I wasn't a constant
in their liaison. They tricked me into being
involved, and I wasn't even looking for a rela-
tionship.
Threewas not aparty. Threywas aFriday-
night girl in a green crayon outfit, convincing

a friend her boyfriend was her one, true love.
I had to get out. Out of the conversation,
out of the third wheel, out of that party. I
searched for my room key, that beautiful,
yellow plastic beacon of hope, but came up
dmpty. And then I remembered I had left it
on my desk, my siren call receiving no answer.
Things were becoming quite bleak. It took
Sara another two hours before she decided
it was time to leave. Thankfully, Josh stayed
behind. For a while, anyway.
we meandered, held back by Sara's con-
stant stop-and-start manner of walking as
she recounted every moment of a night I had
just shared with her. As soon as we made it to
her dorm, I made a beeline for the bathroom
and then to the makeshift bed Sara set up for
me on the floor of her room in South Quad.
And then ...
I'd like to think it was a dream. Some-
times I concentrate really hard, hoping to
discover that my sleepy-mind had misun-
derstood what was happening-exagger-
ated the situation. But I'm almost 98.9%
sure that I was not dreaming when Josh
clumsily knocked on Sara's door and my
two friends began the "so, should we...ya
know?" conversation.
"Anna-is right there, Josh! We can't just-"
"She's asleep,,Sara! Come pn,,she ,wop't
know."

Sometimes things happen as a sign from
the universe. As if your entire existence can
be validated by the moment you turn on your
car and Adele's "Someone Like You" blares
through your speakers. Moments like those
are rare, beautiful unicorns.
This was not such a moment. As I furious-
ly tried to fall back into some semblance of a
peaceful sleep, Josh persevered.
"No. Josh, stop, oh gosh, this is probably a
bad idea-"
And then it happened..
I lay there, on the floor of Sara's dorm
room, while the two wanton lovers consum-
mated their relationship. Twice.
Nothing in my life had prepared me for that
moment. Nothing prepares you for a number
of situations, though, outside of the experience
itself, and most of the time, they make excel-
lent stories that you never want to tell anyone.
That morning I tiptoed out of her room,
doing the walk of shame back to Markley for
entirely different reasons than most people
thought of when they saw my shoes in hand
and disheartened stare. I never talked about
it with Sara and Josh. They broke up a couple
months later, and it all seemed entirely too
unbearable to bring up.

Wednesday, December 5, 2012 // The Statement B

When I was 16, I had a panic attack
in my high school's cafeteria
because I got the urge to push
a beautiful ballerina against the menu-
plastered bulletin board, grope her ass and'
feel her pulse under my tongue.
I shook my gaze from her tight body and
stared at the linoleum floor. Blood slipped
quickly past my ears; white-hot adrena-
line seized my corroded artery and blasted
my optical nerves. Holy shit. Holy. Shit. I
thought, stumbling over to the soup station
for a handful of oyster crackers. What if I'm
gay? My life would be so totally over.
This wasn't the first time I looked at a
woman this way. When I was little, I worried
that I was in love with an older neighbor girl
named Hope. She was a Scandinavian vari-
ety of beautiful: storm-blue eyes, billowing
blonde hair, thin buta little chesty. She might
be a dance major now, at Duke or Bard, but at
the time she lived down the street and I'd go
out of my way to see her riding a bicycle into
downtown Beulah, the little town in north-
ern Michigan where we lived. At the time,
I chalked this longing up to jealousy. Hope
was gorgeous and I probably just wanted to
be her, not be on top of her.
My feelings during the Ballerina Inci-
dent of 2009, I told myself, were no differ-
ent. After tossing back a few packs of oyster
crackers and a waxy granny smith apple,
I felt better. In fact, in no time at all, I had
convinced myself that my desire for the girl
was pure envy. After all, I'd had sex with a
bunch of men, and I was great at it. I really
like dick, I told myself. Dick is great, the great-
est. Everything is going to be OK.
So Icontinued to screw men.And yes, I real-
ly did love it. That following summer, I had my
first orgasmwhile ontop of a hairy jazz pianist
with hands the size of Frisbees. However, the
desire to bury my face between a woman's legs
continued to permeate my sexual conscious-
ness, and it only became stronger as I became
more confident as a sexual being.
I gave once-overs to women who slowly
rose, glistening and bikini-clad, from lakes
in Northern Michigan. Tipsy nights of mixed
gender Spin-the-Bottle left me inventing
complex fantasies of woman-heavy three
ways. I developed a crush on "Mad Men"
star January Jones.
By the time I got to college I was
left wondering: Was I ambisextris?
Heteroflexible? One of those attention-
hungry chicks who arrive at college deciding
to give girls a try? Was I a cry for help?
Admittedly, part of my confusion was
based on my lack of experience with women.
With men it was easy: If they hold eye
contact, assume they're interested unless
obviously gay. With women, I felt like I was
starting all over again.
I'd go to house parties in dingy basements
with black lighting and rickety beer pong
tables, and search for girls with figurative
"WSW" stamps on their foreheads. How did

accidental? Even ita girl grinded with me on
a drunken, half-lit dance floor, she could still
be straight and trying to get a man's attention.
I needed there to be a designated girl-on-girl
make-out corner, or the God of Gay Sex to
cast my sights in the right direction.
More than that, I had to prepare myself
for actually getting a girl into bed. The age
old question - What do lesbians really do in
the bedroom? - was hitting me hard. When
my friend, a playwright from New York
with the nape of her neck shaved, described
her only lesbian experience, she shrugged
her shoulders and said, "It was nice, like
a full body massage." This wasn't enough
information. I imagined purchasing suction
cup dildos and strap-ons from Amazon.
com, or wandering into the Safe Sex Store on
South University Avenue only to leave with
nothing a few minutes later.
Of course, I wasn't just worrying about the
sex. What if I found a lady soul mate on pride
night at Necto, or in an empty cafe reading
Bob Hicok and playing with her hair? Was
I gay enough to fall in love with a woman?
To come out of the closet? I thought about
joining a bisexual support group or going
to mixed-gender speed -dating, but I was
paralyzed by my own complication. Instead
I stayed home and watched "The L Word,"
trying to analyze the love scenes.
When that didn't satisfy my inquisitive
appetites, I took courses in sexuality,
thinking academia could help me figure it all
out. However, while my first sex professor,
a 70-year-old lesbian with a smoke-
lowered voice, flicked her laser pointer
over unimpressive penises on ancient
Greek statues and lectured about the Molly
House Raids, I only learned more about the
complex divides between hetero and homo.
As PowerPoint slides about Oscar Wilde
and Lady Chatterley flickered before me,
the existence of bridges between the two
sexualities seemed less and less possible.
When I read the "Symposium" a year
later, I was only more confused. Plato's the-
ory on the creation of love seemed to cast out
bisexuality altogether. Aristophanes spoke
of ancient creatures that scurried about the
earth with four legs, four arms and two sets
of genitalia. These hybrids could have been
two fused women, two fused men or a fused
man and woman. However, when the gods
decided these beings were becoming too
powerful, Zeus split them down the middle
and they became what we are today: male or
female bodies. These divided pairs then spent
their lives searching for their other halves.
The hiccupping Aristophanes went on to
say, "Those men who are halves of a being of
the common sex(es) :.. are lovers of women,
and most adulterers come from this class,
as also do women who are mad about men
and sexually promiscuous. Women who are
halves of a female whole direct their affections
towards women and pay little attention to
men; 'Lesbians' belong to this category." In

hybrid, they were attracted to their own sex;
if they came from opposite-sex hybrids, they
were what we would now call "heterosexual."
Well, great, I thought, more exclusive cat-
egories.
Later that week, my professor spoke
candidly of our doom. He said that as
descendants of these creatures who rolled
around on eight limbs, we are cursed with
a desperate need for unity. But our only
means for serious connection is sex. And sex,
according to him, is a total letdown. The act
is insufficientbecause, even if we go through
the motions of wining, dining, eye-fucking
and foreplay, the resultant sexual encounter
is short-lived - for a college kid, probably 15
minutes at best. Then, once the condom is
lying impotent on the rim of a wastebasket,
the desperation for connection begins again.
Wow, I thought, that is some poetic shit.
I completely bought into the turmoil
of it all. Human existence was chiseled
down to walking the Earth in search of our
counterparts, and on top of that, even if we
found our other halves, we could only unite
with them in a series of brief and entirely
unsatisfying sexual experiences. My little
identity problem seemed microscopic in the
face of all this eternal loneliness.
A few days later, ina cafeteria not unlike the
spot of my ballerina-induced panic attack, aboy
takingBiologyofSexmentionedthetruthabout
the anglerfish. He said that during the mating
process, a male angler literally melts into a
female's body;makingthemone organism.
"What?" I gasped, throwing a curly fry
down on my plate. "Are you for real?"
"Yeah," said the boy. "So?"
"So? So? Don't you realize this means an
anglerfish, a big ugly fish at the bottom of the
ocean with a light on its head, can achieve
the one thing that we crave more than any-
thing else?"
Of course, no one realized. Half the
table looked at me blankly. The other half
continued to discuss an upcoming Econ test
and lap at soft-serve ice cream cones.
"True connection! Like in Plato's
'Symposium,"' I said.
"Isn't the anglerfish that scary one in
'Finding Nemo?' " asked a girl.
I left a couple minutes later, huffy and
masochisticallywrapped up in the poetics of
it all. Basically, it was official: We are alone
forever, lower on the romantic totem pole than
a fish dwelling in the ocean's deepest caverns.
During my oceanographylectures, I doodled
anglers in my notebook with a black felt-tipped
pen; I considered tattooing one on my hip as
homage to the fish's superiority. But, like a lot
of trite ideas I've had - a surface piercing above
my eyebrow, a commune called The Roach
Hotel - this impulse faded with a little time.
The magic of my professor's lecture on Plato
also dwindled, and I was left with my original
question: Where does this leave me?Plato spoke.
through Aristophanes about the history of
what we now call "straight" and "gay" people.

beings with two vaginas and a penis that
could have represented me in the distant past.
My love of both sexes left me ancestor-less; I
wasn't recognized in the contemporary or
ancient world. I was just as lost as before.
It took a guy who was both my ex-boyfriend
and best friend to shake me out of the hopeless
place where I found myself. He was a product
of science, concocted from the donated sperm
of a gay man in California and the egg of his
lesbian mother. His mom raised him with
the support of many gay women, and this
upbringing made him a sort of secondary
authority on the subject of lesbian lifestyles.
"It's not penis envy," I said as I sprawled
across his dorm room futon with my head in
his lap.
He played aimlessly with the hair I briefly
considered hacking off as a neon sign of my
sexuality. "OK, then what is it?" he asked.
"Or maybe it is ... I just don't know how to
find her, you know?"
"It'll happen when it happens, Em," he
sighed.
His intonation was plain. He was gently
telling me to calm my ass down, and he was
right. I fell into a light sleep as he rolled
through reruns of "How I Met Your Mother."
My struggle seemed a bit silly after our
talk, and I wondered why I felt the need to
nail down my sexuality. I recalled the facts
of ancient Greece, where everyone was doing
everyone. My imagination recreated an
ancient text in which two women happily go
to the cobbler to buy dildos made of sheep-
skin and then return home to their husbands.
Back then no one was gay or straight, but
everyone was screwing. Maybe they had the
right idea.
Sexual preference gradually became
overrated in my eyes. As my friend intuited,
I was obsessing over labeling myself because
I wanted my attraction authenticated by
experience. I thought that if I joined queer
culture's exclusive club, I'd feel like I belonged
to a group. But why did everything have to
come down to my "interested in" section on
Facebook? If I defined myself by who I slept
with, I might let my sex life eclipse some of
my other, equally important parts.
Instead, I decided that I wouldn't broad-
cast my urges, but I wouldn't ignore Them
either. I'd figure it all out when the time came
- perhaps if I met the right girl. And with
the right girl I might not be able to merge
with penetration, but so what? The g-spot is
only an extension of the clit anyway, and the
male anglerfish literally becomes just a pair
of gonads when he painfully melts into the
female's body.
I didn't want to lose myself while seeking a
soul mate. I could be satisfied with whoever I
was with, man or woman, as long as we could
make each other come, tasting those sunbursts
that expand through the skin before rolling
onto our backs to rediscover the sky.
