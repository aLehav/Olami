To deter suicides by jumping 

or falling off of Ann Arbor 
parking structures, the Ann 
Arbor Downtown Development 
Authority 
is 
further 

committing 
to 
constructing 

more permanent fences on city 
parking 
structure 
rooftops. 

Installment of the fences began 
last fall when city officials 
noticed a pattern of attempted 
or 
successfully 
completed 

suicides by individuals jumping 
or falling off of the garages in 
the last three years.

Between 
November 
2015 

and 
December 
2016, 
three 

people died, and two were 
injured after falling or jumping 
from city parking structures. 
Other incidents occurred in 
September and October 2017, 
when two men fell from the 
South 
Fourth 
Avenue 
and 

East William Street parking 
structures. These deaths were 
ruled as suicides.

The project will be funded 

through fees charged to those 
who park their vehicles in the 
city’s structures. The DDA 
board determined in a meeting 
last week bids will be due by 
Jan. 16, and work is projected to 
be underway by the end of the 
month. 

City Councilmember Kirk 

Westphal, D-Ward 2, described 
the importance of having the 
fencing installed in the first 
place to help deter individuals 

from ending their lives.

“As 
councilmembers, 
our 

first priority is public safety,” 
Westphal said. “As an urgent 
public safety need, the opinion 
we got from mental health 
experts is that, while not full 
proof, this temporary fencing 
was a prudent strategy to help 
interrupt the determination of 
some individuals to take their 
life.”

According to Susan Pollay, 

executive 
director 
of 
the 

DDA, temporary fencing was 
installed 
on 
garages 
when 

the bid for the project cost $1 
million more than estimated. 
Contractor 
availability 
was 

also low during this time, 
leading to the more expensive 
estimates. As a result, the DDA 
board approved an installment 
of chain-link fencing on the 
structures rather than more 
permanent materials.

Pollay 
said 
city 

administrators hopes to add 
fencing to other levels within 
the parking structures, not just 
the rooftops. She also said it is 
important to install the fences 
in order to better serve the 
needs of Ann Arbor residents.

“It is perhaps most important 

to focus on the needs of people 
in our community that are not 
being met,” Pollay said.

The 
University 
Council 

convened on Monday night for 
its first biweekly meeting of 
the semester, discussing topics 
including the Office of Diversity, 
Equality, 
and 
Inclusion 
and 

changes to the academic calendar. 

The meeting opened with a 

guest speaker, the Vice Provost 
for Equity and Inclusion and 
Chief 
Diversity 
Officer 
Dr. 

Robert Sellers. Sellers touched 
on the DEI plan’s progress and 
various initiatives that have been 
implemented for the past year.

Sellers 
presented 
council 

members with the goals of DEI, 
which includes making their 
strategic plan as inclusive as 
possible, noting the diversity 
of experience students possess 
across 
various 
schools 
and 

programs on campus. There are 
currently 49 strategic unit plans, 
and 
each 
respective 
school, 

college, and campus unit has their 
own plan suited to their specific 
needs. There is also a campuswide 
strategic plan being implemented 
by DEI, aiming to promote 
collaboration across programs

As the second decade after 

9/11 approaches, the question 
of 
counterterrorism 
efforts 

remains pertinent to national 
and global discourse, from the 
rise and fall of ISIS to President 
Donald 
Trump’s 
promises 

to tighten security policies. 
Terrorism experts questioned 
this evolution of governmental 
policy Monday afternoon at 
the University of Michigan’s 
Ford School of Public Policy 
event, “Terrorism at Home and 
Abroad: Where are we 16 years 
after 9/11?”

Nicholas 
Rasmussen, 
a 

former 
State 
Department 

official and director of the 
National 
Counterterrorism 

Center, discussed his role in the 
U.S government in its efforts 
to eliminate terrorism. He was 
accompanied by John Ciorciari, 
the director of the international 
policy at the Public Policy 
School and facilitator of the 
event. 

Rasmussen first discussed 

the early stages of his work, 
especially pertaining to 9/11.

Issues of free speech on the 

University of Michigan’s campus 
this year haven’t exactly been 
fun and games, but an outside 
conservative group sought to 
change that Monday afternoon. 

Students played with and 

scribbled on a huge beach 
ball 
labeled 
“Free 
Speech” 

on the Diag, open to anyone 
and everyone who wanted to 
share their thoughts and write 
something on the ball.

Nathan Williamson, one of 

the facilitators of the event and 
a Field Representative at the 
Leadership Institute, an institute 
intending to provide training for 
conservative activists, has done 
this activity at universities all 
around Michigan in an effort to 
promote free speech on college 
campuses.

“It’s a beach ball we roll 

around campus to promote free 
speech, and we let anybody 
write whatever they want to 
on it as a practice of the First 

Amendment,” Williamson said.

In recent months, the line 

between free speech and hate 
speech has been heavily debated 
by 
University 
students 
and 

administration. In response to 
a speech by Charles Murray, a 
controversial 
social 
scientist 

who promotes a since-debunked 
relationship between race and 
IQ, last October, protests were 
organized, claiming his ideas 
were discriminatory and did 
not qualify as free speech. With 
the impending decision by the 
University as to whether or 
not white supremacist Richard 
Spencer will be given a date 
and place to speak on campus 
assuming the safety of students 
can be assured, the University 
has organizedevents during the 
winter semester to examine 
what free speech means on 
campus.

Williamson said he brought 

the beach ball to the University 
because of FIRE, — Foundation 
for 
Individual 
Rights 
and 

Education — a free speech 
watchdog 
organization

After two years of drafting, councilmembers pass measure for “proper course of action”

At the City Council meeting 

on Monday evening, council 
members passed an ordinance 
to amend city code to include a 
chapter outlining procedures 
for removal of councilmembers. 
The 
Council 
also 
honored 

Carolyn 
Grawi 
for 
her 

disability 
awareness 
efforts 

and work toward implementing 
independent living for people 
with disabilities.

According to the Council 

Internal 
Regulation 

Ordinance, cause for removal 
of a councilmember includes 
conviction of a felony, violation 
of an oath of office, repeated 
violation of council ethics or 
administrative rules, conviction 
of state criminal misconduct 
or conviction of city or state 
election laws. Upon requests for 
removal of a councilmember, the 
ordinance specifies the Council 
Administrative Committee as 
the investigative staff who must 
recommend 
the 
appropriate 

action for the request, such 
as dismissing without merit, 
scheduling a Council meeting 
or referring to a government 
or law enforcement agency. At 
least 
eight 
councilmembers 

must approve the removal of a 
councilmember based on valid 
evidence.

After two years of developing 

the chapter, the Council passed 
the ordinance unanimously.

Councilmember 
Sumi 

Kailasapathy, 
D-Ward 
1, 

emphasized how the ordinance 
is an essential and relevant 

element to the code of the 
city and enacts a system of 
checks and balances among 
councilmembers.

“I feel having (the ordinance) 

is very essential that council 
members don’t have a double 
standard,” Kailasapathy said. 
“That we too have to have code 
of conduct, ethics and our 
standards.” 

With 
council 
member 

terms increasing from two to 
four years starting next year, 
Kailasapathy also highlighted

Archaeologist laments preservation of 
famous Indian landmarks in lecture

Hosted by Center for South Asian Studies, Nyanjot Lahiri spotlights poor conservation

On Monday, the University 

of 
Michigan’s 
Center 
for 

South 
Asian 
Studies 
hosted 

Professor 
Nayanjot 
Lahiri, 
a 

historian and archaeologist, to 
discuss conservation struggles 
faced by India’s archeological 
efforts. Lahiri referenced the 
mistreatment of major Indian 
national monuments and possible 
solutions 
to 
protect 
these 

monuments and educate the 
Indian people on Indian heritage.

Lahiri studies ancient India and 

is a professor of history at Ashoka 
University. She won the 2013 
Infosys Prize and has published 
multiple books on ancient Indian 
history and archeology.

CSAS 
professor 
Thomas 

Trautmann introduced Lahiri and 
described her writing historical 
works.

“She is a wonderful writer and 

a very engaging one and notes it 
and appreciates and curates it,” 
Trautmann said.

As Lahiri took the stage, she 

referenced the Archaeological 
Survey of India which states 

there are only 3,700 nationally 
protected 
monuments, 
10,000 

monuments protected by state 
and union territories and over 
500,000 monuments in India 
left unprotected and subject to 
mistreatment.

“I think it’s necessary to 

remember that … (even though) 
a monument has been declared 
protected 
or 
just 
because 

there are lots of antiquities in 
 

different 
museums 
in 
India, 

this is not in itself enough to 
 

ensure that they will be properly 
conserved,” Lahiri said.

During 
the 
lecture, 
she 

projected images of Indian 
monuments 
harmed 
by 

human actions such as the 
Taj Mahal and the Elephanta 
Caves. She showed statues 
on which people have hung 
clothes and the Elephanta 
caves covered in garbage. 
She stated more than two-
thirds of India’s federally 
protected monuments are left 
unguarded.

Lahiri also blamed the poor 

treatment of the monuments 
on encroachments as part of 
a systematic land grab and 
politicians who favor these 
actions over ones that protect 
the heritage sites.

“These 
beautiful 

monuments, as a consequence, 
has (sic) been turned into a 
rubbish dump,” Lahiri said.

One 
example 
of 
this, 

according to Lahiri, is when 
former 
Prime 
Minister 

Indira Gandhi’s government 
 

allowed the creation of a 
petroleum refinery within 
40 kilometers of the Taj 
Mahal in 1968. As soon as 
1973, 
it 
became 
evident 

environmental 
pollutants 

had been harming the monument 
itself, and the Indian Supreme 
Court stepped in to regulate the 
emissions from the refinery.

“In retrospect, Mrs. Gandhi’s 

inability to act on this manner sits 
very uneasily with her interest 
in monuments, one can only 
“surmise that the tassel between 
heritage and development, in this 
instance, she turned her face away 
from the past,” Lahiri said.

Lahiri gave possible solutions 

for the care of monuments. 
She stated that the top-down 
approach with the government 
has failed and a bottom-up 
approach would help protect 
heritage sites and public pressure 
from the ground-up would better 
protect these national sites. She 
supported education in schools 
beyond textbook learning, such 
as taking children out to these 
 

monuments, which she believes 
would instill national pride and 
protection for their heritage.

Rackham 
student 
Brittany 

Puller said Lahiri’s lecture was, 
for 
her, 
a 
once-in-a-lifetime 

opportunity to hear the author.

“My biggest takeaway was 

the 
conservation 
of 
Indian 

monuments and how not much 
is being done, however, it needs 
to be a bottom-up approach 
 

rather than just an archeological 
sites approach,” Puller said.

Lahiri emphasized the pride 

she has in her Indian heritage and 
the pride all Indians should have 
over their monuments.

“India’s monuments and relics, 

I think, deserve better than what 
has fallen to their lot,” Lahiri 
said. “Their ownership across 
all sections of society is very 
 

urgent and necessary, they have to 
survive in a better form than what 
we see around.”

Many have hailed Mcity, the 

University of Michigan’s self-driving 

car site, as the first of its kind in 

accelerating the global autonomous 

vehicle technology. In the last year, 

though, the campus has played 

host to far saucier competition: The 

future of pizza delivery. 

Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda 

announced Monday the Japanese 

car company will begin testing 

self-driving vehicles at Mcity in 

partnership with Uber, Amazon 

and Pizza Hut. The class of vehicles 

dubbed “e-Palette,” according to 

Wired, will serve as a “mobile hub 

for services from medical clinics to 

entertainment and festivals.”

Vehicles will be electric and 

fully self-driving, with some 

types large enough to even 

contain small businesses. The 

announcement marks a shift 

from driving technology-focused 

development to business strategies 

that can measure— quite literally — 

deliverable gains. Toyoda projected 

the concept vehicles would hit 

testing grounds by 2020.

“With Toyota, we are excited to 

be partnering with an undisputed 

leader in human mobility with a 

reputation for innovation, reliability 

and efficiency, as we define the 

pizza delivery experience of the 

future,” Artie Starrs, president of 

Pizza Hut U.S., said in a statement. 

“We are focused on technology-

based solutions that enable our team 

members and drivers to deliver even 

better customer experiences.”

Flavor considerations aside, 

Pizza Hut isn’t too far behind 

Domino’s Pizza. The Ann Arbor-

based competitor announced a 

similar partnership with Ford 

last August. The companies’ most 

pressing questions included how 

customers would react to having to 

leave their homes to retrieve their 

pizza orders.

Mcity researchers made their 

own headlines earlier this week 

with the release of three potential 

cybersecurity vulnerabilities in 

self-driving vehicles. From hacked 

technology to ransoms, a Mcity 

report detailed the ways in which 

self-driving cars could be subject to 

security threats — and how Mcity 

plans to tackle them.

According to Andre 

Weimerskirch, lead author of 

the report, who leads Mcity’s 

cybersecurity working group and is 

also vice president of cybersecurity 

for Lear Corp, the scientific and 

business communities have not 

been paying enough attention to 

cybersecurity within the realm of 

self-driving cars.

“Cybersecurity is an overlooked 

area of research in the development 

of autonomous vehicles,” 

Weimerskirch said to Michigan 

News. “Our tool marks not only 

an important early step in solving 

these problems, but also presents a 

blueprint to effectively identify and 

analyze cybersecurity threats and 

create effective approaches to make 

autonomous vehicle systems safe 

and secure.”

In their report, the researchers 

examine the potential threats 

involved in automated parking. 

According to the press release, the 

most likely attacks are a mechanic 

disabling the range sensors in park-

assist or remote parking in order to 

require additional maintenance for 

which a driver would have to pay, 

and an expert hacker sending a false 

signal to your vehicle’s receiver to 

turn off remote parking. Both of 

these vulnerabilities were given a six 

out of 10 on a scale the researchers 

created, with zero being the lowest 

probability.

how the procedures outlined 
in this ordinance would relieve 
Ann Arbor residents of time-
consuming actions to remove 
council members.

“If 
residents 
feel 
that 

someone misbehaved, let’s say 
in being elected, they would 
have to wait another three 
years for that councilmember 
to be replaced,” Kailasapathy 
said. “We are putting an undue 
burden on the residents to 
collect the number of signatures 
to recall that councilmember.”

Although 
supporting 
the 

ordinance, 
Councilmember 

Westphal, 
D-Ward 
2, 
also 

brought 
up 
the 
need 
for 

caution regarding the way the 
procedures are implemented.

“I understand that recalls 

are a great tool to have and 
they can be effective but it is a 
great burden,” Westphal said. 
“Certainly if there is an inkling 
of something like this be used 
improperly, we would modify or 
remove it, so I think we will be 
keeping an eye on it.”

Mayor Christopher Taylor-D 

emphasized the ordinance as 
a necessary new chapter that 
will provide a proper course of 
action for Ann Arbor residents 
to remove councilmembers.

“This is something that we 

as a council have needed for 
some time to put rules in place,” 
Taylor said. “We need to have 

an ordinance that provides a 
structure for folks who have 
concerns about the actions of 
council members.”

However, Ann Arbor resident 

Edward Vielmetti highlighted 
how 
the 
ordinance 
could 

politicize a polarized council 
and be used to oust a council 
member 
through 
an 
unfair 

method.

“The process of removing a 

Democrat being elected member 
of Council by non-democratic 
method 
doesn’t 
strike 
me 

as a particularly good one,” 
Vielmetti said. “It strikes me 
as something that in a climate 
could be used as a political 
weapon … and to fill this hole 
(in the code) might come back to 
haunt us in years to come.”

Yet, 
Councilmember 
Julie 

Grand, D-Ward 3, explained the 
need to enforce this ordinance 
now rather than waiting for 
a violation to occur. “A time 
when we are not dealing with 
a particular action with a 
particular council member is 
the time to impart rules so that 
we are not trying to make up 
things as we go.”

With 
the 
new 
chapter’s 

approval, the ordinance will 
take effect ten days following 
legal publication.

“I hope we can file this under 

a never need to use category,” 
Westphal 
said. 
“It 
would 

certainly be great to have in 
a very unlikely event where it 
would actually play a role.”

Some 
garages, 
like 
the 

Maynard 
structure, 
already 

feature fencing. Pollay told The 
Daily 
in 
October 
structures 

that will be prioritized include 
the rooftop of the Fourth and 
Williams streets structure — 
topping the list due to its sheer 
size — followed by the Ann and 
Ashley streets structure, the 
Fourth and Washington streets 
structure, the Maynard structure, 

the Liberty Square structure and 
the Forest Avenue structure. 
The DDA will also pursue other 
tactics such as signage and 
structure management. 

After deaths last September 

and October, city officials pivoted 
to taking action on the temporary 
fences. Matt Lige, an Ann Arbor 
Police 
Department 
Lietenant, 

was 
one 
such 
official 
who 

expressed initial frustration. 

“I’m frustrated by the volume 

of deaths from parking structures 
in the city of Ann Arbor,” he said 
on the scene of the October fatal 

fall. “I think it’s safe to say that 
we’re all frustrated.”

The city has also installed 

signage with the phone number 
for 
the 
National 
Suicide 

Prevention Lifeline and other 
psychiatric service information 
to 
deter 
individuals 
from 

committing suicide.

University of Michigan-owned 

structures do not have the same 
barriers as city-owned structures 
do.

In 
an 
email 
interview, 

Stephen 
Dolen, 
executive 

director of University Logistics, 

Transportation 
and 
Parking, 

stated 
options 
are 
currently 

being evaluated to implement 
similar deterrent methods to 
 

University-owned 
parking 

structures.

“The Logistics, Transportation 

and 
Parking 
unit 
has 
been 

working with parking consultants 
to evaluate options, reviewing 
the 
effectiveness, 
operational 

considerations 
and 
costs 
of 

adding some types of additional 
preventative measures and it 
continues to be a topic of ongoing 
discussion,” Dolen wrote.

He highlighted the fear he 
felt of future terrorist attacks, 
both within his work with 
colleagues 
at 
the 
White 

House as well as within 
general society. He explained 
officials’ general belief in 
the last decade that another 
attack was around the corner, 
which further incited a race 
to strengthen defense against 
terrorism. These conditions, 
he 
offered, 
have 
outsize 

influence on more aggressive 
policies instituted by the U.S. 
government after the attack.

Rasmussen also illustrated 

the growing complexity of 
anti-terrorism initiatives with 
the diminishment of al-Qaeda 
as a main player and the 
introduction of ISIS.

“What we’ve seen with 

the ISIS variant of global 
terrorism over the last few 
years, is that impact can be 
achieved 
with 
frequency, 

with randomness and the 
terror that comes with being 
unpredictable,” 
Rasmussen 

said.

Ciorciari 
mentioned 
the 

operation 
to 
capture 
and 

kill Osama bin Laden, which 
Rasmussen cited as a perceived 
symbol of conclusive defeat 
over terrorism in the U.S. 
Still, the operation continued 
to have varying implications 
in its overall success. 

“Much of the work that was 

done against al-Qaeda was 
focused on collecting really 
finely-grained 
intelligence 

to 
give 
us 
insight 
into 

what particular groups of 
individuals were planning,” 
Rasmussen said. “And we 
had some pretty significant 
advantages at the time. In 
many ways the problem set 
was more manageable then, 
because we were dealing with 
a relatively contained group 
of terrorist actors around the 
globe.”

In contrast, ISIS operates 

organizationally 
to 
gain 

as much global support as 
possible.

Rasmussen also discussed 

his 
role 
throughout 
the 

shift 
into 
the 
Trump 

administration, affirming that 
consistency within national 
security, especially during a 
potentially more vulnerable 
political 
environment, 
has 

been prioritized. 

“Much as President Obama, 

when he assumed office after 
President Bush, kept a number 
of 
senior 
counterterrorism 

officials in place, it was 
obviously President Trump 
and 
his 
administration’s 

conclusion that continuity in 
some of these areas was in the 
national interest as well,” he 
said.

In regards to a statement 

about 
President 
Trump’s 

potentially 
destabilizing 

remarks toward Muslim and 
minority populations, as well 
as foreign groups, Rasmussen 
agreed any statements that 
deepen distrust between the 
government and communities 
makes 
the 
process 
of 

counterterrorism increasingly 
difficult. 
However, 
he 

highlighted there is a holistic 
need 
for 
the 
government 

to initiate efforts towards 
structuring an approach to 
community engagement that 
encourages an environment of 
mutual trust.

“There isn’t a single right-

sized federal program that 
I think could be applied, at 
scale, across the country, that 
could account for all of the 
differences in the way that 
communities are responding 
to 
extremism 
across 
the 

country,” he said.

LSA senior Anna Horton 

attended the event out of a 
general interest in foreign 
policy as an international 
studies minor. 

“I figured it would be 

helpful to get some insight 
on what a former government 
official 
thought 
about 

terrorism in the U.S and 
also 
our 
involvement 
in 

counterterrorism 
overseas,” 

she said. “I did really like his 
comment about there needing 
to 
be 
a 
local 
grassroots 

response.”

looks at college campuses around 
the country and rates their free 
speech policies.

FIRE 
rates 
“green 
light 

schools” are campuses it views as 
friendly to friend speech, while 
red light schools are the worst. 
FIRE rated the University as a red 
light institution.

“U-M has red light policies 

that basically show that the 
school is less open to free speech,” 
Williamson said. “So the purpose 

of this specifically is to just 
promote a culture of free speech 
here on campus.”

FIRE has deemed some of 

the University’s policies on hate 
speech, bias-related incidents and 
sexual harassment to be examples 
of red light policies that restrict 
students’ free speech.

Williamson had been to many 

campuses around the state of 
Michigan, and said that he hadn’t 
been at the University’s campus 
long enough to really tell how the 
policies were enforced. However, 
regardless 
of 
how 
they 
are 

enforced, Williamson said the way 

that the policies are written are 
not necessarily welcoming to free 
speech.

In addition to the Leadership 

Institute’s 
display 
at 
various 

universities, other conservative 
advocacy 
groups 
such 
as 

Turning Point USA have been 
increasing 
their 
presence 
in 

higher education. Last year, a 
website by Turning Point called 
Professor 
Watchlist 
identified 

about 150 professors around the 
country as discriminating against 
conservative students.

Williamson said at times, the 

beach ball and other events he 

has organized have been met 
with protesters and even police 
interference. 
In 
this 
specific 

display, the ball was met with 
curious looks and some questions, 
but no one seemed particularly 
threatened by it.

Many students stopped to write 

on the ball. While some students 
wrote song lyrics or drew pictures, 
others took a more political route 
with their writing. One side of the 
ball had “Palestine” written with a 
heart under it, and the other had 
“G-d Bless Israel.” There was one 
comment that read “speech isn’t 
free,” and some that were more 

vulgar; for example, “F— Mike 
Pence.”

One student who stopped 

to write on the ball was LSA 
sophomore Lucas Renno, who 
thought while the beach ball 
may not entirely get the point 
across, it was a good start to 
talking about free speech at the 
University.

“I believe that free speech, 

as in the very idea of the right 
that anybody should be able 
to express an opinion without 
being censored or persecuted, is 
a right that is fundamental to our 
modern society, and to the very 

concept of democracy itself,” 
Renno said.

Engineering freshman Anu 

Tuladhar, who stopped to look at 
the ball, also said she believed it 
was a “cool way” to promote free 
speech.

“I think having a physical 

representation to just put your 
thoughts on is nice because it’s 
not something online where 
it’s completely anonymous, and 
you feel completely protected 
by cyberspace,” Tuladhar said. 
“You still have this place where 
you can just show everyone, ‘this 
is what I’m thinking.’ ”

and express solidarity regarding 
certain topics. 

The discussion then shifted 

to questions regarding the Go 
Blue Guarantee and its potential 
effect on students. The Go Blue 
Guarantee, effective January 2018, 
promises free tuition for four years 
to in-state undergraduate students 
on the Ann Arbor campus with 
family incomes under $65,000.

CSG Vice President Nadine 

Jawad, a Public Policy senior, 
expressed concerns for the lower 
middle range of students applying 
for aid but not meeting the income 

threshold required for the new 
effort. 
Councilmembers 
asked 

questions regarding where the cut-
off income for the guarantee lies, 
and which students truly benefit 
from it.

“[The 
Go 
Blue 
Guarantee] 

is 
a 
gradually 
need-based 

policy,” Sellers said. “It is the 
most affordable need-based aid 
educational opportunity within 
the state [of Michigan]. 

In terms of DEI’s progress 

since its launch in October 2016, 
Sellers 
told 
council 
members 

that the goal is to make DEI a 
critical part of the University’s 
core values, while inciting long-
term institutional change. The 
fact that DEI is now a term widely 

recognized by students is a sign of 
its effectiveness over the past year, 
according to Sellers.

LSA 
Student 
Government 

President Nicholas Fadanelli, an 
LSA senior, explained preliminary 
efforts being made to potentially 
change the academic calendar for 
upcoming school years, specifically 
extending 
winter 
break 
or 

shortening summer break. These 
alterations to the calendar will 
most likely not be effective until 
the 2020-2021 school year.

“This 
has 
been 
on 
the 

backburner for a couple years 
now,” Fadanelli said. “There’s a 
decent number of faculty members 
who don’t want to lose a week from 
their very long summer.”

There are varying opinions 

across the University’s schools, 
but council members discussed 
sending out surveys to their 
respective schools in order to 
determine students’ opinions on 
the proposition.

“A lot of people decide to do 

internships in the summer, and 
that week at the end [of break] 
could make a difference,” Jawad 
said.

Fadanelli told council members 

that a consolidated opinion on 
behalf of the entire University 
Council could be more effective 
when presenting the proposition 
to administration, which they 
are planning to have complete by 
spring break.

ecently, my friend told me 
about an encounter with 
a classmate of hers. Her 

classmate had shared that they* 
felt irked that a girl wanted to join 
an organization they were a part 
of because she was white, and they 
wanted the club to be diverse. They 
then proceeded to say to my friend, 
who is half-Mexican, “you know, 
like you.” My friend recounted the 
incident to me with a disgruntled 
expression on her face, and then 
sarcastically told me that she 
was glad that she could be their 
“Latina friend.”

This got me thinking: Am I too, 

as an Asian woman, only sought 
out for friendships because I am 
part of marginalized groups? I’ve 
certainly had worries about people 
not wanting to associate with me 
because I’m not white, and there 
also have been times when people 
have attempted to “get to know 
me” by asking me uncomfortable 
questions (What are you? What 
language do you speak at home?). 
However, I had never considered 
that people may want to be friends 
with me because I’m a person 
of color, as some sort of twisted 
method of becoming “woke” or 
validation that they already are.

When I pondered the incident, 

however, I realized what her 
friend had said to her shouldn’t 
have been so surprising to me: 
There are plenty of people who 
argue that they cannot be racist 
because they have a Black friend 
or believe they are automatically 
not sexist because they have a 
female 
co-worker. 
I’ve 
heard 

people excitedly say they’d love 
to have a “gay best friend” to give 
them fashion advice and be their 
love gurus as if stereotyping all 
gay people into one, flamboyant 
personality type isn’t wrong. And 
while this kind of thinking is less 
harmful than hurling hateful slurs 
at others, believing that any sort 
of association with a person of a 
marginalized identity as proof of 
being accepting is problematic. 

This way of thinking treats anyone 
who is a part of a marginalized 
group, whether it is because of 
their sexual orientation, race or 
any other part of their identity, as a 
cheap accessory.

It’s one thing to want to have 

a diverse group of peers, but it’s 
another to actively seek out people 
of marginalized groups, or in the 
case of my friend’s classmate, 
dismiss those who are privileged 
as ignorant. And as someone who 
is part of a couple of different 
marginalized groups, the idea that 
someone would want to associate 
with me simply because of my race 
or gender is demeaning. I don’t 
owe it to anyone, with or without 
privilege, to act as their obligatory 
Asian female friend. And while 
purposely surrounding yourself 
with people who’ve gone through 
hardships sounds like a great idea 
in theory, it’s not by any means an 
effective way to become educated 
about the inequality rampant in 
the nation. This is not the way to 
become “woke,” and it is not the 
way to fight injustice.

In contrast, being “woke” means 

listening to those who speak 
about their experiences facing 
inequalities. It means supporting 
Black Lives Matter and other equal 
rights movements, believing that 
terrorism has no religion, that 
love is love and that gender is a 
spectrum. But this is by no means 
an exhaustive list, and it’s okay to 
not be aware of every facet of the 
struggle for social justice — what is 
most important is a desire to learn 
in a way that doesn’t diminish 
the very people you are trying to 
support. I myself struggle with 
not 
knowing 
everything 
and 

accidentally stepping on the toes 
of others, but over time, I’ve found 
that learning about and fighting for 
social justice is a journey.

While this journey may seem 

arduous and painful, it’s anything 
but, and the options for learning 
are endless — reads such as 
Roxane Gay’s “Bad Feminist” and 

articles by Gloria Steinem are great 
resources for unpacking feminism. 
Hasan 
Minhaj’s 
Netflix 
show 

“Homecoming King” and Ralph 
Ellison’s novel “Invisible Man” 
are wonderful sources that expose 
the effects of racism. Engaging in 
conversation with those who want 
to discuss relevant topics, whether 
it’s over a cup of coffee or on Twitter, 
is a surefire way to learn about 
different perspectives. Joining an 
activism organization can also be 
helpful. Some organizations at the 
University of Michigan include 
HeForShe, the Autism Society of 
Michigan and the Black Student 
Union. I am a member of HeForShe 
and enjoy group discussions on 
topics ranging from gender roles to 
intersectionality. I find that when 
I include myself in these types 
of conversations, I can better 
relate to my peers in a way that 
is invaluable and enlightening. 
And while I may not be creating 
widespread change, I’m taking 
steps in the right direction.

I am by no means an expert on 

all things social justice, and I am 
certainly not trying to preach to a 
crowd or slam others for not being 
liberal enough. Instead, what I am 
trying to do is inform others that 
there are infinite ways to become 
“woke” that are far better than 
being nitpicky about friends or 
asking invasive questions. This 
distinction is important because 
miscommunication 
is 
perhaps 

one of the biggest culprits behind 
the 
polarization 
of 
society 

today, and effective methods of 
communication could potentially 
act as a huge catalyst for spawning 
change. While wanting to learn 
and understand the people calling 
for action is great, it must be done 
with respect. It is only then that 
we can truly begin to understand 
each other.

I 
first 
heard 

about the proposed 
tax 
increase 
on 

graduate students, I thought, “why 
would anyone make it harder 
for motivated, capable people 
to pursue higher education?” I 
work in a lab with many graduate 
students, and I am considering 
graduate school myself. This tax 
would have hurt people I know, 
and although it would not affect 
me immediately, it could certainly 
impact my future. I sent emails to 
both Michigan senators as well 
as my district’s congresswoman 
urging them to fight against the 
provision 
increasing 
graduate 

students 
taxes. 
This 
was 
a 

national effort supported by many 
universities and groups of graduate 
students across the country.

Even with support for these 

students, over the next week, I was 
still reading article after article 
about how it could be left in the 
final bill. The tax would have been 
harmful to not only individual 
students but the entire United 
States graduate school system. I 
wanted to show other students 
how harmful this could be, so I 
decided to speak with someone 
who would actually be affected.

Through talking with people 

I 
knew 
within 
the 
physics 

department here at the University 
of Michigan, I was able to set up 
an interview on Dec. 4 with Shruti 
Paranjape, a Rackham student 
studying 
theoretical 
physics. 

She received her bachelor’s and 
master’s degrees from the Indian 
Institute of Science Education and 
Research in Pune, India.

I first wanted to get some 

background on Paranjape and 
why she chose to come to the 
University. After all, there are 
many institutions all over the 
world that have great graduate 
programs. Paranjape mentioned 
that she knew she wanted to come 
to the U.S for graduate school 
because 
American 
programs 

offer the most comprehensive 
instruction. She ultimately decided 
on the University of Michigan 
because she had heard about the 
great reputation of the school.

“There were very few places 

in India that measure up to the 
quality of the universities I was 
considering in the United States,” 
Paranjape said on why she decided 
to come to the U.S. to pursue her 

Ph.D. instead of India.

The U.S. is known for having 

great graduate schools. According 
to US News and World Report, eight 
of the top 10 global universities for 
graduate studies are American 
universities. The rankings are 
based on factors such as research 
publications, academic conferences 
and reputation surveys. If the U.S. 
wants to keep its universities at 
the top, it must continue to attract 
the best students. It is hard to do 
that when students think that they 
will not have the support or money 
needed to live their lives.

As 
I 
continued 
with 
the 

interview, I started to become 
aware of some of the things 
that 
graduate 
students 
have 

to 
sacrifice. 
While 
Paranjape 

can live comfortably on what 
graduate students are currently 
supplied with, she still has to 
make sacrifices. This past winter 
break was the first time that she 
had been home to visit her family. 
International flights are expensive, 
and graduate students save up 
for months to be able to afford to 
visit their home communities. 
This is a common situation for 
international students.

“You barely get to see your 

friends, your family, that entire 
community you built up for years,” 
Paranjape said.

We eventually came to the 

topic of the proposed tax. I asked 
Paranjape if she thought that it 
would force her to sacrifice more 
things or force her out of school, 
and she said she would have to cut 
down on some hobbies, but she 
would find a way to remain at the 
University. She was more worried 
about how it would have potentially 
affected others who might not be 
in the same position as her and that 
the` tax would make United States 
graduate school no longer a viable 
option for many students.

These changes the tax bill 

would have brought would have 
been devastating for international 
students especially. It would have 
left them with few options and 
no money for the start-up costs of 
moving to a new country let alone 
dealing with general living expenses.

At Rackham Graduate school, 

just over 35 percent of the graduate 
students enrolled are international 
students. This is a large group 
of people, and if this kind of tax 
provision passed, we would most 

likely see that number drop.

At the end of our conversation, I 

proposed the idea of giving a greater 
amount of support to graduate 
students rather than taxing them 
more. I asked Paranjape if this 
hypothetical change could bring 
more diversity to universities. She 
thought it would.

“Just 
from 
a 
pragmatic 

standpoint, say all you want is for 
your department to do amazing 
research, the more diversity in the 
kind of people that are thinking will 
lead to more diversity in the kind of 
ideas they are thinking about. It 
would mean better research and 
make for a better department. The 
more diversity, the better, period,” 
Paranjape said.

Diversity 
is 
important 
in 

bringing new perspectives to any 
field and helps make any project 
more innovative and well-rounded. 
If graduate education had become 
more expensive through this tax 
increase, there is a good chance 
that many universities and their 
departments would have lost out 
on applicants who would no longer 
see graduate school as affordable. 
As Paranjape said, this would 
have narrowed the type of people 
that would be able to afford 
graduate school, leading to a 
shrinking of ideas.

Graduate students have a lot 

on their plate, including research, 
classes and just trying to live a 
comfortable life. They are always 
busy and this tax bill would have 
been another burden for them 
to bear. Graduate students are 
the people who are pushing our 
understandings and developing 
new ideas. It is already a stressful 
time and many, like Paranjape, are 
away from family and friends. I do 
not believe that they should have 
to worry about not having enough 
money to support themselves.

Although the proposed tax 

on graduate students was not 
included in the final bill that was 
passed, there is a good chance 
that it will be brought up again. 
As students, as educators, as U.S. 
citizens, we must continually 
support graduate students. Not just 
to fend off attacks that would make 
it harder for them, but to give more 
aid whenever possible.

Why (good) foreign language education is important

When becoming ‘woke’ turns toxic

L

ike all true romances, 
ours was long and slow, 
but when it came, it was 

everything. Yes, I didn’t fall 
in love with Spanish until my 
senior year of high school, but 
now, I am planning to major in 
it and already looking forward 
to studying abroad in Buenos 
Aires. But why did it take so 
long for me to discover this 
passion, and why do I feel like 
I am the only one?

In 
the 
United 
States 

education system, there is 
no national foreign language 
requirement. 
Most 
kids 

don’t start learning a foreign 
language until middle school, 
when they are forced to pick 
between 
limited 
options, 

usually 
opting 
for 
either 

Spanish or French. Their first 
experience with the language 
is often through a tired, bored 
teacher who is usually neither 
a native speaker nor qualified 
to teach the language in true 
depth; the result of this is 
unmotivated 
and 
resentful 

students. 
“My 
Spanish 

education turned me off to 
(learning Spanish) as learning 
Spanish began to seem more 
like work than a useful skill,” 
Jessica Baker, LSA freshman, 
said. However, they trudge 
on 
through 
rudimentary 

vocabulary 
games, 
English 

movies with French subtitles 
and unhelpful grammar games 
until they have fulfilled their 
school’s 
requirements. 
For 

example, Ann Arbor Public 
Schools 
only 
requires 
two 

years of a high school foreign 
language, after which most 
students pause their learning 
until college, where they feel 
lost and unprepared.

The majority of high school 

and college students finish 
their 
language 
requirement 

with no desire to actually 
employ their new skills. This 
is due to the poor quality and 
tardiness of their language 
education. 
First, 
starting 

language education in sixth 
grade is too late; this is past 
what psychologists call the 
critical period, the period after 
which learning a language 
natively 
is 
thought 
to 
be 

impossible. It is still possible to 
speak and understand fluently, 
but with much more difficulty, 
and never as naturally. Because 
of this critical period, schools 
should 
employ 
mandatory 

language education starting 
in kindergarten. Certain Ann 
Arbor schools do this, however, 
it is often optional and not 
offered at all schools; Spanish 
is the only language offered 
at all Ann Arbor elementary 
schools. If these programs are 

integrated at the beginning of 
school, children will be more 
likely to become proficient, 
well-spoken and interested in 
their second language.

I am lucky — I grew up 

speaking Bulgarian, so it was 
easier for me to learn Spanish, 
despite my late start. If all 
children grow up bilingual, they 
will gain stronger and more 
refined cognitive skills. This 
will have a butterfly effect and 
impact schools, the workforce 
and the world positively.

Another 
issue 
with 

secondary language education 
is the poor quality of teaching. 
World language teachers are 
usually not native speakers or 
qualified to teach, but rather 
someone 
who 
studied 
the 

language years ago in school. 
For example, my middle school 
had two Spanish teachers; 
both were Americans. This 
meant that they had a good 
comprehension of the language 
on paper, but not in speech, 
culture or dialect; these are 
arguably the most important 
features to know. In turn, most 
class activities are on paper.

“I think I learned how 

to read, write and answer 
multiple choice tests in Spanish 
very 
well, 
but 
I 
thought 

there 
was 
very 
minimal 

practice with speaking the 
language in an unstructured 
conversation,” LSA freshman 
Lindsay Hasson said of her 
Spanish schooling. “We had a 
few tests in which we recorded 
our voices, but even with these 
assessments we had time to 
write out what we would say. I 
felt that I lacked the ability to 
have a casual conversation in 
Spanish, so if I could change 
one thing it would be to make 
time practicing speaking in 
situations that would occur in 
real life.”

It is atrocious that students 

who spend so much time 
“learning” 
a 
language 
can 

barely apply it. I also felt this 
hopelessness after my six years 
of Spanish education. I wanted 
to communicate with my aunt, 
who is Spanish, but the only 
way I could show my skills was 

over email, where I could take 
my time and edit profusely. 
Even then, the Spanish was 
forced and formal, not casual 
and realistic.

The 
third 
reason 
why 

foreign language education is 
so inferior in the U.S. is the 
low standards for proficiency. 
The Michigan Department of 
Education has a functions-
content-accuracy 
model 
for 

proficiency that is vague and 
basic. A large majority of 
students who feel dissatisfied 
with their fluency report also 
having passed those classes, 
and additionally passing the 
University’s college placement 
exam. This causes confusion 
among students.

“I ended up testing out of 

Spanish at the college level, so 
what I learned in high school 
is all I will probably get,” 
Baker said. “I’m advised not 
to take a Spanish class as I’m 
not planning on minoring or 
majoring in it, so it’s like taking 
Spanish would be a ‘waste’. I 
guess I’m surprised that I’m 
considered to have a sufficient 
amount of Spanish experience 
for college.”

It is true that universities 

often disregard the need for a 
second language comprehension 
altogether, as seen in the College 
of Engineering or the Ross 
School of Business. Even in LSA, 
it is easy to test out of a language, 
despite feeling unprepared to 
utilize it.

I will always remember how 

lucky I was to be in a situation 
where I could fall for Spanish. 
Senior year of high school I 
elected to take a University class 
through a program my school 
offered. So, every day from 3 p.m. 
to 4 p.m., I headed over to the 
Modern Languages Building to 
take Spanish 232. It was here that 
I finally uncovered the secrets 
to loving learning a language: 
quality 
teaching, 
curriculum 

and participation. My professor 
was passionate (and a native 
Argentinian), the class was small 
and involved and our curriculum 
was stimulating. Taking this class 
made me realize the importance 
of good foreign language teachers 
and interesting coursework. If 
these standards are implemented 
from an early age, the benefits 
will 
be 
countless. 
Quality 

foreign language education is 
critical, and it cannot be half-
assed. If we take this necessary 
skill seriously, it will have 
wonderful effects on students 
and, eventually, our society.

It is atrocious 

that students who 

spend so much 
time ‘learning’ 
a language can 
barely apply it.

I’ve wanted to write about 

sex for awhile. Impactful on 
our health and organic to our 
human nature, sex is a day-
to-day topic of discussion. 
But I’ve held off writing about 
it due to its complexities, its 
frustrations, its demands. Sex 
is this game where many of 
us want to play, but there are 
all of these rules, all of these 
different 
strategies, 
all 
of 

these precautions… so on and 
so on. And yet, regardless of 
these hurdles, we play anyway.

As 
we 
know, 
college 

campuses have been serving as 
the microcosm of sex culture 
for decades. As we also know 
it, college campuses serve as 
a place of individual growth, 
success 
and 
discovery. 
I 

think about how sex culture 
is so dominant over an entire 
student body, and yet that 
student 
body 
consists 
of 

individuals who hold their 
own beliefs and ideas. We live 
in a place where sex is this 
overshadowing stigma, this 
idea that “everybody’s doing 
it.” But how does this social 
pressure 
affect 
us 
young 

adults and our sex lives?

The act of sex itself has its 

pros and cons (mainly the 
former) that impact everyone 
on a physical and mental level. 
And just because sex is such 
a pleasure in life, it’s not the 
only pleasure which we should 
be seeking.

But we’re pulled in these 

directions — one, sex is and 
should be healthy and a choice 
that varies from person to 
person, but two, we believe we 
should be having sex because 
that’s what we’ve been told by 
our society and our media. We 
believe if we aren’t having sex, 
there’s something wrong. We 
believe if we don’t have sex a 
certain way, there’s something 
wrong. This daunting stigma 
and social norm now stomps 
all over what should be a 
positive, natural act for our 
well-being. 

I decided to look more into 

this intro dichotomy of sex 
and how it affects people. 

Some articles propose that sex 
makes your memory stronger 
or that it can allay symptoms 
of anxiety. Others discuss 
how sex affects your brain 
in the same way as drugs do, 
releasing influxes of dopamine 
and other natural compounds. 

I found mixed answers about 
how sex can decrease feelings 
of depression but can also lead 
one to be depressed (talk about 
confusing, right?). But just 
like drugs and alcohol, sex, the 
thought of it and the act itself, 
can be full of contradictions. 
It puts peer pressure on young 
adults who are just beginning 
to get their hands on it and 
express interest in doing it. 
This opposing force of the 
sex itself versus sex culture is 
what causes this whole game 
to be unhealthy.

When I was a freshman in 

college, I was worried about 
sex. These fears ran through 
my head of what it would be 
like, who it would be with, if 
they would be my significant 
other or not, if they thought 
I would be “good in bed.” 
This fear, these continuous 
questions 
and 
scenarios 

swimming through my brain, 
took away my focus of the 
positives of sex and into the 
dark side its stigmas. Even as 
a junior, I still worry about sex 
to some extent.

Those 
thoughts 
and 

pressures alone restricted not 

only myself, but a population 
of young people to see sex in 
a certain, fixed light. Many of 
my own friends have rushed 
into sexual situations or looked 
at sex from a single-minded 
perspective. They’ve told me 
how the sex itself was fine, but 
they still feel so shitty. Some 
are addicted to it and some 
straight up stay away from it. 
Regardless of how one may 
feel about sex, we can’t deny 
that sex is a dominant lifestyle 
and a daunting pressure that 
as young people, we just can’t 
help but think about.

Sex is just as mentally 

effective as it is physical. It’s 
just as pleasing as it is harmful, 

just as comforting as it is unsafe. 
It’s the high demands of the 
sex talks, the free condoms, the 
jokes, the sexual depictions in 
our media and more that lead 
us to turn something so natural 
and enjoyable to something that 
can be unsettling and confusing. 
Maybe the mental aspect of 
it all is the thing we forget so 
often — to be cognizant of our 
choices, our own comforts and 
our own beliefs when it comes to 
doing something that affects our 
health.

Rosenstock continues 
to criticize capitalism

We’re starting this year on 

the right foot, with a surprise 
release 
from 
Long 
Island 

native Jeff Rosenstock. An 
absurdly prolific 
musician with a 
career spanning 
over 
20 
years, 

POST-, 
released 

to 
Rosenstock’s 

Bandcamp 
on 

New Year’s Day, 
follows 
2016’s 
WORRY. 
as 

his fourth solo full-length 
and first for Polyvinyl. As 
with his past work, POST- 
might best be described as 
a joyful expression of angry 
discontentment. Lyrics focus 
on the struggles of being an 
individual in an increasingly 
modern 
world 
while 
also 

condemning the state of the 
world at large.

POST- is also a continuation 

of 
Rosenstock’s 
powerfully 

anthemic songwriting. Songs 
explode out of nothing and 
move at a breakneck pace, 
driven by electric guitar and 
percussion and interspersed 
with tasteful solos as well as 
a number of more ambient 
interludes. Here, Rosenstock 
appears to be more invested in 
his craft than ever before, from 
both lyrical and compositional 
perspectives. Where WORRY. 
crams 17 songs in 37 minutes, 
POST- gives us 10 in just over 
40 minutes. Each song on 
the new album is undeniably 
dense, skillfully intertwining 
the personal and political. 
Rosenstock’s 
focus 
and 

determination are at all-time 
highs on POST-. A call to arms, 
the album itself is a passionate 
plea to end complacency.

The album title itself has 

two express functions. First, 
it acts as a gentle jab at the 
“post-”s of music’s alternative 
scene, 
generally 
used 
by 

those who have decided that 
the 
existing 
lexicon 
isn’t 

sufficient to describe some 
work or another. It’s a fair 
criticism, but we shouldn’t 
get caught on the specifics; 
Rosenstock is just calling for 

more genuineness and less 
arrogance. 
Second, 
POST- 

also seems to refer to the 
“after” following an event, the 
cleaning up of some aftermath. 
Maybe a tenuous connection, 
but the album cover is a man 

vacuuming 
the 

entryway 
of 
a 

venue, and it’s 
not hard to guess 
to which event 
the “after” might 
refer. 
(Hint: 

there 
was 
a 

rather significant election in 
late 2016.)

POST- 
follows 
2016’s 

excellent 
WORRY. 
not 

only in sequence, but also

WORRY. 
tracks 

“HELLLLHOOOOLE” 
and 
“Festival 
Song” 
saw 

Rosenstock 
expressing 
his 

discontent 
with 
modern 

society — not least his own 
life — singing “They wouldn’t 
be your friend if you weren’t 
worth something,” as both 
personal reminder and lament 
for 
the 
nature 
of 
human 

interactions in a capitalist 
culture. POST- is in large part 
also an examination of how the 
human experience is declining 
in quality.

Opening track “Mornin’!” 

is 
a 
disquietingly 
robotic 

voicemail: “Hello, best friend 
/ It’s me / Hope this makes 
it 
on 
your 
new 
record.” 

It’s a vague sort of mission 
statement 
(parallel 
to 
the 

aforementioned 
“Festival 

Song” lyric), a manifestation 
of 
the 
way 
interpersonal 

relationships are too often 
viewed 
as 
commodities, 

friends and acquaintances as 
opportunities to further one’s 
own social status.

Immediately after is the 

lengthy “USA,” POST-’s true 
exposition, whose cornerstone 
is the repetition of “tired 
and bored.” At eight minutes 
long, the song is longer than 
any 
other 
in 
Rosenstock’s 

discography, save for “Let 
Them Win,” which appears 
later on the album. Despite its 
length, it never loses focus, 
a testament to Rosenstock’s 
growth as an artist. “Please be 

honest / Tell me was it you?” 
he pleads, a vague question 
which 
we 
can 
assume 
is 

directed at potential Trump 
voters. The song closes with 
a chorus of voices crying “Et 
tu, USA?” an allusion to Julius 
Caesar’s final words — “Et tu, 
Brute?” — upon having been 
killed by someone he thought 
to be a friend. Rosenstock’s 
borrowing 
of 
the 
phrase 

parallels 
that 
sentiment, 

reflecting the betrayal that 
Rosenstock, among countless 
others, felt on November 8, 
2016.

Rosenstock 
goes 
on 
to 

acknowledge that technology 
is 
suffocating 
us 
on 

“Powerlessness.” “Meet me at 
the Polish bar / I’ll be the one 
looking at my phone / Shaking 
like a nervous kid / Absolutely 
terrified of being alone,” he 
sings. He puts up the finger 
at Trump on “Yr Throat,” 

expressing his confusion with 
the presidency: “It’s not like 
any other job I know / If you’re 
a piece of shit they don’t let you 
go.” On closer “Let Them Win,” 
he turns the dejected quality 
of the previous nine songs 
into 
determined 
defiance. 

Though there’s still a hint of 
hopelessness as Rosenstock 
lists his grievances — “They 
can hang us out to dry / They 
can profit from their lies again 
/ They can shake our souls 
/ They can send us home” — 
he ends the album shouting, 
“We’re not gonna let them win 
/ We’re not gonna let them 
win / Fuck no.” Let’s hope he’s 
right.

Jon-Erik Kellso Quartet 
stays true to classic jazz

Modern 
jazz 
audiences 

rarely get the chance to hear 
early 
20th 
century 
jazz. 

While many ensembles play 
pieces from this time period, 
few remain authentic to this 
style of playing. Fewer, still, 
perform 
concerts 
entirely 

devoted to music of this era 
and its many subgenres.

Jon-Erik Kellso, however, 

is 
not 
your 
average 
jazz 

musician. 
His 
performance 

with his namesake quartet at 
the Kerrytown Concert House 
last Saturday was comprised 
entirely 
of 
early 
jazz 
by 

notable greats, such as Louis 
Armstrong and Irving Berlin. 
His knowledge of these early 
jazz musicians was on display 
throughout the evening, and 
it was a pleasure to watch this 
master go about his craft.

Kellso began the evening 

with a couple of slower pieces 
such as Louis Armstrong’s 
“New Orleans Stomp.” Kellso’s 
simple, relaxed playing style 
during these opening numbers 

set the mood for the rest of the 
evening — this concert was 
about four extremely talented 
musicians 
playing 
together 

for fun. The intimacy of the 
Kerrytown 
Concert 
House 

also gave this performance an 
unassuming and light nature. 
It felt as though one was 
witnessing a dialogue rather 
than 
attending 
a 
concert. 

The talents of the musicians 
were almost swallowed by the 
intimacy of the experience, 
almost as though one were 
listening to a recording of early 
jazz music and not witnessing 

POST-

Jefff Rosestock

Polyvinyl

A call to arms, the 

album itself is a 
passionate plea to 
end complacency.

a live performance.

As Kellso explained it during 

the show, this was a concert 
of four musicians that he had 
played with since the ’80s. 
As the night progressed, the 
complementary skills of these 
four musicians continued to 
exceed 
expectations. 
They 

were obviously enjoying each 
other’s 
company, 
pushing 

one another in every piece to 
perform better than the last.

The abilities of pianist Jim 

Dapogny, for example, were 
on display in solos throughout 
the night. Dapogny is known 

as being among the foremost 
experts on Jelly Roll Morton, 
and 
his 
performance 
of 

Morton’s 
“Good 
Old 
New 

York” 
was 
unsurprisingly 

authentic and enjoyable. At 
another point, Kellso asked 
Dapogny to perform a piece 
“without 
the 
trumpet.” 

Dapogny 
improvised 
an 

impressive five-minute blues 
piece that modulated between 
five different keys.

Bassist Kurt Krahnke and 

drummer 
Pete 
Siers 
also 

shone in solos throughout the 
night. Krahnke, in particular, 
seemed right at home while 
soloing, at one point over four 
or five choruses. Siers excelled 
during 
the 
many 
sections 

of trading fours (short solo 

passages of four measures 
traded between the trumpet 
player 
and 
the 
drummer) 

throughout 
the 
night, 

particularly during “I’m Sorry 
That I Made You Cry.” While 
delegated to a background 
role during this concert, these 
two could, and did, hold their 
own throughout the night.

The ensemble also switched 

between 
different 
early 

jazz styles, playing ballads, 
standards and blues charts. 
Kellso’s love for the New 
Orleans style of jazz was 
another frequent feature of 
the night. Provided mainly 
by Siers, this New Orleans 
feel was given to many of 
the Armstrong tunes that 
Kellso chose. At one point, 
Kellso even explained his 
love of New Orleans culture, 
explaining that he visits New 
Orleans nearly every summer 
and that it feels like “another 
home” to him.

Later in the set, Kellso 

demonstrated his skills with 
faster swing pieces from the 
early 20th century jazz idiom. 
Irving Berlin’s “My Walking 
Stick” 
felt 
quite 
relaxed 

despite being played quickly. 
The fast tempo was barely 
noticeable given the comfort 
that the ensemble seemed to 
possess playing at any tempo.

At no point throughout the 

night did it seem as though the 
musicians were falling behind 
the 
music, 
though 
there 

were some brief moments of 
confusion and misdirection, 
particularly at the ends of a 
couple of the pieces. These 
moments, 
however, 
were 

handled 
with 
grace 
— 
a 

slight hesitation at the end 
of “Hindustan,” for example, 
was quickly seized by the 
other musicians as a repeat of 
the last portion of the melody. 
Occasional spoken directions 

from 
Kellso 
demonstrated 

the improvised nature of this 
concert and the ensemble’s 
almost uncanny ability to 
work together and anticipate 
each other’s moves.

The ensemble’s easygoing, 

humorous atmosphere made 

the night quite enjoyable. 
Kellso 
offered 
background 

information 
before 
almost 

every 
piece, 
occasionally 

adding jokes and puns, as 
well. Before “Hindustan,” for 
example, Kellso quipped that 
“hopefully it’s not somewhere 
we’re invading anytime soon.”

Unlike 
many 
other 

musicians, 
the 
quartet 

resisted 
updating 
the 

rhythmic 
and 
harmonic 

language of this time period 
to meet that of today. This 
concert was nothing more 
than early jazz played very 
well by a group of immensely 
talented musicians.

Strokes of pen and water: 
Casey Barrett at Literati

What do an author and 

an Olympic athlete have in 
common? They are enduring 
a constant uphill battle to 
success. Both the path of a 
successful 
Olympic 
athlete 

and an author 
are 
extremely 

difficult, 
regimented 
and 
time-

consuming. 
However, author 
and 
Olympic 

swimmer Casey 
Barrett has been 
able to achieve 
both in his 42 
years — having 
both 
published 

a 
novel 
and 

competed as a 
Canadian swimmer in the 
2002 Olympics.

Despite the fact that to 

the 
naked 
eye 
swimming 

and writing are not similar 
in any way, Barrett would 
disagree with this statement. 
“The discipline and lifestyle 
of swimming and writing is 
almost exactly the same,” he 
wrote in an email interview 
with The Daily. “So much so 

that I’m baffled there aren’t 
more 
former 
swimmers 

who’ve become fiction writers 
... My ideal writing routine is 
pretty much identical to my 
old training schedule: I do my 
best writing between 5:30a - 
7:30a in the morning, and then 
in the late afternoon between 
3:30p.m. - 6p.m. I suppose 
that’s when my body & mind 
have always worked best.”

Barrett was serious about 

swimming for much of his 
adolescent life, going on to 
swim in college as well as 
professionally. He has not 
swam in over 20 years, having 
dedicated his life to his family, 
his writing and his business, 
Imagine Swimming.

In 2002, Barrett co-founded 

Imagine Swimming, Inc., a 
school that sets out to teach 

thousands 
of 

students between 
the ages of six 
months and 12 
years 
how 
to 

swim 
at 
pools 

across 
New 

York. In addition 
to 
education, 

Imagine 
Swimming 
oversees a swim 
team, 
water 

polo 
team 
and 

a 
synchronized 

swimming team.

On his career path and 

accomplishments, 
Barrett 

claims: “I was restless and 
ambitious, 
and 
seemed 
to 

thrive on change. I ‘got into’s 
wimming like most kids — 
showed a bit of talent in a 
summer league; a coach or 
some other parents mentioned 
year-round teams to my mom 
& dad; I liked working hard; 
became hooked on improving; 
success & ambition fed on 
themselves ... Until it became 
my entire identity.”

Despite 
the 
fact 
that 

swimming 
has 
been 
an 

important part of his identity, 
he claims that he “moved to 
NYC to get away from that 
swimmer’s life.” His life went 
from swimming to publishing, 
as he studied print journalism 
at the University of Southern 
California 
and 
Southern 

Methodist 
University. 

However, through all this, he 
always knew that he wanted 
to become a fiction writer on 
his own terms.

In 
2006, 
with 
an 

infatuation for crime fiction, 
Barrett embarked on a life 
changing journey — penning 
his first novel, one of an 
anticipated 
series 
titled 

“UNDER 
WATER.” 
He 

began by accepting a private 
apprenticeship 
in 
crime 

fiction for about five years. To 
this process he noted, “I read 
as much as I possibly could in 
the genre, knowing that was 
where I was headed. Then, 
at some point around 2012 or 
so, I realized that the reading 
could (and would) go on 
forever, and that I was ready 

to write confidently in my 
chosen ‘field’.” Because of his 
background in Olympic sports 
and his previous writing on 
his blog “Cap & Goggles,” he 
knew that the plot line began 
with the sexual abuse that has 
affected swimming and other 
Olympic sports.

The path of a previous 

Olympic athlete and the path 
of a committed fiction author 
seem to really intertwine 
here, creating a wonderful 
melody 
between 
the 
two 

subjects. 
Often, 
we 
see 

Olympic 
athletes 
finishing 

their athletic career to write 
a memoir, short stories, a 
biography or other nonfiction 
works. That being said, it is 

incredibly refreshing to see 
a 
former 
Olympic 
athlete 

creating 
works 
of 
fiction 

roughly based on his other 
passion — swimming.

As 
a 
very 
committed 

individual in two different 
fields, 
Barrett 
has 
many 

incredible and special life 
experiences 
despite 
his 

young age. When asked what 
advice he has for aspiring 
Olympic athletes and authors, 
Barrett replied: “All it takes is 
committing your entire life to 
it. If you’re not willing to step 
off the ledge and lose your 
mind doing it, don’t bother.”

Barrett will be having an 

event at Literati bookstore 
to read and discuss his new 
novel 
“Under 
Water” 
on 

Wednesday, January 10th at 
7 PM.

With third installment 
‘Pitch Perfect’ falls flat 

For a film series that began 

with 
a 
classic 

message 
about 

finding 
oneself 

in 
college 
and 

learning to make 
the 
most 
of 

your talents, it’s 
disconcerting 
to 

say the least that 
the final film in 
the trilogy begins 
not just with the 
obligatory 
song 

and dance, but also 
with an exploding 
yacht. It seems unlikely that 
there are many “Pitch Perfect” 
fans that wanted to see their 
favorite fictional a cappella 
group in the plot of a bad James 
Bond movie, and audience 
members 
that 
weren’t 
on 

board with the franchise thus 
far will hardly be convinced 
by the new direction. “Pitch 
Perfect 3,” directed by Trish 
Sie (“Step Up: All In”) and 
featuring returning stars Anna 
Kendrick 
(“Trolls”), 
Rebel 

Wilson (“Bridesmaids”) and 
Hailee Steinfeld (“The Edge of 
Seventeen”), spends its two-
hour runtime destroying any 
sense of goodwill the audience 
may 
have 
had 
for 
these 

characters and solidifies the 
series’ fate as a forgotten relic 
that remains at the bottom of 
the five dollar Walmart bin. 

From the opening sequence 

that 
seemingly 
trades 
in 

musical hijinks for low-budget 
spy parody, the film rapidly 
descends 
into 
a 
mockery 

of itself. The plot (so much 

as 
there 
is 

one) 
revolves 

around 
the 

Barton Bellas’s 
trip 
across 

Europe 
while 

performing 
at 

United 
States 

army 
bases 

in an attempt 
to 
convince 

DJ 
Khaled 
to 

make 
them 

the 
opening 

act of his next 

show. If that premise sounds 
silly on paper, it’s even more 
preposterous on screen, with 
Khaled strolling through the 
picture for a number of cameos 
that feel not only tacked on, but 
also like they were filmed in 
the span of a day or two. While 
the audience is continually 
reminded by the script every 
few minutes that almost all 
of the Bellas have romantic 
interests in someone in another 
band, the film stumbles and 
trips through these storylines 
in a fashion reminiscent of a 
poor game of darts. There’s a 
lot being thrown at the wall 
here, but almost none of it 
sticks. 

For 
what 
it’s 
worth, 

Kendrick is still the highlight 
of these movies, and her arc, 
although 
incredibly 
similar 

to her storyline from “Pitch 

Perfect 2,” is in fact the only 
part of the movie with any 
kind of emotional resonance 
whatsoever. Even the most 
coldhearted 
of 
individuals 

will find it hard not to smile 
when the gang at last gets their 
big reunion song on stage 
at the end. It doesn’t strike 
nearly as strong a chord as it 
might have if the movie was 
actually a good or even decent 
meditation on leaving your 
college friends and safe life on 
campus behind yet still trying 
desperately to keep in touch 
with that part of yourself, but 
“Pitch Perfect 3” simply isn’t 
up to that challenge. 

Even the once-exciting a 

cappella numbers feel forced 
here, serving only to remind 
the audience of better scenes in 
better films. The film overall 
suffers from the feeling that 
it was totally and completely 
unnecessary. 
There 
isn’t 

really much of a story left 
to tell for the Bellas, and it 
shows here, with the movie 
falling quickly into the kind 
of hollow narrative structure 
that reeks of late ’90s sequels. 
An early rendition of the 
riff-off competition (one of 
the highlights of the first 
two films) feels completely 
lifeless and perfunctory here. 
It’s easy to see that scene as 
a metaphor for the film as a 
whole. The Bellas fall totally 
flat against the competition. 
Like the “Pitch Perfect” film 
franchise, all of their best days 
are behind them.

Barnes Arico’s Achilles’ Heel

I

t’s been a week of ups and 
downs for Kim Barnes 
Arico.

The jux-

taposition of 
the Michigan 
women’s bas-
ketball coach’s 
week was 
clearest on 
Sunday. Prior 
to the game 
against No. 
10 Ohio State, 
Barnes Arico 
was awarded a jersey with the 
number 124; this 
recognized her 
becoming the 
program’s win-
ningest coach a 
few days earlier 
against Wiscon-
sin.

Over the next 

few hours, the 
Wolverines lost 
a back-and-forth 
overtime game 
to the Buckeyes. 
To throw salt in the wound, 
the teams traded the lead nine 
times in the fourth quarter 
alone, and Michigan held a 

two-point lead with under 20 
seconds to go.

“I’m really super bummed 

we came out on the short side 
of it,” Barnes Arico said. “We 
had every opportunity down 
the stretch to win that game.”

Yes, it was close and Michi-

gan played well, but they lost to 
the Buckeyes.

Again.
Despite her overall success 

in Ann Arbor, she’s struggled to 
beat her rival from Columbus. 
She is 2-6 all-time against Ohio 
State and has lost her last four 

matchups.

And for bet-

ter or worse, 
when you coach 
at Michigan, 
everyone from 
Jim Harbaugh 
to Barnes Arico 
is judged on 
rivalry games.

Unfortunate-

ly for Barnes 
Arico, she’s 
struggled in 

these matchups.

Her lack of success against 

school rivals isn’t exclusive to 
Ohio State. When looking at 

her career against Michigan 
State, it’s not much better.

The Wolverines have won 

just three of their 14 matchups 
against the Spartans, boasting 
a .272 win percentage. The last 
time a Barnes Arico team beat 
a Buckeye or Michigan State 
squad was February 2015.

In total, 14 of her 67 career 

loses – or nearly 21 percent – 
have come to either MSU or 
OSU.

And recent matchups have 

been no different. Michigan 
has also lost its last four bouts 
to the Spartans.

The Wolver-

ines should be 
at least some-
what optimistic, 
though, going 
into their next 
matchup against 
Michigan State 
as the Spartans 
lost their all-time 
leading scorer in 
Tori Jankoska to 
the WNBA.

Still, nobody on the current 

Wolverine roster has much 
experience defeating a rival. 
The only players to have beaten 

the Spartans and Ohio State are 
seniors Katelynn Flaherty and 
Jillian Dunston – and those 
wins came three years ago, 
when the duo were freshman.

Despite the school’s and fan 

base’s history of emphasizing 
rivalry games, should Barnes 
Arico be judged for faltering in 
these games?

No. Well, at least not yet. 
In a little over five years, 

Barnes Arico turned a rather 
average team into a constant in 
the national rankings. In the 
year prior to Barnes Arico com-
ing to Michigan, the Wolver-

ines finished 
seventh in the 
Big Ten. Last 
season, they 
finished third. 
She not only 
has the most 
wins in pro-
gram history, 
but also the 
best winning 
percentage at 
.649.

Oh yeah, and she was able to 

do something no other coach in 
program history has ever done 
‚— raise a banner in the Crisler 
Center after a title in the 2017 
WNIT.

Her struggles against the 

rivals shouldn’t be completely 
overlooked. But when consider-
ing that those two teams are 
Michigan State and the Buck-
eyes, consistently two of the 
nation’s toughest teams, it’s 
slightly easier to digest.

Eventually, though, for the 

Wolverines to get to where 
they want to be — a peren-
nial national title contender 
— they’re going to have to beat 
Ohio State, Michigan State and 
other top tier teams.

After all, as the saying goes: 

to be the best, you have to beat 
the best.

That’s the next feat Barnes 

Arico has to conquer.

RUCHITA IYER/Daily

Michigan women’s basketball coach Kim Barnes Arico now needs to prove that she can beat elite teams in the Big Ten.

‘M’ Hockey swept by ND 
despite forceful offense

No. 2 Notre Dame probably 

didn’t expect to have a tough 
weekend.

And, by looking just at the box 

scores of the home-and-home 
series, it handily triumphed over 
Michigan, 2-1, on both Friday and 
Sunday.

What the box scores may not 

have shown, however, was a 
tenacious effort from a steadfast 
Wolverine hockey team committed 
to upping its intensity and effort of 
play.

“That’s how we’ve wanted to do 

it all year is play with that pace and 
that energy and that speed,” said 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson. “We 
have to continue to do that.

“You saw it in spurts in the first 

half, but I think we’re starting to 
get it now. … We’re going to put the 
guys in the lineup who are going to 
play with that pace.”

In 
two 
back-and-forth 

games defined by unpredictable 
opportunities that could have 
shifted the momentum toward 
either foe, Michigan couldn’t find 
any luck.

On Friday, senior forward Tony 

Calderone 
brought 
Michigan 

within one goal of Notre Dame 
in the first period, and Sunday, 
freshman forward Josh Norris did 
the same in the third period.

“I thought these were two of 

our best games all year. We worked 
hard, we blocked shots, we were 
physical, we were fast, we put pucks 
on net,” said sophomore goaltender 
Hayden Lavigne. “ … They’re one 
bounce away, each game, from 
going in the opposite direction.”

But, if the Wolverines were 

generating 
so 
many 
scoring 

opportunities — letting 70 total 
shots fly — why couldn’t they break 
the one-goal barrier that plagued 
them this weekend? How did the 
Fighting Irish score two early goals 
in the same fashion both nights?

A possible answer to both of 

these questions lies in the intent of 

Pearson’s game plan at the outset 
of the series — play with more 
urgency and pace.

Michigan outshot Notre Dame 

14-11 in the first period Friday, and 
15-7 in the second period Sunday, 
with no goals to show for it.

The Wolverines were visibly 

trying to increase their pace of 
play, sending defensemen like 
freshman Quinn Hughes — who 
only played Sunday — and junior 
Nick Boka flying past the blue line 
into the offensive zone to try to 
generate more chances.

In addition to frequent dump-

and-chase plays by the offense, 
Michigan’s strategy was a noble 
one. In order to play against the 
best, it needed to overwhelm them 
with heightened aggression.

While the strategy worked to 

some degree, the Fighting Irish 
were well equipped to deal with a 
fast-paced team.

Notre Dame streamlined their 

attack from goaltender Cale Morris 
to defenseman Jordan Gross to 
forward Jake Evans — all of whom 
entered the series leading the 
NCAA in save percentage, shots on 
goal from a defenseman and points 
(Gross and Evans tied), respectively.

“I think every time you’re out 

there they play as a group, they 
play as five,” Norris said. “I think 
you gotta generate a lot of speed 
and it’s hard to sometimes.”

As the Wolverines pushed 

the puck up the ice with an 
unprecedented amount of urgency, 
Notre Dame was ready to pounce 
back decisively and, as a result, the 
Fighting Irish created numerous 
fast-breaks, and Michigan was left 
skating back on its heels.

What 
ensued 
were 
two 

early Notre Dame goals and a 
subsequent retreat defensively to 
thwart any oncoming Wolverine 
attack.

The takeaway for Michigan 

after this weekend was that it can 
skate with the best, but needs to 
control the chaos generated by 
Pearson’s drive for a high-paced 
attacking team.

Behind Enemy Lines: Sitting down with Boilermaker center Isaac Haas

Michigan State garnered an 

abundance of attention in the 
Big Ten race early in the season 
— and for good reason. But it 
may be easy to forget Purdue 
returned five of its top six scorers 
from a team that won the Big Ten 
regular season title a year ago. 

Taking the brunt of the 

frontcourt 
offensive 
load 

from Caleb Swanigan, Isaac 
Haas 
came 
into 
the 
year 

with 
unapologetically 
high 

expectations. He wants to play in 
the NBA. He thinks he’s as good 
as any big in the country. He feels 
nobody can guard him, and he 
can guard most anybody.

To some extent, the numbers 

bear that out. For the second 
straight year, Haas leads the Big 
Ten in points per 40 minutes. 
He is leading the charge for an 
upstart Boilermaker team that 
is now one of the top five in the 
country, threatening to take 
the Big Ten once again from 
the Spartans. Purdue has wins 
over Louisville, Arizona and 
Butler, among others, on its way 
to a strong 15-2 start. Purdue 
comes to Crisler Center to battle 
Michigan on Tuesday night in 
a matchup that presents the 
Wolverines its greatest challenge 
of the season to date. Haas will 
play a big role in how it turns out.

The Daily sat down with 

Purdue’s 7-foot-2 senior center 
at Big Ten Media Day to discuss 
the 
his 
personal 
progress, 

the Boilermakers’ goals, the 
matchups with Michigan and 
more.

The Michigan Daily: You led 

the conference in points per 40 
minutes last season. What kinds 
of techniques are you doing to 
stay on the floor and stay out of 
foul trouble?

Isaac Haas: Honestly, just 

running a lot. So that way you’re 
not 
making 
tired 
decisions, 

you’re not making tired fouls. 
I think it’s going to provide me 
with a lot more opportunity. 
As 
well 
as 
positioning, 

understanding the game a little 
better, understanding, you know, 
 

‘You’ve been here four years, you 

know what people are going to 
do to you, you know what some 
people aren’t going to do to you.’ 
You need to know how to take 
advantage of that, and sometimes 
when to back off. There are just 
certain points when you need to 
press your advantage and some 
points when you need to back 
off and not get too far ahead of 
yourself.

TMD: What do you think 

might be your potential this year 
if you are able to increase your 
minutes and stay on the court?

IH: I think the potential is 

through the roof, in my opinion. 
In other’s minds they may not see 
it the same way. It’s just a matter 
of going out and proving what I 
can do and helping my team win. 
That’s all that matters. 

TMD: What do you think you 

need to improve upon most to 
play in the NBA?

IH: I think there’s multiple 

things. It’s never just one thing 
with somebody. It’s all a matter 
of conditioning, rebounding and 
being a better defensive player. 
My defense on the perimeter 
used to be a weakness. The more 
I work on it, the better I’m going 
to get on it. All I’ve been working 
on lately is my conditioning, 
rebounding 
and 
perimeter 

defense.

TMD: When you’re playing a 

team like Michigan that spaces 
the floor a lot, and with you being 
a traditional big, what kinds of 
challenges does that present to 
you?

IH: Well, obviously it presents 

a challenge of lateral quickness. 
That’s 
something 
I’ve 
been 

working on a lot, especially after 
training with the NBA, kinda 
getting better from that whole 
experience. I do understand 
that there’s a lot of things I 
need to work on. I worked with 
a trainer and now my lateral 
quickness is a lot better. I know 
that I’m shutting some of these 
guys (teammates) down on the 
perimeter now. The goal is, if I 
can shut them down, I can pretty 
much shut anybody down, except 
for the select few who are just 
so top-class. It’s just a matter of 
corralling them, keeping them in 
front and making sure that I play 
solid defense and making them 
make a tough shot.

TMD: So do you think you can 

shut down Moe Wagner?

IH: I think I can shut down 

just about anybody, it’s just a 
matter of doing it.

TMD: Against Michigan, you 

guys played some entertaining, 
back-and-forth games. What do 
you take away from those games 
last year as you look toward 
those matchups this year?

IH: I’d just say, it’s going to 

be competitive, they’ve got guys 
coming back. Obviously they 
lost (DJ Wilson), he was a big 
factor. But I also know that you 
got more recruits. John Beilein is 
a great coach, who’s going to get 
those guys playing together. And 
I know it’s going to be a tough 
challenge for us, but I’m looking 
forward to it. 

TMD: You hear a lot about 

Michigan State going in (to the 
season), the media’s presumptive 
favorite. 
Do 
you 
guys 
feel 

slighted at all that you’re not in 
that conversation? 

IH: I think it doesn’t matter. 

I think it’s going to be a matter 
of who’s going to win and who 
doesn’t. I think they’re obviously 
very talented. I think they have 
the potential to do great things. 
But it’s just a matter of stepping 
up, understanding that just 
because we won doesn’t mean 
anything this year. It’s still 0-0 
across the board. That’s why you 
see none of us wearing our rings 
here today because we don’t 
care. We’re happy that we won, 
but we don’t care. This is a new 
year and we’re trying to win 
another one.

Michigan set to take on No. 5 Purdue Tuesday

The Michigan men’s basketball 

team has found a groove.

The Wolverines (3-1 Big Ten, 

14-3 overall) haven’t lost since 
their 
early-December 
collapse 

to Ohio State, racking up seven 
consecutive wins — including 
ones over Iowa and Illinois last 
week.

Freshman 

forward 
Isaiah 

Livers has gone 
from 
virtually 

invisible on the 
floor to a key spark 
in 
Michigan’s 

offense since the 
holiday break — 
as has sophomore 
point 
guard 

Zavier 
Simpson. 

And 
with 

guards 
Charles 

Matthews and Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-Rahkman 
continuing 

the productivity that led the 
Wolverines early on, the team has 
started to take form.

But there’s no shortage of 

looming danger to threaten that 
notion.

Michigan will face No. 5 Purdue 

and No. 4 Michigan State on 

Tuesday and Saturday this week, 
first at Crisler Center then in East 
Lansing, respectively — easily the 
Wolverines’ most daunting two-
game stretch.

“We got quite a week (ahead),” 

said Michigan coach John Beilein. 
“I really think that Michigan State 
and Purdue are two of the top five 
teams in the country. I think they 
can beat anyone in the country 
at any time on any court. We’re 

playing 
them 

back-to-back, 
and it’s really a 
challenge for us.

“They’d 
be 

huge for us if we 
can win any of 
these games and 
then continue to 
win.”

The 

Boilermakers 
(4-0, 15-2) have 
won their last 11 

games, surging into top-ten spots 
of national polls this week with a 
shooting percentage and defensive 
efficiency that rank near the top of 
the conference.

Purdue is averaging a scoring 

output of 86 points, led by guard 
Carsen Edwards and center Isaac 
Haas, who average 16.7 and 14.7 
points per game, respectively.

When asked about advice for 

junior center Mortiz Wagner in 
guarding the 7-foot-2, 290-pound 
Haas, Beilein had a simple answer.

“Good luck.”
That’s the type of challenge 

that the Boilermakers’ size brings. 
Along with 7-foot-3 freshman 
Matt Haarms and multi-talented 
forward Vincent Edwards, Purdue 
boasts one of the most effective 
frontcourts in the country.

“We’re 
not 

going to concede 
any 
baskets,” 

Beilein 
said. 

“(But) there are 
some times we’re 
just 
not 
gonna 

be able to stop 
it. 
(Haarms) 
is 

bigger than Haas 
— 
and 
longer. 

You’ve got to stay 
one step ahead of 
the passes. … They 
find ways to get the ball inside.”

That will certainly challenge 

a traditionally weaker side of 
Beilein-coached teams, defensive 
rebounding.

But this season, despite starting 

the 
comparatively 
undersized 

Wagner and fifth-year senior 
Duncan Robinson in the front 
court, that hasn’t been as much of 

an issue.

And against a lengthy Illinois 

team, the Wolverines held their 
own, surrendering just six second-
chance points Saturday.

“We’ve had some guys become 

so good at boxing out, but for 
whatever reasons we’ve been 
better,” Beilein said. “We’ve had 
some guys stand around and could 
never do it. We’ve got some guys 
who are really good at getting in 

front and getting 
the ball.

“I particularly 

love the way Moe 
is 
rebounding 

the 
ball 
right 

now. He’s getting 
people out of his 
area, 
keeping 

balls alive — those 
are big things.”

Speaking 
of 

Wagner, 
the 

Wolverines’ 

leading 
rebounder 
is 
slowly 

working back to normal after a 
foot injury that sidelined him for 
two games in December. Wagner 
blocked three shots Saturday — 
again displaying the defensive 
improvement NBA scouts wanted 
to see when he returned to school 
for another year.

And after scoring just four 

points last Tuesday at Iowa, 
Wagner 
assembled 
a 
strong 

14-point, 
seven-rebound 

performance against the Fighting 
Illini.

But 
achieving 
those 
sorts 

of numbers will be far more 
challenging against Purdue.

“You can’t get an easy shot 

(against them),” Beilein said. 
“They’ve got the whole package 
now. They’re a beautiful basketball 
team.”

Recently, Michigan has also 

looked like more of a complete 
package. Now, it’s time for the 
Wolverines to prove that against 
the country’s best.

“(It’s a) huge challenge,” Livers 

said, “I know a lot of teams lost 
(last week), and Purdue is moving 
up in the rankings. We’re just 
getting ready for the war.”

Boilermaker Vincent Edwards could give Wolverines matchup issues

The 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball team has a challenge 
ahead of it on 
Tuesday.

No. 5 Purdue 

comes 
to 

Ann Arbor in 
what is likely 
Michigan’s 
toughest 
matchup 
to 

this 
point. 

With that being 
said, there are 
plenty of things 
that need to go 
right 
for 
the 

Wolverines 
to 

win the game.

One 
in 

particular, 
though, 
is 

matching up with Boilermaker 
forward Vincent Edwards. 

Michigan coach John Beilein 

made no bones about it at his 
press conference Monday. He 
believes 
that 
Edwards 
may 

present even more of a problem 
than former Purdue forward 
Caleb Swanigan did for the 
Wolverines last season.

“(Swanigan) was a really 

great player,” Beilein said. “He 
gave us so many problems. At 
the same time, the way we play, 
with four guys that go, that 
presented matchup problems for 
them at times. Caleb’s so good, 
so I don’t want to say that’s 
why we won, but it’s different 
now. They have our type of ‘4’-
man. … (Edwards) is that ‘4’ who 
can play. He can guard another 
tough ‘4’, and he can guard on 
the perimeter as well, if you 
have more of a skilled ‘4.’ ”

Of course, Beilein neglected 

to give the scouting report 
on how the Wolverines plan 
to attack Edwards, but he did 
say 
that 
freshman 
forward 

Isaiah Livers, fifth-year senior 
forward 
Duncan 
Robinson 

or redshirt sophomore guard 
Charles Matthews could match 

up with him.

Livers is excited for the 

potential responsibility.

“He told me in film yesterday,” 

Livers said. “He said, ‘Isaiah, 
you have a big challenge. This 
guy is kinda just a replicate 
of you. Just, he has a lot more 
experience than you.’ And I was 
like, ‘Great, Coach. Now I can 
see where I’m at.’ So I’m looking 
forward to it.”

The freshman has perhaps 

improved the most of any 
Michigan player this season, 
and Tuesday’s matchup with 
Edwards could be the next 
benchmark for just how far he’s 

come, 
especially 
considering 

that the Wolverines have been 
hurt by dynamic ‘4’-men in the 
past.

In 
their 
loss 
to 
North 

Carolina, one of the major 
pitfalls was the production of 
the Tar Heels’ ‘4’-man, Luke 
Maye. Whether it was Robinson 
or Livers guarding Maye, they 
seemingly had no answer, as he 
lit them up for 27 points.

Livers remembers that game, 

but he believes the defense has 
come a long way since then, and 
he sees the game against Purdue 
as a potential yard stick for 
where Michigan stands.

“That was like an early test 

for us,” Livers said. “So I think 
that’s gonna help translate over 
to our game tomorrow. I’m 
excited to see where we are.”

Beilein and Livers will both 

admit the freshman has a long 
way to go. Beilein has taken 
special care in aiding Livers’ 
growth, because he sees his 
athletic ability and realizes 
that, with the right coaching, he 
could really turn into something 
special. Beilein has said that 
he typically spends 15 minutes 
with Livers after practices to 
sharpen his skillset.

He says one of the next 

steps for Livers to take is 
improvement 
in 
corralling 

defensive 
rebounds. 
That’s 

another area where Tuesday’s 
matchup can be a barometer 
of progress. Edwards leads his 
team with 8.6 rebounds per 
game — 2.8 of which coming on 
the offensive end.

Illinois 
was 
a 
prolific 

offensive 
rebounding 
team 

entering its game with the 
Wolverines last week. Beilein 
thought his team did well to 
hold them to just 10 offensive 
rebounds, since three of them 
were late in the game.

Edwards 
is 
a 
different 

animal, though. For whoever 
guards him, whether it’s Livers, 
Robinson or even Matthews, 
a new level of production and 
focus will be needed.

“It’s gonna be tough,” Beilein 

said. “We talked about that a 
lot today, about, as the game 
goes on, what we do. Once 
again, Duncan’s done a great 
job for us over there. His 
defensive numbers the other 
day were really good, but Isaiah 
continues to be that guy that 
will continue to be there. And 
then, play Duncan more at a 
natural position if we feel the 
need to.”
