Ann Arbor, MI


By MAX BULTMAN
Daily Sports Writer
Natalie Harper just wanted to
take a picture.
She and her family were in town
for the 2010 Michigan football
spring game and decided to check
out a softball game afterward.
When the family arrived at
Alumni Field, Natalie went down
by the fence to try to snap a shot of
the players.
But she couldn't quite get her
camera to work. Seeing then-six-
year-old Natalie struggling with
her mom's camera phone, Roya St.
Clair - a senior catcher at the time
- walked over to lend a hand.
Once Natalie had her picture, St.
Clair handed the beaming young
girl a softball and told her where to
wait after the game. She promised
that if Natalie was there when the
game was over, she would take her
around and help her get each player
to sign the ball.

St. Clair didn't know it at the coach Carol Hutchins decided to

for more softball. So the Harpers
have made the trek to Ann Arbor
for nearly every home game since
2010, if her health allows.
But after a while, as Natalie's
greetings became a part of the
post-game routine, Michigan

By the time Luetkens joined the
team in 2011, greeting Natalie was
embedded into the team's routine.
Even before she earned locker
room and dugout access, Natalie
had stolen Luetkens' heart with
her zest for life and positivity.
"As soon as she came up to me
and just wanted me to hang out
with her, and just opened up, she
grabbed my heart," Luetkens said.
"She's been my sister ever since."
When Natalie runs on the field,
it's with Luetkens. When Luetkens
draws Mickey Mouse in the dirt
before games, Natalie is respon-
sible for the ears. And when Luet-
kens gets introduced, she's right
behind her.
According to Hutchins, there
isn't a better person on the team for
Natalie to spend time with.
"Katie Luetkens really knows
how to make you feel special," she
said.
When Luetkens talks about Nat-
alie, she glows with excitement. It's
clear that that this isn't lip service

or charity. Luetkens has a sister in
Natalie, and Natalie has one in her.
"I never wanted her to feel
like she was a burden, or that she
couldn't do anything we could do,"
Luetkens said. "She's special and
I want her to have a good experi-
ence. Sometimes she'll be tired
and ask for a piggyback ride, and I
never say no.I know she loves it."
There have been times, though,
when Luetkens has gotten caught
up in a game and lost track of Nata-
lie in the dugout.
"One time," Luetkens recalls,
"she went up to (Hutchins in the
middle of a pressure situation),
and just said, 'It's OK, Hutch. Don't
worry about it.' I was like, 'Oh no ...
I lost track of her,' but (Hutchins)
just turned around and laughed."
Back home in Indiana, Natalie
has just started playing softball.
So far, her favorite position is
catcher.
Physically, she's not up to the
size of most girls her age, but she
does seem to have one huge advan-
tage over her teammates.
"I think she has picked up on
stuff that Hutchins tells the team,"
said Natalie's mom, Courtney
Harper. "He'll ask them what they
should do in a situation, and Nata-
lie will say,'Well, I do this and this
person does that' Her coach came
up to me and was like, 'I'm not the
one teaching her that."'
As a bat girl for Michigan, Nata-
lie is tasked with collecting the
bat from the hitter in the on-deck
circle before she steps to the plate.
Another, though, is much more
suited to her bubbling personality
- her daily joke that she tells the
team before each game.
The team eagerly listens to the
jokes and lets out a loud "ahhhh" in

unison after each one.
After one game, when Natalie
was taking pictures with the play-
ers, the players would ask her when
they would next get to see her.
"I'm not sure," Natalie would
say. "I want to go (to the next game,
at Purdue), but I'm not sure."
The players then would turn to
Courtney and Danny Harper, like
an elementary-school kid does to
their friends' parents begging for a
sleepover, with the same question.
"We're seeing if it will work,"
they would say, over and over.
"There's never a time that she's
around that we aren't just glow-
ing," Luetkens said. "When she
isn't there, we really miss her."
Luetkens graduated from the
University on May 10, but Natalie
will still be here next year. That's
been one of the hardest thoughts
for Luetkens to deal with - now
she's goingto miss Natalie.
It will be hard for Natalie too,
but a new group of new faces will
enter the dugout next year, and
they will all get used to seeing her
bright smile at every home game.
"Honestly, she doesn't even tell
us about the dugout," Courtney
said. "That's her special place, and
those are her sisters. She keeps it
close to her sleeve."
Now that the Wolverines have
won the regular-season Big Ten
Championship, they will add a new
picture to their wall of conference
championships teams. All of those
pictures look mostly the same,
except the one from 2013. That one
has a small bright-faced girl light-
ingup the front row, posing right in
front of Luetkens.
Natalie didn't need to take a pic-
ture of that moment.
She was right in the middle of it.

Journalist
discusses
poverty
and gender
Sheryl WuDunn
headlines multi-day
Women and Economic
Security conference
By MARGO LEVY
For the Daily
Over 100 people gathered at Rack-
ham Auditorium Wednesday evening
to hear Pulitzer Prize-winning jour-
nalist Sheryl WuDunn's take on wom-
en's poverty as part of the Women and
Economic Security Conference.
WuDunn shared her experiences
traveling to some of the world's most
impoverished places, and detailed
what she discovered to be poverty's
worst effects. She said she believes
the oppression of women is a dire
issue worldwide, which results in
problems including a lack of educa-
tion, sex trafficking and maternal
mortality, among others.
By providing the audience with
names and pictures of people affect-
ed by these challenges, WuDunn
grounded her talk in the people she's
met and place she's experienced
around the world.
WuDunn displayed a photo of a
group of young girls - all victims of
sex trafficking - that she met during
her time in Cambodia while discuss-
ing a challenge she said she equates to
modern day slavery.
"They are forced to work 14 hour
days, seven days a week and they
are not paid a dime," WuDunn said.
"What does that sound like? Slavery."
While WuDunn said she does
not necessarily have a solution for
the problems she discovered, she
hopes that by spreading awareness,
more people will feel inclined to get
involved.

University helps
faculty explore
their disciplines
outside of A2
By STEPHANIE SHENOUDA
ManagingEditor
While spring and sum-
mer semesters are typically
an opportunity for students to
pursue their interests outside of
the classroom, the University's
Michigan Road Scholar Tour
program allowed 30 faculty
and staff to explore the state of
Michigan last week.
In its fifteenth year, the MRS
program aims to connect the
University teaching body with
people working in various fields
- including education reform,
medicine and organic farming -

and open their eyes to the places
in-state students hail from with
which they might not otherwise
be familiar.
The group's five-day tour
included a trip to the General
Motors plant in Lansing, the
Grand Rapids Medical Institute,
the tribal lands of Gun Lake, a
factory in Kalkaska and a clinic
for the poor in Traverse City. The
professors also visited a com-
munity college in Petoskey, an
organic farm in Sault Ste. Marie,
high school students in Midland
and leaders of the Detroit-based
nonprofit, Focus: HOPE.
Jim Kosteva, community rela-
tions director for the University's
office of government relations,
said the program works to pro-
vide outreach opportunities
for the faculty and staff with
regards to economics, govern-
ment, culture, health and other
aspects of life that may be differ-

ent from Ann Arbor's. It aims to
foster an inclusive environment
among colleagues and encour-
age collaboration and interdisci-
plinary activities between those
whose interests might not nor-
mally overlap.
"The MRS program is kind of
a five day orientation to the state
of Michigan, to help University
professors to better understand
the environment and education
as a public university and how
we fit in and contribute to public
service," Kosteva said.
He added that currently "rela-
tively few" number of universi-
ties or colleges offer programs
similar to MRS, though it was
modeled after other schools, and
the University does not claim to
have conceptualized the pro-
gram.

turer Mark Conger said he espe-

Bike sharing program
announces kiosk sites

nUoY VVALLAU/Daily
Pulitzer Prize Sheryl WuDunn speaks during the Women and Economic Security
Conference at Rackham Auditorium Wednesday.

SPEAKER
From Page 1
University's Center for the Educa-
tion of Women and Re:Gender, an
organization formerly called the
National Council for Research on
Women. Her talk concluded the
first day of a three-day confer-
ence, which aims to identify and
discuss barriers for impoverished
women seeking financial security.
Gloria Thomas, CEW director,
said the conference was intend-
ed to be a catalyst for discus-
sion among students and faculty
regarding poverty and its implica-
tions worldwide.
"For this initiative and this
week's related conference, CEW
is serving as the convener of

scholars, activists, social service
agencies and their clients living in
poverty, policy makers and other
interested parties who are com-
mitted to establishing policy rec-
ommendations at the state level to
help women," Thomas said.
Though University students
may never witness these atroci-
ties firsthand, She added that it's
important they have an under-
standing of their existence and
what can be done.
"While WuDunn's talk (had)
an international focus - particu-
larly regarding policies and prac-
tices to address these issues - the
intent is for conference attendees
to have a broad understanding of
what's being done to eliminate
poverty worldwide in order to
inspire and enable us all to think
globally but act locally."

Cycle pick-up
stations are set to
launch in July at
several locations
By ALLANA AKHTAR
Daily News Editor
Cyclists, grab a helmet.
By July, University students will
have access to public bikes in an
effort to add cycling to daily com-
mutes.
ArborBike, in partnership with
the Ann Arbor City Council, the
Ann Arbor-based nonprofit Clean
Energy Coalition and the Universi-
ty are in the final stages of initiating
the citywide bike share program.
In the latest step toward launch-
ing the program, the organization
has launched a map of the 14 future
kiosk stations where riders can rent
a bicycle.
A few are near University aca-
demic buildings, including one on
State Street by the Modern Lan-
guages Building, one on South Uni-
versity by the School of Social Work
and one on East Madison Street
near the Michigan Union.
There are also stations close to
popular downtown areas. Kiosks
near the Main Street hub include a
station on the intersection of Main
Street and Washington Street near
Cafe Zola and a station on East
Huron Street bythe Ann Arbor City
Council building. There is another
kiosk planned for Fifth Avenue
close to the Ann Arbor Farmers
Market in Kerrytown.
The Medical Center and Michi-
gan Stadium will have stations
nearby. North Campus will also
have kiosks on Hubbard Road and
near the Cooley Laboratory.
Lisa Solomon, business ana-
lyst for University Parking and
Transportation Services, said the

campus. She stressed that the pro-
gram is not ideal for long, trans-city
trips, but would aid people who
were looking to get to nearby des-
tinations faster or finish up the last
leg of a bus journey.
"It offers an alternative for get-
tingaround," Solomon said. "People
wouldn't use their car, for example,
if they needed to run out for lunch."
Interested users have the choice
of buying membership cards of one
day for $6, one week for $20 or one
year for $65. Members then have
access to the public bikes around
the city for 30 to 60 minutes at a
time. Bikers face fees if they return
bikes after one hour of use to help
keep as many bikes in circulation as
possible.
The bikes come with a small bas-
ket, front and rear lights and a chain
lock. ArborBike said they would
fund and facilitate all bike repairs.
Bike-sharing businesses have
opened with success across the
nation, in areas such as Washington
D.C., Portland, Oregon and in the
Manhattan and Brooklyn boroughs
of New York City.
In 2011, University President
Mary Sue Coleman gave a speech
to students on improving sustain-
ability through University funded
transportation and emission reduc-
tion projects. She specifically sug-
gested a bike sharingsystem around
campus to decrease dependence on
gas-powered vehicles.
The University supported Arbor-
Bike through the process and
donated $600,000 toward opera-
tional costs. The Ann Arbor Area
Transportation Authority and the
Clean Energy Coalition assisted
with start-up funding as well.
Solomon sees great potential in
the enterprise, especially because
of the environmental and wellness
benefits that could result.
"It will enable students, faculty
and staff access to downtown and
campus," Solomon said. "You can
run around easily without fighting
for a parking spot."

By JAKE LOURIM
ManagingSports Editor
More than three months after
the season started in Tampa, Fla.,
all the variables that the Michigan
softball has tried to neutralize -
weather, travel, opponent - are
back in play.
As she has all season, Michigan
coach Carol Hutchins will do her
best to ignore them.
For most of the season, it looked
like the Wolverines would be host-
ing another regional at the Wilpon
Complex in front of their fans,
playing as the favorite. Now, after
finishing 8-6 in their last 14 games,
they must travel more than 2,000
miles southwest to play in triple-
digit temperatures against No. 9
seed Arizona State, which nearly
no-hit Michigan in March.
As far as Hutchins is concerned,
though, the game is the same -
even if the Wolverines will be play-
ing it with ice baths in the dugout
and plenty of water.
Michigan will open regional
play against San Diego State at
12:30 p.m. local time Friday, when
the forecast projects temperatures

Softball opens NCAA play in Tempe

up to 104 degrees. Arizona State
will play Ivy League champion
Dartmouth immediately after.
The winners and losers will play
each other on Saturday in the dou-
ble-elimination format, with the
regional champion being decided
Sunday.
And even though the Wolverines
watched Minnesota celebrate a Big
Ten Tournament championship
last time they were on the field,
the players say they're still going in
confident about their chances.
"I definitely think we have a
chip on our shoulder," said sopho-
more shortstop Sierra Romero.
"We know what Michigan softball
is, and we know what it takes to
play Michigan softball. I think our
mindset is great."
In the final weeks of the season,
when the team struggled, it really
struggled. The Wolverines' occa-
sional inability to make in-game
adjustments has caused several
puzzling results, including a 10-2
road loss to Illinois on April 25 and
a 9-3 home loss to Wisconsin on
May2.
Another case in point: Saturday
night, when Minnesota brought in

senior right-hander Sara Moulton
for the fifth inning of the Big Ten
final. Moulton proceeded to shut
down the Wolverines for the rest
of the game, getting the win when
the Gophers scored on a walk-off
single.
"We're definitely going to take
away our sense of fight and attack
mindset," said senior outfielder
Nicole Sappingfield. "We did really
well against Illinois and Wisconsin
making adjustments, and I think
we could have done a better job of
that in the Minnesota game."
Adjustments will be key this
weekend, when a lackluster effort
could prove costly in a double-
elimination tournament. San
Diego State boasts left-handed
ace Danielle O'Toole, who will
change speeds to keep Michigan
off balance. The Sun Devils have
two 20-win pitchers, right-hand-
ers Dallas Escobedo and Mack-
enzie Popescue, who combine
for a sub-2.00 earned-run aver-
age. Any one of them could give
the Wolverines problems. When
Arizona State played Michigan in
Fullerton, Calif. on March 6, Esc-
obedo twirled a complete-game

one-hitter to beat the Wolverines,
2-0.
But this time of the year, every
team has its strengths - Min-
nesota, for example, eliminat-
ed Michigan with its pitching.
Hutchins said the Wolverines'
strength is their three top pitch-
ers, which keeps the opponent
guessing as to who will start,
while Sappingfield noted the
depth in their lineup.

Hutchins and Sappingfield
downplayed the experience factor
heading into this weekend. Michi-
gan, San Diego State and Arizona
State are all regulars in the NCAA
Tournament, and each has several
seniors who could be playing their
last college game this weekend.
"Our season is basically on the
line these days," Hutchins said
Saturday. "I can't imagine anyone
would be too tired to finish hard."

Three days of waiting by the
phone and watching the TV are
finally over for eight former mem-
bers of the Michigan football team,
which leaves you months to specu-
late before any judgments can be
made.
But after three days, three ath-
letes heard their name called at the
2014 NFL Draft, while five more
were given chances to make teams
as undrafted free agents.
Left tackle Taylor Lewan, select-
ed 11th overall in the first round
Eby the Tennessee Titans, high-
lighted Michigan's picks. Right
tackle Michael Schofield was taken
95th overall in the third round by
the Denver Broncos on the second
day, and the New England Patriots
selected wide receiver Jeremy Gal-
lon was selected with the 244th
pick.
The Daily breaks down each of
the three draft picks before rookie
camps begin in a few short weeks.
Taylor Lewan
What he did: Often defined by
the intensity that left blood run-
ning down his face after plays,
Lewan has shown his grit and con-
sistency by starting 41 consecutive
games. At 6-foot-8, 315 pounds,
Lewan anchored the left side of the
line for 50 games, earning the Big
Ten's lineman of the year last sea-
son.
What he said (on a Thursday
night conference call with report-
ers): "I had no idea where I'd go. I
knew when I came to Nashville and

able experience - just the feeling

of the city, the feeling of the town,
being around everybody. I literally
could not have gone to abetter place,
not just because of football, but also
everything that surrounds it.
"I don't care if it's 11th overall,
but I'll tell you what, I would not
want to go any other place than
the Tennessee Titans. It worked
out. I'm ecstatic, I'm pumped, I'm
excited, but like I said, nobody likes
to be second-best, especially not
third best, and I'm not going to let
that happen in the NFL."
Michael Schofield
What he did: Schofield started 13
games in each of the last two sea-
sons and 36 in total. He's shown
consistency in 50 appearances in
his career with experience at both
guard and tackle.
What he said (on a teleconfer-
ence 'with reporters): "This is the
best possible situation. That's
everyone's dream, coming into the
NFL right into Super Bowl con-
tention. Especially with an orga-
nization like the Broncos, and a
quarterback like Peyton Manning.

It's a dream come true."
Jeremy Gallon
What he did: Gallon came off the
board late largely due to his size at
5-foot-7, but he enters having set
the program record for receiving
yards in a single season last fall
(1,373).
Gallon appeared in all 13 games
last season, earning second-team
All-Big Ten honors. He finished his
career with 2,615 receiving yards in
50 games, setting a personal best
with 80 receptions in his final sea-
son.
What he said (Saturday night on

'M' lost in first
round for second
straight year
By JAKE LOURIM
Managing Sports Editor
Saturday, the Michigan men's
tennis team lost in the first round
of the NCAA Tournament for the
second straight year.
Monday night, the school
announced that match would
be Bruce Berque's last as head
coach.
Berque exits after 10 seasons
with a 159-104 record, including
66-25 in Big Ten play and 32-23
in the last two seasons.
The athletic department
declined to comment on the
nature of his departure.
"We won't discuss person-
nel matters or decisions pub-
licly," said Athletic Department
spokesman Dave Ablauf.
Berque could not be reached
for comment.
"I have thoroughly enjoyed
my 10 years at Michigan and
the interaction that I've had
with great student-athletes that
competed for our team on the
court and in the classroom," said
Berque in a statement. "I wish
everyone associated with Michi-
gan Athletics and the men's ten-

nis program all the best in the
future."
Berque, the third-longest ten-
ured coach in the history of the
program, reached the NCAA
Tournament for the last nine of
his 10 seasons. But he reached
the third round only once and
never advanced further.
His teams finished in the top
four of the Big Ten in eight of his
10 seasons but never won a con-
ference championship. Michigan
finished sixth this season at 6-5.
This year's team finished the
regular season ranked 37th and
lost to No. 29 Oklahoma State
in the first round of the NCAA
Championships, 4-2. The Wol-
verines featured All-Big Ten
junior Alex Petrone but took a
step back after losing three-time
All-American Evan King after
last season.
King was one of three All-
Americans Berque coached, the
other two being doubles partners
Matko Maravic and Brian Hung
in 2007. King also reached the
quarterfinals of the NCAA Sin-
gles Championships last season
and won more combined singles
and doubles matches than any
other player in program history.

Life Sciences
Institute celebrates
successes despite
decliningfunding
By IAN DILLINGHAM
Editor in Chief
The University's Life Scienc-
es Institute kicked off its 13th
annual symposium on Wednes-
day, highlighting the work of
researchers from around the
nation who came to the institute
to present and discuss their proj-
ects,
The event, which also com-
memorated the 10-year anni-
versary of the LSI, featured
presenters who were affiliated
with the University at some point
in their professional careers.
University President Mary Sue
Coleman used the symposium
as an opportunity to praise the
research being conducted at the
University. Coleman, who con-
ducted research in biochemistry
early in her career, discussed her
plans to establish an office in the
LSI after her tenure as president
ends this July.
"The collaboration, the inno-
vation, the discoveries emerging
from here really do allow us to
understand disease better (and)
have new approaches to treat-
ments and to cures," Coleman
said. "It's been a stunning decade
of accomplishment, and we look
forward to the next ten years."
In her remarks, Coleman laud-
ed the "intellectual depth" of the
researchers present at the sym-
posium, calling it a testament to
the University and the strength of
U.S. biomedical research efforts.
However, the ten years that
LSI has been in operation have,
on a national level, been ten of the
most challenging in the history of
biomedical research in the Unit-
ed States. In an interview prior to
the event, Francis Collins, direc-
tor of the National Institutes of
Health, expressed his frustration
at declining federal support for
such research efforts.
"The pace of progress, much
of it built upon the success of
the study of the genome, has just
been incredibly gratifying," Col-
lins said. "The frustrating part

of my job is that the support for
all this has not kept up with the
opportunity."
The NIH, which allocates the
bulk of federal funding for bio-
medical research under the gov-
ernance of the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services, is
the single largest contributor to
research funding at the Universi-
ty. In recent years, it has account-
ed for around 40 percent of the
University's $1.3 billion research
budget.
Over the last decade, the insti-
tutes have become a political
target, facing budget cuts that
resulted in a 25 percent loss of
purchasing power.
The result, Collins said, is that
researchers today face the "low-
est chance in history of actually
getting funded," with as few as
one in six grants being approved.
LSI director Alan Saltiel noted
that Coleman has been a strong
supporter of research on campus
during her tenure, overseeing
the investment of over $1 billion
in research expansion projects
that added more than one mil-
lion square feet of University
research space.
"We've been honored by the
leadership of a president who
truly gets us," Saltiel said. "She's
a president who's enabled us to
pursue our scientific dreams,
who's stimulated creative col-
laboration and who's helped us as

a group to become more than the
sum of our parts."
But even Coleman's stron-
gest efforts could not counteract
the national downward trend
in research funding. Under the
latest pressure of government
sequestration, which eliminat-
ed about $1.5 billion in federal
research funding, NIH estimates
that the institutes approved
about 640 fewer project grants in
the 2013 fiscal year than the year
prior.
"A lot of great science is being
left on the table because of the
shortfall of resources," Col-
lins added. "We are not short on
ideas, we are not short on tal-
ented people who want to pursue
those ideas, but we are hurting
when it comes to resources."
In addition, funding cuts could
eventually drive undergradu-
ate and graduate students, many
of whom rely on financial aid
packages to remain in scientific
fields, to pursue alternate career
options, resulting in a long-term
decline in the U.S. biomedical
workforce.
A 2013 report from the
American Association of Medi-
cal Colleges indicated that U.S.
graduates are being drawn out
of research fields and that some
faculty are being lured away by
well-funded labs in China and
Hong Kong.
"This is the thing that keeps

me up at night," Collins said.
"Have we already discouraged
some of thenext generation, who
otherwise would have embraced
careers in biomedical research,
are they already deciding to do
something else?"
"There are already individual
examples of people who have
made those decisions, and I don't
think those individuals are com-
ing back to join us if things get
better next year," he added.
The one change Collins said
he has observed recently is the
willingness of federal lawmakers
from both parties to acknowledge
the need for greater funding. Get-
ting there, however, is the major
hurdle, as neither party can agree
on the best way to increase fund-
ing to research programs.
Collins contended that, dollar-
for-dollar, medical research is
one of the best economic invest-
ments the federal government
can make - improving the health
of the population while also sup-
porting high-paying research
jobs.
"We could get past this dif-
ficult ten year period and see
a stable, predictable trajectory
for medical research that would
encourage all those bright scien-
tists here and elsewhere to chase
after really risky but potentially
highly rewarding research that
would push this momentum even
higher," he said.

The historic Nickels Arcade is add-
ing one more shop to its collection.
Mix, a women's clothier, is slated to
open next month.
The clothing outfit has roots in
Ypsilanti, where it first opened in
2009. After finding success at their
first location, owners Bonnie Penet
and Leslie Leland decided to expand
their shop with a second store.
Mix will inhabit the end of the
arcade closest to Maynard Street in
the space formerly occupied by Beagle
Brain Computer Repair. The owners
are in talks with contractors to secure
an opening date, but hope to open
their doors sometime around June 1.
Penet said she would describe
the clothing inventory as "artisti-
cally chic," with special emphasis on
"show-stopping" pieces.
The Ann Arbor space is one-third
the size of the Ypsilanti location, so its
selection will be smaller. The Nickels
Arcade location will feature the same
clothing lines, but will only sell new
clothing and accessories, whereas the
original location sells second-hand
items as well.
Since the Ypsilanti store launched,
Penet and Leland have paid special
attention to the tastes and desires of
their customers - a target audience
comprised mainly of women forty and
older.
Initially, the first store solely fea-
tured gently used items, varying from
vintage housewares and furniture to
gifts and art pieces. Eventually, Penet
and Leland brought in select collec-
tions of new clothing and accessories.
When the newer merchandise began
selling "out of the box," the gently
used items became a secondary aspect
of the business model.
"We do have a niche market of that
targeted audience with women who
like to look really great - 'turn heads'
we say - and also be comfortable,"
Penet said. "So far, we've found a great
audience for those qualities."
The Ypsilanti store's customers,
many of which come from Ann Arbor
and are affiliated with the Univer-
sity, inspired the owners' decision to
expand closer to campus.
"We know that there will be a lot of
foot traffic there, which is great, and
we love the location itself," Penet said.
"The historic nature of Nickels Arcade
is so beautiful."

Affirming other actions
The University must seek different routes to increase diversity
n April 22, the United States- Supreme Court ruled that
Michigan's ban on affirmative action was constitutional.
Therefore, in order to increase diversity at the University,
administrators must explore alternative routes. Jennifer Gratz, the
plaintiff in Gratz v. Bollinger, suggested methods for the University
to increase racial diversity in a recent Detroit Free Press article.
Gratz provides seven suggestions, including eliminating legacy pref-
erence, cutting unnecessary costs to increase need-based scholar-
ships and providing outreach programs for students without access
to substantial, educational resources. If the University truly desires
diversity, the administration should incorporate some of these sug-
gestions into its programs and policies.

S hortly after the U.S. Supreme
Court's recent ruling in Schuette
v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative
Action, which found
Michigan's banon
affirmative action
constitutional,
Pulitizer Prize win-
ner (and Michigan
Daily alumni) Ste-F
phen Henderson
wrote a column JAMES
titled "IAm Affir- BRENNAN
mative Action." In
his piece, Henderson
attributed much of his success todayto
the opportunities he was given thanks
to considerations of race in college
admissions and employment, embracing
affirmative action asa necessary and
successful policy.
Like Henderson, I too can attribute
much of my success to affirmative action
- affirmative action for white people.
Unlike a huge proportion of the Black
community, I grew up in a well-to-do
area, surrounded by economically suc-
cessful people, good schools and little
crime or violence. I also came of age ina
society run by people who look like me,
contributing early on to my belief that "I
can do anything."
Even more important may have been
the role of my parents, a part of our
development and future achievement
that cannot be undervalued. My father
was a lawyer and a University alum. He
expected me to follow in his footsteps
in both regards. While plenty of African
American and Latino parents encourage
their children to pursue similar goals,
their ability to help them achieve is often
hindered by a lack of experience. A par-
ent who has gone to college will have bet-
ter connections, more knowledge of the
admissions process and likely higher (but
also more realistic) educational expecta-
tions for their children. The percentage of
Blacks aged 25-29 with college degrees is
abouthalfthatofwhites, witheven lower
numbers for people my parents' age.
When I was 14, my dad and I went
to California to watch Michigan play
the University of Southern California
in the Rose Bowl. While we were there,
Michigan's admissions departmentheld a
prospective students meeting for Califor-
nians hoping to go to Michigan. Always
looking for a way to help me find my way
to Michigan, my dad made me go to the
meeting too. There, I met the director of
admissions and several other high-level
admissions officers and administrators,
some of whom I would regularly speak
with back in Michigan in the years lead-
ingto college.
Along with meeting important people
at Michigan, I also had the benefit of reg-
ularly meeting state and local politicians

and judges, getting trained in the art of
networking. These connections eventu-
ally led to letters of recommendation that
most high school students wouldn't get.
These were connections I made as early
as middle school - all because my dad
knew it was a good way to help me get in.
Applyingto colleges, myGPA andACT
were a pedestrian 3.6 and 28, respective-
ly. Though I had a slew ofextracurricular
involvement, I was clearly below aver-
age for most of the schools I applied to.
Despite my low academic achievement, I
still found myself admitted to both Mich-
igan and New York University in addition
to receiving huge scholarship offers to
some lesser schools. When I say I ben-
efited from "affirmative action for white
people", this isswhat I'm talking about.
Last year, Gallup released a poll show-
ingthattwothirdsofAmericansbelieved
students should be admitted to college
"solely on merit" and that colleges should
not consider race at all.
But what is "merit"?
Were my letters of recommendation
from a mayor and judge instances of
merit? What about my extracurricular
involvement and volunteering? Michi-
gan wants to build a class with a diverse
array of interests, experiences, and
involvement, but does that really count as
"merit"? Obviously an individual cannot
solely be evaluated based on their grades,
test scores, and class ranking, but where
does a university drawthatline?
We can talk all day in our admissions
essays, resumes and applications about
our diverse array of experiences; from
people like me who have benefited from
well-connected parents who introduced
me to politicians, to someone who gained
character struggling through poverty.
We can also be admitted on far less merit-
y things, like our parents' alumni status
or the recommendation of a dignitary.
But what about the perspective a
person gains by being Black in a soci-
ety that is deeply engrained with white
supremacy? Isn't this experience wor-
thy of consideration when evaluating a
student's possible contributions to cam-
pus? There have been dozens of times
that I've been able to draw on my own
personal hardships in contributing to
class discussions or writing a paper,
bringing in perspectives others don't
have. What about the perspective of a
person who's four times more likely to
be arrested because of their race? Can't
a person who is consistently treated
with less respect because of the color
of their skin bring something more to a
classroom?
Sorry, but in Michigan, that's not
"merit."

season supporting turn next to
Glenn Close in the lauded FX/
DirecTV legal thriller "Damag-
es." The show, which went off air
in 2012, is memorable for a vari-
ety of reasons, most in some way
stemming from that quiet preda-
tory ferocity in Close's portrayal.
Yet, it's Byrne's depiction of Ellen
Parsons that draws viewers in,
the lens of naivety through which
we get a glimpse at the guarded
inner workings of this other-
wise detached, exclusive world.
As the series progresses, as Par-
sons transforms from yuppie
law school graduate to ruthless,
manipulative attorney, Byrne
keeps us watching by steadily
dialing up the pressure, restrain-
ing it, and toward the final sea-
sons, letting it mold her into the
antihero we see in Close.
It would be easy to say how ,in
many ways, that transformative
arc is a little bit representative of
the swerving career shift Byrne
engineered for herself. But I'll
say it anyways. "Damages" was
a critical and commercial suc-
cess, often marketed as 'the most
intriguing female relationship
on TV.' After over a decade of
appearing in similar, traditional-
ly dramatic fare - you know, the
type of work that gets you Oscars
and Emmys (she got two nods for
her portrayal of Parsons) - the
actress chose to try her hand at
comedy.
The decision stood in stark
contrast to the Hollywood norm,
filled with comedic actors trying
to break into predictable Oscar-
bait after making a name in light-
er roles. Still, the projects Byrne
undertook were different. Unlike
a lot of female leads in Judd Apa-
tow man-child comedies, she
opted for parts that shoved her
next to Russell Brand and Seth
Rogen, if not on equal footing,
then at least with a chance to flex
a developing comedic voice.
She was one of the highlights
of "Bridesmaids," playing the
arrogant socialite to Kristen
Wiig's more bro-ish protagonist.
The composure she brought to
the character, coupled with an
understated, soft-spoken sense of
timing made her a perfect foil for
the rest of the cast's shit-sling-
ing, physical approach to humor.
There's a certain depth required

in being able to come off as devi-
ous, cunning yet still somehow
funny - especially while trying
to hold your against the likes of
expectedly hilarious Wiig and
McCarthy - and Byrne nailed it.
In "Neighbors," Byrne is thrust
into the spotlight from the first
scene, fighting, getting dirty,
-careful not to be relegated the
Leah Remini to Rogen's Kevin
James. The film's crux, after you
get past the dick jokes and hell-
ish, neon-blazed frat parties, is
Byrne's struggle to be given the
same type of leeway dudes usu-
ally get in R-rated summer com-
edies.
Part of the reason these films
have picked up steam over last
few years is Judd Apatow and
the brand of growing-up/men-
pretending-to-be-teenagers
humor he's popularized with the
help of the Rogen-Goldberg writ-
ing team. Most of those movies
earned their laughs in the poop-
smeared buildup to a usually
disappointing resolution, with
man-child X admittingto nagging

girlfriend/wife Y that it's about
time 'I accept my responsibilities
as an adult and stop farting in my
friends' mouths.' In "Neighbors,"
it's that same struggle to come
to terms with age, but, for once,
there's no underlying expecta-
tion that the woman be sidelined,
caricatured as the "responsible
cop" wife.
Byrne is right there next to
Rogen in every one of the film's
over-the-top, hilarious sequenc-
es, and by the time credits roll,
there's a distinct sense that bot
leads have developed or matured'
in the same ways. It's a credit to
Andrew J. Cohen and Brendan
O'Brien's script, though the bulk
of the applause should be saved
for Byrne, who fights, acting the
shit out of what could have been
something so much more expect-
able.
If anything, Byrne's work is
a confirmation of her range as
an actor, but more importantly,
a necessary reminder that good
acting can't be shoehorned - no
matter the gender roles.

Affirmative action is banned
based on the idea that discrimi-
nation of any kind, including
racial, is an unacceptable means
of student admission. Following
this logic, admissions should
avoid all forms of prejudicial
treatment, yet they reward stu-
dents for familial attachments
to the University. Eliminating
this unfair policy would con-
sequentially increase diversity
because often people of color
and lower socioeconomic sta-,
tuses represent an infinitesimal
small proportion of applicants
with legacy privilege.
Similarly, cutting adminis-
trative expenses could redirect
funds to help make need-based
scholarships larger for low
socioeconomic students. Cur-
rently, the University hires 53
percent more administrators
than faculty. This unnecessar-
ily high administrative staff.

contains numerous high-sal-
aried employees. On April 20,
numerous faculty members
confirmed the administrations
exuberant salaries, stating in a
letter to the Board of Regents
that administrative pay is
inappropriately high in com-
parison to other institutions.
While the University cannot
admit applicants based on race,
they can enhance their mentor-
ship programs in locations with
high proportions of minorities.
Since manyofthese areas contain
intelligent students that don't
possess the resources for educa-
tional success, these programs
couldhelpequalizethedisadvan-
tages underprivileged students
face through mentorship and
community engagement. These
mentors can provide insights
about educational opportunities,
give insights into applying to the
University and encourage gifted

students to apply.
While mentorship could
help students, it's important to
note that K-12 education needs
better funding in order for the
University to increase minority
enrollment, especially in
underprivileged geographic
areas. Though Republican Gov.
Rick Snyder proposed a $322
million budget increase for
K-12 funding in February, the
proposed monetary increase
is not enough. Spikes in
retirement costs have deterred
school districts from being
able to utilize the money for
student purposes. Addressing
underlying funding concerns
could increase the number of
applications the University
receives from people of color
and lower socioeconomic
statuses by creating a more

educational system.

Death
toll rises
in mine
accident
SOMA, Turkey (AP) - Amid
wails of grief and anger, rescue
workers coated in grime trudged
repeatedly out of a coal mine
Wednesday with stretchers of
bodies that swelled the death toll
to 274 - the worst such disaster
in Turkish history.
Hopes faded for 150 others
still trapped deep underground
in smoldering tunnels filled with
toxic gases.
Anti-government protests
broke out in the mining town of
Soma, as well as Istanbul and the
capital, Ankara, with Prime Min-
ister Recep Tayyip Erdogan heck-
led as he tried to show concern.
Protesters shouted "Murderer!"
and "Thief!" and Erdogan was
forced to seek refuge in a super-
market, surrounded by police.
The display of anger could
have significant repercussions for
the Turkish leader, who is widely
expected to run for president in
the August election, although he
has yet to announce his candi-
dacy.
Tensions were high as hun-
dreds of relatives and miners jos-
tled outside the mine's entrance
Wednesday, waiting for news
amid a heavy police presence.
Rows of women wailed uncon-
trollably and men knelt sobbing
or simply stared in disbelief as
rescue workers removed body
after body, some charred beyond
recognition.
One elderly man wearing a
prayer cap wailed after he recog-
nized one of the dead, and police
had to restrain him from climb-
ing into an ambulance with the
body. An injured rescue worker
who emerged alive was whisked
away on a stretcher to the cheers
of onlookers.
Energy Minister Taner Yildiz
said 787 people were inside the
coal mine at the time of Tuesday's
explosion: 274 died and 363 were
rescued, including scores who
were injured.
The death toll topped a 1992
gas explosion that killed 263
workers near Turkey's Black Sea
port of Zonguldak. It also left 150
miners still unaccounted for.

Although a dedicated pro-choice
activist, I have often felt disappointed
by the pro-choice movement for its
inability to own up to its problematic
past, in particular to the politics of
Margaret Sanger. Although Sanger
and other first-wave feminists made
many important contributions to
securingwomen's rights - fightingfor
the right to vote, increasing access to
birth control and information about
it - many people don't realize that
these gains were rarely extended to
less privileged women. In fact, many
advances related to birth control came
at the expense of people of color and
people with disabilities, eugenics
being a prime example. While it may
be convenient to brush this history
under the rug, I believe the movement
needs to use Sanger's unforgivable
missteps as a learning opportunity. If
we don't own our problematic past,.
anti-choice groups will.
Unfortunately, the root of this
problem - the inability to include
any but the most privileged voices
in feminist discourse - still exists
in feminist circles today. First wave
feminists, and arguably most femi-
nists today, often possess the most
privileged identities: white, middle-
class, native-born, able bodied. You
can't have a radical movement -
one that gets at the roots of oppres-
sion - if marginalized identities
aren't equally, if not more than
equally, represented. The negli-
gence of oppressed identities other
than "woman" renders feminism,
even today, as a tool to reinforce
racism, ableism and all other forms
of oppression.
In the reproductive rights move-
ment there is still so much emphasis
on the ability to prevent reproduction,
which centers the concerns of privi-
leged women ratherthanthe concerns
of women of color whose reproduc-
tion has historically been denigrated,
abused and manipulated. In other
words, the reproductive rights move-
ment, with its unyielding focus on
birth control and abortion rights, only
serves to further amplify privileged
voices that have long been heard loud
and clear. Instead, feminist activists
need to emphasize more and more the
vast spectrum of choices - reproduc-
tive and otherwise - that people are
denied as a result of their oppressed
status. We can start by recogniz-
ing that parenting is also a powerful
choice, one that has consistently been
given to the most privileged women
while denied to women unable to
uphold the hegemony through their

genetic code or social status.
Students for Choice is trying to do
this, but such fundamental change
cannot happen overnight. We are end-
lessly grateful for the campus climate
that welcomes pro-choice activism,
as well as the deep support of depart-
ments like Women's Studies, Ameri-
can Culture, and the Department of
Afroamerican and African Studies.
We are honored to have received the
Women's Studies Department Femi-
nist Practice Award, but I cannot deny
that we received it to a great degree
because of how welcoming our cam-
pus is to our beliefs. By virtue of being
on a campus where pro-choice beliefs
are the norm,we spend much less time
talkingoverpeople, tryingto convince
them that, contrary to conservative
beliefs, women should also have a
right to bodily autonomy. Instead, we
have the opportunity to move for-
ward, to build a better, more inclusive
movement, to be self-reflective, to
grow. Because of the fairly support-
ive climate at the University, we can
go beyond condoms and birth control
and work towards destabilizing the
racismboth in the choice movement
as well as in our society as a whole.
Our activism is about moving for-
ward, not about winning a debate.
As Inderpal Grewal and a myriad
of other feminist scholars have con-
vincingly argued, there is no such
thingas aninternationalsisterhood,
a universal or essential feminine
nature that connects all women.
None of us are just women - we
are both oppressors and oppressed
by members of this group. Calling
for this sisterhood erases the very
real differences among women
generated by our interlocking and
diverse social identities, and it does
not acknowledge the difficulty, and
often impossibility, of working with
your oppressor, especially one that
is blind to checking their privilege.
While a universal sisterhood is an
impossibility, reflection is not. By this
I mean reflecting about your move-
ment, your beliefs, your life. You must
understand where political activism
comes from and where it will go in
the future. Reflect in order to pause,
to create the mental energy to make
your activism more intentional. And
reflect on your own life. In the end,
having special or unique experiences
is not whatcauses personal or political
growth. It's reflecting on the simplest
encounters, on something as daily as a
birth control pill,that does.

Intelligent'Neighbors'
both witty and raunchy

PHOTOSTORY BY ADAM GLANZMAN
Irene Butter is more than a Holocaust survivor. As a
former University professor, she often visits classrooms to
teach about her experiences and to educate school children
and college students alike about the importance of never
being a bystander. In addition to her work in schools,
Butter stays active by exercising, planting in her garden,
and volunteering at a local food pantry. She is one of the
founding members of a group of women who call themselves
Zeitouna, an Arabic word for olive tree and a symbol of
peace. Zeitouna hosts dialogue groups between six Jewish
women and six Arabic women. They discuss topics in their
meetings ranging from the conflict in the Middle East to
the meaning of identity, loss, displacement, and forgiveness.
According to Butter, "just because you grow up thinking
someone has to be your enemy doesn't mean it has to be that
way."
These photos give a very brief look into the expansive and
remarkable life of Irene Butter.
