Annual fair
brings over 1,000
artists downtown

From 
Thursday, 
July 
18, 
through 
Sunday, 
July 
21, 
hundreds of tents filled with 
paintings, 
carvings, 
clothing 
and food lined the streets of 
downtown Ann Arbor for the 
annual Ann Arbor Art Fair, 
a conglomerate of the Street 
Art Fair, Summer Art Fair, 
State Street Art Fair and South 
University Art Fair. Celebrating 
its 60th anniversary, the Ann 
Arbor Art Fair boastsed over 
half a million attendees and one 
thousand artists. 
Karen 
Delhey, 
executive 
director of the Guild of Artists 
and Artisans, said planning 
the fair requires a lot of 
coordination between different 
organizations. She explained 
the planning process for the 
next fair starts a week after the 
current one finishes. 
The Guild of Artists and 
Artisans 
is 
specifically 
in 
charge of the Summer Art Fair, 
but Delhey said collaboration 
is 
required. 
Delhey 
said 

their mission was to provide 
marketing 
opportunities 
for 
artists and businesses. 
“We have over 1,000 jury-
selected artists,” Delhey said. 
“Nowhere are you going to see 
this concentration of fine art in 
one place.”
Studio owner Dale Rodgers 
has enjoyed his ability to market 
his work through the art fair. 
“This is one of the greatest 
buying-energy crowds, “ Rogers 
said. “It’s a massive show. 
Because of the scale, you’ll meet 
buyers here from all over the 
country that come to the show”
Mark Lewanski, who owns a 
namesake glass studio, has been 
selling at the fair for 10 to 12 
years and agrees with Rodgers’s 
sentiment. 
“It’s a really good show,” 
Lewanski said. “There’s so many 
people that come in here that 
can afford my work, so I can 
always sell enough to do well.”
Obtaining a spot of the art fair 
is considered selective. Delhey 
said once an artist applies, they 
are scored by jurists, with the 
highest 
scoring 
submissions 
receiving 
invites. 
For 
the 
Summer Art Fair, over 600 
applications were received to fill 
375 slots.
University 
of 
Michigan 
Business 
freshman 
Gabriel 
Correa attended the Art Fair for 

the first time and said he ejoyed 
the atmosphere. 
“I’m originally from Puerto 
Rico, so this is all new to me,” 
Correa said. “I think this is a 
really cool setting. It’s really 
family-friendly.”
Temperatures rose to above 
90 degrees throughout the fair, 
just like the past year’s art fair. 
Kaylan Mitchell, owner of the 
Getup Vintage said she saw the 
direct effects of the hot weather 
on her tent.
“I’d be in the tent and ladies, 
especially older ladies, would 
walk up to the tent, take one 
glance, look at me and say, 
‘It’s too hot’ and walk away,” 
Mitchell said. “People don’t 
want to put clothes on their 
sweaty bodies. Definitely sales 
were down just because people 
didn’t want to be trying on 
clothes in the heat.”
In 
addition 
to 
the 
hot 
weather, the fair was greeted 
by strong storms on Friday and 
Saturday. A down power line 
led to reports of a car explosion 
and injuries. Despite artists 
rushing to weigh down their 
tent and cover their artwork, 
tents still slid around the street 
and were blown over, leaving 
some artists’ work completely 
damaged. 

‘U’ student 
dethroned of
pageant title

Miss World America 
strips Kathy Zhu 
of crown over 
controversial tweets 

Last 
Friday, 
a 
University 
of 
Michigan student made her way into 
the spotlight after the Miss World 
America organization stripped her of 
her Miss Michigan title on account 
of two tweets deemed “offensive, 
insensitive and inappropriate content.”
MWA’s concern spurred from two 
tweets from their former titleholder 
LSA senior Kathy Zhu, vice chair 
of the College Republicans at the 
University. The first tweet was from 
October 
2017 
condemning 
Black 
Americans for violence within their 
own communities, and the other was 
from February 2018 equating the use 
of a hijab to the oppression of women 
under Islam.
The latter tweet was Zhu’s response 
to a ‘try a hijab on’ booth at the 
University of Central Florida campus 
where she was formerly a student. 
The booth was hosted by the school’s 
Muslim 
Student 
Association 
in 
celebration of World Hijab Day.
Zhu’s tweet garnered thousands 
of replies, including some which 
called for her expulsion. UCF issued 
a response on Twitter, stating Zhu’s 
actions did not violate the school’s 
Rules of Conduct.
Zhu transferred to the University of 
Michigan the following semester. Her 
tweet on the experience has since been 
taken down, but the Orlando Sentinel 
published a screengrab when they 
covered the story in 2018. Despite its 
deletion, Zhu told Fox News on Monday 
she still “stands by” her tweets.
Upon the revocation of her title, 
Zhu 
tweeted 
screenshots 
of 
her 
conversation with Laurie DeJack, 
former acting state director for MWA

Panel looks at life 
with disabilities

Speakers examine 
‘U’ policies for 
students with 
disabilities

University 
of 
Michigan 
students, 
faculty 
and 
staff 
gathered at Rackham Auditorium 
on Monday afternoon for an event 
titled the Disability Inclusion 
Panel: Making U-M Events More 
Welcoming & Accessible. The 
event was co-presented by the 
International Institute’s Inclusion 
Culture Liaisons Committee and 
the Disability Culture at U-M 
Committee 
and 
co-sponsored 
by the Global Scholars Program 
and the Council for Disability 
Concerns.
Panelists included Dr. Shanna 
Kattari, an assistant professor at 
the School of Social Work and LSA 
Women’s 
Studies 
Department; 

Elizabeth McLain, a School of 
Music, Theatre and Dance Ph.D. 
candidate; Seif Saqallah, a third-
year 
Law 
student; 
Solomon 
Furious Worlds, a second-year 
Law student and Co-Founder and 
Co-Chair of the Disability Rights 
Student Organization; Dr. Feranmi 
Okanlami, Director for Medical 
Student Success in the Medical 
School’s Office of Diversity, Equity, 
and Inclusion and Kayla Williams, 
a School of Information alum.
Ashley 
Wiseman, 
associate 
director of the Global Scholars 
Program, served as co-organizer 
of the event with Ashley Bates, 
the program manager for the Zell 
Visiting Writers Series. Wiseman 
also moderated the panel.
The panel started with Bates 
introducing herself and the event. 
During her introduction, Bates 
acknowledged her involvement 
in the event as an able-bodied 
person.

School of Education 
creates new training
program based off 
medical residencies

The University of Michigan 
School of Education is partnering 
with the Detroit Public Schools 
Community District to open a 
new high school located on the 
Marygrove College campus. Ninth 
graders will begin at the school in 
fall, adding a new ninth grade class 
yearly until the school is full.
According to an email from 
Chrystal Wilson, DPSCD assistant 
superintendent of communications 
and marketing, the school will 
be social justice themed and 
have an emphasis on developing 
critical 
thinking. 
The 
school, 
officially called The School @ 
Marygrove, will also have a focus 
in engineering.
“Operated by Detroit Public 
Schools 
Community 
District 
(DPSCD), the new social justice-
themed public school has been 
designed 
to 
develop 
critical 
thinkers and community-minded 
citizens who have the skills and 
knowledge to be makers and 
leaders creating a more just and 
equitable future,” Wilson wrote. 
“DPSCD and the University of 
Michigan School of Education 

have co-developed a project- and 
place-based 
engineering 
and 
design thinking curriculum that 
will empower students to identify, 
collaborate and solve complex 
problems found in our city and in 
our world.”
Education 
senior 
Hannah 
Whitman said social justice is a 
pillar of her teacher preparation 
coursework. 
She 
said 
it 
is 
important for both students and 
teachers to understand why social 
justice is important in society and 
for educators to teach with social 
justice in mind.
“It’s so important for students to 
have the ability to be an advocate, 
not only for themselves, but for 
people in their community or people 
around the world,” Whitman said. 
“Teaching that as young as high 
school or even younger is really 
empowering for them.”
Marygrove’s 
Liberal 
Arts 
Building is undergoing renovations 
throughout the summer and will 
be ready for students in September, 
Wilson wrote. Though Marygrove 
is set to close its doors in December 
because of declining enrollment 
and financial struggles, Wilson 
wrote that this is not expected to 
impact the new school.
The 
Kresge 
Foundation, 
a 
private foundation working to 
expand 
opportunities 
through 
grants and investments, is also 
involved in opening the school.The 
Foundation did not respond to The 
Daily’s request for comment.

The University of Michi-
gan Board of Regents met 
at the Richard L. Postma 
Family Clubhouse Thursday 
afternoon for the fifth meet-
ing of the calendar year. At 
the meeting, the board dis-
cussed Ann Arbor campus 
planning.
University 
President 
Mark Schlissel opened the 
meeting by thanking UM-
Flint 
Chancellor 
Susan 
Borrego for her work at UM-
Flint. Borrego, who has been 
chancellor since 2014, will 
finish her term at the end 
of July and be replaced by 
Debasish Dutta.
“Chancellor Borrego, as 
we bid you farewell, I want 
to thank you for your leader-
ship and commitment to the 
University, the region and 
the people that your campus 
serves,” Schlissel said. 
Borrego 
thanked 
the 
board for their support of 
UM-Flint. She said UM-
Flint has remarkable stu-
dents, faculty and staff.
“I think the UM-Flint 
campus is a remarkable 
place to be, and it’s been an 
honor to be there,” Borrego 
said. “I look forward to what 
happens for it and with it in 
the future.”
Schlissel recognized six 
new distinguished profes-
sors. He then discussed the 
board’s efforts to examine 
the relations between the 
three University campuses, 
which he said the board 
promised to consider at last 
month’s meeting in which 
five speakers from One Uni-
versity spoke regarding the 
campaign’s goals.
“The board, the chan-
cellors and I are always 
engaged 
in 
discussions 
about how to promote the 
longstanding excellence of 
each of our campuses and 
the success of our students,” 
Schlissel said. “Following 
the board’s guidance from 
when I was hired, we’ve 
worked to expand synergies 
and contribute to the unique 

missions and priorities of 
our three campuses.”
University planner Sue 
Gott gave a presentation on 
the ongoing and future ren-
ovation projects on the Ann 
Arbor campus. Gott said the 
goals of the project include 
enhancing 
campus 
life, 
emphasizing 
sustainabil-
ity, honoring tradition and 
strengthening connectivity.

Gott focused her presen-
tation on plans for North 
and Central Campuses. Cur-
rently, more than eight Uni-
versity buildings are under 
construction, including the 
historic 
Michigan 
Union 
and the LSA building. Gott 
said the University looks 
to expand development on 
North Campus.
“Our largest land area of 
our campuses is North Cam-
pus,” Gott said. “ … It is really, 
out of our five campuses, the 
place where we will want to 
continue directing growth 
and new development oppor-
tunities in our future.”
Future plans include mov-
ing the School of Dance and 
School of Information onto 
North Campus, rebuilding 
the Fleming Administration 
building and constructing a 
new School of Pharmacy.

Plans are also in place to 
construct a new residence 
hall on Central Campus to 
replace Mary Markley Resi-
dence Hall. Gott said the 
University plans to repur-
pose Mary Markley as an 
additional medical center.
“There may be real benefit 
for supporting our clinical 
mission by repurposing this 
site long-term for another 

patient care use,” Gott said.
Gott said property pur-
chased on South Fifth Ave-
nue would be a great location 
for a new residence hall. The 
location is slightly closer to 
the Diag than Markley.
An 
additional 
new 
residence hall on North 
Campus will also replace 
Northwood housing. When 
renovations are complete, 
Gott 
said 
approximately 
one third of students living 
on campus will reside on 
North Campus.
“As we continue to see 
us reach the end of the use-
ful lives of our Northwoods 
facilities, we would like 
to develop that area more 
densely as we replace those 
units,” Gott said.

Public commenters spoke 
about medical processes, 
funding equity, investments 
and climate change at the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
Board of Regents meeting 
Thursday afternoon.
Westland resident Allie 

Parker delivered a list of 
changes to medical processes 
at the C.S. Mott Children’s 
Hospital. Parker — who spoke 
about this issue during the 
February meeting — said her 
family endured psychologi-
cal, emotional and physical 
trauma because a University 
physician inaccurately attrib-
uted one of her children’s 
injuries to parental abuse.
In February, Parker said 
the University Child Protec-
tion Team — comprised of 
doctors at C.S. Mott Chil-
dren’s Hospital — accused her 
and her husband, James Park-
er, of child abuse. The Parkers 
were then brought to court 
over this alleged child abuse, 
with the judge ultimately dis-
missing the case.
Parker claimed in Feburary 
that this legal process unnec-
essarily stalled the treatment 

of her child and believes this 
resulted in a miscarriage. She 
said her predicament could 
have been avoided if there 
was more accountability and 
that she is not the first person 
to raise these concerns.
“U of M was on a fishing 
expedition at my children’s 
expense,” Parker said. “I 
asked you in February and 
I’m asking you again: How 

many families will need to 
stand here with another hor-
ror story before something is 
done?”
Students 
and 
faculty 
expressed support for the 
One University campaign, a 
coalition aimed at creating 
funding equity the three Uni-
versity campus.
UM-Flint student Matthew 
Baldwin shared his experi-
ence as a nontraditional stu-
dent. Baldwin said the Board 
of Regents should align itself 
with the goals of 1U to ease 
the burden of students in the 
University system.
1U has asked for the Go 
Blue Guarantee and funding 
from the Victors for Michi-
gan campaign to be limited 
to the Ann Arbor campus and 
expanded resources to sup-
port programs such as study 
abroad and Diversity, Equity 

and Inclusion at the Flint and 
Dearborn campuses. At the 
board meeting in May, a 1U 
spokeswomen said the coali-
tion had the support of six 
board members.
“You, the University of 
Michigan Board of Regents 
members, have a story you can 
tell here today,” Baldwin said. 
“By having equitable funding 
amongst our three campuses, 
you can tell one of expanding 
opportunity, one of dignities, 
one of respect for faculty and 
students, one of solidarity.”
Multiple public comments 
addressed concerns around 
the potential closing of the 
Livonia Outpatient Surgery 
Center 
operating 
rooms. 
Members of the board reiterat-
ed that no decisions were final.
Stacy Roth, a nurse at the 
Livonia Outpatient Surgery 
Center, read a letter from a 
surgeon at the center, con-
cerned about the possible 
shut-down of the center in 
three years. She said shutting 
down the center would be 
“counterproductive.”
Monica 
Sirven, 
clinical 
assistant professor and medi-
cal director of the Livonia 
Outpatient Surgery Center, 
said the operating rooms ser-
vice the community and has 
consistently been profitable 
for Michigan Medicine.
The board is considering 
expanding its health system, 
though the operating rooms at 
the Livonia Outpatient Surgery 
Center are not currently includ-
ed in this plan. Sirven said she 
hopes the board will reconsider.
“Surgeons want to operate 
at the Livonia Surgery Center,” 
Sirven said. “The long-term 
opportunity to keep patient 
access open in this area will 
be worthy of the investment if 
new ORs are included.”
Last week, Bridge Maga-
zine published an article 
with 
information 
that 
showed the board voted to 
invest endowment money 
into the Detroit Renaissance 
Real Estate Fund, which is 
owned by FDR’s two busi-
ness principals.

ALEXANDER SATOLA | OP-ED
A

fter gaining independence 
from Russia in 1991, the 
government of Estonia 
set out to distinguish itself as a 
hub for technological innovation. 
Today, 99 percent of public 
services are available online to 
its 1.3 million citizens. However, 
despite all of the technological 
innovation 
evident 
in 
the 
e-Estonia 
project, 
its 
most 
impressive accomplishment has 
been maintaining trust with the 
public.
As we know from our everyday 
interactions, if we put our faith 
in someone and they deceive us, 
we aren’t likely to trust them 
again. The same is true for 
people and their governments. 
Estonia 
has 
demonstrated 
a 
digital 
transition 
where 
a 
government 
consistently 
delivers 
on 
its 
promise 
to 
provide valuable services to its 
people. This environment of 
confidence is essential to any 
healthy democracy.
A good democracy has both 
elements of trust and distrust. 
On the one hand, citizens need 
to keep a close eye on their 
leaders to prevent abuses of 
power, which is why in the 
United States we have frequent 
elections and consent of the 
governed. 
However, 
people 
should 
also 
express 
faith 
in public institutions when 
they are found to be fair and 
legitimate .
The U.S. has a lot to learn 
from 
the 
Estonian 
model, 
especially 
when 
it 
comes 

to residents’ trust in public 
institutions. According to the 
Pew Research Center, only 17 
percent of Americans say they 
trust the federal government 
to do the right thing always or 
most of the time. 
This level of distrust can be 
found across multiple levels 
of government as well. One of 
the most egregious examples 
of 
government 
deception 
is the Flint water crisis, in 
which 
the 
city 
government 
diverted contaminated water 
from the Flint River to cut 
costs. For much of 2014 and 
2015, government officials told 
residents the water was safe 
to drink despite the evidence 
that there were still dangerous 
contaminant levels. Even now, 
as officials assure residents 
the pipes are replaced and the 
water is safe, many residents 
still drink only bottled water.
On top of political scandal, 
inefficient 
administration 
can 
also 
embitter 
citizens. 
American 
civic 
activities 
like voting and paying taxes, 
for example, are practically 
designed to be vexing. In order 
to vote, Americans have to brave 
a complicated voter registration 
process, figure out confusing 
residency and early voting rules 
and take off work on election 
day. The U.S. tax system is also 
notoriously complicated, with 
people filling out a plethora of 
forms each year only to send 
the government information it 
already has.

So what does Estonia do 
differently? 
To 
start, 
the 
voting and taxation processes 
in Estonia sound utopian. In 
2005, Estonia became the first 
country in the world to facilitate 
online i-Voting. People can cast 
their ballots from any device 
connected to the internet and 
are even able to change their 
vote during the pre-election 
period. 
Additionally, 
filing 
taxes takes only five minutes on 
average and 98 percent of tax 
declarations are filed online.

The backbone of this digital 
society is the e-ID card, which 
gives residents access to secure 
digital services. The card is 
equipped with a chip and two 
pin codes for security and 
serves as a legal travel ID, 
national health insurance card 
and digital signature.
In addition, residents have 
agency 
over 
their 
personal 
data. Using their ID card, they 
can access a portal with a log 
of everyone who has viewed 
their data. They enjoy strong 

protections 
on 
the 
consent-
based use of their sensitive 
personal 
information, 
which 
creates transparency with the 
authorities.
Skeptics will be quick to point 
out that Estonia is relatively 
small and has a public that 
already buys into its government 
acting like an idealistic Silicon 
Valley startup. If Estonia really 
is a special case, then it can’t 
offer much to large countries 
who can’t afford to start from 
scratch.
Also, some of the central 
tenets of e-Estonia, like national 
ID, are unlikely to gain a footing 
in the United States. Think tanks 
such as the Cato Institute and 
the ACLU have labeled national 
ID as a dangerous threat to 
individuals’ rights, giving the 
government 
wide-ranging 
surveillance 
capability 
over 
citizens. The federal government 
has a history of violating citizens’ 
privacy, so the public must 
indeed think critically about any 
proposed improvements to the 
current system.
That 
said, 
government 
e-services that make people’s 
lives easier already exist in 
the United States. The website 
USA.gov provides links to a 
number of online applications, 
including 
passports, 
federal 
assistance 
programs 
and 
immigration. 
Smaller 
state 
and 
municipal 
governments 
are also experimenting with 
e-services. 
For 
example, 
in 
Washington 
D.C., 
residents 

can apply online for a driver’s 
license, pay parking tickets 
and 
explore 
some 
of 
the 
city’s open data initiatives. 
Like American tech startups, 
governments should be more 
aggressive about providing a 
better user experience to their 
constituents.
It is also the job of governments 
to 
clearly 
communicate 
the 
value 
of 
e-services. 
Saving 
time and reducing hassle are 
great incentives, but if these 
aren’t properly relayed, then 
public programs will forever 
lack legitimacy and adoption. 
Equally, when things go wrong, 
the government must act fast to 
regain trust. Despite discovering 
a major vulnerability in the e-ID 
system in 2018, the Estonian 
government 
worked 
closely 
with experts and the public to 
turn a potential disaster into 
an opportunity to bolster its 
cybersecurity.
The Estonian digital transition 
started out with a high level of 
public confidence, and it was 
able to maintain it by granting 
the population with transparent, 
innovative 
services. 
Though 
the most obvious way to keep 
the trust of the public involves 
avoiding activities that prompt 
distrust, 
U.S. 
policymakers 
should also further consider the 
merits of bringing traditional 
public services into the digital 
age.

A good democracy

SAMANTHA DELLA FERA | COLUMN

I

t’s been a busy July. In 
one of the hottest months 
in recent memory, it’s no 
surprise that tensions and hot 
button stories are boiling over. 
From Hollywood to the White 
House, 
people 
are 
getting 
angry. Too often, that anger 
has been directed at people — 
particularly women — of color. 
At the beginning of the 
month, 
Disney 
announced 
Halle Bailey as the actress 
playing Ariel in the live-action 
remake of “The Little Mer-
maid.” Many thought Bailey, a 
young, talented R&B singer and 
star on the show “Grown-ish,” 
was the perfect choice to play 
the coveted role of Ariel. Oth-
ers quickly pointed out what 
they deemed to be an unaccept-
able attribute: She’s Black. Fol-
lowing what should have been a 
career-making announcement 
for Bailey, critics jumped at the 
opportunity to accuse Disney of 
erasing the true story of Ariel. 
In a since-removed change.org 
petition, many people signed 
their names in support of a 
recast of Ariel. Because these 
signators can believe that a 
mermaid exists and has a crus-
tacean best friend, but having 
to watch a movie with a Black 
woman in it? That’s asking just 
a bit too much of them. 
Of course, the criticism of 
Ariel’s casting is coming from a 
place of racism. Unlike the sto-
ries of Pocahontas or Mulan, 
Ariel’s race is of no importance 
to her story. Her story is about 
having your voice stripped 
away from you, being misheard 
and misunderstood. Coming 
from that angle, there is no one 
better to play that role in 2019 
than a Black woman. Thank-
fully, most of the backlash to 
the casting was discovered to 
be trolls, and it has mostly died 
down. 
That brings us to now. It’s 
the middle of July, in the 
midst of a noticeable chasm in 
Democratic ideology, and all 
eyes were on a publicized spat 
between Speaker of the House 
Nancy Pelosi and junior Con-

gresswoman Alexandria Oca-
sio-Cortez. The trouble started 
after AOC and “The Squad” 
— the nickname given to the 
foursome of AOC, Ilhan Omar, 
Ayanna Pressley and Rashida 
Tlaib — voted against a House 
bill to send funds to the border 
that they saw as writing Immi-
gration and Customs Enforce-
ment and Border Patrol agents 
a 
dangerous 
blank 
check. 
Never one to stay out of the 
spotlight, 
President 
Donald 
Trump tweeted that “Progres-
sive’ Democrat Congresswom-
en, who originally came from 
countries whose governments 
are a complete and total catas-
trophe, the worst, most cor-
rupt and inept anywhere in the 
world (if they even have a func-
tioning government at all)” 
should “go back and help fix 
the totally broken and crime 
infested places from which 
they came.” 
Though the women were 

not named, it is clear that 
Trump’s tweet was directed 
at “The Squad,” a group com-
prised of all women of color 
who have been vehemently 
outspoken against Trump since 
the beginning. The tweet obvi-
ously caused a storm of back-
lash, as the “go back to where 
you came from” trope has 
deep, racist roots. Since then, 
Trump has tweeted more dis-
gusting things, and the House 
voted to condemn his words, 
though many Republicans were 
appalled that Pelosi called the 
president’s words racist. 
So what do these two things, 
Ariel and Trump’s tweets, have 

in common? The fury at a Black 
Ariel and the racist language 
of our president, coupled with 
the support of his party, are 
one in the same. It’s an anger 
that has manifested in parts of 
America towards seeing people 
put in positions where they 
allegedly don’t belong. It is no 
surprise that Donald Trump is 
a racist: He has been proving it 
since the 1970s. Yet people are 
constantly surprised that the 
people who back him just don’t 
care. But of course they don’t 
care, because they agree.
Trump was recently asked if 
it concerns him that people saw 
his tweets as racist and white 
nationalist groups are stand-
ing by him. He said, “It doesn’t 
concern me because many peo-
ple agree with me. And all I’m 
saying — they want to leave, 
they can leave.” 
Republicans didn’t leave in 
the eight years they spent hat-
ing Barack Obama, questioning 
his citizenship and blocking 
every action he tried to take, 
and Democrats aren’t going 
to leave now. It drives Trump 
and his backers crazy to see 
Hispanic, Black and Muslim 
women in Congress, because 
they don’t think these women 
have a place in the govern-
ment. People don’t want a 
Black Ariel because it feeds 
into their white supremacist 
narrative that they are being 
replaced or cast aside. We have 
to stop dancing around these 
outbursts by labeling them as 
“racially charged” or “politi-
cally motivated” — they’re just 
racist. To beat around the bush 
is not to declare that the prob-
lem exists, which only allows 
it to grow and hide behind the 
cover of politics as usual. Call 
it out — on the House floor, in 
movies, wherever it needs to be 
heard. The Trump presidency 
will end, but the stain he left on 
this country and the fires he’s 
reignited will burn on. Now’s 
the time to start stamping them 
out.

Anger towards Ariel and AOC are one in the same

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

It’s undeniable: Young Thug 
is the current rap generation’s 
most prominent influence. 
Before Thug, it was Lil Wayne. 
Wayne inspired an entire gener-
ation of rappers, including Ken-
drick Lamar and Young Thug 
himself. 
Interestingly, 
Kend-
rick’s mixtape C4 showcased 
him as nothing more than a Lil 
Wayne clone. When I say “clone,” 
I mean that Kendrick and others 
were attempting to build a career 
based on what made Lil Wayne 
famous. The same goes for Thug; 
at the beginning, he, too, was a 
Wayne clone. Just listen to “Take 
Kare” featuring Lil Wayne. The 
resemblance is uncanny. 
Today, Kendrick Lamar and 
Young Thug are two rappers 
that will always turn heads with 
any of their new material. Few 
have attempted to be a Kendrick 
clone, but many, many rappers in 
the new generation are attempt-
ing to channel their inner Thug.
Thug’s career has been a tour 
de force and has given his army 
of understudies plenty of mate-
rial to expand upon. Throughout 
his career, Thug has sputtered 
out countless different flows, 

vocal inflections and non sequi-
turs. It’s too much for one indi-
vidual to even attempt to imitate. 
Because of this, each Thugger 
clone sounds distinct. It’s as if 
Young Thug reproduces asexu-
ally via fragmen-
tation, like a sea 
sponge, with each 
clone 
latching 
onto a certain part 
of Thug’s persona 
and building an 
entire career out 
of it. 
Interesting-
ly, 
Young 
Thug 
has 
embraced 
his 
clones 
and 
has even signed 
a few of them to 
his 
label, 
YSL 
Records, as if to 
raise them. Plen-
ty of rappers are 
affiliated 
with 
YSL 
Records, 
including 
super-
stars like Drake, Lil Baby and 
Lil Uzi Vert, but few are actually 
signed, demonstrating the effort 
it takes to make it as a Thugger 
clone. 
THE CLONES
Lil Duke
The first of Thug’s clones is 
none other than Lil Duke, also 
known as YSL Duke. Duke is per-

haps the most straight-laced of 
Thug’s protégés, and he is also 
the longest tenured. In fact, he’s 
been signed to YSL Records since 
2015. 
While he doesn’t share any of 
Thug’s 
sarto-
rial tendencies, 
Duke was born 
from 
Thug’s 
slick-talking, 
greasy 
street 
raps. He twists 
tales 
of 
sip-
ping lean and 
hustling with a 
spitfire, gravel-
ly flow, just like 
Thug. However, 
he varies in his 
delivery 
and 
beat 
selection, 
often 
sticking 
to a low vocal 
register and the 
typical Atlanta 
trap-type beats. 
He is essentially 
Young Thug if Young Thug were 
purely a street rapper, and it’s 
glorious.
Required 
listening: 
“Good 
Luck” featuring Young Thug and 
“Run It Up.”
Gunna
Gunna is the most famous of 
all Thug’s clones. In fact, he’s 
probably even more popular than 

his forebear. He is essentially the 
Reader’s Digest version of Young 
Thug. He doesn’t rap about much 
more than his drip, but he uses 
autotune as impeccably as Thug 
does. Gunna takes Thug at his 
most melodic and processes it to 
make it even more accessible. He 
has evolved into a more indepen-
dent artist at this point, but early 
in his career, the Thug influence 
could not be shirked. And, as an 
added bonus, he shares Young 
Thug’s 
left-of-center 
fashion 
choices.
Required 
listening: 
“Pedes-
trian” and “Mayors” featuring 
Hoodrich Pablo Juan.
Strick
Strick, 
simi-
lar to Duke, is a 
much more sub-
dued 
version 
of Young Thug. 
Take Young Thug 
at his vibiest and 
turn the anima-
tion and fanfair 
down 
to 
zero, 
and that’s Strick. 
He also takes on 
Thug’s more cal-
culated and lyri-
cal side, as he is 
a multi-platinum 
songwriter 
who 
has written for 
the likes of Tra-
vis Scott (“Coor-
dinate”) 
and 
Juicy 
J 
(“Bal-
lin”). He is the 
most up-and-coming of Thug’s 
signees, so keep an eye out for his 
new releases.
Required listening: “Wishing 
on a Star,” “Vevo” and “STS” fea-
turing Young Thug.
Lil Keed
Imagine the craziest of Young 
Thug’s flows and vocal inflec-
tion, and make a rapper out of 
it. That’s Lil Keed. In fact, Thug 
frequently refers to him as his 
son, which speaks volumes to the 
figurative passing of the torch 
from Thug to Keed. At one point, 
Thug even gifted him “Proud of 
Me,” an old, very sought after 
demo. Keed is the latest YSL 
signee to make a splash, espe-
cially with his recent tape Long 
Live Mexico. His only downfall 
is that he often leans too hard on 
his voice’s high pitch, a problem 
that Thug does not share, thanks 
to his use of modulation. 
The 
student 
is 
quickly 
approaching the skill of the mas-
ter, so it’ll be interesting to see 
how Keed’s career develops.

Required listening: “Proud of 
Me” featuring Young Thug and 
“Zoned Out.”
Lil Gotit
While Lil Gotit isn’t signed 
to YSL Records (he’s signed to 
Alamo, home of Lil Durk, anoth-
er YSL affiliate), he is more heav-
ily affiliated than it seems. He’s 
actually the younger brother of 
Lil Keed, who is no doubt a big 
influence on his sound. Gotit is 
like Thug at his most energetic. 
He’s bouncy, he’s having fun and 
he’s sure to leave his mark on 
listeners. He also has the same 
penchant for off-kilter beats as 
Thug does. 
He’s not trying 
to be convention-
al by any means, 
just like Young 
Thug.
Required 
lis-
tening: 
“Surf,” 

“Da 
Real 

HoodBabies”and 
“Drop the Top” 
featuring 
Lil 
Keed.
Dolly White and 
HiDoraah
Even 
Young 
Thug’s 
own 
sisters 
are 
his 
clones. These two 
embody the side 
of 
Thug 
that’s 
dedicated 
to 
flexing and shit 
talking. They’re 
really good at it, 
probably better than Thug is. 
HiDoraah has a full voice and on 
top of rapping, is good at singing 
too. Dolly White is little more 
gravel-voiced but is a better rap-
per. They complement each other 
well. They’ve got flows for days, 
but they can get a little stale. 
However, they just started rap-
ping seriously and don’t have 
many songs yet, so it’ll take time 
for them to develop their sound. 
That said, they are a great duo 
and are bound to be noticed in 
today’s rap climate.
Required 
listening: 
“Expen-
sive” and “Lay Down.”
Anyone can try to croon and 
chirp like Thug does, but it takes 
effort to do it and stand out from 
the clone crowd. Though the rap-
pers on the list started off purely as 
clones of Young Thug, they all show 
signs of breaking this mold, which 
speaks volumes to how influential 
Young Thug has been. Without 
Wayne, we wouldn’t have Kendrick 
or Thug; without Thug, we won’t 
have rap’s next superstar.

Art Fair season in Ann Arbor 
just ended, and, this year, I had a 
mission: to find a specific ring from 
a specific artist who had a booth at 
the fair two years ago. The prob-
lem was I only had a vague mem-
ory that the artist was a woman 
who made jewelry out of antique 
silverware with her husband. I 
tried Googling “antique silverware 
jewelry” beforehand, but there 
was a surprising number of people 
on Etsy who make things out of 
antique silverware. So, out into the 
field I went. 
The Ann Arbor Art Fair is a 
yearly affair and has been a city 
staple for the last 60 years. Art-
ists from all over the country 
flock to the streets, only to sit in a 
small, white booth in what is often 
90-degree heat. It’s magical. And, 
according to the Ann Arbor Dis-
trict Library archives, not much 
has changed. In a series of pho-
tos from the summer of 1971, art-
ists stood by their wares, just as 
they do today, and I, as a faithful 
Art Fairgoer, am still confused by 
some of the things people choose 
to make. For instance, take Jane 
Hawkins and her macramé, or Vic-
tor Ing and his prints, a style of art 
that is still favored by the Art Fair 
today. This year, I saw what looked 

like paintings but were actually 
images made entirely out of string. 
Vastly different mediums and sub-
jects, yet the artists still have their 
audience scratching their heads, 
wishing they could craft some-
thing similar.
The next closest thing to being 
able to do it yourself, of course, 
would be to buy it from the artist. 
It’s fulfilling to support an artist, to 
know that your hard-earned money 
is supporting a tangible thing that 
others can enjoy, rather than hand-
ing it off to the corporate entities 
that are so entrenched in our lives. 
That said, the masked capitalistic 
vibe of the Ann Arbor Art Fair did 
nothing to deter downtown busi-
nesses, local or otherwise. The 
fair is a time of sales galore from 
MDen to Urban Outfitters, Cherry 
Republic to Moosejaw. It’s not only 
a place to find eye-catching paint-
ings of seascapes, but also a new 
dress or hiking boots at half the 
price. This shouldn’t be surprising, 
though — in the 1985 Street Art 
Fair brochure, it’s revealed that the 
fair actually started as a partner to 
the Summer Bargain Days of local 
businesses. A fitting beginning for 
one of the biggest attractions Ann 
Arbor has to offer.
Aside from the actual art and 
the sales, the other appealing part 
of the fair is the people-watching. 
The number of times I saw some-
one walking around drinking from 
a full-sized fruit is surprisingly 

high for day-to-day life, but, at an 
art fair, what else would I expect? 
People come from all over the coun-
try, not only to showcase their art, 
but to look around and do some of 
their own shopping. I spoke to one 
woman doing just that as she vis-
ited the city from Texas. Though a 
seasoned art fair shopper, this was 
her first time at the Ann Arbor Art 
Fair. Even better, she was scoping 
out the competition for her son, 
the artist (what he actually makes, 
I didn’t quite catch.) Her goal was 
to figure out what people are doing 
and how they were doing it so he 
could adapt his techniques and 
stay relevant to the art fair circuit.
But where am I in my hunt for 
the ring? Sadly, after walking up 
and down the various branches 
of the fair, I found myself coming 
up empty. It seemed I was going 
to remain ringless, a sad fact given 
how I decided the Ann Arbor Art 
Fair was my moment to become 
a ring person. It’s not that there 
weren’t any rings; there were 
plenty of jewelers (and potters and 
painters) throughout the fair. I just 
couldn’t find the kind of ring I had 
been picturing ever since I lost the 
original in the depths of my grand-
parents’ couch.
Fear not. I persevered like any 
good shopper, kept an open mind 
and stumbled on some really great 
pieces that weren’t just rings. Fur-
ther down Liberty Street, closer to 
where it intersects Fifth Avenue, 

there was a man selling bowls. But 
not just any bowls, vegetabowls. 
(I’m mostly mentioning them here 
because of the magnificence of the 
pun.) Although an interesting con-
cept, I didn’t end up purchasing 
any because the bowls themselves 
weren’t really my idea of dinner-
ware. Instead, I found solace on 
Main street with Corbé, a Detroit-
based pottery company. The brand 
catches a shopper’s attention with 
mini vases in a white wire basket 
sitting just outside of the booth, 
but then it’s the patterns that 
force someone to really consider 
how great this pottery actually is. 
There’s a spotted design reminis-
cent of a dalmatian mixed in with 
strong oranges, blues and a speck-
led motif that somehow all came 
together into a cohesive aesthetic. 
My parents bought four of their 
mugs and a vase.
The most surprising part of this 
year’s art fair, though, was run-
ning into a Utah-based artist, The 
Bearded Jeweler. A first-timer, 
he and his wife both had booths 
on Thompson, just outside The 
Michigan Daily’s building. I knew 
his jewelry from a Sunday market 
in Park City where my whole ring 
hunt originated — which is also 
where his wife just launched her 
own brand. So, imagine my excite-
ment when I found out he was here 

in Ann Arbor! Though his pieces 
aren’t made from antique silver-
ware, they’re gorgeous in their 
own right, and both he and his wife 
were fun to talk to.
Despite the welcome surprise of 
running into The Bearded Jeweler, 
my ring hunt was still on, and I 
was getting frustrated. It was hot; 
I had worked four shifts at MDen 
with one more to go, and I was still 
ringless. What was a girl to do? As 
always, it was my mom who came 
to the rescue. Both my parents 
enjoy walking around the Art Fair. 
With both kids employed at stores 
in the heart of it, they had plenty of 
reason to stroll around the area for 
hours — serving as an extra pair of 
eyes on the lookout for some rings. 
It was on North University, 
booth NU714, that my quest for 
rings finally ended. Made out of 
a variety of silverware, the rings 
manage to be both delicate and 
edgy and a marvelous way to 
assuage my ringless woes.
The Ann Arbor Art Fair is a 
unique experience — some townies 
enjoy all it has to offer, in spite of 
the absurd heat and its painstaking 
traffic, while others leave town that 
weekend to avoid the tourists that 
descend on Ann Arbor. Whichever 
way you choose, just remember to 
shop local, and send me an email if 
you see any rings worth wearing.

Ten 
presidential 
candidates 
addressed African American voters 
at the 110th National Association 
of the Advancement of Colord 
People National Convention on 

Wednesday morning at the Cobo 
Center in Detroit. 
The 
presidential 
candidates 
forum included nine Democratic 
candidates: former Vice President 
Joe Biden; Sen. Cory Booker; 
South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg; 
Julián Castro, former Secretary of 
Housing and Urban Development; 

Sen. Kamala Harris; Sen. Amy 
Klobuchar; former Texas Rep. Beto 
O’Rourke; Sen. Bernie Sanders 
and Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Bill 
Weld, a former Massachusetts 
governor challenging President 
Donald Trump for the Republican 
nomination, was also present.
Trump has said he “very much 

wanted” to attend the convention 
but could not because of changes 
to the date and format. He said 
he agreed to deliver a speech, but 
NAACP wanted to engage in a 
question-and-answer session.
In a press release ahead of the 
event, Derrick Johnson, NAACP 
president and CEO, emphasized 
the importance of ensuring Black 
voters are able to make their voices 
heard and counted. 
“The 
upcoming 
2020 
presidential election is one of 
the most pivotal elections in 
our lifetime and will be heavily 
influenced by the Black electorate,” 
Johnson wrote. “We must ensure 
we’re electing officials who will 
help us set policy priorities that 
will bring about positive change 
for communities of color.”
In 2016, Black voter turnout 
decreased for the first time in 20 
years, after surpassing white voter 

turnout for the first time in 2008 
and then in 2012. In 2016, 42,598 
fewer Detroiters cast their ballots 
than in 2012 — and Trump won 
Michigan with less than 11,000 
votes. 
Each 
candidate 
was 
given 
10 minutes to appeal to Black 
Americans in the audience and 
watching at home: two minutes of 
opening remarks, seven minutes 
of answering questions posed by 
moderator CNN journalist April 
Ryan and one minute for their 
closing statement. 
Warren 
addressed 
the 
audience first, discussing her 
housing plan, which features a 
“first-of-its-kind” down payment 
assistance 
program 
for 
low-
income families living in formerly 
redlined neighborhoods.

The other day, I wore a black 
button down shirt. It was quite 
simple, with no extra embroidery 
or anything, just an ordinary black 
button down. Well, maybe there’s 
one exception. My buttons were on 
the left side. Yep, that’s right folks. 
I wore a men’s black button down 
shirt. And, it was the most interest-
ing experience I’ve had to date.
A couple weekends ago, I went 
into the men’s section of H&M, 
which was placed all the way 
upstairs. I took the journey up the 
escalator to a section of clothing 
that combined comfort with my 
simple style. It was nerve-wrack-
ing to search through a section of 
clothing that wasn’t made for me. 
It was scary to try and figure out 
the men’s pants size that would 

fit my thick thighs and wide hips. 
It was uncomfortable watching 
onlookers question why my Black 
female body was upstairs when 
I so clearly belonged one story 
down. Then, I came across a black 
button down shirt.
I thought, wow, a shirt that’s 
casual yet somewhat dressy and 
cheap. Wow, I can wear this with 
so many of my dress pants. Wow, 
this will go great with my saddle 
shoes. Wow, I’m gonna buy this 
before they kick me out–the store 
was about to close. Then I went to 
the counter where a young man 
was working. I placed my black 
button down on the counter along 
with a pair of green pants and blue 
shorts. As I placed my clothes on 
the counter, he gave me a look that 
I’ll never forget. It was a mixture 
of “why the fuck are you here” 
and “what the fuck are you doing.” 
Nevertheless, he rang me up, I paid 

for my three items of clothing, and 
left the store. A few weeks later, I’d 
see this look again.
On Tuesday, I was met with 
the most attention I’ve ever seen 
standing on the street while leav-
ing my internship and waiting for 
the bus, here in Los Angeles. As I 
stood at the bus stop, I got so many 
stares that I thought one of my 
buttons was undone. At first, I was 
confused as to why so many peo-
ple kept staring at me in disdain. 
Finally, a man stared at me long 
enough for me to realize what the 
problem was: my buttons were on 
the wrong side.
This man stared directly at my 
shirt. We locked eyes for a couple 
of seconds while he was check-
ing out my buttons, and repul-
sion filled his eyes. I’m not sure if 
it was simply because I was a girl 
wearing a boy shirt, or because I 
was wearing extremely feminine 

dress pants. Maybe he couldn’t 
understand the idea of uniting the 
gender biased system of clothing 
that society implores? Or maybe 
he just hated that my buttons were 
on the left, when they ought to 
always reside on the right? I’m not 
sure where his aversion stemmed 
from, but it helped me understand 
why I was getting so much atten-
tion. Women and men alike looked 
at me like they never have before, 
each time reviewing the buttons 
that lay on the left. I felt objecti-
fied in every sense of the word, my 
clothing turning me into a foreign 
object. Nevertheless, I stood there 
in all my left-sided, button-wear-
ing splendor and waited for the 
bus.
When the bus finally came, I 
stood up until it was time for me to 
reach my next stop and catch the 
second of three buses to my next 
destination. During my commute, 

I started to think about the expe-
rience and began to smile. A year 
ago, I would have never voluntarily 
gone into the men’s section of any 
store and bought an item of cloth-
ing, no matter how much I wanted 
to. I would never wear that same 
shirt to a place of work or anywhere 
my appearance would be judged. A 
year ago, I never would have come 
out to my parents. Here I was on a 
bus in LA, a completely different 
person from a year before, and all 
I could do was smile about my pro-
gression. A year ago, I didn’t even 
know the buttons on men’s shirts 
were on a different side, and here I 
was getting gazed at in disdain for 
one of the most freeing experiences 
of my life. There I was, in a differ-
ent place, in a different time being 
my most authentic self in my LBD 
(left-sided button down). I’ll take all 
the stupid stares in the world to feel 
forever free in my LBD.

Little change in approach for OSU’s Day against Michigan

CHICAGO — If it ain’t broke, 
don’t fix it. That seems to be the 
mantra for first year Ohio State 
coach Ryan Day.
Day takes the reigns from 
Urban Meyer, who after seven 
years as the Buckeyes’ head 
coach 
won 
three 
conference 
championships and the national 
championship in 2014. Not to 
mention Meyer also finished 
with a perfect 7-0 record against 
Michigan throughout his tenure 
— big shoes to fill for Day as he 
steps into his first season as a 
head coach.
But Day spent the last two 
seasons with the Buckeyes as 
the offensive coordinator, and 
a sense of continuity may be a 
key for the program’s continued 
success.
“You’re talking about one of 
the most successful coaches in 
the history of the game,” Day 
said. “I try not to focus on what 
I might change and things like 

that because we’ve kept so many 
things in place.”
And as for a change in approach 
to the rivalry game against the 
Wolverines?
“No,” Day said. “It worked. It 
worked just fine.”
Michigan’s 
national 
championship aspirations were 
halted by Ohio State in the final 
regular season game in two of the 
past three years. The inability 
to defeat the Buckeyes has been 
one of the biggest criticisms of 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
throughout his four years at the 
helm. For Ohio State, it has been 
a badge of pride.
“I think the thing I learned 
from Urban (Meyer) the minute 
I got there is that you work the 
game every day,” Day said. “And 
the way to honor and respect the 
rivalry is to work it every day. 
And we do. It’s a part of what 
we do whether it’s recruiting, or 
we have periods where we have 
in practice where we call it the 
‘team up north’ drill. So, we live 
it every day. It’s something that 
we always have in the back of our 

minds.”
Day and Ohio State have 
their work cut out for them if 
they hope to continue the trend 
against Michigan. Departing is 
quarterback 
Dwayne 
Haskins 
along with four of its five 
starting offensive linemen from 
last season — dissimilar to the 
Wolverines who have experience 
and 
depth 
at 
the 
starting 
offensive line position along with 
quarterback Shea Patterson who 
will begin his second season with 
Michigan.
By the time that the two rivals 
face off to end the regular season, 
Day hopes that inexperience will 
no longer be a factor.
“I think that by the time you 
get to that point, you’re really 
not young anymore,” Day said. “I 
think you have experience, like 
Chris Olave is great example, he 
was young as a freshman in that 
game and then he went on to block 
a punt and score two touchdowns 
in the rivalry game and then in 
the Big Ten Championship Game. 
So, I think when you get to that 
game, by then, youth really isn’t a 

factor anymore.”
When Day lines up across 
Harbaugh for the first time, 
the Buckeyes will hope to see 

continued 
success 
while 
the 
Wolverines hope that it was 
Meyer that was the bane to 
Michigan’s success.

Rosen and Smith: New team, new country and a new challenge

Twenty 
hours 
before 
the 
plane 
containing 
delegates 
representing 11 different Big Ten 
volleyball teams touched down 
onto foreign soil, all the players 
met up for a brief practice.
 
It 
was 
in 
Chicago, 
where they spent 45 minutes 
familiarizing themselves with 
one another before flying to 
Japan for the 2019 Big Ten 
volleyball Foreign Tour. 
 
And then they headed 
off, 
concluding 
their 
brief 
introduction.
***
 
Natalie 
Smith 
spent 
the majority of her first two 
years at Michigan as a defensive 
specialist. 
After 
all, 
career-
starter libero Jenna Lerg did her 
job, and did it well. There was 
no need for a different player to 
get reps at the position during 
her tenure. But upon Lerg’s 
graduation, the spot opened up, 
and Smith rose to the occasion.

 
During 
the 
spring 
season, 
Smith 
was 
the 
Wolverines’ primary libero, but 
even so, her reps were limited. 
There were only seven games 
over the course of a month. So the 
trip to Japan to face high-caliber 
teams — college and professional 
— proved valuable for a player 
getting adjusted to a new role.
“You know, it was a really 
good opportunity for her,” said 
Michigan coach Mark Rosen. 
“Being a younger libero, trying 
to step in and trying to take over 
for Jenna, and that role, that’s a 
big shoe to fill. I thought it was 
a great extra opportunity for 
her, another two weeks to play 
volleyball, another opportunity 
to be in that role.”
The 
opportunity 
wasn’t 
without its challenges. There was 
only one libero spot, and Penn 
State’s Jenna Hampton eyed it 
accordingly. In the end, after 
competing for it, Smith earned 
the role and Hampton became 
the designed defensive specialist.
What stood out to Rosen 
that made Smith qualified for 

the position was her skill as a 
first-touch passer and — taking 
from previous role as defensive 
specialist — her defense.
“She ended up playing libero 
in pretty much every match,” 
Rosen said. “And the other played 
(defensive specialist) and part 
of that is because she passed 
consistently, she defended really 
consistently, 
and 
she 
played 
really well.”
It was a role she had to 
transition over to, but as the team 
ironed out the growing pains 
of playing with new faces, she 
learned the nooks and crannies 
of the position.

Whereas Smith will debut in 
the fall as Michigan’s primary 
starting 
libero 
for 
the 
first 
time, this isn’t Mark Rosen’s 
first rodeo. Having been a head 
coach for 27 years total, 20 
with the Wolverines, Rosen’s 
acquired an array of knowledge 
at the position. He’s even coached 
similar USA teams, but to him, 
the tour was “a very unique 
experience.”

“You’re coaching players that 
you’ve actually coached against, 
so that’s a weird dynamic.”
Despite 
going 
into 
each 
season preparing Michigan for 
the strength of the opposition, 
having the same players you work 

so hard to exploit now under 
your tutelage and having to 
make a team like that mesh was 
a completely different ball park.

Harbaugh looking to play two quarterbacks each game this season

CHICAGO — The day he 
transferred to Michigan, many 
assumed that Shea Patterson 
would 
win 
the 
starting 
quarterback spot. And he did, 
starting every game in his first 
season for the Wolverines. 
Now, with a full season under 
his belt in addition to another 
offseason 
to 
understand 
the 
offense and develop chemistry 
with 
the 
receiving 
corps, 
Patterson seems primed to evolve 
into the quarterback pundits 
expected him to be when he came 
out of high school as a five-star 
recruit. 
But 
Michigan 
coach 
Jim 
Harbaugh threw a curveball at 
the Big Ten Media Day on Friday.
“Yes, 
I 
do 
(see 
Dylan 
McCaffrey playing in addition to 
Patterson) where it stands right 
now,” Harbaugh said. “That could 
change later or not, as I seem them 
both playing possibly. Where it 
stands right now, I see it as maybe 
redefining what a starter is.

“I’m really not talking about 
playing them both at the same 
time when I say that I’m going 
to play them both in games. It’s 
really going to be they’re both 
playing quarterback during the 
same game, and where it stands 
now, in every game.” 
This is drastically different 
from what Harbaugh has done 
in the past, though, especially in 
his initial years as 
head coach when 
the 
quarterback 
situation 
was 
more in flux. But 
with perhaps his 
most 
talented 
quarterback 
during his tenure 
as head coach in 
Ann Arbor, why 
would Harbaugh 
introduce another 
man into a position race that 
seemed set?
The answer lies in the offensive 
scheme 
the 
Wolverines 
are 
progressively growing towards — 
the spread offense.
With new coordinator Josh 

Gattis at the helm of an offense 
that returns nine of its 11 starters 
and a spread philosophy based 
on his “speed in space” motto, 
Michigan has not one but two 
quarterbacks it feels confident 
playing at anchor of the offense.
“As I said, not only Shea 
and Dylan are really good and 
suited for (the spread offense),” 
Harbaugh said, “but I’d say Joe 
Milton as well and 
Cade McNamara. 
And 
most 
quarterbacks are 
coming out of that 
type of system.” 
Running 
multiple 
quarterbacks 
in a game isn’t 
necessarily new to 
the college game 
— some of the 
decade’s most successful teams 
have put multiple guys under 
center in each game and found 
success. And with McCaffrey’s 
mobility as well as Patterson’s 
experience 
running 
run-pass 
options — a staple of the spread 

offense — the Wolverines’ feel 
comfortable 
approaching 
the 
season with this strategy.
“I trust both of them with 
the ball,” said senior guard 
Ben Bredeson. “They’re both 
extraordinary athletes, both of 
them can run the offense, both 
of them take care of the football 

really well. So I would have no 
problem with those guys, either 
both being back there, one or the 
other being back there, I trust 
them both.
“ I’m sure whatever situation 
they’re presented, they’re going 
to do well. They’re going to 
thrive.”

Senior quarterback Shea Patterson may split time as a starter this season.

Amid starting battle, depth at offensive line beginning to develop

CHICAGO — At the start of 
the 2018 season, the depth at 
offensive line was an area of 
question.
There was no clear starter 
at either tackle position, and 
Michigan was coming off a 
season in which it allowed the 
second-most sacks in the Big Ten. 
But over the course of the season, 
the offensive line developed and 
finished tied for the third-fewest 
sacks allowed in the conference.
Fast forward to the present. 
The Wolverines are returning 
four of last year’s five starters, 
with the only question being 
who will win the battle for the 
starting right tackle position.
“I think the way things stand 
right now, our offensive line is 
pretty darn good,” said Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh. “Maybe as 
good as we’ve had.”
Unlike the questions that faced 
the offensive line last season — 
which were more of a concern — 
the question this year is more of 

a testament to the depth that has 
finally developed up front for the 
Wolverines.
Senior guard Ben Bredeson is 
a part of that slew of returning 
lineman. 
He 
believes 
the 
competition for the final tackle 
position 
between 
redshirt 
freshman 
Jalen 
Mayfield 
and 
junior 
Andrew 
Stueber 
couldn’t 
be any closer. 
“It’s 
very 
close,” 
Bredeson 
said. “And that’s 
just not me trying 
to hide anything. 
It’s 
genuinely 
something that’s 
going to get solved 
in camp between 
(Mayfield) and Stueber. Once 
that happens then we’ll know 
from there. But not even anybody 
in the building knows right now.”
Last 
season, 
Mayfield 
appeared in three games while 
Stueber 
appeared 
in 
all 
14 
games and started one. Stueber 
established himself as a solid 

option to be a starter this season, 
while 
Mayfield 
continues 
to 
impress with his development.
“I think Jalen’s going to get a lot 
of significant time whether that 
be a starter or whether that be 
a backup,” Bredeson said. “He’ll 
play a lot. He’s a tremendous 
athlete — a great 
athlete 
as 
an 
offensive lineman. 
He’s very mobile, 
he’s 
quick, 
he’s 
strong. 
He’s 
working 
on 
his 
technique 
every 
single day. He’s 
a guy that when 
we line up next to 
each other it’s not 
like I look over 
there and worry. 
Jalen is going to be fine. He does 
a great job and he’s only getting 
better.” 
Harbaugh was also quick to 
praise Mayfield and added that 
every time he watches film, he 
notices “No. 73.” 
Regardless 
of 
who 
wins 
the job, both Harbaugh and 

Bredeson had high praise for the 
development of the offensive line 
and the work that offensive line 
coach Ed Warinner has done.
“Ed 
Warinner, 
he 
did 
a 
great job for us last year as the 
offensive line coach,” Harbaugh 
said. “Our run game improved. 

Our pass protection is better. We 
gave up less sacks. We saw the 
players improve a lot individually 
and collectively.”
What was once seen as a 
gaping hole on the depth chart is 
now becoming one of Michigan’s 
strong suits.

Howard moving at a fast pace, acclimating to the new job

On Monday, Michigan coach 
Juwan Howard sat at the front of 
four rectangular tables, pieced 
together to form a square. He 
invited Michigan basketball beat 
writers from around the area for 
lunch, his first interaction with 
media since his introductory 
press conference a month ago, 
hoping to break the ice well 
ahead of the season. Taking only 
a couple bites from his sandwich 
the 
entire 
time, 
he 
fielded 
questions, slightly reserved at 
first but opening up about his 
kids, favorite sports, and first 
impressions. 
Some 
questions 
he struggled to address during 
his introduction came back into 
light, and this time, he gave more 
concrete answers. 
After 
giving 
a 
somewhat 
ambiguous answer regarding his 
recruiting philosophy in May, 
claiming that he had no strategy 
planned out then, Howard has 
made a splash in the recruiting 
scene — of his nine offers thus 
far, seven have been to five-star 
recruits. And for the most part, 
they haven’t stepped foot onto 
campus yet, a stark contrast from 
John Beilein, who never offered 
players until they visited Ann 
Arbor.
But with no head coaching 
experience and little to show 
on tape as a result, Howard is 
keeping his sales pitch close to 
the vest. 
“I don’t wanna give everybody 
out there our style of play,” 
Howard said. “You guys have a 
job to do and one thing I say is 
going to go running. And I have 
a lot of competition out there 
and I got a lot of competition 
that’s basically saying, ‘Hey, this 
guy has never coached before’ 
or ‘This is their style so do you 
wanna go there?’ I’d rather bring 
them to campus, show them the 
film, and maybe see a practice or 
workout, and then we’ll go from 
there.”
His name and pedigree as a 
player and assistant coach with 
the Miami Heat have gotten the 
Wolverines in the doors with 
recruits 
Beilein 
might 
have 
never even considered.

His greatest selling point? 
Family.
Howard 
often 
described 
his teammates from his Fab 
Five times as his brothers. 
Overwhelmed by emotion at 
his 
introduction, 
reminiscing 
over 
his 
days 
as 
an 
athlete, 
he 
emphasized 
bringing 
that 
same 
love 
and 
brotherhood 
back to Michigan 
basketball.
He’s 
already 
showing 
his 
commitment 
to 
the 
concept 
of 
family with his 
incoming freshmen, guard Franz 
Wagner and wing Cole Bajema.
Wagner 
committed 
to 
Michigan earlier in July without 
ever 
having 
met 
Howard. 
Representing 
Germany 
in 
the FIBA Under-18 European 
Championship, 
he’s 
been 
missing 
team 
workouts. 
But 
this weekend, Howard is finally 
getting a chance to meet his 
coveted freshman.

“(I’ve met him) via Facetime,” 
Howard said. “Flying there to go 
watch him play on the 27th. So 
I’ll be there the 27th, 28th, 29th 
to watch him in person just to let 
him know that family is coming 
to support him. Because we’re 
family, he’s a part 
of my family.”
Not 
only 
is 
he 
traveling 
to 
Greece to watch 
Wagner but the 
team’s 
workouts 
this 
summer 
are 
centered 
around Bajema’s 
schedule, 
who’s 
currently 
part 
of 
the 
Summer 
Bridge 
Scholars 
Program 
at 
Michigan, which allows him 
to enroll in and complete three 
classes for credit before the fall 
of his freshman year. 
“I do not want Cole to be 
isolated, where we workout in 
the morning and then Cole is 
busy with the Bridge Program 
and he doesn’t get a chance to 
work out and interact with his 
teammates or coaches,” Howard 

said. “We could work him out 
individually and the players can 
have their own workout in the 
afternoon, but it’s unfair to an 
incoming freshman. 
“We’re 
talking 
about 
brotherhood, family and building 
a connection. I 
do it when Cole 
is available and 
we 
all 
can 
be 
participating.”
The 
veterans 
are 
starting 
to 
buy into Howard’s 
culture as well 
— an adjustment 
for players like 
Zavier 
Simpson, 
Isaiah 
Livers 
and Jon Teske who were very 
comfortable with the way Beilein 
operated. But just like the players 
are learning Howard, he is also 
learning them.
“(Simpson’s) 
been 
an 
extension of the coaching staff 
and why I say that is because 
his leadership, his work ethic is 
off the charts,” Howard said. “I 
do not know how the message 
delivered but I heard he was 

doing 
three-a-days 
which 
I 
respect to him. That shows that 
he’s committed, he wants to get 
better … So this summer, I had 
a meeting with him about ‘You 
have the best work ethic. You can 
work hard, but the key is to work 
smart. 
Three-a-
days is not what 
we’re looking for, 
it’s not good for 
your body.’
“You 
know, 
I looked at him 
and he gave me 
that look, thought 
he was about to 
chew 
my 
head 
off. But he’s been 
phenomenal, 
man. Wish I had him more than 
one year, he’s a coach’s dream.”
This is just the beginning 
for Howard, who continues to 
get acclimated to his new job 
while putting his methods up 
for trial-and-error as a first-year 
head coach. But for how much 
Howard has been doing in his 
first two months, he doesn’t just 
have a start. 
He’s hit the ground running.

I don’t wanna 
give everybody 
out there our 
style of play.

Because we’re 
family, he’s 
a part of my 
family.
