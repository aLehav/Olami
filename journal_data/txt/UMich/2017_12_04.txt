On an illuminated stage in the 

auditorium of the University of 
Michigan Museum of Art, the 
stories of people affected by HIV 
were presented in forms ranging 
from dances and slam poetry to 
statistics and HIV testing site 
information at the annual HIV 
Monologues presented by the 
University of Michigan’s chapters 
of National Council of Negro 
Women and the Black Student 
Union this weekend. 

LSA 
senior 
Margarett 

McBride, president of the council, 
said the event aimed to increase 
awareness about HIV.

“There was a lot of talk about 

HIV in the past when Magic 
Johnson came out having it, but 
since then, it is not as big of a 
topic,” McBride said. “We want 
to start conversations about what 
to do when your partner has HIV, 
and how to talk about being safe.”

LSA 
junior 
Taylor 
Moore 

said she came to the event in 
part because she is currently 
taking a class on HIV and AIDS 
through the American Culture 
Department.

“I 
knew 
most 
of 
the 

information presented here, but 
I came because I still believe in 
the message,” she said. “A lot 
of people don’t view HIV as a 
problem in the United States, and 
I believe that is due to the lack of 
education, especially in the Black 

In light of the ongoing conflicts 

of racial profiling and police 
brutality, a five-person panel 
titled “Minorities, Social Justice 
and Police Enforcement: An Open 
Discussion” was held Friday, 
encouraging civil discourse on 
campus.

Topics 
of 
racial 
injustice, 

student activism and minority 
underrepresentation 
were 

present during the conversation, 
moderated by Freyja Harris, chief 
diversity and inclusion officer of 
the School of Music, Theatre & 
Dance. The panel highlighted the 
school’s production of “Blood at 
the Root,” which tells the story 
of the Jena Six — six Black high 
school students in Louisiana 
charged with attempted murder 
of a white classmate. The play’s 
timeliness with regard to recent 
incidents of racism occurring on 
campus led to a discussion during 
the panel.

Theatre & Drama assistant 

professor 
Jose 
Casas, 
the 

multicultural 
and 
diversity 

director for the American Alliance 
for 
Theatre 
and 
Education, 

emphasized the importance of 
using art to incite activism in its 
audience.

“It’s the hope that these type 

of plays, and more of these types 
of plays, can actually have people 
going home and thinking, and 
possibility stimulating, some sort 
of action on a personal and even 
community level,” Casas said.

Panelist 
Bryant 
Purvis, 
a 

member of the Jena Six, praised 
the Theatre & Drama Department 
for its portrayal of the experiences 
he and the other Black students 
faced. On the other hand, Purvis 
stressed the importance of being 
proactive in facing injustice and 
not sitting back when a problem 
isn’t personal.

“We can’t wait until this 

happens to our brothers, sons 
and fathers to respond,” Purvis 

said. “We must have those 
conversations, we must educate 
ourselves … I saw firsthand what 
we can do once we unite.”

LSA senior Anushka Sarkar, 

Central 
Student 
Government 

president, 
acknowledged 
the 

current 
tensions 
on 
campus 

regarding 
race, 
and 
later 

answered questions from the 
audience on next steps to ensure 
safety and inclusion within the 
student population. Sarkar noted 

the impact of social media on 
police brutality and the harmful 
intersection between sharing the 
facts of an issue and spreading 
false information.

“It’s very, very difficult to 

share objective and accurate 
information on social media, 
and to prevent wildfires of false 
information 
from 
spreading,” 

Sarkar said.

These issues stem from a 

After 35 years in Congress, 

U.S. 
Rep. 
Sander 
Levin, 

D-Royal Oak, will find a new 
home at the University of 
Michigan’s Ford School of 
Public Policy.

Levin 
announced 
in 
an 

op-ed he will not be seeking 
re-election to a 19th term, and 
instead told the Detroit Free 
Press he will start writing and 
teaching at the Public Policy 
School.

“They want me to talk to the 

students at the school about 
leadership, because they say 
they teach and teach all these 
courses and want to really have 
students talk further about 
how 
they 
implement 
what 

they’ve learned,” Levin said. 

Levin said he loved his 

career in public service, but 
felt it was time to give someone 
else a chance. He said he counts 
defeating 
the 
privatization 

of Social Security, helping 
pass Affordable Care Act and 
protecting the auto industry 
during the recession as some of 
his greatest victories.

Members of the Lecturers’ Employee Organization lead a demonstration for higher pay and more bargaining rights outside Palmer Commons Friday.

CAMPUS LIFE

On Friday about 50 University 

of Michigan community members, 
many of whom were members 
of 
the 
Lecturers’ 
Employee 

Organization, gathered at Palmer 
Commons to rally against the 

administration’s considerationof 
white 
supremacist 
Richard 

Spencer’s request to speak on 
campus. 
The 
event 
brought 

together members of LEO who 
were fighting for their rights as 
workers and in opposition to the 
Spencer event.

LEO includes lecturers from 

all three University campuses: 
Ann Arbor, Dearborn and Flint. 

Founded in 2003, the union 
bargains for 1,500 lecturers.

Also 
in 
attendance 
were 

members of other local unions 
and representatives from student 
organizations such as Radfun 
and Young Democratic Socialists 
of America. Washtenaw County 
Commissioner Michelle Deatrick 
and state Rep. Yousef Rabhi, 
D-Ann Arbor, attended as well.

The rally took place after LEO’s 

fourth bargaining session with the 
administration in recent weeks 
to obtain enhanced job security, 
higher 
wages 
and 
improved 

benefits. At the rally, members 
called for such demands.

Each week, The Michigan Daily 

will be publishing a wrap-up of the 
most important bills proposed in 
Michigan Legislature over the past 
seven days:

HB 5286-5294 and SB 674-

682: These bills, proposed by 
House and Senate Democrats, 
would provide more oversight and 
accountability for charter schools 
and the organizations that run 
them. The bills aim to give parents 
the information necessary to make 
informed decisions on education 
options and where their children 
can go to school.

In a press release on the

House 
Democrats 

website, House Democratic Floor 
Leader 
Rep. 
Christine 
Greig, 

D-Farmington

said 
the 

bills are necessary to hold schools 
accountable and inform parents.

“When we send our kids off to 

school in the morning, we want to 
know that they’re getting the best 
education possible — no matter 
which school they go to,” she said. 
“While we have rules in place to 
hold traditional and charter schools 
accountable, we have no systems

Beginning Dec. 4, Nadia 

Bazzy will begin her role 
as director of the Office of 
Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs, 
replacing 
former 
director 

Trelawny Boynton, who served 
the University of Michigan 
community 
for 
almost 
20 

years.

As a unit in the Office of 

Student 
Life, 
MESA 
staff 

work 
to 
promote 
student 

development 
and 
cultural 

opportunities, 
while 
also 

empowering members of the 
entire 
campus 
surrounding 

issues of diversity, inclusion 
and social justice work. Their 
work is spread across four core 
areas — consisting of programs 
and 
outreach, 
student 

engagement, 
education 
and 

training, and leadership for 
social change — and plays 
a vital role in carrying out 
the values delineated in the 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
plan.

In 
an 
email 
interview, 

E. 
Royster 
Harper, 
the 

University’s 
vice 
president 

for student life, described 
Bazzy’s 
experience 
in 

fostering 
inclusive 
spaces 

on campus as well as with 
educating 
and 
supporting 

students to fulfill their roles 
as productive members of a 
global community.

“It is with pleasure that 

I share that Nadia Bazzy 
will join the MESA team as 
the new director beginning 
December 4, 2017,” she said. 
“Nadia’s passion for student 
and community engagement 
through education and support 

to build inclusive spaces and 
her past record of forging 
innovative 
advancements 

that prepare our students to 
be global citizens make her 
an ideal fit for this important 
role.”

Last year, Bazzy served 

as interim director of the 
University’s 
Sexual 
Assault 

Prevention 
and 
Awareness 

Center. Previously assistant 
director 
of 
the 
Office 
of 

Student Conflict Resolution, 
she oversaw SAPAC through 
the completion of the school 
year as organization leaders 
searched 
for 
a 
permanent 

director.

In a statement, La Casa 

criticized the decision making 
process, in which Bazzy was 
chosen. 
According 
to 
the 

statement, the University had 
informed La Casa that the 
search for a new director had 

not yet begun and had 
implied La Casa would have 
influence in the process as 
a part to increase Latinx 
representation 
in 
the 

administration.

“Our 
community 

must express our deep 
disatisfaction, not with the 
individual 
appointed 
as 

the new director, but in a 
hiring process that denied 
the Latinx voice and was 
not conducted in an open 
and transparent manner,” 
the statement read.

Harper 
emphasized 

Bazzy’s 
level 
of 

commitment 
to 
the 

University 
community, 

as seen through her work 
with organizations such 
as SAPAC, the Michigan 
Roundtable for Diversity 
and Inclusion, and Student 
Life’s 
Intercultural 

Development 
Inventory. 

Furthermore, Harper said 
Bazzy’s unique expertise 
in dealing with trauma

Public Policy senior Nadine 

Jawad, 
Central 
Student 

Government vice president, has 
been awarded the prestigious 
Rhodes 
Scholarship 
after 

competing against nominees 
from across the country during 
an intensive application and 
interview process.

This year, four students 

from 
the 
University 
made 

it to the finals — a number 
that Henry Dyson, director 
of the LSA Office of National 
Scholarships and Fellowships, 

said has been unmatched any 
other year.

“All four of the students 

we nominated this year were 
invited to interviews: Nadine, 
Yiran 
Liu 
and 
Jonathan 

Williams in Chicago, Lauren 
Shepard in San Francisco,” 
he said. “In my knowledge 
at 
least, 
having 
all 
four 

nominees make it to the finals 
is unprecedented for U-M. It is 
a tremendous accomplishment 
even for those who didn’t win 
the scholarship itself.”

The 
Rhodes 
Scholarship 

— according to the ONSF — 
funds two to three years of 
graduate 
study 
at 
Oxford 

University across all fields 

of discipline, during which 
students are invited to pursue 
either a research-based or 
teaching-based 
master’s 
or 

doctoral degree. Since the 
scholarship’s 
conception 
in 

1902, 25 University alumni 
have won the scholarship — a 
notable feat due to the fact only 
32 scholars are selected from 
across the country each year.

Jawad 
described 
the 

emotions 
she 
experienced 

immediately after learning of 
her selection. She said she was 
overwhelmed by the immense 
opportunities 
suddenly 

becoming available to her due 
to her new status as a Rhodes 
scholar, especially as she has 

worked so hard for her family 
and community’s sake.

“In the moments leading 

up to the announcement, they 
began describing how hard 
it was to pick the winners 
from the group. My legs were 
literally shaking and my name 
was the first announced. I 
started tearing up immediately, 
but really was just too stunned 
to think. I remember thinking, 
‘I’m a Rhodes scholar’ then I 
started thinking, ‘Oh my God, 
I’m moving to England this 
year.’ It all sort of happened 
so fast. My mom was waiting 
in the lobby downstairs and I

University. He credits lecturers 
with enabling his success in 
higher education, beginning with 
the classes he first took in 2002 at 
Henry Ford Community College.

“I remember when I first 

started, I was so nervous,” he 
said. “I didn’t know what I was 
doing and I would stay after class, 
and it was lecturers who would 
sit down and take time to help 
me understand the concepts, to 
understand what a thesis is and a 
body and a conclusion for a paper 
are.”

At 
the 
rally, 
Villanueva 

thanked the lecturers who have 
worked with him over the years.

“It was the office hours I went 

to, it was the time after class 
with you, the lecturers, that this 
spring I’m going to walk out of 
here, a 37-year-old husband and 

father, as an undergrad from the 
University of Michigan,” he said. 
“You guys have helped me to 
understand the world better and 
I’m going to walk out of here with 
an elite education.”

While this was the final rally of 

the term, LEO plans on returning 
to the bargaining table every 
Friday until union contracts 
expire in April 2018.

LEO President Ian Robinson, a 

sociology lecturer and associate 
research scientist, said he believes 
the lecturers deserve increased 
compensation 
given 
their 

importance to the University. 

“We need your help to win 

at the bargaining table, where 
we have demands to ensure 
sure that lecturers get paid 
what we deserve based on our 
contributions to this University, 
which are substantial,” he said.

An analysis by Howard Bunsis, 

an accounting professor at Eastern 
Michigan University, found that 
lecturers at the University of 

Michigan provide more than 
40 percent of teaching in first- 
and second-year undergraduate 
classes. Additionally, lecturers 
generate $462 million in revenue 
for the University, but receive 
compensation equivalent to $85 
million.

LEO Vice President Kirsten 

Herold held a sign that read: “We 
moonlight to make ends meet. So, 
where’s the $377 million we made 
for U-M last year?”

“We need to win here with 

real 
improvements 
so 
that 

other 
lecturers, 
adjuncts, 

whatever they’re called, at other 
institutions can go back to their 
employers and say, ‘Michigan did 
it, so can you,’” she said.

According 
to 
the 
Bunsis 

analysis, the median salary for 
full-time lecturers is less than 
$60,000, while the median for 
clinical faculty is nearly $160,000.

LEO member Margot Finn, 

a lecturer in Applied Liberal 
Arts and the Program in the 

Environment, spoke at the rally, 
comparing the importance of 
bargaining to that of voting.

“Even when it’s a pain in the 

ass to go, even when the options 
are not optimal and even when 
I’m not guaranteed the results 
I want, it’s still something that 
a lot of people before me fought 
for me to get to do,” she said. “All 
of us know that lecturers do not 
get what they deserve. We are 
highly qualified teachers, many of 
whom spent years cultivating our 
subject matter expertise.”

Speakers at the rally also 

addressed the recent student 
protests, as LEO recently released 
its own statement in opposition 
to allowing Spencer to speak on 
campus.

Hoi An Pham, an organizer 

from 
Stop 
Spencer 
at 
the 

University of Michigan, spoke 
about the role lecturers have 
played in her college experience 
as well as LEO’s stance on 
Spencer’s request.

“Lecturers 
have 
further 

shown support toward students 
regarding the recent campus 
climate,” 
Pham 
said. 
“Their 

call to student safety is one that 
the entire administration has 
ignored, and it says something 
that the lecturers are willing to 
prioritize us as students when the 
administration, all of whom have 
job security, cannot.”

LEO 
Ann 
Arbor 
co-chair 

Shelley Manis said LEO and the 
student organizations that make 
up the Stop Spencer coalition 
agree white supremacy should not 
have a platform at the University.

“It may seem like we have 

two separate purposes, LEO 
and the student orgs, and in 
a way we do, and at the same 
time, we feel like it’s our job at 
LEO to keep white supremacy 
out of this campus,” she said. 
“We 100 percent support the 
student orgs who are doing 
everything they can to be heard 
and we want to amplify them, 

and we very much appreciate 
them amplifying us.”

Robinson 
emphasized 
the 

need ensure student safety. 
He also discussed how the 
Republican tax bill recently 
passed 
by 
the 
House 
of 

Representative 
could 
strain 

the 
University 
community, 

as the Graduate Employees’ 
Organization is the sister union 
of the LEO, and under the bill 
graduate students could face 
increased tax burdens.

“The tax bill that Trump 

is 
putting 
forward 
would 

do tremendous harm to our 
graduate students in terms of 
taxing their tuition fee waivers 
that are currently nontaxable,” 
Robinson said. “That’s enough 
to drive a substantial number of 
GEO and their counterparts all 
across the state out of graduate 
school. Some of us don’t like 
politics that much, but we can’t 
ignore it. It’s a luxury that we 
don’t have.”

community.”

As presented at the event, 

Black people make up about 12 
percent of the U.S. population, yet 
45 percent of HIV diagnoses are 
within the Black community. HIV 
disproportionately affects Black 
women compared with women 
of other races, as 60 percent of 
HIV-positive women in 2013 were 
Black.

Speakers also discussed the 

stigma behind HIV diagnoses 
throughout the event. Interactive 
activities testing the audience’s 

knowledge about risky and non-
risky behavior dispelled common 
HIV myths. These myths, such 
as the belief that a person can 
contract HIV through shaking 
hands or sharing food, lead to the 
ostracization of people who test 
positive.

The event also touched on 

being able to share “HIV status,” 
providing phrase suggestions on 
how to respond to a partner who 
has disclosed an HIV-positive test, 
or how to disclose a diagnosis with 
a partner or loved ones.

“We want to make this a 

more normal thing for people to 
talk about with their partners,” 
McBride said.

LSA senior Ledea Bond said the 

event held significant educational 
value outside of the classroom.

“I’m really glad I came out 

today; I actually learned some new 
information and I just think it’s 
important to hear this even if it’s 
something you know,” Bond said. 
“It was entertaining, informative 
and (had) really good energy. I 
really enjoyed it.”

LSA junior Lauren Edmonds 

noted she appreciated how the 
event draws attention to a topic 
not often discussed.

“These events bring awareness 

to topics that people don’t want to 
talk about. There are many people 
who don’t want to talk about 
STDs, especially HIV/AIDS, just 
because it has such as stigma,” she

in place to demand accountability 
from the for-profit educational 
management 
organizations 

that run charter schools, or the 
authorizing 
organizations 
that 

oversee them. All kids deserve 
schools that are held to account, 
and that is what our legislation will 
do.”

The 
bills 
would 
require 

education 
management 

organizations to release yearly 
audited 
financial 
statements, 

and charter schools to make 
their contracts with educational 
management 
organizations 

public. The bills would also 
impose additional regulation on 
charter schools, requiring them 
to reach certain performance tiers 
before expanding or moving, to 
prevent the misuse of taxpayer 
money and to prevent conflicts 
of interest between EMOs and 
the individuals creating charter 
schools.

State Rep. Robert Wittenberg, 

D-Huntington Woods, said the 
bills are crucial to making sure 
taxpayer money is being used in a 
beneficial manner.

“Charter 
schools 
expanded 

quickly in Michigan, and that 
gave parents a wide range of 
educational options for their 
children. Now, it’s time for 
reforms to catch up so that we 
can make sure that we’re doing 
this the right way,” Wittenburg 
said. “With these new reforms 
and standards of accountability 
and transparency in place, parents 
and taxpayers will know that 
education dollars in Michigan are 
going where they are meant to go 
— to the education of our children 
and to the promise of our future.”

HB 5266-5270: These bills 

would revamp voter registration 
and expand opportunities to 
register to vote. If passed, they 
would require landlords to provide 
tenants 
with 
information 
on 

voter registration, automatically 
register people applying for a 
driver’s license or personal ID 

card, and allow first time voters to 
vote using an absentee ballot.

Five Democrats in the House 

proposed the bills, including 
Reps. 
Darrin 
Camilleri, 

D-Brownstown Township; Sherry 
Gay-Dagnogo, D-Detroit; Jeremy 
Moss, 
D-Southfield; 
Kristy 

Pagan, D-Canton; and Robert 
Wittenberg, 
D-Huntington 

Woods.

“Voting 
is 
an 
essential 

right that is at the foundation 
of our democracy and is the 
basis of our responsibility as 
citizens,” 
Camilleri 
said 
in 

a press release. “We believe 
these bills are common-sense 
measures to protect and enhance 
Michiganders’ most basic right.”

Gay-Dagnogo cited the success 

with automatic voter registration 
in 
states 
such 
as 
Oregon, 

adding the state should enable 
more people to participate in 
democracy.

“The state of Oregon has seen 

great success with its automatic 
voter registration program, and we 
should replicate that success here 
in Michigan,” Gay-Dagnogo said. 
“When more people participate 
in our elections, we get a more 
accurate reading on the wants and 
needs of our constituents, and we 
lawmakers can better represent 
them at the Capitol.”

HB 5277: If passed, this bill 

would make driving with a dog on 
the driver’s lap a civil infraction 
with a $100 fine.

Rep. 
Latanya 
Garrett, 

D-Detroit, proposed the bill, 
saying it was a matter of safety. 
Garrett told the Detroit Free 
Press that in addition to being 
dangerous, 
it 
can 
also 
be 

distracting.

“Dogs have reactions. I used to 

be a first responder and when dogs 
hear sirens; they get really excited. 
I’ve seen dogs hopping throughout 
a vehicle while it’s moving,” she 
said. “We wouldn’t drive with 
babies in our laps, so why is it OK 
for dogs?”

According to the pet safety 

advocacy group Bark Buckle UP, “if 
an accident occurs while the car is 
moving at 35 mph, an unrestrained, 
60-pound dog is capable of causing 

an impact of up to 2,700 pounds.”

HB 5314-5316: This package of 

bills would create the “Revenue 
Sharing Trust Fund,” which would 
create a trust fund to help rebuild 
the money that revenue sharing 
communities have lost.

The bill, proposed by Rep. Rob 

VerHeulen, 
R-Walker, 
would 

be funded through Michigan’s 
sales tax and would give a level of 
security to local communities in 
the case of an economic downturn.

“There have been compounding 

factors that have all led us to where 
we are at right now in areas across 
the state,” VerHeulen said in a press 
release. “Our communities face a 
funding crisis. They cannot make 
reliable payments into retirement 
systems 
for 
their 
employees, 

including police and fire, and 
money is often being diverted 
away from vital public services in 
an effort to keep up with funding 
those retirement benefit plans or 
other budget necessities.”

SB 684-685: These bills would 

amend “the Revised School Code” 
to give students more opportunities 
to explore career options and 
identify careers specific to each 
student’s interests and talents.

The bills, proposed by state Sens. 

Peter Macgregor, R-Rockford, and 
Ken Horn, R-Frankenmuth, were 
written following the Michigan 
Career 
Pathways 
Alliance 

recommendations 
that 
were 

announced last summer.

“Senate Bills 684 and 685 are 

the culmination of years of work 
and I’m proud to be a part of yet 
another step in getting students the 
resources they need to make sound 
career choices,” Horn said in a press 
release. “We want to give students 
the chance to explore every 
opportunity available to them. 
Talent portfolios will be something 
that parents and counselors can 
point to as young people begin to 
look at their futures.”

The bills would also provide 

students information on projected 
job growth and wages, as well 
as putting together a portfolio 
of each student’s “certifications 
or 
accomplishments 
that 

demonstrate talents or marketable 
skills.”

national debate regarding racism 
and police brutality, but also 
underscore the incidents endured 
on campus this year. Much of the 
panel alluded to the protests of 
Rackham student Dana Greene 
Jr., who in September knelt in 
the Diag for 21 hours. The protest 

was a response to the defacing of 
Black students’ name tags in West 
Quad Residence Hall earlier in 
the semester, and the alleged lack 
of action taken by administration 
thereafter.

Music, 
Theatre 
& 
Dance 

sophomore Maya Alwan said she 
attended the panel to learn more 
about the background of “Blood at 
the Root” and how its deep message 
can reach audiences. A musical 
theatre major, Alwan appreciated 

the play’s ability to encourage 
others to start a dialogue about 
race and no longer marginalize the 
issues surrounding it.

“Something that’s been coming 

up for me in the past couple of years 
is engaging people in conversations 
about race and not letting it just 
slide under the radar as usual,” 
Alwan said. “Conversations like 
this (where) people are invited 
to talk about (race) is really 
important.

“From working to ensure 

every child has the opportunity 
to receive a quality education 
to 
ensuring 
workers 
can 

complete on a level playing 
field, Michigan is undoubtedly 
better and stronger because 
of Rep. Levin’s decades of 
service,” said U.S. Rep. Debbie 
Dingell, D-Dearborn in a press 
release. “He epitomizes what it 
means to be a public servant, 
and I am grateful to have had 
the opportunity to serve the 
alongside him.”

U.S. 
Rep. 
Dan 
Kildee, 

D-Flint, 
reiterated 
this 

message, and said Levin is a 
successful public servant and a 
dear friend and colleague.

“For decades, Sandy has 

fought for fair trade deals, 
affordable health care, and the 
rights of workers everywhere,” 
Kildee said in a statement. “His 
contributions will be evident 
for a long time, not just in the 
U.S., but around the globe.”

Though 
Levin 
will 
be 

missed by his colleagues in 
the 
House, 
many 
students 

expressed excitement about 
the experience he will bring 
to the University. LSA junior 
Paul Rock, who has worked for 
the congressman, wrote in a 
message Levin’s character will 
be valuable on campus.

“For decades, Sandy Levin 

has fought for progress with 
signature 
kindness 
and 

conscience,” he wrote. “His 
character will be sorely missed 
in Washington, but he’ll also 
be a valuable asset to the Ford 

school. I look forward to seeing 
him on campus.”

Similarly, 
Public 
Policy 

junior Lauren Schandevel, a 
member of Levin’s district, 
wrote in a message that she 
welcomes this change.

“As someone who has been 

represented by Sandy my whole 
life, it’s strange to see him 
finally step down,” she wrote. 
“As a Ford student, however, 
I’m thrilled to have him here!”

Levin said in the current 

political climate, connecting 
with the student population 
will be crucial to instilling 
more trust in government.

“And I want to spend a lot 

of time talking to the next, 
next generation and trying to 
both instill a strong interest 
on their part in public service 
and I hope to participate in the 
effort to create more public

wanted to tell her in person,” 
she said. “When I got to her 
she started screaming and 
I started sobbing and we 
hugged. I then called my dad, 
who was waiting by the phone; 
we FaceTimed. In Arabic he 
kept saying, ‘God protects 
me’ and ‘Thank God,’ and he 
was crying so I started crying 
too. It was so overwhelming 
because everything I work 
for is first off for my family 
and then for my community 
and I just kept thinking about 
the doors that all opened in 
just one minute. It was like 10 
minutes before I was planning 
what I would do when I didn’t 
win in terms of my future, then 
all of the sudden my future was 
secured.”

Jawad said she wants to 

study 
refugee 
and 
forced 

migration studies, as well as 

international health, during 
her time at Oxford. She also 
plans 
to 
explore 
Oxford’s 

social policy program.

Dyson emphasized Jawad’s 

unique talents and work ethic, 
and said she will come to 
encounter a larger network of 
similarly skilled leaders during 
her time abroad.

“Nadine 
is 
one 
of 
the

this recognition. One of the 
qualities that sets her apart 
is her natural ability to make 
effective use of mentorship 
and to mentor others in turn. 
The Rhodes Scholarship will 
introduce her to an even wider 
network of fellow leaders.”

According 
to 
Dyson, 
the 

Rhodes 
Scholarship 
receives 

about 1,000 nominations from 
universities across the country. 
After an initial cut is made, 
the remaining nominees go to 
regional selection committees 

for 
final 
interviews. 
Jawad 

described the extent of the 
application 
process, 
and 

remarked how thankful she is to 
have been chosen from a field of 
such talented scholars.

“The 
application 
process 

involves a 1,000-word personal 
statement, eight letters of rec 
and a university endorsement,” 
she said. “Finalists are then 
selected by the Rhodes Trust, 
14 finalists in my district. At the 
final round you have a two-hour 
cocktail reception where you 
talk with judges and then the 
next day a 25-minute individual 
interview. Then that’s it. They 
deliberate and pick. Any of the 
people there could’ve won, and 
they were all incredible people. 
I’m 
overwhelmingly 
grateful 

they chose me.”

Last year, Jawad was also 

named

27th 
University 

student to win the Truman 
Scholarship, a highly competitive 
scholarship for juniors who 
have demonstrated exceptional 
public service and leadership.

From Page 2A


T

he internet ruined my 
life. 

OK, maybe that was a 

bit of an overstatement. I’ll issue 
an amendment: The internet has 
changed my life for better and 
for worse.

Let’s start with the bad: 

the countless hours spent on 
that vapid website known as 
Facebook, the constant perusal 
of online articles to fulfill my 
insatiable appetite for political 
news and the way I begin and end 
each day by gluing my eyeballs 
to my cracked iPhone screen as 
I lie in bed scrolling through my 
Twitter and Instagram feeds. 
Totally healthy, right?

But in all honesty, the internet 

has also been beneficial for me. 
I would never be able to learn 
about obscure celebrities without 
the help of Wikipedia. Google 
Drive has made writing papers 
(and for that matter, writing 
The Michigan Daily columns) 
much easier. However, I worry 
that the internet’s positive effect 
on my upbringing will become 
upended by recent reports that 
the 
Federal 
Communications 

Commission 
will 
roll 
back 

Obama-era regulations on net 
neutrality, which may portend 
dire consequences on how we live 
and breathe the internet.

Net neutrality is somewhat 

of a nebulous concept, so let me 
lay it all out. Net neutrality is 
founded on the belief that the 
internet is best served when 
consumers 
are 
empowered 

in 
the 
telecommunications 

marketplace. Under this premise, 
logic follows that the internet 
must remain an open forum and 
treat all content equally.

If net neutrality goes away, 

internet service providers have 
the incentive to inaugurate a 
hierarchical 
system 
for 
web 

traffic — an idea completely 
unprecedented in this country. 
Those against net neutrality 
argue these rules stifle a free 
market 
and 
are 
a 
federal 

regulatory overreach.

While 
ISPs 
previously 

declared they would abide by 
the principles of net neutrality 
irrespective 
of 
governmental 

policy shifts, Comcast appears 
to have backed away from this 
promise. The company hinted it 
won’t offer “anti-competitive paid 
prioritization,” but this statement 
raises more questions than it 

answers. Comcast asserts it “will 
not block, throttle, or discriminate 
against lawful content,” despite 
opening avenues for some types of 
paid prioritization. Let’s break 
this down.

Blocking certain content is the 

most controversial, but ISPs have 
done so in the past. As Tim Wu 
notes, “There is a long history of 
anticompetitive throttling and 
blocking — often concealed — 
that the F.C.C. has had to stop 
to preserve the health of the 
internet economy.” Even as crazy 
as this idea sounds, this approach 
is still plausible.

Throttling, as the practice is 

dubbed, grants ISPs the ability 
to discriminate against some 
forms of web traffic, meaning 
they have the power to limit 
consumer bandwidth for certain 
sites. Throttling is completely 
arbitrary. While Comcast says 
throttling is not up for adoption, 
other ISPs may throttle sites in 
order to get websites to pay more 
for faster loading speeds.

ISPs, in this situation, would 

target web content providers such 
as Amazon and Netflix. The costs 
of this pressure may ultimately fall 
on those who pay for these services. 
Netflix, for example, accounted 
for 35.2 percent of web traffic in 
March of last year. Because media 
like video and music require so 
much data, sites like Amazon and 
Netflix would likely be the first 
to see changes — thus affecting 
consumers who already pay higher 
prices for slower internet access 
compared to the rest of the world.

How else would consumers pay 

higher prices? One country that 
has already done away with net 
neutrality is Portugal. Portuguese 
ISPs offer a tiered internet 
system requiring consumers to 
buy separate packages for social 
media, music, video, messaging 
and video calls. In turn, content 
providers are impelled to cut deals 
with ISPs for better bandwidth.

This situation is troubling 

for the following reason: ISPs 
and 
content 
providers 
often 

fall under the same corporate 
umbrella. If a company can be 
an ISP and content provider that 
also chooses to make rules to hurt 
other content providers, we have 
a real antitrust problem.

Take, for example, HBO GO. 

As the merger between AT&T 
and Time Warner looms, the 
former, a telecommunications 

provider, and the latter, a content 
provider, HBO would fall under 
the aegis of AT&T. Since AT&T 
provides internet access through 
its U-verse service, AT&T could 
essentially put HBO GO on the 
fast lane while competitors, 
such as Netflix, would load 
much more slowly.

Telecommunications 

companies are banking on the 
idea that the FCC will operate in 
their favor. The new regulatory 
climate comes at a concerning 
time; mergers and acquisitions 
are the new normal in the 
information economy.

At 
our 
own 
institution, 

University of Michigan faculty 
are weighing the pros and cons 
of the net neutrality argument. 
Personally, as a communication 
studies major, I worry about these 
drastic shifts taking place. Class 
projects require me to spend 
extensive amounts of time on 
YouTube and social media. If net 
neutrality goes awash, students 
already having to pay thousands 
of dollars for tuition would not be 
able to reap the same educational 
benefits as they would under a 
free internet.

The business ethos of ISPs is 

reminiscent of one of today’s most 
silver-tongued rappers, Cardi B: 
“Don’t you come around my way, 
you can’t hang around my block / 
And I just checked my accounts, 
turns out, I’m rich, I’m rich, I’m 
rich / I put my hand above my hip, 
I bet you dip, he dip, she dip,” she 
exclaims in the summer hit “Bodak 
Yellow.” Just as Cardi wishes to 
command the masses infatuated 
with her ostentatious persona, 
telecommunication firms similarly 
attempt to keep their customers 
under the false pretense that their 
business acumen will be of benefit 
to all. Not so accurate.

As the former FCC chief and 

proponent of net neutrality, Tom 
Wheeler wrote, “A fair and open 
internet is the backbone of the 
digital economy.” This could not 
ring truer for college students 
hoping to get a career in the new 
information economy or even 
just trying to live a normal life. 
We have become so dependent on 
computers and cell phones that a 
reverse in net neutrality would 
alter the way we use internet as 
we know it.

E

arlier this month, Syria 
announced its intention 
to sign the Paris climate 

accord, leaving the United States 
as the sole country in the world to 
jettison the historic deal. Though 
the U.S. is currently a signatory to 
the agreement, President Donald 
Trump has been resolute in his 
decision to withdraw from the 
deal, which would be implemented 
by 2020 at the earliest. The 
willingness of war-torn Syria 
to join the agreement elicited 
laments from climate activists 
over the U.S.’s lack of commitment 
to combating climate change. 
Furthermore, 
the 
development 

contributes to an alarming trend 
of the U.S. ceding its role as the 
world’s leader. 

Since the end of World War II, 

the U.S. has assumed a mantle 
of global leadership, both in 
promoting democracy and solving 
international issues. Its reputation 
as the world’s predominant leader 
has endured for decades, yet is 
faltering just 11 months into Donald 
Trump’s presidency.

Since Trump took office, global 

perceptions of the U.S. have 
dimmed. A Pew Research survey 
found 
the 
U.S.’s 
favorability 

ratings fell sharply from 64 to 
49 percent, with only 22 percent 
confident in Trump’s ability to 
positively influence world affairs. 
Trump’s ratings are marginally 
worse than Chinese President Xi 
Jinping and Russian President 
Vladimir 
Putin. 
Interestingly, 

a healthier 58 percent of those 
polled had a favorable view of 
Americans, indicating that much 
of the drop in U.S. favorability is 
due to falling confidence in U.S. 
policies as opposed to animosity 
toward Americans in general.

These 
numbers 
inherently 

aren’t all that meaningful, and 
it would be highly misguided to 
judge U.S. policy based off foreign 
approval — nor should President 
Trump’s performance be evaluated 
based on his international approval 
ratings. Still, the U.S.’s slide in 
global perceptions can be traced to 
several of Trump’s policy positions, 

namely climate and trade. Trump’s 
positions on these two issues are 
eroding the U.S.’s position as the 
world’s foremost leader.

With 
regard 
to 
climate, 

Trump’s withdrawal from the 
Paris climate agreement sends 
a message to the world that 
the U.S. cannot be relied on to 
limit and mitigate the effects 
of global warming. There is 
consensus among the scientific 
community that humanity is 
quickly approaching the point 
of no return when it comes to 
combating 
global 
warming. 

Without decisive action, the 
world will be unable to avoid 
the 
potentially 
catastrophic 

consequences 
of 
climate 

change, including sea level 
rise, ocean acidification and 
extreme weather.

The 
Paris 
accord 

established a framework for 
the 
comprehensive 
global 

collaboration required to limit 
warming. 
The 
agreement’s 

terms 
included 
achieving 

net-zero 
greenhouse 
gas 

emissions by about 2050 and 
the investment of $100 billion 
into 
helping 
develop 
world 

transition to renewable energy 
sources. The deal also set an 
ambitious 
goal 
of 
limiting 

warming to a maximum of 3.6 
degrees Fahrenheit. The U.S.’s 
withdrawal seriously weakens 
the odds of the agreement 
reaching its ambitious goals.

By pulling out of the deal, the 

U.S. is exacerbating the problem 
rather than contributing to the 
mitigation of climate change. 
Furthermore, given that the U.S. is 
the world’s second largest emitter 
of greenhouse gases, its refusal 
to contribute to global warming’s 
mitigation 
comes 
across 
as 

irresponsible and improper.

World leaders sharply criticized 

Trump’s decision to withdraw from 
the agreement, and it is apparent 
that the U.S.’s unwillingness to lead 
the world on the issue of climate 
change is adversely affecting its 
reputation 
abroad. 
Meanwhile, 

China appears more than content 

to assume the U.S.’s vacated 
leadership capacity on climate, 
with Chinese officials viewing the 
world forum on climate policy as 
an ideal setting through which to 
expand their global influence.

The Trump administration’s 

isolationist approach to trade 
is also diluting the country’s 
status as a global leader. Trump 
campaigned on a fiercely anti-free 
trade platform, and upon taking 
office, Trump promptly withdrew 
from the Trans Pacific Partnership 
negotiations 
and 
began 
the 

process of renegotiating the North 
American Free Trade Agreement.

The U.S.’s opposition to free 

trade under Trump stands in 
contrast to most of the world. 
With the exception of Brexit, 
most European governments are 
currently trying to protect and 
strengthen the European Union, 
while 
developing 
countries 

across the world see free trade 
as the path toward economic 
prosperity. 
Most 
economists 

agree that free trade agreements 
are beneficial to the U.S. economy 
(or at least that the gains exceed 
the losses), but protectionist 
trade policy also threatens the 
its economic clout abroad. If 
the U.S. follows through with 
Trump’s anti-trade policy and 
isolates itself from the global 
economy, its economic influence 
and leadership will be weakened.

The U.S. clearly still values 

its ability to project power. Pew 
Research polls have found that 
while a plurality of Americans 
want the U.S. to be less involved 
in international affairs, a majority 
disagree with the notion that 
the U.S. should “mind its own 
business internationally.” Trump, 
like his predecessors before him, 
enjoys the ability to guide world 
affairs and relies extensively on 
the U.S.’s far-reaching military 
deployments 
to 
execute 

American foreign policy.

The need for net neutrality

A journey through white girlhood

FRANNIE MILLER | FRANNIE CAN BE REACHED AT FRMILLER@UMICH.EDU

T

aylor Swift’s latest album, 
“Reputation,” 
came 

out last month and was 

immediately met with passionate 
reactions. In recent years, Swift 
has become one of the most 
polarizing figures in American 
pop culture, on par with our 
current president in terms of 
having a notoriety that can start 
fights at family gatherings. (If 
you’re going to tell Swift that I 
compared her to Donald Trump, 
please tell the American Civil 
Liberties Union first.) Love her 
or hate her, she has enough star 
power to infiltrate the lives 
of even the most culturally 
isolated hermit. 

As a white woman who grew 

up in the rural Midwest, the 
musical stylings of Swift had 
been ever-present in my girlhood 
and my journey to womanhood. 
Her thoughts have reflected the 
greater opinions of many white 
women who view themselves as 
victims of a patriarchal culture, 
who are all about female solidarity, 
but refuse to acknowledge any 
type of oppression outside of 
what they face. This type of white 
feminism cannot imagine that 
the experience of women is not 
always universal or that feminism 
must be intersectional.

So in honor of her latest 

creation, I took a journey through 
Swift’s discography and, thus, 
a journey through my white 
womanhood. Let’s begin.

The musical stylings of Swift 

from the 2000s era seeped in 
preteen 
romance 
and 
casual 

internalized misogyny. In spite of 
the fact that I was certainly too 
young to have a boyfriend and 
that there was absolutely no type 
of romance going on in my life, I 
related to Swift. I identified with 
her songs of heartbreak, especially 
when she blamed another girl for 
said heartbreak.

I identified with the spirit of 

“I’m not like other girls!” often 
exemplified in Swift’s music, and 
my friends and I would often vilify 
the girls we deemed “popular” 
at our school. (I’m looking at 
you, Megan from the popular 
crowd, who wears Abercrombie 
and Fitch and straightens her 
hair every day. I leave my hair 

frizzy and read fantasy novels in 
the library alone during lunch 
because I’m better than you!)

My 
personal 
brand 
of 

womanhood was so fragile at 
this time that the only way I 
could respect another girl was if 
she were exactly like me — i.e., 
nerdy, socially awkward and 
religiously 
conservative. 
I’m 

not proud of it, and neither was 
T-Swift, as we both felt the need 
to rebrand ourselves.

We, 
Taylor 
Swift 
and 
I, 

matured a bit. We embraced 
our female friends and became 
feminists. Swift released the 
immensely popular “Red” in 
2012, and then “1989” in 2014, 
and I got a slightly more flattering 
haircut, learned how to get rid 
of my upper-lip hair and started 
my freshman year of college 
right after “Shake it Off” was 
released. Though I didn’t notice it 
at the time, Swift and my brand of 
feminism lacked inclusivity.

My brand of feminism and 

womanhood 
morphed 
from 

judging other women for being 
sexually liberated and “allowing 
themselves to be used by men” 
to judging other women for not 
being sexually liberated and 
“allowing themselves to be used 
by men.” There was no room in 
this dialogue for LBGTQ voices, 
for Muslim voices, for the voices 
of people of color.

Then 2016 happened, Kylie 

Jenner’s year of realizing things™. 
Swift famously overplayed her 
hand at white woman victimhood 
by throwing Kanye West under 
the bus in order to promote her 
own specific and exclusive brand 
of white feminism. And after it 
became known that 53 percent 
of white women had voted for 
Donald 
Trump, 
arguably 
all 

American white feminists also 
overplayed their hand.

It was a time of reckoning for 

cis white women who, up until 
this point, had probably always 
seen themselves as victims of a 
patriarchal culture of oppression. 
Communities of color had always 
criticized the particular brand of 
mainstream feminism for putting 
their problems on the back burner 
in order to focus on the issues 
plaguing the more privileged or 

for oppressing people of color in 
order to achieve their own goals 
(Alice Paul, Susan B. Anthony and 
other prominent feminists). But 
when Kim Kardashian published 
the video on Snapchat, these 
criticisms had, in my view, finally 
reached a realm where white 
women could easily see them and 
be affected by them.

I have always believed adults 

are people who can own up 
to 
their 
mistakes, 
apologize 

and then change their actions. 
For white women, this means 
acknowledging our part — and 
white feminism’s part — in the 
creation of a white supremacist 
system, refusing to talk over 
voices of color and supporting 
those who don’t have the type of 
privilege we do. When we were 
younger, 
we 
absolutely 
held 

problematic 
opinions 
toward 

feminism and race. And this, in 
essence, is part of growing up — 
realizing the error of your ways 
and seeking to correct that error 
in adulthood.

So skip to 2017, when I am 

currently being disappointed by 
“Reputation.” Instead of owning 
up to her actions, Swift refuses 
to apologize or take any type 
of responsibility for her public 
downfall. Instead of allowing 
her brand of feminism to grow 
and become more inclusive, she’s 
been slammed by the ACLU for 
threatening to sue a blogger who 
suggested she was respected in 
neo-Nazi circles. If Swift is to 
be the collective voice of white 
women, she is not giving us a very 
good reputation.

Swift’s 
brand 
of 
white 

femininity and white feminine 
victimhood has, most likely, 
followed 
us 
through 
our 

childhood, but it’s time for us 
to branch off. It’s 2017, Donald 
Trump is our president, a known 
white nationalist wants to speak 
on our campus and other racist 
incidents just continue to keep 
happening. It’s time we, cis white 
women, acknowledge the role we 
play in the creation of this racist 
system, because only then can we 
begin to deconstruct it.

COURTESY OF CERVATINE FESTIVAL

Reinventing Shakespeare 
through a clash of culture

Ever 
since 
I 
moved 
to 

Michigan from Mexico, the 
public-school system in the 
United States has made sure 
I am well versed in all things 
American. After taking AP 
United 
States 
History, 
I 

could recite every American 
president and the years of all 
the 
major 
American 
wars. 

In American literature, we 
read 
“The 
Adventures 
of 

Huckleberry Finn,” “Of Mice 
and Men” and “The Crucible.” 
Shakespeare was one of the 
only 
non-American 
authors 

that were emphasized by our 
curriculum. We read “Romeo 
and Juliet,” “Hamlet,” “Julius 
Caesar,” “The Tempest” and 
“Macbeth.” 
Deciphering 

Shakespeare’s 
plays 
was 

regarded by my teachers as 
one of the most important 
parts of our schooling. I was 
introduced to the notion that 

having read these plays made 
someone more sophisticated 
and smart. Shakespeare had 
everything worthy of teaching. 
A world renowned English 
author who was regarded as a 
genius of words.

However, 
none 
of 
these 

words were my words. They 
did not resonate with me and 
where I thought I belonged. I 
was a quiet Spanish speaking 
girl who yearned to read “Don 
Quixote,” 
and 
learn 
about 

El Pipila and La Malinche. 
Although I loved reading these 
plays and being introduced 
to 
many 
of 
Shakespeare’s 

immortal characters, they did 
not make me feel like Sancho 
Panza or Sor Juana Ines de 
la Cruz ever did. I felt in 
some ways alienated because 
the characters and authors 
I 
admired 
and 
connected 

with the most were never 
mentioned by my teachers. We 
had entire units dedicated to 
American and British authors 
like Tennessee Williams and 

Mary Shelley, but there was 
no mention of Octavio Paz or 
Sandra Cisneros.

This lack of representation 

and 
the 
championing 
of 

Shakespeare as the desired 
author 
changed 
my 
views 

regarding 
worthy 
and 

unworthy literature. Which is 
why I was taken aback when 
I witnessed a representation 
of Shakespeare that resonated 
with my identity.

One 
morning 
in 
early 

September, I received a call 
from my grandmother. When I 
answered, she started intensely 
speaking into the phone in a 
way only grandmothers can, 
as if they are unsure if their 
voices are getting through 
to the other side. The call 
mainly consisted of her giving 
me a detailed rundown of the 
itinerary for our next trip. 
During fall break, we were 
going to Guanajuato, Mexico 
for a classical arts festival.

The Cervantine Festival is 

an annual event in Guanajuato,

What’s at stake for 

social media if we lose 

net neutrality

As 2017 draws to a long 

dreaded close, we can look 
back on all the wonderful 
— 
and 
occasionally 
awful 

— things that happened on 
social media this year. From 
the death of Vine to the bump 
to 280 characters on Twitter, 
online celebrity beefs to online 
celebrity 
apologies, 
Fiona 

the Hippo to covfefe, social 
media in 2017 has elicited both 
foreboding and optimism for 
the future of our online world.

At 
times, 
social 
media 

may generate toxic political 
discourse, an anxiety-inducing 
need to bring about social 
change and harrowing videos 
that depict acts of racially 
motivated violence. But social 
media has its benefits too, 
given how much advantage we 
have as online users to shape 
and influence other people 
with our words and our ideas. 
It acts as a stepping stone for 
holding corrupt men in power 
accountable for their actions, 
a paradigm for enlightening 
people on under-the radar 
social issues and a virtual 
cesspool for exchanging jokes, 
memes and other pop cultural 
obsessions.

Even with its drawbacks, 

social media gives us the 
power to decide what we want 
to subscribe to and who we 
want to share our worlds with.

However, 
the 
future 

of social media, or rather 
its 
accessibility, 
remains 

uncertain for 2018. On Nov. 
21st, 
the 
Trump-appointed 

FCC Chairman Ajit Pai set in 
motion a plan to repeal net 
neutrality, a set of rules and 
regulations that, if retracted, 
could endanger our ability to 
use the Internet freely. Pai and 
the five other chairmen of the 
FCC will decide on whether or 
not to keep net neutrality on 
Dec. 14. They would only need 
three votes in order to pass it.

For 
those 
still 
confused 

about what net neutrality is, 
it essentially grants a “free 
and open” Internet for online 
consumers. It preserves our 
right to communicate freely 
online and levels the playing 
field so that no single Internet 
provider has more control over 

the Internet than another.

If net neutrality were to be 

repealed, broadband providers 
like 
AT&T, 
Verizon 
and 

Comcast would be given the 
power to regulate the speed 
and bandwidth of streaming 
services 
like 
Netflix 
and 

video streaming websites like 
YouTube. 
They 
could 
also 

block 
websites 
they 
deem 

inappropriate and bundle social 
media platforms like Facebook, 
Snapchat and Instagram for a 
packaged price, most likely up 
to $5 a month. So if, let’s say, 
someone wanted to use just 
Twitter, they might also have 
to pay money for FourSquare. 
Or if someone wanted to watch 
Netflix and Hulu but Hulu 

wasn’t included in a package, 
then they are more likely to use 
whichever streaming service 
is cheaper depending on their 
broadband provider.

This issue of repealing net 

neutrality, of course, is not 
new. It was brought up and 
then quickly resolved in 2015 
when the FCC established 
protections 
to 
prevent 

broadband 
providers 
from 

commodifying and packaging 
the Internet for their benefit. 
During his presidency, Barack 
Obama was a major proponent 
in advocating for keeping net 
neutrality for the American 
people. But now with Trump in 
office, the fate of net neutrality 
has the actual potential to be 
taken away.

The lack of free access 

to the Internet would not 
only 
greatly 
affect 
people 

across the country, but also 
communities of color and other 

marginalized 
communities 

in 
particular. 
Because 
the 

Internet 
has 
become 
such 

an significant platform for 
voicing 
social 
issues 
and 

general self-expression from 
these communities, the lack 
of net neutrality would limit 
those freedoms.

According 
to 
Vice 

commentator 
Mack 

Lamoureux, the U.S. will be 
seen as a major geopolitical 
power if it were to pass the 
net neutrality repeal, causing 
other countries like Canada 
to potentially follow our lead. 
Portugal is one such country 
that shows what life could look 
like for Americans without net 
neutrality, as it offers users 
commodified 
packages 
of 

different social media outlets, 
music and video streaming 
services and even email. 

Luckily, people have already 

taken notice of how the FCC’s 
decision 
may 
drastically 

impact social media. Social 
media itself has become the 
main 
purveyor 
in 
taking 

action against repealing net 
neutrality. 
Everyone 
from 

California 
senator 
Kamala 

Harris to actress, singer and 
Twitter icon Cher has called 
upon social media users to 
recognize the stakes in losing a 
free Internet. Battle for the Net 
is a newly created project that 
encourages Americans to write 
letters to Congress and attend 
protests demanding a vote 
against the repeal. “Last Week 
Tonight” host John Oliver has 
not one, not two, but three 
exhaustive, 
comprehensive 

videos on net neutrality and 
the costs of repealing it.

If we want to keep engaging 

in the way we already do 
on the Internet, we must 
work to maintain it as such, 
whether 
through 
online 

outreach, protests or dialogue. 
Otherwise, we must reconcile 
with the fact that that may not 
be a reality in the near future.

The Internet has given us a 

lot to worry about, but it’s also 
given us a platform to express 
ourselves and consume things 
that make us informed and 
happy. We should at least try to 
give back.

SHOW PREVIEW

DAILY SOCIAL MEDIA COLUMN

Mexico that aims to create 
dialogue 
between 
multiple 

artistic disciplines. The festival 
gets its name as an homage to 
Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, 
the author of “Don Quixote de 
la Mancha,” and it attempts to 
encompass the artistry, culture 
and tradition exemplified by 
the novel. Since 1972, when 
international 
artists 
were 

invited 
to 
Guanajuato, 
the 

Cervantine Festival has seen 
historical 
performances 
by 

Martha 
Graham, 
Leonard 

Bernstein, 
Ella 
Fitzgerald, 

Philip Glass, Pina Bausch, Ute 
Lemper, Goran Bregovic and 
the Bolshoi Ballet.

The 
festival 
is 
held 
in 

Guanajuato, a city considered 
one 
of 
Mexico’s 
most 

important historic and cultural 
enclaves. The Cervantine has 
transformed it into a main 
destination for famous artists, 
classical 
art 
amateurs 
and 

tourists from all over the world. 
One of those tourists was me: A 
Mexican girl from a northern 
state who currently lives and 
studies in Michigan.

I thought that this festival 

was going to introduce me to 
the kind of art and literature I 
had been waiting for. I saw it 
as a bridge between my preteen 
self, who only read in Spanish, 
and my college self, who has 
mostly British and American 
novels onher bookshelf. I never 

imagined I would see any 
interpretations of plays or 
novels written by any of the 

authors or playwrights I had 
learned about in high school. I 
was going there to learn about 
the part of my identity that was 
displaced during my years of 

schooling in the United States.

On 
our 
third 
night 
in 

Guanajuato, my grandmother 
and I bought tickets to a play 
by a small theatre group from 
Mexico City. The reviews were 
incredible, and we had run 
into a woman at the plaza who 
recommended it enormously. 
We were both excited to change 
it up from classical music 
and dance performances to 
something more historical and 
mysterious. Neither of us knew 
what to expect when we got our 
tickets for “Mendoza” by Los 
Colochos Theatre. The theatre 
was small, and there was no 
stage –– the metal chairs 
were arranged around a small 
rectangular platform in the 
middle of the venue.

It only took me a couple of 

minutes, a phone light and 
a 
program 
to 
realize 
that 

“Mendoza” 
was 
essentially 

a modern interpretation of 
Shakespeare’s “Macbeth,” but 
adapted cross culturally to fit 
into the hierarchy and reality 
of the Mexican Revolution. 
The revolutionary period is 
known as a time of tumultuous 
and corrupt governance. The 
climb to power was plagued 
by deception and betrayal, as 
many of the candidates were 
killed by opposing forces before 
getting into power, and some 
assassinated by the opposition 
even 
after 
being 
rightfully 

elected into office.

This feeling of anarchy, and 

the essence of Macbeth were 
perfectly 
captured 
by 
Los 

Colochos. Mendoza, the main 
character of the play, gets a 
message from a sorceress that 
he will be great and ascend 

to his rightful place as the 
governor of the state, and then 
president of Mexico. He then 
kills the current governor as 
directed by his wife, and then 
collapses of guilt and paranoia 
after realizing what he has 
done. This interpretation of 
“Macbeth” took the audience 
back to 1911 as a reminder of 
the widespread corruption in 
the government during the 
times of the Revolution. This 
interpretation also crossed my 
identity bridge.

I 
never 
thought 
that 

Shakespeare could teach me 
about the Mexican Revolution. 
It had never occurred to me 
the original Scottish version 
could be changed to fit me 
and my culture. “Mendoza” 
was a blend, a play that did 
not belong on either side of 
the cultural line. Just like me, 
“Mendoza” was a hybrid of two 
narratives, and it was the first 
time that I resonated with one 
of Shakespeare’s plays.

I walked out of the theatre, 

and while walking through 
Guanajuato, I realized that I 
wasn’t fully where I belonged. 
I had gone there hoping to feel 
more like myself and to learn 
more about who I was. I thought 
that I was going to feel at home 
there, 
but 
after 
watching 

Mendoza I realized that I did 
not belong on either side of the 
line. I was the bridge. A part 
of me was at home learning 
about American Literature and 
another part of me still looked 
up to Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz. 
During my trip to Guanajuato, 
I learned that neither of those 
parts could be displaced, all 
thanks to Mendoza.

Miguel makes everything sexy
On ‘War & Leisure’ Miguel 
makes social critique sexy

In his latest release, Miguel adds another dimension to his music

In 2017 America, there seems 

to exist very few moments of 
pure happiness. You could have 
just aced the exam that had a 56 
percent class average, landed 
your dream job, gotten asked 
out by that guy / girl you always 
thought was out of your league 
and be surrounded by a litter 
of golden retriever puppies and 
still be weighed on by a headline 
you read that morning.

LA-based R&B artist Miguel 

is painfully aware of this tainted 
happiness on his new album War 
& Leisure. While the artist’s past 
discography 
relies 
primarily 

on eroticism, Miguel adds a 
new social dimension on his 
latest release, painting sexual 
experiences 
with 
political 

metaphors and evoking the 
stark juxtaposition suggested by 
the album’s title.

Rick 
Ross 
collaboration 

“Criminal” starts off the album 
with a refrain that exemplifies 
this duality: “It’s so good it 
feels 
criminal.” 
Similarly, 

promotional single “Told You 
So” straightforwardly preaches 
“every pleasure you taste has 
its price, babe.” While not 
particularly 
profound, 
both 

lines set a clear precedent for the 
“nothing good comes without 
something bad” message that 
is splattered across the entire 
album.

With this in mind, the album’s 

lyrics take a turn toward social 
commentary, 
implicitly 
and 

explicitly referencing a number 
of 
headline-worthy 
names 

and issues. Among the most 
referenced 
are 
controversial 

figures 
President 
Donald 

Trump and professional football 
player Colin Kaepernick. On 

“Come Through and Chill,” 
collaborator J. Cole finds a way 
to mention both in a single 
flow — “Know you’ve been 
on my mind like Kaepernick 
kneelin’ / Or police killings, or 
Trump sayin’ slick shit” — while 
comparing the preoccupation 
with these current events to the 
sexually entrancing quality of a 
woman.

A number of other social 

references, 
particularly 

references to war, are made 
in erotic contexts. In “Banana 
Clip,” Miguel blatantly refers 
to a boner as a machine gun 
clip and later proclaims “I put 
the D in defender / You know I 

never surrender.” In “Anointed,” 
he sings “your body’s ready 
for war and my body’s built to 
endure.” Alluding to war in 
describing such sexual scenes 
further underlines how anxiety 
prompted by current events 
has come to pollute life’s good 
moments.

The album’s grave aura lets 

up on “Pineapple Skies” — a 
synth, 
autotune 
experience 

with a refrain that somewhat 
convincingly 
proclaims 

“promise everything’s gonna be 
alright” — immediately followed 
by “Sky Walker,” a Travis Scott 
collaboration and the album’s 
lead single. The latter feels out 
of place on the album, shirking 
political drive in favor of what 
seems like a playful competition 
for most clever flow. No matter 
the best line (it has to be either 
Miguel’s “I’m Luke Skywalkin’ 
on these haters’’ or Scott’s 

“In my 23s, havin’ a Jordan 
moment” in my opinion), the 
song feels forced onto the 
album for radioplay purposes 
and strays from the album’s 
otherwise succinct concept.

Album 
closer, 
“Now,” 
is 

unique, given it’s the only song 
on the album that focuses 
directly on social issues rather 
than 
contributing 
social 

commentary masked by sexual 
metaphor. Lyrics “Is that the 
look of freedom, now? / Is that 
the sound of freedom, now?” 
raise the question that we’ve all 
asked ourselves: Can we really 
call today’s America the “free 
world”? Miguel goes further 
to assert “‘Cause it’s plain to 
see a man’s integrity by the 
way he treats those he does 
not need,” perhaps referencing 
President Donald Trump’s less 
than merciful actions toward 
minorities, 
or 
otherwise 

drawing focus on the general 
population 
growing 
selfish 

sentiment.

This track, and therefore the 

album, concludes with “We are 
the look of freedom / We are 
the sound of freedom” — a call 
to action to remedy the pains 
underlying the body of the 
album.

Having proven his masterful 

songwriting 
and 
production 

ability on past releases, Miguel 
continues to flex these talents on 
War & Leisure. Still, he evolves 
from past works by adding a 
new socially conscious layer 
without losing the sexual and 
emotional edge that launched 
his career. Miguel gives us a new 
interpretation of the current 
tumultuous 
social 
climate. 

While this interpretation may 
seem dire, he also reassures us 
that we have the power to love 
and change the world for the 
better.

NETFLIX

A man finding God in a godless place, just like how Rihanna found love
Netflix’s new ‘Godless’ is 
a widely likeable Western

The series is a visually stunning epic with a well-curated cast

The 
tropes 
are 
ingrained 

in all of our minds: the lone 
cowboy riding through a harsh 
yet beautiful land, the town 
saloon, the ever-present threat of 
robbery, the pure, unadulterated 
feeling of adventure and promise. 
Yet Westerns are usually just a 
thing of the past, a neat antiquity 
of a different age. Nonetheless, 
Netflix’s new series “Godless” 
revives the genre for a modern 
TV 
audience, 
combining 

gorgeous production with a 
brutal story.

In the first episode “An 

Incident 
at 
Creede,” 
Frank 

Griffin 
(Jeff 
Daniels, 
“The 

Newsroom”), a notorious and 
terrifying outlaw, searches for a 
former protégé Roy Goode (Jack 
O’Connell, “Money Monster”) 
after the latter betrays the group 
of outlaws that robs mines around 
Colorado and Wyoming. Goode 
arrives in a town called La Belle, 
where he is welcomed (by being 
shot) by Alice Fletcher (Michelle 
Dockery, 
“Downton 
Abbey”), 

who also nurses him back to 
health. Meanwhile, Sheriff Bill 
McNue (Scoot McNairy, “War 
Machine”), a depressed widower, 
investigates the whole affair 
after the small town of Creede is 
savagely brutalized and burned 

to the ground. 

Jeff Daniels, in what is a rather 

unusual role for him, provides 
a 
stunning 
performance 
as 

Griffin. In Griffin’s first few 
scenes, his arm is amputated 
due to a gunshot wound, but the 
procedure and the aftermath 
do not seem to faze him at all, 
in opposition to his consuming 
desire for revenge. He notes to 
his surgeon, “I’ve seen my death, 
this ain’t it.” He interrupts a 
church service in a memorable 
scene, 
warning 
terrified 

churchgoers that they will all 
suffer like their lord if they 
help Roy Goode. His presence 
throughout feels larger than 
life, more force of nature than 
petty criminal, a performance 

reminiscent of Javier Bardem’s 
Anton Chigurh in “No Country 
for Old Men.”

Despite the main conflict being 

between Goode and Griffin, the 
true protagonists of the show 
are the women. Fletcher, and 
McNue’s 
sister 
Mary 
Agnes 

(Merritt Wever, “The Walking 
Dead”) are complex, strong and 
independent in their own distinct 

ways and don’t play into clichés 
of such personalities. Fletcher is 
calm and practical, while Agnes 
is 
confident 
and 
completely 

self-assured as a leader. In 
addition, the town of La Belle is 
completely populated by women. 
Later episodes introduce viewers 
to the women and explore the 
dynamics between them. The 
new characters are surprisingly 
all fleshed out and complex, and 
the show reveals an emotional 
and compelling backstory that 
explains just how this group of 
women came to govern La Belle.

Although 
long, 
drawn-out 

shots do slow down the pace 
at times to a languid crawl, the 
cinematography 
and 
visual 

production conveys a sense of 
grandeur, mystery and danger in 
the landscape. The land is sparse 
and unforgiving, and it gives the 
sense that man is truly alone, no 
matter how many prayers are 
recited. The production feels 
movie-like as opposed to what 
we expect from TV budgets, 
despite some rather amateurish 
CGI scattered throughout the 
first episode.

Right off the bat, “Godless” 

feels like an epic. With a 
large cast of well-developed, 
interesting 
characters 
and 

cinematic production, it is sure 
to entertain anyone, regardless 
of their previous affinity for the 
genre.

Denzel stuns and soars
‘Roman J. Israel Esq.’ has 
Denzel, but not much else

Dan Gilroy’s new film fails to deliver anything but the actor

Writer-director Dan Gilroy 

began 
making 
waves 
in 

Hollywood following his 2014 
directorial debut “Nightcrawler,” 
a dark, thought-provoking film 
that was met with significant 
critical and popular acclaim. 

Naturally, 
anticipation 
built 

up surrounding the release of 
Gilroy’s second project, “Roman 
J. Israel, Esq.,” a film about an 
awkward, brash and idealistic 
civil rights defense attorney 
struggling to make a difference in 
a society dominated by corporate 
interests.

Denzel 
Washington 

(“Fences”) plays the eponymous 

Roman J. Israel in a performance 
that serves as a central strength 
of the film. Roman is, above all 
else, out of place. The struggle 
most central to the character is 
his inability to fit into a certain 
time, place or group of people. 
Washington 
portrays 
this 

inability wonderfully, capturing 
the grandiose oddities of Roman’s 
personality all the way down to 

his microscopic idiosyncrasies.

Set in the modern day, Roman 

arrives at work every day in the 
same baggy suits he’s owned 
since the ’70s. In one particularly 
poignant scene, Roman is invited 
to speak to a group of young 
activists and is lampooned as a 
sexist after asking why men are 
not acting chivalrously when 
they are sitting while women are 
standing in the back. This causes 
one of the women to remind 
him: “This isn’t 40 years ago, 
asshole.” The film communicates 
Roman’s anachronism well with 
a soundtrack that ranges from 
’70s funk to Childish Gambino, 
mixing the old and the new in a 
way that parallels the film’s main 
character.

Unfortunately, 
it’s 
also 

Washington’s 
performance 
as 

the 
awkward, 
idiosyncratic 

attorney that serves as one of 
the film’s greatest hindrances 
by completely outshining every 
other member of the cast. The 
film’s 
supporting 
roles 
are 

practically nonexistent; whatever 
traits the other characters in the 
film possess seem to be present 
only to act as a foil to Roman. As 
a result, the film feels like a one-

man show that, for all the talent 
Washington brings to the table, 
can’t seem to create a world that’s 
interesting and genuine enough to 
hold the attention of audiences.

If this weren’t enough to cause 

audiences to lose interest, the film 
suffers from dreadful pacing that 
will test even patient moviegoers. 

The first 45 minutes of the film 
are more or less insubstantial, 
giving audiences a look at Roman 
going about his day to day life. 
Once audiences have endured a 
patience-testing first act, they’re 
rewarded with a film that is 
otherwise entertaining. However, 
entertaining and substantial are 
not the same thing.

A film like “Roman J. Israel 

Esq.” inherently carries with it a 
goal of some kind of greater social 
commentary; Roman’s struggle 
to help those disenfranchised 
by the criminal justice system 
brings forth difficult questions 
about activism and civil rights 
in a society that treats prisoners 
and criminals like commodities. 
However, the film skirts around 
directing these questions head-on 
and instead chooses to fall back 
on the same few heavy-handed 
talking points about the American 
legal system. By the end of the 
film it’s as if it’s stopped trying 
to answer these questions at all, 
opting instead to wax poetic on 
a tangent of disillusionment and 
atonement that feels decidedly 
irrelevant from the social issues 
that the film sets up to be its 
cornerstone.

In the end, “Roman J. Israel, 

Esq.” is just as conflicted and 
awkward as its main character. 
It’s a film that appears to have had 
all the makings of an extremely 
compelling experience — from 
the talent to the content to the 
direction — but lacked the focus 
to be anything more than a 
forgettable experience.

Last 
Wednesday, 

the 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball team played 
its worst game of the 
season — a lopsided, 
86-71 loss at No. 13 
North Carolina.

But to open the Big 

Ten slate Saturday, 
the 
Wolverines 

looked far different. 

Michigan 

dispatched 
Indiana, 
69-55, 

on 
the 
50th 

anniversary of the 
first 
basketball 

game at Crisler 
Center. 

“We 
don’t 

call it a spring 
board, we call it 
a trampoline,” 
said 
coach 

John 
Beilein. 

“Let’s 
take 

this thing that 
happened 
in 

Chapel 
Hill 

where 
we 

were 
just 

bad 
and 

grow 
from 

it. We really 
bounced 
back 
very 

well today.”

Led by 19 

points from 
freshman 
guard 
Jordan 
Poole, the 

Wolverines (1-0 Big Ten, 7-2 
overall) led the entire way, as 
Michigan built a double-digit 
lead just five minutes in. 

But early into the second half, 

the Hoosiers (0-1, 4-4) clawed 
themselves back within striking 
distance. Forward Josh Newkirk 
knocked down a three to cap 
off a 9-0 Indiana run that cut 
the Wolverines’ lead to just five 
with 15 minutes to play.

But then, as they had done 

throughout the afternoon, the 
Wolverines found a run of their 
own. 

On the corresponding play, 

fifth-year 
senior 
forward 

Duncan Robinson — despite 
a 
rough 
1-for-8 
shooting 

performance prior — lifted and 
hit from the top of the key. Then, 

after another basket and two 
defensive stops, freshman point 
guard Eli Brooks would follow 
suit to cap off an 8-0 run. 

“That was huge,” said junior 

forward Moritz Wagner. “I was 
on the bench and coach was 
like, ‘We need one right now.’ 
(Indiana) messed up the play, 
and Duncan was wide open, and 
that was big. That was the play we 
practiced and had (set up), so it all 
worked out perfectly.”

And from there, the Jordan 

Poole show would commence. 

The former four-star recruit 

showed off the talent he has 
flashed in recent games, finishing 
a 
contested 
reverse 
layup 

before sinking a deep three to 
give Michigan a comfortable 
advantage 
Indiana 
wouldn’t 

jeopardize for the remainder of 
the contest. 

Poole 
led 
the 
Wolverines 

with 
19 
points 
on 
7-for-12 

shooting — career-highs 

for 
him 
despite 

having recently settled into the 
Wolverines’ rotation. 

“That’s what Jordan does,” said 

freshman point guard Eli Brooks. 
“Jordan’s a play-maker. Given the 
opportunities that he’s had, he 
seizes the moment. We all knew 
he could play this well, it was just 
a matter of time.”

Despite the recency of the 

North Carolina defeat, Michigan 
couldn’t have started Saturday’s 
game much stronger, opening 
an 18-4 advantage after eight 
minutes of play.

The 
Wolverines 
sunk 
four 

early 3-pointers off strong ball 
movement and a willingness to 
make the extra pass. Poole — 
the first Wolverine to come off 
the bench — was again fearless 
shooting the basketball and found 
nylon on four of his first seven 
attempts, including a trio of 
triples. 

Indiana’s offense, meanwhile, 

was 
abysmal. 
The 
Hoosiers 

were held without a field goal 
through the first eight minutes 
and committed five turnovers in a 
sloppy start.

“Coming out of the locker room, 

our defense was really focused 
on the scouting report,” Beilein 
said, “(Assistant coach) DeAndre 
Haynes did a great job with that 
scouting report. Our kids lived 
that scoring report.”

But Michigan’s fast shooting 

start would soon slow, as a four-
minute 
scoring 
drought 
and 

12 points from forward Juwan 
Morgan — who led all scorers 
with 24 points — would allow 
Indiana to remain within striking 
distance, trailing 34-21 at the half. 

Eventually, though, Poole had 

his day — leading the Wolverines 
past the Hoosiers in convincing 
fashion.

And for Beilein, who faces 

another quick turnaround with a 
visit to Ohio State on Monday, it 
was reminder of what has been 
the case throughout his tenure 
with the Wolverines.

“I hope (you’ve seen) over 

that last 10 years that Michigan 
bounces back,” Beilein said. 
“We’re going to bounce back 
because you’re not going to win 
every game.”

A monumental leap forward

L

ast Saturday morning, 
the ribbons were finally 
cut. 

After 

three years 
riddled with 
anticipation, 
the Athletics 
South 
Competition 
and 
Performance 
Project 
is finally 
complete. 
The 
280,000-square-foot facility 
— with an estimated cost of 
$168 million funded by outside 
donors — will accommodate the 
track, cross country, lacrosse, 
soccer and rowing teams and 
provide training spaces for 
the gymnastics, tennis and 
wrestling teams.

Surrounded by the athletes 

and coaches of those teams, 
athletic director Warde Manuel 
stood in front of the facility and 
welcomed them into their new 
home.

“Today is a great day for 

me,” Manuel said, “but more 
importantly, for you and your 
coaches to open this building, 
to get a chance to see this 
facility, to walk around (and) 
touch what you’re going to be 
connecting to for many decades 
beyond you.

“Much work was put into 

this, many donors to thank over 
time that you’ll see throughout 
this building. Many of our staff 
worked hard to raise the money 
to build this facility for you. So 
I am excited to open this up for 
you.”

It has been a long time 

coming. The project was first 
announced in September 2014, 
at which time Manuel was in 
Storrs, Conn., as the athletic 
director at the University of 
Connecticut.

Former athletic director 

Dave Brandon initiated the 

process less than two months 
before he ultimately resigned 
in the middle of a 5-7 football 
season, and the Board of 
Regents signed off on the deal.

“We are grateful for the 

support that our Regents and 
University leadership have 
continued to provide as we 
execute our transformational 
facilities plan for Michigan 
Athletics,” Brandon said at the 
time. “This phase of the plan 
will complete several of our 
largest projects that will have 
a major impact on the future of 
Michigan Athletics.”

Suffice to say, much has 

changed for the athletic 
program in the time since.

I was a freshman at the 

University during that 
tumultuous fall, when the 

Michigan community — the 
student body, in particular — 
stated its case for Brandon’s 
resignation with a critical 
petition around 
campus and a 
disapproving 
rally in the 
Diag.

His job 

performance 
had already 
been 
questioned 
by students 
frustrated 
about 
expensive football season ticket 
packages, which were $280 
during that year, compared to 
$150 this season. The uproar 
took on new life after the 
concussion sustained by former 

quarterback Shane Morris and 
aftermath of the injury.

Morris, fairly or not, 

became the symbol of protests 

focused on the 
department’s 
mistreatment of 
student-athletes. 

Looking back 

on that time three 
years later, the 
Athletics South 
Competition and 
Performance 
Project seems to 
be a monumental 
leap forward, 

especially for these teams that 
have been prioritized less than 
Michigan’s big three revenue-
generating sports: football, 
hockey and basketball. Through 
writing for the Daily, that 

disparity became distinctly 
apparent.

When I covered the soccer 

teams at the start of my career, 
I sometimes interviewed the 
coaches in their offices on 
non-game days. That may seem 
normal. The abnormal part 
is that we were sitting in a 
makeshift trailer on the side of 
the parking lot at U-M Soccer 
Stadium. 

When I sat in weekly story 

meetings waiting to decide 
which events to cover, I noticed 
that the Wolverines didn’t 
host the track and field events. 
That’s because the old facilities 
didn’t have the space, for the 
media or a crowd. The new 
indoor and outdoor facilities 
will have permanent seating 
for 2,000 and 1,000 spectators, 

respectively.

When I heard my fellow 

colleagues talk about covering 
lacrosse, I found out that the 
team played inside a nearly-
empty Michigan Stadium. 
That’s because the lacrosse 
teams — which didn’t become 
varsity sports until 2011 — 
didn’t have a stadium of their 
own. The new facilities include 
a stadium with a capacity of 
3,000 people.

And during my freshman 

year, when my roommate was a 
member of the rowing team, I 
learned that the Wolverines had 
outdated training equipment 
and raced at Belleville Lake, 
a 25-minute drive from Ann 
Arbor. The athletic department 
obviously couldn’t build an 
entire body of water, but in the 
new facilities, they did build 
the first indoor rowing tank in 
Michigan history.

With the completion of the 

Athletics South Competition 
and Performance Project, these 
often-overlooked teams now 
have a place they can call their 
own.

In addition to their 

competition venues, they have 
brand-new practice spaces 
and locker rooms, along 
with a 20,000-square-foot 
strength and conditioning 
center and specialized areas 
for performance nutrition and 
athletic medicine.

The facilities will see their 

first game action in January, as 
the track and field team begins 
its season with the Wolverine 
Invitational on Jan. 13. The 
lacrosse teams will follow suit 
in February.

Last Saturday, these student-

athletes received the first 
glimpse into their future at 
Michigan. Simply put, the 
future looks bright.

Colorado State ends Michigan’s postseason

With 
their 
backs 
against 

a wall and its season on the 
line, the Michigan volleyball 
team came out of the huddle to 
respond to a late run by Colorado 
State. 

Trying to force a decisive 

fifth set to extend their NCAA 
Tournament run, senior outside 
hitter Katherine Mahlke failed 
to answer on the Rams’ match 
point, mishandling the point 
to end her career with the 
Wolverines — as well as those 

of Adeja Lambert and Claire 
Kieffer-Wright.

In a tightly contested match, 

Michigan (11-9 Big Ten, 21-12 
overall) saw its season come to 
an end against No. 23 Colorado 
State in four sets. Contrary to 
their scoring struggle late, the 
Wolverines had an offensively 
efficient game. The Rams were 
just better.

“I 
thought 
offensively 

we were pretty good,” said 
Michigan coach Mark Rosen. 
“I thought we sided out — one 
of the indicators we look at 
is sideout percentage — like 

what percentage we sideout in 
serve, receive. Usually if we’re 
above 60, we feel pretty good 
about it. We were 65 tonight, so 
offensively, we did a really good 
job. But you know, you can’t let 
the other team do even better 
offensively, and it got us in 
trouble.”

Colorado State got out to a fast 

start. Scoring three unanswered 
points, the Rams built an early 
lead that they didn’t relinquish 
until Michigan went on a 7-4 
run to tie the first set at 23. 
Despite the comeback effort, 
the Wolverines failed to find an 
answer to the balanced offense 
of Colorado State, allowing the 
Rams to score two consecutive 
points to clinch the set, 25-23.

“They got two really good 

outside hitters. They got two 
middles. They 
got an opposite, 
so 
they’re 

very 
balanced 

with their five 
attackers,” 
Rosen said. “So 
it gets hard to 
get a read on 
them. It’s hard 
to 
say, 
‘Hey, 

we’re going to 
stop this play.’ 
If you just stop one of them, it’s 
not enough.

“So I think their balance was 

really good, and I think that 
created problems for us. I think 
their setter does a really good 
job of running that offense so I 
think that was what was most 
troubling or hard for us.”

That 
offense 
didn’t 
slow 

down at the start of the second. 
Coming out in a similar fashion 
as the first set, Colorado State 
built an early lead.

However, it saw its 5-0 lead 

quickly diminish as Michigan 
rallied 
behind 
sophomore 

outside 
hitter 
Sydney 

Wetterstrom 
and 
redshirt 

sophomore middle blocker Cori 
Crocker to tie the game at seven 
apiece. Wetterstrom finished 
the game with nine kills, while 

Crocker finished with 12 kills on 
a team-high attack percentage of 
.500.

The 
back-and-forth 
frame 

continued 
until 
both 
teams 

found themselves in the same 
situation as the first, tied late in 
the set at 22. Refusing to drop 
another close set, Crocker and 
Mahlke 
scored 
back-to-back 

points before closing the set on a 
service error by the Rams.

The third set continued where 

the second set left off, with the 
lead switching between the 
teams. Colorado State broke off 
into a 3-0 run and maintained 
the lead to win the set, 25-22.

The Wolverines had their 

transition game exposed during 
the exchange. With their first-
ball kill strategy not working 
against 
the 
Rams’ 
defense, 

Michigan 
failed 

to adjust during 
transition, 
allowing 
the 

balanced offense 
of Colorado State 
to score on the 
unset defense.

Junior outside 

hitter 
Carly 

Skjodt looked to 
fix the problem. 
She 
kept 
the 

Wolverines in the fourth frame 
early, scoring seven kills in the 
set. She finished the match with 
a game-high 17 kills and added 
15 digs for her eighth double-
double of the season.

Sophomore setter Mackenzie 

Welsh 
recorded 
her 
third 

double-double of the season 
with 56 assists and 10 digs, 
helping the Wolverines build 
a 24-21 lead late in the fourth 
set. Despite the lead, the Rams’ 
offense once again proved too 
much for Michigan, as they 
closed the match on a 5-0 run.

“I thought we had a chance to 

put the fourth set away and all of 
a sudden we’d be in a fifth set,” 
Rosen said. “We just couldn’t 
put it away in that last rotation. 
Disappointing, but I’m proud of 
how our team fought this year.”

Buckeyes present first 
B1G road test for ‘M’

Last season, the Michigan 

men’s basketball team won its 
second conference game on 
Jan. 14. 

Monday, 
the 
Wolverines 

(1-0 Big Ten, 7-2 overall) seek 
to accomplish that same feat 
nearly a month and a half ahead 
of that, when they take on Ohio 
State (1-0, 6-3) in their second 
early-season conference game.

With the expansion to 20 

conference games from the 
previous 
18 
taking 
effect 

this year, the beginning of 
the 
conference 
schedule 

was pushed up. As a result, 
Michigan 
has 
an 
enticing 

opportunity to give itself a head 
start in the Big Ten standings.

“We’ve had like one day of 

practice that didn’t concern 
‘Get ready for the next game,’ 
” Beilein said. “It’s gonna 
be December 4th, and we’re 
gonna have 10 games in. So we 
haven’t had time to get better 
yet, I look forward to that, but 
games make you better than 
practices.”

Before it can rest, though, a 

road test looms.

Saturday, 
the 
Wolverines 

dispatched Indiana, grabbing 
a comfortable 14-point win 
to open Big Ten play. The 
Buckeyes, 
much 
like 
the 

Hoosiers, are in a rebuilding 
phase. Chris Holtmann, taking 
over after the program fired 
long-time coach Thad Matta, 
has his work cut out for him 
ahead of this season.

A year ago, Michigan won 

just three of its 11 road games 
and lost to Ohio State at home, 
70-66, in perhaps the low point 
of its season. A road game 
of any kind this time of year 
respresents a major challenge 
for the Wolverines; a win over 
the Buckeyes would represent 
a major step, regardless of their 
fluctuation as a program.

Because of that, Beilein is 

uncertain about what to expect 

from the Buckeyes.

“I have no idea what Ohio 

State’s doing. I have no idea,” 
Beilein said. “I know that 
it is (assistant coach) Saddi 
Washington’s scout, but I have 
no idea who they’re playing 
and what they’re doing (with) a 
new coach.”

Under 
Holtmann, 
the 

Buckeyes have started the year 
with an uneven 6-3 record, 
with losses to Butler, Clemson 
and Gonzaga. But they kicked 
off their conference season 
with a convincing win of 
their own, topping Wisconsin, 
83-58.

On the opposing side will 

be a guard Beilein is quite 
familar with, though. Guard 
Andrew Dakich, who played 
at Michigan for the past four 
years, will suit up for the 
Buckeyes this time around. In 
nine games so far, Dakich is 
averaging over 14 minutes per 
game, 10 more than he had a 
season ago with Michigan.

Two wings — senior Jae’Sean 

Tate and junior Bates Diop — 
account for over 30 points per 
game and will be the Buckeyes’ 
primary scorers. How redshirt 
sophomore forward Charles 
Matthews and fifth-year senior 
forward 
Duncan 
Robinson 

matchup with Tate and Diop 
could ultimately tell the tale of 
the game.

And if the Wolverines can 

come out with a win, they 
will grab a major advantage 
ahead of a couple major non-
conference challenges.

“It’s 
pretty 
cool, 
it’s 

December 2nd and we have a 
first Big Ten game — win,” said 
junior forward Moritz Wagner. 
“So that’s pretty sick going into 
January having that win and 
going to Ohio State obviously 
trying to get that second win. 
That’s a big challenge, but 
that’s definitely something to 
have in the back of your mind 
to keep going into UCLA, Texas 
and then Detroit. It’s definitely 
really helpful.”

FOOTBALL
Michigan picked to face 
Cocks in Outback Bowl

Remember that time Jadeveon 

Clowney knocked a helmet off 
Michigan running back Vincent 
Smith? Play it back a few times in 
your head, because the Michigan 
football team has a rematch in 
the same bowl game this year 
against the same opponent.

Jim 
Harbaugh 
and 
the 

Wolverines are Florida bound — 
again — this time to face off with 
South Carolina.

They aren’t playing in the 

College 
Football 
Playoff 
or 

even in a New Year’s Six bowl 
game, but it’s a postseason game 
nonetheless.

On Jan. 1, the Wolverines 

and Gamecocks will meet in 
the Outback Bowl at Raymond 
James Stadium in Tampa, Fla.

“We are honored to represent 

our university and the Big Ten 
Conference in the tradition-
laden Outback Bowl in Tampa,” 
Harbaugh said in a press release. 
“Our players and staff are 
excited to face an excellent SEC 
opponent in South Carolina and 
look forward to the competition 
on New Year’s Day.”

The 
game, 
which 
will 

kickoff at noon eastern time, 
pits Michigan against an SEC 
opponent in a bowl game for the 
second time in Harbaugh’s three 
seasons. This matchup will also 
be the Wolverines’ third-straight 
bowl game in Florida.

Michigan lost in the Orange 

Bowl last year to Florida State, 
33-32, and the Wolverines beat 
Florida the prior year in the 
Citrus Bowl, 41-7.

Michigan’s roster is laden 

with Florida natives. They all 
said they were excited to play the 
Gators to open up the season, and 
once again, those same Florida 
guys are excited to play close to 
home.

“I’m 
sure 
we’ll 
have 

some family come down for 
Christmas,” said senior tackle 
Mason Cole, who is from the 
Tampa area. “I have so many 
friends that just haven’t been 
able to make it up to games, but 
now they’ll be able to make it to 
a game easily. I think everyone’s 
just excited.”

The Wolverines (5-4 Big Ten, 

8-4 overall) finished fourth 
in the Big Ten East, while 
the Gamecocks (5-3 SEC, 8-4 
overall) finished second in the 
SEC East behind No. 3 Georgia.

The last time the two teams 

met was in the 2013 Outback 
Bowl, when the Gamecocks won 
on a late touchdown, 33-28.

Michigan’s 
bowl 
selection 

came after a shakeup among 
college football’s top programs. 
Despite winning the Big Ten 
Championship 
on 
Saturday 

night, Ohio State couldn’t sneak 
into the Playoff. Instead, the 
committee chose a one-loss 
Alabama team — that didn’t play 
for its conference championship 
— to fit in at the No. 4 spot.

Leaving Ohio State out of 

the top four pushed all the 
bowl-eligible Big Ten teams 
down in the selection process. 
Nonetheless, the Wolverines will 
get to play in the Outback Bowl 
ahead of both Michigan State 
and Northwestern, both of which 
finished with better records at 
9-3, and the latter of which beat 
the Wolverines at home.

The rival Spartans ended up 

with the Holiday Bowl in San 
Diego. Speaking to media Sunday 
afternoon, 
Michigan 
junior 

safety Tyree Kinnel talked about 
his immediate reactions to the 
news.

“You can’t win or lose out with 

California or down in Tampa, 
but we know the Outback’s the 
bigger bowl, so we’re definitely 
excited for this one,” Kinnel said. 
“We definitely want to get this 
win for our seniors.”

Patterson would make difference for ‘M’ 
S

hea Patterson played eight 
games this year before 
suffering a season-ending 

injury. In those eight games, 
he threw for 2,259 yards and 17 
touchdowns. 

Michi-

gan’s rotat-
ing trio of 
quarter-
backs? Well, 
they threw 
for a com-
bined 2,023 
yards and 
nine touch-
downs — in 
12 games.

There 

shouldn’t be any debate. If it’s on 
the table, Patterson and the Wol-
verines should get hitched.

And it certainly seems like 

there’s a chance that could hap-
pen — maybe even more than just 
a chance at this point.

Yesterday, the Ole Miss Spirit 

of 247Sports reported that the 
Rebels granted their star sopho-
more quarterback permission to 
contact other teams about trans-
ferring, with both parties signing 
a “permission to contact” form. 
That means that Patterson can 

reach out to teams like Michigan 
— and in turn, teams like Michi-
gan can reach out to him.

The Spirit also reported that 

the Wolverines are “probably the 
favorite” for Patterson, if he does 
indeed decide to transfer.

Of course, Patterson’s deci-

sion to transfer is likely contin-
gent on whether he’ll be eligible 
immediately. In fact, one of his 
teammates has already retained 
a lawyer to petition the NCAA 
for immediate eligibility. So for 
the sake of this exercise, let’s 
assume Patterson won’t have to 
sit out a year — giving him status 
as a coveted free-agent for any 
quarterback-starved teams.

Hello, Michigan.
As we all saw throughout the 

year — whether it was against 
Michigan State or Ohio State — 
the Wolverines have been in need 
of better quarterback play. One 
might argue Brandon Peters has 
done enough to prove he should 
be the team’s quarterback of 
the future, or that the praise for 
Dylan McCaffrey shows he could 
start next year. Maybe bring-
ing in a hired gun like Patterson 
would ruffle a few feathers.

But Patterson would supply 

what the Wolverines have need-
ed. He’s got a pedigree unlike 
that of any other quarterback on 
the roster.

People have been talking about 

him for years, long before he even 
joined the college ranks. He was 
ranked as the No. 4 overall pros-
pect and the No. 1 pro-style quar-
terback in his recruiting class. He 
won a pair of national champion-
ships playing for Calvary Baptist 
Academy in Louisiana. Then he 
transferred to IMG Academy for 
his senior year, a football factory 
that plays top teams from across 
the country every year. All Pat-
terson did was lead them to a 
perfect 9-0 record.

He didn’t face much of a learn-

ing curve once he got to Ole 
Miss, either. After Chad Kelly 
went down with a season-ending 
injury, Hugh Freeze chose to lift 
Patterson’s redshirt and start him 
on the road against then-No. 8 
Texas A&M.

That stage wasn’t too bright 

for the highly-touted freshman. 
Patterson led the Rebels to a 
29-28 upset win, throwing for 338 
yards and two touchdowns and 
adding 64 yards on the ground. 
In College Station, he looked 

every bit the dynamic player he 
had been hyped up to be.

Patterson was well on his way 

to taking the proverbial next step 
this year, too, before a PCL injury 
against LSU ended his season 
prematurely.

Make no mistake about it: Pat-

terson would be a perfect fit for 
Michigan. Watch the highlights, 
and you’ll see.

Patterson can hit all the 

throws required in Jim Har-
baugh’s offense. The Wolverines 
couldn’t complete a deep ball 
this year. Patterson averaged 8.7 
yards per attempt this year and 
averaged 33.1 yards per touch-
down pass, a mark that ranked 
third-best in the nation according 
to Pro Football Focus.

He also brings more to the 

table than your typical pocket-
passer. At times, Patterson looks 
like the second coming of Johnny 
Manziel, displaying an innate 
ability to feel pressure, dodge 
pass rushers and deliver catch-
able balls on the run. Consider 
him already well-equipped to 
deal with Michigan’s issues in 
pass protection.

It’s possible that Peters or 

McCaffrey could still lead the 
Wolverines to the promised land. 
But projecting that requires some 
squinting. You have to imagine 
one quarterback with 64 career 
attempts making a huge leap, 
or a quarterback who has never 
even attempted a throw in college 
doing the same. The man under 
center would still be a question 
mark, less of a sure thing.

And therein lies the difference 

between Patterson and Michi-
gan’s current options. Shea Pat-
terson doesn’t project to be good. 
He is good.

Add him to the roster, and 

you’ve got a winning equation. 
There’s no squinting required to 
predict a season that ends with 
Michigan’s first appearance in 
the College Football Playoff.

FOOTBALL
Harbaugh talks Playoff 
format, Speight, Peters

If you haven’t heard already, 

no Big Ten team made the College 
Football Playoff. 

Instead, the Playoff committee 

opted for a one-loss Alabama 
team.

It didn’t take long for Jim 

Harbaugh to be asked about his 
reaction to the lack of conference 
representation in the Playoff 
when he was featured on the 
Outback 
Bowl 
teleconference 

Sunday night.

And 
his 
answer 
didn’t 

disappoint, as he stressed that a 
16-team playoff would be ideal in 
his mind.

“My reaction is that there 

should be more than four teams in 
the Playoff,” he said. “Again, just 
reiterate — eight teams, 12 teams, 
16 teams. … That would make it 
more like every other sport. … I 
think it’s the ideal way to do it.”

PETERS 
THE 
NO. 
1: 

According 
to 
Harbaugh, 
the 

Wolverines are set to resume full 
team practices Monday.

And when that time comes, 

redshirt 
freshman 
Brandon 

Peters will be Michigan’s starting 
quarterback.

“We’ll 
start 
practice 
with 

Brandon as the No. 1 quarterback,” 
Harbaugh said.

Peters took over the starting 

reigns 
midway 
through 
the 

Wolverines’ 
matchup 
against 

Rutgers, but was injured against 
Wisconsin and subsequently went 
through 
concussion 
protocol. 

Though he wasn’t cleared in 
time to face the Buckeyes, he did 
resume practicing last Tuesday.

Of course, the current certainty 

to start Peters comes in the wake 
of redshirt junior Wilton Speight’s 
announcement that he will be 
transferring to play out his final 
year 
of 
eligibility 
elsewhere. 

Harbaugh, though, has no hard 
feelings about Speight’s decision.

“I just support him, like all the 

guys on the team. I support what 
they think is best for them. … I’ve 
always had a good relationship 

with Wilton, and I was … just 
happy that he came in to talk to 
me.

“We had an honest discussion 

— always strive for that with all of 
our players — and just know what’s 
on his mind. Nothing secretive, 
nothing’s coming from the dark 
shadows. It doesn’t have to be that 
way — just good, upfront, honest 
dialogue. And I appreciate those 
kind of relationships the most.”

“NOT 
GOOD 
ENOUGH”: 

As is customary, the preparation 
leading up to the Wolverines’ 
bowl 
game 
provides 
players 

— especially those who didn’t 
receive significant reps during the 
regular season — with nearly a full 
month to improve.

And Harbaugh was quick to 

acknowledge that the practice 
time will help Michigan reach a 
level it has failed to attain thus far 
this season.

“We look at it right now (as) 

we’re not good enough. Not good 
enough to win all of our games 
and we need to be better. We need 
to be good enough. And that starts 
now. That really started last week, 
as we go forward, building and 
attacking.”

MISCELLANEOUS: 
Tyree 

Kinnel said Sunday afternoon that 
he is “100 percent” healthy, after 
suffering his first ever concussion 
against Ohio State. He went 
through concussion protocol for a 
week before being cleared.

Harbaugh said he was “leaning 

toward” preserving Tarik Black’s 
medical redshirt by not playing 
him in the Outback Bowl. Black 
played in four games this year 
before suffering a broken foot, 
and according to NCAA rules four 
games is the maximum a player 
can play to qualify for a medical 
redshirt. According to Harbaugh, 
Black will most likely resume 
practicing.

Michigan’s starters did not 

practice last week, but did have 
weight room sessions. Backups 
practiced last Tuesday, Thursday 
and Saturday. Harbaugh said that 
full team practices will resume 
tomorrow.

Wolverines surrender momentum at USNTDP

It 
would 
have 
been 

understandable if fans had walked 
out of USA Hockey Arena on 
Saturday night just 25 minutes into 
the game. The Michigan hockey 
team led the U-18 U.S. National 
Development Program, 4-0, after 
senior 
forward 
Dexter 
Dancs 

tapped in a power play goal just 
over five minutes into the second 
period. 

But leaving, of course, would 

have been a mistake. Masked 
behind the Wolverines’ statistical 
rout of the USNTDP was the fact 
that a shift in momentum would 
soon make the game a lot closer 
than could have been anticipated 
from Michigan’s flying start.

Two minutes after Dancs’ goal, 

the USNTDP began to chip away 
at the Wolverine lead. On a power 
play, forward Oliver Wahlstrom 
was the first to knock the puck past 
sophomore 
goaltender 
Hayden 

Lavigne.

And in the blink of an eye, the 

USNTDP had cut its deficit to 
two. Under two minutes after the 
first goal, forward Patrick Giles 

found the back of Michigan’s net, 
too. With just over three minutes 
remaining in the period, Giles 
fired again, successfully evading 
Lavigne’s gloves for the second 
time of the night.

In the course of 13 minutes, 

within a sole period, the Wolverines 
went from unevenly dominating a 
game to almost surrendering their 
edge.

“I think this is one of the biggest 

games on (USNTDP’s) schedule,” 
said 
senior 
forward 
Tony 

Calderone. “They wanted to bring 
it to us, so we had to match that.” 

A common theme in Michigan’s 

games this season have been big, 
late-game 
comebacks, 
leaving 

fans on the edge of their seats 
throughout the second and third 
periods. 
But 
Saturday 
night’s 

exhibition 
match 
saw 
almost 

the reverse for the Wolverines. 
Michigan began with a sizable lead 
but almost lost it, and was outshot 
by the USNTDP over the final two 
periods of the game. 

And the Wolverines attributed 

their second period energy shift to 
easing up on offensive intensity.

“I think we get too comfortable,” 

Calderone said. “We get a couple 

goals up, and everyone kind of sits 
back. It’s something we need to 
work on going forward.” 

Michigan coach Mel Pearson 

echoed 
these 
sentiments, 

highlighting the danger of getting 
comfortable with your position in a 
game no matter the score.

“We got comfortable with a big 

lead tonight,” Pearson said. “And 
it’s easy to think you have the game 
where you want it, and just relax a 
little bit. And the other team, I’m 
sure the coach is getting after them 
a bit, and that’s the difference. We 
even scored the first goal in the 
second to make it 4-0.

“It’s like if you’re going up a hill 

and you have to keep your foot on 
the gas pedal. But if you take it off 
you’re not going to keep climbing 
up that hill, you’re going to start 
going backwards. And I think 
that’s part of what the problem was 
tonight, anyway.”

The “second period slump” is a 

concept that the Wolverines have 
been familiar with recently, unable 
to keep up with the pace set by the 
opposition during the period.

In four of its last six games, 

Michigan has been outscored in the 
second period. And this exhibition 

was a continuation of that trend — 
something the Wolverines would 
like to see altered before returning 
to their conference schedule.

Pearson attributes Michigan’s 

difficulty to keep its large lead in 
the second period to the pace of 
line changes. Due to the nature 
of the exhibition, the rotation of 
line changes was slower, as every 
Wolverine had the opportunity to 
see ice time in the match.

“We just wanted to try some 

different things tonight,” Pearson 
said. “We dressed everybody, and 
that’s one of the things that made it 
difficult, as players were not getting 
on the ice as much as you would 
like.”

Despite 
Michigan’s 
sluggish 

display in the second period, the 
Wolverines were able to compose 
themselves in the final stanza, 
tacking on three insurance goals 
while sacrificing none.

But the second period should 

act as a cautionary tale for 
Michigan as it moves forward 
with Big Ten matchups. The 
exhibition highlighted how quickly 
momentum can shift when one 
team’s offense starts getting hot 
and the other stays idle.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
‘M’ blows out LIU

Thirty-three seconds into 

the game, junior center Hallie 
Thome hit a layup to give No. 
22 Michigan its first lead – a 
lead the Wolverines would 
never surrender. 

Following 
Wednesday’s 

blowout loss to No. 3 Notre 
Dame, the Michigan women’s 
basketball team (5-2 overall) 
came out blazing in its 86-49 
victory 
over 

the Blackbirds 
(3-4). 
From 

the start, the 
Wolverines 
pressed 
the 

action on both 
sides 
of 
the 

ball. 
By 
the 

end 
of 
the 

first 
quarter, 

Michigan 
already 
accumulated a 
19-point lead.

“It 
was 
a 

great 
start,” 

said coach Kim 
Barnes Arico. “I 
was really proud of the way we 
defended and how we moved 
the ball on offense, and we 
were able to knock down some 
shots.”

The second quarter was 

much of the same – as the 
Wolverines carried a 45-11 
lead into the halftime break. 
For over 12 minutes of the 
first half, Michigan held LIU 
scoreless, while it knocked 
down 25 points.

The 
Wolverines 
found 

success through their ability 
to share the basketball. Four 
players reached double figures 
in scoring – Thome (19), senior 
guard Katelynn Flaherty (16), 
junior guard Nicole Munger 
(16) and freshman guard Deja 
Church (12) – and Michigan 
recorded a season-high 23 
assists. 
Forward 
Jillian 

Dunston led the way with eight 
on her own, a career high for 
the senior.

“We’ve been trying to figure 

out a way to utilize Jillian 
best,” Barnes Arico said. “The 
game has really slowed down 
for her. She’s playing as an 
experienced player. She’s a 
great student (of the game), 
one of the best that we have. 
When she screens and she 
opens, she is available to make 
those extra passes.”

Not only were 

the Wolverines 
distributing 
the rock, but 
they 
were 

capitalizing 
on their shots. 
Michigan 
shot a season-
high 
52.3 

percent 
from 

the 
floor. 
Its 

most 
efficient 

players, Church 
and 
Thome, 

shot a combined 
13-of-16 
from 

the 
field. 

Munger wasn’t 

far 
behind, 
as 
the 
sharp 

shooter seemed to finally find 
her stroke, making 5-of-7 from 
behind the arc. 

“It was great to see her 

knock down shots,” Barnes 
Arico said. “But even diving on 
the floor for a loose ball when 
we were up 30, it just speaks 
volumes to the kind of player 
she is.”

The star players weren’t 

the only ones contributing 
on 
Saturday, 
though. 
The 

lopsided game allowed all 11 
Wolverines to enter the game, 
and Michigan’s bench racked 
up 24 points.

The blowout also allowed 

the Wolverines’ starters to get 
some rest, which may prove 
crucial for Michigan with 
a quick turnaround against 
Detroit Mercy on Monday.

Freshmen set tempo, Michigan beats Indiana

Jay-Z’s 
“U 
Don’t 
Know” 

blared amongst a chorus of 
cheers from a packed Crisler 
Center crowd.

The 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball 
team 
was 
only 

going 
through 
introductions 

for 
its 
Saturday 
afternoon 

matchup against Indiana, but 
the intensity was the highest it 
had been so far this season. Big 
Ten play doesn’t normally start 
this early, but the conference 
matchup aura was surely alive.

It would be fair if the higher 

stakes caused a few extra 
nerves. But for the Wolverines’ 
freshmen, that wasn’t the case.

In 
Michigan’s 
win 
over 

the Hoosiers (0-1 Big Ten, 
4-4 
overall), 
Eli 
Brooks, 

Jordan 
Poole 
and 
Isaiah 

Livers combined for 28 of the 
Wolverines’ (1-0, 7-2) 69 points 
— 19 of which came from Poole 
— as they continued to showcase 
aggressiveness atypical of a 
first-year player.

“We’ve seen it a little bit in 

practice, but not a lot in practice 
because they’re still growing 
every day. … I love these three 
freshman now. I love them. 
They still make me angry almost 
everyday,” Beilein said with a 
smile.

An 
unbridled 
confidence 

is nothing new for Poole, and 
having increased his playing 
time each of the past three 
games — he had 27 minutes 
against Indiana — you could say 
it’s treating him and Michigan 
kindly.

“I think you saw a young guy 

play with great confidence as he 
got going early,” said Indiana 
coach Archie Miller. “For him to 
hit five threes in his first Big Ten 
game … that’s unbelievable.”

Poole led the Wolverines 

in both scoring and energy. 
The guard essentially started 
Saturday, substituting in for 
Charles 
Matthews 
just 
14 

seconds into the game after 

an early foul. Following a 
3-pointer from fifth-year senior 
forward 
Duncan 
Robinson, 

Poole knocked one down on 
the next possession. Less than 
90 seconds later, the shooting 
guard hit another.

“I was like, ‘It’s time to lock 

in,’ ” Poole said. “Especially 
coming off a loss at North 
Carolina, nobody’s shots were 
falling, it was 
just 
time 
to 

lock in. … I feel 
like 
I 
kinda 

sneaked up on 
them a little 
bit.”

But 
Poole 

wasn’t 
done 

yet. 
At 
the 

9:23 mark in 
the first half, 
junior forward 
Moritz Wagner found a cutting 
Poole from the top of the key for 
an easy layup. Just 3 minutes 
prior, Wagner found Livers on 
a similar play for an open layup. 
It was a sign for Michigan coach 
John Beilein: the freshmen 
are getting it, and sooner than 

expected.

“It’s 
been 
great 
seeing 

us grow as a group and as 
individuals. That’s been good,” 
Brooks said. “… The confidence 
from the older guys have in you 
and the other freshmen (helps). 
The confidence that the coaches 
have, that really helps.”

Poole is also customarily 

the most theatrical celebrator 

on 
the 
bench, 

but 
with 
more 

contributions 
coming 
on 
the 

court, 
he 
found 

himself waving his 
arms up and down 
to liven the crowd 
after he hit a side-
step trey.

And in Brooks’ 

sixth 
straight 

start, 
he 
once 

again proved why he should 
be manning the ‘1.’ Brooks 
notched 
a 
career-best 
six 

assists, including the kickout to 
Poole for his first three of the 
game. The 6-foot-1 guard also 
demonstrated his knockdown 
ability, 
drilling 
a 
stepback 

jumper as the shot clock wound 
down late in the first half.

“We’ve 
seen 
this 
ability 

to think to the next play,” 
Beilein said. “Not all of his 
fundamentals are there, but 
his mind is there and just he’s 
learning how to do it. For a 
freshman to play against a fifth-
year guy and have six assists and 
no turnovers, that was really a 
big step for him.”

Livers’ statline was quieter 

than Brooks’ and Poole’s, but 
he helped shore up a frontcourt 
defense of Wagner and Robison 
that allowed 36 of Indiana’s 55 
points in the paint. Livers also 
had a steal-turned-fastbreak-
layup in the first half, an 
opportunity that was swatted 
out his hands against North 
Carolina.

Beilein had reiterated at the 

postgame press conference that 
his team will consistently come 
out firing and that it was only 
a matter of time. On Saturday 
afternoon, nine games into the 
season and in large part thanks 
to his freshmen, his words were 
coming to life.

Freshman guard Jordan Poole finished with a team-high 19 points, leading a strong showing from the freshman class.

I love these 

three freshmen 
right now. I love 

them.

Despite line changes, Wolverines top USNTDP

PLYMOUTH, 
Mich. 
– 

Michigan coach Mel Pearson 
decided to break up his most 
powerful 
offensive 
line 
by 

switching 
forwards 
Will 

Lockwood and Tony Calderone 
with the goal of spurring a more 
diverse offensive threat.

What ensued in the first and 

second periods Saturday night 
was not the sign of an eclectic 
offense, despite the 7-4 victory. 
Calderone, junior center Cooper 
Marody and senior left wing 
Dexter 
Dancs 
– 
who 
have 

combined for 47 points thus 
far this season – continued to 
dominate the stat sheet.

“We just want to try some 

things and you could see we 
were all over the place with lines 
today,” Pearson said. “Obviously 
Tony got back with Cooper and 
Cooper makes the plays to him, 
they’ve got something going.”

Added Lockwood: “I don’t 

think it changes much team 
dynamic. I think to find that 

chemistry 
between 
lines 
is 

important.”

The Michigan hockey team 

(2-4-2 Big Ten, 6-6-2 overall) 
faced 
off 
against 
the 
U.S. 

National 
Team 
Development 

Program Under-18 Team in an 
exhibition with plenty to prove 
coming off a series sweep by 
Ohio State.

Calderone set the trend early 

in the first period with two goals. 
On a cross-ice pass and then later 
on a solo streak down the right 
flank, he delivered two crisp 
wrist shots that easily snuck past 
goaltender Drew Deridder – who 
will play for Michigan State next 
season.

The 
early 
score 
from 

Calderone 
– 
paired 
with 

Michigan’s intention to play a 
physical match, exemplified by 
a concerted effort to de-skate its 
younger foes – proved that the 
Wolverines 
weren’t 
planning 

on giving the USNTDP any 
breathing room.

“I think they brought the fire 

right away,” Calderone said. “I 
think this is one of the biggest 

games on their schedule. They 
wanted to bring it to us, so we 
had to match that.”

Marody and sophomore center 

Adam Winborg increased the 
Wolverines’ lead to four with 
two goals only minutes apart. 
The first came on a faceoff pass 
from sophomore left wing Jake 
Slaker and the second on another 
wrist shot.

After a scoring lull at the start 

of the second period, Michigan 
struck again nearly five minutes 
into the frame in a manner that 
fans have been seeing all season. 
Marody delivered a pass in the 
slot to Calderone, who passed to 
Dancs, who then buried the puck 
into the back of the net for the 
Wolverines’ fourth goal.

However, 
the 
U-18 
team 

wasn’t sitting in the passenger 
seat to simply watch Michigan 
tally its 16th win in the all-time 
record column. It continuously 
forced turnovers and dealt back 
some of the damage dealt to 
them on the boards.

The USNTDP found the back 

of the net as well. Forward 

Oliver Wahlstrom netted its first 
goal almost seven minutes into 
the second period. Under two 
minutes later, forward Patrick 
Giles scored again to drop the 
deficit to two. And with three 
minutes left, Giles struck again 
to reduce the Wolverines’ lead 
to 4-3.

After that comeback, Michigan 

opened the third period looking 
completely 
dissimilar 
to 
its 

earlier self. But the Wolverines 
would soon find their groove 
again. Within 12 seconds of each 
other, Calderone and Lockwood 
gave Michigan some insurance 
with a goal apiece to bump its 
lead back up to three.

And a goal from sophomore 

center Nick Pastujov – assisted 
by his brother and fellow center 
Michael 
Pastujov 
– 
sealed 

USNTDP’s fate.

That goal proved that the 

Wolverines’ offense can have 
various lethal capabilities, but 
the 
changes 
Pearson 
made 

weren’t enough to make it a 
storyline for the whole game. At 
least, though, it was a start.

Senior forward Tony Calderone scored two early goals to give Michigan a lead that it wouldn’t relinquish against the U.S. National Team Development Program.
