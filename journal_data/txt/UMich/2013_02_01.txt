ACLU, unions sue state

Suit alleges that Capitol,
lockdown subverted
democracy
By MATTHEW JACKONEN
Daily Staff Reporter
On Thursday, the American Civil Lib-
erties Union of Michigan and a group
of labor unions have asked a state judge
Thursday to review Michigan's contro-
versial right-to-work law that passed

through the stat legislature at the end of
2012.
RanaElmir, communications director
of the Michigan ACLU, wrote in a state-
ment that the law should be struck down
because.the public was barred from the
state Capitol during its enactment. He
claims that this was a violation of the
Open Meetings Act, the First Amend-
ment of the United States Constitution
and the state's Constitution.
The Open Meetings Act is a sun-
shine law meant to improve government

access to the meetings of certain offi-
cials. The lawsuit focuses on finding
fault in the process by which the legis-
lation was passed rather than the right-
to-work law itself, which does not allow
paying union dues to be a condition of
any workplace.
On Dec. 6, Elmir alleges Capitol's
doors were locked in order to limit
observation of the debates on the right-
to-work legislation. The suit argues that
the galleries overlookingthe floor of the

BorgWarner,

$2 million
ByASHWINI NATARAJAN
Daily StaffReporter
It's not every day that the
Engineering Dean David Mun-
son jumps in the air to chest-

bump a donor.
Munson and the department
of mechanical engineering cel-
ebrated a $2-million donation to
a department chair endowment
at a ceremony Thursday. The
donation ceremony, held in the
Lurie Engineering Center, gar-
nered an audience of about 80
engineering professionals and
industry representatives.
The donors to the department

included powertrain manufac-
turer BorgWarner and its execu-
tive chairman, University alum
Tim Manganello. Manganello
is a former member of the
Engineering advisory council
and executive chairman of the
BorgWarner Foundation - the
company's charitable arm that
supports scientific, literary and
educational pursuits.
Because the endowment

will fund both the department
chair - currently Engineering
Prof. Kon-Well Wang - and the
department itself, the gift is the
first of its kind for the depart-
ment. In past years, contribu-
tions have gone only to fund the
work of only the department's
chair.

About 55 percent of
faculty, staff take
part in MHealthy
By ARIANA ASSAF
Daily Staff Reporter
University employees have a
shot to earn a small stipendand
take advantage of the benefits of
MHealthy fitness classes.
Founded in 2005 as part of ini-
tiatives by University President
Mary Sue Coleman, MHealthy
is now offering monetary incen-
tives up to $100 for faculty who
complete at least two approved
health-promoting activities.
The pilot program began with
MHealthy in 2005, and the first
five-year plan was formulated in
2008. A new five-year plan focus-
es on decreasing the percentage
of employees with a high health
risk.
Administrators at MHealthy
said a recent evaluation sug-
gested the program is making a
difference in regard to various
health risk factors and is ulti-
mately combating health-care
cost escalation.
The incentive program began
in 2009 as part of MHealthy's
goal ofahealthy campus commu-
nity as a result of research that
suggested monetary incentives
can influence behavior.
Requirements to achieve
incentives have changed and
broadened over time in response
to 'faculty interests. Options
include enrolling in fitness
classes, undergoing a biomet-
ric screening and completing a
health risk survey.
Laurita Thomas, the Univer-

sity's associate vice president for
human resources, said it's impor-
tant that employees complete the
health risk survey that's released
everyfewyears. Thesurveyhelps
the program tailor to the specific
needs of University faculty.
"We could do something that
everybody else is doing, but our
community may need something
different," Thomas said. "The
questionnaire gives us data to
track how well we're doing over
time."
For example, the most recent
questionnaire found that back
pain is particularly prevalent
among University employees.
Thomas said there are many
health-friendly initiatives on
campus, such as bike paths,
healthy eating options and
late-night programs that give
students an alternative to less
healthy weekend activities.
bue to recent changes, those
covered by University health-
care plans, like spouces of faculty
can complete the health ques-
tionnaire and enroll in various
MHealthy programs.
"if the whole family is work-
ing on health, the employee is
more likelyto be successful," said
Thomas.
University employees can earn
$50 by completing the survey,
and then earn another $80 by
completing an approved activity.
Thomas said the incentive cash
supply comes'from a combina-
tion of University investments
and individual contributions.
By the end of 2013, the pro-
gram aims to have 70 percent
of all employees participat-
ing in MHealthy's Active U, a

10 month rule of
Islamists ends in
beleaguered city
TIMBUKTU, Mali (AP) - On
the morning French comman-
dos parachuted onto the sand
just north of this storied city and
ended 10 months of Islamic rule,
Hawi Traore folded up her veil.
On the next day, she wore heels.
On the day after, she put on her
sparkly earrings, got her hair
braided and tried her mother's
perfume.
Finally on Thursday, the
12-year-old girl dared to dance
in the streets, celebrating free-
dom from the draconias rules
that were imposed by the' al-
Qaida-linked militants on this
desert capital for much of the
past year.
Four days since French spe-
cial forces liberated Timbuktu,
there is a growing sense of
freedom - particularly among
women. The speed with which
women have claimed back their
freedom underscores one of
the advantages the French hold
against an elusive enemy on
unforgiving terrain: The popu-
lation here has long practiced a
moderate Islam rather than the

extremism of the militants.
Although Timbuktu has long
been a code word for the ends
of the earth, until recently its
women led a relatively mod-
ern existence, where they were
not required to be covered and
could socialize with men. That
changed abruptly last year, when
radical Islamists seized control
of the northern half of Mali in
the chaos after a coup in the dis-
tant capital.
When they first arrived,
Hawi, a tall, fast-talking, sassy
preteen girl, was just learn-
ing how to put on makeup. She
learned the hard way to wear the
toungou, the word for veil in the
Songhai language. Her slender
arm still bears the scar left'by
the whip of the Islamic police,
her punishment for not properly
coveringup.
Her once-free life became
increasingly restricted, as did
that of her sisters and friends.
The Islamists showed no
mercy, beating everyone from
pregnant women to grand-
mothers to 9-year-old girls who
weren't fully covered. Even
talking to a brother on the front
stoop of a woman's own home
could get her in trouble.
Smoking, drinking and music
were banned. So was playing

soccer. The worst punishment
was reserved for love outside the
rules, and an unmarried couple
who had two children out of
wedlock was stoned to death in
one northern Malian town.
Fatouma Traore lives on
Street No. 415 in Timbuktu, the
road that runs directly in front of
the building where the Islamic
Tribunal operated in what was
once a luxury, boutique hotel.
A leaflet left in the dirt in the
courtyard set out eight rules for
how women should wear the veil.
Rule No. 1 is that the fabric
should cover the entire body.
Rule No. 2 is that it can't be
transparent. Rule No. 3 is that it
needs to be colorless. And finally,
Rule No. 8 states that a woman
should not perfume herself after
puttingit on.
"We even bought a veil for
this baby," said the 21-year-old
Traore, picking up her 1-year-
old niece and hoisting her on one
hip. "Even if you are wearing the
veil and it happens to slip off and
you are trying to put it back on,
they hit you."
The French military launched
an intervention to oust the
Islamists from power in northern

Chinese hackers probed The New
York Times' computers since Sept.

Hackers look
for reporters'
passwords, files on
top Chinese leader
BEIJING (AP) - Chinese
hackers repeatedly penetrated
The New York Times' com-
puter systems over the past
four months, stealing report-
ers' passwords and hunting for
files on an investigation into
the wealth amassed by the fam-
ily of a top Chinese leader, the
newspaper reported Thursday.
Security experts hired to
investigate and plug the breach
found that the attacks used
tactics similar to ones used
in previous hacking incidents
traced to China, the report
said. It said the hackers routed
the attacks through computers
at U.S. universities, installed a
strain of malicious software,
or malware, associated with
Chinese hackers and initiated
the attacks from Chinese uni-
versity computers previously
used by the Chinese military
to attack U.S. military contrac-
tors.
The attacks, which began
in mid-September, coincided
with a Times investigation into
how the relatives and family
of Premier Wen Jiabao built a
fortune worth over $2 billion.
The report, which was posted
online Oct. 25, embarrassed the
Communist Party leadership,
coming ahead of a fraught tran-
sition to new leaders and expos-
ing deep-seated favoritism at a

time when many Chinese are
upset about a wealth gap.
Over the months of cyber-
incursions, the hackers even-
tually lifted the computer
passwords of all Times employ-
ees and used them to get into
the personal computers of 53
employees.
The report said none of the
Times' customer data was com-
promised and that information
about the investigation into the
Wen family remained protect-
ed, though it left unclear what
data or ,communications the.
infiltrators accessed.
"Computer security experts
found no evidence that sensi-
tive emails or files from the
reporting of our articles about
the Wen family were accessed,
downloaded or copied," the
report quoted executive edi-
tor Jill Abramson as saying. A
Times spokeswoman declined
to comment further.
The Chinese foreign and
defense ministries called the
Times' allegations baseless, and
the Defense Ministry denied any
involvement by the military.
"Chinese law forbids hack-
ing and any other actions that
damage Internet security,"
the Defense Ministry said in
a statement. "The Chinese
military has never supported
any hacking activities. Cyber-
attacks are characterized by
being cross-national and anon-
ymous. To accuse the Chinese
military of launching cyber-
attacks without firm evidence
is not professional and also
groundless."
China has been accused by

the U.S., other foreign govern-
ments and computer security
experts of mounting a wide-
spread, aggressive cyber-spy-
ing campaign for several years,
trying to steal classified infor-
mation and corporate secrets
and to intimidate critics. For-
eign reporters and news media,
including The Associated Press,
have been among the targets of
attacks intended to uncover the
identities of sources for news
stories and to stifle critical
reports about the Chinese gov-
ernment.
"Attacks on journalists
based in China are increas-
ingly aggressive, disruptive and
sophisticated," said Greg Wal-
ton, a cyber-securityresearcher
who has tracked Chinese hack-
ing campaigns. China's cyber-
spying efforts have excelled
in part because of the govern-
ment's "willingness to ignore
international norms relating to
civil society and media organi-
zations," he said.
The Times reported that
executives became concerned
just before the publication of
the Wen investigation after
learning that Chinese officials
had warned of unspecified con-
sequences. Soon after the Oct.
25 publication, AT&T, which
monitors the Times' computer
networks, notified the company
about activity consistent with a
hacking attack, the report said.
After months of investiga-
tion by the computer security
firm Mandiant, experts are still
unsure how the hackers initial-
ly infiltrated the Times' com-
puter systems, the report said.

Lets get high
New high-rise apartment buildings can benefit Ann Arbor
n the fall, The Varsity, a new luxury high-rise apartment complex
geared toward students, will be opening its doors to the commu-
nity. Located on East Washington Street, The Varsity will be the
sixth high-rise built in Ann Arbor in recent years. With new high-rises
being planned in different parts of Ann Arbor as part of City Council's
commitment to city development, there's concern about changing the
culture and spirit of Ann Arbor. That being said, these high-rises have
the potential to greatly benefit the city's economy.

The Ann Arbor Discovering Downtown
project, or A2D2, was established in Septem-
ber 2006. The goal of the project is to give
Ann Arbor a more city-like atmosphere, and
has received a positive response from the pub-
lit in a survey. As a result, at least two more
high-rises are in the proposal stages of devel-
opment: one above Pizza House on Church
Street and one in the spot of the Papa John's on
East Huron and North Division streets. While
the commission approved the high-rise above
Pizza House, the East Huron high-rise was
indefinitely postponed. However, these high-
rises are the inevitable outcome of A2D2's
push for a bigger-city features.
High-rises will make off-campus housing
for students more affordable and efficient
for the University's student body of approx-
imately 43,000. With high and constant
demand for housing closer to campus, the
increased supply will drive down the price
- which is often over $1,000 per month for
complexes like Landmark and Zaragon Place
- of these apartments. The induced compe-
tition with the added high-rises will likely
allow the average student to live near campus

for a more reasonable price.
There are two aspects of these develop-
ments, however, that the City Council should
consider while approving these new apart-
ments: sustainability and a balance between
luxurious and affordable. The city and the
University have a dedication to environmen-
tally-friendly policies and programs, and
these new high-rises should remain true to
the trend. These apartments should all meet
LEED standards. The University has made-
steps to ensure that their buildings are LEED
certified; the city of Ann Arbor should fol-
low suit. City Council should not approve all
high-rises; they should set specific criteria
when they approve these buildings that will
benefit students and the city alike.
Students and residents should accept and
encourage the growth and development of
Ann Arbor. The quirky spirit of Ann Arbor
won't diminish because that spirit comes
from the people who live there, not from the
height of apartment buildings. With more
people living in the heart of the city, there's
more opportunity to enjoy what the down-
town has to offer.

magine a world where you can
earn a college degree without
walking into a single classroom.
Actually, con-
sidering the fact
I'm skipping '
class right now,
let me rephrase
that - imagine
getting a bach-
elor's without
ever knowing
where your ecol- MELANIE
ogy lab is, and KRUVELIS
none of the guilt
that comes with
being too lazy to watch the iTunesU
lectures.
Sound too good to be true? Not for
the fighting Badgers.
Last week, the University of Wis-
consin finalized a new program that
allows students to earn a degree not
based credit hours but - get this -
what they actually know.
Dubbed the Flexible Option plan,
the program is pretty straightfor-
ward: Degree-seekersindependently
prepare for exams written by pro-
fessors who specialize in one of the
four majors offered by Flex Option.
A couple of good exam scores, com-
bined with online coursework and
outside credits and, bam, you've got
yourself a degree.
Proponents are calling the pro-
gram visionary, revolutionary -
the future of university education.
"This is a new direction inAmerican
higher education," said University of
Wisconsin System President Kevin
Reilly. Even the governor of Wiscon-
sin backed the program, saying - oh,
dear god, am I about to non-ironical-
ly quote Gov. Scott Walker?
"We can maintain high stan-
dards," Walker said of the program.
"And we can stillgive non-traditional
learners another way to finish their
degrees."
According to a recent article in
The Wall Street Journal, educators
in Wisconsin developed the idea
after noticing the relatively small
number of degree-holders in the
state. About 20 percent of the state's
workforce had a stockpile of credits
but no degree to show for it. Given
that a college degree is just about as
much of a prerequisite for the job
market as being able to sign your
name on a contract, officials pushed
for a program that allows students
to get that bachelor's degree on their
own terms.
An education that's self-taught
and self-directed? A bachelor's that's
based on what you actually learnand
not how many credits you've slept
through? A relatively cheap degree
from a world-renowned university,
not wherever that chick in pajamas
is blabbering about in those YourEd-

Connect commercials?
Seems to make sense. So, natural-
ly, people are spazzing.
"I don't want (Flex Option) to
be a misstep," said Wisconsin state
Sen. Jennifer Shilling (D-32). UW
professors echoed the senator's con-
cerns, worryingabout watered-down
degrees and a disconnect from cam-
pus life. "There's got to be very rigor-
ous documentation that the degree
will live up to the quality of (the
school's) name," said Mark Cook, a
professor at the Madison campus.
In all fairness, these anxieties
aren't new. Ever since Coursera and
other massive open online course
sites popped up, some educators
across the country began to fret
over the future of universities. If
they haven't gotten their bow ties in
a bunch over the Internet's impact
on their institutions, then they're
discrediting the MOOC movement
altogether. "Can you be successful in
truly meaningful ways without going
to college?" asked Engineering Prof.
James Paul Holloway in a recent
piece for Consider magazine. "The
answer for mostofyou is 'No."'
Most of the hubbub surrounds
whether these fast-track, DIY
degrees can replace a full-on univer-
sity education. After all, no matter
how much you verbally assault your
MacBook, it's not going to give you*
any feedback on your essay, much
less a recommendation letter.
But as our dear friend Scott Walk-
er knows, these programs aren't
necessarily a substitute for a campus
education. "It's one more way to get
your degree," Walker said. "I don't
see it as a replacement."
And for the first time in his life,
Walker's right. The Flex Option
plan is primarily aimed at adults
who didn't have time to fin-
ish school. Moreover, these self-
taught programs also give liberal
arts graduates the chance to beef
up their Cv, after the cruel world
reminded them that a humani-
ties degree has approximately the
same value as a sock full of nickels
(and it's a very small sock). Because
when every entry-level job asks for
10 years of experience, five refer-
ences and fluency in Java, Python
and/or C++, maybe it wouldn't hurt
to take a Coursera class in coding.
Unless you want crash on Mom's
papasan forever. ,
I saw this self-guided liberal arts
paranoia myself the other day. I
stopped by a friend's apartment and
noticed a calculus book open on the
table.
"You just graduated," I said to my
friend. "What's with all the deriva-
tives?"
He sighed. "Are you kidding me?
I'm a Screen Arts and Culture major

- my degree isn't worth sack."
And the reaction's just the same
for my Political Science degree or
your Spanish minor or that double
concentration in Deep Ocean Lit-
erature and Creative Toxicology.
Not that these majors are useless -
long live the humanities! But when
the jobs don't rush to your door,
strengthening your skills isn't a bad
option. Presumably, our universities
want us to grow up and be successful
so we can buy lots of $100 Wolverine
fishing reels. If some online courses
help us get there, what's the big deal?
The real issue seems to be this
break from a traditional, on-cam-
pus education. "Universities are the
unique intellectual space," Holloway
said in his Consider article. "The uni-
versity isthe place where we grow."
The face of education
is changing
faster than Kim
Kardashian's.
True. There's really nothing that
can replace the college experience
- unless, of course, you find another
porch in another town to butt-chug
beers on. But I guess Holloway is
more interested in the dialogue that
comes out of the college classroom,
like this one I'm hearing rightnow -
"Did you see him puke in that
sharkbowl last night?"
In all seriousness, critique and
communication - the most obvi-
ous benefits to an in-class educa-
tion - are incredibly important. But
the intellectual world doesn't stop
once you drive past the Big House.
Chances are that if you're motivat-
ed enough to teach yourself a thing
or two, you'll be able to find fellow
nerds to collaborate with. Insert the
names of a bunch of dropouts who
made it big if you don't believe me.
It may not be as easy as it is on cam-
pus, but hey - you're already reading
books that don't start with the pre-
fix 'face.' You're gonna make it, you
overachiever, you.
The face of education is changing
faster than Kim Kardashian's. And
for educators, that's kind of frighten-
ing. But just as students are adjusting
to a world with minimal job security
and maximum loan burdens, uni-
versities must adjust too and back
away from these xenophobic fears
of the Internet. Wake up and smell
the Adderall, higher education. Oh,
and mind if I buy a couple of pills?

SORIN PANAINTE
Make Adidas sweat

A new year has arrived. Accordingly, United
Students AgainstSweatshops presented a New
Year's resolution to University President Mary
Sue Coleman in a letter delivered to her office
on Jan. 16. The resolution is pretty simple: The
University should follow its own Code of Con-
duct for Licensees and take a stand against
sweatshops and worker abuse. Namely, USAS
demands that the University put Adidas
Apparel Company on notice and if the com-
pany fails to pay the legally mandated sever-
ance owed to the PT Kizone factory workers,
then the University should terminate its $60
million contract with Adidas. Other universi-
ties such as the University of Washington and
Rutgers University have already done this, and
Michigan should follow suit.
USAS isagrassrootsorganizationrunentire-
ly by students and youth. We develop youth
leadership and run strategic student-labor soli-
darity campaigns with the goal of building sus-
tainable power for working people. We define
"sweatshop" broadly and consider all struggles
against the daily abuses of the global economic
system to be a struggle against sweatshops.
PT Kizone, a factory in Indonesia, had a
contract with Adidas that stated the German-
based corporation would pay severance to the
workers if the factory were to close. The facto-
ry did indeed close in April 2011, leaving 2,800
people out of work and Adidas owing $1.8 mil-
lion in severance. For over a year and a half,
the 2,800 former PT Kizone workers have
been fighting for the severance pay - which
Adidas promised, but has failed to pay them.
Up until the time of its closure, PT Kizone
was producing University of Michigan appar-
el. That's right, the maize and blue we proudly
wear on our home games and around campus
was produced by sweatshop labor. Of all uni-
versities who have contracts with Adidas,
Michigan has the largest, at $60 million. If our
Universitywere to put pressure on Adidas, the
company would be forced to pay the severance
payments it owes.
Adidas has dodged its obligations by provid-
ing food vouchers and medical assistance to

the workers instead of paying the $1.8 million
it owes them. Adidas, in a Jan. 23 letter to Presi-
dent Coleman, stated, "ensuring fair labor prac-
tices, fair wages and safe workingconditions in
factories throughout our global supply chain
is critical to our business and a priority for the
Adidas Group." If that were trulythe case, then
they would simply pay the severance they owe
to their former workers. The aid provided so far
is mere breadcrumbs compared to whatAdidas
legally owes. Even our president, in a letter to
Adidas on Jan. 25, stated, "There is stillconcern
regarding the gap between aid being provided
by Adidas Group and the legally mandated sev-
erance owed to the workers."
On Jan. 25, Coleman responded to USAS'
Jan. 16 letter. In the e-mail, she said that "the
University is committed to fair and ethical
business practices as set forth in our Code of
Conduct," and that "we remain committed to
finding an appropriate resolution." Coleman
knows that Adidas is not living up to the terms
of the University's contract, and if she's com-
mitted to fair and ethical business practices as
set forth in our Code of Conduct, then the only
appropriate action is to put Adidas on notice.
On Feb. 13, two PT Kizone workers from
Indonesia will arrive to the University of Mich-
igan's campus. At a speak-out event hosted by
USAS, the workers will tell students and the
Ann Arbor public about their experiences. Join
us in the Union Pond Room from 6 to 7 p.m. on
Feb. 13 to hear the truth about Adidas' viola-
tion of workers' rights. You can see for yourself
exactly who these "sweatshop workers" are,
and ask them any questions you may have.
If you want our school to shed its shame-
ful affiliation with an apparel company that
violates workers' rights, write an e-mail to
President Coleman and the Board of Regents
and tell them to put Adidas on notice. If you
want to support workers' rights at home and
abroad, join us at our weekly meetings on
Mondays at 8 p.m. in the CSG wing on the
third floor of the Union.

Fre
I have a problem when filling
out forms. It isn't merely the low-
level contempt many of us have for
bureaucratic rubber-stamping, hoop
jumping and red-taping. I under-
stand the need for a paper trail on
lots of things. This is all done in an
attempt to draw conclusions when
necessary. If you want to track a per-
son's purchases, determine their risk
for cancer or see how their resume
has changed with time, one could do
far worse than a detailed history of
such facts maintained by our bureau-
cratic gatekeepers.
My problem comes in the form of a
single question: "What is your race?"
This question has been asked for
countless instances from job applica-
tions to scholarship forms, including
nearly every governmental ques-
tionnaire starting from the original
1790 U.S. Census - it asked for total
number of "white" men and women,
"other" free persons, and "slaves."
Today, the federally mandated
question on race and origin of eth-
nicity gives seven total choices: His-
panic/Latino, American Indian and
Alaska Native, Asian, Black or Afri-
can American, Native Hawaiian and
Other Pacific Islander, and White.
The census also gives the option of
checking two or more races. What
will no doubt strike some readers is
a lack of some categories altogether.
Where do people from the Middle
East, India or the Basque Country
lie along these categories? There's
also a lack of descriptive force.
Does "black" describe Aborigines,
Haitians and Ethiopians in equal
measure? What I find particularly
distasteful is the notion that such
categories even exist.

edomfrom race

Try for a moment to formulate
what "race" could even mean. A myr-
iad of factors are likely to spring to
mind such as skin color, geographical
origin and physiology.Some may even
try to be a bit more scientific in their
reasoning and say it's ultimately a
shorthand notation intended to stand
in for underlying genetic factors.
But there's clear scientific evidence
to suggest that the genetic variation
within "races" far exceeds that seen
between races. Physical traits such as
skin color, hair type and bone struc-
ture show just as wide a range within
geographical areas and racial bounds
as they do across the whole spectrum
of humanity. To suggest that there is
some number of biological demarca-
tions one could draw across human-
kind along ethnic and racial lines is
to be mistaken at best and outright
deceptive at worst.
Race is, at most, asocial construct.
It has no basis in reality aside'from
the one we impart on each other.
Only by pretending that such a thing
as race describes us do we give it any
credence or manifestation. This is not
to say that race has not had very real
consequences in our world but rather
to lay the blame squarely atthe feetof
those who trod along this evanescent
landscape. Furthermorethat anyone
would wish to divide us any further
than ideologies, predilections and
actions already do is abhorrent.
Spme even go so far as to have
pride in racial divisions. Numer-
ous organizations, institutions and
groups exist to emphasize "us-and-
them" mentalities and to deepen
those lines in the sand over which
we dare not cross. Even worse than
the mistake of separating yourself

based on race is taking pride in your-
self based on it. Esteem in one's self
should stem from one's actions, one's
behavior and one's way of life. There
is nothing to be intrinsically proud
of in bearing the human condition.
What matters is how one comports
oneself while bearing it.
Let us forget the lack of scien-
tific evidence favoring a distinction
amongst the races. Let's do as many
others do and pretend for this para-
graph that there are races of people
that have differing qualities and
aspects. Let's pretend further that
these differences confer benefits
and deficiencies of their respective
races. Let's pretend that race mat-
ters. Where in Ais state of affairs is
pride to be found? Where is shame to
be had? The circumstances of one's
genetic origin (millions of sperm
assaulting an egg with a single win-
ner) is as irrelevant to our characters
as whether we were born during
the day or at night. There is nothing
about us to which race can add.
That is, until other people say
there is. Once enough people pretend
that something is true, it becomes
exceedingly hard to convince them
it's false. It becomes even harder to
convince them that the questions
they are asking are pointless. And
yet there are forms asking us to
divide ourselves, to state to which
category we belong, to account for
the happenstance of our lives. These
forms would have us place ourselves
in boxes. I will not do so. There is
only one such box aboutour race that
I would agree to check: human.

TUITION
From Page 1
Because of its autonomy, the
regenta could even make the
argument that it does not need the
authority of the state of Michigan
to circumvent some of the barri-
ers imposed by the laws. How-
ever, such unilateral action would
likely face public resistance and
draw the University into injunc-
tive lawsuits to reverse the policy.
In an interview last Friday,
University Provost Phil Hanlon
said the difficulty in solving the
issue is caused more by policy
barriers than financial issues.
"Certainly the legal issues are
really the ones that are most com-
plicated and difficult to work out,"
Hanlon said.
California is among 12 states
that have enacted state provi-
sions that allow institutions of
higher education to give benefits
to undocumented individuals.
Enacted in 2001, the California
DREAM act allows public insti-
tutions to grant in-state tuition
to undocumented students who
have graduated from an in-state
high school and arrived to the
United States as minors.
Members of Congress have
proposed similar legislation at the
federal level to no avail.

sity, and that his company is using
this endowment asa way to fulfill
their responsibility of giving back

"I've had a great career - a
great life - and Michigan was a
big contributor to my success and
my life and I thought I'd give back
to the Engineering school," Man-
ganello said. "I'm a proud Michi-
gan graduate."
Manganello wants to help sus-
tain the high level of innovation
and technological output of the
College of Engineering.
"I want (Michigan Engineer-
ing) to continue to be a world
leader in technology ... (and) to
help mankind ... I'm quite confi-
dent that they will continue to be

feminism, which she describes as
"the relationship between differ-
ent countries and political, eco-
nomic and social phenomena and
how we understand them."
"It's meant to provoke people
to think about howwe learn about
the world," Fernandes said. "And
ways that we can think about
viewing the world in ways that
don't produce a nationalistic per-
spective."
Cotera said the event was a
great dialogue between like-

to California, Robert Birgeneau,
chancellor of the University of
California, Berkeley, discussed
with them the circumstances that
allow Berkeley to provide in-state
tuition and Cal Grants - which
provide up to $12,000 in aid - to
undocumented students.
Coleman said Michigan faces
different challenges than Cali-
fornia to support undocumented
students.
"I would love to have the same
circumstances here, but we don't,"
Coleman said. "At the same time,
I want the issue of undocumented
students to be solved."
When California enacted its
version of the DREAM Act in
2001, the UC system was spe-
cifically granted immunity from
civil suits seeking damages by
the state legislature. Despite the
protection, the UC system was
sued for injunctive relief - which
would have reversed the policy
without awarding compensation
- but later won its case before
the California Supreme Court.
The precedent set by the Cali-
fornia court has no standing on
the federal level or in other states.
While Michigan does not have
a similar policy in place, Coleman
said she advocates for state provi-
sions that would ease the Univer-
sity's path towards a resolution of
the tuition equality issue.
"It would be so helpful if we

could change things at the state
level and do it as a comprehen-
sive plan because I feel it's just
an issue this country has stuck its
head in the sand about forever,"
Coleman said. "And it's not right."
Hanlon said that while admin-
istrators are interested in the
issue of tuition equality, it is
important to note that the UC
system is empowered by the state
of California to grant a generous
level of financial aid.
Still, the University's Coali-
tion for Tuition Equality hopes
to make the University a leader in
implementing tuition equality in
the state, according to LSA junior
John D'Adamo, a spokesperson
for CTE.
D'Adamo noted that the Uni-
versity's Mission Statement
includes a commitment to diver-
sity. He believes the University
should resolve the issue of tuition
equality to adhere to that and
other values.
"There is a clear block to diver-
sity, and it is something that we
believe, as an organization, is
wrong," he said. "It's a civil rights
issue. We believe that these stu-
dents who have fought, bled, cried
and lived for the majority of their
lives in Michigan deserve a fight-
ing chance."
D'Adamo said that CTE is also
working with representatives in
the state legislature on the issue,

but declined to disclose who the
group has worked with or the
details of their discussions.
A task force that includes Uni-
versity attorney Donica Varner,
Senior Vice Provost Lester Monts,
LSA senior Luz Meza LSA senior
Yonah Lieberman and Public
Policy senior Kevin Mersol-Barg
- who is a Daily columnist - is
developing a report on tuition
equality to present to the Board,
possibly in February, D'Adamo
said.
D'Adamo said he hopes that
although the report will weigh
the pros and cons of tuition equal-
ity, he hopes it will provoke a
quick discussion among adminis-
trators in support of the cause.
"We have done what we need
to do, and now it's in the hands of
the administration and President
Coleman to make sure tuition
equality happens," D'Adamo said.
"They have the power."
CTE has also met with some
members of the Board of Regents.
D'Adamo said he hopes that new
Democratic Regents Mark Ber-
nstein and Shauna Diggs will
support the issue, which was
highlighted in Bernstein's cam-
paign last year.
D'Adamo said CTE may pres-
ent the report at the Feb. 21 Board
of Regents meeting, and remains
optimistic about having a timely
response from the Board.

legislative staff in order to pre-
vent the public and many mem-
bers of the press from entering.
"The case, filed on behalf of
a journalist, citizens, legislators
and unions, charges that gov-
ernment officials, in an unprec-
edented assault on democracy,
deprived the public of their right
to participate in the legislative
process," the group's statement
said.
. The suit asserts that barring
the public from entering the
chamber demonstrated a sus-
picious attempt to pass the bill
without public commentary.
Elmir assailed the lack of legis-
lative accountability during the
legislature's lame-duck session
as well as the law's provisions
that make it immune to a'state-
wide referendum.
An Ingham County circuit
judge ruled in December that
state police were within their
legal rights to lock down the
capitol. However, the judge did
say the constitution requires
that an effort be made to open
the Capitol as much as possible.
Kurt Weiss, a spokesperson
for Gov. Rick Snyder, declined to
comment on the filing of the suit.
"While we are not comment-
ing specifically on this pending
litigation, the governor believes
Michigan is on the right track
and that we will keep moving

forward by working together,"
Weiss said.
State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann
Arbor) said the actions taken to
prevent people from entering the
Capitol are "unprecedented."
"It raised some serious alarms
with anyone who cares about
democracy, openness and gov-
ernment," Irwin said. "The
strongest claims to the case
revolve around those concerns
... The Capitol has never been
locked down before in my life-
time until just last December."
Irwin added that it would be
difficult for the lawsuit to pass
through the courts because of
the current mix of judges. If
the case reached the Michigan
Supreme Court, it would face a
conservative majority.
"The courts are very rena-
scent, naturally, to get in the leg-
islature's way," Irwin said.
Irwin said the ,issue is too
politically divisive in nature to
be impartially considered by
judges.
"One of the reasons it's going
to be a challenge is this whole
issue is 100-percent political,"
Irwin said. "Even if you get in
there and find some good claims
... that (the actions) are really
anti-democratic and maybe even
illegal, it's going to be hard for
the judges to make that judg-
ment call on whether those
issues are important enough to
overturn the law because it (the
law) serves their interests."


as successful in the future as they
have been in the past," Mangan-
ello said.
Munson said the donation is
crucial to progressing the engi-
neering program, and hopes it
encourages further funding.
"This gift is a landmark for the
College of Engineering," Mun-
son said. "Our, hope is that this
unprecedented display of corpo-
rate, foundation and individual
commitment to a specific engi-
neering discipline will inspire
others in the Michigan engi-
neering community to consider
similar support for other depart-
ments."
Department chair Kon-Well
Wang, now the Tim Manganello-
BorgWarner mechanical engi-
neering department chair, said
that the generous donation will
generate funds to help carry out

important department initiatives
and achieve some of the depart-
ment's strategic goals planned for
the next few years.
"This gift will allow us to
explore new ideas that are high-
risk but also high-gain in research
and also in education," Wang
said. "It will give us an edge as
compared to our peers, enabling
mechanical engineering at Michi-
gan to make an even bigger and
broader impact in the near future
and generations to come."
Unsurprisingly, the Univer-
sity's MRacing team was also in
attendance-BorgWarner is their
main sponsor. This team works to
build a formula racecar and com-
pete with it ina collegiate motors-
port racing series.
Engineeringjunior Joe Martin,
MRacing's project manager, said
he credits much of the team's suc-

cess to BorgWarner's support.
"I'm happy to hear that Borg-
Warqer and Tim Manganello have
extended their generosity to the
mechanical engineering depart-
ment as a whole," Martin said.
At the end of the ceremony,
attendees learned that -Mangan-
ello didn't attend his graduation
from the College of Engineering
in 1972. In order to tie up these
loose ends, a small "graduation
ceremony" was re-enacted by
Dean Munson and Manganello,
both clad in the traditional yel-
low-tasseled engineering gradua-
tion caps.
Upon "re-graduating" the Uni-
versity's class of 1972, Munson
and Manganello concluded the
dual graduation and endowment
ceremony with a chest bump -
perhaps a true display of Univer-
sity-corporate relations.

"This was a wonderful oppor-
tunity to read my colleagues'
work," Cotera said. "It was really
focused on how women's studies
as a discipline can re-think the
way it represents women from
other places."
Cotera said transnational
feminist theory is mainly about
proactivity - training graduate
students to become professors
who can relate the concept back
to the next generation of under-
graduates.
"It's basically about interven-
tions, from organizing knowl-
edge, training everyone from

professors to undergraduates, in
terms of thinking not just from a
U.S. centered perspective trying
to diversify our perspective as
opposed to constantly speaking
from this implied center about
other women and their own ways
of understanding feminism,"
Cotera said.
While the lecture was set with
a more scholarly angle in mind,
some professors encouraged their
undergraduate studentsto attend.
LSA freshmen Jessica Eisma
and Lauren Trulik said that they
decided to attend to learn about
the material in tandem with their
Filipino culture class.

"We didn't really know what
transnational feminism was until
now," Eisma said. "We're actually
here for our Filipino culture class;
we thought it would be interest-
ing."
"Even though it's an Ameri-
can culture class, our teacher is
also a women's studies professor.
She encouraged us to go," Trulik
said.
Both agreed that their under-
standing of transnational
feminism had improved after
attending the discussion, though
they wouldn't have known about
it without the recommendation
from their professor.

Depression conference to' e held

Farming village
unexpected
location of shrine
MEXICO CITY (AP) -
Archaeologists say they have
turned up about 150 skulls of
human sacrifice victims in a field
in central Mexico, one of the first
times that such a large accumu-
lation of severed heads has been
found outside of a major pyramid
or temple complex in Mexico.
Experts are puzzled by the
unexpected find of such a large
number ofskulls at what appears
to have been a small, unremark-
able shrine. The heads were
carefully deposited in rows or
in small mounds, mostly facing
east toward the risingsun, some-
time between 660 and 860 A.D.,
a period when the nearby city-
state of Teotihuacan had already
declined but the Aztec empire,
founded in 1325, was still centu-
ries in the future.
Georgia State University
archaeologist Christopher
Morehart, who found the skulls
last year in Xaltocan, a farming
village just north of Mexico City,
said that between 150 and 200
adultskulls or their equivalent in
bone parts have been excavated
so far from fields that stand on a
former lake bed.
Experts weren't expecting to
find anything of this kind in the
flat, undistinguished pasture
land and corn fields. The site is
near, but not immediately adja-
cent to, Teotihuacan, one of the
biggest pre-Hispanic cities. It
reached its height between 100
B.C. and A.D. 750 and was aban-
doned by the time the Aztecs
arrived in the areain the 1300s.
Morehart was conducting
a study of ancient agricultural
patterns and human landscape
uses in the northern part of the
Mexico Valley in 2007, when
during a walking survey of the
site he started noticing looters'
pits that had turned up human
bones. A subsequent season of
excavations in 2012 turned up
dozens more skulls. The results
of the 2007 dig were just pub-
lished in the academic journal
Latin American Antiquity.
While the Teotihuacan cul-
ture and the Aztecs were known
to practice human sacrifice, and
remains of hundreds of victims
have been found in their pyra-
mids or other large structures,
the Xaltocan mound "is like a
bump in the landscape that you
could really easily walk over and
not know you're standing on it,"
Morehart said.

"The interesting question is,
why are we seeing this kind of
sacrificial act that we often asso-
ciate with something like Teoti-
huacan or a big center. Why do
we see this ... ina place that's not
associated with these cities?"
Physical anthropologist Abi-
gaill Meza Penaloza of the Insti-
tute of Anthropology at Mexico's
National University said her
team was still cleaning and
assembling the skulls, but have
a confirmed count of about 130
skulls so far, all of which appear
to be of adult males.
Meza Penaloza said it was the
first find of its kind, both because
of the location - a small, artifi-
cial mound built in the middle
of an agricultural field - and
the kind of decapitations carried
out there. She said mass sacri-
fices had been documented at
temple inaugurations of temple
closings, but not in the middle of
fields.
She said it was also unusual
in thatthe skulls appear tocome
fromavaried population, includ-
ing people who practiced cranial
deformation and others who did
not, as opposed to more homog-
enous groups of sacrifice victims
found in the past.
The skulls were also found
with a shorter length of verte-
brae attached to the skulls than
is the case of other such finds,
suggesting the decapitation cut
was made closer to the base of
the skull.
Still other strange details
emerged: Morehart said some of
the skulls were found with finger
bones inserted into the eye sock-
ets. "It was common enough that
it was intentionally placed there
in the eye socket," Morehart
said, though the ritual signifi-
cance of that remains unclear.
Arizona State University Dr.
Michael E. Smith, who was-not
involved in the project, said "this
is certainly an impressive and
very puzzling find," adding, "I
am not aware of any other finds
ofmass burialsor mass sacrifices
outside of major settlements."
The key to the placement
might be the natural springs
that provided fresh, clean water
in an area dominated by shal-
low, brackish lakes. The springs
existed for centuries until they
were covered and tapped by
pipes around the 1950s. The
ancient inhabitants of Xaltocan
apparently used those springs to
water lakebed farm plots. Carv-
ings associated with the water-
god Tlaloc and corn and chile
plants were found at the excava-
tion site, suggesting it may have
been an agricultural shrine.

11th-annual event
to focus on
'healthy self-care'
By LIANA ROSENBLOOM
Daily StaffReporter
Students and staff from col-
leges and universities throughout
the nation will come together in
Ann Arbor at the end of Febru-
ary to gain and share knowledge
about managing depression on
college campuses.
The 11th Annual Depression
on College Campuses conference
will be held on Feb. 26 and 27,
with a special focus on "healthy
self-care."
Trish Meyer, program direc-
tor for outreach education for the
University Depression Center, is
one of the primary organizers of
the conference. She said the goal
of this year's conference is to help
students manage symptoms of
depression on a daily basis in a
healthy way. There will be a series

of speakers, panel discussions and
workshops over the course of the
two-day conference.
"We're not talking about that
students should be able to take
care of this by themselves but in
conjunction with professional
treatment ... there are lots of
strategies they can use, includ-
ing exercise, better sleep, journ-
aling ... that are healthy self-care
strategies, as opposed to the more
unhealthy self-care strategies
such as drinking or drug use,"
Meyer said.
Meyer said the stress of a col-
lege environment can bring
symptoms of depression to the
forefront.
"Given all of the otherstressors
that are unique to a college set-
ting, including lack of sleep and
perhaps alcohol and substance
abuse, it sort of creates the per-
fect storm for people who have a
vulnerability to developing these
illnesses when they might first
experience it," Meyer said.
Increasing early diagnosis is a
positive development and is help-

ing many people with mental
health disorders reachtheir goals,
one of which may be going to col-
lege.As aresult, college campuses
need to be more aware of how to
provide resources to these stu-
dents, Meyer said.
The conference is set apart by
its multi-disciplinary structure,
bringing experts from multiple
fields and all community mem-
bers are welcome.
Meyer said organizing such
a large conference has been a
rewarding experience.
"So often, on big campus like
U of M, everybody's in their little
area and they do their thing,"
Meyer said. "But the opportunity
to kind of collaborate and con-
nect across campus with people
all working toward the same goal
is also really valuable, and often
leads to new collaborations."
John Greden, the executive
director of the University's Com-
prehensive Depression Center,
is one of three co-chairs of the
conference planning committee.
He too stressed the importance of

conversation about depression on
campuses.
"We're dealing with illnesses
that affect one in every six peo-
ple in the country," Greden said.
"What we're emphasizing this
year is the identification of strat-
egies for students and counselors
and parents and everybody else
to pick up on that really help the
situation rather than send it back-
wards. I think that's what the
terms self-care and self-manage-
ment mean."
Greden said the conference
began when the Board of Regents
approved the formation of a cam-
pus Depression Center. Shortly
thereafter, there was a student
suicide on campus. He said this
event sparked the desire to hold
a conference to learn and teach
how to best handle depression in
a college setting.
Greden said the first confer-
ence attracted attendees from
nearly 50 campuses nationwide.
Eleven years later, he said he
hopes the conference is still mak-
ing a difference.

Syria promises revenge for
Israeli airstrike this week

Airstrike targeted
a convoy of anti-
aircraft weapons
bound for Hezbollah
BEIRUT (AP) - Syria threat-
ened Thursday to retaliate for
an Israeli airstrike and its ally
Iran said the Jewish state will
regret the attack.
Syria sent a letter to the U.N.
Secretary-General stressing the
country's "right to defend itself,
its territory and sovereignty"
and holding Israel and its sup-
porters accountable.
"Israel and those who protect
it at the Security Council are
fully responsible for the reper-
cussions of this aggression," the
letter from Syria's Foreign Min-
istry said.
U.S. officials said Israel
launched a rare airstrike inside
Syria on Wednesday targeting
a convoy carrying anti-aircraft
weapons bound for Hezbollah,

the powerful Lebanese militant
group allied with Syria and Iran.
In Israel, a lawmaker close to
hard-line Prime Minister Benja-
min Netanyahu stopped short of
confirming involvement in the
strike. But he hinted that Israel
could carry out similar missions
in the future.
The attack has inflamed
regional tensions already run-
ninghighover Syria's22-month-
old civil war.
Israeli leaders in the days
leading up to the airstrike had
publicly expressed concern that
Syrian President Bashar Assad
may be losing his grip on the
country and its arsenal of con-
ventional and nonconventional
weapons.
The Syrian military denied
there was any such weapons
convoy. It said low-flying Israeli
jets crossed into the country
over the Israeli-occupied Golan
Heights and bombed a scientific
research center. The facilityis in
the area of Jamraya, northwest
of Damascus. and about 15 kilo-

meters (10 miles) from the Leba-
nese border.
A U.S. official said the air-
strike targeted trucks contain-
ing sophisticated Russian-made
SA-17 anti-aircraft missiles. The
trucks were next to the military
research facility identified by
the Syrians, and the strike hit
both the trucks and the facility,
said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity because
he was not authorized to speak
about the operation.
If the SA-17s were to have
reached Hezbollah, they would
have greatly inhibited the Israe-
li air force's ability to operate in
Lebanon, where Israel has flown
frequent sorties in recent years.
1 Maj. Gen. Abdul-Aziz Jassem
al-Shallal, who in December
became one of the most senior
Syrian army officers to defect,
told The Associated Press by
telephone from Turkey that the
targeted site is a "major and
well-known" center to develop
weapons called the Scientific
Research Center.

14 dead, more than
100 wounded in
massive blast
MEXICO CITY (AP) - An
explosion at the office headquar-
ters of Mexico's state-owned oil
company in the capital killed
14 people and injured 100 on
Thursday as it heavily damaged
three floors of a building, send-
ing hundreds into the streets
and a large plume of smoke over
the skyline.
Another 30 people were
reported trapped in the debris
late Thursday, as soldiers with
rescue dogs, trucks with mount-
ed lights and a Pemex crane were
brought in to extract victims.
The Interior Ministry said it was
uncertain of the exact number
of people trapped because many
were outside having lunch when
the explosion occurred about
3:45 p.m. local time in abasement
parking garage next to the iconic,
51-story tower ofPetroleos Mexi-
canos, or Pemex, one of the tallest
buildings in Mexico City.
"It was an explosion, a shock,
the lights went out and sud-
denly there was a lot of debris,"
employee Cristian Obele told
Milenio television, adding that
he had been injured in the leg.
"Co-workers helped us get out of
the building."
President Enrique Pena Nieto
said authorities have not yet
found out what caused the blast
in the 14-story building in a busy
commercial and residential area.
Pemex first said ithad evacuated
the building because of a prob-
lem with the electrical system.
The company later tweeted that
the Attornhy General's Office
was investigating the explosion
and any reports of a cause were
speculation.
Ana Vargas Palacio was dis-
traught as she searched for her

missing husband, Daniel Garcia
Garcia, 36, who works in the
building where the explosion
occurred. She said she last talk-
ed to him a couple hours earlier.
"I called his phone many
times, but a young man
answered and told me he found
the phone in the debris," Vargas
said. The two have an 11-year-
old daughter. His mother, Gloria
Garcia Castaneda, collapsed on
a friend's arm, crying "My son.
My son."
The tower, where several
thousand people work, was
evacuated following the blast
but not damaged, according to
Gabriela Espinoza, 50, a Pemex
secretary for 29 years who was
on the second floor when the
explosion next door occurred.
"Therewas averyloud roar. It
was veryugly," she said.
Espinoza's co-worker, Tomas
Rivera, 32, worked on the ground
floor and was knocked to floor,
fracturing his wristand jaw.
Hundreds of firefighters,
military in camouflage and Red
Cross ' workers hauled large
chunks of concrete and looked
for victims late into the night,
with at least four bodies pulled
out of the rubble, according to an
Associated Press reporter at the
scene.
The exploded building was
intact on the outside but filled
inside with debris.
Television images showed
people being evacuated in office
chairs, and on gurneys. Most of
them had injuries likely caused
by falling debris.
"We were talking and all of
sudden -we heard an explosion
with white smoke and glass fall-
ing from the windows," said
Maria Concepcion Andrade,
42, who lives on the same block
as the Pemex building. "Peo-
ple started running from the
building covered in dust. A lot
of pieces were flying."

Iran vows to accelerate
nuclear enrichment plan

Nation has defied
U.N. demands to
dismantle program
VIENNA (AP) - In a defiant
move ahead of nuclear talks,
Iran has announced plans to
vastly increase its pace of ura-
nium enrichment, which can
make both reactor fuel and the
fissile core of warheads. Eager
to avoid scuttling those negoti-
ations, world powers are keep-
ing their response low-key.
Iran told the Internation-
al Atomic Energy Agency of
its intentions last week, and
the IAEA informed member
nations in an internal note seen
by The Associated Press on
Thursday.
The brief note quoted Iran as
saying new-generation IR2m
"centrifuge machines ...will
be used" to populate a new
"unit" - a technical term for an
assembly that can consist of as
many as 3,132 centrifuges.
It gave no timeframe. A
senior diplomat familiar with
the issue said work had not
started, adding that it would
take weeks, if not months, to
have the new machines run-
ning once technicians started
putting them in. He demanded
anonymity because he was not
authorized to divulge confiden-
tial information.
Mark Fitzpatrick, a non-pro-
liferation expert and former
senior official at the U.S. State
Department, described the
planned upgrade as a potential
"game-changer."
"If thousands of the more
efficient machines are intro-
duced, the timeline for being
able to produce a weapon's
worth of fissile material will
significantly shorten," said
Fitzpatrick, of the Internation-
al Institute for 'Strategic Stud-
ies.
"This won't change the sev-
eral months it would take to
make actual weapons out of the
fissile material or the two years
or more that it would take tobe
able to mount a. nuclear war-
head on a missile, so there is no

need to start beating the war
drums," he said. "But it will
certainly escalate concerns."
The planned upgrade could
burden international efforts
to coax Tehran into scaling
back its nuclear activities and
cooperating with the agency's
attempts to investigate its
suspicions of secret weapons
work. Talks are tentatively set
for next month with a date and
venue still open.
Iran insists it does not want
nuclear arms and argues it has
a right to enrich uranium for,
a civilian nuclear power pro-
gram. But suspicion persists
that the real aim is nuclear
weapons. The Islamic Repub-
lic hid much of its nuclear
program until it was revealed
from the outside more than a
decade ago. A deadlock in the
IAEA's probe of Iran's nuclear
program has furthered suspi-
cions of a clandestine pursuit
of atomic weapons.
Defying U.N. Security Coun-
cil demands that it halt ura-
nium enrichment, Iran has
instead expanded it. Experts
say Tehran already has enough
enriched uranium to be able
to turn it into weapons-grade
material for several nuclear
weapons.
The Iranian plan was con-
demned by Israel, which sees
Iran's nuclear program as an
existential threat and has said
it would use all means to stop
it from reaching weapons capa-
bility.
"While the world is discuss-
ing where and when the next
meeting with Iran will be, Iran
is rapidly advancing towards
obtaining a nuclear bomb," said
a senior official from Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanya-
hu's office. "The international
community cannot allow Iran
to arm itself with a nuclear
weapon."
The official demanded ano-
nymity because he said he was
not allowed to comment pub-
licly on the issue.
Phone calls seeking com-
ment from Ali Asghar Solta-
nieh, Iran's chief IAEA
delegate, went to his voicemail.

Clif fJette/AP
Assistant United States Attorney Peter Deegan speaks to the media during a press conference to discuss the sentencing
of Peregrine Financial Group owner and Chief Executive Officer Russell R. Wasendorf, Sr.
Broker faces life Iln prison for
stealing $215 million ini owa

Lived luxuriously
for years before
facing inquiry
CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (AP)
- For years, Russ Wasendorf Sr.
enjoyed the perks of being a suc-
cessful businessman: a corporate
jet, a fancy swimming pool at his
mansion, an extensive wine col-
lection and top chefs who made
him meals at the restaurant and
office buildings he owned.
Then lastsummer he admitted
that his lavish lifestyle was a lie,
built with money he stole from
customers at Peregrine Financial
Group, the Cedar Falls-based
brokerage he founded. Prosecu-
tors said he took $215 million
over 20 years inthe biggest fraud
in Iowa history.
Wasendorf is now being held
in isolation at a county jail in a
tiny cell where he sleeps on a
concrete pad without a pillow,
his pastor said. And on Thurs-
day, the 64-year-old learned he
will most likely spend the rest of
his life in federal prison.
A judge sentenced Wasendorf
to 50 years in prison. Wasend-
orf, who must serve at least 421/2
years of the sentence, appeared
in fragile health, having lost
weight and suffering from health

problems that made him look
nothing like the image of a confi-
dent financial whiz he once pro-
jected.
Acting U.S. Attorney Sean
Berry said the sentence was the
longest ever given to a white-
collar criminal in the northern
district of Iowa and was fitting
because Wasendorf's fraud was
unparalleled in Iowa.
"This is a justsentence for a
con man," he said at a news con-
ference.
U.S. District Judge Linda
Reade gave Wasendorf the maxi-
mum prison sentence available
for the fraud and embezzlement
charges to which he pleaded
guilty in September. She cited
the "staggering losses" his theft
caused to 13,000 commodities
investors who lost money and
hundreds of employees who lost
jobs.
Wasendorf used their money
to build a business empire that
included a publishing company
that churned out his books and
magazines, the jet that flew him
to meetings, the nicest restau-
rant in Cedar Falls, a develop-
ment company in Romania, and
a charity known for donations to
universities and hospitals.
But since last July, Wasendorf
has been held in a cell on the fifth
floor of the Linn County Jail in

Cedar Rapids, where some of his
fellow inmates scream all night
long, said pastor Linda Livings-
ton, who counsels him several
times a week. She said he has not
had access to writing or eating
utensils and is kept away from
other inmates.
"He has made an adjustment
to an impossible circumstance
with a grace that has surprised
me,' she said. "It's a stark exis-
tence."
Wasendorf's brokerage, nick-
named PFGBest, collapsed after
investigators found Wasend-
orf unconscious after having
attempted suicide in his vehicle
outside its headquarters in Cedar
Falls. He left a suicide note in
which he confessed to a fraud in
which he stole customer funds,
and forged bank statements to
fool his'colleagues, auditors and
regulators.
He attempted suicide after
learning that regulators were
insisting on electronic access
to Peregrine's bank accounts,
which meant they would soon
find that more than $215 million
in customer funds was missing.
Prosecutors said Wasendorf's
theft started after he founded
Peregrine in the early 1990s,
when he needed money to prop
up the business after an investor
pulled out.

It's a genre that inspires musical
creativity and innovation decade
after decade, but pop is a moth to
aflame forsellouts - lestweforget
pop is an abbreviation for popular.
Let's take a look at three artists
who have recently contributed
most to slandering the name of pop
music by transforming it into an
uninvolved, oversimplified genre.
Taylor Swift
It seemed as though Tay-
lor Swift was set to be the next
Michelle Branch - a 16-year-old
songwriting prodigy who would
crank out three quality albums,
filled to the brim with hits, then
settle in for an early retirement. If
only.
Swift's sincerity, intricacy and
success of Speak Now left fans
more than content as they watched
their girl Taylor grow up. But with
the release of her follow-up album,
Red, fans instead got The Curious
Case of Taylor Swift - the story of
a girl whose music and maturity
ages backwards.
After the release of "We Are
Never Ever (Going to Grow Up)"
and "I Knew You Were (Going to
Sellout)," Taylor Synth had been
lost to the dark side. Electronic
production might be new for you,
Taylor, but it's the same as every-
body else's hits. Insert obligatory
"she's also working with hit-maker
Max Martin" comment.

Katy Perry
Katy Perry: Part of Me 3D was
a major eye opener into Perry's
musical background, for the 15
Americans that witnessed the
film.
In short, the movie is a history
of how Perry went from being
a female rock singer striving to
become the next Alynis Moris-
sette, to becoming a chart-top-
ping, pure-pop artist, all centered
around the theme of staying true
toyourselfas an artist. Right.
Let's look at One of the Boys.
Based on "One of the Boys," "I
Kissed a Girl," "Ur So Gay" and
"Waking Up in Vegas," it seemed
edgy, and she wrote half of the
album herself with only a few
songs by Max Martin and Dr.
Luke. Perry looked like a pop-
rocker who actually had some
artistry.
Let's look at Teenage Dream.
No songs written by Perry, nearly
every song written by Dr. Luke
and Max Martin (also execu-
tive producers of the album), and
barely ahintofrock. Perrydoesn't
hesitate to claim that she wrote all
of the album's tracks, however.
On top of that, every single is
remixed until it becomes a No. 1
song. "The (Number) One That
Got Away" was remixed three
times in desperation to become
her sixth No. 1 single from the
album. It didn't appen.
Upon hearing that Dr. Luke
was undergoing a contract nego-
tiation to work strictly with art-
ists signed to a Sony record label
- not her Capitol record deal
- Perry threw together every
unreleased Dr. Luke song she
had, in preparation for an album
re-release Teenage Dream: The
Complete Desperation.
Included inthis re-release was
the single "Part of Me," a song
disguised to be in context with
her divorce, even though a demo
of the song leaked two years
before her divorce.
Days after Lady Gaga
announced that underground
producer-DJ "Zedd" would be
producing her 2013 album ART-
POP, Katy Perry announced that
Zedd would also be producing
her new record - a "darker"
album titled Darkest of Nights,
a try-hard contrast to Teenage
Dream. Don't hurtyourself, Katy.

loses
Show gets lost in
complicated sire
bond fiasco
By KAYLA UPADHYAYA
ManagingArts Editor
Unless you're dealing with a
one-season wonder, every series,
at some point, hits its slump.
Even the near-
perfect "Friday
Night Lights"
had the Sea- The Vampire
son That ShallD
Not Be Named
(known more Season Four
commonly as Midseason
season two).
Everything Thursdaysat8p.m.
went to shit CW
when Connor
came to "Angel"
in its third season, and even
though it eventually bounced
back, his entrance marks a very
dark time for the series. Who
could ever forget the rogue cou-
gar that forever lingers in our
memories of "24," a seemingly
small detail that nonetheless
dragged the entire season into
stupidity. Every show, eventually,
has its cougar. "The Vampire Dia-
ries" 's cougar? A little magical
blemish called the sire bond.
The end of season three
spurred a complete course
change for "Vampire Diaries," as
Elena (Nina Dobrev) transformed
from the show's central human -
and therefore its moral ground-
ing - into the very thing she
never wanted to be. Becoming a
vampire changed Elena, and the
first several episodes of season
four probe these changes, show-
ing more sides of the character
than we've ever seen before. Her
transformation draws her closer
to Damon (Ian Somerhalder),
who isn't as hell-bent on making
her human again as boyfriend
Stefan (Paul Wesley) is. So Elena
makes the emotionally mature
decision to leave Stefan.
As it turns out, these changes
are mostly just a byproduct of
some stupid sire bond that gives

takes

Elena a creepy, unshakeable
desire to please Damon.
Siring is by no means a new
concept to vamp lore: Fans of
"Buffy" and "Angel" will recall
the quasi-familial, quasi-psy-
chosexual bond forged between
turners and their turnees. It
was an essential component of
Whedonverse mythology, the
link that kept Angelus, Spike,
Darla and Drusilla connected
through centuries.
But in Mystic Falls, the sire
bond doesn't get its first mention
until Klaus and his hybrids show
up, and even then, siring in rela-
tion to vampires emerges out of
nowhere like an uninvited guest.
It's a hackneyed plot attempt
intended to shift the gears on the
ongoing Elena-Stefan-Damon
love triangle that over-occupies
this season's narrative.
Though it has no shortage of
strong female characters, "Vam-
pire Diaries" has always struggled
with Elena. As a human in the
middle of a world of supers, she
sometimes slipped into distressed
damsel debility. In the past, Ele-
na's agency was important to both
the series and to Stefan: Last sea-
son, Stefan's decision to save Matt
first at her insistence ultimately
distinguishes him from Damon,
who wouldn't have hesitated to
save Elena first, even if she asked
him not to. But the sire bond, even
with all the asterisks the writers.
throw after it (it only manifests if
the siree had feelings for the sirer
before the transformation, appar-
ently), threatens the very agency
that makes Elena more than just
someone who needs to be saved.
Despite its current slump, the
season hasn't been a complete
failure. Standout episodes like
"Memorial," a classic TVD tear-
jerker that's as moving as it is
thrilling, and "We All Go A Little
Mad Sometimes," which dips into
the horror genre with wonder-
fully wicked success, reinforce
that the show hasn't entirely lost
itself yet. And the hunt for the
fabled vampire cure so central to
the season's arc works well, as it
affects each and every one of the
characters in the ever-growing


Mystic Falls web, in different and
compelling ways.
But even with these upsides, it
seems that showrunner Julie Plec
has forgotten where the series's
strengths rest. Loyalty and love
have always transcended blood-
lines for these characters, but the
Mystic Falls family is in shambles.
The once beautiful friendship
between Elena, Caroline (Candice
Accola) and Bonnie (Kat Graham)
is nowhere to beseen. When Car-
oline reacts negatively to Elena's
budding romance with Damon,
she's painted as petty - Elena
even goes so far as to slutshame
her for having eagerly slept with
Damon back when he was just the
smirking, mysterious new guy to
town.
Elena acting so out-of-charac-
ter is its own problem, but do Plec
and Co. really think we've collec-
tivelyforgotten abouthowDamon
sexually and physically abused
Caroline in season one? None of
the characters think to mention it,
and the show therefore dismisses
an important aspect of its past,
rejecting the careful character
work behind Caroline. It's unfair
to the character and to Accola,
who so far hasn't been given many
opportunities this season to flex
those immensely powerful acting
muscles we've seenherrock inthe
past.
News of a backdoor pilot for
a Plec-produced TVD spinoff
called "The Originals" couldn't
have come at a better time.
While the arrival of Klaus and
his family of thousand-year-
old baddies propelled "Vampire
Diaries" through some of its best
story work, their complicated
mythology has almost become
too big for Mystic Falls. Perhaps
taking them out of the equation
will be just what "Vampire Dia-
ries" needs to get back to basics.
At the very least, let's hope it
allows Katherine (also played
by Dobrev, in an amazing feat of
duality) to fall back into the fold.
Though Rebekah (Claire Holt)
makes for a fine supremely evil
queen of the undead, life with-
out Katerina Petrova is far too
boring and whiskeyless.

My best friend came out as a
country fan four months ago.
It was an unplanned confes-
sion, pulled only from her lips
after a series of unplanned cir-
cumstances and events. If Sarah
had it her way, I probably never
would've found out at all - the
secret would have stayed buried
in her iTunes library and stoplight
singing sessions for years to come.
But luck had its way that night,
and the veil of secrecy she'd
always worn didn't stand a chance
against it. Sarah was picking me
up for a party and, by multiple
twists of fate, I didn't take as long
to get ready as I normally do: less
traffic on the way home from the
gym, reheating leftovers instead
of cooking, setting out my outfit
earlier in the day. It was a series
of small shortcuts that shaved
about 10 minutes off my going-out
prep time - Sarah was expecting
to wait 15-20 minutes, but for the
first time in our friendship, I was
ready to go in five.
And it was dark - darker than
a typical moonlit night in August,
and too dark for her to see the
outline of my body advancing
down the driveway to her car. She
had no idea I was coming, and by
the time I opened the door and
climbed inside, it was already too
late. She had no time, no warn-
ing, no opportunity to switch the
radio station before Luke Bryan's
"Country Girls" flooded my ear
canals.

country right now?"

It's 5 a.m. in the morning
and your alarm clock has just
snatched away an exquisite
dream. You attempt to open your
eyes, but all you see is gauzy
darkness. For a few seconds, you
manage to convince yourself
that your wakefulness is a mis-
take, and therefore, you simply
go back to sleep. But then, you
roll over and your eyes fall on
the zippered suitcase that you
placed by your bed before get-
ting under the covers. You yawn
loudly and let outa sleepy groan:
You're going to the airport.
Outside in the cold, you wait
soberly before the orange glare
of a streetlight for your taxi to
arrive. The taxi is late. Once
you're on your way to the air-
port, the taxi driver gets lost.
Now you're nervous because

Another defensive struggle and Big
Ten road loss for the Wolverines

By GLENN MILLER JR.
Daily Sports Writer
This was a game the Michigan
women's basketball team needed,
yet played like it didn't even want.
After dropping two of its last
-three Big Ten matchups, the Wol-
verines can't blame Thursday
night's loss to Minnesota on a
short week. They also can't claim
they lost at the hands of a superior
Golden Gopher team.
When all the excuses are put
aside, this game stung a little
extra.
Michigan (5-3 Big Ten, 16-5
overall) allowed a season-high 82
points and turned the ball over 12
times in Minneapolis. Sophomore
guard Rachel Banham dominat-
ed the game for Minnesota (3-5,
14-8), finishing with a career-high
31 points. The Golden Gophers,
who entered the game ranked
eighth in the Big Ten, abused the
Wolverines' paper-thin defense
and routed Michigan, 82-67.
Three players finished in dou-
ble-digits for Michigan, includ-
ing senior guard Kate Thompson,
who led the offense with 18
points.
If there is a silver lining in
the loss' to Minnesota, it may be
Thompson's 5-for-8 shooting
performance from beyond the
arc, where she has undoubtedly
struggled in the past few games.
Senior forward Rachel Sheffer
nearly completed another double-
double, adding 17,points and nine
rebounds.
But it wasn't the Wolverines'
offense that failed to show up.
Rather, it was a lackluster defen-
sive performance that allowed
the Golden Gophers to control
the game throughout. Michigan
gave up a season-high 43 points
in the first half, despite allow-
ing 51.2 points per game entering

the evening. Minnesota shot an
impressive 59.3 percent from the
floor, while finding relative ease
scoring the ball within the paint.
Banham was sensational,
shooting 6-of-8 from 3-point
range while slicing her way
through the Wolverines' back-
court. Two other Golden Gophers
finished in double digits, includ-
ing junior forward Micaella Riche
and redshirt freshman Kayla
Hirt. Riche and Hirt contributed
15 and 10 points, respectively.
Minnesota got off to a hot start,
hitting five of its first seven shots
to start the game. Thompson's
shooting kept Michigan within
the game, but it could not slow

down Banham's production.
After allowing 11 points off of
seven turnovers in the first half,
the Wolverines found themselves
trailing, 43-39, heading into the
-break.
Michigan again started in
a 2-3 zone to begin the second
half, but the defense was simply
ineffective. The Golden Gophers
took advantage of the sluggish
pace, continually fending off the
Wolverines' attempt to grab the
lead. After a 7-0 run that brought
Michigan within a point, Minne-
sota responded with its own-7-0
run, putting an end to the Wol-
verines' hopes.
While they didn't win the war,

Michigan did win two battles in
the game. The Wolverines scored
18 bench points, 10 of which came
from freshman guard Madison
Ristovski. After shooting 4-of-5
from the field, Ristovski tallied a
career high in points. Michigan
also bested the Golden Gophers
on the boards, where the Wolver-
ines grabbed 29 rebounds.
The schedule doesn't get any
easier for Michigan, as it heads to
East Lansing on Monday to face a
hungry Spartan squad. With all
the excuses of last week put aside,
the Wolverines now have yet
another opportunity to get back
on track against their conference
rival.

Sugiyama leading No. 3 Michigan

By SIMON KAUFMAN
Daily Sports Writer
Michigan has a top-ranked
team competing at the. Crisler
Center led by a sophomore having
a standout season - and it's not
the men's basketball team.
The No. 3 women's gymnastic
team and sophomore Sachi Sugi-
yama are quietly gaining a reputa-
tion as an elite team in the NCAA.
The Wolverines (2-1 Big Ten,
6-1 overall) are off to a stellar
start,featuringtremendous depth
overall and a group of athletes
that seems to enjoy nothing more
thanthe thrill of competition.
Among them is Sugiyama, who
is having a sophomore year that
might be bigger than her home
state. The native of Keller, Texas
turned heads last year when she
captured the Big Ten title on the
vault, second place on the uneven
bars and was named to the All-Big
Ten Championship Team.
She's on pace to do it again this
year.
"I haven't changed anything
specifically," Sugiyama said. "The
routines have stayed the same
from last year, but (I've) defi-
nicely just (been) working on the
details." -
And the details have been pay-
ing off, particularly on the floor
exercise, where Sugiyama is tied
for 13th in the nation, averaging a
9.888 mark.

the uneven bars title twice this

She also found herself atop the
podium for her floor exercise at
the Cancun Classic (9.900) and
for her performance on the vault
versus Minnesota (9.950).
"She's much more of a veteran

she receives from her teammates.

done a good job dealing with the
personal pressure and the pres-

"We're definitely excited about

Swimmers to battle against OSU

By ISIAH KNIGHT
For the Daily
Any time a Michigan team
faces Ohio State, intensity is sure
to be at its peak. When the two
swimming and diving teams,
both ranked in the top 10, face off
this weekend, it will be no differ-
ent.
On Friday and Saturday at
Canham Natatorium, the top-
ranked Wolverines (4-0 Big Ten,
6-0 overall) will take on the 10th-
ranked Buckeyes (1-1 , 8-1) in a
two-day dual meet.
Despite the excitement of the
rivalry and the idea of putting

the team's undefeated record
on the line, senior Miguel Ortiz,
reigning Big Ten Swimmer of the
Week, is taking it all in stride.
"We're pretty confident about
this weekend," Ortiz said. "We've
been training hard. I mean it is
Ohio State, but we've been trying
hard every meet, so I don't think
there's any difference."
While they are taking the sea-
son one meet at a time, Ortiz and
the Wolverines are also looking
forward to the future. They hope
to remain unbeaten and carry
that momentum late into the sea-
son.
"We're trying to win Big Tens

and use that as a stepping stone to
the NCAAs," Ortiz said. "We're
definitely trying to get the cham-
pionship title this year. We have
a really good team with a lot of
depth, so I'm really excited."
Historically, Michigan boasts
an all-time record of 64-11-2
against the Buckeyes and hasn't
lost to its rivals in more than 20
years.
. But with a fierce rivalry and
two powerhouse programs com-
peting, these types of records
rarely mean much once the meet
begins.
While the upcoming contest
between the Wolverines and

Ohio; State is important to all
the members of the swimming &
diving team, it'll be particularly
special for the athletes that have
spent the past four years suiting
up for the maize and blue. This
weekend's matchup will involve
the team's senior swimmers hon-
ored before the meet.
"We have a class motto of
'Those who stay will be champi-
ons', and the present seniors have
definitely been following that
motto throughout the four years
we've been here," Ortiz said.
"I'm just excited to see all of the
seniors line up in front of every-
one and be recognized."

Michigan
coach John Beilein even said on
Tuesday that the only reason he
knew the Hoosiers game was
approaching was because he had
to approve the flight schedule.
But after the top-ranked Wol-
verines blew past the Wildcats,
68-46, and Indiana rolled through
Purdue hours later, the prize-
fight between two of the nation's
top-three teams is set for Satur-
day night, where Bloomington's
esteemed Assembly Hall will
serve as center stage.
"It's going to be crazy," said
sophomore point guard Trey
Burke. "A lot of guys have us as
underdogs in this game. Indiana
being No. 1 coming into the sea-
son, it's kind of like we're playing
the No.1 team in our minds."
The game, full of both NCAA
Tournament seeding and Big Ten
championship implications, is
likely the biggest regular-season
matchup in any Michigan sport
since the second-ranked Wolver-
ine football team fell to No. 1 Ohio
State in 2006. It's perhaps Michi-
gan's most momentous regular-
season basketball contest since
the fourth-ranked Wolverines
lost, 93-92, at No. 1 Indiana on
Feb. 14, 1993. This year's meeting
will replace that one as the high-
est-ranked matchup in Assembly
Hall's 42-year existence.
And if No. 1 vs. No. 3 wasn't big
enough, ESPN's College GameDay
crew will be broadcasting live
from Assembly Hall on Saturday
morning and in the hour leading
up to the 9 p.m. tip-off. Unlike
football's version of GameDay,
where show producers select the
biggest game of the weekend just
a week in advance, this game was
picked months ago, but obviously
turned out to be the right selec-
tion. Since GameDay visited Ann
Arbor last year, a new analyst -
Fab Five member Jalen Rose - has
been added to the set, adding yet
another storyline to the build-up
for the game.
Three of Michigan's freshmen
- point guard Spike Albrecht and
forwards Glenn Robinson III and
Mitch McGary - hail from the
Hoosier state, making the game
all the more meaningful.
"I just can't wait to play in
there," Robinson said. "I can't
even imagine what it's going to be
like."
But with all the build-up sur-
rounding the game, the Wolver-
ines (7-1 Big Ten, 20-1 overall)
need to be wary of duplicating
the result of their only loss of the
season, which came on the road in
Columbus. Inthat game, Michigan
fell behind by 21 before its come-
back effort fell short. The deficit
was largely due, as Beilein likes to

say, to the Wolverines' attempts to
hit home runs, or in other words,
trying to do too much.
"That's something we've got-
ten better at over the last cou-
ple weeks," Burke said. "Coach
