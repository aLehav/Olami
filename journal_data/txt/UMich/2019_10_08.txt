Ann Arbor City Council 
had 
its 
first 
October 
meeting 
this 
Monday, 
discussing issues such as 
a Packard Road rezoning 
ordinance and marijuana 
legislation. 
The meeting began with 
a proclamation from Ann 
Arbor Mayor Christopher 
Taylor and Ann Arbor 
Fire Chief Mike Kennedy 
to kick off Fire Prevention 
Week. The Ann Arbor 
Fire 
Department 
and 
the 
National 
Fire 
Protection 
Association 
are 
collaborating 
to 
promote 
the 
national 
2019 campaign, with an 
emphasis 
on 
ensuring 
smoke 
detectors 
are 
functioning 
and 
practicing 
fire 
safety 
plans.
Lisa 
Jackson, 
vice 
chair of the Independent 
Community 
Police 
Oversight 
Commission, 
then 
spoke 
on 
the 
progress 
of 
the 
commission, 
created 
last March after citizens 
expressed concern over 

the transparency of the 
selection 
process. 
The 
2014 shooting and death 
of Aura Rosser by an 
Ann Arbor police officer 
highlighted the need of 
the commission and City 
Council 
unanimously 
passed 
a 
resolution 
to 
establish 
to 
police 
oversight 
board 
in 
October 2018. 
Jackson described the 
commission’s 
primary 
vision 
to 
foster 
a 
transparent and mutually 
beneficial 
relationship 
between the Ann Arbor 
Police Department and 
the 
community. 
She 
described the numerous 
trainings undertaken by 
the police department and 
encouraged individuals to 
file complaints through 
the committee. Jackson 
said they are optimistic to 
work with newly sworn in 
Police Chief Michael Cox. 
“Transparency 
is 
at 
the heart of earning and 
growing 
that 
trust,” 
Jackson said. “We want to 
hear feedback, we want to 
get criticism and we want 
to learn.” 

The University of Michigan 
held its 2019 Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion summit on Monday 
to discuss the importance of 
embracing DEI on campus and in 
the broader community. The event 
featured remarks from University 
President Mark Schlissel and Van 
Jones, CEO of REFORM Alliance, 
political commentator and host of 
The Redemption Project and The 
Van Jones Show on CNN. The event 
took place at Hill Auditorium and 

drew a crowd of more than 1,000 
community members. 
The 
summit 
began 
with 
Chief Diversity Officer Robert 
Sellers welcoming the crowd and 
describing the University’s DEI 
goals. Sellers had a message for 
those who criticize DEI initiatives 
for focusing only on marginalized 
identities: that’s the point, he said. 
“DEI is often criticized, and 
it’s often criticized based on the 
belief that DEI efforts are only 
about designating resources and 
attention to benefit some specific 
particular people to the exclusion 

of other people,” Sellers said. “And 
those particular people are the 
individuals who have traditionally 
been 
underrepresented 
or 
marginalized 
or 
considered 
a 
minority. I’m here to tell you this 
morning that when it comes to 
the University of Michigan DEI 
plan, 
they’re 
absolutely 
right. 
Our plan focuses on a myriad of 
forms of diversity and commits to 
provide attention and resources 
to 
those 
who 
hold 
identities 
within these forms of adversity 
that 
have 
traditionally 
been 
underrepresented, 
marginalized, 

under acknowledged.”
Sellers then discussed 
how 
people have multiple identities, 
and how most people have been 
marginalized at some point in their 
lives. This is an advantage and a way 
for people to find common ground 
and create solutions, he said. 
“The DEI is a benefit to all of us, 
and thus is relevant to all of us,” 
Sellers said. “We all hold identities 
in which we are privileged as well 
as identities in which we have 
traditionally been marginalized or 
underrepresented.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Wallace House, a University 
of 
Michigan 
organization 
that sponsors fellowships for 
journalists and hosts events 
recognizing 
journalists’ 
work, held a panel event 
Monday 
night 
discussing 
the importance of returning 
American 
hostages 
home 
safely. 
The 
event 
centered 
around the story of freelance 

journalist 
James 
Foley, 
who was captured in Syria 
Thanksgiving Day 2012 by 
terrorist 
group 
ISIS 
and 
held for two years until he 
was killed in 2014. Diane 
Foley, 
his 
mother 
and 
founder of the James W. 
Foley 
Legacy 
Foundation, 
and Joel Simon, executive 
director of the Committee 
to Protect Journalists, were 
the panelists. The event was 
moderated by Margaux Ewen, 
the executive director of the 

Foley Legacy Foundation. 
Lynette 
Clemetson, 
director of the Wallace House, 
began the event by discussing 
President 
Trump’s 
recent 
decision to withdraw troops 
from Syria. She told the 
audience Diane Foley would be 
reading a statement from the 
foundation about the Trump 
administration’s decision. 
“This 
decision 
sends 
a 
message that those who take 
our citizens hostage will not 
face American justice,” Foley 

said. “We implore President 
Trump to hold these ISIS 
fighters accountable for their 
barbaric human rights crimes 
against our citizens and to 
protect our country against 
the spread of terror, should 
they escape.” 
Before beginning the panel’s 
conversation, 
they 
played 
the trailer for a documentary 
produced by the foundation: 
“Jim: The James Foley Story.”

U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, 
D-Mich., led a town hall at 
the 
Wyandotte 
Boat 
Club 
to 
address 
the 
public’s 
environmental 
concerns 
on 
Monday 
evening. 
The 
event featured a panel of ten 
speakers, including state Sen. 
Stephanie Chang, state Rep. 
Cara Clemente, spokespersons 
from Friends of the Rouge, 
Clean Water Action and other 
members of environmentally 
oriented 
organizations. 
Around 100 audience members 
from the community attended, 
including a group of student 
volunteers representing the 
Sunrise Movement. 
The event began with a 
welcome from Dingell, who 
thanked 
the 
Wyandotte 
Boat Club for hosting. After 
a reminder for the audience 
to remain civil, the panel 
opened the conversation up for 
questions. The first questions 
concerned the preservation and 
protection of Michigan’s waters 
and 
ecosystems, 
specifically 
regarding clean water and the 
prominence of invasive species.

Provost Philbert talks Regents 
bylaws changes at SACUA meeting 

Official highlights art initiative, working group to adjust laws on tenured faculty dismissal 

Provost Martin Philbert 
joined the Senate Advisory 
Committee on University 
Affairs 
to 
discuss 
the 
creation of a faculty group 
to recommend amendments 
to policies on the dismissal 
of tenured faculty, as well as 
President Mark Schlissel’s 
new arts initiative. 
Philbert said the faculty 
group 
will 
review 
two 
Regents’ Bylaws, 5.09 and 
5.10, that involve dismissal 
procedures and severance 
pay. The group, comprised 
of faculty from all three 
campuses, will recommend 
revisions to the policies in 
light of recent controversies 
involving 
tenured 

professors. 
According 
to 
the University Record, the 
group 
will 
recommend 
revisions by Feb. 28, 2020. 
The University began the 
process of firing tenured 
School of Music, Theatre 
& Dance professor David 
Daniels in July. Daniels 
has been on paid leave 
since August 2018 when 
baritone 
singer 
Samuel 
Schultz 
accused 
Daniels 
and his husband of sexually 
assaulting him in 2010. In 
January, Daniels and his 
husband were charged with 
second-degree 
criminal 
sexual 
misconduct. 
The 
case is still ongoing. 
The 
Daily’s 
reporting 
revealed 
the 
University 
awarded tenure to Daniels 
in May 2018, despite the 

Office 
of 
Institutional 
Equity learning of alleged 
sexual 
misconduct 
in 
March 2018. 
Philbert emphasized the 
bylaws’ importance in terms 
of 
protecting 
academic 
freedom and employment, 
but 
said 
revisions 
are 
needed to prevent against 
faculty wrongdoing. 
“The 
Regents, 
the 
President, 
myself, 
the 
EOs, [and] all the way 
through the faculty are 
dedicated to the idea that 
the fundamental tenets of 
5.09 not be threatened,” 
Philbert 
said. 
“That 
academic freedom, freedom 
of 
thought, 
freedom 
of 
expression are enshrined 
and remain so forever ... 
We have to be very careful 
and thoughtful, and 
quickly 
amend 
the 
bylaws 
to 
protect 
tenure and to protect 
our 
faculty 
and 
to 
protect society from 
the bad behavior that 
is frequently in the 
headlines.”
The 
other 
part 
of 
the 
meeting 
involved 
Schlissel’s 
arts 
initiative. 
The 
initiative 
was 
introduced 
by 
Schlissel in the 2019 
Leadership Breakfast 
and is about bringing 
the 
humanities 
into 
STEM-related majors 
through 
means 
of 
creative and inclusive 
processes. 
Philbert reflected on 
his own experience as 
a musician and why he 
believes it is important 
to incorporate these 
ideas into STEM fields.
“One of the things 
I 
hope 
that 
we 
avoid, that President 
Schlissel 
said 
in 

his 
leadership 
breakfast 
remarks, is that we don’t 
simply view the arts as an 
instrument,” Philbert said. 
“We don’t look at the benefit 
of the arts and medicine, 
or the utility of the arts in 
becoming a better engineer, 
but that they actually take 
a life of their own. That we 
understand that the arts 
themselves have value in 
being able to explore those 
things that are difficult to 
explore. ”
SACUA Assembly Chair 
Joy 
Beatty, 
associate 
professor of management 
studies, 
introduced 
the 
first motion of creating 
an e-voting system for the 
Senate 
Assembly. 
There 
was heavy debate about 
using Qualtrics or Canvas 
to implement an e-voting 
system. The motion was 
withdrawn 
with 
the 
conclusion that they would 
use a test trial of BlueJeans, 
a 
video 
conferencing 
website, 
at 
the 
Senate 
Assembly on Oct. 21.
SACUA 
and 
Senate 
Assembly 
member 
Ivo 
Dinov, 
professor 
of 
computational 
medicine 
and 
bioinformatics, 
expressed 
his 
concern 
about using Qualtrics as the 
e-voting system.
“Qualtrics is a very silly,” 
Dinov says, “So we have 
to be careful with this … 
If we go with something 
or recently screwed up, I 
guarantee you there won’t 
be anything like this in the 
next two decades, because 
they’ll be fingers pointing 
to the failure case … And 
we should all try to weigh 
in, what are the pros and 
what are the cons because 
there will become potential 
of going to something like 
this.”

JASMIN LEE
Daily Staff Reporter 


Additionally, more than 
15 community members 
spoke against the 2857 
Packard Road Planned Unit 
Development 
rezoning 
ordinance, a conditional 
zoning 
agreement 
introduced in 2016. The 
zoning would shift eight 
acres of property along 
Packard road from R1C 
single-family 
residential 
to R1E, a single-family 
residential zoning which 
allows for greater density. 
The 
developer 
is 
Jim 
Haeussler of Saline-based 
Peters Building Company 
and the construction costs 
estimated at $2.6 million. 
The 
community 
members 
cited 
several 
reasons to discontinue the 
council’s support of the 
ordinance. According to 
these members, the area is 
one of the last affordable 
neighborhoods 
in 
Ann 
Arbor and subsequently 
has a diverse population. 
Members 
in 
and 
out 
of Ward 3 argued for 
environmental 
and 
historical 
preservation 
of the neighborhood and 
brought 
forth 
concerns 
over traffic congestion if 
the development were to 

be pursued. 
Community 
member 
Emily Epstein moved to 
the area several years ago 
and urged the committee 
members to reconsider the 
proposal. 
“I 
find 
it 
difficult 
to believe that elected 
servants would have such 
a poor command of current 
economic conditions, and 
your 
interrelationships 
its specific demographic 
groups, like the soon to 
be refugee middle class,” 
Epstein said. “These are 
not 
starter 
homes, 
or 
starter households. These 
homes 
house 
real 
and 
noble people. The vast 
number of retirees that 
live in my neighborhood 
will be pushed out as 
property taxes rise with 
absurd 
housing 
costs 
under this proposed PUD.” 
Councilmember 
Ali 
Ramlawi, 
D-Ward 
5, 
expressed his hesitation 
in moving forward with 
the site plan during the 
second readings of the 
ordinances. 
“The 
PUD 
should 
provide public benefit, and 
I frankly don’t see a lot of 
it,” Ramlawi said. “When 
you have 80 percent of 
area residents petitioning 
against it, that just speaks 
volumes.” 

On 
the 
other 
hand, 
Councilmember 
Julie 
Grand, D-Ward 3, said 
since the council moved 
to push the plan forward 
in the past, they must 
continue. 
Grand 
and 
Councilmember 
Zachary 
Ackerman, 
D-Ward 
3, 
expressed concern over 
the 
land 
owner 
clear-
cutting 
the 
trees 
in 
the 
area 
without 
the 
development. 

“I think it would be 
dishonest of me to ask 
for it, and then reject it,” 
Grand said. “Even though 
I understand that there’s 
a lot of really good intent 
behind wanting to keep 
the things you love about 
your neighborhood. I don’t 

think this plan, in terms of 
housing type, is actually a 
horrible plan.”
The official ordinance 
to pass the amendments 
of the plan needed eight 
votes to pass, but only 
six 
members 
voted 
in 
favor 
of 
it. 
Because 
of 
its 
contingency 
on 
the 
first 
ordinance 
passing, councilmembers 
unanimously 
voted 
against the site plan. 
The 
council 
also 
discussed the city code 
of Ann Arbor in regards 
to 
marijuana 
retailers, 
microbusinesses 
and 
designated 
marijuana 
consumption 
facilities. 
Councilmember 
Jane 
Lumm, I-Ward 2, pushed 
for 
an 
amendment 
to 
limit 
the 
proximity 
of 
marijuana businesses to 
schools 
and 
child-care 
buildings. 
“It’s not a matter of 
if marijuana is coming, 
but 
exactly 
when 
and 
under what set of specific 
regulations,” Lumm said.
Councilmembers 
later 
voted unanimously on a 
resolution 
proposed 
by 
Lumm to establish a body 
to 
review 
and 
oversee 
responsible 
marijuana 
use. 

Ewen 
first 
asked 
Foley 
about her decision to start 
the foundation after James’ 
death in 2014. Foley explained 
she 
was 
inspired 
by 
the 
government’s 
inaction 
and 
wanted her family to do 
something in his honor. She 
also commented on what has 
happened in the five years 
since 
the 
foundation 
was 
started. 
“After Jim was executed, 
I was angry, I was really 
outraged,” Foley said. “I really 
felt 
that 
our 
government 
had deceived our family and 
totally abandoned us. It just 
seemed like we had to do 
something. Here we are five 
years later and no one has 
been held accountable for 
Jim’s death, really, and the 
challenge continues.” 
The 
panelists 
also 
discussed how U.S. policy 
differs from that of European 
countries; the United States’ 
does 
not 
negotiate 
with 
terrorist 
organizations, 
whereas other countries may. 
Many of the journalists held 
with James Foley were from 
these countries and were 
eventually released by ISIS, 
as a result, Simon said.
“U.S. 
policy 
historically 
has been that the U.S. does 
not negotiate with terrorists, 
does not make concessions to 
terrorists,” Simon said. “Many 
of the other countries around 
the world look at the issue 
much 
more 
pragmatically. 
French 
hostages 
survive, 
about 75 percent of the time. 
Spain has the best record in 
the world, everyone of them 
has come home. There’s a 
25 percent survival rate for 
American hostages.”
Simon acknowledged the 
issue is difficult to solve, 
but emphasized he believes 
there are things the United 
States can learn from the 

policy and actions of other 
countries when negotiating 
for hostages. 
“I think the one thing the 
Euorpeans have done well, 
where the Americans have 
really failed, is no American 
citizen 
should 
feel 
alone, 
without the support of the 
government, when they are 
going 
through 
something 
like this,” Simon said. “I 
mean, that is cruel to leave 
families to grapple with these 
… not only does the American 
government not support them, 
but they are threatening to 
put the families in jail for 
seeking the return of their 
loved ones.” 
LSA 
sophomore 
Natalie 
White, who is interested in 
journalism but did not attend 
the event, commented on how 
she would expect the U.S. 
government to react when 
journalists 
are 
captured 
abroad. 
“Journalism 
allows 
information to spread from 
source 
to 
people, 
which 
sounds incredibly basic, but 
is truly so important,” White 
said in a statement to The 
Daily. “Journalism is what 
connects all the classes and 
what allows all people to 
have access to knowledge of 
what is going on in the world 
around them.” 
At the end of the event, 
audience 
members 
were 
able to ask questions of the 
panelists, 
both 
through 
question cards and Twitter. 
The first question asked 
dealt 
with 
whether 
the 
panelists believe Americans 
fare worse in captivity than 
people from other countries, 
as well as how governments 
paying 
ransoms 
impact 
journalists who are still being 
held. 
“I mean we are hated in 
the world, especially at this 
moment in time,” Foley said. 
“Westerners 
are 
targeted 
anyway, because of various 
western 
coalitions. 
But 

absolutely. I think once they 
found out Jim was American 
he had one of the worst 
treatments of any of the 
hostages.” 
To 
conclude 
the 
event, 
the panelists discussed how 
journalism has been affected 
by the Trump administration, 
as well as how journalists are 
treated abroad.
 
“The 
Trump 
Administration really assisted 
the 
Saudi 
government 
in 
covering 
up 
that 
crime, 
it’s reprehensible and that 
really sends a message to 
enemies of journalists and 
enemies of journalism and 
those who want to persecute 
journalists that there will be 
no consequences in terms of 
their relationship with the 
United States,” Simon said.
White 
also 
explained 
how she believes the Trump 
administration’s 
rhetoric 
regarding journalists affects 
their safety. 
“I think that the president 
telling the general public that 
any group is a threat risks 
that group’s safety,” White 
said. “I think that journalists 
often have to be more aware 
now of their situations and 
surroundings, 
especially 
when 
interviewing 
groups 
that may see them as a threat.” 
Foley reiterated her belief 
that students should continue 
pursuing journalism, despite 
job insecurity, criticism from 
the public and possible safety 
risks. 
“I would encourage them, 
(being a journalist) would be 
a very noble task,” Foley said. 
“But also be honest. It’s hard 
to make a living and it can be 
risky. So if (students) want 
to be journalists, they need 
to become highly skilled at 
protecting themselves. But 
I think it’s so important — 
we need them. It’s critical, 
journalists are so important. 
Without them we wouldn’t be 
free.” 

This is not to say that all forms 
of privilege and marginalization 
are the same, but it does mean 
that we all have some common 
experiences that we can access.”
Schlissel then took the stage to 
express his pride in the University 
progress towards achieving more 
diversity, equity and inclusion. He 
said DEI goals are integral to the 
University’s values and mission. 
“Our achievements thus far are 
a direct result of so many members 
of our community joining together 
to not only advance our values, but 
to live them,” Schlissel said. “To 
share them broadly and instill 
them in all parts of our mission as 
a public university. This includes 
thousands of people, faculty, staff, 
students and supporters, past and 
present, who care deeply about 
our University… at the University 
of Michigan, diversity, equity and 
inclusion are values inseparable 
from our excellence in research, 
education and service.”
Keynote speaker Van Jones 
began 
his 
speech 
with 
the 
assertion that being able to work 
collaboratively with people from 
all 
different 
backgrounds 
is 
integral to success. 
“The main point is this: I don’t 
care if you’re Black, White, Latina, 
Latino, Asian-American, Native-
American, I don’t care what 
faith you are, I don’t care what 
gender, 
expression, 
sexuality 
you are,” Jones said. “In this new 
century, the absolute prerequisite 
superpower for success is how do 
you perform in a radically diverse 
environment. That will determine 
your success or your failure in this 
new century.”
Jones remarked on the different 
consequences 
marginalized 
people face versus privileged 
people for illegal activities, using 
the example of his time as a 
student at Yale Law School. He 
said he saw other Yale students 
breaking more rules than people 
in housing projects, but he noted 
how the people of color and the 

poorer people from the housing 
projects are the ones that ended 
up with a criminal record. 
“We have this false view of 
reality. I saw more drugs used at 
Yale University than I ever saw in 
a housing project, period,” Jones 
said. “I saw more rule-breaking, 
I saw more norm breaking, I saw 
way worse behavior at Yale than 
I ever saw in a housing project. 
And yet, when those kids got in 
trouble at Yale, nobody called the 
cops. At best, they went to rehab, 
or Europe… But four blocks away, 
in the housing projects in New 
Haven, Connecticut, four Black 
kids doing fewer drugs, selling 
fewer drugs with less money 
almost all went to prison in the 
‘90s. And they came back 10 
years later, 15 years later, 20 years 
later. Now they’re drug felons. 
And those same Yale students 
in positions of power say ‘Well, 
I can’t hire these people, they’re 
drug felons.’”
In 2018, President Donald 
Trump signed into effect the First 
Step Act, which is a bipartisan bill 
aiming to prepare incarcerated 
people 
for 
re-entrance 
into 
society, encourage earlier release 
dates and place emphasis on 
rehabilitation 
in 
the 
prison 
system, according to FirstStepAct.
org. Jones helped pass the act 
and claimed it passed because of 
bipartisan work in Congress.
“When you have this many 
people behind bars, you offend 
the core sensibilities and the 
core values of both political 
parties,” Jones said. “At our best, 
progressives 
and 
democrats 
believe in something called justice, 
we don’t like it when majority 
groups run over minority groups. 
At their best, conservatives care 
about something called liberty, 
individual 
rights, 
individual 
dignity and limited government. 
Well, the incarceration industry is 
running over the concept of justice 
and liberty… You’ve got to learn 
how to work across ideological 
lines, racial lines, to get something 
done.”
Jones 
concluded 
his 
address by discussing how the 

University’s DEI initiatives can 
prepare 
students 
to 
succeed 
after graduating and can help 
the world by creating solutions 
through collaboration in a diverse 
environment. 
“We’re developing a capacity 
for people to at least work across 
difference, 
to 
recognize 
the 
battleground and deal with that 
effectively, but never lose sight of 
the common ground and be able 
to deal with that effectively too,” 
Jones said. “And if this University 
community is going to be able to 
have the impact it needs to have, 
central to the mission has to be 
this idea of diversity, equity and 
inclusion.”
In a panel discussion after 
Jones’ speech, LSA senior Dim 
Mang addressed how emotionally 
draining it can be to be a student 
activist and leader working on 
DEI. 
“Something to keep in mind, 
especially 
from 
a 
student 
perspective, is how much of a 
burden this work is for us, for 
people of color,” Mang said. “I’m 
a first-generation college student 
here, first-generation immigrant 
as well. And I think that a lot of 
my peers, especially in groups like 
the Arab Student Association, La 
Casa and the Black Student Union 
is that along with our school 
work, along with our personal 
relationships with family and 
friends, continuously coming in 
day in and day out, putting in this 
work trying to be representatives 
of our community is a toll and it’s 
taxing and its draining.”
Jones responded by saying 
Mang is right — it is emotionally 
taxing. It’s not fair that she and 
other student leaders have this 
burden to bear, but it will make 
them and the community stronger 
in the long run, he said.
“As tragic as it’s going to be to 
say,” Jones said. “As hurtful as it’s 
going to be to say, by you doing 
extra, just like when you go to the 
gym, and someone says ‘you have 
to pick up the 200 pounds and I’m 
going to pick up the 100 pounds.’ 
That’s not fair, but you’re going to 
be stronger tomorrow.”

During 
the 
event, 
Bagenstos talked about the 
LGBTQ+ workers’ rights 
cases that will be heard in 
front of the Supreme Court 
on Tuesday. He also gave 
a brief history of LGBTQ+ 
workers’ rights in America 
and 
discussed 
what 
arguments can be expected 
to be heard at the hearings.
The three cases being 
presented to the Supreme 
Court tomorrow all involve 
people 
who 
were 
fired 
from their jobs after their 
employers learned of their 
sexualities: a case where a 
skydiving instructor told 
a client he was gay; a case 
where 
a 
social 
worker 

in Georgia joined a gay 
softball league; and lastly 
a case in Michigan about 
a transgender woman who 
wrote 
to 
her 
employer 
about her transition.
“Because there is such 
widespread discirmination 
against gay, lesbian and 
transgender 
individuals 
in 
the 
workplaces… 
in 
recent 
years 
a 
number 
of 
individuals, 
lawyers 
and activists have sought 
to 
use 
pre-existing 
sex 
discrimination 
laws 
to 
challenge 
this 
kind 
of 
discrimination,” Bagenstos 
said. 
Bagenstos then gave a 
brief history of the pre-
existing sex discrimination 
law, 
Title 
VII 
within 
the 
1964 
Civil 
Rights 
Act, 
that 
prohibits 
racial 
discimination 

in 
employment 
and 
also 
prohibits 
sex 
discrimination 
in 
employment.
“Title 
VII 
wasn’t 
something 
that 
(government 
officials) 
were going to take very 
seriously 
in 
enforcing,” 
Bagenstos said. “It took 
a lot of work by feminists 
acitivists 
and 
litigators 
over the next several years 
to get the government to 
take 
that 
seriously 
and 
eventually by the late ‘60s, 
early ‘70s the EOC and the 
Supreme Court and the 
lower federal courts began 
to take sex discrimination 
really seriously and you see 
all sorts of major changes 
in 
sex 
discrimination 
litigation.”
After giving this brief 
history, Bagenstos opened 

the room up to questions 
regarding Tuesday’s cases. 
One 
audience 
member 
asked about the impact the 
outcomes of Tuesday’s case 
will have on the LGBTQ+ 
community. 
“What’s at stake here is 
something that is dramatic 
in terms of its effect on 
individuals 
in 
terms 
of 
saying, look, you have to not 
have the sexual orientation 
you have or you have to not 
have the gender identity 
you have if you want to 
keep your job,” Bagenstos 
said. “There’s a lot at stake 
in these court cases.” 
Public Policy graduate 
student 
Kate 
Bell, 
an 
organizer 
of 
the 
event, 
spoke to The Daily about 
the relevance of this policy 
talk in light of the pending 
LGBTQ+ cases.

“As 
mentioned, 
Michigan is one of the 
states that currently does 
not offer protections in 
the workplace for LGBT 
individuals and so this is 
something that will directly 
affect our members who 
choose to remain in this 
state,” Bell stated. 
Another 
Public 
Policy 
graduate student, Monika 
Anderson, 
commented 
on 
how 
this 
policy 
talk 
broadened 
her 
understanding 
of 
the 
Supreme Court’s role in 
decisions on certain issues. 
“The politics of political 
appointees to the court can 
really shape what direction 
we 
take 
issues 
in 
this 
country,” Anderson said. 
“Despite what the general 
public of the country may 
think, or polling numbers 

may show, there’s a lot 
of 
power 
that 
Supreme 
Court holds, that might not 
necessarily always match 
what the country is.”
Kate 
Bell 
emphasized 
why this talk and other 
policy 
talks 
organized 
by Out in Public are so 
essential to students here 
at the University. 
“Especially at the Ford 
School, 
unless 
you’re 
specifically taking a class 
on labor, labor policy, you’re 
unlikely to hear things like 
this,” Bell said. “One of the 
main goals for Out in Public 
specifically was to have a 
space for queer identifying 
folks within our program to 
come and talk about things, 
but also a place to discuss 
policies that will directly 
impact our lives.”

E

very time I open my laptop 
to write, do homework or do 
anything productive, I am 
always faced with a difficult choice. 
Can I complete the task at hand, 
or will I get distracted by the likes 
of Twitter, Facebook, YouTube or 
Reddit? These sites, and others, are 
what I have deemed the “horsemen 
of the productivity apocalypse” 
simply because they are always 
there in the distance, ready to kill 
whatever productive momentum I 
have at any given moment. 
In all seriousness, social media 
has become a major problem in 
today’s day and age. Not simply just 
for issues of productivity but also 
for problems such as raising risks 
of anxiety and depression, massive 
privacy faults and the spread of 
disinformation, to name a few. Sites 
such as Facebook at one point were 
revered for their innovation and 
impressive growth; now people 
scorn them for selling off data and 
spreading misinformation. How 
have we come so far in such little 
time, and what is to be done?
These problems generated by 
social media are not by accident; 
in fact, they are quite by design. 
Depending on what kinds of people 
populate your feed, you may have 
heard of the term “the attention 
economy” before. The essential 
idea is that digital companies, such 
as Facebook and YouTube, are all 
competing for your time, i.e. your 
attention. Every minute you spend 
on their site generates revenue by 
way of selling ad space or tracking 
data to sell. Because social media 
platforms have a direct incentive to 
keep you on the site, one of their 
primary objectives is to design 
algorithms that accomplish just 
that. This is why we see features 
such as endless feeds instead 
of pages to click through, or 
constant notifications to draw 
us back in. However, these 
intentional design features have 
also brought more insidious 
consequences.

These 
types 
of 
algorithms 
are literal addiction machines. 
Every time we get a like, mention, 
comment or follow request, our 
brains get a quick shot of dopamine 
— 
the 
chemical 
responsible 
for 
sensations 
of 
pleasure. 
The problem is, over time, our 
dopamine receptors can build up 
a tolerance, and all of sudden we 
need more stimulus to reach the 
same “high” — this is the basic 
science of addiction. In a business 
model that values only attention 
and time, social media platforms 
want people addicted to their site 
so they log in more frequently and 
stay on longer. The consequences of 
operating this machine are serious.
A 2017 study published by the 
Journal of Affective Disorders 
found that “more time spent using 
social media was associated with 
greater symptoms of dispositional 
anxiety” in adults aged 18-22. 
It also found that more daily 
social media use was linked 
to greater odds of having an 
anxiety disorder. Furthermore, 
in another study published in the 
University of Chicago Journal 
of the Association for Consumer 
Research, 
smartphones 
may 
“impair 
cognitive 
performance 
by affecting the allocation of 
attentional resources, even when 
consumers successfully resist the 
urge to multitask, mind-wander, 
or otherwise (consciously) attend 
to their phones—that is, when their 
phones are merely present.”
In 
even 
more 
grave 
circumstances, 
sites 
such 
as 
YouTube have come under fire 
for promoting hateful or shocking 
content 
in 
the 
recommended 
sections as a way to keep users 
watching. YouTube has said this 
is a flaw in an ever-changing 
algorithm, but the logic is intuitive: 
People are curious and are more 
willing to click on shocking or 
controversial 
videos, 
which 
become more popular, and thus 
the algorithm shows it to more 

people. YouTube has an incentive 
to promote these videos, as our 
attention via watchtime translates 
to ad revenue for the platform.
To be fair, this type of attention 
based business model is not unique 
to modern times. In the past, 
newspapers would often print 
attention-grabbing 
front 
page 
headlines to increase sales. The 
birth of 24-hour cable news in the 
’80s also brought a flair for the 
dramatic to keep consumers from 
changing the channel. The main 
difference here is that these other 
examples didn’t follow people 
around wherever they went, and 
didn’t see the same negative effects 
that we are seeing now in such a 
magnitude. 
So how do we fix the problem? 
Personal choice and responsibility are 
ultimately important considerations. 
Meditation, scheduling no-screen 
times and setting other app limits 
are a great way to reduce the negative 
impacts of the attention economy. 
For me, deleting social apps from 
my smartphone in order to take 
away the temptation has proven 
to be an effective, albeit imperfect, 
way to combat the system. But as 
with any addictive substance, there 
needs to be greater accountability. 
Limiting features such as endless 
scrolling, pervasive notifications and 
demonetizing hateful or shocking 
content are all possible solutions that 
these companies ought to take to 
help curb the issue. 
Many of these design flaws 
result from an era of the internet 
that is now rapidly changing. We 
can no longer let an entire industry 
profit from products that cause 
addiction and anxiety. When many 
of these companies were founded, 
the internet was a brand new 
frontier without rules or precedent. 
It was a digital Wild West. But just 
like the Wild West of old, its time 
may be coming to an end.

Pay attention to the economy

TIMOTHY SPURLIN | COLUMN

H

ow often do you stop and 
evaluate what we, as 
University of Michigan 
students working to 
better 
the 
climate, 
are doing to create a 
space for marginalized 
communities, minority 
groups and people of 
color to share their 
truth? To an individual 
who 
fits 
within 
those categories, this 
isn’t 
a 
far-fetched 
question. Perhaps a 
better question would 
be: How often do your social 
identities pervade your thoughts 
or influence the work you do? Of 
these core identities, which ones 
affect you most often and which 
ones affect you least often?
For the sake of real-world 
application, 
let’s 
deconstruct 
these 
questions 
by 
using 
a 
nationwide 
issue: 
women’s 
health care. It’s truly ironic how 
women’s health care isn’t that at 
all, since women aren’t even the 
primary 
decision-makers. 
It’s 
more accurately described as the 
domain of elite policymakers, 
the majority of which do not 
hold an education rooted in 
public health or medicine yet 
make large-scale decisions for 
women about their bodies and 
their health. According to the 
American College of Healthcare 
Executives, less than 20 percent 
of executives in leadership at 
hospitals or public health systems 
are women. Paradoxically, this is 
a stark contrast to the 80 percent 
of mothers who are the primary 
health 
care 
decision-makers 
in their homes and for their 
families, as per U.S. Department 
of Labor data. One then wonders 
why men in higher places act 
entitled to controlling the health 
care policies set forth at the 
federal, state and local levels.
That 
being 
said, 
on 
the 
flip side, the Association of 
American 
Medical 
Colleges 
now report a female majority 
class profile and the percentage 
of female physicians is steadily 
on the rise as per a 2016 census 
study. It’s happening: Women 
are making cracks in the glass 
ceiling. However, the crux of the 
situation is that this is absolutely 
not the time for us to sit back and 
let this phase run its course as we, 
unfortunately, quite often have. 
I am exhausted and disturbed 
to see the continual “short-term 

memory loss” that the greater 
majority of millennial Americans 
actively choose to subscribe to, 
directly 
following 
every 
important 
catastrophic 
event. 
Women and health 
care 
have 
become 
collateral 
damage 
in 
the 
process. 
For 
example, 
the 
abortion restrictions 
received a lot of heat 
in early 2019 and the 
passionate 
voices 
that took a stance 
have since then quieted or 
subsided entirely. Why is it that 
especially when the social justice 
issues at hand are centered upon 
marginalized 
communities 
or 
minority groups, the problem is 
discussed nonstop for, say, two 
weeks while all of us post and 
share stories of it on Snapchat 
and Instagram? And why, at the 
moment it stops being “trendy,” 
is it all of a sudden like nothing 
happened? The only individuals 
who 
continue 
to 
remember 
cases like Trayvon Martin are 
the families and the African-
American community members 

that are affected by it.
I agree that there is a benefit 
to posting on your stories and 
spreading 
awareness, 
but 
I 
urge these posters to commit to 
educating themselves on the issue 
as a whole. Don’t post about the 
worsening environmental state 
of the Earth and then continue 
to use straws, print single-sided 
and waste water. Don’t post about 
female empowerment and then go 
talk negatively about the women 
in your own circle behind their 
backs. Don’t post about a global 
humanitarian crisis and then not 
take the initiative to seek out all 
other unbiased media and news 
articles. Remember when all your 
Instagram followers turned their 
Instagram profile pictures blue? 
Do you recall what that was for? 

It’s a sign of solidarity with the 
people of Sudan. But solidarity 
isn’t only applicable at certain 
points of the year. It’s a year-
round effort, day in and day 
out, 24/7 until justice for all is 
achieved. This isn’t to say that 
you’re not allowed to switch out 
your profile picture, but don’t 
halt the educational process 
happening behind the scenes.
The reality is this: currently, 
progress 
in 
women’s 
health 
care is driven by women who 
are 
advocating 
for 
fellow 
women. 
LGBTQ+ 
individuals 
are primarily involved in the 
fight for LGBTQ+ pride. We 
need to do better. We need to 
show up for each other. When 
a social justice issue arises or 
a humanitarian crisis is taking 
place halfway across the globe, 
that is an opportunity for you 
to selflessly be involved and 
support those around you. The 
change we need will not result 
from 
women 
advocating 
for 
themselves. Instead, it will result 
from a shift in perception such 
that all health care professionals, 
of all genders, recognize and 
respond to inequalities and lack 
of diversity in leadership roles and 
senior positions. Please note that 
this does not require you to be in 
a position to “solve” the problem. 
Instead, pursue options in which 
you help to create a safe space for 
that community to discuss the 
problem at hand. 
Recently, during an interview 
for the South Asian Awareness 
Network, 
a 
social 
justice 
organization 
at 
Michigan, 
I 
was asked to respond to the 
following question: “What does 
POC solidarity mean to you?” 
That’s when I started to see the 
University community in a more 
static state rather than a growth

Impeachment is risky but necessary
A

fter 
a 
whirlwind 
week 
in 
which 
records 
emerged 
that 
President 
Donald 
Trump pressured Ukrainian 
President 
Volodymyr 
Zelensky 
to 
investigate 
former Vice President Joe 
Biden, the leading Democratic 
presidential candidate, House 
Speaker Nancy Pelosi opened 
a formal impeachment inquiry 
against the president. Given 
the severity of this abuse of 
power, it seems likely that 
Trump will become the third 
president in U.S. history to 
be impeached. Impeachment 
will be divisive, politically 
risky and unlikely to lead 
to conviction in the Senate. 
Impeachment is also wholly 
justified 
and 
urgently 
needed.
Efforts to impeach Trump 
have swirled since the early 
months of his presidency, 
but never gained significant 
traction. Early impeachment 
votes in 2017 were deemed 
premature 
by 
Democratic 
leadership 
and 
easily 
defeated. In 2018, Trump 
was criminally implicated 
in lawyer Michael Cohen’s 
trial for breaking campaign 
finance laws, but was never 
charged 
due 
to 
existing 
Justice 
Department 
guidelines against indicting 
sitting presidents, and the 
matter was overshadowed by 
the impending release of the 
Mueller report. The report 
did not exonerate Trump, but 
failed to provide smoking-
gun 
proof 
of 
collusion 
or 
obstruction 
of 
justice 
as 
many 
had 
predicted, 
and 
public 
support 
for 
impeachment ebbed. 
Now, 
with 
this 
latest 
scandal, 
impeachment 
is 
fully 
warranted 
and 
critically needed to defend 
democratic 
rule 
of 
law. 
Trump’s closest allies have 
rushed to his defense, but 
make no mistake, the details 
of the scandal are absolutely 
damning. To recap: In May, 
Rudy 
Giuliani, 
Trump’s 
personal lawyer, planned to 
travel to Ukraine and meddle 
“in (the) investigation” against 
Biden’s son. Giuliani canceled 
his trip after backlash over 
the clear impropriety of his 
objectives. 
Giuliani 
later 
spoke to Ukrainian diplomats 
in Paris, but Ukraine found 
“no 
wrongdoing” 
after 
conducting the investigation.
On July 18, Trump delayed 
$400 
million 
worth 
of 
military 
aid 
to 
Ukraine, 
which is currently in a proxy 
war against Russia. On July 
25, Trump spoke with the 
Zelensky 
over 
the 
phone. 
A reconstructed record of 
the call shows that Trump 
told Zelensky the U.S. is 
“very good” to Ukraine, but 
said he “wouldn’t say that 
it’s 
reciprocal 
necessarily.” 
Zelensky then brought up 

military aid and a desire 
to 
“buy 
more 
Javelin 
(missiles),” to which Trump 
immediately 
responded, 
“I would like you to do us 
a 
favor 
though.” 
Trump 
went on to ask Zelensky to 
investigate “Crowdstrike” (a 
debunked conspiracy theory 
that Russia was not behind 
2016 election interference) 
and “look into” the Biden 
investigation. 
Zelensky 
promised 
to 
“look 
into 
the situation” and Trump 
responded that both Giuliani 
and 
Attorney 
General 
William Barr will be in 
touch.
In 
August, 
Giuliani 
met 
with 
Ukrainian 
officials 
again. 
On 
Aug. 
12, 
a 
whistleblower 
filed 
a 
complaint 
about 
the 
incident, detailing the call 
and an apparent effort by 
the White House to cover it 
up by hiding the records in 
a system reserved for ultra-
classified documents. The 
law requires whistleblower 
complaints to be reported 
to Congress, but both the 
White House and the Justice 
Department 
advised 
the 
Office of the Director of 
National Intelligence against 
releasing 
the 
complaint, 
and the complaint was not 
reported to Congress until 
Sept. 9 — almost a full 
month after the complaint 
was filed. That day, Trump 
lifted the hold on military 
aid, but the backlash was 
already 
growing 
and 
the 

impeachment 
inquiry 
was 
announced on Sept. 11.
Summarized 
briefly, 
Trump 
withheld 
military 
aid to Ukraine to pressure 
Ukraine’s 
president 
into 
investigating 
Biden, 
his 
potential 
2020 
opponent, 
and the White House then 
tried to bury the evidence. 
In other words, Trump used 
the powers of his office to 
attack a political rival and 
then further used his powers 
to cover it up. This is what 
dictators do. Trump’s actions 
constitute a clear threat to the 
integrity of our democratic 
institutions, 
and 
the 
impropriety of the situation 
cannot be overstated. 
Abuse of power was the 
second article of impeachment 
against 
President 
Richard 
Nixon. Experts say extortion, 

bribery, breaking campaign 
finance laws and obstruction 
of justice are among the 
crimes Trump and his aides 
may have committed during 
the 
affair. 
Impeachment 
is 
absolutely 
warranted 
in response to this latest 
scandal. 
Many 
of 
Trump’s 
defenders 
and 
some 
of 
his 
critics 
have 
pointed 
to the political impacts of 
impeachment as an argument 
against it. As the argument 
goes, the public is against 
impeachment, 
and 
some 
speculate the impeachment 
will backfire on Democrats 
in 2020. Public opinion on 
impeachment is malleable 
and will largely depend on 
how well each side sells their 
case, but there is plenty of 
evidence that the public will 
back impeachment.
Support for impeachment 
jumped 
dramatically 
after news of the Ukraine 
scandal broke. As of now, 
by a ten-point margin, a 
majority 
of 
Americans 
support the impeachment 
inquiry. Notably, support 
for 
impeachment 
is 
growing among Democrats, 
independents 
and 
Republicans. Furthermore, 
when 
pollsters 
ask 
whether it is appropriate 
for a president to ask a 
foreign 
government 
to 
investigate 
a 
political 
rival or withhold aid to 
a country for personally 
beneficial purposes, voters 
say no by a 30 and 48-point 
margin, respectively. These 
numbers 
show 
that 
the 
public 
overwhelmingly 
disapproves 
of 
what 
Trump did, and support for 
impeachment could quickly 
grow 
as 
more 
details 
emerge.
The 
chances 
that 
impeachment removes Trump 
from office are low but not 
zero. While many Republicans 
like Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, 
and 
Mike 
Braun, 
R-Ind., 
have 
rushed 
to 
Trump’s 
defense (while simultaneously 
admitting 
they 
haven’t 
even 
read 
the 
complaint), 
other 
Republicans 
have 
acknowledged 
the 
severity 
of the situation. Moreover, 
former Republican senator Jeff 
Flake, R-Ariz., speculated 35 
of his GOP colleagues would 
vote for impeachment if the 
vote were secret, suggesting 
that Republicans could be open 
to impeachment if the political 
winds shift. 
But even if impeachment is 
destined for acquittal in the 
Senate, Democrats have a duty 
to impeach. The Ukraine scandal 
reveals the president believes 
himself to be beyond reproach, 
acting with reckless disregard 
for the law.

’Tis the season for atonement, folks. If you have 
been a dedicated reader of this here column, which 
I am certain you are, you will know that I am a 
big fan of apologizing. I apologize for everything, 
from taking up space to Jeffrey Epstein. Maybe it’s 
my midwestern upbringing or my Jewish guilt or 
my genitals, but I am always apologizing for one 
thing or another. I apologize for men who make 
me feel uncomfortable. I apologize for making 
myself vulnerable. I apologize for being too loud, 
too goofy, too honest, too much. As women we are 
taught to say sorry before we know what we are 
apologizing for. We are trained from a young age 
that our existence is a burden, that our presence 
is annoying, that our words aren’t heard. But I am 
tired of saying sorry into the void. 
When I wrote a similar listicle to this one last 
year, in honor of Yom Kippur, it came from a place 
of hope that this year I wouldn’t second guess 
myself, I wouldn’t apologize when I didn’t need 
to, I wouldn’t say sorry for who I am. Ultimately, 
I think I failed my New Year’s resolution, because 
I am right where I was one year ago. I am writing 
with the same false confidence in the same coffee 
shop (Comet Coffee) at the same table (the one 
on the right closest to the counter), drinking the 
same drink (an oat milk latte), wearing the same 
T-shirt (a vintage tee featuring the season two cast 
of SNL), listening to the same songs (something by 
Mitski), thinking about the same damn things (I 
really need to stop biting my nails this year, I mean 
it). Some things never change. 
Sure, there are some apologies I really should 
make, like to my landlord for tearing out a chunk of 
my drywall trying to hang a “Frances Ha” poster 
and when I told you I couldn’t hang out because 
I was busy but actually I was just rewatching 
“Fleabag” for the seventh time. Still, I have made a 
tradition of taking the time and ink of The Daily to 
let everyone know what I won’t be atoning for this 
year. So here it is folks, my day of anti-atonement, 
my soliloquy of non-sorries, my listicle of laments, 
what I will not be atoning for this year: 
I will not atone for boasting my 500+ LinkedIn 
connections. It’s an accomplishment whether it 
gets me a job or not. 
I will not atone for writing listicles in replace 
of prose for my Daily Humor Column. It’s punchy 
and fun and I like it. 
I will not atone for paying actual, physical 
money to see the “Downton Abbey” movie when 

I could have just rewatched the show for free 
on PBS. It was the most calming movie-going 
experience I have ever had and the plumber was 
hot. 
I will not atone for going to career fair without a 
folder. Who even knew that was a thing? 
I will not atone for using mouthwash in my bed 
when I am too lazy to get up and brush my teeth.
I will not atone for listening to podcasts at the 
gym. 
I will not atone for telling people I am 5’7” when 
I am actually a tall 5’6”.
I will not atone for grinding my own coffee 
beans. It’s pretentious but it tastes better, OKAY?
I will not atone for my loud watch. I know it 
ticks and tocks, it’s a goddamn watch, Brenda. 
I will not atone for using a strand of my own 
hair to pick food out of my teeth when I don’t have 
floss on hand. Ask anyone with long hair, they do 
it too.
I will not atone for my Pinterest boards, of 
which there are many. 
I will not atone for using Google Maps to get 
home from the MLB. I have no sense of direction. 
I will not atone for not knowing what I’m doing 
after graduation. I have time to figure it out, Aunt 
Judy!
I will not atone for announcing when I go to 
the gym — “I’m going to the gym, everyone,” “If 
you need me, I’ll be at the gym,” “Just going to my 
happy place, the gym, I’m going to the GYM,” — 
because people should know that I am svelte and 
fit and swole. 
I will not atone for calling my mom between 
five and 15 times a day. She is a joy to talk to and 
I walk a lot.
I will not atone for wearing the same leggings 
I wore yesterday just inside out. It’s clean enough 
and I haven’t done laundry yet this month. 
I will not atone for listening to the “Succession” 
theme on repeat, it’s a banger. 
I will not atone for my Glossier addiction. I 
am just trying to be the Bratz-doll “Euphoria” 
influencer I know I can be. 
I will not atone for calling dress pants “slacks.”
I will not atone for dying my hair blonde and 
telling people it’s natural. Maybe she’s born 
with it, maybe it’s none of your business. 
There it is, dear reader, another year’s worth 
of not sorries, another 365 days of beg your 
pardons, 525,600 more minutes of excuse 
you. Let’s hope this year is one filled with less 
regret and more release, less apologizing 
and more actualizing, less concern and more 
confidence. 

I (still) am not sorry

HUMOR COLUMN

“Joker,” directed by Todd Phillips (“The Hangover”) follows 
an alternative origin story for the infamous DC Comics villain 
as he transforms from a downtrodden stand-up comedian to his 
more familiar persona, Gotham’s most vengeful maniac. 
The Joker (or Arthur Fleck, as we first meet him) is played 
by Joaquin Phoenix (“Her”) in another Joaquin Phoenix 
performance. In other words, he takes character acting to 
its extreme, presenting the villain with a dark electricity, 
a fierceness that hadn’t previously been captured by other 
renditions of the Joker. As in any of his roles, Phoenix goes all in 
here and totally carries the film. 
Unfortunately, despite Phoenix’s genuinely impressive 
dedication to the character, the narrative is dry and unnecessary. 
The concept of a Joker origin story could be compelling, though 
his usual role as the ideological counterpart to Batman’s rigid 
morality is entirely absent. Instead, what Phillips delivers is a 
hollow, static product of aggressive and threatened fantasies. 
There is no transition of ideas, no intellectual momentum — 
only a lonely man beaten by all of society to the point of bloody 
retaliation against the culprits. And according to Phillips, we are 
all to blame.
Many of the film’s early scenes that shame, embarrass and 
bludgeon Arthur plead for empathy from the audience. And 
admittedly, they work. In particular, Arthur has a condition that 
causes him to laugh in uncontrollable, random spasms. When 
these occur in public, he is physically unable to explain himself 
and is coldly demeaned by those around him. He even has a tiny 
laminated note explaining this tendency, and seeing the card’s 
grimy, creased edges is a reminder of how frequently he must 
have to pull it out on a given day. 
Phillips makes overt, breathless attempts at political 
commentary with regard to Arthur’s lack of agency in Gotham. 
The healthcare system is weak and unresponsive, a trash strike 
has left mounds and mounds of garbage bags littered on the 
streets and the working class is immobile on the economic 

ladder. The real problems with the movie arise when Phillips 
uses these political issues to justify the violence that the Joker 
commits. Of course, this endorsement is not overt, but when we 
spend such long and intimate stretches with a man like Arthur, 
the filmmakers clearly want the audience to understand his 
motivations. 
If one examines his anarchic ambitions for what they are — 
the euphoric dreams of a murderer made a fool by the system 
one too many times — “Joker” might not even be interesting 
enough to merit the discourse it has created. Many times 
during the movie I was reminded of another messianic symbol 
of masculinity and working class revolution: Tyler Durden 
from “Fight Club.” The important contrast between Durden 
and Fleck, though, is the depth to their madness. Where I 
think Durden intentionally becomes becomes self-parody, as 
conforming and soulless as the world he hates, Fleck falls into 
this trap without knowing it. 
Many audience members in my theater evidently fell into the 
gleeful gravity of the Joker too, laughing hysterically at some of 
his carnage. Phillips even placed a few jokes into Fleck’s killing 
spree, which were more cringey than anything else. 
Recently, the director received backlash for complaining 
about the difficulty of making comedy amid “woke culture,” and 
the more I reflect on “Joker,” the more it feels like a self-portrait. 
Toward the end of the film, a cackling Joker is asked what he 
thinks is so funny. “You wouldn’t understand,” he replies raspily. 
Maybe for Phillips (and those in my screening who laughed so 
frequently) there is something cathartic about watching Arthur 
Fleck wreak havoc on a society that refuses to understand him, 
even when his bloodshed is portrayed with such irresponsible 
glee. But I guess I wouldn’t understand. And I’m OK with that.

We really didn’t need ‘Joker’

When is empathy evil? Appreciating others’ 
experiences carves out the space for solidarity in 
which people with privilege take action. But imagining 
others’ experiences implies the possibility of 
understanding their trauma. “Stepping into the shoes 
of others” requires one to assume they know what 
trauma is happening and how others would react.
People’s pain is often situated across boundaries 
of race and class. To empathize across those lines, 
one must squint to make out a fuzzy image of what is 
happening to others. They must further distort their 
own experience, alter their assumption of how the 
victims should react. On top of this, advocacy through 
publicizing others’ trauma can erase and paper over 
the reality of others’ experiences. 
But then, what’s the alternative? Not empathizing 
whatsoever means victims’ stories aren’t heard. Could 
literature help create a more innocuous empathy? 
Chigozie Obioma’s “An Orchestra of Minorities” 
gracefully sheds light on how class and race affect the 
effability of another’s pain. At heart, it’s a charming 
love story. Chinonso is a Nigerian peasant farmer who 
meets Ndali, an upper-class woman. Obioma shows 
his mastery of class-based symbolism right off the 
bat: The two meet as Chinonso saves the upper-class 
woman from an attempted suicide. 
Despite their differences in status, the two fall in 
love after a chance meeting following the incident. 
Naturally, Ndali’s upper-class family disapproves of 
their relationship, and the novel focuses on Chinonso’s 
attempts to win the affection of her family. 

Here, the author begins to hint towards his mastery 
of remixing classic English stories (“Romeo and Juliet,” 
in this case) with tales of contemporary race and class. 
Chinonso’s journey to redefine his ascribed status is 
defined by humiliation at every turn. In a particularly 
difficult chapter, he’s made to valet a party that Ndali’s 
brother invited him to. 
Eventually, though, Chinonso makes a journey 
to Cyprus to obtain an education and better match 
Ndali’s class (she plans to become a pharmacist). If 
the story in Nigeria highlights his class identity, his 
time in Cyprus showcases his racial identity. Obioma 
shows how Africans must continuously be aware of 
their ethnicity, with people confusing him with Black 

celebrities or asking to touch his hair.
The story is explained through the narration of 
Chinonso’s “guardian spirit” or “chi.” This spirit must 
recount and justify his actions in a “trial” to Nigerian 
Igbo deities. Through his narrator’s omniscience and 
bias toward the protagonist, Obioma subtly parodies 
and pokes fun at usual Western storytelling. The 
trial is also a brilliant symbol for society’s judgment of 
Chinonso while showing the shortcomings of empathy. 
This is reflected in the plot, as even Chinonso’s love, 
Ndali, doesn’t truly understand his struggles.
Obioma offers a page spread of complex charts, 
graphs and lists at the start of the book to help explain 
the Igbo Cosmology. Heaven is broken down into 
domains, and the composition of man is conveniently 
summed up in a venn diagram. Both the universe and 
the process of reincarnation share their chart: The life 
cycle circulates the Earth and Spirit worlds.
Although initially intimidating, the spread’s 
significance becomes apparent over the course of 
the novel. This is less to do with appeasing Western 
Promethean impulses to box and map the Igbo 
Cosmology conveniently and more to help the reader 
navigate the book and its contents. The Cosmology is 
overwhelming at first like Chinosmo is overwhelmed 
in Cyprus. 
But, as with any novel, this empathy crafted by 
Obioma has shortcomings. A privileged reader can 
simply close the book. Chinosmo is trapped in his 
situation. 
Throughout the novel, Obioma masterfully 
balances the reader’s empathy and their realization of 
the fruitlessness of the relating. The story’s similarity 
to “The Odyssey” and “Romeo and Juliet” allows the 
narrative to be tangible and understood for Western 
audiences. Obioma’s brilliant prose and descriptions 
reinforce this. 
Still, the deities’ trial reminds the Western reader of 
their inevitable shortcomings of real understanding. 
The meta-commentary of the trial does a great job of 
making readers acutely aware that Obioma sees them 
as an agent in this story.
Moreover, the fragility of pure empathy is reflected 
in the story: Throughout the story, Chinonso finds it 
difficult to communicate his situation to Ndali fully. 
This is most apparent through their correspondences 
while Obioma is in Cyprus and at the story’s conclusion. 
This empathy compels readers, giving them a glimpse 
of a (well done) perspective they haven’t experienced.
As a whole, Obioma’s book showcases the complex 
interactions involved in empathy. Communicating 
one’s genuine experience is difficult even to omniscient 
deities or the ones people love the most. It must be even 
more complicated between people one has never met. 
The book’s prose, groundbreaking commentary 
and experimental narration style more than earn its 
place in the 2019 Booker Prize Shortlist. Whether or 
not it takes the prize, “An Orchestra of Minorities” is 
a gripping read. The book leaves a lasting effect on the 
reader’s perception of how race and class affect every 
aspect of one’s lives — even something as pure as love.

BOOK REVIEW

By the time the Power Center’s lights had dimmed for 
the final performance of Grupo Corpo’s weekend stay in 
Ann Arbor, I had long settled into the comforts of being 
an audience member. The shimmering curtain, red fold-
down seats and whirring small-talk of everyone around 
me had helped to wind down my busy Sunday afternoon. 
When the curtain lifted, the stage remained quiet. The 
first dancer came flying downward from the air above the 
stage floor. The move was an intelligent tactic on behalf 
of choreographer Rodrigo Pederneiras — it grabbed my 
expectations and threw them out the window (or perhaps 
more accurately, into the wings). In doing so, Pederneiras 
woke up my drowsy Sunday-afternoon brain and asked 
for my attention in the following two-act performance. 
Unfortunately, the show failed to be this engaging 
throughout. The Brazilian modern dance group 
performed two 45-minute works — “Bach” and “Gira” 
— which were touted by the University Musical Society’s 
preview as “wildly different.” Contradictingly, I noticed a 
lot of similarities. 
Grupo Corpo’s dancers are inspiringly powerful, but 
this power comes to a fault. The performers use every 
ounce of themselves. They whack their leg extensions 
into the air and actively push their bodies into the ground 
when landing a jump. They dance with an energy that 
tinkers on the edge of losing control (sometimes, it looked 
like they actually had). Their necks jolt back toward 
their spines with abandon and their arms disregard 
the anatomical limitations of a shoulder joint. Their 
willingness for power dismissed my want to respect the 
fragility of a human form. 
In the beginning, this was exceptionally satisfying. I 
was entranced by the freedom engendered in their lack of 
fear. After a while, though, the novelty wore off. I longed 
for more subtlety but only saw their rote power increase 

by every spin, whirl, jump and jolt. 
“Bach,” set to music by Marco Antônio Guimarães 
inspired by the style of J.S. Bach, relied heavily on the 
power and dynamism of its score. Throughout, the 
sounds of organ and strings pierced the refined air of the 
theatre. The remnants of Bach’s well renowned melodies 
were certainly detectable, but this music was designed 
to make a thoroughly modern impression. To match this 
drama, a set of long poles lowered from the ceiling and the 
dancers sifted through the new architecture by hanging 
and swinging from above while action continued onstage 
below. This dimension provided a new sense of space, but 
over time the performance came to depend on the poles 
too heavily. As they became less new, I shifted back to the 
unchanging energy of the dancing and realized there was 
little left to maintain my initial excitement. 
On the surface, “Gira” did appear different. Both men 
and women wore long white skirts that swirled alongside 
their jumps. The supple fabric added a new layer of grace 
to especially rigid movements. Based on the spirits of an 
ancient religion, the dancers remained on the side and 
back of the stage while they were not moving, cocooned 
away in black seats with individual overhanging curtains. 
Their presence made for a sense of community but was 
also mysteriously reminiscent of death. Much like the 
poles in Bach, this paradox catalyzed my engagement. 
Also like “Bach,” however, the theme grew old before the 
end of the work. 
As the final curtain lowered I blinked in disbelief 
at the performers’ stamina but was left bored by the 
ongoing applause. I was ready to get out of the theatre. 
The evening had slathered an even level of force across 
the stage but failed to reach the subtlety required to fill 
the nooks and crannies hidden deep below. I couldn’t 
find the specificity that I latch onto in a live performance, 
and as I meandered home and slouched onto my couch I 
could already feel the dance’s memory floating away, lost 
among the sea of indistinguishable jolts, kicks, spins and 
undulations.

65 “The lowest form 
of humor—when 
you don’t think 
of it first”: Oscar 
Levant

Wilco has lived under the shadow of Yankee 
Hotel Foxtrot for almost two decades. Some 
of their best work (“Impossible Germany,” 
“One Sunday Morning”) has come after their 
landmark album, but they’ve struggled to 
release a full project that measures up to such a 
lofty expectation. They always will. 
Skeletal and moody, Ode to Joy is the most 
cohesive and consistent Wilco album since Sky 
Blue Sky. However, it lacks the highs that Wilco 
are capable of reaching. Maybe it’s wrong to 
expect Wilco to continue to produce at their 
high-water mark forever, but it’s hard not to 
feel a little disappointed whenever they put 
out another capable but unremarkable project. 
However, if you let go of the expectations Wilco 
has labored under for the majority of their 
existence, Ode to Joy is a successful album, 
always pleasant and often beautiful.

The sonic palette is subtle and tasteful, 
varied enough to avoid monotony but consistent 
enough to lend the project an overarching 
thematic sensation. The songs across the 
album are made cohesive through a few choice 
production qualities — crunchy snares, textural 
guitars, gossamer piano — as well as through 
their simple, plaintive lyrics. Jeff Tweedy’s 
voice has always possessed a charmingly 
wavering, wistful timbre; his aging vocal cords 

only intensify this quality. Unfortunately, it is 
possible to have too much of a good thing, as 
his vocals now evoke frailty and weariness to a 
degree that can grow irksome. 
“Bright Leaves” is a prototypical atmospheric 
Wilco piece: Instruments flit in and out of the 
soundscape accompanied by glitchy electronic 
elements while Jeff Tweedy croons a doleful 
melody about somewhat cryptic relationship 
problems. The singles “Everyone Hides” and 
“Love Is Everywhere (Beware)” are much 
stronger in the context of the album. The latter, 
a folksy waltz, is one of the more successful 
outings on the project, thanks in large part to a 
vivid guitar riff during the chorus. 
Ode to Joy is not perfect. This project is the 
opposite of catchy — as soon as you stop listening, 
the memory of any given song fades immediately. 
While that’s not necessarily a bad thing, the 
album can certainly drift towards tedium, and 
it dips in quality towards the middle. “White 
Wooden Cross” is one of the weaker lyrical 
cuts: Jeff Tweedy, when passing by a roadside 
memorial, imagines that his loved one is the one 
whose demise the cross marks. This makes him 
sad. While such simple moments of imagined 
grief can be relatable and powerful, Tweedy 
doesn’t really go much beyond the surface of 
how those brief flashes of mortality affect us. 
Sometimes concision is insufficient.
The quality of the lyrics throughout is 
inconsistent. Sometimes Wilco succeeds in 
being straightforward and profound: “I’ve 
tried, in my way, to love everyone” is the type 
of thoughtful simplicity Wilco tends to excel at. 
Sometimes they come off as half-baked: “High 
in an old dead tree / That plastic bag is me / 
That’s where I want to be” falls well short of the 
depth and clarity that Jeff Tweedy has shown 
himself to be capable of in the past. 
There is a fine line between pensive and 
soporific that Wilco spends most of Ode to Joy 
flirting with. Ode to Joy is weary, the sound of 
the thoughts that float through your head right 
before a nap after a long day, the sound of a brisk 
fall morning as you slowly wake up. I suspect 
that this album will blossom with reflection and 
repeated listens. Time will tell.

‘Ode to Joy’ lacks... joy

Remember when you were a little kid and 
you would fall asleep on the couch after a 
“Spongebob Squarepants” marathon? You’d 
wake up in the middle of the night, and there 
was always some adult cartoon playing. It 
was always a little weird, a little creepy and 
impossible to figure out what was going on 
or who the show existed for in the first place. 
That show was “Bless the Harts.” It’s about a 
family from the American South, and while it’s 
a slightly different take on yet another white 
American family, there’s nothing particularly 
inspiring or unique about it.
The pilot jumps right into the life of the Hart 
family, who live in a small town somewhere in 
the South. There’s a star-studded cast, with 
Kristen Wiig (“Big Mouth”) playing Jenny Hart, 
Maya Rudolph (“Big Mouth”) playing Betty 
Hart, Ike Barinholtz (“The Twilight Zone”) 
playing Wayne Edwards, and Kumail Nanjiani 
(“Silicon Valley”) playing Jesus, for some 
reason. The bulk of the story is centered around 
the family’s struggles from living paycheck 
to paycheck — in the pilot, the family’s water 
gets shut off. Jenny finds out that her mother, 
Betty, has been hoarding these stuffed animals 
called “Hug N’ Bugs” in a storage unit, in hopes 
of selling them for a fortune in the future. 
Throughout the episode, they try to auction 
these stuffed animals off on the internet, only to 
find out that they don’t hold any value anymore.
The show makes small historical jokes, as the 
Hug N’ Bugs were all inspired by a historical 
figure. At some point, Jenny says, “Good news, 
Nelson Mandela Super Soaker Hug N’ Bug. I’m 
setting you free!” which elicited a nose-exhale 
laugh from me. The rest of the jokes were at this 
caliber or lower, which offers little to nothing 

fresh in the world of comedy, especially in the 
realm of adult animation. The southern small-
town living is also a trope that we’ve seen plenty 
of times before, but the show didn’t put much 
effort into putting a twist on it. There was 
the staple mom’s dumb boyfriend, the staple 
southern religiosity and the staple “this’ll sell 
for a fortune later” hoarder. 
The main issues with the series are its 
lack of originality and unwillingness to push 
boundaries. With the vast collection of adult 
animation out there today, there’s nothing 
about this show that makes it stand out amongst 
the others. But perhaps this is too harsh. It’s 
possible that I, an East-Coaster, was not the 
target audience for this kind of show. After all, 

I’ve never spent more than a week in the South, 
and that’s certainly not enough time to pick 
up on the intricacies of southern small-town 
living. But if they were going to make this show 
targeted toward a niche audience, then it might 
have been set up to fail anyway. Perhaps over the 
course of the season, the writers will learn to dig 
deeper and find relatability in the specificity of 
the circumstances, and the audience can grow 
to larger than that small portion of the country.

‘Bless the Harts’ doesn’t
deliver us anything new

Kevin Barry develops every word of 
his novel “Night Boat to Tangier” with 
contrasting magnetic forces. The reader is 
wholeheartedly repelled by the despicable 
tendencies 
of 
supposed 
protagonists 
Maurice Hearne and Charlie Redmond. 
Yet somehow, Barry’s captivating style 
re-attracts the reader, familiarizing him 
with the most unfamiliar of lifestyles and 
impulses in a manner akin to that of a 
compelling nature documentary.
Barry’s coverage of these longtime 
partners in crime begins well past their 
prime. They sit in the decrepit port of 
Algeciras and wait for the title boat to 
Tangier in hopes that Maurice’s long 
estranged daughter, Dilly, will arrive or 
depart onboard. Dilly is the primary source 
of empathy throughout the novel and a 
beacon of purity in each flashback Maurice 
and Charlie recall. She represents the 
innocence that Maurice and Charlie have 
long surrendered — the two hope to save 
her from a problematic lifestyle like those 
they had led their entire lives.
Despite 
his 
paternal 
concern 
for 
Dilly, Maurice is expertly depicted as a 
contemptible human being in just about 
every 
flashback 
that 
Barry 
provides. 
Maurice possesses few memories not 
involving mistresses, drug smuggling or 
assault. Despite his constant reflection, 
his most damning personality trait is his 
inability to take responsibility for his 
actions, even in hindsight. He had no choice 
but to perpetually cheat on his former 
partner, Cynthia, since he had a suspicion 
that she herself could have been cheating. 
His prior heroin use was inevitable since it 
was so placating for his anxiety, and the Irish 

are an inherently anxious group of people. 
By all accounts, Maurice is incorrigible. 
This makes Barry’s ability to garner any 
empathy at all for Maurice nothing short 
of a magic trick. He is only able to work his 
miracle through the juxtaposition of the 
regret he feels for his invisibility in Dilly’s 
life and the lack of regret he feels in every 
other facet of his life.

This 
tense 
question 
of 
regret 
is 
exemplified through the generally brief 
back-and-forth 
dialogue 
that 
Maurice 
and Charlie share as they kill time in 
the port of Algeciras. In the very first 
pages of the novel, Barry cements their 
thuggish personas through their concise, 
unemotional responses to one another. 
These segments are so well executed that 
the reader may find themselves questioning 
Barry’s own past — his ability to take on 
a criminal voice comes about a little too 
naturally. The only time his voice partially 
breaks is when Maurice considers his 
shortcomings as a father or whether he will 
find Dilly. In spite of the initial disgust he 
feels toward Maurice’s lifestyle, the reader 
cannot help but hope that Maurice gets his 
second chance.
Unfortunately, 
Barry’s 
creation 
of 

empathy for a wholly detestable character 
does not make for a perfect novel. At times, 
the dialogue and reflection at the port 
feel as though they are done too well. The 
format of these scenes is so unique and rich 
in voice that the flashbacks consequently 
fell short. While Maurice’s backstory is 
crucial to the payoff of the more reflective 
scenes, the more traditional presentation 
of his past tended to create a noticeable 
disconnect 
throughout 
the 
novel. 
Transitioning from a chapter of rapid-fire, 
authentic dialogue to one of more drawn 
out, albeit effective, description tends to 
disrupt the exciting tempo of much of the 
novel and leave the reader waiting for the 
chapter to end. Perhaps Barry did this 
somewhat deliberately, since the effect 
of the imbalance is the reader yearning 
to leave the excerpts of the life of crime 
characterizing Maurice’s younger years in 
exchange for a time period in which there is 
an actual chance for redemption. However, 
this is a very generous stance to take, and 
it’s more likely that these sections were not 
as effectively executed as Barry may have 
hoped. While not as terrible as the character 
they portray, Barry’s scenes set in the past 
simply cannot uphold the precedent of 
captivation achieved in present scenes.
Kevin 
Barry’s 
novel 
is 
one 
that 
thoroughly impresses in its ability to 
both capture a voice so unknown to most 
readers and evoke empathy for characters 
with so few redeeming qualities. While 
the pacing of flashbacks is mismanaged at 
times, patient readers may not mind this 
shortcoming at all, and restless readers 
will still have their hunger for fast-paced 
writing satiated by the scenes in the port 
of Algeciras. Whether looking for a way to 
fill an evening or needing something to do 
until your own boat arrives, “Night Boat to 
Tangier” is a worthy use of your time.

Barry’s ‘Night Boat to Tangier’

Michigan power play refreshed in new system

Jack Becker didn’t even need 
to look to find the open man.
After 
Michael 
Pastujov’s 
shot missed just wide of an 
open net, his brother — senior 
forward Nick Pastujov — sent 
a pass to Becker, who was 
waiting 
on 
the 
edge of the left 
faceoff 
circle. 
Without a glance, 
Becker 
knew 
he 
had 
Jimmy 
Lambert 
wide 
open across the 
ice.
The 
no-look 
pass hit Lambert’s 
stick right on the 
tape and a split 
second later, the puck was 
in the net behind Windsor 
goaltender Jonathan Reinhart. 
With the score, Michigan had 
its second power-play goal in 
three opportunities on Sunday.
“I thought (Lambert’s unit) 
was spectacular,” said senior 
forward Will Lockwood. “They 
looked great. My unit needs 
work on a few things, we were a 
little sloppy … Cheers to them, 

and we’re going to have to work 
on our unit a little bit.”
The power play system is 
new for the Wolverines this 
year, but their performance 
Sunday wouldn’t show it. Three 
goals on six opportunities is an 
impressive showing, though it 
requires the acknowledgement 
that it came in an exhibition 
matchup 
against a team 
that 
doesn’t 
compete 
in 
any division of 
the NCAA.
When 
Michigan 
coach 
Mel 
Pearson hired 
assistant Kris 
Mayotte to run 
the 
penalty 
kill this offseason, the move 
required associate head coach 
Bill Muckalt to run the power 
play. Muckalt decided to switch 
to a modern four-forwards-
one-defenseman system, rather 
than 
the 
traditional 
three 
forwards and two blueliners.
Through 
one 
game, 
the 
new system is paying off — 
and Muckalt, off recruiting in 
British Columbia, wasn’t even 

in the building to make sure 
things ran smoothly.
“I thought we didn’t score on 
some of our best chances on the 
power play, but it looked good,” 
Pearson said.
Last season, the Wolverines 
finished 44th in the nation 
with a power play percentage 
of 15.6-percent. One game, 
especially 
an 
exhibition 
matchup, 
is 
an 
inadequate 
sample size to 
make 
claims 
about 
how 
things 
could 
go 
this 
year, 
but it was clear 
that both units 
looked 
more 
cohesive 
and 
creative than they did last year.
“We added so much skill 
to the team,” Lockwood said. 
“We’re gonna have two really 
good units this year and two 
units that are going to be 
threats. I don’t know if it’s 
going to be a specific first and 
second unit. I think you can 
throw both units out there.”
While 
having 
an 
extra 
forward opens up offensive 

opportunities, there are risks 
associated 
with 
one 
fewer 
defenseman on the unit, and 
Michigan saw that firsthand 
on Sunday.
As forward Alex Friesen’s 
penalty 
expired, 
forward 
Brady 
Pataki 
noticed 
him 
coming out of the penalty 
box and sent the puck up the 
ice to his teammate. Friesen 
found himself with a one-on-
none opportunity in front of 
sophomore goaltender Strauss 
Mann, but Mann grabbed the 
puck out of the air and snuffed 
out the breakaway chance.
“It’s 
a 
little 
scary,” 
Pearson said. “They got a 
little breakaway on it tonight 
because your forwards start 
on the power play (and) they’re 
not thinking defense. That 
happened to us the end of the 
year last year. Guys came out of 
the penalty box (and scored), so 
we’re going to have to address 
that for sure, but you’re going 
to have that creativity (with 
four forwards).”
A year after their power 
play units scored just six goals 
on 54 opportunities in the 
second half of the season, the 
Wolverines’ 
power 
play 
looks refreshed. 
The new system 
seems to have 
injected 
some 
new 
life 
and 
creativity, and 
the 
balance 
between 
offense 
and 
defense 
with 
an 
additional 
forward is something that will 
come in time. As Pearson often 
said last year, special teams 
— the power play and penalty 
killing — is key to winning 
games.
Last 
season, 
Michigan 
struggled in both aspects of 
special teams. This year, at 
least the power play looks to be 
on good footing heading into 
official games.

‘M’ withstands pressure

Nicki Hernandez dribbled 
near midfield 20 minutes into 
the game. At the moment, there 
were no defenders between the 
junior midfielder and the goal. 
Nebraska 
goalkeeper 
Aubrei 
Corder saved her shot, but 
the breakaway provided the 
first hint of how the Michigan 
women’s soccer team would win 
the game.
Sophomore 
midfielder 
Meredith Haakenson scored 
on the ensuing corner, en route 
to a 4-1 Wolverine victory in a 
game that was characterized by 
the Cornhuskers’ high pressure 
leaving them exposed at the 
back. 
The pressure from Nebraska 
caused problems for Michigan 
throughout the game, as the 
Wolverines tried to maintain 
possession of the ball in their 
own 
defensive 
third. 
They 
continually tried to pass out of 
the pressure from Nebraska, 
looking to play quick passes to 
their center midfielders to get 
the ball out of congested areas. 
But Michigan couldn’t always 
do so successfully, turning the 
ball over in dangerous areas and 
providing good opportunities 
for Nebraska’s attack.
“It’s an area that we need to 
continue to get better at and be 
comfortable possessing with 

pressure,” said Michigan coach 
Jennifer Klein. “I think we’re 
very capable of doing it.”

The 
Wolverines 

demonstrated that capability 
in a few key moments, leading 
them to breakaways similar 
to Hernandez’s. 14 minutes 
after her initial breakaway, 
Hernandez scored by getting 
behind the Nebraska backline 
again, while fifth-year senior 
defender Sura Yekka scored 
her first goal as a Wolverine on 
a breakaway of her own in the 
second half. 
The 
relatively 
easy 
breakaway goals came from 
Michigan’s ability to break out 
of initial pressure from the 
Cornhuskers – once the first 
line of defenders was broken, 
the Wolverines always had a 
numbers advantage. 
Even with these goals, the 
Wolverines want to increase 
the number of times they 
successfully escape pressure 
and decrease the number of 
dangerous turnovers. However, 
it is not easy to maintain the 
composure needed to find the 
right pass. 
“The more we talk and 
communicate, 
the 
easier 
it 
is,” said sophomore defender 
Janiece Joyner. “That’s mostly 
what we try to focus on, to not 
panic in those situations, but 
embrace the challenge and 
work through it together.”

Juwan Howard bringing new energy

It’s 
a 
tall 
enough 
task 
coaching in Ann Arbor at all. No 
matter the sport, expectations 
for Michigan teams, and an 
athletic department that spends 
the third-most among public 
schools nationally, are lofty.
But following one of the 
greatest coaches ever to lead 
the Wolverines in John Beilein? 
How do you even begin to think 
about that? 
Juwan Howard’s message at 
Big Ten Media Day was clear: 
Beilein was great. But he’s going 
to be his own man. That’s how 
he’s bringing Michigan into the 
Howard era.
“I’m sure a lot of people 
think, you have a lot of pressure 
on you to try to fill those shoes,” 
Howard said at Media Day. “All 
I can say is this: I’m not going 
to try to be like coach Beilein. 
He has his philosophy, his 
way of doing things. I have my 
philosophy, and I feel that works 
for our team moving forward.”
Message received: new coach, 
new era.
And as the team starts to get 
into the rhythm of practice, of 
a new coach, of a new team and 
a new basketball season, the 
storylines that will shape this 
new era in Michigan basketball 

are starting to take shape.
After a 10-season playing 
career in the NBA, and six 
years as an assistant coach for 
the Miami Heat, Howard has 
turned the talent he showed 
in his years at Michigan into 
knowledge of the game on par 
with the coaching talent leaving 
Ann 
Arbor. 
Beilein 
would 
often pick Howard’s brain in 
the offseason, and Howard’s 
plans for the team’s defense are 
already drawing comparisons 
to 
former 
assistant 
coach 
Luke 
Yaklich’s 
defensive 
wizardry.
“He 
actually 
reminds me of 
Coach Yak,” said 
junior 
forward 
Isaiah 
Livers. 
“The 
defensive 
pressure, 
the 
defensive mind, 
all of that. His knowledge of the 
defensive side of basketball is 
just insane.”
But, true to his word, Howard 
is running practices his way. 
It’s inevitable in some ways: 
Howard is a good 20 years 
younger than his predecessor. 
The wonder in his face and in 
his voice when he points at the 
block ‘M’ pinned to his lapel, 
the grin on his face when he 

talks about his team and about 
the program he’s building in 
Ann Arbor — it’s impossible to 
ignore. 
The energy, the excitement 
that he’s bringing to Michigan 
basketball 
— 
it’s 
almost 
palpable. 
That enthusiasm that has 
embodied 
his 
approach 
to 
this new challenge hasn’t just 
showed up in quotes from on 
high, from behind a podium to 
a room of reporters. It’s in how 
he’s 
running 
this program.
“The vibe is 
a lot different,” 
said 
senior 
guard 
Zavier 
Simpson. 
“It’s 
definitely 
a 
positive 
vibe. 
Juwan brings a 
lot of energy.”
Youthful 
energy doesn’t 
preclude urgency, though. In 
preseason polls, the Wolverines 
were picked to finish fifth in 
the Big Ten. They disagree, and 
they’re determined to prove 
they’re right early on under 
Howard.
“The vibe? Serious,” Livers 
said. “We all know where 
they’ve got us projected, and we 
do not like it. At all. We’re not 
supposed to like it.”

Wolverines prepare to face Peters

Jon Runyan Jr. still plays 
Mario Kart with Brandon Peters 
on his Nintendo Switch. The 
former Michigan quarterback 
is better — Runyan estimates 
Peters wins 55 percent of the 
time — but Runyan still takes 
pleasure in taking his wins and 
rubbing them in.
In 
those 
moments, 
it’s 
almost like the two are still 
roommates.
Runyan and Peters lived 
together last year. On Saturday, 
when the Michigan football 
team visits Illinois — where 
Peters is now the starting 
quarterback — the two will 
be reunited as players on two 
opposing teams, fighting for 
two disparate goals.
“I’m 
excited 
to 
hit 
a 
quarterback that’s on my team, 
actually — that was on my 
team,” said fifth-year senior 
linebacker 
Jordan 
Glasgow. 
“He was a good friend of mine 
while he was here and it’s gonna 
be fun to play against him and 
hopefully we put him on the 
ground a lot. Hopefully nothing 
happens, but I want to make his 
day as rough as possible.”
From Runyan’s perspective, 
Peters was a quiet guy who 
kept mostly to himself. But 
sometimes, 
Peters 
opened 
up and talked about himself. 
After all, Peters didn’t have the 
normal career trajectory of a 
6-foot-5, four-star quarterback 
Jim Harbaugh once compared 
to Andrew Luck.
Peters was once anointed 
Michigan’s savior, coming into 
a 2017 game against Rutgers 
to raucous cheers after it was 
clear John O’Korn would no 
longer cut it. It seemed like 
Peters could finally be the 
quarterback 
the 
Wolverines 
had been missing.
The feeling lasted for three 
fleeting games. Then Peters 
suffered a concussion against 
Wisconsin, could only watch as 
O’Korn was dreadful in a loss 
to Ohio State and looked utterly 
pedestrian in a bowl loss to 
South Carolina. That April, 

Shea Patterson was granted 
an 
instant-eligibility 
waiver 
and Peters’ entire career was 
thrown into flux.
“He never really voiced any 
displeasures to me,” Runyan 
said. “After that 2017 season, he 
was full on board with trying 
to win this spot even with Shea 
transferring and not knowing 
his eligibility. And he battled 
really hard throughout spring 
ball and throughout fall camp 
and I think they declared Shea 
the starter halfway through 
camp. ... In the end he did what 
was best for him and he’s in a 
pretty good place right now (at) 
Illinois.”
Runyan 
first 
heard 
that 
Peters 
wanted 
to 
transfer 
around 
December, 
when 
Michigan was beginning to 
prepare for the Peach Bowl, but 
he believes Peters was thinking 
about it before then — and who 
could blame him?
But Peters stayed invested in 
the team every step of the way 
and once the season was done, 
he took a hefty course load 
before leaving for Champaign 
in order to be eligible for a 
graduate transfer.
“He was always studying 
and I was always there just 
watching him,” Runyan said. 
“I felt bad for him, but he 
eventually did what’s best for 
him.”
Peters’ main options were 
Illinois and a handful of MAC 
schools, and the process wasn’t 
always kind. Peters was gone 
almost every weekend taking 
another visit. Some schools 
strung him along, offering him 

a visit, pulling it when they 
offered another quarterback, 
then begging for him back 
when that quarterback looked 
for other options.
But with the Illini, Peters got 
a starting job, the reputation 
of the Big Ten and a new home 
less than two hours from his 
hometown of Avon, Ind. And 
when the Wolverines see him 
there, they’ll be nothing but 
happy for him.
“I really liked Brandon a 
lot and he won us ballgames,” 
Harbaugh 
said. 
“ 
… 
Been 
following him, and I’d say the 
same for how he’s playing there 
at Illinois. Good player.”
Normally, 
the 
perfect 
reunion for Michigan would 
be Peters playing a good game 
while 
the 
Wolverines 
still 
winning anyway — by a lot.
But they aren’t guaranteed to 
get their happy ending. Peters 
left last week’s game with an 
injury, and he’s questionable 
for this week. After what Peters 
has been through, having to 
watch one of his team’s biggest 
games of the season — against 
his former team — from the 
sidelines would be a cruel twist 
of irony.
So now, the Wolverines are 
just hoping they get to see him 
out on the field and in a better 
place — and, of course, leave 
Champaign with a win. Then 
Runyan will have bragging 
rights much bigger than Mario 
Kart.
“He’s got his stuff going on, 
we’ve got ours,” Glasgow said. 
“But I wish him the best, except 
when he plays against us.”

Harbaugh comments on California NLI law

Jim Harbaugh was asked an 
open-ended question Monday, as 
reporters searched for his thoughts 
on the California bill that was 
passed last week allowing players 
to profit off their name, image and 
likeness. 
As the hot-button topic of the 
college sports landscape, it’s more 
than a reasonable question to ask of 
the highest-paid figure in the state 
of Michigan.
Harbaugh used the chance 
to expound upon — even flesh 
out — his own thoughts about 
amateurism, 
pay-for-play 
and 
potential reform options.
“My feeling would be that 
college football is an amateur 
status,” Harbaugh said, before 
detailing 
several 
hypothetical 
options to alter the system. “I think 
the fair thing to do would be, not 
to restrict players to have to stay in 
college for three years. They could 
be drafted after their freshman 
year, they could be drafted after 
their sophomore year, they can be 
drafted after their junior year, their 
senior year. I would also make a 
rule that if they weren’t drafted, 
they could return. 
“And they could also be very 
productive, if somebody were 
to leave after their freshman or 
sophomore or junior year and they 
hadn’t finished their degree, they’d 
have the ability within a certain 
timespan to come back and finish 
their degree. That would be what I 
would suggest or propose.”
After being pressed with a 
follow-up, Harbaugh said that he 
would, indeed, consider proposing 
that to the NCAA. That potential 
system would model that of college 
basketball, which is also rife with 
criticism at the moment. 
Still, though Harbaugh’s long-
winded 
answers 
opened 
new 
avenues worth exploring, he hardly 
touched on the central thematic 
tension: 
compensation. 
Asked 
in a more direct manner about 
payment, he offered a different 
potential reform.

“I 
wouldn’t 
be 
against 
(payment),” 
Harbaugh 
said. 
“There could be a system that, like 
the scholarship, it’s really worth 
upwards of $100,000 or more, 
when you factor in room, board, 
food, travel, the many things. And 
that’s per scholarship, 85 players. 
You could have a system that cuts 
all scholarships in half — instead 
of 85 scholarships, there’s 42 
scholarships. Forty-two players 
would play the scholarship plus 
the $100,000. If you did that across 
all sports, the budget could stay 
the same. It could be financially 
feasible. Kind of think the other 
way would be better. There’s 
amateur and there’s pro, and there’s 
no restriction for someone to take 
their shot at playing football.”
Harbaugh’s off-the-cuff musings 
are relatively representative of the 
national conversation writ large; 
one in which, while the rumblings 
continue to grow, the concrete 
ideas of amending — or abolishing 
— amateurism remain in the 
introductory phase.
Players, of course, will have 
their say in the matter as well. 
Asked throughout the week about 
the California bill, most Michigan 
players largely deflected answers. 
They pointed out that any reform 
would have no impact on their 
careers, and as such, they hadn’t 

invested too deeply in the outcomes. 
Without push from athletes, 
though, there could be no such 
major reform. Many, specifically 
more 
experienced 
players, 
understand their role in that — if 
still stopping short of being the 
harbingers of change.
“It’s really something that I’ve 
never 
really 
actually 
thought 
hard about,” said senior left tackle 
Jon Runyan. “But I think that 
basketball, and how they have it 
set up, where you can declare for 
the draft, go through the whole 
process, as long as you don’t sign an 
agent, and you can make a decision 
to come back to school … seems 
something that I guess is pretty 
reasonable.”
In college basketball, players 
must remain in school for one year 
prior to entering the draft, and 
can declare any year thereafter. 
The rule to which Runyan is 
referring, which permits player 
to enter their names in the NBA 
draft and participate in workouts 
before determining whether to 
leave or return to school, has 
been met with near-unanimous 
approval from players. It does bring 
about difficulties for coaches in 
formalizing rosters in advance of 
the season, and has had a marked 
impact on the transfer market as 
a result. Players, in that scenario, 

moved the needle.
Players 
like 
Runyan 
will 
undoubtedly have a say in the 
future of the sport. But it remains 
Harbaugh’s opinion which wields 
the most power. 
His presence drives hundreds 
of millions in revenue each year. 
His salary exceeds $8 million 
annually. Throughout his career, 
his traditionalist reputation has 
frequently been misplaced — he is, 
in many respects, a player’s coach. 
Harbaugh’s openness to reform, 
if still vague, serves as an example 
of the rising tides readying to flood 
the landscape. Coaches, it seems, 
should prepare themselves or be 
washed away.
“If you’re a tennis player and 
you’d like to be a professional 
tennis player at 17, you can be 
a professional tennis player at 
17,” Harbaugh said. “To give the 
opportunity to somebody to be a 
professional football player when 
they’re 19, 20, 21. It’s not a long time. 
But the window to be a professional 
football player, if somebody’s good 
enough to do that, and then return 
and finish their degree probably 
would be appreciated and not taken 
for granted, and looked at for the 
value that it is — it’s hundreds of 
thousands of dollars for a college 
education these days, plus room 
and board, books and tuition.”

H

ave you ever looked 
down on the the rink 
at Yost Ice Arena, 
watching the Michigan hockey 
team skate from red line to red 
line and wondered, “Maybe I’m 
faster than one of the guys on 
the team?”
Well, the short answer is 
no.
Odds are, you cannot skate 
faster than a Division I hockey 
player. 
And I’ll 
give you 
a hint, 
the long 
answer is 
also no, 
and I tried 
with more 
embarrass-
ing insight 
and head-
shaking 
perfor-
mances.
On Sunday night, 
immediately after the 
exhibition game against 
Windsor, the Wolverines 
hosted a “Skate With the 
Wolverines” event. It’s pretty 
self-explanatory, but in case 
you’re as slow on the uptake as 
I was on the ice, players met 
with fans in the rink to take 
pictures and sign autographs.
Except for me. I didn’t wait 
in line to ask for pictures or 
autographs. I made my way to 
the unsuspecting players, ask-
ing for just one thing — speed.
***
To give you some context on 
how fast the players were in 
our race, I’ll tell you about my 
skating ability first, for a point 
of comparison.
I’m going to be honest and 
say straight up, I’m an average 
skater — and I work at an ice 
rink. 
In Memphis, Tenn., though, 
where I’m from, there were no 
nearby ice rinks. Before 2011, 
when a local suburb built an 
ice house about an hour away, 
the closest rink was a two-
hour drive to Mississippi.
So my first time ice skating 
was December of my fresh-
man year at Michigan, during 
a public skate session of Yost. 
I went on a weekly basis my 
sophomore and junior year and 

got pretty decent.
And to give you an even bet-
ter read, I went back out to 
Yost Monday to time myself in 

peak 
con-
ditions 
— no breakfast, no lunch and 
no sleep. Averaged on three 
attempts, here were my times:
From blue line to blue line: 
3.38 seconds.
From the tip of the face-off 
circle to the far blue line: 4.70 
seconds.
A full lap around the rink: a 
mere 21.07 seconds.
The fastest lap time with a 
standing start in the NHL is 
Connor McDavid’s 13.31 sec-
onds. I guess you can say I’m 
pretty elite.
***
The people behind the skate 
rental booth pointed to the 
hallway at the entrance of the 
arena.
“We left all the skates over 
there,” they said, in spite of my 

pleas that I couldn’t find them.
I had dropped off my pair of 
CCM skates at the booth before 
the game, and anticipating that 
the players would be preoccu-
pied with the fans until the 
end, I waited until 
the last 

five minutes 
of the open skate before 
making my way down. 
But I couldn’t find my 
skates.
By the time the workers 
found them, there was only one 
minute running on the over-
head clock — indicating the 
time left for the event. I threw 
on my skates and made my way 
to the ice. 
Out of breath and out of 
time, I start circling around 
looking for the perfect prey. 
I stopped in front of goalten-
der Jack Leavy and looked up. 
My fellow Daily hockey writers 
were camped at the top of the 
press box on floor five and had 
been peering over the ledge to 
watch me.
“Him?” I mouthed to them, 
pointing in his direction.
One of them shook their 
head. Smart. He’s 6-foot-5; 

those strides would be lethal.
I then shifted my attention 
to senior goaltender Hayden 
Lavigne. Again, I pointed and 
looked up quizzically. 
Two of them crossed their 
arms to make an ‘X’. Smart. 
He’s 6-foot-3; still too tall for 
comfort.
Then my 

eyes 
laid on 
Strauss 
Mann. 
Three thumbs 
up from my co-
writers carried me to 
the front of the line where I 
challenged him to a race.
“Hey, yo listen,” I explained 
to him. “I lost a bet with my 
editors, and so now I have to 
ask one of y’all to race me and 
write a story on it. You cool 
with that?”
That was a lie, by the way. 
But he looked at me confusing-
ly before seeing the credential 
I pointed to. He then nodded in 
understanding before smiling.
“Wow, so you ask the goal-
ie?” he retorted. “Alright, give 

me a moment.”
He finished up taking pic-
tures before skating to the blue 
line.
“Alright, let’s do blue line to 
blue line,” Mann said, pointing 
end to end.
I guess he 

wasn’t 
ready 
for that 
full 
ice lap. 
People 
often tell 
me I can be 
intimidating 
on open ice. 
And it probably 
didn’t help that 
while Mann 
was getting 
ready, I kept 
telling to 
Alex, the 
Daily pho-
tographer 
next to 
me, that 
I was 
the 
great-
est 
of all 
time.

But we 
lined up on the blue line and 
readied ourselves. And then we 
raced.
Stride for stride, I honestly 
held my own. To be fair, Mann 
had to race after a game, in full 
pads and maybe (definitely) 
didn’t put full effort, but I’ll 
take a win.
We crossed mid-ice at the 
same rate, but it’s the second 
half where I always make my 

mark. With four strides, I 
pushed my way past Mann to 
beat him by centimeters. He 
leaned forward and stretched 
out his hand, but to no avail.
I was a winner.
Curling around the ice 
with me, he 
stretched out 
his hand, 
again, this 
time for a 
fist bump.
“I’m tired 
from the game,” 
Mann said.
I let him leave with 
his dignity, of course. Feel-
ing a little bit more confident 
in myself, I spotted my next 
victim. Jake Slaker was leaning 
against the opposing bench. I 
looked up again for affirma-
tion and was met with vicious 
nodding.
“Hey Jake, how are you feel-
ing about a race?” I asked.
“Sure thing, just let me tie 
my skates,” Slaker said.
He skated to the side and 
bent over to tie his skates.
“Am I letting you win?” Slak-
er said, smiling.
“Nah, go all out,” I said. “All 
out.”
“Like should I give you a 
head start and then beat you, 
or should…?” Slaker said.
“All out.”
At first, we had decided on 
a full lap, with different start 
points, but after realizing how 
it would turn out, we both 
agreed to a blue-line-to-blue-
line race — for me. Slaker 
would start from the top of the 
faceoff circle, a maybe-20 foot 
handicap.
“Let me know when to go,” 
Slaker said after the two of us 
lined up.
“Alright. 3, 2, 1,” I said. “ 
Go.”
It took him 3.36 seconds to 
beat me. He closed half the gap 
by the time we crossed mid-ice, 
and in the last few strides, he 
passed me, curling around with 
a smile.
“That all you need?” he 
asked.
Yeah, he had answered my 
question.

‘M’ keeps high energy

In its second game in 26 hours, 
the 
Michigan 
women’s 
field 
hockey team put up eight straight 
goals and shut out Michigan State 
in a dominating fashion.
The 
complete 
game 
was 
made impressive by the quick 
turnaround from its game a day 
prior. Michigan had only a day 
to rest, gameplan and prepare 
for Michigan State after its 1-0 
victory over Appalachian State on 
Saturday.
The team game-planned for 
the back-to-back matches to be 
ready for the Spartans the next 
day. Though the score was close 
Saturday, Pankratz stuck to the 
plan and kept rotating players to 
keep their legs fresh. It was part of 
her game design — everybody had 
to be balanced and rested for their 
important matchup the day after.
The Wolverines proved this 
strategy worked. There was zero 
hint of fatigue in Sunday’s outing. 
In fact, the opposite rang true, with 
the team buzzing with energy. 
The ninth-ranked Wolverines 
(8-3 overall, 2-1 Big Ten) routed 
the 24th-ranked Spartans (5-6 
Overall, 0-4 Big Ten), 8-0. The win 
included a hat trick by sophomore 
midfielder Sofia Southam and 
the first career goal for freshman 
midfielder Nina Apoola. 
Perhaps the most impressive 
thing about the match was the 
amount 
of 
energy 
Michigan 
brought from beginning to end. 
The 
Wolverines 
dominated 

possession 
by 
out-hustling 
Michigan 
State, 
resulting 
in 
multiple offensive opportunities 
and out-shooting their opponents, 
35-1.
Michigan consistently swarmed 
the Michigan State offense,rarely 
giving them an opportunity to 
control the ball. The Wolverine 
defense challenged the Spartans 
almost immediately every time 
they received the ball.
“Every game we have to come 
out with the same energy, and just 
really go from the start,” Apoola 
said. “Then we can get more goals 
and get more wins.”
Beginning games with high 
energy 
continues 
to 
be 
an 
important mission for Michigan. 
The Wolverines feel confident in 
their ability to win as long as they 
play hard for the full 60 minutes.
“We call it ‘60 in 60,’ ” said coach 
Marcia Pankratz. “We’re always 
striving to do that.”
This philosophy — giving full 
effort the entire match — led to 
the relentless attack deep into the 
match, with the final goal coming 
with just 21 seconds remaining in 
the fourth quarter. 
The 
strong 
finish 
in 
the 
energy-filled match is a good sign 
for Michigan and its ability to 
compete deeper into the season 
when back-to-back games become 
more common — including in the 
Big Ten Tournament.
The Wolverines, fourth in the 
conference, have shown their 
ability to stay fresh between games 
— an asset that will prove useful 
down the stretch.
