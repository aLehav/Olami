CENTRAL STUDENT!GOVERNMENT
Mirante key
to backroom
negotiations

Source: MForward
* VP candidate
struck deals to get
on ticket
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily Staff Reporter
As five students sought the
9 MForward presidential nomi-
nation, several candidates tried
to strike deals with each other
behind the scenes in order to get
endorsements and then limit
the fallout from the contested
nomination fight.
According to a source with
knowledge of the situation, who
wished to remain anonymous,
Mirante met with Public Policy
junior Kevin Mersol-Barg, the
OurMichigan party's candidate
for president, before Mersol-
Barg announced his candidacy.
During the meeting, he suppos-
edly offered Mersol-Barg -who
originally ran for the presiden-
tial nomination at <a href=
"http://michigandaily.com/
news/sathi-wins-mforward-
nomination">MForward's con-
vention</a> - a position on CSG
executive board in return for
Mersol-Barg not running for
CSG president against Aditya

Sathi, MForward's candidate
for president and LSA junior.
"Louis approached Kevin
and took him out for coffee,"
the source said. "(Mirante) fore-
saw the elections getting ugly
and offered (Mersol-Barg) an
executive position as an incen-
tive not to run against him and
Aditya."
The source was concerned
that such negotiations would
disrupt the election's democrat-
ic process, and are being used to
boost MForward's position in
the upcoming election.
"I feel like (MForward
members are) trying to use the
executive positions to lever-
age themselves to gain support
rather than giving everybody an
equal chance," the source said.
Mirante acknowledged that
he met with Mersol-Barg a week
after MForward's nomination
convention on Feb. 3, but denied
that he sought to strike a deal
with him.
"I didn't offer him a spot on
exec; it wasn't really my role,"
Mirante said. "I'mnot the presi-
dential candidate. I'm not the
person who makes those deci-
sions."
Mersol-Barg also acknowl-
edged the meeting, but said they
did not meet to discuss politics.

About 20 officers from the
University's Department of
Public Safety and the Ann Arbor

Police Department responded to
a small riot at South University
Avenue and Church Street just
past midnight on Sunday morn-
ing.
Bystanders said about 300
people were present as a group
of about 15 males jumped on top
of a car, smashing out its wind-
shield and windows before the
male driver was able to drive his
car away. The men reportedly

damaged two other cars as well.
Ann Arbor Police on the scene

Festival celebrates
heritage with
authentic art, food
By ANNA ROZENBERG
Daily StaffReporter
While many students chose
to engage in St. Patrick Day
debauchery this weekend, more
than 2,000 people came togeth-
er at Pioneer High School for the
40th Annual Ann Arbor Dance
for Mother Earth Powwow.

Forrest Cox, external co-
chair for the University's Native
American Student Associa-
tion and a member of the Prai-
rie Band Potawatomi tribe,
explained that Powwow aims
to feature Native artisans - pri-
marily invited from the Great
Lakes area this year - selling
merchandise and food, such
as authentic sweet bread. The
Powwow's main attraction is
the dance competition subdi-
vided into age groups, gender
and style.
"It's not a performance ... It's

not something you see in Hill
Auditorium," Cox said. "It's a
place where the audience can
be up and out of their seat and
involved."
Cox said while Powwow used
to be held on campus at Crisler
Arena, in recent years it has
moved off-campus to local high
schools, like Saline High School.
NASA organized the event at
Pioneer this year as a progres-
sive movement to hold the Pow-
wow closer to campus.

MSU student to sue Jimmy

Alexsandra Shalayko, a junior at
Michigan State University, plans to
sue Jimmy John's Gourmet Sand-
wiches after she contracted an E.
coli infection from clover sprouts in
a Turkey Tom sandwich sold at one
of the company's sandwich shops
in East Lansing, The State News
reported Thursday.
Shalayko tested positive for an E.
coli strain found in nine other cases

across Michigan and was hospi-
talized for three days after eating
the sandwich on Feb. 4. Mer attor-
ney, Drew Falkenstein, estimated
that the medical bills would reach
between $10,000 and $20,000.
Shalayko told the State News she
enjoys Jimmy John's, but is upset
that they didn't take the necessary
precautions to ensure consumer
safety.
"It's frustrating to see a com-
pany that we love isn't really giving
the love back," Shalayko said. "It
was a pretty harrowing experience
for me. I can only imagine how it
would be for somebody less fortu-
nate (without health insurance)."

High School student was in a
medically induced coma follow-
ing a weekend crash that injured
four other girls driving to watch
a basketball game at Michigan
State University.
The Grand Rapids Press
reported yesterday that 16-year-
old Brittney Olds was in stable
condition at a local hospital.
Seventeen-year-old Madison

Sunday, while 16-year-old Emily
Bogner was in serious condition.
The West Michigan girls were

Lansing to see the Grand Haven
girls' basketball team, which
won the state championship Sat-
urday.
BOURBON, Mo.
Killings of women,
kids investigated
as murder-suicide
The weekend killings of a
woman and three children at a
campground and resort in east-
ern Missouri was being investi-
gated Sunday as a possible triple
murder-suicide.
Crawford County Sheriff
Randy Martin told broadcaster
KSDK that investigators believe
the shootings happened Saturday
morning in a remote area along
a gravel road at the Blue Springs
Ranch & Resort and that the bod-
ies had been there for "hours"
when a guest found them at about
1 p.m.
Asked if he believes the woman
shot the three children and then
herself, Martin told the station,
"We don't know for sure, but it
kind of appears it could be that
way. But again the investigation is
still kind of early."
MONTEVIDEO. Uruguay
Nurses charged
with possibly
inducing deaths
An investigation into dozens
of possibly induced deaths at two
Uruguayan hospitals led to mur-
der charges being filed against
two nurses yesterday and a third
was charged with covering up a
crime, judicial officials said.
Earlier in the day, police
inspector Jose Luis Roldan said
officials suspected some hos-
pital workers brought a sort of
poison from Brazil and gave it
to patients who were in critical
condition at the two hospitals.
The South American country's
Public Health Ministry issued a
statement saying it was cooper-
ating with the investigation into
"presumed criminal acts linked
to the health area." It gave no
details about the allegations,

but said it was conducting its
own investigation and expressed
"profound concern."
CARACAS, Venezuela
Chilean diplomat's
daughter shot by
Venezuelan police
The killing of a Chilean dip-
lomat's teenage daughter by
police is reigniting concerns
among Venezuelans about exces-
sive force by officers and their
alleged involvement in rampant
violent crime.
Nineteen-year-old Karen
Berendique was riding in a vehi-
cle with her older brother and
another young man when police
at a checkpoint opened fire early
Saturday in the western city of
Maracaibo, said her father Fer-
nando Berendique, Chile's hon-
orary consul in the city.
He said they ignored a police
command to stop, fearing the
officers might be robbers.
Berendique's father told
reporters on Saturday that his
daughter had been on the way to
see some friends when she was
shot.

they ordered them closed at
about 1 a.m., police said.
DPS spokeswoman Diane
Brown said DPS does not
have jurisdiction in the area
where the riot occurred, but
responded to the riot to assist
the AAPD. University officers
appeared to mostly be assigned
to traffic duties, blocking off
South University, while most-
ly AAPD officers dealt with
crowd control. About 10 of the
responding officers were Uni-
versity Police.
Mike Gradillas, general man-
ager of The Blue Leprechaun,
said his staff was concerned
that disorderly crowds outside
the bar could cause a problem.
"We were really scared
(something like this would hap-
pen)," Gradillas said.
Gradillas said South Univer-
sity was packed with people

rick's Day festivities, and he

the years that followed, students

officers on campus.
Another prominent issue
Duderstadt said he faced as
University President was con-
fronting a rowdy Greek commu-
nity that faced reports of sexual
harassment and dangerous lev-
els of drinking. He eventually
met with leaders in the Greek
community and asked them to
bring their students in accor-
dance with University stan-
dards, he added.
"I must say ... the challenge
was picked up by the fraternities,
and it led a new spirit of respon-
sible behavior and discipline," he
said.
Duderstadt said the most
important issue he confronted
while University President was
increasing diversity on campus.
After the passage of the
Michigan Mandate in 1970
established a commitment to
increased representation of
minorities within the Univer-
sity, Duderstadt said the Uni-
versity has continued to make
diversity on campus a priority.
He emphasized the numerous
programs on campus that aim
to increase inclusion of minori-
ties, including restructured
financial-aid programs designed
to make higher education more
accessible to less advantaged
students.
Duderstadt said this effort to
increase diversity started under
Fleming, following two large
student uprisings demanding
change, and continued under
Duderstadt's tenure.
"We made certain that this
was one of the highest priorities
of the University," he said.
Duderstadt added that by

The event also hosted a num-
ber of speakers, including Bunky
Echo Hawk - a Pawnee and
Yakima artist who designed the
N7 shoe line for Nike, which
correlates to a seven-generation
intertribal idea.
"This is my favorite thing to
do," Echo Hawk said. "Live art
where I'm able to travel all over
the country and do art all over
universities ... in tribal and non-
tribal communities."
Echo Hawk described how his
work is based off traditional hide
paintings with an updated, mod-
ern twist. He painted during the
grand entry Saturday afternoon
and presented the picture later to
attendees later that day.
Echo Hawk said he comes
from aline of artistson both sides
of his family who "passed cultur-
al knowledge down" to him.
"When (Cox) told me about
(the Powwow), it felt significant,"
Echo Hawk said. "40 years really

"They definitely handled it

Eastern Michigan Univer-
sity senior Joe Banks, who said
he was punched in the face
during the fight, said police did
not respond to the riot imme-
diately.
"It went on for like 20 min-
utes before the cops got there,"
Banks said. "It was crazy."
LSA junior Jen Mulligan and
LSA sophomore Paul Sykula
were collecting donations for
Dance Marathon at the cor-
ner of South University and
East University. Though they
couldn't see the riot from where
they were, Mulligan said people
were unusually disorderly.
"Usually this is a good time
to get money, people are gener-
ous," Mulligan said. "But they
were just beyond incoherent."
-Editor in Chief Joseph
Lichterman contributed
to this report.
1996, there had been a 62-percent
increase in African American
enrollment, with corresponding
increases in enrollment of other
minorities as well. He noted that
more than half of the executive
officers at the University were
African American by the time he
stepped down in 1996.
He said the movement to
increase diversity on campus
showcases the importance of
student activism.
"(This) provides an excellent
example of how important stu-
dent activism is in shaping the
evolution of the University in a
highly strategic and important
way," Duderstadt said.
Social Work student Kristen
Bauman said she was interested
in coming to the event to learn
about the history of activism at
the University.
"(0 came to) hear (Duder-
stadt's) passion about the history
of the University and how activ-
ism can be incorporated into the
curriculum ... and learned out-
side of the classroom," Bauman
said.
Bauman added that she
agreed with Duderstadt's belief
that students are less active now
than in previous generations.
"I think Duderstadt was right
when he said that our generation
(has) become more apathetic
to social justice," she said.
Business junior Ryan Strauss
echoed Bauman, saying he came
to the lecture to gain a more in
depth historical outlook of activ-
ism on campus.
"It was definitely interesting
gaining a broader perspective of
the issues thathave been focused
on historically at the University,"
Strauss said. "(It) shed a new
light on what students could be
focused on today."
-Due to his participation in
the event, Editor in Chief Joseph
Lichterman did not edit this article.

"(Fancy) is more of a contem-
porary style dance," Burridge
said. "It's a crowd pleaser ...

(with) cartwheels, flips."
Though it was Burridge's first
time visiting Michigan, he said
he has been dancing for 19 years,
since the age of 2.
"Gotta practice, stay at it," he
said. "Just dance your hardest,
dance your heart out."
Vendors at the event had a
plethora of crafts, art and cloth-
ing for sale. Mildred Hill, a mem-
ber of the Mohawk tribe, said she
learned her craft from friends
and neighbors. Hill mainly sells
hand-beaded hair ornaments
and accessories, and has been on
the "Powwow trail" for 40 years,
where she dedicates a substantial
amount of time to her craft.

"First she decorates the ring,
then I put the web on it, then
she puts the string on it, then she
puts the beads on it, then she puts

"Every color we put out there we
know is something special for
somebody."

MFORWARD

Rather, they were coming back
from an extra-credit event for a
class and that the conversation
"happened to turn to party poli-
tics."
Mersol-Barg did say that his
future with MForward and the
executive branch was discussed.
"(Mirante) was very much
interested in me playing a role in
their respective or hypothetical
administration, but I don't know
exactly what that would have
looked like," Mersol-Bargsaid.
Mersol-Barg also said no deal
was made, though he was lauded
for his potential as an executive
candidate.
"He didn't offer a position out-
right," Mersol-Barg said. "I do
recall that he mentioned some-
thing about how I would be a
good candidate for an executive
position ... butI don't really know
if it was a quid pro quo proposi-
tion."
Mirante approached LSA
junior Aditya Sathi, MForward's
presidential candidate, and LSA
sophomore Omar Hashwi, an
independent candidate for vice
president, and attempted to bar-
gain with them before MFor-
ward's nomination convention,
according to the source.
Sathi and Hashwi ran in
MForward's nomination con-
vention for president in January.
Mirante was originally on the
ballot for the nomination, but did
not decide to run.
The source added that Sathi
and Haswhi sought to strike
a deal with Mirante that if he
didn't run against them at the
MForward convention, he could
automatically become the vice
presidential candidate with who-
ever won the nomination.
Mirante acknowledged that
he had met with both Sathi and
Hashwi before the convention,
but denied any intentions to
negotiate with them for the vice
presidency.
"With most of the stuff that

is said in student government,
there is at least a kernel of truth
to everything," Mirante said. "I
did speak with Aditya, and I did
speak with Omar, but it wasn't
exactly the bargaining situation."
Mirante said he did not seek
out any of the candidates, but
that he was approached by
Sathi, Hashwi and Mersol-Barg
at different points before the
MForward convention, noting
he withdrew a week before the
event - a move that was com-
mon knowledge inside the party,
and led to offers of potential vice
president candidacies.
"I had made it public that I
was not a contender for the spot
just through word of mouth, and
I was approached by Aditya Sathi
who sat me down, explained
his platform, asked for my sup-
port and offered me the spot of
vice president, were he to win,"
Mirante said.
Sathi, Hashwi and Mersol-
Barg all expressed an interest in
Mirante as their running mate
at the pre-convention meetings,
Mirante said. While Mirante
said the candidates offered posi-
tions, he didn't request anything
of them.
On the day of the convention,
Mirante said he met with Hashwi
to discuss his platform.
"I told Omar that I wasn't will-
ing to support him at that time
but that I would accept the vice
presidential nomination were he
to offer it to me," Mirante said.
"There wasn't really a bargain-
ing situation there."
Hashwi said no plans were
finalized at their meeting, but
they both felt that Mirante
would be a mutually beneficial
choice as a running mate.
"(Mirante) said that he would
be interested in being my vice
president if I won," Hashwi said.
"I considered it ... I was inter-
ested in Louis potentially being a
vice president."
That day, Mirante also met
with Mersol-Barg, who was still
seeking the MForward nomina-
tion.
"I was also offered the posi-

tion of vice president of Kevin's
campaign were he to win, which
I also accepted," Mirante said.
Nonetheless, Mirante said
he only accepted hypothetical
offers, not binding agreements.
Sathi, Hashwi and Mersol-
Barg acknowledged that they
had met with Mirante and that
no sort of deal had been struck,
but Sathi and Mersol-Barg both
said they would never offer a
position to anyone before the
election.
"Before the convention, there
were people ... trying to figure
out 'if you vote for me, I'll make
you this position,"' Mersol-Barg
said. "I have never done that
kind of thing."
Sathi similarly said he was
approached with potential deals.
"I'm not promising things to
anybody," Sathi said. "That's
not something I'm interested in
doing whatsoever."
Instead of offering him a
vice-presidential candidacy,
Sathi said he asked Mirante if
he would "consider being on the
ticket," and said Mirante said he
would consider the offer.
The source also said an execu-
tive position was promised by
Sathi to Sean Walser, the chair
of the CSG External Relations
Commission and the chair of
MForward. The executive posi-
tion would have been a new posi-
tion created by Sathi that would
act as liaison to local, state and
federal governments.
"In their platform they have a
position for an outreach director
and that position is supposed to
go Sean Walser," the source said.
"Apparently he was told this
before the nominating conven-
tion even happened."
Sathi said he does plan to
establish a director of govern-
mental affairs executive posi-
tion, but that he never promised
it to Walser, who also denied that
Sathi promised him any execu-
tive position.
"People say things, everybody
says things," Sathi said. "It's a
campaign. It's an emotionally
driven thought process."

An unwil'ing! compromise
Detroit's consent agreement isn't a viable fix
Another theoretical solution for Detroit's financial woes was
announced last week with Republican Gov. Rick Snyder's
proposed consent agreement plan. This plan would keep
power within the local leadership, and it comes in direct contrast
to appointing an emergency manager from outside of the execu-
tive system, which the state has done in other cities in Michigan.
The issue with keeping local leadership is that it fails to generate
any substantial systematic change and favors the status quo. The
consent agreement is a short-term solution that doesn't address any
long-term financial changes - the kind Detroit needs to pull itself
out of its financial emergency.

FROM THE PUBLIC EDITOR|I
Reports and rumors

From reading The Michigan
Daily last week, I learned
that a local cab driver is a
rapist. It's just
an allegation IMRAN
for now, based SYED
upon "murmur-
ings" within Public Editor
sororities, but
details like that are usually lost
in the midst when news breaks.
The Daily story didn't reveal the
accused cabbie's name, so natural-
ly, I have to assume it could be any
and every cab driver in Ann Arbor.
And that makes me scared for my
friends.
OK, that's an exaggeration,
but the story in question does
lead nicely into a discussion on
the challenges of covering break-
ing news - stories that, like this
one, are important to readers, but
have yet to reveal all of their facts.
These challenges, like most oth-
ers, are somewhat multiplied at
a student publication because of
one important fact: while news
happens all the time, Daily report-
ers, no matter how dedicated, are
not full-time journalists. Instead,
they must always balance the sig-
nificant additional responsibilities
of being college students with full
course loads.
Back at the Daily's editor in
chief election of 2007 (the last one
I attended), there was a lot of talk
aboutturningthe Daily's newsroom
into a 24-hour operation. The Daily
staffers who were in the room that
evening could be forgiven for their
ambition: they had been, after all,
witnesses to and participants in a
pivotal time in the history of this
paper. More perhaps than any other
group before them, they had presid-
ed over an explosion of technology

and social media that expanded the
role and reach of this paper. Pod-
casting, blogs, a useable, redesigned
web interface and even the Daily's
Facebook page all arose in the three
to four years preceding that 2007
Daily election. A 24-hour news-
room didn't seem like that crazy of
an idea.
But some senior editors like me,
old hands ontheir way out, had res-
ervations. We questioned if such a
push toward ubiquity might have
significant drawbacks. My own
background in the opinion and arts
sections, both of which are more
about depth of analysis than actual
"news," made me question the con-
cept of a 24-hour newsroom more
than most. Wouldn't the quality
of our product have to be harmed
to achieve such a goal? The focus
of the Daily, I argued, should be
producing five great papers a week
- not covering every story and fol-
lowing every lead as it breaks.
Looking back over the five years
since that election, it seems that
the 24-hour newsroom view has
mostly won the day. While the
Daily doesn't run a full, as-it-hap-
pens news website, significant sto-
ries (especially sports stories) are
often posted online before a more-
detailed version appears in print
the next day. More than that, the
Daily's news and sports blogs post
content several times every day,
and at all hours of the day.
But the concern about the draw-
backs of releasing content constant-
ly, as opposed to only in measured
and refined bites comprising a Daily
print edition, is one that deserves
some renewed attention. Obvi-
ously, the Daily must find a line for
the level of refinement for its blog
content. Daily style and grammati-

cal correctness are often sacrificed
in such content, but perhaps the
benefits of it still outweigh these
minor drawbacks. The real issue
to address though is in the realm
of breaking news: how do you bal-
ance the "need to know" issue with
the drawbacks of printing a story
before all the facts are known?
The cab driver story - though
I'm not sure I would have printed
it - skillfully negotiated this bal-
ance. The accused's name was not
disclosed, and the reasons for this
were explained to the reader. The
writer clearly indicated the source
of the story, pointed out incon-
sistencies in the narrative, clari-
fied that no charges had yet been
filed and got comments from the
accused man. Still, the fact that
none of the key players involved
in starting the story (the alleged
victim, the author of the e-mail,
members of the relevant sorority,
etc.) chose to speak to the reporter,
even off the record, is a factor that
weighs against printing the story
at all.
What comes of the story remains
to be seen. It may be that the Daily
took a significant first step in draw-
ing attention to a true danger that
students should be aware of. It is
also possible that the Daily printed
a mere rumor that ultimately turns
out false. Such is often the challenge
of breaking news. And experience,
I'm afraid, is the only real teacher.

The consent agreement plans to grant
increased power to Detroit's executive
branch. Snyder theorizes that this would
"have the city running the city," allowing
current leadership the opportunity to make
the cuts they deem absolutely necessary. By
doing so, the agreement not only eradicates
the authority of the Detroit City Council as a
bargaining organization, but it also prevents
contact between the city and the unions rep-
resenting city employees. The agreement
length is indefinite, as well as irreversible
and uncompromising without allowing chal-
lenges from outside the committee.
The plan fails to make anyone happy, an
important truth in the context of relying on
teamwork and cooperation within the execu-
tive branch. Detroit Mayor Dave Bing and
Snyder have been arguing over the intricacies,
which seems to indicate that whatever the
result of the plan, both sides will be uncompro-
mising. The public fighting coming from both
sides reveals how tension between current
leadership could lead to the imminent failure
of a plan dependent on both sides' cooperation.
The sides would be better suited to fix the prob-
lems at hand than seemingly using it as an issue

going into election season.
The proposal will grant most of the powerto
the state, with six out of nine positions allotted
to Snyder appointees. Though Bing will have
the powers of emergency financial manager,
the plan seems like another ultimatum effort
by Snyder. Bing must either accept the plan
or be under constant threat by the otherwise
appointed emergency financial manager.
From any perspective, this consent agree-
ment isn't and can't be a long-term solution
to the financial woes. The issue is not con-
trol so much as tax revenue and purely the
money needed for essential services. Rather
than looking to institute cuts, Detroit should
look toward generating income. Regional tax
sharing would offer an opportunity to guar-
antee yearly revenue necessary for domestic
services. People are leavingthe city itself, not
the region, so a regional tax could generate
civil income.
The consent agreement would only pro-
ceed to throw democracy out the window,
creating political feuding and executive
tyranny. Detroit needs substantial change,
change that is not created by increasing reli-
ance on the status quo.

Clothes for change

About 7,000 high school students will drop
out of school in America today. Unfortunately,
today is not a special day or some sort of orga-
nized movement. No, instead today is just
another normal day that contributes to the
more than 1.2 million high school dropouts
per year in the United States.
With rising costs in tuition and lower
incomes, fewer people are able to afford a col-
lege education. And yet, a college education
has never been more important. According to
the U.S. Census Bureau, a person with a bach-
elor's degree earned an average of $58,613 in
2008, while those with a high school diploma
earned $31,283. Unfortunately, the impor-
tance of an education also has serious societal
effects. High school dropouts are eight times
more likely to go to prison and are 50 percent
less likely to vote. We, as a society, are able to
advance by allowing more people to attain a
college education.
Sadly, America is becoming a land of lim-
ited opportunities for some. Take Michigan
for example. African-American males in this
state have the lowest high school graduation
rate in the country at 33 percent. Though
insufficient primary education is mostly to
blame for this startling statistic, a lack of
motivation toward a clear-cut goal is a pivotal
reason that these youths are able to achieve so
little. Due to economic restraints or a number
of other reasons, these disadvantaged teenag-
ers are never even given the chance to seize an
educational opportunity.
All too often we learn about important
issues that spark our interest, yet forget about
them soon after we close our computer or
put down the newspaper. We can't forget the
importance that education has on our society.
So what can you do to help? Luckily, there is a
company that not only helps fund educational
opportunities for underprivileged youth, but
also uses fashion to advocate for this impor-

tant message.
Merit is not a normal fashion brand. Though
the stylish flat brim hats, shirts or sleek logo
may appear to be like any other trendy cloth-
ing line, the brand stands for so much more.
Merit creates fashion forward products that
help committed, disadvantaged youth attain a
college education. Twenty percent of its rev-
enue provides college scholarships for under-
served youth. For every dollar you spend on a
new hoodie, T-shirt or any other Merit prod-
uct, 20 cents will go straight toward helping
an underprivileged youth accomplish some-
thing they would have otherwise never been
able to attain: a college degree.
In the coming months, the Merit website
will allow people to buy products online and
help contribute to this important cause. Right
now, Merit is looking to expand its commu-
nity by enlisting as many new members to the
Merit family as possible. Go online to www.
meritgoodness.com and you can join the Merit
community and learn more about the impor-
tance of education and how you can sign up
to receive discounts and other offers once the
retail website goes live.
Rarely do we get to infuse fashion into
helping a cause much larger than ourselves.
By becoming a member of the Merit commu-
nity and buying a Merit product, you will be
able to wear a brand that stands for so much
more than mere clothing. All Merit products
will be recognizable with the Merit badge.
This badge symbolizes not only the incredible
effort that you have become a part of, but also
the community and the family that Merit has
become. Others will simply see trendy clothes,
but you'll know that what may be a flashy hat
for some is the opportunity to gain a future for
another.

The current state of our University's Central Student
Government is something to be bemoaned. Instead of
being led by pragmatists dedicated to governing and
improving campus life; isolationism and political zeal-
otry currently consume our elected representatives
and shroud CSG in a haze of unrealistic idealism and
vague promises of transformational change far inac-
cessible to the average student. CSG has lost its funda-
mental principles and it has lost its focus. It's time for
students across campus to take CSG back.
There are six candidates for president and vice
president this year, and each is claiming to bring big
change to the CSG - but how can we trust such a state-
ment? Every year that I have attended the University,
there have been calls for change at CSG. Every year we
may gain some change from a few individuals on the
3rd floor of the Union, but for the most part the actual
achievements of CSG representatives fall short of their
vague or foolhardy promises to the voters during cam-
paigns. The reason they fall short on their promises is
not that their intentions were bad or that their ideas
were bad, but that they failed to recognize CSG's prac-
tical limits, and more importantly, failed to recognize
where the strengths of a student government lie.
One of the largest services at CSG dedicated directly
to the enhancement of student life is the Student Orga-
nization Funding Commission. The commission is not
perfect, but as a vice-chair of SOFC I can honestly say
that the change we have seen this year with the new roll-
ing funding system would have been impossible without
the vision, guidance and assiduous leadership of CSG
Treasurer Shreya Singh. Shreya has been instrumental
in the new rolling funding system, which has allowed
an unprecedented number of student organizations to
receive unprecedented amounts of funding to bring the
level of campus involvement and leadership to a higher
standard. With more opportunities to apply for funding
than ever before, student organizations are putting on
more events and engaging more students in activism,
community service, culture, concerts, art, academia,
sports, community building and movements of social
justice. They are bringing in speakers and performers,
and sending out students to other schools and states to
represent the leaders and best with pride.
This is the strength of the student government: its
students. Contrary to claims by some candidates, CSG
cannot take on the administration or Lansing alone,
but with the leadership of Shreya Singh, Ethan Hahn
and the youMICH party, CSG will use its resources
and brilliant minds to help facilitate real opportunities
for students to do things like engage the administra-

tion in fireside talks or combat the effects of higher
tuition through streamlined financial aid information.
We cannot and should not expect the student govern-
ment or individual candidates to get the constitution
of the state of Michigan amended in order to place a
student regent on the University's Board of Regents.
Nor should we expect our student leaders to be able
to overturn decades of legal and legislative precedents
to offer illegal immigrants in-state tuition. All can-
didates in this election obviously support the idea of
greater student representation and involvement, but
putting these lofty goals and issues at the forefront of
your agenda distracts the student government from
actually achieving something real and tangible for stu-
dents on campus.
Others have claimed that the youMICH party's
plans plans are "small". I would instead describe
them as focused. I would describe them as pragmatic.
Big change in the student government, the Univer-
sity administration or in the state of Michigan will
not come from applying the same political nonsense
through the same rhetoric that we have seen over and
over again at CSG, but rather through realistic, prag-
matic goals that the Central Student Government can
actually pursue to engage students in these issues. And
the best way to create change on campus is for CSG to
empower students and student organizations to be the
ones to create that change.
As SOFC vice-chair, I would like to encourage stu-
dent leaders on campus to carefully review each can-
didate's plans toward student organization funding.
The CSG student organization funding process is a
critical component of CSG's impact and benefit to
campus. Blanket statements to "improve" or "reform"
student organization funding, or even proposals for a
one-size-fits-all "common app" for funding should be
strongly questioned, and changes proposed by parties
that include such language could easily result in stu-
dent organizations facing gaps in funding or seriously
delayed turnover in decisions. With their experience,
Shreya Singh and Ethan Hahn comprise the team with
the most knowledge and experience with the funding
system, best prepared to make changes that actually
function to service the students. If you no longer wish
to accept the same old large and disconnected promis-
es, vote youMICH and vote for Shreya Singh and Ethan
Hahn for CSG this March 21-22 - use your vote to put
the "student" back into student government.

Research team analyzes
impact of Hsp33 protein

Findings recently
published in
prominent science
publication
By ANNA ROZENBERG
Daily Staff Reporter
Chaperones aren't just the
awkward adults at your high-
school dance, but also a type of
protein that University faculty
are starting to better scientifi-
cally understand.
Biology Prof. Ursula Jakob
and a team of collaborators
comprise a study that exam-
ines chaperone protein Hsp33,
which the team specifically
investigated in bacteria. The
study has been going on over
the course of the past four
years, and they recently had
their paper published in Cell, a
renowned biology journal.
The function of chaperone
proteins is to help other pro-
teins function, and until Jakob's
study, the way in which Hsp33
work in bacteria was unknown.
She said the implications for
studies on such proteins are cru-
cially important, since all mod-
ern life relies on the function of
proteins to carry out basic pro-
cesses in cells to survive.
Jakob said when any cell in
any organism encounters stress-
es like a fever or viral infection,
its proteins start to denature,
or lose the structure that they
need to function properly.
"Not only do they lose activ-
ity, but what's worse, they start
to want to form aggregates,"
Jakob said. "This is very toxic
for the cell. The reason it's so
toxic is it's irreversible."
Jakob said this conglomera-
tion is similar to an egg boil-
ing, beginning in a liquid form
before turning solid through
the boiling process. Jakob and
her team discovered how Hsp33
prevents protein inside bacte-
ria cells from hardening when
under attack by stressors, spe-
cifically bleach.
"This is important because
we produce bleach in our body,"
Jakob said. "Our white blood
cells produce bleach to kill off
bacteria."
Jakob and her team found
that when bleach activates

Hsp33, it actually unfolds, los-
ing some of its structure before
interacting with other proteins.
"In contrast to all the other
proteins which unfold and lose
their function, Hsp33 needs
this unfolding to gain its func-
tion," Jakob said. "This is very
contrary to what has been in
the textbooks for many, many
years."
Until this study, it was a well-
known theory that proteins lose
function when they lose their
structure, according to Jakob.
However, because Hsp33 does
the opposite, the new find-
ings seem to be a revolutionary
exception to the rule, she said.
"(Hsp33) uses the flexibility
it gets because it loses part of
its structure to really embrace
and mold itself around other
proteins that are unfolding
and thus preventing them from
interacting with other unfold-
ing proteins and forming those
aggregates," Jakob said.
Jakob explained that the sec-
ond part of the study involved
discovering what happens once
the stressor is gone, and how
the partially unfolded proteins
regain their structure so they
can again perform functions
required for the bacteria to live.
"Ideally, the client needs to
gain back its structure to func-
tion again, because we want to
survive the stress condition, not
just endure it," Jakob said.
Jakob and her team found
that when the stressful condi-
tions dissipate, Hsp33 pulls the
client protein farther apart.
This conformational change
allows the client protein to be
available for another class of
chaperone proteins that will
refold them to their active state,
according to Jakob.
"In general, it's a mechanism
for how bacteria defend them-
selves against stress - stress
that they encounter when they
invade us," Jakob said. "It's a
very clever strategy these bac-
teria have developed because
it's so instantaneous."
Though chaperone proteins
like Hsp33 are found mainly
in bacteria, they also appear in
some unicellular, eukaryotic
parasites like Trypanosoma
that causes sleeping sickness,
Jakob said. Ultimately, she said
her team hopes to use their
findings for drug design against

such diseases.
"If we understand how they
defend themselves, we can
understand how to attack them
better," she said.
Dana Reichmann, research
fellow in the Department of
Biology and another author of
the paper, further explained the
significance of the discoveries
regarding Hsp33.
"We knew it's important for
bacteria, but we didn't really
know the mechanism for the
protection," Reichmann said.
Reichmann said Hsp33 acts
like Play-Doh in its flexibility,
binding to the proteins at risk
from stress in order to protect
them.
"There is really nice struc-
tural interplay with the chaper-
ones and the substrate ... They
affect the conformation of each
other which enables further
release of the protein," Reich-
mann said.
Reichmann also highlighted
that before their research, it
was unclear how Hsp33 acted
without any added Adenyl tri-
phosphate energy - the prima-
ry energy source produced and
used by the human body.
"It's really one of the first
chaperones which are not
ATP-dependent chaperones,"
Reichmann said. "Up to now, it
was unclear how these types of
chaperones were working ... it
brings another mechanism to
different types of chaperones,
not necessarily the ones we
know."
Reichmann said there are
homologous proteins found in
plants, and more studies relat-
ing to Hsp33 and similar chap-
erone proteins are in the works,
noting that this study is just the
beginning.
"To look at chaperones and
parasites and look at how we
can target them ... this will be

"As a faculty member, we take
great pride in the opportunity to
mold and help launch the careers
in medicine of these talented
young men and women," Wool-
liscroft said.
A ceremony filled with mixed
emotions of joy, relief and hys-
teria followed the lunch ban-
quet during which each student
shared their placement on stage.
Rajesh Mangrulkar, associate
dean for medical student educa-
tion, said he finds it very exciting
to see students embark on the
next stage of their professional
career.
"It's also a day that many of
our students choose to share

er to celebrate this important
step for them."
Mangrulkar said when he was
a medical student, Match Day
was a mixture of relief, nervous
anticipation and exuberance.
"For the first time, they will be
practicing physicians in the field
they have chosen - and nowthey
know where that will be," Man-
grulkar said.
Mangrulkar added that the
day was very dramatic for many
of the students who will be mov-
ing to a brand new city with a
new medical culture.
"Imagine not knowing where
you are going to live one minute,
and then opening up an envelope
and knowing exactly where you
have to live," Mangrulkar said.
Mangrulkar reminded stu-
dents that the profession will

provide numerous challenges in
theirthree to sevenyear residen-
cy placements.
"Our patients really need
change agents to go out and
improve their health, through
clinical care, research and edu-
cation," Mangrulkar said. "Build
on your wonderful foundation
from U-M, and never forget why
you went into medicine in the
first place."
Medical student Hela Issaq,
who received the Harold Kes-
sler, M.D. Scholarship award in
December 2011 for her commit-
ment to the principles of fam-
ily medicine, said she is thrilled
about receiving residency train-
ing in the Department of Fam-
ily Medicine at Harbor-UCLA in
Harbor City, CA.
"I was emotional because I
had thought about this day for
the past four years and it was
finally here," Issaq said. "I knew
that I wanted to do family medi-
cine even before I started medi-
cal school and my dream was
coming true."
Issaq added that she is also
elated to be the first female
Afghan-American medical stu-
dent to graduate from the Uni-
versity's medical school.
Medical student Ian May said
in some respects, the name of the
hospital placed inside the small
white envelope represents the
sum of an individual's medical
achievements thus far.
"I had a jumble of feelings,
excitement, foreboding, ner-
vousness all rolled into one,"
May said. "In hindsight, it seems
a little strange that such a thing
could produce such a combina-
tion of anxiety and elation."
May will spend his residency
training for emergency medicine
at Madigan Army Medical Cen-
ter in Tacoma, Wash.
A tradition of the University's

Match Day includes students
using pins to pinpoint their
placement site on a map of the
United States.
Medical student Eric Tannen-
baumplacedhispinonAnnArbor
as his residence in orthopedic
surgery will be at the University
of Michigan Health System.
"My first choice was Michi-
gan. When I opened the envelope
and got Michigan as my match, it
felt as ifa 50 pound weight was
lifted off my chest," Tannen-
baum said.
He added that he was nervous
about where he and his fiancae
would be spending their lives for
the next five years. Upon discov-
ering he was placed in Ann Arbor,
he said it was the first moment he
was able to truly relax as a medi-
cal student.
While29 percentofgraduating
students will remain at the Uni-
versity for their residency, other
graduates were placed at institu-
tions in 22 states acrossthe coun-
try, including Washington D.C.,
California and New York, accord-
ingto a UMHS release.
The release also indicated that
99 percent of graduating medi-
cal students were able to obtain
a placementthis year, puttingthe
University 5 percent above the
national average.
The placements were deter-
mined by the National Resident
Matching Program, a not-for-
profit corporation thatuses auni-
formed process to place 16,000
medical students at residency
sites each year.
Each placement site submits
a list of applicants in the order
of preference and each appli-
cant will also rank his or her site
preferences. Then, a computer
program will compare the lists
against each other and deter-
mine the most appropriate place-
ment.

ing theater, offering constructive
criticism ina small-scale-produc-
tion environment.
This year's Playfest willinclude
six dramatic readings, one per-
formed every day of the upcom-
ing week, starting tonight. From
School of Music, Theatre & Dance
sophomore Ben Blackman's
existential "Think Tank," to the
"Peter Pan"-inspired "What's
Heaven For?" written by LSA
sophomore Michael Toner, the
variety of plays this year demon-
strates the range of student play-
wrights at the 'U.'
Preparation for Playfest begins
with Theatre & Drama Prof.
OyamO (a.k.a. Charles F. Gordon)
selecting six student-playwrights
from playwrighting courses
whose work seems ready to be
taken a step further. He invites
these writers to enroll in The-
atre 429: "Playwriting Towards
Production," a course designed
to help students understand their

Six dramatic readings will be performed this week for Playfest 20t2.

work as an object to be produced,
resulting in professional readings
during the weeklong Playfest.
"The process begins with one
full class devoted entirely to a
single student's play, since the
class is three hours long," OyamO
explained. "We doa reading there
in class, and then we discuss that
play, looking for areas requiring
improvement. Then the writer
goes back and continues to make
alterations and work on the play."
In Theatre 429, students with
differentareasoftheatricalexper-
tise and concentration-focus are
given the chance to work collab-
oratively on something creative,
separate from the usual control of
a professor.
Through discussions and
rehearsed readings, the six play-
wrights' shows are workshopped
and revised in the class. Student
directors prepare to direct these
works, and the rest of the class
supports the festival in other
ways as actors, audition monitors
and promoters.
"I also invite people who are
actors and directors because we
need them too," OyamO said.
"Essentially, what we do in class
is we try to fully develop every
aspect, as well as each story, fur-

ther."
An important part of Playfest
is the post-show dialogue that
occurs between the playwright
and the audience. These com-
ments are meant to augment and
assist each piece from the per-
spective of a viewer.
"The idea is that this read-
ing will give people enough of
an idea of the kind of play (the
students) have written," OyamO
said. "When the audience has a
feedback session after, they can
respond to the play and the prin-
ciples of the course."
And for the first time, there
is a monetary prize that will be
awarded at the end of Playfest's
run this year.
"Theater is not a guaranteed
paycheck or income; it's some-
thing that you do because you
love to do it," OyamO said. "And
if you're fortunate enough to earn
a living off of it, then that's great.
People in the arts are always going
to have greater difficulty turning
that passion into a living, though."
That being said, courses taught
at such a professional level, as
well as Playfest itself, may offer
a glimpse of realistic production
values and what it takes to survive
in such an industry.

Exhausted? You're not alone.
Hearing any show's title called
out that many times in one
awards ceremony would make
me uneasy, because it means
other deserving shows are prob-
ably being ignored.
Don't get me wrong - when
"Modern Family" first came
out, I was instantly smitten. But
lately, I've been finding more and
more reasons to complain about
the show. Let's put the Emmy
topic aside, since I don't wish to
discuss whether it deserved its
endless wins. The absurd lack of
nominations year after year for
"Community" and "Parks and
Recreation" is enough proof that
the Academy of Television Arts
& Sciences is woefully wrong
when it comes to recognizing
television's best comedies, and I
would hate to beat a dead horse
(it's probably too soon to make a
"Luck" joke, right?).
Instead, let's focus on how
"Modern Family" is fooling
itself and its viewers. As the title
and many of the themes sug-
gest, "Modern Family" wants
so desperately to be a progres-
sive movement, a champion of

- BEAT(EN BY) OHIO
Michigan 60
Ohio 65
By BEN ESTES
Daily Sports Editor
-, NASHVILLE, Tenn. - A faint redness showed
in the eyes of Stu Douglass, an early trace of the
tears that would soon be shed.
For four years, those eyes - intense, perhaps,
yet so unassuming, so innocent - seemed to
promise to Douglass's opponents that the man
who wore them was not a basketball player to be
feared, lulling them into a false sense of security
before Douglass suddenly drained a 3-pointer or
surprised with an acrobatic layup.
At this moment, those eyes, opened wide in
Y-C & numbness, were locked on the shot clock above
his team's basket. The red numbers read triple
zeros, and they told Douglass that it had all come
to an end.
On Friday night, in an upset - which so typifies
the NCAA Tournament - the four-seed Michi-
gan basketball team fell to 13-seed Ohio, 65-60,
in Nashville. The Wolverines exit the Big Dance
in the second round without winning a game, the
first time that has happened in the four tourna-
y ment appearances during Michigan coach John
Beilein's tenure.
k "I was just trying to hold it in, make it to the
locker room," Douglass said. "I was just kind of in
a state of disbelief. I'm still in it."
Call it a Cinderella-style upset if you want, but
it was clear from the beginning that Ohio didn't
see itself as an underdog by any stretch of the
imagination.

large game
against Western Michgian
loomed, and this one wasn't just
for the CCHA Tournament title,
but also a chance for revenge
after last year's drubbing at
the hands of the Broncos in the
semifinals.
On Saturday, the Wolver-
ines' actions spoke louder than

words.
For the second straight year,
Western Michgian ended the
Wolverines' hopes for a ninth
CCHA Tournament Champi-
onship at Joe Louis Arena, this
time by a score of 3-2.
"Let's face it, we're not that
good," said Michigan coach Red
Berenson. "We're not any better
than anybody else, but I don't
think we're any worse than any-
one else. We're right there."
Western Michigan ordered
a constant assault on Michigan
fifth-year senior goalie Shawn
Hunwick, and exploited the
weakest part in his game. Mich-
igan surrendered three unan-
swered goals through the first
two periods, and all three goals
came off of rebounds.
Late in the first period, Ian
Slater tapped in a rebound on

a shot by J.J. Crew to put the
Broncos on the board.
In the second, Dane Walters
knocked in a loose puck after
another rebound for a power-
play goal. Chase Balisy added
yet another rebound goal later
in the second period to give the
Broncos a commanding three-
goal lead heading into the final
frame.
"(Hunwick) has a way of
placing his rebounds, where he
places them where he wants to,
and I don't know if he did that
tonight," Berenson said. "They
got shots through, and he bat-
tled hard. Let's face it, one of
the reasons we're here is Shawn
Hunwick."
Western Michigan played like
a team still fighting for a spot in
the NCAA Tournament. With
the win, the Broncos assured

themselves of a spot in the
NCAA Tournament. Michigan,
meanwhile, played only for the
hardware on Saturday.
And coming off the double-
overtime game that went late
into the night on Friday, Michi-
gan at times struggled to match
the quickness of Western Michi-
gan's speedy forwards. The
Wolverines dug themselves a
two-goal hole on Friday against
Bowling Green, but used a late
goal in the second period and a
desperate third-period effort to
force overtime.
With more than eight minutes
remaining in the third period
against the Broncos on Satur-
day, Michigan again captured
some late momentum. After a

Denard Robinson: Just one of the guys

It was early February and
Mike Szymusiak crammed
into the right side of the
bleachers where he had always
cheered on the Michigan bas-
ketball team.
The junior
engineering
student had e:
sat there so
the scrubs
sitting at
the end of
the Indiana
Hoosiers' TIM
bench could ROHAN
hear his jeers.
This was his
arena, his school, and they were
trespassing.
So when Szymusiak and other
nearby Maize Ragers heard
two Indiana fans clapping and
yelling as Michigan shot free
throws, something had to be
done.
It was Denard Robinson who
walked over to the Hoosier
fans, stepped in between them,
crossed his arms and looked at
each of them without saying a
word.
"He just sat there, looked at
them. 'Yeah, what's your move
now, guys?' " Szymusiak said.
"And they just went beet-red,
getting mocked by the Big Ten
Player of the Year. We saw that
and we just went nuts."
Robinson and his top wide
receiver, Roy Roundtree, made it
to five basketball games this sea-
son and reminded the Michigan
community of more innocent
times, when boys gave girls their
varsity jackets, when the start-
ing quarterback could sit with
his classmates, singing the fight
song without getting mobbed,
when kids could be kids.
Trying to spot Robinson's
signature dreadlocks at a Michi-
gan sporting event has become
its own version of "Where's
Waldo," because the quarter-
back has made ita goal to attend
as many events as possible. He's

tation of its own as he played
basketball at Trotwood-Madison
High School and on the A.A.U.
circuit. Robinson had played
for one year at Deerfield Beach
High School, living mostly
off his quick first step, before
coaches told him he had a future
in football.
By the time Michigan played
then-No. 6 Ohio State on Feb.
18, Robinson and Roundtree
had been accepted as full-blown
Maize Ragers and they were
recruitingtheir teammates.
With the hype building around
the rivalry game, Roundtree
tweeted at Szymusiak with the
idea of painting their chests for
the game.
Robinson was supposed to be
a part of it too, but he was late.
Roundtree had met Szymusiak
more than an hour before the
game to transform into the 'O' in
"Beat Ohio."
"Roy was ready to rock before
that Buckeye game," Szymusiak
said. "And that was a real sur-
real experience, painting a chest
of our starting wideout."
Kevin Koger, Kenny Demens,
Blake Countess, J.B. Fitzgerald
and J.T. Floyd sat in Szymusiak's
section, and Burke outdueled
Aaron Craft and Crisler Arena
rocked as Michigan won, 56-51.
"Just seeing them being nor-
mal college kids - we always
talk about that, how refresh-
ing that is," Szymusiak said.
"Denard's everywhere.
He's kind of his own entity.
If you say Denard, everyone's
going to know who you're talk-
ing about.
"I'd like to see them back. I'd
like to see them bring more of
the team. Maybe (Brady) Hoke
will show up and we'll paint
Brady's chest."

a friend of the other athletes, but
it was bigger than his clique.
"I did it to show school spirit,"
Robinson said. "I want to be that
guy that everybody knows that
it's just me. I'm just me.
"I'm just one of the fans. One
of the students. One of the guys."
Roundtree felt the same way
when Robinson asked him if he
wanted to sneak into the Maize
Rage and watch the rest of
Michigan's Jan.11 game against
Northwestern. At halftime, the
Michigan football team had
been honored for its Sugar Bowl
win, and Robinson saw how
good a time Szymusiak and his

friends were having.
"You could tell they just want-
ed to be normal college kids for
a little bit," Szymusiak said. "We
weren't going to say no. I don't
think any of the ushers were
going to say no, either."
Sitting just in front of Robin-
son and Roundtree, Szymusiak
met the two and made sure the
rookies knew their place. They'd
have to wear maize shirts, next
time. They'd have to make noise.
And they'd have to jump around
like everyone else.
"Just because you're Shoelace
doesn't mean you don't have to
be loud like the rest of us," Szy-

musiak said.
Michigan beat Northwestern
in overtime and Robinson and
Roundtree cheered wildly and
Szymusiak said, "Hey, we'll see
you next week," but thought,
"Oh, they'll never come back."
But there they were a week
later, when Michigan played
then-No. 9 Michigan State and
won. Most of the students let the
two of them be, but a few were
starstruck. Szymusiak became
a makeshift bodyguard, having
Robinson and Roundtree stand
near the middle of his section
while he turned away distrac-
tions. Robinson was too nice to

say no to his fans.
Often, Szymusiak would step
in: "No, just get lost right now.
Let them watch the game. Let
them be a kid, for once."
But Szymusiak wouldn't allow
them not to wear maize. He gave
them more grief and by the next
game Robinson and Roundtree
had gone to the MDen and
bought maize shirts because
they had not owned any.
They picked up the cheers,
coordinated their dancing for
the "Blues Brothers" song, and
went wild for Trey Burke cross-
overs. Roundtree's jump shot

DETROIT -
Senior captain Luke Glen-
deningstepped to the
podium after the Michigan
hockey team failed to come back
in the CCHA Championship
game, falling
to Western
Michigan,
3-2.
His lips
were tight,
and his face
was drawn.
Glendening
sat down, the EVERETT
weight of the COOK
loss visible on
his slumped
shoulders. During the press con-
ference, he told the press that the
Broncos had knocked his Wol-
verines out of the CCHA Tourna-
ment two years in a row and that
he had lost three championship
games in the last four years.
Glendening was really, really
upset he had lost another.
Sunday afternoon, Michigan
learned that it will be playing
Cornell in the first round of the
NCAA Tournament in Green
Bay, Wisc. During interviews
with senior goaltender Shawn
Hunwick, the normally-serious
Glendening poked his head in
and out of the room, smiling and
cracking jokes, talking about the
challenges of postseason hockey.
The visible transition from
frustration over the Broncos
to being excited about the next
game took less than 15 hours.
For obvious reasons, that's
encouraging for Michigan.
And that's why losing the
CCHA championship was - wait
for it - actually a good thing for
the Wolverines. Gasp!

Hear me out: not including
shootouts, Michigan lost three
games in 2012 coming into the
CCHA Tournament - that's
out of 14 games over the span of
three months. Championship
teams lose three games in three
months, and championship teams
get a few lucky bounces here and
there.
Friday night was a perfect
example of those bounces, and a
perfect example of a game that
good teams find a way to win.
Michigan came back to beat
Bowling Green in double over-
time on Friday, a comeback kick-
started by a shot that shouldn't
have been close to going in. Soph-
omore defenseman Jon Merrill
put Michigan on the board after
being in a 2-0 hole with a weak,
knucklingshot that wobbled like
a football thrown by a drunken
St. Patrick's Day reveler. Bowling
Green goalie Andrew Hammond
had 55 saves that night, but he
didn't see Merrill's dead duck
until it was in the net.
"Let's face it: We are not that
good," said Michigan coach Red
Berenson. "We are not any better
than anyone else, but we are not
any worse than anyone else. We
are right there, whether it is a
bounce of the puck or a goal post
or a little bit of luck."
Michigan was in the hole
again on Saturday, partially
because of fatigue after Friday's
game, and partially because
Western Michigan is playing
some of the best hockey in the
country right now.
This time, they weren't able to
come out of that hole, and that's
the positive of the weekend, as
backward as that sounds.
Glendening may have been all

smiles on Sunday, but he's not
goingto forget about Saturday's
loss the day before any time soon.
"It's never fun to lose, but I
guesswe don't want to have that
feeling of defeat again," he said.
"This is the third championship
game I have lost, and I definitely
don't want to go through that
again."
Glendening and the Wolver-
ines won't be thinking about
Western Michigan against Cor-
nell, but they will be thinking
about what it felt like to lose the
Mason Cup. That taste of defeat,
the one they felt just three times
in three months, isn't going to
disappear. Winning the Mason
Cup would have been a nice
finishing point for the regular
season, but it wouldn't have pre-
pared Michigan for the NCAA
Tournament the same way West-
ern Michigan did.
The Broncos taught Michigan
that it is not invincible, and that
it needs more than just lucky
bounces to beat a good team
this late in the season. Michigan
learned that playing from behind
against a team with a red-hot
goalie is a lot harder than play-
ing with a lead against a red-hot
goalie, and you can bet the first
period against the Big Red is
goingto have a lot more spark
than the first periods this week-
end.
The Mason Cup would have
been nice for the trophy case, but
in the long run, losing that game
was the bestthing that could
have happened to this team.

Late explosion not enoughvs.WMU

Daily Sports Writer
DETROIT - The Michigan
hockey team endured a 48-minute
scoreless drought during Satur-
day's CCHA Championship game
against Western Michigan, a deci-
sion that the Wolverines eventu-
ally dropped, 3-2.
Michigan tried to avoid penal-
ties at all costs, but ironically, that
was where the team found its big-
gest break of the game.
"I think that game ... it's just a
reminder of how important all the
little things are in a game, wheth-
er it's a penalty, a faceoff or even a
line change," said Michigan coach
Red Berenson.
Six minutes into the third peri-
od, sophomore defenseman Jon
Merrill had a nasty knee-first col-
lision with a Bronco, sending both
players flying head-over-skates
onto the ice. The Western Michi-
gan player took several minutes to
skate off, and Merrill took a five-
minute trip to the sin bin.
The Broncos had already
scored a power-play goal that
evening, and it was bad timing for
the Wolverines, who were trailing
by three in the final frame with
one of their top penalty killers in
the box. Somehow, it became an
opportune moment for Michigan
to start to stage its comeback.
RUSSELL

That's when he started to open
up and rally a 5-2 win. With a
lead, he drove Stieber's head into
the mat, riding him out to advance
to the finals, where he would face
Iowa's Montell Marion.
In a press conference before the
141-pound final, someone asked
Russell's opponent a telling ques-
tion.
"Montell, you've got one more

Two minutes into the penalty,
sophomore defenseman Kevin
Clare brought the puck down the
ice, deked around the Broncos'
defense and slipped the puck past
Western Michigan goaltender
Frank Slubowski. Suddenly, the
prospect of a late-game comeback
didn't seem so lofty anymore. And
with the help of a Bronco five-
minute game misconduct two
minutes later, a Michigan win
finally seemed within reach.
"Going into the third period,
we thought we had a chance," said
senior forward Luke Glenden-
ing. "But (the power play) kind of
opened our eyes a little bit more."
And thanks to junior defense-
man Lee Moffie's one-timer just
minutes later, the Wolverines
were within striking distance.
With the deficit finally narrowed
to just one, Michigan still had
time remaining on the power play.
"Whether it's a bounce of the
puck or a goal post of a little bit of
luck (the game can go your way),"
Berenson said. "Either way, that
game could have went into over-
time and then we could have got
lucky and won just like (Friday)."
But no matter how much Mich-
igan itched for that final goal, the
puck just didn't find twine.

they had been missing for most of
the game. With possession in the
Broncos' zone, sophomore defen-
seman Mac Bennett had Michi-
gan's last good look of game with
three minutes left. That shot was
just inches away from propelling
Michigan into overtime. Over-
time has been kind to the Wol-
verines this year, with the squad
boasting a 6-0 record in games
decided in extra time, including a
double-overtime victory the pre-
vious night over Bowling Green.
After the game, it was obvious
that Berenson genuinely believed
that Michigan could pull through.

"I liked the way we came back
in the third period," Berenson
said. "We needed one shot, and
we had that shot, but it didn't hit
the net."
The clock ran out on the Wol-
verines on Saturday. But Michi-
gan prefers that it happens now
rather than in the NCAA Tourna-
ment.
"We were hoping for two
(goals), but that's just the way
it goes sometimes," Glendening
said. "I thought our power play
looked better tonight, and that's a
step in the right direction for the
tournament."

But there are no fairy tales in
wrestling.
Russell had a 3-0 record
against Marion, so he was con-
fident before the match. But it
didn't turn out exactly the way he
planned.
Though Russell posted the first
takedown, Marion retaliated and
kept the score close.
Russell aggressively drove
Marion into the mat while the
Hawkeye tried to earn an escape.
But Marion tied it up in the mid-
dle of the second period.And after
trading escapes, at the sound of
the whistle, Russell was a single

second away from a win off of rid-
ing time.
But59 seconds was not enough,
and Marion took Russell into sud-
den victory.
"He kind of caught me sleeping
a little bit when he got that take-
down," Russell said. "Going into
overtime, I knew I had the upper
hand."
Again, Russell came out on
top. He took control and brought
Marion down to the mat with 23
seconds left on the clock.
Though his first national title
was an accomplishment in and
of itself, his second-consecutive
crown was just icing on the cake.

Russell's last match as a Wol-
verine finalized his career record
at 134-12 to share the eighth
place on Michigan's all-time win-
ningest wrestlers list with Joe
Pantaleo (1985-89), Airron Rich-
ardson (1995-98) and Greg Wag-
ner (2002-06).
After the championships
ended, the Scottrade Center emp-
tied and the wrestlers parted
ways. But Russell left a two-time
national champion.
"I love watching him wrestle,"
said redshirt sophomore Eric
Grajales. "It sometimes feels like
he's planned out the entire match
beforehand."

hand. But the senior guards'
efforts weren't enough.
"It's a little bittersweet,"
Boylan said. "It was really nice
that we were able to make it to the
NCAA Tournament and have the
opportunity to play such a good
team in Oklahoma. But it stings a
little bit because it's our last game
in a Michigan uniform.
"It's obviously hard to swal-
low."
Two other Wolverines tal-
lied double digits as well. Junior
guard Kate Thompson and junior
forward Sam Arnold added 15 and
11 off the bench, respectively, on
9-of-21 shooting.
But Oklahoma's shooting was

even better. The Sooners drained
a majority of their shots and were
shootingf61 percent at one point in
the second half.
Sophomore Aaryn Ellenberg
led the charge for Oklahoma,
scoring 28 points - 21 of which
came in the second half - and the
four other Sooner starters broke
into double digits as well. Hand
finished with 13 and sophomore
Morgan Hook added 12 to Okla-
homa's 88 points - the most let up
by the Wolverines all season.
Michigan's defense is one of the
best in the Big Ten and has done
a good job shutting down some
of the better post players in the
conference. But they struggled
Sunday night with the taller, more
physical Sooner bigs.
Rebounds all but sealed the
deal for Oklahoma. The Wolver-

ines were out-rebounded, 39-30,
and offensive rebounds helped
the Sooners dominate the paint.
Oklahoma scored 23 second-
chance points, as Michigan just
couldn't stop Hand and center
Nicole Griffin.
Borseth pulled junior center
Rachel Sheffer early and often
in favor of the taller, stronger
junior center Sam Arnold, who
he believed did a better job defen-
sively against Hand and Griffin in
the paint. But once things turned
in favor of the Wolverines in the
post - Michigan outscored the
Sooners in the paint, 32-28 -
Oklahoma just started to hit shots
from longer-range. And that's
where Ellenbergstepped in.
"(Aaryn Ellenberg) is a phe-
nomenal player," Boylan said.
"She can stroke it, she can shoot

it, and she can drive it. She can do
everything. We tried our best to
defend her and stop her as best as
we could, but sometimes she got
away from us. She was feeling it
tonight."
But despite the outcome, both
Boylan and Reynolds will remem-
ber the foundation they helped
build for future Wolverine squads.
"It was great to be a part of it,
turning the program around like
we did, making it to the big dance
our senior season," Reynolds said.
"(Courtney and I) feel amazing
about that. That we were able
to turn it around, thanks to the
coach and the coaching staff that
came in and the players coming
in. It has been a great, great time
and I am just happy to be a part of
the tradition and the family that
we have created here."

Clare, the Wolverines killed off
a five-minute penalty, and then
went on their own five-minute
power play after Slater was eject-
ed for a hit on sophomore defen-
seman Mac Bennett.
After a power-play goal on a
beautiful feed from sophomore
forward Luke Moffatt to junior
defenseman Lee Moffie, Michi-
gan found itself suddenly back in
the game.
"Just to be that close with five
minutes left or so, we though we
had legitimate chance to come
back," said senior forward Luke
Glendening.
Michigan threatened on the
remainder of the power play, but

couldn't convert, and came up
empty in the final minutes.
For much of the game, Michi-
gan struggled to create many
opportunities. Michigan's first
goal, a shorthanded tally in the
third by Clare, was due more
to an individual effort by Clare
than any offensive momentum.
The Wolverines' best early
chance came also came on the
shorthand during a power play in
the first period.
Senior forward Luke Glenden-
ing forced a turnover near the
blue line and earned a breakaway
opportunity, but goaltender
Frank Slobowski turned away
his wrister.

gan dominated Michigan in the
semifinals of the CCHA Tourna-
ment en route to a 5-2 win.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. -
UItimately, when March
is over and bracket-pool
managers pay out the
pot, there are 67losers.
It's funny, really. When you
think of the NCAA Tournament,
you imme-
diately call
to mind the
jubilant win-
ners. For me,
it's Vermont's
overtime
upset of Syra-
cuse in the
first round LUKE
of the 2005 PASCH
tournament.
I remember
where I was, who I was watching
with. I remember Gus Johnson's
call of T.J. Sorrentine's shot
"from the parking lot" to hammer
the nail in Syracuse's coffin.
The game had a David-and-
Goliath feel to it - a bunch of
under-recruited nobodies at a
hippie school taking down a bas-
ketball giant in March. Vermont
fan or not, it was a powerful
moment.
Two days later, the Cata-
mounts ran into Michigan State
in the next round and lost hand-
ily. I couldn't tell you where I was
or what I was doingthat day. I got
over it pretty darn quickly.
Such is the beast of March
Madness. So rarely do the cam-
eras effectively capture the pain-
ful images of those who don't
make it to the end of the month.
The chances of any one team sur-
vivingto that point are absurdly
marginal, yet they all hangtheir
hopes on making it because
believing otherwise would be
sacrilege.
For 67 programs, March is the
cruelest month of the year.
On Friday night, Ohio upset
Michigan in Nashville, and the
Wolverines became a footnote.
Co-workers will gather round
the water cooler on Monday and
complain thatthe Wolverines
screwed their brackets. They'll
grumble over Michigan's short-
comings and muse that the Bob-
cats are rather well-coached for
a team out of the Mid-American
Conference.
And that's that. Life moves on
pretty quickly. After a weekend
that sawa pair of two-seeds in
Missouri and Duke fall on the
same dayas Michigan, the Wol-
verines' massive failure was a
mere blip on the radar for the
casual fan of college basketball.
By the end of the month, only the
winner matters.
Perhaps it's some kind of
neural mechanism. Your brain
remembers the good. forgets the

NASHVILLE, Tenn. - Michi-
gan had won this game many
times before.
A week ago, Michigan over-
came a nine-point deficit with
under five minutes to play to beat
Minnesota in the quarterfinals of
the Big Ten Tournament.
Two weeks before that, the
Wolverines found themselves
down four points to Northwest-
ern in the final minutes before
pulling out an overtime victory.
Earlier in the season, they had
charged back from an eight-point
deficit in the second half to down
the Wildcats in overtime in Ann
Arbor.
And in marquee wins over
rivals Michigan State and Ohio
State, Michigan found a way to
grit out nail-biting finishes. Of the
Wolverines' nine losses, just three
had not been decided by double
digits - it was the close ones that
they were often able to salvage.
So, when Michigan found itself
down nine points with less than
nine minutes to play against Ohio
at Bridgestone Arena on Friday
night, the Wolverines were in
their element.
"We've been in this situation
a million times this year," said
freshman point guard Trey Burke.
And so Burke played like he
had a million times before. After
having only scored four points
at that point in the game, Burke
dominated the next five minutes.
He scored Michigan's next 12
points by getting to the rim, get-
ting to the free-throw line and
burying contested 3-pointers.
And all of a sudden, the score
went from 57-48 to 63-60 with
four minutes left.
It was just like so many other
times this season.
"We always have to believe,
and we were believing the whole

entire game," said sophomore
guard Tim Hardaway Jr. "Down
three with two or three min-
utes left to go in the game, we
were like, 'Yeah, we've been here
before."'
The Wolverines continued to
stop the Bobcats on defense, and
all they needed was to sinka shot
or two to complete their come-
back.
"Everyone was confident," said
senior guard Zack Novak. "We
had the momentum, we had cut
the lead down, we'd been in this
situation before. We just got to
play our game. We're a second-
half team, that's it. We've done it
all year."
But there was a problem.
"We just weren't hitting shots,"
Burke said.
Shot after shot evaded nylon.
Sophomore forward Evan
Smotrycz, who hadn't missed all
game, came up short on a layup
as he slashed through the defense
from the left wing. Burke missed a
3-pointer, and so did Novak.
"We saw a little bit of light,"
said senior guard Stu Douglass.
"We wanted the lead so bad, we
wanted to tie it so bad. We fought
so hard and we didn't want the
season to end. Sometimes, you
can kind of overdo it and over-
think it a little bit"
The Wolverines had surren-
dered possession with under a
minute left and needed a crucial
stop. Burke got that stop by forc-
ing Bobcat guard Nick Kellogg
into a 10-second violation. There
would be time to try to tie it or
take it to the basket and foul to
extend the game.
"I thought, 'we'll hit a shot
finally,' "Douglass said. "Percent-
ages. The law of percentages, we'll
hit a shot. I had confidence."
That confidence meant con-
fidence in Burke, who had come
through all season. There was no
reason to believe that it was going


to be different this time.
Burke missed his 3-point try,
but Michigan was able to corral
the offensive rebound and Michi-
gan coach John Beilein called a
timeout with 40 seconds left.
Beilein's freshman was going to
get another shot at it.
As Burke dribbled the ball with
the clock winding down in the
Wolverines' last possession, he
wore a wide smile on his face. He
knew what he had done with the
game on the line so many other
times before.
"It was confidence," Burke said.
But then his shot went in-and-
out. The Wolverines regained
possession and had renewed life
until Smotrycz flubbed a cross-
over while his team tried to reset,
and Ohio recovered the ball with
seven seconds remaining.
At that moment, the confidence
that Michigan had felt the whole
game - the whole season - van-
ished. Things had gone according
to the script the whole time, and
as long as there was hope, the
Wolverines knew they had it in
the bag.
And then the script flipped.
"I looked up and I thought we
had more time," Douglass said.
"I looked over and it was 6.7
(seconds left) and I just couldn't
believe it."
Michigan had to foul and hope
that Ohio guard Walter Offutt
would miss both of his free
throws so that the Wolverines
could charge down the floor ands
get a final chance.
"There was still a possibility
that Offutt was going to miss and
so I think we called a timeout and
drew up a play and talked strat-
egy," Douglass said. "But it was
kind of hard to pay attention. You
knew he was going to hit one. It
was hard to face reality at that
point."
Offutt effortlessly sank both of
his tries, and reality struck.

Sophomore guard Tim HardawayJr. remained confident after Michigan's loss
to Ohio, fully expecting he will return Michigan to the Big Dance next season.

bitterness. But on Friday night,
after Michigan fell to an Ohio
team that just wanted it more all
game long, the images of a heart-
breaking loss were forever sealed
in my memory.
I'll never forget watching soph-
omore forward Evan Smotrycz
stand on the court and pull his
jersey over his head as the buzzer
sounded. The kid had the most
efficient shooting performance
of his career and kept Michigan
in the game throughout. But his
turnoverto seal the Wolverines'
fate in the final seconds would be
the clip shown on SportsCenter
on Saturday morning and what
the office workers remember
come Monday - and he knew it.
Senior guard Stu Douglass
untucked hisjersey and looked up
at the basket. His last chance for
postseason glory had been squan-
dered, and he needed a moment
to reflect. But Douglass and his
teammates were hurried off the
court so Temple could begin
warming up for its second-round
matchup with South Florida.
March doesn't wait around for
losers.
I won't forget walking into the
locker room afterward, seeing the
blank stares, the teary eyes. There
was a powerful silence, broken
only by the muffled Bobcat cheers
from the locker room next door.
When I walked in, senior Corey
Person strategically turned his
chair in toward the locker and
put his head in his hands to avoid
the media onslaught for the next

15 minutes.
Then, with just a few minutes
left in the locker room, sopho-
more guard Tim Hardaway Jr.
came out of the showers to
address the media. Unlike his
teammates, he held his head up
and spoke with clarity, with con-
fidence. He didn't feel sorry for
himself or his teammates, and he
credited Ohio for playing a superb
40 minutes of basketball.
Though it's too early to make
promises, he announced that
he is "definitely" coming back
to Michigan for a junior season.
Make what you will of that, but
his tone was genuine. And as
senior co-captains Zack Novak
and Stu Douglass fought tears in
front of the cameras, Hardaway
Jr. looked forward to next March,
when he'll be the veteran leader
of this squad.
I left Bridgestone Arena on
Friday night with a new perspec-
tive on March Madness. From the
2012 Tournament, I'll remember
the faces of a group of kids whose
season ended on March 16 instead
of April 2.
And should Tim Hardaway
Jr. lead them to better fortune in
March of 2013 - should they find
glory and cutdown the nets -
I'll remember thattheir journey
started with that gut-wrenching
loss on Friday night.
