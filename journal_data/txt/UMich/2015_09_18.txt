Regents approve salary 
increase to $772,500

By MICHAEL SUGERMAN

Daily News Editor

Now a year into his tenure, University President 

Mark Schlissel will receive a pay raise.

The University’s Board of Regents unanimous-

ly voted at their September meeting Thursday to 
bump Schlissel’s salary by approximately 3 percent 
— effectively increasing his yearly earnings from 
$750,000 to $772,500.

Schlissel’s five-year contract, which he signed 

in 2014, provided for annual salary increases at the 
regents’ discretion.

Regent Andrew Richner (R–Grosse Pointe) 

proposed the salary increase, which was recom-
mended by the board’s Personnel, Compensation 
and Governance Committee’s annual review of the 
president.

Richner thanked Schlissel for getting to know 

the Michigan community as well as assessing its 
strengths and making moves to improve it. He tout-
ed Schlissel’s forthcoming diversity plan, efforts to 
“enhance campus climate and safety,” the sexual 
assault survey, new initiatives to increase the Uni-
versity’s affordability and his ability to “operate the 
business of the University with best-in-class effi-
ciency.”

“We very much appreciate the job President 

Schlissel has performed in his first year,” Richner 

Marschall Runge to assume 

role, continue as Health 

System CEO, executive VP

University President Mark Schlissel recom-

mended Wednesday that Marschall Runge, the 
current executive vice president for medical affairs 
and CEO of the University of Michigan Health Sys-
tem, be additionally appointed dean of the Medical 
School, effective Jan. 1.

Schlissel said he hopes the appointment will 

facilitate joint research between the Medical 
School and UMHS, sparking new collaborations 
between medical research, education and patient 
care.

“I know he shares my enthusiasm for this shared 

alignment of all aspects of our mission and he looks 
forward to carrying it forward through the health 
system organization,” Schlissel said.

Runge’s new position as dean is part of an effort 

to restructure leadership at UMHS. According to 
Runge, UMHS has not seen the same innovation or 
excellence in past decade as it has in prior years.

“In many areas we continue to do well, but in 

others we have missed opportunities to build upon 
our success and on our potential,” he said.

He said for UMHS to regain its position of excel-

lence among top medical centers, the University 
must hire leaders willing to take risks, make bet-
ter decisions and strengthen performance in the 
health system and medical school.

Active Minds seeks 
to raise awareness of 
suicide rates among 

college students

By CHARLOTTE JENKINS

Daily Staff Reporter

Thousands of backpacks — 1,100 

in total — covered the Diag Thursday 
afternoon, representing the average 
number of college students who com-
mit suicide every year in the United 
States.

The display, titled Send Silence 

Packing, was organized by the Uni-
versity’s chapter of Active Minds, a 

national organization that aims to 
raise mental health awareness on col-
lege campuses.

The backpacks were collected in 

honor of students who have commit-
ted suicide. Many of the bags were 
dedicated to individual students and 
included fliers sharing memories 
about those lost.

One flier included a message from a 

mother about her son, Zachary Brunt, 
who committed suicide three years 
ago during his freshman year at Yale 
University.

“(Zach) was the last person any-

one would ever associate with suicide 
because he was confident, engaged, 
curious, brilliant, handsome — the 
TOTAL package,” she wrote. “Please 
help us create a worthy legacy for 

Zach by getting help if you need it and 
by helping out friends in need.”

LSA junior Alexandria Kolenda, 

Active Minds active members chair, 
said the stigma attached to suicide 
and mental health issues make it 
more difficult for students to get help.

“I hope people learn to not be as 

afraid to talk about mental health 
issues and I hope people find their 
own voices,” Kolenda said. “I want 
them to know that they’re not alone. 
We have so many resources to help 
with this.” 

Throughout the event, information 

was distributed by representatives 
from Counseling and Psychological 
Services, Pulse, Wolverine Support 
Network, the VA Ann Arbor Health-
care System, Services for Students 

with Disabilities, the Spectrum Cen-
ter and the Depression Center.

In addition to posters with facts 

about student suicide, Send Silence 
Packing featured memory boards for 
students to sign in solidarity with 
those suffering from mental illness 
and to share memories of friends lost 
to suicide.

Kinesiology 
sophomore 
Ser-

ena Saake said she found the visual 
nature of the display extremely pow-
erful.

“The way it is spread across the 

Diag is really beautiful because of all 
the people coming through here all 
day every day,” Saake said. “You can 
really visualize how much suicide 
affects students.”

Vice president talks 
transit, economic

Michigan stop

DETROIT — When Joe Biden 

arrived at the Detroit Department 
of 
Transportation 
headquarters 

Thursday, the group of shift workers 
and local dignitaries who came to 
see him offered the kind of welcome 
you’d extend to an old friend.

“I want to introduce the man who 

I keep saying is Detroit’s best friend: 
Vice President Joe Biden,” said 
Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, joking 
that the vice president has probably 
spent more time in the city than any 
place besides Washington, D.C.

Biden is no stranger to Detroit. 

Thursday marked his fifth trip to the 
city since Duggan assumed office a 
year and a half ago. This time, the 
vice president stopped to herald the 
addition of 80 new buses to the city’s 
fleet, secured with the help of federal 
dollars.

Biden loves Detroit, and should he 

decide to launch a bid for the presi-
dency as several media reports insist 

he is considering, he may look to the 
city and the state to love him back.

“Detroit isn’t just an important 

city,” he told the crowd, a shining 
city bus behind him. “It’s an iconic 
city.”

In his speech, Biden touted the 

city’s resurgence and the Obama 
administration’s efforts to assist in 
that process, such as securing funds 
to restore street lighting and locating 
a lightweight metals manufacturing 
research institute in the city.

“We would never abandon the 

people of Detroit,” he said. “It’s like 
abandoning the heart of America.”

 If passed, K-12 
public schools in 
Mich. would teach 
affirmative consent

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

Michigan Democrats are trying 

to change the way consent is dis-
cussed in the state — starting with 
how the concept is taught in schools.

Though a bill jointly introduced 

Wednesday by state Sen. Curtis 
Hertel Jr. (D–Meridian Twp.) and 
state Rep. Tom Cochran (D–Mason) 
will not change the definition of 
consent in the state of Michigan as a 
whole, it will require Michigan pub-
lic K-12 schools to focus on a con-
scious, affirmative “yes” as consent 
to having sex.

The bill doesn’t impact Universi-

ty policies, but Hertel and Cochran 
said they hoped the bill would 
address the issue of sexual assault in 
college by educating Michigan stu-
dents before they arrive on campus.

Several universities in the state 

of Michigan have been or are cur-
rently under investigation by the

Two-year program 
to begin in the fall 

2016 semester

BY ALLANA AKHTAR

Daily Staff Reporter

The University’s Board of 

Regents approved a two-year 
undergraduate major program 
through the School of Public 
Health at their monthly meet-
ing Thursday.

The program — through 

which students will be able to 
declare a public health major 
beginning in the fall 2016 
semester — will focus on “the 
importance of critical think-
ing applied to important health 
problems of the 21st century,” 
according to an action request 
written by University Provost 
Martha Pollack and Martin 
Philbert, dean of the School of 
Public Health.

“What I think is important 

to note is that this isn’t a pre-
professional degree, it’s a lib-
eral arts degree focused on the 
kinds of problems that public 
health researchers study,” Pol-
lack said in an interview with 
The Michigan Daily on Tues-
day. “And I think it’s going to be 
a really wonderful addition to 
the selection of opportunities 
for undergraduates.”

Gary Harper, a professor 

in the Public Health School’s 
Department of Health Behav-

ior and Health Education who 
helped develop the major, said 
public health is an important 
area to study due to its strong 
presence at the intersection of 
health and policy.

Everything 
from 
second-

hand smoking, the effects of 
natural disasters and personal 
wellness, Harper noted, fall 
under the umbrella of “public 
health.”

“Public health is so pervasive 

and it is so around us in every-
day life,” Harper said. “It is 
really important that students 
have a good understanding of 
what public health is, what it 
does and how to think about 
world issues from a public 
health perspective.”

Though a new major to the 

University, faculty and stu-
dents have been expressing 
interest in the major and work-
ing toward developing the con-
centration.

LSA junior Aditi Rao, an LSA 

Student 
Government 
repre-

sentative, helped lead student 
efforts to create a minor in 
public health — and also con-
sulted with faculty about the 
new major — after many stu-
dents voiced interest in a public 
health degree through an LSA-
SG survey.

Like Harper, Rao touted 

the forthcoming public health 
degree as an interdisciplinary 
program that will encompass 
a combination of medicine, the 
environment and public policy.

“Allowing 
undergraduates 

to obtain a degree in public 
health will open many oppor-
tunities and provide a more 
interdisciplinary 
education,” 

she said in an e-mail interview. 
“Being knowledgeable about 
a field like public health is so 
important today, as the field is 
so relevant whether it’s regard-
ing environmental issues or the 
next vaccine at a local or global 
level.” 

Harper said he and other 

faculty developed the degree 
program with student interest 
in mind. He said the course-
work will teach students about 
the impact public health can 
have on local and global com-
munities, and will incorporate 
active learning and field work.

“We have really been devel-

oping a program that provides 
a liberal education approach to 
public health,” he said. “I think 
students will enjoy both the 
depth and the breadth of infor-
mation that will be provided.”

The program will feature 

three 
concentration 
areas: 

public health sciences, global 
public health and community 
public health. These areas will 
“encourage 
study 
abroad,” 

according to the action request. 
Students will apply during 
their 
sophomore 
year 
and 

begin public health studies as 
a junior, similar to application-
only undergraduate programs 
such as the Ford School of Pub-
lic Policy.

Annual event 

draws hundreds of 
students to Diag

BY ALYSSA BRANDON

Daily Staff Reporter

The 
University’s 
annual 

EarthFest 
celebrated 
waste 

reduction, 
healthy 
environ-

ments and climate action with a 
Diag event on Thursday.

Geared toward educating stu-

dents about sustainability, the 
festival featured games and free 
food from local eateries. Attend-
ees were also encouraged to 
visit tables and booths manned 
by more than 50 sustainability 
groups.

The event, which has been 

held on campus for almost 20 
years, drew hundreds of stu-
dents over the course of its four-
hour duration.

Barbara 
Hagan, 
sustain-

ability representative in the 
University’s Office of Campus 

Sustainability, said EarthFest 
primarily focused on sparking 
student engagement by show-
casing the work of sustain-
ability-based organizations on 
campus.

“It highlights some of the 

work that all of the student 
groups as well as the internal 
departments and external non-
profits do to protect the environ-
ment,” she said. “We encourage 
new students to come and talk 
to the student groups to see 
which one they might want to 
get engaged in.”

Circle K, Planet Blue and 

Michigan Dining were among 
the 50 participating organiza-
tions. Members of the Univer-
sity’s Solar Car team were also 
present with their award-win-
ning solar car.

Members of the LSA Stu-

dent Government staffed tables 
where attendees could pick up 
small wildflower planters to 
take home.

LSA senior Tanner Korponay, 

chair of the LSA Student Gov-

ernment subcommitte, Taking 
Responsibility for the Earth and 
Environment, said EarthFest 
demonstrates the importance of 
sustainability on campus.

“(EarthFest makes) students 

realize that they can be sustain-
able in very simple ways around 
their homes and around campus 
by doing very simple things,” he 
said.

LSA sophomore Uriel Lee, an 

LSA student government rep-
resentative, said she EarthFest 
is way of celebrating and giving 
back to the planet.

“It tells students how to be 

sustainable, but more so, it also 
shows a little appreciation for 
Mother Earth,” Lee said. “It’s 
raising awareness about the dif-
ferent things students can to do 
to help the environment and be 
sustainable at the same time.”

Hagan said, she hoped the 

event helped students find orga-
nizations through which they 
can join the cause.

“It would be awesome if it 

was an opportunity for students 
to connect with a student group 
that is aligned with their own 
ideas of what they want to work 
on, and then dive in and become 
involved and make a difference,” 
she said. “They can achieve that 
and have fun in the process and 
meet people they’ve never met 
before.”

said. “He has hit the ground 
running … on the completion of 
President Schlissel’s first year 
in office, the Board of Regents 
would like to recognize and 
acknowledge a job well done.

Regent Shauna Ryder-Diggs 

(D–Grosse Pointe) emphasized 

her appreciation for the work 
Schlissel has done in the realm 
of campus diversity, and spoke 
specifically about the recent 
diversity summit he hosted.

“It was wonderful to see rep-

resentation from all over this 
campus, 
including 
students, 

staff, faculty and administra-
tion,” she said.

“The engagement was pal-

pable,” she added, noting that 
the board will look forward to 

the strategies that will follow 
further community insight and 
internal reviews.

In her first year at the Uni-

versity, 
President 
Emerita 

Mary Sue Coleman netted 
$475,000 per year. By her 
third year in office, her salary 
had risen by roughly 4.5 per-
cent to $484,500. By the end 
of her tenure at the University, 
Coleman was earning just over 
$603,000 per year.

U.S. Department of Education 
for their handling of sexual 
assault cases, including the 
University and Michigan State 
University.

“There’s an epidemic of sexu-

al assault on college campuses,” 
Hertel said. “One in five women 
will be a victim of sexual assault 
while in those college years. I 
think we need to do something 
to change the paradigm of what 
kids are learning before they 
get to college so we can actu-
ally give them the tools that will 
help alleviate this.”

Affirmative 
consent 
aims 

to go against the common “no 
means no” definition, which 
says an individual must clearly 
say no for a situation to be non-
consensual.

The bill would require stu-

dents be taught that silence and 
lack of resistance does not con-
stitute consent, nor does rela-
tionship status, and that consent 
can be revoked at any time.

The Michigan Daily report-

ed last year that the standard 
of consent in the University’s 
Student 
Sexual 
Misconduct 

Policy defines consent as “clear 
and unambiguous agreement, 
expressed in mutually under-
standable words or actions, to 
engage in a particular activity. 
Consent can be withdrawn by 
either party at any point.” The 
University’s 
Sexual 
Assault 

Prevention 
and 
Awareness 

Center promotes the affirma-
tive consent definition in many 
of its educational materials, 
prompting SAPAC to clarify 
language defining consent on 
its website.

Earlier this month, Univer-

sity President Mark Schlissel 
told the Daily that he wanted to 
update the University’s Student 
Sexual Misconduct Policy by 
next semester.

In a September interview 

with the Daily, Schlissel said he 
didn’t think a change in defini-
tion would effectively reduce 
sexual assault on campus.

“I don’t think that a change 

in the definition of consent is 
adequate to result in a faster 
process or diminish incidences 
of sexual assault,” Schlissel 
said. “I’m open to considering it; 
I think time will tell whether it 
makes a difference.”

However, Schlissel said he 

would be interested to see the 
impact of legislation passed in 
California that changed the def-
inition of consent in the state to 
require explicit verbal consent, 
including for the state’s univer-
sities.

“The states that are pushing 

hard on this will be our labora-
tories,” he said. “If California all 
of the sudden has a huge drop in 
sexual assault or misconduct, 
then oh boy I’m ready to do that, 
too.”

In a written statement Thurs-

day, 
SAPAC 
Director 
Holly 

Rider-Milkovich said she would 
continue to watch the legisla-
tion closely.

“The components of consent 

outlined in this proposed legis-
lation closely reflect what the 
University of Michigan has been 
teaching students for more than 
a decade,” Milkovich wrote. 
“We are committed to creating 
a safe and healthy campus com-
munity that is free of sexual vio-
lence and teaching consent is a 
fundamental part of this effort. 
Efforts to educate students ear-
lier than college about sexual 
violence are consistent with our 
own overall educational objec-
tives.”

The University has imple-

mented several education pro-
grams of its own to address the 
issue of sexual assault. Relation-
ship Remix, which is required 
for freshmen, aims to pro-
mote healthy relationships and 
informs students on the Univer-
sity’s definition of consent.

Rackham student Geneva 

Langeland said though she 
was initially confused by the 
backpacks covering the Diag, 

the display’s deeper meaning 
quickly dawned on her.

“I didn’t realize what was 

going on today so when I 
walked up and saw back-
packs scattered I thought 
there had been some sort of 
student rapture, all these stu-

dents doing homework out 
on the lawn and then they 
just disappeared,” she said. 
“And then, I kind of realized 
– that’s exactly what hap-
pened. There all these stu-
dents that should have been 
here, and aren’t.”

Expelled Michigan 
representative to 
run for seat again 

State 
Rep. 
Cindy 
Gamrat 

(R-Plainwell) was expelled from 
her seat in the state House. She 
was accused of being involved 
in a sex and cover-up scandal 
with state Rep. Todd Courser 
(R-Lapeer). 

Last Friday, just after 4 a.m., 

Gamrat was expelled by a 91-12 
vote. Despite this, she told the 
Detroit Free Press that she was 
not concerned about going back.

Five other people have filed for 

the seat in Lapeer County. They 
include Republicans Chris Tuski, 
Jake Davison, Ian Kempf, Gary 
Howell and James Dewilde.

Courser, on the other hand, 

has not filed for the seat that he 
resigned from last week.

Flint, Detroit named 
among top poorest 
cities in America

According to a U.S. Cen-

sus Bureau report released on 
Wednesday, Flint and Detroit 
rank among the most impover-
ished cities in the country. Flint 
has 40.1 percent of its popula-
tion living below the poverty 
line. Based on the city’s size, this 
makes Flint the second-poorest 
city in the country. 

According 
to 
the 
Michi-

gan Department of Health and 
Human Services, 130,095 people 
in Genessee County, where Flint 
is located, are using food stamp 
assistance. This is about a 48% 
increase since 2005. 

 Detroit has an improverished 

population of 39.3 percent. This 
means that Detroit is the poorest 
major city in America. 

Man found dead 
near Wolverine 
Tower in June died 
of natural causes

Police confirmed Thursday 

morning that a man found dead 
in June near Wolverine Tower, a 
University administrative build-
ing, passed away from natural 
causes. 

Diane Brown, spokesperson 

for the University’s Division of 
Public Safety and Security, said 
the man, identified as 22-year 
old Ypsilanti resident Lezester 
Sample, died from diabetic keto-
acidosis. Diabetic ketoacidosis is 
a complication of type 1 diabetes. 

Sample was not affiliated with 

the University. 

In June, police had indicated 

that the cause of death was likely 
non-suspicious.

NEWS BRIEFS

recalled his own working-class 
roots, describing a time when 
his father climbed the stairs 
to young Biden’s bedroom. Joe 
Biden Sr. told his son he’d need 
to seek work in another city, but 
assured him everything would 
be OK.

Biden, who expressed a love 

for automobiles and spoke of a 
father who sold cars his whole 
life, was telling Detroit’s story by 
telling his own.

“We’ve got a lot further to 

go,” he said, his shirtsleeves now 
rolled up. “We won’t give up until 
everyone in Detroit who wants to 
work makes a decent wage and 
can make that walk over and say, 
‘Honey, it’s going to be all right.’”

Mayor Duggan told another 

anecdote.

When Biden met with him in 

2014, not long into the new may-
or’s term, he asked what the one 
thing was the Obama adminis-
tration could do to lend a hand.

Duggan’s answer: buses. Dug-

gan saw Detroiters braving the 
January snow, waiting for buses 
that often didn’t show up. 

So Biden called Duggan every 

week. The vice president said he’d 
do his best to come up with a solu-
tion.

Even as Biden dealt with a for-

eign policy crisis in Ukraine last 
year, the vice president kept calling.

“I want you to know, I haven’t 

forgotten about the buses,” Biden 
told him.

And he didn’t. The adminis-

tration created a grant competi-
tion, told Duggan to apply, and 
the city ultimately secured the 
funds to bring 80 new buses to 
the city of Detroit.

When White House adviser 

Gene Sperling and Transporta-
tion Secretary Ray LaHood, who 
served as the administration’s 
point people for revitalization 
efforts in Detroit, left office, 
U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D–
Dearborn) said she told Biden 
Detroit needed a new champion 
in Washington.

“He’s really been that person,” 

she told The Michigan Daily. “He 
understands the importance of it. 
You’ve got to have somebody that 
is fighting for people, and Joe 
Biden cares deeply about want-
ing to see the city come back.”

Dingell, however, wasn’t ready 

to commit her support to Biden, 
were he to declare his candidacy. 
She said Democratic frontrun-
ner Hillary Clinton, the former 
secretary of state, doesn’t have 
Michigan locked down.

She thinks the primary would 

be competitive if Biden were on 
the ballot.

“I love Joe Biden. I love Hill-

ary. I hope I don’t have to make 
the decision between the two of 
them,” she said. “They’re both 
two talented, wonderful people 
and they would both be good 
presidents of the United States.”

Aaron Kall, an expert on elec-

tion politics and the University’s 
director of debate, said Biden’s 
base would likely focus on Rust 
Belt states, including Michigan.

“He’s always been a defender 

of the working person and I think 
Detroit really embodies that,” he 

said. “He relates to the history of 
the city and the work ethic of the 
community, and he wants to do 
whatever he can to support it.”

Kall said he thinks Biden 

could carry Michigan in the pri-
mary, were he to challenge the 
current Democratic contenders.

“If you compared visits (to 

Michigan) with him and Hillary 
Clinton and Bernie Sanders, he’s 
just going to have a much higher 
name recognition,” he said. “I do 
think the race would be up for 
grabs. I think his past history and 
experience would serve him well.”

As he sipped a glass of wine at 

the Great Lakes Coffee Roasting 
Company on Woodward Avenue, 
where Biden made a Labor Day 
stop last year, Detroit resident Don-
nie Sackey said Biden could add to 
the race, but he doesn’t see the vice 
president as a viable candidate.

“Do I think that Joe Biden 

has a shot at becoming presi-
dent? This (would be) his third 
time running,” he said. “I think 
people look at that and say, “You 
lost, why do you want to run for 
president?’ ”

George Robinson, a DDOT 

shift supervisor who listed to 
Biden’s speech on Thursday, 
hasn’t committed his support 
to a candidate yet, but said he’s 
followed 
Biden’s 
career 
for 

quite some time, since before he 
assumed the vice presidency.

“I would definitely consider 

him,” he said. “No doubt about 
it. He has a history of supporting 
the middle class. He’s a down-to-
Earth type of guy, just a regular 
man right next door. He can real-
ly relate to me. He’s not someone 
who’s so high up that he (doesn’t) 
understand the issues that peo-
ple day to day deal with.”

Cindy Reese, a Detroit trans-

portation activist who spoke at 
Thursday’s event, said she was 
impressed by the vice president’s 
grasp of Detroit’s transit issues.

“I listened to him today, and 

I’ve heard some other speeches, 
but he really touched my heart 
today,” she said. “My struggle 
was his struggle and that’s what 
you want — a person in office to 
understand and be part of your 
struggle, too.”

Runge was appointed by the 

regents to lead UMHS in 2014. 
He previously served as the 
executive dean for the School 
of Medicine at the University 
of North Carolina at Chapel 
Hill. Dr. Michael Johns, former 
Emory chancellor and executive 
vice president for health affairs, 
had filled the role in an interim 
capacity after the departure of 
former UMHS CEO Ora Pesco-
vitz. She announced she her 
departure from the University 
after five years in the position.

James 
Woolliscroft, 
the 

school’s current dean, said in 
an e-mail to the Medical School 
Community, obtained by The 
Michigan Daily, that he has long 
advocated for combining the 
two roles. He said he would step 
down in January after serving 
as dean since 2007.

“By explicitly and visibly 

linking these pieces in our … 
mission of research, education 
and patient care in one person, 
we enable the seamless connec-

tion between the people and 
resources of the medical school 
and the hospitals and health 
centers, while creating a trans-
parent structure for both timely 
action 
and 
accountability,” 

Schlissel said.

Regent 
Shauna 
Ryder-

Diggs (D) said the integration 
of patient care, research and 
education will make UMHS 
a national leader in these 
realms.

“This merging of our respon-

sibilities we are discussing 
today is the next logical step in 
this process,” Ryder-Diggs said.

The first new leadership 

position is the executive vice 
dean for clinical affairs at the 
Medical School and president 
of the University of Michigan 
Hospitals and Health Centers 
and University of Michigan 
Medical Group.

Internal 
Medicine 
Prof. 

David Spahlinger, currently the 
senior associate dean for clini-
cal affairs and executive direc-
tor of UMMG, will take this 
position beginning Jan. 1.

Runge 
said 
integrating 

the clinical enterprise with 

the Medical School is part of 
his plan to better integrate 
research, patient care and edu-
cation within UMHS and the 
Medical School.

“This will drive for greater 

innovation, 
better 
progress 

and ultimately better care for 
patients,” he said.

Before serving as senior 

associate dean, Spahlinger was 
chief medical resident at the 
University during his residency 
in the 1980s. In 1997, he became 
the first medical director of the 
University Faculty Group Prac-
tice when it was formed.

A 
senior 
vice 
president 

and chief operating officer of 
the University Hospitals and 
Health Centers and the Uni-
versity Medical Group was also 
appointed. T. Anthony Denton, 
current CEO of University of 
Michigan Hospitals and Health 
Centers, will serve in the role. 
Denton will work to align 
medical school education and 
research with clinical enter-
prise operations. 

Denton began as an adminis-

trative fellow at UHMS in 1981 
and served as CEO of UMHHC

A

s I sometimes tell people, I 
like everything — I’ve only 
had a couple of classes in 

my 
two 
years 

so far at Michi-
gan that I truly 
didn’t 
enjoy. 

I 
think 
this 

comes out of my 
wide-reaching 
interests. 
Each 

semester 
I’m 

looking to learn 
as much as I can, 
both inside and 
outside of the 
classroom, and I 
want to let my professors know that 
I’m engaged on this deep and sin-
cere level. I’m truly paying atten-
tion during their lectures because 
I’m coming to class in order to 
take away something I didn’t know 
before. So a normal day for me 
means that, as class ends and every-
one rushes out the door en masse, 
I instead make my way down the 
aisle to the front of the room.

“Hi,” I’ll tell the professor when 

I get up to the podium. “I really 
enjoyed your lecture. And I wanted 
to let you know, it reminded me of 
something I heard on the radio the 
other day…”

It can be that simple. A few words 

are all it takes to begin to build a 
friendship that can last long after the 
final exam. For me, these relation-
ships have meant spending time in 

a professor’s office to practice Ger-
man or meeting for coffee to talk 
about academic goals. A couple of 
my professors have also approached 
me about working for them over the 
summer, and hired me to compile 
materials that would be integrated 
into an existing syllabus. Such possi-
bilities are out there, but in each new 
class and semester, I have to once 
again make the effort to build a rela-
tionship. I want to be someone my 
professors will get to know by name, 
not because I’m 
trying to kiss up, 
but because I’m 
truly interested 
in and drawn to 
the subject mat-
ter that they’re 
teaching.

University 

President Mark 
Schlissel 
spoke 

about getting to 
know your pro-
fessors in a recent interview with 
WEMU’s Lisa Barry. “Even though 
this is a big school, one of the pleasant 
things about the culture here is the 
faculty truly love to teach,” Schlissel 
said. “Part of the reason they come to 
the University of Michigan is because 
of the caliber of students we attract.”

Outside of such a context, it can 

be scary to go up and talk to a pro-
fessor — I’ll be the first one to say 
that — but it pays to build a rela-
tionship that can last. After the 

semester comes to a close, Eliza-
beth Goodenough, a lecturer in the 
Arts and Ideas in the Humanities 
program, sometimes hires students 
as research assistants or writes let-
ters of recommendation, and finds 
that students often come back into 
their teachers’ lives, sometimes a 
 

decade later. 

Ann Arbor is a fairly small town, 

and I’ve run into former profes-
sors at the grocery store or walking 
their dog in the neighborhood. It’s 

a good feeling 
when both of 
us can remem-
ber the other’s 
name. And that 
starts 
now, 

when 
you 
go 

to office hours, 
when you send 
an e-mail asking 
for clarification 
of the materials, 
when you linger 

for a minute after class and chat 
about the weather as you pack your 
things. Let them know what you 
liked and where you lost interest 
or, as the case may be, found your-
self offended. And see where the 
conversation goes from there. Your 
professors come here to teach and 
you come to learn; you might have 
more in common than you realize.

Preparing for post-grad

I

t isn’t rare to hear my sorority sisters, 
classmates and co-workers talk about 
“recruiting” season — wondering aloud 

how they’re going to bal-
ance their Summer 2016 
internship 
search 
with 

classes and extracurricu-
lars. As it’s only September 
and most of these intern-
ships won’t start for eight 
or 10 more months, some 
of their worry might seem 
misguided.

But for many students — 

especially those taking out 
loans to help pay for col-
lege — stress surrounding 
their post-college career begins the first day 
of the semester. Findings from a new study 
released by the U.S. Department of Education 
show that while college graduates continue 
to make significantly more than non-colle-
gians, the earnings of students 10 years after 
enrollment are bleak, justifying students’ job 
search stress. 

The study, called the College Scorecard, is 

designed to shed light on the monetary value 
of a degree from any given school and the 
likelihood that graduates from that school 
will be able to pay back student loans. Using 
IRS data, the study measures the average 
income for students who received federal stu-
dent aid and the percentage of students earn-

ing more than the average worker with only a 
college diploma.

According to the study, graduates from the 

University generally fared above average. Ten 
years after college, 78 percent of graduates 
earned more than those without a college edu-
cation, and their average annual income was 
$57,900. More than 90 percent of graduates 
were able to pay back their student loans. 

Still, studies like this one come as an 

unwelcome reminder of many students’ need 
to find a job that will maximize the return on 
their investment in their education — wheth-
er or not they took out loans. With that in 
mind, students’ willingness to spend count-
less hours searching for a summer internship 
that might lead to a job after school doesn’t 
seem all that irrational.

Likewise, the University’s resources for 

helping students find good jobs after gradu-
ation now seem much more essential to the 
value of a student’s education. There is cer-
tainly an intrinsic value to the time students 
spend at college — I think that goes without 
saying. But most students also expect that 
their hard work and time spent at college will 
materialize into higher lifetime wages. Many 
students also hope that the degree they spent 
so much time working on will be somehow 
relevant to their career.

I’m about to state the obvious here, so bear 

with me. The professional skills that contrib-
ute to students’ ability to find well-paying jobs 

Is Greek life the only culprit?

L

ast 
Thursday, 
University 

President Mark Schlissel 
called 
for 
a 
mandatory 

meeting 
of 

all 
Greek 
life 

chapters in which 
he 
reprimanded 

the 
community 

for its problems 
with sexual assault and alcohol 
abuse. Though a call to reform 
Greek life was clearly necessary, 
considering the Treetops Resort ski 
trip incident and the community’s 
disproportionate problems with 
sexual assault, is Greek life truly 
the only group to blame for the 
“party 
image” 

Schlissel claims 
the 
University 

is 
beginning 
 

to embody?

Schlissel’s 

comments to the 
Greek commu-
nity made me 
consider 
party 

life on campus, 
and 
whether 

fraternity 
par-

ties are truly as dangerous, rac-
ist and homophobic as E. Royster 
Harper, vice president for student 
life, claimed their perception to 
be. I should start by explaining 
to the (freshman) population that 
there are two types of parties at the 
University: fraternity parties and 
house parties. Club sports, profes-
sional fraternities and other gen-

eral student orgs often fall into the 
latter category. 

When considering the safety stan-

dards put in place during fraternity 
parties versus general house parties, 
it would be easy to say that fraternity 
parties are actually safer. Frats utilize 
sober monitors, hire security guards, 
track who is entering the house by 
people’s Mcards and have other IFC 
safety enforcements to answer to 
when throwing parties. These par-
ties meet all the standards to ensure 
a safe and fun night — right?

Apparently, wrong. Recent sta-

tistics have shown that members in 
Greek life are 2.5 times more likely 

to be sexually 
assaulted 
than 

all 
non-Greek 

students 
on 

campus. This is 
likely due to the 
nature of Greek 
parties 
com-

pared to house 
parties. 
While 

Greek life par-
ties do set regu-
lations in place 

that may appear for these organiza-
tions to harbor “safe fun,” mixing 
large quantities of students with 
dark lighting and hard liquor is a 
recipe for disaster.

However, there’s a surprising 

statistic the student body should 
be aware of. While those involved 
in Greek life are 2.5 times more at 
risk than non-Greek life students, 

those involved with club sports 
were twice as likely to experi-
ence unwanted sexual penetra-
tions — nearly as much as Greek 
life. And while those involved in 
the Greek community represent 
nearly 17 percent of the University, 
those involved with club sports 
only represent about 5 percent of 
 

the population. 

If I, an average sophomore, know 

these statistics, there’s no doubt 
Schlissel knows them, too. Where 
is the big mass meeting for all 
club sports? Is Greek life deemed 
the scapegoat of the unsafe party 
life on campus solely because it’s 
 

more visible?

While Greek life is to blame for a 

higher record of sexual assaults and 
alcohol abuse on campus, it isn’t the 
only population to blame. At house 
parties, there are less resources put 
in place for the students’ safety, 
which could lead to an environment 
just as unsafe — maybe even more 
so — as fraternity parties.

My final words: Punish the Greek 

community, but also be mindful of 
other culprits. Chastising the Greek 
community for its inappropriate 
behavior was good, but this is not 
the only community deserving of a 
critical look. Be aware when you go 
to a house party that’s not at Theta 
Chi or SAE — it doesn’t mean you’re 
being completely safe.

LAMOREAUX
FROM THE DAILY

A

t their meeting Monday, members of the Senate Advisory 
Committee on University Affairs proposed an initiative that 
would add more Friday classes in an effort to curb “Thirsty 

Thursdays.” During the meeting, University Provost Martha Pollack 
said she was in favor of this proposal because it would help to limit 
excessive drinking, which she cites as major issue on campus. This 
isn’t the first time Pollack has suggested Friday classes, but when she’s 
done so in the past, it’s been for logistical and budgetary reasons. This 
suggestion comes on the heels of the University announcing a new 
alcohol policy and just days after President Mark Schlissel’s remarks 
at the University’s first-ever all-Greek life meeting, during which 
he addressed alcohol consumption and party culture in the Greek 
community. While the proposal has the potential to help curb binge 
drinking, holding more Friday classes is just a start toward changing 
an over-arching culture. The University needs to continue to work 
toward other approaches that combat root issues associated with 
binge drinking and the Millennial party culture.

Holding more Friday morning classes 

could be a step toward changing the drinking 
culture at the University. Since the proposed 
Friday classes would likely be unpopular, 
underclassmen who schedule their classes 
last among University students — especially 
freshmen — would be more likely to take a 
large number of Friday classes. If Thursday-
night drinking is out of the question for 
freshmen from the start of their college 
career because of an early-Friday-morning 
class, traditional two-day weekends will 
become the norm for them. Furthermore, if 
students don’t develop excessive drinking 
early in their college careers, then they could 
be less likely to ever develop such habits. This 
increases the likelihood for lasting change at 
the University.

A 
2007 
study 
from 
University 
of 

Missouri’s Midwest Alcoholism Research 
Center suggests this likelihood is valid. 
“Approximately two-thirds of students who 
consumed some alcohol Thursday consumed 
a binge amount if they had late or no Friday 
classes,” said Philip Wood, a professor of 
quantitative psychology who contributed 
to the study. Pollack reiterated this similar 
sentiment during SACUA’s Monday meeting.

Though Friday classes may make a dent in 

the effort to reduce binge drinking, it’s not 
that simple. Excessive drinking is an issue 
on many college campuses across the nation. 
Critically thinking about how to address 
these issues calls into question how much 
responsibility the University should be taking 
when it comes to helping students with 
general life skills: drinking habits as well as 
time management and health and wellness.

On one hand, it’s the responsibility of 

the students to control their actions when 
it comes to consuming alcohol and making 
it to class or not. On the other hand, binge-
drinking culture at the University poses real 
threats to students’ health and wellness, 

and should very much be a concern of the 
administration. At a town hall meeting last 
week, E. Royster Harper, vice president 
of student life, emphasized this as an 
administrative priority. Surely, the University 
has a relevant stake in students’ health and 
how others perceive our campus.

During the Sept. 14 meeting, SACUA 

members also encouraged faculty to address 
drinking habits in their classes by warning 
against the dangers of excessive drinking and 
suggesting dry events students could attend. 
Faculty wouldn’t be doing any harm by 
speaking to students about drinking habits, 
but these suggestions do not seem to tackle 
the root of the problem. A change in drinking 
culture must come from the students 
themselves, especially student organizations. 
If students starting their freshman year 
are invested in student organizations that 
involve them in activities not centered 
around alcohol, they may develop weekly 
routines that don’t include excessive drinking 
on every weekend or “free” night.

One concern about offering Friday classes 

is logistical issue, as many students have 
internships and jobs that require them to 
work Fridays. Therefore, packing Fridays 
with more classes could hinder students’ 
abilities to participate in these activities that 
help students pay for tuition or gain valuable 
professional experience.

The University is trying to reduce students’ 

alcohol consumption, make a safer campus 
and prevent the University from developing 
a reputation as a “party school.” Increasing 
the number of Friday classes, though unlikely 
to make drastic changes in students’ lives, 
is another attempt by the University to 
nudge students toward adopting healthier 
drinking habits. The University has the right 
to and should initiate structural changes 
to the academic week to try to change our

in their field after graduation don’t 
come naturally. If students want to 
write great cover letters or resumes 
or give persuasive answers when 
employers ask why they should hire 
them, they have to learn how, just 
like they’d have to learn calculus if 
they want to take a derivative.

But even though all of what I 

said is so totally obvious, the Uni-
versity could still be doing so much 
more to impart those skills to its 
 

LSA students.

The Career Center — the primary 

place for LSA students to receive 
career services — has undergone 
improvements within the past year 
that will likely help students con-
nect with resources that could help 
them find meaningful employment 
— whatever that means to them — 
upon graduation, or sooner. Part of 
this improvement involved replac-
ing its old, clunky Career Center 
Connector website with a site called 
Handshake, which more effectively 
connects students with job post-
ings, professional and career devel-
opment events and resources to 
help them write better resumes and 
cover letters.

Giving students some of these 

tools at home through an improved 

website may be helpful for students 
who feel unprepared to meet with 
an adviser or are unsure of which 
resources are available through the 
Career Center.

But despite these changes, many 

students still don’t use Career Cen-
ter services. Whether it’s because 
they’d rather not think about life 
after college or because they don’t 
know what resources are available, 
it’s clear that there’s a large seg-
ment of campus that isn’t connect-
ing with these resources.

In part, this 

could 
be 
due 

to the way that 
career 
ser-

vices are deliv-
ered. 
Most 

skills related to 
students’ 
col-

lege 
education 

are 
delivered 

directly — often 
through classes 
that 
motivate 

students to practice the skills. How-
ever, professional development is 
totally elective, and the Career 
Center resources are so under-pro-
moted that it’s easy to forget they 
even exist.

Incentivizing internship experi-

ences will help students maximize 
their education by confirming or 
rejecting a particular career inter-
est while they’re still in school and 
can take classes related to that field. 
Some departments offer options to 
receive course credit for internships. 
Other schools encourage and require 
professional experience to graduate.

It goes without saying that a col-

lege education is worth much more 
than the jobs or salaries it helps stu-
dents eventually obtain. But as the 

costs of college 
continue to rise, 
it’s 
important 

that 
the 
Uni-

versity 
recog-

nizes that it will 
become increas-
ingly 
difficult 

for students to 
recoup the value 
of their invest-
ment 
in 
their 

education. 
The 

University has a responsibility to 
continually develop and provide the 
best resources to help them do so.

“My pizza is built on …”
I’m sitting in a dim booth on the 

second floor of the Jolly Pumpkin 
Cafe & Brewery on Main Street. 
Maggie Long, chef and managing 
partner, 
sits 

across from me. 
She’s short and 
sinewy, 
with 

cropped 
hair 

and an oven-
baked 
face. 

As she starts 
this 
sentence, 

I try to guess 
what 
she’ll 

finish 
with. 

The 
granite 

oven? Local produce? Some secret 
ingredient?

“Community.”
A community of surviving, 

thriving 
bacteria 
and 
yeasts. 

Jolly Pumpkin pizza is baked on 
a sourdough crust, made with a 
starter that could be 130 years old, 
have traveled thousands of miles 
and changed hands several times. 
How is this possible?

Sourdough 
was 
the 
first 

leavened 
bread, 
developed 

thousands 
of 
years 
ago 
in 

Mesopotamia. 
Bakers 
would 

leave dough to sit overnight, and 
it would pick up ambient yeasts 
and bacteria. These microbes 
would digest the natural sugars 
in the dough, converting them 
into carbon dioxide, which made 
the dough rise, and acids, which 
flavored the dough and prevented 
spoilage. Today, even though yeast 
is commercially available, many 
bakers prefer the distinctive tang 
and chew that lactic-acid bacteria 
provide (this process is also what 
gives pickles and yogurt their 
flavor). Instead of letting every 
batch of dough sit out overnight, 
they have a starter — a mixture of 
flour and water that collects and 
incubates wild yeasts and bacteria, 
and is then added to the fresh 
dough before baking. As long as the 
microbes are fed fresh water and 
flour every day, they’ll survive and 
reproduce indefinitely, developing 
new, deeper flavors as time passes. 

Sourdough is not traditionally 

used for pizza crust. But one day, 
years ago, Long was in Berkeley, 
California, and she came upon 
The Cheeseboard Collective, a 
worker-owned cooperative that 
runs a bakery, cheese shop and 
pizzeria. Hungry and intrigued, 
she stopped for a slice.

“It was the most gorgeous pizza 

crust I’d ever seen,” she says, still 
enthralled. “it had a shine to it, a 
chew, and this flavor that I can’t 

really explain,”

Long 
inquired 
about 
this 

magisterial crust, and learned that 
it was made using sourdough from 
their bakery. In early 2009, as she 
was planning to open The Jolly 
Pumpkin, she knew sourdough 
pizza had to be on the menu. She 
began frequenting the Ann Arbor 
Farmer’s Market, hoping to make 
connections with local farmers 
and artisans. She struck up a 
conversation with John Savanna 
of Mill Pond Bakery in nearby 
Chelsea, who sold his sourdough 
bread at the Saturday market. 
Long was just looking for tips on 
how to make her own sourdough. 
But Savanna took a liking to her 
and the nascent restaurant. One 
day, in late June, he handed her a 
mason jar of his sourdough starter, 
the starter he’d been using since he 
opened Mill Pond in the early ‘80s. 
But the starter was even even older 
than that.

“(My 
father) 
acquired 
the 

sourdough 
starter 
from 
a 

colleague of his in California in the 
late seventies in the San Francisco 
area,” his son Steve Savanna wrote 
to me in an e-mail. “At that time 
the sourdough culture dated back 
over 100 years and originated in 
France.”

Steve, who now helps run 

the bakery, recalls his father’s 
obsessive 
devotion 
to 
this 

delicate treasure. One time, while 
vacationing in Northern Michigan, 
John drove all the way back to 
Chelsea to personally feed the 
starter. It may sound a bit much, 
but the longevity of a sourdough 
starter is only potential — without 
regular feeding, it will die, and, 
though it can be coaxed back to 
life, the flavor won’t be the same.

John Savanna must have seen 

something in Maggie Long. And 
he saw right. In the six years since 
they’ve opened, Long’s cache of 
starter has never perished.

“This is one of the things in this 

restaurant that we baby to death,” 
Long tells me back at our booth. 
“It sounds really stupid to do that, 
but it’s a piece of us, and a piece of 
somebody else.”

At Jolly Pumpkin, they feed 

the starter twice a day. Before 
every feeding, half of it is thrown 
away — otherwise, the starter 
would grow exponentially. Long 
didn’t realize this back in 2009, 
or was just unwilling to waste any 
of Savanna’s gift. After a month, 
the mason jar couldn’t contain 
the starter. Neither could a single 
five-gallon bucket. It took five of 
them for Long to realize that she 

had to throw some out. Now, they 
have around four gallons, and 
mix a gallon of it every day with 
five times as much fresh dough, 
and let it ferment overnight. After 
years of residing in this basement, 
the starter has taken in the local 
microbes, making it unique to this 
location.

“May I see it?” I ask Long, 

expecting the answer to be a firm 
“No.”

She springs up from her seat, 

and leads me to the basement prep 
kitchen, cautioning me to mind the 
recently mopped stairs. The air is 
damp and cool and ripe-smelling, 
like a forest after a storm.

I couldn’t tell at first what the 

starter was. After hearing the 25 
gallon saga, I’d envisioned some 
captive beast, oozing through 
its chains and howling for more 
flour. Instead, the starter resides 
in a battered white bucket, next to 
containers of fermenting lemons 
and kimchi. It resembles thick 
pancake batter, with lazy bubbles 
pushing their way to the surface 
every few seconds. I lean my face 
closer, picking up its sour, starchy, 
bottom-of-a-beer-bottle 
smell. 

Long invites me to dip a finger in 
and have a taste. It’s no cookie-
dough, to be sure, but thick and 
appealingly tangy, like Greek 
yogurt.

As I’m leaving, Long hands me 

a takeout-soup container of starter. 
I gingerly accept it, as if it might 
crumble in my hands.

“Make your own bread,” she 

encourages. “But I’d research how 
to feed starter if I were you.”

At home, I place the container 

on top of my fridge, pledging to 
go buy flour within the hour. 
But that hour stretches into two, 
then three, then a whole night. I 
stumble into the kitchen the next 
morning and take a peek.

It’s gruesome. The starter 

has risen up, popped the lid off 
and cascaded down the sides of 
the container, hardening like 
toothpaste. There are no more 
bubbles, and it now just smells 
like flour, which I guess means 
it smells like death. I scrape 
what I can into a new container 
and place it in the fridge, hoping 
to revive it the next day.

Meanwhile, in the basement 

kitchen, someone feeds the 
starter, keeping the community 
going.

Culture shift bolsters 
Michigan in offseason

Compher traded 

from Buffalo 
to Colorado in 
offseason deal

By JASON RUBINSTEIN

Daily Sports Editor

The college hockey season is 

longer than most other sports. 
Spanning from the beginning 
of October to the end of April, 
there is plenty of time for 
players to get fed up with one 
another.

But that’s what the Michigan 

hockey team can’t afford if it 
is going to end its three-year 
drought 
without 
an 
NCAA 

Tournament appearance.

Last season, and the two years 

before, multiple players said 
the team culture wasn’t strong 
enough. Cliques formed, and 
not everyone had each other’s 
back. But this summer, when 
junior forward JT Compher 
and senior forwards Boo Nieves 
and Justin Selman earned roles 
as the team’s captains, they 
immediately set out to create a 
new team culture.

“In my first few years, there 

were some cliques and some 
guys weren’t friendly enough, 
I believe,” Nieves said. “What 
Selman, JT and I have tried 
to do is take some guys you 
normally wouldn’t to lunch, 
that kind of thing.”

And according to sophomore 

defenseman Cutler Martin, the 
new culture is noticeable.

“Guys are getting along really 

well,” Martin said. “I could call 
any one of my teammates to 
go have breakfast, and that’s a 
good feeling. You can’t always 

do that. You can talk to anyone 
about anything.

“The season is super long, 

and it’s important from a day-
to-day perspective to be friends, 
because you want to have a good 
relationship together and (be) 
united in the same cause.”

But 
how 

exactly 
does 
off-ice 

chemistry 
translate 
to 

on-ice results? 
According 
to 
Nieves, 

a 
stronger 

friendship 
leads 
to 

greater trust, 
so 
when 

Michigan is down late in the 
third period, each player knows 
he can lean on another.

“When you’re struggling, you 

can always look to a friend, not 
just a teammate,” Nieves said.

Junior forward Tyler Motte 

agreed with Nieves, and added 
that the pace of practice has 
been 
outstanding. 
Michigan 

just hopes that it will translate 
into wins.

COLORADO 
COMPHER: 

JT Compher had a strange 
offseason. 
He 
was 
traded 

from the Buffalo Sabres to the 
Colorado 
Avalanche 
before 

he even suited up for an NHL 
game.

The junior captain was part 

of the Ryan O’Reilly blockbuster 
trade. When Buffalo drafted 
Compher 
in 
2013, 
he 
was 

expected to be a centerpiece of 
the future. That’s why it was a 
strange feeling for Compher 
when he heard the news.

“It was a weird experience,” 

Compher 
said. 
“It’s 
much 

different and easier when you’re 

20 years old and in college. It’s 
not like I was living (in Buffalo) 
with a family or anything like 
that.

“It does change my future a 

little, but right now it doesn’t 
change too much. I just went 
to Colorado for prospects camp 

and just tried 
to 
get 
the 

know the staff 
there.”

As 
an 

added bonus, 
Compher 
said, 
the 

Avalanche’s 
director 
of 
player 

development 
is a Michigan 

alum. That familiarity helped 
him ease into Denver.

NHL CAMPS: Last summer, 

just a few Wolverines attended 
the 
team’s 
NHL 
prospect 

development camps. According 
to Motte, players wanted to stay 
in Ann Arbor and work with 
each other in Michigan instead 
of travel to camps.

This past summer, though, 

the game plan changed, and 
15 Wolverines attended NHL 
development camps.

“Last summer, most guys 

thought it was best for them to 
stick around and focus on what 
was going on in Ann Arbor,” 
Motte said. “But this summer, 
guys are getting closer to 
making the jump and want to 
become comfortable with their 
team.”

Not 
only 
that, 
Motte 

reiterated, but there are “huge 
positives” to attending these 
camps.

“You compete against bigger, 

stronger, older guys,” he said. 
“That never hurts.”

Hard work earns Ellis 
captaincy as a senior

By LELAND MITCHINSON

Daily Sports Writer

Even as a fifth-year senior 

defender, it took Mackenzie Ellis 
until last Friday to score her first 
career goal.

With 
the 
Michigan 
field 

hockey team down by a goal 
against Vermont, Ellis smacked 
in the equalizer off a corner 
rebound in the 10th minute, 
allowing the Wolverines to pull 
ahead for a 3-1 win.

“You 
know, 
as 
a 
really 

important 
defender 
on 
our 

team, she doesn’t get very many 
opportunities to score goals,” 
said Michigan coach Marcia 
Pankratz. 
“When 
she 
got 

her opportunity, she stuck it, 
capitalized on it and scored an 
important goal for us, so that was 
fun.

“(It) put a smile on my face. 

I think she enjoyed it and liked 
it and would like to score a few 
more.”

But Ellis’ journey toward that 

goal and a starting role on the 
team has been a bumpy one.

As a freshman, Ellis was a 

walk-on and redshirted her first 
year. She didn’t see much action 
as a redshirt freshman the next 
year, either, appearing in fewer 
than half the Wolverines’ games.

Things began to pick up for 

Ellis during her third year of 
eligibility, when she earned a 
starting spot 
on the defense 
in 
18 
total 

games. Now in 
her fifth year 
on 
campus, 

she has earned 
the position of 
team captain 
and leads a 
defensive 
unit that has 
surrendered 
just three goals through six 
games.

Her early struggles, however, 

are what allowed her to become 
the leader she is now.

“I think it makes me a lot more 

able to relate to a lot of different 
players,” Ellis said. “I’m not a 
player that came in and started 
their freshman year and never sat 
a game in their life, so I think that 
if players are struggling, it makes 
me a lot more able to sit down with 
them and offer them advice.”

Added Pankratz: “I think 

Mackenzie is a 
wonderful role 
model for our 
team. She’s been 
a good captain, 
and I think the 
younger players 
can look up to 
her as she leads 
by example and 
learn that there 
is always a path 
for 
everybody 

on the team, and to see her as a 
wonderful example that hard 
work pays off.”

Not only has Ellis become a 

proven leader on the field, she has 
also taken that leadership into the 

classroom and community. She 
earned the Rachael Townsend 
Community 
Service 
Award 

two years ago and is using her 
fifth year to complete a master’s 
degree in management through 
the Ross School of Business.

“I think that as a student-

athlete, at Michigan especially, 
we are given so much,” Ellis 
said. 
“We 
have 
incredible 

opportunities, and we’re taken 
care of and we’re looked up 
to by people. I think it’s really 
important to have perspective 
and to be able to give back to the 
community.”

In addition to her work in 

the community, Ellis remains 
dedicated to improving her game 
for the remainder of her final 
year. Ellis may be a defensive-
minded captain, and it may have 
taken her five years to hit the 
back of the net, but she has finally 
shown she is capable of doing 
whatever it takes to lead her team 
to victory.

Fifth-year senior Mackenzie Ellis has worked her way up to become a captain.

Freshmen make impact

By RILEY NELSON

Daily Sports Writer

For most teams, the beginning 

of a new season comes with 
a mixture of expectation and 
uncertainty.

But for the Michigan women’s 

soccer team, excitement seems to 
be the dominant feeling.

After falling just shy of making 

the NCAA Tournament last 
season, the team graduated five 
seniors, but only one of those 
players consistently started, and 
100 percent of the team’s goal 
scoring returned.

While veteran players are 

stepping up and taking on bigger 
roles, another contributing factor 
to the team’s current 5-3 record 
is its six freshmen, who have 
already made their presence felt.

All of the first-years, save 

for forward Kelly Sweeney – 
who tore her anterior cruciate 
ligament over the summer – have 
seen playing time. Midfielder 
Abby Kastroll, defender Sura 
Yekka and forward Reilly Martin 
have started.

“As a class, they’re a fantastic 

group,” Ryan said. “For those 
three, the sky’s the limit in 
potential. It’s very likely you’re 
going to see all three of them 
in the starting lineup as they 
continue to grow and develop.”

Yekka, an outside back on 

the Canadian National Team, 

has steadily filled that defensive 
position, 
something 
Ryan 

struggled to do last year.

Despite 
being 
sidelined, 

Sweeney also played on the 
international 
circuit 
this 

summer. A member of the U.S. 
U-20 National Team, she was 
predicted to be one of the top 
freshmen 
in 

this class.

Sweeney’s 

absence has left 
an 
offensive 

void, but it has 
allowed other 
players, 
like 

Kastroll 
and 

Martin, to step 
up.

“(Kastroll) has been the real 

surprise,” Ryan said. “I mean 
she’s just relentless out there. 
(She’s) leading the group in goals 
… (and) has made a huge, huge 
impact on her team already. 
(She’s) going to be a handful for 
opponents for four years.”

A native of Naples, Fla., 

Kastroll is excited to be in such a 
competitive environment.

“I’ve never been around so 

many people that love the game 
as much as I do,” Kastroll said. 
“As a freshman class, I feel like 
we came in ready to play.”

Martin has also proven herself 

on the field, starting in six of the 
eight games. She has netted two 
goals on the season, but Ryan is 

certain it won’t take long before 
the floodgates open.

“We’re 
really 
challenging 

her to do more in terms of goal-
scoring production,” Ryan said. 
“We need to get her scoring more 
goals because she’s a fantastic 
goal scorer.”

Martin is focusing on earning 

her 
playing 

time 
and 

taking 
every 

opportunity 
that comes her 
way.

“I think my 

biggest worry 
was just trying 
to get out there 

on the field and earn playing 
time,” Martin said. “Each day at 
practice, we try to work as hard as 
we can (for a spot). It’s just such an 
honor being able to step onto the 
field and play for Michigan.”

Ryan has spoken highly of the 

final two freshmen, midfielders 
Jackie 
White 
and 
Ashley 

Calcagno, saying they have a 
bright future ahead of them.

As the Wolverines get ready 

to begin competing in Big Ten 
matches, 
the 
freshmen 
are 

focusing on the season ahead 
and 
continuing 
to 
integrate 

themselves into the team.

“Our connection to the team 

has come a long way,” Martin 
said. “We are such a talented 
team.”

I 

spend a lot of time listen-
ing to hip hop, and I also 
spend a lot of time studying 

neo-Hegelian philosophy. If you 
peruse my Twitter, you’ll see 
that the majority of my tweets 
are about the 
dialectics of 
the Based 
God, which 
is what hap-
pens when 
you gradually 
mold your 
subconscious 
into a trendy 
melange of 
Slavoj Žižek 
one-liners 
and Young Thug noises. On my 
about.me page, I describe myself 
as a “SoundCloud philosopher,” 
which, depending on your poli-
tics, makes me either the worst 
kind of pretentious asshole 
imaginable or a “cool” guy. I pre-
fer the latter approach, but I’m 
also someone who prides himself 
on being the only person at this 
University who has ever made it 
necessary for someone to actu-
ally say the words “Shut the fuck 
up about commodity fetishism, 
we’re trying to play 2K.”

So, more often than not, I find 

myself desperately clinging to an 
absurd middle ground between 
cultures and vocabularies that, at 
first glance, seem diametrically 
opposed to one another. When 
hearing 
Chief 
Keef’s 
song 

“3Hunna,” for example, my first 
inclination after muttering “bang 
bang” to myself is to read the 
track as a radical nihilist anthem 
exploring the impossible subject 
position of a person trapped on 
the horizonless fringe of global 
capital, as a cry for help from a 
young man who realizes that even 
if he manages to upgrade from 
“three hunna” to “six hunna” 
he’ll never find his way out of O 
block, a realization so pessimistic 
that he ends the song with the 
self-negating gesture of shouting 
“Fuck my birthday, bitch, I need 
more cake.” On the other hand, I 
realize that a sentence combining 
the phrases “horizonless fringe 

of global capital” and “Fuck my 
birthday bitch” looks a lot like a 
dadaist word salad, which gives 
you a sense of what it’s like to 
be inside my head on any given 
Thursday.

But as ridiculous as it might 

seem — and I hope you can excuse 
my obscene narcissism here — I 
think the inner workings of my 
mind say something important 
about hip hop’s cultural status 
today. Like rock music in the 1950s 
and ’60s, hip hop has become the 
music of modern youth, which is 
to say that it provides the cultural 
vocabulary through which we 
narrate our experience of the 
world. It serves as the soundtrack 
for our parties, our relationships, 
our ever-changing personalities 
and 
our 
developing 
political 

consciousness, and it does so in 
a way that’s considerably more 
accommodating of racial diversity 
and technological innovation than 
rock music ever was. Importantly, 
however, through its celebration 
of African American culture and 
the Black experience, hip hop also 
creates an intriguing challenge 
for the western philosophical 
tradition: 
how 
to 
develop 
a 

vocabulary capable of articulating 
the struggle of a community 
whose historical marginalization 
has been conducted on a linguistic 
and philosophical level as much as 
on a physical one.

Put another way, self-styled 

young assholes intellectuals like 
me who grew up reading Sartre 
and 
Nietzsche 
with 
Outkast 

and Kanye West playing in the 
background are reaching the 
point of entry into institutional 
academia, convinced of the moral 
necessity of addressing the social 

ills hip hop illustrates with its 
often grim realism and working 
to find a vocabulary with enough 
intellectual rigour to go toe-to-toe 
with Kant and Hegel and enough 
social awareness to hear the pain 
behind the Migos flow.

And, perhaps unsurprisingly, 

there 
already 
a 
number 
of 

academics studying and writing 
about hip hop in English and 
Cultural 
Studies 
departments 

across the country. A few notable 
scholars on the subject include 
Adam Bradley at the University 
of Colorado, Elaine Richardson 
at Ohio State and Gwendolyn 
Pough at Syracuse University, 
all of whom have spent years 
laying the groundwork for and 
developing critical studies of hip 
hop culture, drawing on the work 
of previous cultural theorists and 
philosophers as diverse as Amiri 
Baraka, Pierre Bourdieu, bell 
hooks and Mikhail Bakhtin. They 
and the myriad other musicians, 
critics and researchers turning 
their minds and talents towards 
the rigorous examination of hip 
hop’s place in modern society are 
doing essential work, both for 
hip hop itself and the academic 
disciplines 
benefiting 
from 
a 

radical reexamination of their 
theoretical models and massive 
expansion of their source material.

An interesting development in 

recent years, however, is seeing 
hip hop’s experience in academia 
make its way back into the music. 
An intellectual approach to hip 
hop, in a way, predates the music 
itself — Gil Scott-Heron, often 
considered the godfather of rap, 
held a Master’s degree in Creative 
Writing from Johns Hopkins 
University and approached his 
music and poetry with a political 
sensibility 
informed 
by 
the 

work of Langston Hughes and 
Malcolm X, among others. The 
first hip hop artists immediately 
grasped onto that brand of erudite 
social awareness — Public Enemy 
frontman Chuck D describes 
Scott-Heron as “the manifestation 
of the modern world” — and 
reached a peak of stylistic diversity 
in the mid-to-late ’90s in the work

College Hip Hop: 
From Kant to Kanye 

ALBUM REVIEW

Jay Rock’s ‘90059’ is 
solid, traditional rap

By SHAYAN SHAFII

Daily Arts Writer

“I be that n***a they call Jay 

Rock / I’m a rapper.” In a time 
where the phrase “I’m not a rapper, 
I’m an artist” is 
all too common, 
Jay Rock is com-
fortable in his 
own skin. When 
Kanye 
West 

made the cover 
of Time maga-
zine this year, 
A$AP 
Rocky 

took to Twitter 
to announce that the cover made 
him “proud to be a rapper,” while 
his last album also distanced him-
self from the genre. Chance the 
Rapper and Kendrick Lamar have 
made crossover projects into funk 
and jazz, and Tyler, the Creator 
wants to be a film director … Even 
Drake transcends hip hop every 
now and then to remind us that he 
can also be a new-wave R&B artist.

But make no mistake, Jay Rock 

is a “rapper” in the most tradi-
tional sense, and 90059 is a “rap 
album.” He’s not a technical word-
smith of the Kendrick Lamar ilk, 
a conspiratorial psychonaut in the 
form of Ab-Soul, or a bucket hat-
donning party-boy like Schoolboy 
Q, and there’s nothing wrong with 
that. Most known for a verse on 
a song that isn’t even his, Rock is 
carried through 90059 by a level of 
honesty that makes even the most 
boring artists (yes you, J. Cole) 
worth listening to.

Though the album does have 

its fair share of fillers and audio 
sandpaper, Jay Rock at least 
presents himself as a regu-
lar dude. More specifically, he 
takes pride in maintaining a 
level of authenticity of keep-it-
real-ness that makes hip-hop 
as much sport as art; the video 
for “Parental Advisory” even 
includes shots of him bench-
pressing in his front yard. While 
it’s unfair to ask an artist to fit 
your arbitrary model of “enter-
taining,” the least they can do is 
provide some sort of transpar-
ency in answering who they are 
and where they’re from behind 
the mic. 90059 sees Jay Rock at 
his best when he lets his guard 
down to let us know the impor-
tance of keeping your guard up 

in South Central LA.

He wastes no time on “Neces-

sary” where the hook sees him 
murmur, “You gotta do what 
you got to just get over the hill 
/ When you live in America, 
either kill or be killed.” The 
production on “Easy Bake” fea-
tures the types of shrill string 
accompaniment 
that 
West 

Coast vets like Dr. Dre would be 
proud of, the type that could be 
used in an IMAX feature film. 
It’s a shame, however, because 
the song is packed with the type 
of played out rappity-raps you’d 
expect from a high-schooler: we 
get it, you started from the bot-
tom and now you’re cool on the 
Internet.

Fortunately, Rock stops him-

self five minutes into “Easy 
Bake” (perhaps a few minutes 
too late), mid-sentence, to cut 
into one of the standout tracks, 
“Gumbo.” It’s everything that 
screams contemporary West 
Coast rap rolled into a track 
that I can only imagine would 
knock in a ’64 Impala. While 
the song does have some rather 
generic “I’m real” bars, Rock 
interestingly opens up about his 
hood vantage point. “Keep my 
chin down, nose clean, and my 
guard up / Charged up, cause 
this ghetto got me scarred up.” 
Key word being “scarred.” The 
sensation of being left physi-
cally and emotionally wounded 
by your neighborhood is not 
new to rap music, and if any-
thing, it’s something that’s been 
consistent with contemporary 

art made by young black men 
in America. However, the wide-
spread nature of gang violence 
and racial tension shouldn’t 
diminish the value of this man’s 
individual expression.

Enter “Money Trees Deuce”: 

the culmination of Jay Rock’s 
black experience as well as his 
position as underdog in the Black 
Hippy collective. The title itself 
is an allusion to the song that we 
all know him from … is this his 
attempt at taking the spotlight? 
Is it Jay Rock’s turn? Though 
90059 unfortunately has a lot 
of forgettable tracks, he really 
hits the nail on the head with 
this one. If you only get to listen 
to one song, this is the one you 
need to hear. He sets the stage 
with horns ominously bringing 
in the track, and at this point 
in the music video he’s already 
running from police.

“Gotta get it, ain’t no options 

out here / Her n***a just killed 
my partner out here” is about 
as cold and explicit as you could 
ask for. You might be inclined 
to think, “Yeah, we’ve heard it 
before” when you hear a rap-
per talk about dead homies, but 
this isn’t Ricky from “Boyz n the 
Hood.” These are real tales from 
a real person from a real place. 
Yes, Jay Rock can be unimagi-
native and boring; he is “just a 
rapper” and 90059 is “just a rap 
album,” but it’s still important to 
give his stories the respect they 
deserve. After all, rap music has 
always been about giving voice to 
the voiceless.

of a range of MCs and collectives 
from Queen Latifah, Mos Def (now 
Yasiin Bey) and Common to 2Pac, 
Digable Planets and The Roots.

The tradition continued into 

the new millennium, carried on 
by many of the same musicians 
who were making political rap 
in the ’90s. But in the mid-2000s 
hip hop artists began to question 
the culture assembled around 
their music in profound ways, 
and encounters with academia 
often helped to inspire that self-
critique. 
Kanye 
West’s 
debut 

album The College Dropout is 
perhaps the best documentation of 
this phenomenon, and while just 
about everyone acknowledges that 
it was one of the biggest watershed 
moments in the history of hip hop, 
most people find it so hard to look 
past Kanye’s egotism that they 
can’t see lines like “Sittin’ in the 
hood like community colleges / 
This dope money here is Lil’ Trey’s 
scholarship” off of “We Don’t 
Care” or “The concept of school 
seems so securr / Sophomore, 
three yurrs, she ain’t picked a 
carurr / She like, fuck it, I’ll just 
stay down here and do hair” from 
“All Falls Down” for what they are: 
a stunning portrait of the Black 
collegiate experience at the end of 
the 20th century.

You can trace the influence 

of The College Dropout — an 
illustration of what happens 
when promises about status-
conferring education run up 
against the inescapable demands 
of 
the 
same 
socioeconomic 

hardship college is meant to 
address — straight through to 
the work of some of the most 
famous and explicitly political 
rappers doing it today, including 
Lupe Fiasco, J. Cole, Kendrick 
Lamar and Chance the Rapper. 
Equally 
important, 
however, 

Kanye made it possible for a hip 
hop artist to talk about academia 
and the collegiate experience, 
mostly to criticize the university 

system and question its status as 
a pipeline to African American 
liberation (you can hear echoes 
of this critique every time a Black 
person who “acts right,” like UVA 
student Martese Johnson, finds 
themselves subjected to racial 
profiling and warrantless police 
violence). But beyond critique, 
this new subject area gave birth 
to any number of student-rappers 
(of various races) who began 
using hip hop to talk about what 
it’s like to be a college student 
— think Asher Roth (West 
Chester University), Das Racist 
(Wesleyan University) and every 
dude with a SoundCloud who 
lives on your floor in East Quad 
(myself included). I guarantee 
you that every single one of them 
spent years of their life debating 
whether to start wearing shutter 
shades as part of their daily 
ensemble.

And as soon as college kids 

started rapping about skipping 
class to smoke weed, the rap game 
only needed a short theoretical 
jump to get dudes like me, 
whose idea of a fun time involves 
reading Walter Benjamin essays, 
spitting about the finer points of 
continental philosophy. Which 
brings us to the current final 
form of college rap: Milo.

Born 
Rory 
Ferreira 
in 

Kenosha, Wisconsin, Milo is 
without question the most hyper-
intellectual rapper to ever do 
it. In interviews, he weighs the 
pros and cons of a deontological 

moral stance and throws around 
Schopenhauer quotes in the 
same way Waka Flocka throws 
around 
“Brick 
Squad!”s. 
He 

made an album entirely out of 
America samples, titles songs 
with things like “Gaudeamus 
igitur (For Kang Min-Gyu),” had 
one of his lyrics published by the 
Johns Hopkins University Press 
and has the distinction of being 
the only rapper to have ever 
released a track that includes 
an explanation of the Kantian 
notion of the Sublime (with 
reference to Kim Kardashian’s 
ass, no less).

But beyond appealing to the 

pedantic 
philosophile 
living 

inside my head, however, I find 
Milo 
incredibly 
fascinating 

because he seems to have found 
a way to bridge the gap between 
Kant 
and 
Kanye, 
between 

the technical jargon used in 
American academic circles and 
the cultural vocabulary available 
to the rest of hip hop’s MC roster. 
He’s occupying the sort of middle 
ground Kanye inhabited in 2004 
— the kind of fertile territory 
that can produce major cultural 
shifts, provided that an artist 
with the right blend of vision 
and stubbornness makes their 
way onto the field. Depending 
on how things go, Milo and like-
minded artists (and there are 
a few, including Hellfyre Club 
labelmates Open Mike Eagle 
and Busdriver and Kool A.D. of 
Das Racist) could produce a new 
type of musical avant-garde: art 
rap with the kind of enlightened 
pessimism and semi-ironic pop 
culture reference that makes 
critics and people who like to 
think of themselves as “cultured” 
get googly eyes and start shelling 
out cash.

DePollo is terribly sorry for 

reminding everyone about Asher 

Roth. To demand a personal letter of 

apology, email adepollo@umich.edu.

Student-rappers 

began using 

hip hop to talk 
about college.

“Shut the 

fuck up about 
commodity 
fetishism.”

NEW YORK FASHION WEEK SPRING 2016 ROUNDUP

 Diane Von Furstenberg’s 
NYFW show comes off the heels 
of the 40th anniversary of the 
brand’s signature wrap dress 
and designers of the Spring 2016 
Ready To Wear collection pay 
homage to the timeless garment: 
v-shaped necklines and cinched 
waists were abound on Sunday’s 
DVF runway.
 The collection works to 
display its strengths through 
diverse pops of ’80s-esque col-
ors, neutral shades of beige and 
ultimately a slew of sleek black 
and white dresses. Each aspect 
of DVF’s show displays the range 
of her talent and brand. The 
bolder pieces, featuring various 
floral prints, are extreme, yet 
accessible. The solids each have 
their own flare — a silver chee-
tah print around the waist, or 
colorful flare covering pockets — 
creating cohesiveness across the 
diverse collection.
 Butterflies make an appear-
ance a few too many times. First, 

they’re embroidered in gold on 
the collections white dresses 
and then again on black dresses 
(the second time around is decid-
edly better). Nonetheless, the 
experimentation with butterflies 
does well on the show’s finale 
garment. Gigi Hadid’s black, 
floor-length gown with a plung-
ing neckline featured only two 
visible gold butterflies — just the 
right amount.
 Between her killer line-up 
of models (Kendall Jenner and 
Karlie Kloss preceded Hadid), 
expansive collection and the 
design house’s new E! television 
series, it would appear that DVF 
is looking to expand its clientele 
into the younger generation. This 
collection has a range that will 
surely net a few on-lookers.
 Florals for spring may not be 
groundbreaking, but under the 
prowess of Von Furstenberg, 
they sure are stunning.

GIVENCHY
JEREMY SCOTT

 Riccardo Tisci dissects what it 
means to be a woman in today’s 
world with his latest Spring 2016 
collection for Givenchy and, well, 
it’s complicated.
 Each piece — in white, black, 
gold or silver — seems simple at 
first glance. However just like 
every modern day woman, the 
designs are complex and intri-
cate. 
 Beginning with the more soft, 
and some would say traditional, 
side of things, we saw a lot of 
silks embroidered with lace com-
ing down the runway. Camisoles 
in neutral tones and slip dresses 
paired with sleek black pants for 
work — it embraced the elegance 
of traditional women’s fashion 
and coupled it with the edginess 
of the working woman.
 The soft tones and fabrics seen 
at the start of the collection soon 
began to evolve; paired with 
structured and hard-looking 
lace-up military-esque heels, 
showcasing Tisci’s societal tran-
sition. To be a woman today also 
brings with it ideas of strength 
and power. Women are soft and 

strong, domineering and exqui-
site. Models strutted down in 
tuxedo jackets, pinstriped suits 
equipped with flared pants (yes, 
pinstripes are back), portraying 
the ultimate badass woman, a 
force to be reckoned with both at 
home and in the world.
 On the one hand, we have 
been brought up to associate 
women with classic femininity, 
oftentimes being contrasted to 
the likes of ethereal goddesses 
and otherworldly phenomenon. 
Tisci’s couture collection was 
featured intermittently through-
out the show and provided a 
contrast between dark and light. 
With some pieces emanating 
golden tones, a crowd favor-
ite being a structured white 
jacket covered with metallic gold 
embellishments, equipped with 
a (badass) matching headpiece. 
Then darker looks featuring 
black ruffles, feathers, net and 
mesh, oftentimes all at once, still 
managed to work in nicely with 
the rest of the collection.

 Jeremy Scott gets it. Jeremy 
Scott gets us. Jeremy Scott got 
it right.
 Scott doesn’t strike me as a 
wise old man, but more of the 
fashion world’s witty uncle 
who inadvertently delivers cold 
truths in a sardonic manner. And 
that’s just what he did with his 
Spring 2016 collection.
 Was he sourcing inspiration 
from the remarkable, other-
worldly production quality of his 
K-pop coterie? Likely. Did he just 
release Miley’s upcoming ward-
robe? Probably. Was this the 
result of an acid trip gone right? 
Signs point to yes.
 Fashion’s virtuous oddball 
presented his newest line on 
Monday, one that rendered our 
pop-culture poisoned minds 
onto the bodies of models — 
hello, Hadid sisters — topped off 
with boisterous bouffants. In a 
mixed bag of crop tops, A-line 
silhouettes, a crop of menswear 
looks (will 2016 be the year of the 
speedo and loafers combo?), leo-
tards and even a metallic cone-

bra, Scott’s line is marked by his 
signature, absurdist indicators 
of effective artistry — he mocks 
us as he mocks himself, and it’s 
completely fascinating.
 Punctuated by punchy hues 
of orange and cobalt, along with 
funky patchwork and scribbles 
(please pause to admire that 
pleather-accented, scribbled 
trench), the collection is car-
toonish and animated with an 
overarching ‘60s sci-fi flair. It’s 
costume-y, yet utterly wearable.
 Effective fashion, how-
ever outlandish it appears to the 
naked eye, performs a cultural 
critique, and Scott’s is obvious. 
It’s no novel idea to hear that 
our lives are saturated in screen 
time, rampant materialism and 
overexposure, but to see our 
societal flaws in such a meta-
presentation, outsourced from a 
visionary guilty of these weak-
nesses himself, makes for a liv-
ing, sartorial think piece worthy 
of a ponder.

VICTORIA BECKHAM

 From the first appearance 
of Gingham, it was clear that 
this collection was going to 
be different for Victoria Beck-
ham. For spring/summer, VB 
landed far outside her comfort 
zone, somewhere in the land of 
urban surf prints and crinkled 
duchesse satin. Midi swing 
dresses, printed separates and 
flats were constant throughout 
the show to showcase VB’s 
attempt at a fun and carefree 
collection. A standout look fea-
tured a white above-the-ankle 

swing dress with primary red 
and blue details and chunky 
white flats.
 The collection played with 
primary colors as overlays 
to all-white ensembles or as 
color-blocked separates. These 
looks beautifully emulate the 
fun and carefree spirit VB was 
hoping to achieve with this col-
lection. Then came the urban 
surf prints and multi-print 
looks. When used sparingly, the 
prints looked fantastic, rocking 
the LA-London duality that is 

ALEXANDER WANG

 Alexander Wang’s 10th anni-
versary collection debuted at 
NYFW and came equipped with 
lavish performers and an impres-
sive front row audience. The 
atmosphere of the show was con-
trasted with what some would 
call the old school collection.
 Wang held true to his down-
town girl aesthetic featuring 
staple pieces such as a shrunken 
bomber and biker-esque leather 
jackets. Stripes appear to be 
the hottest thing to (attempt) to 
make a comeback this Fashion 
Week, and this collection was no 
exception. Showcasing combina-
tions of various patterns, mate-
rials, styles and colors, Wang 
perfected casual looks by giving 
them his signature grungy edge.
And no urban look of 2015 can 
be complete without the intro-
duction of rugged mesh tops, 
because, let’s remember, it’s still 

considered a shirt even if the 
material doesn’t actually cover 
everything underneath.
 What struck me most about 
this particular collection was 
how androgynous many of the 
looks were. In a society where 
gender lines are becoming 
blurred, it was as if most of the 
pieces could work for men or 
women. Hooded jackets hid 
models’ hair, coupled with their 
minimal makeup and the clothes’ 
baggy appearance in general was 
very gender neutral.
 Wang’s anniversary collection 
managed to stay true to his origi-
nal roots, displaying simplistic 
and urban pieces, while still 
giving the star-studded crowd 
something to talk about — other 
than the stripes of course.

RALPH LAUREN

 Honestly, God bless Ralph 
Lauren. After a week of over-
whelming colors, prints and 
shapes, one can always count 
on Ralph to supply a beautiful 
collection of elegance and clas-
sic silhouettes. That is not to say 
these looks are boring, overdone 
or stuck in the past. Rather, 
Ralph delivered 50 looks for the 
modern woman. No one does 
red, white and blue like this man. 
No one.
 The collection was bursting 
with classic summer whites 
and covered all the essentials — 
simple cocktail dresses, killer 
wedges, navy blazers and endless 
takes on the white pant. Lauren 
effortlessly blends caramel leath-

er and navy blue sweaters, which 
included six of the sickest leather 
jackets you’ve ever seen. Among 
the sea of perfect stripes, cash-
mere sweaters and red trench 
coats, the designer surprised 
with three looks of eye-popping 
print. The star of the show was 
the floor-length chiffon gown 
featuring this multi-colored 
geometric print. The collection 
was beautifully designed and 
constructed, the norm for Ralph 
Lauren. It makes for the per-
fect spring/summer wardrobe, 
whether by the lake in Northern 
Michigan or the mediterranean 
along the Côte d’Azur.

OSCAR DE LA RENTA

 Though the beloved, quippy 
Erika Bearman (@OscarPR-
girl) is soon to switch over to 
motherhood and the consulting 
side of the fashion house, she 
continued to release collection 
teasers by Fabien Constant on 
her Instagram, showcasing 
“The Story of a Dress” — which 
is essentially the tale of ODLR, 
a label that prides itself on a 
quasi-couture mastery of out-
fitting women. Unsurprisingly, 
the brilliant cinematography 
didn’t disappoint, and once 
again, the house of Oscar de 
la Renta created fashion of 
fantasy.
 Peter Copping’s sophomore 
collection — the senior install-
ment of his work if you include 
the sublime resort and bridal 
shows under his creative direc-
tion — for the house of Oscar de 
la Renta proves he’s mastered 
the reins of the label, yet con-
tinues to seamlessly imbue a 
personal panache that we’re 
still trying to grasp. He’s some-
how struck a balance between 

the label’s rich design tradition 
and the constant desire for 
modernity in the ever-evolving 
fashion world.
 Whatever that je ne sais 
quoi is, it’s working — with 
his Spring 2016 line, Copping 
delivers the late de la Renta’s 
refined romance and ampli-
fied femininity with a thematic 
twist. The collection radiates a 
rich Hispanic flair with recur-
ring motifs of carnations and 
crimson, continuous ruching 
and requisite espadrilles; and 
of course, no ODLR would be 
complete without eveningwear 
that leaves you breathless (I 
will take personal offense if the 
stunning lilac ball gown isn’t 
worn during awards season).
The sartorial sphere will for-
ever miss the beloved taste-
maker they found in Oscar de 
la Renta, and though the void is 
irreplaceable, Copping contin-
ues to eschew any doubts of his 
succession.

 At some point in time a lucky 
few received camouflage shirts 
in the mail — this fall’s invite to 
Kanye West’s second collabora-
tion with Adidas. As of yesterday 
afternoon, Yeezy Season 2 has 
commenced.
 Season 2’s NYFW debut stays 
consistent with the rigidity of 
the line’s debut this past Febru-
ary, but takes it one step further. 
Instead of models lined up in 
rows and moving forward to 
unveil a new set of garments, a 
drill sergeant calls out groups of 
models and gives them the order 
to walk. With each new group, 
on-lookers notice a slight change 
in the color of the clothing, 
which also corresponds with the 
complexion of the models. As 
the show goes on, both models 
and clothing move from light 
shades of beige to black.
 The collection itself stays true 
to Kanye’s aptitude toward the 
simple. Throughout the show a 
pattern is nowhere to be seen: 
only solids, tears and the texture 
of knit. The collection consists 
of pieces across the spectrum: 
tights, excessively baggy hood-
ies, knit leggings and high heels 
are just a glimpse into the offer-

ings of Season 2. Diversity aside, 
the beauty of West’s new line 
isn’t displayed on the monochro-
matic models (while they all 
do look stunning). The beauty 
lies within the possibilities — 
the possibilities of mixing and 
matching across the tones of the 
collection, or the possibilities of 
simply incorporating key pieces 
into a wardrobe.
 Ultimately, as with Season 
One, the most stunning pieces 
of the show are the shoes and 
the music. The Adidas Yeezy 
Boosts, the Yeezy Duck boot 
and its high-heeled counter-
part are the crème de la crème, 
furthering Kanye’s already 
strong standing reputation 
as a shoe designer. West also 
opted to use the show to pre-
miere a new track from his 
forthcoming album, Swish, 
titled “Fade” featuring Post 
Malone and Ty Dolla $ign.
 Who knows if Yeezus 2020 
will be a reality, but one thing 
is for certain: Kanye West and 
his commitment to creation 
and artistry won’t be going 
anywhere anytime soon.

GIVENCHY

synonymous with the Beckham 
fam. For some of the looks, 
though, the emphasis on prints 
took away from the overall 
craftsmanship of the striking 
culottes and jackets. Kudos to 
VB for trying and succeeding in 
taking a large step toward the 
carefree and fun.
 Aside from the typical buzz 
about Brooklyn and David sit-
ting front row, the Victoria 
Beckham show created a sig-
nificant discussion in the fash-
ion world. British news struck 

out against Beckham for her 
skinny and miserable looking 
models. The show has ignited a 
discussion about models’ looks, 
but also about British news’ 
obsession with Victoria’s body 
image. This has been an on-
going problem for her since her 
Spice Girls days. Some argue 
that her models look no differ-
ent than those of other design-
ers, while others state this is 
the trademark VB.

Jim Harbaugh’s first win as coach came last week against Oregon 
State. Now, against an inferior foe, his Wolverines look to defend 
Michigan Stadium once again in Saturday’s game against UNLV. 
The Rebels, led by first-year coach Tony Sanchez, have struggled 
in the early going. Saturday will be a chance for Michigan to 
prove its days of struggling against lesser opponents are over.

The Daily breaks down Michigan’s 
advantage in Saturday’s matchup.

Utah (Sept. 3): Well, at least the mountains 
were cool?

Oregon State (Sept. 12): Imagine how Jim 
Harbaugh would have freaked out if Michigan 
lost.

Michigan State (Oct. 17): These teams play a 
week earlier than last year, which Mark Danto-
nio will take as a sign of blatant disrespect.

Minnesota (Oct. 31): Plot twist: Michigan plays 
Minnesota for the Little Orange Pumpkin.

Rutgers (Nov. 7): Will Michigan fans storm the 
field if the Wolverines avenge last year’s loss in 
Piscataway? We hope not.

UNLV (Sept. 19): Did you mean the University 
of Nevada-Loss Vegas?

Indiana (Nov. 14): Boring state. Hopefully not a 
boring game.

BYU (Sept. 26): We don’t know who will score 
more points, but we do know who will leave the 
game with more wives.

Maryland (Oct. 3): Rumor has it, if you stare at 
Maryland’s state flag for too long, you become 
absorbed into the pattern.

Northwestern (Oct. 10): Are you ready for 
M00N pt. 2: N00M?

Ohio State (Nov. 28): We wanted to make a 
joke, but the only one we could think of was, 
“Haha, your backup QB might win the Heisman.”

Penn State (Nov. 21): Christian Hackenberg 
could be a first-round pi — aaand, he just got 
sacked again.

UNLV coach Sanchez creates 
mystery in matchup with ‘M’

Sanchez, Harbaugh 
match wits in battle 
of first-year coaches

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

On 
paper, 
the 
Michigan 

football team’s third foe of the 
season is its least 
daunting so far. 
UNLV 
enters 

Saturday’s game 
at 
Michigan 

Stadium lacking 
three things: a 
win, 
a 
Power 

Five conference 
affiliation 
and 

an 
established 

college football 
coach.

But it is the 

third of those 
shortcomings 
that 
could 

have made the 
Wolverines’ 
preparation for Saturday’s contest 
difficult. The Rebels are led by 
coach Tony Sanchez who — like 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
— is in his first year at the school. 
However, Sanchez’s résumé looks 
very different from Harbaugh’s: 
Prior to this season, he had never 
held a position higher than an 
undergraduate assistant at the 
collegiate level. Now, Sanchez is 
faced with a thorough rebuilding 
job. His team won just two games 
last season.

Sanchez arrived at UNLV this 

offseason from Bishop Gorman 
High School in Las Vegas, where 
he compiled an 85-5 record in 
six seasons to go along with six 
straight 
state 
titles. 
Sanchez 

sent 25 players to Football Bowl 
Subdivision schools during his 
tenure at Bishop Gorman. Prior 
to his time at Bishop Gorman, 

Sanchez 
had 
held 
various 

different coaching positions at 
high schools in California, New 
Mexico and Texas.

Michigan was forced to get a 

little creative in preparing for 
the Rebels this week because of 
Sanchez’s limited body of work 
at the collegiate level. Harbaugh 
said Monday that the Wolverines 
would study film of the teams 
Sanchez’s assistants have worked 
with in the past. But making 
judgments 
and 
preparations 

solely based off of Sanchez’s high 
school games could be difficult. 

Harbaugh did not seem overly 

concerned with the proposition, 
confident that his staff would 
get the job done and “dive in and 
start attacking” the preparation. 
Harbaugh, though he has never 
met Sanchez in person, has been 
impressed with UNLV’s coach.

“I like that he’s come from a 

non-traditional way of doing it,” 
Harbaugh said. “I like following 
him. I like watching what his 
career’s going to be like. He’s had 
success. Looks good. I like the 
way he coaches his team. I like 
the way they’re playing. But at 
the same time, we’ve got to guard 
against it and make sure we play 
well.”

The matchup could present 

another 
opportunity 
for 

Michigan’s run game to gel. The 
Wolverines rushed for 225 yards 
last weekend against Oregon 
State, providing the team with 
something to build off of against 
UNLV’s rush defense, which has 
struggled so far this year. The 
Rebels allowed 273 yards on the 
ground last weekend against 
UCLA and 185 in their season 
opener against Northern Illinois. 
If Michigan can pound the run 
game, it could open things up 
and render some of the question 
marks about UNLV’s game plan 
irrelevant.

The 
Rebels’ 
pass 
defense, 

though, should enter the game 
with some level of confidence. 
UNLV intercepted three passes 
against the Bruins last weekend, 
and even though two of them 
came late in the game when 
UCLA’s 
backup 
quarterback 

was under center, the Rebels 
did manage to pick off Bruins 
freshman sensation Josh Rosen 
once. Michigan fifth-year senior 
quarterback Jake Rudock will 
look to avoid the same fate after 
starting off his Wolverine career 
with four interceptions in two 
games.

If he’s able to control the 

turnovers, Sanchez’s first win 
at 
the 
collegiate 
level 
will 

be much harder to come by. 
But no matter what happens 
Saturday, 
Harbaugh 
believes 

Sanchez’s 
wins 
will 
come, 

despite his unorthodox coaching 
background.

“More than one way to skin a 

cat,” Harbaugh said.

“They kind of try to kill you to see what 

your motivation is,” Whitfield said. “You have 
to do 5 a.m. workouts for a full year and kind 
of get your butt kicked just to show that this is 
something that you want to do, instead of just 
going out there and saying ‘I’m on the football 
team, look at my jersey.’ ”

Most actually do quit. But, already behind 

in conditioning and game planning, even those 
who stay have virtually no shot at becoming 
champions that season. Instead, they’re 
automatically delegated to the scout team. It’s 
still Michigan football, but the agency is lost. 
Rather than having a jersey number, they wear 
their opponents’.

“I hated scout team. I openly hated it,” 

Whitfield said. “But you have to channel 
that, and I tried to channel that into basically 
kicking the ass of anyone who lined up against 
me or trying to make the defense look as bad as 
possible whenever I got the ball.”

Earning respect is equally hard. Players are 

skeptical of newcomers without a full summer 
of practicing and do their best to test out the 
new guys.

Whitfield remembered this clearly. During 

practice, he broke through a hole in the line 
with plenty of daylight. That daylight was 
sealed quickly by linebacker Jake Ryan, now 
a linebacker for the Green Bay Packers. The 
6-foot-3 Ryan crushed the 5-foot-4 Whitfield’s 
body, but not his spirit.

“A lot of people were looking at me seeing 

how I would handle being popped like that,” 
Whitfield said. “I got right back up, and after 
that, people kind of joked about it, but I think 
they saw then that I wasn’t going to quit — I was 
a part of the team.”

Getting hit by Ryan is tough, but the mental 

perseverance of pushing yourself even though 
you won’t see the field all season, maybe ever, 
is the tougher challenge. If you can’t find the 
motivation yourself, you don’t have to look far 
at Michigan.

***

Michigan has been among the premier 

collegiate football programs in the country 
for some time, and its walk-on players are no 
exception.

Former Michigan coach Bo Schembechler 

famously pushed his scout team and walk-ons 
harder than other schools, even chasing down 
scout team quarterback John Paciorek in 1985 
when he heard Paciorek planned on quitting.

He eventually gave the gunslinger his 

blessing to leave the program, but the message 
was clear.

“That Bo would even take the time out for 

a guy like me means more than you could ever 
imagine,” Paciorek told The Michigan Today in 
2011.

Astute Michigan fans will know that the 

starting quarterback the year Paciorek quit 
was current Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh. 
Though a scholarship player, Harbaugh himself 
spent 1982 on the scout team and never lost 
track of the importance of the walk-ons.

This came to fruition after Harbaugh’s first 

win as a coach at Michigan. After defeating 
Oregon State, 35-7, Harbaugh took all of 
30 seconds in his press conference before 
mentioning the key to success.

“I thought this (game) was won with the 

week of practice,” Harbaugh said. “Everybody 
contributed. The look team, the scout team, 
had its best week. Guys really challenging (the 
starters) made those practices extremely good.

“Hopefully this shows our team that these 

games can be won during the week. ... Our 
look squad was playing inspired. They were 
challenging, not just out there.” 

Harbaugh’s boss, interim Athletic Director 

Jim Hackett, stood off to the side, beaming. 
Schembechler once called him “the best demo 
team center in the whole 
country.”

Never mind that it had 

been decades since Hackett’s 
playing days. The effort 
bubbled 
through 
to 
the 

surface for Schembechler, 
and Harbaugh was having 
similar sentiments with his 
2015 team.

Some may dismiss the 

words as coach talk, but Whitfield, who went 
through the coach’s famous ‘submarine’ 
training camp, insists Harbaugh practices what 
he preaches, and that walk-ons and future NFL 
draft picks have a chance to shine.

“During this fall camp, it was the only time 

I’ve seen or heard of a scout team that had 
so many moving parts and so many starters 
taking reps on the scout team,” Whitfield said. 
“Literally any day, anyone could be on scout 
team, so we were constantly competing and 
constantly rolling that depth chart.”

***

The dream for every walk-on is to shed 

that title. With players retiring, graduating or 

not making it to campus, 
occasional 
scholarship 

openings come up.

Just before the Oregon 

State game, Allen and senior 
linebacker 
Dan 
Liesman 

were the fortunate ones to 
live that dream.

Through 
gimmicks, 

surprises and viral videos, 
other programs make a fuss 

about walk-ons getting scholarships. Under 
Harbaugh, who avoids gimmicks like the 
plague, it’s nothing more than a brief meeting 
and a handshake.

It may seem callous or unappreciative, but on 

the inside, it’s simply the recognition that walk-
ons were a part of the team all along.

Fifth-year senior fullback Joe Kerridge, 

who earned his scholarship two years and one 
day before being named team captain for this 
season, thinks this is the way to go. Kerridge 
nearly ended his career in high school due to 
a knee injury, but he earned an opportunity at 
Michigan. From then on, he was a nameless 
face sweating it all out in training camp, finding 
motivation in the quotes his father sent him 
every day. 

Among them:
Lead with silence, let your success do the 

talking.

For Kerridge, the light turned on. Suddenly 

the seemingly futile scout-team reps, the Friday 
workouts while the team traveled and the lack 
of scholarship meant something: The success 
doesn’t come from being noticed, it comes from 
contributing every day.

“It’s been a climb for me over these years,” 

Kerridge said. “Starting out as a walk-on, I tore 
my ACL in high school, I came in and had to 
fight through everything, finally was awarded 
that scholarship.”

It may seem like a lot of effort to be on the 

team, but that’s just how the walk-ons like it.

Walk-ons savor 

opportunity on Michigan 

football team

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Editor

The road to glory is paved with AstroTurf 

and illuminated by early-morning streetlights.

If you want to walk onto the Michigan 

football team, you’ll find that out quickly. 
You’ll also find out that practice starts at 4:45 
a.m., not the listed 5:00 start time. You’ll only 
make that mistake once.

You’ll soon realize that the road to glory 

is also paved with pain. Maybe it’s getting 
blown up on the scout team by a future NFL 
linebacker, maybe it’s holding a 45-pound plate 
over your head just because coach said so, or 
maybe it’s sitting in your room at home while 
your teammates enjoy a trip to Salt Lake City. 
Regardless, without a scholarship, the coaches 
don’t owe you anything, and they aren’t afraid 
to remind you.

Walk-on football players are buried in 

pads, buried in student loans and buried on 
the depth chart. Free time and energy are as 
scarce as playing time and recognition.

But the largely anonymous Wolverines 

lace up their cleats and savor it anyways, 
and Michigan simply wouldn’t be the same 
without them.

***

There’s no way to offer someone a walk-on 

opportunity without it being awkward.

You can try to tell a linebacker that he’s 

undersized, or assure a cornerback that you just 
want to see how he recovers from injury, or tell 
a fullback that fullbacks don’t get scholarships 
anymore.

You can tell them whatever you want, but 

every walk-on can read between your lines: 
Your team has a limit to how many scholarships 
it can give out, and you didn’t make the cut.

“When you go in as a walk-on, you don’t 

expect anything,” said ex-linebacker Mark 
Lawson, who walked onto the 2012 team after 
being an all-state linebacker in high school. 
“You really start from the bottom. You’re on 
the team, but you have the extra motive that, 
technically, you weren’t good enough for them 
to give you a scholarship, and you have to prove 
to everyone that you deserve to be there.”

Even with the slight, it was tough for Lawson 

to consider anywhere but Michigan. Few 
schools can offer a top-flight education, are 
close to his Grand Rapids home and happen to 
boast a football team he grew up rooting for.

Lawson is hardly alone, either. Of the 38 

walk-ons on Michigan’s latest roster, 25 are 
from the state of Michigan. Many of them 
turned down financial aid elsewhere to don the 
winged helmet.

Among those to make such a decision was 

kicker Kenny Allen, a senior from Fenton. The 
kicker had scholarship offers to Oregon State 
and Central Michigan and was in talks with 
other Big Ten schools, but he was drawn to Ann 
Arbor after years of spring games and football 
Saturdays.

“For me it was pretty easy — I always knew 

I wanted to come here,” Allen said. “It’s my 
dream school. I’ve always wanted to play for 
Michigan.

“It’s always in the back of everyone’s mind 

who’s still paying tuition, but 
I don’t think it was my first 
priority. I’m fine paying my 
student loans. I just want to 
play football and contribute.”

Fueled by pride with 

an 
opportunity 
in 
tow, 

Allen, Lawson and dozens 
more make the trek to 
Schembechler Hall. They 
know they’re the underdogs 
yearning for playing time, 
but they’re prepared to go after the starters’ 
jobs anyway.

***

The term ‘walk-on’ is an overstatement these 

days.

Generations ago, Michigan would carry as 

many scholarship football players as it could 
afford, often over 150, so any player on the 
team who didn’t earn a scholarship joined only 
by walking to practice one day and making a 
tryout — literally walking on.

But with many schools facing budget crises 

after the advent of Title IX and smaller schools 
struggling to make it in a sport dominated by 
dynasties, the NCAA limited scholarships to 
105 in 1973. They ruled to bring that total down 

to 95 in 1978 and 85 in 1992, a cap that remains 
in place today.

Suddenly 
the 
walk-ons 
were 
players 

previously offered scholarships, and the days 
when an athlete could literally walk on to the 

Michigan 
football 
team 

were effectively over.

Today, players have to 

hustle their way through 
discussions with coaches 
and recruiters, run through 
drills at camps and jump 
through hoops just to get 
noticed enough for a spot at 
practice.

“I felt like I really had to 

sell myself,” said one former 

player who spoke to the Daily on the condition 
of anonymity. “I was a three-star recruit, and 
(Michigan) State was ready to welcome me with 
open arms, but I had to heckle Michigan with 
my highlight video before they even noticed.”

The vast majority of walk-ons at Michigan 

could have taken a scholarship elsewhere, 
but instead took the uphill option with the 
Wolverines.

If they’re talented enough to play but not 

talented enough to earn a scholarship, they join 
20 or so others — known as preferred walk-ons 
— who make the initial 105-man roster.

Preferred walk-ons join the team in 

June, and are able to train with the team all 
summer and attend training camp with the 
scholarship players. They receive access to 
facilities, training tables, tutors and most other 

scholarship benefits — except the free tuition.

Despite the distinction, the preferred walk-

ons are welcomed by the rest of the team, on 
one condition: effort.

“Once you’re on the team, they don’t care 

about your title,” Allen said. “They care about if 
you are going to put in effort. You could be from 
Alaska, you could be a negative-five-star recruit 
for all they care. But if you come in and you give 
everything you’ve got, they respect you.”

Added senior Antonio Whitfield, who played 

for the team from January 2014 until last week: 
“As a walk-on, your opportunities might not 
be as as frequent as guys with a scholarship, 
but you’re going to get opportunities. … If you 
look at scout team as an opportunity to prove 
yourself, they’ll notice that, and they’ll find a 
way to get you onto the field.”

Respect is earned in football. But what if you 

never get that chance?

***

For the non-preferred walk-ons, life isn’t as 

easy.

The “regular” walk-ons aren’t allowed in 

training camp and preseason, so they have to 
wait for the roster limit to be removed at the 
start of the school year to formally try out. Even 
then, gaining acceptance is no picnic.

“They make you go through the worst 

workouts, both physically and mentally,” 
Lawson said. “Like seeing how long you can 
hold up a 40-pound plate.”

And that’s just on the first day.

Breakdown: Michigan vs. UNLV

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

Michigan and UNLV enter their 

Week 3 matchup riding completely 
opposite waves of momentum.

The Wolverines cruised to a 

35-7 win over Oregon State in 
coach 
Jim 
Harbaugh’s 
home 

debut, while the Rebels were the 
victims of a 37-3 pounding at the 
hands of No. 10 UCLA.

And 
while 
Michigan 
fans 

should have learned by now not 
to take an opponent for granted, 
this one feels lopsided coming in. 
UNLV runs the ball a lot, but that 
just happens to be the strength 
of the Wolverines’ defense. The 
Rebels also aren’t great at stopping 
the run, which is exactly what 
Michigan will try to make them 
do.

Here’s the Daily’s breakdown of 

the upcoming matchup:

Michigan pass offense vs. UNLV 
pass defense

Michigan 
passing 
game 

coordinator 
Jedd 
Fisch 
said 

Wednesday he would love for his 
quarterback to have 70 percent 
completions, 
two 
touchdowns 

and no interceptions in any game. 
For fifth-year senior Jake Rudock, 
achieving those goals may be a 
little tricky against the Rebels.

UNLV limited UCLA’s true 

freshman quarterback Josh Rosen 
to just 223 yards on 22-for-42 
passing with one touchdown and 
an interception. Some of those 
incompletions 
were 
unforced 

errors by Rosen, to be sure, but 
Rosen is also a more talented 
quarterback than Rudock.

The Bruins didn’t complete a 

pass longer than 29 yards, but that 
shouldn’t be much of a concern for 
Michigan, which will do most of 
its damage in the short- and mid-
range passing game.

Michigan has the edge in the 

passing game, but it likely won’t 
need it. The Wolverines should be 
up big by halftime, and if last week 
was any indication, they’ll roll 
with the ground game the rest of 
the way.

Edge: Michigan

Michigan rush offense vs. 

UNLV rush defense

A week after pounding Oregon 

State for 126 yards and three 
touchdowns, junior running back 

De’Veon Smith will have another 
chance to run wild against the 
Rebels. UNLV allowed 5.8 yards 
per carry to UCLA last week, and 
Michigan has a good chance to 
exploit the defense for similar 
numbers on Saturday.

Beyond 
Smith, 
Harbaugh 

indicated Monday that redshirt 
junior 
running 
back 
Drake 

Johnson would have a larger role 
in the offense this week. Johnson 
is coming off his second torn 
anterior cruciate ligament, but if 
he can emerge with a productive 
game this weekend, it would be 
great news for the Wolverines.

Johnson was able to pick up 

chunks of yards toward the end 
of last season, and he could be 
extremely valuable as a change of 
pace.

Michigan should be able to 

outmuscle UNLV at the line, 
and with Smith’s penchant for 
breaking tackles, it could be a long 
day for the Rebels.

Edge: Michigan

UNLV pass offense vs. Michigan 
pass defense

Even 
when 
their 
starting 

quarterback is at full health, this 
isn’t an area of strength for the 
Rebels. UNLV averages 192.5 pass 
yards per game, 88th-most in the 
country.

Things could be even worse 

against Michigan, as starting 
quarterback 
Blake 
Decker 
is 

questionable with a strained leg 
muscle.

If Decker can’t go, or is limited, 

sophomore Kurt Palandech will 
be under center for the Rebels. 
Palandech is inexperienced, so it’s 
unclear how much they’ll throw if 
he’s in the game. Against UCLA, he 
was 4-for-15 for four yards passing.

One thing UNLV does have in 

the passing game is a target who 
can challenge junior cornerback 
Jourdan Lewis. Devonte Boyd 
has eight receptions for 162 yards, 
including a 64-yard touchdown 
catch against Northern Illinois.

Still, there’s not much chance 

of the Rebels consistently making 
big plays through the air. Decker 
is a capable signal-caller, but he’s 
at the mercy of a relatively small 
offensive line and a Michigan 
pass rush that includes behemoth 
redshirt junior Willie Henry.

Edge: Michigan

UNLV 
rush 
offense 
vs. 

Michigan rush defense

Neither 
aspect 
of 
UNLV’s 

offense is very good, but if you 
were forced to pick one, its run 
game is slightly more threatening. 
Junior Keith Whitely is the go-to 
back when the Rebels run the ball, 
and he has been solid thus far in 
2015.

Whitely averages 4.3 yards per 

carry, and while that’s buoyed by 
one 41-yard rush, his 33 carries 
this season mean the Wolverines 
can expect to see a steady dose of 
him Saturday.

Fortunately for Michigan, its 

run defense is plenty equipped 
to handle Whitely and any other 
back the Rebels roll out. Redshirt 
junior Chris Wormley has been a 
monster on the defensive line, and 
there’s no reason to believe that 
will change against UNLV.

The Rebels lean toward a 

more power-running style, but, 
oddly, they do so primarily out 
of the shotgun. That means the 
ball carrier is starting behind 
the line of scrimmage, and with 
an offensive line that’s far from 
intimidating, that means trouble 
for UNLV.

Edge: Michigan

Special teams

Freshman receiver Brian Cole 

came close to blocking numerous 
punts last week against Oregon 
State, something that will be 
fun to watch as the season goes 
on. Redshirt freshman Jabrill 
Peppers is always a threat to 
take one to the house, and he has 
proven to be sure-handed fielding 
punts as well.

Fifth-year senior punter Blake 

O’Neill has been as good as 
advertised — if not better — and 
senior Kenny Allen has displayed 
a pair of quality placekicking 
performances.

For the Rebels, Nolan Kohorst 

is an asset at placekicker. He’s 
4-for-4 on the year with an 
impressive long of 51, but even 
that depends on the Rebels’ 
ability to get him to the 34-yard 
line. Logan Yunker averages 42.8 
yards per punt — the exact same 
as O’Neill — and will be the first 
non-Australian punter Michigan 
has faced this year.

Neither 
team 
has 
been 

especially good in the return 
game, but Peppers is the most 
dangerous returner by far.

Edge: Push

Intangibles

UNLV will be fired up to earn 

its first win of the season, but 
must attempt to do so in front 
of more than 100,000 fans. 
Michigan will be riding a wave of 

momentum from its drubbing of 
Oregon State.

Both teams have new coaches, 

but the Rebels’ Tony Sanchez 
was a high school coach from 
1998 before this season, while 
Harbaugh is straight out of the 
NFL.

Look for Harbaugh to keep his 

team grounded, not for Sanchez 
to seize the moment.

Edge: Michigan

What to watch for on Saturday

Wolverines seek 
fast start, backup 
running backs vie 
for playing time

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

The Michigan football team 

may play its easiest game of the 
season Saturday, barring further 
collapse by a Big Ten team such as 
Rutgers or Maryland.

This week, the UNLV Rebels 

(0-2) visit Michigan Stadium 
to give the Wolverines a non-
conference 
tune-up. 
Brigham 

Young comes to town next week 
before the conference season 
starts, so Michigan would be wise 
to tighten up each of its units now.

Here’s what to watch for in 

Saturday’s game.

1. How does Michigan start?

The Wolverines have started 

the game on defense in both 
games this season and have 
surrendered long drives both 
times — a long field goal at Utah 
and an easy touchdown drive 
against Oregon State. Michigan 
has settled in both times but 
could use a better start this week.

UNLV, 
meanwhile, 
was 

overmatched against UCLA last 
week but did take a 17-3 lead early 
against Northern Illinois in the 
season opener. The Rebels’ slim 
chances of an upset would stay 
alive a little longer if they can get 
off to a strong start.

But the first quarter seems to 

point Michigan’s way. Sam Boyd 
Stadium in Las Vegas seats 36,800, 
about one third of the capacity of 
the Big House, so that could be 
an adjustment for the Rebels. 
UNLV also hasn’t played in the 
Eastern time zone since 2010, and 
Saturday’s game kicks off at noon 
Eastern — 9 a.m. in Las Vegas. 
The Wolverines could let their 
fans relax a bit if they can take 
advantage of the time difference.

2. Will a backup quarterback (or 
quarterbacks) see substantial 
playing time?

Junior 
quarterback 
Shane 

Morris 
lost 
the 
starting 

competition to fifth-year senior 
Jake 
Rudock, 
but 
common 

wisdom — as well as the depth 
chart — implies he is still the No. 
2 quarterback. Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh confirmed that 
fact after the Oregon State win 
Saturday, even though redshirt 
freshman Wilton Speight, not 
Morris, came in to take a knee at 
the end of the game. Harbaugh 
said Morris, a junior who has seen 
game action, had come too far to 
be the quarterback who cleans up 
at the end of the game.

Morris could redshirt this 

season 
if 
Rudock 
remains 

the starter all season, so the 
Wolverines will use him only if 
they need him in a close game. 
Speight played just a few snaps 
against the Beavers, but if this 
week’s game turns into a blowout 
sooner, he could get a little extra 
playing time. We could even see a 
third quarterback, depending on 
the score.

3. What will Michigan’s defense 
throw at UNLV?

The Wolverines admitted they 

were partially caught off-guard 
by Utah’s up-tempo offense in 
the first game. But they returned 
to form by dominating Oregon 
State last week, allowing just 59 
total yards after the first drive 
of the game. The Beavers also 
took one sack from Michigan’s 
Chris Wormley and completed 
just one pass in the second 
half. They eventually switched 
quarterbacks in search of a spark, 
but to no avail.

So what do Wormley and Co. 

have in store for the Rebels? Blake 
Decker started UNLV’s first two 
games at quarterback, but he is 
questionable for Saturday with 
a groin injury. If he can’t go, 
sophomore Kurt Palandech will 
get the nod in a loud environment. 

The Wolverines and defensive 
coordinator D.J. Durkin could 
dial up the pressure early on to 
try to get to the quarterback.

Michigan has also made it a 

goal to force more turnovers. Its 
only takeaway at Utah was an 
interception on a Hail Mary at the 
end of the half, and it forced one 
more last week. The players and 
coaches insist their performances 
have been better in practice and 
that it’s just a matter of time 
before it shows up in games. This 
week would be a good week to 
start.

4. Does anyone besides De’Veon 
Smith have a chance at running 
back?

Smith, junior Ty Isaac, junior 

Derrick 
Green 
and 
redshirt 

junior Drake Johnson were all 
competing for the starting job in 

fall camp. Though the coaches 
were open to playing more than 
one initially, they said before 
the season they were looking to 
establish one as the workhorse. 
It appears after two games that 
Smith has become that guy.

In two games, Smith has 40 

carries, compared to 10 each for 
Isaac and Green and one for Drake 
Johnson, who is still regaining 
full speed after a torn ACL last 
November. More notably, Smith 
has had success in those carries, 
breaking out for 126 yards and 
three touchdowns last week.

After that performance, the 

window for the other backs may 
be closing. If Saturday’s game 
is lopsided and one of the other 
three gets an opportunity, it 
might be one of their last chances 
to seize playing time before 
the De’Veon Smith Show keeps 
rolling into the Big Ten season.

Junior running back Derrick Green had eight carries for 35 yards and a touchdown against Oregon State, and he could have another chance to prove himself against UNLV.

Show me the money? Not what 
Harbaugh’s about, ex-agent says

Leigh Steinberg 

discusses experience 

with coach, stays 

optimistic for future

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

When Jim Harbaugh spurned 

lucrative NFL offers to return to 
college and coach the Michigan 
football team this offseason, the 
overwhelming reaction nationally 
was one of surprise — surprise 
that Harbaugh would leave the 
sport’s highest level, and surprise 
that he would forsake the financial 
benefits that come with that 
challenge.

Harbaugh’s first agent during 

his NFL playing career, Leigh 
Steinberg, had no such reaction. 
He has seen Harbaugh’s love for 
Michigan, ever since the first 
time he met Harbaugh in Ann 
Arbor 
soon 
after 
Harbaugh’s 

college 
career 
at 
Michigan 

ended. Harbaugh was ill that day, 
answering the door wrapped in 
blankets, but the two still met and 
forged a player-agent relationship 
that lasted much of Harbaugh’s 
playing career.

Steinberg, 
once 
an 
NFL 

superagent, is widely considered 
the inspiration for the movie 
Jerry Maguire, in which the 
agent’s primary client frequently 
yelled at the agent, “Show me the 
money.” Harbaugh, Steinberg said 
Thursday, was never that kind of 
client.

“He might be, of the 300 to 

400 athletes I’ve worked with, 
the least concerned with what the 
economics were of his contract,” 
Steinberg 
said 
in 
a 
phone 

interview.

In Steinberg’s experience, most 

players use contract negotiations 
to prove their value compared 
to other players. Once, when 
Steinberg negotiated an expensive 
deal for Buffalo Bills running 
back Thurman Thomas, Dallas 
Cowboys running back Emmitt 
Smith insisted that his next deal 
be worth one dollar more than 
Thomas’.

Harbaugh had no such request 

during his contract negotiations.

“Even though all of the figures 

were explained to him and he had 
all of the information, his only 
question was, ‘Do you think it’s 
fair?’ ” Steinberg said.

If 
Steinberg 

answered 
in 

the affirmative, 
Harbaugh 
would agree to 
the deal.

Steinberg 

visited 
Ann 

Arbor 
this 

week to speak 
in front of the 
University 
of 

Michigan Sports 
Law Society. Steinberg’s book, 
The Agent, My 40-Year Career 
Making Deals and Changing the 
Game, was recently released in 
paperback. Steinberg will also 
lead the Leigh Steinberg Agent 
Academy on Sept. 26 for aspiring 
agents.

Steinberg has struggled at times 

in recent years, battling alcoholism 
and financial difficulties. His life 
has experienced drastic changes 
since the peak of his career. 
Steinberg is no longer the premier 
agent he once was.

But 
in 

Harbaugh, 
Steinberg 
sees 

a rock, a coach 
who acts very 
similarly 
to 

the 
way 
he 

did during his 
playing 
days. 

Steinberg 
stopped 
in 
to 

visit Harbaugh 
during his trip 

to Ann Arbor, and it was just like 
old times.

They 
joked 
about 
their 

memories — especially the time 
during Harbaugh’s rookie year 
when they fired squirt guns 
at a Bears executive to ease 
the 
tension 
during 
contract 

negotiations — and talked about 

the present. In Steinberg’s eyes, 
Harbaugh is as happy as he has 
ever been. He’s at the school he 
loves with a family he loves and a 
coaching staff that will work hard 
with him.

None of Harbaugh’s coaching 

success surprises Steinberg. He 
claims that he could see a coaching 
career in Harbaugh’s future even 
in the early days of his playing 
career. He points to the way 
Harbaugh dealt with adversity, 
particularly in how he earned the 
nickname “Captain Comeback” 
when 
he 
quarterbacked 
the 

Indianapolis Colts.

“He had a unique ability to tune 

out all the discord and notes that 
might come with adversity and to 
elevate his level of play in critical 
situations,” Steinberg said.

Like everyone else, he sees 

the 
quirkiness 
in 
Harbaugh. 

He remembers a Super Bowl 
party in the San Diego Zoo 
when 
Harbaugh 
disappeared 

for a couple of hours, only to be 

found “ensconced back in a cage 
somewhere, having a good time.”

That 
quirkiness, 
Steinberg 

believes 
— 
combined 
with 

Harbaugh’s sense of humor — 
helps him stay composed and 
keep perspective in stressful 
times.

“He’d like to see the irony 

in things,” Steinberg said. “So 
whenever things are going wrong, 
it’s like, ‘What’s next? Locusts? A 
river of blood? Darkness?’ He had 
a great perspective about things. 
It was not that he was oblivious to 
adversity, it’s just that he accepted 
it and could joke about it.”

Steinberg has no doubt that 

Harbaugh will turn Michigan 
into a power in the next few years. 
He has seen the coach’s values 
remain strong and unbending, 
his mettle tested time and time 
again.

More 
than 
anything 
else, 

Steinberg knows that Harbaugh 
is not involved in the game of 
football just to see the money.

RUBY WALLAU/Daily

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh has never been concerned with financial comparisons between contract offers, as a player or as a coach.

“He might be ... the 

least concerned 

with what the 

economics were.”
