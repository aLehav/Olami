In its second

passed in June.
City Attorney Stephen
Postema said at the meeting
that the board is still discussing
the legality of the dispensaries'
actions. The city doesn't want to

would like a thorough discussion

Federal repayment
system to lower
forgiveness from
25 to 20 years
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily Staff Reporter
Student loan holders still
salving the wounds of tuition
increases and dwindling
financial aid nationwide may
soon find fewer reasons to fret
about financing their educa-
tion.
To ease student loan bur-
dens, President Barack Obama
announced yesterday a broad-
ening of the income-based
loan repayment program.
Graduates who participate
in a new "Pay as You Earn"
option will be able to pay 10
percent of their discretionary
income until the balance of
their student debt is forgiven
after 20 years. Though Con-
gress passed similar measures
last year that were set to take
effect in 2014, the new option

will be available starting next
year.
Under the current income-
based repayment system - in
which 450,000 borrowers
nationwide are enrolled -
graduates pay 15 percent of
their discretionary income
toward their loans, and for-
giveness is only an option after
25 years. The 15-percent cap
has been in place since 2007,
but Obama wrote in an Oct.
25 White House press release
that student borrowers need
"even more immediate relief."
"In a global economy, put-
ting a college education within
reach for every American has
never been more important,"
Obama wrote. "But it's also
never been more expensive."
According to Pamela Fowl-
er, executive director, of the
University's OfficeofFinancial
Aid, 2,037 in-state undergrad-
uate students had an average
federal debt of $20,183 during
2009-2010, with an average
monthly repayment of $236.42
under the standard 10-year
repayment plan. Meanwhile,

MICHIGAN STUDENT ASSEMBLY
Assembly faces low
rep. aftendance at
weekly meetings

Wazoo Records owner strives to keep vinyl alive

Out of 57 MSA
representative seats,
only 38 are filled
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
At the Michigan Student
Assembly's meeting every Tues-
day night, 57 seats are supposed
to be filled by the student gov-
ernment representatives. But at
recent meetings, attendees might
have noticed a large number of
empty seats.
MSA has faced ongoing chal-
lenges this semester to fill seat
vacancies at its weekly meetings,
hindering its ability to effectively
represent the student body, MSA
officials said. The problem is two-
fold - not all of MSA representa-
tive seats are filled, and for those
that are, attendance has recently
been low.
Speaker of the Assembly Mat-
thew Eral said 38 of the avail-
able 57 representative seats on
the assembly are occupied. Three
schools - the School of Natural
Resources and the Environment,
Medical School and School of
Social Work- never elected MSA
representatives this term.

"It boggles my mind," Eral
said. ".. There is no way that in
the University we cannot find ...
people that want to represent stu-
dents and debate issues on their
behalf."
In addition to the complete lack
of representatives in the three
schools, eight colleges - LSA,
College of Engineering, Rack-
ham Graduate School, School of
Information and the College of
Pharmacy - have representa-
tive vacancies. Rackham, which
has a total of 10 possible seats
in the assembly, hasn't sent any
representatives to meetings this
semester since all of the original
write-in representatives resigned.
Eral said the problem of low
attendance at MSA meetings is a
two-way street between represen-
tatives and their constituents. He
said students don't seem to under-
stand the importance of their
representatives attending MSA
meetings.
"The reps don't feel pressure
from the constituents, and the
constituents' don't (receive any
news) from the reps," Eral said.
"There's very little communica-
tion in terms of MSA directly to
the students."

Since 1996, John
Kerr has been
educating A2 on
music classics
By CHELSEA LANDRY
Daily Staff Reporter
A narrow staircase sur-
rounded by decorative murals
shields devoted music loverson
their way into Wazoo Records
from the hustle and bustle of
State Street.
A tiny music shop across the
street from the Diag, Wazoo
Records was founded in 1974
and changed locations sev-
eral times before opening its
doors on State Street in the
early 1980s. The current store
owner, John Kerr, bought
Wazoo Records in 1996 after
working at the store for 18
years.
"This is my dream job," Kerr
said. "I feel that doing this is a
service because I know music
plays a big role in my life, as
I'm sure it does in (the lives of)
others."
An Ann Arbor native, Kerr
explained he left the city to
attend Kalamazoo College
before spending a few years
"figuring out what to do" in
California. He later returned to
Ann Arbor and began working
at Wazoo, which was his favor-
ite record store growing up.

tion of music with no focus on
any specific genre, Kerr said.
He said Wazoo balances musi-
cal classics with a considerable
selection of alternative bands
- a combination that also suits
his personal preferences.
"Most people who are true
music lovers have a variety of
tastes," he said.

Kerr said he believes
Wazoo's distinct combination
of new and old music makes it
unique.
"We started out as just used
vinyl, (but) over the years we
started to branch out," he said.
"It was a slow evolution, but we
got to the point where we had
more and more new music. But

Profess- in g love for writing

What inapired you to start
teaching?
Well, the honest answer is
to earn a living so that I can
spend the rest of my time writ-
ing. But I suppose there are
plenty of things that I could
have done to finance my writ-
ing habits, so I'm happy that
I'm doing something that I
love doing that I think is also
worthwhile ... I'm happy that I
get to work with young people
who are smart and interesting
and many of whom share the
same loves I do - reading and
writing - so that makes me
happy.
What sets you apart from
other professors?

I try to be a human being as
I'm being a professor. I think
more than some people, I'm
willing to reveal my own ques-
tions and frustrations and
the intersection between my
life and my work in ways that
maybe other professors aren't
comfortable with, or their sub-
ject doesn't really allow them
to do.
How would you define
success as a teacher?
I want people to develop
confidence in their own ques-
tions about the world. To think
of the world as an interesting
place, a mysterious place, an
exciting place, a frustrating
place and realize they have

NEWS BRIEFS
SOUTHFIELD, Mich.
Gov. Snyder lays
out plans for better
roads, Internet
Gov. Rick Snyder wants to try
a new way of taxing gasoline and
diesel fuel to raise the money
needed to fix roads and bridges.
He laid out his plan for improv-
ing Internet access, roads, water
and sewer systems and regional
transit during a policy address
yesterday at Lawrence Techno-
logical University.
He suggested several ways that
the state could raise more money
for roads, such as increasing
vehicle registration fees by $10 a
month, which would raise $1 bil-
lion more a year. He wants to let
local governments raise their own
fees to fix local streets.
Snyder says no one wants high-
er taxes, but that more investment
is needed to help the state's eco-
nomic recovery, noting that "bet-
ter roads drive better jobs."
He also supports rapid transit
in southeast Michigan.

Federal prosecutors say
43-year-old Alvin Mingczech
Yee was arrested Tuesday night
at his office in Irvine and is due

Prosecutors say Yee saw up to
a dozen patients nightly at Star-
bucks coffee stores across subur-
ban Orange County at meetings
that cost up to $600. Prosecutors
say Yee barely examined them
but prescribed drugs including
OxyContin and Vicodin.
Prosecutors say a federal
grand jury indicted Yee on 50
counts of illegal distribution of
a contriolled substance and six
counts of illegal distribution to a
minor, which under federal law
is under age 21.

new sanctions to raise the pres-
sure on Iran's government over
its disputed nuclear program and
alleged ties to terrorism.
Secretary of State Hillary Rod-
ham Clinton said in interviews
yesterday with Persian-language
media that the U.S. wanted to

affirm its friendship to the Ira-
nian people even at a time of ris-
ing tensions with the regime in
Tehran. As part of that effort, she
said a "virtual embassy in Teh-

Death highlights women's
role in1 Special Ops team--s

Women soldiers
crucial asset in
Afghanistan
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Army 1st Lt. Ashley White died
on the front lines in southern
Afghanistan last weekend, the
first casualty in what the Army
says is a new and vital wartime
attempt to gain the trust of
Afghan women.
White, like other female
soldiers working with special
operations teams, was brought
in to do things that would be
awkward or impossible for
her male teammates. Frisking
burqa-clad women, for exam-
ple.
Her death, in a bomb explo-
sion in the Taliban heartland of
Kandahar, underscores the risks
of placing women with elite U.S.
special operations teams work-
ing in remote villages.
Military leaders and other
female soldiers in the program
say its rewards are great, even
as it fuels debate over the roles
of women in combat.
"We could do things that the
males cannot do, and they are
starting to realize that," says
Sgt. Christine Baldwin, who
like White was among the first
groups of women deployed to
Afghanistan this year as spe-
cially trained "cultural sup-
port" troops.
Male soldiers often cannot
even speak to an Afghan woman
because of the strict cultural
norms that separate the sexes
and the tradition of women
remaining behind closed doors
most of the time. Forcing the
issue has yielded only resent-
ment, military officials say, and
has jeopardized the trust and
cooperation of villagers. From
the start of the war 10 years ago,
Afghans have especially resent-
ed the practice of "night raids"
in which male foreign soldiers
enter and search homes, the

traditional sanctum of women.
"We could search the female,
find out the other half of the
information," Baldwin said in
an interview. "If you're missing
half of the lay of the land, how
effective are you in engaging
the populace?"
Thatcquestion was eight years
in the making. It arose from the
frustration of U.S. command-
ers who realized two years ago
that as they tried to apply the
principles of counterinsur-
gency - protect civilians and
enlist them to reject insurgents
and provide intelligence - they
weren't reaching the majority
of the Afghan population.
Now, the first female sol-
diers are serving in commando
units. They are trained to fer-
ret out critical information not
available to their male team
members, to identify insurgents
disguised as women and figure
out when Afghan women are
being used to hide weapons.
U.S. women have been on
the front lines in Afghanistan
since the war began, and over
time they have been used to
reach out to the Afghan popula-
tion through health care initia-
tives and other programs. They
have traveled with Army sol-
diers and Marines throughout
the warfront, often to assist in
development projects or as part
of psychological operations -
what are now called MIS, or
military information support
operations.
But as elite special opera-
tions teams fanned out across
the country doing counter-
insurgency "stability opera-
tions" in the small villages, they
complained to their superiors
that they weren't reaching the
women and children who make
up as much as71percent of the
population.
'We waited too long to get
to this," says Command Sgt.
Maj. Ledford Stigall. "We had
a lot of people focused on the
kill and capture, and it really

took someone to say, hey it's not
about kill, capture, it's about
developing a country that can
take care of itself."
"Women have a voice," he
said. "They can influence the
men in their society."
In 2009, under pressure
from Gen. Stanley McChrystal,
then the top U.S. commander
in Afghanistan, and Gen. David
Petraeus, then the top U.S. com-
mander in the Middle East, the
Army began to develop Cultural
Support Teams.
Last November, the first
group of women went through
a grueling five-day assessment
that tested their physical and
military skills, their problem-
solving and writing abilities and
their psychological and men-
tal fitness. Those that passed
moved on to a six-week training
program.
And in January, the first
group of 28 women deployed to
Afghanistan with Army Rang-
ers and Special Forces teams.
They went in two-woman
teams as part of larger spe-
cial operations units - usually
numbering about a dozen. And
they were designed to go out
on patrols and into the villages
with the special operators to
help build relations with the
communities by engaging with
the Afghan women.
In the process, they could
also glean valuable intelligence
about the people in the region,
information they might not be
able to get from the men.
Capt. Adrienne Bryant was in
the first group that deployed.
Down in Helmand Province
with a team of Marine special
operations forces, Bryant said,
the initial response from the
population was tepid.

Protest leaders
refuse to talk with
Syrian government
BEIRUT (AP) - Arab officials
held a "frank and friendly" meet-
ing with Syrian President Bashar
Assad yesterday, the head of the
delegation said at the beginning
of a regional effort to resolve a
bloody 7-month revolt, the most
serious challenge yet to the four
decade Assad dynasty.
The Arab committee is trying
to start talks between Assad's gov-
ernment and its opponents, but
protest leaders reject any dialogue
with the regime while it contin-
ues its brutal crackdown, which
the U.N. says has killed more than
3,000 people since March.
Activists said at least 15 civil-
ians were killed yesterday in
military operations across the
country, 12 of them in the flash-
point central city of Homs.
The meeting in Damascus
between the Arab ministerial
committee and Assad came hours
after tens of thousands of Syrians
packed a main square in the Syr-
ian capital, chanting, "the people
want Bashar Assad." Assad suc-
ceeded his father, andtogethercthe
family has ruled Syria for more
than 40 years.
Qatari Prime Minister Sheik
Hamad Bin Jassem Bin Jabr Al
Thani was quoted as saying that
the Arab delegation felt that the
Syrian government is eager to
work with the Arab committee "in
order to reach a solution."
Sheik Hamad told reporters
that the Arab committee and
the Syrian government will hold
another meeting on Sunday either
in Syria or in Qatar.
"What is important for us is
that there are no victims from any
side in Syria," Sheik Hamad told
reporters. "The fighting should
stop and the dialogue should
begin between the Syrian broth-
ers so that, God willing, they
agree on points that fulfill people
demands."
Syria has rejected previous
Arab initiatives, and it was not
clear if this would be different, or
if the regime was trying to gain
time to tryto crush the uprising.
The Arab officials' visit follows
a meeting in Cairo last week by
the 22-nation Arab League, which
gave Syria until the end of the
month to end military operations,
release detainees arrested in the
crackdown, and start a dialogue
with the opposition.
Human Rights Watch quoted
Syrian activists as saying at least
186 protesters and residents have
been killed in Syria sincethe Cairo
meeting.
The activists said towns and
villages in southern and central

Syria as well as some areas in
the north and east, closed their
businesses in compliance with an
opposition call for a general strike.
Amateur videos showed shops
closed in different parts of the
country as well as counter-dem-
onstrations to the one held in
Damascus. One of the largestctook
place in the village of Halfaya in
the central province of Hama.
A giant banner raised on an
electricity pole there read: "To the
Arab League. How do you want us
to have a dialogue with the killer of
children and women when all laws
say that the killer should not be
negotiated with, but putcon trial?"
The Syrian government has
staunchly defended its crackdown
on protesters, saying it is the tar-
get of a foreign conspiracy.
Bassma Kodmani, spokeswom-
an for the broad-based opposition
group, the Syrian National Coun-
cil, said it is "impossible" to talk
about a dialogue within the cur-
rent security crackdown.
"And even if the right conditions
for'dialogue prevail, the only thing
to discuss would be a roadmap for
the peaceful transfer of power?'
she told The Associated Press.
"Russia gives Bashar inter-
national protection, Iran gives
him weapons, and Arabs give
him time," read a banner carried
by protesters in northern Syria
Tuesday evening. "No dialogue
with the killer of children," read
another.
Human Rights Watch called
on the Arab ministers to demand
that the government allow inde-
pendent, civilian monitors into
Syria to observe the behavior of
security forces.
In a pro-government rally timed
to coincide with the Arab minis-
ters'visit, tens of thousands of Syr-
ians carrying white, red and black
flags and posters of Assad gathered
at Damascus' Omayyad square.
The opposition says authorities
regularly stage suchrallies in sup-
tort of the embattled leader.
Assad still has significant sup-
port among Syrians, including
those who benefited financially
from the regime, minority groups
who fear they will be targeted
if the Sunni majority takes over,
and others who see no clear and
safe alternative to the president.
He also still has the loyalty of the
bulk of the armed forces, key to
his remaining in power.
The British-based Syrian
Observatory for Human Rights
and other rights groups said 15
civilians were killed Wednes-
day in shootings by security
forces nationwide, including 12
in the rebellious city of Homs.
The Observatory also reported
11 soldiers were killed in Hama
province when the bus they were
traveling in was hit by a rocket
propelled grenade.

Redefine rape
FBI must protect all people under the law
lutWalk events have been occurring around the country and
often grab attention by name alone. Last Saturday, in a show of
support for the recent FBI panel vote to change the definition of
rape; SlutWalk came to Ann Arbor. These events highlight important
issues of sexual health and safety and point to the importance of rede-
fining how rape is perceived in America. The Criminal Justice Infor-
mation Services Division's Advisory Policy Board of the FBI should
vote to pass the proposed new definition, which includes males and

Questioning the congressman

think that beinga good host is
an important obligation.
And I want to like Eric Can-
tor. I really do.
The House
Majority Leader
(R-Va.) looks
like a nice guy
in his offi-
cial photo. We
even have some
things in com-
mon - glasses
and family who JOEL
came from East- BATTERMAN
ern Europe early
last century.
But Cantor is coming to speak at
the Michigan League next Monday,
and I have to confess I'm anxious to
ask him some questions.
Why, Cantor, did you vote against
regulating the subprime mortgage
industry after it helped plunge our
economy into some pretty major
trouble? Things like adjustable-
rate mortgages just seem a little
shady. I understand your family
has been in the real estate business
for a while and that you have a
big stake in a mortgage brokerage
firm. Then there's the $2 million
that banks have put into your cam-
paigns (nothing out of the ordinary
these days, I'll admit). But really, is
it worth bringing down the whole
housing market again?
Let me share a little more
about my family. My dad's father
designed radar systems for guid-
ed missile destroyers. My mom's
father worked in a coal mine. Both
were union members. During their
careers, the U.S. was more pros-
perous than at any time in our his-
tory. Since then, corporate attacks
on unions have cut their ranks in
half, and the country hasn't been

faring well either. Cantor, you've
got a zero percent rating from the
American Federation of Labor and
Congress of Industrial Organiza-
tions - meaning that you're basi-
cally opposed to anything that
helps working families. Shouldn't
we be a little scared by that?
And did you really mean it when
you said folks to your leftwere push-
ing "efforts to incite class warfare?"
The private jet business has soared
to record-breaking heights. Coach
reports that sales of $400 handbags
are taking off. Meanwhile, people
on the ground are getting laid off,
their houses are getting foreclosed
and they're being thrown off pub-
lic assistance. Sounds like "shock-
and-awe" to me, and it's not coming
from occupy Wall Street.
That reminds me: You described
those protesters as "growing mobs"
who are "pitting Americans against
Americans." Well, golly! What do
you call voting against minimum
wage increases while slashingtaxes
on the rich?
Speaking of "pitting Americans
against Americans," can we talk
about your record on gay rights?
You've voted for allowing job dis-
crimination based on sexual orien-
tation and against enforcing hate
crime laws when gays are singled
out for persecution. Talking about
social harmony when you don't
believe in protections against prej-
udice just seems a little, well, queer.
Then there's the planet, which has
been alittle under the weatherlately.
You called the reaction to last year's
Gulf of Mexico oil spill a "hyperbolic
fuss." Seriously? This wasn't a drop
in the bucket. It was 5 million bar-
rels. It contaminated almost 500
miles of coastline. Eleven people
died. You do realize that hyperbole

means exaggeration, right?
On the other hand, maybe non-
chalance towards disasters is just
how you roll. When a tornado
ripped through Joplin, Mo. in May,
you said you wouldn't support any
relief unless Congress cut other
programs. As you put it so gener-
ously, "(I)f there is support for a
supplemental, it would be accompa-
nied by support for having pay-fors
to that supplemental." Warms the
cockles of the heart, doesn't it?
There are limits
to University
hospitality.
OK. There's a lot more I'd like to
ask. But I'm hoping that other folks
will bring similar questions to your
talk on Monday. Just don't skip
out on us, all right? You decided to
cancel a talk at the University of
Pennsylvania last week when you
learned it was open to the public. In
fact, it had been open to the public
all along, but when the "mobs" got
word about it, and turned out to
protest, you reconsidered. Maybe
you'll deign to address them this
time.
For reference, we're hosting Can-
tor at 1 p.m. Monday at the Michi-
gan League. With all due respect
to his office, we might want to let
him know that our hospitality has
its limits. It may be Halloween, and
these are pretty terrifying times,
but there's a time to face our fears.

transgender individuals.
Participants of SlutWalk walked through
downtown Ann Arbor to raise awareness
about sexual violence. Co-organizers of the
demonstration - LSA junior Megan Pfeiffer
and LSA sophomore Nicole Corrigan - also
hoped the event would encourage people to
focus less on blaming a survivor and more on
rape prevention.
SlutWalk forces communities to reexamine
rape. Women do not get raped because they
are wearing revealing clothing. Regardless of
what clothing a woman is wearing, it is never
avalid argument to say she was "asking for it"
or "had it coming." Rape is a serious criminal
offense and is never the survivor's fault.
Many people, including SlutWalk partici-
pants, are hopeful that the event will garner
support for changing the definition of rape.
Pending the vote, rape will be redefined as
"penetration, no matter how slight, of the
vagina or anus with any body part or object,
or oral penetration by a sex organ of another
person, without the consent of the victim."
This definition adds important specificity that
the current definition - "carnal knowledge of
a female against her will" - is lacking and is
worded in a way that also protects men and
transgender individuals.
All types of people can be victims of rape
and should be protected under the law accord-
ingly. The old definition, which has not been
updated since 1929, is outdated and excludes

large portions of the population. The proposed
change reflects modern society and extends
the definition in a way that holistically covers
all types of rape.
Also included in the proposal's new defini-
tion of rape is information regarding people
who are under the influence of drugs and/or
alcohol. This is especially pertinent to college
campuses where alcohol is often involved in
sexual assaults. If a person is inebriated, he or
she cannot legally give consent and should be
entitled to lawful protection. Inebriation does
not make a person any less of a citizen who
is eligible for protection under the law, and
the redefinition is an important step toward
acknowledgingthat.
The current definition complicates pros-
ecution of rapes by not making specific refer-
ence to acts that count as rape and individuals
who can be victims of rape. The FBI's proposal
to make the description more comprehensive
is an important change to the legal system and
will greatly impact the way these cases are
prosecuted.
SlutWalk in Ann Arbor was a positive
example of public demonstration. It was an
important show of support and solidarity for
the rights of all people to be protected from
sexual violence. The FBI, in a similar show of
support, should approve the new definition of
rape to give all people equal protection under
the law.

Incorporate sustainability
across all majors
TO THE DAILY:
What is sustainability? I can't tell you how
many times I have been asked this question as a
Program in the Environment student. I antici-
pate answering it at the start of each semester
in at least one ofmyPitE classes. Sustainability
is an unavoidabletopic within my major, but
this is not the case across other areas of study.
Many of my friends have not encountered the
term "sustainability" in their classes at the
University, and it is doubtful that they will take
a class with content related to sustainability
before graduation.
Sustainability has become a popular buzz-
word on campus, especially after the comple-
tion of the Campus Sustainability Integrated
Assessment. But do students truly under-
stand the meaning behind the "Sustain-
ability" tab on the University's honyepage?
While PitE is a rapidly growing major and
the University currently offers more than
500 courses that incorporate content related
to sustainability, many students remain envi-
ronmentally illiterate.
Shalit's return shows
Israel's moral compass

Though University President Mary Sue
Coleman recently announced the creation
of a sustainability minor, I was hoping to
hear something along the lines of establish-
ing an undergraduate environmental literacy
requirement in the near future. The sustain-
ability minor is a step in the right direction, but
there must be a push for a University require-
ment if we want to become an institution
known for fostering leaders in sustainability.
It is vital for students to graduate with
at least some preliminary understanding of
sustainability, which is a concept embedded
within environmental education. Fulfilling an
environmental literacy requirement should be
just as important as completing distribution
requirements. Sustainability is a very inter-
disciplinary subject that is likely to arise in
most career fields. Thus, studentswill be more
prepared for the real world with this require-
ment. Once equipped with a concrete com-
prehension of sustainability, graduates will
be able to sort through the "greenwashing"
common in today's society and become more
informed citizens.
Beatrice Holdstein

How often do you stop and
consciously think about
what you're doing?
This may be
coming a bit
late - consider-
ing the stress of
midterms has
passed - but
there is increas-
ing evidence of
health benefits
of mindfulness. NORA
Mindfulness is STEPHENS
the act of being
completely "in
the moment" and being so in the
moment that you don't realize you're
"in"anything.Byconcentratingsole-
ly on one's actions, whether reading
"War andPeace"or eatingbreakfast,
one can become more present. A
recent University of California Los
Angeles study found that mindful-
ness reduces stress by encouraging
concentration exclusively on what
you are doing. Instead of contem-
plating future plans or dwelling on
the past, you can be more effective
in the present.
Try it. Take a moment to feel
yourself sitting, feel your feet on
the ground and concentrate on your
breathing. Don't let your mind wan-
der to thoughts of work, classes or
stress. By concentrating exclusively
on just "being," even for a moment,
we return from this moment more
refreshed.
You may be asking yourself:
"Why is this crazy woman asking
me to breath deeply and concentrate
on nothing?" It helped me and has
the potential to help you. The aver-
age University student is wrapped
up in exams, jobs, projects, paying
rent, issues with friends, organiza-
tions - we forget to give ourselves a
break. To be unaware of details and
only aware of purely being is a way

to literally take a breather.
After you have relaxed, try to
be mindful of yourself. Think
about your social identities, which
include your race, gender, ability
status, religion, socioeconomic sta-
tus and sexual orientation.
Now take a second to go deeper,
and think about how your social
identities shape the course of your
everyday life. Do you spend most
of your time with people who have
similar identities as you? Do tend
to question people who are differ-
ent from you? Do you tend to notice
people who are different from you?
It's important to think about
these identities because they shape
the way we see the world. A Har-
vard study found those in minority
groups often have greater aware-
ness of their social identities than
those in the majority. This may be
obvious, but why is it that those
who do not have the same identity
as the majority group have more
intense awareness? And what sort
of privilege does this grant the peo-
ple of the majority group?
It may be uncomfortable for you,
but talk to someone of a minority
social identity, and you may be sur-
prised. The advantage of not having
to be aware of one's identities is a
privilege.
I am a white upper middle-class
heterosexual person who spends
the majority of her time with
other white upper middle-class
heterosexual people. Do I think
this shapes my day-to-day life?
Absolutely. In fact, the only way
I have friends that are not upper
middle-class white people is by my
involvement with the Program on
Intergroup Relations.
This organization creates a space
for people to talk about the self-
segregation that permeates our
campus and build meaningful rela-

tionships beyond this self-segrega-
tion. If I had not become involved
with this group my freshman year,
I would not have nearly as much
awareness about my social identi-
ties, nor would I have many friends
who are different from me.
Be aware of all
your actions and
their effects.
My privilege of being a member
of the majority race on this cam-
pus may present itself this Hal-
loween weekend. A recent Ohio
University poster campaign illus-
trated that when people dress up
as a "Mexican" they are attacking
a culture, not wearing a costume.
Many costumes, whether it is a ter-
rorist, gangster or geisha, attack a
specific culture and make assump-
tions about people within respec-
tive cultures. By wearing a costume
that represents a race that is not
your own, you are participating in
a form of black face. As a white per-
son I will be aware of my race when
choosing my costume and when
talking with friends about theirs.
If our campus community as
a whole became mindful of their
social identities and the privilege or
oppression within them, more con-
versations about injustices in our
community and our world might
begin. The combination of mindful-
ness for our health and mindfulness
of our social identities could lead to
a happier and healthier University.

LOANS
From Page 1A
705 out-of-state students had an
average federal debt of $22,399
during the same time period for
an average monthly repayment
of $257.78.
Fowler wrote in an e-mail
interview that the University
does not currently have any stu-
dents up for loan forgiveness,
so she could not determine how
many University students take
advantage of the income-based
repayment option. However,
many students do not consider
it "until they are near or at the
point of default," Fowler wrote.
Income-based repayment
helps graduates "keep monthly
payments low during years when
their gross pay is low and other
expenses high," Fowler wrote.
She added that it prevents many
graduates from defaulting on
their student loans and protects
their credit history.
Fowler wrote in an e-mail
interview that she thinks the
20-year forgiveness period is
much better than the original 25
years. She added that she hopes
the initiatives will draw atten-
tion to the underutilized income-
based repayment program.
"After 20 years, many stu-
dents will be faced with send-
ing their children to college,"
Fowler wrote. "Having both of
those financial priorities at the
same time is probably not a good
thing."
In a conference call with
reporters on Tuesday, U.S. Sec-
retary of Education Arne Dun-
can and Melody Barnes, director
of the Domestic Policy Council,
reiterated Obama's call of urgen-
cy as students are on the cusp of
entering an increasingly global
and competitive economy once
they graduate.
"Because we know the frus-
tration of crushing loan bur-
dens, we believed that we had
to act today," Barnes said. "This
president knows that getting
a postsecondary education is

important for economic security
and to make sure students are
ready and available for the jobs
of tomorrow."
Barnes added that reducing
the cap could lower monthly
payments by hundreds of dol-
lars a month, easing the debt of
graduates who enter the market
in low-paying fields.
Barnes and Duncan also
stressed that the cost of higher
education is a deterrent for many
young people, and they hope
Obama's efforts will change that.
"College continues to be a
great, great investment," Duncan
said during the call. "We have
to educate our way to a better
economy and have to continue to
make sure that college is acces-
sible and affordable, particularly
for young people that don't have
a lot of economic support."
As tuition rates rise nation-
wide - including at the Univer-
sity, which raised tuition by 6.7
percent for in-state students and
4.9 percent for out-of-state stu-
dents this year - the importance
of loan repayment measures like
Obama's recent initiative has
also risen, said Mark Kantrow-
itz, founder and publisher of
FinAid.org.
Kantrowitz said the
announcement was "good news"
amid a spate of cuts to financial
aid legislation like the elimi-
nation of the in-school inter-
est subsidy on federal loans in
August. However, the cap is only
a small measure, and borrowers
who have already taken out stu-
dent loans will continue to bear
the full burden of their debts, he
said.
Barnes acknowledged in the
conference call that the option
was not significant in scale and
would not provide the boost to
the economy Obama was hoping
for, though it would help some-
what.
"The steps we're taking today
are not a substitute for the bold
action we need to create jobs and
grow the economy," she said.
"But they will make a differ-
ence."

Huron Valley
shelter has
200 animals up
for adoption
By CHELSEA LANDRY
DailyStaffReporter
Forty homeless furry felines
slept in the hallways of the
Humane Society of Huron Val-
ley this weekend after their
owners were evicted for hoard-
ing.
The cats arrived on Oct. 18
and 19 as a result of two animal
hoarding incidents, accordingto
Deb Kern, marketing director of
the Humane Society of Huron
Valley. Police evicted the hoard-
ers, and the cats were immedi-
ately taken to the already packed
facility to await adoption.
"There's no room left, and
our foster homes are full," Kern

said. "Cats (are) in the hallway
and in other places we wouldn't
normally have them."
With the addition of the cats,
the shelter currently has about
200 pets waiting to be adopted.
Despite the unexpected influx
of pets, Kern made it clear that
HSHV will not euthanize any
of the animals. However, she
stressed the importance of fami-
lies adopting pets from shelters.
"If you're going to adopt, go
to shelters first," Kern said. "Do
the responsible thing."
In an effort to provide good
homes for the animals, the
HSHV is offering adoption spe-
cials. From now until further
notice, HSHV is offering free
adoptions for cats seven months
or older on Fridays, Saturdays
and Sundays. It is also offering
free kitten adoptions with the
full-price adoption of another
kitten and will take $25 off the
adoption fee for any dog.
Kern said the specials seem

to be successful so far - 48
cats and 20 dogs found new
homes last weekend. While the
increased adoption rates are
encouraging, HSHV "could still
use help," she said.
To encourage donations for
the numerous animals in the
shelter, HSHV has a "Wish
List" posted on its website
Some needed items include
cat food, large rawhide bones,
paper plates and used blankets
or towels.
Kern said she hopes the
HSHV's recent efforts to
encourage adoption will open
more space at the HSHV facil-
ity, and the animals will find
safe homes.
Though it's often difficult for
students to adopt animals due
to housing restrictions, Kern
said there are other ways to
help resolve the crisis through
volunteer efforts. The shelter
frequently has volunteers from
the University of Michigan and

Eastern Michigan University,
and many students also hold
fundraisers, walks and food
drives for the organization.
LSA senior Jessica Gonzales
visitedtheshelterwithherroom-
mate last week totake advantage
of the adoption specials. They
brought home two kittens.
"The people at the Humane
Society are super nice and help-
ful ... they kindly answered all
the questions we had," Gonza-
les wrote in an e-mail interview.
"When we went through the
adoption process, they gave us
all the details necessary for tak-
ing the cats home, introducing
them to their new environment
and even (gave us) a few bags of
cat food to start off with."
She added that the adop-
tion of both kittens cost $100
because of the Humane Soci-
ety's adoption specials.
"I definitely think this is a
reasonable price," Gonzales
wrote.

Kopmeyer sets saves record in third season

By STEVEN BRAID
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan women's soccer
team is on pace to give up its most
shots on goal for a season since
2005.
Fortunately for the Wolverines,
redshirt junior goalkeeper Haley
Kopmeyer has made sure most of
those shots have
not found the NOTEBOOK
back of her net.
Against Ohio State last Friday,
Kopmeyer set the single-season
record for most saves by a goalie
when she recorded her 100th save
of the season - becoming the first
goalie with triple-digit saves in
the program's history.
"It's a great accomplishment
and it's nice to have your name
in the record books, but I look
at it like this - if I didn't make
those saves, those shots would be
goals," Kopmeyer said. "It's my
job to make those saves. If I didn't
hold the record for most saves
then I would have the record for
mostgoals allowed."
With 105 saves this season,
Kopmeyer broke her previous
record of 95 saves set two years
ago. The record not only displays
her superb ability to protect the
net, but it also demonstrates her
durability. She's played in all 1,660
minutes of Michigan's season.
With her fantastic play this
season, Kopmeyer has cemented
herself as one of the Big Ten's best
goalies. She ranks first in the con-
ference in saves per game (5.83),

four games at the Michigan Soc-
cer Stadium, reeling off consecu-
tive wins and starting the season
with an impressive 4-1-0 mark at
home.
But the Wolverines' success at
home swiftly turned into misery.
They lost their final three games
in Ann Arbor, concluding their
2011 home schedule with a disap-
pointing record of 4-5-1- winless
at home since a Sept. 9 victory
over Western Michigan.
Michigan's frustrating home
record can be pinned on its inabil-

ity to find the back of the net. The
Wolverines haven't scored a goal
at home in more than a month -
a span of four games, dating back
to their 3-2 loss to Minnesota on
Sept.23.
The Wolverines were 6-1-2 at
home last year and 4-2-4 the year
before.
JOCKEYING FOR POSITION:
Currently sitting seventh in the
Big Ten with a 4-5-1 conference
record, Michigan will lock down
a bid to the Big Ten Tournament
with a victory over Illinois in its

regular season finale.
Just the top eight teams in the
conference make the tournament.
Unfortunately forthe Wolverines,
12th-place Northwestern gets an
automatic bid due to hosting, so
Michigan will have to finish with-
in the top seven teams.
Alongwith the Wolverines, five
other teams - Iowa, Minnesota,
Ohio State, Nebraska, and Purdue
- will be competing for the last
three spots into the tournament.
The six teams are all within two
points of each other.

While Purdue (6-3, 18-3) is the
tougher of this weekend's oppo-

Indiana is not being ignored. The
Hoosiers (0-10, 8-15) have not
won a match since Sept. 16, but
Rosen does not want his team to
overlook them.
"Indiana is a different team
since the first time we have olaved

them," Rosen said. "They have
changed their lineup a lot. They
are playing a little better than

Both Rosen and Donhoff
stressed the importance of not
taking any Big Ten opponent too
lightly.
"Any team in the Big Ten you
have got to prepare for the same
way," Donhoff said. "You have
got to come into practice, play
hard, expect that each game in
the weekend is goingto be a tough
game."
The second round of the Big
Ten is the opportunity the Wol-
verines have been waiting for to
return as the unstoppable team
they were a month ago.

'M' confident for
Purdue matchup

TERRA MOLLENGRAFF/Daily
Fifth-year senior Will Heininger started his road to becoming a starter on Michigan's defensive line as a walk-on freshman, practicing against Jake Long.
Scout-team lessons paying off
for fifth-year senior Heininger

By KEVIN RAFTERY
DailySportsEditor
Throughout the first half of
this season, there were many
changes for the No. 17 Michigan
football team.
A new
coaching staff. NOTEBOOK
New uniforms.
New players. A new attitude.
But even after a 28-14 loss to
No. 9 Michigan State, there's
been one constant in the Wol-
verines' locker room.
"Our confidence has never
waivered," said senior defen-
sive tackle Mike Martin before
practice on Wednesday. "We've
never had any doubt. We don't
want to lose again. That's some-
thing that we won't forget, but
it's something that we need to
move on from."
The team has been bombard-
ed with questions of how this
season will be different than the
past three, all of which included
second-half meltdowns.
The Wolverines have said all
the right things, stressing that
there's a different feel than in
years past, and the seniors won't
let the same thing happen. Now,
after a bye week, the Wolverines
have a chance to prove it on the
field.
On Saturday, Michigan (2-1
Big Ten, 6-1 overall) will have its
first chance to prove it in a game
environment against Purdue
(2-1, 4-3) - a team that seems
to be hitting its stride in the
second half of the season. The
Boilermakers have won two out
of their last three, including an
upset of then-No. 23 Illinois last
week. Martin praised Purdue
but stressed that what the Boil-
ermakers do is out of the Wol-
verines' control.
"They're doing agreat job," he
said. "On our side of it, we just
gotta make sure we prepare the
best that we can. This game is
about Michigan. What it comes
down to is what we do, how we
execute, and how much inten-
sity we play with.
"With our confidence, that's
something we know that we're
going to take care of on the field
this coming Saturday and for
weeks to come."

SIGNS OF CHANGE: Until
this week, posters scattered
throughout Schembechler Hall
served as a constant reminder of
the upcoming opponent.
The week before the Michi-
gan State game, the signs read,
"BEAT MSU." Before Notre
Dame weekend, "Beat the Irish."
It's a tradition Hoke brought
with him since his head coach-
ing days at Ball State and San
Diego State.
But on Wednesday, signs of
Purdue were nowhere to be
found. Instead, the posters said
simply, "Michigan Game Week".
Hoke downplayed the signifi-
cance of the change.
"You've got an opponent to
play, which makes it a very com-
petitive thing," he said. "But at
the end of the day, it's about us.
It's about us and how we prepare
and how we practice."
REDSHIRT RUMBLINGS:
It's every young bench player's
favorite time of year - Redshirt
Season.
On Wednesday, Hoke men-
tioned it's unlikely that any
player who has yet to play this
season will see game action for
the remainder of the year.
"I think with what we've done
so far, we're at our limit," he said.
That means freshman run-
ning back Justice Hayes, a four-
star recruit out of Grand Blanc
High School, will redshirt this
year, barring any serious injuries
in the near future.
Hoke didn't mention any
other names specifically, but he
did talk a little bit about the sta-
tus of fifth-year senior lineback-
er Marell Evans.
Evans, who transferred back
to Michigan this season after a
two-year hiatus, has yet to dress
for a game this year because of
issues with his transfer eligibil-
ity.
With five games remain-
ing this season, his status still
remains unclear and it appears
doubtful he will see the field this
year. But Evans is still making
his presence on the team known.
There's a chance Evans could
return next season as a sixth-
year senior, though "there's a lot
of hoops to go through," accord-
ing to Hoke.

By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Editor
Fifth-year senior Will
Heininger learned a lot of les-
sons his freshman year. It
must've been the teaching ability
of Jake Long.
Heininger and fellow fifth-
year senior Ryan Van Bergen
drew the task of going up against
Long as scout-team defensive
linemen during his senior year.
Long was 315 pounds and on his
way to becoming the No. 1 over-
all pick in the 2008 NFL draft.
Heininger was 223 pounds and a
walk-on, coming to the football
team only after committing to
play for the Michigan baseball
team. Long did a lot of full-con-
tact teaching.
"We still celebrate our, like,
three wins of the season that
we had against him," Heininger
said.
It was on those practice fields
that Heininger truly learned the

key to playing on the defensive
line - staying low.
"If I was lower than him, I had
a chance," Heininger said. "He
would play high, and I would
play low for as strong as he was
and as weak as I was, so it's
always about leverage and your
hands."
Now, Heininger is a starter
on the No. 18 team in the nation.
And, according to Michigan
coach Brady Hoke, Heininger
played his best game two weeks
ago.
After recovering from a knee
injury and not doing much on
the stat sheet at the beginning
of the season, Heininger made
his mark in the Michigan State
game, registering four tackles.
Two of his three tackles for loss
on the season came against the
Spartans. Defensive coordinator
Greg Mattison cited Heininger's
biggest improvement in a main
area. It's the same one Long told
him about four years ago, and his

ability to stay low has translated
to improvement in other areas of
his game.
"I've seen him buy in to what
we're trying to do, and because
of his confidence and the tech-
nique, it's allowed him to use
his strength, and he's become
a lot more physical a football
player," Mattison said. "I think
when you're not sure of yourself,
you're just trying to get through
it, where now he sees it all."
But Hoke wants more. To him,
a single performance doesn't
mean much.
"That has to translate to him
playing better this week and
better next week," Hoke said. "I
think he's playing with a little
more authority, which you like
to see out of a guy who's a senior,
but I was pleased with his per-
formance."
A lot more has changed.
from those days. Most notably,
Heininger has a scholarship
now. He's also up to 295 pounds,

up about 70 from his days on the
scout team.
Heininger has shuffled along
the defensive line in his career.
After seeing playingtime on both
the inside and outside of the line,
he started the season at defensive
end. Van Bergen, Heininger's
old scout-team counterpart, slid
inside to defensive tackle. After
the Notre Dame game, the roles
reversed. With both Heininger
and senior defensive tackle Mike
Martin inside, the Wolverines'
interior defensive line has bloat-
ed to 599 pounds.
"We just felt that Ryan is a
better five-technique (defensive
end) than he is inside," Mattison
said. "He's a lot more comfort-
able there ... Will can kind of play
anywhere, so that made it easy
that way."
When playing either position
both players have are in a bet-
ter state than they were on scout
team. At least they don't have to
face Jake Long anymore.

team is officially cow/sports
in the midst of
the scary part of it's schedule - it
played on the road against a very
physical Northern Michigan team
and plays one of the best defenses
in the country five days later.

No. 4 Michigan (0-1-1 CCHA,
4-1-1 overall) hosts No. 6 Ferris
State (2-0-0, 6-0-0) on Thursday
and Friday in a critical early-sea-
son series that will be decided by
defense. The Bulldogs come into
the contest with the best statistical
defense in the nation, allowing just
.83 goals per game. They're fresh
off a sweep of perennial power No.
16 Miami (Ohio), outscoring the
RedHawks, 6-2, over the weekend.
"Their goalies have been play-
ing unbelievable," said senior
goaltender Shawn Hunwick. "If
we give up two, that might be too
much. They are a hot team and we
struggled a little bit last weekend,
but we are goingto see how we can
do on our home ice."
Against Northern Michigan
last Saturday, the Wolverines were
unable to capitalize on a five-min-
ute major penalty that stretched
into overtime, effectively sealing
their fate in a 3-3 shootout win.
Special teams, haven't been a

weak spot for Michigan, but they
also hasn't been a strength. Michi-
gan is dead even on special teams,
allowing four goals on the penalty
kill and scoring four goals on the
power play.
In comparison, Ferris State has
allowed only one lamplighter on
the penalty kill all season, while
scoring nine power play goals.
"Offensively, you never know,
but we have to make sure we
play well defensively," Berenson
said. "You can control your goals
against a lot more than your goals
scored."
This series wasn't supposed to
be much of a challenge for Michi-
gan. The Bulldogs were ranked
ninth in the preseason CCHA
coaches poll, earning just over half
the points that Michigan did.
But Ferris State looks to be
legitimate. Its offense doesn't
have a go-to scorer and isn't overly
impressive, but the defense and
special teams have looked unbeat-

able this season. If a team is allow-
ing less than one goal a game, you
can afford to not score. A big rea-
son for the Bulldogs' defensive
success has been the play of'the
goaltenders. Freshman C.J. Motte
and senior Taylor Nelson have car-
ried Ferris State so far, turning a
preseason question mark into a
major positive. Motte has allowed
only one goal all season, and Nel-
son has allowed just four.
Michigan coach Red Berenson
said that the key wasn't going to be
the Wolverines' offense - surpris-
ing when you consider the talented
Bulldog defense - but Michigan's
own defense. When goals are pre-
cious, defending the net is crucial.
"We are going to be playing the
underdog role here," junior for-
ward Chris Brown said. "We know
that they have a better record than
us and they swept Miami (Ohio)
last weekend, which was huge. We
are goingto take advantage of that
underdog role and run with it."

Companies sued
for calling bottles
biodegradable

California law
makes mislabeling
of bottles illegal
LOS ANGELES (AP) - The
California attorney general's
office yesterday sued three com-
panies over allegations they
misled consumers by marketing
plastic water bottles as biode-
gradable.
The lawsuit - said to be
the first government action to
enforce the state's environmen-
tal marketing law - accuses
ENSO Plastics of Mesa, Ariz.,
of falsely claiming their bottles
will biodegrade in less than five
years, leaving behind no harm-
ful materials.
It is illegal in California to
labela plastic food or drink con-
tainer as biodegradable when
such materials can take thou-
sands of years to break down, if
at all.
"Californians are committed
to recycling and protecting the
environment, but these efforts
are undermined by the false and
misleading claims these compa-
nies make when they wrongly
advertise their products as 'bio-
degradable,"' Attorney General
Kamala Harris said in a state-
ment.
Environmental groups have
long griped about plastic bot-
tles, which typically wind up in
the trash after a single use and
can only be recycled a num-
ber of times before the plastic

degrades.
In 2008, the state Legislature
enacted a law banning com-
panies from false advertising
on plastic food and beverage
containers after finding that
"littered plastic bags and plas-
tic containers have caused and
continue to cause significant
environmental harm and have
burdened local government
with significant environmental
cleanup costs."
The bill banned the use of
words like "biodegradable,"
"degradable" or "decompos-
able" in the labeling, a law that
will expand to all plastic prod-
ucts beginning in 2013.
Harris' lawsuit states that
ENSO claimed in marketing
materials to have developed
a resin additive that contains
microbial agents that speeds
up the centuries-long process
required to break down plastic.
The suit also said the compa-
nies are calling the bottles recy-
clable when, in reality, plastic
recyclers consider such bottles a
contaminant and will pull them
out of recyclable plastics.
The suit names two compa-
nies that sell water in ENSO's
bottles: Aquamantra, of Dana
Point, Calif., and Balance Water,
of West Orange, N.J. The prod-
ucts are found in stores across
the country, ranging from small
shops to major grocery store
chains and health food stores
such as Whole Foods.
ENSO didn't immediately
return two calls for comment.

Many of the 106 enthusiasts
on board the flight by Japan's All
Nippon Airways were carrying
memorabilia from past inaugu-
ral flights and snapping photos
of everything from the overhead
bins to the bathroom with a win-
dow and bidet.
Thomas Lee, of Los Angeles,
handed out his own press release
and biography. There was his
first inaugural flight - the Boe-
ing 747 as a 17-year-old boy in
1970 - and then the Airbus A380
four years ago.
"I'm not crazy," he said. "For
an aviation enthusiast, this is as
high as it gets. It's like going to a
movie on opening day."
He and the rest of the coach
passengers paid the apt sum of
78,700 yen, about $1,035, to-be
part of the inaugural flight.
The 787 has been sold by Boe-
ing as a "game changer," promis-
ing to revolutionize air travel just
as its 707 did by allowingnonstop
trans-Atlantic service and the
747 did by ushering in an age of

mass travel.
The 787 is designed to connect
cities that might otherwise not
have nonstop flights. Planes like
the Boeing 747 and 777 and the
Airbus A380 can fly most long-
haul routes but finding enough
daily passengers to fill the mas-
sive jets is a challenge. The A380
typically has 525 passengers but
can hold up to 853.
The 787 only carries 210 to 250
passengers. That means it can fly
nonstop routes that larger planes
can't profitably support like San
Francisco to Manchester, Eng-
land or Boston to Athens, Greece.
"It's goingto be a hub-avoiding
machine," said Ernie Arvai, part-
ner with aviation consulting firm
AirInsight. "You'd pay extra not
to go to (London's) Heathrow."
Connecting such smaller cit-
ies is the "holy grail" of air travel,
said Richard Aboulafia, analyst
with the Teal Group. That's why
the plane is the fastest-selling
new jet in aviation history. There
were 821 orders for the 787 before
its first flight, although 24 were
recently canceled by China East-
ern Airlines because of delays.

Local, organic food not always
safer despite growing popularity

Yemeni women protesters burn their veils during a demonstration demanding
the resignation of Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh yesterday.
Yemeni women

veq~Uil s in protest

Women play key
role in uprising
against president
SANAA, Yemen (AP) - Hun-
dreds of Yemeni women on
Wednesday set fire to traditional
female veils to protest the gov-
ernment's brutal crackdown
against the country's popular
uprising, as overnight clashes
in the capital and another city
killed 25 people, officials said.
In the capital Sanaa, the
women spread a black cloth
across a main street and threw
their full-body veils, known as
makrama, onto a pile, sprayed it
with oil and set it ablaze. As the
flames rose, they chanted: "Who
protects Yemeni women from
the crimes of the thugs?"
The women in Yemen have
taken a key role in the uprising
against President Ali Abdullah
Saleh's authoritarian rule that
erupted in March, inspired by
other Arab revolutions. Their
role came into the limelight ear-
lier in October, when Yemeni
woman activist Tawakkul Kar-
man was awarded the Nobel
Peace Prize, along with two
Liberian women, for their strug-
gle for women's rights.
Wednesday's protest, how-
ever, was not related to women's
rights or issues surrounding the
Islamic veils - rather, the act of
4%

women burning their clothing is
a symbolic Bedouin tribal ges-
ture signifying an appeal for help
to tribesmen, in this case to stop
the attacks on the protesters.
The women who burned
clothing in the capital were
wearing traditional veils at the
time, many covered in black from
head to toe.
The women's protest came as
clashes have intensified between
Saleh's forces and renegade
fighters who have sided with the
protesters and the opposition in
demands that the president step
down.
Medical and local officials
said up to 25 civilians, tribal
fighters and government soldiers
died overnight in Sanaa and the
city of Taiz despite a cease-fire
announcement by Saleh late
Tuesday. Scores of others were
wounded.
A medical official said seven
tribal fighters were among those
killed in Sanaa's Hassaba dis-
trict. Another medical official
said four residents and nine sol-
diers also died in the fighting
there.
Government forces also
shelled houses in Taiz - a hotbed
of anti-Saleh protests - killing
five people, including four mem-
bers of one family, a local official
said. All officials spoke on condi-
tion of anonymity because they
were not authorized to speak to
the media.

to visit the property to certify
it is organic and may report
to authorities if they see food

way. Customers may also be

But those checks aren't fail-
safe. The FDA has reported at
least 20 recalls due to patho-
gens in organic food in the last
two years, while the Agricul-
ture Department, which over-
sees meat safety, issued a recall
of more than 34,000 pounds of
organic beef last December due
to possible contamination with
E. coli.
Egg safety is equally ambigu-
ous. While many people like to
buy cage-free eggs, those chick-
ens may be exposed to bacteria
on the grounds where they are
roaming.
So what can a consumer do?
Experts say to follow the tra-
ditional rules, no matter what
the variety of food. Cook foods
like eggs and meat, and make
sure you are scrubbing fruit and
cleaning your kitchen well.
Do your part, and hope for
the best, the experts say.
"Labels like organic or local
don't translate into necessarily
safer products," says Caroline
Smith DeWaal of the Center for
Science in the Public Interest.
"They are capturing different
values but not ensuring safety."
Bushway of the Organic
Trade Association says one of
the best checks on food safety
is the devastating effect a recall
or foodborne illness outbreak
can have on a company's bot-
tom line.
"It's just good business to
make sure you are putting the
safest products on the market,"
she says.

DETROIT (AP) - Former
Democratic U.S. Rep. Howard
Wolpe, who helped pass the fed-
eral anti-apartheid act in 1986,
has died. He was 71.
The seven-term congress-
man had recently been ill with
a heart condition, former staffer
Ken Brock said Wednesday. He
died Tuesday at his home in Sau-
gatuck.
Wolpe, who also unsuccess-
fully sought the governor's office
in Michigan, served in Congress
from 1979-1992. As chair of the
U.S House Subcommittee on
Africa, he authored and man-
aged legislation imposing sanc-
tions against South Africa for its
system of white-minority rule.
"Howard was a very pleas-
ant guy, a gentleman in all
respects," said Battle Creek Dr.
Joe Schwarz, who teaches at the
University of Michigan's Gerald
R. Ford School of Public Policy.
"He was exceptionally bright
and exceptionally committed
to his mission," Schwarz said.
"He had a real deep and abiding
interest in African affairs where
he made his name in Congress."
Wolpe once served as Spe-
cial Envoy to Africa's Great
Lakes Region under President
Bill Clinton "where he initiated
peace talks and helped end civil
wars in Burundi and the Demo-
cratic Republic of the Congo,"
Democratic Rep. John Dingell
said in a statement.

From Page 1A
son said it's important students
know when their representatives
are absent and how their absen-
teeism prevents the development
of a strong student government.
Without full participation, MSA
lacks "passionate, enthusiastic
people serving those positions"
and cannot represent the student
population objectively, Watson
said.
To bridge the gap, MSA
announced a Representative Out-
reach Task Force at the assem-
bly's meeting Tuesday night in
an effort to promote communica-
tion between students and their
individual governments, Eral
said.
"We do have a very tangible
effort," Eral said. "It's just when
representatives don't come to
represent their students, every-
one's hurt."
Despite the low attendance,
the assembly has achieved quo-
rum at every meeting this semes-
ter, according to Eral. But the
lack of representation is impact-
ing the assembly's effectiveness,
he said.

"Vinyl is not obscure and anti-

Kerr admitted that when he
was younger, he never thought
the music he listened to would
still be popular today. Kerr's
favorite musicians include Bob
Dylan, Van Morrison, Bob Mar-
ley and the Velvet Underground,
whose album The Velvet Under-
ground & Nico is his all-time
favorite.
tIn addition to vinyl records,
Wazoo sells cassette tapes, DVDs
and CDs. While Kerr acknowl-
edged that online music outlets
such as Napster, Amazon and
iTunes negatively affect his busi-
ness, he thinks record stores still
have a strong presence in Ann
Arbor. Kerr pointed to 1993 as
a peak year for sales at Wazoo,
crediting the booming business
to the lack of music availability
online.
"All of those things combined
to hurf-record stores, and quite
a few went but of business," he

Eral pointed to the example

they didn't have enough informa-

attendance, Eral explained.
"If Rackham studentshad rep-
resentatives there, the Rackham
voice could have been heard,"
Eral said. "Ten people support-
ing a graduate student issue -
that would have done alot."
Michael Benson, president of
Rackham Student Government,
said no graduate student was
on the March 2011 ballot to run
for an MSA representative posi-
tion. Benson was unaware the
Rackham representatives had
resigned until he received a letter
from Eral. However, Benson said
that in the past five years, MSA
has only passed one resolution
specific to graduate students that
significantly affected them.
"I don't think many new ini-
tiatives that affect grad students
come out of this assembly," Ben-
son said.
said. "You really have to hustle
in every angle to survive in this
environment."
Kerr said ' he personally
enjoys purchasing records more
than buying music online. He
explained that certain aspects
of the record, including using a
turntable, examining cover art
and reading liner notes, are lost
when purchasing music on the.
Internet.
"There's a whole ritual
involved in playing records,"
Kerr said.
He added that the entire
Wazoo staff is knowledgeable
about the technical aspects of
listening to vinyl records, includ-
ing setting up the equipment -
details that people new to vinyl
often overlook.
Kerr said he is grateful to be
located so close to the Diag and
hopes the convenient location
encourages students to stop by in
between classes.
"Location is more important
than anything," he said, adding
that being on the second floor of
the building isn't a hindrance.
"We're comfortable here, kind
of hidden away," Kerr said. "The
people that want to know about
us will find us."

He added that the Google
products will allow the Universi-

"We see the Google platform

The implementation of the

Students can expect to access
their new Gmail accounts -
which will incorporate their
current uniqname - and other
Google tools by the end of March.
Students will then have a six-
month period when they can
transfer their e-mail from the
IMAP platform to the Gmail plat-
form.
Wrobleski said this manual
transfer of e-mail stems from

student feedback on how to best
implement the change to the
Google platform. The Univer-
sity will provide students with a
"step-by-step process" on how to
move their mail.
Faculty and staff will have
all their existing mail automati-
cally moved from the IMAP
system to the Google platform.
Because of this, they will receive
their Gmail accounts later than
March. Once the University
community - except forthe Uni-
versity of Michigan Health Sys-
tem, which will not have Gmail
access due to data restrictions
- has successfully switched to
the Gmail platform, the IMAP
server will be disabled, accord-
ing to Wrobleski.
While the IMAP server will
disappear, Rita Girardi, market-
ing communications specialist
senior for the NextGen program,
said CTools and other University
web programs will still exist but
will be enhanced by Google's
services for better communica-
tion.
"The goal of this project is to

really create an environment
where people can work togeth-
er more easily, and that's why
things like CTools aren't going
away," Girardi said. "We're not
taking anything away. We're
hoping to add options for people
to make their lives easier and
allow them to work together
more easily."
The decision to choose the
Google platform stems from
research conducted last year,
which showed a community pref-
erence for Google. The University
also considered using a Micro-
soft platform before deciding on
Google.
"The decision was made by our
IT leaders to recommend Google
and then our senior executives
at the University supported that
selection at the beginning of this
calendar year," Wrobleski said.
The collaboration with Google
will also join the University with
more than 100 other universities
that are using "Google Apps for
Higher Education," according
to Wrobleski. With Google, the
University will be able to better

collaborate not only at a campus
level, but also at a global level, he
said.
"There's a lot of cooperative
work that needs to go on in this
learning and teaching process
as well as in the research pro-
cess ... and part of that isn't just
inside of Ann Arbor," Wrobleski
said. "Of course you're going to
want to work with faculty and
researchers and people around
the world, and working with
Google should make that a little
bit easier."
While Wrobleski said the
change will inevitably cause
some disruptions, he hopes con-
necting the University network
through the Google platform
will allow for easier and more
enhanced communication for the
University community.
"People who are program-
mers and innovators in tech-
nology, they can build on top of
Google and enhance it, so we'd
like to put the tools in the hands
of these smart people so they can
use them as creatively as they can
imagine," Wrobleski said.

Former top Wall Street board
member denies insider trading

Gupta's lawyer calls
allegations, 'totally
baseless'
NEW YORK (AP) - A former
board member of Goldman Sachs
and Procter & Gamble pleaded not
guilty yesterday to federal charges
accusing him of acting as "the ille-
gal eyes and ears in the boardroom"
for a friend, a billionaire hedge fund
founder sentenced this month to 11
years in prison incthe biggest insider
trading case in history.
The case, built partially on
wiretaps used for the first time
in insider trading, has offered
unprecedented insight into greed
at the highest levels of Wall Street.
The arrest of Rajat Gupta took it

one step higher.
The indictment unsealed yes-
terday accuses Gupta of cheating
the markets with Raj Rajaratnam,
the 54-year-old convicted hedge
fund founder who was the probe's
prime target.
Gupta, 62, quietly surrendered
early in the day at the FBI's New
York Cityoffice, a few blocks north
of the ongoing Occupy Wall Street
demonstration against what pro-
testers call a culture of corporate
greed. His lawyer called the alle-
gations "totally baseless."
Swarmed by photographers,
Gupta left the courthouse shortly
before 4p.m.
Gupta, of Westport, Conn.,
pleaded not guilty to one count of
conspiracy to commit securities
fraud and five counts of securities

fraud, charges that carry a poten-
tial penalty of 105 years in prison.
He was freed on $10 million bail,
and conditions require him to
remain in the continental United
States. An April 9 trial date was set.
. The indictment in U.S. District
Court in Manhattan alleges Gupta
shared confidential information
about both Goldman Sachs and
Procter & Gamble at the height
of the financial crisis from 2008
through January 2009, knowing
that Rajaratnam would use the
secrets to buy and sell stock ahead
of public announcements..
In a release, U.S. Attorney Preet
BhararasaidGuptabrokethetrust
of some of the nation's top public
companies and "became the ille-
gal eyes and ears in the board-
room for his friend and business

associate, Raj Rajaratnam, who
reaped enormous profits from Mr.
Gupta's breach of duty."
Alluding to the wide scope of
the prosecutionhe added: "Today
we allege that the corruption we
have seen in the trading cubicles,
investment firms, law firms,
expert consulting firms, medi-
cal labs; and corporate suites also
insinuated itself into the board-
rooms of elite companies."
In all, 56 people have been
charged in insider trading cases
since Bharara took over shortly
before Rajaratanam's October
2009 arrest. Of those, 51 have
been convicted and 21 sentenced
to prison terms ranging from no
prisontime to11years, the longest
prison term ever given in an insid-
er trading case.

LICENSING
From Page 1A
make sense," Postema said.
"Again, it is a big square peg try-
ing to fit in the small round hole
of this statute. I want to disabuse
anybody of the notion that the
staff here is workinghard to pre-
vent things."
The dispensaries that opened
before the city's temporary mor-
atorium - that went into effect
in August 2010 and preceded
the ordinance - are encouraged
to apply before others, though
they are not guaranteed licenses,
Postema added.
The board members also dis-
cussed their concerns with the
zoning districts laid out in the
ordinance. Despite the city's
compliance with state regula-
tions on medical marijuana, the
state leaves zoning up to local
governments.
"The problem is that every
metaphor relies on higher gov-
ernment legislation and the
higher government has no word
on dispensaries," Postema said.
"In the zoning ordinance, unless
it's specifically allowed, the dis-
tribution of medical marijuana is
prohibited."
He added that there will con-
tinue to be higher level discus-
sions surrounding the city's
ordinances and the state's Mich-
igan Medical Marihuana Act,
which made medical marijuana
legal for registered patients in
2008.
Postema said he is commit-
ted to enforcing legislation, but
* added that he is "distressed"
with some of the inefficiencies
he has seen in the city's statutes.

"The city is in a difficult posi-
tion because when you think
about it, the act of licensing and
using the government to license
something raises some prob-
lematic issues for us," he said.
"I know it is a disappointment,
and I am not here to apologize
for the law. The law is imperfect,
and the law can be changed and
I would encourage the law to be
changed."
City Council member Sabra
Briere (D-Ward 1) - a support-
er of the ordinance - said in an
interview after the meeting that
the changes in policy over the
past few months have caused
confusion among board mem-
bers regarding state and city
medical marijuana regulations.
"The most interesting thing
to me was the endorsement of a
local option for dispensaries - a
change in the state law to create
that local option," Briere said.
"Because if that local option were
to pass at the state level ... we in
Ann Arbor, and governments
in Lansing and Ypsilanti, and
any of the communities around
the state that have passed local
licenses or zoning ordinances,
are going to be able to figure out
what the heck they're doing."
Jim Kenyon, a medical mari-
juana patient appointed to the
city's Medical Marijuana Advi-
sory Board, said during the
meeting he appreciated that
Postema attended the meeting
to hear the concerns of medical
marijuana advocates.
"We need to find a way that
gets through this with the least
carnage, and that's most expe-
dient and lets us live our gen-
tile bohemian state lives in Ann
Arbor," Kenyon said.

'U' international students
take a bite of Ann Arbor's
multicultural cuisine
By Veronica Menaldi, Daily Arts Writer

hen some students at the
University get a hint of
homesickness, they can
e ly drive an hour or
so on I-75 and find them-
selves in the warm embrace of their former home
- usually complete with home-cooked meals.
But for students hailing from other countries,
skipping out to their childhood house for the
weekend isn't an option - after all, they'd have
to board a plane for hours and fly over an ocean
or two. Fortunately, Ann Arbor has the next best
thing: meals that closely resemble hometown
dishes of Central America, Europe and beyond.
LSA senior Amie Hsu said food is a common
topic for the Conversation Circle she leads. The
Conversation Circles Program was started by the
International Institute at the University as an
opportunity for international students to prac-
tice their English skills with native speakers, and
Hsu has found that potlucks are often the best
wayto break the ice.
"Food is one aspect of culture," she said. "I
think it's somethingthatremindsthem of home."
Hsu said international food establishments
in America don't have quite the same foods that
could be found in the country of a food's origin,
but these state-side alternatives are beneficial for
students who find themselves as fish out of water
when they first set foot on campus.
Judy Dyer, English Language Institute Lec-
turer, agreed that food is an important link.
Since she has lived abroad for a number of
years, Dyer understands the importance of the
little things that remind her of home. When she
taught in China, one of those things was awarm
cup of coffee. In the rare moment she was able
to acquire a cup of instant coffee - not quite the
same as the real thing, but close enough - she
was pleased.
This is analogous to an international student's
situation. Though the foods in Ann Arbor may
not be exactly the same as they are back home,
they're similar enough to where most interna-
tional students would be able to appreciate them.
"It's an important component of that feeling of
security, feeling of familiarity and finding a piece
of home where you are making your home for the
next few years," Dyer said.

A home away from home
Architecture and Urban Planning student Ash-
wini Kamath was born and raised in India and
came to Ann Arbor in 2008.
She said if she goes out to eat, one in three times
it's at an Indian restaurant. And if she's doing the
cooking, 95 percent of the time it involves Indian
food like curry, rice and bread.
Indian food typically consists of Indian spices,
herbs, vegetables and fruits. Kamath finds most
of these ingredients from international Indian
markets like OM Market on Plymouth Road and
Bombay Grocers on Packard Street.
She said her most frequent purchases were dal
(a type of lentils), egg curry and vegetables like
bhindi (okra), potatoes and cauliflower.
Engineering graduate student Hatim Bukhari,
an international student who came here from
Saudi Arabia in 2006, also said he did a lot of
home cooking.
He described typical Saudi Arabian food to
be some type of meat combined with some kind
of rice and certain spices, and condiments like
cumin. .:
Bukhari buys some of his necessary ingredi-
ents at Arabic markets - there's one located on
North Campus called Jerusalem International
Market. A few of the things he buys in such mar-
kets are tahini sauce, sumac, fava beans and dif-
ferent types of rice.
Typically, Bukhari prefers to cook at home
rather than dine out.
"I feel like it's better," he said. "I'm not saying
I'm a good cook, but the thing is, in restaurants
you're not going to find exactly what you want.
You'll find something similar, so that's why I pre-
fer to cook."
An example of this is stir-fried liver. Though
Bukhari thinks the meal turns out decent in
restaurants, when he makes it himself, Bukhari
knows it'll turn outjust the way he prefers.
Of course, not all connoisseurs of international
cuisine were necessarily raised in foreign coun-
tries. LSA senior Alaina Moreno-Koehler grew up
in the suburbs of Flint like many in-state students.
But thanks to her father and grandparents back
in Puerto Rico, she has enjoyed a great deal of

FOOD* WARS
Each week, one Ann Arbor staple menu item becomes a
battlefield as Daily Arts editors butt heads over
which restaurant makes it best.
APPLE CIDERh

I

ALEX NEMETH & SON
Ann Arbor Farmer's Market
315 Detroit Street
An apple cider is only as good as its
"tang," and Alex Nemeth's refreshing
beverage has taken the strategy to heart.
As the essence of autumn incarnate, the
cider is immediately brisk, but its latent
sweetness allows it to round out smooth-
ly. Most importantly, it stays true to the
flavor of the fruit, making it the closest
you can come to sipping an apple.
TASTEE APPLE CIDER
White Market
609 East William Street
Tastee's strong apple twang - rather on
the sour side of sweet, a rabidburst of flavor
- can be hard to handle. For those who per-
sist, who drink slowly and let the taste lin-
ger, perhaps roll each sip around the tongue
and absorb every nuance, the sinful apple
touch can be just enough to alter percep-
tions about such a complex drink. But at the
end oftthe day, Tastee is an acquired taste.

HY'S CIDER MILL
People's Food Co-op
215 North Fourth Street
True, this People's Food Co-Op creation
isn't all local (pasteurization is a require-
ment, and many A2 farmers don't pasteur-
ize their goods), but the mini-mountains
of sugar dissolved in every sip more than
make up for the faux pas in sustainabil-
ity. But does excessive carb content really
a cider make? In the end, Hy's cider tastes
more like apple pie than a real beverage.
MEIJER BRAND APPLE CIDER
Meijer
3145 Ann Arbor-Saline Road
Drinking apple cider from Meijer is
like that hopeful reunion with an old
high school friend who has done nothing
for the past 10 years except live in his par-
ents' basement and visciously compete
with 10 year olds at World oftWarcraft. In
short, a disappointment. Sugary eupho-
ria quickly devolves to a bland excuse for
cider - like the friend who lets us down.

B-Side Buzz
Nick Harp
English lecturer
How do you feel about astronomy?
Astronomy's actually the only class I ever failed in college. I got a
big fat F in my transcript thanks to astronomy.
Where do you stand with apple cider?
I have important thoughts on apple cider, and here are my
thoughts as follows: Apple cider is delicious. However, apple cider
must not be pasteurized. If you want good apple cider, you must
find a place that is able to make it unpasteurized.
Isn't that kind of dangerous?
There is some risk, but if there's something worth dying for, it must
be good apple cider.

'UDARIA' (1997-2001), MTV
In MTV's snarky glory

How rhyme measures up

By KAYLA UPADHYAYA
Daily Arts Writer
Remember when MTV used to
be awesome? It might be hard to
think back to a time before "Jer-
sey Shore," "Teen Wolf" and the
noticeable lack of music, but back
in the '90s, MTV featured intelli-
gent programming. Most notably,
there was "Daria," one of the best
animated series ever.
Daria Morgendorffer made her
first appearance on Mike Judge's
MTV animated series "Beavis
and Butt-head" before breaking
away with her own spinoff series,
which lasted for five 13-episode
seasons and two TV movies.
Though "Beavis and Butt-head"
will be revived with new epi-
sodes this week, "Daria" and all
of the titular character's teenage
angst,bundled into combat boots
and an army-green jacket is start-
ing to be forgotten.
Daria was sharp-witted,
snarky and provided deadpan
commentary on the suburban
teenage world that surrounded
her. What made Daria so lovable
was her very realistic portrayal of
a type of high school girl largely
underrepresented on television
in the '90s: She is unpopular, but
she never wants to break away
from that label. Her transition
into high school is not easy. On
the first day, she is placed in a spe-
cial class for students with low
self-esteem (to which she replies:
"Don't worry, I don't have low
self-esteem. I have low esteem for
everyone else"). But Daria never
tries to change herself or her
ever-sarcastic outlook - not for
social status, nor to win the affec-
tions of a classmate. She's Daria,
and she may not be comfortable
in typical high school situations
like parties and dances, but she's
comfortable in her own skin.
The titular character was not
the only compelling female per-
sona on "Daria." There was Jane

Poetry doesn't rhyme
anymore, and the people
demand an explanation.
There should have been a press
release. Or a public referendum.
For many
of us, a non-
rhymingpoem
resembles a
non-alcoholic
beer: We don't
know why
anyone would
bother with it. DAVID
Or, to borrow LUCAS
from Robert --
Frost, "writ-
ing free verse is like playing ten-
nis with the net down."
But rhyme is hardly a necessity
for poetry, and many enduring,
non-rhyming poems predate
tennis, if not beer. Most classical
poetry lacks rhyme, as do nearly
all Old English poems. Rhyme
became a common feature of
English poetry only around the
time of Geoffrey Chaucer in the
14th century, and even then it was
often the subject of contentious
debate.


Milton's stance aside, The
Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry
and Poetics - which makes great
beach reading - notes, "the first
edition of the Oxford Book of
English Verse (1900) contains
883 poems, of which only 16 lack
rhyme." But the 20th century
would avenge Milton witness-
ing the ascension of free verse
as the choice of unsentimental,
unadorned modern poets. Rhyme
would become as useful as a
horse-drawn carriage.
But that's not entirely fair
either. Rhyme abided and
endures through poets' inventive-
ness, the need to "make it new"
that Ezra Pound demanded of
modern poetry. Though many
contemporary poems do not
rhyme, some of the best new
poems enlarge our sense of what
rhyme is, and in doingsoenlarge
our sense of language itself.
Consider this section of "Sleep-
ing with One Eye Open" by Mark
Strand:

and language itself as individual
invention. Even the title refers
to "our family word / for the hot
water bottle," a secret the speaker
has revealed over the years
to various others, sometimes
accepted, sometimes "laid...
between us like a sword." In one
instance,
An hotel room in New York City
with a girl who spoke hardly any
English,
my hand on her breast
like the smouldering one-off
spoor of the yeti
or some other shy beast
that has yet to enter the language.
Muldoon is so subtle that his
rhymes could go unnoticed. It
certainly required several read-
ings before realizing that each
end word in the poem had a quiet,
unlikely rhyming partner.
"English" and "language,"
in particular, isso far-fetched
a rhyme that I, and many other
readers, resist it. That doesn't
rhyme, we protest. But then one
speaks the rhyme aloud in order
to challenge it - "English," "lan-
guage" - one chews through it
and hears the aural similarities
binding the words. We partici-
pate in rhyming as a process to
be worked through and we, like
the poet, create and recreate our
English language as we speak it.
Keep that idea in mind for the
first few sentences of Harryette
Mullen's prose poem "Kirstenog-
raphy:"
K was burn at the bend of the ear
in the mouth of remember. She
was the fecund chill burn in her
famish. She came into the word
with a putty smoother, a hand-
sewn
farther, and a yodeler cistern.
These aren't rhymes in any
sense what we're used to. In fact,
the poem doesn't make sense
in any way we're used to. But

Jane's quips. But on a lesser
show, that's all Quinn would
be: an insipid, dumb queen bee.
Quinn is complex, perceptive
and smart in a way Daria never
could be. She may pay others to
do her homework and care way
too much about her social status,

The characters of"Daria" were
relatable and grew, which isn't
typical of animated series. They
were not stock types, but real
representations of young women.
And that's something to celebrate
- in a monotone, monosyllabic
utterance, of course.

In a prefatory note to "Para-
dise Lost" (1667), John Milton
defends his use of blank verse
(unrhymed iambic pentameter):
"rime (is) ... the invention of a
barbarous age, to set off wretch-
ed matter and lame metre..."
One success of his poem, as
Milton imagined it, was the
"ancient (non-rhyming) liberty
recovered ... from the trouble-
some and modern bondage of
rhyming." Rhyme was nothing
less than linguistic enslavement
- but Milton always was a bit
grandiose.

Strand's rhymes do not so
much rhyme as echo and, as
echoes do, present our own
voice to us as if we had meant
something else by what we had
said, as if we ourselves were
somebody else. The rhymes
become more than mere verbal
adornment; they become sonic
manifestations of the worry that
keeps the speaker half-awake:
"sleeping with one eye open, /
Hoping / That nothing, nothing
will happen."
Paul Muldoon's poem "Quoof"

Cafe Havana provides students with a Latin fusion experience.

GLOBAL FOOD
From Page 1B
Cuban culture at home. Moreno-
Koehler recalled the delicious
Cuban food her father would
make when he returned home
from work - her favorites include
tostones (fried plantains), picadil-
lo, Cuban sandwiches and paella.
Now that she's living in Ann
Arbor and no longer can depend
on her father's meals, she pre-
pares Cuban food herself and
occasionally eats out at Cuban-
like restaurants. And since she
doesn't live too far away, she also
has the luxury of being able to
drive home if the food cravings
are too much to control.
For the most part, her go-to
meal to make is rice and beans,
in addition to meals that require
plantains.
Unfortunately for Moreno-
Koehler, her ability to cook Cuban
food has become more difficult
since she decided to become a
vegetarian. Thanks to her grand-
mother's advice, she was able to
come up with a few meals that
incorporate beans, rice, eggplant
and typical Cuban spices.
A common problem these stu-
dents face arises from shopping at
international markets - the pric-
es of goods often change. Engi-
neering graduate student Hyeon
Joo, who came to Ann Arbor in
2009 from South Korea, said he
enjoyed buying foods like kimchi,
bulgogi, samsang, gochujand, fish
and choco pie at Manna Oriental
Market and Galleria Asian Mar-
ket, but he was frustrated by the
often-fluctuating prices.
The solution to this problem
lies in a surprising location. Some
international students found a
wide availability of international
foods in chain grocery stores like
Meijer and Kroger, praising these
big-box markets for their cheap-
ness and proximity. Bukhari said
he found most of his spices there,
and Moreno-Koehler cited Mei-
jer as a convenient place, since it
was not as far and less expensive
than a typical international food
market.
There's no taste like home
Though these individuals enjoy
and prefer eating their typical
cultural foods, sometimes they
can't find the time to cook. The
solution to this predicament is to

go out to restaurants, usually ones
similar to those found at home.
When Kamath goes out to eat,
the spicier the food, the better.
Her favorite Indian restaurants
that fulfill this requirement are
Shalimar Restaurant and Taste of
India Suvai.
Where and what she chooses
depends on her appetite: If she's
not particularly hungry, she'll go
for Southern Indian food, since
it's typically more snacky. But for
dinner, she said she enjoys North-
ern and Southern Indian food
equally.
Her typical meals at restau-
rants are chicken tikka masala (a
curry dish with chicken chunks),
seekh kebab, dal and naan (a leav-
ened oven-baked flatbread).
Still, these restaurant's takes
on dishes do not quite resemble
the ones in her native India.
"It's the best of what we can
get here," Kamath said. "I think
it has to do with the palate here.
Sometimes it won't be really
spicy. They kind of alter the spic-
es to make sure it's not too spicy
or too bland."
Moreno-Koehler had the
opposite reaction to the restau-
rants of Ann Arbor in regards to
their spice level. She said many
of the Latin restaurants on cam-
pus, particularly Cafe Habana,
are a fusion of a few Latin cul-
tures, which results in a hybrid
flavor not completely familiar to
her.
"It's as authentic as you can
get in Ann Arbor, Michigan,"
Moreno-Koehler said. "They do a
lot that's authentic, but it's meant
to be a fusion of things, so some

of the stuff is spicy. Cuban food
isn't spicy necessarily; our spic-
es are for flavor not for burning
your tongue off."
She added: "They're pandering
to a customer base that doesn't
know that and expects Mexican-
style spicy."
Cross-culture eating
A main difference Joo found
between meals in Ann Arbor
compared to those found in his
home country is the amount
of food served. When he first
arrived in America, Joo said he
could barely finish a full meal
since the American portions
were so large. Though the taste
of the food was comparable to
that of his native Korea, the larg-
er bowls and plates he encoun-
tered were unfamiliar.
But some students have grown
used to the American way of life.
Engineering sophomore Ken
Ling was born in China and grew
up with a variety of Chinese food.
Ling called Panda Express and
other "Americanized Chinese
restaurants" not as authentic or
"attractive" since their meals are
tailored more to American taste
buds.
Ling usually likes to go to
Great Shanghai, Asian Legend,
Evergreen Restaurant, Asia City,
Middle Kingdom and Chia Shi-
ang Restaurant for their authen-
ticity. However, he admitted he
still goes to Panda Express from
time to time.
Dyer has noticed this shift
in mindset. She has seen her
international students gradually
incorporating some of the food
customs native to America in
their daily lives, be ita cup of cof-
fee in the morning or fast food.
"They're adapting a whole
new food culture while they're
here," she said. "They're being
acculturated into our American
way of eating."
Ultimately, food's most impor-
tant aspect is its communal qual-
ity. Dyer has had many potlucks
with her students throughout the
years and praises food's capabil-
ity to be shared.
"It's not just sharing within
your own culture, but sharing
across cultures," she said. "We're
actually very similar sometimes,
so the whole act of sharing food
is important."

Connecting with
the human history
of astronomy
By KAYLA UPADHYAYA
Daily Arts Writer
Physicists, rocket scientists and
mathematicians aren't the only
people who appreciate astronomy
- humans have always been fas-
cinated by the night sky. Its allur-
ing beauty, its mystery, its sheer
vastness - it's hard not to look to
the stars and yearn to know more.
And thanks to advancements in
technology, just about anyone can
explore space and learn about the
galaxy.
"We seem to have this natu-
ral explorer sense about us," said
Matt Linke, the director of the
planetarium on the fourth floor of
the University's Exhibit Museum
of Natural History. "We're curi-
ous about what's up there. We've
all looked up and seen a bright
something, the twinkling some-
thing, or the shooting something,
and so we want to know what
those things are."
The planetarium serves as a
resource to explore the universe.
On weekends, museum staffers
give star talks in the facility, not
only explaining ways to locate
certain stars and constellations,
but also sharing the mythology
that fills the nighttime sky. Sitting
in the planetarium's plush leather
seats, one can look up in the dome
and see the beautiful night sky
spread above - unlike the dim,
light-polluted sky seen from cam-
pus.
"We try to cover alittle mythol-
ogy and a little astronomy," Linke
said. "A star talk is mostly ground-
based, but then we also leave the
earth and take advantage of the
technology."
Linke has been working in
planetarium education for 33
years and has been at the Univer-
sity for more than 22 years.
"I'm certainly more of a tra-
ditional planetarium educator,"
Linke explained. "I'm not an
astronomer by training."

Linke said the purpose of the
planetariumistoeducate,getpeo-
ple interested in astronomy and
to understand what they're look-
ing at. Sometimes people will ask
him what stars they might be able
to see on their vacations in other
countries. By simply punching
in coordinates, the planetarium
can take its viewers to anywhere
on the globe and show what the
nighttime sky will look like from
that location.
The planetarium also runs
shows that explore specific top-
ics, like black holes, perceptions
of space throughout time and
the motions of the sun, earth and
moon. A show called "Stars of the
Pharaohs" combines history and
astronomy, allowing viewers to
explore the role of the nighttime
sky in ancient civilization. To the
Egyptians, the stars told tales of
their gods.
This sacred connection
between the stars and storytelling
is not lost. Today, people are just
as allured by the sky as they were
in ancient times. Linke called this
interest "ingrained in us."
The dome uses two sets of
graphics to depict constellations
during star talks: redline draw-
ings that connect the stars and
the actual pictures of what they
represent Linke said the physi-
cal drawings are more useful for
storytelling.
Linke reflected upon a time
when people existed in a world
where there wasn't as much light
pollution as there is today.
"We know they were watching
the sky," he said. "We see their
petroglyphs; we see the kind of
things they did in caves, things
they made. They were clearly
visualizing what they saw in the
nighttime sky."
The Exhibit Museum is not
the only place with a planetarium
on campus. A new planetarium
resides in Angell Hall, along with
an observatory that allows stu-
dents to observe the actual sky.
"(Looking at the sky) takes you
to a different mindset than you
would have in your everyday life,"

said LSA junior Mary Holt, presi-
dent of the Student Astronomi-
cal Society. "It's something that's
outside of your world and makes
you think about what else could
be out there."
The Student Astronomical
Society hosts open houses in the
Angell Hall Observatory a couple
oftimes a month, focusing on gen-
erating student interest in astron-
omy. On clear nights, they set up
telescopes in the observatory.'
The Student Astronomical
Society tries to make astron''y
more accessible to people wht
might not necessarily be interest-
ed in science.
The images projected in the
planetarium - brilliant star clus-
ters, expansive nebulae, constel-
lations, planets and the moon
- all have as much artistic value
as they do scientific.
"Sometimes there's art in sci-
ence," Holt said. "I feel thatthere's
a beauty to it. Finding patterns in
the sky is also an art."
Though the planetariums
in Angell Hall and the Exhibit
Museum serve more or less the
same purpose, the shows they
give differ because the sky is a
canvas that can be interpreted.
Linke said he always makes an
effort to work different percep-
tions of common constellations
into his sky programs.
"The mythology, the sky leg-
ends, are an important part
because it's part of our collective
human background and culture,'
Linke said. "If I say constella-
tions and I mention a few names,
people just think right away that
they're Greek and Roman constel-
lations. But the reality is, every
culture on the planet has left their
fingerprints on the sky."
It's clear the night sky is not
just for space geeks and wannabe
astronauts. Its rich history and
artistic beauty make it something
that almost anyone can appreci-
ate. Linke and Holt agreed the
night sky is something we all
share. Though it is the same sky
we see, there are many ways to
enjoy and interpret it.

rhymes work byestablishing
relationships between words
based on sounds; words that
sound alike purely by accident
become semantically yoked.
Mullen simplyuses a differ-
ent technique to accomplish
the same end. For "burn," read
"born;" for "bend of the ear,"
read "end of the year," and so on.
But then go back and read the
poem asit's written, and notice

how your own mind "corrects"
what's printed into what you
think it should say. The printed
page becomes the poem that
exists and the poem we imagine
instead. No wonder Mullen offers
"came into the word" for "came
into the world."
We too come into the world as
we come into the word. Rhyme is
only one of the ways poets make
something new of both.
"Lucas" really only rhymes
with "mucus." To discuss,
