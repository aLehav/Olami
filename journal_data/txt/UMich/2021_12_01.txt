For 3,653 days — long, arduous, hollow 
days — the Michigan football program 
lived in the shadows of its unremitting 
failures against Ohio State. 
There won’t be a 3,654th day. At 
long last, that futile streak is over. 
After eight consecutive bitter 
losses to the Buckeyes, the Wolverines 
emerged from The Game victorious. 
No. 5 Michigan (11-1 overall, 8-1 Big 
Ten) shocked No. 2 Ohio State (10-
2, 8-1), 42-27, clinching the Big Ten 
East and punching a ticket to next 
Saturday’s Big Ten Championship 
Game. 
“One of my favorite sayings of all 
time is, ‘When there’s a will, there’s a 
way,’ ” Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
said after the game. “And the will was 
very strong for our team.” 
As the fourth quarter wound 
to a close, reality melded with 
imagination. Senior running back 
Hassan Haskins stood in the 

endzone with outstretched arms, 
celebrating 
a 
touchdown 
that 
handed Michigan a 15-point lead 
with 2:17 minutes to play. He blew 
kisses to the crowd, beckoning the 
raucous sea of maize pom poms that 
serenaded him for an electric five 
touchdown performance. 
Pandemonium had officially set in. 
When the clock struck double-
zeroes, everyone seemed to forget 
about the freezing cold and the endless 
nightmares from previous defeats. 
Droves of fans plunged from the 
stands and spilled out onto the turf, 
reveling in their newfound glory. 
Michigan, champions of the Big 
Ten East. 
“It was a surreal moment,” junior 
quarterback Cade McNamara said. 
“It’s something we’ve dreamed of. 
Every 6 a.m. (practice), that feeling is 
the reason why we do it.”
Saturday offered an opportunity 
for the Wolverines to exorcise past 
demons, escaping the recent doldrums 
and persistent pain of the rivalry. A 
win would vault them into the Big 

Ten Championship Game and buoy 
aspirations of a berth in the College 
Football Playoff, two hurdles that 
the program had yet to clear as of 
the morning, seven years into Jim 
Harbaugh’s tenure. 
But just as toppling the Buckeyes 
began 
to 
feel 
sisyphean, 
the 
Wolverines punched first — and 
refused to relent. 

“It was really like a war out 
there,” senior defensive end Aidan 
Hutchinson, who wreaked havoc on 
Ohio State’s offense with three sacks, 
said. 
On Michigan’s opening possession, 
sophomore receiver A.J. Henning 

found the endzone on a 14-yard 
touchdown run, whipping Michigan 
Stadium into an immediate frenzy.
In the second quarter, even as 
Ohio State took a brief 10-7 lead, 
Michigan proved unfazed, embodying 
its season-long serenity. A 13-play, 
82-yard touchdown drive sent the 
Wolverines into halftime clenching a 
14-13 lead. 
In past years, Michigan unraveled 
in similar moments, particularly in 
The Game. On Saturday, the team 
merely grew stronger. 
The second half started to a tee. 
The Wolverines’ defense forced a crisp 
three-and-out, and the offense blazed 
down the field, running the ball three 
times for a total of 81 yards; Haskins 
capped the drive with a touchdown. 
They had kicked Ohio State back 
onto its heels, and the Buckeyes would 
never recover. 
Michigan’s 
offense, 
having 
re-discovered its rhythm, operated 
with machine-like efficiency. A 31-yard 
pass from freshman quarterback J.J. 
McCarthy to sophomore receiver 

Roman Wilson set up a 34-yard flea-
flicker from McNamara to junior 
receiver Mike Sainristil. 
So hapless were the Buckeyes 
that only a brief kerfuffle could 
slow down the Wolverines. After a 
scrum triggered an unsportsmanlike 
conduct on Ohio State’s Cameron 
Brown, Michigan found the endzone 
again. Haskins bounced outside, 
scoring for the third time on the day, 
staking the Wolverines to a stunning 
15-point lead. 
The result incited delirium and 
momentarily broke the Michigan 
Stadium 
scoreboard 
— 
an 
apt 
microcosm for the shock of The 
Game’s result. 
Even as Ohio State scratched and 
clawed its way to an early fourth 
quarter 
touchdown, 
Michigan 
responded with yet another emphatic, 
methodic drive. Haskins wiggled 
his way down the field, ultimately 
plowing into the endzone for his 
fourth touchdown. 
In the game’s waning minutes, 
when Stroud’s fourth-and-18 heave fell 

shy of a first down, the reality set in. 
Bleachers rattled. The stadium shook. 
Hutchinson and fifth-year safety Brad 
Hawkins shed tears. 
“We 
have 
(a 
sign) 
inside 
Schembechler Hall, ‘What are you 
doing today to beat Ohio State,’ ” 
Hawkins said. “And today, we beat 
them. It’s a blessing.” 
A blessing, perhaps, but certainly 
not a product of luck. 
“Every workout, every practice, 
every game, everything that we put 
into this season — that’s something 
that we kept in the back of our minds 
every single day that we entered 
Schembechler Hall,” McNamara said 
of Ohio State. “We did enough to beat 
them today.” 
After nine years of perpetual 
suffering, Michigan had achieved the 
unthinkable. It’s a game that no one 
will soon forget. 
“We’ve got a lot of hours left 
today,” Harbaugh smirked, allowing 
himself to digest the gravity of the 
moment. “… Celebrating long into 
the night.”

When a couple knocked on Rack-
ham student Jeffrey Lockhart’s door 
on Nov. 4 asking if he was planning 
on renewing his apartment lease, 
Lockhart knew something wasn’t 
right. 
As a tenant of Oxford Companies, 
a popular Ann Arbor real estate com-
pany, Lockhart said he was surprised 
to find prospective tenants outside 
his home asking about his plans to 
renew so that they can potentially 
take over his lease next year. Lock-
hart said he received an email from 
the leasing company that said “leas-
ing season is upon us.”
“(Oxford Companies) wrote the 
email basically as if the new ordi-
nance had not happened and that 
leasing season was now in early 
October, which it of course is not 
anymore because that is the whole 
point of the new ordinance,” Lock-
hart said.
In September, the city of Ann 
Arbor approved a new leasing ordi-
nance to protect students from being 
forced into signing leases nearly a 
year before the lease was planned 
to start. Multiple stakeholders were 
involved in the development of the 
legislation, including the Graduate 
Employees’ Organization, Central 
Student Government, tenants and 
landlords.
The 
new 
leasing 
ordinance 
ensures landlords are unable to show 
a property to new tenants until 150 
days prior to the expiration of the 
current lease. Previous legislation 
allowed landlords to begin showing 
properties to prospective tenants 70 
days into the current lease. In oppo-
sition to the new ordinance, land-
lords filed a lawsuit in September 

against the city of Ann Arbor.
Now, many tenants are saying 
that landlords are finding loopholes 
in the new ordinance and pressuring 
students in current leases to renew 
their contracts much earlier than the 
accepted time period.
Engineering senior Nathan Nohr 
is currently a resident of Prime 
Student Housing, a local housing 
authority. In a statement to The 
Michigan Daily, Nohr said there is 
a waitlist process for current resi-
dents. According to Nohr, a reserva-
tion requires paying one and a half 
months of rent, which will give resi-
dents priority to sign in March — a 
move Nohr said is unfair.
“Prime Student Housing notified 
current residents in September that 
we would need to resign our lease or 
else they would open up reservations 
for our apartment,” Nohr wrote. 
“This circumvents the ordinance 
and still requires students to renew 
early in the year and now forces 
other prospective residents to make 
a hefty reservation if they want to 
make sure to get a place. If students 
decide not to act on the waitlist res-
ervation they lose the rent reserva-
tion fee.” 
As a GEO member in the union’s 
housing caucus group, Rackham 
student Lucy Peterson said the leg-
islation was widely supported by 
GEO members since many in the 
organization have experienced their 
own issues with housing as graduate 
students. 
“From being graduate students 
living in the city for a while, a lot 
of us have experienced issues with 
early leasing,” Peterson said. “Grad-
uate students have to handle a lot 
of precarity in their work because 
we could be needing to do research 
one semester, we could get a job and 
have to move. So the idea of having to 

sign a lease 10 months in advance is a 
huge burden on graduate students in 
particular.”
Peterson said she believes some 
landlords are using bribes and 
threats to encourage tenants to sign 
the leases early. 
“(Some landlords are) counting on 
tenants being afraid and isolated and 
worried about their housing security 
to get them to renew,” Peterson said. 
“So landlords are free to use pres-
sure, coercion, manipulation, bribes 
and threats in order to get their 
existing tenants to renew or to say 
that they’re not going to renew.”
CSG President Nithya Arun, a 
Public Health senior, said she also 
received an email from University 
Towers — a popular student hous-
ing apartment complex — saying 
they are ready to start signing leases 
for next year. She said that CSG has 
received many complaints from stu-
dents who expressed frustrations 
about their landlords disregarding 
the new ordinance. 
“I immediately thought that the 
leasing period is not supposed to be 
open until March, so that seems like 
a violation,” Arun said. 
Lockhart said there is also a 
power dynamic that exists between 
landlords and tenants, making the 
effort to stand up for tenant rights 
difficult for some renters who do 
not necessarily understand the City 
Council rules.
“If I didn’t follow local city coun-
cil ordinance stuff and if I wasn’t 
paying close attention to this, I’d 
have no idea that I didn’t have to 
make that decision now,” Lockhart 
said. “These are the people that con-
trol whether you have housing, how 
much you pay for housing, they have 
a lot of power and it’s very easy for 
landlords to make people’s lives mis-
erable.” 

Arun said she and other CSG 
members felt very passionate about 
housing issues since they have also 
experienced issues with leasing 
before. Despite all the effort put 
forth by CSG, GEO and City Council 
to pass this legislation, Arun said the 
same issues are still prevalent. 
“A lot of shareholders spent time 
crafting this piece of legislation and 
making sure students would benefit 
from it and not be pressured to sign 
leases early, and now it almost feels 
like nothing has changed,” Arun said.
Since landlords now have to wait 
longer than they did in previous 
years to sign leases for their prop-
erties, many are offering voluntary 
waitlists for new tenants to join, 
according to Jordan Else, a landlord 
with Wessinger Properties. Else has 
been involved with the Ann Arbor 
housing market as a resident, parent 
of a U-M student and now as a land-
lord with her husband. 
The concept of the voluntary 
waitlist varies with each landlord, 
but the concept allows renters to 
reserve a spot in a certain building 
or unit in advance without officially 
signing a lease since leases cannot be 
signed at this time, Else said. 
Else said she is in support of the 
ordinance and that she feels that 
there is confusion about how the 
ordinance affects leases that begin 
in May versus those that begin in 
September. With the new ordinance, 
she said that new May leases can 
now be signed in early December 
and September leases can be signed 
in March.
“I think part of why all this isn’t 
working great and has historically 
not worked great is there’s an educa-
tion piece that’s missing,” Else said. 

An unknown individual splat-
tered red paint onto the statue of Bo 
Schembechler in front of Schem-
bechler Hall on the University of 
Michigan campus and spray painted 
“Bo knew #HailToTheVictims” at its 
base overnight on Nov. 23.
“Bo knew” references the allega-
tions that the late Schembechler, 
head football coach at Michigan 
from 1969 to 1989 and later athletic 
director, was alerted several times to 
former athletic doctor Robert Ander-
son’s sexual abuse of football players 
and failed to take appropriate action. 
Anderson was the head doctor for the 
football team during much of Schem-
bechler’s tenure.
More than 950 former University 
students have come forward in recent 
years alleging Anderson abused 
them, most typically under the guise 
of medical examinations.
An anonymous local resident 
took responsibility for the action 
in an email sent to local media and 

obtained by The Michigan Daily.
“It is time for the world to know 
that Bo is responsible for the abuse of 
innumerable Michigan football play-
ers,” the resident wrote.
The resident wrote that the action 
was in solidarity with the “Hail to the 
Victims” campaign led by Anderson 
survivors, who have been protest-
ing for the past few months to bring 
attention to the abuse and to hold the 
University accountable. 
Jonathan Vaughn, a former foot-
ball player and Anderson survivor 
who has been protesting outside of 
University President Mark Schlis-
sel’s house since Oct. 8 to ask for the 
University to take responsibility for 
Anderson’s abuse, told The Daily that 
the statue paint was not related to his 
protest.
“Not in anyway!” Vaughn wrote in 
a text message. “I’m out here every-
day fighting for justice why would I 
go and do something unjust?!” [sic]
The University is investigating the 
paint incident, according to Univer-
sity spokesperson Rick Fitzgerald. 
“We understand and appreciate 
the passionate advocacy on behalf of 

those who were abused by the late 
Robert Anderson,” Fitzgerald wrote 
in an email to The Daily. “But the 
vandalism to the University of Michi-
gan statue of Bo Schembechler will 
be investigated fully in order to hold 
those responsible accountable for 
their actions.”
Fitzgerald added that the Uni-
versity is working toward “fair com-
pensation” for Anderson survivors in 
confidential mediation. 
“We are working every day to 
make our campus safer for every 
member of our community,” Fitzger-
ald wrote.
A spokesperson for the Division 
of Public Safety and Security had no 
update to provide on the investiga-
tion. 
A representative for Michigan 
Students Against Sexual Assault, 
a campus organization that has 
advocated for Anderson survivors 
in recent months, did not have any 
information or comment on the paint 
incident. 
The paint incident comes days 
before the Michigan football team 
faces Ohio State, in a rivalry that 

largely defined Schembechler’s lega-
cy before allegations that he knew of 
Anderson’s abuse surfaced last year. 
Since then, many community mem-
bers have called for a reevaluation of 
the place of Schembechler’s image on 
campus.
Though the University has yet to 
comment directly on Schembechler, 
the huge “The Team, The Team, 
The Team” banner, quoting a famous 
Schembechler speech and tradition-
ally unfurled in the student section at 
every home game, has not appeared 
at Michigan Stadium since 2019.
Schlissel 
declined 
to 
answer 
whether he supported removing the 
statue or renaming Schembechler 
Hall, the football team’s main prac-
tice facility, when The Daily asked 
him in August. 
“This Schembechler issue is too 
tied up in the litigation around the 
awful acts of Dr. Anderson to really 
act on right now,” Schlissel said. 
“We’ll see what happens down the 
road.”

The University of Michi-
gan’s endowment, which is 
currently valued at $17 billion, 
rose by an estimated $4.7 bil-
lion in the 2021 financial year, 
a 40.6% return on investment. 
The increase was announced by 
Geoffrey Chatas, executive vice 
president and chief financial 
officer, at the Oct. 21 Board of 
Regents meeting.
This year, higher education 
institution endowments across 
the U.S. saw the strongest 
annual performance since 1986, 
with an increase of 27% on aver-
age. Many similarly endowed 
schools 
to 
the 
University 
announced eye-popping figures: 
Brown University announced 
a 51% return and Washington 
University in St. Louis broke 
records with a return of 65%. 
Brian Smith, U-M associate 
vice president for finance, said 
the timeline for an endowment 
is not one year but “perpetu-
ity,” leading him to remain cau-

tious when speculating on future 
growth. Over a 20-year period, 
the endowment’s return aver-
ages around 9.5%.
“The endowment is here for 
the long haul and to provide con-
sistent support or raw consistent 
income,” Smith said. “A 40% 
year is definitely an outlier. It’s 
not often that we have a year like 
that. In financial markets in par-
ticular, over time reversion to the 
mean typically proves out.”
The growth of endowments 
generally mirrors the health 
of the stock market, which has 
more than doubled its value 
in 2021 from its lowest level in 
March 2020. Soaring tech com-
pany stocks, various federal 
COVID-19 relief bills and inter-
est rate cuts from the U.S. Fed-
eral Reserve all contributed to a 
booming stock market, despite 
the pandemic. 
Smith said the bulk of the Uni-
versity’s endowment growth is 
due to the returns from venture 
capital and private equity funds, 
two asset classes that higher 
education institutions increas-

ingly invest in. 
However, those gains for ven-
ture capital and private equity 
funds are “unrealized,” mean-
ing they are not liquid, accord-
ing to Smith. Non-liquid assets 
are typically those that can’t be 
quickly converted into cash, like 
real estate properties or land.
“Venture capital and private 
equity are private transactions 
that aren’t publicly traded,” 
Smith said. “Typically the under-
lying investment agreements 
could be 10-plus year commit-
ments where you’re not going to 
get your money for years down 
the road.”
Business junior Noah Maci-
ulewicz, president of student 
investment 
group 
Wolverine 
Capital Investments, explained 
that the endowment benefited 
from dips in the stock market 
coinciding with the predeter-
mined days when shares were 
purchased. 
“Every time that the Univer-
sity has bought more shares has 
been when the market has been 
in the absolute best position, 

which is why the endowment’s 
been making so much money 
over the past year and a half,” 
Maciulewicz said. “The people 
managing the fund are making 
good stock picks and the time in 
which they’ve done investing has 
just happened to be absolutely 
perfect.”
John Burkhardt, clinical pro-
fessor emeritus in the School of 
Education, said donors tend to 
give more money to schools with 
large existing endowments, and 
endowment growth relies on the 
long history of donations since 
the University’s founding in 1817. 
“One of the functions for big 
endowments is how long has the 
institution been soliciting sup-
port from donors,” Burkhardt 
said. “Contributions made to 
these institutions that were 
founded in the 19th century have 
been earning interest for a very 
long time. This is just a statement 
of American society: If you have 
money, you make money.”

Bundled up in hats and gloves 
and with coffees in hand, doz-
ens of Ann Arbor community 
members braved the brisk, cold 
morning of Nov. 20 to increase 
awareness and advocate for 
unhoused individuals in Washt-
enaw County. 
In honor of National Hunger 
and Homelessness Awareness 
Week, the Shelter Association of 
Washtenaw County organized 
the “Hustle for Housing and 
Walk to End Homelessness,” 
which included a two-mile walk 
around downtown Ann Arbor. 
The group first gathered at Lib-
erty Plaza at the corner of East 
Liberty St. and South Division St. 
Adam, a former unhoused 
client at the Delonis Shelter, 
recently received housing assis-
tance in Ann Arbor. After being 
unhoused for a long time, Adam 
told the crowd housing is a 
necessity for all people and urged 
county leaders to provide the 
funding and resources to sup-
port other unhoused individuals 
in the county.
“We are people, we are human 
beings, we deserve housing,” 
Adam said. “We need other peo-
ple to look at us as we are people. 
We are human just like you. If we 
are left out on the streets, there’s 
a possibility we might end up in 
the hospital, dead or anything 
else. It’s unsafe.”
Amanda 
Carlisle, 
execu-
tive director of the Washtenaw 
County Housing Alliance, also 
spoke to the community, advo-
cating for the need to increase 
resources to support more per-
manent 
affordable 
housing 
options.
“We want to make sure that 
we share with everybody that 
there are people experiencing 

housing insecurity here, there are 
people who are homeless right 
here in Washtenaw County, and 
we know what we can do to help 
them,” Carlisle said. “We can pro-
vide them with permanent hous-
ing. We can provide them with 
services. We can provide them 
with rapid rehousing, get them 
out of the streets, out of shelters. 
We know what we can do. We just 
need the resources to do it.”
Some local organizations have 
already contributed to the effort. 
Avalon Housing, a non-profit 
organization 
providing 
per-
manent affordable housing for 
more than 800 people in Washt-
enaw County, recently opened 
36 affordable apartment units 
on Maple Road. The project was 
funded in part by the city of Ann 
Arbor’s 20-year affordable hous-
ing millage. 
“We used a ton of federal dol-
lars to build (the Avalon) housing 
but the services that are being 
provided 
at 
Avalon 
Hickory 
Way projects are being funded 
through the millage, so this really 
matters,” Carlisle said. “What you 
can do now is make sure to pay 
attention to what’s happening at 
the city and county level and also 
at the federal level.”
The Biden Administration’s 
Build Back Better Bill, which was 
passed in the House of Represen-
tatives on Nov. 19, includes efforts 
to build more than one million 
new rental and single-family 
homes. The bill also contains 
rental and down payment assis-
tance using an expanded voucher 
program. If passed in the Senate, 
the $150 billion bill would be the 
single most largest investment in 
affordable housing in history.
Dan Kelly, executive direc-
tor of the Shelter Association of 
Washtenaw County, also encour-
aged the Ann Arbor City Coun-
cil to allocate more American 
Rescue Plan Act funds towards 

affordable housing. The Biden 
Administration passed the ARPA 
in March to help local govern-
ments, municipalities and citi-
zens recover from the pandemic. 
Washtenaw County was awarded 
more than $71 million to be grant-
ed in two equal allotments: first in 
May 2021 and then in May 2022. 
“We want to see as much of 
(the funding) go towards afford-
able housing and supports like 
the shelter as possible,” Kelly 
said. “That way we can have more 
incredible stories, more housing 
right down there, over there, over 
there, all over downtown and 
throughout the county of course. 
Thank you, thank you, thank you 
for coming out showing your sup-
port. Let’s just keep this mission 
going and end homelessness here 
in Washtenaw County.”
The group then began march-
ing down South Division St., 
chanting “Housing is human 
right” and “Affordable housing for 
all.” As the group made their way 
through the Ann Arbor Farmers 
Market and into nearby neighbor-
hoods, a few cars drove by honked 
in support. The Ann Arbor Police 
Department also followed along, 
blocking the streets from oncom-
ing traffic. 
Rackham student Matt Dar-
gay, a Masters student in the Uni-
versity of Michigan Social Work 
program, told The Michigan 
Daily he hopes the city prioritizes 
affordable housing and gets rid 
of exclusive zoning restrictions, 
which place limitations on the 
types of homes that can be built in 
a particular neighborhood. 
“We’re here today because we 
want to show support for housing 
policies and the funding of afford-
able housing in the area because 
it’s getting more and more expen-
sive to live here,” Dargay said. “If 
we’re going to sustain housing for 
essential workers and working-
class people, then we need to pro-

vide more affordable housing. So 
we’re here to show our support 
for that.”
Ann Arbor resident Shirley 
Wolfe, who has been living in the 
city since she graduated from the 
University in the 1950s, came to 
the protest with fellow Ann Arbor 
resident Phil Carroll. Despite the 
cold, Wolfe said she came out to 
rally for the people in the city who 
have to deal with this weather day 
in and day out.
“We’re both of an age — I’m 
in my 90th year, and (Carroll is) 
almost in his 80th,” Wolfe said. 
“(But) anything to promote more 
concern to let people know that 
we have a huge number of home-
less in Ann Arbor right now, and 
we have a lot of people your age 
and even families living in cars. 
It’s really cold.”
Carroll said he hopes the City 
considers implementing a rent 
control ordinance to curb afford-
able housing issues. A similar 
proposal was brought to Ann 
Arbor in the 1980s, but the state of 
Michigan enacted legislation that 
prohibited this proposal.
“We will never have afford-
able housing in Ann Arbor as 
long as we let the developers 
dominate our City Council,” Car-
roll said. “We need a rent control 
ordinance, and people should be 
aware that there’s a lot of senti-
ment that would favor that.”
Some members of Ann Arbor 
City Council were also in atten-
dance, including council mem-
bers Kathy Griswold, D-Ward 2, 
and Elizabeth Nelson, D-Ward 4. 
Griswold said she is in prelimi-
nary discussions with the Uni-
versity to implement additional 
housing for individuals in the 
workforce who might not be able 
to afford living in the city and 
must commute everyday to work.

LILA TURNER/Daily
Ann Arbor residents gathered to advocate for those unhoused in Washtenaw County on Nov. 20. 

About 60 students gathered the 
 
night of Nov. 19 outside University of 
Michigan President Mark Schlissel’s 
house to demonstrate their solidarity 
with victims of former athletic doctor 
Robert Anderson as part of a rally 
organized by Black UMich. Black 
UMich, a student-run organization 
on campus dedicated to amplifying 
the voices of Black people at the 
University, called on the University to 
address the demands of victims and 
have a formal conversation about the 
culture of sexual assault on campus.
The event consisted of speakers, 
chants expressing solidarity with 
the victims and a demonstration of 
“Black joy,” an act of resistance and 
expression of Black culture. Music by 
Black artists played, and protestors 
danced and sang together. Students 
chanted, “No justice, no peace. Let 
John speak,” “Black students won’t 
be silenced,” “Hail to the victims” 
and “Black students are under attack. 
What do we do? Stand up, fight back!” 
Jon Vaughn and other survivors 
of Anderson have been camping 
outside of Schlissel’s house since Oct. 
8 in protest against the University’s 
handling of the nearly 1,000 sexual 
assault allegations against Anderson.
Vaughn spoke at the event, telling 
his story in addition to the history of 
sexual abuse at the University. When 
Vaughn was recruited to play football 
for the Wolverines, he said he was told 
that the University would prioritize 
his health and wellbeing.
“I think back to how these men 
came into my living room when my 
mother was dying, and (they) promised 
her that (they) were protecting me 
and I’d have the best medical care,” 
Vaughn said. “Obviously, that was all 
a lie.”
Vaughn explained the actions 
taken by the University immediately 
after Tad DeLuca, a former U-M 
wrestler, filed a formal complaint 
about Anderson in 1975. DeLuca, 
who is the first person known to have 
reported Anderson to the University, 
had his scholarship and financial 
aid revoked and was removed from 
the wrestling team after reporting 
Anderson’s abuse. 
After DeLuca reported Anderson’s 
abuse to the University, the Division 
of Public Safety and Security began 
an investigation. The University later 
hired the law firm Steptoe & Johnson 
to do a formal investigation, but 
switched to WilmerHale in March 
2020 due to Steptoe & Johnson’s 
previous defense of Jeffrey Epstein 
and director Roman Polanski.
“At that point, I knew that we would 
never be treated as human beings, 
let alone respected as former student 
athletes,” Vaughn said. “When I was 
recruited here, you celebrated me, 
but now I’m a villain, and that’s how 
they’ve been treating us ever since.”
The 
University 
has 
denied 
knowingly hiring attorneys from 
the same law firm that represented 
Epstein and Polanski.
Vaughn said conversations with 
current U-M students, who he said 
continue to experience a culture of 
sexual violence on campus on a daily 
basis, have been powerful.
“On the second day I was here, a 
young lady said to me, ‘you know, I 
think about when’s the next time I’m 
going to be raped or sexually assaulted 
on this campus more than I do what is 
going to be my major,’” Vaughn said. 
“And at that point … I realized this is 
worse than I thought. It’s not only 
that they treat us inhumanely, they’re 
treating the students inhumanely. 
Students’ safety is not a priority here.”
In an interview with The Michigan 
Daily, Business senior and student 
athlete Job Mayhue said he wants the 
public to know about what happened 
to survivors of Anderson and hopes 
transparency will prevent abuse in the 
future.
“I want this event to lead to open and 
transparent conversations and culture 
to have difficult conversations about 
sexual violence,” Mayhue said. “I also 
want the University to do more about 
creating a safer campus and create a 
system where action is being taken 
every single time somebody reports 
and it’s not just swept under the rug.”
Mayhue also said the University’s 
lack of cooperation with the survivors, 
as well as their reluctance to talk 
directly to survivors and provide any 
sort of compensation for them, further 
disincentives students from sharing 

their stories.
“They keep asking him (Jon 
Vaughn), ‘What can we do to get you 
off of our space?” Mayhue said. “It’s 
not, ‘What can we do to help?” It’s 
not, ‘What can we do to make a safer 
campus?’ It’s, ‘What can we do to 
hush you up and get you going on your 
way?’”
LSA junior Zach Briggs also said the 
lack of action and accountability from 
the University regarding the current 
U-M assistant athletic director, Paul 
Schmidt, who was allegedly aware 
of Anderson’s behavior, has been 
disappointing.
“Across every college campus 
in America, there’s massive sexual 
assault scandals or mishandling of 
sexual assault reporting,” Briggs said. 
“I definitely think there should be 
some form of justice with the firing 
of Dr. Schmidt, and I feel as though 
anyone who has covered it up needs to 
be reprimanded.”
In 
mid-November, 
Vaughn 
announced his plan to run for the 
Board of Regents in 2022. During the 
rally, Vaughn said he was running 
because of the stories he hears from 
students about safety and sexual 
assault on campus. He also called out 
Schlissel directly.
“I watch a man go to work almost 
every day, and I’ve never seen him 
interact with any student or professor, 
in now 42 days, and I just find that 
that’s an atrocity,” Vaughn said. “It 
really shows where the focus of the 
leadership is in this University. It’s 
all on money, sponsors, donors, even 
donors who let young men into school 
that have Title IX rapes in their 
history.”
Mayhue said during the rally that 
Black representation in the Board of 
Regents is essential to making progress.
“I’m so thankful that you are going 
for the Board of Regents, because 
putting a Black man in a position 
of leadership is the first step in 
making tangible change for the Black 
community and making it a safe space 
on campus,” Mayhue said to Vaughn.
Regent Katherine White (D) is 
currently the only Black regent on the 
eight-member board. Vaughn said that 
the marginalization of Black people 
at U-M and the ways in which the 
University has suppressed the voices 
of the Black community has been a 
historic problem.
“I might be a student athlete and I 
might be a victim of Dr. Anderson, but 
I’m a Black man, and that’s something 
I can never not be,” Vaughn said. 
“I’m ready to fight for not only the 
University, but I’m also here to fight 
for my people.”
Following the speakers, Rackham 
student Byron Brooks recited a poem 
he wrote in light of the University’s 
handling of the allegations.
“How can an institution of higher 
education hire, protect, and admit 
known rapists?” Brooks read. “I bet if 
Anderson was Black, he would have 
been thrown into prison and the story 
would’ve been known throughout the 
nation. Hail to the victims, yet as their 
voices were silenced, checks were still 
cleared and retirement was granted. 
The President right now won’t even 
come out of his house as if he’s on a 
vacation. That should be enough to let 
you know that the rapist at hand was 
a privileged Caucasian. Hail to the 
victims.”
In an interview with The Daily, 
Brooks said he stood in solidarity with 
the survivors.
“For this issue to have gone on 
for decades and generations is truly 
saddening,” Brooks said. “Although 
I was not a victim, I feel like it is 
my duty to stand with the victims, 
because it takes that solidarity to make 
something happen.”
Brooks said he is disheartened 
by the lack of action taken by the 
University and hopes that they will 
be more focused on the wellbeing of 
the survivors and all students moving 
forward.
“Honestly, I’m tired,” Brooks said. 
“I feel like the school is looking at 
it from a marketing and PR (public 
relations) perspective. I’m looking 
for actual equitable actions. And not 
only that, but a true apology, authentic 
apology, and extra steps that will help. 
We are at an institution of learning. 
We are here to learn. A lot of these 
athletes, they put their bodies on the 
line for this institution, so they deserve 
some form of equitable reparations.”

Around 50 students gathered 
on the Diag the afternoon of Nov. 
19, with some walking out of their 
classes, to demand the University 
of Michigan expand its policies 
for climate change mitigation and 
sexual misconduct prevention and 
take responsibility for its actions.
The 
strike 
was 
organized 
by 
Fridays 
for 
Future, 
an 
environmental organization that 
leads climate strikes around the 
world, as well as Roe v. Rape, a 
campus 
nonprofit 
organization 
supporting 
sexual 
misconduct 
prevention and survivor advocacy 
efforts. 
Fridays 
for 
Future 
previously organized a climate 
strike on Oct. 22.
The 
event 
was 
a 
distinct 
collaboration between the two 
separate causes organized around 
calling for broader transparency and 
accountability from the University’s 
administration. Over the past few 
years, climate activists and sexual 
assault prevention advocates have 
pushed the University to commit 
to limiting its carbon emissions and 
reforming how it handles cases of 
sexual misconduct committed by 
faculty and administrators.
Some students walked out of 
classes to support the event. LSA 
Junior Jesse Bishop, member of 
the advocacy group Students for 
Clean Energy, left his class to 
attend the strike. Bishop said he 
came out for the strike to hold 
the University accountable for its 
handling of climate change and 
sexual misconduct policies, which 
he believes are inadequate.
“It’s not enough at all, it’s not 
even near enough,” Bishop said. 
It’s (the University’s) responsibility 
to protect their students from the 
climate and sexual assaults…it’s not 
a business and they’re treating it 
like a business.”
Jon Vaughn, a survivor of 
Robert 
Anderson 
and 
former 
University football player who has 
been protesting outside University 
President Mark Schlissel’s home on 

South University Avenue, was set to 
speak at the strike, but organizers 
said a last-minute change meant 
Vaughn was unable to attend the 
event. Vaughn recently announced 
that he plans to run for a seat on the 
Board of Regents in 2022
LSA sophomore Jacob Sendra, 
an organizer with Fridays for 
Future, criticized the University for 
taking insufficient action to address 
the climate crisis. 
“When it comes to climate policy, 
the University of Michigan drapes 
itself with the language and imagery 
of decisive action … while actively 
profiting from the destruction of 
our futures,” Sendra said. “It’s time 
to demand accountability.”
Sendra highlighted the group’s 
demands for the University to 
follow the City of Ann Arbor’s 
A2Zero initiative to achieve carbon 
neutrality by 2030 and to divest its 
endowed funds from natural gas 
investments.
In May, University President 
Mark Schlissel and the Board of 
Regents committed the University 
to achieving full carbon neutrality by 
2040 across all scopes of emissions. 
The commitment followed after 
significant student and community 
activism, but activists point to data 
from the Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change and argue the 
University’s plan does not limit 
emissions fast enough to prevent 
the worst effects of climate change.
In 
March, 
the 
University 
also 
committed 
to 
disinvest 
the endowment from fossil fuel 
investments and have a net-
zero-emissions 
endowment 
by 
2050. Activists have urged the 
administration 
to 
go 
further 
and also divest from natural gas 
companies.
LSA sophomore Lexi Crilley said 
she appreciated the University’s 
revised endowment policies but said 
the University had an obligation to 
go further.
“We are grateful that the 
University of Michigan has agreed 
to divest from coal and oil, but what 
about natural gas?” Crilley said. 
“And again, 2050 is way too far 
away. We need to emphasize that 

it’s not enough action.”
Multiple 
survivor 
advocates 
then began to speak, reproaching 
the University for how they’ve 
handled allegations of misconduct 
against administrators and faculty 
and encouraged the administration 
to better protect students.
Public Policy senior Emma 
Sandberg, executive director of 
Roe v. Rape, has been advocating 
for survivors of sexual assault 
since her freshman year. Sandberg 
criticized the University for a lack 
of support for survivors and for not 
doing enough to punish those who 
commit misconduct.
“We are not the Leaders and 
Best if our policies are designed 
to deter students from reporting 
and let perpetrators off the hook,” 
Sandberg said. “Whether you’ve 
been working on this from the 
beginning or whether you are just 
hearing about these issues today, 
it is up to everyone listening, not 
just survivors and allies, to keep 
fighting until all of our demands 
are met.”
Advocates pointed out multiple 
prominent 
University 
officials 
who committed misconduct while 
serving at the University, including 
former Provost Martin Philbert and 
former University Health Service 
director and team doctor Robert 
Anderson. They also highlighted 
the recent instance at the Ford 
School of Public Policy, in which 
students protested the decision 
to admit a master’s student who 
was guilty of Title IX violations at 
their previous school.
Among 
the 
advocates’ 
list 
of demands was a rule that the 
University would not admit anyone 
who previously committed sexual 
misconduct, as well as provide 
expanded support and outreach 
resources for survivors of assault.
In 
July, 
the 
University 
restructured 
the 
Office 
of 
Institutional Equity into the Equity, 
Civil Rights and Title IX Office 
to enhance its handling of sexual 
misconduct and provide support for 
those who file complaints through 
the office. The announcement 
came with multiple reforms meant 
to address the culture around 
reporting 
and 
prevent 
future 
instances of misconduct.
In an interview with The Daily, 
Sandberg recognized the actions 
the University had taken but 
said activists needed to push the 
administration to go further in 
supporting survivors.
“Currently, 
survivors 
lack 
so many resources on campus,” 
Sandberg said. “We want to see 
new centers (for support) created, 
and that’s something that without 
further action, I don’t see the 
University choosing to do that 
themselves.”
The University’s Office of Public 
Affairs did not respond to requests 
for comment at the time of this 
article’s publication. 
After multiple environmental 
activists and survivor advocates 
spoke, organizers led the crowd off 
the Diag, southbound on State St. 
and eastbound on South University 
Ave.. 
The 
protesters 
chanted 
phrases demanding action from 
the University, including “Support 
survivors, Schlissel must go” and 
“Climate change is a war of the rich 
against the poor.”

CAMPUS LIFE

Students walk out for climate, 
sexual misconduct accountability

Event called for broader transparency, action from ‘U’ administration

With COVID-19 cases on the rise 
and flu season in full effect, sickness 
has recently become the norm on 
campus. In yet another semester 
defined by the pandemic, students 
told The Michigan Daily they find 
themselves asking instructors for 
accommodations more than ever 
before. 
LSA freshman Allen Shen, who 
lives in a residence hall, said he 
noticed many students feeling burnt 
out or sick over the past few weeks.
“Everyone around me has been 
sick here and there — my friend got 
the flu last week, but he was perfectly 
fine,” Shen said. “Other people have 
been really, really sick, especially in 
the dorms.”
Shen said he was no exception to 
this campus-wide trend, as he fell 
sick with pneumonia early on in the 
semester and experienced symptoms 
that lingered through September.
“Since two or three days after I 
moved in, I started getting a sore 
throat and then got progressively 
worse over time,” Shen said. “I was 
probably sick for a good month, but 
not deathly sick.”
During midterm season, Shen 
said he realized his workload was 
becoming too much to handle on 
top of managing his pneumonia 
symptoms. With three exams in 
a single week, Shen said he felt 
especially burnt out. He explained 
his situation to his MATH 215 
instructor 
Mattias 
Jonsson, 
professor of mathematics, who then 
let him opt out of his midterm.
“(My 
professor) 
was 
really 
understanding and just asked for a 
doctor’s note,” Shen said. “He said I 
could skip the first midterm, and the 
next two would be weighted heavier 
to accommodate me missing the first 
one.”
In an email to The Daily, 
Jonsson reiterated the course’s 
accommodation 
policy, 
citing 
alternative ways to make up for 
missed exams.
“In MATH 215, there are two 
midterm exams and a final exam, 
along with a good deal of homework,” 
Jonsson said. “For students who miss 
one of the midterm exams for illness, 
the general policy has been not to 
count that midterm and instead 
reweight the other midterm and 

final exam.”
Accommodations 
generally 
depend on department or course 
policies. Some instructors have 
incorporated different ways for 
students to make up or drop 
assignments when they feel sick. 
After testing positive for COVID-19 
during midterm season, Engineering 
junior Izzy Ferranti said one of her 
instructors offered a virtual option 
to take her typically in-person quiz.
“I 
received 
an 
exam 
accommodation for CHEM 342, 
which was held online the same day 
as the regularly scheduled quiz,” 
Ferranti said. “I thought having it the 
same day was difficult because it was 
shortly after I developed symptoms, 
so I still wasn’t feeling well.”
Ferranti said her CHEM 342 
professor was willing to push her 
quiz back several days to allow for a 
recovery period.
“I was able to take (my quiz) on 
campus when I was released from 
quarantine, about four days after the 
regularly scheduled quiz,” Ferranti 
said. “This was helpful because I was 
able to ask questions in person, and 
I didn’t have the stress of taking it 
online.”
While 
Ferranti 
said 
the 
accommodations 
she 
received 
helped alleviate some stress, LSA 
senior Aratrika Ganguli said she 
wished the Economics Department 
had taken a similar approach. After 
testing 
positive 
for 
COVID-19 
several days before her ECON 431 
midterm, Ganguli said she emailed 
her professor asking to take the exam 
virtually or at a later date only to find 
that there was no alternative to the 
in-person exam, as per department 
policy.
“When (my professor and I) were 
conversing through email, she let me 
know that there are just no options 
for those who are sick,” Ganguli said. 
“We would just make you not take 
this exam, which would mean that 
my final exam is worth 60% of my 
entire grade.”
Ganguli said this accommodation 
only 
exacerbated 
her 
stress, 
especially when thinking about 
how much more she would need to 
prepare for her future exam.
“Now, I feel like any free time I 
have, I need to be studying for my 
final because I know that whatever 
grade I get on that final is literally 
my grade for the class,” Ganguli said. 
“That’s very stressful for a student 

who did not even expect to get sick.”
The Economics Department did 
not respond to The Daily when asked 
to comment on its accommodation 
policy.
Despite her frustration with the 
Economics 
Department’s 
policy, 
Ganguli said all of her professors 
were understanding of her situation 
and reminded her to focus on her 
mental and physical health during 
quarantine.
“I was very happy to see my 
professors’ reactions … they all told 
me to prioritize my health and stop 
worrying about everything else,” 
Ganguli said. “But the only thing 
that’s going through my head as a 
senior is my grade and what’s going 
to happen if I can’t attend this class.”
While 
attending 
classes 
asynchronously prevented her from 
falling far behind on coursework, 
Ganguli said she spent most of her 
free time in quarantine catching up 
on lecture content instead of fully 
recovering.
“Because I had a lot of time during 
quarantine, I felt as though I was just 
doing homework the entire time,” 
Ganguli said. “There wasn’t a lot of 
free time to walk around, breathe 
and take care of my own health.”
When Ferranti began attending 
in-person classes again, she said 
she felt mostly caught up with 
classwork because she could attend 
lectures asynchronously during her 
quarantine period.
“When 
I 
returned 
to 
the 
classroom, I did not feel like I 
fell behind on coursework due to 
asynchronous lectures,” Ferranti 
said. “The only setback I experienced 
was 
missing 
my 
CHEM 
342 
discussion, which is helpful for 
solving homework problems.”
The amount of time Ganguli 
dedicated to her courses during 
quarantine and the additional stress 
of heavily-weighted exams are both 
indicative of some of the struggles 
students continue to face this 
semester.
“It was definitely tough to balance 
taking care of your own health and 
making sure you’re on top of things,” 
Ganguli said. “So, it really sucks to see 
that you’re at a disadvantage in terms 
of your education because of the fact 
that you unexpectedly got sick.”

UMich child care workers 
allege unfair compensation

ADMINISTRATION

Employees say low salary doesn’t reflect job’s demands amid pandemic

The educators at the University 
of 
Michigan 
Children’s 
Centers 
are responsible for teaching and 
socializing the youngest victors on 
campus. After more than a year of 
working as critical employees during 
a pandemic, U-M child care center 
teachers are now demanding higher 
salaries, saying their wages do not 
reflect the demands of their job.

The problem 
The average salary of a teacher at 
the U-M centers is $38,588, far below 
the base salary of an Ann Arbor Public 
Schools teacher at $43,906✎ EditSign.
The Daily spoke to two teachers 
from the U-M child care centers, 
both of whom wished to remain 
anonymous for fear of professional 
retaliation. For the purposes of this 
article, they will be referred to as 
Source 1 and Source 2. 
Source 1 has a bachelor’s degree 
in early education and works in the 
early preschool department. They 
said their main frustration with the 
situation is their compensation not 
being reflective of their role as an 
educator. 
“We’re working on a 12-month 
schedule, 
and 
we’re 
being 
compensated for less than what 
nine-month teachers are putting 
out,” Source 1 said. “With the same 
qualifications and the same level of 
education and the same interactions 
with young people and children.” 
Source 1 said as a research 
university, the University should 
be better able to recognize the 

importance of their work, which has 
been proven to have lasting, positive 
impacts on a child’s development. 
“We’re building the foundation for 
the educational future of our tiniest 
victors here at the University,” Source 
1 said. “And they don’t want to pay 
the teachers, who are on the front 
lines with their children, a living 
wage.” Source 2, a lead teacher who 
supervises the U-M child care center 
workers, highlighted another issue: 
retention. The lack of compensation 
does not encourage new teachers to 
be interested in the program in a time 
when new teachers are desperately 
needed, they said.
“I think if I was being paid more 
and I could’ve paid for child care for 
my children, it would’ve been a better 
situation for my children and me 
because teaching my children was not 
a good experience,” Source 2 said.
Jennie McAlpine, senior director 
of Work-Life Programs at the 
University’s 
Work-Life 
Resource 
Center, wrote in an email to The Daily 
that because of low compensation, 
Ann Arbor and Washtenaw County 
are 
experiencing 
an 
educator 
shortage.
“It is hard for staff to stay in a 
chronically 
undercompensated, 
demanding 
job 
and 
care 
for 
themselves 
and 
their 
families,” 
McAlpine wrote. 

Working during a pandemic 
Source 1 also said these teachers 
were called back to work in-person 
by the University amid the COVID-
19 pandemic, long before the vaccines 
were readily available. 
“We’re needed by the University 
and they showed that by having 
us continue to work through the 

pandemic while a lot of the families 
were working from the comfort of 
their homes at the time,” Source 1 said. 
“But we’re not being compensated for 
being critical staff.” 
Though children ages 5-11 just 
became eligible to receive their 
COVID-19 vaccines as of Nov. 10, 
children under five are still not 
eligible for vaccination. As a result, 
teachers have been working with an 
unvaccinated 
population, 
putting 
themselves at risk of being exposed to 
COVID-19. 
With low vaccination rates in K-12 
schools as well as a staff shortage, Ann 
Arbor has seen many school closures 
this fall due to low staff numbers. 
Source 2 said child care workers 
are in even more of a dire situation 
than others considering that they 
teach children who are often sick.
“Since we work with children, we 
get sick often,” Source 2 said. “If you 
have sick symptoms, you can’t come 
to work because you have to get tested 
and have your test results before you 
can come back, even if it’s just a cold. 
We’re always understaffed and that’s 
stretching teachers.” 
According to McAlpine, 90% of 
the Work-Life Resource Center’s 
funding comes directly from tuition, 
while 10% comes directly from the 
University. This, according to Source 
1, is a large part of the problem. 
“The University expects the child 
care centers to pay for themselves, 
which in turn raises tuition costs, 
which is a burden to families and it 
doesn’t allow for the teachers in our 
programs to make a living wage,” 
Source 1 said.

“Good morning, everyone, and 
welcome back to yet another round 
of Bones or No Bones: the game 
where we find out if my 13-year-old 
pug woke up with bones, and, as a 
result, we’ll find out what kind of 
day we’re going to have.” 
This is how Jonathan Graziano 
opens almost every one of his Tik-
Tok videos featuring his adorable 
pug, Noodle. For over a year now, 
Graziano has made jokes about 
Noodle having “no bones,” flopping 
back down on his bed every time he 
has to get up to go for a walk or use 
the bathroom. In the last couple of 
months, Graziano has begun post-
ing daily “readings,” in which Noo-
dle’s having bones (or lack thereof) 
determines how our day will go 
as well. “It’s kind of like reading 
tea leaves,” he says in one video. A 
“bones day” is a sign of good luck, 
and we’re supposed to treat our-
selves 
and go after the 
things we want. A 
“no bones day” is 
not necessarily a 
bad thing, though. 
Graziano 
rec-
ommends we 
use the day for 
self-care, and 
just take it easy. 
For those of us lucky 
enough to have these 
little videos cross our 
“For You” pages, Noo-
dle has quickly grown 
into a cul-
tural 
phe-
nom-
enon. 
Graziano 
currently 
has 4.5 
million 
followers on Tik-

Tok, and #Bones and #NoBones 
have hundreds of millions of views 
as well. Creators are writing songs 
about Noodle, designing “bones 
day” animations and 3D-printing 
wallet-sized displays to help keep 
track of each day’s reading. Noo-
dle’s fame is not limited to TikTok, 
as he and Graziano have made 
appearances on several talk shows 
and most notably, Noodle 
was canceled by Rolling 
Stone. There’s merchan-
dise available just about 
everywhere, and teachers 
are even incorporating the 
lingo into their classrooms. I’ve 
heard stories of students in class 
crowding around someone’s phone 
to watch the daily reading once it’s 
been posted. 
So why does it concern me to see 
some people taking these forecasts a 
little too seriously?
Sometimes the videos under the 
Bones/No Bones hashtags are clear-
ly just meant to be funny, but other 
creators seem to be basing their day 
on whether an old dog stands up or 
not.
This isn’t the first time that the 
general public has taken the “advice” 
of an animal. We 
have an entire 
holiday built 
around 
it. 
Instead 
of 
controlling 
the 
weather, 
Noodle con-

trols people’s moods and energy, 
like a version of spoon theory for 
Gen Z. Why do we feel like we need 
an excuse to have a good day, or to 
take it easy?
If I had to guess, I’d say this is one 
of the ways we’re coping post-pan-
demic. Most of us are back in person 
now, whether it’s for school or for 
work. Having spent the last year and 
a half adjusting to 

isolation, I’ve found it’s an equal-
ly big adjustment to leave. Being 
expected to return to our normal 
workload is exhausting, and some 
of us still need a break but don’t feel 
like we’re allowed to take it. Noodle 
is our current solution to this prob-
lem, providing us with either the 
justification for taking that break 
or motivation to keep going. As one 
creator put it, “The entire world is 
revolving around Noodle right now, 
and we are okay with that because 
he came to us in a time of need.” 
There’s no telling how much longer 
Noodle’s fame will last, but for 
now, he’s helping us feel 
better — and looking 
cute while doing it.

The cultural impact of Noodle the Pug

HANNAH CARAPELLOTTI

After 
a 
successful 
four-show 
run, the cast and crew of MUSKET 
wrapped up their production of the 
Broadway hit “Funny Girl” last Sun-
day at the Power Center. Audiences 
watched leading lady Fanny Brice, 
played by Music, Theatre & Dance 
sophomore Carly Meyer, go from a 
determined dreamer to a star whose 
attention every character longs for. 
Inspired by the real life of Fanny Brice, 
the musical follows the actress’s rise to 
fame and the effects fame had on her 
life off the stage. 
The show began with quite the 
entrance from Fanny. Walking from 
behind the audience, she made her 
way through the aisles to take her place 
at center stage. Shortly after, the first 
of many exclamations Fanny would 
make was a memorable one: “I’m a 
bagel on a plate full of onion rolls!” 
She admitted that she’s not like oth-
ers, but used this fact to advocate for 
herself, reminding the audience that 
what’s more important than surface 
appearance is self-advocacy. As she 
declared herself “The Greatest Star” 
in one of the musical’s most iconic 

numbers, other characters began to 
acknowledge her stardom as well.
While Fanny achieved fame, she 
was quickly consumed by it, and those 
close to her worried about its effects. 
When Fanny entered a long and com-
plicated relationship with the char-
ismatic socialite and swindler Nicky 
Arnstein, played by LSA sophomore 
Sohil Apte, the two sang a series of 
songs that depicted their struggle to 
find their identities apart from each 
other. By the end, Fanny found clarity 
back on the stage, with a triumphant 
reprise of the iconic tune “Don’t Rain 
on My Parade.” 
Storyline aside, serving as the base 
for the musical’s progression was the 
21-piece orchestra led by Andrew 
Gerace — the Music Director and LSA 
and Music, Theatre & Dance senior — 
seen swaying along to the music as he 
conducted. One of the musical’s most 
exuberant moments was the number 
“Cornet Man,” with trumpeter Ryan 
Venora, a Music, Theatre & Dance 
junior, onstage interacting with Fanny. 
Blasting like a big band, the pit orches-
tra showcased full energy as Fanny 
imitated the trumpet sounds above. 
Another show highlight came 
about midway through the first act 
with the number “His Love Makes 

Me Beautiful” — a scene that brought 
in stunning solos by Meyer and Music, 
Theatre & Dance sophomore Alex-
andra Humphreys. When Meyer 
struggled comically up a set of stairs 
— a possible nod to the stairs in the 
1968 film with Barbra Streisand — as a 
pregnant bride, her interactions with 
an appalled Humphreys were price-
less. 
As the bridal scene came to an end, 
figures in black swiftly wheeled the 
stairs offstage, bringing in simple pan-
els to transition into Fanny’s dress-
ing room. These stagehands were a 
reminder of yet another team driving 
the production forward. The mecha-
nism of actors onstage, musicians in 
the pit and stagehands worked like 
clockwork on the Power Center stage. 
With only a two-and-a-half-hour run-
ning time and a relentlessly moving 
orchestra below the stage, MUSKET’s 
production staff, completely student-
run, made a lasting impression, allow-
ing the cast to shine. 
“Funny Girl” marked MUSKET’s 
much-anticipated return to the Power 
Center since halting live shows in 
March of last year. While the theatre 
group had kept itself busy at the height 
of the pandemic with well-produced 
virtual stagings of “Bright Star” and 

“Newsies,” viewers last weekend laid 
witness to a full range of expression 
from an unmasked, in-person cast, 
with ample distance between stage 
and audience. 

In the words of MUSKET’s 
Music, Theatre & Dance senior Jonas 
McMullen, whose Director’s Note 
graces the playbill: “We are reminded 
why we love to gather in the theatre, 

when we could not for so long.” After 
all the time that has passed, the cel-
ebratory nature of MUSKET’s return 
seemed to make their year-long hiatus 
well worth the wait.

MUSKET returns to the Power Center for a weekend of “Funny Girl”

I bet you can think of a song from 
which you can never detach a spe-
cific memory. The kind where, every 
time it comes on, the place you’re 
currently in blurs, and you’re sud-
denly in another space, in another 
time. For me, books have the capac-
ity to bottle up feelings. “Bloom” by 
The Paper Kites will forever remind 
me of the novel “The Light Between 
Oceans,” and “Jolene” by Ray 
LaMontagne is the faint sound that 
accompanies any flashback I get to 
the novel “A Little Life.”
The greatest memory-keepers, 
however, are walks. More specifical-
ly, what I like to call ‘thought walks,’ 
the ones you take when thoughts 
become so loud that you feel like 
you need to drown them out with 
a tune that is ten decibels too loud. 
As much of a coping mechanism as 
it is, music can also be a catalyst, 
an absinthe that makes a specific 
moment in time become ingrained 
in your memory forever. 
Let me tell you about my favor-
ite place in Ann Arbor for those 

“thought 
walks”: 
the 
Pioneer 
Woods. It wasn’t until late in my 
time in Ann Arbor that I found it, 
and I’m bitter I didn’t find it earlier. 
You probably wouldn’t believe me if 
I told you the closest road to it was 
W. Stadium Boulevard (in my opin-
ion, the noisiest and least appealing 
road in Ann Arbor). 
It is the place where industrial 
life mingles with nature. There are 
various entrances to the woods, so 
many that I am pretty sure I have 
yet to discover new ones. Typi-
cally, I make my way toward the 
small, almost rabbit-hole paths off 
the side of W. Stadium Boulevard. 
Like entering Narnia, you go from 
being surrounded by street signs to 
tall trees that drown out the hum of 
city life. The woods are not big — it 
takes less than ten minutes to cross 
through them — but it’s a magical 
place where oaks, white pines and 
shagbark hickories engulf you, the 
leaves below your feet crunching 
with every step you take.
At the end of the woods, an 
arched tunnel created by bent 
branches leads you into a vast open 
space called the Greenview Nature 
Area. In the fall season, the meadow 

grows untamed, and in the spring, 
the weeds turn into colorful wild-
flowers that become the home of 55 
different kinds of butterflies. A few 

yards away is a little pond, seem-
ingly so forgotten and untouched 
that you could imagine the water 
has been the same since the begin-
ning of time.
The first day I set foot in this 
place was probably one of the most 
cathartic days of my life. I experi-
enced nature as one experiences 

the first snowfall or the first dip in 
the ocean after a cold winter. It felt 
pure, so much so that I felt like I was 
trespassing. Yet at the same time, I 

was welcomed, embraced by the tall 
weeds, calmed down by the sound 
they made as the wind brushed 
them from side to side. 
I sat down on one of the three logs 
at the top of the meadows, and here 
is where catharsis occurred. “One 
Sunday Morning (Song for Jane 
Smiley’s Boyfriend)” by Wilco start-

ed playing, and suddenly, breathing 
felt like a harder task than it usually 
is. I am not a crier, I never have been, 
but in that moment, a tear rushed 
down my cheek. They weren’t tears 
of joy, but they weren’t tears of sad-
ness, either. I think it was my body’s 
way of telling me it was at peace. 
“Outside I looked lived in” was 
whispered in my ear as I took every-
thing in. Those twelve melodic 
minutes glued every detail in the 
scenery to the twists and turns of 
the phrases, the piano motifs and 
the painfully honest lyrics. I had 
felt like this before, but it’s not often 
that a song and a landscape leave 
you gasping for air. I don’t mean to 
sound melodramatic, exaggerated 
or even absurd, but I really mean it. 
A song, “One Sunday Morning,” and 
a landscape, the Pioneer Woods, had 
caused a perfect chemical reaction 
— liberation pickled with sadness. 
Not out of grief, but by the mere fact 
that I couldn’t live in that moment 
forever. 
I knew I could still go back to 
the Pioneer Woods whenever, but it 
just wouldn’t be the same. Life isn’t 
static. It’s ever-changing, and I am 
a different person every time I go 

back — even if only two days go by 
between visits. But for twelve min-
utes, despite what I may be going 
through, despite the weather or the 
season or the reason for my escape, 
the warm tenderness that I bottled 
up one afternoon in May becomes 
present. I cannot come to these 
woods and not listen to “One Sun-
day Morning.” I make it a ceremony, 
actually, a ritual to see how this song 
morphs as I myself morph — reading 
between the lines and seeing details 
of the landscape I hadn’t seen before. 
It’s all part of a continuous narrative, 
one which parts me from the accep-
tance that that tenderness will never 
be as strong as the first day I encoun-
tered this safe haven.
Songs being memory boxes is a 
universal phenomenon, I think, or 
at least I hope it is. So I reveal my 
secret, my little treasure — it would 
be selfish not to. I think everyone 
should know this feeling of release 
through alignment. So go out to the 
Pioneer Woods and allow yourself to 
feel, whatever that means. 
The Wilco prayer said it first: 
“Something sad keeps moving, so I 
wandered around. I fell in love with 
the burden, holding me down.”

I can’t in good faith say that I’m a Swiftie. 
I’m a Swiftie in the sense that we all are Swifties 
— because you can’t avoid her. Her music has 
defined a generation, whether you like it or not. 
Even if I don’t buy tickets to Taylor’s shows, it’s 
still a Swift-dominated world, and I still reap 
the benefits of breakup songs. Everybody loves 
her femcel anthem, and I literally go crazy any 
time any of her singles play at a party. Part of 
the reason people joke about her being a crazy 
girlfriend with a self-described long list of 
ex-lovers is that she’s so lovable that we wish we 
could hate her, like our ex-boyfriend’s newest 
lover. She, like her Cool Girl contemporaries 
Jennifer Lawrence and Anne Hathaway (who 
supposedly has her own connection to “All Too 
Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor’s Version) 
(From the Vault)”), is just a beautiful, talented 
woman who seems a little too good to be true, 
and we tend to be distrustful of that. Maybe 
my lowered expectation of her is why I actually 
kind of love this short film.

If you haven’t heard yet, Taylor Swift and 
Jake Gyllenhaal (“Nightcrawler”) dated for 
three months when she was 20 and he was 29. 
While nine years might not be as egregious as 
the infamous age gaps in Bradley Cooper and 
Leonardo Dicaprio’s relationships, there was 
a massive gap in experience. She had only just 
released her first album a few years before, and 
Gyllenhaal been in the public eye since he was 
a child. Looking back at those paparazzi shots 
of the two of them, you can’t help but see how 
different Swift looks.
The greatest directorial choice Swift made 
for “All Too Well: The Short Film” was in her 
casting. Dylan O’Brien (“Teen Wolf”) plays 
Him and Sadie Sink (“Stranger Things”) plays 
Her; the actors are the roughly same ages that 
Gyllenhaal and Swift were when they were 
together. I can’t say definitively if nine years is 
too much of an age difference if both parties are 
consenting adults, but when I first saw O’Brien 
and Sink lock lips, it was a bit jarring. I couldn’t 
help the queasy feeling in my stomach. I’m 
sure Swift knew what she was doing when she 
chose Sink; her role as a child actor is still fresh 
in the world’s mind, and we can’t help but feel 

that she’s still too young, that she’s still 13 in our 
minds. It makes me think that this is how Swift 
must have felt during this relationship: frozen in 
time, feeling like a little girl trying desperately to 
grow up.
The highlight of the short film is the acting. 
It has been way too long since O’Brien has had 
the chance to do dramatic acting on such a large 
stage. Swift said that much of the “electric” 
dialogue in one particular scene was improvised, 
giving a really natural feel to the atmosphere. 
O’Brien puts dirty dishes away and half-laughs 
as Sink explains her hurt feelings, calling her 
selfish only to backtrack by saying, “You’re acting 
selfish.” He repeats a half-hearted, weightless 
apology like in an early 2000s rom-com where 
men never know what they’re apologizing for 
but want to get out of the doghouse.
Worse still, O’Brien’s performance is still so 
romantic and charming. If it were me, I could 
never convince myself that he was anything 
else but a handsome guy who makes me laugh. 
I’m tempted to believe him a bit when he says 
he didn’t mean to brush off his girlfriend’s 
hand at dinner, that he really was just having 
fun with his friends and maybe she is making it 

about herself. But, just as magnetic as he is, this 
nameless man turns on a dime and slams a car 
door in his girlfriend’s face, throwing the keys 
at her. A Twitter user writes, “Jake Gyllenhaal 
having a ‘fuck the patriarchy’ keychain while 

dating women 10 years younger than him does 
track.” Men always seem to find a reason to 
make us hate them, don’t they?

Anonymity is the internet’s most sacred 
asset. The freedom to say anything, to ignore the 
draconian social rules of everyday life, is what 
made the anonymous messaging application 
Yik Yak popular after its initial launch in 2013. 
The app shut down in 2017 after cyberbullying 
concerns, but in August of this year, Yik Yak 
re-appeared in app stores. This Yik Yak is 
a buggy yet functional reincarnation of its 
previous self — the app centers around “yaks,” 
text posts with a 200-character limit shown 
to anyone within a five-mile radius. Users can 
upvote or downvote posts, and enough upvotes 
can earn yaks a spot on the “Local Top Yaks”; 
yaks that receive more than five downvotes are 
hidden from the feed. Each poster is nameless; 
the only way to tell users apart is from their 
representative emoji randomly chosen by the 
app — this can be changed at any time. 
Whether it’s from the nostalgia of the 
2010s, the excitement of returning to campus 

after a year and a half or the innate desire to 
connect with people, the Ann Arbor Yik Yak 
bubble has been populated with hundreds, 
possibly thousands, of University of Michigan 
students. From South Quad to the UGLi 
to North Campus to the Blue Leprechaun, 
Ann Arbor’s pandemic-weary student body 

has yikked every yak, putting every fleeting 
thought on blast no matter how obscene. It’s 
unclear exactly how many people actively 
use Yik Yak, but the archive of “Local Top 
Yaks” gives an idea — the most popular yak in 
the area exceeds 450 upvotes, which doesn’t 
account for the additional downvotes the post 

may have received or the users who simply 
didn’t interact.
Over the last several weeks, I’ve happily 
shoved aside impending midterms and 
assignments to pursue the more stimulating 
task of researching the University’s Yik Yak 
scene. At first, I tried to reach out to the Yik Yak 
community and ask them what they would like 
to say to The Daily. The responses included, 
but were not limited to: “Don’t go to class, eat 
ass,” “Fuck MSU,” “No one in the daily knows 
how big my dick is” and “balls.” With this, I 
determined that the best move forward would 
be to leave the yakkers up to their own devices 
and simply observe. So, I did — from morning to 
evening, I took in every new yak, scrolling with 
abandon during any and all spare moments. 
With a paralyzing amount of confessionals, 
complaints, jokes and drunken rambles, I was 
able to interpret Yik Yak as a microcosm of local 
youth culture. 
Yik Yak is a place for speaking your mind — 
evidently, the minds of U-M students are fraught 
with dysfunctional group projects, midterms, 
Math 116 assignments on “WeBWorK” and the 

hassle of finding an unoccupied study space in 
any campus building. On a fundamental level, 
all students can relate to personal experiences 
with stress and exhaustion. After all, suffering 
is easier when it’s shared.
When the dining halls are open, you might 
see complaints about the long lines at South 
Quad or the quality of the food from that day. 
One user posts detailed dining hall reviews, 
ranking their experience with the culinary 
competence of Gordon Ramsay. Other notable 
yak topics include the resounding shrieks of 6 
a.m. Amtrak trains, midnight fire alarms at the 
residence halls, offensive B.O. on the Bursley-
Baits Loop and scathing fraternity slander.
The lighthearted innocence of Yik Yak 
stops there. Sometimes, actually most of the 
time, yaks lean towards the cruder side — on 
a mid-October evening, an influx of yaks 
revolved around an alleged poop-related 
incident in the Stockwell showers. With 62 
upvotes, the sentiments of many residents 
were memorialized in the following yak, 
“Trying to go to sleep but I cannot knowing 
the stockwell shitter walks free.” As much 

as there was disgust, the jokes ran rampant 
too: one yak reads, “Just went to take a shit 
in Stockwell and there was a shower in the 
way??!” and another “McCarthyism, but it’s 
the poop in the shower.” 
On the other end of the “out-of-pocket” 
spectrum, hormones rage with reckless 
abandon. After the sun goes down, roughly 
one out of every three yaks is a cry for help, an 
S.O.S. from the throes of loneliness. I couldn’t 
forget them if I tried: “I’m so down bad I might 
just try finding love with the next snapchat 
sex bot that adds me” and “what are boobs? 
I’m a visual learner btw” are the tamest of 
the tame. The efforts of Yik Yak’s community 
guardrails are of no avail of even the most 
vulgar expressions of biological needs.
The “Leaders and Best” of Ann Arbor share a 
propensity for all things toilet-related, whether 
it’s debates of the best bathroom on campus 
or anecdotes of traumatizing experiences — I 
wouldn’t address the fixation on potty humor if 
it wasn’t for its alarming frequency.

Reality television has monopolized the TV screen for 
years. From “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” to “The 
Bachelor,” audiences around the world are immersed in the 
overwhelmingly ridiculous lives of celebrities or those who 
want to be celebrities. Nevertheless, the genre is expanding 
to encompass people of different backgrounds, with different 
stories. This includes Amazon Prime’s new docuseries 
“Always Jane.”
This four-part series focuses on Jane Noury, a transgender 
teenager, and the Noury family throughout her transitioning 
period. The audience is given a glimpse into their world at a 
time that precedes much change: Jane prepares for college, 
awaits her gender-affirming surgery and takes a chance on 
modeling. Fortunately for her, she is supported by her parents, 
two sisters and grandfather throughout it all.
While “Always Jane” takes on a sensitive and highly 
relevant topic, the first episode falls short of its potential. 
Undoubtedly, the show is engaging and the audience can’t help 
but fall in love with the Nourys: They are the quintessential 
boisterous and overprotective family. In fact, throughout the 
pilot, Jane reiterates how grateful she is for her parents and 
their unwavering love during what is an extremely pivotal 
time in her life.
And so, as we watch the show, we can’t help but feel relief 
and pure happiness for Jane, who is a lively, passionate and 
silly teenage girl. However, while the series aims to present 
the difficulties that a trans teen like Jane faces in the political 
and social climate of today’s world, it doesn’t entirely live up 
to this goal. 
The way the story is presented is too simplified and 
superficial. Through videos Jane takes of herself and clips 
of her day-to-day life, the only thing the show reveals is 
how strong she is as an individual and how understanding 
her family has been throughout her transition. However, 
it doesn’t touch on the fact that a support system and the 
acceptance of friends and family is not a luxury that every 
person in the LGBTQ+ community is lucky enough to have. 
So while Jane discusses her past issues of bullying and 
self-acceptance, the series only barely scratches the surface of 
what is a much larger issue. And inevitably, this undermines 
the main intention of the show: to address the larger struggles 
transgender people endure on a daily basis. 
“Always Jane” doesn’t necessarily devalue Jane’s journey 
and the many obstacles that came with her decision to 
transition. Yet, it doesn’t dive into those obstacles nearly as 
much as it otherwise could have. Simply put, the tribulations 
Jane has experienced and will continue to experience as 
a trans woman are only briefly mentioned but not further 
developed within the episode. For instance, her mother Laura 
explains that there was a process the family had to go through 
in order for Jane to play on the girls’ soccer team at school; 
however, nothing else like this is addressed. The audience isn’t 
explicitly told what that process was like, how long it took or 
how it affected Jane personally. Instead, it is mentioned and 
never talked about again.
So, while “Always Jane” attempts to show viewers the 
implications of being a young trans person in the 21st century, 
it does so in a very surface-level way. Rather than being privy 
to the adversity Jane faces, we are just onlookers into the life of 
a teenager as she gets into college, hangs out with her friends 
and spends time with her family.

Michigan in Color
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Attending a 9 a.m. lecture. Setting up a 
table at the Posting Wall. Printing out a last-
minute essay. Gathering for a student organi-
zation meeting after hours. As students at the 
University of Michigan, we spend so much of 
our time in Angell Hall, but how many of us 
actually know who James Burrill Angell is 
and what his legacy entails? Learned pieces 
of the University’s history seem to be met 
exclusively with shock and disappointment 
from students, faculty and alumni, and my 
moral outrage is growing weary. As a third-
year student, each passing term’s revela-
tions have left me with more to consider in 
regards to my relationship to this institution 
and its roots. I feel tainted with remorse for 
the countless survivors of sexual misconduct 
denied their due justice. I stand in solidar-
ity with the unmet needs of the Graduate 
Employees’ Organization and the Lecturers’ 
Employee Organization from an inadequate 
reopening plan. I remain appalled by the 
historically racist and exploitative practices 
of the Order of Angell, an exclusive senior 
honor society that disbanded just this past 
spring. Most of all, I am frustrated at the lack 
of accountability taken by the administration 
to address an imperfect history of the Lead-
ers and the Best.
Over the course of the past month, mem-
bers from my organization South Asian 
Awareness Network came together with 
organizers from the United Asian American 
Organizations, Central Student Government 
and LSA Student Government to discuss the 
legacy of former University President James 
B. Angell and the memorialization of his 
name to one of the highest-traffic student 
buildings on campus. Each week’s meetings 
worked toward brainstorming and planning 
a response to appropriately address his legacy. 
Here’s what we came up with: a CSG resolu-
tion draft calling for the removal of Angell’s 

name from the University building, a teach-
in and dialogue surrounding the present-day 
implications of Angell’s history, and a cultural 
fashion show on the steps of Angell Hall in 
celebration and reclamation of a space that the 
late president himself may not have expected 
our presence in. 
For context, Angell held a 38-year term 
as the president of the University and was a 
nationally recognized leader in higher edu-
cation, bringing in record number enroll-
ments and increasing accessibility for many 
students. In addition to his presidency, Angell 
served as a U.S. ambassador to China during 
which he re-negotiated the Burlingame Trea-
ty. While this treaty endorsed immigration 
at the high point of U.S.-China relations, the 
Treaty of Angell recognized the U.S. govern-
ment’s power to regulate the immigration of 
Chinese laborers due to domestic economic 
tension. As American Culture professor Ian 
Shin explained during the mid-November 
teach-in, Angell signed on to this treaty out 
of a sense of public duty as opposed to actual 
support for exclusion. Regardless of his initial 
hesitations to sign, the Treaty of Angell paved 
the way for the passage of the Chinese Exclu-
sion Act of 1882, one of the most racist immi-
gration bills in American history. Regardless 
of his intent to bring students on campus 
together, the secret society Order of Angell — 
formerly known as Michigamua — eventually 
became known for its profane appropriation 
of Native American culture and its notorious-
ly racist and elitist nature. President James B. 
Angell may have been a moral centrist, but the 
consequences of his neutrality leave a perma-
nent mark on the University’s history. Is this 
someone worth memorializing?
On Nov. 17, 2021, CSG’s ongoing resolu-
tion passed for the renaming of the Univer-
sity building Angell Hall and Angell Scholar 
Award. While I consider this a necessary step 
in the right direction, I can’t help but admit to 
a qualm I’ve had since the teach-in. 

700 square feet. That is how much space 
I had for the first 18 years of my life. 700 
square feet consisted of one full bathroom, 
a connected kitchen and living room, a bed-
room and a master bedroom that was only 
a few feet longer — split among five people. 
The members of apartment 2F included my 
busy dad, doting mom, brat of a little sister, 
smiley baby brother and myself.
700 square feet forces you to be creative. 
My dad was able to strategically fit a baby’s 

crib, a file cabinet and a three-piece furniture 
set in one bedroom while leaving a single 
strip of floor space for praying. Sticky, humid 
New York summers also meant investing 
and placing wall fans, window fans, stand-
ing fans and tower fans in each room. Those 
700 square feet taught my sister how to pick 
the bathroom lock when I would hog up 
the only private space in our home. When 
friends or family came over, we slept laterally 
to fit as many people onto a bed as possible, 
with our feet hanging off as we grew taller. 
My mom shopped for furniture with stor-
age units, and even stacked our drawers to 
make for more room. Naturally, nothing was 
set. There were no designated 
rooms. My socks and computer 
desk floated around the living 
room or wherever they fit best 
at the time. My sister and I slept 
wherever there was a bed. Nei-
ther of us claimed a room as we 
had guests flow in and out of 2F 
for weeks to months at a time. I 
learned how to fall asleep any-
where, to keep earbuds with me 
always and most importantly: 
to not be confined to my 700 
square feet. 
My parents kept 
my siblings and me 
busy 

and out of the house with school, after-
school programs and every weekend at 
madrasa. But these in themselves all felt 
like work and chores — not a true escape 
from my bottom bunk. I craved being out-
side without reason. I yearned for mindless 
walks and car rides. I satisfied this need 
every time my mom went out, practically 
begging her to let me join in on her errands. 
I’d happily hop in the car on a Sunday morn-
ing to play music and offer mindless chatter. 
Any aunties who’d join would give animat-
ed gasps each time they found me sitting in 
the backseat, but I soon became a regular 
member on these trips. The route followed 
the order of errands: first to put in orders at 
the butcher shop, then random shops and 
stalls with things to return and only buy if 
there was a good deal and finally returning 
back to the butcher and local supermarkets 
for frozen groceries. I was of no use on these 
trips as I enjoyed eating Costco samples, 
wandering through the stores eyeing items 
and — at my best — reminding my mom to 
pick up some cilantro. I mainly liked the 
potential of convincing my mom to pull into 
the McDonald’s drive-thru or stop at a halal 
cart before getting back home. I was unsuc-
cessful most times. Instead, she let me pick 
up light snacks or chocolate at the register 
— a little treat for doing nothing but being 
outside with her. I’d set my straw-
berry-kiwi Snapple and two-for-$1 
potato chips on the counter while 
my mom added, “Take 5, please.”
Take 5. It can be interpreted as 
“take a break” or even the Reese’s 

“Take 5” chocolate bar. But it was under-
stood as a one-dollar, small scratch-away 
lottery ticket. The bright yellow and magenta 
card could always be found in my mom’s 
purse or kitchen countertop. It’s an easy 
game to play: scratch away and get three of 
the same number to win that amount in dol-
lars. Most commonly, my mom would win 
back the one dollar she’d initially spent on the 
lotto ticket. This mostly no-loss trend made 
it harmless fun. There were only a few times 
she won anything upwards of five dollars, 
which would be enough to cover my little 
snacks. The greatest amount you can win is 
$5,555. It was not a lot but it was definitely 
something. A lump sum to ease the pressure 
at home. Something to make our measly 700 
square feet feel lavish. I imagined the $5,555 
being put to good use to buy more McDon-
ald’s Happy Meals long into the future. In 
hindsight, I realize $5,555 runs out quickly. 
This weekend, I finally understood the 
significance of Take 5. The high pressures 
of raising three kids in Queens, N.Y. have 
dissolved as my mom now settles into a 
quiet, suburban lifestyle. The image of her 
sipping hot tea in our backyard before tend-
ing to her small garden fits so well that I’ve 
forgotten how she’d scratch the lotto ticket 
against the deli wall with a rusting penny. 
There’s no more running rushed errands, 
scrambling for parking or navigating a 
700-square-foot living space. There seems 
to be no more need for Take 5 or lotto tick-
ets. But this past weekend, I learned I was 
wrong when my mom asked my dad to pick 
up a Take 5 for her. It was then that I real-

ized the goal was never to win $5,555 (but 
that would have been nice). Instead, it was to 
try and test one’s luck. It may bring an extra 
ten or fifteen bucks, or you lose a dollar. Like 
many other immigrants, faith in luck is one 
of the things my mom held on to in starting 
a new life where she knew no one. In mov-
ing across the globe with nothing but hope 
and luck, you have to trust that things will 
work out. That’s a much bigger gamble to 
make than playing Take 5. My mom con-
tinues to fall back on pure luck, except now 
by scratching three-like amounts [COPY: 
is this phrase referring to the three same 
numbers you have to get? maybe rephrase 
this if that’s not what it’s referring to] to see 
how lucky she might be. 
My childhood home might be dubbed 
as “not so lucky” by others. But I never felt 
unfortunate, even if my mom lost a dollar 
that day on Take 5. I never felt that way at all 
in our 700 square feet. It’s easy to say I felt 
content because that’s all I’d ever known. 
But it was my parents who truly made me 
feel lucky. I was lucky that my mom stocked 
our snack cabinet with Ferrero-Rochers in 
secret after telling my sister and me “no” at 
the store. My dad fulfilled our dreams by 
somehow making space for a five-foot-tall 
aquarium with tens of neon-colored fish. 
We were lucky to have our yellowish-white 
fridge covered in magnets from our vaca-
tions, family photos and messy art projects. 
Our cozy apartment 2F may not be classified 
as a house, but my parents definitely made it 
a home. Every square foot was somewhere I 
felt lucky to be. 

My paint-chipped garage slowly unhinges 
its gaping jaw to swallow my father’s car whole. 
Clad in my only fitting black collared shirt and 
a pair of athletic shorts, I walk down the stairs 
to meet my dad, still wearing his aloha shirt and 
black slacks from work. We smile at each other 
before climbing into his car. The half-hour drive 
passes by silently until we reach our destina-
tion. “We’re a little early, do you want to get a 
snack to kill time?” “Of course,” I enthusiasti-
cally answer. My dad navigates to a nearby 7-11, 
where I check out with a warm spam musubi 
and a refreshing can of Thai tea in hand. I don’t 
want to be disrespectful, so I wolf down both 
before we return to our destination. My dad 
laughs at my remarkable eating speed, and I 
chuckle in response as he pulls into the park-
ing lot. We park across from my mom, who is 
just getting out of her car as well. We greet each 
other and then follow the familiar laughter 
echoing out of the funeral home. 
I knew this day was coming long before 
I learned of my aunty’s passing the previous 
month. Of course, death can claim anyone at 
any moment, but I only really thought about 
it in my own life after my aunty’s stroke a few 
years earlier. My grandparents would take 
my sister and I to her house sometimes when 
my parents had to work. We would spend 
the afternoon taking her dog on a walk to the 
market up the street and strolling through 
the aisles of the small store. I knew she liked 
to travel, and my dad told me she had been to 
Japan a few times. She was one of few in our 

family who actually went back to our ances-
tral home country, and I regret not asking her 
about her memories of Japan now. As a young 
child, I never thought to ask her about her life 
before I was born. We weren’t that close since 
and as I grew older I only saw her at occasional 
family gatherings. I didn’t even know her full 
name until I saw the nameplate in her hospi-
tal room. I always just called her “Aunty K” 
as everyone else in my family did. “K” wasn’t 
even her first initial.
She also wasn’t actually my aunt. Techni-
cally she was my grandmother’s sister, but I 
always felt more comfortable just calling her 
“aunty,” just like my dad’s sister and his moth-
er’s other sister’s daughter and his dad’s sister’s 
husband’s two daughters, all of whom sit in the 
metal folding chairs of the mortuary. I bounce 
around the room to chat with all of my rela-
tives, whom I haven’t seen since the start of the 
pandemic. They are brimming with questions 
about my major and my first year of college. 
My other aunty’s infectious laughter echoes 
around the room as I talk about my steady diet 
of dining hall chicken tenders and fries. I don’t 
tell her — don’t tell anyone — that I ate almost 
every meal alone in my dorm room. Beneath 
their masks, I can tell that everyone was smil-
ing, and especially with death looming over us, I 
don’t want to ruin the mood. I eventually nestle 
into a seat between my grandma and my dad 
before the funeral director comes out to start 
the ceremony.
We skip the eulogy. While the gong rings 
through my eardrums, the monk recites a Bud-
dhist prayer in a language I can’t even identify, 
much less understand. We all bow our heads 
and close our eyes in prayer. I can’t read the 

musings of my family members’ minds as we 
sat in silence. At the end of the funeral, we all 
make an incense offering. One by one, my fam-
ily members walk up to the podium and move 
a few incense chips from their box into the fire. 
We each slightly bow our heads and clasp our 
hands together in a moment of silence before 
returning to our seats.
When it’s my turn, I don’t know what I 
should pray for. After so many hospital visits 
and silent car rides down the long hill down 
from the hospital to the city, I had long since 
accepted that this fate was inevitable. My aunty 
would want us to be happy despite her absence. 
And so I am happy, or at least I am as happy 
as one could be at a funeral. This preemptive 
grieving had saved me the anguish of suddenly 
trying to process the void she had left behind in 
the short month between her passing and the 

funeral. I turn around and walk back to my seat, 
facing the rest of my family. Their eyes all point 
in different directions, some are closed, some 
aim at the ground and others stare directly at 
me. Those eyes have seen my aunty’s face long 
before I was born. I wonder what thoughts 
and memories churn behind their pupils. But 
I can at least guess that they too have privately 
mourned before now, because when the funeral 
is finished, we all leave dry-eyed. 
This wasn’t the first time I thought about 
losing my family. Ever since ninth grade, when 
I knew I was gay, I’ve been thinking about the 
consequences of my coming out. My family and 
I have come to a nonverbal peace agreement 
since we’ve grown. It’s been years since shout-
ing voices had endlessly bounced off the walls of 
the house. In their place, quietness fills up every 
inch of the house. The stillness of the air seeps 

into my throat and arrests my vocal cords. But 
I prefer this silent suffocation to choked back 
tears. The fleeting silence makes the threat of 
bereavement loom even more menacingly over 
my household. I don’t want to risk undermin-
ing all the effort we’ve put in over the years, 
yet I cannot live a lie forever. Thus I grieve the 
comfort we share knowing that I will eventu-
ally shatter this fragile reality we’ve shaped for 
ourselves.
In the Buddhist faith, death results in rebirth 
until we can escape the cycle and achieve 
enlightenment. I find comfort in knowing that 
we may get unlimited opportunities to keep 
learning and growing. Although the compari-
son isn’t one-to-one, if the revelation of my true 
self does kill our family’s relationship as we 
know it, I hope that household can be recon-
structed and tried again.

Preemptive Grieving

Neptune stations direct 
in its ruling house, the twelfth 
house of the subconscious. Now 
is the time to look inward for mo-
tivation and creative inspiration. 
However, don’t get sidetracked by 
your own mind; keep a list of pri-
orities and stick to them before 
starting any new projects.

With Neptune in your 
eleventh house of friendships, 
you may start to over-romanticize 
being in a group. Of course, it is 
natural to yearn for inclusion; 
however, peer pressure could also 
force you to conform to everyone 
else’s standards. Neptune has 
the tendency to make us over-
romanticize people, but you need 
to remain true to 
your own feelings.

When Neptune stations 
direct in your tenth house of career 
ambitions, your work life may sud-
denly become jumbled as projected 
plans don’t pan out the way you had 
intended. However, adaptability is 
a Gemini’s specialty, so just stay on 
your toes and keep in mind alternate 
paths you can take. Ever the social 
butterfly, Geminis often form new 
connections just as quickly as 
they lose old ones.

With Neptune in your 
ninth house of philosophy, you 
may suddenly have grand ideas 
about travel and educational 
pursuits. Now is a great time to 
chase this heightened motivation. 
However, it can be easy to become 
swept up in the fantasy of travel 
or grandiose intellectual 
pursuits.

When Neptune stations 
direct in your sixth house of orga-
nization, you may have great ideas 
about reorganizing your schedule 
or your space. This is a great time 
to think of new plans, but be careful 
that you don’t over-commit yourself 
or begin a reckless renovation 
process. The new moon and solar 
eclipse in your third house of com-
munication and intelligence
 is asking you to take
 a moment alone.
With Neptune in your 
fifth house of creation, you may 
come to some incredible creative 
breakthroughs. Now is the time to 
harness this positive energy and use 
it to create something you’re passion-
ate about. The new moon and solar 
eclipse in your second house of mate-
rialism may cause you to reapproach 
your relationship with money. You 
should examine your expenses and 
aim to eliminate anything that 
isn’t necessary.

When Neptune stations 
direct in your eighth house of 
death and rebirth, your ideal aspira-
tions may not pan out exactly the 
way you had hoped. Leos can get 
especially frustrated when they don’t 
get what they want, and this can 
further hinder their opportunities 
to move past their obstacles. When 
your dreams are crushed, don’t dwell 
on the disrupted past, but 
instead look toward an even 
brighter future.

With Neptune in your 
seventh house of partnerships, 
you may need to re-evaluate 
some of your relationships. 
Neptune can cause us to see 
people as better than they really 
are. Virgos are great at observing 
small details, and this is the time 
to be critical. If certain partner-
ships are causing you distress, 
there is no need to continue 
silently tolerating the harm 
they’ve caused you.

When Neptune stations di-
rect in your fourth house of home 
and family, you may suddenly have 
new ideas to rearrange your living 
space. However, Sagittarius’s typi-
cal carefree attitude combined with 
Neptune’s fantastical influence 
may cause you to act recklessly. 
Before making any major changes 
to your home, be sure you think 
carefully about every decision you 
make. The light of the new moon 
shines upon your sign.

This is an intense week for 
you. Your ruling planet, Neptune, sta-
tions direct in your sign and your first 
house of self-identity. This is a great 
opportunity to generate new creative 
ideas and you may come to a sudden 
emotional breakthrough. However, 
your extremely active imagination 
can cause issues as well. You may 
tend to over-romanticize opportuni-
ties or people, which can cause you to 
overlook underlying issues.

When Neptune stations 
direct in your second house of 
materialism, be wary of frivolous 
purchases. Neptune can cause 
us to see the world through 
rose-tinted glasses, and this can 
be especially dangerous when it 
comes to money. Now is not the 
time to splurge since it is easy to 
overspend.

With Neptune in your third 
house of communication, you 
may view conversations and intel-
lectual pursuits through a much 
more optimistic lens than usual. 
This can be more relieving, but you 
must also approach your studies 
critically as well. If you’re passion-
ate about a certain interest, don’t 
settle for “good enough”; strive to 
be as proficient as possible.

I love a good, classic loading screen. I 
don’t mean those obnoxiously slow progres-
sion bars or the tracker timelines on food 
delivery apps that halt on each stage for 15 
minutes. My favorites are the small, simple 
graphics that repeat in perpetuity with no 
discernible end to their progression. The 
repetitive, continuous motion is oddly calm-
ing. I love the little revolving lights that 
circle around and around, lavishing away 
the time. Or the hypnotic pulsing atop the 
TikTok menu as it struggles to load new 
content.
I love loading screens because, in that 
ephemeral period of rendering, the stakes 
are lower than low. It’s a liminal moment, a 
beat between lines, a time to rest. There are 
no expectations on you because, by nature 
of the technology, there’s nothing you can 
or should be doing in that instant. It’s like 
the calm before the storm. I know that in 
a moment, I’ll be forced to reckon with the 
task at hand, but all I can do in the meantime 
is wait.
As soon as the application loads, you’re 
thrust back into the turmoil of anticipated 
productivity; the clock resumes its inces-
sant ticking. Rest takes on a new name: pro-
crastination. My screen assaults me with a 
thin, blinking cursor on the fresh Word Doc, 
mocking and prodding with each flicker. 
Now you see me, now you don’t. Why won’t 
you put me to use? While the loading screen 
represents a brief, sanctioned, finite hiatus, 
the cursor could blink on in judgment for-
ever.
Sometimes I wish I could dive right 
into the loading screen and ride the blink-
ing light on its ceaseless track like a digital 
merry-go-round. More often, however, I feel 
like the lone cursor, resting on the precipice 
of potential, flashing in and out of existence 
like a specter haunting the page as I conjure 
up my next great passage. If I dwell too long 
on the pressure of the task, I simply freeze 
in place.
There is no gradient in the way I experi-
ence stress. Whether I have a deadline in 
three days or three hours, if I’m struck with 
writer’s block or my ideas won’t calibrate, 
my anxiety will evoke the same measure 
of stress. But every time I decide to take a 
break, to indulge in the luxury of relaxation, 
I can feel the pressure melt away. That same 
sense of serenity is renewed every time I let 
myself push the task off for another day.
I had a friend who told me once that she 
liked to wear her retainer once a week — 
no more, no less. She relished the feeling of 
slight discomfort that came with the spo-
radic endeavor. Any more often, and her 
teeth would have molded to their proper 
places, undermining the purpose of the 
exercise. Any less often, and she would be 

denying herself the masochistic joy of the 
experience.
That’s kind of how I feel about procras-
tination. I know that eventually, I’ll have to 
address the task, but there’s a certain thrill 
in letting the deadline inch closer and closer 
for a buzzer-beating win. Counterproduc-
tive as the strategy may be, the risk is part 
of the reward.
Stalling is a dangerous vice because its 
short-term benefits eclipse the long-term 
consequences. What is the point of punc-
tuality? Why would I ever elect proactiv-
ity over procrastination when the former 
requires so much more effort and the latter 
packs a more rewarding punch? I can live 
with the blinking cursor’s nagging admoni-
tion, especially when I can simply close my 
laptop and willfully forget.
***
W
hen I was in sixth grade, my mom 
mysteriously vanished from our 
Thanksgiving celebration early in the 
morning. It was a full week before my dad 
explained to my brother and me that our 
mom had checked into rehab and was seek-
ing counsel for her alcoholism.
I don’t remember my mom’s addiction 
being an imposition on our family. I was 
only 11 at the time, and my brother was even 
younger. Sure, my mom drank on vaca-
tions, but I couldn’t yet discern the differ-
ence between social drinking and drinking 
to excess. She never drank and drove, she 
never embarrassed me, but clearly, the issue 
was severe enough to warrant treatment. 
All I knew was that when my mom returned 
home, she seemed happier and healthier than 
I’d ever remembered her being. Last week 
was her 10-year anniversary of sobriety.
I’ve always regarded my mom’s decision 
to check into rehab as the pinnacle of matu-
rity and self-discipline. She had the remark-
able foresight to get ahead of her addiction, 
addressing the problem while her children 
were still young before it had the chance 
to fester any further. As evidenced by this 
decision, my brother and I were raised in a 
household that valued accountability and 
acknowledged the dangers of addiction.
There were no flippant analogies to 
addiction in my house; no graphic tees with 
the phrase “chocoholic” or “addicted to 
naps” plastered across the front. I’ve pon-
dered the weight of this disease since before 
my adolescent growth spurt. It’s one of, if 
not the sole reason why I can say with com-
plete sincerity that I have addictive tenden-
cies when it comes to procrastination.
I wasn’t always prone to this behavior. 
My whole childhood was an exercise in self-
censorship and perfectionism. I distinctly 
remember the first time I ever dared to ask 
my parents for something without already 
knowing their answer would be yes. I natu-
rally fell into the mold of a “perfect daugh-
ter,” and some part of me was afraid that if I 
started poking holes in that facade, it would 

all come crashing down.
I was a top-notch kid. I don’t say this 
seeking any praise. It’s just true. I got perfect 
grades, had a diverse set of extracurriculars, 
worked 30 hour weeks at the local ice cream 
shop — the whole nine. I did everything that 
was asked of me above and beyond. I had 
high expectations for myself.
One night in eighth grade, I asked my 
parents if I could go to a 9 p.m. movie with 
a friend. It was a chilly fall school night, and 
I’d finished all of my homework, but I wasn’t 
sure if they’d let me go to the late show-
time that ended slightly after my curfew. 
But when they said yes, a whole new world 
opened up to me. I began to recognize my 
own agency, particularly as it pertained to 
abstaining from the expectations that I’d 
always just assumed were requirements.
In my senior year of high school, I was 
editor-in-chief of our school’s newspaper. 
That was when I started pushing my luck 
with deadlines. On the eve of the first edi-
tion, I realized that we were one-story short 
from filling the pages, so I churned out 1,500 
words in a single night and sent the complet-
ed edition off to the printing presses. It was 
a successful bout of simulated procrastina-
tion — a gateway into the more egregious 
offenses to come.
From then on, I procrastinated writing 
at least one piece (if not two or three) until 
the week of production. Quite frankly, it 
was invigorating, because I just kept getting 
away with it. I was hooked on the thrill of 
inaction.
The tendency to postpone and binge 
my responsibilities began seeping into 
my formal academics. My class had a full 
year to write our senior theses, but I wrote 
mine over the course of four afternoons. I 
crammed for every test the night before. 
I would accumulate work over weeks and 
weeks and then hole up in my room for a 
weekend every month to catch up. And I still 
graduated with a perfect record.
When I got to college, my self-destructive 
habits began to catch up with me. A’s turned 
to B’s turned to a whole semester of sealed-
off grades for classes that I barely passed.
I was a sophomore when the pandemic 
hit campus and students were sent home. 
For the next two semesters, I did the bare 
minimum to get through my classes. I would 
wallow in a depressive state for hours on 
end, attend Zoom meetings with my camera 
turned off and whip up a subpar discussion 
post in 15 minutes before logging off for the 
weekend.
I cut off contact with every campus orga-
nization I’d joined. I didn’t call my parents 
or pick up when they called me. I would 
check in every few weeks to let them know 
I was still alive, but for the most part, I kept 
everyone at a distance. This was my prover-
bial “rock bottom.”
Growing up, before I discovered the 
splendor of edging my responsibilities, pro-

ductivity and punctuality were my default 
modes. I never learned how to choose to 
work. It was like I was functioning on auto-
pilot. Instead, I learned to choose by learn-
ing to let go. Yet once I’d let go, I didn’t have 
the skillset to start back up again. Account-
ability is so much easier to destroy than it is 
to create.
Sometimes I wish I’d never realized my 
agency, the power I have to simply press 
pause. Maybe then I’d be graduating with a 
better GPA or a fuller resume. Maybe then 
I’d be blissfully happy. But I catch myself 
whenever I lapse into that line of thinking 
and remind myself of my mom. If I hadn’t 
gone down this path when I did, I would 
have had to reckon with it later in life once 
I’d amassed more to lose.
***
W
hen you’re addicted to a substance, 
the treatment is simple: You cut 
yourself off from the substance completely. 
This is not to say that the process is easy or 
inconsequential, but at least you have a road 
map. When your vice is something like pro-
crastination, which will always exist as an 
option, there is no way to avoid its persistent 
beckoning.
During those few semesters, the urge 
to procrastinate was debilitating. When-
ever I was overtaken by a passing thought 
of guilt, I brushed it off by doubling down 
in self-righteous inaction. I’ve since come 
to terms with the fact that guilt has value. 
It reminds you that what you’re doing is 
wrong, and encourages you to reverse 
course. I had to stop taking offense at rea-
sonable criticism, even when it came from 
my own conscience.
I am still making an effort every day 
to be better than I was yesterday. I am not 
always successful. For example, I turned 
this essay in over 12 hours after it was due 
(sorry Statement friends). But the biggest 
thing I’ve learned from my “lost semesters” 
is that yesterday’s failure does not give me a 
free pass to make the same mistakes today. I 
have to choose to work all over again every 
single day.
What is the benefit of punctual-
ity? Improved mental health, for one. Why 
choose proactivity over procrastination? To 
prove to yourself that you are capable of it. 
Perhaps that is easier said than done, but at 
least I know it’s possible. At this stage, that’s 
enough for me.
It’s fun to submit an assignment days 
before it’s due, with Canvas congratulating 
me with digital confetti for a job well done. 
The TV shows I used to employ as a dis-
traction from the compounding workload 
are better without that constant twinge of 
anxiety looming over me as I watch. Load-
ing screens are an earned respite when 
you know you’ve been working hard, and 
the blinking cursor is stripped of its power 
when it’s met with a piece of writing that I’m 
proud of.

Since the start of my childhood, Nov. 1 meant the 
hanging of a quilt from the stove in my kitchen. 
It was my mom’s “Thankful Quilt,” decorated 
with felt leaves, turkeys and other Thanks-
giving-esque patches. More importantly, the 
quilt was lined with little pockets numbered one 
through 30 — a pocket for each day of the month. 
And every night, before eating dinner, my mom 
would have my sister and I write down what 
we were thankful for that day on tiny paper 
cards that tucked perfectly into the little felt slots. 
We did it each day until all 30 were filled and then 
tucked the quilt away for hibernation until the fol-
lowing November.
Our Thankful Quilt became such a routine part of 
our Novembers that the process came without much 
thought. Sometimes I’d put genuine effort into my 
day’s thankful card. Others, I’d scribble something 
down on the paper to expedite the commencement 
of the meal. If nothing else, the Thankful Quilt was 
familiar — it was tradition.
Last year was my first November away from home, 
yet I never thought about the quilt. I simply didn’t 
have the mental capacity to reminisce. At that time, 
I was preoccupied with the announcement that the 
freshman dorms were closing due to the uncontrol-
lable COVID-19 spread. I was running around Ann 
Arbor trying to find housing for my second semester 
at the University of Michigan. I was worried about 

the friends I had made thus far, or lack thereof, 
and how my social life would play out with com-
mon areas unavailable to us. I was anticipating the 
nearly two-month break that was approaching, 
where the progress I had made in pioneering my 
pandemic-era first semester of college would be 
halted, maybe even reversed. I was operating in 
fight-or-flight, running on autopilot as a defense 
mechanism; thus, the Thankful Quilt didn’t 
grace my thoughts.
This year, with life more settled, the treasured 
novelty made its return into my concerns. On 
Nov. 1, I thought about the bare stove at home, 
which, on this day, was usually made merrier. I 
filled out a mental card and tucked it into a men-
tal Nov. 1 pocket: “I’m thankful that I’m calm 
enough this year to think about our quilt.”
The minute of gratitude felt like progress, 
for sure. I am infinitely grateful that now, come 
November, it doesn’t necessarily feel like 
the world is crumbling in on me. That 
I have certainty of my near future 
and a sense 
of purpose here at 
this 
school. Now I 
realize how much 
our circumstances can 
impact 
what 
we’re 
grateful 
for, 
what 
matters to us, what’s 
relevant, and what 
we feel lucky to have 
as ours. All of this can 
change in just one revolution 
around the sun, one November to 
the next. 
While I’m no lon-
ger in a 

state of 
fight-or-flight, my life 
is still extremely hectic — just 
in a “normal life” sort of way. 
So 
are 
most students’ day-to-days 
here at the 
University. We’re running to classes, extracurricu-
lars, social events and meetings. We’re navigating 
flu season, midterms and course scheduling. No 
one sits us down before dinner to make us pause 
and think. No one straps us to a chair and 
forces us to come up with something we’re 
thankful for before we’re able to receive 
our mobile order from Chipotle on State 
Street. 

But I feel like we’re the ones who need a Thank-
ful Quilt the most, even more so than our 8-year-
old selves. Currently, at the University, we’re 
experiencing some of the most unique, rewarding, 
exciting years of our lives. But often, we’re 
too caught up in the everyday bustle 
to take note of what’s happen-
ing around us. As we run from 
classes to meetings, submit 
one assignment to Canvas and 
begin the next, we lose sight of 
the forest for the trees. That we 
need to stop and smell the roses 
may be cliché, but it’s cliché for 
good reason.
I have lots of anxiety, and I 
admittedly do complain a lot on a 
daily basis. But thinking about 
even how much I’ve grown 
and learned since August, 
or how much I have to 
be grateful for this 
year that would 
have been miss-
ing 
from 
my 
paper 
cards 
last 
year, things are look-
ing, 
overall, pretty positive. 
I 
should 
be taking inventory more 
often to notice 
such a fact. I should be fill-
ing out a thankful card each and every night. 
Moreover, we should notice and applaud what’s 
happening in our lives right now, before all of a sud-
den we’re putting on shorts again. Better yet, before 
we’re putting on a cap and gown, or even more daunt-
ing, professional clothes for our adult-life jobs. 
Even though I let a handful of days slip through 
the cracks, about three days ago I decided I would 
re-implement the Thankful Quilt into my daily 
practice. Before allowing myself to indulge in my 
dinner, whatever and wherever it is, I’ve been 
pausing to write a mental card and place it in a 
mental pocket. On Nov. 8, I was thankful that 
I’m living in a sorority house with friends I’ll have for 
the rest of my life. On Nov. 9, I was thankful that I 
have such a well-rounded slew of classes and extra-
curriculars that are rewarding to me. I was grate-
ful 
for Parents Weekend on Nov. 
10 and Thursday nights 
out on Nov. 11. Come 
Nov. 12, I was 

grateful that we can now go to basketball games at 
the Crisler Center. 
I called my mom alerting her of my practice, and 
she revealed that she’d saved the 
cards my sister and I had written 
growing up. Dug out from the 

bottom 
of a drawer, they read: “I’m thankful 
for Eggos pancakes;” “I’m thank-
ful that we have medicine;” “I’m 
thankful that I have time to 
practice my dance routine 
for Sunday;” “I’m thankful 
for sweatpants;” and “I’m 
thankful that we get to visit 
Michigan this weekend.”
Ironically, not much has changed. While I’m 
newly thankful to be secure in how to navigate a col-
lege campus, for Thursday nights out and for weeks 
without too much work, I’m still thankful for Eggo 
pancakes, and I’m always happy about a day spent in 
sweats. Coincidentally enough, I have a hip-hop team 
performance on Saturday and am still thankful that 
I’ve had enough time to practice for it. And obviously, 
I am thankful that I now go to Michigan and am here 
every weekend.
We should always be grateful for those nuts and 
bolts that withstand changing circumstances; like 
family, good health, and of course, sweatpants. But 
changing or static, whether we’re 10 or 20, it’s the 
stepping back, seeing the big picture and acknowl-
edging our blessings that matters. Because life moves 
quickly — as quickly as the slots on the Thankful 
Quilt fill up, and as quickly as I grew up and am no 
longer home to partake in the activity. 
Luckily, I’ll be home soon for Thanksgiving 
break to fill out pre-dinner thankful cards. But 
until then, and maybe even after, I think I’ll con-
tinue filling out my mental ones. Tonight, I am 
thankful for tradition, for the quilt itself. Of all my 
years slipping cards into those felt pockets, I never 
gave thanks to their reliable, yearly presence over 
my stove. I think my thanks is long overdue. Our 
little family ritual taught me to value the moment 
and 
what I have in it. And while I can’t carry 
the Thankful Quilt with me, I can cer-
tainly carry its teachings.

Thankful for feeling Thankful

It’s mid-January, so it’s cold outside. In front of the 
sliding glass doors of the superstore, one can see the 
glimmer of snowflakes falling in the navy of night 
and the resulting slush on the pavement. Inside the 
doors, however, it’s warm. Fluorescent lights flood 
the surfaces and the metal shelves, filled to the brim 
with products across all genres. The rows have a cer-
tain metallic shine. Workers pace diligently through-
out the store, but a particular corner goes unnoticed. 
Hidden behind the vacant check-out counters is 
a group of teenagers unable to be seen due to height 
and in sufficient quantity to make a calculated circle. 
In the middle of this circle is a pair of hands, prying 
open the paperboard that contains a plush fried egg 
collectible. The collection of heads maintain the noise 
level with conversation and ensure security by fre-
quently glancing outside of the huddle. The fried egg 
is freed from the confines of plastic and paper and is 
slipped silently into a jean pocket. Smiles of success 
are exchanged, and the group splits up into different 
checkouts to pay for the legally obtained items. The 
group ventures back into the winter’s night. It was 
only a few minutes after initiation, and the theft was 
complete. 
What they did was illegal under all interpretations 
of the law and could land any of them with a scratch 
on their permanent record. But, was not paying for a 
small toy wrong? 
Stories of small thefts, trespassing, and other petty 
crimes are often taboo subjects, especially among 
classmates or acquaintances whose potential reac-
tions are hard to anticipate. Once one anecdote is 
shared, however, the door often opens for many more 
— what was once underground flows out to the sur-
face. Conversations of recent robberies serve as a sort 
of group therapy among youth and young adults, vali-
dating an experience many keep within them due to 
fear of the law. Where the law and the general public 
draw the line is not necessarily the same, however. 
Hobby Lobby has been called “the best place to steal 
from,” with social media users citing its lack of bar-
codes and cameras. Others’ justification stems from 
the chain’s conservative anti-worker and anti-LGBT+ 
policies. Similarly, people steal from national chain 
stores like Walmart and Kroger with the mindset of 

fighting back against billion-dollar corporate-con-
glomerates. 
The reasoning above is easy to say out loud, but 
are these actions doing any good in the real world? 
Target stores were looted in Minneapolis during 
summer 2020’s Black Lives Matter protests, some 
arguing that the losses would not even affect the 
superstore’s bottom line. But as The Atlantic points 
out, looters are usually different people than peace-
ful protestors, and what is equated with altruism may 
just be a vehicle for young adrenaline. 
***
When one types in “Target,” “Meijer,” or any other 
retail giant into Google Maps while looking at south-
east Michigan, many red pins appear just a few miles 
apart, affixed to the suburban grid-like knots on a 
quilt. The streets are threaded together by the conti-
nuity of corporate brands that might invoke a seasick 
sense of deja vu if one drives down them for too long. 
This repetition has no meaningful rhythm; the logos 
on metal poles that are meant to excite and attract 
blend together into a neon malaise. 
It is easy to feel a sort of contempt and powerless-
ness when faced with the monolithic stucco walls 
and fields of pavement that characterize the land-
scape, even while equipped with the American ide-
als of freedom, and if you’re lucky, leisure time. After 
work and school are done for the day, what is there to 
do? And when the pressure to buy into the capitalist 
ecosystem becomes too much, what else is there to do 
but take back? Stealing as a way to feel something, as 
some may put it, is an increasingly acceptable source 
of entertainment. What other activity puts our brain 
and survival instincts to the test in a world where 
most things are a part of a dull exchange? Under the 
falling snow of a January night, what else besides 
theft with friends gets the blood pumping so quickly 
and with great reward? The capitalist fabric of Amer-
ica has stolen so much from people, whether it be 
space, time, or variety — doesn’t it only make sense to 
take some of that back? 
This power dynamic is what seems to propel the 
thrill: Underdog customers stick it to the man by 
sticking something in their pockets. When “the man” 
is actually a person, whether that be a small business 
owner, a neighbor, or a friend of a friend, the action 
of robbery trespasses into something more personal. 
Walking down the tree-lined streets of Ann Arbor, 
many stores are one of a kind, titled with names of 

owners or the street that they are on; hand-painted 
windows advertising their particular niche. Go to 
a farm stand in Kerrytown enough times and you 
might get your apple cider with a side of pleasant 
banter, and learning the name of a new kind of let-
tuce might lead you to know the names of the people 
that sell the produce. The experience of shopping 
small is one that is photogenic, Instagram-mable and 
yields memories worth posting about in the increas-
ingly popular monthly photo dump. On the contrary, 
heading over to Walgreens or CVS to spend money on 
generic snacks can’t be romanticized.
But stealing them can. 
TikToks with the hashtag “#deviouslicks” have 
sprung up on the For You Page of millions, in an effort 
to channel a rebellious version of the main charac-
ter archetype. They usually begin by describing the 
theft as “diabolical”, “devious” or “ungodly” as a 
remix of a 2014 Lil B song sings in the background. 
A few seconds later as the video concludes, one sees 
the unscrewing of a hubcap in the parking lot, or the 
empty holes of plumbing in the bathroom where a 
toilet usually connects. (It is worth noting that upon 
searching for the hashtag today, TikTok will invite 
you to learn how to recognize “harmful challenges”.) 
What is unique about these videos is the focus on 
stealing from one’s own school. Any unsupervised 
area is fair game: the soap dispensers of the boy’s 
bathroom, stockpiles of disposable masks formerly 
tucked away in closets or the occasional ceiling tile. 
To users, the risk of discipline is a small price to pay 
for the souvenirs of classroom chairs and the rush of 
recognition from millions of online peers. The bore-
dom of mandatory education seeks to be remedied 
through the creation of avant-garde collections of 
stolen institutional furniture. 
Yet unlike the retailers that dot the suburbs, 
schools do not aim to make money and in many areas, 
do not have enough. While the chronic underfunding 
of schools is low on the list of things someone who is 
about to steal the door to a bathroom stall might be 
thinking about, there are some who carefully consider 
the ethics of where exactly they choose to steal. This 
includes large corporations as mentioned earlier, but 
also not-for-profit retail stores like the Salvation Army 
and Goodwill over concerns of worker exploitation 
and discrimination. Perhaps viewed as more envi-
ronmentally and financially conscious consumerism 
by the perpetrators, those in older generations may 

look 
down 
upon 
stealing this 
from charity, 
making it harder to 
do the good 
work these organizations have 
done.
But are the conditions of suburban boredom and 
corporate conglomerates enough to justify stealing 
when others have to do it out of necessity? Shoplifting 
due to hunger increased during the pandemic, and 
it’s hard to criticize people who steal so they can put 
food on the table. What’s a semi-frequent thrill for 
some is a fact of life for many, and a means of enter-
tainment doesn’t share equal weight to means of 
survival. One’s economic status and race affect how 
accessible shoplifting is. Depending on the color of 
the person’s hands peeling back the packaging of the 
toy that January night, the consequences could range 
from life-altering to a forgotten memory. Although 
an isolated act of theft from corporations does not 
necessarily affect any individual, in particular, does 
stealing wrongly take advantage of a justice system 
that’s overbearing on some people and too passive 
on others? Are the desires to bring back power to the 
common people served by ethical stealing if not all 
people can participate? As one considers the justifica-
tions of what they’re stealing from, it’s worth consid-
ering their own identity, and if they are shifting the 
societal power dynamic at all.
The phrase “there is no ethical consumption 
under capitalism” gets thrown around a lot on the 
University of Michigan’s campus, but it’s not too 
clear what this means for theft. Everyone has differ-
ent comfort lines, and the gradient of what’s honor-
able isn’t linear. Rather, this invisible boundary can 
be twisted and molded to whatever shape of justifica-
tion one might like — including the want for a collect-
ible plush egg. To be clear: theft is very much illegal, 
but it also takes creativity, courage, and gusto and 
can provide new social and philosophical realms for 
people to explore. In a system that undervalues the 
arts and emphasizes infatuation with the stock mar-
ket, exactly where money and resources should end 
up is blurred with collective selfishness. So, if you’re 
buying a card for a friend or getting ingredients to 
feed someone dinner, why not grab the things for free 
and get some adrenaline for yourself? The only thing 
stopping you is your own moral judgment.

I
t’s no coincidence that the best film 
from the 2010s was — according 
to Quentin Tarantino and myself — 
David Fincher’s “The Social Network.” 
At the time, the movie’s depiction of 
the protagonist, Mark Zuckerberg 
(played by Jesse Eisenberg), seemed 
a bit over-the-top. Today it feels like 
they held back. The inherent evils of 
Zuckerberg’s monstrosity have been 
evident for years; a solution cannot be 
delayed any longer. 
Following 
the 
testimony 
of 
whistleblower Frances Haugen, a 

former data scientist at Facebook, 
we’ve learned a great deal about 
what Zuckerberg and his company 
are doing. Haugen declared that 
“Facebook can change, but is clearly 
not going to do so on its own” and that 
Congress can limit Facebook’s ability 
to cause harm by changing the rules. I 
disagree — Congress cannot stop this 
social media giant and its conniving 
CEO. Only the people can do that, and 

it requires one step: hit delete. 
Additionally, Haugen said “During 
my time at Facebook, I came to 
realize a devastating truth: Almost 
no one outside of Facebook knows 
what happens inside Facebook.” 
She also stated that Facebook hides 
information from the public, the U.S. 
government and other governments; 
that it uses algorithms to exploit teens’ 
insecurities, like exposing them to 
anorexia content; and that the website 
is “fanning ethnic violence” in places 
like Ethiopia. She put her career on the 
line to expose Facebook’s abominable 
footprint.
That being said, I don’t think 
Mark Zuckerberg is vile. Nor do I 

think that he’s had malicious intent 
in constructing his spectacularly 
successful corporation. Good for him 
for making that much money; it’s what 
capitalism is all about. And I do agree 
with him on one point: It is wrong to 
regulate what can or cannot be said on 
a social network — though this doesn’t 
mean that Congress shouldn’t pass 
privacy and anti-monopoly legislation, 
it absolutely should. My refusal to 

accept the stifling of free speech in 
social media — a topic for another 
article — is why I think people need to 
take matters into their own hands. We 
need to draw on capitalism’s greatest 
strength: choice.
Whoever you are, whatever your 
age or ethnicity, various social media 
outlets play a leviathan role in how 
you and others interpret the world. 
There’s Twitter, Snapchat, Telegram, 
Pinterest, TikTok, Tumblr, Reddit, 
YouTube and even LinkedIn for 
the more career-inclined. There’s 
Instagram and WhatsApp, two that 
belong to Facebook, Inc, which is 
now called Meta after a rebrand. 
Those are toxic in a throng of ways 
too. But Facebook itself is the belle 
of the ball. It started an information 
revolution; if another data revolution 
is coming, the second one would – 
and should – begin with Facebook’s 
demise. I promised myself that I 
wouldn’t reference the movie beyond 
a nod of recognition to its artistic 
brilliance, as it is widely inaccurate in 
numerous regards. However, one of 
Aaron Sorkin’s masterly lines is fitting. 
It’s a prescient remark from Jesse 
Eisenberg’s Zuckerberg, in which he 
says that “Users are fickle. Friendster 
has proved that. Even a few people 
leaving would reverberate through 
the entire user base. The users are 
interconnected.” Should a fraction of 
Facebook’s users choose to leave it, 
the company would be forced to make 
changes without Congress getting 
involved. 
According to a study conducted by 
the University of Colorado, Facebook 
is more of a breeding ground for 
misinformation and lies than other 
social media sites like Twitter, and 
those belonging to the far-left or right 
are more prone to sharing those lies. 

I
n the last week of October, there 
was a curious new cryptocurrency 
that burst onto the scene: Squid 
Game, or SQUID for short. Based 
on, but not officially affiliated with, 
the Netflix sensation, its whitepaper 
promised a reward pool that would 
grow as the number of participants 
grew and a series of games inspired 
by the show involving SQUID tokens.
The past year saw themed 
cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin and 
Shiba Inu achieve exponential, albeit 
temporary, growth driven primarily 
by market hype. Squid Game was 
perfectly placed to emulate their 
success by capturing the excitement 
around its namesake. And it did! 
Squid Game grew to $1, then $10, 
then $100, all while capturing more 
people giving into their feelings of 
FOMO (fear of missing out). It peaked 
at a valuation of nearly $3,000, 
tremendous growth in the space of a 
week.
Sound too good to be true? It was. 
Within 10 minutes, it all went awry. 
The creators took the $3.36 million 
invested into the coin until Nov. 1 and 
vanished. The coin was reduced to a 
valuation of less than a third of a cent 
in value; the holders were left gaping 
at the speed and scale of the “rug 
pull.”
In hindsight, there were red flags 
throughout SQUID’s short lifetime. 
The value of SQUID never went 
down. There were also complaints 
about people being unable to sell any 

tokens. This was initially attributed to 
the anti-dump mechanism described 
by the creators. It also never had 
any connection to the Netflix show. 
Despite all of this, many people 
blindly bought into SQUID trying to 
chase the next big thing.
Squid Game perfectly encapsulates 
everything that’s wrong with the fast-
growing cryptocurrency market. 
Cryptocurrencies are mostly driven 
by market excitement. A problem 
arises when those feelings aren’t 
backed by sound fundamentals.
I’ve already mentioned Dogecoin a 
few times in this piece, and it’s worth 
delving into it for a bit. Dogecoin was 
created back in 2013 as a joke, meant 
to poke fun at the then-speculative 
cryptocurrency 
market. 
Unlike 
Bitcoin, whose value in large part 
derives from its limited supply, 
Dogecoin could technically have 
an infinite supply. Until the start of 
2021, its value never went above a 
cent. Yet, in the aftermath of the r/
WallStreetBets 
GameStop 
saga, 
Dogecoin started rising inexplicably, 
so much so that celebrities such 
as Elon Musk took notice with his 
tweets, further fueling its growth. 
After peaking in May, it started 
falling again, settling now at around a 
quarter dollar.w
Cryptocurrencies, even the more 
well-known and sound ones, are 
extremely volatile. Cryptocurrency 
advocates will tell you about how their 
decentralized nature prevents any 
central entity from influencing the 
valuation of the currency. However, 
in their current form, they are still 
easily manipulated. Elon Musk, for 

instance, tweeted his reservations 
against 
Bitcoin’s 
environmental 
impact. The damage was immediate. 
Bitcoin’s value would dip by more 
than $10,000 in the coming days. You 
don’t have to be a Musk-level celebrity 
either to impact valuations. There are 
many groups that work to orchestrate 
pump-and-dump schemes wherein 
the whole group invests in a 
cryptocurrency of their choosing at 
once. This generates a buzz around it 
that drives other investors to invest in 
it. As the value of the cryptocurrency 
rises, more investors flock to it. 
When the group is satisfied with the 
growth of the cryptocurrency, they 
sell their holdings rapidly, triggering 
a dramatic fall in the valuation of 
cryptocurrency.
Cryptocurrency’s 
nature 
as 
something 
that 
is 
outside 
governmental regulations acts as 
a double-edged sword here. While 
some praise it for being free of 
government interference, it also 
lacks all legal consumer protections. 
This often means that in the event of 
a scam, consumers have little to no 
legal recourse.
I’m 
certainly 
not 
going 
to 
discourage anyone from investing 
in cryptocurrency if they so choose. 
I personally don’t because it doesn’t 
align with my risk tolerance. There’s 
a certain level of volatility with even 
the more stable cryptocurrencies, so 
it is crucial to do your research before 
investing. Only invest as much as you 
can afford to lose. And never blindly 
“hold” on a quest to send prices to 
“the moon.” You might get the rug 
pulled out from under you.

I
n 2020, the first and most intense 
year of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
daily life in our society underwent 
significant 
changes. 
These 
adaptations were part of what many 
believed to be a “new normal” that 
would persist as long as — if not longer 
than — the pandemic itself. Some 
developments have been widely 
considered positive. Unnecessary 
meetings were canceled or adapted 
into emails. Long commutes were 
often eliminated. Many families 
found themselves spending more 
time together. Despite the rapidly 
worsening state of public health, 
perhaps there were a few silver 
linings in this new normal.
Such was not the case for spectator 
sports and fans. With restrictions on 
large gatherings, live audiences were 
prevented from attending sporting 
events, and after long periods 
of complete shutdown, seasons 
were either canceled altogether or 
resumed in vacuum environments 
free of fans. Players across various 
sports noticed the difference in 
the atmosphere and the ways in 
which empty arenas impacted the 
games. Fans waxed poetic about 
missing the experience of attending 
live competitions and witnessing 
athletic history. These audience-
free environments were a necessary 
alteration during the height of the 
pandemic, but all parties wished for 
the conditions which would allow 
sports and the broader community a 
return to normalcy.
With 
COVID-19 
cases 
decreasing as a result of widespread 
immunization, 
spectators 
have 
started to trickle back into stadiums, 
and fan bases could not be happier. 
The sights and sounds of tens of 

thousands of raucous people reacting 
to every play could never be replaced 
by artificial crowd noise, and being 
part of a team’s home-field advantage 
is a magical feeling for fans of all ages. 
The return of fans has increased 
both the quality and stakes of each 
game played. The NFL, for one, has 
repeatedly called 2021 its “biggest 
season ever,” as the return of fans 
across the league and the addition of 
a 17th game for each team combine to 
ceremoniously usher in the future of 
the sport.
Nowhere has this comeback borne 
out more evidently than at Michigan 
Stadium, where spectators have 
enthusiastically returned after a 2020 
season that left many fans feeling 
as empty as the bleachers at the Big 
House. As the largest stadium in 
North America and the third-largest 
in the world, the complete absence 
of fans could not be more unnatural. 
In normal times, those in attendance 
at Michigan football games are 
reminded 
by 
announcer 
Carl 
Grapentine that they are part of the 
“largest crowd watching a football 
game anywhere in America today,” 
a fact which carries special weight 
after a year in which crowds were 
robbed of the electric atmosphere 
of Michigan football. U-M fans 
certainly appear refreshed upon 
their return, with their spirited game 
day traditions, such as the crowd’s 
inspired singing of The Killers’ “Mr. 
Brightside,” 
garnering 
national 
attention.
For those who already had the 
chance to be part of college fandom 
before the pandemic struck, the 
removal of fans from sporting events 
made for yet another tough blow. 
Taking in a game at the Big House, 
Crisler Center, Yost Ice Arena or 
anywhere else on campus is a one-
of-a-kind experience and practically 
a rite of passage for U-M students. 

With boisterous collective chants, 
seas of maize and blue apparel 
and the exceptional performances 
of 
U-M 
student-athletes, 
the 
environment is unparalleled. After 
a year of watching from our couches 
as U-M teams achieve greatness, 
students and fans have found an 
even greater appreciation for simply 
being present.
Athletes often explain their love 
for team-oriented sport through 
an appreciation for being part of 
something greater than themselves. 
The same can be said for fans, who 
dedicate their time, resources and 
energy to the teams they adore. Their 
cheers, whether stemming from 
euphoria or exasperation, are what 
make spectator sporting events the 
popular rituals they are. Research 
has shown that the presence and 
energy of a live audience often affect 
the performance of athletes and 
may exert notable influence on the 
outcome of a game. Home court 
advantage exists and can certainly 
prove powerful. 
After a year in which people 
felt more socially isolated than 
ever before, the enthusiasm for 
live sports comes as no surprise. 
Despite the lingering of COVID-
19, many of those with a love for 
their teams and competition simply 
cannot remain on the sidelines any 
longer. It once seemed improbable 
for crowds to come back to arenas 
this year, or perhaps for even longer. 
Now, scientific developments and 
necessary precautions have assured 
that in-person sports attendance is 
back and likely here to stay, and it 
is beautiful to see athletes and fans 
coming together once again. For 
those able to attend who haven’t 
gotten in on the action, there’s no 
better time to get in the game and 
be a part of something bigger than 
oneself.

O
n Oct. 27, the Wall Street Journal 
published a letter to the editor 
from former President Donald Trump 
regarding an editorial that the paper 
had previously published which stated 
that he lost Pennsylvania by 80,555 
votes. In his letter, Trump reasserted 
that the 2020 election was fraudulent, 
rigged and corrupt, and therefore 
The Journal’s editorial was incorrect. 
After publication, some objected to 
The Journal publishing this letter at 
all, leading the newspaper to publish 
a statement on their decision. This 
statement conveyed their belief that 
their readers could come to their own 
conclusions, and then debunked some 
of the lies that Trump wrote in his 
letter. 
Personally, I don’t think that 
The Journal should have published 
Trump’s letter. Lies should not be 
tolerated in newspapers, especially 
not in one of the most reputable 
newspapers in the country. Allowing 
a lie of this magnitude to be published 
as an opinion piece in a paper with 
this level of prestige legitimizes it in 
a way that a tweet or a Facebook post 
does not. But, in their piece defending 
publishing the letter, The Journal’s 
editorial board raised points worthy 
of consideration. For example, Trump 
says these things elsewhere, and 
trying to censor him doesn’t hinder his 
ability to share these views. It begs the 
question — what should the role of an 
opinion page be in publishing speech 
that is deemed offensive or blatantly 
false?
Traditionally, 
opinion 
pages 
publish pieces from two main sources: 
people who are hired to write for the 
paper (columnists or editorial board 

members) and people who write as 
guests — they typically write guest 
op-eds or letters to the editor. The 
purpose of guest op-eds is to highlight 
perspectives of those who do not write 
for the paper. The purpose of letters 
to the editor is to allow members of a 
paper’s audience to engage with their 
content, whether that engagement is 
in support or criticism. 
Many newspapers allow for a 
wide variety of people with a range 
of opinions to write op-eds in their 
opinion sections, including people 
who many would consider as having 
values that are antithetical to a 
democratic society. For example, The 
New York Times has published op-eds 
from Russian President Vladimir 
Putin and Taliban deputy leader 
Sirajuddin Haqqani, both of whom 
are enemies of the United States. The 
Times also published an op-ed by Sen. 
Tom Cotton, R-Ark., in June 2020 that 
called for the president to send in the 
military to combat Black Lives Matter 
protests. 
Readers reacted strongly (and 
negatively) to the op-eds by Haqqani 
and Cotton, and for good reason — 
Haqqani has been involved in strikes 
that have killed American soldiers 
and Afghani citizens, and Cotton’s 
position is un-American at best and 
fascist at worst. But do our opinions 
and feelings about these beliefs and 
these people mean that we shouldn’t 
hear about them? Putin, Haqqani and 
Cotton are three people who matter. 
The actions of Putin and Haqqani 
directly influence American foreign 
policy. Cotton is a U.S. senator, and has 
aspirations to be the president of the 
United States. Their views have a real 
impact on the way the world works 
and for that, we’re better off knowing 
what they think, as appalling as their 
opinions may be.

Readers of The Journal and 
The Times rightfully want to hear 
nuanced, informed opinions in their 
newspapers, not lies and un-American 
rants. But it might be even more 
important that these readers hear 
these opinions, no matter how scary 
or deluded they are. While some may 
prefer to ignore it, others may want 
to learn more about the sentiments 
expressed by Haqqani or Cotton. That 
doesn’t mean that anyone should be 
able to write an op-ed about such a 
topic. But, since all three men have the 
ability to make their ideas into policy 
or social norms, it’s necessary that the 
public is aware of what their ideas are. 
The distinction between the pieces 
The Times published and the letter 
to the editor that Trump wrote is 
that the Times pieces were opinions, 
meaning that readers could oppose 
them on the basis of disagreement, 
but couldn’t dismiss them as wholly 
untrue. Trump’s letter was based 
on lies, which made it unfit to be in a 
newspaper. To me, this is where the 
line should be drawn — media sources 
should not, as a matter of ethics, 
publish something that is based on 
clear falsehoods. 
We can disagree with Putin, 
Haqqani and Cotton on the basis of 
their ideas, but a lack of decency or 
adherence to democratic ideals cannot 
be disparaged in the same way as 
lies. Knowledge of the opinions and 
ideas of important policymakers and 
figureheads — told from their own 
perspective — is necessary in order 
to combat bad or dangerous ideas. 
Opinion pages have an obligation 
to publish a diversity of opinions, 
even when those opinions will be 
unpopular with readers. But readers 
should not have to read unchecked 
falsehoods directly from the mouth of 
their main purveyor.

Come late November, the Michigan 
fanbase is used to singing the same 
melancholy song: 
There’s always next year. 
But, as the Wolverines have espoused 
since the first day of the 
season, this year — and 
this team — is different. 
On Saturday, when 
Michigan led Ohio State 
at the half, fans started 
to believe that it could be 
true. The 14-13 score was 
hardly an indication of 
the dominance to come, 
but rather a hint that 
this time, maybe, their confidence wasn’t 
misplaced. 
The momentum in the stands continued 
to grow with each ensuing touchdown. 
When 
senior 
running 
back 
Hassan 
Haskins brought the score to 34-20 with a 
touchdown early in the fourth quarter — his 
fourth of the day — the feeling turned from 
excitement to one of surreal acceptance. 
Fans might not have to wait any longer. 
By the time Haskins ran into the end 
zone with the Wolverines’ sixth and final 
touchdown with just over two minutes 

left on the clock, the spots of red began to 
disappear from the stadium as Ohio State 
fans tried to avoid the inevitable. Michigan 
was going to win and the field would fill 
with maize and blue. 
The fanbase that has sustained itself 
on blind hope and willpower for nearly a 
decade has finally gotten what it wants: a 
win against Ohio State. 
But what happens from here? 
When you’ve already surpassed your 
own bar for success, how do you gauge what 
comes after? It’s a question Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh has surely had to ask himself 
several times this year. 
“Just everything about the team,” 
Harbaugh said. “Every day, every week, 
every month. Going back to the beginning of 
this year, it’s always felt like the beginning. 
Accomplish one goal then go to the next and 
the next and the next.”
Coming 
into 
the 
season 
carrying 
mediocre expectations, the Wolverines 
have raised their ceiling with each win. On 
Saturday, they shattered it completely. 
The win opened doors for the remainder 
of the season, doors Harbaugh has never 
walked through. A Big Ten Championship 
and College Football Playoff berth are well 

within reach. 
It’s been said before every 
big game in Harbaugh’s 
seven-year tenure, but this 
time the notion rings true 
more than ever:
This is very possibly 
the turning point in the 
Harbaugh era, the moment 
the 
former-Michigan 
quarterback 
has 
been 
waiting for, a chance to 
elevate 
this 
program 
into the upper echelon of 
college football. 
Or it could be a repeat 
of 2011, a good team and a 
good season that ended one 
Ohio State drought just to 
start another. 
The difference between this being a 
different Michigan team and a different 
Michigan program will be decided in the 
coming weeks. 
A different Michigan team can end the 
season 11-2 with a win over the Buckeyes and 
an appearance at a Big Ten Championship. 
A different Michigan program has to prove 
to recruits that Harbaugh has made good 

on his promise and made the Wolverines a 
real national contender. That would mean 
capturing the program’s first Big Ten 
Championship since 2004 and notching its 
first-ever berth in the playoff. 
When Harbaugh said in his postgame 
press conference that this felt more like the 
beginning than the culmination, this was 
what he meant. Michigan has moved past 
its biggest hurdle under Harbaugh — and its 

largest barrier to success 
since the turn of the 
century — opening a whole 
new box of challenges. 
There’s 
a 
different 
feeling about this team, 
obviously. 
If 
anyone 
can 
pass 
through 
the 
challenges ahead, it’s this 
team. A team that’s kept its 
fans on their feet and sent 
them out onto the field at 
the end of the game. 
And 
players 
feel 
confident that they can 
keep it going. 
“Long term, we’ve set 
the 
expectation 
now,” 
junior quarterback Cade 
McNamara said. “It’s been 
so long since we beat Ohio State, but we did 
that today. For the guys coming back, now 
we’ve got to do that every single year. We 
know what it took.”
The Wolverines proved they knew what 
it took to turn the page on Ohio State. In the 
coming weeks, we will find out if they have 
what it takes to start a whole new chapter of 
Michigan football.

All season, this Michigan team has had an 
identity: run the ball. 
With two players at the center of that ethos, 
sophomore Blake Corum and senior Hassan 
Haskins, the ‘thunder and lightning’ running 
back duo became a bellwether for the offense. 
On Saturday, Haskins led the Wolverines’ to 
a 42-27 victory over Ohio State.
His performance, which totaled 169 yards 
on 28 attempts for five touchdowns, will go 
down in the record books — it’s the most rushing 
touchdowns in The Game’s history, as well as 
tying Michigan’s all-time single-game record.

But his historic performance went beyond 
the stat sheet. 
Haskins dictated the pace of the game from 
the very start. He touched the ball on five of nine 
plays, including three 3rd-and-short downs. In 
those three downs he ran for 35 yards total, 
keeping a crucial opening drive alive, a drive 
that ended with the only Michigan touchdown 
Haskins wouldn’t take in himself.
His quick cuts found holes and broke 
through a Buckeye defense that had yet to 
stack the box, demoralizing a defense that held 
Heisman candidate Kenneth Walker III to just 
28 rushing yards a week ago. Yet when Ohio 
State adjusted, stacking the box, Haskins still 
found a way to fall forward. 
“They thought they saw a ghost but it was 

number 25, Hassan Haskins,” Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh said. “He has great 
determination, great purpose. Creatability.”
On a crucial drive to reestablish itself 
in the game, down 10-7, Michigan faced a 
fourth-and-one. Following a timeout, the 
Wolverines set up in a three tight-end set 
with Haskins in the backfield. Clearly, there 
was one place the ball would end up. Yet after 
a push and a twist, the chains moved and the 
drive stayed alive.
Four plays later, Haskins dove over a pile to 
stretch the ball in for his first touchdown of the 
afternoon. Michigan never trailed again. 
“It was a big emphasis to be able to run the 
ball this week,” fifth-year offensive lineman 
Andrew Stueber said. “We thought that a lot 

of teams came out and played a little scared 
against them, a little timid, and that’s just not 
Michigan football. That’s not what we like to 
play as an o-line, as Michigan football, as a run 
game, as a unit.”
As time wound down in the end of 
the game, Haskins played an even bigger 
part. Up eight with just 14 minutes left, 
the Wolverines needed to accomplish two 
things: drain clock and score. So they turned 
to Haskins. A nine-play, four-and-a-half-
minute drive featured eight runs, six of them 
from Haskins. 
In one instance, he showed his patience, 
waiting behind a wall of blockers before finding 
a hole and darting for six yards. Other times, 
he showed his innate ability to fall forward, 

turning a five yard rush into an eight-yard rush 
and keeping the chains moving. 
On its last drive of the game, Michigan 
needed to move the sticks twice in order to ice 
out Ohio State. Haskins listed off five rushes 
for 63 yards through a humiliated Buckeye 
defense, sealing the game. 
At the beginning of the season, it seemed as 
though the Wolverines’ reliance on its rushing 
game would be a hindrance against the best 
teams in the country. Against an explosive 
Ohio State offense? There was no question, 
Michigan would fail to keep pace.
Instead, on Saturday, as Haskins walked in 
for his fifth touchdown, it became clear that 
this Wolverine running offense is capable of 
dominating just about everyone.

With historic day, Hassan Haskins guides Michigan to victory

Despite first-round projections in the 
NFL Draft last season, senior edge rusher 
Aidan Hutchinson returned to Michigan 
for one reason: to beat Ohio State.
“I told you guys at Big Ten Media Days 
that we were emphasizing this game more,” 
Hutchinson said. “Everyone seemed to have 
a lot of questions about that, in terms of how 
we were doing it, but I told you to trust me, 
we were doing it.”
He was right — pretty much nobody 
outside Schembechler Hall bought his 
optimism. It wasn’t Hutchinson’s own 
abilities that people doubted; it was the 

ability of his team to actually beat the 
Buckeyes. At the start of the season, national 
media gave the Wolverines no shot in 
The Game. This publication unanimously 
picked Ohio State.
And still, Hutchinson persisted. On 
Tuesday, he reiterated that the Buckeyes 
had been a focus since January. He opined 
that, while a lot of teams play Ohio State 
“fearful,” his defense would have no 
fear against the Buckeyes’ top-ranked 

offense. Once again, no one listened — this 
publication included, of course.
Saturday, though, Hutchinson realized 
his vision. In the fifth-ranked Wolverines’ 
42-27 upset of the second-ranked Buckeyes, 
he recorded three sacks — including his 13th 
of the season, which set the Michigan all-
time record — on Ohio State quarterback 
and Heisman frontrunner C.J. Stroud. 
Over those three-and-a-half hours, 
as the Wolverines solidified themselves 
as a legitimate College Football Playoff 
contender, Hutchinson himself solidified 
his position as one of college football’s 
top players, and maybe even stole some of 
Stroud’s hype along the way. 
“(Hutchinson’s) performance was … 
dominant,” Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
said. “Single-season 
sack record already — 
definitely should be in 
strong consideration 
for 
the 
Heisman 
Trophy.”
In every moment 
where the Wolverines 
needed a play from 
their 
defense, 
Hutchinson 
was 
there to deliver it. 
After a first quarter 
interception sparked 
a long Buckeyes drive 
and a 3rd-and-goal 
at Michigan’s eight, 
Hutchinson recorded 
his first sack and 
forced Ohio State into a field goal. That stop 
preserved the Wolverines’ one-score lead 
and helped the team carry its momentum 
into the second quarter. 
In the third quarter, with Michigan 
nursing an eight-point lead and the 
Buckeyes again finding some rhythm 
offensively, Hutchinson notched another 
sack that forced Ohio State to punt. On 
the next defensive possession, with the 
Wolverines up 15, he recorded another sack. 

Even when he wasn’t sacking Stroud, 
Hutchinson’s 
drive 
was 
present 
on 
virtually every defensive snap. On one 
fourth down, as the Buckeyes worked to 
mount a comeback, Hutchinson was seen 
visibly jawing with the left tackle prior 
to the snap. As soon as Stroud took the 
snap, Hutchinson ran directly over the 
lineman into the backfield (Ohio State 
still converted, thanks to a borderline 
miraculous throw from Stroud).
Even beyond the Heisman comments, 
Harbaugh continued to sing Hutchinson’s 
praises after the game. He named him 
among a group of players he called the 
“foundation” of the team — players who had 
been with Michigan through the struggles 
of 2020 and beyond and refused to give in. 
“If there was a train, like a locomotive 
going down the tracks, they literally stopped 
it, picked it up onto their backs, turned it 
around and started pushing,” Harbaugh 
said. “(Saturday), the rest of us started 
pushing, too.”
More 
than 
anything, 
though, 
Hutchinson’s performance represents a 
clean resolution to a truly historic Michigan 
career. An athlete raised in Wolverine 
tradition — his father, Chris Hutchinson, 
was a Michigan captain and All-American 
defensive lineman in the early ’90s — 
Hutchinson had already achieved just 
about every individual accolade he could 
hope for entering Saturday. Like countless 
Wolverine greats in recent years, he only 
lacked the elusive win over the Buckeyes. 
Saturday, he sat grinning and shaking 
his head at the postgame press conference, 
as if in disbelief of what his team had just 
achieved. With his Michigan journey 
almost complete, he allowed himself to 
reflect on that sack record and the elusive 
rivalry win:
“Man. It was crazy. I can’t really put it 
into words. I really just wanted to beat my 
dad, and I went a little farther. It’s so cool, 
and it’s a moment I can’t wait to share (with) 
my dad.”

At last, Aidan Hutchinson has his moment

Following a thorough, dominant victory 
over Ohio State — the most important win in 
his seven-year tenure as Michigan coach — Jim 
Harbaugh went home. 
He spent the night surrounded by family, 
commemorating his parents’ 60th wedding 
anniversary. Festivities included watching 
football, as they “always do,” and a few episodes 
of “Heartland” with his daughter.
Then Harbaugh went to sleep. On to Iowa. 
“The thing that hits me first is that this is a 
new beginning,” Harbaugh said on Sunday. 
“(We want to do) what we always do. We 
prepare, we practice, we try to have great 
days. One good day of meetings, practices, get 
ourselves healthy, get ourselves ready and go 
play the game.” 
That’s a mentality that Michigan has stuck 
to throughout the season, one instilled by 
Harbaugh. 
But as much as that quote feels familiar, 
something about Harbaugh seemed different. 
He conducted the press conference like a man 
who just had a burden lifted from his shoulders. 
He was downright giddy recounting his 
postgame interaction with Juwan Howard, 
laughing that the moment was “so cool.” He 
rattled off the congratulatory messages that 
flooded his phone, highlighting a memorable 
text from John Madden, who lauded the 
Wolverines’ offensive line for one of the best 
performances he’s ever seen. 
“They really like our team,” Harbaugh said 
of the common thread through the messages. 
“They really like how hard our players play. 
Kinda that’s been the theme. Comes through 
the TV set. See a bunch of guys that really like 
playing the game and playing the game the way 
it’s supposed to be played.” 
The “new beginning” phrase also speaks to 
his refined mindset. Harbaugh is cognizant of 
the implications looming this weekend, just as 
he was aware of the stakes against Ohio State. 

Remaining levelheaded is difficult following 
a victory of such emotional magnitude. These 
situations are conducive for letdowns. 
That’s why, when Harbaugh thinks about 
the pending Big Ten Championship Game, he 
is reminded of the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey 
team. The group famously stunned the heavily 
favored Soviet Union, but still needed one 
more victory to secure the goal medal. The 
Americans finished the job, rallying from a 2-1 
deficit to defeat Finland. 
Harbaugh wants the Wolverines to follow 
their lead. 
“This is the championship this week,” 
Harbaugh said. “This week, that’s for all the 
marbles. That’s for the championship. It’s 
a continuation of the playoffs. … That’s the 
message towards the team this week.” 
Harbaugh carried that out in his press 
conference. He showed appreciation for Kirk 
Ferentz and his Iowa team, noting that there’s 
“pretty much no one” he respects more. 
And though Michigan opened as 10.5-point 
favorites, he’s not overlooking the Hawkeyes, 
either. 
“We know how good Iowa is,” Harbaugh 
said. “What stands out is how good and 
conscious they are in all three phases — offense, 
defense, special teams.” 
As Harbaugh flipped the page to Iowa, he 
allowed for moments of reflection, too. He 
thought back to the spring, when he realized 
the potential of this collection of players and 
coaches that no one else saw. 
“That’s one of those feelings that you have, 
and the guys start feeling it too,” Harbaugh 
said. “… The comments back then were, ‘Well, 
everybody says that.’ But we felt it.” 
And against Ohio State, they sure did show 
it. Now, if the Wolverines can do so one more 
time, they’ll be Big Ten champions. 
“Maybe we were better prepared, maybe 
we were stronger, maybe we were more 
talented, a lot of factors there,” Harbaugh 
said, reflecting on the victory. “The fact is that 
we’re here. We’re excited about it. We want to 
go finish.”

‘We want to go finish’: Harbaugh, 
Michigan begin shifting focus to Iowa

ALLISON ENGKVIST/Daily 

MADELINE HINKLEY/Daily 


Sitting behind the podium after the Michigan 

football team’s win over No. 2 Ohio State on 

Saturday, Jim Harbaugh took a moment to look 

around.

Usually, his press conferences strike the same 

somber, frustrated, dejected chords after games 

against the Buckeyes. But when Harbaugh’s well-

documented 0-5 record against his arch rival 

changed during Saturday’s 42-27 victory, so did 

No. 5 Michigan’s season outlook.

And Harbaugh’s tone followed suit.

“The way it feels now, it feels like the beginning,” 

Harbaugh said.

Asked to elaborate, Harbaugh pointed to the 

formative days of the 2021 team. 

“Just everything about the team,” Harbaugh 

said. “Every day, every week, every month. Going 

back to the beginning of this year, it’s always felt 

like the beginning. Accomplish one goal then go to 

the next and the next and the next.”

He’s not wrong. But he’s certainly underselling 

the implications.

For the Wolverines, Saturday was more 

program-altering than season-altering. In a 

three-hour span, Michigan upended its national 

perception with its first win over Ohio State 

since 2011. No longer are the Wolverines a former 

powerhouse gone stagnant. No longer is Harbaugh 

the epitome of a coach that can’t get over the hump.

Long-lasting implications are sure to follow on 

the field and recruiting trail. More importantly, 

though, there’s a new generation of Michigan 

football players who have reached the summit. In 

that sense, it truly is the rebirth of a program — and 

a purpose that no longer seems hollow.

From an outsider’s perspective, it was hard 

to take claims of added emphasis on Ohio State 

seriously given the rivalry’s recent results. But 

within Schembechler Hall, a “What are you doing 

to beat Ohio State today?” sign already proudly 

hangs. Since January, players have asked the 

question of themselves every day.

Now, they know the answer.

“Long term, we’ve set the expectation now,” 

junior quarterback Cade McNamara said. “It’s 

been so long since we beat Ohio State, but we did 

that today. For the guys coming back, now we’ve 

got to do that every single year. We know what it 

took.”

Harbaugh spent the first six years of his tenure 

selling a plan to overtake the Buckeyes. But year after 

year, the Saturday after Thanksgiving repeatedly 

proved it was nothing more than an empty vision. 

He cycled through multiple coordinators on both 

sides of the ball and built teams rooted in almost a 

half-dozen different schemes.

That is, until he found himself this past winter.

In the days and weeks after the Wolverines’ 

2020 season careened to an end, it looked like 

Harbaugh’s tenure might follow suit. But a school-

friendly contract with a unique buyout structure 

and incentive-laden salary kept him at his alma 

mater. Michigan athletic director Warde Manuel 

seemingly dared Harbaugh to break through, 

to bring the Wolverines to the upper echelon of 

college football. 

So Harbaugh took a look in the mirror. He 

overhauled the program’s coaching staff and 

culture, delivering a much-needed youth infusion.

From an Xs and Os standpoint, Harbaugh 

has rediscovered himself. In an era of up-tempo, 

no-huddle spread offenses, he and offensive 

coordinator Josh Gattis have gone against the 

grain in 2021. They’ve relied on run-first football 

and 20th-century offensive line fundamentals.

On the other side of the ball, hiring 34-year-

old Mike Macdonald — a first-time defensive 

coordinator — marked a clear departure from 

Harbaugh’s previous philosophy of relying 

on coaching experience. But on Saturday, 

Macdonald’s defense kept the Buckeyes’ offense 

off-balance with a mix of coverages and disguised 

pass rushes.

Harbaugh has always been a non-

conformist, but the 2021 Wolverines take that 

to an extreme.

And on Saturday, all of it was validated.

“You guys should’ve seen him in the locker 

room after the game,” fifth-year offensive 

lineman Andrew Stueber said. “I’ve never seen 

him more happy, more excited. … He’s gone 

through some tough times, he’s faced a lot of 

adversity since he’s been the coach here. To see 

him finally beat Ohio State, as a team, as a unit, 

we knew what this team was capable of, and it all 

starts with him.”

Saturday’s win opens doors Michigan has 

yet to experience under Harbaugh. For the first 

time, the Wolverines will play for a Big Ten 

Championship and College Football Playoff berth 

in Indianapolis.

However, that indication pales in comparison 

to the fact that this might be permanent. In its 

biggest game of the season, in a year full of tests, 

Michigan finally created its own narrative. Led 

by a quirky, unapologetically authentic coach, 

the Wolverines had their own coming out 

party on Saturday. 

“This is one (celebration) that’ll go long into 

the night,” Harbaugh said.

The program-shaping implications, on the 

other hand, will last a whole lot longer.

For Jim Harbaugh, this win opens new doors for his program
