ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

About 
200 
community 
members 
and 
students 
attended 
the 
Let’s 
End 
Sexual 
Assault 
Summit 
on 
Tuesday 
at 
Eastern 
Michigan University which 
featured a keynote speech 
by 
Governor 
Gretchen 
Whitmer. In its second year, 
the event included a full day 
of discussions, panels and 
break-out sessions on how 
to address sexual assault. 
During 
her 
speech, 
Whitmer 
reflected 
on 

her dedication to moving 
sexual assault prevention 
legislation onto the state 
Senate floor, as well as 
sharing 
her 
personal 
connection 
with 
the 
movement. Whitmer shared 
she was sexually assaulted 
as a college freshman and 
now, as a survivor, she 
plans to make sure the same 
doesn’t happen to any other 
young people on college 
campuses. 
She noted how one in 
five women, one in 16 men 
and one in four transgender 
or 
non-binary 
students 
will be sexually assaulted 
while in college. Whitmer 

added the statistic does 
not communicate the pain 
felt by survivors, and it can 
often take years to share 
one’s story of sexual assault. 
“I’ve 
been 
outspoken 
about my sexual assault for 
years now, but it took me a 
long time to get there: over 
two decades to find the 
courage to tell my story,” 
Whitmer said.
Whitmer described her 
first public address of her 
sexual assault on the Senate 
floor in 2013 during the 
discussion of a proposed 
rape insurance bill which 
would 
discontinue 
the 
eligibility of coverage for 

any 
rape-related 
health 
concerns, no matter the 
circumstance. 
Whitmer 
hoped that by telling her 
narrative, senators would 
be able to see just how many 
people this proposed bill 
would affect. 
“(The bill) even applied 
to rape survivors who’d 
been impregnated by their 
attacker. It told women in 
Michigan, you have to plan 
ahead for the unplannable,” 
Whitmer said. “And they 
wouldn’t even let women or 
doctors testify during the 
debate of the bill.” 

 For Astronomy 104, LSA 
sophomore 
Katie 
Charlic 
had 
to 
purchase 
“Alien 
Skies: A Travelogue of the 
Universe.” The book, which 
retails on Barnes & Noble’s 
website for upwards of $130, 
was written by astronomy 
professor 
Mario 
Mateo, 
who teaches the course. 
Charlic stopped reading 
the book part way through 
the 
course 
because 
she 
found the lectures provided 
identical 
information 
to 
what was presented in the 
book. She only referenced 
the book when homework 
questions required students 
to look at a specific chart or 
photo inside. In her eyes, 
she paid $200 for a few 
homework questions.
“You’re having to pay 
hundreds 
of 
dollars 
on 
top of the tuition price, 
which is really hard for a 
lot of people, especially 
those that are taking out 
loans or on a scholarship,” 
Charlic said. “It feels like 
you’re just putting money in 
their pocket, which you’re 
already doing by paying 
tuition here.”

Tuesday’s sixth annual Giving 
Blueday, a 24-hour fundraising 
campaign for the University of 
Michigan coinciding with the 
global philanthropic movement 
Giving Tuesday, raised $4,242,531 
from 15,887 gifts, according to a 
University press release.
The donations will go toward 
supporting hundreds of different 
causes such as colleges, programs, 
scholarships, 
research 
and 
organizations — including more 
than 150 student organizations — 
across the Ann Arbor, Flint and 
Dearborn campuses.
To 
encourage 
engagement 
throughout the day, the Giving 
Blueday campaign featured a 
variety of challenges and donation-
matching initiatives. For example, 
students who donated $25 or more 
to any program or cause received a 
match of $25, up to a maximum of 
$50,000 total cap, distributed on a 
first-come first-serve basis. More 
than a dozen causes, including the 
Program on Intergroup Relations 
and 
Department 
of 
Urology

$4 million for causes 
across all three campuses

Students question ethics 
of instructors assigning 
self- authored textbooks

At 
Central 
Student 
Government’s 
weekly 
assembly, CSG vice president 
Isabelle Blanchard, an LSA 
senior, announced she will 
resign from her position on 
CSG on the last day of the 
semester. 
“This 
decision 
has 
not 
been an easy one, and I have 
struggled 
with 
feelings 
of 
guilt during this time, as I do 
not want to let anyone down,” 
Blanchard said. “However, it 
has become increasingly clear 
that the time commitment 
and demands of the role are 
placing an undue amount of 
pressure on myself, negatively 
impacting my mental health. 
With the current state of my 
well-being, it would be unfair 
to the student body to continue 
in this role.”
Blanchard 
added 
she 

felt it was important to be 
transparent about her decision 
to prioritize her mental health. 
“I wanted to be genuine 
with you all about the impact 
of this work on my well-being, 
because I believe that, as 
student leaders, you expect 
honesty from me, and that we 
should model caring for our 
physical and mental health and 
well-being,” Blanchard said. 
Ben Gerstein, CSG President 
and 
Public 
Policy 
senior, 
released a statement regarding 
Blanchard’s resignation.
“The 
task 
of 
leading 
a 
48,000+ student body is one of 
great intensity that demands 
significant personal sacrifice,” 
the statement said. “I, and all 
of CSG, are incredibly proud of 
the work Isabelle has done. Her 
contributions to the University 
of Michigan have not gone 
unnoticed. 

The 
Lieberthal-Rogel 
Center for Chinese Studies at 
the University of Michigan 
hosted Susan Shirk, chair of 
the 21st Century China Center 
and research professor at the 
University of California, San 
Diego, for a discussion of the 
current 
tensions 
between 
the United States and China 
Tuesday 
at 
Weiser 
Hall. 

About 50 people attended the 
discussion of the overreach and 
overreactions of both Chinese 
and American foreign policy.
Shirk said in the last two 
decades 
the 
Chinese 
and 
American governments have 
had strained relations similar 
to the relationship between the 
United States and the U.S.S.R. 
“It’s very, very different,” 
Shirk said. “But it has a lot 
of the same intense, mutual 
suspicion and hostility that 

we had during the Cold War, 
as well as this ideological 
dimension and the clash of 
systems.” 
Shirk also discussed the 
reaction of both the Chinese 
and American governments to 
the tension between the two 
countries. 
“I 
do 
believe 
that 
the 
United States is overreacting 
to the perceived threat from 
China, and in the process, it’s 
harming itself,” Shirk said. “In 

particular, it’s the openness and 
vibrancy of our own economy 
and society, which are the 
ultimate sources of American 
strength and competitiveness.”
She 
said 
China’s 
overreaching has heightened 
fears of the “China threat” 
in 
America, 
sparking 
backlash that went beyond 
President 
Donald 
Trump’s 
administration.

Ann 
Arbor 
City 
Council 
representatives 
discussed 
a 
potential decision to transport 
the city’s recyclables to Lansing 
as opposed to redeveloping 
the city’s materials recovery 
facility 
at 
their 
meeting 
Monday night. 
Ann Arbor hasn’t had an 
operational MRF since 2016, 
when the facility was shut 
down due to safety concerns 
that emerged from overuse. In 
the interim, the city has been 
sending local recyclables 250 
miles away to be processed in a 
plant in Cincinnati.
Councilmember Jack Eaton, 
D-Ward 
4, 
supported 
the 
redeveloping the city’s MRF, 
explaining that when it was in 
full use, it provided benefits 
not only for Ann Arbor but 

for the surrounding region, as 
well. 
“Our MRF in the past has 
had bigger capacity than the 
city of Ann Arbor itself,” Eaton 
said. “And we took in materials 
from other (towns). So, having 
a MRF in our region allows 
other communities to use that 
facility.”
Councilmember Chip Smith, 
D-Ward 5, also expressed that 
the MRF’s reopening is the 
only viable long-term solution 
and that the greater community 
would prefer disposal of waste 
within the city, rather than 
its transportation to plants in 
Lansing or Cincinnati. 
“We were once a leader in 
this field… we made significant 
investments 
in 
our 
MRF,” 
Smith said. “We passed an 
environment bond in the early 
90s. All of this has been the 
community telling us time and 

time again, we want to do this 
work here. We continue to hear 
that. I have heard that loud 
and clear on the environmental 
commission.”
The 
move 
to 
transport 
recyclables to Lansing was 
also controversial as it would 
contradict the city’s October 
decision to declare a climate 
emergency. Councilmember Ali 
Ramlawi, D-Ward 5, explained 
that he has received concerns 
from the public about the 
detriments transporting waste 
across the state may have.
“It’s been made clear to 
me by the community, by the 
numerous emails that we’ve 
been receiving throughout our 
community, that this is more 
than just trying to find the best 
cost, you know, it’s not like, 
getting on Amazon and looking 
for the lowest price,” Ramlawi 
said. “There are other things 
that 
we’re 
looking 
for 
with having RAA stay our 
community partner.”
In 
addition 
to 
the 
discussion 
among 
councilmembers, 
several 
community activists gave 
their 
input 
during 
the 
public comment portion of 
the meeting.
Chris 
Vandenberg, 
a 
mechanical engineer and a 
lifelong Ann Arbor resident, 
was particularly concerned 
with 
the 
environmental 
consequences 
of 
transporting recyclables to 
Lansing.
“The current alternative, 
namely 
to 
transport 
recyclables to Lansing, has 
serious 
consequences 
of 
transportation 
emissions, 
increased 
contamination 
resulting in poor recovery 
and the burning of some 
materials,” 
Vandenberg 
said.
Vandenberg added that 
redeveloping 
the 
MRF 
would be a boon to the city’s 
economy and would be a 

viable investment in the future. 
“We have an opportunity to 
take our community and the 
city government’s vast and 
collective resources to nurture 
and rekindle the local MRF,” he 
said.
Ultimately, 
the 
council 
voted 9-2 to begin negotiations 
with Recycle Ann Arbor, with 
councilmembers 
Lumm 
and 
Hayner opposing. RAA has 
proposed either reopening the 
city’s plant or transporting 
recyclables 
to 
a 
plant 
in 
Southfield MI.
The next major topics of 
discussion were two proposed 
developments, one on 212 S. 
State Street and one on 616 
E. Washington Street. The 
structure on Washington was 
particularly 
controversial, 
as the proposal would be the 
tallest building proposed in 
decades, and would be located 
only a block away from the 
city’s 
historic 
State 
Street 
district. 
The 19-story building would 
be located behind the Michigan 
Theater and would be the 
tallest 
building 
constructed 
in Ann Arbor since the 1960s. 
While 
the 
building 
would 
exceed the city’s rules on 
downtown 
building 
height 
limits, developers would be 
permitted to go forward with 
construction due to the fact 
that 19 of the building’s 240 
units would be set aside for 
affordable 
housing. 
Solar 
panels to be installed on the 
new buildings will also increase 
the city’s solar production by 19 
percent.
Councilmember 
Zachary 
Ackerman, D-Ward 3, was in 
support of the Washington St. 
development, framing it as a 
benefit both to students and 
community members.

‘U’ offers response against lawsuit

Dec. 4, 1997
University officials claimed 
the 
lawsuit 
challenging 
the 
admissions policies of the College 
of Literature, Science & Arts is 
invalid and requested a dismissal 
of the case yesterday.
In its official answer to the 
complaint, the University said 
that while plaintiffs Jennifer 
Gratz and Patrick Hamacher 
received rejection letters, they 
were offered a place on the 
extended waitlist. Neither Gratz 
nor Hamacher responded to the 
offer and therefore were not 
placed on the waitlist and were 
not considered lher for admission.
Vice President for University 
Relations Walter Harrison said 

that Gratz and Hamacher may 
not have proper legal standing 
because they waived their right 
to be placed on the extended 
waitlist.
“The question here is, did the 
two plaintiffs exhaust all of the 
possibilities to be admitted to the
University?” Harrison said. 
“In our response, we are pointing 
out that they each received these 
letters and they chose not to do 
that.”
While 
Hamacher 
admitted 
to not responding to the offer to 
join the extended waitlist, he said 
he received notice of the waitlist 
option too late in the summer to 
change his plans.
“We got the letter in April or 

May,” Hamacher said. “It was 
too late to do anything. I didn’t 
feel that it was a good idea to wait 
until July or August to find out.
“I received a letter that said 
very few people on the extended 
waitlist receive admittance and it 
said to make other plans for the 
fall,’ he said.
In its answer, the University 
states that “the defendants pray 
for a judgment dismissing the 
complaint with prejudice and 
awarding them the costs and 
disbursements of this action.” 
The statement examines items 
in the complaint and either 
admits, qualifies or denies each 
allegation.
The University says in its 

answer that the LSA Office of 
Undergraduate Admissions uses 
race as one of many factors in its 
undergraduate selection.
“Defendants admit that the 
University of Michigan has a 
current intention to continue to 
use race as a factor in admissions, 
as part of a broad array of 
qualifications and characteristics
of which racial or ethnic origin 
is but a single though important 
element,” the answer states.
Harrison 
said 
the 
judges 
hearing the case should consider 
the fact that the plaintiffs did 
not accept the extended waitlist 
offer.
“This particular response asks 
questions about (the plaintiffs’) 

standing to sue,” Harrison said. 
“That is an important question 
the court should look at.”
The 
plaintiffs’ 
lawyers, 
however, 
argue 
that 
the 
University’s motion to dismiss 
the case is moot.
“It’s legally irrelevant to the 
claims we are making,”said Terry 
Pell, senior legal counsel for the 
Center for Individual Rights, the 
firm that brought the suit against 
the University on Oct. 14 in 
Federal District Court in Detroit. 
“It doesn’t change the fact that 
they were discriminated against 
earlier in the process.”
Pell said that regardless of 
the waitlist offer, the University 
racially 
discriminated 
in 
its 

admissions practices.
“This 
is 
a 
very 
weak 
argument,’ 
Pell 
said. 
“The 
admissions process is permeated 
with racism. If there was not 
racial discrimination, they would 
have been admitted earlier in the 
year.”
The University has a rolling 
admissions 
policy, 
which 
means students are admitted 
continuously from September 
through the summer based on 
their 
qualifications 
and 
the 
number of spots available at the 
time of application.

The Michigan Daily (ISSN 0745-967) is published Monday through Friday during 
the fall and winter terms by students at the University OF Michigan. One copy is 
available free of charge to all readers. Additional copies may be picked up at the 
Daily’s office for $2. Subscriptions for September-April are $250 and year long 
subscriptions are $275. University affiliates are subject to a reduced subscription 
rate. On-campus subscriptions for fall term are $35. Subscriptions must be prepaid.

When 
asked 
whether 
it was the actions of the 
Trump administration or 
the actions of previous 
administrations 
that 
had more impact on the 
current 
relationship, 
Shirk 
said 
that 
the 
administrations of former 
Presidents Barack Obama, 
Bill Clinton and George 
Bush have caused current 
tensions between China 
and the United States. 
Shirk 
furthered 
her 
argument, 
saying 
she 
believes 
previous 
administrations 
had 
tried 
to 
stabilize 
tensions between the two 
countries and, at the same 
time, protect American 
interests.
Public Policy graduate 

student Mathew Rigdon 
told The Daily after the 
event he enjoyed listening 
to Shirk’s analysis of the 
geopolitical 
situation 
between the United States 
and China. 
“It 
was 
interesting 
to 
hear 
her 
take 
on 
both 
the 
Chinese 
and 
American overreactions, 
or 
types 
of 
opinions 
we can hold about each 
other’s 
countries 
that 
are not exactly accurate, 
especially 
from 
the 
American side,” Rigdon 
said. 
He said he felt Shirk was 
optimistic about Chinese 
expansive 
economic 
power in regard to their 
territorial interests. 
LSA freshman Justin 
Scott told The Daily he 
didn’t know much about 
the current relationship 
between the two countries 

prior to attending the 
lecture. 
“So 
personally, 
I 
didn’t come to the event 
with 
a 
very 
strong 
understanding 
of 
U.S-
China relations, but now 
I’ve realized it’s more 
tense than I previously 
thought. It might end up 
getting worse,” Scott said.
Ultimately, Shirk urged 
people 
concerned 
with 
the tensions between the 
United States and China 
to take a level-headed 
approach to the situation. 
“Calm down and think 
rationally about how to 
compete with China in 
a way that builds upon 
the 
advantages 
of 
our 
system,” Shirk said.

betterment of our campus,” 
Gerstein’s 
statement 
continues. “I have no doubt 
that the candidate selected 
will do just that.”
The 
Assembly 
also 
approved Law student Henry 
Zurn as chief justice of the 
Central Student Judiciary, 
the 
judicial 
branch 
of 
CSG, 
and 
Engineering 
freshman Braden Crimmins 
as associate chief justice. 
Zurn spoke regarding the 
importance 
of 
working 
toward greater continuity 
in the elections of CSJ 
members. 
“The 
Central 
Student 
Judiciary has had some 
problems in the past with 
turnover and continuity, so 
it’s particularly important 
that in this last round of 
confirmations, we had a 
good diversity both within 
academic degree granting 
units and within age of 
students or time left here 
at the University,” Zurn 
said. “It’ll be my priority 
and the priority of the 
associate chief nominee to 
keep 
everything 
running 
smoothly, and to facilitate 
that, 
it’s 
particularly 
important that we have clear 
lines of authority and clear 

lines of continuity within 
the student judiciary.”
The Assembly discussed 
and approved a resolution 
regarding CSG’s financial 
procedures. The resolution 
provides 
clear 
fiscal 
semesters, ensures a budget 
determines what funds are 
allocated, and eliminates 
some 
budgetary 
limits 
considered 
unnecessary. 
The resolution passed by 
unanimous consent. 
The 
Assembly 
next 
discussed 
a 
resolution 
to run a pilot program 
in 
the 
winter 
semester 
for 
a 
CSG-funded 
test 
preparation program. The 
proposed program would 
employ students who have 
succeeded 
on 
graduate 
school entrance exams such 
as the LSAT, MCAT or GRE, 
to tutor undergraduates at a 
cost lower than typical test 
preparation courses. The 
end goal of the program 
is to be presented to the 
University and eventually 
become a service provided 
by the University.
The resolution is similar 
to 
testing 
preparation 
services 
previously 
provided by the University 
Career Center. According 
to 
LSA 
sophomore 
Sam 
Braden, the sponsor of the 
resolution, one reason the 
program ended came from a 
desire to maintain a positive 
relationship with outside 
preparation services after 
the University was accused 
of violating copyright laws 
in their tutoring services. 
Braden 
said 
the 
University Career Center 
recommended 
CSG 
approach existing sources, 
such 
as 
Kaplan 
or 
the 
Princeton 
Review, 
and 
subsidize access to their 
services 
for 
students. 
Braden said he did not want 
to support the high prices, 
ranging between roughly 
$1,500 and $2,500, such 
sources 
charge 
for 
test 
preparation courses. 
“We 
didn’t 
like 
the 
thought of subsidizing a cost 
that, in and of itself, should 
not be this high,” Braden 
said. “It’s obvious that they 
don’t need to be charging 
this much — Kaplan and 

Princeton make immense 
profits off of these.”
Some Assembly members 
questioned 
the 
proposed 
program’s ability to provide 
tutoring services as high 
quality as more reputable 
testing 
preparation 

providers. 
Others 
also 

expressed 
concerns 

about the possibilities of 
bringing lawsuits against 
CSG or future tutors from 
such providers who could 
argue tutors who had once 
studied 
their 
materials 
could use the knowledge 
they acquired from their 
companies to tutor others. 
Jack 
Wroldsen, 
student 
general counsel, said he 
had brought the case to a 
certified bar attorney, who 
felt a lawsuit was plausible.
“He does think because 
of 
the 
intellectual 
property 
and 
copyright 
law, Kaplan or Princeton 
Review or whoever would 
have a strong case for it,” 
Wroldsen said. “He also 
said, regardless if there is 
or there isn’t, and I have to 
agree with him, why would 
we want to put ourselves in 
any sort of position to have 
to deal with a lawsuit at 
all?” 
Braden maintained that 
because the program would 
not use textbooks registered 
with any testing agency, 
and because he believes 
any 
lawsuit 
would 
be 
unfounded, the resolution 
should 
proceed 
for 
the 
benefit of students who do 
not have the opportunity 
to pay for expensive testing 
services. 
As a result, the resolution 
was 
referred 
to 
the 
Resolutions 
and 
Rules 
Committees 
for 
further 
consideration.
The 
Assembly 
next 

approved 
another 

procedural 
resolution, 
which 
passed 
with 
unanimous 
consent, 
and 
a 
resolution 
to 
award 
financial 
aid 
to 
socio-
economically disadvantaged 
CSG members for their time. 
The resolution passed with 
12 in favor, six abstentions, 
and zero against. 

RESIGNATION
From Page 1A

After sharing her story, 
Whitmer received countless 
emails, 
calls 
and 
written 
letters 
from 
Michigan 
residents thanking her for 
voicing a story so many of them 
shared but hadn’t told anyone 
about. She acknowledged that 
at the time when her assault 
occurred, she was completely 
unaware 
of 
any 
resources 
that were available to her in 
college, so she hopes to create 
pathways of conversation and 
change in society and college 
campuses. 
Following 
the 
keynote 
speech, the summit featured 
a four-person panel on sexual 
assault’s 
representation 
in 
the media and on college 
campuses, 
and 
how 
that 
affects survivors. One of the 
panelists, ESPN investigative 
reporter Paula Lavigne, said 
although schools are taking 
action on sexual assault cases, 
measuring change made in 
each institution should be 
based on its effect on other 
survivors. 
“The better way to measure 
that is to measure it based 
on the effect it has on other 
survivors,” 
Lavigne 
said. 
“Did writing about this, did 
sharing this woman’s story, 
did exposing this institution’s 
failures, did that encourage 
at least one other survivor to 
come forward? And I think if 
you look at that as a measure 
— did it have an effect? Did it 
affect change? I think in that 
sense you can say, ‘absolutely 
yes.’” 
Lavigne 
then 
explained 
how the popularity of the 
story affects the probability 
of survivors coming forward 
and also provides more sexual 
assault awareness.
“Obviously, there is more 
pressure, 
there 
is 
more 

awareness when it is a big 
story,” she said. “… But it’s 
hard, because it’s very case 
by case. It depends on who 
the audience is, what kind of 
support you’re getting from 
people hearing your message, 
and in the willingness of the 
institution or the company or 
whatever it is to take that next 
step and to make that change.”
Venkayla Haynes, a panelist 
and 
survivor 
of 
sexual 
assault, 
said 
she 
believes 
when the media covers sexual 
assault, it tends to lack in its 
representation 
of 
minority 
groups. 
“I can’t actually say that 
the media is doing everything 
really well,” Haynes said. “I 
need to remember that this 
movement is for me and that 
the media is not the movement. 
The grassroot organizing the 
missions that develop on the 
ground is the real movement. 
And I think when we talk 
about the media, and we talk 
about sexual violence, we 
don’t see the voices of Black 
women. We don’t see the 
voices of non-binary folks, 
trans folks, queer folks.” 
Another panelist, Brenda 
Tracy, also a survivor of 
sexual assault, went on to 
say the media representation 
of her sexual assault case 
only had a negative effect on 
her situation and her mental 
health.
“The media coverage of 
my story at that time didn’t 
do anything to counteract 
the victim blaming and the 
backlash against me,” Tracy 
said. “There was a lot of ‘what 
was she doing there? What 
was she wearing?’ That kind 
of thing … I just remember 
my community really turning 
against me viciously.”
Tracey said the media not 
only hurt her relationships 
with people close to her but 
also ruined her mental health.
“The media was part of a 
machine that pushed me into 

a place of darkness,” Tracey 
said. “Depression. PTSD. I 
really think that if I did not 
have children, I would not be 
here today. I would have killed 
myself, absolutely.”
Tracy ended her discussion 
on the media by discussing its 
importance and how it must 
be used properly to spread the 
most awareness possible for 
survivors and their stories. 
“The media matters. I’ve 
seen how much of a difference 
it’s made in my life,” Tracy 
said. “And my heart aches for 
survivors who are not treated 
well by the media, and when 
we don’t do well coverage of 
this issue because it really 
changes the conversation, and 
it can push it into a really good 
place or it can push it into a 
really bad place.”
Tracy said she believes there 
is not much change happening 
within 
college 
campus 
culture, even with all the 
recent coverage of survivors 
and increased sexual assault 
awareness in the community.
“We haven’t really made 
that much progress on our 
campuses,” Tracy said. “So, 
until we start hearing from 
survivors 
that 
‘my 
school 
treated me well,’ I just am not 
willing to pat everybody on the 
back … there’s a lot of work to 
do.”
Haynes agreed with Tracy 
that college institutions are 
not doing their best to help 
their students who have been 
sexually assaulted and instead 
become 
defensive 
when 
charged with such allegations.
“We’re not at a point where 
anyone 
wants 
to 
be 
held 
accountable for their actions,” 
she said. “. … It’s very, very 
hard 
to 
eradicate 
sexual 
violence when you don’t even 
acknowledge 
that 
it 
even 
happens. So, I think we’re still 
at this point where we’re trying 
to protect this institutional 
image before protecting our 
students.”

REPRESENTATION
From Page 1A

In an email to The Daily, 
University 
spokesperson 
Dana Elger wrote there is 
no University-wide policy 
on the practice of faculty 
teaching 
and 
requiring 
students 
to 
purchase 
works they have played a 
role in creating. The role 
of 
regulating 
textbooks 
and determining policies 
related to textbooks falls 
on specific units instead. 
The Faculty Handbook, 
however, 
does 
note 
teaching staff should not 
have 
“direct 
dealings 
with students in the sale 
of 
books, 
instruments, 
lectures, notes, or similar 
materials.”
Elger pointed to LSA and 
College 
of 
Engineering 
policies, 
which 
require 
faculty who plan to teach 
their own books in class to 
disclose this information 
to a chair or director for 
review. 
The decision on whether 
to allow faculty to teach 
books they have edited and 
authored has played out on 
college campuses across 
the country. Proponents 
find the practice allows 
lecturers to teach work 
they know intimately and 
is sometimes considered 
the 
best 
literature 
on 
a 
particular 
subject, 
whereas 
critics 
assert 
it allows faculty to take 
advantage of students and 
raises ethical concerns.
At the University of 
Kentucky, a journalism 
professor 
was 
placed 
on leave in 2016 after 
administrators found out 
he required his students to 
purchase his book without 
“special 
administrative 
permission” 
from 
the 
school, 
violating 
its 
policy. He had received 
approximately $6,000 in 
royalties at the time of his 
dismissal.
In 2004, the American 
Association of University 
Professors weighed in on 
the subject, writing in a 
statement the practice of 
faculty selecting their own 
works as course materials 
is 
protected 
through 
academic 
freedom 
and, 
alone, is not cause for 
concern. The Association 
noted there is a possibility 
faculty could purposefully 
choose a text from which 
they would gain financial 
benefits and policies at 
different 
schools 
could 
fail to address this issue. 
Nationally, the validity 
of the practice has been 
debated for years, though 
it still occurs on college 
campuses regularly. A poll 
from Insider and Barnes 
& Noble College Insights 
released in October found 
two-thirds 
of 
students 
surveyed at colleges across 
the 
country 
reported 
having to purchase a book 
written by their professor. 
Tailoring content to the 
class
When 
Mateo 
began 
teaching Astronomy 104, 
the norm was to begin 
the semester with physics 

then 
transition 
to 
the 
broad, introductory look 
at astronomy. However, he 
developed what he sees as 
a better way to teach the 
class: having the physics 
aspect 
of 
the 
course 
within the different units 
as they become relevant, 
as opposed to it being a 
separate unit.
For a while, Mateo used 
other books and relied 
heavily on his detailed 
notes to teach the class in 
the way he felt was most 
effective. He then decided 
to create a book reflecting 
his 
vision, 
which 
was 
“Alien Skies.”
The textbook, according 
to Mateo, takes readers to 
different places in space 
and 
describes 
what’s 
there and the context 
needed 
to 
understand 
it. He said this is a far 
different approach than 
other textbooks available, 
which are all similar in 
structure 
but 
different 
than his vision for the 
course. 
“Honestly, I could cut 
a page randomly out of 
every book (published 
in the area since the 
1960s), put it together, 
and you wouldn’t even 
notice 
that 
they’re 
different,” Mateo said. 
“They’re all the same. 
Every single textbook 
that’s been done since 
that time is exactly the 
same. I decided I don’t 
like this approach. I 
don’t 
think 
that’s 
a 
good approach, so that’s 
why I developed the 
textbook.”
Mateo 
noted 
when 
he 
taught 
the 
class 
without 
the 
book, 
he 
would jump around in a 
different 
textbook 
and 
add additional notes in 
class. He said having his 
tailor-made book provides 
more cohesion within the 
course, but also noted 
what is taught in lecture 
goes beyond the contents 
of the book even if there is 
some overlap.
When 
working 
with 
the publisher, Mateo said 
he requested the book be 
reasonably priced to not 
place an undue burden 
on students. He said his 
book is not any more 
costly than a comparable 
textbook, and students are 
able to purchase it from 
other 
students 
rather 
than directly from the 
publisher.
Some 
staff 
members 
reject the notion faculty 
teach their own textbooks 
as a medium for increasing 
revenue, which has been a 
central argument against 
the practice in the past. 
Professor of History Victor 
Lieberman, who teaches 
a textbook he edited and 
wrote 
an 
introduction 
for in History 244: The 
History 
of 
the 
Arab-
Israeli Conflict, wrote in 
an email to The Daily he 
does not receive monetary 
compensation when the 
book is purchased. 
“I 
have 
never 
taken 
a cent in royalties on 
that book, which itself 
constitutes a fraction of 

assigned readings for the 
course,” Lieberman wrote.
Mateo 
echoed 
Lieberman’s 
sentiment, 
noting he has not made 
enough from the royalties 
to balance out the work 
he put into creating it. 
Instead, Mateo said the 
value lies in having the 
book out there, in hopes 
professors elsewhere want 
to use it.
While Mateo said he 
understands concerns on 
this issue, he is against 
having a University-wide 
policy, as he feels it may 
discourage faculty from 
publishing. He said most 
faculty 
members 
who 
write 
textbooks 
do 
so 
to put their notes into a 
structured document for 
student use. 
“These 
are 
not 
bestselling books,” Mateo 
said. “The reason you do 
it is because it probably 
reflects the vision that you 
want to have for the for the 
course 
you’re 
teaching, 
and what’s wrong with 
that?”
Student perspective
Charlic noted the issue 
is difficult to solve, as 
there is no one-size-fits-
all solution. 
“It’s 
not 
necessarily 
something you can apply 
to every situation,” Charlic 
said. “If a professor wants 
to use their own textbook, 
it needs to be approved 
individually.” 
LSA 
sophomore 
Ben 
Dieffenbacher 
was 
required to purchase a 
course pack from Ulrich’s 
for a Political Science class 
that included a collection 
of chapters the professor 
of the class wrote for the 
course, according to the 
syllabus.
Like 
Charlic, 
Dieffenbacher 
said 
he 
would 
feel 
comfortable 
with the practice if there 
was 
a 
University-wide 
approval system. He felt 
the collection of chapters 
he purchased contained 
information all covered 
in lectures and said he 
recommends 
students 
planning 
to 
take 
the 
course not purchase it if 
they attend class.
“Looking 
back 
on 
it, it does seem a little 
bit 
questionable,” 
Diffenbacher said. “Why 
would you assign your 
own (book)?”
Diffenbacher 
said 
it’s 
important 
for 
the 
University 
to 
oversee 
this to ensure students 
do not have to purchase 
unnecessary 
books. 
He 
said 
this 
is 
especially 
an 
issue 
for 
students 
from 
low-socioeconomic 
backgrounds. 
Diffenbacher also noted 
he 
has 
no 
issue 
with 
instructors 
using 
their 
own content when it is 
provided for free, but it 
becomes a gray area when 
there is a cost associated.
“When they brought it 
for free, not a problem. If 
you’re providing it for cost, 
I think it gets problematic 
in our current system,” 
Diffenbacher said.

Why forgiving student loan debt is a bad idea

KAYLA CHINITZ | OP-ED

Credit classism at U-M

Let’s find a better way

W

e all know attending 
college in this country 
has gotten expensive. 
In the last three decades, taking 
inflation into account, the average 
cost 
of 
attending 
a 
four-year 
institution in this country has 
doubled, while data indicates the 
price tag of earning a college degree 
rose eight times faster 
than wages in that 
same timespan. 
The result is a 
staggering 
student 
loan crisis that has 
burdened 
millions 
of college graduates 
who regularly find 
themselves trapped 
by tens of thousands 
of dollars in debt. The 
average 
American 
household with student loan debt 
owes almost $50,000, according 
to figures published by personal 
finance website NerdWallet, and a 
total of $1.6 trillion of debt still has 
to be paid back by approximately 43 
million borrowers.
With the growth of tuition 
consistently 
outpacing 
that 
of 
paychecks, Americans are finding 
it increasingly difficult to recover 
and purchase a home, start a family 
and even appreciate the benefits 
of a college degree. And given the 
popularity of higher education, 
this crisis will affect more and 
more Americans if a solution is not 
quickly found.
Here 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan, we are fortunate to 
have great programs that allow 
lower income-earners to receive a 
world-class education, regardless of 
socioeconomic status. With the Go 
Blue Guarantee, in-state students 
admitted to the Ann Arbor campus 
with a family income of $65,000 or 
less can receive free tuition, while 
families with an income of up to 
$180,000 receive some kind of 
financial support. 
But sadly, many students are not 
as fortunate. Across the nation, a 
great number of students are forced 
to take out risky loans in order 
to graduate from college. Even 
here in Ann Arbor, many students 
who don’t qualify for the Go Blue 
Guarantee encounter difficulties. 
After college, graduates are faced 
with the challenging task of paying 
back this debt.
In order to address this crippling 
problem, 
many 
people 
have 
pointed to blanket student-loan 
debt forgiveness, which would 

effectively cancel much (or all) of 
the debt that borrowers are still 
working to pay back. And with the 
2020 presidential election now less 
than a year away, many of the more 
liberal members of the Democratic 
field, 
especially 
Sen. 
Bernie 
Sanders, I-Vt., and Sen. Elizabeth 
Warren, D-Mass., have gotten on 
board with this plan in an 
effort to give some relief 
to graduates and make 
college less costly as a 
whole.
While Warren says she 
would aim to cancel or 
significantly reduce the 
debt owed by households 
with 
income 
under 
$250,000, 
according 
to 
her 
“Affordable 
Higher 
Education 
for All” proposal, Sanders says 
he would ambitiously work to 
forgive the entire $1.6 trillion 
owed by Americans, as his public 
education plan states. In order to 
gather enough money to pay for 
student loan debt cancellation, 
both would take revenue from 
their controversial “Wealth Tax” 
proposals. 
On the surface, forgiving student 
loan debt may sound attractive. 
As marketed by Warren, Sanders 
and others, it appears at first as 
a compassionate policy move, a 
proposal that would assist pained 
graduates who are burdened by 
debt. But on the whole, blanket 
student loan forgiveness would 
precipitate a cascade of problems 
in our economic and educational 
systems.
One of the largest issues with 
blanket debt cancellation is the 
staggering cost. Like some of 
Warren and Sanders’ other plans, 
such as “Medicare-for-All,” which 
they have expressed unwavering 
support for, this proposal carries 
a disturbing price tag that will 
have a profound effect on all of 
us. According to a report sent 
to her campaign, Warren’s loan 
forgiveness plan would cost well 
over $600 billion dollars. 
While these candidates and other 
politicians promise that only the 
wealthy will be taxed, it is inevitable 
this cost will spread through 
society and impact everybody in 
some way. One of the most notable 
ways a debt forgiveness program 
could leave its mark on society 
could be by widening the wealth 
gap, especially between white 
and black households. “While 

eliminating student debt for all 
households regardless of income 
increases median net worth for 
young white and Black households, 
white families see a greater benefit 
likely due to a higher likelihood of 
completing college and graduate 
degree programs,” according to 
research released by Demos and 
the Institute on Assets and Social 
Policy in 2015. Since people who 
have taken out student loans are 
likely already better off financially 
and likely have a college degree 
and good-paying job, student loan 
forgiveness could actually make 
them even better off relative to 
those who never attended college.
Yet another issue with student 
loan 
debt 
forgiveness 
is 
the 
possibility that it could erode the 
high quality of college education 
that is so common in American 
institutions. According to Forbes 
in June, debt cancellation would 
ensure that “nobody (would be) 
on the hook for the growing costs 
of higher education. …” Why 
would a college care as much 
about maintaining the level of its 
programs in a responsible manner 
if it knew many of its students were 
essentially coming there for free? 
Blanket loan forgiveness creates a 
broad accountability problem in the 
end.
Finally, setting everything else 
aside, debt cancellation truly sets 
a strikingly bad precedent. If all 
graduates with student loans can 
suddenly wake up one day with all 
of their debt completely gone, what 
kind of model does that set for the 
future? In a nation with blanket 
student loan forgiveness, we may 
soon see others who are burdened 
by debt from different sources 
trying to convince the government 
to forgive their loans as well.
Ultimately, 
a 
student 
loan 
forgiveness 
program 
would 
systematically 
undermine 
the 
unparalleled 
nature 
of 
our 
respected educational system while 
directly harming our economy. It 
is simple common sense to realize 
that instead of working to mitigate 
the problems stemming from our 
broken student loan system, we 
must truly work to revamp this 
failing system itself. In the end, that 
will revolutionize our system of 
higher education here in the United 
States much more than blanket 
debt forgiveness ever could.

t’s time to change how we 
nominate our presidential 
candidates.
The path to becoming a 
presidential nominee of a major 
party is long and convoluted. 
The main events of this process 
are the individual primaries 
and caucuses held by each state. 
The most well-known are the 
Iowa caucuses and the New 
Hampshire 
primary, 
which 
always come first and second, 
respectively. 
This gives these states an 
outsized share in choosing who 
will be the nominee. Is it fair 
for them to have this power? 
Should different, more diverse 
states take their place? Or should 
we change the whole system? 
Though the answers to these 
questions are not clear, this is 
an important conversation we 
should be having.
Julián 
Castro, 
Democratic 
presidential 
candidate 
and 
former secretary of Housing and 
Urban Development, contributed 
to 
the 
public 
conversation 
around changing the nominating 
system this week when he called 
for a reshuffling of the order of 
the Democratic primaries.
Castro 
singled 
out 
Iowa 
and New Hampshire, saying 
they should no longer be the 
first two states to vote since 
they are not representative of 
Democratic voters nationwide. 
Castro indirectly pointed to the 
fact that both of these states are 
overwhelmingly 
white, 
Iowa 
being 91 percent white and New 
Hampshire 94 percent white. 
The diversity in these states 
falls far behind the U.S. as a 
whole, which is estimated to 
be only about 60 percent white. 
Castro argued that this lack of 
diversity devalues the voices that 
are integral to the success of the 
Democratic Party. 
Critics of Castro point to the 
fact that South Carolina and 

Nevada, whose primaries come 
after Iowa and New Hampshire, 
are much more diverse. South 
Carolina has a large African-
American population and Nevada 
a large Latino population.
However, 
Castro 
argued 
Iowa and New Hampshire are 
bellwether 
states; 
campaigns 
that do not do well in either will 
not be able to make it to South 
Carolina or Nevada. He is not 
wrong in this regard as the only 
time a Democratic nominee 
won neither Iowa nor New 
Hampshire was 1976.
For Castro, these comments 
are 
largely 
political. 
His 
campaign has been struggling, 
as he has had to cut back on 
staff and did not qualify for the 
November 
debate. 
However, 
his comments have merit. The 
system that we use to nominate 
a 
presidential 
candidate 
is 
extremely complicated and not 
very democratic. The question: 
How can we fix it? 
The fact that Iowa and New 
Hampshire have so much power 
is unfair. As Castro pointed out, 
if a candidate does not do well 
in those states, they will usually 
have to close up shop. That 
means states that come later 
in the primary schedule do not 
have as many options or as big of 
a say in choosing who represents 
the Democrats. 
However, all Castro is calling 
for is having a more diverse 
state go first the primaries. This 
will not address the problem 
of certain states having more 
power than others, since it will 
simply substitute one inequality 
for another. 
One of the most obvious 
answers would be to have every 
state vote on the same day in 
a national primary. Like any 
system, this has its own set of 
pros and cons. A national primary 
could significantly reduce the 
duration of the election and 

would equally distribute voting 
power among the states.
However, this process would 
come with its own drawbacks. 
State by state primaries allow 
politicians with little money or 
name recognition to gain voter 
support 
through 
intensive, 
on-the-ground 
campaigning, 
such as town halls, canvassing 
and other grassroots actions. 
This was true in 2008 when 
Barack Obama was able to 
beat Hillary Clinton in Iowa, 
despite 
her 
greater 
name 
recognition. If there were a 
national primary, it is likely 
that people with the most name 
recognition would win or that 
a large number of candidates 
would split the field, allowing 
a 
candidate 
lacking 
broad 
popular support to win. 
There are a few other 
solutions 
that 
could 
be 
implemented. 
One 
possible 
option would be to divide the 
country up into five sets of 
ten states and do a rotating 
primary 
schedule 
so 
that 
every U.S. state could be part 
of the first block at least once 
every 20 years. 
However, this would be 
complicated 
to 
implement 
and still runs into the issue 
of 
discriminating 
against 
small campaigns that may be 
unable to compete in 10 states 
at once. Such a process might 
also be confusing to voters. 
Democracy is often messy, 
and the nominee selection 
process is no exception. I don’t 
know what the right answer is, 
and I’m not sure anyone else 
does either. However, this is 
a conversation we should be 
having. Maybe, from those 
conversations, we can come up 
with a better way to pick our 
presidential nominees.

W

e’ve all been there. 
Watching 
the 
number of available 
seats drop for a course you 
desperately want to take crushes 
your soul a little. But for some 
students this stress eases as 
they advance in class rank; for 
others, it is ongoing. Currently, 
the University of Michigan’s 
policy on assigning enrollment 
appointment gives students from 
better-resourced high schools 
preferential treatment at an 
institutional level.
U-M 
assigns 
enrollment 
appointments 
based 
on 
Credits Toward Program. The 
more credits you have, the 
earlier you can secure your 
spot in a course. Therefore, 
students who come to college 
having 
already 
received 
Advanced 
Placement 
or 
International 
Baccalaureate 
scores set by U-M will enroll 
first 
among 
their 
class 
throughout 
their 
college 
career, while those at the back 
of the line will continue to be 
pushed out of their desired 
courses. The repercussions 
of this issue impact computer 
science students particularly 
strongly, 
where 
lower 
registration priority means 
ending up on long waitlists 
for courses they want to take 
or even need to complete 
their degrees.
If every high school student 
had equal access to AP and 
IB 
courses, 
then 
perhaps 
a 
system 
of 
credit-based 
enrollment times would grant 
equality of opportunity to all 
U-M students. In U.S. public 
schools, however, that is not 
the case; resource inequality 
manifests 
along 
racial, 
economic 
and 
geographic 
lines.
Let’s back up. AP courses 
cost money — a lot of money. 
The College Board estimates 
it 
costs 
schools 
between 
$1,900 and $11,650 to start 
one new AP course. On top 
of these expenses, running 
a new class means paying 
another teacher. In cities like 
Detroit, where money is in 
“short supply in city schools 
that have spent much of the 
recent decades fending off 
one crisis after another,” such 
cumulative costs frequently 
diminish the feasibility of 
offering AP and IB courses. 
Since the amount of money 
a school receives depends 
substantially 
on 
property 
taxes 
from 
its 
district, 

wealthy schools in wealthy 
neighborhoods 
often 
have 
more money to spend on AP 
and IB courses. Accordingly, 
students from higher-income 
communities are more likely 
to take AP courses than 
students from lower-income 
communities. 
These disparities are also 
prominent along racial lines. 
According to a ProPublica 
report, white students are 1.8 
times more likely to take AP 
classes than Black students 
nationwide. 
In 
Michigan 
specifically, 
that 
number 
jumps to 2.6 percent. U.S. 
Department 
of 
Education 
research 
backs 
up 
trends 
demonstrated by this data. 
In 2014, Black and Latino 
students made up 37 percent 
of high school students, but 
only 18 percent of students 
who pass AP exams with a 
qualifying score of 3 or above.
There is also geographic 
inequity in AP test completion. 
A 2017 report explains rural 
schools also face challenges 
of overcrowding and limited 
resources, and these resource 
constraints are reflected in 
accessibility of AP courses 
nationwide. 
In 
2015, 
73 
percent of seniors in rural 

high 
schools 
had 
access 
to at least one AP course, 
compared to 95 percent of 
seniors 
in 
suburban 
high 
schools. Rural schools are 
often 
overlooked 
because 
they are more isolated than 
urban and suburban schools, 
but one-fifth of public school 
students in the U.S. attend a 
rural school. That’s a sizable 
accessibility 
issue. 
While 
access to higher-level courses 
in rural schools has increased 
over 
recent 
years, 
that 
22-percent gap is still very 
real and very wide. 
In putting forth these stats, 
I do not intend to paint over 
any community with a wide 
brush — each community has 

its own complexities that 
influence how its schools 
operate. But I do want to draw 
attention to inequalities that 
reverberate in our enrollment 
time assignments. I want to 
highlight those connections 
because, through its CTP-
based system of enrollment 
appointment 
assignment, 
U-M 
is 
perpetuating 
socioeconomic 
inequities 
in 
the 
education 
system. 
A 
system 
that 
privileges 
students with access to AP 
and IB courses is a system 
that privileges students from 
affluent schools.
For 
a 
university 
that 
invests heavily in Diversity, 
Equity 
and 
Inclusion 
initiatives 
and 
seems 
determined to portray itself 
as equitable, it is shocking 
that 
this 
structural 
bias 
against 
students 
from 
lower-income 
and 
rural 
communities 
is 
built 
into its system of course 
registration. 
In 
renewing 
patterns of privilege, U-M 
is sending a message about 
which students it values. 
But let’s be clear, it’s not 
just U-M. If you research the 
registration 
time 
systems 
of large universities, you’ll 
find 
that 
many 
of 
them 
have similar structures. So 
if our system is inherently 
unfair, 
what’s 
a 
better 
alternative? Let’s look at 
Boston 
University. 
Each 
semester, BU randomizes a 
list of numbers 0 through 9, 
and registration start times 
are assigned (within each 
class year) based where the 
last digit of a student’s ID 
number falls on that list. The 
key idea here is that BU’s 
system of enrollment time 
assignment is randomized. 
It isn’t systematically biased 
toward any one student over 
another. If a student gets an 
early enrollment slot two 
semesters in a row, it’s by 
chance.
AP and IB courses provide 
fruitful, valuable learning 
experiences for high school 
students; however, we should 
not be basing our system 
of course enrollment on a 
system that is inherently 
unequal, 
classist 
and 
continuously puts students 
from affluent communities 
at the front of the line.

The world that the final season of “The Man in 
the High Castle” is being released into is a very 
different 
place 
than when first 
commissioned 
by 
Amazon 
Prime 
Studios 
back 
in 
2015. 
Now, in 2019, 
the 
show 
has 
lost 
some 
of 
its early praise 
and is no longer 
Amazon’s 
most-watched 
original series. 
Most 
simply 
put, the series 
is 
based 
on 
Philip K. Dick’s 
1962 novel by 
the same name, 
set in a parallel 
universe where 
the Axis powers 
have won World 
War II. Western 
North America 
is a part of the 
Japanese Pacific 
States while the 
Germans rule the East Coast, both separated by a 
neutral zone in the Rocky Mountains. 
Complexly, this show is as much about the Axis 
powers winning as it is about 
the Allies. For in this dark, Axis-
ruled world, there is an American 
resistance that suspect the Allies 
won the war. These characters 
come into contact with newsreels 
and home movies belonging to a 
figure known as “The Man in the 
High Castle” that show Germany 
and Japan losing the war. How 
could this be possible? In this 
story about alternate history, 
there 
lies 
another 
alternate 
history where the Allies did in 
fact defeat the Axis powers. Every 
film has been brought over to the 
show’s primary world by people 
who are able to travel between 
them. Much of the third and 
fourth seasons explored a portal 
that the Nazis built so they could 
travel to alternate universes, with 
the ambitious goal of taking over 
the entire multiverse.

On the surface, how could this depiction of 
alternate history not get attention? The appeal 
was always the science fiction of it, which was 
also a constant source of criticism. The up-and-
down reception over the remaining three seasons 
culminated in a final scene that was over four 
years in the making, and it kind of felt like the 
creative figures behind the series didn’t quite 
know the purpose of the story they were telling. 
Concluding a show is difficult. Concluding a 
show that plays with the idea that there are an 
infinite number of parallel realities is an even 
more difficult one. In this final episode, the 
Japanese have abandoned North America, the 
East Coast is being run by a guy who wants the 
Nazis gone and high-ranking Nazi official, John 
Smith (Rufus Sewell, “Victoria”) is dead. These 
were all necessary to tie up loose ends. The show 
could have ended there. However, inexplicably, 
there was one more scene that takes us to the 
Nazi multi-verse portal. The American resistance 
has taken the facility where the portal is located 
from the Nazis and the portal fires up itself. Once 
it stabilizes, people start strolling through into 
the room, not acknowledging the people who are 
already present in the room. This was clearly 
meant to be a “moving” scene in which people 
were coming from literally everywhere but there 
was absolutely no setup for this turn of events, 
making it meaningless. It feels like a victory, but 
what that victory was is unclear. The final scene 
poses many more questions than it answers. As 
the show progressed, the show became less about 
the characters and more about the theory of the 
multi-verse. Regardless of how the series ending 
is perceived, the show will always be remembered 
for establishing Amazon as a premiere streaming 
service.

‘Man’ is confusing, but giving
a show its due ending is hard

Four years ago, when I thought about the 
town of Ann Arbor, I mostly thought about 
the University of Michigan. I really didn’t 
think much of the place besides the fact 
that it housed this massive school and all of 
its students. As someone that came from a 
different state, I didn’t even know how close 
Ann Arbor was to Detroit, or how the two 
cities interacted. Since moving here a few 
years ago, however, I’ve started to get the 
lay of the land and realize that Ann Arbor is 
more than just an address for students. 
I started to do some more research and 
found out that artists like Iggy Pop and Bob 
Seger used to call this 
place home while it served 
as a countercultural meca 
in the ’60s. Institutions 
like The Ark and the 
Ann Arbor Folk Festival 
cultivated a growing folk 
scene that attracted names 
like Bob Dylan and Joni 
Mitchell to the town, all 
while a growing punk 
scene 
thrived 
amongst 
college students. However, 
as time went by another 
genre of music started 
growing in Ann Arbor’s 
underground music scene, 
right next to its birthplace: 
techno.
When I think of music 
from Detroit, I usually 
think of Motown soul 
music. And while this 
genre is most certainly 
what the city is predominantly known for, 
Detroit has one of the most well-known 
techno scenes in the world, and Ann Arbor is 
like Detroit’s younger sibling when it comes 
to the genre. Having just started to explore 
the style over the past few years, I had heard 
of some of the bigger names from Detroit like 
Robert Hood and Mike Huckaby, but I never 
really understood where Ann Arbor fit into 
the mix. That is, until this past week when I 
watched a documentary called Impulse Ann 
Arbor, produced by the Michigan Electronic 
Music Collective’s co-president, Jordan 
Stanton. The documentary talks about the 
unique story of Ann Arbor’s underground 
electronic music scene through interviews 
from both students and prominent artists 
alike. 
I was captivated by how passionate each 
person was about this music, and how 
important it was to this city. How had I not 
known about all of this? Ann Arbor had 
played an important role in this genre, that 

much was clear. I had been to parties and 
events put on by MEMCO, but I was ignorant 
to 
how 
significant 
organizations 
like 
MEMCO and WCBN FM were in growing 
this genre. But it makes sense. Being so 
close to this monster of culture and music, it 
would have been impossible for Ann Arbor to 
ignore techno. People would travel for miles 
to Ann Arbor to see huge names like Jeff 
Mills frequently DJ the Nectarine Ballroom, 
known today as Necto. Programs like Crush 
Collision on WCBN have broadcasted 
upcoming and established techno artists 
to hundreds of radios around the area. The 
more I learned about the genre, the more I 
realized that the culture it fostered was just 
as DIY as most basement shows that I would 
usually associate with the term, if not more 
so. 
Along with the fact that 
most of these events are run 
by the artists and fans, free 
from a corporate influence 
(which is what I consider 
modern DIY to be), I think 
techno embodies the more 
traditional spirit of DIY 
from the ’70s and ’80s 
through its commitment 
to 
social 
justice 
and 
providing a safe space 
for everyone, especially 
in the Detroit and Ann 
Arbor 
communities. 
In 
the 
documentary, 
Brendan Gillen, legendary 
DJ and founder of the 
label 
Interdimensional 
Transmissions, describes 
the music as “a purely 
intellectual black music 
form that was a catharsis 
for people under great opresion.” MEMCO 
throws an annual Black History Month 
event where a portion of the proceeds go to 
a different Black-owned non-profits, as well 
as hosting a variety of events that feature 
female, POC and queer DJs, attempting to 
avoid the all-too-common lineup consiting 
of strictly straight white men and create an 
inclusive, welcoming environment.
As my last semester here as an undergrad 
approaches, I feel like I’ve sort of missed 
an opportunity with MEMCO and the 
scene it fosters. I love the idea of DIY, and 
I love the way in which Ann Arbor’s techno 
community embodies it. It really does focus 
on the community itself instead of the 
individual. The more and more I learn about 
this town, the more I realize how special it 
is. I really liked a quote from Gillen later on 
in the documentary that continues to grow 
more truthful the more I think about it: “In 
Ann Arbor, it can’t be about you or it’s going 
to fail.”

What do you tech-know?

“The Empathy Exams”
The usual premise of an essay collection isn’t simply the 
reproduction of a collection of magazine articles: There’s a reason 
why all of this is in the same place. One expects from a good essayist 
that a pattern will start to emerge, affiliations and positions slowly 
revealed via the author’s readings of literature, culture, society, 
politics. One writer who is particularly good at this — one whose 
essay collections feel like a single, slightly inscrutable object is being 
examined from many different angles — is Leslie Jamison. Her 
themes have remained rather consistent since 2014’s “The Empathy 
Exams,” and her new collection “Make It Scream, Make It Burn” is 
a continued fleshing out of Jamison’s longtime interests.
The title essay of “The Empathy Exams” begins with a firsthand 
account of Jamison’s experience as a medical actor, someone who 
gets paid to act out symptoms for medical students to “diagnose.” 
The medical students are graded, among other things, on their 
ability to “voice empathy” for their patients. This experience — as 
well as Jamison’s experiences with other medical practitioners and 
a romantic relationship — provides a field for Jamison to ask some 
questions about empathy in general. What is empathy, exactly? Is it 
always good? She recounts the attempts of the medical students to 
“empathize” with her that end up just coming across as patronizing 
— “‘I am sorry to hear that you are experiencing an excruciating 
pain in your abdomen,’ one says. ‘It must be uncomfortable.’” Such 
botched attempts at compassion end up insulting the person they 
are directed at more than a simply impersonal statement might 
have, and elsewhere in the essay Jamison recalls a doctor’s calm 
impartiality as comforting. “Instead of identifying with my panic 
— inhabiting my horror at the prospect of a pacemaker — he was 

helping me understand that even this, the barnacle of a false heart, 
would be okay.” In the final account, Jamison sees empathy as an 
ethical stance that requires work. “Empathy isn’t just listening, it’s 
asking the questions whose answers need to be listened to. Empathy 
requires inquiry as much as imagination. Empathy requires 
knowing you know nothing.” 
This could be read as a statement about writing, too. The various 
techniques of representation through writing are, like empathy, 
dependent on understanding the subject, prone to projections and 
distortions. It’s possible only through careful attention, and the 
stakes are high. It makes sense, then, that “The Empathy Exams” is 
as much a record of Jamison’s own doubt about her ability to truly 
understand her subjects as much as it is a book about mysterious 
diseases, ultramarathon running and travels in Central and 
South America. Passages of straightforward documentary prose 
sometimes dovetail into self-doubt, which then becomes a reflexive 
resentment about the insufficiency of this same doubt, often in the 
space of a paragraph or two. She is unusually clear-headed with her 
own thought process, tortuous though it can be. 
The most striking essay in “The Empathy Exams” is “Devil’s Bait,” 
a dispatch from a conference on Morgellons disease. This “condition” 
emerged in the early aughts, has vague, variable symptoms and is 
not recognized by medical science — but the 12,000 or so people who 
claim to have it insist that their suffering is real. Jamison, in talking 
to sufferers of this disease, is faced with a problem: How does one 
go about expressing compassion for someone while simultaneously 
disbelieving in the cause of their suffering? Does compassion, in this 
case, actually make suffering worse? “When does empathy actually 
reinforce the pain it wants to console? Does giving people a space to 
talk about their disease — probe it, gaze at it, share it — help them 
move through it, or simply deepen its hold?”
She ends the essay without a solution, in a state of dejection. “I 
wanted to be a different kind of listener than the kind these patients 
had known … But wanting to be different doesn’t make you so. Paul 
told me his crazy-ass symptoms and I didn’t believe him. Or at least, 
I didn’t believe him the way he wanted to be believed.” She finally 
questions what, exactly, she is accomplishing by writing the essay: 
“I was typical. In writing this essay, how am I doing something he 
wouldn’t understand as betrayal?” She’s unable to see what she’s 
doing as anything other than a failure of empathy — or a limit case 
of it, which also becomes the limit case of the form of the essay. You 
can never create writing that is really true to someone’s feelings 
in cases like this — Jamison offers instead her own conflicted 
thought process. This is writing that, instead of making claims to 
objectivity, lets readers into the problems underneath the surface of 
the essayist’s craft. 
“Make It Scream”
The title essay of “Make It Scream” is, on the surface, concerned 
with many of the same things that Jamison was working out in “The 
Empathy Exams.” The essay is a long exegesis of James Agee’s 1941 
book “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men” that doubles as a critical 
examination of journalistic veracity. It helps that Agee’s book is not 
at all a conventional work of narrative journalism — Agee, tasked 
by Fortune to write an article about sharecroppers in Depression-

era Alabama, ended up writing, instead, a 400-page book that 
documents “everything Agee felt and thought and questioned as 
he tried to tell the story of these Alabama families.” The work is 
deeply reflexive in a way that presaged the New Journalism. Agee 
ruminates about his own inability to tell the story effectively in a 
way that nearly undermines his own authority, and that’s not even 
counting the bizarre and categorically inappropriate statements 
he makes — like wanting to have sex with the daughter of one of 
the families he’s supposed to 
report on. Jamison’s interest in 
the book is in Agee’s honesty 
about his own limitations as a 
reporter — she writes that “part of 
the claustrophobia of Praise is its 
suggestion that every strategy of 
representation is somehow flawed 
or wrong” and that he was “ looking 
for “a language for skepticism.”
The clincher is not Jamison’s 
valorization of Agee’s anxious 
style, but that she finds in his 
writing “a sincerity that lay on 
the far side of self-interrogation.” 
Sincerity 
becomes 
possible 
through 
interrogation 
— 
it’s 
a logical continuation of the 
argument she posed in the title 
essay of “The Empathy Exams,” 
of 
carefully 
applied 
attention 
and emotional intelligence. This 
applies to her subjects, too. In an essay about contemporary belief 
in reincarnation, she writes “The more compelling question for 
me had never been, is reincarnation real? It had always been, What 
vision of the self does reincarnation ask us to believe in? I found 
something appealing about the vision of selfhood it suggested: 
porous and unoriginal.” This is the embrace of projection as its 
own kind of truth — something that indicates a feeling instead of 
indexing a fact. In another essay, “52 Blue,” Jamison writes about a 
famously lonely whale that has inspired an odd culture of devotees. 
After cataloguing the various tributes people have paid — an album 
or two, a tattoo, thousands of online posts — Jamison broadens her 
scope: “52 Blue suggests not just one single whale as metaphor for 
loneliness, but metaphor itself as salve for loneliness … Loneliness 
seeks out metaphors not just for definition but for the companionship 
of resonance, the promise of kinship in comparison.” Her topic 
gracefully slides away from the messy specificity of projection to 
the generalities of longing. It’s an incredibly sympathetic move. You 
could say Jamison’s topic has moved from suffering to longing, or is 
simply following the mandate she set out in 2014: “empathy requires 
knowing you know nothing.”

Restlessness and reason in the work of Leslie Jamison

Christopher Street in Manhattan’s West Village was covered in 
romantic mood lighting. A long time ago, I saw a man, Ben, sitting 
there looking sickly and unable to move. Now, he sat in his rocking 
chair looking out the window of his first floor apartment. My 
highschool friend, Taco, and I clung to the outside window ledge just 
as I had when I was young.
The string lights made a beautiful archway from Hudson Street to 
Bleeker. He has had the same first floor apartment at Christopher and 
Bedford for almost 50 years, from the afterglow of Stonewall to the 
AIDS epidemic. Ben lived through existing as a gay man in the South, 
being shunned by his parents, then moving to New York City alone, 
and living there from 1970 until he died. He had two or three partners. 
None of them I knew. 
I’ve spent summers living with Uncle Ben since I was 10 years old, 
while I was working with American Ballet Theater. He would take me 
to five dollar massages after class and draw baths for me with epsom 
salt. I always loved how his bathroom window stood about 20 feet 
away from the backstage of the Off-Broadway Lucille Lortel Theater. 
I was surprised by many naked introductions with actors performing 
there. 
Taco, Ben and I skipped up Christopher Street. He danced through 
the twinkling lights like a puppet and seemed to barely stay tethered 
to the ground. Taco and I held a blueish, heavy orb in our hands. It 
was going to cure Ben’s cancer. We smiled as a horse carriage trotted 
down from Central Park and stopped right in front of us. 
It was almost evening, everyone just leaving their nine-to-five jobs. 
They waved and smiled at him as his puppet body jumped into the 
carriage overflowing with a bed of roses. All the restaurants that had 
closed down opened again. The Peruvian place, Hudson Deli, the 
Lucille Lortel Theater was overflowing with patrons. Diane Keaton 
was there. He called it his sleepy little village. 
The streets were full. Uncle Ben laughed and wiggled his frail, 
puppet body. So happy was this man who had survived so much. It 
was almost like a concert. People danced through the streets while 
they went on their way, no doubt to find their own families. Maybe 
that’s why Ben was so happy, knowing he was not alone.
We gave Ben the orb. The heavy nature of it weighed him down. 
His puppet arms hung low from his shoulders. He smiled at us, but he 

was confused. Because he had seen so much death, he didn’t think it 
would ever happen to him. 
“You’re my last roommate,” Ben said to me. One year before, I 
walked out on him because he was mad I left my t-shirt on the TV 
box. He had a peculiar and sad look on his face. 
After one long last look around, he let the orb roll back down the 
roses, out of the carriage and into a gutter. Taco and I scrambled to 
catch it. By the time I turned back around, the carriage was gone. The 
lights and the roses were gone, the patrons were replaced by people 
wearing felt hipster hats. It was all gone. Taco was even gone. His real 
name was Zachary.
Night replaced twilight. I looked at my phone, expecting to see 
notes of condolences, but he had no one. His community was swept 
away in the ocean of AIDS. His existence was an afterthought of 
tragedy.
When I was small, he bought 
me a bubble blower. I’d send the 
bubbles out onto Christopher 
Street late at night from his first 
floor window. People would 
gather below. I’d laugh with 
delight as all walks of life poked 
at the bubbles. Uncle Ben sat in 
the corner, drinking Two-Buck 
Chuck, laughing with me. 
When Uncle Ben was dying, 
he said to be by my grandmother, 
his big sister. He said there’s 
something I can’t understand, the 
death of a sibling. When Ben and 
my grandmother were younger, 
their little brother died — run 
over by a drunk driver. Their 
little brother was six. I have one 
brother. Siblings are the closest 
thing to you that you will ever get.
I didn’t know what to say to 
“There is something you can’t 
understand.” I’m 20. He’s 70. I’m 
sure there are loads of things he 
understands that I won’t for a 
very long time. 

Love and loss in the age of forgetting

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK

NATALIE KASTNER
Daily Arts Writer

People have been writing murder mysteries for years. One of 
the most common murder mystery tropes is to limit the possible 
suspects to a small group of people in a small, enclosed location. 
It happened with “Clue,” with “Murder on the Orient Express” 
and now it’s happening again, with Rian Johnson’s (“Star Wars: 
The Last Jedi”) “Knives Out.” Only this time, the pool of suspects 
is made even more interesting because it’s limited to the victim’s 
money-hungry family. 
In the film, Harlon Thrombey (Christopher Plummer, “Sound 
of Music”) is the family patriarch found dead, presumably killed 
by 
one 
of 
his 
many 
shady 
and 
suspicious 
family 
members, 
most 
of 
whom 
stand 
to gain from his 
death. There’s his 
daughter 
Linda 
(Jamie Lee Curtis, 
“Halloween”), 
who wants her father’s mansion, his son-in-law Richard (Don 
Johnson, “Django Unchained”), who’s having an affair, Joni (Toni 

Colette, “Little Miss Sunshine”), his widowed daughter-in-law 
who tries to leech off of him and his college-aged granddaughter 
Meg 
(Katherine 
Langford, 
“13 Reasons Why”), to name a 
few. All stereotypical suspects 
for a somewhat stereotypical 
mystery idea. Daniel Craig 
(“Casino Royale”) plays Benoit 
Blanc, 
the 
odd, 
Southern-
accented detective trying to 
find the killer.
The idea behind “Knives 
Out” was foolproof — from the 
trailers and pictures, it seems 
that the whole film is supposed to be about 
finding out who killed Harlon Thrombey. But 
the problem is that what the movie claims to 
be is different from what it actually is. It’s 
marketed as a “whodunnit,” but it isn’t quite 
that. 
Frankly, the best parts of the movie were 
three of the most important characters in it: 
Harlon Thrombey, Ransom Drysdale (Chris 
Evans, “Captain America: The First Avenger”) 
and Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas, “Blade Runner 2049”). Plummer 
captures the role of quirky, slightly senile billionaire incredibly 

well. There wasn’t a scene with him where I doubted his portrayal 
of the character. He clearly cared about his family and felt genuine 
compassion towards his nurse, 
Marta. Chris Evans, despite 
only really appearing halfway 
through the film, was one of 
my 
favorite 
performances. 
In an incredibly un-Captain 
America-like role, he plays the 
initially jerky, spoiled grandson 
of 
Thrombey. 
He 
provides 
sorely 
needed 
comic 
relief 
and quickly becomes a fun, 
favorite character. De Armas, 
in a dramatic opposite to Evans, plays a genuinely compassionate 
and doting nurse to Thrombey. The movie primarily follows her in 
her attempt to help Blanc discover the truth behind Thrombey’s 
death. 
I enjoyed watching this film, but I wouldn’t say it was what 
I expected by any means. I expected a traditional, enclosed 
murder mystery with some unexpected twist. Instead, I got an 
untraditional half-mystery with an unconventional “twist” that 
I somehow both wasn’t expecting and saw coming a mile away. 
It was still fun, just not the kind of fun I thought I’d be getting. 
“Knives Out” isn’t what it claims to be, so don’t be disappointed 
when it’s different from what you expected.

‘Knives Out’ isn’t traditional, but isn’t disappointing

Knives Out

Michigan Theater

Back in the day, one of the benchmarks for being a great 
rapper was the ability to tell a 
story well. The ability to paint a 
vivid picture of life made some 
rappers into either mainstream 
icons 
or 
underground 
legends 
that inspired the icons. It could’ve 
been a story about anything. On 
“Da Art of Storytellin (Pt. 1),” 
Big Boi and Andre 3000 recount 
their individual experiences in 
the pursuit of women. Raekwon 
and Ghostface Killa’s “Heaven 
and Hell” tells the story of the 
duo’s experiences on the block 
in 
Staten 
Island. 
Organized 
Konfusion’s “Stray Bullet” follows 
the harrowing journey of a stray bullet after it leaves the barrel 
of a gun. On “Morals and Standards,” Mac Dre recounts a story 
of betrayal and vengeance between former friends. Big L’s 
“Casualties of a Dice Game” details just that — the casualties of 
a corner game of dice. These songs are just a handful of visceral 
and vivid examples of the power of storytelling in rap; the list 
could go on forever.
Despite a rich history of storytelling across rap’s many regions 
and subgenres, somewhere along the way the art of storytelling 
was lost. Rappers are still telling stories, but storytelling is no 
longer the main measure of a rapper’s skill. However, every so 
often, the art of storytelling re-emerges, and this is usually a 
good thing. In the past 10 years, there have been several attempts 
to bring back storytelling from figures like Kendrick Lamar and 
J. Cole, and the end product has been good. The series of songs 
from Meek Mill and Speaker Knockerz are examples of what and 
what not to do to properly execute the art of storytelling.
Meek Mill’s “Tony Story” series (part one released in 2011, two 
in 2013 and three in 2016) and Speaker Knockerz’s “Rico Story” 
series (all three installments released in 2013) both recount 
similar stories. Speaker Knockerz, over a series of icy trap beats 
similar to those of his hits like “Dap You Up” and “Lonely,” 
tells the story of a man down on his luck named Rico who, after 
attempting to rob a bank with his girlfriend, is sent to jail and 

meets a man named Pedro who introduces him to the dope game. 
Things quickly spiral out of control, Rico kills his girlfriend 
who turned out to be an undercover cop, Pedro shoots Rico in 
the head, the two reconcile and eventually succumb to their 
fast lifestyles. Similarly, Meek Mill, aided by a set of cinematic 
and hard-hitting instrumentals, 
tells the story of two friends, Tony 
and Ty, who eventually turn on 
each other, resulting in the deaths 
of Ty at the hands of Tony and of 
Tony at the hands of Ty’s cousin 
Paulie. The “Tony Story” continues 
as it follows the rise and fall of 
Paulie, ending as Paulie is shot 
and arrested by the police after 
shooting his pregnant girlfriend 
who alerted the police of Paulie’s 
crimes. Both stories are deeply 
sad and urgent accounts that delve 
deeper into the problems within 
the system of America. Importance 
aside, the “Tony Story” is often considered one of the best 
modern examples of storytelling 
while the “Rico Story” is nothing 
more than a few deep cuts from a 
promising young artist who died 
way too soon.
This raises one question: How 
are two series with similar stories 
regarded 
so 
differently? 
Both 
series tell heart-wrenching stories 
that continue to be written in cities 
across America, yet one stands 
full-bodied and the other falls flat. 
It comes down to storytelling. 
Speaker 
Knockerz 
tells 
his 
story 
point-blank, 
using 
only 
the occasional adlib to provide 
variation. He seldom attempts to 
rhyme more than the last word 
of each line, and there is little 
wordplay. Outside of the heavy, drowning autotune and the 
occasional “Damn” and “Oh my God,” the Columbia, South 
Carolina rapper shows little emotion. He tells a heartbreaking 
story, but instead it sounds like he’s slick-talking. Simply put, 

there’s no vividity. There’s very little variety. Speaker Knockerz 
tells a story, but he is not storytelling. 
Meek Mill, on the other hand, is a storyteller. The Philadelphia 
rapper isn’t always known for being the most poignant or 
insightful rapper, often falling prey to classic hip hop tropes, 
but the “Tony Story” series is different. Not an anomaly, but not 
commonplace either. He tells us every little thing about Tony, 
Ty and Paulie. Each song in the “Tony Story” series perfectly 
describes every scenario and situation. It’s like listening to an 
audiobook — that’s how much detail there is in these songs. “Tony 
Story 2” is especially vivid as Meek explains, through his words 
and his robust delivery, the paranoia induced in Paulie due to his 
lifestyle and choices, rapping, “And Paulie he ain’t slipping, yeah 
he got that thang on / You know what he did to Tony, he won’t get 
the same song so / When he hit the crib he spin the block before 
he park it / Paulie ain’t bitch he just cautious / But little did he 
know n***** in the streets talking / And out his rearview its like 
he seen a reaper walking.” Meek’s rhymes aren’t otherworldly, 
but they’re still complex, using end rhymes and internals as he 
carefully explains Paulie’s every move. He still has the modern 
rap prerequisite slick talk, but it doesn’t hurt the songs. Instead, 
it adds to them, perfectly accenting the more substance-heavy 
lines. Meek is so specific with his 
imagery and emotional with his 
delivery, it’s almost like listeners 
are watching every event unfold in 
real-time through the entire series 
is. It’s masterful.
The difference between Meek 
Mill and Speaker Knockerz is 
clear. Each song from the “Rico 
Story” series feels like reading the 
newspaper, matter-of-fact and to 
the point. With each song from the 
“Tony Story” series, though, Meek 
paints a full picture, mincing no 
words in the process, and that’s 
what 
storytelling 
is 
supposed 
to 
do. 
That’s 
the 
difference 
between simply telling a story 
and storytelling. There’s emotion, 
imagery and insight when someone is storytelling; none of that 
is there when someone just tells a story. On the outro of “Tony 
Story 3,” Meek exclaims that “Tony Story 4” is going to be a 
movie. As if the previous three installments were not.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | DECEMBER 4, 2019

O

n a Thursday afternoon, I sit in the Crazy Wisdom 
Tea Room overlooking Main Street with nothing 
but my laptop. I sip an herbal blend as I think 
about the days I used to spend in the Chem Building atrium 
glued to textbooks and coursepacks, chugging Peace Teas 
for sustenance.
I, like many here at Michigan, started off pre-med. Actu-
ally, I set on the track in middle school. In my naivety, I 
equivalated wanting a career where I can help people exclu-
sively with pursuing medicine. It was easy to be pre-med 
in high school, when it was all talk at family holidays, but 
when college rolled around and I actually had to take pre-
med courses, being pre-med conflicted with my other pas-
sion: English. I loved all things in the world of prose: editing 
people’s work, reading liberally and, of course, writing. I 
spent hours chasing the euphoria of crafting a sentence pre-
cisely how I envisioned it in my head, the perfect amalgam 
of words, contractions, modifiers and phrases in the most 
felicitous sequence. My first semester in college, I decided 
I would double major in biomolecular science and English.
Unknowingly, joining copy at The Michigan Daily was my 
first act of rebellion. I knew it was a deviation from the pre-
med track, but at the time, I rationalized the choice within 
my pre-med mindset. It was a manageable amount of time 
to spend on an extracurricular — a three hour commitment 
per week — and I could tie it back to being advantageous for 
a pre-med skillset I would eventually discuss at med school 
interviews. I would explain our fact checking as an exten-
sion of research outside the academic world; that being in 
a section of The Daily founded on style and grammar rules 
and the implementation of them demonstrates my commit-
ment to compliance and integrity. Copy was supposed to be 
a way to feed the other English-loving side of me, to fend off 
hunger while focusing on STEM pursuits. I wasn’t prepared 
for how much I would enjoy it.
Copy was a space to focus on what I loved: the writ-
ten language. At The Daily, I spend hours fixating on style 
decisions, demolishing all Oxford commas and allowing 
my inner grammar geek to shine. Quickly, I was reminded 
of why I fell in love with the English language in the first 
place. The em dashes, the lofty ellipses, the profound ability 
of twenty six symbols to prescribe a world of actions, things, 
emotions — there was so much to love! But once I left the 
doors of The Daily, I was chained to the coursepack or the 
lab notebook pages or the lecture slides I still didn’t under-
stand. 
Suddenly, I was divided in every way between my two 
interests: I was taking orgo and genetics — with Cultural 
Rhetorics and the Art of the Essay. I was writing freelance 
for an online magazine, whilst on the board for the Ameri-
can Medical Women’s Association. I watched others man-
age pre-med with humanities or social sciences majors and 
thought I could do it too, but often found myself out of bal-

ance, pre-med consuming too much bandwidth. I couldn’t 
keep up anymore: I was being split in half. I had to choose.
I wish I could say leaving pre-med was a black and white 
decision. There were parts of being pre-med that I loved 
— working through challenging orgo mechanisms, study-
ing gene mapping and antibiotic resistance in bacteria, and 
working in my research lab at Michigan Medicine — that 
made it reasonable for me to imagine sustaining the path. 
I was doing fine academically — I just wasn’t happy. It was 
easy to excuse current misery for the future hope of hav-
ing a white coat, to offer up personal happiness to the pagan 
gods of medical school admissions. But there was something 
more: every late night I would spend in the Ugli studying for 
my STEM classes reminded me of how much I wanted to be 
spending my time doing other things (and well, not be at the 
Ugli at 2 a.m.). 
I missed feeling my hands zip across a keyboard, trying to 
snag every tendril of inspiration before it escaped my mind. 
I missed reading for leisure, soaking in glorious language of 
someone else’s mastery over their craft. It took a long time 
for me to realize that I wasn’t pre-med — I just had pre-
med coursework clogging my schedule. Whatever excuses 
I came up with for not changing — parental pressure, being 
too far along or just being afraid of not knowing what I 
would do without the comfort of the 
predetermined ten year medical track 
— it always boiled down to the same 
common denominator: the only thing 
standing between leaving this path and 
going down another was myself.
It’s a senior year cliche, but of course, 
I can’t help but look back and wonder 
if I would do anything differently. Of 
course I would. I spent two years trying 
to get excited about something I wasn’t 
completely passionate about. I was so 
fixated on being this version of myself 
I had created when I was in middle 
school, when I was too young to even 
understand who I was, much less who 
I would end up being. If I had listened 
to what my present feelings were telling 
me, I would have realized my childhood 
dream of being a M.D. was my current 
nightmare and was only holding me 
back from accomplishing all I wanted to 
do at this University. I wish I spent less 
time worrying about rerouting, instead 
of just doing it, even if I didn’t know 
where it was going.
The truth is, I don’t know what I 
want to do after undergrad any more 
now than I did when I first stepped foot 

on this campus. But I’m okay with that. We often forget we 
are here to cultivate a toolbox of skills and to collect experi-
ences rather than figure out what we are going to do with 
our lives. We spend too much time trying to pin down our 
path rather than validating our curiosities, too much time 
ignoring what gets us truly excited, because it isn’t what we 
first set out to do. Being pre-med gave me one of the most 
important lessons I’ve taken out of undergrad so far: you 
may not know what you want to do, but you’ll know when it’s 
something you don’t. And now, I am so happy that the path 
I’m on allows me to wander to the Crazy Wisdom Bookstore 
and peruse the book covers, to edit articles at the copy desk, 
and of course, to write.
Ironically, my senior year of high school, I had come to 
similar conclusions without realizing it. For my high school 
newspaper, The Bagpiper, I wrote a piece on choosing a 
career for my last article at the paper. The last words I wrote 
right before heading to college seem aptly appropriate for 
here:
“All in all, it boils down to this: you only have one life. And 
in that life, you are going to spend about 35-45 years work-
ing. That equates to 1,715-2,205 work weeks, and 69,600-
88,200 hours of work in your lifetime. Wouldn’t it be nice if 
you actually enjoy it?”

Copy that: An autopsy of my two years in 
pre-med

ILLUSTRATION BY MAGGIE WIEBE


I

n September of this semester, I made one of, if not 
the most, significant purchases of my 21 years to 
date: a houseplant.
But this purchase wasn’t just your standard, run-of-
the-mill desktop succulent (though don’t get me wrong, 
I have one of those too). This was a glorious fern, with 
slender green branches overflowing from her pot and 
smelling of earth and living things; carefully selected 
from her almost-but-not-quite as equally formidable 
peers at the Ann Arbor Farmers Market.
Late September in Ann Arbor is an unequivocally 
wonderful time of year. The city becomes the setting of 
those homey-feeling movies I watched as a child, the 
kind of films where kids run through crunchy leaves to 
catch the school bus and the perfectly-coiffed mother 
has a plate of fresh baked cookies on the counter every 
afternoon. 
Late September in Ann Arbor is when 
color-coding class notes is exciting, not 
draining; when every fleeting moment 
of eye contact from the boy who sits by 
the door in class feels like a budding 
new love affair; when I’m suddenly 
grasped by the all-consuming desire to 
buy a houseplant for my room.
A fern is not a freshman year of 
college purchase — where would it have 
fit in my South Quad dorm? Would it 
live between the mini-fridge stuffed 
with bags of Franzia and the piles of 
undone laundry? A fern is also not a 
sophomore year of college purchase — 
the year seven friends and I crowded 
under the roof of a shoddily-maintained 
house with squirrels living in the walls 
and a dishwasher overgrown with 
mold; when we huddled together in the 
living room in winter to try and stay 
warm while the windows rattled from 
lack of insulation. Junior year, perhaps, 
but the one semester I spent in Ann 
Arbor during this era was too largely 
spent anticipating the next semester 
abroad to even contemplate committing 
to something as serious as a houseplant. 
So here I was, late September in 
Ann Arbor, a senior with a Kerrytown 
apartment finally nice — or rather, 
clean — enough to justify buying a fern. I was feeling in 
love with life in the way that I always am during this time 
of year, thrilled to be back in my own college town after 
a semester abroad, ready to set down roots for a while. 
And so my new fern friend entered my life.
Said purchased fern took her rightful place on my 
mantel. Yes, my room this year has a MANTEL — 
seems fake to me too. In her new home, my fern nestled 
between stacks of books and other colorful knick knacks 
I crowded around her. An old doll swiped years ago from 
my grandma’s extensive collection, a $2 ceramic jar from 
Salvation Army, an old perfume bottle, all came together 
to create the perfect bohemian scene — framed against a 
backdrop of an old map of Paris, lest anyone forget that I 
went abroad.
For a week at least, I wouldn’t shut up about my new 

houseplant. Owning a plant, a real plant that’s not a 
minimal maintenance succulent, felt huge. Assuming 
sole responsibility for a living, growing thing was a task 
that I was ready and able, excited even, to take on.
And it wasn’t all giving, either — my new fern friend 
contributed just as much to my life as I exchanged in 
the currency of water and the opening of blinds. A room 
with a living, green entity feels drastically different than 
a room without. My personal space was alive, revitalized, 
reflecting the buoyant late September energy I was 
feeling toward school and life and things to come.
But somehow September has a way of ending, and 
October also has a way of stumbling by, and before 
anyone seems to have time to consciously process it, it 
becomes November in Ann Arbor. 
And November in Ann Arbor is fundamentally, 
monumentally different from September in Ann Arbor.

November in Ann Arbor is when the sun starts to set at 
5 p.m., when you walk out of class and it’s already night 
and the tips of your ears are somehow always freezing. 
November in Ann Arbor is skipping class to try and catch 
up for another class and falling deeper into a hole of being 
behind — the constant pressure of impending deadlines 
building up until the only task that feels doable is curling 
up under comforters in bed. November in Ann Arbor 
is when the shadow of job and internship applications 
becomes unavoidable, hovering ominously over the 
collective college consciousness and making its presence 
known at every possible opportunity. Friends sit across 
from each other at tables in Espresso Royale or the Ugli, 
so wrapped up in their own anxieties and thoughts that 
conversation feels stifled, fake and forced. November in 
Ann Arbor, in a word, is bleak.

Four years later, this bleakness still catches me by 
surprise. I was raised in an eternal summer — in the 
valleys of Southern California where the sun washed 
out and blurred together months. November was but 
an abstract concept. Growing up, I’d pictured the joy of 
September; an image pieced together through books and 
back-to-school displays in Target that sung the praises of 
orange and red trees and apple cider. Christmas movies 
and Budweiser commercials had given me a romanticized 
view of December with fresh, beautiful, clean white snow 
and carols and falling in love at skating rinks.
What lay in between, however, was an entirely new 
animal. Nobody makes movies about November.
And November is somehow even worse this year 
— because I can see the physical manifestation of the 
month in my fern, the friend that I purchased in that 
wave of late September optimism and sunshine. She’s 
a little brown around the edges 
these days — I’ve watched as the 
leaves at the tips of her branches 
crisp up and flutter down. The 
promise my fern exuded during 
those early autumnal days feels 
a bit diminished, dried up, passé.
Which of course makes me feel 
enormously guilty. I probably 
haven’t 
been 
watering 
her 
enough, or maybe too much? I 
definitely don’t always remember 
to open the blinds before I leave 
for class in the morning. As 
November has worn me down, it’s 
also worn down my capacity to 
look after living beings — whether 
that be my fern, my friends, 
or myself. November tends to 
feel like an excuse to draw into 
myself and listen to Bon Iver for a 
month, without investing myself 
in the opportunities and people 
and going-ons around me — a 
hibernation more acceptable in 
previous years when I didn’t have 
a living, green entity dependent 
upon me for her very existence. 
But I think my fern is going 
to 
pull 
through. 
On 
closer 
examination 
the 
other 
day, 
it’s really only the tips of a few branches that have 
gone entirely brown, and there’s even a few sprigs of 
fresh growth poking out from the pot. She’s definitely 
struggling a bit more than she was in late September, but 
also most certainly still alive and fighting.
My fern and I are still helping each other out. I’ve 
been trying to water her more regularly, and she’s 
still putting out some nice green living energy into my 
personal space during a time of year when everything 
else can feel gray.
And — most importantly — November is almost over. 
Which, I think, can be agreed upon as being a very good 
thing. And as much as I believe that November is just a 
universally bad time for the houseplants of the world, 
I also simultaneously have a feeling my fern is going to 
love December in Ann Arbor.

Love Letters to Ann Arbor: On 
houseplants and November

T

he University of Michigan had a total enrollment of 
48,090 students in fall 2019, but apart from people 
flooding Ingalls Mall during Festifall or joining the 
crowd walking toward the Big House on game day, there has 
seldom been a moment I’ve felt the weight of how huge the 
University actually is. People are constantly bustling through 
the Diag, earbuds in, laughing with friends or climbing up the 
steps to Hatcher. However, I’ve never seen such concentrated 
effort and clear community support as on March 15 and Sept. 
20 for the Washtenaw County Climate Strikes. University 
students and community members alike showed up en 
masse to speak out against Ann Arbor’s and the University 
of Michigan’s complacency in the climate crisis and the need 
for immediate, direct action. While activism and protests on 
campus have occurred around me for all five of my semesters, 
the climate movement has made itself visible and loud — 
despite the University’s unwillingness to listen.
The University has a well-documented history of student 
activism that ranges from widespread participation in the civil 
rights movement in the 1960s to strong anti-war efforts during 
the Vietnam War. Students at the University have historically 
invoked their freedom of assembly as a response to social 
and political change off campus and to promote institutional 
accountability and awareness in Ann Arbor. 
Today, students continue this legacy by organizing protests, 
teach-ins, social media campaigns and strikes. They do so with 
the goal of addressing injustices the University has seen in 
recent years — acts of racism on campus, controversial sexual 
misconduct policies and the obvious lack of climate action 
efforts. While the scope of these movements can vary student 
activists have been deliberate in using grassroots organizing 
to make their causes accessible while making clear demands 
for local action. 
Past student activism — particularly the anti-apartheid 
movement — reflects the obstacles institutions create for 
activists who are fighting to have their needs met. The anti-
apartheid movement was prominent on campus from the mid-
1970s to the late 1980s, and was fueled by nationwide protests 
at universities with investments in corporations linked to 
apartheid in South Africa. These conversations were part of 
great political, economic and ethical discourse, not only in Ann 
Arbor, but across the entire U.S. On March 16, 1978, the Daily 
published a near-full page spread headlined “How nation 
views S. African holdings,” with two separate subsections 
titled “Congress frowns on investments” and “Business, unions 
join debate …” The piece includes an editor’s note commenting 
that this article preceded the University’s Board of Regents 
monthly meeting where the board was expected to discuss 
what to do — if anything — about University investment in 
South African companies.
The piece outlines the arguments for and against divestment 
following a report to the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign 
Relations’s Subcommittee on African Affairs, where it was 
determined “the net effect of American investment has been 
to strengthen the economic and military self-sufficiency of 
South Africa’s apartheid regime.” This led to three different 
recommendations by Congress, which included cutting U.S. 
credit to South Africa, denying tax credit to U.S. corporations 
paying taxes to the South African government or withholding 
the official endorsement of private groups that defend South 
African investment. While none of these recommendations 
were direct divestment, the subcommittee commented on the 
potential need for stronger action, should the recommendations 
prove ineffective.
The 
prominent 
national 
conversations 
regarding 
investments were focused on by students and The Michigan 
Daily. As The Daily reported on March 18, 1978, then-editors 
requested the Board of Student Publications to “withdraw 
the paper’s assets from University investment pool” in protest 
of the Regents’ inaction on divestment from South African 
companies. The request was denied. 

The Daily then reported more in-depth on the board’s 
decisions in its March 19, 1978 edition. 
It was explained that the board “adopted Regent Thomas 
Roach’s resolution, which calls on the University to vote at 
shareholders’ meetings in favor of reforming the apartheid 
governmental and social structure in South Africa.” 
This resolution also called for the University to write to 
other corporations to encourage the adoption of the anti-
discriminatory Sullivan principles, which are two corporate 
codes of conduct that promote corporate social responsibility.
To contextualize anti-apartheid sentiment on campus, South 
African graduate student Leonard Suransky commented to 
The Daily for the March 19, 1978 article: “The name University 
of Michigan goes before you and echoes around the world. … 
Always the term education is linked to morality … we are not 
going to change South African policy by politicking with our 
stocks.”
The inaction of the board caused a continual push for 
change, with activists making their concerns and voices 
known and causing significant strife between the board and 
the Washtenaw County Coalition Against Apartheid. This led 
to mass demonstrations in and outside board meetings, with 
events like the March 15-16, 1979 Board of Regents meeting 
where WCCAA organized a protest with over 200 students, 
demanding a review of South African investment and its 
immediate divestment. This prompted the board to issue a 
temporary restraining order against WCCAA — and the arrest 
of two students. University 
President Allan Smith, in a 
letter to the public, emphasized 
that the Regents’ agreement 
to review investments was 
strong enough, and the need 
for “action now”, which the 
students were calling for, was 
inappropriate.
Small wins came alongside 
more student protests, and 
demonstrations 
regarding 
both 
divestment 
and 
the 
administration’s 
silencing 
of student activism became 
routine. On April 19, 1979, the 
Regents meeting was protested 
by 
WCCAA 
participants 
wearing gags, who had stated 
through a press release that 
“we are gagged today because; 
a) the Regents have used the 
courts to stifle the spirit of 
the Open Meetings Act; b) 
for two years the Board of 
Regents have avoided open 
discussion of divestment; c) 
in South Africa, to call for 
divestment is a violation of the 
Terrorism Act of 1967, which 
is punishable by a minimum 
sentence of 5 years and a 
maximum sentence of death.” 
These 
protests 
continued 
alongside the board’s votes 
against divestment, until May 
1979, when “the University 
divested $227,647 from Black 
and Decker Manufacturing 
Company.”
With 
help 
from 
the 
Michigan legislature — led 
by state Rep. Perry Bullard, 
D-Ann Arbor — legally-driven 

divestment became possible. Student protests continued 
to draw attention to the anti-apartheid movement at the 
University, and the protests continued well into the late 1980s 
as the University fought legal battles against state bills, 
particularly Bullard’s House Bill 4553, which was eventually 
signed into law on Dec. 31, 1982 and became Public Act 512. 
This act forced the divestment of Michigan public colleges and 
universities from South African companies, and the University 
had until April 1, 1984, to completely divest these stocks.
While the University fought in court against the law, 
largely over semantics regarding the “unconstitutional 
intrusion upon the powers and the authority of the Regents 
to direct expenditures of the University’s funds,” they did 
come to the “90% Solution,” which divested the University 
from all American corporations that operated in South 
Africa, excluding those with significant impact in the state of 
Michigan.
In the same way that longstanding, public protests 
against apartheid led to campus awareness and support, 
environmental activism has been extremely visible following 
the mass participation of locals and University students in the 
March 15, 2019 Washtenaw County Climate Strike. This strike 
was part of the Global Climate Strike and Fridays for Future 
movement created by environmentalist Greta Thunberg in 
August 2018. The demands of the Washtenaw County Climate 
Strike, an initiative put together by a number of Ann Arbor 
climate activism groups, including but not limited to the 

University’s Climate Action Movement, included a subsection 
titled “Stay Committed in Good Faith: Create Ambitious 
Climate Goals and Accountable Decision-Making Processes,” 
which was echoed by a sit-in staged in the University’s Fleming 
Administration Building following the rally. 
At this March sit-in, protesters had one demand before 
they would agree to leave: President Mark Schlissel commit 
to having a minimum one-hour public meeting moderated 
by a student of the organizers’ choice. Ten protesters were 
then arrested. And despite Schlissel’s letter to the Climate 
Action Movement six days later, following the arrests, in 
which he agreed to meet this single demand with a public 
session that was subsequently planned for and held April 9, the 
charges against the climate protesters continued and are still 
continuing. Calls for the administration to drop these charges 
has become a central push of climate activists, with the 
Climate Action Movement circulating a petition that currently 
has more than 700 signatures. 
The Climate Action Movement is “a coalition of University 
stakeholders … that are driving the President, Regents and 
Deans to enact sustainability policy and ethics that reflect 
the values of the broader U of M community with a focus on 
the commitment to, and attainment of, carbon neutrality.”
U.S. News & World Report published a piece headlined “10 
Universities With the Biggest Endowments” in which the 
University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, was ranked eighth with 
an $11,733,013,000 end of fiscal year 2018 endowment. The 

article defines university endowments as “the value of their 
investments based on donated money and financial assets, 
which can total billions of dollars,” and contextualizes the 
use of these funds across university expenses. A National 
Association of College and University Business Officers 
study from earlier this year, examining 802 U.S. colleges 
and universities, found that an average of 49 percent of 
endowment funds are dedicated to student scholarships 
and financial aid programs, while others are funelled into 
university projects, like the construction of residence halls.
With this understanding of the endowment in mind, the 
topic of divestment has been contentious between climate 
activists and the University administration, with Schlissel 
publicly stating in his April 9 public session that “Essentially, 
we don’t divest. It’s not this cause, it’s essentially all causes. 
… We get more payout from our endowment here than we get 
money from the state of Michigan, so it’s really critical for us 
as a robust university. … If we begin the process of narrowing 
what the endowment can invest in, based on very valid 
arguments and concerns from sincere people, the ability to 
invest shrinks, the value of the endowment goes down and 
the institution suffers. We’re just not going to divest.” 
Despite the endowment’s vast economic complexity and 
the administration’s dedication to maintaining a robust and 
open business strategy, the Climate Action Movement stands 
behind the push to divest the $1.12 billion the University has 
invested in natural resources according to the 2018 Report of 
Investments. Natural resources 
are defined in the report as 
“investments 
in 
companies 
located primarily in the U.S. that 
produce oil and natural gas, and 
companies that service those 
industries, as well as non-energy 
related investments in minerals, 
mining, and wetland restoration.” 
Despite 
Schlissel’s 
statements 
concerning the lack of will of the 
University to divest regardless of 
the cause, members of the Climate 
Action Movement have a clear 
basis to point back to the historical 
precedent of the anti-apartheid 
movement. There are reasons for 
the economic separation between 
the 
University 
and 
ethically 
problematic industries.
When discussing the call for 
divestment and the response of 
the administration, Sasha Bishop, 
a member of the Climate Action 
Movement and Ph.D. student in 
ecology and evolutionary biology, 
stated “one of the arguments 
that we’ve heard a lot from the 
University is that the endowment 
is not political, right, but they 
have actually in the past taken 
the stance that it is, given the 
instances where they divested 
from apartheid and tobacco.” 
Contextualizing the Climate 
Action Movement with pushes 
against 
morally 
abhorrent 
investment from the past gives 
clarity to the extent to which 
student activism must go in order 
to 
receive 
credible 
attention 
from influential institutions like 
the University. In the case of 
apartheid, it took years of student 

protests to prompt the involvement of the state legislature, 
which led to the University’s eventual push toward the 
blatantly clear and ethical choice of divestment. With the 
20/20 vision that historical hindsight gives, the University’s 
eventual, 90-percent divestment from South Africa can 
be seen as a stand against the wrongdoing of an oppressive 
government and something to proudly stand behind — 
despite the University’s shameful years-long fight against 
moral political activism.
Dim Mang, LSA senior and Climate Action Movement 
member, cited two of the Climate Action Movement’s 
biggest demands — divestment from fossil fuels and carbon 
neutrality by 2030 — and commented on the importance of 
care when working with a coalition. She stated that “Working 
in coalition with whether it’s undocumented rights or 
affordable housing … we are trying to be as supportive as 
possible. But our main goals have really been the divestment 
from fossil fuel initiatives, and then carbon neutrality.” 
Mang then went on to comment on the University’s 
response to the activism she’s been involved with on campus. 
According to Mang, “They have the same response to all 
student activism, which is that they’ll give you just a little bit 
so that they can kind of keep you at bay, but they won’t give 
you what you actually need to be able to sustain and do the 
work you want to do.”
Climate activists have echoed Mang’s frustration over the 
University’s cosmetic responses to the activism happening, 
with solutions that only work to placate the movement. 
This is evident in contradictory actions like Schlissel’s 
April 9 public session, despite the University’s choice 
to continue prosecuting the climate activists who were 
arrested on March 15 to have this meeting. Or the creation 
of the President’s Commission on Carbon Neutrality which is 
intended to “(develop) recommendations for how to achieve 
carbon neutrality for U-M, as well as develop scalable and 
transferable strategies that can be used by other institutions 
and larger communities to achieve the same goal.” However, 
the University does not allow the commission to discuss 
either divestment or the expansion of the Central Power 
Plant, an institution that continues and will continue to tie 
us to fossil fuels.
As a touted research institution, with an entire school 
dedicated to sustainability and the environment, the 
University is aware of the dangers of climate change. Climate 
change is upon us. It was stated at a U.N. General Assembly 
this March that there are only 11 years left to prevent 
irreversible damage from climate change. But for many 
communities of color, low-income communities, indigenous 
communities, members of the LGBTQ community and other 
marginalized peoples, the time is already up and the effects 
are already real. Climate action must come now, and the 
University must listen to the voices of its students and faculty 
who refuse to accept complacency. Climate action is ethical 
social justice, and it must be prioritized.
The University continues to respond to climate activism 
with a mixture of appeasement and suppression, but student 
activism must go on and pressure the University to take 
the proper stand against the climate crisis. It is laborious 
work, but necessary in making student voices heard. Bishop 
ended our interview by commenting on the importance 
of student activism on the University campus. After citing 
the University’s mission statement “to serve the people of 
Michigan and the world” she stated “And so in that sense, 
from my perspective, at least, (the University is) beholden 
to actually listen to students when they are saying that 
something is wrong. The University is not actually serving 
the people of Michigan, and the people of the world in the 
way that it should be. … And when it comes to climate change, 
we really are talking about the subject of the entire planet.”

I 

like pristine things. Here’s my 
ironclad logic: If it’s new, it’s 
going to be more durable. The 
pristine condition seems like a guaran-
tee of quality. The moment when I peel 
off the screen protector of my brand-
new phone is a defining point when I 
can start calling myself the owner of a 
quality product. A shiny new, unused 
object speaks to me, “I’m yours now!” 
I’m protective of new things, espe-
cially new books. I would turn each 
page slowly to not leave a crease on the 
paper. Sometimes, because I have the 
habit of reading while eating, I would 
accidentally drop a drip of salad dress-
ing on the page. I would stare at the 
spot blankly and curse at my careless-
ness. It’s almost as if I defiled the chas-
tity of the book.
I forgave myself, however, when I 
left a drop of vinaigrette dressing on 
a used book. Many people cringe at 
used books, even if they are in very 
good condition. They say, “How do you 
know the book hasn’t gone through 
some funny business in the hands of 
the previous owner? What if they pick 
their nose while reading the book? 
What if there is some pathogen hiding 
between the pages?” But most of these 
people lick their fingers when they 
finish a bag of chips, even after eat-
ing without previously washing their 
hands. Their attitude becomes ironic. 
Maybe they are right. I seem to have 
too much confidence in book owners. But I also have faith 
in my immune system, so I’m willing to take the risk.
Used books do annoy me sometimes. Like when the 
previous owner does too much marking in the book. I 
can relate to them; I’m also the type of reader who enjoys 
underlining, scribbling, drawing smiley faces, and writ-
ing “LOL” on the side. But the markings of other people 
distract me most of the time, and they lead me to focus 
on the wrong lines. My solution is to erase all the pencil 
marks carefully. The process takes a few minutes because 
I have to do so gently, making sure that I don’t wrinkle 
the paper. However, this method fails when the marks 
are written in ink. I would need to use an entire bottle of 
white-out to mask those.
While those little notes written between the margins 
can be annoying, they are also my favorite things to look 
for. One time, as I was about to fall asleep reading Kant’s 
“Critique of Pure Reason”, I found the word “sapiosex-
ual,” written in smooth, beautiful handwriting. I had to 
use Merriam-Webster to look the word up, and when I 
found its meaning I understood that whoever wrote the 
word was expressing the admiration for Kant’s legend-
ary mind. Maybe they went too far by saying that they 
are attracted to a philosopher from the 18th century, but 
I get the gist. Intelligent people are sexy, and we have a 

word for it.
Another rare find in used books is personal inscription. 
Most of the readers are too lazy (myself included) to leave 
such a thing. I own a copy of Bill Bryson’s “A Short His-
tory of Nearly Everything”. On the first page, someone 
writes: “To expand your already comprehensive knowl-
edge.” The note is signed off with an “x”. My knowledge 
is for sure not comprehensive, so I almost blushed a little 
reading this short line. Whenever I was too lazy to turn 
the pages, this little note leaped into my head and yelled: 
“Live up to that standard!” So I read on, and finished the 
book at an unprecedented speed.
Fortunately, I have easy access to used books. Within 
walking distance, there is a used bookstore called Dawn 
Treader. When I step inside, it’s almost as if I’m in a 
hoarder’s house — a hoarder who only cares about books. 
It’s a sea of books. I can place my eyes at any spot in the 
store and see books. There is that distinct old book smell, 
which I also call “the smell of time.” I can never stop 
myself from taking a huge breath when I walk in, or open 
a book that has remained unopened for years. I would 
then, inhale a large number of dust particles. There were 
times that I started sneezing immediately, but I didn’t 
blame the books. I simply feel relaxed in the space. I can 
freely sit on the stool and flip through the pages. The 

bookstore offers great prices for anything one finds in 
there. It’s the only place where I have the confidence to 
walk up to the register without even looking at the price.
A boutique bookstore is just down the street. Beauti-
fully decorated, every genre of books carefully laid out, 
newest books always on display with hand-written staff 
reviews. There is a lovely café upstairs. They are also 
the only place that sells authentic Japanese stationery. 
Everything is pristine here. Almost every book they sell 
is in the hardback edition. This means that I can guar-
antee a price tag above $20 when I flip to the back of the 
books. Somehow, the place doesn’t seem genuine. I feel 
confined, and almost guilty if I read a book without buy-
ing it. Under the delicate, sophisticated appearance, they 
set up an obstacle between the books and their custom-
ers. Knowledge becomes a luxury at places like these.
So I spent a lot of time wandering around Dawn Tread-
er, and have bought countless books there. They have set 
up the perfect image of a bookstore: a place that carries 
knowledge and nothing else. No fancy decorations, no 
coffee, only knowledge. One day I will leave this city, and 
all my books will go to Dawn Treader. Here’s my goal: 
for the benefit of their next owners, I shall minimize the 
scribbling I leave in my books, so the lineage of knowl-
edge can carry on.

V

iolence in Chile is an idea that 
I tie closely to my parent’s 
generation. Sept. 11, 1973 — a 
day that echoes in the history of Chile.
Sept. 11 was the date of the mili-
tary coup that would redefine Chilean 
politics, economics, and by extension, 
society. The coup brought on a com-
plete overhaul of the health care sys-
tem (loosely based on the American 
system), failing schools, poor pensions 
and even the systematic privatization 
of water.
It marked the beginning of two 
decades of violence. It was on this day 
when the CIA-backed military took 
the country away from the people and 
with the mantra of national recon-
struction, completely altered the fab-
ric of Chile. Those decades would be 
marked by systematic political repres-
sion and the persecution, torture and 
murder of dissidents. 
The consequences of Sep. 11 are not 
just a traumatic memory for Chileans: 
The day’s legacy lives on in the coun-
try. 
But now I am seeing violence play 
out during my lifetime. Violence lives 
on in response to the protests that 
broke out in Chile about a month ago. 

Onlookers are in shock as the often-
lauded capitalist success story is going 
up in flames. But to really understand 
what is happening in Chile, we first 
have to understand its history.
F

rom abroad, Latin America 
is a region plagued by eco-
nomic and political instabil-
ity. Uncertainty is a word that thrives 
in Latin America, and it takes hold of 
every political party — left or right. 
Systemic corruption runs in Chile and 
the rest of Latin America. 
But it wasn’t always like that. 
We need to think about the history 
of Latin America with an understand-
ing of the broader geopolitical context. 
From the late ’40s to the early ’90s, the 
United States fought to contain com-
munism during the Cold War. Dur-
ing this time, the U.S. government, 
through its use of the military and 
the CIA, enacted policies to expand 
American dominion beyond its geo-
graphic boundaries. Through econom-
ic engagement, both by private means 
and 
government 
treaties, 
military 
intervention or regime changes, Amer-
ica imposed its free-market ideology 
on to the rest of the world, including 
Latin America. 

In Chile, the 1960s 
and ’70s represented 
an era of social hope. 
Chile was one of the 
first 
countries 
to 
freely elect a social-
ist president, and with 
the election of Salva-
dor Allende in 1970 
lay the promise of a 
prosperous Chile. But 
this social hope was a 
threat to the American 
ideological project. 
In one fell swoop, 
everything 
changed. 
What took place in 
the country instead 
was the fast transfor-
mation of a neoliberal 
dreamland. At its core, 
this resulted in dereg-
ulation 
and 
priva-
tization 
of 
several 
facets of government 
as well as the devel-
opment of a state that 
guaranteed the rights 
to 
promote 
private 
entrepreneurship. As 
a result of the history of 
American intervention, Chile is now 
witnessing the growing inequality of 
its people. The imposed political trans-
formations have left in their wake the 
displacement and destruction of entire 
communities and a country unable to 
reconcile its political divide under a 
crumbling neoliberal banner.
T

he idealized image of Chile’s 
success story is now frac-
turing as a result of recent 
protests. What originally began as 
unrest because of an increase in sub-
way tariffs has transformed into a 
countrywide movement of Chileans 
demanding economic reform and the 
expulsion of its President Sebastián 
Piñera. Chileans are crying out in 
favor of better access to health care 
and education, pension system reform, 
nationalization of natural resources, a 
crackdown on government corruption, 
recognition of indigenous rights and a 
new constitution that replaces the one 
written during the dictatorship. 
But the president has responded 
to the surge of protests with hostile 
words and actions. He first declared a 
state of emergency, a right of the state 
that has not been invoked since the 

dictatorship (1973-1990). Along with 
an enforced curfew, the state of emer-
gency was intended to ensure private 
order by restricting people’s civil lib-
erties, movement and right to assem-
bly. Piñera has even gone so far as to 
claim that Chile is at war with people 
he deems are “enemies of the state.” 
He has sent about 10,000 armed mili-
tary personnel to Santiago and other 
areas to contain the growing unrest. 
Though he has since taken the mili-
tary off the streets of Santiago, prom-
ised higher pensions, better health 
coverage, higher taxes and even sup-
ports a referendum to write a new 
constitution, these promises are not 
enough to get people off the streets. 
The people do not believe his words. 
And how could they trust their govern-
ment? 
Official reports of human rights 
violations are circulating, but the gov-
ernment does not take responsibil-
ity, and social media is flooded with 
accusations of biased reporting. There 
are videos of police snorting cocaine 
to remain more vigilant circulating 
on social media. There are videos of 
people being taken from their homes 
on Facebook. It was recently reported 
that a destroyed subway stop, Estación 
Baquedano, was being used as a tor-
ture room. Women have claimed to be 
sexually abused after getting arrested. 
Countless photos are circulating of 
people getting shot in the eye and los-
ing their vision. 
These drastic measures are reopen-
ing the wound of the dictatorship. It 
is invoking the memory of a violent 
past into a turbulent present. These 
protests may have been started by stu-
dents, but they are now fighting hand 
in hand with older generations who 
survived the dictatorship. The time-
line of Chile’s history is blurred on the 
streets of Santiago and beyond. The 
cries of the past are echoed in the cries 
of today.
Piñera is wrong. Chile isn’t at war 
with enemies of the state, Chile is still 
fighting the oppressive legacy of the 
dictatorship. It was never about the 
30 pesos tariff increase. It is about 30 
years of political repression and a peo-
ple whose desire for an equal and wor-
thy life has endured. What lies at stake 
is the opportunity for a rebirth of the 
country, one that can finally lay to rest 
the bones of the dictatorship.
