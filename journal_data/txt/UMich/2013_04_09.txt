LOUISVILLE 82, MICHIGAN 76

Title dreams fall
one game short after
Wolverines stumble
By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Editor
ATLANTA - For the third
time in their lives, the members
of the Fab Five had to look on in
despair as another team sealed a
National Championship from the
free-throw line.
After the Michigan men's bas-
ketball team dominated most of
the first half, Louisville stormed
back in the final minutes of the
opening stanza to capture the

game's momentum.
The Cardinals never relin-
quished it, winning the 2012-13
National Championship, 82-76.
"Sometimes you'd rather
lose by 10 or 15 than four or five
because you're so close," said
junior guard Tim Hardaway Jr.
"This is definitely the best game
that I played in. You're in the
National Championship and you
can't really beat it. I'd trade every
game before this just to get this
game back.
"It hurts, it really hurts."
Louisville (14-4 Big East, 35-5
overall) spent much of the second
half attempting to pull away, only
for Michigan to continually fight
back. But the Wolverines could

never quite get over the hump
after leading for more than 19 of
the game's opening 20 minutes.
While Michigan's youth didn't
show in the first half - fresh-
man point guard Spike Albrecht
carried the Wolverines with 17
first-half points - it was the Car-
dinals' experience that bested a
tired-looking Michigan squad in
the second half.
But in agame marred by errant
officiating, one incorrect foul call
might have ultimately sealed the
game. After completing a mon-
strous alley-oop to freshman
forward Glenn Robinson III to
cut the deficit to three - send-
ing Michigan fans into a frenzy
- sophomore point guard Trey

Burke appeared to cleanly block
a Peyton Siva lay-up attempt.
Burke was whistled for a foul,
changing the tide of the game, as
Siva hit two ensuing free throws.
"I guess the ref thought it was
a foul," Burke said. "I thought I
had all ball and timed it up pretty
good. Unfortunately, you know, it
didn't go that way.
"I think that was a turn-
ing point. ... It could have been
momentum. If it was a no-call,
we could've gotten possession.
We can't go back on that now. It
was a foul."
The Wolverines (12-6 Big
Ten, 31-7 overall) later cut their
deficit to four via the charity
stripe - they entered the bonus

with 11 minutes to play - but
the Cardinals never let it get any
closer. With under a minute left,
Michigan forced a miss but after
corralling the rebound, fresh-
man guard Caris LeVert stepped
out of bounds with 52 seconds
remaining. Louisville was even-
tually sent to the free-throw line,
where it iced the game.
Michigan has been on both
sides of stunning comebacks,
both in regular-season losses to
Wisconsin and Penn State, and
most recently, a double-digit
comeback win over Kansas last.
weekend. It was those games
that left the Wolverines believing
until the clock finally expired.
"We fought for 40 minutes,"

Burke said.
"There was never a point in time
that we gave up.... They were the
better team today."
While LeVert's miscue was
certainly a crushing blow, Michi-
gan coach John Beilein admit-
ted he mishandled the ensuing
possession. Beilein, coaching
in his first Final Four, mistak-
enly thought the Cardinals
were already in the bonus and
instructed his players not to foul.
That blunder, along his decision
to leave both Burke and fresh-
man forward Mitch McGary in
the game when each had four
fouls allowed precious seconds to
tick off the clock, thwarting any

One of the event's attend-

he remains optimistic for the

CSJ calls for electoral reform in

Demerit system
questioned after
two years of cases
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
For the second consecutive
year, the Central Student Gov-
ernment presidential elections
didn't end when polls closed.
Concluding more than a week
later after multiple hearings,
the Central Student Judiciary
gave its verbal, but unofficial,
opinion upholding the Univer-
sity Election Commission's deci-
sion to disqualify LSA juniors
Chris Osborn and Hayley Sakwa,
forUM's executive candidates,
on Saturday. Several justices
expressed displeasure about the
decision.
During the hearing, Engineer-

ing senior Chris Stevens, chief
justice of CSJ, said it "sickens"
him for another election to be
decided by court cases and that
assembly needs to be more pro-
active in avoiding these situa-
tions.
"Every year it seems like the
assembly just enacts something
that basically tries to address
only the previous year's prob-
lem," he said.
Stevens said he also felt there
are flaws in the demerit system
for rule violations.
In an interview wafter the
meeting, Stevens said while
he did not feel it was his place
to suggest changes to the elec-
tion code, changes must be
made.
"I just feel it's necessary - and
my duty - to express frustration
because we shouldn't be encoun-
tering a situation each year
where we have to rule on this,"

he said.
Law School student Zack
Stillings, a CSJ justice, said he
thought Osborn was the choice
of students even though he was
found guilty of influencing stu-
dents while voting.
"This man over here won by
500 votes," Stillings said, point-
ingto Osborn.
Stillings added that it's imper-
ative that students are not incen-
tivized to file complaints for
competitive reasons.
LSA junior Lukas Garske, the
CSG student general counsel,
defended the UEC.
"You have to make a decision
you don't want to make some-
times," he said. "That's what it
boils down (to)."
In response to Stevens's claim
that the assembly needs to enact
preventative legislation, Garske
said, there's "an ambiguity that a
party can find and exploit."

Fires lit in A streets


At least seven fires
reported, two on
'U' property
By TAYLOR WIZNER
Daily NewsEditor
In tune with Saturday's post-
game activities, Ann Arbor fire-
fighters responded to several
fires after Michigan's loss to
Louisville Monday night.
There were at least seven
fires, according to Daily and
law enforcement reports. Two
of the fires occurred at Univer-
sity parking lots. Six of the fires
involved objects burning, and
five involved couches, while one
involved a mattress.
According to reports, there
were two fires located on White
Street, as well as one on Church
Street, one near Michigan

Street and East University Ave-
nue, one on Greenwood Avenue
and two on University property
- one at a parking lot on Hoover
and Brown Streets and one at a
School of Nursing parking lot.
At the first White Street fire,
off McKinley Street, a couch
was engulfed in flames as more
than twenty students looked on.
One person repeatedly tried to
throw a large trash can in the
fire, but it was removed twice by
onlookers. Police arrived first
on scene to manage the crowd.
Shortly after, two fire trucks
arrived at the scene and quickly
put out the fire. One student was
taken away from the scene in
handcuffs.
Later on in the evening, there
was a mattress fire at White
Street at a location near the
previous fire. Police officers on
scene said both fires happened
in front of the same house.

Michigan's loss Monday.
after loss
Police investigated the house
nearest the burning mattress
and found what they described
as a Molotov Cocktail - a beer
bottle filled with a liquid and
cloth, according to an officer on
scene. Firefighters and police
officers entered the house and
an inebriated man was taken
away by an ambulance. It is
unclear if the man was arrested.
UMPD spokesperson Diane
Brown said the small fire at the
School of Nursing parking lot
did not burn for long and was,
quickly extinguished by fire-
fighters.
The last fire observed by the
Daily - in the University park-
ing lot on Hoover and Brown
Streets - was a couch fire. Offi-
cers on scene could not confirm
when or how it started.
AAPD Lt. Renee Bush could
not be reached for sufficient
comment on any fires.

"It was a coaching error,"
Beilein said. "That falls on me as
a coach."
Burke sat for much of the first
half and finished the game with
24 points, but no other Michigan
player - aside from Albrecht's
magnificent first half - could
string together any offensive out-

dition of "The Victors," and one
trio of students paused to polish
the Diag's bronze block "M" with
paper towels.
Between these moments of
reserved spirit, groups formed
and then dispersed, shouting and
encouraging bystanders to "start
a riot." While a few belligerent
students tore down a student
organization poster and called
for others to participation, the
group scattered.
Students looking for drunken
high-fives filed past officers from
half-a-dozen jurisdictions. More
than 20 officers, including some
posted on rooftops with cameras
to oversee the intersection, were
posted on the corner of Church
Street and South University Ave-
nue.

pionship, a pair of unheralded,
un-recruited reserves stole the
nation's brightest spotlight in the
opening 20 minutes.
Burke got off to a hot start,
scoring Michigan's first seven
points, to give the Wolverines
a 7-3 lead, but two early fouls
demoted him to the bench for
the half's final 15 minutes. With
the Fab Five looking on from the
stands, Beilein played all five of
his freshmen on the courttogeth-
er for the first time since a Dec. 1
road game at Bradley.
Albrecht came through in the
unlikeliest of ways, knocking
down six of his seven field goals,
including four 3-pointers, for a
game-high 17 first-half points. An
Albrecht layup at the 3:56 mark
gave Michigan an 11-point lead
- its largest of the half. Led by
Albrecht, the freshmen scored
26 consecutive straight first-half

points for the Wolverines.
"The whole world saw what
Spike Albrecht is all about,"
Hardaway said.
Albrecht said his hot shoot-
ing was reminiscent of his high-
school days.
"When I go out there, I'm con-
fident," Albrecht said. "I wanted
it so bad."
Added Burke: "If there was
a point guard I want coming off
the bench, it's Spike Albrecht.
He's going to make plays for you.
He may not win the look test, but
he's going to make plays for this
team.... I wasn't surprised by his
performance today."
But a ferocious 14-1 Louisville
run that included four consecu-
tive 3-pointers from walk-on
forward Luke Hancock gave the
Cardinals their first lead, 36-35,
with 22 seconds remaining. Two
Michigan free throws sent the

Wolverines into the locker room
with a one-point lead.
Despite recapturing the lead,
though, it was apparent Lou-
isville had seized the game's
momentum. With 13:50 left, the
Cardinals regained the lead and
never looked back.
"They gained that momentum
and I think that's a bad idea when
you're playing against a team
with that capability," Hardaway
said. "That's what got them to
win - that momentum going into
that second half."
Burke, expected to declare
for NBA Draft in the near future
said that while he expects some
of his teammates to recover from
this loss in the coming days, it'll
haunthim for a long time.
"It might take two or three
weeks," Burke said. "Sooner
or later, I'll have to get over it,
mature from it and grow."

Al- Qaida

As of 1:15 a.m., there were no
serious incidents on South Uni-
versity Avenue. The last time
the University won the NCAA
Championship there was around
$80,000 - about $160,000 today
adjusted for inflation - in dam-
age to the area.
On Main Street, fans poured
out of bars with 1.1 seconds left
in the game in low spirits and
turning to one another for a
friendly hug. Despite Burke's
inevitable upcoming departure,
many expressed optimism for
the 2013-2014 season.
"They played their best game
of the season, and sometimes you
don't come out on top," Dental
School student Scott Ribitch said.
Santiago "Yago" Colas, an
associate professor of Latin
American and comparative lit-
erature who teaches a course,
teaches a course on the cul-
ture of basketball. He said the

national championship compe-
tition has brought more basket-
ball excitement to the campus
than any time since the Fab Five
era.
"This particular game, I can't
imagine any Michigan fan that
feels anything less than proud,
regardless of the outcome. The
kind of psychological equipment
to handle that pressure is some-
thing they learn from one anoth-
er," Colas said.
Colas also happens to teach the
basketball team's five freshmen:
forwards Mitch McGary and
Glenn Robinson III, and guards
Caris LeVert, Spike Albrecht and
Nik Stauskas.
"My sense is that it was a
little bit more intense back in
the early 90s, you know? Obvi-
ously, the student body today
is definitely excited, and every-
body's got their maize and blue,
but back then it was such a new

thing," Colas said. "What the
Fab Five were and what they
did went so far beyond just their
efforts on the court and their
representation of the University
- they were a cultural phenom-
enon."
Chris Webber, the most suc-
cessful of the Fab Five after
college, made a surprise appear-
ance at the championship game
in Atlanta. In nationally trend-
ing online letter published April
3, Colas encouraged Webber to
attend the game to show sup-
port for the University and the
program.

Saudi national Saeed
al-Shihri is alive,
according to
militant websites
SANAA, Yemen (AP) - Al-Qai-
da in Yemen posted a statement
on militant websites Monday say-
ing that its second-most senior
commander has not been killed. It
was the second time the group has
denied Saeed al-Shihri's death.
The Saudi national, who fought
in Afghanistan and spent six
years in the U.S. military prison
at Guantanamo Bay, is "alive and
in good health," according to a
senior al-Qaida cleric in Yemen
and the group's media arm, al-
Malahem. The cleric, Abu-Saad
Al-Aamly, posted the claim on his
Facebook account.
It came as nine people were
killed in separate incidents of vio-
lence throughout Yemen. Also,
its capital city was without elec-
tricity on Monday after militants
attacked electricity cables con-
necting Sanaa to the province of
Marib, where an oil pipeline was
also blown up.

active of the group's offshoots.
A Yemeni police official told
The Associated Press that securi-
ty forces mayhave been too quick,
announcing al-Shihri's death in
January, based on information
from Saudi Arabia. The official
spoke anonymously because he
was not authorized to release the
information to reporters.
Yemeni security officials had
claimed the al-Qaida commander
was killed by a U.S. drone strike.
The country's state news agency,
SABA, reported in January that
al-Shirhi was in a coma after a
missile attack in late November,
but did not make clear if he had
died.
Yemen had previously

announced al-Shihri's death in
September last year. A DNA test,
however, proved that the body
recovered was not that of al-Shi-
hri. A monthlater, al-Shihri denied
his own death in an audio message
posted on Jihadi websites.
In the northeastern province of
Marib, armed tribesmen were sus-
pected of being behind an attack
on oil pipelines and electricity
pylons that led to a power outage
in the capital, Sanaa.
Sabotage attacks on oil pipelines
are common in Marib, which is
flush with weapons and where the
government has little control. The
more than 430-kilometer (260-
mile) oil pipeline carries around
100,000 barrels of oil a day. Simi-
lar acts of sabotage in December
caused $310 million in losses.
Some of Marib's tribesmen
maintain cordial ties with al-
Qaida, while other tribal chiefs
there are suspected of being allied
with former President Ali Abdul-
lah Saleh. The attacks appear to
be aimed at underminingthe new
government, which has responded
with deadly air strikes.
Four people, two soldiers and
two tribesmen, were killed Mon-
day in Marib when a group of
tribesmen attacked a military
checkpoint in the area of Sarwah,
accordingto security officials.
Officials also said that troops
loyal to the former president
killed three protesters in the city
of Radda, about 160 kilometers
(100 miles) south of the capital.
Two soldiers from the Republi-
can Guard, still led by Saleh's son
Ahmed, were also killed in clashes
with protesters and police.
The Republic Guard is an elite
army unit that was once the back-
bone of Saleh's 33-year rule. The
security force was supposed to be
reorganized and brought under
the control of the Defense Minis-
try according to orders by Presi-
dent Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi,
but those changes have yet to
materialize on the ground.
Officials said that the troops
in Radda forced residents to close
their stores and blocked roads
leading to the city on Sunday,
prompting the protests on Mon-
day. It was not immediately clear
why the troops forced businesses
to close, but security officials
said they suspect it was linked to
efforts by Saleh's loyalists to dis-
rupt a national dialogue aimed at
mapping outthe country's future.
All officials spoke anonymously
in line with regulations.

MHappy month strives to lessen
April stress through events

The Happiness
Initiative planning.

By STEPHANIE SHENOUDA
Daily StaffReporter
With the dawning of the end
of the semester and exams on
the horizon, the month of April
is often associated with stress for
students.
Engineering senior Pete
Wangwongwiroj, co-founder of
The Happiness Initiative, is pro-
moting health by implementing
a month-long schedule of events
and activities to help students
relax in a fun way.
"We understand that col-
lege students are under a lot of
pressure to get high GPAs, have
impressive resumes and con-
form to a journey that will set

them up for high achievement,"
Wangwongwiroj said. "It ulti-
mately results in unhappiness,
and people can't enjoy college,
which everyone always says is
the happiest time of your life."
Wangwongwiroj said the goal
of MHappy Month, along with
providing constructive outlets
for stress relief, is to "put stu-
dents in control of their own
happiness" and allow them to
act in "a more proactive way."
MHappy's main event is a
TED-style conference, titled
"What Makes Life Worth Liv-
ing," to encourage interaction
with faculty on a more personal
level. The four-hour event will
take place April 15 at the Rack-
ham Amphitheater.
"We interact with faculty a
lot every day, but we don't really
know them," Wangwongwiroj
said. "Hearing their stories will
allow students to establish a bet-

ter connection and, hopefully,
inspire people to pursue their
passions, which ultimately lead
to happiness."
Other events include yoga in
the Diag and exercise classes
open to students.
Since this program is new this
year, Wangwongwiroj is excited
about its momentum and hopes
it will eventually become insti-
tutionalized as an annual or
year-long University event.
The Happiness Initiative is
being supported from Universi-
ty Health Services, Counseling
and Psychological Services, and
the Central Student Govern-
ment.
E. Royster Harper, the Uni-
versity's vice president for
student affairs, said students'
mental and physical health isthe
most important thing: "students°,
are worth more than any test
grade."

"We are a busy lot. That's the
whole point. We can't take away
the classes; we can't take away
the anxiety that sort of takes us
up, but we can be a loving com-
munity while we go through
that," Harper said. "By loving,
I don't mean a syrupy kind of
loving, but a supportive, caring,
encouraging kind. We're not
going to run out of As. We some-
times behave like there's not
going to be enough As or enough
Bs, and we've got to knock of
each other to get them, and that's
not true."
Harper added that the main
initiative of the program is to
encourage students to be delib-
erate about their happiness and
stress management.
"If the flowers ever pop up,
we can enjoy those too," Harper
said. "We're really trying to be
intentional about the kinds of
things we do."

Lester Monts
speaks to
committee
about diversity
By STEPHANIE SHENOUDA
DailyStaffReporter
Diversity and inclusivity
were again main points of dis-
cussion Monday as the Senate
Advisory Committee on Uni-
versity Affairs voted to endorse
a statement on the topic.
The proposal will be present-
ed to the full Senate Assembly
on Wednesday.
Though the proposal would
have gone before the Sen-
ate Assembly regardless of
SACUA's consent, the faculty
governance body voted to
endorse the proposal in a 6- 1
vote, with one member abstain-
ing. At last week's meeting,
SACUA members requested a
number of revisions to an ear-
lier draft.

The proposal calls for more
socioeconomic and racial diver-
sity in the admissions process.
Because of the ban on race-
based admissions in the state of
Michigan, the University is lim-
ited in its ability to recruit stu-
dents from underrepresented
backgrounds.
Biology Prof. Kate Barald,
a member of SACUA, said her
experiences working with
minority undergraduate and
graduate students shaped her
decision.
"I interact with these stu-
dents every single day, so I hear
what they have to say about
their own educational experi-
ences at the universities from
which they came," Barald said.
"They feel their voices are sim-
ply not in the discussion."
SACUA Secretary John
Lehman expressed some skep-
ticism
"I'm just saying don't get your
hopes up too high that this will
sail through," Lehman said. "I
absolutely think that anything
this historic that comes around

is what Senate Assembly exists
for. It basically allows them to
say: 'Let's debate on this topic."'
It is currently unclear how
effective the proposal would
be. Though John Carson,
associate professor of histo-
ry and a member of SACUA's
Committee on University
Values, feels it is already
become a "de facto alterna-
tiv." and believes the diversity
achieved will likely be socio-
economic, not racial.
Lester Monts, senior vice
provost for academic affairs,
also spoke about diversity.
He said the University faces a
unique set of challenges that
makes it difficult to compare
its admissions system to other
institutions.
"We are not able to absorb
large numbers of students, and
there are a number of local and
regional issues that we need to
address," Monts said.
Monts said the University
has traditionally drawn a sig-
nificant number of black stu-
dents from the Detroit area,

but since many families have
migrated to the suburbs, some
plans would miss the mark in
achieving an equitable system.
He particularly took issue with
the "Top-10 Percent Plan," used
in Texas, where the top-10 per-
cent of each graduating high
school class in the state auto-
matically receives admissions
offers from Texas state-funded
universities.
"If we went with a hypo-
thetical 10-percent plan for all
Michigan high schools, you
would get 10 percent of the
lowest performing Michigan
high schools in Detroit, and we
would miss many of the under-
represented minority students
in the suburbs because many of
them could be admitted under
the holistic approach for admis-
sions," Monts said.
Monts added that this was
a "good effort but the increas-
ingly competitive nature of the
admissions process presented
issues that could need further
consideration.

[)OM TH DAI)Y
Covert (in)action
Transparency should guide administrative decisions, not cover-ups
ver the last few years, there seems to be a frightening trend with
university scandals: Keep it under the rug until the issue gains
attention. Last week, Rutgers University joined a growing list of
colleges met with dishonest athletics personnel when men's basketball
coach Mike Rice was fired after videos of his perverse coaching style were
leaked. Rice's abusive behavior included throwing basketballs at players'
heads, grabbing and shoving athletes in practice and screaming homo-
phobic slurs and obscenities at every turn. "You're a fucking fairy," he told
players repeatedly. "You're a fucking faggot." While the school eventually
fired Rice after national outrage on April 2, Rice's abuses were initially
concealed, with Rutgers Athletic Director issuing Rice a suspension and
fine in November without detailing the reasons why. College administra-
tors must stop waiting for public outrage to react to corrupt behavior.

Y ou know, I'll be honest: I've
never really cared much
about sports here (Editors
note: Melanie's
in the Residential
College). But as
I sat on the steps
of 420 Maynard
on Monday
night, just two
Hamm's deep,
I realized -M MELANIE
there's a lot that KRUVELIS
I could've gotten
from this game.
Not as a Wolver-
ine, not as the one-time owner of a
muscle tee, but as a human being. A
selfish, firework-loving sonuvabitch.
Slash human being.
There could've been a parade. A
goddamn parade. I didn't even think
of that until two minutes were left.
We were down - and no, apparently
a five-pointer couldn't save us now.
A co-worker turned to me, and with
the saddest eyes you've seen this
side ofa basset hound'said, "There
was supposed to be a parade." A
parade that Greek life would've actu-
ally stumbled to! Can you imagine?
Shotgunned Natty Lights, neon tank
tops made for each block walked -
National Champions at the intersec-
tion of State and Hill, okay, now at
State and Monroe. The entire Uni-
versity, a sea of yellow and blue and
whatever color best describes barfed-
up Burnett's Peach.
I bet local meteorologist Chuck
Gaidica would've made it too: cry-
ing, lifting up his own Burnett's in
solidarity.
Dream a little dream, Michigan.
There could've been fireworks.
Like, a lot of them. But now I stand
in front of the Michigan Union,
half-melted Frosty in hand, won-
dering if those booms are coming
from stockpiled cherry bombs or
sad AK-47s. Supporters of the Sec-
ond Amendment have feelings too,
you know.
And to think, the texts I could've
received from my mom. "WE DID

IT!!!!!" she would say. "MELANIE,
I'M SO PROUD!!!!" Five excited
Emojis would've followed - that
jubilant crying face, maybe the two
twinsdoinga sidestep. She wouldn't
have even sent me frantic texts
when I didn't immediately respond
because she would just know: I was
tanked. And, boy, would she have
been right.
Instead? "Melanie, I have two
charges from Amazon on my debit
card for a nose ring and ukulele
strings. Don't you ever think about
anyone but yourself?"
The helicopters circling over
Ann Arbor would've sung a differ-
ent tune. The propellers would've
chopped "Let's Go Blue," the
engine would shoot out glitter and
exhaust fumes - screw the Fed-
eral Aviation Administration, we
were champions. But now I'm not
even sure if I'm walking toward
the Jimmy John's on Ann Street or
downtown Baghdad.
And the Diag. Oh, for the love of E.
Royster Harper, the Diag. Those five
gawky engineers shouldn't be stam-
mering through chants of "Fuck
Louisville!" They should be spitting
fight songs! Or, at the very least, just
spitting. But the final buzzer rang,
Trey Burke was yanked from the
Player of the Year trophy, and the
only thing the 62 people watching
The Michigan Daily's livestream
of the Diag saw was 20 dudes from
Shady Phi pounding each other in
the chest (Editors note: Don't forget
cryingbetween ass slaps). Off in dis-
tance, the familiar sound of no one
gettinglaid.
The whole thing's a hard shot
to swallow. After all, it has been
nearly two decades since we could
get Football-Saturday drunk on the
Monday before finals. It wasn't just
our pride on the line comrades, but
an opportunity to bring together
our current students, our loyal
alumni base, our diehard, non-affil-
iated Wolverine fans who've never
even stepped foot in the UGLi, but
always smell like stale beer and

corn nuts.
What could've been.
But here we stand - or if you're
outside Scorekeepers, wobble - wal-
lowing in what we bacne-ridden
Wolverines like to call "reality." No
more Get Out of Jail Free cards, folks:
Today marks the end of classes gen-
erously canceled by proud professors
who just wanted one last keg stand.
We may never know how it feels
when a graduate student instructor
cuts discussion short because they
know we've all had a "rough night"
rooting for the team at Rick's Ameri-
can Cafe - well, unless we transfer to
Michigan State.

Anyone got a trash
can I can knock
over?

When videos from the team's practices were
released in November, it became clear that
Rice's coaching style was offensive, harmful
and represented Rutgers University and the
athletic department in the worst way possible.
Rice's choice of coaching language is unaccept-
able and is physically and emotionally abusive.
From calling his players "motherfuckers" and
"sissy bitches" to calling out a player from
Lithuania the "Lithuanian faggot," Rice turned
everyday practices into a degrading environ-
ment. This behavior is far from acceptable, and
in no way resembles the mutual respect that
should define a coach-player relationship. The
fact that Rutgers athletic department allowed
such behavior to continue in the first place isan
embarrassment, and the lack of disclosure sur-
rounding Rice's initial penalties mirrors other
scandals that recently have damaged other
athletic programs.
However, the players on Rutgers Univer-
sity basketball team came to the aid of Rice.
"He did a lot for us off the court," argued
AustinJohnson, a sophomore forward. While
the opportunity to play for Rutgers may

have increased opportunities for the play-
ers, Rice's coaching style certainly did not.
Instead of teaching players that this behavior
is acceptable, universities need to take a more
proactive role in ensuring the fair treatment
of players. An often repeated, yet underval-
ued aspect of college athletics is that these
athletes are indeed students first, and should
be protected as such. Ignoring such abuses
doesn't guarantee championships; it only
proves that universities aren't acting in the
best interest of their students.
Cover-ups and pacified abuses shouldn't
be synonymous with college administra-
tion decisions. From the Pennsylvania State
University scandal to underreporting sexual
assault at our own University, colleges across
the country seem to be sticking to a pattern
of waiting to defend their actions until the
actions become public. These institutions
that praise transparency in practice need to
start acting with their values in mind. Wait-
ing until a news report surfaces only serves
to damage these schools, and by extension,
their students.

Times are tough, I know. But
when push comes to shove, we've
got to remember what we still have.
Like white dudes lighting couches
on fire. Moms wondering what hap-
pened to their Pottery Barn sofas.
An entire campus, drowning in
faded maize and blue melancholy,
wondering if the five hours spent
waiting for a table at Blue Lepre-
chaun was worth bombing another
Economics final. But if there's any-
thing we've learned since the Fab
Five era, it's that together we stand
strong. Like the brightest constella-
tion in the sky or the clouds parting
to reveal a magnificent, Wolverine
sun, we must remember -
Wait,AthleticDirectorDaveBran-
don used to own Domino's Pizza,
right? Does that mean we missed out
on free Parmesan Bread Bites?
Goddammit. Anyone got a trash
can I can knock over?

Our place at TEDxUofM

4

Last Friday, the Power Center was ablaze
with the untapped potential of TEDxUofM.
Above the energy of more than 300 attendees,
20 inspiring talks and a delicious lunch, one
theme stood out to us: social justice.
Some ofus have been to TEDxUofM before,
but never have we seen so many different
advocates for equality on stage in front of us.
TED stands for Technology, Entertainment
and Design - seemingly not leaving much
room for people like us. We spend our time on
campus encouraging dialogue across identi-
ties and advocating for environmental justice,
immigrant rights and educational equality.
But on Friday, we happily found nine
inspiring speakers who had social justice as a
central theme throughout their talks.
Michael Williams, a Detroit native and
current Semester in Detroit student, asks
us to see beyond the dominant narrative of
Detroit as a broken city. Instead, he encourag-
es us to honor the complexities of a city where
concentrated poverty, hipsters, vacancy and
gentrification all exist in one vibrant place.
Williams provokes us to see the immense
value of Detroit and its strongest asset: the
people. They, more than any new startup or
outsider reinvestment campaigns, are going
to lead Detroit's rebirth.
Then we have Julie Steiner, graduate of the
School of Natural Resources and Environment.
She has devoted countless hours to ending
poverty in Arizona, fighting for civil liberty in
Tennessee and lobbying for women's rights in
Washington before returning to Ann Arbor to
serve as the inaugural director of the Univer-
sity's Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness
Center. Now, Julie's mission is to end homeless-
ness in Washtenaw County. Her diverse work
experiences are tied together by a common
thread: a passion for social justice.
Evelyn Alsultany spoke to the negative
media portrayal of Muslims and Islam and its
impact on American society. She discussed a
study of 900 films, where only 12 had posi-
tive portrayals of the Muslim community. In
all other films, Muslims were portrayed as
harem women, oil tycoons or terrorists. She
invited us to wrestle with the idea that these
stereotypes aren't entirely false, but rather
that those stories are incomplete.
Recently released after serving 26 years
in prison, Mary Heinen courageously called
attention to America's system of mass incar-
ceration. Focusing primarily on the struggles
of re-entry, Heinen explored the stigmatiza-
tion that ex-prisoners must face when they

leave the confines of the prison walls. Mary
also stressed the importance ofstrong support
networks, continued education and personal
expression in helping to interrupt the school-
to-prison pipeline. She currently works with
the University's Prison Creative Arts Project
to give voice to people like her - people strug-
gling to survive in a system with far too many
institutional barriers.
The final speaker of the day was Chris
Armstrong, recent alum of the University
and the University's first openly gay student
body president. Chris brought to light the
ugly truths of bullying, as he shared stories of
those who've taken their own lives as a result.
He spoke to the daily acts of hate and torment
that many children and adults are subjected
to - something Chris himself experienced
during his public battle with a former Michi-
gan assistant attorney general.
Chris concluded by reminding the audience
of their inherent privilege as students at the
University: our ability to attend TEDxUofM, to
hear these stories and to gain this knowledge.
He exposed us to our responsibility to continue
the conversations that started at TEDx and to
take action on what we have learned.
We wanted to collectivelythank the TEDx-
UofM organizers for including these stories
and messages in the program this year. It
truly was a bold step. You should feel proud
of the social progress you helped bring about.
Now we turn to you, TEDxUofM attendees
- those who watched live and those who will
watch the videos later - to turn your inspira-
tion into action.
As TEDxUofM showed us this year, social
justice isn't an isolated theme pertaining to a
few issues. Rather, it's a core value we all must
live by; the pursuit of equality is relevant and
integral across all paths.
Take a trip down I-94 and work with native
Detroiters. Take action to end homelessness.
Stand up to our biased media portrayals. Edu-
cate others on the institutional barriers to
post-prison re-integration. Be proactive to
end bullying.
We have untapped opportunities on this
campus. Let's use our privilege as University
students productively.
Yonah Lieberman, Abby Krumbein and
Emma Rosen are LSA seniors. Maris Harmon,
Ariel Kaplowitz, Nina Pressman and Marissa
Soloman are LSA sophomores. Chirapon
Wangwongwiroj is an Engineering senior.
Dustyn Wright is a Kinesiology senior.

don't think Franz Kafka
ever drank sweet tea or wore
a seersucker suit, but his
spirit haunts the
American South.
Maybe not the
entire thing,
but at least the
tiny swath of
land between
the McDonald's,
Wendy's and ANDREW
the Gas'n'Go

nowheretown,
Georgia. The late
author's twisted world of senseless
decisions and illogical consequenc-
es is alive and well in Dixie.
Thirteen hours into the long trek
south to the National Champion-
ship in Atlanta, and hunger had set
in. It was late, we'd already suffered
a three-hour detour and two near-
death experiences, and all we want-
ed was cheap food. Every moment
of temporary salvation turned into
disappointment, however, as each
24-hour "restaurant" had locked
its doors and thrown away the key.
Cashiers stood behind registers, but
wouldn't respond to our desperate
taps on the windows. Nothing made
sense. Somewhere, Kafka smiled.
Welcome to the road trip
from hell.
Let me rephrase that, actually.
Welcome to the second half of the
road trip. A harrowing seven-ish
hours where everything came
crashing down around us. To put it
in March Madness terms: Good had
been upset by evil, and evil's fans
had stormed the court. Good put
up respectable first-half numbers,
but was just outworked by a more
motivated team.
Road trips have changed now
that everyone and their dog has
an iPhone. Our parents, clad in

bell bottoms and covered in weird
facial hair, read maps and never
had to worry about them running
out of battery. Today, if you handed
an actual road map to the aver-
age college kid, they'd probably ask
you if it came in touch-screen. Our
Kafka-esque McDonalds catastro-
phe wouldn't have occurred just a
decade ago, since only .5 percent
of them operated 24 hours a day in
2002 nationally. That number now
stands at about 40 percent.
Is the "new" road trip more valu-
able than the "old," though? I'm not
really sure. I asked the people in my
car, but they were too busy on Face-
book to answer me, so I guess I'll
think for myself.
I don't think the essence of a road
trip has changed substantially, and
I doubt it ever will. Some of the
tools may have changed such as sat-
ellite radio and GPS, but many have
not - the car, the highway and the
realization that Ohio actually sucks
as much as they say. Road trips
don't exude glitz and glamour, but
rather a romanticism for the open
road and the freedom that comes
with it.
Finishing a road trip is a victory.
The vanquished foe can be some-
thing powerful, like the elements
or something a little less legendary,
like a wrongturn, but reaching your
destination carries with it a unique
sensation. It's a mixture of satisfac-
tion and relief and though it may
sound kitschy, it can be a bonding
experience.
My road trip from hell contained
aspects from both the good and the
bad, but more than anything else,
it was an adventure. A semi-truck
nearly demolished us, but after
the initial scare, we laughed since
we were still breathing. We took
a three-hour detour through the
Bible-Belt version of Las Vegas -

Dolly Parton has a theme park there
- and drove for 30 minutes through
an unlit, backcountry neighbor-
hood in the Smoky Mountains. We
even ran into a 50-strong biker gang
in Kentucky that wasn't particular-
ly keen on sharing the road.
From Ann Arbor to
ATL: Welcome to the
road trip from hell.
For seven hours straight, it was
blunder after blunder, but when we
arrived in Atlanta, I think I under-
stood, on a much smaller scale,
what Odysseus felt. While we'd
only been blown off course for a
few hours, and not a few decades,
seeing Atlanta's skyline reminded
me of a homecoming of sorts. Even
though I had hopped in the car with
no tickets, no place to stay and no
idea who two of the people in the
car were, everything ended up
working out. Within five minutes
of entering Atlanta, my tickets and
my lodging were confirmed, and I
found 10 of my friends.
Kafka-esque usually carries a
negative context about a world
where nothing makes sense. For a
few hours, I agreed. I was having
a miserable time, and I just wanted
to get out of the damn car. In ret-
rospect though, everything that
happened was just part of the expe-
rience. While I absolutely would
prefer not to lose three hours of my
day again, I don't think I'd trade
the experience - unless you've got
floor seats for the game.

formance, gearing more toward
the radio-ready style of Brand
New Eyes. On "Ain't It Fun,"
for instance, new percussive
bell styles add a hint of playful
flavor, similar to the additional
synth-subtleties of the record's
other tracks.
A less-subtle new detail of
Paramore is the breakdown of
the record's format - divided
into three parts by the "Mov-
ing On" and "Holiday" inter-
ludes. This is where production
changes step potentially too far
outside of their boundaries, tak-
ing on the musical portrait of a
Hawaiian adventure by swap-
ping out Paramore's rock guitar
with a ukulele. It's easy to see
where this "Holiday" is taking
place.

The record's styles have a
relatively short attention span,
typically lasting for two or
three songs, but isn't so dras-
tic that the music would be
labeled "an atypical sound" of
Haley and her crew. The nearly
perfect blend of coherency and
experimentation is the vac-
cine to protect against a case of
fourth-studio-album boredom.
Williams stated that the pref-
erence for a self-titled album
stemmed from an urge to rein-
troduce the band to the world -
a wise decision, given the doubts
built on the recent melodrama.
Paramore listeners will appre-
ciate the reintroduction and
understand the group's musical
roots are still there, even if its
original founders aren't.

n old friend hides his
stash in the top drawer
of his bedroom dresser.
It's a plastic bag, bloated
between balled socks and spare
change. I've
never seen
anything
like it.
"What?"
he asks, jug-
gling the bag
between his
hands. BRIANNE
I shrug JOHNSON
and shake my
head with a
smile. "Nothing," I say, "It's just
weird, I guess."
He peels the bag open, dumps
its contents out onto the dress-
er. "I've got about four years'
worth right here. And I remem-
ber every single one - who I
went with, when we went.
"Oh, c'mon. You're telling
me that you don't collect ticket
stubs?"
Huh. I guess not.
You could call me a collec-
tor: I've got binders of Pok6-
mon cards, stacks of Britney
Spears albums and a short list
of famous and fictional hus-
bands. But movie ticket stubs?
You watch, endure or snooze
through a film - then it's over.
What's the point of saving
scraps of trash for "sentimental
value"? That's not a collection;
it's a symptom of hoarding ... or
so I thought.
I'd never heard a film spoken
about in the way that music lov-
ers fawn over the classics or in
the way that self-proclaimed
book nerds leak enthusiasm
and simultaneous dread every
time a chapter reaches its end.
Film has never fit itself into my
nostalgic conversations - not
in the way that Islay back in
the passenger seat of my best
friend's car and marvel at the
waya song sucks us back into
certain moments with certain
people in certain places.
We don't discuss films like
familiar scents from childhood,
not like how a waft of lemon
Pledge is my band-camp cabin
or how a spritz of Victoria's
Secret "Love Spell" is middle-
school locker rooms. I'd never
thought film captured what
songs could latch onto, not like
how All Time Low's "Remem-
bering Sunday" is post-gradu-
ation bonfires ringed by boys
with guitars and "Skinny Love"
is mornings-to-afternoons bur-
ied in bedsheets.
So, as fond asI am of the
Olsen twins' "Passport to
Paris," it just doesn't "take me
back" - in fact, it doesn't take
me anywhere (and certainly not
to Paris). A trip to the theater
was just that: a trip to the the-
ater. Nothing more, nothing less
(unless I conceded and sprung

for another pack of Sour Patch
Kids. Then it cost a little more).
As the pile of ticket stubs
spilled across the dresser, I
channeled my inner Patron
of the Arts. Plot twist: She is
unsurprisingly clich . Filmjust
doesn't ... speak to me, I thought.
Or maybe we were simply
speaking two different languag-
es. Had I grown deaf? I wanted
my deep emotional resonance,
and I wanted it now!
It turns out that I just wasn't
looking - or listening - hard
enough.
Film fooled me. It presented
itself as an isolated experience
with no more residual sig-
nificance than the buzz of back-
ground noise while music, on the
other ear, offered the definitive
soundtrack to my teenage years
and rites of passage. I thought
film was nothing special, and
certainly nothing to document
and collect in my drawers. But
after some diggingthrough my
DVD collection and my memory,
my socks and the lacy like, I
realized that - oh, how the
words pain me - I was wrong.
To this day, I refuse to watch
"The Year Without a Santa
Claus" since the night when,
as the Heat Miser spit fire, my
8-year-old self spewed less-
exciting substances all over the
living-room couch. Cringe.
Collecting
ticket stubs and
memories.
""The Temptations" will for-
ever remind (or haunt, to be
more accurate) me of my middle-
school band room where, at least
once a month, Mrs. Scott would
pull the window blinds tight and
"tsk" at every saxophone player
who'd made his music stand a
headrest.
And "Eternal Sunshine of the
Spotless Mind" is branded onto
my psyche as that bittersweet
movie that stimulates both my
tear ducts and my gag reflex
(for very different reasons than
"Claus"). These aren'tejust mov-
ies anymore. They're a part of my
identity.
I'm still a collector: Boxes of
Seventeen Magazine have lined
my family's garage shelves since
2005 (they'll be useful one day!).
And, now, faded ticket stubs dot
the bulletin board above my desk,
pinned and jammed and stuck by
magnets. Call me a hoarder (of
memories!), but hey, maybe some
things are worth saving.

crescendoing into a full sound
reminiscent of M83's own "Outro"
on Hurry Up. Songs such as "Can-
yon Battle" and "Losing Control"
seem perfectly crafted for a block-
buster film, meticulously com-
posed with swelling orchestration
that incites anxiety and anticipa-
tion.
The shining star, and most
recognizable M83 moment on
the soundtrack, is the title track,
"Oblivion," which will presum-
ably play as the credits roll, and
everyone quickly shuffles out of
the theatre unaware of the incred-

shows off her strong vocals while

the orchestration builds and Gon-

get to have their moment. The
song conglomerates all the ele-

to the soundtrack and perhaps the
entire film.
The work done on the "Obliv-

M83 is more than just another
French electronic act and estab-
lishes Gonzalez as a versatile and
accomplished artist. While it's too
soon to say whether the film itself
will be a success, if M83's contri-
bution is any indication, it will
do just fine.

'The Animals and
Children' to take on
noir aesthetic
By GRACE PROSNIEWSKI
Daily Arts Writer
Art is an amazing thing. It
can whisk an audience away to
an entirely different place and
time. It can

eting charac- Animals and
ters completely Children
unique to the T

times, not so Performance
much. 1927, a Network
London-based
performance $45
company, takes
the audience
through a grim and humor-
ous realm in "The Animals and
Children Took to the Streets,"
a production with a narrative
marked by suspicion and decep-
tion.

1927 was co-founded in
2005 by Suzanne Andrade and
Paul Barritt. The company's
journey to Ann Arbor started
a few years ago, when they
impressed a University Musi-
cal Society employee. Mary
Roeder, associate manager of
community engagement within
the education and community
engagement department of
UMS, saw the production at the
Fringe Festival in Edinburgh
and petitioned to bring it to Ann
Arbor.
"The Animals and Children
Took to the Streets" takes place
in a part of the city known as
the Bayou, where a large dilapi-
dated tenement block known
as the Bayou Mansions houses
a host of unseemly characters.
One night, the optimistic Agnes
Eaves and her daughter come
to stay, much to the curiosity of
the other tenets.
"As a whole, it's one the best
conceived and most fun pieces
of theater I've ever seen," Roed-
er said. "It is, as I said, a graphic
novel come to life. You feel a
little bit like you're trapped in
a cartoon when you're watching
it. It's a combination of anima-
tion, video and a live cast inter-
acting with that video."
The animation and video play
an important role in conveying
the darkly comic setting of the
work. And for those who feel

that electronics distract from
the performance, fear not.
"It's done so seamlessly
that you sort of forget they're
actually live actors. You think
they're a part of this film you're
watching," Roeder said.
All creative members of 1927
come from different artistic
backgrounds and are known
for their unique combination
of artistic mediums, employ-
ing a diverse array of both pre-
recorded and live material.
"That's really their aesthet-
ic," Roeder said, "combining
performance with animation.
It's something that you'll see in
all of their work."
The styling of the actors and
the setting is a nod to the early
days of film and lends the pro-
duction a noir feel.
"They're really inspired
by silent film and cabaret, so
there's a sort of nostalgia to it,"
Roeder said.
"The Animals and Children
Took to the Streets" is sure to
intrigue theater lovers, film
buffs and casual audience mem-
bers alike.
"I honestly say that it's one of
the best things I've ever seen,"
Roeder said. "It's going to be 70
minutes of the most fun some-
body could have in the theater.
You completely lose yourself
in this world that they've cre-
ated."

grown, Blake has matured as
a singer and composer, sprin-
kling shades of Joni, hip hop and
R&B over his most sophisticated
production yet. The album's
title track opens the record
by immersing the listener in a
gloomy atmosphere of plinking
keyboards before Blake appears,
showcasing his potent lyrical
and vocal abilities with the line,
"I don't want to be a star, but a
stone on the shore / Long door,
frame the wall, when every-
thing's overgrown."
Kanye and Jay
are big fans, so
you should
be, too.
* With the the exception of the
song "Voyeur," the glitchy vocal
loops of Blake's 2010 self-titled
debut are mostly absent on Over-
grown, replaced by (relatively)
traditional song structures and
the ascendance of Blake's un-
manipulated vocals. "Voyeur"
begins with a looping of Blake's
bleak melody and slowly inflates
into a trance-like dance anthem
for The xx generation.
"DLM" and the closer, "Our
Love Comes Back," combine
the heartbreaking vocal into-
nations of Blake's Joni Mitch-
ell cover with subtle electronic
production. Both songs presum-
ably yearn for the return of a
former lover and represent the
pensive, cathartic form that
Blake has slowly mastered over
the years.
Overgrown's two featured
performances provide further
diversity on an already genre-
bending album. Blake takes the
backseat, for instance, on "Take
a Fall For Me," a sullen track
which finds rapper RZA rumi-
nating on marriage and lost love
for 48 bars over some eerily Wu-
Tang-esque production. Simi-
larly, on the track "Digital Lion,"
Blake recedes and allows the
ambient synths of guest Brian
Eno to carry the heft of the mes-
merizing song.
The album's lead single "Ret-
rograde" is a stunning bal-
lad that enters delicately with
minimalist production - a
repeating hand clap and some
somber humming from Blake -
and builds to a remarkable clash
of synths with the song's chorus.
At this point in his career, "Ret-
rograde" is Blake's masterpiece
- the culmination of his various
talents packaged within a futur-
istic pop hit.
In his four-year career, James
Blake has blurred the lines of
electronic and R&B music and
picked up some notable fans in
the process (Kanye West, Jay-Z
and Stevie Wonder, to name a
few). Though Overgrown is like-
ly too dark and sonically per-
plexing to become a Billboard
hit, the album certainly estab-
lishes Blake as a groundbreaker
- the leader and sole inhabit-
ant of an "overgrown" genre, a
shadowy pop revolution that's
matured too far ahead of its

time.

But if the Cardinals missed
on any of their offensive posses-

Behanan had 11 rebounds,
seven offensive, and 11 points
in the second half to help Lou-

rebounded the Wolverines,
20-10, and had 22 points in

alone. For the game, Louisville
had a 32-27 advantage on the
boards and won the offensive
rebounding battle, 15-8. Foul
trouble didn't help the Wolver-
ines, either. McGary picked up
his fourth foul halfway through
the second half, which he said
made him play a bit tentatively
against Louisville's big men in
the paint.
"They're relentless down
there," said Michigan redshirt
junior Jordan Morgan. "They
had two or three guys going
after the ball, they're going
after it even after you get the
rebound. They were able to get
some put-backs, and that helped
them take control of the game."

ATLANTA -
W ith six minutes left
in Michigan's 82-76
loss to Louisville in
the Nation-
al Cham-
pionship,
Trey Burke
launched
himself off
the ground
and toward
the back- EVERETT
board,
stretching COOK
his arm as far
up as it could
possibly go, trying to stop the
trajectory of Louisville guard
Peyton Siva.
It was a breakaway play in
transition, one-on-one, point
guard against point guard. Siva
rose up with his right hand, cra-
dling the ball, trying to slam it up
and over Burke.
Any other point guard either
lets Siva go or goes to strip the
ball in the air. Burke went to
block it.
Ninety seconds prior, the
sophomore point guard had been
lying facedown on the court, try-
ing to recover after being fouled
hard on a drive. He had been
beaten up all game by the physi-
cal Cardinal defense, and it was
starting to take its toll.
Burke got up and walked to the
free-throw line, head down. Jor-
dan Morgan caught him before
he got to the stripe, telling Burke
to lift his head. Morgan knew his
point guard was hurting. The
redshirt junior center told him,
"Just keep fighting. Just six more
minutes."
Burke nodded, but missed the
first free throw. He muttered
somethingunder his breath, took
a breath, stepped forward and
made the second one. He was in
pain.
But in the open court against
Siva, the 6-foot Burke got up
higher than he had all season.
Half of his forearm was above
the rim, .where his hand met
nothing but the ball.
It was a clean rejection, a per-
fect defensive play and a perfect
snapshot of two leaders leaving

everything on the line.
Then, a whistle. Burke was
called for the foul, and Siva made
both his free throws.
After the game, 11 players
and coaches were asked if the
play was clean. All 11 said it was,
but all said it ultimately didn't
affect the outcome. There were
so many other plays that swung
the game.
All 11 praised the point guard
for being able to even get there.
"If there's one person who
can't hang his head, it's Trey,"
said freshman guard Nik Staus-
kas. "He's carried us all year
long."
There's a story that Michigan
assistant coach LaVall Jordan
likes to tell about Burke.
Inthe first opengym of Burke's
Michigan career in the sum-
mer of 2011, Jordan approached
Burke and asked him, "You like
winning, don't you?" Burke, then
19, responded, "Coach, I win.
That's what I do."
Jordan knew that Burke had
won the Ohio State Champion-
ship as a sophomore in high
school, so he laughed and nod-
ded, trying to humor his young
point guard.
Dead serious, without a glint
of humor, Burke looked up at
Jordan, shook his head and said,
"Coach, I win. That's what I do."
That's not the interesting
part. The interesting part is
that Jordan believed Burke, the
soon to be freshman who hadn't
yet played in a collegiate game.
Jordan could see the drive that
earned Michigan a Big Ten title
last year and brought it six points
away from a national champion-
ship this year.
After two years, Ann Arbor
has seen it, probably for the last
time Monday. He almost left last
year, but on April 9,2012, he said,
"I felt like it was the best deci-
sion for me to stay my sophomore
year and compete for a national
championship next year."
After sweeping the four major
National Player of the Year
awards and getting the Wolver-
ines to Atlanta, Burke accom-
plished what he wanted to.
For him, there's nothing left

to accomplish at Michigan. It's
almost a foregone conclusion he
will play in the NBA next year.
But on Monday, he was still a
Wolverine, and he was still the
best player in the country, still
the player capable of making
shots 30 feet from the basket.
Every time it felt like the game
was slipping away, there was
Burke, willing Michigan back
into it.
He finished the contest with a
game-high 24 points while'miss-
ing just four shots and tallied six
of i.iLigan's last 10 points. He
couldn't, wouldn't let his team
let it slip away.
"He's a superhero. A mytho-
logical figure," said senior cap-
tain Josh Bartelstein. "I've never
enjoyed playing with anybody so
much. He's the best basketball
player I've ever played with, and
I've played with some good play-
ers. That kid is going to have an
unbelievable career in the NBA."
It's not a one-man game,
though. With 40 seconds left,
Burke knew Michigan needed to
foul, but also knewhe had four of
his own.
Manically, he tried waving
freshman guard Caris LeVert -
or anyone he could find - over to
commit the infraction. Nobody
else understood, and time kept
ticking away. Burke's last two
shot attempts fell short.
At 1:42 a.m., a pocket of con-
fetti fell from the rafters, the last
of the celebration. The court was
already being disassembled, the
nets already cut down. The game,
season and career was over.
Trey Burke wins. That's what
he does. On Monday, there was
nothing more he could have done
- he had nothing more to give.
With the seconds ticking
down, Siva walked over to Burke
and gave him a hug, a nod of
respect. He saw what Jordan
saw, back before Burke came
onto the national scene.
Siva knew that there was
no point guard in the country
that could have made that play,
because there was no point guard
in the country like Trey Burke.
