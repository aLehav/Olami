‘U’ hosts 
bootcamp 
to support 
new NGOs

Weiser Center, 

William Davidson 
Institute partner for 
development abroad

By CAMY METWALLY

Daily Staff Reporter

For four days this week, 

thousands of miles away, the 
University took the international 
stage in Slovakia.

The 
Weiser 
Center 
for 

Emerging Democracies and the 
William Davidson Institute at the 
University partnered together to 
sponsor a bootcamp in Bratislava, 
Slovakia, on leadership for non-
governmental 
organizations. 

From Oct. 20 to Oct. 23, the 
program welcomed participants 
from 20 NGOs in countries 
transitioning to democracy.

Rachel Brichta, Weiser Center 

communications specialist, said 
the partnership demonstrated 
how units across campus can 
have interdisciplinary missions.

“Both of our missions have 

strengthening democracy and 
civil society at our core, and so 
the fact that we’re able to work 
together and then find a partner 
overseas to do this together 
really shows that Michigan has 
so much to offer and these kinds 
of partnerships can really make 
an impact in the world,” Brichta 
said.

The Pontis Foundation, an 

NGO 
in 
Slovakia, 
provided 

instructors to train participants 
with the goal of improving 
the managerial capacity of the 
organizations. 
Activities 
and 

workshops targeted five different 
areas: 
advocacy 
and 
public 

policy 
building, 
management, 

marketing strategies, planning 
and 
sustainability, 
and 

communication and negotiation.

“Many NGOs have a clear idea 

of what they want to achieve, but 
sometimes it’s far more difficult 
to figure out how to achieve,”

Prof. 
Anna 

Grzymala-Busse, Weiser Center 
program director, wrote in an

Governor joins IT 
experts for annual 

conference on 

internet protection

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

Gov. Rick Snyder, the self-

proclaimed “one tough nerd,” 
came to the University on 

Thursday to speak on a topic 
he says nerds know best: cyber 
security.

“First of all, I am proud to 

say I am a nerd,” Snyder said. 
“One subset of that is being a 
techie. Technology is something 
that’s critically important, that’s 
transforming our lives, and it’s 
not going to go back, it’s only 
going to continue to advance.”

Snyder spoke at the 11th 

annual Security at the University 
of Michigan IT conference at the 

University, hosted by University 
Information 
and 
Technology 

Services. 
The 
conference 

focused on cyber security this 
year in honor of October’s status 
as 
National 
Cyber 
Security 

Awareness Month.

“For everything we do to say 

we’re 
advancing 
information 

technology taking it to the 
next level, I think it’s equally 
important 
that 
there’s 
a 

corresponding 
effort 
to 

encourage better cyber security,” 

Snyder said.

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel 
introduced 
Snyder, 

and recognized the governor’s 
high value on educatoin. Snyder 
recieved his B.A., MBA and J.D. 
from the University as well as a 
honorary degree. 

“He’s persistent. It doesn’t 

matter what the climate is, he’s 
going to work to achieve goals 
he has for the citizens of this 
state and I’ve learned from

Parkinson’s disease at the Udall Center for Parkinson’s Disease Research Symposium in Kahn Auditorium on Thursday.

Conference speakers 

pitch alternative 

approaches to study 

the disease 

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

The 
University 
hosted 

its first Parkinson’s disease 
research symposium Thursday, 
which focused on creative 
ways to approach the disease’s 
treatment.

William 
Dauer, 
director 

of 
the 
Morris 
K. 
Udall 

Centers 
of 
Excellence 
for 

Parkinson’s Disease Research, 
a collaboration between several 
universities, said the center 
aims to study topics outside 
of 
mainstream 
Parkinson’s 

research.

“The key theme is to look 

beyond the traditional focus 
to other aspects of the disease, 
to other chemical transmitters 
that are affected to try to better 
understand how those play a 
role is the disease,” he said.

Etienne Hirsch, director at 

the Institute for Neurosciences 
at the French Alliance for Life 
and Health Science, delivered 
the 
conference’s 
keynote 

address 
in 
the 
Biomedical 

Science Research Building’s 
Kahn Auditorium.

Hirsch’s talk focused on 

the ways in which brain cell 
deterioration causes symptoms 
associated with Parkinson’s, 
touching on his own research. 
He emphasized the role of glial 
cells, inflammatory cytokines 
and apoptosis, the automatic 
response 
within 
cells 
to 

destruct when they sustain 
a certain level of damage. 

Glial 
cells 
help 
maintain 

homeostasis, or stability, in the 
brain. Inflammatory cytokines 
are proteins that signal cells to 
cause inflammation.

He said while those three 

elements are not always viewed 
as pivotal to understanding the 
disease, he hoped to convince 
the audience that looking at 
Parkinson’s disease in this way 
would provide a new way to 
think about treatment.

In 
talking 
about 
his 

experiments, Hirsch said he 
found that a certain heat shock 
protein, HSP60, was responsible 
for increasing the amount of 
cellular 
degeneration. 
Heat 

shock proteins are a type 
of protein within the body 
that are produced when a 
cell 
experiences 
stressful 

conditions.

this 
experiment,

MDP chair

Brandon 

Dillon stresses 
importance of 

youth involvement

By BRIAN KUANG

Daily Staff Reporter

Despite the keynote speaker 

delivering his address through 
Skype instead of in person and 
the presence of a tracker for the 
Republican Party, the College 
Democrats heard from the head 
of Michigan’s Democratic Party 
on Thursday about how young 
people can become involved in 
politics.

MDP 
Chair 
Brandon 

Dillon, who was elected in 
July after former chair Lon 
Johnson stepped down to run 
for Congress, was originally 
scheduled 
to 
speak 
in 
the 

Michigan Union. An upcoming 
event with presidential candidate 
Martin O’Malley, the former 
governor of Maryland, conflicted 
with the plans and led him to 
Skype in to the event instead.

O’Malley is slated to appear 

in Dearborn, Mich. on Friday as 
part of a conference hosted by the 
Arab American Institute. During 
the appearance, he will discuss 
policy issues affecting Arab 
Americans and how they can be a 
part of the discussion during the 
2016 campaign season.

“(Even with the schedule 

conflict), Dillon still wanted to 
support students and reach out to 
us,” said Public Policy senior Max

Japanese 

dramatists bring 

avant-garde 

theater to the ‘U’

Editor’s Note: All quotes 

from the interview with Ushio 
Amagatsu were translated from 
English 
to 

Japanese 
and 
from 

Japanese 
back

by 
Midori 

Okuyama 
and Yasuko 
Takai.

Butoh 

looms 
large in the 
story of the 
post-war 
avant-garde 
arts 
in 

Japan. The 
brainchild of Hijikata Tatsumi 
and Ohno Kazuo, Butoh is an 
experimental 
movement 
in 

dance that established a novel 
visual and physical vocabulary 
in dance. Slow, controlled 
movement and striking, often 
unnerving 
costume 
define 

this genre that strives “to find, 
in the depth of each human 
being, a common sense, a 
serene universality, even if, 
sometimes, it refers to cruelty 
or brutality.”

For those first-generation 

innovators in Butoh, violent 
and unsettling images were 
the order of the day. But for 
Ushio Amagatsu, the director 
and founder of Sankai Juku, 
the 
world-renowned 
Butoh 

troupe founded in 1975 and 
based out of Paris, doesn’t 
draw 
its 
inspiration 
from 

violence in the pursuit of this 
universality.

“I was born by the sea,” 

Amagatsu said in an interview 
via email. “Boundary between 
land and sea, a changing color 
from dawn to a blue sky, on the 
contrary, from red sunset to 
blue that is further darkened 
deeper, and the repetition 
of them that we may call as 
‘eternity’ ... These impressions 
still dwell upon my mind.”

Where Amagatsu departs 

from 
the 
violence 
and 

grotesquerie 
of 
the 
first-

generation of Butoh dancers, he 
emphasizes the imperceptible, 
the 
uncanny, 
the 
eternal. 

Particularly so in Sankai Juku’s 
upcoming performance in Ann 
Arbor: UMUSUNA: Memories 
Before History.

“Umusuna is a Japanese 

word that means a place of one’s 
birth. When I apply this word to 
the whole of human being, the 
earth itself becomes Umusuna,” 
Amagatsu said. “I believe that 
the relationship between the 
place of birth and people is 
always deeply affected by a 
certain natural element, and 
I don’t think this relationship 
changes at present, and in 
the future as well, as it didn’t 
change in the past.”

UMMA embraces ‘Throwback 

Thursday’ with ’90s programming

“Late Night” 

exhibit showcases 

art from 1990s

BY ANNA HARITOS

Daily Staff Reporter

The 1990s came back to life in 

an exhibit featured at the Uni-
versity of Michigan Museum 
of Art’s seventh annual “Late 
Night” event Thursday, hosted 
by the UMMA Student Program-
ming and Advisory Council.

This year’s iteration of Late 

Night — where the art museum 
stays open until 11 p.m. instead 
of its usual 5 p.m. closing time 
— asked that students in atten-
dance don traditionally ’90s garb 
as part of the night’s activities.

Throughout 
the 
evening, 

students ventured throughout 
the art museum, where they 
partook in a scavenger hunt, 
photo booths, stamp making 
and ’90s-themed trivia games. 
WCBN 88.3 FM, the University’s 
student-run radio station, piped 
in ’90s tunes for the duration of 
the event.

LSA senior Jean Rafaelian, 

one of the event coordinators, 
said one of the benefits of Late 
Night is that it works to “draw in 
people that might not normally 

come into this space.”

“Sometimes 
artwork 
feels 

elitist to people, and that it’s not 
easy for them to understand it, 
which I get because I’ve had to 
take classes to understand a lot 
of things,” Rafaelian said. “But 
that doesn’t mean that it’s not a 
cool place to come do homework, 
enjoy free programming, grab a 
coffee and soak up the art.”

Upstairs in the A. Alfred Taub-

man Gallery, an exhibit called 
“Come As You Are: Art of the 
1990s” was the main attraction 
of the evening. According to the 
UMMA website, the collection 
is considered to be the museum’s 
first to examine art of the 1990s 
in its historical context.

“The exhibition ... focuses on 

three principal themes — debates 
over ‘identity politics,’ the digi-
tal revolution and globalization 
— and explores a range of geo-
political milestones and social 
issues through the perspective 
of artists working at that time,” a 
description on the website reads.

The exhibit contains more 

than 64 pieces by 46 artists, and 
draws its name from the 1992 
Nirvana song of the same title. 
Some say “Come As You Are” 
was the anthem of the ’90s. The 
featured artwork includes every-
thing from classic oil paintings to 
glass jars with preserved crabs.

Art & Design freshman Kara 

Calvert said she was impressed 
by some of the pieces’ symbolism 
and the materials to create them.

“One of my favorite things 

about a new exhibit is that you’ll 
never know what you’re going 
to see,” Calvert said. “I really 
like ‘Lick and Lather’ pieces, by 
Janine Antoni. They’re really 
cool; this artist created two casts 
of her face — one of them was out 
of chocolate and the other out of 
soap, and to finish the piece she 
licked the chocolate and took a 
bath with the other one.”

The event also featured pieces 

by famous photographers from 
the 1990s. LSA senior Robyn 
Green said some of the photos 
had appeared in courses she has 
taken, which made both the art 
and her classwork more relevant.

“Two of these were featured 

in my two separate courses,” 
Green said. “That gives me a 
broader context of the art and 
what it means to have the art fea-
tured in a space — which, in an 
odd way, gives it more agency to 
me.”

Green also said she appreci-

ates UMMA’s efforts to offer late 
night programming.

“I think what they’re doing is 

great because I wouldn’t neces-
sarily have time in my day to see 
this exhibit,” she said.

Celebrating the eighth birthday 
of Radiohead’s ‘In Rainbows’

Remembering 
Radiohead’s 

seminal seventh 

studio album

BY RACHEL KERR

Daily Arts Writer

Last week, Radiohead’s In Rain-

bows celebrated its eighth birth-
day, and while most of you were 
getting drunk at a tailgate, I sat 
serenely in my room playing the 
album on repeat.

Just kidding, I was drunk, too, 

but I did listen to it later that night 
while nursing my hangover. And 
while eight years may seem like an 
insignificant milestone, this album 
changed things — how artists 
released music, how listeners pur-
chased music, and how affected I 
could be by music.

So, I’m about to tell you some-

thing really embarrassing. And 

let me preface it by saying I used 
to be a huge asshole. Like, I’m 
still an asshole, but I’m no longer 
an Explosions in the Sky is better 
than Godspeed You! Black Emper-
or asshole. So, when I was that 
ripe age of 16, I went to Coachella 
for the first time. It was the year 
a naked woman danced on me at 
an A$AP Rocky show, and it was 
the year I saw someone smoke 
crack for the first time — at a Mod-
est Mouse set, no less. It was the 
year of Snoop D. O. Double G and 
Dr. Dre, but more importantly, of 
Radiohead.

However, it was not the year 

I saw Radiohead perform. You 
wanna know why? Because I 
sat through Noah Gallagher, the 
Shins and Bon Iver only to get 
into an argument with someone in 
the crowd as Thom Yorke started 
singing. After proclaiming, “Fuck 
Radiohead fans!” I weaseled my 
way out of the sea of people and 
bought pepperoni pizza instead. 
Who the fuck did I think I was?

I have since come to my senses 

and, after extensive listening, can 
confidently conclude that I prefer 
OK Computer to Kid A – because it 
really does say a lot about a person 
– and yet still can’t articulate what 
exactly made In Rainbows the most 
affecting Radiohead album to date.

Maybe because it was, for the 

first time, equally as innovative 
as it was accessible to the listener. 
With their previous projects, I 
quite literally felt like I was trans-
lating code from a computer (see 
Kid A). But with In Rainbows, I 
didn’t have to think. I could just 
listen. The experience became 
purely visceral, a product of the 
haunting melodies and calming 
lyrics. It may not have been their 
most cohesive project, but that’s 
because every song stands strong-
ly on its own.

Maybe because Radiohead’s 

“pay-what-you-want” purchasing 
method completely changed the 
artist’s relationship with the label 
and the listener, as well as the digi-
tal downloading world forever. In 
October 2007, the band announced 
the release of the album without 
backing from a record label. Ten 
days later, it’s up on their website 
to download, for whatever price 
you wanted to pay. Remember, 
this was 2007. YouTube had just 
turned two, and the iTunes we 
knew and loved was just a shadow 
of itself. Streaming services didn’t 
exist yet. And here you have one 
of the most iconic rock bands of 
the 21st century giving away their 
music for free. In turn, the mon-
ster that is the modern day listener 
was created; the one who insists 
free music is not a privelege, but a 
right, and lives off of leaked album 
downloads. And this demand pro-
duced the methods for which we 
now listen to music: Spotify, Apple 
Music, Tidal, etc.

Or maybe just because that 

“Nude”-“Weird Fishes / Arpeggi”-
“All I Need” segment of the album 
is some of the most beautiful music 
I’ve ever heard. 

Whatever the reason, I thank 

you Radiohead. And happy belat-
ed, In Rainbows.

this,” Schlissel said. “Finally, I’ll always be 
impressed with how he gets away with going 
to public events without wearing a necktie.”

Though Snyder noted that the crowd of 

roughly 150 attendees probably shared his 
views on the necessity of increasing cyber 
security, he said it was a big issue in the state 
of Michigan and around the world.

“In the state of Michigan alone, we’ve 

seen a huge escalation in the number of 
times we’re attacked,” he said. “One, I think 
there are more attacks, but secondly I think 
we’re better at recognizing we’re attacked. I 
think in many cases we were probably being 
attacked and we didn’t even know it.”

Currently 
the 
state 
of 
Michigan’s 

government experiences about 2.5 million 
cyber attacks every day, according to Snyder. 
He said if a cyber attack occurs, people are at 
risk of losing both confidential information 
and their reputation. 

Citing his own personal experience with 

identity theft, he asked attendees to raise 
their hands if they, too, had been affected, 
with a majority of people in the crowd 
acknowledging they had.

“What do you do about (cyber threats)?” 

he said. “Well, you have to be proactive, and 
I’m proud to say at the state of Michigan I 
think we’re a leader in this country.”

He said Michigan has a competitive 

advantage 
compared 
to 
other 
regions 

because of the state’s public universities and 
colleges, as well as their ability to collaborate 
with one another.

“In terms of advantages, we’re sitting 

upon one of the greatest advantages in the 
world: the University of Michigan,” Snyder 
said. 

Along with Snyder’s remarks, several 

experts on cyber security spoke throughout 
the day, discussing issues faced by many 
institutions, such as universities.

During 
a 
panel 
discussion 
in 
the 

afternoon, Jen Miller-Osborn, cyber threat 
intelligence analyst for Palo Alto Networks, 
said the education sector is the third most 
victimized sector in the country for cyber 
attacks for both student data and research.

“From 
a 
nation-state 
perspective, 

universities are also a really big target,” 
Miller-Osborn said. “They target college 
students and professors, too, and it makes 
perfect sense: You’re working in a research 
institution.”

Miller-Osborn said previously in her 

career, she would receive e-mails with 
resumes and requests for internships that 
contained hidden viruses.

Randy Hegarty, enterprise security IT 

manager in Pennsylvania State University’s 
information security office, cited his own 
experience dealing with a network breach 
during the panel.

Last year, the FBI notified Penn State’s 

College of Engineering that information had 
been compromised since 2012.

“Earlier, 
someone 
called 
it 
an 

unprecedented threat with an unprecedented 
response,” Hegarty said. “Basically, that’s 
where our institution took this because it 
was a deep concern.”

Tom Winterhalter, supervisor of the 

FBI Detroit Division’s Cyber Squad, said 
universities and individuals can prevent 
threats by building up the security of their 
network through measures such as making 
complex passwords.

“So many students use very simple 

passwords,” Winterhalter said. “At one 
university, which I will not name, many 
people still had their passwords still set at 
‘123456.’ ”

In his speech, Snyder urged attendees 

to take action on the issue, citing as one 
example the Civilian Cyber Corps, a new 
organization composed of citizens willing 
to collaborate with one another if Michigan 
were to experience a broad attack. Snyder 
said he foresees the organization as a 
precursor to a long-term solution which he 
hopes will eventually be a specialty team 
within the National Guard.

“How do you deal with the issue after 

it’s already happened? How do you hit 
restore? How do you get back up? It’s an 
area (in which) I think we’re woefully 
inadequate,” Snyder said. “I don’t think most 
organizations are really fully prepared to 
respond if they have a huge attack happen to 
them. The smaller ones we can manage, but if 
we had a big one or we had one that affected 
sectors of our economy or something, we are 
not prepared for that one.”

training in accounting, government relations, publicity and writing 
grants — the nitty-gritty details that are often pretty prosaic but 
can make or break an NGO.”

The NGOs in attendance traveled from 12 different countries 

for the bootcamp. According to Grzymala-Busse, some are based 
in authoritarian societies, while others are in newly emergent 
democracies.

However, they all share similar challenges stemming from 

skeptical government officials and legal limitations.

Due to the harsh political climate in several of these countries, 

the names of specific participants and NGOs are not being released, 
only the attendees’ countries. Groups from Albania, Belarus, 
Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kyrgyzstan, Macedonia, Moldova, Russia, 
Serbia, Slovakia, Tunisia and Ukraine participated in the program.

Grzymala-Busse pointed to Russia, where NGOs cannot receive 

foreign aid, as an example of the structural challenges many of the 
organizations in attendance face.

“I hope this highlights the problems — and the potential — of 

NGOs, even when they have to work in a difficult environment,” 
Grzymala-Busse wrote.

Nathan Rauh-Bieri, program coordinator for the Education 

Initiative at the William Davidson Institute, said he thought the 
program demonstrates the University’s global presence.

Ronald Weiser, former U.S. ambassador to Slovakia and Weiser 

Center founder, helped fund the bootcamp and was also a guest 
speaker. Amy Gillett, vice president of the Education Initiative 
at the William Davidson Institute, and Marysia Ostafin, Weiser 
Center program manager, travelled to Slovakia to facilitate the 
event.

“I think that the housing of centers like the Weiser Center and 

the William Davidson Institute shows Michigan’s commitment to 
global engagement and also to excellence in pedagogy,” Rauh-Bieri 
said. “I think that’s what this program is really trying to deliver.”

we have shown that HSP60 isn’t used, it is released, and that 
HSP60 killed the neurons,” Hirsch said. “You see that when you 
apply AraC on the treatment of HSP60 you reduce the degree of 
normal degeneration.”

AraC refers to a protein known to block cancer by stopping 

cell division.

Hirsch also touched on experiments focused on mitigating 

problems with gait and balance, which is associated with 
Parkinson’s disease. 

Some research has held that the disorder might stem from the 

pedunculopontine nucleus or PPN, a part of the brain stem.

Hirsch said through research on monkeys, his team was able 

to conclude that a popular method of treatment, dopamine, may 
not always be effective if the gait and balance issues do in fact 
stem from the PPN. 

“What can we learn from the animal involvements of gait 

disorders?” he said. “PPN cholinergic lesion can cause dopamine 
resistant gait deficits.”

Neurology Assistant Prof. Vikas Kotagal, who presented a 

shorter talk later in the event, said the innovations Hirsch spoke 
of about were important in finding new ways to treat the disease.

“I think that the work that he’s presenting is very fundamental 

to the hypotheses that led to the creation of this out of the box 
idea for the Udall Center,” Kotagal said. “It relates to leading 
to clinically significant outcomes for patients with Parkinson’s 
disease.”

Hirsch’s keynote address was followed by seven other 

shorter presentations on Parkinson’s disease presented by 
other professionals working in the field, which Dauer said was 
another focus of the event.

“One of our goals is to support younger investigators and to 

help foster their careers in Parkinson’s, which is one of the key 
reasons we structured the symposium the way we did,” he said.

Sorkin studies myth of Apple’s Jobs

 By JAMIE BIRCOLL

Senior Arts Editor

I proudly admit that most of the technology 

I own was made by Apple. I can’t thank Steve 
Jobs and Apple enough for them: they’re elegant 
yet simple enough for my technologically 
challenged brain to comprehend. But these 
words “elegant” and “simple” do not apply 
to Steve Jobs himself, or, at least, that’s how 
we have come to remember him in the four 
years since his death. No doubt, Jobs defined a 
generation of tech for laymen and has proved a 
cultural icon — but is he a complex, sometimes 
self-hating conundrum, too intricate and 
secretive to deconstruct? Screenwriter Aaron 
Sorkin (“The Social Network”) and director 
Danny Boyle (“Trance”) seem to think so, as 
they attempt to separate the myth from the 
man in “Steve Jobs.”

Admittedly, this is not your typical biopic, 

and Sorkin deserves all of the credit in the 
world for breaking with such a contrived 
structure. Rather than simply watching a 
retelling of his life, we follow Jobs (Michael 
Fassbender, “X-Men: Days of Future Past”) 
and his coworkers and friends (or are they 
enemies?) at three different product launches 
in 1984, 1988 and 1998. Sorkin relies on dialogue 
and several flashbacks to fill in the details we 
missed between each showcase. This plays to 
his strength, as he fills the scenes with rich 
dialogue with a classic Sorkinian bite.

But what we gain in distinctive story 

structure, we lose in direct narrative 
continuity. One can view “Steve Jobs” almost 
as three separate, 40-minute short films. 
We don’t really need anything that comes 
before or after each segment because they are 
completely self-contained, and any otherwise 
missing information is filled in through a 
flashback. And before each segment begins, 
we get a montage of news stories that catch us 
up on the inter-launch years and set the stage 
for what’s to come. Technically speaking, it all 
works, but the separated segments keep us at 
a distance. We cannot see Jobs himself grow 
and his relationships evolve; instead, we are 
forced to simply accept that something has 
changed, “Oh he’s nice to his daughter now. 
That’s cool.”

This distance may be Sorkin and Boyle’s 

attempt to reflect Jobs’s mind within the 
narrative structure itself. The story makes 

very clear that Jobs is locked into each event, 
his mind zoned in on one objective: success. 
And anything that hampers that success must 
be expunged. Boyle and Sorkin provide us with 
glimpses into his mind — images and videos 
often appear on walls, and brief cuts back to 
previous segments are roughly inserted to 
reflect his emotional conflict — as further 
endorsement of this idea. But, then again, 
Sorkin’s ego may have just kicked in and he 
decided to be different for the sake of difference 
(you know, because he’s Aaron Sorkin).

(As the camera follows Jobs around the 

various theaters, I couldn’t help but recall the 
long tracking shots of “Birdman;” both films 
share a theme of closed, contained spaces as 
reflections of the psyche.) 

But the Sorkin-Boyle dynamic ultimately 

proves somewhat disappointing — they’re just 
too mismatched. “The Social Network” works 
so well because Sorkin’s cold, disconnected 
character could be reflected in David Fincher’s 
cold, calculated direction. Boyle, by contrast, 
uses the camera in a more embracive fashion, 
and he is always sympathetic to his characters, 
even when his characters are complete scum 
(see “Trainspotting”).

Boyle is forced to look at Jobs in two lights: 

one as the misanthropic boss and one as the 
father and friend learning to be a decent human 
being. And the contrast between the two from 
a filmmaking standpoint is quite stark.

Let me explain. There’s a scene early on 

where Jobs confronts Andy Hertzfeld (Michael 
Stuhlberg, “Pawn Sacrifice”), an original 
Macintosh developer, in front of several other 
Apple employees for failing to properly set up 
the demo computer. The camera circles around 
the two characters, and we see the fear on the 
other employees’ faces and sense the dread 
instilled by Jobs. We understand that this 
environment is, quite simply, toxic all the way 
around. The film shines in moments like these. 
But in scenes where Joanna Hoffman (Kate 
Winslet, “Insurgent”), another member of the 
original Macintosh team, tries to lecture Jobs 
about being a more sympathetic individual, the 
camera does a standard close-up shot counter-
shot; it’s just not nearly as much fun nor as 
telling and impactful as the scene could be.

But 
where 
the 
structure 
fails, 
the 

performances 
elevate. 
Fassbender 
will 

undoubtedly receive an Oscar nomination 
for his work here. He immerses himself in 
the character and balances the forcefulness 

of the character with subtlety, but no less 
drive, in his quieter, more earnest scenes. 
And Jeff Daniels (HBO’s “The Newsroom”) as 
former Apple CEO John Sculley demonstrates 
incredible charisma, representing a formidable 
opponent to Fassbender. The climactic, tense 
confrontation between the two after Jobs’ 
dismissal from Apple proves electrifying, the 
film’s finest moment.

Seth Rogen (“The Interview”) as Steve 

Wozniak displays considerable range and 
heart. We get the sense that the Jobs-Wozniak 
relationship seems the most at risk to Jobs’s 
toxicity. It’s clear the two have some kind of 
respect for each other, or maybe an almost 
fraternal obligation to each other, and at 
times they seem to truly care. But the two are 
so diametrically opposed in their desires — 
Jobs demands control over Wozniak and his 
ingenuity, where Wozniak yearns for some 
kind of recognition for his success and role in 
transforming computing, if not from the public 
then at least from Jobs — that their dynamic 
will eventually crumble beneath them. It’s 
a deeply interesting relationship, one that 
deserves a bit more exploration than the film 
devotes to it.

So is “Steve Jobs” a success? Yes and no. The 

film is rooted in dialogue rather than images, so 
those who prefer to see rather than hear will be 
disappointed. However, the dialogue is, on the 
whole, absorbing and thoroughly entertaining. 
And the film is worth seeing for Fassbender 
alone. But in attempting to deconstruct the 
myth that is “Steve Jobs,” the filmmakers 
almost mythologize him further. Not until the 
very, very end does Jobs become something 
beyond a narcissistic, sardonic tyrant. His 
many verbal assaults are so effective, so biting 
and, for better or worse, so funny that we 
sometimes lose the perspective that Jobs is 
for the most part not a good person. That Jobs 
died four years ago only further muddies this 
portrayal, as we can look on him more fondly 
now that he’s gone.

When dealing with biopics, even ones as 

different as this, one must always separate 
reality from the art: “Steve Jobs” is not a true 
reflection of Steve Jobs, but a study of the myth 
of Steve Jobs. It’s an important distinction to 
remember as you watch the film. “Steve Jobs” 
isn’t a biography, but it ventures into deeper 
waters than any standard biopic could. “Think 
different” was Apple’s slogan back in 1997, and, 
at the very least, “Steve Jobs” does.

Lerner, chair of the College Democrats. “Despite some technical 
difficulties, it all worked out.”

Through a projection of a Skype video chat onto the wall of 

the Parker Room of the Michigan Union, Dillon told the crowd of 
about 30 that if they wish to run for office, he would encourage 
them to do it, even at a young age.

He recounted his first electoral bid for County Commission 

when he was 30 years old that ultimately failed by only 100 votes.

“If you’re thinking of running for an office, go talk to somebody 

that currently holds that office, whether it’s the school board, 
county commissioner or state representative,” he said. “The first 
thing you should realize is that if you want to do it, then you’re 
probably just as qualified as anybody else.”

Dillon ultimately found electoral success in running for Kent 

County commissioner and, subsequently, the state’s House of 
Representatives. He served as the commissioner for one year and 
as the representative for Michigan’s 75th district for four years 
before resigning to serve as MDP chair last August.

“We’d love for you to become part of the Democratic Party,” he 

said. “We want young people to become more of a part of the party 
structure.”

Dillon also shared his goals to reshape the Michigan Democratic 

Party as its chair, with more emphasis on grassroots and young-
voter input rather than what he called a “top-down approach.” The 
eventual goal: retake the State House and governor’s office.

He said a recent survey would be set the tone for a new 

statewide Democratic strategic planning initiative that will begin 
this Saturday.

“We’ll be getting input on what we need to do better, what 

our challenges are, and how we can get young people and non-
traditional Democratic voters to come out,” Dillon said.

Also present at the event was LSA sophomore Grant Strobl, 

president of the University’s chapter of Young Americans for 
Freedom, who was recording the event.

“It’s not something we’ve had in the past,” Lerner said, regarding 

Strobl. “But we hope to persuade people in other political student 
organizations.”

When contacted by The Michigan Daily Thursday evening, 

Strobl acknowledged he was recording the event on the behalf of 
the Michigan Republican Party.

How do you decide what courses 

to take, what majors to pursue and 
what requirements to tackle? If you 
are a typical, bright Wolverine, you 
ask your friends, an advisor or maybe 
even a professor. You check out the 
course guide and hope, hope, hope 
that the instructor has provided 
more than a three-sentence descrip-
tion, or maybe even linked a syllabus. 
You check out ratemyprofessor.com, 
knowing its data is not perfect, but 
realizing it’s better than nothing.

Wouldn’t 
it 
be 
nice 
to 
 

know more?

When you’re considering a class, 

it would be good to know who takes 
it. What courses do they take before, 
at the same time and after? What 
do they go on to major in? How do 
they do in the class — what’s the 
grade distribution? How have your 
fellow Michigan students rated this 
course, its workload and how much 
they learned? How have they rated 
the instructor?

The University has all this infor-

mation, but doesn’t currently share it 
with the students. It’s hoping to, and 
we think it’s a great idea.

The creepy aspects of the Infor-

mation Age receive a lot of atten-
tion, and for good reason. Many of us 
worry about the things governments 
and corporations know about us 
through the data they collect, some-
times behind our backs. But the digi-
tal footprints we leave have a positive 
potential, too. When information is 
collected and shared openly, it can be 
used for justice and equity, not just 
efficiency and profit. Here at the Uni-
versity, within our campus commu-
nity, students should be able to use 
data to learn from the experiences of 

their peers.

In 2012, we served on the Sen-

ate Assembly’s Academic Affairs 
Advisory Committee, a part of the 
University’s 
faculty 
governance. 

This group asked then-Provost 
Philip Hanlon to support emerg-
ing efforts to use data in support of 
teaching and learning at the Uni-
versity. He immediately did so, and 
the Learning Analytics Task Force 
was created. His successor, Provost 
Martha Pollack, has continued this 
support, and Michigan is now one of 
the nation’s leaders in using data to 
improve higher education.

For three years, LATF has worked 

to promote the use of data to improve 
teaching and learning at Michigan 
— to better understand our diverse 
student body and the challenges 
they face, to personalize learning, 
even in courses with thousands of 
students, and to create actionable 
information for faculty, staff and 
especially students.

These efforts led to the creation of 

the Digital Innovation Greenhouse, 
which develops digital learning tools 
from innovation to infrastructure. 
One of DIG’s tools is version 2.0 of 
the so-called Academic Reporting 
Toolkit, which provides rich quanti-
tative data about courses, who takes 
them, how they do and what else they 
do. The University is hoping to make 
part of this tool available to students, 
too. LATF also conducted analyses of 
other existing information tools on 
campus, including the student course 
evaluations. All this work has helped 
to create a community of learning 
analytics researchers, with interna-
tionally recognized leadership in the 
field.

Students are gradually becoming 

involved in our efforts. Some have 
participated in design jams to brain-
storm new tools (students know what 
they want better than we do). Some 
have helped us explore the immense 
amounts of data the University had 
the foresight to start collecting in a 
systematic way 20 years ago. But it’s 
time to take a bigger step — to enable 
all students to take advantage of 
more of the information we have. 

The first step is for the Univer-

sity to share some of it with students. 
This is happening slowly, but stay 
tuned — we’re excited about what the 
learning analytics community has 
developed for students to make even 
better decisions about their time at 
the University.

An even more important step, 

however, is to have you, the stu-
dents, as our partners. We believe 
appropriate 
access 
to 
relevant 

information is essential to the 
principles of beneficence, justice 
and transparency that have always 
guided our University community. 
To this end, we invite students, 
student groups and student govern-
ment to join us in these important 
conversations as partners in col-
lecting, exploring, improving and 
acting on data.

rowing up with three broth-
ers, it was never surpris-
ing to me when people told 

me that I wasn’t 
very 
“girly.” 
I 

was used to being 
called 
a 
tom-

boy when I was 
younger and was 
even 
applauded 

by 
my 
mother 

for not being a 
 

“girly girl.”

Now, instead 

of being a muddy 
sixth 
grader 

proudly refusing 
to wear skirts like the other girls, 
I’m a college senior who convinces 
herself that yoga pants and a white 
v-neck is a perfectly acceptable 
first-date outfit. I’m the kind of 
person who will announce mid-
sentence, “Hold on, I have to fart,” 
and depending on the company, 
leave or not leave the room. I’m the 
kind of person who fails to go an 
entire day without using some form 
of profanity.

At this stage in my life, it appears 

as if I have evolved from the realm 
of “not girly” to the even more com-
plicated label of “not ladylike.” Being 
constantly separated into a different 
category than other girls has some-
times made me feel like there actually 
is some part of me that will never be 
able to relate to other women. I find 
myself believing that all the things 
society labels as girly or ladylike are 
actually true of most women and 
that I’m awkwardly stuck in some 
in-between space with the rest of the 
people who will never figure out how 

to put on eyeliner. But even while 
writing this, I struggled to figure out 
what it even means to be ladylike.

Does it mean that I should wake 

up early every morning to shower, 
blow-dry my hair and put on make-
up? And am I supposed to know 
that I should have a “winter shade” 
and “summer shade” of makeup? 
Because I have a permanent shade 
of see-through tinged with pink, 
which unfortunately is not a shade 
available in stores.

Does it mean I should chew with 

my mouth closed while I eat salad 
and sip Moscato? (Don’t get me 
wrong, I love both salad and Mosca-
to. I also love eating burritos at 2 a.m. 
because Captain Morgan is telling 
me to listen to my heart).

Does being a lady mean that I have 

to shave my legs every single day 
instead of when I feel like it might 
clog the drain if I wait too much lon-
ger? (And on that note, does it mean I 
have to shower every day?) I should 
be perfectly spotless at all times, 
right? And speaking of spotless, I 
should never acknowledge the messy 
presence of periods, because periods 
are dirty and gross, right? Ladies 
don’t announce, “Be right back, gotta 
change my Diva Cup.” Instead they 
say, “Sorry, I need to use the rest-
room,” right? Because anything that 
may or may not inconvenience any-
one in any way should be prefaced 
with “sorry,” right?

Does it mean I should never raise 

my voice? Yelling isn’t ladylike, is 
it? In fact, I probably just shouldn’t 
be angry at all, ever. Does it 
mean instead of being blunt with 
someone, I should smile, nod and 

try to figure out how to do what I 
want anyway, but without them 
knowing? In fact, I should smile 
more, shouldn’t I? Does it mean 
I have to get rid of any “extra” 
piercings and tattoos? Does it mean 
I should stop listening to rap? What 
kind of music does a lady even listen 
to? Seriously. I have no idea.

Should I leave my soccer sweats 

and Target v-necks at home and trade 
them in for “form-fitting” (read: cut-
ting off blood circulation) jeans and 
a lacy shirt? And should I hobble 
around on heels because it makes me 
look more feminine?

If these are the things that decide 

whether I’m a “lady” or not, then by 
society’s standards, I most definitely 
am something else. Sure, I love 
dressing up, getting pedicures with 
my mom and belting out Taylor Swift 
songs when I’m driving alone. Heck, I 
even like rainbows and unicorns and 
the color pink. I always say please 
and thank you because my parents 
taught me how to be a decent human 
being. But all of these things have 
zero to do with me being a woman, 
or a girl or a lady. The fact that I’m 
perfectly comfortable pooping in 
public or talking about pooping in 
public does not make me any less or 
any more of a woman.

I’m pretty sure the only thing 

that makes someone ladylike is 
having two X-chromosomes, and 
even that’s not always true. This 
burping, swearing, brutally hon-
est person is a woman. A girl. A 
 

lady, dammit.

That’s not very ladylike

Students need data, too

A

ccording to the University’s newly released statistics, 
minority enrollment for the freshman class of 2015 is 12.8 
percent — the highest rate since 2005 — creating hope that 

University President Mark Schlissel’s new diversity initiatives will 
prove successful. Along with a 2.8-percent increase in overall minority 
enrollment from 2014’s entering class, socioeconomic diversity also 
improved, with the number of low-income students rising to 10.2 
percent of the freshman class. While these numbers are promising, 
the University must continue to improve its diversity statistics through 
proactive initiatives or risk being seen as uninviting to students of 
 

all backgrounds.

Dedicated to diversity

As statistics improve, ‘U’ should keep striving for inclusivity

The University has a complicated and 

storied history when it comes to achieving a 
diverse student body. In 2003, the Supreme 
Court heard two cases concerning affirmative 
action at the University. Grutter v. Bollinger 
upheld the constitutionality of the Law School’s 
“holistic approach” in its use of affirmative 
action. Opposingly, the Court decided in Gratz 
v. Bollinger that a point-based system used by 
undergraduate admissions was not narrowly 
tailored enough to reach the University’s goal 
of diversity. Subsequently, in 2006, Michigan 
voters passed Proposal 2, which effectively 
banned affirmative action across the state. This, 
in addition to tuition hikes and other deterrents, 
have led to the decreasing minority enrollment at 
the University. In 2005, minority undergraduate 
enrollment was at 13.8 percent, but by 2006 it had 
dropped to 12.4 percent. Last year, the University 
was criticized as the school’s student body has 
slowly become both wealthier and whiter.

At the beginning of his tenure at the 

University, Schlissel outlined several initiatives 
aimed at increasing the falling rates of racial 
and socioeconomic diversity. In 2015, the 
University provided incoming freshmen with 
an 8.1-percent increase in financial aid packages, 
sent acceptance letters that included financial 
aid packages and also increased recruitment in 
areas that traditionally received less attention 
from University undergraduate admissions. 

Other initiatives include creating long-term 

partnerships with K-12 districts to support 
bright students who aspire to attend the 
University and introducing a new scholarship 
called H.A.I.L. for high-achieving students of 
lower socioeconomic status. A comprehensive 
plan detailing even more diversity recruitment 
policies is due at the end of this calendar year, 
and is set to be rolled out in September 2016.

While many of Schlissel’s new initiatives 

focus on the price of college, the most important 
steps will be the ones centered on making the 
campus inclusive. In 2014, then-University 
President Mary Sue Coleman claimed that 
Michigan’s diversity issue was not from a lack of 
minority applications, but rather the challenge 
of converting accepted students into enrollees. 
Critics charge that the University has stopped 

seeming 
accessible 
to 
underrepresented 

minorities and lower-income students, both 
financially and by lacking a campus atmosphere 
that fosters tolerance and diversity. The 
University has begun to combat these criticisms 
by planning to relocate Trotter Multicultural 
Center to Central Campus by 2017 and 
increasing the Black Student Union’s budget.

In addition to official University endeavors, 

students hope they can change the mindset 
that campus is unwelcoming to minorities and 
lower-income students. LSA and Engineering 
junior Will Royster began a program called 
the Michigan Institute for the Improvement 
of African American Representation through 
the BSU to encourage minority high school 
students to view the University as both an 
attainable and attractive goal. The University 
has largely relied on both official recruitment 
trips and student-run programs like these to 
show minority students that our campus is 
worth aspiring toward. Increased efforts in 
these areas should obviously be a priority on the 
administration’s part.

While the new diversity initiatives are 

promising, 
the 
University 
must 
remain 

aggressive in their plans to increase the number 
of both minority and lower-income students, 
especially those from the state of Michigan. 
It is especially important for the University 
to once again feel accessible to students of all 
backgrounds. As a public school, the University 
has an obligation to the people of the state to 
offer a world-class education and campus that 
is accessible to all backgrounds. The more 
diversity the campus has to offer, the more 
diversity it will be able to attract.

While increases in financial aid and 

scholarship money are a step in the right 
direction, 
students 
will 
only 
enroll 
at 

the University when they feel a sense of 
belonging on campus. Diversity does not stop 
at admissions, and the administration must 
continue to implement programs on campus 
that create a more inclusive environment. 
The University has fallen behind in attracting 
minority 
and 
low-income 
students, 
and 

rectifying the issue must remain a top priority 
of current and future administrations.

LACEY

TIM MCKAY AND MIKA LAVAQUE-MANTY | VIEWPOINT

I 

get sick twice a year — in late September 
and early March, right around the time 
when the daily amount of sunlight 

changes at the equinox. 
Other than the semiannual 
cold and mild allergies in 
August, I’m in pretty good 
health for the rest of the 
year.

While it’s nice to know 

when 
I 
can 
expect 
a 

cold to be coming on — 
I 

think it has to do with 
my Vitamin D levels — it 
doesn’t make being sick 
any easier, especially since 
these times of year coincide 
with a pretty heavy load 
of schoolwork. I can try to be prepared — by 
carrying tissues, eating even more fruits and 
veggies than usual, and fitting in adequate hours 
of sleep every night — but it still sucks for that 
week or so when I’m not up for much other than 
lying around in bed yet still need to drag myself 
to class.

According to Lisa Sturm, managing director 

of the infection control and epidemiology at 
the University of Michigan Health System, 
September and October are when University 

Health Services sees the greatest number of 
illnesses among students. People are coming 
back to campus from all over, resulting in a 
general trading of germs going on in town. 
People touch the doors of classrooms, desktops, 
keyboards and public-access computing stations, 
the spines of books in the libraries, maybe a 
squirrel as they’re crossing campus, the backs 
of seats — the list is endless. And on every one 
of those surfaces there are plenty of germs to be 
concerned about.

So what’s the best way to avoid getting sick?
Sturm recommends a couple of common-

sense measures that, for all their simplicity, get 
overlooked far too often: washing your hands 
regularly and being sure to cover your cough. 
“Your best defense is your own personal hand 
hygiene,” she said.

In other words, if you don’t have a sleeve or 

handkerchief to cough into, catching a sneeze 
in your hands is far preferable to nothing at all. 
Just be sure to wash your hands soon after, since 
you don’t want to then spread those germs onto 
other people. It’s a good idea to carry a pocket-
sized bottle of hand sanitizer in your purse or 
backpack, so it’ll be on hand if you need it.

And in the present day more than ever, 

it’s important to keep up to date on vaccines, 
including the seasonal flu vaccine, as flu 

Take a sick day

season runs for pretty much the 
entire 
academic 
year. 
Perhaps 

just as important are vaccinations 
against meningitis, which Sturm 
says is surprisingly common among 
Michigan’s student body.

It’s impossible to avoid germs 

and viruses altogether, of course, 
and most of us do tend to fall sick 
at some point during the school 
year. But, by keeping yourself in 
good health and keeping your 
hands clean, you can reduce your 
chances. And if you do find yourself 
sick, Sturm recommends “the old 
adage: rest, chicken noodle soup 
and fluids” as the best treatment for 
the common cold.

While it’s understandable that 

no one wants to take time off for 
being sick and risk missing out on 
important 
material, 
Sturm 
says 

it’s sometimes necessary. If you’re 
feverish or sick enough to vomit; if 
you’re blowing your nose every other 
minute and can’t stop sneezing; or 
if you have diarrhea, you should 
probably stay home. The good news 
is that with bed rest and a few doses 
of chicken noodle soup, most mild 
colds clear up within a few days. For 
more serious illnesses, it may become 

necessary to seek out professional 
health care from UHS or another 
healthcare provider.

UMHS staff, Sturm says, are 

required to take time off if they’re 
sick, and aren’t allowed to return 
to work until they remain free of 
symptoms for 24 hours or more. 
Perhaps that sort of policy would 
serve our student body well, as it 
would ensure that the most active 
germs would be contained within 
our 
apartments, 
dorm 
rooms, 

houses or lofts. Of course, staying 
home poses another challenge, as 
your being ill requires roommates, 
housemates, friends and significant 
others to dance around you for 
fear that whatever you have might 
 

be catching.

But at the end of the day, if you’re 

truly too sick to attend class and 
perform well, you’ll probably be glad 
you refrained from hauling yourself 
across campus, just so you could 
sneeze on classmates, doorknobs 
desks and any bold squirrels who 
came too near. “You’re not helping 
anybody, and you’re not helping 
yourself either. You’re not resting,” 
Sturm says. “Please don’t do us any 
favors! … Stay home.”

Ultimately, only you can make 

the decision, but when you’re that 
kind of sick, you’ll probably know. 
For me a couple of weeks ago, the 
need to stay home was signaled 
by a lasting headache, runny nose 
and a nap that took up most of my 
Friday afternoon. That day, I opted 
to trade homework for bed rest, 
and on Saturday I did it again. By 
Monday, I was ready to return to 
classes and the general buzz of 
activity on campus, but I was also 
really glad I’d taken time for rest 
when I needed to.

And trust me — if you’re sick 

enough to be wondering whether 
you should sleep in, chances are 
you’re leaning the right way. E-mail 
your professors to let them know 
you’re not feeling well, and ask 
whether there might be extra-credit 
opportunities you could use to make 
up your attendance. Then kick back 
with a tall glass of orange juice, a 
handful of tissues and maybe some 
of next week’s assigned reading. Or, 
y’know, just take a nap. I’m pretty 
sure you’ll be glad you did.

Amagatsu 
uses 
Butoh 

as 
a 
medium 
with 
which 

to 
explore 
the 
prehistory 

of 
the 
individual, 
linking 

the 
movement 
of 
dancers’ 

bodies to a primordial human 
“correspondence with gravity,” 
using Amagatsu’s phrase, that 
begins in the womb.

“I basically think that Butoh 

is a dialogue with gravity. That 
is not repulsion to gravity, but 
it is closer to conformity with 
gravity. 
Therefore, 
a 
little 

careful way of corresponding 
with gravity is necessary. In 
this view, some people might say 
our dance is a slow-motion, but 
it’s not,” Amagatsu said. “It is a 
result of careful correspondence 
with gravity.”

Related to this, Amagatsu 

said 
in 
an 
interview 
with 

“Vogue Hommes 98-99,” that 
“dance is composed of tension 
and relaxation of gravity just 
like the principle of life and 
its process. An unborn baby 
who is floating inside mother’s 
womb faces to the tension of the 

gravity as soon as s/he is born.” 
The whole excerpt is available 
in the UMS program booklet for 
the performance.

Sankai 
Juku’s 
spectacular 

achievements are founded on 
an aesthetic that weds form 
and content, the doing and 
the 
saying 
seamlessly. 
The 

choreographic 
technique 

Butoh itself communicates the 
primordial conflicts with which 
Amagatsu and the rest of the 
company are interested. With 
Amagatsu at the helm, Sankai 
Juku explores what Jean Viala 
and Nourit Masson-Sekine call 
“a kind of human archaeology” 
in their book “Butoh: Shades of 
Darkness.”

‘Bridge of Spies’ 
good, not great

FILM REVIEW

Latest Spielberg 
drama fails to live 

up to promise

By CONRAD FOREMAN

Daily Arts Writer

It’s Spielberg. It’s Hanks. Of 

course “Bridge of Spies” is pretty 
damn good. But not great.

In the thick 

of 
the 
Cold 

War, insurance 
lawyer 
James 

B. 
Donovan 

(Tom 
Hanks, 

“Toy 
Story”) 

is called to an 
unorthodox 
patriotic duty: 
Defend a Soviet 
spy in order to 
demonstrate the fairness of the 
U.S. legal system. But, although 
the task was set as a formality 
and a nod to his ability, Dono-
van defies his bosses, his family 
and, in many an eye, his country, 
when his involvement with the 
case leads him to the Supreme 
Court and, ultimately, Berlin.

Given the current climate of U.S.-

Russian relations, Cold War politics 
feel especially relevant. War mov-
ies with huge directors and stars 
are about World War II, Vietnam. 
Spy movies are supposed to thrill, 
twist and intrigue at every turn. 
“Bridge of Spies” carries a fast pace, 
but there’s no mystery to solve and 
no world to save. The significance is 
understated, yet understood. This 
was a world perhaps on the brink 
of destroying itself, and these were 
the men taking measured steps to 
avoid destruction.

Though he begins fighting for 

the rights of a Soviet, Donovan 
truly fights for the American ideal. 
He instills a hard work ethic in 
his young associate. He advocates 
extension of basic rights, and 
embodies basic humanity. He can-
not decline a call to duty. He refus-
es to leave any man behind.

Director Steven Spielberg and 

cinematographer Janusz Kamin-
ski have won two Academy 
Awards each, working together 
on “Schindler’s List” and “Saving 
Private Ryan.” The mastery shows. 
A pair of shots juxtapose children 
jumping a chain link fence and 
people fleeing over the Berlin Wall. 
A cut between the courtroom and 
the classroom comments on edu-
cation and governance through 
allegiance and obedience.

Hanks is one of the best actors 

of our time, but the performance 
won’t go down as one of his best. 
The film is about the big picture; 
like its main character, “Bridge of 

Spies” sacrifices personal conse-
quence to serve a greater purpose. 
Minimization of familial drama 
was the right decision (especially 
anything that might have been 
between Donovan’s daughter and 
his young associate), though a 
deeper understanding of Soviet 
spy Rudolph Abel (Mark Rylance, 
“The Other Boleyn Girl”) might 
have made a richer emotional arc. 
Perhaps his anonymity was part of 
the point, but because his motiva-
tions aren’t explored, his exchang-
es with Donovan don’t impact as 
strongly as they could.

Based on a true story, the film 

highlights an era that can be easy 
for us to overlook, since the war 
never heated up. The quality of 
filmmaking, from shot composi-
tion to editing to acting, is top 
notch. But “Bridge of Spies” won’t 
move you like “Schindler’s List,” 
won’t scare you like “Jaws,” and 
won’t amaze you like “Jurassic 
Park.” It isn’t great.

Power suit.

By SELENA AGUILERA

For The Daily

As I sat down in Starbucks, I stuck 

my headphones in my ears to be 
completely immersed in Deerhunt-
er’s new release, 
Fading Frontier. 
My expectations 
were pretty low, 
considering this 
was their sev-
enth album since 
the band formed 
in 
2001. 
The 

increasing trend 
is that bands sell 
out after their third or fourth album 
as their music boils down to simple 
four-chord progressions with repet-
itive lyrics that are dull and shallow. 
I only suspected Deerhunter to fol-
low the trend since their time was 
past due.

After ignoring the girls that were 

shrieking about their pumpkin spice 
lattes and pressing the “Skip Ad” but-
ton, Fading Frontier started flood-
ing into my brain. Within seconds, 
every low expectation that nested in 
my head was washed away. I guess 
I shouldn’t have underestimated the 
band’s musical talent considering 
their second record, Cryptograms, 
was recorded in a matter of two days 
and the bands four members are all 
proficient in more than one instru-
ment.

Frontman Bradford Cox also 

stated (likely to spite pop culture) “… 
I decided to be gay, so I never have 
kids who love Taylor Swift,” just to 
have a spoken promise to us that 
Deerhunter will never sell out. Deer-
hunter will never succumb to pop 
culture and no album Deerhunter 
has released has broken that prom-
ise.

Fading Frontier was released 

after Cox sustained serious injuries 

from a traumatic car accident. In the 
haze of his post-accident depression, 
Cox wanted to release something 
that put out a good vibe, contrary to 
the previous albums filled with the 
usual anger and angst. The band 
succeeded with songs like “Break-
er” and “Snakeskin” that resemble 
the catchy tunes that reached the 
top of the charts in the ’80s. They 
put out a “feel good” vibe, and 
when they’re playing no one dares 
to turn them off. The songs surge 
calming energy through your 
veins.

Cox expressed that he wanted 

the record to feel like the first day 
of spring after a long winter, and 
that’s exactly what it feels like. 
The first song, “All the Same,” lets 
you enter a world where worry 
disintegrates from your body like 
seasonal depression disappears on 
that first sunny day. The music is 
sensual, and you can’t help but to 

close your eyes and sit in euphoria 
while listening to it.

The lyrics go a long way toward 

setting the record’s emotional 
tenor, with the words in songs like 
“Leather and Wood,” where Cox 
chimes, “I believe the sun will 
rise/ In the east now/ I believe 
we will find/ That elusive peace 
now,” summoning a feeling of 

serenity when the music vibrates 
in your eardrums. 

Each song off Fading Frontier 

is composed so wonderfully that 
it regulates your heartbeat. It 
has you in a state of meditation 
without realizing it. The known 
indie rock style Deerhunter has 
contrasts with the futuristic alien 
sound in certain songs like “Ad 

Astra,” and “Duplex Planet,” creat-
ing an out of body experience with 
each listen.

Listen to Fading Frontier with 

no distractions from beginning to 
end with your eyes closed. It will 
feel like you are traveling among 
the stars. Deerhunter never disap-
points, and Fading Frontier is out of 
this world.

LP feels like spring

‘Truth Be Told,’ new 
NBC show is stale

TV REVIEW

By DANIELLE YACOBSON

For The Daily

Truth be told, it’s hard to find a 

redeeming quality in NBC’s latest 
sitcom. Originally titled “People 
Are 
Talking,” 

the series pre-
miere 
of 
DJ 

Nash’s 
“Truth 

Be Told” com-
pletely 
missed 

the mark. Domi-
nated by clichés, 
the dry script is 
further 
suffo-

cated by the stiff 
actors’ attempts 
to deliver what 
could only be 
interpreted as “comedy” with the 
help of an overused laugh track. 
While “Best friends. Real talk. 
Uncensored” may be the show’s 
slogan, viewers should utilize their 
uncensored, real talk and warn 
their best friends to stay far, far 
away.

Mitch (Mark-Paul Gosselaar, 

“Saved by the Bell”) and Russell 
(Tone Bell, “Bad Judge”) are best 
friends and neighbors. Paired 
with Mitch’s wife Tracy (Vanessa 
Lachey, “Disaster Movie”) and 
Russell’s wife Angie (Bresha Webb, 
“The American Mall”), the multi-
racial couples pass commentary 
on race and ethnicity as they go 
about their daily encounters. For 
these characters, a trip to pick up 
Chinese food immediately leads to 
questioning the authenticity of the 
waitress’s Chinese accent. Though 
the show advertises an outlet for 
candid and witty dialogue, the pre-
miere falls short on both fronts, as 
the characters shy away from any 
controversial comments as soon as 

a sensitive topic is breached.

The sitcom attempts to use 

Mitch and Russell’s dynamic 
friendship to challenge everyday 
racism, but rather than encourag-
ing their confrontations to become 
a social norm, their frank remarks 
are instead coined as “uncen-
sored.” For example, when a valet 
assumes that a luxurious sports 
car belongs to Mitch, who is white, 
(though it actually belongs to Rus-
sell, who is African American), 
Mitch takes the opportunity to 
point out the valet’s inadvertent 
mistake. However, instead of deliv-
ering a witty comment to this 
effect, Mitch aggressively accuses 
the man of being a racist, to which 
the valet responds that it was 
actually the John Mayer CD that 
tipped him off. The friends awk-
wardly shy away, the laugh track 
plays and the show quickly moves 
on to a completely unrelated scene, 
contradicting the original premise 
of “real talk.”

The script continues to barely 

scratch the surface of various ste-
reotypes, as weak punchlines are 
delivered about stealing their Jew-
ish neighbors’ “ethnically ambigu-
ous” babysitter on a Friday night. 
Clearly, the cultural remarks on 
racism and religion are supposed 

to offer comedic relief, but they are 
instead overused and often taste-
less. Without any original humor 
or insight, the script falls flat and 
fails to follow a clear direction. 
Every scene seems to touch on a 
different stereotype, and there 
are at least three discrete story-
lines within the first episode alone. 
Not only does jumping from topic 
to topic lose the viewer’s interest 
in the cluttered plot, but it fails 
to establish any emotional con-
nection between the characters. 
Even Mitch and Russell, whose 
bromance is at the center of the sit-
com, severely lack chemistry and 
depth.

Perhaps the most disappoint-

ing flaw in “Truth Be Told” is the 
abundance of tropes that plague 
the premiere’s plotline. Looking 
through a significant other’s texts 
and hiring a hot babysitter have 
been the premises of one too many 
comedies already, like “Friends” 
and “How I Met Your Mother.” 
The audience has seen both these 
scenarios play out before, and 
there are no surprises this time 
around either. Moreover, for both 
plots to be crowded into a single 
episode gives the impression that 
the writers don’t have anything 
new to say from the beginning.

From the stilted acting to 

the cringe-worthy jokes, Fri-
day night’s premiere of “Truth 
Be Told” was disappointing in 
every way. The 22-minute epi-
sode seemed to drag on as each 
failed attempt at comedy felt more 
uncomfortable than the last. In 
order to recover post-viewing, 
watching a classic episode of 
“Friends” is the perfect way to 
remember what an enjoyable 
experience a sitcom can be.

BOYFRIEND JEANS 

ARE ONTOLOGICALLY 

DESTRUCTIVE

 By CATHERINE SULPIZIO 

Senior Arts Editor

 Consider the boyfriend jean 

that has gained a new popular-
ity on campus, where hardly a 
passing period can go by with-
out a stream of (female) stu-
dents crossing the Diag in the 
loose, tattered jeans that sit 
attractively low on the torso. 
When we left for summer, 
jeans were still sealed up and 
adhered tightly to the leg. A few 
months brings a new silhouette 
and a new aesthetic. But is the 
boyfriend jean new?

 The boyfriend jean osten-

sibly belonged to a boyfriend, 
stolen by the gamine who takes 
off with his sweatshirt and base-
ball cap too. But this isn’t cross-
dressing so much as dress-up 
that 
brings 
femininity 
into 

sharp relief (that angular hip, 
the slip of tan thigh, etc.). The 
boyfriend jean writes its story 
on its leg: here is evidence of a 
partner, a brash sartorial con-
fidence and a life ruggedly had, 
evinced by the holes that limbs 
poke out of. In short, the jean 
signifies authenticity, a scyth-
ing through layers that mask the 
body, an emergence of organic 
flesh through all that fabric 
and a refusal to care about all 

this. If Adam and Eve clothed 
themselves with his-and-her 
fig leaves out of shame, boy-
friend jeans illustrate that now 
what is his is also hers and can 
be tossed aside without shame. 
Boyfriend jeans show a com-
modity displaced from its ideal 
market, used long after it cycles 
out of fashion and until it can no 
longer work. Boyfriend jeans are 
anti-capitalist.

 Of course, the boyfriend 

jean rarely has that backstory: 
Boyfriends, at least the boy-
friends of well dressed female 
ilk, are about as likely to wear the 
stonewashed, slightly frumpy fit 
of dad jeans required for a good 
“boyfriend” jean as a chain wal-
let or neon windbreaker. The 
boyfriend wears jeans as tight as 
yours (this is 2015 gender equal-
ity) and maybe has a waxed pair 
too. We bought our pairs from 
Urban Outfitters or Citizens of 
Humanity. Therefore, this skin 
is rendered inauthentic when 
its emergence is prefigured by 
a factory that carefully fixes 
an identical set of holes onto 
an identical set of jeans, sewn 
for female bodies. In this way, 
boyfriend jeans render the skin 
that it reveals as artificial as the 
nature of itself. Boyfriend jeans 
are ontologically destructive. 

Y

ou know the drill. Class just 
ended, and conveniently, 
Drake’s latest album is still 

fresh on the charts. You’re alone. 
You pop in your headphones, pre-
tending to 
resonate with 
the joyous 
camaraderie 
that comes 
with having “a 
really big team” 
and you’re 
troubled by the 
obstacle that 
is your dearth 
of “really big 
rings” — cru-
cial to cohesively accessorize the 
aforementioned squad.

During 
my 
Drizzy-powered 

strolls, I prefer to envision a 
flustered 
Drake 
relentlessly 

demanding rings at a Cartier or 
Tiffany’s boutique each time I hear 
“Big Rings” (music video ideas!) 
rather than attempting to relate 
his triumphant lyricism to my life. 
Jokes aside, I cherish my solo walks 
to class. It’s my amble of comfortable 
solitude; a saunter to recharge, 
re-center and, when time permits, 
stop for the essential overdose of 
caffeine that prompts my loquacity 
in awkward discussion sections. 
But, a successful stroll cannot 
be endured without some sound 
synching with my strides.

Oftentimes, I decidedly jam to my 

perfectly curated playlist entitled 
‘hype walk to class’ to ensure a 
journey through the Diag that is of 
the hype variety. But last week, I 
forwent my methodical after-class 
routine and opted for the musings 
of the Man Repeller podcast “Oh 
boy” per recommendation of my 
Senior Arts Editor.

For those who don’t know (for 

starters, help yourself and hop 
off the laggard train, life awaits), 
Leandra Medine is the founder 
of/subversive queen behind the 
gloriously 
feminist, 
intelligent, 

quippy and style-centric entity that 
is the Man Repeller website. She’s 
the patron saint of the individual 
and the steadfast champion of the 
indescribable. She simply can’t be 
defined; and though she can’t be 

placed into a characteristic box, 
she reminds you that you shouldn’t 
even attempt to reduce her, yourself 
or others to any rigid definition.

For nearly five years, Medine 

has given her cult followers what 
we don’t know we need when 
we don’t know we need it. She 
has revolutionized how we think 
and talk about fashion with 
her 
stunning 
irreverence 
and 

amendments to our collective 
sartorial vernacular (remember 
when we all abused the term “arm 
party” in 2012? Yeah, she started 
that). Her ingenious collection of 
words and concepts can be found 
within the site’s “Dick-shun-ary,” 
likely to soon rival Oxford’s. Yet, the 
MR universe isn’t all witty banter: 
sometimes, she gets really deep 
(see: Is Kim Kardashian the New 
Jeff Koons?)

Her baby of a blog extends to 

Twitter, 
Instagram, 
Facebook 

and Tumblr presences, and since 
its late-August debut, boasts a 
podcast with over 50,000 iTunes 
downloads. In the same vein of 
Medine’s eclecticism, “Oh boy”s 
impressive assortment of guests 
and topics covered deems it a 
space where anything goes and 
everything’s understood. 

Each hour-ish long episode is 

a conversation between either 
Medine, or the site’s resident 
filmmaker 
Jay 
Buim, 
and 
a 

relatively 
well-known 
woman 

holding an enviable position in the 
creative workforce. Of the nine 
episodes currently available for 
streaming, guests have ranged 
from Amy O’Dell, online editor of 
Cosmopolitian magazine, to Kiran 
Gandhi, drummer for singer M.I.A. 
who made headlines in early August 
for running the London Marathon 
sans tampon. Other guests include 
immersion 
journalist 
Rebecca 

Harrington, fashion virtuoso Stacy 
London, 
startup-veteran 
Payal 

Kadaka, 
entrepreneur 
Jordana 

Kier, actress Whitney Cummings 
and MR deputy editor, Amelia 
Diamond. Essentially, it’s your ideal 
phonebook of boss women whose 
numbers you don’t have, a mere 
download away.

Besides the obvious benefits 

of devoting most of my time to 
absorbing the insightful wisdom of 
inspiring women, “Oh boy” revs me 
up for class more than any Drake 
song ever could; the ambition and 
life/work passion imbued within 
each chat is infectious. Though still 
under the multi-faceted umbrella 
of style, these portable life lessons 
don’t merely focus on the latest 
trends, they’re intimate one-on-
ones ranging from the creative 
perils of self-doubt to the grit 
behind the glossy-façade of success. 
Each conversation delves into the 
life’s work of wildly accomplished 
women 
and 
fashion’s 
greater 

context — it’s a voice of reason and 
realism through the comedic lens. 
It’s brilliant.

Fashion, in short, is confusing 

and complex. Yet, if you look at the 
ever-expanding industry today, 
it’s clear we’re moving past the 
catty and sassy and into an era 
of acceptance and accessibility. 
Two weeks ago, supermodel Gigi 
Hadid called out body-shaming 
trolls on Instagram. Six years ago, 
Olivier Rousteig took the reins of 
prestigious French design house 
Balmain, and made it viewable 
and enticing to Millenials. For 
the duration of her career from 
co-founding TrendMicro to her 
current stint at Instagram, fashion-
maven Eva Chen has consistently 
reminded us that fashion can, 
and needs to be, nice. Anomalous 
leaders like Hadid, Rousteig, Chen 
and Medine are redefining fashion’s 
negative connotations of insularity 
with an inviting openness and 
refreshing realness.

Sure, certain spheres of luxury’s 

inherent exclusivity will never 
change (read: you’ll still probably 
spend most of your life on the 
waiting list for a Birkin). But fear 
not, there’s a kind, new generation 
committed to getting real.

For now, it’s still a time to be alive. 

But even Drake agrees, Medine and 
her podcast are onto something — 
fashion’s inclusive era.

Oh boy, Man 

Repeller tosses it

‘Jobs’ mythologizes

FILM REVIEW

By RACHEL KERR 

Daily Arts Writer

I proudly admit that most of the 

technology I own was made by 
Apple. I can’t thank Steve Jobs and 
Apple 
enough 

for them: they’re 
elegant yet sim-
ple enough for 
my technologi-
cally challenged 
brain to compre-
hend. But these 
words “elegant” 
and “simple” do 
not apply to Steve Jobs himself, or, 
at least, that’s how we have come 
to remember him in the four years 
since his death. No doubt, Jobs 
defined a generation of tech for 
laymen and has proved a cultural 
icon — but is he a complex, some-
times self-hating conundrum, too 
intricate and secretive to decon-
struct? Screenwriter Aaron Sor-
kin (“The Social Network”) and 
director Danny Boyle (“Trance”) 
seem to think so, as they attempt to 
separate the myth from the man in 
“Steve Jobs.”

Admittedly, this is not your typ-

ical biopic, and Sorkin deserves 
all of the credit in the world for 
breaking with such a contrived 
structure. Rather than simply 
watching a retelling of his life, we 
follow Jobs (Michael Fassbender, 
“X-Men: Days of Future Past”) 
and his coworkers and friends (or 
are they enemies?) at three differ-
ent product launches in 1984, 1988 
and 1998. Sorkin relies on dia-
logue and several flashbacks to fill 
in the details we missed between 
each showcase. This plays to his 
strength, as he fills the scenes 
with rich dialogue with a classic 
Sorkinian bite.

But what we gain in distinctive 

story structure, we lose in direct 
narrative continuity. One can view 
“Steve Jobs” almost as three sepa-
rate, 40-minute short films. We 
don’t really need anything that 
comes before or after each seg-
ment because they are completely 
self-contained, and any otherwise 
missing information is filled in 
through a flashback. And before 
each segment begins, we get a 
montage of news stories that catch 
us up on the inter-launch years and 
set the stage for what’s to come. 
Technically speaking, it all works, 

but the separated segments keep 
us at a distance. We cannot see 
Jobs himself grow and his rela-
tionships evolve; instead, we are 
forced to simply accept that some-
thing has changed, “Oh he’s nice to 
his daughter now. That’s cool.”

This distance may be Sorkin and 

Boyle’s attempt to reflect Jobs’s 
mind within the narrative struc-
ture itself. The story makes very 
clear that Jobs is locked into each 
event, his mind zoned in on one 
objective: success. And anything 
that hampers that success must be 
expunged. Boyle and Sorkin pro-
vide us with glimpses into his mind 
— images and videos often appear 
on walls, and brief cuts back to 
previous segments are roughly 
inserted to reflect his emotional 
conflict — as further endorsement 
of this idea. But, then again, Sor-
kin’s ego may have just kicked in 
and he decided to be different for 
the sake of difference (you know, 
because he’s Aaron Sorkin).

(As the camera follows Jobs 

around the various theaters, 
I couldn’t help but recall the 
long tracking shots of “Bird-
man;” both films share a theme 
of closed, contained spaces as 
reflections of the psyche.) 

But the Sorkin-Boyle dynamic 

ultimately proves somewhat dis-
appointing — they’re just too 
mismatched. “The Social Net-
work” works so well because 
Sorkin’s cold, disconnected char-
acter could be reflected in David 
Fincher’s cold, calculated direc-
tion. Boyle, by contrast, uses the 
camera in a more embracive fash-
ion, and he is always sympathetic 
to his characters, even when his 
characters are complete scum (see 
“Trainspotting”).

Boyle is forced to look at Jobs 

in two lights: one as the misan-
thropic boss and one as the father 
and friend learning to be a decent 
human being. And the contrast 
between the two from a filmmak-
ing standpoint is quite stark.

Let me explain. There’s a 

scene early on where Jobs con-
fronts Andy Hertzfeld (Michael 
Stuhlberg, “Pawn Sacrifice”), an 
original Macintosh developer, 
in front of several other Apple 
employees for failing to properly 
set up the demo computer. The 
camera circles around the two 
characters, and we see the fear 
on the other employees’ faces and 
sense the dread instilled by Jobs. 
We understand that this environ-
ment is, quite simply, toxic all the 
way around. The film shines in 
moments like these. But in scenes 
where Joanna Hoffman (Kate 
Winslet, “Insurgent”), another 
member of the original Macin-
tosh team, tries to lecture Jobs 
about being a more sympathetic 
individual, the camera does a 
standard close-up shot counter-
shot; it’s just not nearly as much 
fun nor as telling and impactful 

as the scene could be.

But where the structure fails, 

the performances elevate. Fass-
bender will undoubtedly receive 
an Oscar nomination for his work 
here. He immerses himself in 
the character and balances the 
forcefulness of the character with 
subtlety, but no less drive, in his 
quieter, more earnest scenes. And 
Jeff Daniels (HBO’s “The News-
room”) as former Apple CEO John 
Sculley demonstrates incredible 
charisma, representing a formi-
dable opponent to Fassbender. 
The climactic, tense confrontation 
between the two after Jobs’ dis-
missal from Apple proves electri-
fying, the film’s finest moment.

Seth Rogen (“The Interview”) 

as Steve Wozniak displays con-
siderable range and heart. We get 
the sense that the Jobs-Wozniak 
relationship seems the most at risk 
to Jobs’s toxicity. It’s clear the two 
have some kind of respect for each 
other, or maybe an almost frater-
nal obligation to each other, and 
at times they seem to truly care. 
But the two are so diametrically 
opposed in their desires — Jobs 
demands control over Wozniak 
and his ingenuity, where Wozniak 
yearns for some kind of recognition 
for his success and role in trans-
forming computing, if not from 
the public then at least from Jobs 
— that their dynamic will eventu-
ally crumble beneath them. It’s a 
deeply interesting relationship, one 
that deserves a bit more exploration 
than the film devotes to it.

So is “Steve Jobs” a success? Yes 

and no. The film is rooted in dia-
logue rather than images, so those 
who prefer to see rather than hear 
will be disappointed. However, the 
dialogue is, on the whole, absorb-
ing and thoroughly entertaining. 
And the film is worth seeing for 
Fassbender alone. But in attempt-
ing to deconstruct the myth that 
is “Steve Jobs,” the filmmakers 
almost mythologize him further. 
Not until the very, very end does 
Jobs become something beyond a 
narcissistic, sardonic tyrant. His 
many verbal assaults are so effec-
tive, so biting and, for better or 
worse, so funny that we sometimes 
lose the perspective that Jobs is for 
the most part not a good person. 
That Jobs died four years ago only 
further muddies this portrayal, as 
we can look on him more fondly 
now that he’s gone.

When dealing with biopics, 

even ones as different as this, one 
must always separate reality from 
the art: “Steve Jobs” is not a true 
reflection of Steve Jobs, but a study 
of the myth of Steve Jobs. It’s an 
important distinction to remem-
ber as you watch the film. “Steve 
Jobs” isn’t a biography, but it ven-
tures into deeper waters than any 
standard biopic could. “Think dif-
ferent” was Apple’s slogan back in 
1997, and, at the very least, “Steve 
Jobs” does.

Michigan has depth, but 
experience in question

By JACOB GASE 

Daily Sports Editor

After barely escaping with 

a .500 record and missing 
the postseason for the first 
time since 2010, the Michigan 
men’s basketball team likely 
views last season as a year to 
forget. Upset losses to the New 
Jersey Institute of Technology 
and 
Eastern 
Michigan 
and 

subsequent 
injuries 
to 
star 

guards — namely then-junior 
Caris 
LeVert 
and 
then-

sophomore Derrick Walton Jr. 
— left the young Wolverines in 
shambles.

But while starting several 

freshmen may have seemed like 
a drawback last season, it may 
come as a blessing to Michigan 
this year. The Wolverines return 
all five starters from last season 
and nine total players who 
averaged at least 10 minutes. 
Throw in redshirt freshman 
forward D.J. Wilson, freshman 
forward Moritz Wagner and 
a 
newly-eligible 
transfer 
in 

redshirt 
sophomore 
guard 

Duncan Robinson, and Michigan 
has a rotation that could extend 
as deep as 12 players.

In fact, a recent ESPN study 

ranked the Wolverines as the 
third-most experienced power-
conference 
team 
based 
on 

percentages of returning minutes 
and possessions.

Depth still can’t be confused 

with experience, though, and 
Michigan coach John Beilein is 
well aware of that.

“Compared to last year, they’re 

still not an experienced team,” 
Beilein said. “Yes, we do have 
four guys that have played a lot 
of college basketball 
 — the four 

scholarship juniors and seniors — 
but we have so many young guys 

that were thrown in there.”

The “young guys” — six players 

who logged minutes last year but 
still have three or more years of 
eligibility remaining — make up 
over 40 percent of Michigan’s 
returning minutes. Some of them, 
including 
sophomore 
guard 

Aubrey Dawkins and sophomore 
forward Ricky Doyle, showed 
flashes of brilliance last season, 
but all still have plenty of room to 
grow.

And for most of them, “room to 

grow” has a literal meaning.

Many of the returning players 

were in Ann Arbor this summer 
building muscle with strength 
and 
conditioning 
coach 
Jon 

Sanderson, 
whose 
famed 

“Camp 
Sanderson” 
program 
has 

shaped 
the 

physical 
gains 

of 
former 

Wolverines and 
current 
NBA 

players including Trey Burke, Tim 
Hardaway Jr. and Nik Stauskas.

“We 
couldn’t 
physically 

intimidate anybody last year, 
because we were just babies 
out there,” Beilein said. “Some 
of these giraffes and young 
thoroughbreds are turning into 
bigger animals, bigger people, and 
they’ve got to be able to use that 
now.”

LeVert, who has experienced 

the fruits of Camp Sanderson, 
hopes that his young teammates’ 
physical gains can make up for 
their relative lack of experience.

“Just 
the 
sophomores 
in 

general (have impressed me),” he 
said. “All those guys have made 
huge improvements in the weight 
room and on the court as well. I 
think it’ll really be an advantage 

to us playing with Duncan and 
D.J. this year, who didn’t play last 
year.”

LeVert and Walton are finally 

back to full strength, so instead of 
being thrust into starting roles too 
early, the beefed-up sophomores 
will likely find themselves coming 
off the bench.

Though 
the 
experience 

statistics may be a bit misleading 
because of last year’s chaos, 
the versatility on this year’s 
bench 
cannot 
be 
ignored. 

From Chatman to Robinson to 
sophomore guard Muhammad-
Ali Abdur-Rahkman, the bench 
will be full of players who can 
play multiple positions and have 

done 
so 
in 

game action.

“I 
think 

it’ll 
be 
an 

advantage to 
us, just the 
versatility we 
have, 
with 

a lot of guys 
such as D.J. 

or Kam or Duncan who can all 
play two to three spots,” LeVert 
said. “I think that’ll really pay 
dividends to us late in games and 
late down the stretch of the Big 
Ten season.”

Beilein may not be ready to 

call his team experienced, but he 
can take solace in the fact that 
he can turn to his bench in the 
case of an injury or late-game 
substitution without worrying 
about throwing a rookie into the 
fire.

At the same time, though, he 

knows the growing will never 
stop.

“Whether you’re here, high 

school, the pros, there’s always 
something next,” Beilein said. 
“It’s never like, ‘Hey, we made 
it.’ ”

Wolverines prepare for road games

By JASON RUBINSTEIN

Daily Sports Editor

Prior to his team’s season-

opening 
sweep 
against 

Mercyhurst, Michigan hockey 
coach Red Berenson said his 
main worry was that the Lakers 
had already played four games, 
while the Wolverines had played 
only one exhibition.

Even 
though 
Michigan 

escaped the weekend unscathed, 
Berenson can’t use that logic any 
longer as the Wolverines travel 
to upstate New York for games 
against No. 18 Union (2-0-2) and 
RPI (1-3) on Friday and Saturday, 
respectively.

“I like the fact that we came 

from behind,” Berenson said. 
“We’ll get a tougher test this 
weekend, but we got a couple of 
games under our belt. We have 
something to prove on the road. 
We weren’t very consistent last 
year.”

Winning the first two games 

already marks a change for the 
11th-ranked Wolverines (2-0). 
They began last season with a 
loss to Ferris State and then split 
a series with New Hampshire.

The quicker start this year 

could be due to a much-improved 
defensive unit. Freshmen Nick 
Boka 
and 
Joseph 
Cecconi 

have looked capable of playing 
substantial 
minutes, 
while 

junior Nolan De Jong looks like a 
completely different player after 
extensive offseason workouts.

If 
the 

Mercyhurst 
series was any 
indication, 
it 
already 

appears 
that 

Berenson 
has 

found 
four 

lines 
capable 

of scoring each 
night. Seniors 
Justin Selman 
and 
Boo 

Nieves, along with freshman 
Kyle Connor, have formed an 
imposing first line that is capable 
of scoring a goal on any given 
shift. The trio tallied a combined 
eight points in the opening 
weekend.

“Playing with Kyle is super 

easy,” Nieves 
said. 
“He 

knows what to 
do out there. 
Justin and I 
have a lot of 
chemistry off 
the ice, which 
definitely 
translates 
on 
the 
ice. 

Kyle 
listens. 

He 
absorbs 

everything, and he’s been so easy 
to play with.”

Added Berenson: “I think 

they are establishing themselves 
as a line that can score and 
shut another team’s line down. 
I thought Boo was our best 

forward 
over 
the 
weekend, 

and Kyle Connor was our most 
dangerous.”

And 
once 
you 
deal 
with 

that line, juniors Alex Kile, JT 
Compher and Tyler Motte are no 
piece of cake, either. All are high-
energy players who aggressively 
throw their bodies at open pucks, 
giving opposing units fits.

If that’s not enough, freshmen 

Cooper Marody and Brendan 
Warren 
played 
well 
beyond 

their years, combining for three 
points. The two youngsters are 
paired with sophomore Tony 
Calderone, who leads the team 
in shots with 11.

That’s three legitimate lines 

for Berenson to roll out, and 
juniors Evan Allen and Max 

Shuart 
— 
both 
fourth-line 

players — tallied a goal and an 
assist, respectively.

“We’re definitely deep this 

year,” Nieves said. “Everybody 
brings something unique which 
makes us tough to play against.”

But No. 18 Union — which 

defeated No. 8 Boston University 
earlier this year — and RPI, 
which beat No. 4 Boston College, 
present Michigan with a much 
tougher 
challenge. 
And 
the 

Wolverines know that. 

“Every game is important, 

especially these non-conference 
ones,” Nieves said. “They’ve 
definitely kept us out of the 
tournament the last few years.

“We’re 
going 
in 
with 
a 

business-type mentality.”

JAMES COLLER/Daily

Boo Nieves was Michigan’s best forward in the team’s first two games of the season, Red Berenson said.

Freshman class 
stands out early

By CHRIS CROWDER

Daily Sports Writer

Over the past year, Michigan 

women’s basketball coach Kim 
Barnes Arico and her staff 
searched near and far for some of 
the best women’s basketball talent 
in the United States. In their 
quest, the coaching staff may 
have compiled the best recruiting 
class in program history.

The Wolverines lost three 

impact seniors last season in 
forward Cyesha Goree, guard 
Shannon Smith and forward 
Nicole Elmblad, but this year’s 
freshman class is prepared, and is 
expected to make an impact right 
away.

Michigan 
originally 
had 

commitments from four players in 
the espnW 100 recruiting rankings 
— center Hallie Thome (No. 64) 
and guards Nicole Munger (No. 
68), Naomi Davenport (No. 76) and 
Lauren “Boogie” Brozoski (No. 
85). Those recruits, along with 
3-star forward Sam Trammel, 
gave the Wolverines the 14th-best 
recruiting class in the nation 
according to ESPN. Davenport, 
however, didn’t follow through on 
her November commitment, and 
is now attending Trinity Valley 
Community College in Texas.

Barnes Arico attributes the 

success in recruiting to the 
opportunities 
the 
University 

presents academically, the work 
of her assistant coaches to scour 
the country for talent and the 
identity of the program. And 
thanks to those attributes, even 
without 
Davenport, 
the 
rest 

of the freshmen bring loads of 
potential for Barnes Arico to be 
excited about.

“I really think (this class can 

be special),” Barnes Arico said. 
“They were a top recruiting class 
in the country. They’re a special 
group of kids. Freshman year is 
going to be tough. Some are going 
to be backing up, some are more 
experienced kids, so they’ll be 
getting the minutes they’ll get 
later in their career.”

Barnes Arico knows that this 

group of freshmen is unique and 
ready to handle the pressure 
of 
Division 
I 
competition. 

Compared to last year’s freshman 
class, which Barnes Arico said 
struggled at times in the first few 
weeks of practice, this year’s class 
is in shape and has bought into the 
Michigan philosophy of striving 
to be the hardest-working team in 
America. The rest of the team has 
begun to take notice as well.

“I love our freshman class,” said 

senior guard Madison Ristovski. 
“They’re super talented and bring 
a lot of energy to practice, and 
they’re always willing to learn 
and ask us questions.”

Added 
sophomore 
guard 

Katelynn Flaherty: “They don’t 
really act like freshmen — they’re 
always willing to compete and 
ready to go.”

Barnes 
Arico 
has 
already 

praised her quartet of newbies. 
She 
touts 
Brozoski’s 
(2015 

Gatorade State Player of the 
Year in New York) quickness and 
ability to handle the ball at the 
point guard position, commends 
Munger’s 
toughness, 
notes 

Trammel’s strength inside and 
leaves practice saying, ‘Oh, my 
goodness’ after seeing the 6-foot-
5 Thome (the Gatorade State 
Player of the Year in Ohio) play. 
Brozoski and Thome may be the 
two who earn the most minutes 
out of the four freshmen.

Barnes 
Arico’s 
feelings 

about Thome’s ability and the 
whole freshman class are a 
combination of excitement and 
reservation. But she knows that 
it is only their first year, and that 
she can’t think too far ahead, 
so she is focused on the present 
with the hope for the future in 
sight. Barnes Arico says she can 
get a pit in her stomach thinking 
about the possibilities, but she is 
looking forward to developing 
her players to ensure they meet 
or exceed expectations.

“They’re a special group,” 

Barnes Arico said. “By the time 
they’re juniors and seniors, I 
think they’ll do something special 
at Michigan for sure.”

Excitement builds for ‘M’

By KELLY HALL

Daily Sports Writer

At 
one 
point 
during 
a 

somewhat zany practice on 
Thursday, 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball 
coach John 
Beilein was 
doing push-ups with assistant 
coaches 
LaVall 
Jordan 
and 

Jeff Meyer at centercourt. At 
another point, a mock wrestling 
belt with a big block ‘M’ 
emblazoned on it was handed 
over to junior forward Sean 
Lonergan, who “won practice” 
the day before.

The season hasn’t started yet, 

but excitement for the upcoming 
year is already showing up 
on the practice court. After 
Thursday’s practice concluded, 
the Michigan men’s basketball 
team hit the halfway point in its 
allotted 30 days of preparation 
for the regular season. Halfway 
in, the Wolverines have more 
answers than they did 15 days 
ago, but plenty of work remains 
ahead of them.

MO 
SMILES: 
Though 

Moritz Wagner is just 18 years 
old, there has been a lot of 
talk surrounding the forward 
from Berlin, Germany. During 
the Wolverines’ open practice 
on Thursday, the freshman 
bounded up and down the court 
with a grin on his face.

“We 
just 
love 
coaching 

that kid so much and the 
teammates love him,” Beilein 
said. “Especially for a kid who’s 
18 years old and from a foreign 
country, learning the English 
language on the fly. I can’t think 
of a better transition so far.”

His progress as a college 

student in a foregin country has 
been incredible, but he’s still in 
transition on the court.

At 
times, 
he 
shows 

flashes of athleticism. Other 

times, 
he 
looks 
downright 

awkward. 
Beilein 
is 
still 

impressed, mentioning that he 
unexpectedly 
denied 
senior 

guard Caris LeVert the ball in 
practice, but later explained 
to his coach that it would have 
been a bad mismatch for LeVert. 
According to Beilein, that type 
of two-steps ahead thinking 
showedcased 
Wagner’s 

impressive basketball IQ. 

“We’re trying to teach him 

two positions,” Beilein said. 
“At 6-foot-10 and a half, he 
can play inside or he can play 
in the middle. (He) just hasn’t 
shown that physical ability to 
rebound yet. He will. He’s really 
a talented young man.”

WEIGHT WATCHERS: It’s 

impossible to note the advances 
Michigan has made in the 
offseason without mentioning 
weight gain and lean muscle 
mass. Most of the Wolverines 
stayed in Ann Arbor over the 
summer to train, so it’s no 
surprise that some players have 
put on 20 pounds of muscle.

For Wagner, the adjustment 

to American food and weight 
lifting made an impact right 
away. He made the jump from 
211 to 228 pounds over the 
course of three months.

“Sandman 
(strength 
and 

conditioning 
coach 
Jon 

Sanderson) really got (Wagner) 
on a good program gaining 
weight,” said freshman Brent 
Hibbitts, Wagner’s roommate. 
“He hadn’t really lifted much 
back in Europe, so once he 
started here and got a hang 
of all the lifts, he really saw 
improvements.”

Beilein has noticed gains 

on both sides of the ball for 
sophomore forward D.J. Wilson, 
but his growth is affecting his 
play as well.

“He’s 235 (pounds) now, and 

he’s trying to play at 235 instead 

of trying to play like he’s still 
190,” Beilein said. “When you 
grow up that long and you’re 
170, 180, 190, and all of a sudden 
you’re 235, there’s some habits 
you have that he’s trying to 
change so he can use that hard 
work he’s done for a year in the 
weight room.”

Fellow sophomore forward 

Ricky Doyle hasn’t put on quite 
as much weight, but he has 
readjusted his muscle mass.

“He came in country strong,” 

Beilein said. “He didn’t lift 
a lot of weights, but he was 
still strong walking in the 
door. I think one of his bigger 
issues was to just change the 
muscle mass and make it more 
productive as opposed to just 
having 250 pounds. … He’s 
probably in the best condition 
he’s been in.”

Rounding 
out 
the 
group 

is redshirt sophomore guard 
Duncan Robinson. Robinson 
sat out last season due to NCAA 
transfer rules, so he had more 
time and energy to focus on 
conditioning throughout the 
year.

“I would say that a lot of (my 

improvements) are physically,” 
Robinson said. “I put on about 
20 pounds, which is pretty big. 
I’ve been working with Coach 
Sanderson a lot, which has 
been big for me. Just adjusting 
to speed and the physicality of 
play.”

ZAK 
IS 
BACK: 
Beilein 

confirmed that junior forward 
Zak Irvin will be back shooting 
on Friday. After having minor 
back surgery in early September 
that was expected to keep him 
out for six to eight weeks, he’s 
right on schedule.

In open practice Thursday, 

Irvin participated in passing 
drills, but had a bigger role 
encouraging 
his 
teammates 

throughout scrimmages.

Wolverines look to make 
most of bye-week timing

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

Michigan football players have 

seen and been through a lot since 
they stepped on campus, since 
coach Jim Harbaugh was hired 
last December, even since the start 
of the season seven weeks ago.

But none of them — nor anyone 

outside the program — had ever 
seen anything like what happened 
Saturday night.

By now, the final play that 

lifted Michigan State to a 27-23 
win over the Wolverines at 
Michigan Stadium is famous. 
Michigan will have to move on 
from that and play five more 
games — but it won’t get the 
chance this weekend, with a bye 
week between now and next 
Saturday’s game at Minnesota.

The off week could let the 

sour taste from last weekend’s 
loss linger for a few more days, 
but it could also allow the 
Wolverines to heal physically 
before heading into the back half 
of their schedule.

“It’s a good and a bad thing, 

because you get to rest your bodies 
for a whole week, and you’re just 
focusing on one team for two 
weeks,” said junior running back 
De’Veon Smith. “Yeah, you want to 
get the taste out of your mouth, but 
in a way it’s a good thing, because 

we can go back and look at all of 
our mistakes and correct them all.”

In the past, the effects of bye 

weeks have worked both ways. 
Last year, Michigan lost coming 
out of both — including a 35-11 loss 
to Michigan State — but in 2013, 
the Wolverines recovered from an 

ugly seven-turnover performance 
at Notre Dame to cruise past 
Purdue, 44-13.

But because of the circumstances 

of last Saturday’s game, they have 
never had to bounce back in quite 
the same way. Minnesota (1-2 Big 
Ten, 4-3 overall), also has a bye 
Saturday after a loss, albeit a less 
dramatic one.

“Our group’s glad that we 

got the off week,” said Golden 
Gophers coach Jerry Kill on 
Tuesday on the Big Ten coaches’ 
teleconference. “We gotta get 
some bodies healed up, and 
we’ve been banged up pretty 
good, so we’re hoping this week 
allows us to heal up and start the 
preparation for Michigan.”

The Wolverines will make a 

similar effort by taking Thursday, 
Friday and Saturday off this 
weekend, giving the players a 
chance to go home or relax in Ann 
Arbor. They did, however, have 
practice Tuesday and Wednesday, 
perhaps to avoid a hangover after 
the devastating loss.

When Michigan goes back to 

work next week, it will focus on 
fine-tuning the details. Those 
details looked as sharp as they 
could be when the Wolverines won 
five straight games and shut out 
three consecutive opponents, but 
the team pointed to small issues in 
the loss to Michigan State.

“When you’re blowing teams 

out, when you’re shutting teams 
out, winning by 30 points, I 
feel like there’s a little bit more 
leniency,” said fifth-year senior 
offensive 
lineman 
Graham 

Glasgow. “I feel like it’s like, ‘Hey, 
you got the job done, but just step 
with the right foot next time.’

“Now it’s really serious. I’m 

taking it very seriously. A lot of the 
upperclassmen are. You just can’t 
make mistakes anymore.”

Yes, a Big Ten title chase is still 

within reach. But the Wolverines’ 
backs are up against the wall.

“Anything 
can 
happen 
to 

any other team that we play,” 
Smith said. “Our dreams are 
still alive of winning the Big 
Ten championship, so that’s our 
focus.”

De’Veon Smith believes the timing of Michigan’s bye week will be beneficial.
