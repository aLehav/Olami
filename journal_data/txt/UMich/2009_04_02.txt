THE RECESSION'S IMPACT ON CAMPUS
C eman: helped by downturn

Students reported
confusion, delays
after fire caused
full evacuation
By JENNA SKOLLER
Daily StaffReporter
After a fire broke out in West
Quad last week, causing a full
evacuation of the building, resi-
dents reported a general sense of
confusion as they were displaced
for several hours in the wee hours
of Thursday morning.
In looking at the University's
emergencyresponse,PeterLogan,
a spokesman for University Hous-
ing, said the evacuation ran rela-
tively smoothly. But, he said, the
residence staff is working to see
how the handling of a similar
situation could be improved in
the future.
"We're in the process of ask-
ing ourselves what could we do
differently to make things a little
more fluid or expedient for the
students," he said. "But in reflec-
tion on this event, we did pretty
well, I think, in terms of handling
the emergency.
"The most important thing
is to get the students out of the
building when there is the threat
of harm," he continued. "And we
were happy that the suppression

system worked and there were no
injuries."
However, he added: "There
was a lot of inconvenience, we
acknowledge that."
Logan said the residence
staff in West Quad has already
discussed the issue of whether
they should have anticipated or
handled the situation better. He
added thatsome of the University
Housing directors will engage in
further discussion in the next few
days.
After the evacuation at about
1:30 a.m. last Thursday morn-
ing, students were evacuated to
the South Quad cafeteria and the
South Quad Community Learn-
ing Center on the ninth floor.
Once there, resident advisers and
other West Quad residence staff
alerted residents of the situation,
Logan said.
Business sophomore Morgan
Williams, a West Quad resident,
said she did not hear any informa-
tion directly from housing staff,
which she said made the situation
more confusing.
"I didn't realize it was goingto
be three or four hours," she said.
LSA sophomore- Kara Kime,
another West Quad resident,
said she did not think the
residents were debriefed well
enough right after they were
told to evacuate.
"I think it could have been a

Others say economy
not the reason for
more research funds

Many businesses are feeling the
pinch in the current recession, but
University President Mary Sue

Coleman said the sour economy has
actually presented opportunities to
the University that may not have
otherwise existed.
Speaking in an exclusive inter-
view on Tuesday, Coleman said
although the University has been
negatively affected by the economic
downturn, the dark economic situ-
ation has also contributed to a high-
er rate of research partnerships.
"I think this is an opportunity

for us," Coleman said of the reces-
sion. "As a consequence of this,
we're finding entities that want to
partner with us that if we were in
flush economic times wouldn't."
These programs like the GM/
UM Advanced Battery Coalition
for Drivetrains, a partnership
between General Motors and the
University to develop advanced
batteries, bring more money and
more opportunities for faculty and

students to campus, she said.
According to an annual report
given to the Board of Regents by
Vice President for Research Ste-
phen Forrest earlier this year, the
University's research funding
has jumped to $876 million, an
increase of 6.4 percent from last
year.
Business contributions toward
research have also seen an increase

FROM THE BATTLEFIELD TO THE CLASSROOM
Proposal would give student vets in-state tuition

In Lansing, students
say plan would help
state's economy
By DEVON THORSBY
Daily StaffReporter
In a testimony before state sena-
tors yesterday, University student
veterans pushed for the state to

charge veterans who attend public
universities in Michigan in-state
tuition rates no matter where they
are from originally.
The proposal - which was put
forth by members of national stu-
dent organization Student Veterans
of America - aims to take advan-
tage of a stipulation in the G.I. Bill
that was passed last year. The bill
states that the federal government
will pay the cost of in-state tuition

for any veteran of the wars in Iraq
and Afghanistan.
In Lansing yesterday, student
veterans made the argument that
by passing their proposal, the fed-
eral money allocated in the GI Bill
will be pumped in Michigan's ailing
economy.
"By encouraging all veterans
to pursue their educations in our
state, we will ensure the train-
ing necessary for the workforce of

Michigan's future, all on the feder-
al government's dime," wrote LSA
senior Carl Ireland, wrote in the
proposal. Ireland is the legislative
director of SVA's Michigan chapter.
The five-point proposal includ-
ed in-state tuition for all student
veterans of the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan, providing on-campus
services for veterans to help with
the transition from active duty to
campus life, increased credit trans-

fers from military training and a
relaxation of application deadlines
and fees for veterans.
By providing in-state tuition
rates to student veterans, the pro-
posal, hopes to encourage a greater
number of student veterans to apply
to Michigan public universities,
routing the federal money avail-
able for student veteran tuition into
Michigan's economy.
In an interview after the hear-

ing, Co-founder and President
of Student Veterans of America
Derek Blumke, an LSA senior, dis-
cussed the importance of audit-
ing credit transfers for military
training, which is included in the
proposal and is something that
the University currently does not
allow.
"Things like the leadership
training we've received in military

'U' scientists find
saltwater on Mars

In three houses, Baits

A NATURAL REACTION

Water had only been
found in the form of
ice and water vapor
before discovery
By STEPHANIE STEINBERG
Daily StaffReporter
Mars may be one step closer to
sustaining life.
Nilton Renno, professor of
Atmospheric, Oceanic and Space
Sciences and co-investigator of the
Phoenix Mars Mission, along with
a group of University of Michigan
scientists have recently discovered
the presence of liquid salt water on
Mars - a new discovery given that
water was heretofore only believed
to be on the red planet in the form

of ice and water vapor.
The discovery was made from
images taken by NASA's Mars
Phoenix Lander - aspacecraft that
landed on May 25,2008.
Liquid water is the essential
ingredient for life, and while no
organisms have been found on
Mars, the evidence of liquid water
is a major scientific discovery.
"This is the first time that liquid
water has been seen anywhere out-
side our own planet," Renno said.
Manish Mehta, a graduate
student in the department of
Atmospheric, Oceanic and Space
Sciences,worked withRennoonthe
mission. Mehta performed experi-
ments to determine the amount of
soil Phoenix was going to lift from
Mars' surface upon landing.

'U' Housing hopes
change will make
residence hall
more welcoming
By VALIANT LOWITZ
DailyStaffReporter
It's not uncommon for incom-
ing freshmen students to dread
the prospect of living on North
Campus during their first year
- most notably the Vera Baits
housing complex.
Equipped with a new set of
plans, University housingis hop-
ing to change that opinions.
Beginning in the fall semester
of 2009, the Cross, Conger and
Coman houses in Baits II will be
designated strictly as freshman-
only housing.

The decision came as aresult
of comments from freshman
students currently living in
Baits, according to Univer-
sity Housing Spokesman Peter
Logan.
Generally, many first-year
students have complained
about living in the Baits
Houses, noting that the resi-
dence hall isn't conducive to
the transition into college life,
according to Logan. He added,
however, that the switch to all
freshman housing "may suc-
ceed in changing perceptions"
about living in Baits.
"This is an effort to provide
more community building for
freshman in the Baits houses,"
he said.
Not all students, though,
have negative feelings about the
Baits houses. Joanna Smulska, a

Harmonious History

Although its first pro-
fessor was appointed in
1880, the School of Music
was created in 1892 and
unofficially existed until
1929, when it was estab-
lished as a part ofthe Uni-
versity, according to "The
University of Michigan,
A Photographic Saga."
In 1893, the School of
Music Building Associa-
tion, formed by a group of
Ann Arbor citizens, raised
enough funds to purchase
a site at 325 Maynard St.,
according to the book. In
1905, University students
began to receive credit
for courses taken at the
school.
By 1929 the school
outgrew its Maynard
location. Low-quality
acoustics in many of the

rooms meant that recit-
als had to be held in bor-
rowed locations, and due
to high demand, the recit-
als had to be planned one
year in advance, accord-
ing to the book. In 1936,
the school moved to a
new site on Ingalls Mall,
whose proximity to Hill
Auditorium made it a
suitable site for rehears-
als and performances.
But by 1946, the School
of Music once again suf-
fered from a lack of space
and resources, according
to the book. Instruments
were frequently stored in
faculty offices, the library
had only 28 seats, and
practice rooms were lim-
ited. Due to the lack of
space, the school decided
to freeze enrollment at

600 students.
In the 1960s, the Uni-
versity received state
funds to construct a new
building for the school
on North Campus. The
commission was given
to Finnish architect Eero
Saarinen, and the North
Campus Music School
Building was completed
in 1963, according to the
book.
The school now boasts
171 practice rooms, 21
classrooms, 46 studios for
teaching, 25 faculty offic-
es, two rehearsal halls, a
library, audition studios
and recording rooms.
In 2006, the School of
Music was renamed the
School of Music, Theatre
& Dance.

Federal authorities seized dis-

vintage yacht and a smaller boat
from two Florida marinas early
Wednesday, part of an effort to
recoup assets to pay back his swin-
dled investors.
The 55-foot yacht named "Bull"
and a 24-foot motor boat were
taken from marinas on Florida's
east coast, said Barry Golden, a
spokesman for the U.S. Marshals
Service. The yacht, a 1969 Rybo-

"A lot of money was put into
maintaining this boat," said Gold-
en. "This boat was extremely well
kept, extremely clean. Engine com-

4,000 protestors gather in
London's financial district

Clean-up added

More than 30

i

people arrested on,
eve of G20 summit
LONDON (AP) - Chanting G-20
protesters clashed withriot police in
central London on yesterday, over-
whelming police lines, vandalizing
the Bank of England and smashing
windows at the Royal Bank of Scot-
land. An effigy of a banker was set
ablaze, drawing cheers.
More than 30 people were
arrested after some 4,000 anar-
chists, anti-capitalists, environ-
mentalists and others clogged
London's financial district for
what demonstrators branded
"Financial Fool's Day." The pro-
tests were called ahead of today's
Group of20 summitofworld lead-
ers, who hope to take concrete
steps to resolve the global finan-
cial crisis that has lashed nations
and workers worldwide.
The protests in London's finan-
cial district - known as "The
City" - began as Prime Minis-
ter Gordon Brown and President
Barack Obama held a news con-
ference at Britain's Foreign Min-
istry elsewhere in the capital.
A battered effigy of a banker
in a bowler's hat hung on a traf-
fic light near the Bank of England

training seem like they should
transfer," he said. "Leadership is
something that the University of
Michigan prides itself on."
Blumke stated that the main
purpose of the proposal is to ease
the shift from active duty to uni-
versity life for student veterans.
He added that the bill will aid
Michigan's economy by attract-
ing student veterans to the state
to attend school.
"We want to help our friends
come home and not have to
deal with the obstacles that
we've had to face," Blumke said.
"We want to help them make a
smooth transition to college and
help the'Michigan economy at
the same time."
Michigan Student Assembly

"Resistance is Fertile," and "Make
Love not Leverage."
Bankers have been lambasted
as being greedy and blamed for
the recession that is making job-
less ranks soar. Other banners
read "Banks are evil" and "Eat the
bankers," and "0 percent interest
in others." Some bankers went
to work in casual wear yesterday
fearing they could be targeted.
Some bolder financial workers
leaned out office windows, taunt-
ing the demonstrators and waving
10 pound notes at them. Two men
- one wearing a suit - exchanged
punches before police intervened.
Groups of protesters converged
on the central bank, with Tibetan,
Palestinian, communist, and anar-
chist flags poking out from the
crowd. Tensions rose as officers
refused to let the protesters leave
the small plaza in front of the bank.
Protesters pelted police stand-
ing guard at the Royal Exchange
with paint, eggs, fruit and other
projectiles, and a small group
of anarchists, skinheads, and
masked protesters repeatedly
attacked a police cordon flanking
the Bank of England.
Some in the crowd urinated
against the bank and the message
"Built on blood" was scrawled
in chalk in front of the building.
Police helicopters hovered above.
A particularly ferocious bala-
President Abhishek Mahanti
attended the Senate hearing in
Lansing to support the student
veterans' proposal. Mahanti, an
Engineering junior, expressed his
desire to encourage veterans to
attend the University, as well as
the University's need to accom-
modate student veterans.
"There is a need for student
veterans on campus and a need
to make them feel welcome," he
said. "These are the people who
will be our future politicians
and the leaders of our nation
because of their service to the
country."
After returning from Lansing,
Mahanti and Blumke said they
both had an overwhelmingly
positive feeling about the pro-
posal hearing.
- From an observer's stand-
point, Mahanti noted the student
veterans' preparedness and orga-

clava-wearing mob broke into
a closed RBS bank branch and
stole keyboards, using them to
break windows. Other protesters
spray-painted graffiti on the RBS
building, writing"Class War" and
"Thieves." Mounted riot police
eventually pushed them back.
RBS has been the focus of par-
ticular anger because it was bailed
outbythe British government after
a series of disastrous deals brought
it to the brink of bankruptcy. Still,
its former chief executive Fred
Goodwin - age 50 - managed to
walk off with an annual pension
of 703,000 pounds ($1.2 million)
even as unemployment in Britain
rises from some 2 million.
"Every job I apply for there's
already 150 people who have also
applied," said protester Nathan
Dean, 35, who lost his informa-
tion technology job three weeks
ago. "I have had to sign on to the
dole (welfare) for the first time in
my life. You end up having to pay
your mortgage on your credit card
and you fall into debt twice over."
There were surreal moments:
Earlier in the morning, police
impounded an armored person-
nel carrier - complete with what
looked like a machine-gun turret
- near London's Liverpool Street
Station as slack-jawed office
workers took pictures with their
cell phones.
nization as a strong point to the
proposal hearing.
"They laid it all out for the
senators to just take under their
wing," he said.
Blumke was also encouraged
by the meeting and said he hopes
to see the proposal realized by
August of this year.
"I don't think it could have
gone any better," he said. "The
state senators were all really
supportive and wanted to know
more about what universities
we're approaching."
Blumke isn't new to Lan-
sing, he's testified there before
in hopes of getting the G.I. Gill
passed.
According to statistics in the
proposal, the University current-
ly ranks ninth in the Big Ten in
the number of student veterans
enrolled in classes, with only 48
enrolled at the University.

lot better in the beginning, because
a lot of people didn't believe there
was really anything going on," she
said. "We heard everything through
the grapevine kind of in the begin-
ning, but then the RAs came and
notified us."
Logan said there is some dif-
ficulty with communication dur-
ing any emergency because of
the necessity to take care of the
situation at hand before notify-
ing affected individuals of the
situation. He also said it was dif-
ficult to contact all of the residents
involved because many chose to
leave the evacuation sites.
"There is the issue that we don't
always know what's going on in a
timely basis," he said, "because in
an emergency the first thing to do
is deal with the emergency, so I do
know that there were students who
were unhappy."
The students were allowed back
into their rooms sometime between
3 a.m. and 4 a.m., depending on
where they lived within West Quad,
Logan said.
Department of Public Safety
spokeswoman Diane Brown said
multiple steps had to be taken
before students were allowed back
into the building even after the
fire was put out. And because the
fire was an arson, West Quad was
determined as a crime scene where
police interviews and fingerprint-
ing had to be taken.
In addition to the crime scene

investigation, the waiting time
was augmented by the need for
an air quality test before resi-
dents were permitted to re-enter
the building. Brown said the Uni-
versity takes the fire marshal's
OK a step further, waiting extra
time to ensure the safety of the
building.
"The University administration
has a set of stronger responsibili-
ties for students, staff and faculty,"
Brown said. "The administration
wants to go that one step further
to ensure that buildings really have
good air quality, etc. in order to be
reoccupied."
The sprinkler system also con-
tributed to the wait delays, Brown
said. Though the fire was on the
lowest level of West Quad, which
she said made it easier to contain,
there was still water damage to
about 20 rooms that had to be miti-
gated.
"You can't stop the sprinkler
system," Brown said. "That whole
portion of the piping system has to
drain out, so even if the fire is put
out very quickly, a lot of water still
comes down."
Logan said he has not heard of
a lot of criticism from the students
who were displaced once they re-
entered the residence hall.
"It was something nobody
wanted to have happen, and it
is disturbing that this was an
arson," he said. "But after the
event, it seems that we're not
getting a lot of criticism from the
students."

Back under control
Drug companies should re-offer discounted birth control
Despite the Bush administration's best efforts, forcing drug
companies to raise the price of birth control at college
health clinics did not stop college students from having
sex. All it did was make obtaining birth control more difficult and
expensive. Thankfully, the passage of President Barack Obama's
stimulus package removes the impediments that companies faced
in offering college students discounted birth control. The rever-
sal of President George Bush's backward policies should come as
a relief to students nationwide. But just removing the penalties for
offering discounts doesn't necessarily mean that the prices will
drop again. Drug companies should seize upon this opportunity to
provide affordable birth control once again by reinstating the dis-

Putting preventionfirst

counts Bush had eliminated.
InJanuary2007,the Bushadministration
passed the Deficit Reduction Act, which
penalized drug manufacturers for offering
discounted birth control to universities. To
take advantage of the discount for as long
as possible, the University Health Service
stocked up on the popular birth control
Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo. But UHS's supply ran
out in September 2008 and the price subse-
quently doubled. Wherever possible, UHS
encouraged patients to switch to generic
equivalents, but for some students that
wasn't a viable or smart option.
Thankfully, Obama's stimulus package
removes the penalties. It did not, however,
require the manufacturers to return to the
old discounts. This step has been left up to
the companies.
It's an encouraging development to see
the Bush policy overturned. Penalizing
those who offered cheaper contraception
to college-aged women was an under-
handed way of trying to stop college kids
from having sex. In the eyes of the Bush
administration, the best way to encourage
abstinence was to make birth control pro-
hibitively expensive.
But making birth control harder to buy

doesn't mean that students will stop hav-
ing sex. Many college-aged kids choose to
engage in sexual activity and no amount of
legislation is going to seriously impact this.
All the policy accomplished was decreased
access to birth control - a woman's best
option for preventing unplanned pregnan-
cies.An infringementuponthischoice means
an infringement upon a woman's reproduc-
tive rights, and the government was wrong
to abridge access to birth control.
In order to cope with the higher prices,
many students who couldn't afford to pay
more for birth control switched to a generic
version. But not every type or brand comes
in a generic form, and not every woman
should be taking a generic brand. No two
bodies are exactly the same. Every woman
should have the opportunity to use the
best birth control for her body, and every
woman deserves to be able to make that
choice independently of prohibitive gov-
ernment regulations.
With this policy finally eliminated, it's
time for drug companies to restore the dis-
counted prices so that all college students
can afford to do what they want with their
own bodies.

Perhaps the most comprehensive
measure of sexual health policy
currently proposed is the Pre-
ventionFirstAct.An
ambitious measure
that is nine bills tied
into one, the major
aims of the Preven-
tion First Act are to
reduce unintended 1
pregnancies, reduce
the number of abor-
tions and reduce theR
spread of sexually ROSE
transmitted infec- AFRIYIE
tions.
The act repre-
sents the closest thing to a compromise
on the polarized abortion debate we
have seen in a long time. It also cuts
costs and allows us to walk the talk on
restoring scientific integrity in govern-
ment.
The debate on reproductive rights
remains stalemated with pro-life advo-
cates on the right and pro-choice advo-
cates on the left. But the introduction
of the Prevention First Act in 2007 by
both pro-life and pro-choice represen-
tatives marked a shift in the conversa-
tionthat directed political will towards
prevention and, by extension, to con-
traception. Because of this bill, there
is a growing coalition of social liberals,
moderates and even some conserva-
tives in agreement about prevention
measures.
According to public opinion polls in
a 2005 Guttmacher Institute report,
"Promoting Prevention to Reduce the
Need for Abortion: Good Policy, Good
Politics," Americans want the govern-
ment to kick back a few dollars and
finance contraception and they would
rather have the government paying for
contraception than abortion. While
I am staunchly pro-choice, I recog-
nize that prevention policy is truly the
future - and you should too.
So what about the economic aspect?
The Center for Disease Control's 2007

National Surveillance Data revealed
that managing STIs costs the U.S.
healthcare system as much as $15.3 bil-
lion annually. Congresswoman Louise
Slaughter aptly described prevention
measures like this: "For every $1 spent
on providing family planning services,
an estimated $3 is saved in Medicaid
expenditures for pregnancy-related
and newborn care." These costs rep-
resent savings in the current economic
recession.
Perhaps the restoration of scientific
integrity is the most compelling argu-
ment. On Mar. 9, President Barack
Obama signed an executive order that
reinforced scientific integrity in poli-
cymaking. It's hard to believe that we
are only four months removed from a
presidency that languished in religious
dogma to make decisions about sexual
health policy. Obama's deferral to the
scientific community impacts policy
implementation on multiple levels.
Namely, it implies that we have already
arrived at the point where medically
accurate information in public school
sex education programs should be the
standard. But the Prevention First Act
is needed to fully link scientific integ-
rity to an institutionalized standard
of disseminating medically accurate
information at all levels of reproduc-
tive health.f
While this act is hawkish about
reducing unintended pregnancies and
abortions, it is arguably timid on the
scourge of STIs. This is largely because
prevention efforts toward STIs have
been widely synonymous with con-
dom distribution and have lacked
political will. In truth, when the term
contraception is used in the bill, it dis-
proportionately refers to methods of
prescriptive contraception and forms
of emergency contraception. This is a
one-sided approach to combating the
multiple public health challenges that
are a result of uninformed sexual deci-
sion-making and a lack of insurance
coverage.

As such, while condom distribution
lacks political traction, provisions in
the act should invest financial capital
in the research and development of
accurate STI tests and vaccinations for
both men and women. We should be
reminded that no test or vaccine exists
for human papillomavirusinmen, even

though they can carry and transmit
strands that cause cervical cancer. A
few weeks ago, I talked about the shod-
dy nature of herpes blood tests and the
fact that they can be as low as 50 per-
cent accurate. Policies should address
this not only with lip service but also
with financial assistance.
Provisions in the act should man-
date research and development in STI
testing, insurance coverage for STI
testing and vaccination. It's not just at
the University Health Service, where
the, HPV vaccine costs ,a total of $500
and the lab work for certain tests can
amount to hundreds of dollars. This is a
national problem, and these costs must
be subsidized to depart from the dis-
ease care system of today and embark
on the preventative health care system
of tomorrow.

More guidance for graduates

Over-educating the workforce

High quality doctoral education at the Uni-
versity of Michigan is a source of enormous
institutional pride for Ph.D. students, faculty
and the University. As proud as we are of our
many successes, we are still troubled by the
fact that only two-thirds of the Ph.D. students
who begin doctoral study actually receive their
degrees from the University.
The Rackham Graduate School believes this
number could and should be higher.
In partnership with school and college grad-
uate programs, we are pursuing a number of
practices and policies designed to improve the
institutional support Ph.D. students receive
as they work toward degree completion. The
new continuous enrollment policy, which will
require programs to register all Ph.D. students
for fall and winter terms beginningin Fall 2010,
is one such effort. The proposed policy will
provide substantial benefits to students and
their programs, including year-round, uninter-
rupted access to University services.
The policy will also require that graduate
programs regularly confirm that students are
making good progress toward their degrees
and provide an opportunity for programs to
address obstacles and offer support to stu-
dents. Most importantly, the policy fosters
strong connections between students and their
program or department. Research shows - and
student surveys echo - that these are critical
factors in students' successes.
Development of the new policy occurred
over the last two years and benefited greatly
from numerous conversations and meetings
with students, faculty, program directors and
chairs. The first step toward implementation
occurred on Dec. 10, 2008 with the approval of
the Rackham Executive Board. The next step
will occur this summer when the schools and
colleges identify funding to pay tuition for the
additional terms of registration required by the
policy so that students won't have to pay more
tuition. Identifying funding is one prerequisite
for policy implementation.
As we move ahead with plans to put this
policy into effect in the Fall 2010 semester,

there are several objectives that must be met.
We recognize that Ph.D. students must pur-
sue their research in Ann Arbor and abroad as
necessitated by their individual scholarship.
We will ensure that funding is in place for the
University to pay tuition for students making
good progress and whose scholarly work takes
them away from Ann Arbor.
Funding must be in place to support stu-
dents in those fields of study - like Near East-
ern Studies and Anthropology - that require
extensive fieldwork or language study, as well
as for fields of study in which Ph.D. students
complete their degrees more rapidly.
We want to be clear that the faculty mem-
bers who know the students and their work
will be the ones making key decisions about
students' progress. We will also ensure that
current Ph.D. students are not disadvantaged
by the transition to a new set of rules. Rack-
ham is working with each school and college to
develop a funding plan to cover these goals.
College of Engineering Dean David Munson
is confident that tuition support will be avail-
able for Ph.D. students whose tuition is not paid
by grants or fellowships. "We believe that con-
tinuous enrollment will benefit students in the
College," he said. "Funding will be available to
support students making progress to degree in
Engineering, and we are committed to provid-
ing that funding."
LSA Dean Terrence McDonald confirms that
LSA will work with Rackham and the Provost
to provide tuition support for students who are
making satisfactory progress to degree but do
not have fellowship or teaching support that
will pay their tuition. He said, "We think con-
tinuous enrollment will be good for graduate
students in LSA because it supports stronger
connections between students and their pro-
grams, and as a result more Ph.D. students will
complete their degrees." For more details on
the proposed policy see: http://www.rackham.
umich.edu/policies/continuous-enrollment/.
Peggy McCracken is the Associate Dean for
Academic Programs and Initiatives for Rackham.

This past Tuesday, Michigan state
representatives Rebekah Warren
(D-Ann Arbor) and Alma Wheeler
Smith (D-Salem)
presented a plan to
make college vir-
tually free for all
Michigan residents
attending in-state;
public colleges.
With only a couple.
ofhigh school atten-
dance and income
eligibility rules, the PATRICK
plan is a bold com- ZABAWA
mitment to ensure
all Michigan resi-
dents receive access
to higher education. The government's
desire to make higher education more
affordable certainly isn't new - as
tuition rates have risen at four times
the rate of inflation over the past 20
years, lawmakers and students alike
have been wondering if students will
be able to keep paying for college.
But for all the hype about the cost of
higher education, few are concerned
about the costs of these policies. There
are monetary costs - an income tax
rate increase of 26 percent for War-
ren and Smith's plan - but there are
also harmful effects on the job market
as a whole. And these harmful effects
could be increasing unemployment
and lowering college graduates' sala-
ries.
As a state, Michigan has had diffi-
culty retaining its college graduates.
In 2007, 35,000 college-educated
workers ages 22 to 34 left the state
while only 18,000 entered it - the
lowest ratio of any state. To counter
this exodus, the state began paying for
some college students first two years
of post-secondary education through
the Michigan Promise scholarship
in 2006. Now they're toying with the
plan to cover all residents' in-state
tuition costs.
But these plans don't seem like
they'll have an effect on the state's col-

lege-graduate mass migration. With
the horrible condition of Michigan's
economy, creating more college grad-
uates will only increase the supply of
graduates, not the demand for them,
so enabling more Michigan residents
to attend college will only enable more
Michigan residents to leave the state.
That's good for them, but bad for the
state - and the residents left behind to
pay their college bills.
Michigan's problem with an over-
supply ofcollege graduates isn'tunique
to the state - it's a growing national
concern. According to the Bureau
of Labor Statistics, 29 percent of the
workforce has a college degree but
only 24 percent of jobs require them.
And as the nation produces more than
1.5 million jobseekers with bachelor
degrees every year, this is looking like
a long-term trend. Unlike Michigan
residents, Americans in general don't
seek jobs outside their geographic
boundaries when they can't find one.
Instead, they lower their standards
and obtain jobs at which they're over-
qualified. According to the BLS, that's
the case for five percent of all work-
ers.
With this oversupply of college
graduates and the trend not looking
like it's going to end anytime soon,
it's hard to understand the benefits
of making college more accessible. It
may seem as if increasing the number
of college graduates is a good thing,
especially for those graduates. But the
oversupplymeansthatcompanieshave
a much greater number of graduates to
choose from and graduates have more
people to compete against. Graduates,
excited to receive a job requiring their
degree, will be happy to take any job
offer no matter how low the starting
salary. After all, one is a high number
when it comes to how many job offers a
post-graduate is receiving. Thislowers
the starting salaries of college gradu-
ates. And with a lower salary, students
are less able to pay back their student
loans, hurting one of the goals of high-

er-education policies in the first place.
There are those lucky few who do
receive job offers, but the discrepancy
between supply and demand means
there will be some graduates who
don't get job offers from any position
requiring a degree. So many college

graduates, as the BLS states, end up in
jobs that don't require one. Employers
are happy to hire them because they
get exemplary employees. The group
of people most affected here, though,
are those who would have received
the jobs had there not been an over-
supply of college graduates. With the
oversupply, employers canhire college
graduates when they don't actually
needthem,consequentlymakingacol-
lege degree a prerequisite for the job.
Left out of a job, these other displaced
workers need a college degree to get
one - and will need to spend tens of
thousands of dollars and years out of
work in the process. If these people
have families and bills to pay, they're
out of luck. Even worse, once out of
college, they will again displace more
workers, continuing the cycle.
So while it may seem like a good
idea for lawmakers to increase acces-
sibility to higher education, policies
aimed at improving higher-education
accessibility exasperate the problems
they seek to solve. They are harmful to
the state, the nation and even the col-
lege graduates themselves.

With the temperature in the 40s
in State College, it was the Wolver-

9-1 and 11-3.
The wins were Michigan's first
in Big Ten play.
After two losses to then-No.
14 Northwestern on the opening
weekend of Big Ten play, Michi-
gan (2-2 Big Ten, 24-9 overall) was
ninth in the conference. The two
wins put Michigan back into the
middle of the pack.
With no postseason conference
tournament for the first time since
1994, the regular-season games
are more important than in years
past.
"If we did (feel pressure), we
didn't show it," Michigan coach
Carol Hutchins said. "We can't get
caught up in the standings. Our
goal is to make it and have a deep
run into the postseason and have
a chance to get it to the (Women's

and hit a home run in the first
game, her fourth this season.
"We need that from Roya,"
Hutchins said. "She's in the RBI
slot in the lineup. We need her to
stay consistent at the plate ... how-
ever she did it, I hope she stays
with it."
After sophomore pitcher Jordan
Taylor gave up three runs in the
first inning of the second game,
Hutchins swapped one All-Amer-
ican for the other. She brought in
junior Nikki Nemitz, who won the
first game.
Nemitz went on to throw six
scoreless innings and ten strike-
outs against the Nittany Lions
(0-, 9-17).
Junior third baseman Maggie
Viefhaus picked up where St. Clair
left off in the batter's box in the
second game, going 3-for-4, driv-
ing in five runs and adding her,
fifth home run of the year.
'I've been striking out a lot late-

ly," Viefhaus said. "I was just try-
ing to put it in play and she put it
over the plate, and I got the good
part of the bat, and it went out."
Michigan will have justtwo days
to prepare before Purdue comes to
Ann Arbor for a two-game series
this weekend. The Boilermakers
are 3-1 in Big Ten play and sit at
second in the conference behind
Northwestern.
"Getting games in helps us more
than anything," Viefhaus said.
"We're at the point in the season
where you don't really need to
practice anymore. You're either on
your game or you're not."
The Wolverines will play in
their optimal weather conditions
again this weekend - the forecast
projects the temperature in the

Daryl Weinert, executive direc-
tor of the BEC, also said he wasn't
sure if the center's flurry of activ-
ity was tied to the economy, but he
echoed Forrest's comments about
the high level of research activi-
ties.
"I would actually say that our
level of inquiries from industry is
way up," he said. "I'm not sure it's
necessarily tied to the economic
situation."
Forrest said the stimulus pack-
age could also play a significant
role in future research partner-
ships.
"If we think about companies
that might team with universities
due to the stimulus package, which
is sort of a near-term burst of fund-
ing, that I suspect is going to be
really strong," he said.
Coleman said in addition to
high levels of research activ-
ity, the University has also ben-
efited from the current economic
situation through its long-term
investments, like the University's
intention to purchase the former
Pfizer Inc. complex on North
Campus.
The acquisition of the former
Pfizer facility will attract new and
highly qualified faculty and create
many more research opportunities
for faculty and students, Coleman
said.
Despite such benefits, Coleman
originally designed for graduate
students. In 2004, the residence
hall houses were opened to under-
graduate students "as the space
needs for new and returning stu-
dents increased," Logan said.
He also said students have sug-
gested having more residence
advisors to support community-
building activities and programs.
"The RAs assigned to the three
houses will have the opportu-
nity to work with the residents
in developing a more intentional
community that is focused on the
interests and needs of first-year
students," Logan said.
In regards to students who cur-
rently live in the Cross, Conger

said the current economic situa-
tion is posing great challenges to
the University but that she's trying
to make the most of it.
"There's a silver lining to every-
thing," she said. "I don't think it's
great we have this tough economic
time, but I'm also not going to sit
around and mope about it."
Coleman said to take full advan-
tage of the situation, she plans to
make the University a source of
good news for Michigan.
"I'm really energized to try to
help and do something to really
have the University be a beacon,"
she said. "You go around the
country and people think, 'Well,
Michigan is falling apart.' It has
troubles but it's not falling apart
as a state."
Coleman said one of the reasons
the University isn't as negatively
affected bythe economy is because
the University has experience cop-
ing with tough economic times.
"We're kind of battle tested at
this, because we've been having
to do it for seven years," she said.
"I think that's one of the things
that distinguishes us a little bit
from places in other states where
they're facing this shock for the
first time."

MARS
From Page 1A
found Phoenix would remove Mars'
topsoil and expose a deeper layer
of the planet's surface. This would
melt any ice on the topsoil, causing
the mixture of soil and melted ice
to splash around the lander.
Renno said after Phoenix landed
theteamstartedtakingimages from
under the lander to figure out if the
spacecraft removed the soil like
Mehta had suggested. And itdid.
"It was a huge surprise," Renno
said. "That was one of the great
moments of the mission to find out
the ice was completely exposed
under the lander."
After analyzing images from
the lander, the researchers noticed
one of the lander's legs contained
moving particles. Renno said the
particles "looked very strange"
when he first saw the image.
"It looked like something had
splashed there,"he said. "We start-
ed taking images as soon as we
could to monitor what was going
on. And then to my surprise, after
three images, I noticed that some
of those particles were growing."
The researchers then took more
images, which showed some of the
particles were not only growing, but
moving as well. Renno said this was
surprising because particles only
move if they are in a liquid state.
Because scientists previously
believed water only existed on
Mars in the form of ice or water
vapor, Renno was doubtful the
particles were moving in liquid.
He said he thought liquid water
could not exist on Mars because
the planet's cold temperatures
would cause the liquid to freeze.

Thursday, April 2, 2009 - 7A
After monitoring the lander a
few more days, Renno hypoth-
esized that salt in Mars' soil pro-
hibited some areas of the planet's
surface from freezing, allowing
water to exist in a liquid state.
WhenPhoenix returned to Earth
Nov.10,2008,researchers analyzed
the soil collected from the lander.
What they discovered proved
Renno's hypothesis correct.
"We found out that the soil
had lots of perchlorate - that are
very powerful anti-freeze (salts),"
Renno said. "We found out we
could have liquid saline water at
a temperature even lower than we
had described."
The perchlorate salts found in
Mars' soil freeze in temperatures
of -90 to -105 degrees Fahrenheit.
The average temperature where
Phoenix landed was -75 degrees
Fahrenheit, proving the salts kept
the water from freezing.
This discovery has led some
scientists to believe liquid water
may exist in other areas on Mars'
surface and has spurred NASA to
further investigate the presence of
water on the planet.
Despitethebreakthroughdiscov-
erysomeresearchers are hesitantto
say that the saltwater found on Mars
directly indicates the possibility
of life there. Jasper Kok, graduate
student in the department of Atmo-
spheric, Oceanic and Space Scienc-
es, contributed to the discovery by
calculatingthe size and growth rate
of the particles on Phoenix's leg.
He said he does not believe the
finding proves life can exist on
Mars even though "liquid water is
tied to life."
"(Mars) has such ahigh salt con-
tent that the implications for life
might make it difficult," he said.

For Friday, April 3, 2009
AR IES
(March 21 to April 19)
Don't quit your day job today. Be
careful how you react to parents, bosses,
teachers and authority figures. It's easy
to do something rash that you might later
regret.
TAURUS
(April 20 to May 20)
Something inside you makes you feel
easily upset about things today. It's just a
feeling you have. Don't give into it. It
will pass in a day or so.
GEMINI
(May 21 to June 20)
Friends and even casual acquaintances
might be difficult to deal with today.
Feelings of jealousy or competition
could be a factor. Emotions are exagger-
ated right now.
CANCER
(June 21to July 22)
It's easy to overreact to something that
someone in a position of authority says
or does today. (This could be a parent,
boss, teacher or VIP or even the police.)
Keep your cool!
LEO
(July 23 to Aug. 22)
No matter how passionately you feel
about an issue related to religion, politics
or education, pull in your reins a little
today. Don't overreact to things. Later,
you'll be glad you remained calm.
VIRGO
(Aug. 23 to Sept. 22)
Upsetting discussions about shared
property, inheritances or insurance mat-
ters could take place today. People are
emotionally intense today, iocluding
you. (Perhaps you should zip your lip?)
LIBRA
(Sept. 23 to Oct. 22)
Avoid arguments with family mem-
bers and partners about anything today.
People are obsessed about things.
Rational, reasonable discussions are

impossible. (You get the picture.)
SCORPIO
(Oct. 23 to Nov. 21)
Don't quarrel with co-workers about
anything today. You won't win, and you
won't persuade others to agree with you
anyway. There are none so deaf as those
who are wearing headphones.
SAGITTARIUS
(Nov. 22 to Dec. 21)
Parents and caregivers must be patient
with children today. Everyone is quite
emotional, and children will feel this too.
Don't make a big deal about things.
CAPRICORN.
(Dec. 22 to Jan. 19)
Do whatever you can to avoid family
arguments or disagreements with rela-
tives today. Compulsive feelings plus
jealousy can cloud your mind. Don't
even go there! Keep smiling.
AQUARIUS
(Jan. 20 to Feb. 18)
You want something so much today,
you're forgetting about the big picture.
Try to keep things in perspective. Don't
let your emotions overrun you.
PISCES
(Feb. 19to March 20)
You passionately want to buy some-
thing today or do something related to
your cash flow. Just make sure you know
what you're doing. Avoid compulsions.
YOU BORN TODAY You have a
quiet, gentle unassuming quality that
masks your fierce determination to over-
come all obstacles and odds to achieve
whatever you want. You have a good
understanding of human nature at its
most basic level. On the whole, you are
easygoing and good-natured. At times,
you have an almost childlike innocence.
In the year ahead, you will have to make
an important choice. Choose wisely.

AFTER A WILDLY SUCCESSFUL OPENING WEEKEND, THE UNIVERSITY'S
NEWLY RENOVATED MUSEUM OF ART IS READY TO PROVIDE CAMPUS WITH
ITS WORLD-CLASS COLLECTION. BY KATIE CAREY, DAILY ARTS WRITER

THE EXTENT OF ARTWORK at the corner of State
Street and South University Avenue over the past
three years has been limited to the large orange
Orion sculpture by Mark di Suvero that was
installed this fall. While it certainly was an indi-
cation of things to come, the sculpture did little
to incite conversation about art and even less to
engage audiences beyond the initial question,
"What is that thing?"
The wait has been worth it, though.
Now, over 18,000 other artworks
in the newly refurbished Uni- UMP
versity of Michigan Museum of INVI
Art join the lone sculpture on
State Street. STUDENi

attended the 24-hour opening ITS W
on Saturday, and nearly 24,000
had attended by the end of the open-
ing weekend. Within the museum, the
collection sparked a long-awaited dialogue that
has been missing on campus for the entirety of
many students' college careers.
Though students may have come for the free
food or the Zingerman's gift certificates, they
ended up staying to talk about the artwork with
their friends, ask questions about its origins and
postulate their own philosophies behind art
pieces - and these were not just typical museum-
goers, but engineers, mathematicians and people
* from all areas of study.

"We didn't want to be a museum for just artists
and art historians," UMMA Museum Director
James Steward said. "Before, the museum was an
adjunct to their studies - yet the vast majority of
students are not studyingthat. We wanted it to be
a hangout space, a place you can go to have other
types of experiences."
The events at the 24-hour opening were a
glimpse into what the museum space has to
offer. During the opening period, a trio

With future plans to make partner-

Screen Arts & Cultures program and the School
of Music, Theatre & Dance, UMMA is capitalizing
on the idea of"a meeting place for the arts."
"We're trying to express that one type or one
form of art isn't that much greater than the others
and that we can try to make some connective tis-
sue between these different types," Steward said.

. Michigan's most creative major

A new interdisciplinary
performance art program
to form at the University
By SARAH CHAVEY
Daily Arts Writer
It's a rainy Sunday evening and libraries
all over campus are filling with students
getting ready to hit the books. But in a
hallway tucked away somewhere on North
Campus, a different kind of study group is
forming.
Four students stand behind a table with
miniature costumes draped around their
necks, their hands in shoes placed flat
across the tabletop. Partners duck behind
them, lending their arms to the characters
as a woman sits in front of them all, guiding
their improvisational comedic conversa-
tions. These students are participants in a
performance art workshop, and, beginning
next semester, people interested in this art
form will have a home in the University.
This fall, Interarts will join the Univer-
sity's roster of majors, creating an area of
study for students interested in perfor-
mance art. The program will be a joint
venture between the University's School of
Art & Design and the School of Music, The-
atre & Dance, and it will grant graduates a
Bachelor of Fine Arts in Interarts Perfor-
mance. The collaboration between schools
will allow students to take advantage of
both theater and dance training in move-
ment, narrative, set and lighting design as
well as art and design training in visual
language vocabulary, experimental art and
new media technologies.
University professors and members of
the Interarts board Holly Hughes and Mal-
* colm Tulip were inspired to create a pro-
0

gram in which students could feel free to
develop their artistic voices in new, time-
based work without the constraints of the
more narrowly focused tracts offered by
the two schools.
"A program like this is for those people
who don't want to be forced to decide on a
discipline, but know that they are an artist
and want to use all the skills that they have
at their disposal," Tulip said.
Until now, most performance art cur-
ricula have been limited to graduate pro-
grams, making the new program at the
University one of the first of its kind. Not
only will the major be rare for an under-
graduate program, but it will also follow a
uniquely individualistic approach to educa-
tion. Students will choose from what Tulip
dubbed a "smorgasbord" of classes (like
playwriting, digital studio, costume design,
movement, drawing and acting classes),
and take responsibility for shaping their
own educational experience.
Such broad experience is needed in what
is a truly varied art form. Performance art
can range from monologue performances
to body art and puppetry to flash mobs.
Artists also come from a wide variety of art
backgrounds. Still, Hughes and Tulip wel-
come these challenges.
The smallsize of the program will engen-
der cohesion and allow advisors to keep a
watchful eye on each student's progress
through discussion groups like the weekly
Interarts forum.
"We'll talk about topics related to per-
formance to give people sort of a sense of,
you know, our own little clubhouse, and to
build a sense of community," Hughes said.
Students can also benefit from visiting
performers and University alumni. Pat
Olesko studied sculpture at the University
in the late '64s and came to performance
art after one particular project made her

The University's Interarts program is one of the few undergraduate performance art concentrations in the country.

realize how useful her body could be in
conveying her ideas.
"I started hanging things on myself and
using that as a way to expand and comment
on things not only'that I was attending but
things that I was creating, as the work itself
would create a performance," Olesko said.
Olesko aims to shed light on what she
perceives as absurd elements of society
using vivid, visual structures and verbal
performances.
"I think that art is a fool's tool to ... not
change society, but to illuminate it, and, so,
art is actually the expression that words
ignore and can't reach," she said.
These qualities extend into most art
forms, but it's the "live" aspect of perfor-
mance art that makes it such a dynamic,
interactive art, and one that will no, doubt
make its mark around campus.
"For this kind of program, everywhere is
(a performance space)," Tulip said. Which

means you can expect artistic performers
to become a mainstay around town.
"You know, we'll be invading - through
the correct channels of course!" Tulip said.
"We'll be fighting for space, you know, like
all performance. Once you introduce per-
formance then you're fighting for space ...
but we're tough fighters."
Not only must they toil for physical loca-
tion, but performance artists must also vie
for space in the general public discourse.

"I'd be

In order to address the obscure history
of performance art, the new major will
also be accompanied by a lecture series
discussing the development of the art

JULIE ANDR EWS EDWA RDS 'T HE L AST OF T HE R EA LLY GR EAT
WHANGDOODLES' (1974)
Surreal bedtime tales

By BETHANY GIBBONS
Daily Arts Writer
It's difficult to describe the
charm of "The Last of the Really
Great Whangdoodles" without
usingtheword"quirky." It'seven
more difficult to leave out "orig-
inal," "creative" and "zany." But
none of these can fully capture a
work that is so much more than
a children's fantasy novel.
As if 60 years of acting and
three Academy Awards nomina-
tions weren't enough to seal her
legacy, Julie Andrews - Mary
Poppins herself - has also writ-
ten one of the greatest children's
books of all time. In the spirit
of "The Phantom Tollbooth"
and "From the Mixed-Up Files
of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler,"
"Whangdoodles" creates a lov-
able and bizarre world of High-
Behind Splintercats, living
motorcycles and the ineffable
Whiffle Bird.
The story follows three chil-
dren - Ben, Tom and Lindy
Potter - on a journey with the
brilliant Professor Savant to a
magical world resembling Peter
Pan's Neverland on LSD. On the

trip, Lindy gets kidnapped by a
huge cat, the children travel on
the Jolly Boat - a vessel fueled
by bad jokes and uncontrollable
giggling - and Tom learns to
always be polite - even to the
Swamp Gaboons, who insult his
mother and otherwise bait him.
But through it all, their goal is
clear. They must reach the cas-
tle and see what few others have
A children's
book on LSD.
seen before: the last really great
Whangdoodle.
"Whangdoodles" borrows
the frame of English children's
literature in the style of E. Nes-
bit and others, and then tosses
in some ecstasy and tells it to get
out on the dance floor. In many
ways, it's more like "Alice in
Wonderland" than "Five Chil-
dren and It," far surpassing the
other classics in its genre with
sheer creativity.
But Edwards succeeds in

more than just the book's amaz-
ing originality; her true tri-
umph lies in the subtle harmony
between good and evil. In many
children's books, the story is
exasperatingly bland. No child
in his or her right mind wants
to read a book about perfect
children and their wonderful,
danger-free adventure. Incor-
porating horrifyingly scary
and invincible villains, how-
ever, isn't an effective recipe for
success on the juvenile market
either.
Edwards achieves a balance.
Not only are the protagonists
of "Whangdoodle" flawed and
the bad guys vulnerable, it's
often unclear who's on which
side. Sometimes good isn't quite
as good as it first appears, and
sometimes the villains aren't
as villainous as they seem.
More than a physical journey,
"Whangdoodles" is an emo-
tional puzzle that, as soon as
it seems predictable, reverses
readers' expectations.
In the end, "Whangdoodles"
is a story of hope, but in a very
specific sense: Here, technol-
ogy can solve even the most dire
and bizarre problems.
As Professor Savant
imports culture tubes,
a dissecting micro-
scope and a laser beam
into Whangdoodle-
land, Edwards makes a
statement - in 1974 -
about hope for technol-
ogy and hope through
technology. In the end,
the answer to all of
the problems of this
mystical land lies in a
mixture of scientific
advances and human
imagination.
"The Last of the
Really Great Whang-
doodles" shouldn't be
classified strictly as
children's literature. It
represents a freedom
of imagination, creativ-
ity and relativism that
appeals to a much larg-
er audience than those
who are 12 and under.

YOUR UMMA
From Page 1B
her freshman year.
"At first I was upset that one day it
was gone, but they redeemed them-
selves with the new museum," Musial
said, conversing with a friend about
how their previous experience with
the museum had been limited to see-
ing 15 pop-artpieces and then leaving.
The two emphpsizedthatthe museum
is now an immersive experience.
The UMMA experience is tailored
specifically to fit University students'
needs. Whether it be the free WiFi
and the comfy chairs that lure stu-
dents into the museum after class or
the extended hours and free admis-
sion that make it more convenient
to freely stroll through the exhibits,
once inside, students will find deeper
and more unexpected reasons for
enjoying UMMA.
"Art is a fundamental way of learn-
ing about the world," UMMA Direc-
tor of Education Ruth Slavin said.
"Whether or not it's a student's cho-
sen profession or not, I am hoping that
it will touch them in their four years."
Additional resources have been
added to the museum to help stu-
dents engage more with the artworks.
Besides the protocol placard next to
each piece, the museum offers addi-
tional information in each exhibit
spaceas well as storage drawers under
many of the sculptures. This wayvisi-
tors can choose to learn more if they
feel inclined to do so, but are not over-
whelmed with information.

"We wanted to take things beyond
labels. There are backstories (drawn)
from popular culture and science that
help people engage with the art in a
different way," Slavin said.
Artmuseums canoftenseemintim-
idating or irrelevant to a lot of people,
especially if those people aren't well
versed in the subjects at hand. Walk-
ing up a long flight of stairs and pass-
ingbetween huge monolithic columns
in order to enter a space that holds
something virtually unknown is not
always a comforting thought.
UMMA has combated this some-
what intimidating museum presence
not only with approachable literature
about the work in its collection, but by
opening its walls with floor-to-ceiling
glass windows. In doing so, UMMA
essentially nixes the notion of the
exclusive, academic institution and
puts art in the streets (or the Diag) for
the public to see.
The glass also allows the casual
passerby to catch a glimpse of what
more can be seen inside and perhaps
will get the person to gather some
courage to make the epic journey up
the stairs. That's one big hurdle -
getting people into the museum. The
next is keeping them there, and keep-
ing them coming back.
The labyrinthine design of the
museum forces visitors to weave
through galleries they may never
have walked through otherwise,
potentially introducing them to
things they never knew they were
interested in. It's nearly impossible
to come in and head straight for a
specific room without catching a
glimpse of something completely

unexpected. It's an experience that
may unfold hidden passions and
interests in the arts.
Alexandra Miller, an LSA senior
who attended the 24-hour open-
ing, was especially impressed by the
design of the vertical gallery - the
three-story, awe-inspiring exhibit
space that allows visitors to see into
multiple exhibits at once.
"It's almost like a CliffsNotes (on
the history of art) - it'sthis spectrum;
you can be looking at an abstract work
and see Asian art out of the corner of
your eye," Miller said. "And maybe
that person never goes to see Asian
art; maybe it intimidates them, or they
didn't think they were interested in it.
It makes you view art in that way -
more interconnected, more fluid, less
rigid, less boxed off."
This same idea is reflected in the
storage gallery in the upper balcony
of the apse. The effect of having con-
temporary art, African art and Indian
religious figures side-by-side with
Japanese sculpture helps the viewer
fill in the gaps between previously
separated art forms and begin to bet-
ter piece together the power that art
has on understanding a shared uni-
versal past.
After a full week of opening events,
it may seem appropriate to bask in
the afterglow of the successful reno-
vation. But the best part is still to be
realized. UMMA was not just a stu-
dent opening or a 24-hour museum
marathon. It's almost too simple to
even write: UMMA is open for the
rest of the year, the rest of your col-
lege education. UMMA is your's for
the taking.


it has had its place in the performance and art world for a
longtime, that gives the students a more solidbase to work
from."
Once given that base, the professors hope to see the stu-
dents work to advance their art form.
"We have tobe as much listeners and observers as giv-
ers and leaders because the program will start to define
itself even more by the students," Tulip said. "I mean, the
work that the students do will define what the program is
eventually. Because I think that's one thing we're waiting
for, isto see what new voices come."
But such development depends on those new voices

coming forth - a task often stilted by parental concerns.
Many parents have qualms about sending their sons and
daughters to theater and art schools, even if they have
well-established programs, noting the unpredictable and
competitive job market for artists and performers.
Still, Hughes sees hope for such creative occupations.
"Perhaps in this economy, I would argue that we all have
to be thinking like artists. You know, everybody has to be
creative, and there's no clear career path."
Regardless of post-graduation plans, Tulip offers some
advice to aspiring performance artists: "I think what the
students need is that unshakable knowledge ... 'Nothing's
going to stop me, wherever I am, wherever, whatever I'm
doing, I'll be making my art, however it grows."'
One thing is sure: The Interarts major will provide a
haven for colorfully creative minds, and their handiwork
will add to the already vibrant backdrop of arts on campus.
