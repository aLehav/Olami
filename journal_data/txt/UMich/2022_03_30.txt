ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Students call for climate action from 
UMich, demands ‘People Over Profit’
 Over 15 environmental advocacy groups sign open letter for admin to prioritize sustainability

Over 100 students gathered on 

the Diag Friday afternoon as part 
of a global climate strike organized 
by Fridays for Future, a youth-led 
organization dedicated to fighting 
climate change. The theme of 
Friday’s strike was “People Over 
Profit” and featured speakers 
calling for climate action centering 
around social justice.

The event kicked off with live 

music and educational booths 

on topics such as the United 
Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change (IPCC), the 
ongoing 
indigenous 
Landback 

movement and ways to address 
climate change through public 
policy.

Speakers from various student 

and 
local 
organizations 
then 

addressed attendees, emphasizing 
the importance of clean energy and 
climate justice. 

LSA sophomore Lexi Crilley 

emphasized the “People Over 
Profit” theme in her speech Friday 
afternoon.

“Climate 
justice 
is 
social, 

economic and political justice on 
all fronts,” Crilley said. “It is racial 
justice, it is gender equality — and 
it cannot be achieved without 
addressing the complex systems of 
oppression that have created all of 
these issues.”

Greg 
Woodring, 
president 

of Ann Arbor for Public Power 
(AAPP), discussed the importance 
of transitioning to a publicly owned 
utility instead of relying on a private 
company. The AAPP organization 
advocates for a switch to an energy 
grid that is clean, renewable and 
owned by the city of Ann Arbor. 
Currently, the city’s electricity is 

supplied by Detroit-based DTE 
Energy, with about half of the 
company’s electricity supply being 
generated by coal.

“We can say that we are no 

longer going to allow a private 
corporation controlled by a small 
group of callous and indifferent 
people to determine what the fate 
of this world will be,” Woodring 
said. “We can invest in our future, 
we can build a new paradigm and 
we can say that we are no longer 
going to accept the world as it is.”

The 
University 
of 

Michigan 
Board 
of 

Regents met at University 
Hall 
in 
the 
Ruthven 

Building 
Thursday 
to 

discuss 
progress 
in 

the search for a new 
University 
president, 

renovations to the Central 
Campus 
Recreation 

Building 
(CCRB) 
and 

upgrades to University 
athletic facilities. 

Interim 
University 

President 
Mary 
Sue 

Coleman 
began 
the 

meeting 
by 
addressing 

the 
recently 
created 

Coordinated Community 
Response Team (CCRT) 
which 
is 
designed 
to 

address sexual violence 
at the University. The 
formation of the CCRT 
was included in the terms 
of settlement of a class-
action 
lawsuit 
brought 

against 
the 
University 

by LSA senior Josephine 
Graham in May 2021. 
Graham 
alleged 
the 

University 
was 
not 

adequately 
protecting 

students 
from 
sexual 

abuse 
and 
said 
the 

formation of the CCRT is a 
critical step in addressing 
this failure at a Wednesday 
press conference.

Graham’s 
lawsuit 
is 

separate from the 2020 
class-action 
suit 
filed 

by survivors of former 
University doctor Robert 
Anderson, which recently 
reached a settlement of 
$490 million for over a 1,000 
survivors.

The 
regents 
also 

approved Dentistry Dean 
Laurie K. McCauley as the 
University’s next provost 
and president of academic 
affairs. 
McCauley 
will 

replace outgoing Provost 
Susan Collins, who will 
leave the position on May 
15 to become the next 
President of the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Boston.

The 
board 
voted 

unanimously 
to 
bestow 

Collins with a Regents 
Citation of Honor for her 
service to the University. 
Collins thanked the board 
for this honor, reflecting 
on her time as University 
Provost. 

“Serving 
as 
provost, 

particularly 
during 
a 

difficult time, it’s really been 
a privilege,” Collins said. “It’s 
also been a privilege to work 
with so many wonderful 

leaders at this university … 
It has been a team effort, 
and together I do believe we 
have gone far.”

Collins then provided 

an update on how the 
University is supporting 
students affected by Russia’s 
invasion of Ukraine. Collins 
said the University has 
been in touch with students 
from Russia and Ukraine, 
and it has taken a number 
of measures to ensure the 
safety 
and 
educational 

security of these students. 

“We 
have 
responded 

by providing them with 
information about support 
services and by taking 
action 
to 
ensure 
that 

they can continue their 
education 
here, 
despite 

financial constraints and 
other difficulties in their 
home countries,” Collins 
said. “(We) will continue to 
monitor this situation and 
to support our students 
throughout 
this 
very 

challenging time.”

On 
March 
15, 
the 

University 
announced 

it will no longer make 
investments 
in 
Russia 

and will pull all current 
investments from 2009

CSG executive candidates sit down for Q&A ahead of elections

 EnvisionBLUE, Diverse&Dedicated platforms running in 2022 

The University of Michigan Central 

Student Government will be hosting its 
annual election for the CSG assembly 
and the Police Department Oversight 
Committee on March 30 and 31. Two 
platforms — EnvisionBLUE and 
Diverse&Dedicated — are running in 
the executive ticket for CSG President 
and Vice President. The Michigan 
Daily sat down with the members 

from both parties to discuss their 
platforms and goals for campus if 
elected. 

This 
conversation 
has 
been 

condensed and edited for clarity. 

EnvisionBLUE
LSA junior Noah Zimmerman 

is running for President of the 
EnvisionBLUE 
Party 
with 
LSA 

junior Jacqueline Hillman as the 
vice presidential candidate. The 
EnvisionBlue platform consists of 30 
action items and 15 advocacy projects 
in collaboration with CSG and 
campus organizations. Zimmerman 

said that one of the party’s main 
goals is to strengthen leadership and 
representation on campus. 

Zimmerman previously served as 

LSA representative and Chair of the 
Rules Committee of the CSG assembly. 
Hillman has not held a position on 
CSG prior to running this year. 

Diverse&Dedicated
LSA 
junior 
Erica 
Nelson 
is 

running 
for 
President 
of 
the 

Diverse&Dedicated party with LSA 
sophomore Ronald Burgaj as the 
vice presidential candidate. Nelson 
said that Diverse&Dedicated aims 

to promote diverse experiences and 
backgrounds while uplifting unique 
student perspectives on campus.

Nelson and Burgaj have served as 

LSA representatives for LSA student 
government. 
Both 
Burgaj 
and 

Nelson are also currently running 
for LSA student government as 
president 
and 
Vice 
President 

respectively.

TMD: What inspired you to 

run this year for CSG?

Noah Zimmerman: Through 

our 
past 
experiences, 
Jackie 

and I got to learn a lot about the 

structure of CSG. I saw myself as 
someone who got a lot done, but 
at the same time, I felt CSG was 
missing something. I had a lot of 
projects that I really wanted to 
get done, but I wasn’t able to get 
those implemented in the (CSG) 
assembly. That’s when I started 
to think about running for CSG 
president. Jackie and I came 
together and talked about our 
vision for CSG, the mission that 
we wanted to create, and that 
determined that we wanted to 
run.

Jacqueline 
Hillman: 
I’ve 

actually done a lot of political work. 
So it’s been really rewarding just to 
experience politics in the real world 
and on campus. So I wanted to 
bring that perspective into campus 
politics and bring a fresh pair of 
eyes to CSG and the way it operates. 
I think that’s reflected not only in 
our platform, but it really centers 
well with what Noah is doing in 
his perspectives from a historical 
standpoint. Then I can come in and 
bring in my own approach for my

‘U’ hosts 26th annual exhibition of art 
by Michigan prisoners at Duderstadt 

 Over 700 pieces on display from March 22 to April 5

The 26th Annual Exhibition of 

Art by Michigan Prisoners opening 
gallery was held on Tuesday evening 
at the Duderstadt Center Gallery. The 
exhibition was put together by the 
Prison Creative Arts Project (PCAP) 
in coordination with the Michigan 
Department of Corrections (MDOC). 
The gallery is open to the public from 
March 22-April 5. 

The first exhibition was held in 

the University of Michigan Rackham 
Galleries in February 1996; seventy pieces 
of art from 50 artists were featured in the 
first exhibition. This year, all 26 Michigan 
prisons sent in artwork by people who 
are incarcerated there – 714 pieces were 
displayed from 392 artists.

Nora Krinitsky, PCAP director and 

lecturer in the Residential College, said 
this year’s exhibition would be the first 
one in three years. Krinitsky said people 
who are incarcerated face isolation and 
unimaginable loss over the years and are 
excited to share their work with the public.

“Viewing another person’s art is 

absolutely fascinating,” Krinitsky said. “A 
population that has been almost entirely 

cut off from human contact over the past 
two years really deserves our attention … I 
think you’ll also find incredible examples 
of resilience in the artwork. Looking at 
the pieces and spending time with that is 
uplifting in ways that I couldn’t have even 
imagined.”

The artists work independently using 

supplies they have obtained themselves. 
Various media were used by the 
artists such as acrylic, colored pencil, 
watercolor, embroidery floss with 
glue and more. Art selection teams, 
consisting of curators, staff, students 

and volunteers, travel to each prison to 
meet artists to select work for display 
and provide general feedback and 
support to the artists.

 University reaches 
settlement in lawsuit 

over handling of 
sexual misconduct

 New Coordinated Community 

Response Team to work on transparency, 

accountability in policies

The University of Michigan 

and 
attorneys 
representing 

U-M students have reached a 
settlement in a class action lawsuit 
and have agreed to the creation 
of a Coordinated Community 
Response Team (CCRT). This 
comprehensive 
group 
will 

work to add transparency to the 
University’s response to sexual 
violence on campus and ensure 
students’ safety.

The lawsuit was filed in May 

2021 by LSA senior Josephine 
Graham, a student representative, 
accusing the University of their 
failure to protect students on 
campus from sexual violence. 
This settlement follows the $490 
million agreement with survivors 
of the late University doctor 
Robert Anderson. The financial 

agreement for Graham’s case 
is still being finalized, but the 
implementation of the CCRT will 
begin. Graham said that the CCRT 
is the capstone of the settlement 
and spoke to her excitement of the 
process beginning.

“I’m really excited about the 

potential of this Coordinated 
Community Response Team, 
and it’s really a first step in 
establishing more accountability, 
transparency 
and, 
really 

importantly, community decision 
making,” Graham said at a press 
conference Wednesday. “When 
it comes to U of M’s, history 
of sexual misconduct and the 
policies and procedures and all 
those programs that are being 
implemented, the CCRT (will 
further this innovation) which 
is the main focal point of the 
settlement.”

Experts discuss intersection of Black popular culture, science fiction and activism

The 
LSA 
Institute 
for 
the 

Humanities and the University of 

Michigan Arts Initiative explored how 

Afrofuturism — a cultural aesthetic 

emerging in the 1990s that combined 

elements of science fiction and Black 

popular culture — manifests in art today 

in a virtual panel Wednesday night. 

The panel was a part of the 

University’s 
Octavia 
Butler 
Week 

programming in honor of African 

American author Octavia Butler who 

received a MacArthur Genius Grant in 

1995.

Four panelists were featured and the 

panel was moderated by Christopher 

Audain, managing director of the U-M 

Arts Initiative. The panel discussed the 

intersection of art and Afrofuturism in 

light of the upcoming U-M theatrical 

adaptation of Octavia Butler’s post-

apocalyptic novel Parable of the Sower. 

Naomi 
André, 
professor 
of 

Afroamerican and American studies 

and women’s and gender studies, began 

the panel discussion by talking about 

the function of art in an Afrofuture. 

Andre said Afrofuturism is a space of 

possibility and art can help realize that 

possibility.

“Metaphorically 
art 
can 
be 

a 
spaceship,” 
Andre 
said. 
“The 

destination of the spaceship is that space 

of possibility … a place where Black 

people are treated as fully human. A 

place where Black folks do not need 

handouts or special treatments. It is a 

space where all people are part of the 

same whole where the smartest and 

the best people come from all racial 

backgrounds and ethnic backgrounds. 

Art can help us think of these places, 

envision these landscapes.”

Tananarive Due, a lecturer in the 

department 
of 
African 
American 

studies at the University of California 

at Los Angeles, spoke about her work 

with horror. As a genre, Due said, horror 

can be a form of escapism for members 

of the Black community because the 

danger portrayed is not real, unlike 

the ever-present threat posed by white 

supremacy.

Due then spoke about her mother’s 

experience as an activist in the 1960s. 

She said that her parents were living 

proof that change was possible through 

action and that through activism, 

change was already happening. 

“I’m often struck by the irony of 

how that social agitation in the 1960s 

was in sort of a futuristic vacuum,” 

Due said. “Because you’re fighting for 

a future you do not know how to even 

anticipate, and in fact, some of the 

things that those activists in the 60s 

would have considered futurism were 

already happening, but just outside of 

their knowledge, which is one of the 

things about Afrofuturism that is so 

exciting. It’s not only the arts, but it’s the 

activism.”

Susana M. Morris, an associate 

professor and scholar of Black feminism, 

Black digital media and Afrofuturism at 

Georgia Institute of Technology, then 

spoke about the power she felt when she 

first met Octavia Butler.

“The idea that the only constant 

(in the world) is change and that we 

humans, even working class Black girls 

with big ideas have the power to truly 

shape our world for the better or worse, 

was thrilling,” Morris said.

Morris then spoke about the idea of 

a “positive obsession,” something that 

Butler described herself as having. 

“(Butler) called her deep unmitigated 

desire to create art and share her work a 

positive obsession,” Morris said. “Butler 

said her positive obsession became a 

higher calling and wished everyone to 

have a positive obsession. 

John Jennings, professor of media 

and cultural studies at the University of 

California at Riverside, also spoke at the 

panel about the rise of Afrofuturism and 

his work translating Octavia Butler’s 

novels into graphic novels. 

“I can’t relate how difficult it was to 

work with but also the amount of pressure 

it was … thinking about this from a kind 

of vantage point of us collaborating with 

Octavia Butler and trying to figure out 

how to translate her words into a graphic 

novel,” Jennings said.

In the question and answer portion 

of the event, Rackham student Symone 

Campbell asked the panelists for 

recommendations of texts or films for 

Black students who want to learn more 

about Afrofuturism.

“Start with the dark matter series,” 

Jennings said. “These are collections 

of speculative fiction by and about 

people of color. They are a really good 

subsection of work in various genres.”

Morris added that Afrofuturism is 

closely tied to the idea of Black joy, which 

celebrates the accomplishments and 

experiences of the Black community, 

despite centuries of discrimmination 

and trauma.

“Afrofuturism 
as 
a 
cultural 

movement is fundamentally Black 

joy centered, because to posit a future 

where Black folk are centered, not 

marginalized, where we are absolutely 

necessary for the continuance of human 

society is a hopeful project, is a project 

that is joyful,” Morris said.

In her final remarks, Due said 

that younger people have a different 

perspective and that the younger 

generation has the ability to question 

aspects of the world that older 

generations have settled into.

“There’s a part of us that has settled 

for what reality is and the way the 

younger generation has not, they look 

out and say why,” Due said. “So let’s … 

have the imagination at least to listen 

to someone who’s trying to picture and 

point a path toward a different way.”

 Jonathan Vaughn working with private 
investigator on allegations the University 
sanctioned Anderson study on athletes

ANNA FIFELSKI
Daily Staff Reporter

California-based company GET BIT to handle the case pro-bono

Jonathan Vaughn shared a press 

release on March 11 announcing he 

hired a private investigation company 

based in southern California, GET 

BIT, to investigate allegations that the 

University of Michigan “sanctioned” 

a study by Dr. Robert Anderson that 

researched the sperm of “elite athletes.” 

The press release alleges Anderson 

forced athletes to provide sperm 

samples and illegally sold the sperm to 

unknowing parties. According to GET 

BIT, the Private Investigator company 

is handling the case pro-bono.

In May 2021, WilmerHale, an 

independent law firm hired by the 

University to investigate allegations of 

sexual assault against Anderson, found 

that hundreds of the allegations are 

credible. The report also stated that 

several University officials were aware 

of Anderson’s misconduct.

University 
spokesman 
Rick 

Fitzgerald wrote in an email to The 

Michigan Daily that WilmerHale didn’t 

find evidence of the new allegations 

against Anderson. 

“While the WilmerHale report 

contains references to Anderson’s 

interest in male reproductive health, 

including the collection of semen 

samples, the investigative team found 

no evidence of the activities alleged in 

the press release you cite,” Fitzgerald 

wrote. 

Fitzgerald added that the University 

provided 
many 
documents 
and 

pieces of evidence to the WilmerHale 

investigation, but he did not directly 

respond 
to 
inquiries 
about 
the 

University participation in the GET BIT 

investigation. 

“It’s also worth noting that the 

university provided WilmerHale with 

unfettered access to more than 200 

individuals, 2 million documents from 

the Bentley Historical Library, 125 

boxes of paper personnel files and tens 

of thousands of other documents.”

According to Luis Bolaños, founder 

of GET BIT Investigations and the 

private investigator for Vaughn’s case, 

the “Hail to the Victims” investigation 

is considered a criminal investigation. 

Bolaños 
said 
he 
reached 
out 

to Vaughn about conducting an 

investigation when he saw a headline 

about Anderson and was reminded of a 

2020 lawsuit in California that was filed 

against a late sheriff who was found to 

have been involved in one of the largest 

child molestation and sexual assault 

cases.

“I had no idea what was happening 

in Michigan,” Bolaños said. “I’ve never 

heard of Jon. I had no idea who he was. 

I had no idea of Dr. Anderson and the 

allegations against him. But between 

(Anderson and Duffy), there are 

thousands and thousands of victims, 

so that’s why I first heard about it and 

(what) made me want to reach out to 

(Vaughn) and talk to him a little more.”

Vaughn said he decided to work 

with GET BIT because he and other 

survivors are still looking for answers. 

“There were two times specifically I 

remember offhanded comments where 

Dr. Robert Anderson said (he was) 

trying to figure out how to create the 

perfect Black athlete,” Vaughn said.

Vaughn said he began his personal 

investigation 
into 
his 
and 
other 

allegations against Anderson in 2020 

after hearing similar stories from other 

survivors.

“This is something that I have 

been investigating since early into the 

mediation process, (which) dates back 

to probably September or October of 

2020,” Vaughn said. “It was just very 

clear to me and to several of us survivors 

that there was an issue with the location 

of not only our medical reports, but 

we got several stories that they were 

destroyed or they kept them for 10 years 

and then destroyed (them) or they don’t 

exist.”

Bolaños said GET BIT and Vaughn 

are working with Promoting Awareness 

| Victim Empowerment (PAVE) to 

schedule virtual and in-person press 

conferences surrounding this issue.

PAVE founder Angela Rose told 

The Daily she was inspired to start this 

organization after she was abducted 

and assaulted by a repeat sex offender 

when she was 17. Rose said PAVE is 

working on setting up a half-day virtual 

summit dedicated to supporting male 

survivors. 

“People knew that these things were 

happening (and) I don’t know if they 

just don’t know what to say, or do, or if 

their moral compass is broken or who 

knows what the reason, but there are a

so I feel like it’s our job to try and do 

something proactive,” Rose said.

ADMINISTRATION

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Graduate students at the Univer-

sity of Michigan School of Social 
Work walked out of their classes 
Monday morning and gathered on 
the Diag to rally for Payments for 
Placements (P4P). This is a student 
campaign demanding that the Uni-
versity begin compensating Master 
of Social Work (MSW) students for 
their internship work; around 80 
members of the campus commu-
nity attended the walkout.

In 2017, MSW students, Social 

Work alumni and social workers 
started a petition calling for fair 
compensation for their field work. 
Most recently in January, MSW 
students submitted a petition with 
over 300 student signatures to 
Social Work Dean Joseph Himle 
and other Social Work administra-
tors calling on the University to 
fund their degree-required intern-
ships. 

Currently, the majority of MSW 

field work positions are unpaid 
even though the Council on Social 
Work Education requires that 
MSW students across the U.S. 
complete 900 hours of field work 
during their master’s program. 
SSW spokeswoman Lisa Raycraft 
confirmed that at the University, 
non-advanced standing MSW stu-
dents must complete 912 hours of 
field work to get their degree. How-
ever, MSW students with advanced 
standing — those who come into the 
University with a BSW — only have 
to complete 684 hours during their 
three semester program.

At the protest, several MSW stu-

dents expressed their frustrations 
with the lack of compensation for 
their field work, which they claim 
has impacted their mental health 
and ability to afford housing.

Anjelica Abraham, a MSW stu-

dent and one of the speakers at the 
walkout, told the crowd that balanc-
ing a paid job with her unpaid field 
work causes a lot of stress. Abra-

ham said she is currently work-
ing to complete her field work at 
Kids-TALK Children’s Advocacy 
Center in Detroit, which involves an 
85-mile commute.

“I’m tired of having to juggle two 

part-time jobs on top of class work, 
on top of field (work) and with an 
85 mile round trip multiple times a 
week,” Abraham said. “I’m tired of 
working 12 hours a day, six days a 
week.”

Other students within the Social 

Work School shared Abraham’s 
frustration. A survey conducted by 
the P4P leaders found that 83% of 
respondents worked additional jobs 
on top of the required field work.

In an email to The Michigan 

Daily, Dan Fischer, assistant dean 
of field education in the SSW, 
wrote that unpaid field work does 
not violate the U.S. Fair Labor and 
Standards Act which helps protect 
workers’ rights. Fischer empha-
sized that the field work is primarily 
intended to academically support 
the MSW program by providing 

students with hands-on experience 
before receiving their degree.

“Students are unlicensed pro-

fessionals and would not be able to 
engage in MSW-level work,” Fisch-
er wrote. “Field placements also 
provide opportunities for students 
to discover new ideas or to think 
about themselves and their own 
values, prejudices, and attitudes 
towards others while learning to 
manage emotions and feelings 
within real-world settings.”

Other programs at the Univer-

sity provide stipends for students 

to compensate for their work. The 
Ford School of Public Policy offers 
funding for Master of Public Policy 
students with low-paying or unpaid 
internships — 60% of MPP stu-
dents receive funding from Ford 
School partnerships or other U-M 
resources. Similarly, the University 
of Michigan Law School guarantees 
up to a $6,500 stipend for second-
year law students who take summer 
internships with government agen-
cies or public interest organizations.

MSW students are not the only 

master’s students who are not paid 

for field work. Fischer wrote that 
other master’s programs in the 
health sciences at the University 
also do not provide monetary com-
pensation for clinical work.

“No other health sciences profes-

sional program at U-M, including 
medicine, nursing, dentistry and 
pharmacy, pays students for clini-
cal training recognizing the critical 
impact of experiential learning,” 
Fischer wrote.

BOARD OF REGENTS
From Page 1

CAMPUS LIFE

Geoffrey Chatas, executive vice 

president and chief financial officer, 
updated the regents on the University’s 
carbon neutrality progress, including 
the creation of the new Planet Blue 
dashboard, 
which 
tracks 
U-M 

greenhouse gas emissions levels and 
reduction trajectory. According to 
Chatas, the University is on track to 
meet its sustainability goals and reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions.

“I’m 
extremely 
pleased 
to 

announce that U of M is on pace to 
reduce greenhouse gasses scope one 
and two by 50% by 2025, which is 
both five years ahead of and exceeds 
the United Nations intergovernmental 
panel on climate change … guidance 
to reduce emissions by 45% by 2030,” 
Chatas said. “We’re also working to 
instill a University-wide culture of 
sustainability with justice as a core 
principle.”

Chatas also revealed plans to 

purchase four all-electric buses for the 
Ann Arbor campus — one 60-foot bus 
and three standard 40-foot buses — 
as well as a $10 million plan to replace 
lights in 70 buildings on all three 
campuses with LED lights. Chatas 
also said the University is working on 
existing investments that emit large 
levels of greenhouse gasses.

The board then discussed plans 

to renovate the Central Campus 
Recreational Building . New features 
of the plan include a three-court 
gymnasium and a natatorium with a 
lap pool, a recreational pool and a post-
workout recovery pool. Mike Widen, 
director 
of 
Recreational 
Sports, 

emphasized the value of renovating 
the CCRB given its contributions to 
student well-being. 

“This is a truly comprehensive 

facility built for student experience,” 
Widen said. “This is a prime example 
for many decades to come of our 
campus’s commitment to health 
and well-being for our students and 
our entire University of Michigan 
community.” 

Regent Denise Illitch (D), co-chair 

of the Presidential Search Committee, 
gave an update on the board’s search 
for a new University president and 
expressed gratitude for the level of 
campus involvement in the process.

“I want to say how grateful we 

are for the outpouring of community 
engagement and feedback we’ve 
received since the beginning of 
this presidential search process,” 
Illitch said. “Over 1,000 University 
of Michigan community members 
completed our feedback survey.”

Illitch also shared some of the major 

themes from the February Presidential 
Search Committee listening sessions. 

“Number one, it is important that 

the next president rebuild trust and 
accountability within the University 
community, leading with integrity and 
readdressing past abuses and sexual 
misconduct,” Illitch said. “I was struck 
by all (the) sessions, the observations 
of being heard, and of listening and of 
being appreciated.”

The regents then allowed public 

commenters to communicate what 
they would like to see in the next 
University president. Law student 
Hafsa Tout said she wanted a president 
who would commit to listening to 
students and addressing campus 
concerns.

As an undergraduate at the 

University, Tout was a Central Student 
Government 
(CSG) 
representative 

and was part of passing a resolution in 
2017 asking the board to divest from 
companies based in Israel in response to 
the occupation of Palestine. The board 
voted to reject this resolution less than 
a month later. Tout said she felt that the 
University’s recent announcement to 
pull its investments in Russian-based 
companies demonstrated hypocrisy 
in light of its previous attitude toward 
divesting in Israel-based companies. 

“The statement that the board 

issued in response to that resolution 
read, ‘We remain committed to the 
University’s long-standing policy to 
shield the endowment from political 
pressures,’” Tout said. “But here we are 
in 2022 when the board and Interim 
President are openly, unhesitatingly 
and quickly making decisions and 
changes to the endowment in response 
to undeniably political situations 
across the world, which fully deserve 
that response, but which directly 
contradict that supposed commitment 
to shielding the endowment from 
political pressure.”

Illitch also addressed concerns from 

meeting attendees who commented on 
the difficulties that individuals with 
physical disabilities face opening doors 
on campus. 

“We commit to prioritize and 

provide an automatic door opener into 
all of our public buildings right now,” 
Illitch said. “We have 50 buildings in 
need of that; we already have several 
hundred automatic door openers on 
entry doors, but if there is a specific 
door that’s difficult to open, please 
email (me) … or the associate vice 
president of Facilities and Operations.”

Illitch said a new map of all 

accessible pathways in buildings will 
be completed over the summer and 
made available to the public in Fall 
2022. 

Public Health senior Nithya Arun, 

CSG President, asked the Regents to 
consider changing the name of Angell 
Hall — a building named after the 
University’s longest-serving president, 
James B. Angell. 

In 1880, Angell negotiated The 

Angell Treaty, which allowed the 
United States to restrict the migration 
of certain categories of Chinese 
workers and is widely considered to be 
a precursor to the Chinese Exclusion 
Act of 1882, a piece of legislation that 
prohibited all immigration of Chinese 
laborers into the United States. 

Arun also asked the regents to 

consider increasing the CSG student 
fee, which currently requires all 
students to pay $9.19. Arun did not 
clarify the amount she is interested in 
receiving. 

“We 
implement 
recurring 

programs that are heavily utilized by 
students, such as a free subscription to 
The New York Times and Wall Street 
Journal, a GRE, MCAT and LSAT test 
prep program provided at reduced 
cost, subsidized transportation to and 
from the airport for major breaks and 
significant student org funding,” Arun 
said. “Unfortunately, given that our 
current student fee is set at $9.19, these 
programs are becoming unsustainable 
for CSG’s budget. So when the time 
comes to vote on the new budget, I urge 
you to vote in favor of a fee increase.”

The regents then voted to approve 

a $41 million update to the Big House, 
including an $8 million upgrade to 
the production room — the space that 

controls the audiovisual experience 
for several U-M sports venues across 
campus — which serves field hockey, 
ice hockey, basketball, football, soccer, 
indoor track, baseball and softball.

Additional 
updates 
include 

replacements for the north and south 
video boards in Michigan Stadium 
for $12 million, and an audio system 
replacement for $5 million. Other 
updates to the Big House include 
safety additions for $4 million and 
infrastructure, site work and design 
fees for $12 million. According to Rob 
Rademacher, chief operating officer of 
U-M Athletics, the source of funding 
will be Athletic Department Gifts 
Restricted for Capital Improvements. 

“I also just want to reiterate a little 

bit of my experience in sports and 
with stadiums, and I can’t begin to tell 
you the enhancement of a scoreboard 
and the infrastructure and the new 
technology around it, how much it 
enhances the fan experience,” Illitch 
said. “It will be like night and day.” 

During the public comment portion 

of the meeting, several commenters 
expressed 
desires 
for 
increased 

resources for student physical and 
financial well-being. 

Elaine 
Lande, 
 
comprehensive 

studies program lecturer, said the 
University needs to increase the 
availability of menstrual products on 
campus. In late January, the University 
announced 670 main-floor restrooms 
will be given free menstrual products 
in all academic and student-facing 
buildings.

“ 
I am a Gen X-er,” Lande said. “I 

learned a lot from my students. They 
are not shy or embarrassed to talk 
about their periods as my generation 
and those before; I am following their 

lead. While the need for feminine 
products in the bathrooms may be 
difficult for someone to understand, I 
liken this to someone defecating and 
then realizing there’s no toilet paper, or 
in this case, having no expectation of 
toilet paper available.”

Social 
Work 
students 

Matthew Dargay and Arie Davey, 
representatives for Payments for 
Placements, said students in the School 
of Social Work should be paid for the 
field placements in which they are 
required to participate for graduation. 
The organization wrote a petition 
in January outlining their concerns 
and emphasizing that the University 
affords stipends to students in other 
graduate programs, a practice they 
argue should be extended to include 
social work students. 

“Nine hundred and fourteen hours 

I work in my internship are required 
for me to receive my master’s degree,” 
Davey said. “I do the same work as 
the paid staff at my agency, but I don’t 
get paid. Social work students are in a 
financial crisis.”

Dargay echoed similar sentiments 

and pointed to how Public Policy and 
Law students at the University are 
compensated for their internships, 
while Social Work students are still not.

“We applaud the University of 

Michigan for affording stipends to 
public policy students and law students 
who have decided to take their 
internships with public interest firms,” 
Dargay said. “And we believe that 
social work students should be treated 
similarly.”

Erica Nelson: I wanted a real seat 

at a table that is not often invited to 
me. I wanted to give myself a place 
in (the) university, specifically in 
student government, where I can help 
students who look like me — or don’t 
look like me — have a voice in the 
system, have a say in the things that 
impact them. I am running, because I 
wanted to be there for the students. I 
want to be a voice, be a light, and show 
future Wolverines that being at a place 
like this and having a voice in the 
decisions that affect you is important. 
That’s really why I wanted to run. I 
want to inspire. I want to lead but I also 
know how to be led. I want to show 
underrepresented communities that 
this is okay and that (the University) is 
a place that you belong.

Ron Burgaj: A lot of wanting to run 

is being the change that we want to 
see happen. Part of being the “Leaders 
and Best” isn’t just talking the talk, but 
it’s walking the walk. It’s speaking to 
the underrepresented groups here at 
the University, it’s meeting with them, 
meeting with admin, seeing how we 
can best incorporate what’s best for 
the students, what’s best for us. We 
are the University and our voices need 
to be heard.

TMD: Is there anything you 

would like to highlight regarding 
your campaign?

NZ: The biggest thing is that our 

candidacy is more of a partnership. 

There’s 
this 
stigmatization 
of 

president and vice president. We’re 
seeing these positions as a separation 
of focus areas rather than a hierarchy. 
Jackie and I want to make sure that 
we’re playing to our strengths. Jackie 
has her strengths. She’s very good at 
communications, programming and 
government relations, so those are the 
focus areas that she’ll have. I’ve had 
a lot of experience in CSG policy and 
law experience with working with 
the assembly and the other student 
governments in Flint and Dearborn, 
the Association of Big Ten Students. 
I’ve also had some experience working 
with 
the 
Student 
Organization 

Committee. We want to be able to 
make sure that we’re doing everything 
as efficiently as possible.

JH: Processes that are going to 

better represent voices on campus. 
We think different populations, like 
the Greek Life Community, doesn’t 
have a spot within CSG to advocate 
for their needs. With different 
cultural groups, we want to make 
sure that those voices are being heard. 
There are a lot of different structural 
changes that we want to make in order 
to allow for that to be the case within 
(student) government and ensure 
that our policies are actually going to 
impact the people they’re intended 
for. While it’s great to have 15 LSA 
representatives, that can’t represent 
1000s of (LSA) students, so we want to 
create a space where everyone’s input 
can be shared.

EN: We’re the Diverse&Dedicated 

students. We’re diverse in our beliefs, 

diverse in our experiences, we’re 
dedicated to making real change, 
we’re dedicated to underrepresented 
communities. We have gone out and 
asked them how we can best (serve 
them). While campaigning, we’ve 
gone to La Casa, we’ve gone to the 
Michigan Africans, we’ve gone to BSU 
(Black Student Union), we’ve gone 
to the Arab Student Association and 
we’ve had conversations with them. 
We have already taken that leap by 
saying, ‘How can we best serve you?’ 
That’s who we are. We want to serve 
the students, we want to serve the 
people. People like us, people different 
from us. That’s just who we are.

RB: We’ve talked with a lot of 

different cultural organizations on 
campus. There have been groups 
that we went to, and they’ve told us, 
‘You were the first ones to ever reach 
out, you’re the first ones that come to 
our meetings for this, you’re the first 
ones to actually hear what we have to 
say.’ We plan to continue that work, 
because we want to be the change 
that we want to see. There’s a big 
growing nontraditional population 
of students here, and every year that 
continues to grow: students that are 
first generation, students that are 
immigrants in this country, students 
that are transferring here. We want 
to give them a seat at the table. So 
together with their love and support, 
we can make the University better for 
all its students so we can be the change 
we want to see, so we can be diverse 
and dedicated.

TMD: Why did you two decide to 

run together as president and vice 
president?

NZ: We had met a couple times 

earlier, but we didn’t really know each 
other before this year. While working 
on FlipBLUE, we got to talking more 
and more. We had a shared vision 
for what campus could look like. We 
saw that there is a lack of sufficient 
programming and policies being 
implemented this year. We don’t think 
that’s the fault of anyone. It’s just been 
transition years with COVID. But 
we thought we could bring a sense of 
pragmatism and practicality to CSG, 
especially with our experience in 
government. So that’s how we decided 
to run.

EN: Ron and I, we’ve been best 

friends for a few months now. We met 
in the LSA student government, and it 
just felt natural for us to run together 
because we’re both passionate about 
making a difference. After talking to 
each other, learning more about each 
other and seeing how passionate the 
other person is, we were like, ‘Yeah, 
we should do this.’ Especially since 
we’ve shared some experiences within 
Student Government that weren’t 
the most positive, it really solidified 
our bond. We said we’re gonna be a 
powerhouse. Let’s get this done. Let’s 
put that work in.

TMD: For the executive runner, 

what are some prevalent campus 
issues you plan on addressing 
through your campaign?

NZ: Jackie highlighted a lot of 

our main points that we’re trying to 

make with the campaign. During my 
first year, I saw a lot of programs and 
policies that were directed towards 
students’ everyday lives, something as 
simple as the calculator and iClicker 
loan programs. Jackie and I really 

want to provide the small things for 
students that don’t end up being small 
after all.

IN THIS WORLD of expectations, schedules, 

meticulously crafted five-year plans and a deep 
underlying pressure to have everything figured 
out, a surprise can be refreshing, terrifying, the 
absolute worst or the one thing you needed all 
along. Surprises have been the key to my life, simul-
taneously adding the sprinkles of delight I need to 
get through the ceaseless repetition of existence 
while also ripping any semblance of control out 
from under me like an amateur magician pulling 
a tablecloth from under fine china (and leaving me 
to pick up the pieces). Simply put, I wouldn’t be the 
person I am today without the surprises I’ve expe-
rienced along the way. So of course, I wanted to 
hear about what surprises mean to the thoughtful, 
lovely and sometimes delightfully unhinged writ-
ers here at the Arts section of The Michigan Daily. 

As I gave them a false pitch for this B-Side (The 

Taylor Swift B-Side) before revealing the true 

theme, watching their faces morph from disgust 
to relief to betrayal, I knew they wouldn’t skip the

I AVOIDED DOWNLOADING TikTok for 

as long as I could. I watched as friends got 
drawn in, downloading it from the App Store 
and ending up glued to their phone for hours, 
as the app scrolled through short-length vid-
eos automatically. I never had Vine or Musi-
cal.ly, never cared about that side of Gen Z’s 
pop culture. I never saw the appeal of the 
short video format. Who could effectively 
tell stories in so brief a time? What mean-
ingful ideas and thoughts could come from 
it? I decided as it grew in popularity that I 
would not download TikTok and waste my 
time watching mindlessly humorous videos 
of people I didn’t know. 

I finally caved in to the social pressure in 

January 2020 when a friend convinced me to 
get the app on the way back from a Broadway 
performance. Normally after seeing a show, 
I would spend hours examining the details 
from scenic transitions to the melody of a 
single lyric. That night I only spent a brief 

amount of time discussing the show, the 
musical “Jagged Little Pill,” with my friend. 
Once we got back to where we were staying 
on the trip, I sunk into the couch, sucked in 
by the TikTok pull. 

So isn’t it ironic that the very app that 

pulled me away from thinking about theatre 
two years ago has ended up being a huge 
force in theatre’s development since the start 
of the COVID-19 pandemic? Somehow an app 
with only a 60-second (and since July 2021, 
three-minute) video time limit has become 
a force in the development of theatre works. 

On Aug. 10, 2021, this development began 

with the post of a video by Emily Jacobsen. 
Jacobsen created an original audio for the 
app of herself singing a self-deemed “love 
ballad” to the rat Remy, the leading character 
in the 2007 fan-favorite Disney movie “Rata-
touille.” As of March 22, 2022, this video has 
1.2 million views and 160.5 thousand likes. 
But the story didn’t stop after just one video. 
On Oct. 19 of that year, Daniel Mertzlufft 
added onto Jacobsen’s original tune in a new 
video. By turning it into what he imagined 
as an Act Two finale song for a Disney-style 

Broadway musical, theatremakers began to 
see this as a project they could piece togeth-
er note by note, costume sketch by costume 
sketch.

Disney Theatrical Group, the producing 

agency wing of the Walt Disney Company, is 
responsible for live performances, plays and 
musicals. To this day they have produced 
over 15 productions, including incredibly 
successful adaptations of animated movies 
such as “Beauty and the Beast,” “The Lion 
King” and “Aladdin.” The rise of Disney on 
Broadway brought about some amazing art 
and important steps forward in the Broad-
way industry, particularly through “The 
Lion King.” Known for its use of innovative 
puppetry to portray the animal characters, 
the broadway adaptation took home six Tony 
Awards the year it opened in 1997. Director 
Julie Taymor became the first woman in the 
history of the award show to win in the Best 
Direction of a Musical category. The musical 
still plays to Broadway audiences today, with 
over 9,000 performances under its belt.

The Surprise B-Side

Musical theatre magic happens on a screen too, 

not just onstage

Why I hate classic
 rom-com endings

ROM-COMS ARE THE film 

equivalent of comfort foods. They 
may not be everyone’s cup of tea, 
but their predictable nature and 
formulaic plots lend themselves 
well to staying within the bounds 
of audience expectations. At the 
end of the day you’ll laugh, cry and 
sit with the heart-warming feeling 
of a love story turning out precisely 
as it should. Now I’m not really a 
huge fan of the romantic comedy 
genre, but I’ve begun to realize that 
it’s not so much the romance that 
I’m averse to, but the predictabil-
ity. Nearly all of the great romantic 
comedies that have stayed with me 
are the ones that defy these sorts 
of expectations, wherein the film’s 
final moments, they simply don’t 
end up together. 

To clarify, I’m not here to rant 

about the failings of the modern-
day rom-com or shame cheesy 
romance movie lovers, because 
I promise you I get the appeal. 
I understand the familiarity of 
watching a movie you know like the 
back of your hand, of drifting off on 
the couch and waking up an hour 
later without having missed all 
that much. Evidently, the romance 
genre excels in this domain of 
expected endings; most of us have 
experienced crying our hearts out 
and sitting with a warm contented 
feeling in our chest at the sight of 
the quintessential climactic airport 
scene or something as wholeheart-
edly profound as “a girl standing 
in front of a boy asking him to love 
her.”

There’s something inherently 

special to me when a rom-com 
strays from this path and actively 
subverts the age-old, tried and 
true formula. It’s a bold move, one 
that the writers must recognize 
as being instinctually upsetting 
to much of its audience. But when 
it’s a well-thought-out decision, it 
almost always feels right, one that 
I would argue pulls at your heart-
strings even more than the cop-out 
of a last-second death or uncharac-
teristic proclamation of love. After 
watching and reading romance 
after romance that trains you to put 
your full faith in the inevitable fate 
of the Hollywood ending and the 
way things were supposed to turn 
out, I find myself drawn to the ones 
that wreak havoc on nearly all of 
those preconceived notions and let 
our sorely misplaced projections of 
romance down.

Some of my earliest movie 

memories originate from watching 
Audrey Hepburn (“My Fair Lady”) 
gracefully glide across the screen, 
singing about how “the rain in 
Spain stays mainly in the plain.” In 
the ’50s classic “Roman Holiday,” 
Hepburn as Princess Ann plays 
hooky for the day with an Ameri-
can reporter running around the 
city of Rome. As a kid, I could never 
fully appreciate the final scene, 
the bittersweet longing apparent 
in her fleeting remark of “Rome, 
by all means Rome” as she locks 
eyes with Gregory Peck (“To Kill a 
Mockingbird”) in the crowd.

At this moment, we’re thrust 

back into reality as there’s simply no 
feasible way for it to work out. She’s 
European royalty, he’s an American 
journalist, but the omnipotent cin-
ematic hand guiding their encoun-
ters innocently kindles that inkling 
of hope that it could possibly turn 
out any other way. To this day I still 
can’t quite shake the resolve of the 
film’s ending shot of Peck walking 
away, a sense of finality seeping 
into the echoes of his very foot-
steps. It’s a perfect ending to a per-
fect movie and more importantly, 
it’s befitting to the fleeting nature 
of their relationship and gives Ann 
the capacity to exist outside of the 
confines of their love story.

With “Roman Holiday,” the end-

ing is tinged with sadness, but is 
ultimately pragmatic. I cannot say 
the same for the rollercoaster that 
is “The Philadelphia Story.” Anoth-
er early blueprint in the rom-com 
field, Tracy Lord (Katherine Hep-
burn, “Bringing Up Baby”) spends 
the day before her wedding with 
undercover reporter Mike (James 
Stewart, “It’s a Wonderful Life”). 
All the signs point to a Mike and 
Tracy endgame, yet in quite liter-
ally the last 30 seconds of the film 
she not only jilts her fiancé at the 
altar, but turns down runner-up 
Mike too. In a surprise upset by all 
accounts, she remarries her ex-hus-
band Dexter (Cary Grant, “North 
by Northwest”) and so concludes 
a jaw-dropping resolution to a love 

quadrilateral the audience wasn’t 
even aware of. 

Beyond the shock factor, the end-

ing works so brilliantly because it 
not only leaves viewers in a state of 
laughable bewilderment, but aligns 
with Tracy’s character and flighty 
nature. Who she marries ultimately 
matters very little. What does mat-
ter is her desire to not be placed 
upon a pedestal and perceived as a 
goddess or a queen, which comes to 
fruition in those final moments as 
she proclaims to feel “like a human 
being!” The ending scene preserves 
rather than detracts from the con-
sistency of her characterization 
and establishes the significance of 
having agency over her own love 
life, charismatic Jimmy Stewart be 
damned. 

But Tracy’s capricious tenden-

cies have got nothing on the icon 
that is Holly Golightly (Audrey 
Hepburn, “My Fair Lady”) of 
“Breakfast at Tiffany’s.” If you’ve 
seen it, you’re probably shaking 
your head at the thought of the 
movie’s ending being surprising 
in the slightest, because it’s pretty 
much your standard heartfelt pro-
fession of love and a proposal, fol-
lowed by a dramatic kiss in the rain 
(they weren’t exactly reinventing 
the wheel here). The film is adapted 
from Truman Capote’s short story 
of the same name, of which there 
are some minor variations that 
attest to a far from G-rated inter-
pretation of Holly. Yet the main 
difference is in the story’s close, in 
which Holly leaves her cat behind, 
flies off to South America and is 
never seen by the protagonist again. 

Now hear me out: that is how the 

film should have ended. The forced 
Hollywood ending manifested a 
romance where there wasn’t one 
and wholly disregarded Holly as a 
character. Even in the ending taxi 
scene, her dialogue is line-for-line 
from the original text as she repeat-
edly states her desire to not be caged 
in by a life of personal attachments. 
But in the film, the protagonist’s 
response twists her words, caus-
ing the audience to read her, albeit 
unpredictable and careless, actions 
as a cry for help; as if love was a void 
in her heart in need of fixing, that 
she was somehow in need of fixing. 
Capote’s Holly is an undoubtedly 
damaged and self-centered per-
son; confining the magnificence 
that is Hepburn’s performance of a 
woman of her own devices to that of 
a helpless heroine is why we sit and 
watch rom-coms earnestly expect-
ing the female lead to compromise 
herself, her sense of independence 
and agency, for the sake of a love 
story that renders her second-class 
to the male protagonist’s newfound 
attachment to her. 

I’ll always love “Breakfast at 

Tiffany’s,” but I’ll never be able to 
content myself with its unchar-
acteristically 
over-romanticized 

ending. Even if it was done purely 
as an appeal to mass audiences at 
the time, it’s a dishonor to Capote’s 
work: an examination of a spectac-
ularly selfish female character that 
loves and cares for no one but her-
self. And sure, even in the original 
we’re delimited to viewing Holly 
through the lens of a male narra-
tor’s platonic love for her, but for 
all the iconic kiss in the rain does to 
Holly, she might as well have been 
hit by that taxi. It’s the effective 
death of her character and all that 
she stands for. Because in terms of 
the romantic female lead’s worth, 
that’s all the viewers care about, 
right? Married or dead?

A similar line of thought mani-

fests in the holy grail of indie rom-
coms, “(500) Days of Summer.” 
It’s questionable as to whether the 
ending can even be considered a 
“surprise,” as it is made abundant-
ly clear from the start that “This 
is not a love story.” When I first 
watched this I thought it was the 
greatest thing I’d ever seen (what 
16-year-old didn’t, honestly), but 
I retrospectively and quite gen-
erously view it as a take on the 
fragile “manic pixie dream girl” 
fantasy too often projected upon 
female love interests. It’s hard not 
to align yourself with Tom (Joseph 
Gordon-Levitt, 
“Inception”), 
to 

feel your heart shatter as he visu-
ally plays out his expectations, or 
rather our expectations of how 
their interactions should play out. 
The intricately anachronistic time-
line also aids in Tom’s faulty mem-
ory of events that culminate in the 
genuine shock of Summer (Zooey 
Deschanel, “New Girl”) marrying 
someone else.

Surprise! Your favorite movie is a little bit fascist

Surprises from the man who taught me how to love a good movie

Musings about pop-out cakes

WALT DISNEY, I think, is 

probably more influential than 
Jesus. So why do I feel like crit-
ics shy away from critical analy-
ses of Disney films, especially 
the classics? Just because they 
are cute and enormously popular 
to the point of being mytholo-
gized does not make them safe 
from insufferable people like me. 
In fact, I have never seen a Dis-
ney film in the same light after 
taking U-M class FTVM 333, 
or Fascist Cinemas. My capac-

ity to enjoy these films without 
picking them apart to a pulp has 
significantly reduced. I’m not 
talking about The Lion King — 
that would be too easy — but 
about the much more subtle ways 
that Disney flirts with fascism. 
If your favorite form of escapism 
is a Technicolor song and dance, 
be warned: The innocence of any 
Disney classic crumbles under 
just a little socio-historical scru-
tiny.

Consider the bare-bones plot of 

any Disney fairytale. The protag-
onist — usually a young woman 
— wants relief from her current 
situation, whether she is poor, her 
family is mean to her or her life is 
boring. She is surrounded by cute 
little bunny rabbits and birds as 
she sings about her fantastical 
hopes and dreams. Except they 
aren’t so fantastical, because she 
always gets married in the end, 
hence “happily ever after.” How 
far is this from the myth of the 
American dream? How many 
Disney films can you name that 

don’t have a rags-to-riches story, 
an emphasis on benevolence and 
“good morals” over ambition and 
individualism? 
Furthermore, 

how does this relate to fascism?

“Fascist” might be a flashy 

buzzword, but it shouldn’t be 
thrown around indiscriminately; 
it is a set of ideas, an amalgama-
tion of strategies, that a dictator 
or governing body might employ. 
It’s not just in the leader, though 
— for a society to be considered 
“fascist,” a set of values is deeply 
embedded into its culture. In the 
most simplistic way possible, fas-
cism is characterized by a cult 
of tradition, nationalism, anti-

intellectualism, contempt for the 
weak, selective populism and a 
frustrated middle class. But the 
list goes on. There are ten pil-
lars that contribute towards a 
more general fascism, according 
to Yale professor Jason Stanley’s 
book “How Fascism Works: The 
Politics of Us And Them.” Any of 
history’s fascist dictatorships you 
might think of may use five or six 
or seven of these strategies, but 
not necessarily all of them. In a 
similar fashion, Disney films do 
the same thing.

Of course, I could get specific 

with it. Let’s go back in time to 
1937, the year of “Snow White 
and the Seven Dwarfs.” As a 
juicy time capsule of escapism 
demanded by the Depression-era 
U.S., the film is consistent with 
several of Stanley’s fascist ten-
dencies. Our protagonist, Snow 
White, is a princess by birthright 
but a lowly maid by the order 
of her evil stepmother. But she 
doesn’t mope and whine about 
her situation — instead, our prin-

cess is complacent and pleasant. 
Snow White fits nicely into the 
natural hierarchies of worth 
that a fascist society demands: 
She recognizes that her role as a 
woman is one of submission and 
patience, and as a perfect fascist 
woman she is virtuous and pure. 
The film also makes an “us versus 
them” distinction; the stepmoth-
er-slash-queen is evil because of 
her individualistic values of self-
ishness and ambition, values that 
threaten the altruistic purity of 
Snow White and the rest of the 
“good guys.” And don’t forget the 
dwarfs themselves — Grumpy and 
the other guys are just cartoonish 
iterations of the fascist “every-
man,” with their admirable work 
ethic and apparent infatuation 
with labor. The dwarves valorize 
self-sufficiency and give rise to 
the distinction of hardworking 
versus lazy. “Snow White and 
the Seven Dwarfs” puts forth a 
damning thesis of rural idealism 
and rejection of modernity, a tale 
of happy endings and a mythic 
utopia over a backdrop of tragedy 
and loss of hope during the Great 
Depression.

It doesn’t stop here — ask me 

to consume any piece of media 
that holds significant cultural 
power, and I will find a source 
of propaganda. Don’t even ask 
me about Marvel’s big fat crush 
on the military (surprise, Disney 
also owns Marvel). You might 
be reading this and notice that 
the films I describe as “fascist” 
don’t exactly align with textbook 
examples of fascism. But that’s 
the problem. Fascism is often 
understated. It slips through 
the cracks — it’s something that 
doesn’t get noticed until it’s too 
late, and that’s the point.

Lest we forget that films, 

especially fancy ones from big 
studios, were probably (and still 
might be) the most effective 
mediums of cultural influence. 
Through these films, micro-signs 
of nationalism and indulgences 
in utopia — the core ideas of fas-
cism — are flirting with Ameri-
can audiences. I’m not arguing 
that Disney movies are abundant 
sources of propaganda, but that 
inklings of fascist ideas might 
wriggle their way into our minds 
so that we don’t see much of a 
problem.

WHOEVER SAID “KIDS say the darnd-

est things” has obviously not heard their 
father share personal information before. 
When moving me into my apartment this 
year, my dad walked around the room in 
his self-possessed, serene way, a half-smile 
on his face. Without an ounce of malice, 
he laughed to himself about me, “You’re so 
spoiled. When I was in grad school, I shared 
a room half this size with three roommates. 
We had two beds — whoever got home last 
had to sleep on the air mattress,” adding, 
“the first person home had to make din-
ner.” My father, who would rather enjoy the 
sweet sound of a grating silence than tell me 
about his personal life, let slip a tiny detail 
of his college experience. It was not what I 
expected. 

Most other things I know about my dad’s 

childhood are bits I’ve pieced together, infor-
mation stolen away from family members or 
weaseled out of him while he sat in the pas-
senger seat, tapping out work emails on his 
phone as I drove around to accrue hours 
for my Level 1 driver’s license. Here’s what 
I’ve known for a while: My dad grew up in 
Chennai, India and he skipped two grades 
in school, so he was consistently smaller 
than everyone else in his black and white 

class pictures. From what I understand, he 
and his dad (my grandpa) had a distant rela-
tionship, but they watched movies together 
sometimes.

If you ask me what my favorite movie is, 

I probably won’t tell you the truth in order 
to maintain my (nonexistent) respectability 
in Daily Arts. Well, here it is: I love “Willy 
Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.” I love 
the brightly filtered shots of mountains of 
playfully imagined sweets, worth more than 
the GDP of a small country. There truly is 
no other word to describe the music except 
for charming — the melancholic violins and 
bells ringing with a simplicity that brings 
you back to a sweeter, simpler time, telling 
you how to feel and doing it well. The swirl-
ing, terrifying boat scene montage — which, 
yes, does feature a chicken being beheaded 
— still scares me, but I dreaded the scene 
so much I was curious to see it whenever I 
rewatched the movie, which was often; at 
first at the insistence of my dad, but later it 
was me that began asking that we watch the 
movie more times than I can count. 

Once, when I was in elementary school, he 

mentioned that he watched the film with his 
dad — the only memory he’s shared with me 
of his father. When my dad was 19, he came to 
the unknown (Toledo, Ohio) for grad school. 
My grandpa died shortly after, and my dad 
couldn’t fly back to India for the funeral due 
to his immigration status. When he finally 

made it back a year later, his old dachshund 
ran up to my dad at the front door of his fam-
ily home and collapsed in his arms, dying 
a few minutes later. It’s worlds away from 
what I’ve had to go through, but it seems a 
distance from who he is now as well — my 
dad is just my dad, who loves intentionally 
pronouncing words wrong to irritate every-
one (including me), blasts his Simon & Gar-
funkel music too loud on speakers that he’s 
set up in the basement and buys strawberries 
on his way back from work if he hears that 
I’ve come back home from Ann Arbor.

When I moved back home in the second 

semester of my freshman year of college, 
it was just the two of us, but by then I had 
my own secret. My dad has always hoped 
I would become an engineer, enamored by 
the stability it would give me, but by this 
point, I was staying up late researching how 
to transfer out of the College of Engineer-
ing; I had stopped understanding why it all 
mattered, the physics and math and pro-
gramming. It hit me that this was it, that the 
tangibility of calculating the physical plausi-
bility of structures and taking soil samples 
was what I had chosen to do for the rest of 
my life, instead of learning about the books 
and ideas and people I had always ached to 
know more about. The reverse wasn’t the 
most exciting prospect for my father, who 
has moved the earth and the sky in order for 
me to have a more stable life than he does. 

Maybe a better child would have stuck with 
engineering, but I jumped into aimlessly tak-
ing various classes: environmental science, 
creative writing, anthropology, architecture. 
During the week, we had intense conversa-
tions about my (lack of a) major, but on Sun-
day nights, we took a break: We watched 
movies like “Parasite,” “Knives Out” and 
“Soul,” and would visibly jolt backward dur-
ing jump scares and sit in our basement for a 
while afterward, breaking down the movie, 
and of course, looking up everyone involved 

in the production on Wikipedia. What I don’t 
think my father realizes is that he taught me 
how to love movies, that I learned from him 
— from the man who took me to the library 
on weekends, who bought a Detroit Institute 
of Arts membership so we could go together 
and whose love language is reading Wikipe-
dia articles on authors I offhandedly men-
tion — that sometimes art can say what you 
cannot.

DURING AN EARLY scene in “Singin’ in 

the Rain,” there’s a moment that I’ve always 
found memorable, and mildly confusing. A 
man throwing a party shows off a massive 
cake and tells movie star Don Lockwood 
(Gene Kelly, “An American in Paris”) that 
there’s something “special” about it. And 
then Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds, “How 
the West Was Won”) pops out with a big 
performer’s smile, but when she looks down 
at Don, a man she had literally just rejected 
and lied to and generally belittled out of 
spite for the fact that he was being a jerk, 
her smile fades and is replaced with a look 
of shock.

The idea of a woman popping out of a cake 

being more surprised than the people wit-
nessing said moment is kind of absurd. But 
at the same time, isn’t the idea of a woman 

popping out of a cake already absurd?

It’s a trope that I’ve heard about more 

than witnessed: It happens occasionally in 
the context of celebrity events and histori-
cal parties, as well as films and TV shows 
(including “The Bachelor”). The point here 
is that it’s not a common part of life, but is a 
recognizable trope; if I were to ask someone 
about “those cakes that people jump out of,” 
most people would know what I was talking 
about. There’s a societal understanding or at 
least acknowledgment that pop-out cakes 
exist, and a general association with them 
as signs of surprise, celebration, wealth and 
status.

Truthfully, I can’t believe I haven’t ques-

tioned the idea of pop-out cakes sooner, 
because they are even more bizarre the 
more you think about them. There are so 
many pieces that go into the creation of a 
pop-out cake, and every single one of them 
is strange. As a result, I have a lot of ques-
tions.

Who came up with this?
The answer is apparently the Romans 

— which, unlike someone popping out of a 
cake, is not much of a surprise. It was origi-
nally with pies; it became popular among 
the English to make it appear as if live ani-
mals were popping out of pies (which is how 
we get “four-and-twenty blackbirds”). But 
I more want to know who exactly came up 
with this idea, the same way I want to know 
how someone looked at a pineapple and said, 
“That looks edible!” or how someone looked 
at the sea and said, “This looks like a great 
spot to build Venice.” I want to know who 
looked at a cake and said, “You know what 
would make this better? If it was bigger, but 
instead of more cake, it had a person inside 
of it.” It’s a chain of thoughts that will for-
ever baffle me.

Who even makes these cakes?
In my opinion, it’s not worth asking how 

these cakes are made — there are videos and 
instructions about DIYs on the internet. I’m 

more interested in how it feels to make this 
kind of cake, especially for bakers that are 
making pop-out cakes made of real cake. 
Most pop-out cakes are made of cardboard 
and covered in frosting to make them look 
like real cakes. For a true cake maker, it must 
be humiliating to have your one true passion 
be reduced to making a prop so that some 
rich guy can feel cool when a girl jumps out 
of his cake.

Some of them don’t bother with cake alto-

gether — you can rent fake pop-out cakes for 
a decently steep price. The ones made of 
real cake are even more expensive — which 
means that these bakers are making a cake 
with a giant part of it taken out but charg-
ing more than a fully-intact cake would cost. 
Maybe they’re the real winners here.

If you’re in the cake, how do you know 

when to pop out?

Because I cannot imagine that sound 

travels well through layers of cardboard and 
frosting. Is there a signal, like a musical cue, 

that you have to hit at exactly the right time? 
Obviously being crouched in the sweaty, 
cramped space within the cake would be 
torturous enough, but then there’s the 
attempt to smash through the cake and get 
out gracefully at the exact perfect moment. 
What if you’re too early? It would be simply 
mortifying; a smashed-through pop-out 
cake cannot be un-smashed-through.

Then there’s the other part of it: the 

moment when you emerge. If you’re in the 
unfortunate position of being Kathy Selden, 
you might find yourself face-to-face with a 
very famous man that you just emotionally 
destroyed mere hours before. I don’t know 
who I would expect to see the moment I 
jumped out of the cake, and I can’t imagine 
it would be easy to control my emotions. In 
all truth, Kathy’s only slightly stunned face 
is impressive; I probably would’ve fallen out 
of the cake altogether.

Over the past two years, my vibrant 

paintings have engulfed my once unem-
bellished bedroom wall. Each comes with 
a unique color scheme: from a pale orange 
canvas of Lisa Simpson to soulful butter-
flies flying across a lilac sky. To me, paint-
ing is a therapeutic release that I don’t find 
in other spaces I use for comfort. While I 
often use journaling as an outlet to orga-
nize my thoughts and track my personal 
growth, I find that painting gives me the 
ability to express my emotions and leave 
the experience with a souvenir. I can trace 
a memory back to every one of my pieces 
and the emotions I experienced during its 
creation. Adding onto my wall of paint-
ings has become an incentive for me to 
experience a brief moment of euphoria and 
pride for the art that I made with my own 
vision. It quite literally allows me to bring 
my thoughts into reality. When I paint, I 
find freedom in mixing any color to cre-
ate another. My paintbrush is not capable 
of creating anything but beauty, and I have 
the ultimate autonomy of deciding how 
to personalize my canvas. During 2020, 
I used painting as a fluid art form; it was 
the only aspect that I had control of when 
every other part of my life was thrown in 
disarray during the pandemic.

Since 2020, 17 members of my family 

have tested positive for COVID-19, two of 
whom have died, one of them being my 
grandfather. My grandfather had lived in 
the U.S. with my family since I was born, 
and as a first-generation Asian American, 
I saw him as one of my greatest blessings. 
Having a figure like him present through-
out my life, I learned the importance of 
humility, genuinity, strength and compas-
sion simply by observing him. Between his 
conversations with everyone that entered 
our home, the relationships he built with 

my friends or how he said “God bless you” 
every time he answered and ended a phone 
call, my grandfather set the foundation for 
my values that I still live by.

He also served as a bridge connecting 

both of my cultures — American and Indi-
an. Since visiting India was only possible 
every few years, I relied on my grandfather 
to affirm my Indian identity. The universal 
identity crisis that first-generation Ameri-
cans face is humbling and never-ending, 
but having my grandfather around was 
how I felt enough. With the inability to 
grow up with my family in India, I held 
onto my grandfather as a connection to 
my culture. Practicing Telugu with him, 
listening to his stories from his childhood 
or even teaching him about Thanksgiving 
and other American traditions gave me 

a balance that I couldn’t find on my own. 
Losing him meant losing my immediate 
sense of cultural identity. When he passed 
away, I struggled with losing someone so 
sacred to my heart, as well as my under-
standing of who I was. 

Grieving the death of a loved one is hard 

in itself, but grieving someone through 
a pandemic is a slap in the face. Going to 
the grocery store, making plans with my 

best friends or even stepping outside for a 
walk has trapped me in an endless bubble 
of fear. Will I encounter the virus today? 
Will I see someone, who saw someone, 
who tested positive? I hope I don’t expose 
my family. Dealing with anxiety my whole 
life, I’ve leaned on my friends for support 
and surrounded myself with the things I 
love to do when things get rough. But even 
this form of comfort was taken away from 
me. How was I supposed to do that when I 
was in my room trying to do anatomy labs 
over Google Meets and adjust to the pos-
sibility of encountering the virus if I left 
my house? I was trapped in a state of con-
stant movement and change. I needed time 
to stay still for just a moment to process 
my grief, but instead, the pandemic intro-
duced so much disturbance in my life that 

I simply didn’t have the energy to experi-
ence; I just had to get through each day. 

While this was the ugliest time in my 

life, it enabled me to create the most beau-
tiful art. I channeled my grief into paint-
ing as a way to cope with my new reality. 
While painting was not an escape from the 
burden I was bearing, it helped me under-
stand my situation better.

My grandfather’s passing taught me that 

life is a lot like painting on a blank canvas. 
We have an idea of what we want in life, but 
the colors we are given rarely align with 
our wishes. Regardless, we end up finding 
ways to work with our circumstances to 
create a masterpiece. This pandemic will 
eventually come to an end (hopefully). The 
mask mandates will lift (for a final time). 
“Maskfishing” will no longer be an issue 
for Gen Z to consider. Life will go back to 
being somewhat normal. Maybe, even, 
the lingering fear I face when leaving my 
home will disappear as well. But the guilt 
that plagues my mind will forever be a 
part of me. The survivor’s guilt I have had 
throughout this pandemic has been one of 
the biggest roadblocks in my healing pro-
cess. I remember the long-awaited day I 
got my vaccine. Despite my mortal fear 
of needles, I was almost excited to get my 
injection. I remember thinking that finally 
I could hug my friends without having to 
replay and worry about the interaction 
later that night (though later that sense of 
security would prove false). But I found 
myself feeling empty. My first instinct was 
to feel guilty for surviving the pandemic 
while my grandfather wasn’t able to. I con-
stantly question why I’m able to enjoy the 
things that were stripped away from the 
victims of this virus and the families that 
it ran through, and it makes me sick that I 
can’t find an answer.

I write this piece with the newfound 

realization that my survivor’s guilt is unde-
served. Society has failed our communities 
so badly that we’ve convinced ourselves 
that we are deserving of punishment even 
when we are at our most vulnerable states. 
This toxic notion pushes the idea that 
we, as humans, have the duty to continue 
pushing ourselves past awful situations in 
order to prove our worth by being “resil-
ient” in the end. There is no finding beauty 
in this situation, because beauty doesn’t 
exist here. That’s why I found it so incred-
ible when I witnessed the people around 

me create it even amidst the hell we were 
going through.

Before the pandemic, my life was filled 

with familiarity and structure within my 
community at school and my town — from 
my AP Chem lab table, the girl who held 
the door open for me at 7:35 a.m., the Star-
bucks baristas who knew to brew a tall 
salted caramel hot chocolate every time I 
stumbled in with my backpack to my four 
best friends who saw me every day after 
school. The pandemic put my personal 
issues into perspective as I heard stories 
about the 400,000 families who also lost 
a member to COVID-19, friends of mine 
whose parents had lost their jobs and those 
struggling with their mental health. I 
finally grasped the idea that every commu-
nity member of my previously structured 
life, from my favorite Starbucks barista to 
my lab partner, was also forced to work 
with a blank canvas. Social media became 
a new place of unison for these members 
of my community; I witnessed them post 
updates on their health anxiety, how they 
implemented family walks into their daily 
routine or how they experimented with 
new hobbies. It was during this time that 
each of our individually complicated lives 
became the most similar as we all sought 
to “create art” amidst our personal strug-
gles. 

My community showed me that in 

pressing times like this pandemic, humans 
have the same capacity to experience joy 
as we do pain. What surprised me, though, 
was how natural recovery seems to be. 
Watching many of the people around me 
being thrown into a realm of the unknown 
and still making the most of their situation 
showed me that while I am not obligated to 
find the silver lining in all of my losses, it’s 
pretty amazing that somehow I can. And 
discovering this ability is when we begin to 
create each of our own masterpieces.

Te voy a contar una historia…

Una historia de muchas lágrimas

Mis lágrimas y

Las lágrimas de mi familia 

Una historia de mi vida
Una parte de mi vida 


Que me va a tomar años para entender 

Años, años y años

Pero 

Es parte del viaje 

Acompañeme 

For the first time ever in my life, I embarked 

on a trip 20 years in the making: I set foot into 
the country of Mexico.

The country I dreamed of visiting since I 

was a tree-climbing toddler, theater perform-
ing teenager and now an anxious, stressed out 
young adult. Dreams that started in my child-
hood bedroom back in Wyoming, MI, created 
in the twin bed with the Spider-Man sheets. 
During my adulthood, I was still that small 
Mexican boy with caramel skin and shaggy 
hair that dreamt about visiting Mexico, living 
with that childlike wonder and waiting for the 
day I would see Mexico in all its glory…

What does Mexico look like? 
What does Mexico smell like?
What does Mexico feel like?

Since I was a little kid, I always knew I 

was Mexican. I spoke Spanish at home, I ate 
Mom’s spicy enchiladas, I learned that my 
parents were immigrants from Mexico and 
how to navigate life under these circumstanc-

es. I went to quinceañeras, feeling the boom-
ing bass in my heart, and ate all the wonder 
pan dulce. These things were normal to me 
because it was all I knew, but this understand-
ing of my identity had always been something 
in my peripheral mind. 

I remember the day when I discovered how 

much culture I truly held. 

I was in third grade and it was like any other 

day. During our usual snack break, I pulled 
three items out of my lunch box: a banana, 
Tajín y mi concha…

Three of my favorite foods in the entire world!

I peeled the banana, popped the cap off my 

Tajín bottle, sprinkled the seasoning on the 
top of the banana and took one big bite. Once 
I finished eating the banana, I took another 
bite of the chocolate concha. As I finished 
my lunch, my teacher walked up behind me 
to peer over my shoulder and with a curious 
voice, she asked, 

“What’s that?”
I shifted my body to quickly inform her,
“It’s a concha! And this is my Tajín! What, 

you don’t know what this is?”

I was astonished that she didn’t know 

what I was eating. This was my normal, and 
I had to realize that other people didn’t eat 
my “normal.” I remember little Pablo feeling 
a bit perplexed, but also filled with a belly full 
of pride. At an early age, I was proud of my 
Mexican heritage and cherished the food I 
brought to class. All the other kids were eat-
ing their lunchables, peanut butter jelly sand-
wiches and other classic American lunchtime 
favorites, but there I was enjoying my favorite 
foods….

Un platano

Un poquito de Tajín y

Una concha

Eso era mi lonche

There were even times before school where 

I would join my mom in delivering lunch to my 
dad during work… 

Una torta con frijoles, Aguacate y

Una Coca-Cola 
Eso era su lonche 

Even with all this self-admiration I had 

in third grade, growing up in America, there 
were times when my Mexican identity was 
questioned. 

Growing up in the U.S., I thought to myself…

Am I Mexican enough?

What a silly question! But this silly question 

stuck with me — especially when it came to 
my Spanish speaking abilities. 

I spoke Spanish at home with my parents 

and in other settings when visiting our family 
friends, but for the most part I primarily spoke 
English. I’m the youngest out of my siblings, 
and I always knew that my Spanish was not 
the strongest out of the bunch. 

In high school, some kids would tease me 

and my Spanish by calling me a “gringo.” Now 
the word gringo can have multiple meanings, 
and it isn’t always used as an offensive word. 
It can refer to a traveler, a person of foreign 
birth, a person who doesn’t speak Spanish or 
Hispanics that speak very little Spanish or 
aren’t in touch with their Latino roots. Still, 
I never liked being described as a gringo 
because I knew personally that I was tapped 
into my Mexican roots to the best of my abili-

ties. Though it was a surface level comment 
that people would use against me, I would still 
think to myself…

Am I Mexican enough? 

Despite these incessant doubts about my 

identity brought about by living in the U.S., the 
dreams of visiting Mexico that were imagined 
from my Spider-Man bed all those years ago 
never faded. 

And this spring, those childhood dreams 

finally became a reality: I visited Mexico, 
consequently gaining new confidence in my 

native tongue, and more significantly, my 
Mexican identity.

From the moment I entered the Benito 

Juarez International Airport en la Ciudad de 
México, I was in a country that felt so familiar 
yet so different. My brain was trying to make 
sense of where I was because I couldn’t believe 
I had actually arrived. It was only four hours 
earlier that I was back in the cold Chicago 

dawn saying goodbye to my parents. Then in 
the blink of an eye, I was waiting in the immi-
gration line to officially check into Mexico.

My Tío picked us up from the airport and 

took us on a speedy tour of Mexico city in 
his car. He insisted that we had to do a bit of 
sightseeing before we headed to my Abuelita’s 
casa. As we were swerving through traffic and 
dodging the hectic drivers, he talked about the 
history of Mexico City: how it was built on a 
giant lake, the history of the ancient Aztec civ-
ilization and much much more. He was giving 
me a whole history lesson and I was absolutely 
loving it. 

I was listening to every word he was saying 

with the biggest smile across my face. While 
he focused on getting us home in one piece, 
talking as he was making turns and shifting 
into different gears, my face was lit up, staring 
and listening to him talk about Mexico with 
such passion.

As a product of the time I spent counting 

my calories, weighing myself twice a day 
and cutting out major food groups from 
my diet, I could tell you a dozen different 
ways to turn a rice cake into a slightly less 
bland “meal” or how to make cauliflower 
rice taste almost like the real deal. I could 
tell you exactly how many calories are in 
a serving of rice and exactly how many 
grams of protein are in a cup of yogurt. 
“Clean eating” dominated my Instagram 
explore page and TikTok feed until I was 
spending hours in the grocery store read-
ing ingredient lists and nutrition labels 
every time I needed to buy something. 

There’s a fixation on cleanliness that 

dominates diet culture today. No longer 
are we in the era of keto diets or fat-free 
chips. Instead, we’re told to cook without 
oil, to cut out dairy and gluten and pro-
cessed foods. To never drink alcohol and 
to live and breathe green smoothies and 
salad bowls. I tried, with great effort, to 
achieve the aura of cleanliness and light 
that seemed to saturate the women I fol-
lowed on social media, an aura that they 
told me came from their diets. Clean eat-
ing told me to focus on protein, but only in 
the form of chicken breast or tofu nuggets. 

It told me that carbs make you fat — unless 
it’s oatmeal or quinoa — and that oils and 
sauces were my worst enemy. Most impor-
tantly, it told me that if I wanted to be like 
the girls I followed, there was a select 
group of food options I had to choose from 
… and Chinese food was certainly not 
included.

For context, my family’s primary love 

language is food. On nights I was up late 
studying in high school, my mother would 
bring a plate of cut-up fresh fruit to my 
room. My Ayi made me a homecooked 
meal everyday after school from grades 
K-12: xucài ròushí mian (pickled mus-
tard greens and pork noodle soup), jiozi 
(dumplings) and yóufàn (savory sticky 
rice), sunlàtng (hot and sour soup) and 
xiobáicài (sauteed baby bok choy). Once 
in ninth grade, I told her that I loved Asian 
pears and now every year when they’re in 
season, she buys me boxes and boxes of 
them (I would never tell her that I don’t 
really love them anymore). My grandmoth-
er has arthritis and can’t stand for too long 
without needing to rest, but she still makes 
me soup when I’m sick and mfn (sauteed 
rice noodles) on the nights before I go back 
to school because she heard that it’s my 
favorite recipe of hers. I grew up on Chi-
nese food from my grandmother’s kitchen, 
the restaurants Ayi’s sister worked at and 
the supermarkets where I had thirty aun-

ties who would give me free mochi and 
Choco-pies. For a family that struggles to 
show affection in a conventional way, I’ve 
never doubted that I am truly and deeply 
loved, a sentiment communicated through 
our sharing of food. 

My family’s cooking has always been a 

source of pride for me. I thought of them 
as artists and musicians in the kitchen, 
creating colorful, intricate dishes from the 
simplest ingredients. When I was in third 
grade, I promised my Ayi that when I grew 
up and had my own money, I would buy 
her her own restaurant so that everyone 
could eat the food I loved so much. How-
ever, I quickly learned that others saw 
my culture’s food not as something to be 
revered, but something to be corrected.

In 2019, Arielle Haspel, a white health 

and nutrition coach, opened her own Chi-
nese restaurant named “Lucky Lee’s” in 
an attempt to do just that. The restaurant’s 
logo was adorned with chopsticks and 
a lotus flower painting decorated a wall 
inside (points for cherry-picking what fits 
her Orientalist aesthetic). When promot-
ing her restaurant, Haspel described her 
vision as a ‘clean’ version of Chinese cui-
sine, one that would be accessible to her 
and her food-sensitive clients. She boasted 
that her lo mein would not make you feel 
“bloated and icky” the next day because 
her food would not be “too oily.” Blog posts 

on Haspel’s page mentioned health-ifying 
Chinese food that is usually “doused in 
brown sauces” and makes your eyes puffy. 
Upon facing backlash, Haspel defended 
herself by asserting that her mantra of 
clean eating is “all about finding a health-
ier alternative to your favorite indulgent 
food,” regardless of what cuisine that food 
was associated with. This pseudo-apology 
for offending the Chinese community 
failed to address how all of her “clean eat-
ing” marketing carried the glaringly obvi-
ous connotation that Chinese food in and 
of itself is dirty and unhealthy. By default, 
this response also failed to address the 
historical association of whiteness with 
cleanliness and Color with uncleanliness.

There’s nothing wrong with the concept 

of a Chinese restaurant tailored to those 
with dietary restrictions. Creating gluten-
free, dairy-free or nut-free options, among 
others, is a great, inclusive idea. But you 
know what? I actually don’t even want to 
give Haspel that one, because my sister’s 
favorite restaurant when we were kids 
was a Chinese-owned, vegan Chinese res-
taurant. So it’s not an innovative idea then, 
because shocker! Chinese food is more 
than orange chicken and chow mein. My 
frustration with this restaurant doesn’t 
stem from a white woman opening a res-
taurant to serve another country’s cuisine, 
either. Fuchsia Dunlop’s Chinese cook-

books are awesome and delicious. Instead, 
my frustration stems from a white woman 
implying that Chinese food has something 
to be cured.

Haspel’s visions of “fixing” Chinese 

food are hardly novel. Chinese food’s orig-
inal bogeyman, MSG, has been demonized 
since the 60s. There is no scientific evi-
dence that MSG has negative health effects 
and yet, the term Chinese Restaurant Syn-
drome was coined in 1969 to describe the 
alleged burning and chest-pain inducing 
effects of MSG. In the 1990s, the FDA con-
cluded that MSG is safe for consumption. 
But still, MSG continues to be vilified in 
the food industry and used to uphold the 
image of Chinese food as unhealthy and 
unclean. Anyway, MSG is in ranch dress-
ing which is like, the most American thing 
I can think of.

To counter Haspel’s assertions about 

Chinese food and its alleged bloating prop-
erties, as well as the xenophobic under-
tones of our society having a term called 
“Chinese Restaurant Syndrome,” allow me 
to walk you through a “what I eat in a day” 
in the life of a K-12 me. While much of Chi-
nese cuisine might fall into whatever fad 
diet is trending at the moment, it already 
has universal health benefits that I’m glad 
to be acquainted with in my everyday life.

“I want the tall Mexican kid!” 

Nobody moved from the pickup bas-
ketball line. Every player’s eyes were 
suddenly searching for this elusive, 
presumably Hispanic guy so the game 
could start. 

“You, dude, YOU” an impatient fin-

ger points directly at me, the exaspera-
tion clear in my temporary teammate’s 
voice. 

“Uh… I’m not Mexican,” I awkwardly 

reply.

“Yeah, yeah no hablo Español moth-

erfucker. Just get on my team.” 

Uncomfortable laughter erupts. I 

trot over to my temporary team. 

As hilariously offensive as this 

exchange was, it may be familiar to 
many ethnically ambiguous Ameri-
cans like me. I have learned repeat-
edly throughout my life that if someone 
doesn’t know what “group” you belong 
to, they’ll be sure to put you in one.

I am not entirely sure when I first 

became aware of my “race”, or even 
when I realized that race was some-
thing that mattered. Perhaps it was one 
of the times some random white per-
son thought it was a good idea to ask 
if I was adopted when I was out with 
my dad. Truly crucial information for 
her to go about her day. Maybe it was 
the hundreds of times I got the “Where 
are you really from?” question. That 
one is always a favorite. An even better 
rendition is the “Is it ok if I ask what 
your race is?” … Uh, I guess so dude? 
Or maybe it was getting called racial 
slurs at summer camp. Sailing camp in 
North Carolina turned out to be a dubi-
ous idea at best. 

If you’re even slightly melanated, you 

may also have a number of awkward, 
hilarious and/or offensive exchang-
es imprinted in your memory. There 
comes a point, whether it be middle 
school, elementary or even Pre-K, that 
the white majority of the U.S. stamps 
you with an otherness that is seem-
ingly impossible to escape. There is 
something undeniably American about 
a knee-jerk desire to compartmentalize 
racial and ethnic groups. A desire that 
is not born from curiosity or genuine 
interest in other cultures or histories, 
but from a need to organize. An atti-
tude that says, “once I find out your 
‘group’ I’ll know how I can treat you.”

Throughout a life full of “Which one 

of your parents is white?” and “Are 
you allowed to say the N-word?” and 
“Where did you get your tan?”, I’ve 
learned that it’s some combination of 
unsettling and intriguing for many to 
see me and not be able to immediately 
allocate me to some region of heritage. 
I could be Latinx, European, African, 
Middle Eastern, you name it! I’m a nosy 
white lady’s worst nightmare. 

An interesting social phenomenon 

I’ve noticed is the hesitation in the 
questions — the faux uneasiness in ask-
ing. It’s as though it’s polite to be on the 
fence before asking an inherently rude 
question. Look, I know you don’t real-
ly care about my comfort, so you may 
as well just ask away. The truth is — I 
don’t really mind when people ask any-
more. I have no problem simply shrug-
ging or walking away from rude or 
inconsiderate people, or even making 
up an outlandish answer to cue them in 
on their own weirdness. “Oh yeah I’m 
from Sweden, I just tan really easily.” 
As I have gotten older, I have come to 
learn that I don’t owe anyone answers 
about my personal life or identity. A 
valuable lesson I’ve learned from my 
mom is that if someone takes offense 
to my indifference, then they’re sim-
ply not a person worth talking to in the 
first place.

What I do mind is the fact that I 

don’t even completely know my heri-
tage. Imagine how frustrating it can 
be sometimes. “Hey man, where you 
from from?” I’m not really sure. If nosy 
people at the grocery store are curious, 
just think about what it’s like to look in 
the mirror every day. Where am I from?

I have a vague idea, of course. My 

dad’s side is the simple part, a blend 
of white European immigrants. Along 
with his last name, I inherited a 
healthy dose of Irish-Italian blood, 
thick curly hair and an inability to 
dance. My mom’s side is where things 
get complicated, a mixed bag if ever 
there was one. She has seven siblings 
and each one looks to be from differ-
ent area codes, longitudes, latitudes 
and continents. Every family member 
is essentially a surprise. Uncle Doug 
is undoubtedly a Black man, but Aunt 
Tony-Girl is a pale amber and everyone 
thinks my mom looks like Jeanie Boulet 
from “ER.” My sister and I carried on 
that legacy, it would seem. She’s fairer 
than me, with blonde hair and blue eyes 
no less. One family, same genes, just a 
cocktail of phenotypic expressions and 
confused nosy neighbors. 

Don’t get me wrong, curiosity has 

gotten the better of me many times. It’s 
frustrating that I couldn’t fully escape 
the culture of ascription that sur-
rounds me, but my identity is important 
for more reasons than being able to tell 
people about it when they ask. Identi-
ty is as personal as a name or a laugh. 
While it’s annoying and disheartening 
that a made-up construct like race is 
intrinsic to its construction, as long as 
it is I will always wonder exactly who, 
what and where I am composed of.

There is comfort in racial and eth-

nic identity. Pride. There is a fond-
ness and security I see others have 
that I wish I could in many ways. I’m 
proud to be a member of my family, 
and I’m proud to call myself a person 
of Color, but the tension that comes 
with my ambiguity extends beyond 
my interactions with white people. 
What struggles am I allowed to par-
ticipate in — allowed to feel as though 
they apply to me? I’ve been discrimi-
nated against and suffered both micro 
and macro-aggressions because of my 

skin, but I’ve also had people of Color 
tell me that they consider me white. It 
seems that no matter what, ascriptive 
culture has me at a loss. I know that I 
have African American heritage, but I 
am by no means a Black man. I know 
that I am related by blood to members 
of the Ramapough Lenape Nation, but 
nothing of my upbringing or famil-
ial culture was by any means Native 
American. The Ramapough Lenape 
themselves are a wonderful combina-
tion of Native, Dutch and Freed people, 
so no luck there if I wanted a concrete 
group of origin. What a headache! The 
more I learn about my history, the more 
blended it becomes. I wish it was as 
simple as just asking my mom, but that 

always got me some version of the same 
disappointing answer. 

“You’re an American Stephen, who 

cares!” 

The first time I had that conversa-

tion with my mom, I was endlessly 
frustrated. I know I’m an American. 
Culturally and physically, I fit right 
into the romanticized melting pot that 
this country so often fails to live up 
to. Although I wish it wasn’t the case 
that the closest identity marker I’d get 
would be so inherently problematic, it 
is evident that being an American isn’t 
even something to be proud of. I was 
born in Long Island, raised in Mary-
land (though I claim D.C.) and deeply 
appreciate the art, food, music and 
culture I grew up with. However, this 
country’s history is full of targeted 
violence and systemic oppression that 
directly brought about this “melting 
pot” that many revere and praise. Hav-
ing an already tainted image of this 
country given its oppressive history, 
it was disheartening to be the physical 
manifestation of a rhetoric that’s sim-

ply tokenizing. Being an “American” 
felt trivial and at odds with my person-
al values. I wanted to know where the 
melanin was from, my non-whiteness. 
So much of American culture tells me 
that due to my skin tone, being “Ameri-
can” must only be part of the story. 
Everyone and their racist grandma 
wants to know, so I figured I ought to 
figure it out. 

I routinely had this conversation 

with my mom several years in a row 
around Christmas time. I would ask for 
an Ancestry.com or 23andMe test and 
each time I was met with reluctance 
or chiding rebuttal. “It’s not like you 
as a person will change in any way. It 
doesn’t matter as much as you think it 

does.” How could it not matter? How 
could I exist in this ambiguous space 
without grounding, without a broader 
community? If I’m going to be bothered 
so often, at least let me know who the 
“others” I can relate to are! I’ve often 
been envious of people who are able 
to call a group their own, who belong 
somewhere in a way I often feel as 
though I don’t. 

However, with each passing year, I 

believe that I see more nuances to my 
mom’s philosophy. I think I am slowly 
learning that her answer isn’t just her 
being dismissive or flippant, and isn’t 
necessarily to say that my racial or eth-
nic identity doesn’t matter. It is in part 
a rejection of this culture of ascription 
that detracts from meaningful inter-
action, and in larger part an explana-
tion that the nuances of my identity are 
truly as American as it gets. I believe 
that my mom’s interpretation is her 
protecting my peace, and I will for-
ever appreciate that. The idea of a 
hodgepodge person born from genera-
tions of cultural and ethnic plurality 
is a noble one. As I get older, I notice I 
take more and more pride in that idea 
of my identity. I think that I still have 
more capacity for appreciation of my 
existence and am interested in seeing 
how that appreciation grows in five or 
ten years. While feelings of insecurity 
and curiosity are sure to reappear from 
time to time, I feel blessed to be in such 
a unique position.

I’m an American in the sense that I’m 

just some guy. To my mom’s chagrin, 
I’m sure I’ll do some ancestry program 
at some point to get the percentages 
in my head because I’m obsessive like 
that, but my initial reasoning for get-
ting the statistics has evolved. I no 
longer care about changing my life or 
attitude to fit those numbers as I once 
did. A naive and immature perspective 
of social readjustment has grown into 
a more three-dimensional appreciation 
of my specific heritage. I’m not going to 
take on new dimensions of my identity 
or ~get in touch with my roots~. I don’t 
intend to adjust my self-perception 
based on newly discovered pieces of my 
history. I’ll still shrug off nosy people 
and continue to make up answers for 
my amusement when I get asked about 
my skin. I’ll simply have the privilege of 
knowing a little bit more about myself 
and move on trying to be the best per-
son I can be. I’ll continue to take pride 
as a hodgepodge person because that’s 
how I identify.

“Why do you treat me so horren-

dously?” a voice called out. Upon hear-
ing this, the young girl froze motionless 
on the pavement. She stood facing away 
from a woman more than 20 years her 
senior several feet behind her, who 
held tightly onto a stroller — having 
just cathartically confronted the young 
girl on her passive-aggressive actions 
over the past year. The young girl was 
shocked as the woman almost always 
met her dismissive attitudes and snark-
iness with gracious tolerance. The two 
stood in utter silence until the girl’s 
baby sister cooed for their attention, 
blissfully unaware of the atmosphere of 
brewing anger and conflict or the long-
standing discord between her sister and 
the woman.

That young girl was 11-year-old me, 

and the woman was Pei, our live-in 
maid who was employed by my family 
a decade ago, back when we were liv-
ing in Beijing. Due to its acute intensity, 
that confrontation is but a distant and 
blurred memory of mine. However, the 
profound conflict we had and the naive 
cruelty I had demonstrated during the 
year she inhabited our home still occu-
pies a dark corner of my brain, tucked 
away in a vast library of my memories, 
and still haunts me to this day. The 
dimmed details and incentives behind 
this ingenuous cruelty of mine had 
grown lucid as I became increasingly 
aware of China’s policies; ones that sus-
tained wealth inequality and inequity 
that dictate the lives of women like Pei 
over the course of modern Chinese his-
tory.

Pei was in her mid-30s when she was 

hired to help my mother with house-
hold duties after my sister’s birth in 
Beijing, far away from her husband who 
still resided in her hometown in the 
country. My family stood in a position 
of privilege from the get-go: my mother 
was a part of the diminutive percent-
age of women who were able to afford 
a maid to aid with chores and child care 
and my father was among the smidgen 
of men who could afford never learn-
ing to drive, instead opting for drivers 
to take him to work and airports. Pei’s 
work consisted of shopping for grocer-
ies, cooking, cleaning, taking care of my 

baby sister and any other miscellaneous 
tasks around the house. 

I can’t quite recall when I started see-

ing her signature old, pilling red sweat-
er float by as she cooked, scrubbed and 
swept all over the house every day. Pei 
was a tall woman with broad shoulders. 
She had freckles and tan skin, and con-
stantly wore her hair in a simple pony-
tail that I always assumed was for the 
purposes of her labor-intensive work. I 
don’t ever recall seeing her hands rest-
ing: they were either submerged in salt 
water, purging sand out of clams that 
would eventually end up as our din-
ner, or squeezing the cleaning solu-
tion out of a terry cloth to deep-clean 
a variety of surfaces around the house. 
As a result, her hands were wrinkled 
with dry patches. Juxtaposed with my 
mother’s pale and supple hands, nour-
ished in L’Occitane hand cream and 
La Roche-Posay sunscreen, her hands 
invoked a slight sense of disgust in me. 
As an 11-year-old, I was just beginning 
to comprehend the fact that I was far 
more financially privileged than a lot 
of my peers who stood in awe at my 
mother’s pampered beauty and fashion, 
which I took great pride in. Therefore, 
I gradually began associating the pol-
ished feminine stillness demonstrated 
by my mother, who was scouted as an 
actress and model in her younger years, 
with desirability and associating rug-
ged appearances with Pei’s infelici-
tous physical labor, which I had looked 
down upon. Unbeknownst to me at the 
time, despite being a full-fledged indi-
vidual of her own, Pei’s upbringing, her 
socioeconomic status and work were all 
influenced by China’s history of misog-
yny and classist policies that prevented 
upward mobility. Based on this history, 
I try, now, to piece together parts of 
Pei’s life.

My mother and Pei perfectly exem-

plified the clash between newly import-
ed “white” femininity coinciding with 
the economic boom at the end of the 
20th century that ushered in a new age 
of capitalism and traditional rural Chi-
nese femininity. In the 80’s, during Pei’s 
childhood and adolescence, billboards 
of double-eyelidded models with ghost-
ly white skin and dyed chocolate brown 
hair gradually emerged in cityscapes, 
and the ancient gender role of women as 
the sole conductor of exhaustive house-
hold chores who needed to give birth to 

as many farm hands as possible persist-
ed in the countryside. 

The ever-popular folktale of the 

cowherd and the weaver girl perfectly 
illustrates the gender roles mapped out 
by thousands of years of Chinese his-
tory characterized by the division of 
work in an agricultural setting. For one, 
sex had always been a taboo subject, 
with feminine modesty being a much-
praised virtue: according to this out-
dated cultural framework, the weaver 
girl was forced to accept the cowherd’s 
marriage proposal as he had seen her 
naked body as she bathed in the river. 
The weaver girl, despite her status as a 
literal goddess, took on domestic work, 
consisting of weaving, cooking, clean-
ing and, of course, child-rearing, birth-
ing the cowherd, a mere mortal, two 
children. Unsurprisingly, regardless of 
the picture-perfect domestic bliss of 
the farmhand household, the weaver 
girl was punished for marrying a mor-
tal and neglecting her divine tasks of 
cloud-weaving, forever destined to be 
separated from the rest of her family in 
heaven. To me, the folktale illustrates a 
concealed culturally misogynistic urge 
to punish women for men’s wrongdo-
ings and an inability to balance domes-
tic and work duties that translates in 
both urban and rural settings.

This cultural misogyny reflected in 

the folktale was certainly exacerbated 
by poverty and a population boom. Pei is 
but a grain of sand in a sea of hundreds 
of millions of women falling victim to 
the national ailment of women’s ambi-
tions being suppressed due to misogyny 
and poverty. Unbeknownst to most, 
before the one-child policy was imple-
mented in 1980, Chinese women were 
actually encouraged by Mao to have as 
many children as possible in an effort 
to expand the workforce and military. 
In fact, my four grandparents who were 
born in the 40’s shortly before Mao was 
elected into office had two, five, seven 
and eight siblings, respectively. There-
fore, we can reasonably infer that as a 
result of Mao’s encouragement and a 
long-running cultural norm of birthing 
as many children as possible, Pei likely 
had several siblings. 

Despite decades of unrest and cul-

tural change that preceded the 80’s, 
the sentiment depicted in the folktale 
retained its cultural imprint; its misog-
yny passed through the stagnant pov-

erty that still plagued Chinese society 
despite the rampant urbanization and 
economic boom that stemmed from a 
growing workforce from China’s sky-
rocketing population. This misogyny 
was especially prevalent in rural areas 
as agricultural work still overwhelm-
ingly required physical labor desig-
nated for men. Thus, rural women were 
relegated to tasks akin to those of the 
weaver girl’s, without financial com-
pensation and within the confines of 
the house or nearby areas. 

In cities, by contrast women such as 

my mother were more likely to receive 
a high-quality education. They discov-
ered newfound opportunities such as 
retail, factory and even corporate work 
that provided them some level of finan-
cial independence. By the late 1980s, 
the ratio of the average income of Chi-
na’s richest 20% to poorest 80% had 
more than doubled since the late 1970s, 
from 2.5:1 to almost 6:1. In 1980, China’s 
rural per capita net income was a mea-
ger 191.33 yuan, which is around $161 in 
today’s USD. Assuming Pei’s family had 
a yearly income somewhere near that, 
there was certainly not enough money 
to finance all of her siblings’ educa-
tions. If her family did have enough 
money, it is not so farfetched to assume 
Pei’s parents had spent it on her broth-
ers, as they were the designated “cow-
herds” of the family.

To make matters worse, even if Pei 

did receive an education, it would not 
have been enough to lay the foundation 
for her success later in life. In the early 
1980s, just 60 to 70% of Chinese chil-
dren made it through elementary school 
and continued onto middle school, and 
the figure was likely much lower in 
rural areas. Even more dishearteningly, 
education was few and far between back 
then, requiring children to hike great 
distances across China’s mountainous 
rural regions to enter a school house 
with little food, school supplies or other 
resources that facilitated learning. It 
was far more likely that a young girl like 
Pei would stay home to help her mother 
with household chores, instead of going 
through hell 250 days a year to pursue a 
relatively poor education if she was des-
tined to be married off to a “cowherd” 
later on in life anyway.

Even if by some miracle Pei had made 

it to high school, the rigged rules of the 
Gaokao, China’s college entrance exam, 

would have likely prevented her from 
escaping poverty. Perhaps Pei, by some 
blessed silver lining, may have pushed 
through unimaginable difficulties to 
make it to college in another city. How-
ever, I know that in reality, this is highly 
unlikely due to the many inequities fac-
ing rural students. There is, of course, 
the obvious lack of high-quality edu-
cation, poverty and pressures brought 
upon by Gaokao. As if rural students 
weren’t already at a disadvantage, the 
cutoff score to enter into universities 
is often higher for them than it is for 
local urban students in a gruesome act 
of institutionalized oppression. This is 
because, according to journalist Yiqin 
Fu, “universities located in Beijing will 
reserve more spots for students with 
Beijing hukou (residency);” thus, the 
lowest qualifying score for a Beijing-
based test-taker may be vastly lower 
than the score required from a student 
taking the examination in rural areas. 
When you consider that wealthier 
Chinese families with more resources 
are better positioned to enlist tutor-
ing assistance, preparation courses 
and a whole host of other investments 
designed to increase a student’s score, 
’80s and present-day students residing 
in rural areas barely even had a fight-
ing chance at achieving the same level 
of success as their urban counterparts.

Regardless of Pei’s educational sta-

tus, China’s aforementioned Hukou pol-
icy restricts population flow from rural 
to urban areas. Workers like Pei, who 
look to move to larger cities like Beijing 
while being registered as residents in 
a rural area, need to meet educational 
and wealth requirements that many 
cannot meet. As a result, many like Pei 
are restricted to the status of “tempo-
rary” or “transitory” migrants by these 
discriminatory Hukou policies, forever 
forbidden from permanently moving 
themselves and their families to cities 
like Beijing and Shanghai with higher 
pay and better living conditions. Even if 
the migrants’ children obtain the same 
status as their parents and move to cit-
ies along with their parents, local gov-
ernments have set up these barriers to 
prevent the children of migrant parents 
from accessing quality public educa-
tion, continuing the generational curse 
bestowed upon their rural parents.

Board, hosted within The Michigan

T

he 
Michigan 
Daily 

Editorial 
Board 
voted 

to 
endorse 
Noah 

Zimmerman and Jackie Hillman 
of the EnvisionBlue party for 2022-
2023 Central Student Government 
president and vice president in the 
election on March 30 and 31. While 
both parties running offer valuable 
perspectives, the specificity and 
breadth of EnvisionBlue’s platform 
sets them apart. It is paramount 
to have a CSG president and vice 
president who come into office 
with 
tangible 
initiatives 
that 

reflect the extensive scope of issues 
the incoming administration will 
encounter, 
and 
EnvisionBlue’s 

platform offers these policies.

With an emphasis on instituting 

pragmatic policies, EnvisionBlue’s 
platform consists of 30 action 
items and 15 advocacy initiatives. 

Zimmerman and Hillman aim 
to serve as a voice of the students 
while keeping their promises 
realistic and within the realm of 
CSG’s capabilities. This platform’s 
advocacy priorities emphasize the 
importance of both enhancing 
current CSG programming and 
creating new CSG programming. 
The candidates would like to create 
partnerships between CSG and 
upper-level diversity programs 
within the Spectrum Center, the 
Trotter Multicultural Center and 
advocacy groups to ensure CSG’s 
resources are serving all students. 
This platform also details the 
advancements of several specific 
programs designed to increase 
accessibility 
and 
affordability 

for students, such as creating a 
textbook donation program.

Considering 
the 
University 

of Michigan’s history of sexual 
misconduct, 
the 
candidates 

expressed 
their 
commitment 

to rebuilding trust with the 
administration and pre-existing 
organizations 
for 
preventing 

sexual 
assault. 
To 
do 
this, 

this platform advocates for an 
acceleration 
in 
SAPAC’s 
case 

manager–hiring process; as there 
are currently two case manager 
vacancies, this would allow SAPAC 
to more efficiently address the 
needs of the student body. Part of 
this platform’s sexual misconduct 

prevention 
initiatives 
also 

includes requiring any candidate 
for 
University 
president 
and 

future administrative positions 
to undergo extensive background 
checks 
specifically 
related 
to 

past cases of handling sexual 
misconduct. One of this platform’s 
30 action items is to install a 
“Blue Light” outpost near the 
fraternities, a manageable change 
that will advance student safety on 
campus.

The 
Board’s 
evaluation 
of 

the 
candidates 
was 
twofold, 

considering 
not 
only 
the 

candidates’ stated platform but also 
their personal commitment to their 
goals. The duo is well prepared 
for office and the high-pressure 
positions they would be accepting. 
Zimmerman’s membership in CSG 
as a College of LSA representative 
gives him valuable knowledge on 
the inner workings of CSG, while 
Hillman’s experience with the 
California Senate empowers her 
with fundamental communication 
and 
organizational 
skills. 
In 

their presentation, both beamed 
while sharing their plans for the 
future of CSG and the students it 
represents, full of energy and drive 
to accomplish what they have set 
out to do.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY 

EDITORIAL BOARD 

Content note: This article contains 
mentions of sexual assault.
A

s 
incoming 
freshmen 

at 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan, many students 

grumbled about being required 
to complete an online course as 
a prerequisite for beginning the 
school year — namely, AlcoholEdu 
and Sexual Assault Prevention for 
Undergraduates. A blurb from the 
University’s First Year Experience 
webpage 
explains 
that 
these 

programs are designed “to inform 
students about alcohol and sexual 
assault issues. The confidential, 
research-based 
courses 
provide 

students with accurate information 
in a non-judgmental tone and 
encourages students to consider 
their own decisions and those of 
their peers.” Taking the course was 
fairly straightforward and seemed 
rather educational; the program 
explains in great detail what is 
required for informed consent to be 
given. Likewise, it emphasizes that 
the aftereffects of being victimized 
by sexual violence are treatable 
and that support is available. As a 
survivor of sexual assault myself, I 
felt an overall satisfaction with the 
information that was provided, and 
I figured that other students felt 
similarly.

However, the effectiveness of the 

sexual assault prevention program on 
our campus fails to withstand more 
intense scrutiny. Despite the fact 
this program was required for every 
incoming Michigan student and 
thoroughly explained the concepts 
of sexual assault and consent, the 
University still experienced a spike in 

sexual misconduct cases from 2017 to 
2019, ranging from stalking to rape. 

Moreover, 
the 
Office 
of 

Institutional Equity reported that 
violations, from intimate partner 
violence to sexual harassment, 
increased almost every year from 
2014 to 2020, climbing from 134 
violations to an astonishing 322 
violations. Though this can be 
partially attributed to a culture 
shift on campus that has made it 
more comfortable for survivors to 
report instances of sexual violence, 
these 
numbers 
still 
stand 
as 

evidence that our required sexual 
violence 
prevention 
program 

is not functioning to the extent 
that it should. Had the program 
successfully deterred sexual violence 
from happening in the first place, 
there would be far fewer reports 
for instances of sexual violence on 
campus. 

These numbers are estimated 

to 
be 
even 
more 
alarming 

among women of marginalized 
identities, 
and 
cases 
involving 

non-white women are frequently 
underreported, especially on college 
campuses. Moreover, though Black 
women, Indigenous women, disabled 
women and LGBTQ+ women are 
disproportionately 
affected 
by 

sexual violence, our school’s required 
prevention program still centers 
white, straight, able-bodied women 
in discussions about sexual assault. 
The institutional barriers that exist 
for 
marginalized 
communities 

within our country’s education and 
criminal justice systems evidently 
bleed into the supposed equitable 
reporting 
opportunities 
— 
and 

support systems — for survivors of 
color. 

An example of students of color 

disproportionately suffering from 

sexual 
exploitation 
on 
college 

campuses can be observed at our very 
own university. Serial sexual abuser 
Dr. Robert Anderson, who assaulted 
over 950 students during his time 
at the University, is said to have 
targeted Black male athletes more 
than any other identity group. Jamie 
White, a lawyer for approximately 
40 of Anderson’s survivors, cited 
the students’ first-generation and 
lower socioeconomic statuses as 
factors that made them increasingly 
vulnerable to Anderson’s abuse. 
Many of these Black athletes risked 
losing their athletic scholarships that 
enabled them to attend the University 
if they came forward with abuse 
claims. This horrific pattern alone 
proves the necessity of transforming 
our sexual violence prevention 
program to better serve students 
from a variety of backgrounds and 
social identities.

Aside from how our current 

sexual violence prevention program 
is oriented around white, straight, 
able-bodied identities, these sorts of 
programs are ineffective at actually 
preventing assault from occurring. 
A study focused on the difficulty 
of analyzing the effectiveness of 
these programs describes how 
there is a “lack of outcome studies 
that evaluate the event to which 
interventions have been effective 
at decreasing the actual rates of 
sexual assault.” In other words, 
little to no studies surrounding 
sexual assault prevention programs 
on college campuses can present 
empirical data that evaluate the 
effectiveness of these programs 
or measure learning directly after 
these programs are taught. 

College sexual assault primary prevention 

programs are failing us. Why?

ndrew 
Yang 
rose 
to 

prominence 
on 
the 

back of a very peculiar 

idea: universal basic income. This 
proposal that every American should 
receive a no-strings-attached $1,000 
check from the federal government 
every month propelled Yang to the 
presidential debate stage. Though 
it was impressive that he shared the 
stage with experienced politicians 
like (then Vice) President Biden 
and several senators, his lack of 
experience and a stable base were 
ultimately his downfall.

Leaning into meme culture and 

popular podcasts like The Joe Rogan 
Experience, Yang often touted his 
approval rating with Independents 
and Trump supporters, but he was 
sorely unable to transform that 
general likability into cold hard votes.

After this impressive — but 

nonetheless 
disappointing 
— 

campaign for a relative newcomer to 
electoral politics, Yang transitioned 
to running for mayor of New York 
City. I won’t delve too deeply into 
Yang’s journey from leading the 
mayoral primary to a disappointing 
fourth-place finish, but rest assured 
that his subsequent failure hinged on 

the same issues: an inability to form a 
coherent base from merely a friendly 
smile and some unique ideas.

After his defeat to current New 

York City Mayor, Eric Adams, Yang 
made a public announcement. 

He 
had 
formally 
left 
the 

Democratic Party and formed the 
Forward Party. He announced this 
new party in his book of the same 
name. “Forward” — which I read 
— laid out the platform of “ranked-
choice voting,” “open primaries,” 
“fact-based governance,” “human-
centered capitalism,” “modern and 
effective government,” “universal 
basic income” and “grace and 
tolerance.”

Yang’s core claim was that this 

party, with its hodgepodge of 
reasonable-sounding policy ideas, 
would be able to fill a gap in the 
American party repertoire that both 
Democrats and Republicans were 
neglecting. Through an assortment 
of commonsense policies aimed at 
reforming government, Yang believes 
this party could inspire action in a 
diverse coalition of discouraged and 
infrequent voters.

In some sense the polls are on 

Yang’s side: many of his ideas are 
certainly popular. Seventy-seven 
percent of Americans agree that 
campaign spending needs to be 
curtailed. Eighty-two percent side 

with his call for Congressional 
term limits. Nine in 10 Americans 
share his stance against partisan 
gerrymandering. 
With 
42% 

of 
Americans 
identifying 
as 

independents, this should be great 
news for a party that aims to capture 
the politically homeless middle.

Unfortunately, even though a 

plurality of Americans identify 
as Independents, as many as 91% 
of Americans have a significant 
preference for one party or the 
other, with the leftover 9% of “true” 
Independents varying significantly 
in race, occupation and economic 
interests. This makes forming a base 
from voters with common interests 
— like how Democrats captured 
the union vote and Republicans 
successfully courted evangelicals — 
very difficult. 

Currently, the Democrats’ base 

is largely young people, urbanites, 
ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+ people 
and those with college degrees. The 
Republican base is largely white 
evangelicals, business owners, those 
living in rural areas and voters older 
than 65. These bases are sustainable, 
based on groups with shared interests 
and are able to mobilize effectively to 
achieve concrete outcomes.

“

Sexuality is a spectrum.” 
I’m sure you’ve heard this 
sentiment 
many 
times 

before, as it’s become the poster 
slogan for a progressive view on 
what it means to be queer. As 
younger populations continue 
to explore queerness, our pre-
established binary definitions 
of attraction begin to blend 
into a continuum of different 
levels of sexual, romantic and 
gendered attraction.

As Generation Z (Gen Z) 

becomes more accepting and 
open to these identities, we 
implicitly hold expectations for 
what a person of each sexual 
identity should look and act 
like, which often align with 
how masculine and feminine 
we believe a person should be. 
Society expects a gay man to 
be feminine, a lesbian women 
to be masculine and a bisexual, 
pansexual or queer person to be 
somewhere right in the middle. 
Consequently, the vice versa of 
this is true, where we assume 
feminine men and masculine 

women must fall in to their 
implied queer identities. 

Notably, 
many 
of 
our 

expectations around queerness 
still 
revolve 
around 
the 

pre-concieved 
notion 
that 

everyone must be attracted 
to men. Bisexual women in 
relationships with men are 
assumed to be straight and 
in search of attention, and 
therefore are less comfortable 
coming out. On the other hand, 
bisexual men are assumed to 
be gay and too afraid to admit 
it. The inherent assumption 
that 
all 
people 
must 
be 

attracted to men stems from 
the androcentric structure of 
society and its incessant need 
for men to be idolized. Even 
male heterosexuality revolves 
around a constant need to 
“perform,” 
for, 
or 
compete 

with, other men. In the same 
way a high body count (a more 
recent phrase for number of 
sexual partners) is villainized 
in women, it becomes a token 
that men will use to compete 
with their friends. For women, 
decisions such as choosing 
to wear makeup or revealing 
clothing are assumed to be for 

the purpose of male attention, 
while liking things such as 
sports and cars have been 
recently deemed “pick me” 
activities, a new phrase used to 
describe situations where girls 
use more historically masculine 
interests to get attention from 
guys.

Young women being accused 

of hopping on the “bisexuality 
trend” 
for 
attention 
is 
a 

continuation of the expectation 
that anything women do is for 
men. “Alt girls” (or alternative 
girls) became a trend on TikTok 
in 2020, where mainly bisexual 
women 
would 
wear 
darker 

makeup and unique clothing. 
As people drew correlation 
between 
“alt 
girls” 
and 

bisexual girls, the trend-like 
nature of the former creates an 
association between bisexuality 
and trends. If men do validate a 
feminine presenting bisexual or 
lesbian, it’s often in the context 
of sexualization, such as in 
porn. Queer women are mainly 
represented in a sexual context 
in media, harming the overall 
image of queer and bisexual 
women, and minimizing it to 
sex. 

People will justify their claim 

that bisexuality is a “trend” by 
discussing how a large number 
of 
youth, 
especially 
young 

women, all began to come out 
at around the same time. From 
2015-2019, the number of non-
straight 
identifying 
15- 
to 

17-year-olds grew from 8.3% 
to 11.7%; for girls, this number 
went from 12.2% to 17.8%, 
approximately a 46% increase. 
This rise has led many adults, 
straight youth and even queer 
youth to question how valid the 
newest members of the bisexual 
community 
are. 
What 
this 

line of questioning threatens, 
however, is the comfort people 
find in having a community. A 
2022 poll from Gallup showed 
that 62% of respondents were 
somewhat or very satisfied 
with how lesbians and gays are 
accepted in the U.S., up from 
55% in 2021. More people aren’t 
“becoming” 
queer, 
they’re 

instead finding the bravery and 
communities they need to feel 
safe coming out.

Despite 
the 
increase 

in 
progressive 
thought 

surrounding queerness within 
our society, the conflict between 

the 
androcentric 
structure 

and the rise in population of 
LGBTQ+ youth leaves the queer 
community, 
and 
specifically 

the bisexual and pansexual 
communities, with the need to 
“prove” their sexuality. When 
I originally came to terms with 
my own bisexuality, I knew I 
wouldn’t come out until I was 
dating a girl. As a feminine-
presenting girl who had only 
been 
romantically 
involved 

with men in the past, I felt as 
though my sexuality wouldn’t 
be taken seriously unless I had 
something to show for it. Even 
now, as I discuss my sexuality 
with others, it has become 
compulsory to me to include 
the fact that I had a girlfriend 
in the past, in order to provide a 
sort of ethos within the subject 
of sexuality. 

However, as I’ve developed 

more 
relationships 
with 

women, my friends make little 
quips of “I feel like you’re 
actually just a lesbian.” In 
response, I’ve felt pressured 
to reign in my attraction to 
women 
and 
develop 
more 

relationships with men in order 
to prove and authenticate my 

sexuality. Many of my sexual 
and romantic decisions since 
coming out have been dictated 
by society’s view of the validity 
of my sexuality, instead of 
being driven by the freedom to 
simply be attracted to who I’m 
attracted to. 

The 
future 
of 
sexuality 

and the queer identity as a 
whole requires us to remove 
expectations. Being queer is not 
a personality trait, as there is no 
one personality that aligns with 
queerness or any queer identity. 
Instead, it is a part of one’s 
identity that can present itself in 
any way. We have to continue to 
push for nuanced concepts in the 
conversation on sexuality, such 
as bisexual men or women who 
come out and continue to date 
members of the opposite gender, 
or bisexual men and women 
who “seem straight” due to their 
hobbies, history or personality. 
The entire point of coming out 
as bisexual is to finally have the 
freedom to explore whatever 
relationships you want, and 
we have to stop limiting that 
freedom simply because we 
have certain expectations of 
what bisexuality looks like.

T

he Michigan winter. 
It’s a phenomenon I 
had grown tired of 

hearing about in the weeks 
leading up to my first semester 
at the University. It was always 
the first thing my friends and 
relatives in India asked me 
about when I mentioned this 
school, because even halfway 
across the world, tales of the 
Midwest winter are common 
knowledge. 
Although 
it 

annoyed me, I understood 
their concern. How was a 
boy who has lived all his life 
in a city that has never seen 
snow going to survive in Ann 
Arbor? I was afraid, but I 
always comforted myself with 
one thought: how bad could it 
possibly be?

It 
was 
bad. 
The 
first 

discovery, which came as a 
massive 
surprise, 
was 
the 

approximate time period of 
this “winter.” I had asked 
around, and most people said 
that it gets really cold by 
December and stays that way 
until February. What I did not 
realize, however, is that “really 
cold” is a relative concept. As 
early as October, my resolve 
started to crumble. The lower 
temperatures 
coupled 
with 

seemingly unyielding winds 
made for a duo that I was not 
prepared for. After less than 
a week, I considered opening 
up my collection of winter 
clothes. That was when I made 
my second discovery.

The 
cold 
might 
be 

unbearable, but it’s your ego 
that kills you. I had promised 
myself very early that if other 
people were not wearing a 
winter 
jacket, 
I 
wouldn’t 

either. If people were walking 
out of Starbucks or M-36 
holding a cup of coffee with 
their bare hands, I would not 
be wearing any gloves either. 
My goal was to not put on a 
single piece of winter clothing 
until the first of November. 
I succeeded, but at great 
personal cost. On every walk 
to the Michigan Union and 
every bike ride across the Diag, 
I remember being unable to 
feel my hands and desperately 
trying to cover up every inch 
of my body to prevent any wind 
from reaching it. Every step in 
the freezing cold of Ann Arbor 
was a reminder of the worried 
look on my parents’ faces 
when I said I wanted to go 
to Michigan and that I’d deal 
with the cold. The addition of 
a thick winter jacket and boots 
to my set of winter clothes 
helped, but it couldn’t keep 
up with the rapidly falling 
temperatures.

Over the last week, as we 

collectively felt the mercy 
of the weather gods (albeit 

only temporarily, it seems) 
I thought back to the peak 
winter months and felt a sense 
of victory. I had, for the most 
part, made it through my 
first 
winter. 
Nevertheless, 

I couldn’t deny the effect 
weeks of cloudy skies and 
shorter days had had on me. 
From a very young age, we are 
surrounded by the idea that 
winter is associated with more 
negative themes — sadness, 
loneliness and sometimes even 
death. Recurring themes in 
poems I was taught during my 
middle school and high school 
years — even the greats often 
resorted to this archetype. It 
is also an idea many echo when 
they speak of the adverse 
effects colder weather have 
on college students, and to a 
certain extent, I agree with 
this sentiment.

From 
being 
unable 
to 

play outdoor sports to being 
discouraged 
from 
leaving 

the house at all, the harsh 
winters 
of 
Michigan 
did 

curb some of my happiness. 
I began to notice that on the 
rare occasions when we had 
a warmer day, I would see 
a drastic upturn in not only 
my mood, but the entire vibe 
on campus. This past week 
has been a testament to that. 
In what couldn’t have been 
a better buildup to the St. 
Patrick’s 
day 
celebrations, 

seeing people in shorts and 
t-shirts, gathering in masses 
at Elbel Field or the Diag, was 
a sight for sore eyes. It might 
not be spring yet, but it feels 
like the first few weeks of 
the fall semester, which were 
some of my most memorable 
on this campus. That being 
said, I firmly believe that the 
Michigan winter is part of the 
experience. It is a part of the 
lore of this great school and 
if nothing else, it has given 
me a newfound appreciation 
for the sun. I might not have 
known it before, but boy, oh 
boy do I love the sun. 

That is, of course, until 

I’m back in India for summer 
break and wishing that I was 
sipping some hot chocolate in 
snowy Ann Arbor.

A

n 
unavoidable 

consequence 
of 
the 

war in Ukraine will be 

shifting energy supply chains 
globally. 
European 
Union 

member 
states 
dependent 

on Russian oil have already 
voiced a strong desire to 
establish 
better 
energy 

security. In the short-term, 
that 
will 
require 
burning 

greater quantities of fossil 
fuels. European consumption 
of imported natural gas and 
coal are expected to increase 
as EU imports of Russian 
oil are slowly phased out 
by 2027. In the long-term, 
however, the EU has indicated 
that renewable energy will 
fuel energy security on the 
Continent. 

America’s relationship to 

Russian oil is less precarious 
than that of our neighbors 
across 
the 
Atlantic. 
The 

war has caused gas prices 
to skyrocket — which often 
harms low income Americans 
the most — but has not 
endangered 
our 
long-term 

energy 
supply. 
We 
only 

imported 8% of our crude 
oil from Russia in the year 
preceding Biden’s import ban 
and, furthermore, we are net 
exporters of energy. Even 
so, the U.S. attitude toward 
action 
abroad 
for 
greater 

renewable 
energy 
should 

not be indifference. America 

ought to seriously evaluate 
whether we are on track to 
successfully 
transition 
to 

renewable energy alongside 
the rest of the world. 

Aggressive 
climate 

policy is a top priority for 
the 
Biden 
administration. 

Last year, President Biden 
announced a plan to decrease 
emissions by 50% (from 2005 
levels) by 2030. To achieve 
this 
ambitious 
goal, 
rapid 

investment 
in 
solar, 
wind 

and other renewables will 
be necessary on a massive 
scale. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 

Biden’s industrial policy — 
protecting American industry 
from 
foreign 
competitors 

and 
bringing 
industrial 

plants back to America — has 
the 
potential 
to 
frustrate 

his climate goals if it is not 
executed strategically. 

Policy decisions affecting 

the 
solar 
power 
industry 

illustrate the tension between 
the interests of labor and 
swift climate policy. President 
Biden wants a rapid shift 
to clean energy, but at the 
same time wants American 
solar manufacturers to play 
a major role in that shift. To 
demonstrate his commitment 
to 
American 
labor, 
Biden 

extended 
and 
amplified 

Trump-era “Buy American” 
economic policies aimed at 
protecting 
manufacturing 

jobs, including jobs in the 
solar 
power 
industry. 
In 

practice, that has meant the 
continuation of tariffs levied 

on solar panel components 
imported from China. 

Because 
Chinese 

polysilicon, 
a 
major 

component of solar panels, is 
much cheaper, tariffs imposed 
on Chinese imports lead to 
increased 
costs 
for 
firms 

installing solar panel fields 
and slow down the pace of 
increasing 
America’s 
solar 

power capacity. Because of 
this complication, tariffs of 
this nature are generally not 
popular among economists. 
However, President Biden’s 
(and Trump’s) concern about 
the economic well-being of 
manufacturing workers is not 
misplaced, only misdirected. 
Advocates of the transition 
to solar tend to make the 
argument that because the 
burgeoning 
industry 
will 

create jobs, those working 
in fossil fuels stand to lose 
nothing 
in 
the 
transition. 

Though the “more jobs” claim 
is correct, the second — and 
arguably more important — 
claim that solar jobs are just 
as good is not. 

The American Federation 

of Labor and Congress of 
Industrial 
Organizations, 

or AFL-CIO, a prominent 
U.S. labor union, came out 
against 
the 
Green 
New 

Deal when it was pitched in 
2019. Although other unions 
supported the bill, AFL-CIO’s 
leader, 
Richard 
Trumka, 

was concerned about what 
the 
legislation 
as 
written 

would do to the livelihoods of 

fossil fuel workers. Evidence 
suggests 
his 
worry 
was 

warranted. 
Currently, 
the 

average 
compensation 
for 

California fossil fuel workers 
is 
$130,000 
(including 

benefits), 
while 
the 
same 

figure 
for 
solar 
power 

workers is roughly $86,000. 
Comparing wages across these 
industries nationally tells a 
similar story, with oil workers 
making roughly $27 for every 
hour worked, compared to 
an average $24 an hour wage 
for solar workers. Without 
labor laws that strengthen 
the position of labor unions 
in the clean energy industry, 
a hasty transition to solar 
energy would give hundreds 
of thousands of workers an 
effective pay cut. 

Opening up trade with China 

is essential to the future of 
American renewable energy. 
China has long been dominant 
in the race to produce solar 
power; continuing to protect 
American solar manufacturers 
is a noble, though idealistic, 
project. Even so, the Biden 
administration must work to 
ensure that the interests of the 
new generation of workers in 
the clean energy industry are 
not ignored by providing the 
legal backing necessary for 
unionization. The transition 
to green energy will not be 
painless, but it is inevitable. 
Striking 
a 
better 
balance 

between rapid development 
and fair labor conditions must 
become part of that transition.

Growing up as the only girl on my 

youth baseball team, of course one 
of my favorite movies was A League 
of Their Own. The 1992 
classic 
and 
highest-

grossing baseball movie 
of all time depicts the 
All-American Girls Pro-
fessional Baseball League 
(AAGPBL), which ran 
from 1943 to 1954, fea-
tured teams from the 
Midwest and gave over 
600 women the opportu-
nity to play professional 
baseball. I always won-
dered why I had to play 
with boys, instead of with 
girls like Marla Hooch and Kit and 
Dottie Hinson, my heroes from the 
movie.

In 2015, when I was 12 years old, 

I found my first opportunity to play 
with and against other girls at the 
inaugural Baseball For All National 
girls’ baseball tournament in Orlan-
do, Florida. There, I joined over 100 
other girls aged 13 and under to play 
baseball. For almost all of us, it was 
the first time that we had been sur-
rounded by athletes who shared 
that love and passion for the game, 
along with the hard-won strength 
and resilience that resulted from 
being the only girl on the field.

Since then, I’ve played at every 

Nationals and have seen firsthand 
the exponential growth of the wom-
en’s game. The event has expanded 
to include over 500 girls, in five age 
divisions, representing nearly forty 
states. Baseball For All has built a 
nation-wide community of girls and 
women from ages 8 to 19 who play 
baseball, and they aren’t stopping at 
the youth level.

Last weekend, for the first 

time since Vassar College’s team 
was disbanded over one hundred 
years ago, women’s collegiate 
baseball teams faced each other 
at the inaugural Baseball For All 
College Club Baseball Champion-
ship.

Ballplayers 
from 
Montclair 

State University, Occidental Col-
lege, California State University 

at Fullerton and the University 
of Washington took the field at 
the Major League Baseball Youth 

Academy in Compton, 
California on March 
20, making history and 
breaking the grass ceil-
ing.

“Ever since I was a 

kid, watching A League 
of Their Own, I always 
thought, ‘I wish I was 
alive during this time, 
so I could play women’s 
baseball,’ ” University 
of Washington women’s 
club baseball founder 
and first base/pitcher 

Katie Firestone said. “So to be 
able to actually have an opportu-
nity to have something to do with 
something like that … was amaz-
ing.”

Firestone, who had grown up 

playing baseball informally and 
then in a Sunday men’s league in 
high school, originally thought 
about trying out for her universi-
ty’s men’s club baseball team. But 
as a first year out-of-state student 
from California, she didn’t want 
to go about it alone.

When Firestone researched the 

men’s club baseball team prior to 
tryouts, there was a woman in a 
photo on the team’s Instagram 
page. After reaching out, Fire-
stone discovered that she was 
Maggie Gallagher, the team’s first 
ever female club president. Gal-
lagher had played on the team for 
two years after playing on the UW 
varsity softball’s Women’s Col-
lege World Series team. Firestone 
connected with Gallagher, who 
is now the general manager and 
head coach of UW’s women’s club 
baseball team.

Gallagher opened doors for the 

team in the Seattle area, help-
ing them secure a practice facil-
ity, land sponsorships and garner 
media attention. And with that 
publicity came more players, lead-
ing to a final roster size of nine-
teen, up from the original two.

The Huskies ended up tak-

ing home the trophy, after going 
undefeated in the tournament, 
scoring a total of 48 runs and 
beating Occidental College in the 
championship game, 19-3.

“Based on how much hype 

we’ve gotten, we have more girls 
who are interested from the Uni-
versity of Washington,” Firestone 
said. “Next year, I see tryouts, 
maybe a travel team and a prac-
tice team, practice t-shirts, more 
sponsors, more hype, just con-
tinuing to build this community 
of women at UW who love base-
ball.

“I think that the coolest part 

about it for me is that when you 
come to college, you’re trying to 
find your community. I feel like I 
was a part of starting a different 
club that has created this commu-
nity for these girls.”

The girls baseball community 

is the most accepting place I have 
ever known. And bringing that 
community to the college level, 
where so many students are try-
ing to find their place, is some-
thing incredible.

“It was something that I knew I 

needed, I just didn’t know exactly 
where to find it,” Occidental Col-
lege freshman pitcher and catcher 
Siena Jarrin said. “Continuing to 
have that baseball part of my life 
is really important to me.”

A softball player since she 

could walk, Jarrin tried baseball 
for the first time when Occiden-
tal College formed its first team, 
even learning to pitch in time for 
the championships.

“The fact is, baseball does exist 

for women,” Jarrin said. “And it’s 
an opportunity that you can have 
if you’re new, if you’re not new, 
and it could be something that’s 
really fun for a lot of people.”

The key to growth in women’s 

college baseball is having new 
athletes try the sport. Right now, 
there is a severe drop in female 
participation in baseball when 
they hit the high school level. 
According to Baseball For All, the 
100,000 girls in the sport drops to 

1,000 due to more high school and 
collegiate opportunities in other 
sports. A number of my women’s 
baseball friends have elected to 
pursue opportunities in track 
and field, softball or basketball 
because they can play longer.

That’s not to say that women 

cannot succeed in men’s high 
school or collegiate baseball; 
there is a record eight women are 
currently playing for men’s colle-
giate baseball teams this spring. 
For those who aren’t able to play 
at the varsity level, they can join 
the men’s club baseball team and 
continue to play the game they 
love there. That’s what my friend 
Beth Greenwood did at the Uni-
versity of Rochester, and it even-
tually led to her earning a spot as 
the first American female NCAA 
catcher on the Yellow Jacket team 
last year.

Currently, boys and men have 

the opportunity to play all the way 
from tee ball, to high school, col-
lege and beyond. The only thing 
that limits them is their talent. 
Girls, regardless of their – often 
considerable – talent, are often 
told that they should quit baseball 
simply because they are girls. 

“By creating a pipeline that 

becomes equal to what the boys 
already have, gender equity in 
baseball can exist,” Siegal said. 
“(Baseball For All) supports co-ed 
baseball at the college level, but 
know that more women will get 
an opportunity if there is wom-
en’s baseball as sport for students 
to aim towards.”

In order to become an official 

NCAA championship sport, an 
emerging sport for women must 
have a minimum of 40 varsity 
programs and demonstrate via-
bility through consistent league 
play. Baseball For All, while 
encouraging teams to start all 
over the country, will be focusing 
on the Los Angeles area in order 
to form a league and have con-
sistent competition, similar to a 
college club softball league. This 
will help it reach its goal of hav-

ing 8-12 teams in 2023 and 40-50 
teams in five years.

“We showed that our model 

works,” Siegal said. “There are 
women on campuses that want to 
play baseball, and there are stu-
dents willing to make it happen. 
So our only limit now is funding 
and exposure.”

Here at the University of 

Michigan, there is not currently 
a women’s club baseball team. If 
women want to play a bat-and-
ball sport, they can either try out 
for the men’s club baseball team 
or the women’s club softball team.

Similar to Firestone, I had to 

decide whether to try out as the 
only girl on the men’s club base-
ball team or try out for the club 
softball team. I chose the club 
softball team and have loved 
my experience. I have found a 
community of women that are 
like family to me, who all work 
towards a goal bigger than our-
selves. 

What women deserve is the 

option to do that through playing 
baseball. 

That’s why I’m planning to 

start a women’s club baseball 
team here at Michigan in the fall.

I hope to create an additional 

experience for women to play 
club baseball, and plan to sched-
ule the women’s baseball team so 
that athletes don’t have to choose 
between the sports.

The friendships I have made 

throughout the eight years I have 
been involved in women’s base-
ball are among the strongest rela-
tionships in my life. My closest 
friends are the girls I get to see 
only a few weeks a year at tourna-
ments or elite development pro-
grams. The moments we spend 
together on and off the field are 
the most memorable experiences 
I have. Simply put, these girls are 
my people.

I have been dedicated to grow-

ing women’s baseball since I 
played at Nationals for the first 
time. In 2016, I co-founded Illi-
nois Girls Baseball and we ran our 

first two years of practices with 
less than ten girls. In fall 2020, we 
held the first-ever female youth 
baseball league in the state of 
Illinois, and our organization has 
grown to over one hundred par-
ticipants.

It is incredible to watch the 

next generation of female base-
ball players growing up playing 
on all-girls youth baseball teams, 
when at their age, I was the only 
girl in the league. They see a 
female MLB general manager, an 
on-field MLB coach, a low-A man-
ager, a director of Major League 
operations, a professional draft 
pick, and so many more women in 
professional baseball. 

And with the creation of the 

University of Michigan women’s 
club baseball team, I want them 
to see women playing collegiate 
baseball, on both men’s and on 
women’s teams.

Collegiate women’s basketball, 

now a well-established sport, pro-
vides a framework for what wom-
en’s club baseball could become. 
Fifty years ago, Immaculata Uni-
versity won the first-ever national 
women’s college basketball cham-
pionship, hosted by the Associa-
tion for Intercollegiate Athletics 
for Women (AIAW). Ten years 
later, the NCAA sponsored the 
first NCAA women’s college bas-
ketball championship.

Now, we know women’s bas-

ketball as a sport with a pres-
ence on every stage: Olympic, 
professional, 
collegiate, 
club, 

high school and youth. Women’s 
baseball in the United States has 
a national team and a widespread 
youth level, but it’s missing the 
intermediates.

“It took women’s basketball 10 

years to get there from when they 
first started playing club,” Fires-
tone said. “I think that with social 
media and the support women in 
baseball have right now, we could 
do it sooner.”

In order to have a league of 

their own, women’s baseball 
needs to gain NCAA status.

SportsMonday: Don’t judge Michigan at its highs, 

judge it by its lows

Out of COVID’s shadow, Michigan 

lacrosse has found its identity

KATE HUA/Daily 

Now, out of the shadow of the pandemic, the women’s lacrosse team is 
ready for a historic season.

The Olympics are the grand-

est stage in sports and the ultimate 
dream of many athletes. For the very 
driven and gifted few, that dream 
becomes a goal. 

Maggie MacNeil, a Canadian 

native and senior on the Michigan 
swimming and diving team, had the 
Olympics as a backdrop from the very 
beginning. Right after the 2008 Bei-
jing Games, an eight-year-old Mac-
Neil started her swimming career. 

MacNeil’s passion arose from the 

most raw aspect of the sport: her love 
of the water. Her mother, a physi-
cian, emphasized water safety from a 
young age, which spurred MacNeil’s 
interest. But back then, she never 
imagined swimming would carry her 
to such heights. 

“Whenever someone starts sports, 

the Olympics are always a goal,” Mac-
Neil said. “But I didn’t think swim-
ming would take me this far.”

MacNeil initially realized the 

exceptionalism of her talent in 2015 
when she first joined Canada’s 
Junior National Team at age fifteen. 
Even after reaching that elite level, 
she never acknowledged the Olym-
pics as a potential reality until 2019 
at her first FINA World Champion-
ships. 

MacNeil won the 100-meter but-

terfly, defeating Sweden’s Sarah Sjos-
trom—the 2016 Olympic champion 
— and breaking the Americas’, Cana-
dian and Commonwealth records in 
the process. As the world champion, it 
began to sink in that she could qualify 
for the Tokyo Olympics the following 

year. 

But in March 2020, all of Mac-

Neil’s plans were derailed. With the 
NCAA Championships canceled, she 
returned home to Canada, where she 
was isolated from her teammates and 
her regimented training schedule. 
MacNeil went six months without a 
regulation-size pool and was forced 
to find other ways to stay in shape. 

“None of us (swimmers) are great 

at land sports,” MacNeil said. “Run-
ning is my enemy.”

To help her get any minimal feel 

for the water during quarantine, 
MacNeil’s parents opened their back-
yard pool at the end of March. While 
it was nowhere near the 50-meter 
Olympic-size pools, MacNeil trained 
in the heated waters during the brisk 
Canadian spring, even if it was merely 
for ten minutes a day. 

“Motivation was really hard,” 

MacNeil said. “In retrospect, I prob-
ably should have done more than I 
did.”

Her atypical training paid off 

when she qualified for the resched-
uled Tokyo Games. But the 2021 
Olympics were far from the typical 
competitive atmosphere. No fans 
were allowed at the natatorium, and 
athletes were divided into quaran-
tine bubbles by country and sport. 
But this being her first Olympics, 
there was nothing for MacNeil to 
compare the conditions to, so she 
used that to her advantage. 

One of the most impactful altera-

tions was changing the time of day 
that the 100-meter butterfly finals 
were swam. Rather than taking place 
in the evening, the finals were held in 
the morning, giving MacNeil no time 
to overthink. 

“I just woke up and knew I had a 

job to do,” MacNeil said.

Entering the finals ranked No. 

6, MacNeil was not deterred by her 
seed. As long as there was a lane for 

her, winning was still a possibility. At 
the 50-meter turn, halfway through 
the race, MacNeil’s split was not even 
in the top three. But in the last 15 
meters, MacNeil put her head down, 
touching the wall in 55.59 seconds 
to capture a new Americas record. 
Winning gold made MacNeil the first 
female Michigan swimmer to place 
first individually at the Olympics 
since 1964. 

But earning gold was not the same 

without her family present to cel-
ebrate with her. The endearing video 
footage that MacNeil’s cousin sent to 
her displaying her family’s reaction 
and excitement was not nearly the 

same as being in person. Instead she 
celebrated with her Canadian team-
mates and also those she swam with 
at Michigan. 

Training for four years in Ann Ayr-

bor with those swimmers left strong 
ties, with the collegiate season lasting 
from early September to late March. 
In between, from April through 
August, MacNeil competes in the 
international season. 

And this is an annual occurrence, 

not only during Olympic years.

Swimming is arguably the most 

grueling 
yet 
underappreciated 

sport in the world of athletics. Many 
spectators tune in every four years 

for the Olympics 
and then neglect 
swimming’s 
rel-

evance after the 
Games 
conclude. 

But for athletes 
such as MacNeil, 
the work never 
stops.

“Swimming 
is 

not an easy sport,” 
MacNeil said. “We 
don’t have an off-
season.”

While she tries 

to 
take 
two-to-

four weeks off in 
between each col-
lege and interna-
tional season, the 
training 
drought 

MacNeil 
and 

every other athlete 
endured 
during 

quarantine 
was 

unlike any other. 
But 
despite 
the 

unorthodox condi-

tions, MacNeil and many others had 
stellar performances as a result. 

“I’m really grateful I was able to 

succeed despite all the challenges,” 
MacNeil said. “But it definitely 
makes me reevaluate my plans going 
into the next Olympics.” 

Leading up to the 2020 Games, 

MacNeil’s training was significantly 
lighter than what it would have been 
in a typical year. While practicing 
with teammates is something that 

is imperative, she is looking to adopt 
some of the aspects that transpired 
into a gold medal. 

Going forward, MacNeil recently 

announced her commitment to exer-
cise her final year of NCAA eligibil-
ity to compete at the University of 
California Berkeley while pursuing a 
master’s degree. After graduating in 
2023, she will have complete control 
over her training the year before the 
2024 Olympics.

Although it seems as if MacNeil 

just won Olympic gold, but the turn-
around is swift. With the 2020 Olym-
pics postponed a year, Paris is quickly 
approaching. While MacNeil has her 
eyes set on the 2024 Games, her focus 
has not come without doubt. 

“I’ve definitely questioned swim-

ming and goals because I feel like 
I’ve done a lot of everything I’ve ever 
wanted,” MacNeil said. “I felt lost in 
the ‘What’s next?’”

MacNeil has decided to train for 

Paris, but beyond that, she is not 
tying herself to anything. Every ath-
lete’s career comes to an end at some 
point, and she is going to determine 
her future based on her happiness 
and the satisfaction she derives from 
swimming. 

There could be a long professional 

swimming career on the horizon, or 
she may pivot into something else. No 
matter what comes her way, MacNeil 
is taking her training and her career 
day by day. 

“As long as I’m enjoying it, whatev-

er happens along the way will be icing 
on the cake,” MacNeil said.

She has turned her dreams into 

goals and her goals into reality. All 
that is left is for MacNeil to answer 
her own question: “What’s next?”

The implications of COVID 

stretch far past health, and for the 
Michigan women’s lacrosse team, 
the 
pandemic-inflicted 
burden 

hampered their 2021 season.

Being part of a team entails much 

more than the product on the field. 
Goals and assists may appear in the 
boxscore, but without camaraderie 
and trust, little production — and 
subsequent winning — can occur 
during games. 

As someone who’s been around 

the game of lacrosse all of her life, 
first as a decorated player and now 
as the Michigan coach, Hannah 
Nielsen understands that better 
than anyone.

“It’s about road trips and eating 

together and being on the same bus,” 
Nielsen said. “Just those little things 
you have along the way. That’s how 
you build relationships.”

In a year where student athletes 

around the country lived in fear of 
falling ill, sacrificed their social lives 
and played in front of empty bleach-
ers, building strong connections 
seemed inconceivable

Last year, despite having tal-

ented pieces, the blockage of any 
normalcy proved too severe for the 
Wolverines. They finished 3-9, con-
cluding their season with a demoral-
izing loss to Maryland in the Big Ten 
Tournament.

Activities as basic as eating 

meals together and spending time 
as a group are often overlooked, but 
without them, chemistry is unat-
tainable. 

“We couldn’t (do) the little things 

you do off the field,” Nielsen said. 
“Wins and losses are great but 
lacrosse and the collegiate-athlete 
experience is so much more than 
that.”

The team experienced firsthand 

that the impacts of the pandemic ran 
deep. 

At a school that excels in athletics, 

people often focus on the “athlete” 
part in “student-athlete,” but first 
and foremost, these players are stu-
dents. In late 2021, as the Omicron 
variant soared and outlook on life 
seemed grim, the expectations for 
collegiate athletes to perform grew 

even higher. 

But with immense sacrifice and 

little optimism, it’s difficult to live up 
to the expectations.

With vaccinations in full effect 

and the pandemic winding down, 
normalcy was beginning to resur-
face. As the world inched closer to 
equilibrium and the 2022 season 
neared, many unanswered ques-
tions remained, the most glaring one 
being:

What now?
The team could dwell on the pre-

vious season’s shortcomings or focus 
on the future; the choice was obvi-
ous to them.

“It was ‘Hey guys, let’s forget 

about it, it happened and we’re mov-
ing on,’ ” Nielsen said. “The girls 
are motivated because 3-9 … wasn’t 
really a true illustration of who we 
are and what we could accomplish.”

The silver lining of the pan-

demic, though, was an extra year 
of eligibility. The love of their team, 
their school and their sport drove 
fifth-year captains Caitlin Muir and 
Arielle Weissman to exercise that 
privilege. 

“(Coming back) was never any-

thing that I thought about before 
COVID happened,” Muir said. “But 
with not getting to finish out my 
years on my own terms, it was really 
a done deal.”

As 
COVID-induced 
crutches 

lifted and the team began to focus 
on building relationships and nur-
turing talent, the players set out to 
show that the driving force of the 
abysmal 2021 season was the loom-
ing pandemic and not the players 
themselves.

The Wolverines opened their sea-

son with seven straight wins — mak-
ing it clear to everybody what they 
were capable of.

Leadership from seniors Erin 

Garvey, Kaitlyn Mead and Morgan 
Whitaker in addition to the two 
fifth-years displays the potential 
that the pandemic was covering in 
the previous season.

“They’re doing a great job,” 

Nielsen said. “It makes me want to 
coach harder because of the effort 
they’re putting in so that we can 
reach our goals this year.”

If you’ve been following the 

Michigan women’s basketball team 
for the past couple of years, you 
know how many history-making 
moments it has had. 

In 2017, the Wolverines won their 

first WNIT Championship. 

In 2021, then-junior for-

ward Naz Hillmon broke 
the Michigan record – for 
both the men’s and women’s 
programs – with 50 points 
in a single game, and the 
Wolverines made their first 
Sweet Sixteen appear-
ance.

This 
season, 
they 

secured a No. 3 seed in the 
NCAA Tournament — the 
highest in program history. 

Along the way, Michigan coach 

Kim Barnes Arico has become the 
first coach in program history to 
lead the team to a top 10 ranking, 
reaching as high as top five. The first 
to surpass 200 wins with the pro-
gram. The only coach to have eight 
20-win seasons. 

On Monday, the Wolverines will 

add another line to their list of firsts:

First Elite Eight appearance. 
“Obviously we have made his-

tory throughout this entire season, 
but we wanted to continue to keep 
doing things that have never been 
done before and go through the 
highs and lows that we did this sea-
son,” senior guard Leigha Brown 

said after Saturday’s win 
against South Dakota. “ … 
But we’re not done yet. We 
want to keep making his-
tory.”

You can judge Michigan 

by its extensive list of acco-
lades. But it’s even more 

telling to look at what’s 
not on its résumé.

It was less than two 

months ago that a snow-
storm and a canceled 

road game essentially lost Michi-
gan what would have been its first 
Big Ten title. And it was less than a 
month ago that No. 6 seed Nebraska 
took the Wolverines by surprise 
in the second round of the Big Ten 
Tournament. 

“That’s crushing and that can 

be devastating and that can change 
the outcome of the year, for sure,” 
Barnes Arico said. 

And, yet, it didn’t. Michigan took 

to the court in the first round of 

March Madness, seemingly unfazed 
by its earlier challenges, and blew 
out American, 74-39. 

What’s not noted on the Wol-

verines’ stats sheet is senior guard 
Amy Dilk’s injury that kept her out 
of most conference games. And the 
fact that they pulled off a 13-4 Big 
Ten record even without one of their 
biggest defensive assets. 

It’s not just the record-breaking 

moments, but the times they’ve been 
tested that makes this team what it 
is. 

That combination of confidence 

and resilience is tested more and 
more as Michigan makes its way 
through March. Even as their wins 
have gotten progressively closer — 
their first win by 35, their second by 
15 and their most recent by just three 
— the Wolverines have maintained 
their composure. 

“There were a lot of things that 

happened during the course of the 
year that we could have crumbled 
and said ‘Well, woe is me’ and ‘Why 
did this happen to us?’ ” Barnes 
Arico said. “I’m sure alone in our 
moments we do say that, but I think 
the great quality about this team and 
this program has been the ability to 

get back up every day and to come 
together and say, ‘Well, now we have 
something to prove.’ ”

This dynamic is maybe best seen 

in the ending of Saturday’s game. 
After trailing by five points with less 
than two minutes left, the Coyotes 
managed to tie the game. In the final 
minute with the team’s hopes on the 
line, Barnes Arico’s message from 
the sidelines encompassed all of the 
confidence and resilience this sea-
son has built: 

Just score. 
“That right there, that gave me 

the most confidence in the world,” 
freshman guard Laila Phelia said. 
“I felt like just being able to have the 
head coach sit there and tell me to go 
score and don’t hesitate at all, I felt 
like that really helped a lot.”

You can judge the Wolverines by 

the records they’ve broken and the 
games that they’ve won, or you can 
judge them by the number of times 
they’ve fallen and had to get back 
up. Either way, the conclusion is the 
same: 

Michigan is a force to be reckoned 

with.

KIZZIAH

Paul Nasr: Quinnipiac’s early goaltender pull 

saved Michigan’s season

ALLENTOWN, 
Penn. 
— 

Despite entering the third period 
with a 4-0 lead, the Michigan 
hockey team still struggled to put 
Quinnipiac away. The Wolverines 
completely 
collapsed 

throughout 
the 
first 

15 minutes of the final 
frame. 

And Bobcats coach 

Rand Pecknold’s decision 
to pull goaltender Dylan 
St. Cyr with almost four 
minutes left saved Michi-
gan’s season. 

That’s not an indict-

ment on the Wolverines. 
They manhandled Quin-
nipiac’s 
nation-leading 

defense 
throughout 

much of the contest. They earned 
their place in the Frozen Four. 

But the Bobcats could’ve taken 

Michigan’s spot in Boston. Quin-
nipiac took over the game, seized 
all the momentum and then freely 
handed it right back to Michigan 
on Pecknold’s baffling decision. 

“It was a pretty normal decision 

for how I operate,” Pecknold said 
of pulling his goaltender while his 
team was surging, having scored 
three unanswered goals. “… Prob-
ably the last 13 (to) 14 years, we’ve 
done that pretty regularly, getting 

the goalie out early. … It works a 
lot more than it doesn’t for us.” 

As Pecknold made that state-

ment, celebratory music from 
Michigan’s locker room blared 

into the media room 
while he spoke som-
berly. Clearly, pulling 
the goalie worked for 
the Wolverines, not his 
own team. Michigan 
is uber-talented, but 
young and untested. 
It’s a critique Michi-
gan coach Mel Pear-
son called out after 
the game, but one 
that made itself clear 
throughout the third 
period. 
The 
Wol-

verines have the talent to win a 
national championship, but older 
and more battle-tested teams 
have an advantage in composure 
and game management. 

After the Bobcats scored their 

three unanswered goals, they 
continued to methodically des-
ecrate Michigan’s young, falter-
ing roster. Quinnipiac was calm 
and poised, and with its regularly 
dangerous attacks, it had a clear 
blueprint to victory with plenty 
of time.

That blueprint was thrown into 

the Lehigh River when the goal-
tender was pulled, a saving grace 
for Michigan’s young squad. 

“We were reeling,” Pearson 

said. “… They had us on the ropes. 
It was an interesting time to pull 
the goalie.” 

Interesting indeed. 
Halving almost four minutes 

left wasn’t the only shocking 
thing about the goaltender being 
pulled, it was the on-ice context as 
well. Instead of at least pulling the 
goalie while his team controlled 
possession in its offensive zone, 
Pecknold ordered St. Cyr to the 
bench before a faceoff, where the 
puck’s possession was in question. 

Who does that?
The Wolverines could very 

well have won that faceoff and 
launched the puck into the empty 
net right then and there. Pecknold 
added extra strain to his decision 
by betting on his team to win the 
faceoff too. Although the Bobcats 
won the draw, sophomore for-
ward Thomas Bordeleau quickly 
challenged and stole the puck. 

He then raced down the ice, 

passing it across to wide open 
fifth year senior Michael Pastujov 
for the empty-net goal that essen-
tially sealed the game with over 
three and a half minutes left. 

“They had all the momentum, 

and there’s like four minutes left 
in the game,” Pearson said. “I’m 
not going to question any coach. 
… (Pecknold’s) been around a 
long time, ton of respect for him 
… (but) they were pushing, they 
didn’t need to pull the goalie, they 
were all over us.” 

With 22 seconds left in the 

game, defenseman Zach Metsa 
removed any room for debate, 
scoring Quinnipiac’s fourth goal 
on even strength. Had the Bobcats 
left their goaltender in, the fourth 
goal could have very well tied the 
game, giving Quinnipiac all the 
momentum entering overtime. 

When asked if he regrets pull-

ing his goaltender so early in 
hindsight, Pecknold’s answer 
was blunt: 

“No.” 
Michigan certainly doesn’t 

regret it either. It was a team 
sliding into an embarrassing 
loss, and its opponent saved it 
from demise. By pulling his goal-
tender with almost four minutes 
left as his team was surging, 
Pecknold threw the Wolverines 
a life raft. 

A raft that will carry Michi-

gan to Boston for the Frozen 
Four.

WICHITA, Kan. — With the clock 

ticking down in the Michigan women’s 
basketball team’s first ever Elite Eight, 
junior guard Maddie Nolan, standing 
on the block, looked across the lane 
to senior forward Naz Hillmon. The 
two shared a look, Hillmon told Nolan 
to take a deep breath and they both 
steeled themselves for the next play.

Down by nine and struggling 

to overcome a late onslaught from 
Louisville, both players knew the 
situation 
was 
grim. 
Michigan’s 

chances at a Final Four berth — the 
first in program history — were 
quickly slipping away. 

In their first trip to the Elite Eight 

in program history, the third-seeded 
Wolverines (25-7 overall) fell to the 
first-seeded Cardinals (29-4), 62-50. 
In a crushing loss to end its historic 
season on Monday night, Michigan 
struggled to break through against 
Louisville’s stifling defense in spite of 
its own defensive strength.

“We knew it would be a game of 

runs and we had our share of runs,” 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico 
said. “They did what they do best. 
They forced us into some turnovers 
which resulted in some easy points for 
them.”

A defensive battle from the 

beginning, both teams were hard-
pressed to score. The Wolverines 
zeroed in on stopping the Cardinals 
from 
running 
their 
fast-paced 

transition 
offense. 
Lousiville 

jumped out to an early lead, but were 
continually tested by Michigan’s 
pesky defense — a narrative that 
repeated itself multiple times down 
the stretch.

On 
the 
offensive 
end, 
the 

Wolverines 
struggled 
to 
score 

throughout the first quarter. With 
the Cardinals dropping into their full-
court press after nearly every made 
basket, they forced Michigan into a 
few crucial early turnovers. 

The Wolverines tried to find their 

offense both inside and out, looking 
to Hillmon and senior forward Emily 
Kiser in the paint early on. But the 

Michigan’s historic season comes to a close 

in Elite Eight loss to Louisville

SPORTSWEDNESDAY

Wolverines struggled to find the 
bottom of the net, starting cold behind 
the 3-point line — until junior guard 
Maddie Nolan checked in.

Cutting Louisville’s growing lead 

with two 3-pointers late in the first 
quarter, Nolan was the offensive 

difference-maker early on. With the 
Cardinals having to leave their player 
to help on Nolan, Kiser and Hillmon 
found more space in the post. Ending 
the quarter by taking a charge, Nolan 
continued to keep Louisville at bay.

The defensive battle continued as 

both teams fought to gain control of 
the game. Forcing the Cardinals into 
a shot clock violation with under 30 
seconds left in the half, the Wolverines 

ABBIE TELGENHOF

CURTAIN CALL

had a chance to take the lead for the 
second time. Instead, a turnover and 
a missed defensive rebound allowed 
the Cardinals to extend their lead, 
forcing Michigan to enter the locker 
room down by three.

Opening the second half facing 

a 
renewed 
Louisville 
full-court 

press, the Wolverines fell back into 
their early pattern of turnovers. A 
scoring drought plagued Michigan 
throughout 
the 
third 
quarter, 

allowing the Cardinals to continue 
their balanced scoring attack from all 
five starters.

“I think their pressure, and that’s 

something that was obviously a 
concern of ours, really wore us down,” 

Barnes Arico said. “… Once we settled 
down (offensively), they wore us 
down with their defensive pressure, 
which forced turnovers.”

Drawing fouls in the paint, the 

Wolverines’ main source of points in 
the third quarter on the free-throw 
line until Nolan drained another 
3-pointer from the corner — once 
again cutting into Louisville’s lead. 
Michigan continued to pester the 
Cardinals, refusing to be buried, 
ending the quarter down by just two 
points.

Starting the fourth quarter once 

again with a turnover, the Wolverines 
quickly erased the progress they’d 
made at the end of the third — back-to-
back turnovers led to quick transition 
buckets for Louisville. 

Then, senior wing Leigha Brown 

stepped off the floor for the final time 
just under two minutes into the fourth 
quarter. Brown, who’s struggled with 
a lower-leg injury all season, had 
seemingly re-aggravated her injury. 
With Brown relegated to the bench, 
Michigan struggled to find any 
scoring outside the paint.

“Really, her tank was empty,” 

Barnes Arico said. “She couldn’t go 
anymore. … When you don’t have a 
dynamic guard, like Leigha Brown, 
arguably our best guard on the roster, 
that really hurts.”

With just under three minutes left 

in regulation, the Wolverines faced 
a two point differential. But failing 
to execute, missing multiple shots 
and turning the ball over, Michigan 
allowed the Cardinals to extend 
their lead. As Louisville continued to 
grow its advantage throughout the 
remaining minutes, Michigan could 
only watch as its hopes at a Final Four 
were dashed.

“I don’t think the final score is 

indicative of how that game went,” 
senior guard Danielle Rauch said. 
“How hard we fought and how much 
we put them on the ropes and we 
applied pressure as much as we could. 
Some things didn’t go our way. But I 
think that’s important to recognize.”

Ending 
their 
season 
in 
the 

program’s first-ever Elite Eight, the 
Wolverines made history.

Just not as much as they wanted.

Ending their season in the

Becoming a university student means experi-

arrived months too late, but it changed my life 
nonetheless.

Had I known the achievement-obsessed lion’s 

den I was walking into when I arrived in Ann 
Arbor my first time, I probably would have left 
that same night. It’s hard to see this environment 
when you’re sitting on the Diag, watching people 
bounce a basketball around, friends walking side 
by side, smiles on faces and block ‘M’s embla-
zoned on shirts.

What does it mean to be a Michigan Wolverine? 

How many tour groups have to walk by me before 
I get the sudden urge to let it all out, to scream in 
their face and warn them that Ann Arbor is bru-
tal, that it’s eat or be eaten on a daily basis. Dur-
ing those hallowed ‘Campus Days,’ what they 
don’t tell you about being a Michigan Wolverine 
is the number of hours you’ll spend ruining your 
eyesight staring at a computer screen, nearly sob-
bing because you can’t figure out how to calculate 
an integral. To hear roommates screaming down 
the hall and witness strangers wiping away tears 
in the UGLi, afraid to admit defeat.

How many more nights can I handle looking 

up from my screen and seeing the sun rise in the 
distance? How many more eyes can I look into, 
drained of their color and plump, before I finally 
say something?

There is a communal suffering we all bear wit-

ness to, sometimes falling into the very trap our-
selves, and yet this is something many of us refuse 
to talk about. It’s time we change that.

***

My story with my ADHD diagnosis began dur-

ing my very first semester on campus. It was fall 
semester and COVID-19 was at its peak, reducing 
me to Zoom lectures that I couldn’t bear to attend 
and homework groups I couldn’t bother to meet 
with. I had all the time in the world it seemed, just 
like during quarantine, but something was differ-
ent. 

My mind was persistently aware of the school-

work slowly piling up, but I could do absolutely 
nothing to induce movement in my body to 
change anything about it. Sitting behind the worn 
down desks of South Quad dormitories made me 
feel queasy, a constant reminder of all the things I 
had promised to complete and never did. 

Then winter semester came around, and I was 

still wasting hours of my time working on Canvas 
discussion posts and applications to internships I 
knew I wouldn’t get, and still falling behind my 
peers. It was a rat race, and I was losing.

Eventually, I got my slice of heaven: I was diag-

nosed with ADHD my sophomore year of college, 
and I could finally silence my frenzied thoughts 
with a little pill each day. Then, as more and more 
people learned of my treatment plan, and I began 
to ask those around me what they think of stimu-
lants like Adderall, I quickly realized that my 
medication was a valuable commodity — phar-
maceutical gold to certain Michigan students.

When you’re a Wolverine, you’re either buying 

or selling, trading or spotting — like at any other 
American university, Adderall is a precious com-
modity in our collegiate climate. You hook friends 
up with people who know people, facilitate silent 
exchanges on Venmo with cryptic descriptions, 
an illegal trade we’ve almost normalized. But 
these are symptoms, not the cause, of the increas-
ing dependence on stimulants among college stu-
dents.

I set out to follow the breadcrumb trail, tracing 

the origins of the campus-wide Adderall abuse by 
seeking out students and asking them about their 
stories with this coveted little pill. In some sort of 
twisted way, I desperately sought a solution from 
the words of those affected most, the people who 
sit next to you in lecture as you both ignore each 
other’s despair — a silent recognition that needs 
to be vocalized. 

Everyone remembers their first time
Like most things, drugs often sneak into your 

life quietly and unexpectedly, but they leave a big 
impact. It’s not exactly a secret that college stu-
dents are twice as likely to use stimulants than 
other non-students at their age, and that 5 to 35% 
of students have tried Adderall without a pre-
scription, but numbers don’t always tell the entire 
story.

Data can illustrate trends and correlations, 

but it says nothing about the real motive behind 
campus-wide Adderall use. Sometimes, uphold-
ing the notion of ‘leaders and best’ pushes us to a 
breaking point, a point that can be remedied by a 
productivity pill. 

Here’s what my peers had to say about their 

first time with Adderall.

A sophomore majoring in philosophy in LSA, 

like many others, happened to stumble upon 
access to Adderall through pure luck. “I think 

I tried Adderall 
for the first time 
in 
my 
sopho-

more year of high 
school — a friend 
had it. And they’re 
like, 
‘yo, 
you 

should try this. 
It’s crazy, it helps 
you focus and it 
makes you feel 
good.’ And I was 
like, ‘oh, sounds 
good.’ I’m like, 
it goes with the 
ADHD thing, but 
I’m very impul-
sive and have no willpower. So, if something’s in 
front of me, I’m gonna take it. … So that was it and 
I loved it.”

For those with ADHD, Adderall can give us a 

breath of fresh air, as the winding and persistent 
overlapping conversations in our minds die down 
to mere whispers.

An LSA sophomore majoring in sociology 

reflected on when they first became lovestruck 
by the pill’s effect. “I was 15 or 16. I bought it from 
my drug dealer who I used to (buy) these THC 
pills from. He kind of skipped out on me a couple 
times, he’s just so unreliable because that’s how 
drug dealers are. But he felt bad. And I think he 
just threw one (Adderall) in for free. … I took it 
and … I sat down and drew pictures, which is 
very strange for me, because I don’t like to focus. 
I don’t like to pay attention to one thing, but I did 
it. I spent two hours on it. And afterwards I really 
liked (Adderall).” 

A computer science student in the college of 

LSA reflected on their first couple of experiences 
with Adderall. “The first time I ever got Adderall, 
I bought it off a friend. It was actually Vyvanse, 
but same shit different name. The first time I took 
it was actually at the Union at 6 p.m. to do work, or 
it was to go to Necto. …That’s how I got it the first 
time, because someone offered to give it to me.” 
Like many students, this particular individual 
found Adderall by way of a friend who had it, rath-
er than intently seeking it out themselves. Thus, 
an informal but meticulously-cultivated network 
of Adderall users and dealers begins to take form 
on campus.

Additionally, they mentioned the first time 

they took Adderall in conjunction with another 

drug, an extreme dose of caffeine. “There was a 
period of time where I was staying up every night 
for quite a while. That’s happened quite a bit in 
computer science. And one of my friends who has 
an Adderall prescription, she opened up one of 
the capsules of her Adderall and poured it into a 
Bang energy (drink). And I thought, this is a good 
idea and I need this right now. And so I drank it.”

According to fellow students, finding Adderall 

also seems to involve being at the right place at the 
right time.

The computer science student continued, and 

our conversation quickly turned to the cyclical 
nature of Adderall usage on campus: “Anytime I 
mentioned that I have (Adderall) someone will be 
like, yo, where’d you get that? Literally everyone, 
like if you say the word Adderall on this campus 
everyone goes like, where’d you get it from? Okay, 
you pay five? I pay 10. Where’d you get that bro?”

Successfully acquiring Adderall on campus 

is indeed a game of knowing people who know 
people.

It’s not a sin if you’re not a sinner.
How do we define the ends justifying the 

means? “Drug abuse is bad” is quite an archaic 
notion, almost too black and white for our genera-
tion. Researchers cherish categories and numbers 
and correlations, but I find them to be a detached 
approach to complex anthropological questions. 
Humans are smart, adaptable and first and fore-
most, curious. And curiosity, it seems, is a major 
factor of first-time Adderall use.

A crash course on 
alpha males

Content warning: Messages pertaining to violence against 

women and gun shootings.

Oct. 2, 2021
I’m sure you remember it was the beginning of October. 

Though it really doesn’t matter what kind of day it was — which 
day of the week, whether it was sunny or rainy — it really was 
lovely. Fall is my favorite season. It was sunny but breezy, and 
I had a window open to let the wind carry the sweet scent of 
falling leaves into the little study room I’d found empty that 
morning. I brought a mug of hot apple cider and played my 
“spooky study” playlist as I worked. My mom would be arriv-
ing on campus soon. I don’t remember why she was coming up, 
but I was excited to see her. 

I was being lazy, checking Instagram and TikTok instead 

of working on my homework. A Snapchat notification popped 
up from a crudely named conversation group. Was I expecting 
a funny video, an invite to hang out? Again, I guess it doesn’t 
matter, especially once I opened it. 

I could’ve stopped reading after I saw the words shooting 

threat. In fact, I wish I hadn’t continued reading, at least in the 
moment. 

“Those fucking animals deserve (to) die.”
“There is a violent pro-male revolution coming.” 
He was specifically targeting women at the University of 

Michigan. I still don’t know why us in particular. What con-

fused me even more was the lack of concern demonstrated 
by University administration. They said they were taking the 
threat seriously, but there was no mention of classes being can-
celed or extra measures being taken to ensure our safety. 

DPSS and the FBI said the perpetrator was found the next 

day, on Oct. 3, and that everyone was safe. None of my classes 
were canceled; my job went remote for one day. 

Nothing is going to happen. From that Saturday to a week 

later, that phrase rang constantly in my head; when I cried 
on the phone to my mom, when I frantically texted my sister, 
when I emailed my professors saying I’d be missing class. 

When we talk about violence against women, we talk about 

physical harm, excluding the great emotional harm that is 
involved as well. Female U-M students faced collective emo-
tional damage, whether anyone wanted to admit it or not. 

When the Monday following the threat rolled around, there 

was a false of report of shots fired on the U-M Flint campus. 
There was no indication of what caused the false alarm; my 
guess is the heightened anxiety from Saturday’s threat. How-
ever, I fell apart for a moment. My sister texted me, we’re com-
ing to get you. I took an Ativan and stumbled out the door in 
my pajamas. As 
we drove down 
Hill Street, the 
streets of Ann

Let’s talk about who 
pays your tuition

BY HALEY JOHNSON, STATEMENT COLUMNIST

I’ve begun to think that the University of Michigan commu-

nity isn’t really defined by shared experiences, or sports, or “the 
Michigan difference,” or any of the other things people say it’s 
about. We talk about being a Wolverine like it’s something we all 
just choose to buy into — wear maize and blue, sing “Mr. Bright-
side,” go to Rick’s and you too can be the Michigan difference. 

But underlying all this supposed togetherness and camara-

derie is something that no one likes to talk about. We’re all here 
because someone pays our tuition. Someone, or some combi-
nation of people, is paying between $16,178 and $56,962 every 
academic year for each and every single one of us to attend this 
school.

It’s uncomfortable to talk about tuition. Especially if your par-

ents aren’t paying it. There’s no hard data on what percentage of 
students are supporting themselves through college, but given 
the Ann Arbor campus has a median family income of $154,000 
(over twice the median family income in Michigan) and a perva-
sive wealth culture, you have to imagine these students are few 
and far between.

But behind the high-rise apartments, the “daddy’s credit card” 

attitude and the wealth culture are hundreds if not thousands of 
students who struggle to attend this University. There are stu-
dents at this university who feel like people from their socioeco-
nomic backgrounds are invisible on campus. 

As recent U-M alum Mattie Bowen described in an inter-

view, “Most people at Michigan would be considered by most 
people in this country to be rich. And rich people really get 
uncomfortable if you tell them that you’re not rich.”

You won’t hear from any of these rich students in this story. 

They make up the majority of the student body, and their 
story has long been told. Here’s what the rest of us have to say.

***

What the majority of our study body doesn’t understand is 

that U-M financial aid is no guarantee.

LSA senior Trenten Ingell, a recipient of the Go Blue Guar-

antee, explained that his aid package would often be adjust-
ed before the start of the academic year, factoring in more 
money from work study or loans. “T 
here’s always a moment 

over the summer where they process things and say, ‘Okay, 
here’s what you’re getting.’ That’s never the thing that you’re 
getting,” he said. There’s something paradoxical about the 
“Go Blue Guarantee,” which is supposed to cover the cost of 
attendance for in-state, low-income students. But in actual-
ity, there is no “guaranteed” support when the aid you do get 
is constantly fluctuating and students are burdened with 
more loans year to year.

What’s Grindr got to 
do with it?

BY DRAKE GEORGE, STATEMENT 

CORRESPONDENT

Content Warning: Mentions of sexual abuse, abuse of minors, 

graphic nudity

Opening up Grindr is like reading a magazine with no articles 

or captions. Just photos of the sexiest male celebrities, faceless 
creatures we like to flip through like products in a catalog.

Grindr is designed to allow Queer men to find other Queer men 

to hook up with. In my experience, many men will send graphic 
photos of their body, or send a lewd pick up line in an attempt to 
sleep with others in the area.

As a teenager, this app scared the hell out of me. The first time 

I was introduced to the app, I was scrolling on Instagram and saw 
meme posts about it. I heard horror stories from Queer friends of 
mine about boys, just like me, being abducted and slaughtered as 
a result of connecting with a stranger on Grindr. Other caution-
ary tales I heard involved boys my own age being groomed into 
performing ludicrous acts for faceless profiles that they had never 
seen in person.

These stories were enough to instill an aversion to Grindr. I 

promised myself that when I turned eighteen (the age required 
to sign onto the app), I would not be using an app as dangerous as 
that.

Beyond the horror stories, many individuals who did use the 

app at the time had negative experiences that proved my fear valid. 
In a Vox Article from 2018, a poll revealed “77 percent of Grindr 

users felt regret after using the app.” In the same article, the inter-
viewees said “that when they closed their phones and reflected on 
the shallow conversations and sexually explicit pictures they sent, 
they felt more depressed, more anxious, and even more isolated.”

In an interview by NPR, a man named German Chavez speaks 

about how he downloaded the dating app Grindr when he was 13. 
The interview revealed that “more than 100 men across the Unit-
ed States have faced charges since 2015 related to sexually assault-
ing or attempting to meet minors for sex on Grindr … according 
to an investigation by the GBH News Center for Investigative 
Reporting.”

Although the idea of exposing myself to this dangerous app 

initially left a foul taste in my mouth, as soon as I got to college, 
my thinking shifted. I, a Queer man, really wanted to meet other 
Queer men and get to know them intimately. Suddenly, the app 
that had been so scary to me was now providing a great opportu-
nity to explore my sexual desires. I was in the Buffalo Wild Wings 
on State Street my freshman year when I decided to download 
Grindr. I’d finally turned eighteen and was ready to enter the 
world of ‘hookup culture.’

Two skeletons walked into a bar: Why we 
love joking about death

BY REVA LALWANI, OPINION COLUMNIST

Content warning: Mentions of self-harm and suicide
I can’t quite remember when morbidity became a “thing.” Was 

it before or after rainy day dodgeball games in the middle school 
gymnasium? Was it during our first finals season of freshman 
year? Or maybe it was when we were busy running around trying 
to catch an Eevee in Pokémon Go. All I know is that by my soph-
omore year in high school, I would hear at least one suicide joke 
made amid the cackles of my sleep-deprived peers before recess 
had even started.

I made (read: make) them just as frequently as anyone else 

because sometimes, “This is so hard” just couldn’t capture my 
frustration as well as “Death would be easier” could. Soon enough, 
our generation had somehow glorified the concept of death while 
laughing at our shared experience. 

“I’d literally rather die than take this math test,” is tossed 

around at Mason Hall as easily as commentary on Michigan’s 
unpredictable weather.

“Do you think I’d get an extension on the Euchre project if I 

jumped off a cliff and broke both legs?” is followed up with a “Defi-
nitely not. You’d get an ‘I understand your situation’ email at most.” 

And “thoughts on just letting climate change win?” is the new 

and improved response to “What’s up?” Our generation is faced 
with such incredible levels of existential dread that sometime, 
somehow, expressing our concern begins to sound more and more 
like morbid standup comedy.

Whether or not these jokes should even be made is another 

issue entirely, but in examining why this form of humor is com-

mon among Millennials and Gen Z, we discover what exactly our 
morbidity attempts to obscure.

Starting from increasingly competitive college admissions 

and leading to sleepless nights during final season, the glorifica-
tion of death has become a coping mechanism for people my age 
trying to find the silver lining amid the never-ending stressors. 
Gen Z has the highest rates of depression to date, stemming from 
unprecedented levels of academic, personal and financial stress. 
What seems ironic is the extent to which Millennials and Gen Z 
focus on mental health, or, at least, make the performative effort 
to focus on it.

For most of us, the completion of each midterm prompts a self 

care day: face masks, childhood movies (“How to Train Your 
Dragon” is a personal favorite) and comfort food. Mental health 
resources are made accessible to University students right along-
side yoga classes and fun, stress-buster activities. From the “well-
being breaks” that replaced spring break in the 2020-2021 school 
year to the LSA@Play posters that decorate each empty wall in 
Angell Hall, the University seems to have caught on to the new 
trend. Arguably, self-care has never been more advertised than it 
is today — so why do we still prefer dark humor to the other, more 
conventional coping mechanisms that are so readily pushed onto 
us?
