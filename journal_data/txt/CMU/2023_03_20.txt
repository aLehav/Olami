Buggy is a Carnegie Mellon tradition which has existed since 1920. The sport, which is practiced throughout the academic year, culminates in an annual series of relay races held on each year’s Raceday during Spring Carnival, in which teams vie for the title of “Champion.” The Buggy Rolls Report column reports on the buggies and roll counts for all of the teams which attend the freeroll practices (“rolls”) each weekend organized by the Carnegie Mellon Sweepstakes Committee. All of the information reported in the column is provided by the Carnegie Mellon Sweepstakes Committee.
With less than a month left until Raceday, let us revisit our buggy teams and see how they have been doing in terms of spring rolls.
Apex has rolled four buggies this semester: Molotov, Phoenix, Firefly, and Solaris. So far, Molotov has gotten 10 rolls, Phoenix has gotten 10 rolls, Firefly has gotten 11 rolls, and Solaris has gotten three rolls.
SigEp (Sigma Phi Epsilon) has rolled two buggies this semester: Kraken and Barracuda. So far, Kraken has gotten 13 rolls and Barracuda has gotten 10 rolls.
SDC (The Carnegie Mellon Student Dormitory Council) has rolled two buggies this semester: Avarice and Inferno. So far, Avarice has gotten eight rolls and Inferno has gotten eight rolls.
SPIRIT has rolled four buggies this semester: Kingpin II, Seraph, Mapambazuko (Zuke), and Inviscid. So far, Kingpin II has gotten 14 rolls, Seraph has gotten 27 rolls, split between two drivers, Zuke has gotten 22 rolls, split between two drivers, and Inviscid has gotten 13 rolls, split between two drivers.
SigNu (Sigma Nu) has rolled two buggies his semester: Jager and Krait. So far, Jager has gotten 11 rolls, split between two drivers, and Krait has gotten seven rolls, split between two drivers.
PiKA (Pi Kappa Alpha) has rolled one buggy this semester, Banshee, which has gotten seven rolls so far.
Fringe has rolled five buggies this semester: NB, Bumper, Burnout, Baltic, and Blind Faith. So far, NB has gotten four rolls, Bumper has gotten 12 rolls, Burnout has gotten three rolls, Baltic has gotten four rolls, and Blind Faith has gotten three rolls, split between two drivers.
DG (Delta Gamma) has rolled one buggy this semester, Insite, which has gotten five rolls so far, split between two drivers.
CIA (The Carnegie Involvement Association) has rolled four buggies this semester: Roadrunner, Emperor, Kingfisher, and Equinox. So far, Roadrunner has gotten 20 rolls, split between two drivers, Emperor has gotten 13 rolls, Kingfisher has gotten 17 rolls, split between three drivers, and Equinox has gotten 15 rolls.
SAE (Sigma Alpha Epsilon) has rolled one buggy this semester, Eileen, which has gotten seven rolls so far.
In total, across all teams and across all days, 272 rolls have been recorded this semester so far.

"Ain’t baseball great?"
This is what I can only imagine is going through Lars Nootbar’s head.
The crack of a bat, a roaring crowd, it's America’s pastime, and this year, we were treated to a little something special. And while there’s much more baseball content to come, here’s a little taste of the World Baseball Classic.
This year’s already started off strong, with games that could only be considered instant classics. Trea Turner whallopping a grand slam to win the game for the Team USA in the quarterfinals, Puerto Rico’s surprise upset of the dominant Dominican Republic team punching their ticket to the knockout stage, even Italy’s surprise upset of a dominant Netherlands team were all amazing moments in baseball history. With the group round hitting attendance numbers over a million, eclipsing the total attendance for the entire Classic in 2017 and viewership numbers hitting 40 percent in Japan and 60 percent in Puerto Rico, the Classic has gone from another exhibition game to a legitimate tournament for countries to show their skills.
In all this amazing news, there’s a little something that got buried. While other teams were punching tickets and smashing dingers, a little something strange was happening in the neighborhood of Group A, held in Taichung, Taiwan.
Everyone had tied.
Yes, you heard me. All five teams had achieved an identical 2-2 record.
No, I swear baseball isn’t rigged. 
After the Netherlands started 2-0 with wins over baseball powerhouse Cuba and Panama, they dropped their last two games in a surprise upset loss against Taiwan and a less surprising loss against Italy. Cuba, after dropping their first two games, came back to win against Taiwan and a blowout against Panama which played a big part in their tiebreaker. 
And speaking of that tiebreaker, it was a little contrived, and led to a few raised eyebrows. The WBC was using a method called “Lowest quotient of runs allowed divided by the number of defensive outs recorded in games between the teams that are tied.” Catchy, huh?
Essentially, even though everyone was all tied up, what really mattered was how many runs a team had allowed in their games. Not scored, mind you, allowed.
The group sent Italy and Cuba to the knockout stage over this new tie breaking system, knocking the Netherlands and Panama out for this year, though with an invitation to the next Classic in 2026.
The loser in all of this was Taiwan. The country, registering the lowest tiebreaker value, finished in last place. A last place finish not only knocks them out of this year’s tournament, but also forces them to requalify for next year’s tournament.
It’s a devastating result for a team that played their hearts out. Anything can happen in baseball, and Taiwan did their best in front of their home crowd. Unfortunately, they fell just short.
It’s not all bleak though. The Chinese Professional Baseball League, Taiwan’s professional baseball league, will continue to produce the talent that drives this team. The country loved this year’s Classic, and with record breaking crowds, it may be the host for the next edition of the classic as well. A Taiwanese slugger, Yu Chang, was named Group A MVP, with a .500 On Base Percentage, a .938 On Base plus Slugging, and two home runs. After spending much of his career being tossed around from team to team on waivers, this is a breakout performance, and could be the indicator of a long and illustrious career. But hey, no matter what happens, what we know is a guy who batted a career .213 with 14 Home Runs and 61 RBIs pulled off a miracle when his team needed him the most. 
That’s the baseball I come to watch.
All in all, the mess that was Group A probably means that the WBC should take another look at their tie breaking system, but it definitely delivered some amazing games. The Classic is now in the semifinals, with Team USA playing Cuba, and Japan playing Mexico this Monday. It’s bound to be a pair of great games between the four best teams in baseball right now, and I can always root for Mike Trout and Trea Turner to make it entertaining.
“I went out there and played as hard as I could because that’s the only way I know how to play.”
- Ken Griffey Jr.

There is a magical time every year after the Super Bowl ends while we wait to see what the Steelers will do as free agency and the draft loom. Likewise, this coincides with the long slog of the NHL and NBA seasons as teams (hopefully including the world-weary Pens and my Indiana Pacers) prepare for the second season, that is, the playoffs. As we watch for our neighbors in Oakland to try to make some noise in the NCAA tournament, we turn our longing eyes down south, to warmer climes, to the eternal promise of the spring, to the crack of the bat and the sound of horsehide walloping perfectly into the steer hide of a glove. That is right — it is spring training.
This intrepid reporter made his first sojourn to the Grapefruit League in Florida, after two previous trips to Arizona’s Cactus League in years past. There is nothing quite like spring training, where baseball seems closest to its essence: small crowds in folksy ballfields, local residents greeting you as you enter, and countless stories of young kids hoping to catch on to the big league club while older battle-scarred veterans do whatever they can for one more shot, thankful to still be playing a kids game.
I spent several days following the Pirates and came away with some strong impressions as the team tries to build upon its youthful foundation and woeful record on the heels of two 100+-loss seasons. I was fortunate to spend some time at Pirate City, the minor league baseball academy. The team operates out of a former Holiday Inn resort that has a distinctly collegiate atmosphere, only this institution of higher learning evaluates more than just balls and strikes. I was hosted by Kinza Baad, one of the Bucs’ eight pro scouts, and currently the only woman in that position in all of baseball. Kinza showed me some of the cutting-edge technology the team is employing beyond spin rates and launch angles. Kinesiology experts and programmers from Amsterdam use special Oculus goggles that track eye movement as batters track the ball in an attempt to train the eyes to recognize different pitches. Everywhere I looked, I saw evidence of the new baseball paradigm that provides a more holistic approach to baseball development, from counseling and language lessons to baseball history classes and media coaching. The team seems to really care about training these young players to thrive on and off the diamond. And the results are starting to show.
Over at LECOM Park, the big league Bucs have some fierce battles for roster spots as the minor league cavalry of prospects reaches the majors and pushes the vets for playing time. I will concentrate on a few of the players’ stories and who impressed me and who failed to do so.
The team is turning a corner, and hopefully, a .500 season is in sight, setting up potential playoff runs in 2024 and beyond. This team is being constructed from the bottom up, and it is exciting to see those foundational pieces reaching the top levels. PNC Park may soon field a team worthy of its beautiful vistas and sightlines and bring the glory days back to the North Shore.
Spring training baseball results are secondary to player development. That should be a hint that the Pirates went 1-3 in games I saw, where they were matched up against the Yankees, Blue Jays, Orioles, and Tigers. But on to the players, because that is what I went to see.
Part of the reason I traveled to Florida to watch spring training games was to see certain pitchers, namely Luis Ortiz, Colin Holderman, Mike Burrows, Osvaldo Bido, and Carmen Mlodzinski. Luis Ortiz is the #1 pitching prospect in the Pirates organization and was very disappointing during his start against the Yankees. In this game, Ortiz pitched a scoreless first inning but ran into a lot of trouble in the second inning, where he recorded zero outs. His final line was one inning pitched, seven hits, one walk, one strikeout, and five earned runs — abominable. This was a small sample size, but this may be telling that he needs to develop a third pitch. Then again, spring training comes with a lot of caveats. 
The approach, intent, and intelligence Holderman and Burrows bring to pitching are impressive. They harbor expectations for 2023 — Holderman as a potential breakout candidate in the bullpen and Burrows likely the first of several young talented pitchers expected to make their MLB debuts this season. More than anything, Holderman and Burrows could be linked by what they did this offseason, each diversifying his pitch mix by incorporating sliders. These were not offerings just for show but legitimate major league pitches. While both of these guys struggled when I saw them, I am confident they will be pieces of our future. 
Osvaldo Bido surprised me. He does not look pretty; Bido’s delivery is a bit janky. He's what I would look like if I were six inches taller, visibly clumsy, and attempting to throw lefty. With all that said, if he can pitch, he can pitch. Bido set down the Tigers in his lone inning of work in 1-2-3 order — well done. Mlodzinski was selected by the Pirates in the five-round 2020 COVID draft and has been one of the more welcome surprises in major league camp this year. He has yet to surrender a run in five appearances and has posted a 0.83 Walks and Hits Per Inning Pitched, or WHIP. He looked excellent against the Blue Jays. While it is clear that the sample sizes are small, it shows how strong Mlodzinski’s pitch metrics are. Stuff+ is another way to break down a pitcher’s game and try to quantify just how good they are throwing. Like other "+" metrics, "100" is considered league-average, so overall, Mlodzinski is grading out 38 percent better than league average among all pitchers who have thrown at least ten pitches — impressive.
Transitioning to the position players, Drew Maggi was drafted by the Pirates in the 15th round in 2010, and he remained in the organization until he was released in March 2015, rising as high as Double-A Altoona. The truly incredible angle here is not necessarily where Maggi has played. It is more where he hasn’t — in the big leagues. He was there once, promoted from the Minnesota Twins’ taxi squad onto their active roster on Sept. 18, 2021, but Maggi never played in a game. He was returned to Triple-A St. Paul two days later after sitting on the bench for two losses. With 1,045 minor league games and 4,075 plate appearances under his belt, Maggi refuses to let his dream die. He does not have a wife or kids and is not ready to think about either one. His greatest joy remains coming to the ballpark every day, working on getting better, and doing whatever is necessary to help his teammates and hopefully win a game that day. He is a guy that would run through a wall for a team. Maggi has had a great spring. I hope Maggi can make it to the MLB level. Someone could use his service.
For second-basemen prospect Nick Gonzales, a 2020 first-round pick, we have almost reached the now-or-never point. He is getting up there in age (25 years old) and is not in the majors yet. But boy, does he look good or what?! Gonzales made a few nice plays at the 4th spot and swung the bat like a sixth-overall pick would. There was a certain aggressiveness in his approach that was great to see. He was not reaching base via bloop hits and dinks (like Ji-hwan Bae only seems capable of doing); these were hard-hit balls. I am thrilled to see improvement from Gonzales. There is now a real logjam in the infield; we now have loads of talent.
Okay, do not laugh. I have a top-five list (it changes every year) of my favorite players currently on the Pirates: Andrew McCutchen, Endy Rodriguez, Mitch Keller, Rodolfo Castro, and Cal Mitchell. Cal Mitchell seems like a weird choice for a guy who might not make the roster, but I love watching the guy play baseball. Although he is limited to the corner outfield spots because of his lackluster abilities with the glove, he really impressed me last week. Mitchell sees the ball out of the hand so well. He has a great stroke. He truly personified the age-old saying of see ball, hit ball. It is a real battle for the fourth outfield spot between Mitchell, Travis Swaggerty, and Canaan Smith-Njigba (he looked very good, too).
I know I sometimes geek out over analytics, but sometimes you have to stop reading Baseball America and close the Safari tab of Baseball Savant. Jack Suwinski is a ballplayer. I expect big things out of the second-year outfielder. He is who I look to surprise everyone and make the biggest jump.
While there were other players I was hoping to see, namely Matt Gorski, I saw quite a few players in just four days.
It is a great time to be a Pirates fan. We have a talented roster, one that could win nearly 80 games, which would be an big jump. I know the Pirates have been a dumpster fire in the eyes of many fans since our dearly beloved Andrew McCutchen was sent to San Francisco, but the light is at the end of the tunnel. Unfortunately, the days of getting tickets for the price of a Carnegie Mellon meal block are over. It looks like McCutchen’s return to Pittsburgh and the team’s inevitable success will make it harder to find those bargain deals. But hey, I am willing to cough up more money if it means raising the jolly roger more often. It will not be long before the Pirates are once again a competitive force in the league. So, Pirates fans, get ready to see some exciting baseball and to cheer on a team that is more committed than ever to winning both on and off the field.

Men’s Swimming and Diving
This past week, members of the Carnegie Mellon men’s swimming and diving team competed in the 2023 NCAA Division III Swimming and Diving Championships. 
The competition opened on Wednesday, March 15. First, senior Aleksander Tarczynski reached the finals of the 200-yard IM after placing 14th in the preliminaries. In the finals, he placed 15th with a time of 1:49.80, earning himself an All-America Honorable Mention. In the 200-yard medley relay, a team consisting of first-years Arnav Deshpande and Max Kulbida, senior Erik Feldmann, and Tarczynski qualified ninth during the preliminaries. They went on to place 11th in the finals with a school-record time of 1:29.16.
On the second day, Thursday, March 16, a number of Tartans had top 16 finishes. IN the 200-yard freestyle relay, the team of Feldmann, Deshpande, senior Matthew Nagler, and first-year DJ Lloyd earned eighth place with an overall time of 1:21.24. In the 400-yard medley relay, the team of Deshpande, Feldmann, Tarczynski, and Kulbida won the consolation final, placing ninth with a time of 3:15.80, also breaking the school record. Graduate students James Kyle and Jud Kyle also earned top eight finishes in the one-meter diving board. Both advanced to the finals, where Jud finished third with a point total of 497.20 while James finished sixth with a point total of 476.00. Both earned All-America finishes on the one-meter board for the first time. 
On day three, Friday, March 17, some more Tartans earned All-American finishes or honorable mention. In the 200-yard butterfly, Tarczyski finished sixth in both the preliminaries and the final, with his final time being 1:47.89, which also earned him an All-American finish. The team of Feldmann, Deshpande, Tarczynski, and Nagler were able to secure 15th place in the 800-yard freestyle relay with a time of 6:43.26.
On the last day of competition, Saturday, March 18, the team closed with two more All-America honors. On the three-meter board, James Kyle finished fifth place, earning himself his second All-American honor. In the 400-yard freestyle relay, the team of Nagler, Feldmann, Deshpande, and Tarczynski qualified and placed sixth in the finals with a time of 2:59.69, also earning them All-America honors.
With these results, the team finished 11th overall with 100 points, the program’s highest finish since 2005. This also marks the end of the season for the team. 
Women’s Swimming and Diving
The Carnegie Mellon women’s swimming and diving team headed to the 2023 NCAA Division III Swimming and Diving Championships this past week.
The competition for the team opened on Wednesday, March 15. On the three-meter board, junior Kelli Kuramoto and senior Emilia Schwallie advanced to the finals. There, Kuramoto earned fifth with 421.20 points while Schwallie earned seventh with 409.10 points, both earning All-America honors. In the 200-yard medley relay, the team of senior Tiffany Tseng, first-year Audrey Lambert, first-year Grace Malinger, and first-year Eliana Szabo qualified for the finals in 16th with a school record of 1:44.98. The team, with senior Mathea Myhrvold replacing Szabo, earned 16th in the finals with a time of 1:45.51.
On the second day, the 400-yard medley relay team earned points for the Tartans. The team, composed of Tseng, Lambert, Szabo, and first-year Savannah Xu, finished fifth in the consolation finals with a time of 3:48.04, earning them 13th place overall.
The next day, Friday, March 17, Kuramoto returned to the pool, this time for the one-meter board. She placed sixth in the finals with a total of 412.70 points. Tseng missed out on the 100-yard backstroke finals after falling .13 short of 16th place with a time of 56.27.
The final day saw a few more Tartan honors. In the 200-yard backstroke, Xu headed to the finals with a time of 2:00.48 in preliminaries; in the finals, she earned sixth place with a time of 2:00.78.

Few phenomena are a better testament to the complexity of the female reproductive system than the complete firework show finale it gives when it stops working. Unlike most other organs, the ovaries and female hormonal systems “die” long before the rest of the body does because they are not technically essential to the rest of the body’s function. When a person who was once fertile has completely lost, by surgical means or otherwise, the ability to reproduce, they have entered menopause. I like to think of menopause as an evolutionary control, preventing risky pregnancies at old age, but in truth, this mechanism is relatively new, as the human lifespan was not always long enough for it to be observed.
It’s hard to believe that menopause is really just a small death, because it causes so many problems for so many people. The whole situation typically begins during perimenopause, which is the era in which someone’s menstrual periods are irregular but not completely absent. Perimenopause can last any number of years before someone is officially menopausal (sigh). There are a variety of symptoms associated with both perimenopause and menopause, and they’re not pretty. Symptoms range from irregular bleeding and premenstrual syndrome, weight changes, headaches, and hot flashes to all the other things that happen when female hormones — especially estrogen — are out of whack (mood changes, forgetfulness, decreased concentration, depression, anxiety, insomnia). 
I want to emphasize how significant that parenthetical list is. I'll cover this more later, but society, and subsequently women themselves, tend to downplay the effects of regular hormonal changes. Yes, it is natural for someone’s hormones to fluctuate monthly and throughout life. But if you are someone with estrogen, you probably know how disorienting it can be when you suddenly realize that you have no control over how you are feeling (and sometimes acting) and how debilitating it can be to not be able to do anything about it. For folks who are pre- or non-menopausal, these symptoms come and go because estrogen decreases once in a monthly cycle before increasing again. During perimenopause and menopause, though, they can be constant and accompanied by other, newer symptoms because estrogen is decreasing gradually, and for good. The debilitation becomes a constant part of life for a number of years. You might ask, then, why there are no treatments to help with all of these nasty symptoms. In fact, there are. 
For one, estrogen has been packaged as estradiol — a synthetic estrogen derivative — a million times over. It takes the form of birth control and hormonal therapy. There are other hormonal therapies available that administer hormones like progestin as well. Some drugs, like Gabapentin, a seizure treatment, and Clonidine, a high blood pressure medication, have been successfully repurposed to solve hot flashes. Antidepressants and antianxiety medications can also be modified to relieve some mood changes caused by menopause. 
Despite the wide array of options, though, it is rare to find anyone who is using any to relieve symptoms. Most don’t even know that options exist. Many tough their way through the hard years — and not for lack of trying. According to a study discussed by AARP, three in four menopausal women who reached out for professional medical help did not receive treatment. 
There are a few things that can account for this. One is a lack of menopause education for medical providers. Menopause is not widely taught because it is simultaneously an inevitability of life and also not the same for any two people who experience it. Doctors who do not specialize in this area simply do not have the resources to effectively engage with patients who come to them with concerns. And since patients are rarely more informed than doctors about newer treatments, they do not have the means to advocate for themselves. 
For doctors and patients who are aware of some options, specifically hormonal treatments, history is a barrier. During the mid-twentieth century, hormonal therapies were widely used. In the very early 2000’s, though, word began to spread that extended exposure to estrogen could lead to increased risk for some types of cancer and blood clotting. While this is somewhat true and was based on scientific study, it also contributed to an overblown and widespread fear that still prevents some doctors from prescribing hormonal therapy where it is needed, and where the benefits far outweigh the risks. Many studies have been released since the start of the century that prove that estrogen is safe to use for long periods of time, but many patients are never given the chance to try it for themselves.
The way society sees pain in relation to women’s health is likely the most complicated factor that keeps women from being treated. Dr. Rebecca Thurston of The University of Pittsburgh describes this phenomenon as a “high cultural tolerance for women’s suffering.” We take for granted that women can survive anything without outside help, because they almost always are forced to. Women’s struggles with menopause are often viewed as a normal part of aging that is unworthy of serious treatment or insurance costs. And truly, for some, symptoms are mild, but for others they can be completely debilitating. Forcing menopause into a box keeps physicians from fully engaging with it and keeps patients in denial about their own needs. As always, education could be a successful solution to the menopausal misery of many.

Eight finalists gathered on March 6 for the eighth annual Three Minute Thesis Championships, hosted by Carnegie Mellon University Libraries in the Kresge Theatre, to an enthusiastic crowd of friends and colleagues. 
The tradition, which started with a competition at the University of Queensland, has since grown to be international, with individual chapters at numerous universities. The premise of the competition is to explain and make one’s research compelling to a lay audience — all within the eponymous three minutes. Key to the contest is that for the entire presentation only one slide is allowed, with no supplemental props or media, placing a premium on the speaker’s stage presence. Judging is based on comprehension, engagement, and communication style. This year, 41 doctoral students presented their research in preliminary rounds, representing all seven colleges of Carnegie Mellon. Up for grabs was a grand prize of $3,000 and people’s choice and alumni choice awards, both $500.
Durva Naik of Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) took first place, and also won the People's Choice Award. Her project involves an ingestible device for medication delivery intended to stick in the small intestine — a versatile but notoriously difficult target. Naik's pill mechanically locks onto the intestinal "villi" — small hairlike structures — allowing it to stay in the small intestine for extended periods. The device’s purpose is to help encourage patients to take their prescriptions on time; the sticky pill could be taken weekly as opposed to daily. “My research is very interdisciplinary, and the applications also are quite interdisciplinary,” Naik said, citing a potential use in diabetes in her presentation.
Second place went to Maxwell Wang, who has a joint appointment within Machine Learning and Neuroscience. His presentation focused on studying brain activity in natural environments over a period of a week or more. Through an implant, Wang and his colleagues can predict behavior based on what state the brain was in. The project’s larger purpose is to figure out how the brain transitions in and out of disease states. Wang also stressed the interdisciplinary nature of his research: “This experiment really only could happen as a close collaboration between UPMC neurosurgery ... but also combined with machine learning and computational neuroscience expertise at Carnegie Mellon.”
Brendon Boldt from the Language Technologies Institute and Amaranth Karra from MSE won third and the Alumni Choice Award, respectively. Boldt’s thesis aims to interpret AI-generated “emergent” languages using the developed tools of linguistics. Solving this problem, Boldt noted, relates to the origin of language in humans. Karra, who won Alumni Choice for the second year in a row, presented on developing a tungsten-tantalum alloy with high temperature strength for space applications — he cited the Challenger disaster — using 3D printing and a “direct energy deposition” technique.
The four other contestants also gave dynamic talks. Yingqiao Wang from MSE presented on the use of light and nanomaterials to stimulate neurons as an inflammation-free alternative to implanted electronics; Kushagra Varma from Architecture demonstrated a database using Pittsburgh building energy data which can predict building performance into the future; Byron Daniel from Physics explicated ways to measure neutrino mass more accurately; Sofia Martins of Electrical and Computer Engineering spoke on improving the energy efficiency of mobile networks.
As for takeaways on the process of distillation, the competitors had much to offer. “I think a Ph.D. does a great job of training you how to become an expert in your field and become really good at specialized knowledge,” said Wang. “What it doesn't necessarily teach you is how to convey that to a general audience.” Boldt had a similar sentiment: “Whenever I get into the details, it just quickly becomes very difficult to understand'’ — and emphasized that establishing the motivation for his research was critical to communicating it. Karra stressed the need to “engage the audience” with both script and delivery.
Naik offered a message from her win. “Don’t give up,” Naik said. “I'm saying this because last time I participated I fumbled in between, and that's why I did not qualify.” 
“This time,” she said she presented “only to prove to myself.” As for an effective Three Minute Thesis, Naik advised, “keep [it] short and use the easiest words possible.” With respect to next steps on her novel pill, “the next idea is to actually put this in an animal and test whether it works or not.”

Using AI to optimize chemistry experiment conditions
As science continues to advance, the number of publications that scientists must sift through grows. Chemists looking to optimize the conditions of an experiment either have a large team to help them go through relevant literature or spend much more time on their own. Hence, the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) has created a challenge aiming to solve this: the Active AI Planners for Chemistry/Materials Optimization and Discovery Grand Challenge.
Researchers at Carnegie Mellon and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill won Phase I of the challenge in February, pitching a solution that combines expertise in data science and chemical synthesis. But in order to secure the entire $500,000 prize, they must successfully complete the other three stages of the challenge: (2) develop an algorithm, (3) evaluate the algorithm's performance compared to alternatives, (4) develop a program using the algorithm.
The researchers only have the next nine months to complete all phases of the project, so they must move quickly. Hence, the team is working in parallel, 3D printing materials while simultaneously parameterizing the chemical building blocks involved. Then they plan to connect the algorithm to a robot, which will perform experiments autonomously with the goal of surpassing human capabilities.
Ultimately, the project sponsor AFRL hopes that the research can serve as an example of AI-driven optimization that could extend into other fields or problem areas.
A NASA Space Technology Research Institute led by Carnegie Mellon researchers to improve additive manufacturing of spaceflight parts
Sometimes NASA needs to change the design of spaceflight equipment to suit new requirements or environmental conditions. Imagine an astronaut on the moon that needs equipment parts that are expensive and difficult to prefabricate on Earth. One way of creating such equipment is additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, in which parts are constructed layer by layer based on a 3D model. However, additive manufacturing requires high-quality models, called digital twins, that accurately predict characteristics such as material stress.
To better understand how additive manufacturing can be better utilized in space manufacturing, NASA announced on Mar. 16 that it created two new Space Technology Research Institutes (STRI). One STRI, the Institute for Model-based Qualification & Certification of Additive Manufacturing (IMQCAM), is to be led by Carnegie Mellon and co-led by Johns Hopkins. It is expected to span five years, during which the institute will create digital twins of spaceflight materials using physics, mechanics, and machine learning. Once the digital twins are evaluated against experimental material data, they can then be used in digital simulations that will test which material performs better in fractions of the time it would take to do in the real world.
NASA has also created another STRI, Quantum Pathways Institute, led by the University of Texas at Austin. This institute will focus on advanced quantum sensing technology, which uses quantum science principles to get better measurements of data such as the Earth's change in mass. 
Each STRI has been allocated $15 million, funded by Space Technology Mission Directorate's Space Technology Research Grants. Two STRIs have been created every other year, each with the mission of strengthening NASA's ties to the academic community.
Rales Foundation and CMU invest $150 million into new scholarship program
Carnegie Mellon and the Norman and Ruth Rales Foundation announced the creation of the CMU Rales Fellows Program, a scholarship aimed at addressing the "Missing Millions" — what the National Science Foundation hypothesizes to be millions of people who cannot contribute to the STEM field due to racial, ethnic, gender, and socioeconomic barriers. The CMU Rales Fellows Program will provide full tuition as well as holistic support such as professional networks to an estimated 80 fellows in M.S. and Ph.D. STEM programs annually, hoping to develop "a diverse community of exceptionally talented national STEM leaders from underrepresented or under-resourced backgrounds … including first generation students and students from low socioeconomic backgrounds."
The Rales Foundation has endowed $110 million to support the program, Carnegie Mellon has invested $30 million, and both have established an additional $10 million fund. To help with recruiting fellows and advise potential fellows, Carnegie Mellon will be partnering with the Ron Brown Scholar Program.

Yippee and Yippoo and Hoorah, we're finally back! It's been so difficult not publishing an issue for our lovely readers, but we've finally made it through that terrible break. We don't know about you guys, but we are so excited to finally be able to start working on all our engaging homework and projects. We go to Carnegie Mellon not to look good for employers (if the degree in behavioral economics didn't clue you in), but to culturally and intellectually enrich ourselves at a level beyond the Duquesne plebes' imaginings. But enough about us. We've got a great picture book this week, and even some articles to go along with it. Don't miss the playlist at the end, and the cover at the beginning.
As always,
Your pillbox editors

It’s that time of the year again (no, not midterms): performance season!! Whether it be an a capella concert or an S’n'S show, we’re coming up on the season of drama. Most recently, Scotch'n'Soda’s subtroupe New Works Coffeehouse put on a student written and performed show called “Scenefest: Elsewhere.” The stories were individually written and directed, though there was an overarching theme: the word “elsewhere,” which could be interpreted any way. Some of the scenes took place outside of time, others in vastly different planes of existence and the far off places that are the past and the future. The show was well put together, and the performance was a success!! It had a full house, which the club members were very excited about. The scenes were very well performed, and the lighting and minimal set design were great as well. The entire show took the audience with them: elsewhere, far from here.
The show opened with a preface by Esha Gupta and Katarina Garcia, detailing to the audience what the show’s about and thanking all involved. Then the show begins.
It starts out fluctuating between lighthearted scenes and darker ones. "Emergenscene" (written and directed by Farid Khuri-Makdisi) and "Ramen and Mashed Potatoes" (by Arrim Jung, directed by Farid Khuri-Makdisi) were fun stories about an outside force looking into their story. "Emergenscene" takes this quite literally, in which the writer is figuring out how to write their characters. "Ramen and Mashed Potatoes," however, involves fate, time travel, and loud dorm neighbors.
In between these scenes, "Aliya" (by Anoushka Sengupta, directed by Esha Gupta) sends our story’s protagonist from a mission in space back home, feeling betrayed by a friend who just wanted to save her. "Sincerely, With All My Love" (by Kate Hanson, directed by Victoria Yuan) sifts through unsent letters and messages to past lovers/friends, finding closure along the way as they pass each other by. 
"Death Cab" (by Avi Wong, directed by Katarina Garcia) shows us that in stories, fate always finds a way, even in the afterlife. "Yours" (by Esha Gupta, directed by Victoria Yuan) takes us to the cemetery, where estranged brothers find their own closure after a loss. "Carousel" (by Elizabeth Lathan, directed by Luke Frisoli) puts two friends against each other when a magic carousel  and their opposing views on growing up conflict.
"House of Mirrors" (written and directed by Katarina Garcia) follows the tale of a power hungry queen in her downfall to villainy. 
"Finally, Evidence" (by Cynthia Xu, directed by Esha Gupta) marks the show’s end, where two loved ones find a way to let each other know they’re still in love from across the grave.
The show was an hour-and-a-half, and the writers, directors, and actors all did an amazing job of bringing these new stories to life. This is just one of New Works’ Scenefests — it usually happens once a semester or once a year, so be on the lookout! New Works is also putting together a staged reading — similar to Scenefest, but the actors will read the plays rather than perform them with blocking and props onstage. The show date is April 8th, so if you’re curious to see what else the writers have in store, stay tuned for more information on that!

Being home alone in what is functionally the Middle of Nowhere, Pennsylvania, means there’s not much to do, especially during spring break. I was bored. A couple of my friends who were also home on their spring break suggested we go to the movies. I wasn’t sure what was being shown, but I agreed to go anyway. 
Later that night, on the way to buy whatever gas station candy we could smuggle into the theater, we checked what movies we could see. As my friends started bickering over whether to see Creed III or the newest Ant-Man movie, I held up my hands to silence them. 
“Let’s see Cocaine Bear.”
It took a little convincing, but eventually, they conceded. Ant-Man would show up on Disney+ sooner rather than later. It was going to be an experience, I told them. And was it ever. 
The new blockbuster is based on a true story — a drug smuggling run gone wrong, ending with over 80 pounds of cocaine being dumped in a national forest, only to be discovered and eaten by a bear. Here is where the similarities end, though. While the real bear died within minutes of consuming the drugs, her onscreen counterpart does anything but. What follows is 95 minutes of gore, guts, and goofs. 
The movie follows several groups of characters: a mother looking for her runaway daughter, drug dealers charged by their boss/father to recover the cocaine, a cop trying to catch the drug dealers, a group of juvenile delinquents, Margot Martindale as the park ranger trying to seduce her coworker, and, of course, the rabid cocaine bear herself. Sound like a lot? Well, it kind of is, but it’s to the movie’s advantage. When I started to get a bit bored with a scene, the focus usually shifted to one of the other storylines. 
Though there are some pacing problems, I think the movie shines in its over-the-top, absurd moments. I mean, the entire concept is absurd, but the ambulance scene, the kids eating the cocaine, and the bear mauling Jesse Tyler Furgeson are all scenes that stand out to me. The cherry on top is the fact that it is directed by Elizabeth Banks, whose other directorial work includes "Pitch Perfect 2" and the 2019 remake of "Charlie’s Angels." As I said, absurd. 
There have been… mixed reviews of the movie, to say the least. I think the negative reviews mostly stem from a misunderstanding about what Cocaine Bear is. Is it high cinema? No. Is it stupid and fun? Absolutely. "Cocaine Bear" is this decade’s "Snakes on a Plane" or "Sharknado." Complete and utter absurdity, and it is fully aware of what it is. If you are going in expecting to be enlightened by the art of cinema, you will be sorely disappointed. But if you go into the theater with a couple of buddies and some smuggled Sheetz food, simply expecting a movie about a bear on cocaine, you are much more likely to enjoy the experience.

For this week's pillbox playlist, I've once again crafted a story through song to bring you through the arc of the first half of my spring semester. So take about 54 minutes and four seconds to enjoy this expertly curated list of sonically diverse and quirky songs, and absorb the meaning I've imbued onto each. Because I care about you, dear reader, and want only the best for your ears. 
As we are pried away from the comforts of winter break and back into the blustery Pittsburgh winter, Benches tells us "It Doesn't Have to Change" in the beautiful time signature of (I'm pretty sure) 12/8. If only it didn't have to. And for those of us coming from out of state, "PA Nights" by Mac Miller reminds us that maybe this is actually a nice place to go to school.
As the second semester hits the ground running, we immediately find ourselves in need of some good study music. What follows is a run of four high energy, bass- and percussion-heavy songs to motivate you to do whatever it is you need to do: "Final Destination" by NY hip-hop duo The Underachievers, "FREEDOM" by John Batiste, off his Grammy-winning 2021 album "WE ARE, BERLIN" by BROCKHAMPTON, and finally "BUZZCUT" by BROCKHAMPTON featuring a Danny Brown verse over a beat that sounds like if someone put Chernobyl onto a track. To calm ourselves back down we next have the incredibly funky "Fugue State," a purely instrumental song by Vulfpeck, followed by "Lemon Tree'' by Mt. Joy and "Feels Like Magic" by Sports, two songs I'm a really big fan of for no reason in particular. 
This is the point in the semester in which we all went, "hey let me listen to my middle school playlists," which led us all to rediscover Muse. That's where we get "Sing For Absolution" and the unbelievably hard-hitting "Hysteria" (I might pick up bass guitar just so I can learn the opening lick). 
As the weather picks up, we get "my time" by Rav, a single that I can only describe as incredibly sunny. Real Rav stans like me will notice how he echoes the incredibly depressing hook on his 2014 song Solanine — "this is what real life feels like?" — with an optimistic answer. THIS is what real life feels like. If he can get better, so can we all. Next we get "pg baby" by Denzel Curry, an extremely smooth song that just makes you want to bop your head as you walk across the Cut in the increasingly milder evenings. 
Then we take a hard left turn into "Arsonist's Lullaby," a song where the relentlessly heavy kick drum keeps the pulse as Hozier brings us through some equally heavy shit. And to cap things off, we get "Tentpole Shangrila" by Djo, a song I discovered mere hours before writing this very playlist, but included because it's just absolute brain candy. 
Cheers to the second half of the semester. May it be filled with long days and good music.

I’ve never wanted to yell "FIRE" in a crowded theatre. On Thursday night, I was sorely tempted. "Adult Things" is the kind of show that seemingly exists to punish its audience for having free time. Still, it’s worth remembering that the clearly-talented actors are the real victims here. 
The story is set by a pool with three posh, vapid young adults (like last year’s "Bodies Bodies Bodies") and their soldier friend who shows up occasionally. A war is raging and civilization is in ruins. There’s another, minor trio who are hardscrabble conscripts. Anyone associated with the war is a real crab. The soldiers literally have crab-claws for hands — a metaphor for violence as delicate as the claws themselves. It’s an element of magical realism that goes largely unexplored, and is mostly consigned to a sight gag. 
A large chunk of the script seemed to be added only for shock value and contributed little to advancing the characters, plot, or message. No one goes through any sort of growth or even changes of heart — the majority of the show is vacuous conversation. Jokes about sex or naughty words can only be made so many times. Describing traumatic violence in a flat affect has little impact unless it shapes the story, which it largely does not — it’s a disturbing one-off. In one scene, a woman kills and eats her baby. The guy sitting next to me crossed himself, and I think he had the right idea. The character’s callous selfishness had already been established but hey, it couldn’t hurt to throw it in there? 
"Adult Things" has no deeper meaning, but still baits the audience into trying to find it. It is juvenile masquerading as profound — bad writing that falls on the crutch of "simplicity is the point." What’s on the TV screens above the actors — is there a larger point to the idyllic Americana? Nope, no Jordan Peele to be found here. Rich kids don’t understand the plight of poor ones who get drafted — got it. Performative activism by the privileged means nothing — it’s been said. Fascists first target education and art as means of stifling dissent — who would have thought? 
The ensemble did their jobs as well as they could. Moire del Carmen Día played a sheltered Instagram activist type who was suitably obnoxious, and Kyra Klonoski brought more personality to a character who could have easily just rolled her eyes and looked sexy. Antione Gray Jr. wasn’t given a whole lot to work with — calling his character a foil would be giving it too much credit. The best part of the show was an impassioned performance by Trey Caperton as a disillusioned drone operator whose spill-your-guts monologue towards the end shows what this writer might have been capable of — when they weren’t winging the rest of the script with simple declarative sentences. Another silver lining: the media design, led by Reiley Torfun, makes the war-torn backdrop immediate. The booms hit, the lights pierce, and the scrims flash almost to the point of sensory overload. 
Throughout the show, I tried to imagine why someone would be made to perform this, given the opportunity cost. As if the hours demanded by the drama school were not enough, presenting Adult Things served to punish the cast doubly. Nevertheless, if I had to pay any money to see it, I would have demanded the first act’s "YOU GOT FUCKED" banner for my dorm room.

The personal and emotional quintessence of “Wolf and Sheep” is as true to the audience as it is to its creator Shahrbanoo Sadat. The film was presented on Thursday evening in McConomy Theatre, marking the second of fourteen features presented in the annual Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival.
The film is a quasi-documentary, depicting the livelihoods of people in a shepherd village in central Afghanistan without modern technology. There is no central plot to the film, which strays from any narrative structure but manages to show world and its issues with zero common relation to us other than the humanity and nature that the characters communicate.
The picture is cultivated in the vision of its director, and is inspired to reveal the folklore and culture that her segregated and historically discriminated people have. In its short runtime of 86 minutes is spliced the mysterious and magical story of a green naked fairy woman masquerading as a wolf, the inner struggles of children finding meaning in a place where there is nothing of any significant financial worth, and off in the distance, the placement of this village within the greater picture of Afghanistan, with turmoil looming on the horizon.
According to Sadat, she did not have the audience in mind during the film’s production, perhaps referring to a western mindset. For example, one of the questions that was looming in my mind during the screening was whether or not the onscreen and offscreen destruction of animals was an effect, or if it was an actual animal getting slaughtered for the sake of the film. The film’s very opening is a goat being bled. Throughout, there are shots of animals being butchered that do not cut away to signify that this is the very real life these people live. Of course, in Western film productions, the destruction of any animal is a cardinal sin, and so this dichotomy is an interesting situation to analyze. I came to the conclusion that one should not conform independent foreign artworks and ways of living to strictly western moral compasses, within reason. 
In this film, the relationship between men and women is invisible. They are never sharing the screen with one another in any serious way at any point. In fact, in the opening scenes, the men are introduced. After a very long pan, the women come into frame, where they begin having a discussion on the relationships of women to men in certain families. As a matter of fact, we view what the women have to do all day: cook, tend to children, clean, and handle dung from livestock. Not once are we ever shown what the men do all day. That is completely left up to the audience's imagination.
Even further from the men and the women are the children, who shepherd the sheep and livestock around, play with slings, and get into trouble. One scene which shocked the audience was when a boy had his eye taken out by a rock in a sling, showing a grotesque display of blood and flesh. The boy was diagnosed to be blind out of that eye for the rest of his life, and the men of the village came to a judicial decision that the family of the perpetrator must pay the father of the victim for damages, which the father settles for a single bull and forgiveness. 
In another scene, which is perhaps the most consequential to what I believe is the meaning of the film, is when an unseen wolf attacks a herd of sheep due to the negligence of the children herding them. We see how such conflict is dealt with, and the relationship between the defenseless sheep, their predator the wolf, and the negligent shepherd. This relationship is echoed in the very last scene of the film when gunmen are coming to the village and everyone must run away, leaving their houses behind for their attackers to destroy. In the end, they become the defenseless sheep, and the unseen wolf is there to kill them, with no shepherd around to protect them. It’s sort of like the ending to “Fiddler on the Roof.” Although “Wolf and Sheep" does not explicitly state the party which the gunmen represent, they are based clearly on the Soviet invaders of the late 1970s who caused diaspora amongst the sheep villages of central Afghanistan, an experience that the director lived through in her youth. 
The film presents us with the idea that without the shepherd, there are only wolves and sheep, and that the predator will ceaselessly consume the prey until the day comes for their eradication. There must come a shepherd figure to defend the sheep – whoever wishes to stand against the villagers’ plights.
I brought up this interpretation to Sadat, who told me that this was not the intended message of the film, nor is it how she sees the ending. That is what is so remarkable about the picture: that it is such an open story, without any discernible reason to exist other than the wish to exist for its own sake, that the world may look upon it and take their own meaning from it.

"Everything, Everywhere, All At Once" (EEAAO) won big at the Oscars this Sunday, and I am so happy it did. Needless to say, this movie is iconic, featuring a first-generation immigrant mother as a hero, a fanny pack-wielding husband sidekick, and their queer American-born Chinese daughter. Plus, lots of humans with hot dogs for fingers and googly eyes.
First, let's just pause to appreciate the fact that we got a primarily Asian-American story to not only win Best Picture at the Oscars, but according to IGN, to also become the most awarded film of all time. Also, Michelle Yeoh is the first Asian woman to win Best Actress and the second woman of color since Halle Berry in 2002? Damn.
I think "EEAAO" resonated with a lot of people for a lot of reasons, but for me personally, this movie felt like the closest representation of an Asian family living in America, with the stresses of trying to assimilate but also preserve Asian cultural values, maintaining strained relationships, and also just making ends meet. Don't get me wrong, there are certainly others ("Minari" is fantastic, by the way, and I've heard great things about "The Farewell"), but somehow, "EEAAO" feels different to me. All parts of the family are such essential components of the plot that even though the film is sci-fi, the family dynamic is magnified. The film also highlights generational trauma in a way that reminds me much of "Encanto," though it's not quite as much of a focus in this movie.
"EEAAO," released last March, features Michelle Yeoh as Evelyn Wang, a Chinese immigrant mother and wife running a laundromat who constantly feels like she has an overwhelming number of things to do. Evelyn's latest endeavor has been trying to file her taxes before the IRS shuts down her laundromat, but her limited English and happy-go-lucky husband (Waymond Wang, played by Ke Huy Quan) are not helping. She wants more than anything to please her visiting father (played by James Hong), who has never been happy with how she sacrificed everything to come to the U.S. But her daughter (Joy, played by Stephanie Hsu) wants to tell her father about her girlfriend, and Evelyn fears there's no way he'll be able to take it. Also, her husband is contemplating divorcing her. All in the span of one day.
But apparently, throughout the multiverse, a villain named Jobu Topaki is emerging, and no one knows what she'll do with her newfound power. As Evelyn makes her way to the IRS, her husband is taken over by a version of himself from another universe who tells Evelyn that only she has the power to save the multiverse. And to do that, Evelyn must harness the power to become all the other Evelyns in the other universes to defeat groaning tax collectors that are actually Jobu Topaki's followers. Suddenly, Evelyn is everywhere.
Confusing? It should be.
In general, "EEAAO" feels very modern, not only in the characters and premise (an LGBTQ daughter, a villain that's not really a villain, a superhero that's really just an old, tired mom, the whole multiverse theme), but also in the direction. Superhero movies tend to have a very linear storytelling structure, but the sci-fi and multiverse concepts embedded in the movie enable scenes where we're forced to quickly jump between perspectives from one universe to another. The confusion from context-switching mimics Evelyn's constant stress.
In this way, the movie actually celebrates this sort of multitasking mom that has everything in the world to accomplish yet still manages to get it done somehow. It's a nice contrast from films that always seem to try and persuade everyone to relax and take it easy, when sometimes people simply cannot. But it's both a strength and a weakness — as a consequence of her multitasking, Evelyn struggles to make time for the things that are important to her, such as filing her taxes, talking to her husband about their relationship, or talking to her daughter about her girlfriend.
I must also disclose that I am a big fan of Stephanie Hsu, and half of my excitement from this movie stems from her casting. Hsu wasn't very well known in the film industry before EEAAO, as most of her main character roles are from Broadway, starring as Christine Canigula in “Be More Chill” (which was how I came to adore her) and Karen in “The Spongebob Musical.” However, you might be able to spot her in other Asian American roles in movies such as “Shang-Chi and The Legend of the Ten Rings” or “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.” I'm so glad she was able to take on this role in the movie — it really allows her to demonstrate her flexibility and range of character. I also love that between her identities in the movie, it all boils down to being a young girl who's still figuring out how the world works and how she fits into it.
The other actors did a fantastic job as well. Michelle Yeoh really gets the overwhelmed Asian mom role down pat. Ku Huy Quan's character is a bit flat, but little of that is due to the actor himself, and Quan portrays the character as he is written well. Jamie Lee Curtis does a wonderful job playing the tax collector, both the horrific version, the regular old lady version, and the sausage fingers version.
However, there are still quite a few things lacking from the plot. One of the most central characters to the story, Waymond, is extremely flat. His entire personality can be boiled down to "generic happy-go-lucky person who believes kindness is the answer to everything, and sometimes suddenly becomes very good at martial arts."
The multiverse itself is confusing too, to both good and bad effect. The multiverse is only briefly introduced in moments of emergency, so it is never fully explained. This manages to obscure some questions that would otherwise be glaringly apparent: Why does it take so long for the villain to reach Evelyn if the villain can be everything, everywhere, all at once? What constitutes identity — does a rock Evelyn or a sausage-finger Evelyn even count as the same Evelyn? And if the villain knows and can become everything in the universe, shouldn't they also know how to achieve inner peace?
In a way, because the movie underexplains these concepts, it leaves the viewer to sort of make up their own answers to their questions. Perhaps explaining the details of how the multiverse works would actually detract from the suspension of disbelief as people work to connect all the details together. Perhaps the absurdity of this sausage-finger-filled multiverse with rock Evelyns and raccoon Ratatouilles leads people to just not question how the multiverse works.
Maybe we just don't need to know. Instead, we can be like Evelyn, resuming her daily life filing tax returns and making more space in her life for her husband, her daughter, and her daughter's girlfriend, all while knowing that somewhere out there, her life might be completely different.

Ceci,
It's such a cliche, but they really do grow up so much quicker than you expect. I feel like I blinked too long, and now the kids are about to graduate high school. 
Do you remember Sorrels Library? Remember how strange it was that the ugliest building at CMU housed a magical library that made time fly by at ten-times speed? Maybe it's a metaphor for the ugly building that is life, and how investing your energy into something you love makes the time go by faster. Or maybe I should leave the poetry to you. 
You haven't seen the little ones since Thanksgiving before last, no? Or was it even the one before that? It's like we used to be part of the same family, but now we each have our own thing and no time for each other. I guess that's growing up. Well let me catch you up on what they've been doing.
Alex has started looking at colleges, but her absolute top choice is the Shaffer Conservatory, in New York. She's going to take piano as far as it'll go. Who would have thought the child of two physicists could become such an artist? Roy's been getting letters back from colleges, and last week he got accepted at Carnegie Mellon (sorry — "Three Rivers University." I'll never get that right. I mean, fuck Carnegie, but it'll always be CMU to me.)  He's got no clue what he's doing though. I think he's intimidated by having a younger sister who's so motivated by one particular thing. Alex has no scientific inclination, but sometimes she still seems like the smarter one. He's a very book-smarts kinda kid, but I worry that he lacks direction. 
Oh yeah, Clair and I are splitting custody. I'll get weekends and holidays. We were gonna wait for both Roy and Alex to get into college, but we decided it was better for them if they didn't live in a household with both of us.
I just have no context for how to handle this. Dating when you're young, it was easy to roll with breakups because it's like you're supposed to go through a couple of these things before you figure it out. But isn't marriage supposed to mean you figured it out? Where do you go from here?
I've started JuVen, because I have every intention of making the most of my life. Remember how you used to tell me that? I would come to you with questions — "should I do this or that," "what's the right choice here," "what am I doing with my time" — and your answer would always be some variation of "make the most of your life." I'm honestly a little surprised you're hesitant about JuVen, it seems so in line with your philosophy.
I think I'm mostly afraid of losing my wits. Alzheimer's runs in the family, and I probably would have lived to see both my parents forget my name if they hadn't been hit by that drunk driver. I'm turning fifty in a few months, and if I have the chance to keep my mind sharp for another fifty, you can bet I'm gonna take it. I love research and teaching, and I can't imagine what my life would be if I couldn't do either. 
I keep having a dream that me and Clair are back at college together, holding hands while walking over the Schenley bridge. That's the one with all the padlocks on it, put there by delusional college students who pretend that the Bellefield boiler is as beautiful as the Seine. In my dream, each of the locks had two dates — one for the day they put the lock on, and another for the day the relationship ended. Most are months, some are years, and a rare few are decades. 
You seem to have figured it out though. You always do. You and Cynthia had a rockier start than Clair and I, but now I can't imagine the two of you not being together. I'm not trying to bring you down, I'm just so envious you found the right person before I did. 
Everything is temporary, Ceci, makes you wonder what's the point of trying. I still have you, at least. That's keeping me together for the moment. 
Love, 
Andy

Last week, University of Pittsburgh sophomore Agate began mulling whether they should transfer schools. They enjoyed their majors, biological sciences and theater arts. They had found wonderful communities at Pitt, including within PRISM, an activism-focused LGBTQ club. Not even Pittsburgh’s perpetually overcast sky was a factor in this internal debate. Agate considered transferring when they learned about events planned on campus that threatened their identity. They wondered: Why pay tuition to an institution where they don’t feel safe?
“I kind of chose the worst possible time to come out as nonbinary,” Agate told The Tartan. “I came out last semester, so I haven’t really had the opportunity to experience a whole lot of trans joy on campus because I’ve been coming out in the midst of all this.”
“It’s been hard to think about anything else,” said Reign, a senior at Pitt who chose to use a pseudonym. “It’s hard to focus on classes and stuff when you just feel fundamentally unsafe at a place where you’ve been for years.”
In early March, Pitt seniors Nicholas Demjan and Kelisa Hysenbegasi drafted a petition protesting three speakers that conservative student groups invited to campus. The petition, which calls for Pitt to cancel the events, has garnered over 10,500 signatures. 
The Events
March 24: “Everything the media won’t tell you,” with Cabot Phillips, hosted by Pitt’s chapter of Turning Point USA. Phillips is the senior editor at The Daily Wire, a conservative news site whose factual reporting is “mixed,” the fourth-lowest rank on RAND Corporation’s six-rung spectrum. Since last March, 93% of Daily Wire ads have targeted trans identities.
March 27: “Save women’s sports,” with Riley Gaines, hosted by Pitt’s chapter of Turning Point USA. At the 2022 NCAA Championships, she tied for fifth-place with transgender swimmer Lea Thomas. Gaines has since advocated for “a federal law entitled ‘TITLE XX’ (symbolizing female XX chromosomes) that would protect gender equity and honor biological females in athletic competition.” This event is being held on the first day of Pitt’s Pride Week. 
April 18: “A debate on transgenderism and womanhood,” with Deirdre McCloskey and Michael Knowles, hosted by the Pitt College Republicans. McCloskey, a trans woman, is an economic historian and professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Knowles is a political commentator at The Daily Wire. Earlier this month, he called on the government to “eradicate transgenderism from public life.”  
Students Respond
In addition to the petition, an open letter is circulating on the campuses at both Pitt and Carnegie Mellon. Hundreds have come together as a group to discuss the best way they should respond to the planned events. 
Reign described the possible responses as a “lose-lose.” If Knowles comes to campus, he will disseminate “hate speech.” If the debate is canceled, Reign said Knowles would be martyred. 
A Carnegie Mellon undergraduate student studying information systems and human computer interaction said the petition gives students power in numbers. They recognize that it likely won’t get the event canceled, but see it as an important indicator of how many people support their perspective.
The group of concerned Pitt and Carnegie Mellon students have planned a rally for March 24 outside the Cathedral of Learning. They intend to protest the events and stand with trans, nonbinary, and gender diverse students. Carnegie Mellon's PRISM club plans to paint The Fence at midnight preceding the rally.
On Wednesday, Pitt’s Turning Point and College Republicans clubs tabled for their respective events. Some of the students helping organize a response set up their own table, where they handed out flyers and did not engage with the other tables, according to the Carnegie Mellon student who has been kept in the loop. A man approached the students’ table, ostensibly to take a flyer, but instead filmed and publicly posted the students’ faces online.
On Thursday, Knowles tweeted a picture of a sign in Gates that described Knowles as “a genocidal transphobe.” Knowles noted that he was not slated to speak at Carnegie Mellon, to which Carnegie Mellon Republicans responded, “We would love to have you on our campus. Not the friendliest place for conservatives!”
The Tartan reached out to Carnegie Mellon Republicans, who did not answer questions about the tweet.
The Free Speech Debate
“We understand these events are toxic and hurtful for many people in our University community,” Pitt wrote in a press release. “Student organizations are permitted to invite speakers — including highly provocative ones — to campus without University administration deciding what is acceptable and what is not.”
Liliana Orozco, Pitt’s club president of Turning Point, told The Pitt News that “one of the best rights in the U.S. is the freedom of speech and our voices will not be silenced just because some students might not agree with us.”
Pitt’s College Republicans president Dylan Mitchell told The Pitt News, “The purpose of debating ‘transness’ is the same as debating any other topic — to encourage intellectual discourse and to pursue the truth.”
Many members of Pitt’s and Carnegie Mellon’s LGBTQIA+ communities see these arguments as logical fallacies that risk their safety. 
Reign, who is majoring in neuroscience with minors in chemistry and gender, sexuality, and women’s studies, said that framing trans identity as a debate is inherently harmful. “If you’re going to listen to both sides, that implies that both sides are equally worthy of respect and consideration. When one side is saying that a group of people just should not exist … that’s not really a viewpoint that should be considered in an intellectual debate.” 
Tapping into their neuroscience and chemistry experience, Reign offered a parallel to the debate on trans identities. “It would be like if I went to my neuroanatomy class, and my professor was like, ‘Okay, here’s all the correct information. But now I’m going to teach you about phrenology as if it were legitimate science because we have to consider all sides.’” 
Pitt isn’t the only school where Knowles has sparked controversy; he is traveling across the country to speak with college students. The University of St. Thomas, a private Catholic institution, recently declined the College Republicans’ attempts to invite Knowles, citing his public statements on trans identities. However most schools — including private ones like Boston University, Purdue University, and Yale University — have permitted the events alongside protests.
In a country where anti-trans legislation is on the rise, the rhetoric surrounding gender informs legal decisions. Eight states have banned gender-affirming youth care, and 23 other states are considering similar restrictions. Leading medical associations say people who seek this care need it.
On Thursday, Pitt’s faculty assembly discussed the upcoming events and generally affirmed the university’s position: while the speakers may be harmful for trans students, student groups are at liberty to host them.
The April 18 debate between McClosky and Knowles has made some students feel especially unsafe. “If you believe in the eradication of transgenderism and you come to a college campus where there are trans students, that’s putting them in danger,” the Carnegie Mellon student said. 
Moving Forward
Lydia Caldwell, a Pitt sophomore majoring in gender, sexuality, and women’s studies and molecular biology, said that it is important for allies to step up. “I feel like a lot of the time people who aren’t part of the community just don’t really feel comfortable associating with the community,” she said. That isn’t the case for her, and she wishes it wasn’t the case for others. She added that the events being planned and groups associated with them are “scary for other reasons, too. They’re not just gonna stop at taking away the rights of trans people. They’re gonna target other marginalized groups.”
The Carnegie Mellon student we spoke with pointed out a silver lining in the controversy. Responding to the events offered Pitt and Carnegie Mellon students their first “major chance” to unite within the queer community, they said. “I have a whole new group of people I could rely on if anything does end up happening.”

Ramadan, the ninth month on the Islamic calendar, begins Wednesday evening, during which many Carnegie Mellon students will be fasting during daylight hours. To help spread awareness about Ramadan and highlight the students who observe it on campus, I spoke with Muslim Student Association board member Medinat Akindele to answer some commonly asked questions about Ramadan and how it can be observed in our community.
What is Ramadan?
Ramadan is a month in the Islamic lunar calendar when Muslims fast from dawn to dusk and focus on worship, good deeds, charity, and connection to Allah, the Islamic God. It is a time of prayer, community, and cleansing for many Muslims.
How does Ramadan work?
During Ramadan, Muslims abstain from drinking, eating, consuming harmful substances, and doing things that are immoral. Two meals are eaten each day: the suhoor, which is eaten before dawn, and the iftar, which is eaten after sunset to break the daily fast. Aside from food, there is also a strong emphasis on being patient and kind to others at this time. Another important aspect of Ramadan is studying the Qur’an and engaging in group prayer in the evenings with other observing Muslims. 
Who observes Ramadan? Where do they do it?
Over one billion Muslims observe Ramadan around the world. However, not everyone is required to fast during Ramadan. Those who are not physically able to fast, children, menstruating people, and those who are pregnant or nursing are exempt from fasting.
Why is Ramadan important?
Ramadan is the Islamic month when the Qur’an — the holy book in Islam — was revealed to the people. Therefore, Ramadan is observed to show gratitude and cultivate a connection with Allah. For Akindele, “Ramadan is a reset, it’s a gift from Allah to re-connect,” as well as a time of “generosity … like giving charity, cooking for others, cleaning the mosques.” The most important objective of fasting is to center Allah in Muslims’ lives, but Ramadan also fosters other important tenets such as community, healing, and altruism.
How is Ramadan observed at Carnegie Mellon?
The Muslim Student Association (MSA) at Carnegie Mellon offers multiple programs to help Muslim students observe Ramadan here. The MSA hosts a community iftar during which Carnegie Mellon students, as well as people from the general Pittsburgh community, can get together to learn about Ramadan and celebrate breaking the fast together. Also, the MSA has partnered with Chartwells to provide suhoor and iftar meals. And for those looking to worship, the Islamic Center of Pittsburgh is just a short walk from campus.
To those who celebrate, we wish you Ramadan Mubarak!

Last week, the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), a lynchpin for the tech industry, collapsed. Its failure was the result of a number of risky gambles that left them exposed when the economic climate changed unfavorably. When the depth of their financial trouble came to light, panicking clients led to a run on the bank (when many clients withdraw their money out of fear of failure), which prompted intervention by the federal government to prevent the run from causing a series of cascading failures. SVB's collapse has troublesome implications for the tech industry, where it had extremely deep ties. Not only did the bank give loans to many tech startups, it also gave generous mortgages to aspiring entrepreneurs. In an industry where often millions need to be poured into startups before a profit is ever turned, a bank with the willingness to take risks became essential to the fabric of Silicon Valley.  
The failure of SVB ultimately came from a bad bet. After spending the late 2010s massively expanding their holdings and services, they still found themselves with relatively little revenue to speak of. To maximize earnings, they decided to use their assets to buy a large number of long-term government bonds with high returns (as opposed to a mixture of short and long-term bonds, which would have lower returns but would be less risky). On Dec. 31, they filed a routine report on their debt holdings, but disclosed them in such a way that obscured the lack of diversity in the bonds they had purchased. Then, a combination of factors made this risky gamble take a turn for the worst. The tech industry hit a slump and Venture Capital firms started slowing their investing; the Fed raised interest rates, which made the bonds they had purchased even less valuable; and a number of startups in need of funds started pulling more money out of their accounts. The company determined that the only way to continue fulfilling this demand was to sell the bonds they had recently bought at a loss.
On March 7, CEO Gregory Becker spoke to investors and clients at a tech conference in San Francisco, projecting confidence and assuring stakeholders that they were in a stable financial position. Unbeknownst to his audience however, Becker had been informed earlier that week by Moody's, a consulting firm that rates the value of bonds, that their bonds were at risk of being downgraded to "junk." They needed to offload these bonds, or wait longer and risk losing even more on their investment.
On March 8, the company announced they were selling these bonds at a steep loss of 1.8 billion dollars, in addition to borrowing 15 billion dollars and implementing a plan to fundraise $2.25 billion by selling new shares. "Banks are loath to take any of those steps — let alone all three at once," the New York Times reported.
The announcement of this plan led many customers to suspect the company was in much deeper trouble than Becker had been letting on. And on March 9, the worst-case scenario comes to pass: Panicking customers, looking to withdraw their assets as soon as possible, instigate a run on the bank — the second largest in US history, just behind the run on Washington Mutual in 2008. Out of $175 billion in total customer deposits, customers withdrew a collective of $42 billion (22.8 percent).
On Friday when the markets opened, the federal government froze trading of SVB stock, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) acquired SVB. Becker was ousted from the board of directors of the San Francisco Federal Reserve (Becker was one of nine private citizens serving on a board tasked with overseeing the branch of the Federal Reserve that covers most of the Western U.S.). It remains unclear whether he voluntarily stepped down or was fired from this position.
The following Sunday, another bank with deep ties to the tech industry, Signature Bank, collapsed and was acquired by the FDIC. The FDIC is only legally obligated to insure $250,000 per depositor — in other words, any amount you deposited over $250,000 isn't guaranteed to be returned to you if your bank collapses. However, in a statement on March 12, the FDIC outlined plans to ignore this cap and ensure that "All depositors … will be made whole" for both SVB and Signature Bank. However, those who owned stock in either bank will not see their assets returned, and upper management at both banks has been removed. The FDIC has been clear to point out that the money given to depositors will not come from taxpayers. The fund which the FDIC uses to repay bank customers is paid into by other big banks, not private citizens — although, of course, should the fund run out the FDIC would have to resort to taxpayer money. These drastic measures were taken to ensure that the collapse of SVB and Signature would not spill over into the rest of the economy and that damage would be contained within the tech industry.

On Feb. 15, Pennsylvania senator John Fetterman checked himself into Walter Reed Hospital to receive treatment for clinical depression. In a statement from Adam Jentleson, Fetterman's chief of staff, "While John has experienced depression off and on throughout his life, it only became severe in recent weeks." Fetterman is still an actively serving Senator, albeit while not physically present in Congress. Reports indicate that aides and staff members fulfill many of his duties, including constituent meetings, co-sponsoring legislation, and approving statements — including a prepared statement for last week's hearing in which the CEO of Norfolk Southern, the rail company responsible for the derailment in East Palestine, testified before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. 
Prior to his diagnosis, Fetterman was reported to be experiencing difficulty transitioning to life in Washington. For example, to address his issues with auditory processing, Fetterman uses a tablet that provides live captions during meetings and hearings. Fetterman has experienced trouble processing speech since he suffered a stroke in May. Following the stroke, he underwent surgery to implant a pacemaker with a defibrillator.
It is common for stroke survivors to experience depression, with around 30 percent of patients experiencing depression within five years of their stroke. The risk is higher in individuals with a history of depression like Fetterman. According to Manu Raju, CNN's chief congressional correspondent, Fetterman is likely to remain in inpatient care for the next two weeks as doctors determine his appropriate medication dosage.

The 2023 ScottyCon featured a plethora of different exhibits, all of which were hosted by student artists to show off their skills and products for the anime and gaming communities to enjoy and purchase. It’s one of the largest events held on campus, and this year was another in a long line of successful conventions with a mix of fresh new faces and old hands.
While the bulk of the tables of ScottyCon filled the Rangos Ballroom, other installations and panels were held in a variety of other locations, including McConomy Auditorium and Danforth Conference Room. The Kirr and Wean Commons were host to board games, arts and crafts, and other fun activities for people to participate in, and were packed during the event. Meanwhile, the CMU Role Playing Game (RPG) Association set up one-shots and other fun adventures for students to participate in. 
The Dowd Room was definitely one of the more lively rooms to spend time in, with nine different panels starting at noon and ending before open mic karaoke. From anime recommendations to a quick introduction to Dungeons and Dragons, the convention really did have everything for every fandom.
One of the main events of ScottyCon was the Artist Alley in Rangos. With 26 different tables set up for different artists, there was a wealth of different art and merch to buy. The tables were an opportunity to view a showcase of Carnegie Mellon’s talent and depth of artistic creations, with everything from prints to stickers to hats being offered by various vendors. The main stage in Rangos also hosted various events, including a number of quick anime trivia games on Kahoot, as well as a cosplay competition open for anyone to participate in. Directly outside the ballroom, a few vendors had set up places to sell Pokémon cards and video games for different consoles. Across from that, companies had set up rhythm game booths for people to play, all provided by Ikigai Arcade. Of course, even touching the consoles was a commitment, as people flocked to the location and long lines filled the room.
ScottyCon wouldn’t be complete without the people though, and this year’s ScottyCon did not disappoint. It received the most applicants in history, and Rangos felt alive with the number of people who’d shown up to view all the different tables. Across the UC, people in cosplay were everywhere, with fandoms from Chainsaw Man to Doki Doki Literature Club to Genshin Impact represented. The whole place was packed with people passionate about their franchises and stories, and it gave ScottyCon another year of its iconic energy and fun.

China’s president Xi Jinping was endorsed for a third term by the National People’s Congress (NPC) on March 10. The five-year reappointment would make him the longest serving leader of the People’s Republic of China since the country’s founding in 1949, and cements his position in charge of the second-largest economy in the world.
This comes following a 2018 decision to scrap China’s two-term limit for the presidency, and led to speculation that Xi intends to hold onto power indefinitely. In addition to the election, Xi has restructured the upper echelons of power in China in the last few years, replacing many in the Politburo Standing Committee with hardline loyalists this past October. This was preceded by replacing members of the Central Committee with other loyalists and is another consolidation of power. On March 11, Xi replaced Li Keqiang, the Premier — China’s number two, and someone often viewed as a liberal reformer  — with Li Qiang, another close ally of the President. Another major replacement was Liu He, China’s Economic Tsar, considered central to China’s economic transition from fast- to slower-paced growth to tackle structural problems in the country’s economy. He will be replaced with another long-time Xi ally, He Lifeng. Lifeng’s role seems to clash with Li Qiang’s,, and his track record indicates that he may have interest in a statist approach to economic management.
It’s claimed that China’s presidential position is largely a ceremonial one, with a majority of the power over the country consolidated in the leader of the party and the leader of the army. Xi also holds both of those positions.
However, Xi’s new consolidation comes at a time when China is experiencing widespread and increasing issues. The country is grappling with slowing growth, partially due to zero-Covid restrictions, as well as condemnation for their human rights record and a much less positive relationship with the United States. Xi accused the United States of suppressing China and causing its domestic woes. According to a statement he made during the NPC meeting, Xi claimed “Western countries led by the United States have contained and suppressed us in an all-round way, which has brought unprecedented severe challenges to our development.” China and the U.S. trade annually for about 180 billion USD, and the United States is China’s biggest trade partner and second-biggest source for agricultural products.
With new policies on the horizon, as well as a new slew of economic crises, China is facing a very different situation than when Xi received his second term five years ago. How the new expected policies play out remains to be seen, especially with the number of Xi allies in power under the new government.

Three upcoming events at the University of Pittsburgh will feature transphobic speakers. The Pitt chapter of Turning Point USA, a right-wing media non-profit, will be hosting two events. On March 24, Cabot Phillips, editor for the right-wing website The Daily Wire, will be speaking at an event titled "Everything the Media Won't Tell You" on March 24. This is followed by a March 27 event titled "Save Women's Sports" hosted by Riley Gaines. Gaines became a prominent voice against trans women in sports after tying for fifth place against trans athlete Lia Thomas at the NCAA Swim Championship. On April 18, Pitt College Republicans will host a debate on "transgenderism and womanhood" between Michael Knowles and transgender scholar Deirdre McCloskey. Knowles came under fire for claiming at the Conservative Political Activism Conference that "transgenderism must be eradicated from public life completely." A petition to prevent these events from occurring has garnered over 10,000 signatures. 
In a statement from a University of Pittsburgh spokesperson to CBS news, they claim to "encourage intellectual critique … and disengagement from experiences that do not support personal well-being." In the spirit of intellectual critique, we at the Tartan disavow the rhetoric of the speakers at Pitt, and implore individuals to voice their disapproval. Because unfortunately, those whose "personal well-being" isn't supported by this debate can't exactly disengage from the very real effects of transphobic rhetoric. 
Bigoted ideologues speaking at college campuses is nothing new. Many universities face the challenge of student groups inviting speakers who are overt white supremacists and neo-nazis. White supremacist Richard Spencer spoke at the University of Florida in 2017, and Matthew Heimback, who advocates for the creation of a white ethnostate, spoke at the University of Tennessee in 2018. This is a move in the alt-right's playbook that the Southern Poverty Law Center identified as early as 2017, and follows a familiar pattern: a student group will invite a deliberately inflammatory speaker mainly to induce a reaction from their fellow students, forcing others to either produce the reaction they're looking for or ignore their bigotry.
The Intercollegiate Student's Institute (ISI), the organization working with Pitt College Republicans to organize the debate, claims this event is about having a reasoned discussion regarding the nature of gender and transitioning. But that's very clearly not their goal with this event. Their mission statement claims to protect "attacks on free speech" and "students who feel isolated and even threatened if they question progressive orthodoxy." They've made up their mind on the matter, and they're merely looking to get a reaction. And while Pitt may reasonably fear that canceling Knowles' invitation will generate cries of censorship and liberal bias, the truth is these criticisms are being levied regardless. 
While many are signaling their displeasure with the organizations hosting these speakers by signing the petition, a petition can only be part of the response. Hate speech is protected under the First Amendment, and can "only be criminalized when it directly incites imminent criminal activity or consists of specific threats of violence targeted against a person or group." As such, Pitt is right to not intervene with these events. However, we support those protesting this event. 
The Tartan is all for free speech, but why does that speech have to target trans identities? The bottom of the barrel is being scraped when the only discussion topic that comes to mind is one that invalidates the existence of trans people. Transphobic rhetoric is unwelcome in our community, and we will defend those whose identities are threatened by this bigotry. 
There are three main reasons we find a "debate on transgenderism" harmful. The first is the topic of the April 18 event: transgender describes an identity, not an ideology. We don't debate people's ages; it's simply an accepted part of identity. Gender identity is the same and should be treated as such. The second reason is the format: a debate format implies that both sides are equally valid. But with this event, Knowles is automatically validated for believing that trans identities should not exist. The framing provides an inherent, harmful upper-hand to transphobic rhetoric. The third is the context: the debate erases history and espouses alternative facts. Knowles frames trans identities as a new phenomenon when, in fact, trans identities are as old as humanity itself. Knowles has also framed trans identity as something that is forced onto children ("Jen Psaki is literally crying at the prospect of not trans-ing the kids," he tweeted in April). Young trans people choose to transition, a slow process that leading medical associations deem medically necessary for people seeking the care. In short: being trans isn't a choice. We need to step out of hyper-polarization and accept people as they are, rather than questioning their existences.
Ultimately, there's really no winning move for trans-inclusionary folks who don't like the prospect of a hateful right-wing ideologue speaking in our backyard. If Pitt canceled the events, these speakers would be awarded tremendous coverage and publicity; we can either do nothing and let them win or do something and let them win. Arguably, even writing this article is making us complicit in boosting Knowles, a dishonest reactionary whose main accolades include being a podcaster for The Daily Wire (a conservative media outlet that fronts as a newspaper), and a host on PragerU (a conservative media outlet that fronts as a university). 
So if there's no winning move, what's the right thing to do? The answer is to defend trans rights in your everyday life. Make sure you get your classmate's pronouns right, don't engage in cheap anti-trans humor, maybe even engage with people whose beliefs may border on (or are overtly) transphobic and try to guide them in the right direction. The culture war can't be won only by confronting these people in the public area. The far right is deliberately generating outrage so they can set the parameters of this debate, and to even engage with them on their terms is a concession. And while we can't ignore overt bigotry, we can certainly choose to defend our peers from this hateful rhetoric.

So, the Oscars happened this Sunday and I hardly know anyone who watched it. If you didn’t know that the ceremony happened last Sunday, I don’t blame you. According to Nielsen ratings, the Academy Awards ceremony stood at a "low rating” of 26 million views in 2018. Today, 26 million views would be considered a resurgence compared to the attention they now get, with 2021 giving them an all-time low of 9.85 million viewers, 2022 only giving them around 15 million viewers, and this year reaching a peak of around 18 million viewers. 
Suffice to say, the Oscars are not what they used to be, and the attention and buzz that they generated are of a bygone era. Households have, perhaps, realized that there are better things to spend a precious evening on than to watch multi-millionaires pat each other on the back and hand each other golden statues with their names on them. That is not to downplay the prestigious nature of the institution. The Academy Awards are still one of the highest honors any filmmaker can hope to achieve, and they recognize the amount of work and skill required to make a spectacular motion picture. More power to that. We should, however, acknowledge how strange it is that such a powerful institution has fallen by the wayside in recent years.
Now, it is possible to find an assortment of reasons that people have stopped watching and/or caring for the Academy Awards in recent years. One of the most common issues pertaining to this topic is recent years having filmmakers and actors consistently stumble across their own politics on the way to accept their awards. 
For example, in 2020, Joaquin Phoenix won the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Arthur Fleck in “Joker” (2019). Phoenix, upon accepting his award began to speak about animal rights, climate change, and systemic racism, and although garnering much applause in the room, many people considered it inappropriate as the film did not deal with any of the issues which he spoke upon and came off as off-topic for an award show. The very next year, Chloe Zhao, a Chinese filmmaker, won Best Director for “Nomadland” (2020). Ms. Zhao has a history of using her platform to speak against the Chinese Communist Party for their strict censorship of information and human rights violations. Her acceptance speech was heavily restricted on the Chinese social media platform Weibo.
Politics, by definition, cause ripples in audiences, causing some to tune out, some to tune in, and ultimately divides what is supposed to be a celebration of art in favor of a personal agenda. 
But politics are neither here nor there to the point of why the Oscars are a rather trivial way to celebrate art. The idea of pitting films and their crews against one another to attain an award is remarkably unusual. In any sport or game, to beat an opponent means to best them while adhering to a set of rules. There is an objective that is not left up to interpretation, and there is no argument after the match on who won the game. Were it left up to interpretation, there would be no point to the idea of a winner in the first place. The issue with using a competition to determine the 'best art' is that it will never succeed; art is not, nor should it be, competitive. 
This year “Everything, Everywhere, All At Once” won big, taking home seven awards out of the eleven categories it was nominated for, including Best Picture. But just because it won any of these awards doesn’t mean that everyone agrees with the Academy’s decision. Seemingly every year, an assortment of people get riled up in the belief that another film should have won a certain award instead of another. This is because the films are not designed to be “winners” of categories such as Best Picture. Nobody should ever be able to debate whether an athlete — or worse yet, a politician — should have won a match or race. At the end of the day, in sports and politics there is an objective means of determining a winner and a loser. With the Academy Awards however, no game is played, but a winner is still decided and that, in essence, is slightly ridiculous.

"The End of History," a 1992 book by Francis Fukuyama, claimed that liberal democracy — the values and beliefs of the European Enlightenment which informed many of the major Western powers — was to be the last form of governance. Fukuyama argued that liberal democracy had "won" the ideological war, and it was, essentially, the peak form of government. If history was the story of the development of ideologies and governance, then liberal democracies were the final evolution.
This belief, as naïve as it seems to us, was understandable in 1992. The largest economy in the world was the United States, a liberal democracy. Kruschev had predicted that “We will live to see you buried,” but it had been the United States watching over the fragmentation and funeral of the Soviet Union. Boris Yeltsin, the new Russian president, was amenable to the United States, and the U.S. appeared to be on track to become a friend to Russia. The second largest economy was Japan, an incredibly powerful economic machine. 
But in the two decades that followed, this paradigm was destroyed. Japan stagnated more than ever expected, seeing three decades without economic growth. In Iraq, the United States betrayed its liberal principles and pushed away its allies in Europe. The economy that grew to eclipse Japan was the People’s Republic of China, an authoritarian regime more in the image of the Soviet Union or Yugoslavia than the United States, Japan, or Korea.
This is a lot of background for an event that happened in the last few years. Xi Jinping, the current head of the Communist Party of China, the head of the People’s Liberation Army, and now the President of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), has won an unprecedented third term. And while that’s a lot of titles for one man, it represents the strength of his power among the Chinese ruling class. Xi isn’t simply one part of the cog that is the government of the PRC — he is the government.
His government is facing unprecedented crises. Upon pushing through his recent cabinet appointments, Xi is facing slowing economic growth, and significant problems with the housing sector. The PRC has cultivated agreements and relations with countries across the world, but the massive Belt and Road Initiative seems to be wildly underperforming. And as a manufacturing economy, China faces its biggest threat yet — the country recorded population decline, the first time that has happened since a famine in 1961. Demographics are a ticking clock for the manufacturing economy that sustains China. With new policies, Xi has attempted to increase fertility, bring back expats, and rebuild the economy; but unless things change, workers will become a finite resource. When the current working class retires, there will be a much smaller pool paying into the social services necessary to take care of them. 
Xi has announced moves to stem some of the bleeding. First, he wants to take care of investors and make China seem less of a threatening place to park your money. After the three month disappearance of Chinese billionaire Jack Ma, many investors are less than thrilled to trust the country with their assets, and China has started to advertise itself as business friendly in an effort to bring those investors back. With large money managers steering clear of China’s assets, this change should bring cash influx to the economy — money that can be used for more infrastructure and investments to keep money flowing. China has been losing money on high speed rail, and without funding to keep it afloat, the lines — and the staff that maintains them — stand to lose their jobs. 
What remains, however, is the decreasing population. China hopes to attract immigration like the United States, the only major power currently projected to see a population increase in the next 50 years. If China’s population truly has peaked, or if the reports of overcounting are true, then the country will need to transition, fast, to automation and a service economy. Otherwise it runs the risk of a worker-based manufacturing economy without the workers to base it on. While China has increased the number of children legally allowed, this hasn’t done much to alleviate the very low birth rate in the country.
Finally, there’s the thorny issue of Taiwan. Taiwan, as of now, remains the largest and most important semiconductor manufacturer in the world. It houses the best trained, best experienced, and best managed plants, and is responsible for a huge amount of the circuitry that goes into every single everyday object.
That makes it a very big problem for the U.S. and for China. For China, Taiwan represents the old government the Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang, or KMT). While the KMT lost power to the more pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), China still claims Taiwan as Chinese territory, and it has forced many international groups to label the country as “Chinese Taipei.” However, the U.S. has maintained strategic ambiguity on Taiwan, refusing to acknowledge it as a country, but still working with it as an autonomous region of China. After claiming U.S. suppression, increasing excursions into Taiwanese airspace, and saber-rattling at U.S. officials visiting the Island, Xi now faces the reality that the U.S. may defend Taiwan in the same way that it has defended Ukraine. 
With that in mind, as well as the fact that China does not possess the military capability to assault Taiwan, the island has remained a serious problem. Xi announced the need to suppress pro-independence voices in Taiwan at the end of the National People's Congress (NPC) meeting this month, and by replacing much of the reformist or liberal voices in his cabinet with hardliners, may have closed off a diplomatic solution to the island altogether. 
China is currently the largest autocratic regime in the world, with the Russian Federation in close second, and in recent years, has become more and more confrontational against the United States. With Xi receiving what seems to be the go-ahead to hold power indefinitely, this is the newest iteration of the Soviet Union — and Fukuyama’s End of History is put further and further in the distance.

"Oh boy, an SVB piece in Forum!" you think to yourself. I know what you're expecting. You probably think I'm going to write some tepid rehashing of the prevailing talking points on leftist Twitter. Maybe I'll say something like, "This is just like 2008!", or "You can't privatize earnings and socialize the losses!", or maybe even, "The consistent failure of our government to rein in the reckless gambling of the wealthy is a scathing indictment of neoliberal capitalism," and so forth. See, the thing is, I'm actually smarter and better than everyone else on Twitter, and so that's not going to be the focus of this article. Instead of talking about all that, I'm going to tell you about a community of weird little stock market freaks on Reddit and why they frighten me. 
After writing about Bed Bath and Beyond last month, I now get automatic emails from Reddit with posts from r/Wallstreetbets, a notorious subreddit of day traders, crypto enthusiasts, and meme-stock pushers who were responsible for the 2021 GameStop short-squeeze (in brief, a lot of hedge funds were betting that GameStop was going to continue decreasing in value, and r/WallStreetBets artificially raised its stock price to screw them over). And last Friday, their top post was ominously titled "this is about to get very interesting." It came from legendary user u/atobitt, who was breaking six months of silence to weigh in on the recent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. It reads like the words of a doomsday preacher, predicting that "the next couple of months will reveal the master's true hand. We will see the cards laid upon the table as they collapse from the house on which they were built." This was clearly a big deal; as user u/AwildYaners points out, they'd "never been this zen, or early, on an atobitt post." 
User u/atobitt was a participant in the original 2021 GameStop short squeeze, and seems to periodically come out of the woodwork to make a vague prediction about an upcoming reckoning. So what exactly is he predicting?  
An explainer post on r/SuperStonk, the primary subreddit for GameStop-specific discussion, breaks down the community's dogma. What they foresee is another GameStop short squeeze that makes 2021 look like child's play — the so-called "Mother Of All Short Squeezes" (MOASS). And it's absolute lunacy. They claim that "predictions of the short squeeze potential range from $10,000 per share, to $100 million per share." It includes an absolutely fascinating infographic about what to do during the glorious day of rapture when the MOASS arrives and the value of GameStop goes to literally infinity dollars — no, that's not a joke. The post also claims that there's "evidence suggesting there is no theoretical ceiling on what the price could climb to." I highly recommend it if you want to understand the level of delusion in this community.
Let's take a moment to really understand the worldview of these people. They understand the exploitation and injustices of capitalism; they are disillusioned by the actions of big banks and corporations, and feel that they've been sold a lie their whole lives. In the u/atobitt post I mentioned at the start of the article, user u/Biotic101 says, "We are gamers, we are curious, we do not fear grinding. Thus, we have been climbing down deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole. We have discovered how the world really works. And it makes you feel as if you have been asleep in the Matrix all your life and you just woke up."
To be fair, much of their worldview is based in truth. They correctly believe there is tremendous fraud in our financial systems, and that the wealthy use the instruments of capitalism to screw over everyday folks. It's an exploitative system in which interactions are turned into transactions, every aspect of human nature is commodified, etc. and so forth. But as I argued in my article on Bed Bath and Beyond, these communities don't desire to replace this system with a better one, or even to amend it. They're just waiting for their Armageddon — some nebulously-dated day of judgment when the old guard implodes and they become the new wealthy. They seem to sincerely believe that they will become multi-millionaires. And that day of reckoning is always tantalizingly close. Never mind last month when they said it would happen this month. They did their Due Diligence (DD) this time around, read the right scripture and studied the star charts. This is the time they'll get it right. 
There is an ocean of explainer posts and YouTube videos to bring new users up to speed on all this, and they all read like a pitch from a pyramid scheme or televangelist. 'This is the investment of a lifetime that The System doesn't want you to know about! Just send us five dollars of seed money, and the Lord will see that this blessing is returned to you a hundredfold!' They honestly compare investing in GameStop to buying BitCoin in 2009 or Apple stock in the 70s.
Except, none of that's going to happen. Oh sure, GameStop might short squeeze again — in the interest of not wanting to look silly if it does, I'll concede the possibility. It happened before and it could certainly happen again, especially considering how feverishly devoted these people are to their cause. I would, however, imagine that the hedge funds who got blind-sided in 2021 have learned their lesson and adapted accordingly. Even if it does happen though, I find it impossible to believe it will be the kind of earth-shattering implosion of the stock market that they predict. So the question is, what will these people do when the promise is broken too many times?
We already got a glimpse of this in August when their idol, "Papa Cohen," pulled the rug out from under them. Ryan Cohen is an entrepreneur with a Musk-ian penchant for rallying millions of Redditors to his cause by virtue of being a serious businessman who also speaks in memes. His involvement in Gamestop was, while not the sole cause, extremely crucial in fueling the 2021 short squeeze. In August 2022, he made a routine filing of his position in Bed Bath and Beyond (BBBY), which led to a small rally in its stock value. But unbeknownst to his followers, that very same day he had actually sold all his shares in BBBY — something the rest of us only learned the next day. Legally, I'm not accusing him of enacting a pump-and-dump. I'm merely stating my opinion that it looks like a pump-and-dump. And the subreddits lambasted him for this, feeling intensely betrayed by the one man who they thought was truly working for them. 
These people buying GameStop are, for the most part, young men, many of whom self-identify as gamers, tech savvy, probably addicted to the internet, and desperate for companionship. It's no coincidence that most of their slang focuses on instilling a sense of community. One of their terms, A.P.E, means "All Primates Eat" — in other words, look out for one another. User u/hmoonves tells us,  "the high from buying GameStop shares is unlike anything I’ve ever experienced." There's also substantial overlap between memestock buyers and the crypto buyers; most of their in-group slang is the same, and much of their ideology overlaps (as many hype-posts point out, GameStop's new management is allegedly getting into the NFT market). It's not particularly surprising, because it requires a similar mindset to buy either. You need to believe you're on the inside of some exciting new tech or commercial venture that is going to break the old financial institutions, and now matter how much others scoff, you're going to prove them all wrong when you become a millionaire one day.
It's a community living in an information tunnel who are absolutely convinced that their day of reckoning is coming, with an emotional dependence on being one day vindicated. The collapse of SVB (remember when I said this article was about SVB?) certainly doesn't bode well for the tech industry. But these communities are so myopically focused on their own success that they only see it as a sign of the impending financial collapse they've been praying for. But it won't do what they hope it will, and sooner or later their patience will run out.
And what do you get with a large, organized group of angry, young men who feel disenfranchised and betrayed by the status quo? It's an ideal ground for fascism, but this time uniquely flavored by millennial/zoomer meme culture, tech fetishism, and crypto-bro libertarianism. I'm certainly not the first to make this argument, but the frightening potential of this community still feels relatively under-discussed. 
Cryptocurrency, NFTs, and memestocks all get their value from having a massive pool of speculative investors buying in, not from possessing any actual utility. It's a greater-fool scheme — money keeps flowing in, giving the illusion of value, as long as there's a greater fool to buy-in after you. This entire community has stayed afloat purely because the immense cultural presence of cryptocurrency means that they have a very, very large crowd of fools to draw from. But it will falter one day, and when that happens we will have to deal with thousands of broke and despondent Redditors scrambling for someone to direct their anger at.

Novel-tea is The Tartan’s literary and language opinion column, so if you like hot takes and reading about cool ideas in the literary community then this is the place for you!! If you have your own hot take to add to this column, do not hesitate to contact us.
The literary world has been transformed by the business acquisitions of the Big Five publishers (Penguin Random House, Hachette, Macmillan, HarperCollins, and Simon & Schuster). These publishers fight for our attention every step of the way, particularly making use of social media communities like BookTok and Bookstagram. They seek to replicate the successes of major book hits through early investment and promotion. 
To a large extent, it’s working. According to WordsRated (a publishing industry research group), the Big Five control over 80 percent of the book trade market and generate 64 percent of its revenue (aside from educational books), which amounts to over $12 billion per year as of 2021.
However, this business strategy leaves a gap for inventive and creative literature: books that aren’t necessarily guaranteed bestsellers, but are groundbreaking, exciting literature. As Nathan Scott McNamara put it, “Major presses are inadvertently helping foster an environment for indie presses to thrive at the very thing they’re best at: being small.” Indie presses like Graywolf, Coffee House Press, and Europa Editions have promoted some of the most interesting books in the industry. Many of my favorite books come from these presses, to name a few: “Breasts and Eggs” by Mieko Kawakami (Europa Editions), “The Lying Life of Adults” by Elena Ferrante (Europa Editions), and “The Twilight Zone” by Nona Fernández (Graywolf). All of these books have a strange, captivating quality to them that is fostered by indie presses.
That is not to say the Big Five do not churn out interesting literature, but it is to say that indie presses have the space, ability, and reputation to produce some of “the best, weirdest, and most relevant work possible.” 
In short, books are cool, so don’t be afraid to experiment with where you look for them.

There’s only one thing more ubiquitous with the college experience than tuition hikes, and that’s alcohol. Over spring break, I had the unfortunate pleasure of learning what a “BORG” is. The “black-out rage gallon” is the concoction of college students' dreams. You start with a plastic gallon jug of water and dump half of it out. You then fill it back up with some combination of alcohol, flavoring, and electrolyte powder (like Liquid I.V.) or caffeine. This combination dilutes the alcohol flavor while attempting to minimize the effects of hangovers. 
While the contents of the BORG are important, drinkers will also name their BORG something relevant to the concoction. While I have never made a BORG (nor do I ever intend to), we like coming up with BORG names. Some of the highlights include: GettysBORG Address, Harrison BORGeron, CheeseBORGer, Ruth Bader GinsBORG, and BORG this way. Start coming up with some names now so you can be the friend that can perfectly name others’ BORGs when they’re struggling.
While I love the naming aspect of BORGs, good Lord people! Please learn how to pace yourselves when drinking and proportion your drinks properly. I’m going to bet that most BORGs have way more alcohol in them than they should. Sure, people are drinking these things over the course of night, but 20 shots is still 20 shots. That’s dangerous!
On the weekend of March 11, a total of 46 University of Massachusetts Amherst students were hospitalized for alcohol poisoning, with 28 ambulances being called. I get that this past weekend was Saint Patrick’s Day and spring break for many people, but that’s not an excuse to drink so much you have to go to the hospital. I know it’s asking a lot, but it’s not too hard to measure how much alcohol is going into your BORG.
While BORGs might be dangerous, it can’t be denied that there are some benefits to BORGs. For instance, since you can close a BORG (as it is in a plastic jug), it’s much harder for any contaminants to enter people’s drinks, like when they are in the traditional Red Solo Cup. This includes protection against roofies and other date-rape drugs. 
Additionally, if an individual correctly portions their drink, then they will know exactly how much alcohol they have consumed by the end of the night. The water and electrolyte powder in BORGs will also keep the drinker hydrated — a big plus for those who forget to drink water when consuming alcohol. Naming the drink also gives the benefit of making sure people are able to correctly identify their BORG and can potentially provoke conversations with strangers!
Within BORGs is a massive amount of genius and stupidity. College students (and many adults, for that matter) can’t exactly be trusted to consume a “safe” amount of alcohol (though realistically, no amount of alcohol is safe). I can definitely see the benefits over the standard red Solo cup drink, but only when the drinker is careful and isn’t actually trying to black out. So if you’re looking to make a BORG, make sure to come up with a great name and drink responsibly.
