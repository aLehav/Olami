Faced with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last Thursday, many facets of the sporting world, ranging from athletes to committees, have mounted strong responses in condemnation of Russia and in solidarity with Ukraine.
The soccer world was among the quickest and most vocal. On Friday, the Union of European Football Association’s (UEFA) Executive Committee announced that the Champions League final, which was slated to be played in the Gazprom Arena in St. Petersburg, would be relocated to the Stade de France in Saint-Denis. The UEFA Executive Committee stated::
“UEFA wishes to express its thanks and appreciation to French Republic President Emmanuel Macron for his personal support and commitment to have European club football’s most prestigious game moved to France at a time of unparalleled crisis. Together with the French government, UEFA will fully support multi-stakeholder efforts to ensure the provision of rescue for football players and their families in Ukraine who face dire human suffering, destruction and displacement.”
All of the clubs and national teams hailing from Russia and Ukraine which are competing in UEFA competitions must play home matches at neutral venues. In addition, UEFA is expected to end its 40-million-euro sponsorship deal with Russian state-owned gas company Gazprom in the near future. Although UEFA is in discussion with its legal team regarding the severance, Gazprom advertisements must still be aired in the meantime.
After the decision, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying, “It’s a shame that such a decision has been made,” and “St. Petersburg could have provided all favorable conditions to hold this festival of soccer.”
Polish Football Association president Cezary Kulesza took to Twitter on Saturday, stating, “In light of the escalation of the Russian Federation’s aggression against Ukraine, the Polish national team is not going to play a match against the Russian Republic.” He declared: “This is the only right decision.”
Later that same day, the Swedish Football Association followed suit, releasing a statement reading, “The men’s national team will not play against Russia — regardless of where the match is played. The Federal Board also urges FIFA to cancel the play-off matches in March in which Russia participates.”
On Sunday, the Executive Committee of the Czech Football Association made a similar decision, proclaiming that “the Czech FA executive committee, staff members and players of the national team agreed it’s not possible to play against the Russian national team in the current situation, not even on the neutral venue.”
Teams at the domestic level have taken action as well. German club Schalke 04 were among the first to respond, announcing their decision to remove the logo of main sponsor Gazprom from their jerseys less than 12 hours after the initial invasion.
Shortly following the U.K. government’s ban on the operation of Russian national airline Aeroflot within its borders as part of its sanctions on Russia, a Manchester United spokesperson stated stated that, “in light of events in Ukraine, we have withdrawn Aeroflot’s sponsorship rights. We share the concerns of our fans around the world and extend our sympathies to those affected.”
Across the top two tiers of Spanish soccer, messages of “No a la guerra” (“No to war”) were displayed in protest of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Soccer is not the only sport that has mounted responses against Russia. The Russian Formula 1 Grand Prix, which was scheduled to take place on Sep. 25 in Sochi, was canceled by the Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA), who declared that they are “watching the developments in Ukraine with sadness and shock” and that “it is impossible to hold the Russian Grand Prix in the current circumstances.”
American Formula 1 racing team Haas has also dropped Russian company Uralkali’s branding and logo of Russian company Uralkali from its car. The company’s founder, Dmitry Mazepin, is a close associate of Vladimir Putin, and the status of his son, Nikita Mazepin, as a driver for Haas, is still in discussion.
The International Basketball Federation (FIBA) postponed the Netherlands-Russia game slated to be played (as part of the FIBA Basketball World Cup 2023 European Qualifiers) on Sunday, as well as the Great Britain-Belarus game scheduled for Monday. The U.K. Home Secretary, Priti Patel, canceled the Belarusian Men’s Basketball Team’s visas, but received significant backlash online from those who pointed out the futility of the gesture while the U.K.’s borders remain firmly closed to Ukrainian refugees](https://www.businessinsider.com/boris-johnsons-government-resists-call-for-uk-to-home-ukraine-refugees-2022-2).
In addition, the International Ski Federation (FIS) has canceled all remaining events of the 2021-22 season that Russia was scheduled to host. The Norwegian Ski Federation, which will host multiple alpine and cross-country skiing World Cup races, and who will co-host the Nordic ski disciplines’ junior world championships, stated, “The Norwegian Ski Federation’s message to Russia and Russian athletes is crystal clear: We do not want your participation.”
The Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) postponed The Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) postponed the Moscow CH 80 tournament indefinitely but has not made a formal statement regarding the invasion and has not officially canceled the event. Within the sport of tennis, however, many players have taken strong stances. Current world number one Russian Daniil Medvedev declared that he is “all for peace” and wants to “promote peace all over the world.” Fellow countryman Andrey Rublev signed “No war please” on the camera lens following his victory in the Dubai Open (players often sign the camera lens following a win). Ukrainian star Elina Svitolina has also spoken out in support of her home country:
“I decided that the prize money from my upcoming tournaments here in Mexico and in the States will go to the Ukrainian Army and to humanitarian needs. So like this, I can help my country. And this, I think, is the right thing to do at the moment. And I want to do something and to help my country. To the people in the world, I would say to try to understand that we’re losing innocent people, we’re losing soldiers and we’re constantly under attack. I want them to go on the streets to join people outside, try to bring attention and do what they can for our country to stand with Ukraine.”
With the both the 2022 World Junior Swimming Championships and the 2022 World Short Course Swimming Championships set to take place in Kazan, Russia, the Ukrainian Swimming Federation has petitioned the Fédération Internationale De Natation (FINA) to relocate these competitions. Nine Nordic aquatic federations have joined Ukraine, declaring that they will not compete in any event staged in Russia or Belarus. Although FINA has not made a formal public announcement on how they intend to proceed, information reportedly leaked by the Danish Swimming Federation suggests that the organization has already decided to relocate the aforementioned championships.
Although it has yet to take any formal action, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) asked sporting bodies on Friday to relocate or cancel all upcoming sporting events set to take place in Russia and Belarus, as well as to cease using their flags and national anthems. The IOC condemned the two countries’ breach of the Olympic Truce established prior to the Beijing 2022 Olympics — that a general truce should be observed seven days before the opening of the Olympic Games (Feb. 4) until seven days after the closing of the Paralympic Games (March 13). Despite calls to sanction Russian and Belarusian Paralympic Committees, however, the IOC have not taken tangible action against either party.
Though athletic sanctions and relocations of events may not have major political impact, the response of the sporting world to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is critical nonetheless. Sport is a medium through which individuals and countries have engaged each other for centuries. Sporting events today are the subject of significant viewership, with events such as the UEFA Champions League garnering hundreds of millions of viewers. As such, it is the responsibility of athletes, but especially of sporting federations, committees, and organizations to take hold of what power they have — regardless of the degree of actual influence they have — and act.

Men’s Swimming and Diving
On Feb. 25 and Feb. 26, members of the Carnegie Mellon swimming and diving team competed in the NCAA Division III Region 4 Diving Championship at Ithaca College. On the first day, senior James Kyle placed first in the three-meter board by a 60 point margin over second place with a score of 552.75. This earned him the title of regional champion — the first Tartan men’s diver to do so — and will automatically advance to nationals, which will take place from March 16 through March 19, in Indianapolis.
Senior Judson Kyle took eighth out of 16 in the same event with a score of 450.45. First-year Johnathan Lindstrom also had a good showing on the three-meter board with 408.55 points, earning him 10th place.
On the second day, Judson Kyle placed sixth on the one-meter board with a total score of 438.15, immediately followed by James Kyle, who scored 436.80 points. In the same event, Lindstrom finished 14th with a combined score of 388.50.
Women’s Swimming and Diving
Two Tartans from the women’s diving team also traveled to the NCAA Division III Region 4 Diving Championship at Ithaca College: junior Emilia Schwallie and first-year Kyndall Tatum. Schwallie had a solid performance, placing seventh out of 19 with a score of 422.70 on the three-meter board and 11th out of 21 on the one-meter board, scoring 382.35 points. Tatum scored 368.20 points on the three-meter board and 345.00 points on the one-meter, placing 15th and 18th, respectively.
Men’s Track and Field
On Feb. 26 and Feb. 27, the Carnegie Mellon men’s indoor track and field team competed at the University Athletic Association (UAA) Indoor Track and Field Championships at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. The Tartans placed second out of seven with 150 points, just behind Washington University in St. Louis, which had 176.5 points, and ahead of University of Chicago, which scored a total of 121 points.
Highlights from Carnegie Mellon’s field team include senior Justin Kiefel winning triple jump with a mark of 14.45 meters and graduate student Bram Miller winning shot put with a throw of 16.95 meters, with junior Bailey O’Malley right behind him in second with a throw of 15.39 meters. In pole vault, first-year Casey Potrebic placed third with a recorded height of 4.11 meters.
The Tartans’ track team also had a strong performance. Sophomore Andrew McGovern took first in the 800-meter run with a time of 1:55.18 (a personal best). Fellow sophomore Alex Ivanov finished right behind him with another personal-best time of 1:55.29. First-years Aleksei Seletskiy and Colin McLaughlin ran season-best times of 4:11.56 and 4:13.17 in the mile run, placing third and sixth, respectively. In the 3,000-meter run, senior Michael OBroin finished fourth with a time of 8:28.08.
Women’s Track and Field
The women’s indoor track and field team also traveled to Case Western to compete in the UAA Indoor Championships. They scored 74 points. This marked the best-ever finish for the women’s team at this event, placing them behind the University of Chicago (208 points) and ahead of Emory University (45.5 points).
Notably, junior Elizabeth Barre completed a high jump of 1.65 meters, earning her first in the event and a person best. She then went on to get another personal best in the 60-meter hurdles with a time of 9.11 and placing fifth. Junior Samantha Giordani matched Barre’s energy when she won the 200-meter dash with a time of 25.37 seconds and then tied the school record in the 60-meter dash with a time of 7.83, placing third in the event. The 4x400-meter relay team made of Barre, Giordani, sophomore Isabella Rhee, and senior Taylor Jacobs earned an All-UAA recognition after finishing third in the event with a time of 4:00.12.
Other Tartans on the field team also had a strong showing. First-years Taylor Symonette and Katie Monahan placed sixth and eighth, respectively, in shot put with throws of 11.42 meters and 11.03 meters. Fellow first-year Jocelyn Kiefel also had a strong showing, placing eighth in triple jump with a season-best jump of 10.66 meters.
Men’s Basketball
Though the men’s basketball team was looking to end the season on a high note following a four-game losing streak, they ended up falling to Case Western Reserve 92-83. Though the Tartans led 45-35 at the half, the Spartans scored 57 over Carnegie Mellon’s 38 in the second half. With this final loss, the men’s basketball team ended the season with a 11-13 record overall and went 4-10 in the UAA.
The Tartans finished the game with 42.3% of field goals made compared to the Spartans’s 46.3%, both teams taking around 70 total attempted field goals. Junior Nick Nakasian led the team with 23 points, marking his fourth game of the season scoring 20 or more points. Sophomore R.J. Holmes finished just behind him with 22 points, marking his seventh game scoring 20 or more points this season.
Women’s Basketball
The women’s basketball team finished the season with a winning record, secured by their 71-56 victory over Case Western. This put the Tartans at a final record of 12-11 and a 6-8 UAA record; the women’s basketball team will find out whether their season will continue when the Eastern College Athletic Conference makes announcements on Feb. 28.
Making up a large portion of the Tartan’s 71 total points were four players who all scored in the double digits: senior Leah Weslock with 13, first-year Catherine Or scoring 17, senior Caitlyn Clendenin recording a team-leading 17 points, and first-year Anisha Chintala finishing with 12 points. Though the game was pretty even with a Tartan lead of 36-31 at the end of the second quarter, the Tartans dominated the scoreboard in the second half, ultimately outscoring the Spartans 35-25.

New research at the Kuang Group may reveal keys to understanding the role of gut microbes in regulating mammalian circadian rhythms, a term that can apply to almost any physical, mental, or behavioral regulation linked to a 24-hour cycle. On Feb. 23, at the weekly Department of Biological Sciences Research Club meeting, first-year Ph.D. student Jason Nguyen presented the group’s current research. 
Dr. Kuang’s prior research claims that microorganisms residing within mouse intestines can impact the circadian rhythm of histone modification. Histones are a type of protein that provide structure for chromosomes. An example of histone modification is histone methylation, in which methyl groups are added to the histone protein for DNA to wrap around. Adding methyl groups to the histone protein alters the interaction between the protein and DNA and, in some cases, even the expression of the associated genes.
The current research at the Kuang Lab seeks to answer several questions: how do microbial regulations affect circadian rhythms (within intestinal epithelial cells) through histone modifications? Is there a difference in microbial activity between male and female mice? Are there any driving factors for this regulation process?
The mouse intestinal microbiota use a histone modifier known as histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) to induce daily metabolic rhythms and control lipid uptake. These metabolic rhythms include a systematic recruitment of histone modifiers, post-translational (after proteins are synthesized from RNA) modifiers that regulate protein function. 
The Kuang lab used three experimental groups for their research: a control group of male mice, a control group of female mice, and a group of male mice that were given a special antibiotic. In addition, one of the first steps of their analysis was ChIP-sequencing of H3k4me3, a marker of histone methylation. This was pivotal to identifying H3k4me3 as a modification found in the regulatory regions of genes that are associated with gut-localized circadian rhythms.
Then, using a gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, the researchers at the Kuang Lab identified a heightened expression of KDM-associated genes within the antibiotic-treated mice compared to the control groups. KDMs are lysines, amino acids that regulate histone methylation by specifically targeting modifiers like HDAC3. 
So far the main conclusions are that circadian rhythms of histone methylations in intestinal epithelial cells depend on the microbiota, and that the daily oscillations of intestinal histone methylations are present in male mice but not in female mice. In addition, significant changes in KDM5 expression were detected, but future work is needed to examine the circadian activities of these KDMs. 
Further experiments Nguyen suggested include using RNA-sequencing to identify highly expressed genes related to HDAC3 modifications, using a KDM knockout to witness the subsequent effect on circadian rhythms, or using Western Blot to confirm gene expression results.

Steam Deck released Feb. 28
On Feb. 28, the first wave of Steam Decks will arrive in customers' hands. The Steam Deck is Valve’s answer to those asking for a portable PC gaming console. While there are currently over 60,000 games on Steam, Valve’s PC game distribution service, not all of them are completely compatible with the Deck. In a user’s library on the Steam Deck, they will see two categories: “Great on Deck” and “All Games.” Valve has also created a website showing users which games will work well on the Deck. Notable games that can be played on the Deck include “Stardew Valley,” “Hades,” and “Terraria.”
Users can purchase a Steam Deck from Steam’s website. Potential buyers can choose one of three options, most notably with different storage sizes ranging from 64 gigabytes to 512 gigabytes. The smallest storage option is Embedded MultiMediaCard while the two larger options are solid-state drive (SSD), so those who are interested in better specs will probably want to go with either one of the SSD options. The website lists the order availability of the Deck to be following Q2 2022. 
The review embargo on the Deck was lifted on Feb. 25 to mostly positive reviews. Many reviewers note that it fulfills its job as a portable PC gaming system. Similar to the Nintendo Switch, the Steam Deck can be played in both handheld and docked mode. Others note that there are still bugs with the Deck and at times the battery life is lacking. At the same time, they also note that it’s a solid system that offers users many options since it doubles as a full Linux PC, meaning users can also play other games not necessarily offered on the Steam Deck. 
February 27 ‘Pokemon Presents’ Summary
On Feb. 27 (also known as “Pokémon Day” due to the release of “Pokémon Red” and “Pokémon Green” in Japan 26 years ago), a “Pokémon Presents” presentation revealed the Gen IX entries in the mainline series: “Pokémon Scarlet” and “Pokémon Violet.” In a shift from past announcements of mainline games, the starters were revealed in the announcement trailer: Sprigatito, a grass-type cat; Fuecoco, a fire-type crocodile; and Quaxly, a water-type duck. The end of the trailer announced a late 2022 worldwide release date. Notably, it appears that the new entries will also be open-world like “Pokémon Legends: Arceus.”
In other “Pokémon”-related news, “Pokémon Legends: Arceus” received its version 1.1.0 update, which includes new trainer battles and “Massive Mass Outbreaks,” both expanding upon already existing features in the game. “Pokémon Legends: Arceus” is also receiving an anime adaption that is based on the setting of the game, the Hisui region. 
‘Elden Ring' releases
On Feb. 25, FromSoftware released its latest development with publisher Bandai Namco Entertainment, “Elden Ring.” The game, first announced at E3 in 2019, quickly received critical acclaim following its release, with its PlayStation 5 release reaching a 97 and receiving the title of a “Must Play” from review aggregator Metacritic. “Elden Ring” incorporates elements of FromSoftware’s previous games, like the “Souls'' series, “Bloodborne,” and “Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,” with influences from “Shadow of the Colossus” and “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.” Within minutes of its release, “Elden Ring” had over 700,000 concurrent players on Steam, smashing FromSoftware’s previous highest concurrent player count of 130,000 players held by “Dark Souls 3.”
One of the notable aspects of “Elden Ring” is George R.R. Martin’s involvement with the story. Martin wrote the series “A Song of Ice and Fire,” which was later adapted into “Game of Thrones.” According to “Elden Ring” director Hidetaka Miyazaki, Martin helped contribute to the history of the game's world, not the actual plot.

When an event on a global scale occurs, its effects can be felt everywhere and in every sector, including science and technology. This week's SciTech Roundup features stories around the current war in Ukraine.
U.S., Canada, European nations are expelling Russian banks from SWIFT; could slow down Russian economy significantly
The White House, Canada, the European Commission, as well as several other European countries have announced that they will be expelling Russian banks from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) Banking system. SWIFT is a cooperative that facilitates trillions of dollars of transactions between more than 200 countries. Though Russia has an alternative network, the System for Transfer of Financial Messages, it is limited in its capabilities. Cryptocurrencies do not require a bank and could potentially help, but are not as commonly used as Russian banks, and would likely also not be able to replace SWIFT. As such, without SWIFT, many Russian corporations and other entities would have to manually confirm financial transactions, significantly slowing down the economy.
Nations are anticipating possible problems that could arise with expelling Russia from SWIFT. Russia has a large economy, and slowing it down could have spillover effects on other nations. Because of this, the restrictions on Russia in SWIFT are lighter than some countries have proposed. In addition, nations worry that by expelling Russian banks, Russia will turn to their alternatives, and even if they are not adequate replacements right now, having to use them will strengthen the systems.
These reasons have prevented nations in the past from expelling Russia, though in this case they are unable to turn a blind eye to Ukraine's plight. In the past, the only other nation that has been banned from SWIFT is Iran.
Social media and tech companies respond to the crisis
Social media and tech companies have been grappling with how to respond to crises: elections, the pandemic, the Black Lives Matter movement, and now, Russia invading Ukraine.
Ukrainians are taking to social media to show live updates of the crisis, sharing photos, videos, first-person accounts, and trying to show the scale and impact of the invasion. But as these messages circulate, misinformation and disinformation follows. Videos from years ago are posing as current takes, and propaganda abounds.
On Twitter, the verified account for Ukraine posted: "hey people, let's demand @Twitter to remove @Russia from here ... they should not be allowed to use these platforms to promote their image while brutally killing the Ukrainian people @TwitterSupport." Twitter has not responded. The head of Ukraine Ministry of Digital Transformation has also requested on Twitter for Apple to cut off Russia from its services. 
Twitter is stopping advertisements in Ukraine and Russia. Google Europe said it was enhancing security controls for Ukranian users. Facebook/Meta is allowing Ukrainian users to lock their profiles, and has placed limitations on four Russian media accounts. The companies are also adding features to flag misinformation or potentially sensitive content and curating resources of verifiable information.
Russia is also responding to the actions of social media companies. After Facebook placed limitations on Russian media accounts, it announced on Feb. 25 that it would be "restricting access" to Facebook, though the extent and nature of these restrictions are currently unknown.
As cyberattacks escalate, archivists are trying to save Ukraine's web pages
Cybersecurity firm ESET claims that a data-wiping program was installed on hundreds of machines in Ukraine, including a government website and a financial institution, in an attack that had likely been in the works for a while. 
Experts studying the data-wiping malware found that in order for the cyberattacks to work, the malware creator needs to already have admin access to the computers in the network. This means that the computers had already been compromised long before the attack. The attack's primary function was likely to incite panic.
Ukraine claims that it is part of a wave of Russian cyberattacks on the country. In recent weeks, the government has been reporting distributed denial of service attacks on banks, phishing attacks on public authorities, and the spread of malicious software.
In addition, notorious ransomware gang Conti announced its support of Russia. It said that it would respond to a cyberattack on Russia with "all [its] possible resources to strike back at the critical infrastructures." It should be noted, however, that Conti has made similar bold claims in the past.
It's also worth noting that countries are also incentivized to destroy documents during times of war in order to evade being prosecuted for war crimes, which adds to the urgent need to preserve Ukraine's webpages. Archivists have been selectively web crawling Ukraine media and government websites as Ukraine experiences political upheaval.

We love Poetry (with a capital P) here at PILLBOX. We love it so much that we dedicated our issue to it! This issue showcases poetry from writers across CMU's many schools, with widely varied subject matter and style. Additionally, there's plenty of reflections on the art of poetry itself, from this week's Intersection Essay - where columnist Disyaski Krishnan reflects on Rilke, crisis, and more - to Tessa Weinland's humorous and astute explanation of "How to be a Poet". 
Our examination of "poetry" extends beyond the basic definitions of the form. Heralding from the Mellon College of Science, Anna Cappella – also known as the Zoomer Shel Silverstein – steps in with a Poetic Edda on Beach House, with a formatting so unique and artistic that our code monkeys will tear their hair out trying to put it onto our vintage 2004 website. Bear witness to a powerful cultural critique written by one of PILLBOX’s most prolific writers! Issue #1 contributor Emma Pollet returns with her moving personal essay, "Something to Remember me by". 
Last but not least, this issue is filled with the phenomenal artworks of CMU's wildly talented artist Soomin Kong. Soomin contributed several pieces to this issue, pieces featured both as accompaniments to poetry and articles as well as an artist feature from pages 16-18. And of course, it is Soomin's work that shines brilliantly on this week's cover. 
Many thanks to all our contributors for sharing their talent and intellect with us for this special issue. And thank you for reading - we can't wait to come back after spring break with even more art, writing, and culture for your eyes and ears.

I want to say Beach House is like an enigma. It’s like 
who else makes music like them? 
it’s not alt, it’s not indie, and it’s compelling enough to not be shoegaze, but then I always come back to the 
eternal issue.                       do all of their songs sound the same? 
to the untrained ear, probably. 
to the trained ear, maybe still, though 
it’s possible that what the people call monotony is really just stylistic consistency or the fact that every single song is the one 
you cried to last week after you realized 
your life was going nowhere. 
at the very least, Beach House’s style is utterly gorgeous and deeply emotional almost all of the time. you love to love to love them in small increments, but personally I hated to love their new album Once Twice Melody. 
    maybe I just wasn’t ready to move on 
from Depression Cherry, their near-perfect 2015 album from which everybody knows “Space Song,” a piece that physically sticks its hand into your chest and 
methodically rips your heart into 
seventy 
thousand 
pieces. naturally, I went into Once Twice Melody ready to be disappointed. Beach House has released 3 albums since Depression Cherry, and the fact that I am still hung up on it speaks volumes about the content of those three albums. 
    regardless, what I found in Once Twice Melody was the voice of a band that, after almost 16 years releasing music, has come into their own. the sound is mature and intricately designed. they’ve even seemed to lean into their stoner music persona 
at last. 
the word faded is slipped awkwardly into a few tracks in the same way that Taylor Swift decided she was
finally old enough to start swearing on folklore.
what excited me most upon first glance was the division of the album into 4 EP-length discs. I couldn’t help but think of the “chapters” created by Taylor Swift
                (can you tell i like her?)
from her albums evermore, folklore, Red (Taylor’s Version), and Fearless (Taylor’s Version). I hoped that there would be some connections between songs within the discs, making the disc idea an incredible design choice. 
what I found was a little bit
    awkward 
    at least lyrically. there’s a lot of good chordality and beat and even some wedding-style musical themes, like the one on “ESP” that I really 
really
loved.
the introduction to “Pink Funeral” for example - 
thematic, large,
    invoking something strange and difficult - is immediately trampled by the bland,
meaningless lyricism that failed to distinguish the discs in any poetic way. Not that I 
expected anything more -
Beach House is known for their sound more than anything. but part of me
hoped I would get more out of Once Twice Melody
than a couple of cross-references to flowers
    (see “Through Me”, “Over and Over”, and “Sunset”)
.
    what did I want? what more could I have asked for from this band that makes songs with sounds that nobody else could?
        I wanted what I could only make for myself because the thing about Beach House is that
    their music is a platform for you to write your own story, to take 
    the lines that describe the sky and the grass 
in so many metaphors that they lose their depth and make them
    about the girl with the red hair you saw in line at the store 
or god.
    whatever you choose. I think that Once Twice Melody does a good job of this some of the time and
some of the time the 
half-written
sound poems they call 
lyrics
interrupt the angelic,
evangelical sounds
Beach House calls music. 
    honest mistake,
        to try and strengthen your weakest points. 
my wish for you is to find the story in the discs that I missed, to find your own meaning in the metaphor on this album because
    you deserve that. Beach House and their lovely

This Flickering World: Rilke and the Universality of Crisis Response 
"The Wartime Letters of Rainer Maria Rilke" is a small, unassuming little book, seagreen and worn with pages just the right shade of yellow. I bought it at a secondhand bookstore in Boston’s financial district, a stone’s throw away from the Devonshire. I liked the idea of owning the book, its origin story, the class of reading Rilke. I didn’t intend to enjoy it. 
But let me go back a little, explain. It was the summer before my freshman year of college, the heart of the pandemic. It occupied us like an army. Endlessly, we were attempting to escape. So one July morning my friend and I took the commuter rail to North Station, intending to live out our erudite trust-fund-without-the-trust-or-fund city girl dream. Rilke, apparently, was our natural conclusion. 
I knew little of Rilke, but what I did know were luxury and love poems, elite musings, European grace. Even the title — "Wartime" — did not clue me in that this particular collection might be different. Darker. More difficult. I clocked its writing period: 1914 to 1921, only a few years before his death in 1926 at 51. I expected to read the letters of a celebrity poet, aging, serious, well-settled into his reputation and way of life. My complete and entire opposite. Instead. 
The most accurate way I can think to describe Rilke’s letters is as those of a teenager, but this sounds cruel. He writes with all the eloquence of a man of his stature and experience, but with the emotion of a teenager. Rilke is wracked with uncertainty. Every other letter is an apology to someone for not sending in a promised selection of writing. “I would have written to you,” he tells writer and publisher Ludwig von Ficker, “did not the weight of the time lie upon the slightest communication and expression, so that I cannot write a word without disproportionate effort.” He begs off a meeting with Frau Hanna Wolff: 
“The uncertainty out there, this flickering world in which one can place no object, no word even, without its casting such unquiet shadows, most unconditionally obliges me to draw myself in… Who would have thought… that for so many months the anomaly then beginning would still be unresolved over us and right. Right for how long—and so much that is wrong!” 
The anomaly Rilke refers to, of course, is World War I. But the parallels to our own time, a time of illness, of perennial fear, were so strong I almost believed the letter had been written only months before. 
You must understand: Rilke wrote as a popular and beloved Austrian poet in the advent of WWI. These letters chronicle a seven-year period of perpetual nomadism, a poet hunted and haunted by himself. The fleeting nature of his sentiments, the bouts of deep despair followed by moments of pervasive love and wonder, seemed to me uncharacteristic of his age. He wrote so cleanly, and yet nothing about his emotions were clean. 
As the pandemic went on, I found myself going to books more and more to make sense of the unceasing grief and exhaustion. After Rilke, I read Sylvia Plath’s Journals and The Bell Jar, poignant and gripping depictions of depression that so mirrored my own experiences I had to stop reading for several weeks to allow myself to recover. I read C.S Lewis’ "A Grief Observed," written after his wife’s death: “No one told me that grief felt so much like fear.” Then, a few weeks after her death, I read Joan Didion’s A Year of Magical Thinking, a treatise on grief from one of the most aloof and exacting writers in American history in the wake of her husband’s death at their own dinner table. The book chronicles Didion’s descent into “magical thinking”, a pattern of illogical cognition, completely unsupported by fact or research, where she believes in her husband’s eventual return and in certain odd rituals to keep her sorrow at bay. “I was thinking as small children think,” she explains. 
Didion’s admission, Lewis’ plaintive tone, Plath’s sorrow of youth, and Rilke’s uncertainty all harken back to one thing: Crisis makes children of us all. How the body recedes into fetal position when it is threatened or hurt, so too does the mind — back to childhood, when such intensity of emotion was allowed, such ignorance of the world expected. Whatever barriers of order and control we put up as adults or adults-to-be shatter in the face of crisis. We flounder. We lose our way. It does not matter how old we are, how wealthy or established, how sure in our positions. We are each of us eroded by crisis. Returned to our original elements. 
To read Rilke and Lewis and Plath and Didion is to understand the universality of this reaction, this humanity of it. It is as James Baldwin wrote: “You think your pain and heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world, but then you read.” Time and time again, humans are subjected to crisis. Time and time again, they respond—and though the centuries turn, the response is always the same. The core of us remains.

Every love poem I write is really a poem about soup. I wake up and think about how I love you and something in me hungers for soup—the long stretch of stewing, which is really the realization of the hope that all we have to do is wait to get everything we want. All you have to do is be patient, for an hour, maybe two, and there will be soup. Isn’t that a miracle? Sometimes when I make soup I simmer it for so long the entire house starts simmering, too, hours of swimming in a scent, swanning sweetly around in the embrace of something that smells just right, something you have been long anticipating, which makes it taste even better. I made this soup with mushrooms and bok choy, carrots and tofu, and an arsenal of sauce and spice—rice wine and soy, dashi and sugar. Making soup is a straight shot to home, a way to pretend I know everything about my culture and will never forget a recipe, which is also a form of love, the hardest kind. I make so much soup I cannot possibly finish it by myself, so I don’t. I feed you, and her, and him, too. That’s love. I make so much soup that I get sick of it and promise to never make it again, good god, but of course I will. That’s love, too. I think I will probably spend the rest of my life learning how to make soup better, to understand the chemistry of cooking, the way taste can bring you home, can put you at ease. They say taste and smell are the oldest senses, the ones that kept us alive, the most limbic, the most primeval. I am coming home to my oldest, truest self when I make soup. I make a place that you can come home to, too, when I make soup. The day is long and cold and gray but inside there is a warm bowl of soup on our wooden table. And maybe that’s enough.

prologue
When my grandmother went to Egypt, the third time, she brought me back a tiny golden camel statue. If you open the hump on its back, you won’t find water, but air. A place to place a diamond or two. A ring, a ten cent Euro. Or, in my case, a tiny scrap of paper from a notepad with an owl motif. 
That paper was blank when I first put it in there, as is my memory when I try to recall that date. But I put it on a shelf high above my head, allowing the camel to watch me grow. Allowing it to observe the passage of time. Now, I know what you’re thinking. Being the only child in the house made me lonely, but never that lonely. I mean, I never personified the gift, assigning it the role of a sentinel. But I did give it an even greater responsibility, which was keeping my own growth a secret from my future self.
“You keep what in the souvenir I brought to you from Egypt?” my grandmother would absolutely say if I ever told her about the tendency I have—you know, the one that involves periodically opening the camel’s back, removing the scrap of paper, signing it with a sentence of encouragement and the date on the calendar, and putting it back in its hideaway, after it is perfectly folded, of course? That one?  
I don’t know why it started, but I do know the most recent time, not the last time, I climbed up on my bed frame to retrieve it. Today. I wrote on that paper today. Just as I have been writing on it since circa 2015. 
This tendency is weird, and I will not be surprised if I go my whole life without finding anyone else who does anything like this. I feel as if I am trying to describe a concept so familiar, yet because the context exists only on the pinpoint of my identity, it feels impossible to articulate. But I want myself to remember who I am. More importantly, I want myself to remember who I was. Where I’ve been, what I’ve been through. The mundane. The altering. And if anyone decides to dust that shelf one day, or if anyone decides to get a closer look at that golden souvenir, then I suppose that they’ll get to remember, too. 
The truth is, I’ve gone merely twenty years existing on the same plane of other human beings who also have the ability to remember who I am, and each interaction I have had could fill a million souvenir camels, and then some. 
2/11/2017
I dropped a quote from “The Devil Wears Prada” in a class discussion today. My English teacher was the only one who recognized it. 
10/08/2018 
I played my “My Heart Will Go On” music box, which I bought for $8 in Chicago’s Chinatown, for the girl I drive home from school. She seemed a little uncomfortable.  
1/21/2020
My friends just huddled around me in our design studio, trying to decipher the agricultural symbols on my turtleneck. Should I tell them that I only bought it at Goodwill because I thought it was a Christmas sweater?
How many of these moments do you want to remember? Seriously, I’m asking. How many trees have you carved your initials into, just to prove you’ve stood under its branches? How many times have you taken a polaroid and written the date in the blank space below? Or, better yet, jumped in the background of a random group’s picture, just to include yourself in their memory of their good friend’s birthday dinner? It’s all wet cement, these moments in time, and these actions are our handprints that we just have to press into the ground before it dries. And that camel of mine is no different. 
something to remember me by
When I evacuate this place for the last time, not the first. When I follow the road signs, the blue circular metal, that help me seek higher ground—a ground so high, I’ll never have to come back down again. Traveling inward. Running like the wind and the water to somewhere high and dry. Not a roof, not a mountaintop. Some place higher, but not too high so I can still see the flood make a river out of a road. That fervor is something I’ll have to see. 
And after it’s all over, no matter how little water is still pooled in the potholes of the pavement, I won’t be coming back again. I probably won’t even continue to stare. Instead, I’ll wonder. Will you stand on my doorstep? Will you spray paint an X on my wall? 
What will you look for? What will you find?
When I evaporate with the water, when I blow in the breeze with the birdsong, I’ll visit your windowsill with the warmth of the Sun. I’ll tap dance on your tin roof, then sit on the horizon line to give my legs a break. Perhaps on that bench, the one the lake and sky made for me in a mindless collaboration, I’ll open a book or five, and never finish any of them. They’ll just sit on my bedside table with pressed flowers for bookmarks, turning more into decorations with each passing day. 
Maybe that’s what you’ll find: those unfinished books of mine.
When I burn like paper in the heat of July, I’ll rise with the smoke and billow in the sky. I’ll hang there for a while, until your chimney smoke meets me on a night in November. I’ll lay on my back, gazing at the atmosphere as an outstretched cloud, until the sunset uses my back as a canvas. I hope you’ll step outside and watch as I turn pink and blue. The most beautiful artifact hovering above your eyes. And I pray you find it: the miraculous halo of a cotton candy sky.
When I dissolve like spun sugar that lands on your tongue, I’ll stay and listen for the laughter in your tears. I’ll listen for words I’ve never heard before, and if my curiosity piques, maybe I’ll begin to use them, too. I’ll fill my senses with your sentences about tonight’s lasagna and tomorrow’s worries, and I’ll look at the world through the gaps in your teeth, and it’ll still be as beautiful as it was from above. It’ll be just as confusing and dangerous and maddening and bare. 
But it won’t be silent.
So when these words dance on your lips as you read them to yourself, your voice will fill the world. And I’ll float out with each consonant and comma, drifting to my highest point—my final point—feeling perfectly content that I was able to leave you with something to remember me by.

Look! Look what I can do, in love! 
I can make you mythical - 
I can liken you to the old gods,
Sew you into their stories with songs and scriptures of my own.
I can taste the name “Persephone” and spit its meaning to the side – Bringer of Death leaves a bad taste in my mouth – 
And press it into the floor, the cigarette I said I’d quit. 
When I think of you, I taste pomegranates.
Yes, I know what that implies, but they are fresh and enticing  And not at all foreboding when I’m the one writing.
I’d prefer not to write myself in - just you, just you for now.
Your glory, your honor,
Your voice as big as the thunder, your hands as broad as the rain. You fill every sound at once, you touch every inch of my body. You wash me in yellow light.
This is how it is, in actuality: my love is the sun, and I am Icarus. That is my eternal paradox, and that is how it has gone every time so far. Candles in the wind and flash-bangs in the dark, 
Half empty and more than half empty glasses that I drank without asking first. I have always been too trusting, too fond of gliding on the silk whisper of new faith. 
By now, I would have launched twenty-thousand ships
and sent as many men to their deaths.
All for my heart, all for naught. No lessons learned; an idealist to the end. 
Perhaps I’ll write us our own myth,
“The Time Cassandra Ignored Her Own Prophecy.” 
Call me Pessimist, or call me Oracle.
I have not been wrong yet.

SUNDAY MORNING
Bright blue sky then how. Then why.
Hedonistic thrill pales in the harsh light of families on their way to church.
A childhood trip to Manhattan, holding my father’s hand, the people looking painfully alive, as if
the essence of being shone from every pore.
Am I one of them? Am I one of them? Am I? I am
holding a hand and if you cut me open I’ll bleed ice blue.
Scraping cold butter off the block naked in the kitchen.
How wonderful, to have bread and butter and salt. What a blessing this is.
And oh, how the radiator clanks and groans like a dying man. What a gift.
How grateful am I? I speak only to myself. Watch how grateful I can be. Are you watching?
He tells me “you are a child playing in a world far larger than yourself.”
I tell him I am a coiled spring. Make me bounce.
Choose to love the rain, love the sludge, love the skinny fox next to the tracks, love the wind,
even when a wine glass blows over spills red all across the tablecloth and he’s pouring me
another drink, drawing me another line, calling me another time.
Give me everything now but shake it up and put it in a whiskey sour.
Isn’t it funny how they give you both lemon and milk for your tea, as if to say,
“Don’t ask for too much. It curdles.”

HOW TO BE A POET  
Being sad is the key to being a good writer. 
Just kidding! Artists don’t need to be depressed. That’s a toxic myth, and my take isn’t fresh. Most people know that nowadays. 
But it definitely helps. There’s a lot of content when you’re sad. The daily bruising, the apathy, and the bone-poking-through-skin honest to God pain makes for a wealth of content. It’s easy to write when the writing feels furious. It pours out of you like shit or vomit. Piss and vinegar. In the act of writing it down you feel like you’re purging some of the bullshit from your head. Usually it just leads to a one person echo chamber circle jerk of grotesque thoughts, but I’m getting ahead of myself. The point is, it’s easy to feel like writing when you are depressed, because it feels like every single day is tailor made by a higher power to be really fucking shitty for you specifically. This either leads to the “my pain is special and therefore needs to be acknowledged by society” route, or the less fun “my pain is universal and therefore relatable because existence is meaningless” one. So it’s pretty easy to write something down. 
In dark moments I turn to the oft cited, possibly misattributed, “Credo” by good old Jack (Kerouac): “Remember above all things, Kid, that to write is not difficult, not painful… Remember, Kid, the ease, the grace, the glory, the greatness of your art; remember it, never forget.” 
Maybe being happy is the key to being a good writer. Not that I suggest turning to Kerouac for inspiration on being happy. For a long time, I thought I did my best writing when I was really depressed. Then, after some intensive therapy (and two months away from my conservatory education, which on occasion is known to rot parts of your brain), I was kind of… better. Not entirely, and not forever, but for a while, I just felt better. Days stopped feeling like a shit parade of apathy, and I got a little better at taking care of my basic hygiene and sleep schedule. I stopped sitting down in the shower. I stopped feeling like a talking doll with dying batteries set to manic mode. Writing felt less like a voiding of the bile in my head and more like an act of creation, bringing something into existence that hadn’t been there before. Sometimes I struggled to match my old writing pace, but the work was so coherent. It was still all about me, of course, because twenty year olds are narcissists. But writing felt so honest, so freeing, that it fit into my happy little world. 
The question is, how can you write when you are neither happy nor sad, simply present to the circumstances of your life, flossing regularly, consuming less alcohol, and you are just so sick of writing about yourself? 
Writing about yourself when you’re depressed is easy because you are special. Writing about yourself when you are happy is easy because you’re so evolved, so unique, you’ve figured out the secret to life and you have something to say about it! But I’ve started to see the circumstances of my life as they are: sometimes good, sometimes bad, generally excellent compared to most of the world. And serializing it all just doesn’t seem so interesting anymore. Maybe everything I’ve written in defense of navel gazing is wrong. We need to stop exalting ourselves and bringing ourselves so low. Real life happens in the middle, I guess. I should quit before I keep sounding like a Yogi tea bag. 
I can always just fall in love again. Then none of this will matter.

At 4 p.m. last Sunday, second-year student Ben Martinez decided he would take a shower. Donner House had other plans for him. “The water was ice cold,” said Martinez, who is a resident advisor (RA) on 2 West. Martinez wanted a shower, and he didn’t want it cold. He went to the 1 West showers, tried the basement bathroom, and doubled back to 2 West half an hour later. In each instance, “same deal. No hot water.”  
Don Coffelt, Associate Vice President for Facilities Management and Campus Services, addressed the issue in an email exchange with The Tartan. He said that his team has “been tracking a persistent, but intermittent, domestic hot water issue in Donner.” After two reports were filed earlier this month, “the root cause was traced to the primary hot water heat exchanger (the device that converts steam heat to hot water), and we switched Donner to its secondary (i.e., backup/redundant) domestic hot water system … The secondary system cannot produce as much hot water … so there may have been isolated reports of hot water shortages between the 10th and today.” 
Primary system repairs were planned for Feb. 25, according to Coffelt. Martinez reported that no Donner bathrooms had hot shower water on Feb. 26.
Donner residential education (ResEd) staff have begun a list of facilities complaints in the last few months. Martinez estimated that, over the past month, the rate of cold showers is “once a week on one floor for the past month.” Water temperatures were nothing, though, in comparison to “the other stuff.” When asked to elaborate, Martinez’s initial response was: “Oh boy.”
Coffelt told The Tartan that his department addresses 70,000 university-wide complaints annually. 
“The stairs out front [of Donner] were nice and crumbly for a bit because of all the ice and snow,” he recalled in an interview with The Tartan. Facilities management has since solved the problem, but for a week Martinez observed that there was “definitely a hazard.” 
Then there is the flooding, an internal natural disaster for which Donner is notorious. “The water’s seeping out of the showers onto the floor,” Martinez said. Part of the problem, he explained, is that people do not properly put the shower curtains within the stalls. But he also pointed out that the floor is not graded correctly, causing water to pool in the bathroom and snake outside of it. It does not take a facilities expert, according to Martinez, to see that “things shouldn’t be flooding as much as they are.”
“My residents have told me it’s difficult for them to make a request,” said Martinez, citing numerous loopholes they have to jump through to get to the right form. “It’s a complicated process to get to ‘Donner bathroom’ instead of ‘my room.’”
ResEd staff frequently file complaints and flag facilities problems, but responses are often delayed. Martinez acknowledged that there is only so much custodial staff can do. “Custodians can’t do much other than clean up the mess,” he said, but they are not able to address the structural shortcomings of the building. “The bathrooms would need to be retiled and regraded,” Martinez assessed. These are changes that cannot be made with a quick call to maintenance. 
Access to clean water is also limited. The water bottle refill station has gone a month without a filter replacement. “Water filters being down for extended periods of time is not safe,” said Martinez.
In an explanation sent to The Tartan, Coffelt wrote: “Bottle filling stations … [have] filters that are changed as needed.  The water from fountains without bottle filling stations is not filtered,” but are frequently tested to ensure the water meets safety standards.
Other facilities complaints include a year-long accretion of mold on the handicap shower bench and unpredictable heating and air conditioning from room to room. Many Donner RAs have been questioning the validity of a floor plan they found online. Their residents have observed heating and cooling patterns inconsistent with the controls outlined on the map. “One room controls heat for the two next to it,” Martinez explained. “But one could be scalding, the other ice cold.”
Donner RAs are curious about maintenance’s delayed reaction to facilities issues. Martinez specifically addressed accountability. “That's kind of — respectfully — their job; to make sure the space is liveable.”

On Monday evening, psychology professor Anna Fisher logged out of Zoom and broke down. The invasion of her birth country by the country that raised her was devastating enough. But the straw that broke the camel’s back was an event hosted by Carnegie Mellon’s Institute for Politics and Strategy (IPS): “On the Brink: A Panel Discussion on Russia and Ukraine.” 
“The forum that included ‘Ukraine’ in its name did not include a panelist with expertise in Ukraine,” said Fisher in an interview with The Tartan. She was deeply upset by the lack of representation of a country that was ostensibly the central focus of the event. 
Fisher, who is an associate professor of Psychology at Carnegie Mellon, was born in Ukraine and raised in Russia. Since war began between the two countries on Thursday, Feb. 24, she has been searching for spaces in which she can find solidarity. 
The panel was scheduled for 5 p.m. but began eight minutes late due to unexpectedly high turn-out. At 5:48 p.m., Fisher submitted a message to Q&A, which could only be seen by hosts. In screenshots provided to The Tartan, Fisher commented: “So far the Ukrainian perspective is sorely missing from the panel.” No response. At 6:04 p.m., she tried again: “HOW can we have this forum on Ukraine and Russia with ONLY the Russian perspective represented in the panel?” No response.
At 6:07 p.m., Fisher asked: “Can the first speaker address why Crimea being gifted to Ukraine in the 1950s is relevant, but it is not relevant to mention that in 1994 Ukraine gave up nuclear weapons in exchange [for] guarantees signed by Russia, the U.S., and the U.K. to respect the integrity of its border including Crimea?” Again, no response. 
“We each had a very brief time to speak, which made it impossible to answer all the excellent questions that had been placed in the chat,” explained Paul Mellon Distinguished Professor of History Wendy Goldman, who presented her expertise as a Russian historian at Monday’s panel. Goldman told The Tartan that while planning the event, she and her colleagues decided to speak about their own specialties, to provide students with “a scholarly point of view.”
Professor Andreea Ritivoi, who is the head of the English Department, moderated Monday’s event. “The panel was originally planned well in advance of the current situation in the Ukraine,” Ritivoi wrote in an email to The Tartan. “We originally considered drawing upon the expertise of the Institute for Politics and Strategy’s Military Fellows but given sensitivities surrounding active-duty members of the military commenting on an active conflict, this option did not move forward.”
This narrowed the scope of possible perspectives, given the niche nature of the war. For Global Studies Director Emanuela Grama, an expert of 20th century Central and Eastern European history, that meant speaking about an especially specific subject: Romania. In an email to the event’s organizers, Grama wrote: “I will defer to the expertise of other scholars on the panel regarding the Ukrainian-Russian relations, but I'd be glad to share my knowledge about how the current crisis has been viewed and reported on in the neighboring countries — and more specifically, Romania.”
During his portion of the panel, Assistant Teaching Professor of Russian Studies David Parker debunked Russian President Vladimir Putin’s claims of denazification as a basis for invasion. In an email to The Tartan, he outlined his presentation, which provided “background on the abuse of the ‘neo-nazi’ label and Putin's leveraging of this history as [baseless] motivation for the execution of this horrible war.” 
The fourth panelist, IPS Assistant Professor Daniel Silverman, could not be reached for comment.
While Fisher did not blame the panelists and values academic freedom, she wishes the university had included an expert on Ukraine. Fisher personally disagreed with many of the points made during the event. Yet, after growing up in Russia, a country with a history of strict media censorship, she appreciates the academic freedom intrinsic to American higher education. 
In an email to The Tartan, Grama acknowledged a mistake she made while presenting. “When I briefly mentioned the missiles NATO moved from Turkey to Romania, I said ‘nuclear missiles.’ That is not accurate — the slide of my presentation did mention ballistic missiles on Romania's territory, but I did not say that, and that was a significant mistake,” she wrote. “There are no nuclear missiles on Romania's territory.”
Another source of disconnect from the panel stemmed from its focus on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) exacerbation of tensions between Ukraine and Russia. But Ukraine, as a sovereign state, can have aspirations to join alliances of its own choosing. 
Grama expressed her hope that the informational shortcomings would be addressed if the panel’s recording was made public to the Carnegie Mellon community.
When a student mentioned to Fisher that another professor was hosting a small event on the evening of Feb. 24, Fisher was eager to join. “I wanted to be with other people who cared,” she explained. 
Fisher gathered around the computer screen with her husband and two daughters that night. They watched, listened, and felt the loneliness slip away for an hour and a half as Professor Emanuela Grama led an emergency teach-in. 
Immediately after learning that Russian forces had attacked Ukraine, Grama began pulling a presentation together. In an interview with The Tartan prior to the IPS panel, Grama explained that she wanted to introduce her students to the context of the conflict and provide a space for questions.
For Fisher, this was a welcome reprieve from the mayhem of the past few hours. After the session, she sent a thank-you to Grama and drafted an email to her students. Fisher hoped “to host a forum — not for teaching,” she explained, but rather as a space for “people who just want to be together and grieve.” 
Fisher’s informal forum was planned for March 2, but after watching Monday’s panel, she understood that a shift in tone was necessary. In addition to creating a discussion-based space, Fisher unpacked the elements of the previous night’s panel that she found most problematic. “We have many people who left this forum with a lopsided understanding of this crisis,” she explained, necessitating a direct response by university leadership. Fisher emphasized that to support Ukraine, the Carnegie Mellon community must first recognize its legitimacy. 
Ritivoi told The Tartan about plans for a “a second panel discussion to continue the conversation about … the crisis in Ukraine. This will include experts on Ukraine’s history, politics, and culture.”
“I think that the Dietrich College has the responsibility to take corrective action,” Fisher wrote in a follow-up email to The Tartan. “Whether or not another forum happens, I think every person who registered for Monday’s event should receive an email with an explanation for why the event was problematic (despite some excellent presentations) and links to resources that speak to [Ukrainian expertise].”

When news arrived on Thursday that Russia had invaded Ukraine, three Carnegie Mellon students sprang into action. 
Eric Cheng, a senior, took to social media to gather a group. His path intersected with Vladyslav Oleksenko, a junior who was mobilizing his friends. They were then referenced in an email sent to senior Julia Timmons, who had reached out to Russian history and language faculty for support. 
“As soon as the events happened, several different groups of people immediately thought something should be done,” Oleksenko said in an interview with The Tartan, Cheng, and Timmons. “And what better way than to paint The Fence?”
Cheng created a document to coordinate a schedule, supplies, and snacks. He shared the link on social media, alongside a Linktree by Oleksenko that details how Carnegie Mellon students can help Ukraine. 
“We ended up with a huge group, and that wouldn’t have been possible without each of our individual efforts,” Timmons said. More than 20 students gathered at 12 a.m. on Saturday to coat The Fence in blue and yellow, Ukraine’s national colors. The side facing Hunt reads: “NO TO WAR.” On the other side, the Ukrainian coat of arms is flanked by “Glory to Ukraine” in English and Ukrainian (Слава Україні) and “No to war” in Ukrainian (ні війні) and Russian (нет войне). 
Providing students with accessible, digestible information is central to the organizers’ mission. That means answering questions, sharing the Linktree, and introducing students to ways they can support Ukraine. “I’m going to make myself available at those tables [next to The Fence] for as long as it’s still painted,” Timmons asserted. 
The organizers appreciate The Fence’s highly-trafficked location on campus. They see their role in the coming days as docent-adjacents, preparing “to answer any questions students might have, especially when they come back on Monday,” Cheng explained. Even while painting, the organizers answered questions from passersby who did not know about the war. 
President Jahanian acknowledged the crisis in an email to Carnegie Mellon community members on Friday afternoon. He voiced his support for Ukrainians and those who are connected to the region. Jahanian condemned “these recent acts of unprovoked aggression by an authoritarian government, which are in direct contrast to basic human decency and the values of a peaceful society.” Neither Russia nor its president, Vladimir Putin, were directly referenced. 
Timmons appreciated the email. “Jahanian voicing his support is great because it goes into everyone’s inbox,” she said. This helps raise awareness on campus and presents a clear, albeit universal, stance on the situation. 
Oleksenko, who is an international student from Ukraine, felt that the email was an important first step in the university’s response. But as events continue to unfold, the need for relevant information is increasingly urgent. 
This is especially true, Cheng pointed out, because unlike the usual emails from the university’s President, this one addressed an ongoing crisis. “Most things that President Jahanian deems appropriate to send have already happened,” Cheng explained, citing last year’s insurrection as an example. “This situation is unique because it will persist for days or weeks. There is fighting happening in Ukraine right now. We haven’t seen the aftermath yet, which is why paying attention is so important.”
Finding credible sources can be difficult, though, especially with the language barrier. “What’s most useful is words from the mouths of people there on the ground, in their language,” said Timmons, who understands both Russian and Ukrainian. She has been following live streams on social media to better understand the war. 
“Americans report on facts,” Oleksenko observed. While this is an important foundation of reporting, he believes the only way to appreciate the depth of the conflict is through emotional appeal. “That’s what my Ukrainian friends and relatives are doing: trying to spread the … ‘these are real people’ details.” 
Beyond news and stories, the organizers think that opportunities to learn on campus are essential. Posters appeared last week advertising “On the Brink: A Panel Discussion on Russia and Ukraine,” planned for Feb. 28 at 5 p.m. Cheng saw one last week in Baker. Timmons saw one this weekend and thought: “It’s not on the brink anymore.”
Oleksenko hadn’t heard about the event until Timmons brought it up during the interview. “We should be trying to do a better job about sharing events,” he said. The organizers’ Linktree is an information hub that includes upcoming events on campus and in the Pittsburgh community. 
Americans, Timmons noticed, are primarily interested in supplying humanitarian aid. “While humanitarian efforts and donations are appreciated,” the group wrote in a follow-up email to The Tartan, Ukrainians “are pleading for monetary support for the army above other efforts.”
Oleksenko agreed. Ukrainians, he said, “are alone. Zelensky” — Ukraine’s president — “has asked so many nations to send physical help ... The rest of the world shouldn’t just be watching upon this horror and trying to help from a distance.”  He noted that the war is extremely tenuous; Ukraine was not a part of NATO and both the U.S. and Russia have nuclear capabilities. But that doesn’t mean that Americans have no stake in the war’s outcome. 
“Not all countries have the privilege to say their military doesn’t need funding,” Timmons said. She hopes that the international community will support Ukraine in the ways that it needs, not just in the ways that are easiest.
One slogan floating around social media has left a particularly large impact on Oleksenko and Timmons. It reads: “If the Russians stop fighting there will be no war; if the Ukrainians stop fighting there will be no Ukraine.”
While Timmons agreed wholeheartedly with the mantra, she pointed out a caveat: “Putin does not equal ‘Russian people.’ That makes my blood boil,” she said, referring to the conflation of Russian actions and the will of its people. “People [are] risking their lives protesting against Putin in Moscow, St. Petersburg, all over the place … It’s not the Russians; it’s Putin and his minions.”
In addition to Jahanian’s email and panel discussions, Carnegie Mellon demonstrated its support of Ukraine with blue and yellow lighting on the Pausch bridge. Cheng would like to see Hunt adopt the same practice. He would also appreciate a “centralized resource on campus that directs us to a donation site that extends beyond the boundaries of humanitarian aid.”

War in Ukraine began on Thursday, Feb. 24, when Russian President Vladimir Putin authorized attacks by land, air, and sea. At least 240 casualties have been reported as of Feb. 27. 
Militarily, Ukrainian resources fall grossly behind Russian capacity. Ukrainian troops are outnumbered three to one. The country’s air and naval forces are eight and six percent the size of Russia’s, respectively. But many Ukranians did not flinch. They are determined to defend “every inch of our land,” according to Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba.
“I think Ukraine’s response could not be better,” said Carnegie Mellon junior Vladyslav Oleksenko. “There is not a single drop of doubt or uncertainty. Everyone in Ukraine is standing together, fighting together.” 
The heroism demonstrated on Snake Island captured the spirit of Ukrainian resistance for Oleksenko. In response to Russian troops’ demands of surrender, the 13 Ukrainian soldiers on the island shot back: “Russian warship, go fuck yourself.” President Volodymyr Zelensky barred men aged 18-60 from leaving the country, preparing them for forced conscription. 
Emanuela Grama, an associate professor of history at Carnegie Mellon, organized a virtual teach-in the night of the invasion. Grama, who is also the director of the university’s Global Studies program, provided her students with a much-needed explainer about Russia’s sudden, full-scale attack on Ukraine. “In this moment,” she told the 35 participants, Russia is not “a government that is led through consensus. It is a highly authoritarian regime; Putin is really leading the conversation.” 
Thousands of Russian citizens took to the streets to protest the invasion. Putin responded with mass arrests; 1,745 protesters were detained as of Feb. 25. “I want to ask Ukrainians for forgiveness,” Moscow resident Tatyana Usmanova wrote in a Facebook post. “We didn't vote for those who unleashed the war.” 
Russian protesters who publicly condemned the war, Grama felt, “are extremely brave.” But in an interview with The Tartan, she also explained that “there is no such thing as free press or real, genuine political opposition in Russia.” When Alexi Navalny challenged Putin for the presidency, his bid — and the popularity garnered with it — was quashed by a near-fatal, state-sanctioned poisoning. He survived and was promptly arrested upon re-entry into Russia. “Putin stopped playing nice years ago,” Grama stated. “He’s now showing his true colors. He’s saying: ‘I gave you the illusion of freedom, but now the game is over.’”
The U.N. estimates 100,000 Ukrainians have fled. Preparations for Ukrainian refugees are being made in nearby North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) nations including Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, and the Czech Republic. Pandemic-related travel restrictions will be waived in many cases to expedite the migration process. Poland and Romania have granted Ukrainians entry even if they did not present a passport. 
Putin downplayed the violence for which he is responsible. On Feb. 24, he described the attack as “a special military operation ... to protect people who have been subjected to abuse and genocide by the Kyiv regime for eight years.” According to BBC News, this is a lie.
“There is no evidence of genocide in eastern Ukraine,” BBC’s Reality Check team affirmed. Putin’s claims refer to parts of Donetsk and Luhansk, Russian-backed separatist territories along Ukraine’s southeastern border. Putin has manipulated Eastern European media to falsely justify territorial advances.
Russian-backed separatist movements in Donetsk and Luhansk unfolded alongside the 2014 Crimea crisis. Ukraine granted the territories autonomous authority later in 2014, though officially the regions remained part of the country. “Russia granted citizenship to ethnic Russians in the regions,” Grama explained, which was a calculated political strategy. “Dual citizenship allows Putin to claim that these are Russian citizens that have to be protected from the Ukrainian government.” This planted the seeds for the current invasion. 
Russian forces began lining the Ukrainian border in Oct. 2021. By the end of the year, 100,000 troops had been assembled. With Western nations attentive to and critical of Russian mobilization, Putin demanded that NATO cease inclusionary expansion into eastern Europe and remove troops from the region. The demands, made in mid-December, were not met.
Current tensions can be traced back to the Euromaidan demonstrations in 2013. Then-Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych backed down from free trade discussions with the European Union, citing Russian disapproval. In February 2014, Yanukovych was ousted by pro-democracy protesters. “More than a hundred people died on the streets during the Revolution of Dignity,” Grama said. But the movement was effective. Ukraine’s new government strengthened its ties with the E.U. and shifted away from its heavy reliance on Russia. Two months later, Russia annexed Crimea in retaliation. The conflict was never officially resolved, costing over 14,200 Ukrainian lives as of Feb. 21.
In an unprecedented presidential race in 2019, 73 percent of Ukrainians elected Volodymyr Zelensky over incumbent Petro Poroshenko. An actor and comedian by trade, Zelensky’s only whisper of political experience was a role as a fictional Ukranian president on a satirical TV show. Yet Zelensky’s unique set of experiences made him an appealing candidate at a time when traditional diplomacy had failed to protect Ukraine from Russia and separatist movements.
Oleksenko, who is an international student from Ukraine, feels that the president is uniquely in touch with his country. “Zelensky is probably the best person to be leading the country right now,” he said. In his opinion, Ukranians don’t need a veteran politician; they need someone who will stand with the people. Zelensky is that man.
When Biden administration offered an evacuation plan for Zelensky on Saturday, the Ukrainian President responded with a hard no. “I need ammunition,” he told the U.S. embassy, “not a ride.”
“It takes so much courage for ordinary people to decide to pursue such a political change,” Grama said. “That’s why Putin is so angry with the Ukrainians.” The country has consistently rebuked Putin’s attempts at control, maintaining a legacy of resistance. From 2004 to 2005, Ukrainians called for government accountability in The Orange Revolution, protesting Russia’s fraudulent influence in national elections. Euromaidan between 2013 and 2014, the 2019 election of Volodymyr Zelensky, Zelensky’s continued push to join NATO… None of these developments are compatible with Putin’s power drive. 
The U.S. and many European countries imposed swift sanctions against Russia this week. “But Putin doesn’t care much about the sanctions,” Grama said. “They will be tough, but not tough on him. They will be tough on the Russian population. They will suffer more economically because of sanctions; they will think more of getting bread on the table than trying to resist politically.”
“You also have to think about the impossible promises made by other actors, including the U.S.,” Grama told The Tartan. In 2008, NATO promised Ukraine and Georgia a future invitation to join the alliance. “Why would you give that promise when you know there will be such a problematic outcome?” she asked rhetorically. Putin waged war against Georgia four months after NATO's announcement. 
Kyiv has been a focal point of Slavic culture — comprising Ukrainian, Russian, and Belarusian identities — for centuries. Yet Putin is “using history to justify an obviously imperialist agenda,” Grama said in her presentation. 
Russia and Ukraine share history, language, and culture. In 1922, the two nations were established as pillars of the Soviet Union. Both suffered millions of deaths during the Holodomor, a famine in the early 1930s driven by Stalin. From 1941-44, both were occupied by Nazi forces. Both gained independence in 1991, with the disillusionment of the Soviet Union. Today, Grama noted, many Ukrainian citizens are fluent in both Ukrainian and Russian. Putin is using this fraternal bond for ambition rather than peace.
Many media outlets — including Western ones — are complicit in a “strategic form of silencing and forgetting,” Grama explained. Claims that this is the largest violent conflict in Europe since World War II erase the history of many struggles from the recent past. This is especially true of the Balkan Wars in the 90s and early 2000s. The struggle for Croatian and Bosnian independence cost over 15,000 and 100,000 lives, respectively. 
To counter this, Grama explained, “It’s important for students … to find a carefully curated list of trustworthy sources. ... Heterogeneity of sources is important to get a more nuanced image of what’s happening.” She recommends they follow reporting by journalists on the ground in Ukraine. A list of some of these reporters can be found here.

Ukranians were jarred awake at 4 a.m. local time by the trembling of tanks and the explosions from rockets, as the Russian government dropped all pretenses and launched an invasion of their smaller neighbor. Troops entered from the previously annexed Crimea, aiming for Mariupol in the South and Belarus from the North, to conquer the capital, Kyiv. Battles have begun in other areas, including the rather ominous region of Chernobyl. The existence of the Ukrainian state may soon cease, and as the international community watches on, the question emerges: "Why did this conflict, and its four-month-long build-up, arise at all?" If you look at speeches from Putin, you will get answers ranging from “the denazification of the country” to anger at the fact that NATO “encroaches on Russian borders”; however, the true answer is found from a rambling speech he gave a couple of days before the invasion, reiterated once again during the declaration of war, where he stated that Ukraine never really “existed” and instead is rightfully a province of Russia. One may question the merit of these claims, and, unsurprisingly, they have no merit whatsoever.
What would become Ukraine during early antiquity was a site where Greeks, Slavs and — later during classical times — Romans and Proto-Iranians (Cimmeranians, Scythians, etc.) interacted. During the early medieval era, the Hunnic and Turkic migrations greatly reshaped the east of the region that would later be Ukraine, while new groups of Slavs migrated from Carpathia (around modern-day Romania) into the Northern and Central part of the region. This arrangement was upended by the exploits of the Varangian Rurik and his Slavic viking syncretic state the Kievan Rus.  Occupying the Dnieper influenced a choke point between the Baltic-Byzantine trade route, this quasi-tribal meritocratic trade federation became the major power in eastern Europe, ruling from the Baltics to Crimea, and the concurrent source of pride for both Ukrainian and Russian nationalists. Trade shifted, steppe wars weakened the polity, and the Mongols brought the death knell to the Kyivans with the synecdochic city’s sacking in 1240. 
After the Mongols fractured in the 14th century, Poland and Lithuania (which united soon after) and the Crimean Khanate divided the region amongst themselves, sparking a period of foreign rule within the region. Migration into the region began from Poles, Armenians, Germans, and Jews. Regional autonomy waned, as the Polonization of the Ruthenian (pre-Ukrainian) nobility began to occur, which along with the deterioration of the peasants' conditions, caused discontent within the region. The most interesting consequence of this was the failed attempt to reconcile local Orhtodox traditions with the Polish promulgated Catholic Church, and the rise of another set of powerful horsemen, the Cossacks. 
Arising from the south of the Dnieper in their Sich (stronghold), now referred to as Zaporizhzhya, these “adventurers” were peasants tired of subjugation and disaffected wanderers from the nobility and burgher classes, who signed agreements of mutual protection with local nomadic groups (i.e. Cuman descendants) and one another, and elected their local leader, or Hetmans. These Cossacks fought against Tartar invaders, and for their democratic values against the encroaching monarchical authoritarian Muscovian Grand Principality (who would later become Russia). They joined the Orthodox brotherhood of Kyiv in 1620, and sparked a cultural revival that would lead to the Kyvian Mohyla Academy’s establishment, Ukraine First University. Khmelnytsky, a Cossack Hetman, caused a major war within the region in order to redress his grievances with the Polish Monarchy. In the process he established the roots for an independent Cossack-headed Ukrainian state, but incompetence from his successor would lead to the partition of the region between the Left and Right Banks of the Dneiper. While the Left Bank closed in on Muscovy, and saw it as “Little Russia,” the Right Bank tried to remain independent, before succumbing to Poland, and later Russia, who took all of Ukraine after late 18th Century Polish partitions. 
Russian domination over Ukraine would cause the rise of the city of Odessa, intermigrations from other parts of the empire, the disastrous Crimean war where Western Europe decided to stop the expansion of Russia into Ottoman Crimea, and failed Russification, as a 19th Century Cultural Literature movement spurned ideals of Ukrainian nationalism. After the Russian Revolution, Ukraine refused to acknowledge Soviet authority until subdued in the ‘20s. Afterwards the Lenin New Economic Policy allowed a limited recovery of Ukrainian prosperity, which was completely undermined and destroyed by the Soviet genocidal Holodomor and the Nazi invasion. Kruschev ceded Crimea to the Ukranians in the ‘50s, and as the Soviets weakened, Ukrainian nationalism strengthened. So, once the empire collapsed, the Ukranians were free once more. However, after ceding their nukes for Western protection, corruption and oligarchical machinations stymied the nation, and kept it hamstrung between the eastern European and Western spheres, until Russia’s current invasion.
It is clear that Ukraine has a clear history of independence, expansion, subjugation, and rebellion. Thus, claims that it is just a borderland (as its name translates to) are completely fallacious. However, Putin and other nationalists like him care little for historical accuracy. Whenever he claims that he is fighting the Ukrainian Nazis, he is gaslighting and attempting to distracting from the fact that his casus belli is spurious. Nationalists only like a narrative that fits them, not a critique of their misdeeds, but as the common aphorism goes, those who fail to understand history are doomed to repeat it.

This article was submitted to The Tartan by a member of the CMU student body, who, due to the nature of the article, has chosen to remain anonymous.
From the moment I heard that Scotch’n’Soda was doing “Rent,” I was against the idea. I did things within my power as a member of the org to oppose the decision, but there were no other proposals and “Rent” had a very strong and talented creative staff, so it became our Carnival show.
My main reservations came from being a queer person and my relationship, therefore, to this show. I couldn’t help but think of the fact that Jonathan Larson — a white, cis, straight man — wrote this show and based it almost entirely off of the writings of Sarah Schulman, a queer woman who had been heavily involved in activism for AIDS. Her 1990 book “People in Trouble” shares a setting, plot, characters, and even themes with “Rent,” and she was given absolutely no credit anywhere in Larson’s work. While “Rent” was revolutionary for its time, when homosexuality and queerness were hidden and feared, the fact that it was the product of a man taking the experiences of a queer woman and marketing them as his own means that it can’t really hold that same importance anymore. 
I also was concerned specifically about how the portrayal of the character Angel would be handled. Since we had just done Rocky Horror, a show with a somewhat problematic, cross-dressing character who could be read as transgender, I wanted to make sure that the only trans representation on stage from Scotch doesn’t just come in the form of vaguely gender non-conforming characters who could be cis- or transgender but always have very questionable intentions throughout their show. While Rocky has at this point been fully reclaimed by the queer community as a celebration of camp and extravagance, that is not the case with “Rent.” Angel isn’t an absurd character within an absurd universe like Franke-N-Furter. She is meant to be an actual representation of drag queens and other gender non-conforming individuals during the AIDS crisis. Reclaiming this character will take a lot of work — a lot of work that I wasn’t sure Scotch had the time nor the resources for.
This brings me to the point that while this creative staff is approaching the show with the intention of highlighting queer and POC joy, I fear that the entirely cis, mostly white nature of the original creative team might hinder that expression. I am grateful that many more queer people have become a part of the production since its proposal, from the creative and production staffs to the cast and crew. I am grateful that an effort was made to bring new members into this show, especially students of color. It still irks me, however, that the cast of characters represents a variety of queer identities, and those who have been cast in this production don't necessarily reflect that. I get that that might have been out of creatives’ control, but maybe if it was known that we would have difficulty finding queer actors to play queer characters that align and celebrate their identities (and this was known), we shouldn’t have decided to do “Rent” in the first place. I truly love the people working on this production and I am sure that it will be a good experience for many involved, I just hope that because of its mal-intentioned origin (once again emphasizing that “Rent” is the product of a white, cis, straight man's take on the work of a queer woman), the show doesn’t cause more harm than good to the communities we are trying to uplift.

Let's talk about the elephant in the room: “Euphoria.” This is the kind of show you obsess over with your best friend, particularly because which characters you like and dislike determine a lot about you. So, who’s your favorite character?
Is it Rue? She's the drug addict whose defining characteristic is an inability to stay sober for more than a week. Over the past two seasons, we have seen her single-handedly ruin the lives of people around her. The show even addresses this damage in the second season as she subway surfs through the streets, leaving a trail of destruction behind her. The most alarming part of her character is how, until she is on the brink of death, she cannot address how much her lifestyle affects her family and friends. One can only imagine how her constant cycle of recovery and relapse hurts her sister. 
What about Cassie? She's the insecure and oblivious girl who spends most of the second season trying to justify sleeping with her best friend's ex. Her most defining character trait is her ability to make everything in the world about her. This was particularly evident when she belittled Rue’s drug abuse problem, caused by her dad’s death, by comparing it to Cassie's dad leaving her family. The problem was not so much the statement (though it was problematic) but the audacity, especially since Cassie's breakdown was caused by a failed attempt to turn herself into a victim after sleeping with her best friend's love interest.
Just in case the pattern isn’t particularly apparent, let's try one more character…
Nate Jacobs, the traumatized little boy who is currently stuck in the body of an angry man. He reminds me of the movie “13 going on 30,” but he never went back to his original form because he refused to learn his lesson. He is abusive, controlling and has the emotional maturity of a five-year-old. Instead of facing his trauma, he chooses to surround himself with people he can control, people who “fully belong to him” to make up for his fractured family. Nonetheless, we let it go because it comes in an attractive package.
The point I’m trying to make is that no matter who you choose (except maybe Lexi), you are still glorifying characters with deep-seated issues that represent the worst in society. “Euphoria” sets out to be an exploration into the life of a struggling addict as she burns the world around her. It was meant to serve as a warning against drug use and give an insight on the effect of broken families on personalities. However, as a society, we take these lessons for granted and have reduced “Euphoria” to another teen drama that hypersexualizes kids and pits women against each other over an outdated trope. Moreover, its content, despite being meant for mature audiences, is easily accessible to younger audiences. This exposes them to highly abusive and sexualized behavior which could have adverse effects on their mental health.
Any way you look at it, society is again obsessing over a show that, under the guise of convoluted metaphors, exposes the youth to all kinds of toxic relationships. In addition, our uncanny ability to look past these lessons and only focus on the dramatics demonstrates our fear of confrontation when faced with controversial topics and our penchant for problematic characters.
