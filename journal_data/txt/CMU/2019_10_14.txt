At the beginning of the 1989-1990 Premier League season, with Alex Ferguson as manager, Manchester United picked up seven points in their first nine games, making it one of their worst starts to a season in history. Now, under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Manchester United is mirroring that same rough beginning from thirty years ago, with the team picking up only nine points out of a possible twenty four, dropping them to 12th in the EPL and only two points above the relegation zone. Before the Oct. 6th match against Newcastle, Solskjaer was looking for his first away win since the victory against Paris Saint-Germain six months prior. 
However, Newcastle gained the upper hand in the 72nd minute of the game with a goal from 19-year-old Matthew Longstaff. After the match, forward Marcus Rashford, took to Instagram to apologize to the fans. “You can’t hide in football and the last few weeks simply haven't been good enough. As a United fan myself, that hurts. And you deserve better. We know we need to improve and that is our sole focus as a team and as a club,” the 21-year-old wrote.
Some critics believe this losing streak is owed to the loss of Ander Herrera during the transfer window. The Spaniard left the club for Paris-Saint Germain even with a £253,000-per-week offer to stay at United. Since the beginning of Solskjaer's time as manager, United have never lost a game in the Premier League when Herrera was on the field. 
Still, this Ander Herrera theory does not explain their six month away game losing streak. Others think the problem is Solskjaer's management. The United manager has frequently been accused of living in the past, but during an interview following the draw against AZ Alkmaar, Solskjaer admitted that the game has evolved since his glory days. “We are not in the 1990s now — it’s a different era, a different group that we are building. We know there are going to be ups and downs but I’m ready to see these boys blossom. There’s not many clubs of our stature that play the young players that we do. We give them a chance to come through and I’m sure some of them will go on to be part of a successful team.” 
Solskjaer clearly envisions a brighter path for his club and his players, but the reality is staring him in the face: Manchester United has a huge problem, and that problem needs to be fixed now, not at some abstract date in the future.
Right now, Manchester United is losing fans and sponsorships, including a $518 million deal with Chevrolet who have been unimpressed with the club’s performance this season and feel as though they overpaid the team. One insider said, "It was doomed from the start. The feeling within was that Chevrolet had massively overpaid, and it was never going to get done again." Despite these losses, Ed Woodward, the executive vice-chairman, insisted that Solskjaer retained the full backing of the club. There are reports that the club is supporting Solskjaer's three year vision to get the club back on track. 
While it’s true that money is no obstacle in executing this plan, Solskjaer was hesitant to say that he would sign another striker to replace Romelu Lukaku because "as part of the three-year plan — [he] wanted to give opportunities for Anthony Martial to stake his claim as first choice centre-forward, for Marcus Rashford to also play there on occasion and for 18-year-old Mason Greenwood to be given a chance to break through." Despite the club’s outright support of Solskjaer, it is clear that he is struggling with the decision he made to not replace Lukaku, as injuries have plagued the forward line. 
With these new problems, the decision to not hire a replacement striker for Lukaku looks like a major error on the part of Solskjaer. Still, the club supports him and wants to put his plan into action. It looks like Ole Gunnar Solskjaer isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.

The NHL season has begun after a quiet summer. Compared to the MLB and NBA, the NHL offseason was tame. Both the NBA and the MLB had major free agent signings over the summer, but the NHL did not have the same level of movement. So, as we return to another season of hockey, we might expect some of the same results. If the recent past is any indication, though, we might be in for another exciting campaign.
First, some backstory: last June, the Saint Louis Blues of the Western Conference claimed the Stanley Cup in a thrilling seven-game series against the Boston Bruins. The Stanley Cup playoffs featured many familiar contenders, like the San Jose Sharks and our very own Pittsburgh Penguins, but the Tampa Bay Lightning were most people's favorite after tying the NHL record with 62 wins on the season.
In the playoffs, the Lightning were shockingly swept in the first round, and the Saint Louis Blues turned around from their last place position on Jan. 3 to win the Stanley Cup. Now, shortly into the new season, the Blues are again looking to be a strong team. Additionally, the Bruins have kept most of their team together, and they are looking for a chance at redemption.
Besides seeing if these teams can keep playing well, one story line to watch is whether the more established teams can bounce back from disappointing campaigns. In the Eastern conference, the Washington Capitals and Pittsburgh Penguins, the most recent champions before Saint Louis, were both eliminated in the first round by young teams. In the West, other contenders lost earlier than expected, such as the Winnipeg Jets. But the teams who underperformed performed comparably well by the standards of Tampa Bay, after the Lightning were swept by a Columbus Blue Jackets team that was then quickly expelled in the second round by Boston. These teams will hope for a return to form and a chance at a cup.
Of course, every team is looking to the cup, even this early in the season. Young teams who produced surprise results in the regular season like the New York Islanders will look to pick up where they left off and build on the regular season for postseason success. Other teams like San Jose will worry their championship window is closing and will look to finish off years of work. There are also plenty of teams who were not in the playoffs last year that have high hopes. At the beginning of last season, Saint Louis was one of them.
The NHL also has exciting new talents to watch this year, starting with the number one pick in the NHL draft, Jack Hughes. Hughes played for the United States national team development program and put up a program record 228 points, and he rightfully became one of the most hyped American prospects ever. His biggest rival from the 2019 Draft, second overall pick Kaapo Kakko, also impressed scouts by winning a world junior and a world championship with Finland. Both prospects are 18 years old, and they play for the New Jersey Devils and New York Rangers respectively, which is a dangerous pairing. Their rivalry will be fascinating to watch for many seasons to come.
As for predictions, the NHL is notoriously hard to predict. Other sports leagues like the NBA have a clear group of favorites, but hockey is never so orderly. However, I have done my best to predict some of the league's award winners this year:
Stanley Cup Champions: Boston Bruins
Runner-up: Las Vegas Golden Knights
Presidents' Trophy Winner (Best Regular Season): Calgary Flames
Hart Memorial Trophy Winner (Most Valuable Player): Connor McDavid, Edmonton Oilers
Vezina Trophy Winner (Best Goalie): Braden Holtby, Washington Capitals
Calder Memorial Trophy (Best Rookie): Jack Hughes, New Jersey Devils

The 2019 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships, held in Stuttgart, Germany, is one of the most important competitions leading up to the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, with over 500 athletes from 92 countries vying for podium positions. The final standings would not only play a huge part in team selection for the Olympics, but would also give some athletes the chance to qualify for individual events.
Leading the charge for medals for Team USA was Simone Biles. With 20 World Championship medals under her belt, Biles came into the competition tied for most decorated female gymnast in Championship history. She was also only 3 medals short of the most decorated gymnast of all time, Vitaly Scherbo of Belarus. Biles was poised to compete in the team event, along with 5 individual events.
Biles competed in all 4 rotations of the team competition. She received scores over 15.000 on the vault and floor (the only one to do so in the latter apparatus), and earned the highest score in 3 of the 4 events, leading the United States Women's National Gymnastics Team to a record-tying 5th consecutive world title.
Biles began the women’s individual all-around on the vault, scoring 9.333 for execution on top of a 6.000 for difficulty. Despite receiving a 0.100 deduction for landing with one foot slightly out of bounds, her final score of 15.233 was the highest on the apparatus (and the highest in the overall event), and she finished the rotation at the top of the rankings.
The uneven bars came next for Biles, and she performed a stunning routine, dismounting with a double-twisting double back and sticking the landing. She received a difficulty score of 6.200 and an execution score of 8.533 for a total of 14.733, matching her score from the qualifying round. With a combined score of 29.966 after two rotations, Simone Biles retained her first place position.
Biles’s third rotation was the balance beam. Her routine seemed near-perfection, except for a small hiccup on her straddle jump with half turn from a side stand, and her dismount was well-executed. The judges awarded her 6.200 for difficulty and 8.433 for execution, for a total score of 14.633. Once again, Biles scored the highest on the apparatus, and her cumulative score of 44.599 seemed to solidify her podium position.
The final rotation for Biles was the floor exercise. Executing her signature moves on the first two passes, dubbed the Biles I and the Biles II, she scored 6.600 on difficulty and 8.200 on execution. Despite receiving 0.400 points in deductions for stepping out of bounds on her landings, Biles’s final score of 14.400 was more than enough for her to maintain her first place position.
Biles’s final total of 58.999 points in the individual all-around was 2.100 points more than her closest competitor—a record-breaking margin since the implementation of the new scoring system in 2006.
In the women’s vault, Biles performed even better than in the individual all-around, scoring 15.333 on her first vault and 15.466 on her second, averaging 15.399 and claiming another world title. This achievement brought her level with Belarus’s Vitaly Scherbo’s medal count.
Although Biles missed the podium on the uneven bars by 0.100 points, her spirit was undeterred. On the final day of the competition, while the whole world watched, Biles placed first on beam and floor with scores of 15.066 and 15.133 respectively — once again the only competitor to score above 15.000 in both events, outscoring the runner-up by a whole point in the latter. The sum of these triumphs has brought her World Championship medal count up to 25. This means that Biles has now surpassed Scherbo’s record to become the most decorated gymnast at the World Championships in history.
Biles appears certain to compete in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and extend her winning streak. For now, she will continue to make history while simultaneously inspiring young gymnasts worldwide to aspire, dream, and strive toward greater heights.

On Tuesday, Oct. 8, Chicago Fire midfielder and former German international player Bastian Schweinsteiger announced his official retirement from professional play. A versatile player once regarded as one of the best midfielders in the world, Schweinsteiger leaves a considerable legacy behind.
Bastian Schweinsteiger began his senior career with Bayern Munich’s reserve team in 2001, scoring 2 goals in his 36 appearances. He was given a debut at age 18 by Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld the next year. Schweinsteiger quickly became an integral part of the squad, becoming, as teammate Mario Gómez told uefa.com, the “midfield motor.”
In total, Schweinsteiger made 500 appearances for Bayern Munich, scoring 68 goals. Over the course of 13 years, he helped the team to 8 Bundesliga titles, 7 DFB-Pokal cups, and a Champions League title—6 doubles and 1 treble. He was later inducted into the FC Bayern Munich Hall of Fame. In 2015, he was signed by Manchester United and played for 2 seasons, but the arrival of José Mourinho in 2016 led to Schweinsteiger being benched for much of his second season. Although he had made 31 appearances for United in 2015-16, he was allowed only 4 appearances in 2016-17.
In the spring of 2017, Bastian Schweinsteiger joined Major League Soccer (MLS) side Chicago Fire, guiding them into the MLS playoffs for the first time in half-a-decade. He played for two more seasons, finishing his time in Chicago with 92 appearances and 8 goals, having been named to the MLS All-Star team twice.
All in all, Schweinsteiger made 663 appearances at the club level, with 80 total goals to his name. His 500 appearances for Bayern places him ninth in overall appearances for the club. Schweinsteiger was an indispensable player on the international stage. From his international debut in 2004 to his retirement from international play in 2016, he was selected to be a part of the German squad for every major international tournament.
His first international goals came during the 2006 World Cup in Germany. Although Germany was beaten in the semi-finals by Italy, Schweinsteiger’s brace in the third place match against Portugal led to him being named Man of the Match.
In the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, Schweinsteiger was named Man of the Match once again, following a 4-0 quarter-final victory against Argentina—a game in which he provided 2 assists while simultaneously helping to prevent Lionel Messi from scoring. He later captained the German squad to overcome Uruguay in the 3rd place match, finishing the competition tied for the most number of assists and being named to the 2010 World Cup Dream Team.
In the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, Schweinsteiger once again proved invaluable, playing a critical midfield role as part of the German squad. His stellar positioning and sweeping deliveries contributed in large part to the team’s eventual crowning as World Cup champions.
Schweinsteiger was named captain of the German team after Philipp Lahm’s retirement, and he set a record for the most number of appearances made by a German player in European Championship matches during Euro 2016. He retired from international play after the competition.
Over the course of his international career, Schweinsteiger made 121 caps for Germany—a number bested only by Lucas Podolski, Miroslav Klose, and Lothar Matthȁus—scoring 24 goals in the process. In 2018, he was awarded the Bavarian Order of Merit.
In his retirement announcement tweet, Bastian Schweinsteiger said, “Saying goodbye as an active player makes me feel a little nostalgic, but I am also looking forward to the exciting challenges that await me soon. I will remain faithful to football.” He is set to take on a position as a soccer analyst for Sportschau on ARD.
There is no doubt that Schweinsteiger’s career has been a long and fruitful one. He has left a permanent and unquestionable impact on the global soccer scene.

I guess it’s time for me to join the list of people blacklisted by the Chinese government. Let’s talk about China and basketball.
So Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Rockets, spoke out about the Hong Kong protests and stood with protestors. I mean, what was he thinking? He’s an American! How dare he speak out against human rights abuses committed in a country where he doesn’t live? He doesn’t know what’s going on there. All he has seen is out-of-context video evidence of police brutality against unarmed protestors and the violent crackdown by the Chinese government. Also, Morey is just the general manager of the most popular basketball team in China. Sports, morals, and politics can never mix, and that’s a known fact.
Of course, the owner of the Rockets was quick to shut down Morey and apologize for his comments, and the NBA “regretted” Morey’s views. Good on them. Morey’s comments were a clear threat to the NBA’s profitability in China, and we all know that profit is more important than human rights. Even Morey walked back his statement, talking about how little understanding he had of the situation and how he has understood Xi Jingping and the Communist Party’s perspective. Oh I’m sorry, I meant "other" perspectives.
But then the NBA (sort of) walked back their walk back of Morey’s comments? Adam Silver, the NBA Commissioner, backed Morey. But he also didn’t back Morey? Silver said that the NBA couldn’t censor their players, but they don’t endorse or agree with what they say. China Central Television (which, aptly, spells CCTV) responded immediately, and said that endorsing views that threaten “national sovereignty and social stability” shouldn’t be permitted.
Now that’s ice cold China. Honestly, I don’t get why the NFL isn’t more popular there. Also, what’s with the fence riding Adam? You’re either with the Chinese government or against them. You can’t be both. Do what Blizzard did. Ban your athletes and anyone else who speaks out, take their money away from them, and obviously, don’t do it for the Chinese government. Do it because you don’t want to have players make “divisive statements” that are in violation with your (and Tencent’s) code of conduct.
However, I will admit, the fence-riding makes sense. He wants to show Americans he is taking a stand, but also, he wants to keep the Chinese market open as he goes to Shanghai for damage control. In essence, he wants to have his cake and eat it too. But is paying lip service to your values worth losing 4 billion dollars? I’m a bald, dumb 20 year old in an overpriced college who hasn’t played sports in six years, and even I’d think twice about losing that much money in my international sports franchise. Like, why punish hundreds of millions of Chinese viewers by making them lose access to their favorite sport? Think about the poor viewers in China who will be deprived of their basketball.
In all seriousness though, cut ties with China. Honestly, every American company should. It’s not acceptable. Let’s actually start pretending we value the things we say we do instead of being capitalist cronies seeking profit by making a deal with the devil, who in this case is an authoritarian Winnie the Pooh.

Billions of years ago, the floor of the Gale Crater was likely an ancient oasis, according to the latest telemetry from NASA’s Curiosity rover on Mars. But today, the rover is exploring the dry rocks and mineral salts that remain from this once lively region. In a paper published in Nature Geoscience this week, Curiosity scientists piece together the data sent back from Mars to discover the cycle of water flow through the crater over the eons.
The Gale Crater was created when a massive impact occurred on the surface of Mars, with sediment carried into the crater by water and wind in the following years. Weathering effects also created Mount Sharp, where each layer of bare rock reveals something about a period of Martian history.
Lead author William Rapin of the California Institute of Technology said in a press release, “we went to Gale Crater because it preserves this unique record of a changing Mars. Understanding when and how the planet's climate started evolving is a piece of another puzzle: When and how long was Mars capable of supporting microbial life at the surface?”
Curiosity had previously explored a nearby 150-meter-tall stack of sedimentary rocks known as Sutton Island as well as mud cracks called Old Soaker in 2017, showing that once-submerged regions of the planet underwent dry cycles as the water concentrated into brine. Lakes usually leave pure salt crystals behind when they dry up, but those on Sutton Island are highly sedimentary, betraying the fact that the environment was once full of shallow ponds filled with briny water.
According to Rapin, patterns of change on Mars are closely related to those on Earth due to the similarity of the planets in their early days. For example, saline lakes on South America’s Altiplano may be undergoing a similar process to Sutton Island on Mars. “During drier periods, the Altiplano lakes become shallower, and some can dry out completely,” Rapin said. “The fact that they're vegetation-free even makes them look a little like Mars.”
Similarly, the sediment deposits on the floor of the Gale Crater tell a story of how the Martian environment gradually transitioned from wet to a freezing desert, which is its current state. Ashwin Vasavada is a scientist on the Curiosity project at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, CA, which leads the Mars Science Laboratory that owns Curiosity. In a press release, he said, “As we climb Mount Sharp, we see an overall trend from a wet landscape to a drier one. But that trend didn't necessarily occur in a linear fashion. More likely, it was messy, including drier periods, like what we're seeing at Sutton Island, followed by wetter periods, like what we're seeing in the ‘clay-bearing unit’ that Curiosity is exploring today.”
While future exploration will reveal more details about the history of Mars’ surface, the latest findings may indicate that for much of the past several billion years, the planet may be have dominated by shallow lakes and streams. In the future, scientists may be telling a similar story about Earth.

Maternal exposure to a ubiquitous form of industrial pollution is capable of damaging an offspring’s immune system, according to a new study. This damage is even passed onto future generations, undermining the body’s ability to defend itself against infections. Dr. B Paige Lawrence led the research in collaboration with the University of Rochester Medical Center’s Department of Environmental Medicine. The study was published in Cell Press’ journal iScience. Experimentation was performed on mice, since their immune system function is not particularly different from that of humans.
“The old adage ‘you are what you eat’ is a touchstone for many aspects of human health. But in terms of the body's ability to fight off infections, this study suggests that, to a certain extent, you may also be what your great-grandmother ate,” explained Lawrence, in a University of Rochester Medical Center press release.
Since the pollution weakens the immune system over multiple generations, it might serve as an explanation for the many variations seen during flu episodes. The protective effect of the flu vaccine varies among different individuals. In the midst of pandemic flu outbreaks, some are not heavily affected by the flu, whereas others might become very sick. Age, mutations of the virus, and many other factors provide an explanation for some of these variations. However, the diversity of immune responses to flu infection is not fully accounted for by these factors. 
“When you are infected or receive a flu vaccine, the immune system ramps up production of specific kinds of white blood cells in response,” Lawrence said. “The larger the response, the larger the army of white blood cells, enhancing the ability of the body to successfully fight off an infection. Having a smaller size army — which we see across multiple generations of mice in this study — means that you're at risk for not fighting the infection as effectively.”
The researchers conducted their experiment by exposing pregnant mice to a chemical known as dioxin in levels similar to that of the environment. Dioxin is a typical byproduct of industrial production as well as the incineration of waste. Some consumer products have this chemical as well. In any of these cases, dioxin eventually infiltrates food products and is eaten by humans. Dioxins bioaccumulate, and are thus found rather frequently in animal-based food. 
Cytotoxic T cells are white blood cells that protect the body from foreign pathogens that include bacteria and viruses. They find and eliminate cells with mutations that may cause cancer. These blood cells were produced less frequently and exhibited impaired function when the mice in the study were infected with the influenza A virus. The researchers saw this effect in the offspring of female mice exposed to dioxin, as well as in subsequent generations; the effect even impacted their “great-grandchildren,” so to speak. Female mice, the study found, were affected more than male mice. 
The hypothesis of the researchers was based on the fact that dioxin binds to a protein known as AHR which is found in cells. They believe that dioxin alters genetic instructions’ transcription in some way, that dioxin changes the cellular machinery which causes genes to be expressed, and that future generations inherit this alteration. 
All in all, the research provides another frightening insight into how anthropogenic emissions, especially of harsh chemicals such as dioxin, can harm the human quality of life for generations to come.

This year’s Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to the pioneers behind lithium-ion batteries, the rechargeable batteries used in many electronic devices, including pacemakers and smartphones. Scientists John B. Goodenough of the University of Texas, Akira Yoshino of Meijo University, and M. Stanley Whittingham of Binghamton University (SUNY) were presented with the prestigious grant of nine million Swedish krona on Oct. 9, 2019.
This award choice may seem surprising, given the ubiquitous influence of lithium-ion batteries in our day-to-day lives—the product made its market debut in 1991, and has since been changing the way we view power. Despite the long wait, some in the scientific community have come out in favor of this choice, applauding the selection based on that very ubiquitous influence. Bonnie Charpentier, president of the American Chemical Society (ACS), commented in an interview with BBC World News, “In the face of increasing threats from extreme climate change, today’s announcement shines a welcome bright light on the portability of energy that has enabled unprecedented advances in communication, transportation and other tools to support critical aspects of life around the world.”
Professor Dame Carol Robinson, president of the U.K.’s Royal Society of Chemistry, said of the laureates in another interview with BBC World News, “Their pioneering research is everywhere you look and a great example of how chemistry has paved the way for everything from the mobile phone in your pocket to the electric vehicles and home energy storage of the future.”
It will be exciting to see what the future holds for Goodenough, Yoshino, and Whittingham as the possibilities of renewable energy research increase. The trio seem to have a fondness for their breakthrough, Yoshino calling it “a life-changing invention for many people, [...] making fundamental change all over the world to allow access to electrical power” in an interview with The Washington Post.

“I always say, one’s company, two’s a crowd, and three’s a party.”
Artist Andy Warhol would agree that three is the magic number at 2019’s Nobel Prize celebration. Like chemistry, the 2019 Nobel Prize of Medicine has been claimed by a trio: William G. Kaelin Jr. of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Sir Peter J. Ratcliffe of Oxford University and the Francis Crick Institute, and Gregg L. Semenza of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, for their contributions to research in hypoxia.
Hypoxia is a condition characterized by a deficiency in the amount of oxygen reaching body tissues. Some of the outward symptoms may include asthma attacks or severe shortness of breath. In response, the kidney secretes a specific hormone known as erythropoietin (EPO). Semenza’s line of research investigated possible connections between a generation of EPO and specific DNA segments. Ratcliffe, on the other hand, was able to discover oxygen’s role in regulating EPO production.
Simultaneously, Kaelin found the expression of several hypoxia-regulated genes in cancerous cells, without the genes for von Hippel-Lindau’s disease (VHL disease). VHL, characterized by cysts and tumors in multiple organs, is a condition that increases the risk of cancer in those with the gene. This led him to find a link between the hypoxia-induced factor with von Hippel-Lindau’s disease.
Together, Kaelin, Ratcliffe, and Semenza were able to synthesize their findings to create a new understanding of how somatic cells in the human body sense oxygen levels, especially from the perspective of hypoxia. At low levels of oxygen, the factor (HIF) binds to DNA in the cell nucleus and causes EPO to generate, thus initiating the physiological responses associated with hypoxia.
The recent discovery has paved the way for research in many other conditions (especially anemia associated with renal failure) linked with the oxygen levels in cells, as well as a new type of therapy using an oxygen-regulatory mechanism. Cellular machinery regulated by oxygen plays an important role in cancer growth, as it is used to stimulate blood vessel formation and reshape the human metabolism, enabling the proliferation of cancer cells.
To the surprise of many, this isn’t the first adventure for these three Musketeers of medicine. The three scientists previously shared the Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research award in 2016 for their work in this area.

20 years after the release of his bestselling debut, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, Stephen Chbosky returned to the literary world on Oct. 1 with the release of his horror novel Imaginary Friend. Although it may come as a surprise that he is adventuring into this genre, this 720-page tome has been years in the making. Chbosky always wanted to write horror and was inspired by the work of another great novelist named Stephen: Stephen King, of course.
This past Monday, Oct. 7, Chbosky returned to his hometown of Pittsburgh for the Imaginary Friend tour. Hosted by Pittsburgh Arts & Lectures and the Oakland branch of the Carnegie Library, the theater was filled to the brim with adoring family, friends, and fans waiting to hear Chbosky speak and get their questions answered. Hearing Chbosky speak in his hometown about his childhood and his experiences with various teachers who inspired him was a truly unique experience.
Chbosky began with a reading of chapter six of his novel: the scene where the main character follows a cry for help into the heart of the forest and disappears. Ominously, the last sentence of the chapter only reads one word per page:

I’m usually a bit too jumpy to appreciate good horror, but I was definitely captivated by Chbosky’s read aloud and am curious how his style changes across such vastly different genres and page lengths (Perks is only 224 pages). My main motivation for attending the event, though, was the question and answer portion of the evening.
As a renowned author, screenwriter, and filmmaker, Chbosky has made significant contributions to the literary and film world but comes across as quite humble and welcoming to those who are looking to break into both industries. Answering a question on filmmaking, he told the audience, “It’s not a magic trick … just go out and do it.” He said there’s “no such thing as aspiring.” If you write, you’re a writer; if you make films, you’re a filmmaker. You “don’t [have to] wait for permission from anybody.”
He also made sure to be inclusive in his casting and present the best representation of the characters as they were meant to be. When he directed, produced, and wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of Perks, he insisted on Ezra Miller as Patrick. Additionally, even though there was a lot of smoking and drug use in the novel, he decided to cut back on smoking to present Patrick as a gay character that people could look up to in real life.
When working on Wonder, based on the mid-grade novel of the same name by R. J. Palacio, he first sought out any actor who fit Auggie’s description. Only one person tried out for the role, and it didn’t ultimately work out. Although he was pressed by someone in the audience about the accuracy of the portrayal by Jacob Tremblay, Chbosky argued that he reached out to the community to properly understand stories like Auggie’s. He would rather have the movie released to tell stories like Auggie’s than not at all. The acclaim from public audiences and critics meant nothing to him compared to the positive reception from the community the story was meant for.
One of the main things that tie all the stories he tells together is the idea that no matter how different these stories may seem, “people are much more alike than they are different.” When writing characters, he first looks “for a unity … for everything we have in common.” Through his work on Wonder, his belief in this idea only grew. Now, he tries his best to integrate characters often seen as different into his stories when he can, “not as a gimmick, but a show of respect.” In the end, we are not that different.
In terms of his newest horror, Chbosky explained that he wanted to “take something we all remember … something so innocent” as looking at the clouds and watching Saturday morning cartoons and turn them into something with a bit of “menace.” Those two activities inspired Christopher’s horrifying imaginary friend. The “two against the world” mentality that exemplifies Christopher and his mother’s relationship also played into the story, with Chbosky exploring what it would be like if a child wasn’t too small to protect his mom from harm.
Another upcoming project for Chbosky has him returning to the realm of film. He will soon be leading the team that will bring Broadway sensation Dear Evan Hansen to the big screen. This role makes sense for him based on his previous work, and the studio agreed with his playful comment that he is “literally the prototype director” for this type of show: having dealt with many hard-hitting topics that, like Evan Hansen, are “not … obvious translation[s]” to film.
The night closed with audience members waiting for up to an hour, myself included, to meet Chbosky and get our novels signed. Overall, it was an enlightening and inspiring night. Expect a review of Imaginary Friend in the coming weeks.

Arguably one of the most controversial movies of this year, Joker has received mixed reviews since its wide release on Oct. 4. While Joker won The Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival, the movie had a mixed reception from both critics and common viewers alike. Some lauded it as a brilliant portrayal of the Joker, while others criticized it for encouraging a mass shooter mentality.
The Joker is one of Batman’s most iconic nemeses, with several different silver screen adaptations of the villain. He was portrayed by Jack Nicholson in Tim Burton’s Batman (1989), Heath Ledger in Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight (2008), and Jared Leto in David Ayer's Suicide Squad (2016). However, Phoenix’s portrayal of Joker differs tremendously from anything seen on the silver screen thus far. Whether it is Ledger’s psychotic Joker or Leto’s over-the-top Joker, both actors portray Joker in his villainous phase, while he is wreaking havoc all around Gotham City. However, Joker details the story of the titular character’s descent into madness through some of the most unfortunate circumstances of which one can think. 
The movie details the backstory of Arthur Fleck (Joker’s real name), a struggling comedian living with his mother who has a condition that leads to painful, uncontrollable laughter. Like a row of dominoes falling over, one unfortunate event leads to the next in Fleck’s life, and he can do nothing but sit back and watch as his life falls apart. Through this fleshed out backstory, the audience actually learns about the Joker’s motives as compared to the other renditions of the character that seemingly wreaks havoc for no other reason than they are insane and enjoy chaos. Fleck’s vendetta against the rich in Gotham City is a central theme in this movie as many of his unfortunate circumstances were the result of the wealthy’s actions.
Regardless of its moral standing, the movie itself is extremely well done. This is the only movie that does not have Batman for the Joker to go up against. Instead, it is simply Fleck against society, and the movie enforces his descent into madness through visual aids. 
The use of color in this movie is very interesting, whether in Fleck’s outfits or in the setting. In the first half of the movie, everything is portrayed in very dark colors that emphasize Fleck’s depression and struggles. Fleck’s clothing is often neutral to dark colors, with the one instance of bright colors being when he is in his clown outfits. Later on, when Fleck has “snapped” and embraced the madness he is feeling, his clothing choice becomes far brighter. In the now-iconic scene of him dancing on the stairs, his suit is bright red, yellow, and green. This sense of change through costume is also seen through his clown makeup. While the overall design of his clown makeup does not change extensively through the course of the movie, there are subtle details that reflect his change in mindset. In the beginning, the makeup around his lips is thicker and more rounded, much like a happy-go-lucky clown that is meant to make children happy instead of terrifying them. However, when he goes on the Murray Franklin show, the smile is now a lot more sinister and resembles the wide red smile that everyone more commonly associates with the Joker.
Another important feature is the use of parental figures in Fleck’s life: radio host Murray Franklin and industrialist Thomas Wayne. Fleck idolizes Franklin and aspires to become a successful comedian and receive recognition. However, when Franklin mocks Fleck’s attempt at stand-up comedy at Pogos, Fleck feels betrayed by his father figure and the person he admired most. Similarly, Penny Fleck, Arthur’s mother, constantly mentioned Thomas Wayne throughout the movie, emphasizing how great of a man he is. Arthur’s discovery of a letter of Penny’s leads him to believe that Thomas Wayne is his actual father, and even goes as far as to confront him and his son Bruce (Batman) with this knowledge. However, Thomas Wayne shatters his dreams when he not only harshly rejected Arthur, but also led Arthur to the discovery that Penny was mentally ill and abused him as a child. The loss of all parental figures greatly contributed to his descent.
Phoenix’s Joker certainly differs greatly from any of its predecessors in terms of the storyline the producers and director chose to take. Joker was a well-produced movie with a lot of symbolism and small details that form a cohesive story, notwithstanding the social commentary or what it teaches the audience in terms of morality.

The Vault Taproom hosted a launch event on Thursday, Oct. 10 that welcomed people to try the innovative tap system, sample some dishes from the menu, and get a feel for the new restaurant on East Carson Street in the South Side.
After a soft opening in July, The Vault is finding its place in the restaurant scene in Pittsburgh, set apart by its central feature, which is, of course, the taps. When people walk into the storefront, they present their credit card and driver’s license to receive a card with a chip that will allow them to use the self-serve iPourIt system of taps along the left wall of the room.
Above each of the 26 different beer and cider taps and four wine taps are digital screens. When a customer taps the card to the screen, it will light green, allowing them to pour themselves however much they want to drink, measured to the 10th of an ounce. Customers are charged by the ounce. The card has a limit of 32 ounces, but people can ask a staffer to re-up their card.
Co-owner Kyle Wolfe calls the system “low-risk” because customers can try out several different drafts without ordering an entire drink, like at a typical ordering restaurant. If you’re trying out a drink you’ve never had before and aren’t sure you’ll like, you can pour yourself an ounce first, and go from there. Wolfe, a University of Pittsburgh alum, was working as an engineering when he and co-owner Josh Hammaker (a fellow Pitt grad) stumbled on the self-pouring system at a bar in Charlottesville, VA in 2017.
They decided to bring it to Pittsburgh, and two years later, the Vault opened. The iPourIt system was installed in the Oxford Athletic Club in Wexford, PA, but The Vault boasts the very first system within the city. Serving yourself takes a second to learn and get accustomed too, but soon, everyone at the launch event is at the wall trying new drinks and mingling at the tables set aside for the event.
The Vault has a chill but upscale vibe, perfect for a nice dinner after work for young professionals. For college students, it isn’t hard to imagine a large group venturing into the South Side on the 54 bus on a Friday or Saturday night, ready to unwind. In addition to the taps, there is a U-shaped bar on the left of the room that features changing lights and the go-to spot for cocktails.
Then the food arrives. Dubbed “Southern fusion,” The Vault’s menu by Chef Todd Cassell is filled with entrees like honey and black garlic calamari, bourbon blazed pork chop, and duck confit banh mi, representing a great mix of flavors and styles all together at once. Wolfe describes the menu as “familiar food, comfort food, but with a twist.”
For the launch event, The Vault prepared three dishes from the menu for guests to sample. Their signature Nantucket fried green tomatoes, smoked brisket Rueben slider, and grilled pound cake with berries.
At first glance, the breaded and fried orange-gold tone of the green tomatoes looks like chicken, but after a bite, it’s clear that this is a juicy tomato. Topped with spicy whipped feta and a sweet and spicy tomato jam, all the flavors complemented each other really well.
The smoked brisket Rueben is a twist on the classic Reuben. Switching out the corned beef and swiss for brisket and gruyere, the slider (and full sandwich on the regular menu) exemplifies the restaurant’s commitment to unique takes on familiar foods. Other examples of this on the menu are the chicken noodle pho made with angel hair and the “Not your grandma’s mac and cheese” with orecchiette.
The pound cake is also a fun idea — who would think to grill a cake? With some whipped cream and mixed berries for garnish, it’s a nice sweet finish to a heavy meal.
For students, getting to the South Side will be the biggest challenge to try out the interesting elements The Vault offers. For the over-21 crowd, the tap system is incredibly unique and a fun way to test new drafts, especially if your experience is limited to the standard college six-packs. If you’re underage or not prone to drink, the menu itself is varied enough to give it a try.
The South Side is such a vibrant and diverse area, and East Carson is always bustling with activity any given night. I’m excited to go back to the Vault on a normal night, sit down with friends, adventurously select something that sticks out on the menu, and walk back and forth from the taps, using up our cards into the night.

Swedish progressive metal band Opeth released their 13th studio album, In Cauda Veneneum, a few weeks ago, and I have been very hyped about it. Opeth is one of my favorite artists ever, and I love all their albums — even their last three, which many fans don’t like. Their past three albums aren’t metal by any means, but that’s not why Opeth fans aren’t big on it. Their 2003 album, Damnation, a fan favorite, is devoid of any distorted guitars and growl vocals. Fans haven’t liked their recent albums because they don’t sound like their usual sound, a style that personifies darkness in a way that isn’t cringeworthy (looking at you, My Chemical Romance) with flavors of folk music.
Their newest album is the most metal they have sounded since the late 2000s, and it’s the most fully realized version of the classic progressive rock sound they have been moving towards. Progressive music is difficult to define and conceptualize — it doesn’t mean playing something technical or complicated, because then a lot of bands would fall into that realm. There are many bands in the progressive genre that aren’t technically complicated, like Pink Floyd. The genre exists in a weird space where you have to hear it to actually classify it. As far as progressive metal goes, even Opeth isn’t that technically complicated in comparison to bands like Between the Buried and Me or TOOL.
The production on this album is off the charts. It feels so much more alive, and it sounds like the dark, atmospheric, and macabre sound that defined them for so long. The rhythm guitar tone feels like it’s out of the ‘70s, but also has the chunkiness of modern metal bands. But it’s the lead guitar that shines. The solos are tasteful, refraining from overly complicated licks, and each solo hits hard. The best solo on the album is from “Dignity,” which works not only as a great way to show off what the band has to offer in terms of its blistering lead lines, but also in the context of the whole album. The solos also never overshadow the rest of the song the way they do in other metal songs. It feels naturally integrated as a melody line in the song’s overall structure, rather than a chance for the guitars to flex their chops.
The acoustic sections sound more like classic Opeth sections from Blackwater Park and Damnation rather than ‘70s psychedelic bands like Love, although the influence of those bands can’t go unacknowledged. In fact, the influences of the band can be heard throughout. It’s combined with their usual flavor of folk music and progressive metal. Songs like “Charlatan” sound like Meshuggah, another contemporary Swedish metal band, combined with progressive rock groups like Van Der Graff Generator. There are influences of other progressive rock groups like Genesis and King Crimson in songs like “Universal Truth” and “Lovelorn Crime,” and the chord progressions take a lot from psychedelic bands like The Zombies with unexpected turns in chords. There are a lot of jazz-influenced sections throughout the album, with songs like “The Garroter” in particular boasting an out-of-time section weirdly reminiscent of Dave Brubeck. A lot of the vocals also take inspiration from singers ranging from art rock singers like Linda Perhacs to Elton John to classic vocalist Scott Walker. The chugging riffs of “Heart of Hand” sounds akin to songs like “Gates of Bablyon” by Rainbow and “Powerslave” by Iron Maiden, before transitioning to my favorite acoustic section on the entire album that sounds like it was co-written by Love. There is a lot of Jehtro Tull in their sound too, especially with they fuse folk into their songs like “Next of Kin.”
The songwriting from Opeth is almost unparalleled in the rock and metal scene. There are many who have come close or have matched Opeth, but none have really surpassed their compositional ability. It’s amazing how Mikael Akerfeldt, the frontman and principal songwriter, incorporates all the music he listens to into his own and makes it sound unique. In Cauda Veneneum is the best they have sounded in a very long time, and it’s in my top five of their discography, although it does take a few listens to come around to it fully. Opeth and their records, to use a cliche, have aged like fine wine.
Standout tracks:
“Dignity”
“Heart of Hand”
“Universal Truth”
“The Garroter”

Intersections strove to highlight the meeting of “the arts, science, technology, and culture through a survey of cutting-edge projects cultivated at the STUDIO and developed by national and international artists,” according to a press release. Through the use of interactive displays and boundary pushing sculptures and videos, Intersections succeeded.
“CLOUDS,” an interactive documentary by James George and Jonathan Minard, allowed users to feel the meeting of “code and culture,” using an VR headset to include the viewer in the world of “CLOUDS.” The documentary contained interviews from more than forty artists, designers, hackers, and thinkers. Combined, these interviews served as a testimony towards the experience of a collective in developing open source tools that formed the foundation of a “global creative culture.” Interspersed between these videos were visuals that transported users from the gallery into the universe of the documentary. In some segments, beautiful blue lights surrounded the user and moved rapidly around them, giving the effect that the user was moving as well, as if they, too, were in the clouds.
“The Milk Truck,” a mobile breastfeeding unit, was designed in response to the heavy public criticism that many mothers face when trying to breastfeed their children outside. The colorful truck, with a breast acting as a siren on the roof of the car, is an intersection of activism, humor, and art. The truck was created by Jill Miller, a faculty member at the School of Art at Carnegie Mellon. Donning a pair of headphones, each user listened and watched as they were brought to the pink-hued, justice seeking world of the Milk Truck. The concept and execution of the truck was then explained to them by Miller, including a tour of the truck and a deep dive into its design elements. The truck grants a private, clean space for women to pump breast milk at work, at public events, or functions. This idea not only brings awareness to the problems that new moms face in public, but also gives these moms a space to provide for their child.
Intersections was nothing short of revolutionary. From the theater video displayed on a huge wall to the baby crib being pushed by a mechanical arm to the sculptures of human bodies with computers as the heads, Intersections managed to excite, thrill, and intrigue its audience. The electrifying chatter in the air as the guests discovered the interactive displays, the mind-bending sculptures, and the thoughtful written pieces incorporated into the art, was indicative of the amorphous magic of the gallery.

The human skin encapsulates us, and to a certain extent, represents us. The exhibit This Skin of Ours, curated by Liz Park, embodies all the ways in which skin communicates with the self, experiences the world, and collects the outcome of those instances in physical manifestations. As the various artists collectively propose in the description of the exhibit in the Miller ICA pamphlet, This Skin of Ours suggests “to collectively feel our way through this world where we will inevitably end up scarred, but in the shared experiences that allow for a deeper understanding of the other.”
Upon entering the gallery, a conglomeration of vibrant colors pops out of the wide open space. One thing that stood out more than the color variance was the fact that on this half of the exhibition, none of the pieces were accompanied with labels providing context or background. Even the artists are not revealed as the observer shifts swiftly from one piece to the next in the open space. The pieces just sit on the wall on their own, isolated and independent. The spectator, then, is left to make their own judgements on what a piece means and stands for to them.
It’s not only the artists’ illustrations of the multifunctional purposes of the human skin. It’s that the viewer is made to create inferences that reflect their own biases to understand a piece; and that in itself becomes a form of creative reflection. When the meaning of the art is left to the audience to decipher, a form of creative license is granted: one which represents the unique perspectives of each spectator, with all their inner inclinations and natural correlations that may not have been exercised otherwise. Park, as the curator of these artforms, creates a pure focus on the art and forces the viewer to look within their own mind and discover parts of themselves in each piece, a hidden birthmark on this skin of ours.

Published on Feb. 20, 2018, All the Names They Used for God by Anjali Sachdeva offers a refreshing take on the nature of the human mind, while also exploring the role of divinity in modern life. The book encompasses a collection of short stories ranging from love triangles to futuristic dystopias, and even a piece of speculative fiction centered around the 2014 Nigerian schoolgirls kidnapping, upon which the title is based.
Last Tuesday, Sachdeva paid a visit to Carnegie Mellon for a riveting reading and rapturous discussion. To begin the evening, she read aloud “Robert Greenman and the Mermaid,” one of the short stories entailing a romance between a fisherman and mermaid, that L.A. Review of Books believed “will remind some of Guillermo del Toro’s recent Oscar-winning film The Shape of Water.” Without a doubt, Sachdeva was just as good a storyteller in person as she is on paper.
When asked about creating “Robert Greenman and the Mermaid,” Sachdeva traces the story back to an idea she had about creating a simple love triangle between a human, a mermaid, and a shark. Sachdeva’s slice of advice? Love triangles are always the perfect source of literary tension.
As the evening went on, Sachdeva talked about some of the other components of her writing process for All the Names They Used for God including her rather unconventional method of turning to children’s books to research sharks. With a light chuckle, she claimed that they were filled with “digestible, pure information.” In addition, she emphasized an implication of characterization, using indirect between-the-lines hints to create multi-dimensional characters and worlds in a short story. According to her, “you can imply that a character has a dark past with one sentence.”
While many of Sachdeva’s short stories take place in worlds rather dissimilar to today’s world, Sachdeva certainly admitted that part of creating All the Names They Used for God was the real-life timeline of over 14 years that it took to create her book from its initial writing stages to its eventual publishing. She advises writers to incorporate a lot of resting time, even “allowing yourself to ‘forget’ what you’ve written so you can come back with a fresh eye”, and that she prefers to “write without a fixed ending” in order to open up possibilities.
Sachdeva’s final piece of advice was that “it’s really the decision to keep doing it. [...] You can say to yourself ‘just one more short story’,” crediting persistence as one of the important factors about being a writer. Also, she expressed gratitude to her publishers, who made sure she had a voice and active role every step of the way.
All the Names that They Used for God has received acclaim from Publisher’s Weekly, a Chautauqua Prize (a literary award based on the New York education center of the same name) and a nomination as one of 2018’s “Best Books of the Year” by NPR.

This past Friday, I got to live my best high school life at the PPG Paints Arena. Not only did I get to see The Chainsmokers; I got to see the band that I obsessed over since their YouTube cover days or, as the 5 Seconds of Summer (5SOS) fandom used to call, “fetus 5SOS”. This was a collaboration of artists that most wouldn’t have imagined even two years ago, but the mix of these artists in one concert actually worked.
I had never listened to Lennon Stella until she collaborated with The Chainsmokers in their track “Takeaway.” I added the song to my monthly favorites playlists on Spotify, but I never got around to checking out her music. After hearing her open the concert, I was starting to question why I hadn’t probed further. I would’ve probably been equally blown away if I had actively listened to her beforehand. Her voice almost matched the recording and filled the room with a power that no studio can ever quite capture.
5SOS exceeded my expectations and succeeded to unleash the high school fangirl I tried to suppress since graduating. They kicked off their act with the track that put them on the map: “She Looks So Perfect.” Although they incorporated another track from their debut title album (“Amnesia” had every longtime fan swooning), their performance demonstrated their growth as a band. Traces of their boy band roots remained, but the boys demonstrated maturity and experimentation in their newer releases. Their tracklist represented their sappy pop-punk origins in their eponymous 5 Seconds of Summer to their emo Sounds Good Feels Good to their modern alternative-inspired Youngblood.
The Chainsmokers came next and were absolutely insane. They went above and beyond with their props and stunts. Of course, they used the fun yet cliché EDM flashy lights and graphics. Drew Taggart, the vocalist and primary songwriter, was bouncing around the stage. His performance matched the concert’s energy and didn’t permit a dull moment. Alex Pall mixed the beats and kept the audience on its toes with unexpected twists on old favorites. Drummer Matt McGuire nailed the set and captivated the audience when he hammered away at the drums with his drumsticks engulfed in flames.
The choice to include the other artists in the tour was pretty expected, given The Chainsmokers’ recent collaborations. However, that didn’t make the other artists’ entrances in the middle of The Chainsmokers’ set any less exciting. In the middle of the show, Taggart got his acoustic guitar and called for his “favorite part” of the show. 5 Seconds of Summer came back on stage to perform “Who Do You Love,” their collaboration. Lennon also came back on the set to perform “Takeaway.”
You would think that EDM would sound the same performed live as it does when it’s played on your phone. However, there’s something different about the two experiences. There’s something about hearing the music blared while dancing without judgment from others (who, chances are, are dancing just as badly as you are). This concert was a splurge, but it’s definitely something I would do all over again.

In between the brick academic halls and green lawns of Carnegie Mellon University’s campus is a fence. It is widely known as “The Fence,” and nearly every day it is covered in a new layer of paint. The Fence has been painted hundreds of times.
The Fence functions as a campus-wide message board. Student organizations paint the fence to celebrate victories, advertise events and, sometimes, to commemorate tragedies. Rarely does it get political.
CSA paints the fence
On Sunday, Oct. 6, Carnegie Mellon’s Chinese Student Association (CSA) painted the fence red to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the formation of the People’s Republic of China by the Communist Party of China (CPC). Oct. 1 was National Day, a holiday celebrating China’s history.
“October 1st means the same to us all Chinese students, the same as July 4th means to people in the US,” said Yifei Yang, the President of the CSA.
On Monday, students were greeted with a fence coated in red paint. “HAPPY BIRTHDAY CHINA,” was painted on the center of one side and the yellow stars of China’s flag on the other.
Many Chinese students were pleasantly surprised. Jiaqi Pan, a masters student in the Language Technologies Institute, said that she “never expected this could be here, so prominently on campus.” She called the painting “creative” and “cool,” and translated some of the Mandarin text painted on the fence to “Why are there tears in my eyes? Because I love the land so deeply.” It was the refrain of a poem by the famous Chinese poet Ai Qing.
One student asked a passerby to take a picture of her in front of the poem, and he then asked her to do the same. She said that the painting made her feel “proud.” She identified herself as a grad student but did not wish to share her name.
But not all students felt so warmly about the CSA’s painted fence. Cuneyd Taoglu, a sophomore studying mechanical engineering was walking across campus to an event for the Muslim Student Association (MSA) when he saw the fence. He was shocked.
“I was just shocked to see how we allow the glorification of an authoritarian regime,” said Taoglu.
Aidan Place, another board member of MSA, said that he was “disappointed to see” the fence commemorating a country that is “in my opinion, and I think most people’s opinion, actively carrying the destruction of a cultural ethnic group.”
Place and Taoglu were referring to the Uighurs, a Muslim ethnic group, who live in have reportedly been detained in “re-education camps” by the Chinese government.
Taoglu’s family is Turkish. He said that he has a particular concern for the Uighurs “because they were the first Turk people to mass convert to Islam, and they’re the reason why I’m Muslim today.”
MSA and HKSA paint the fence
There are rules to painting the fence. It can only be painted between the hours of 12 a.m. and 6 a.m., only with paint bushes (no spray cans or rollers) and only in its entirety (no graffiti).
To claim the fence, an organization needs to have two people stationed next to the fence at all hours. They need to do the same every night if they don’t want another organization to take the fence.
Taoglu and Place saw that the fence was unguarded and immediately had the idea to paint it in response. They got in touch with the Hong Kong Student Association (HKSA) and made plans in conjunction that night.
By 10 p.m. a large group of HKSA and MSA students had gathered at the fence. They sat in lawn chairs and on picnic tables, ate Voccelli’s pizza, and drank Turkish coffee in plastic solo cups.
At around 10:30 p.m., according to several members of MSA, police officers went to the fence and notified them that someone had anonymously called the Carnegie Mellon police to notify them that something was going to happen at 12:00 a.m.
Students said that they weren’t worried that anything would happen, because they had such a large group. There were 36 students present. But for safe measure, two Carnegie Mellon police officers returned at midnight.
Students dipped their paint brushes into cans of sky blue and black paint and got to work. Others held out their phones as flashlights.
When the sun rose on Tuesday, half the Fence was painted in blue and the other half in black. Star and crescent crests and the flower emblem of Hong Kong were painted on the posts. “DON’T FORGET ABOUT US,” was painted at the center. The other side read “STAY STRONG HONG KONG.”
Taoglu explained that MSA painted the fence as a response to the “the atrocities that the Chinese government is perpetrating.” “It’s not directed at CSA,” added Place.
The HKSA later clarified in a Facebook post that they “painted [The Fence] in hopes that CMU would become more aware of our political unrest in Hong Kong.”
Students from the MSA and HKSA staked out the fence in lawn chairs all day. Mansour Elsharawy, another MSA board member, said that the response they received was generally positive. “People have been coming and saying like, ‘this is great, thank you’,” Elsharawy said.
Later that day, Place posted on Overlooked CMU, a Facebook page dedicated to the discussion of social issues, about pushback that the MSA had received.
Place wrote “I personally have been subjected to online abuse and threats after people linked me to the painting. Most recently, this morning a student came up to the fence to warn me to be careful and safe, saying people on WeChat were threatening me.”
Hundreds of students showed their support. 429 people reacted to the post on Facebook, 100 of whom used sad emojis. In the comment section students went back and forth over a range of topics, including the CPC’s reported actions.
On Wednesday night, the MSA and HKSA held “S’mores and Dialogue at the Fence” event to continue the campus dialogue. “There were some really good, peaceful discussions,” said masters engineering student Ansh Nasta in a comment on Overlooked CMU.
The next night, The Originals, a Carnegie Mellon a cappella group, painted the fence to advertise a joint concert.
Highest Priority*
By the end of the week, all of the students originations involved came together to emphasize that respecting one another was the highest priority.
The president of the CSA, Yifei Yang, told The Tartan that “Our fence has no intention to be political, and we do not want any difference in opinions and perspectives raise unintentional conflicts in our CMU community.”
On Thursday, Thomas Wong, senior in Physics and Mathematical Sciences, posted a statement on Overlooked on behalf of HKSA. The HKSA decried “the cyberbullying and threats to MSA members” as “failures on everyone’s part to uphold the core values of this community.” They also said that “CMU is a collaborative community, but none of that works if we do not treat each other with fundamental empathy and respect that we deserve as human beings.”
On Friday MSA, HKSA and CSA posted a joint statement on Overlooked addressing the tension. “We acknowledge that a difference of opinions, beliefs and opinions, is inevitable given the diversity of CMU’s student population and originations.” It continued, “however, we believe that this does not warrant or justify any form of threats to anyone’s safety and wellbeing.”
They concluded that “differing political opinions should never give way to any extreme action that would intimidate or target any individuals or organizations on the premise of race, ethnicity, nationality, religion or country of origin.”

Jose Diaz, program director at local nonprofit Hope For All and a University of Pittsburgh graduate, came to campus Thursday for a talk hosted by the student organization CMU in Puerto Rico. In the talk, Diaz gave a perspective of a Puerto Rican living in the diaspora — significant because there are more Puerto Ricans living outside Puerto Rico than on the island itself —and educated the audience on the history of Puerto Rico up to modern times.
Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, before moving to Pittsburgh at age 18, Diaz is considered a “Nuyorican,” a term for Puerto Ricans living in New York City. However, he prefers to identify as Boricua, derived from Boriken, the original name of Puerto Rico before it was colonized by Spain.
Coming from New York City, a place with a large Puerto Rican community, Diaz felt that his Puerto Rican identity had been somehow “taken” from him when he moved to Pittsburgh. He says that he saw Pittsburgh as a very racially binary city — you are either labeled as white or black, with little in between. Years later, Diaz was angered when he saw President Trump criticizing Puerto Ricans as lazy. He felt compelled to read up on the island’s history and post about it on his social media to show the world Puerto Rico’s true colors, attracting attention from people who said they had never heard of the things he posted. Today, because of that, he no longer has a sense of his identity being “robbed” from him.
His personal roots correspond to a larger theme in his talk — the history of the island and the cultural disconnection that results from living in different places. Before the Spanish arrived in the Americas, Puerto Rico was inhabited by the Taino people. The Spanish controlled Puerto Rico as a colony for about four centuries, until the United States, seeking to expand its own interests in the Caribbean, offered to purchase the island from Spain. Spain refused, so the U.S. invaded Puerto Rico in 1898, forcing Spain to cede control of it to the U.S. under the Treaty of Paris in 1899.
Puerto Rico has been a commonwealth of the U.S. ever since — its residents are U.S. citizens and have been since 1917, but they cannot vote in general elections and do not share in all of the same benefits that U.S. states have.
Diaz also discussed what was known as Operation Bootstrap, a series of U.S. government projects to transform Puerto Rico’s economy, which had until then been mostly agricultural, to a manufacturing one, using measures like tax incentives. He then pivoted to another dimension of U.S. and Puerto Rican history: “La Operacion.” These were the drastic measures the U.S. took because it was concerned about overpopulation in Puerto Rico. Besides steps like encouraging people to move to the cities, the most drastic was the forced sterilization of Puerto Rican women, most of whom were not told that they would no longer be able to bear children. While the stated motivations were general population control and the need for more women in the workforce, Diaz mused about the unstated motivations behind the forced sterilization. Perhaps, rather than just general population control, it was meant as a way to curb the population of people of color and “whiten” the population, as white was automatically considered the aesthetic norm.
After Puerto Ricans were granted U.S. citizenship, many started moving to the U.S. mainland, mostly to the eastern and southern U.S., and primarily to New York City. Diaz says this resulted in a culture war between Puerto Ricans living in the mainland, who still considered themselves Puerto Ricans and were labeled as clearly Puerto Rican by other Americans, and Puerto Ricans on the island, who saw clear differences between themselves and people who had never lived on the island or had left long ago.
Another historical episode Diaz described was the decades-long use of Vieques, an island off of Puerto Rico, as a U.S. military testing ground. The damage to Vieques was so great that some areas in the eastern part of the island have more craters per area than the moon. The military finally left the island in 2003, after massive protests from the Puerto Rican people.
Today, nearly half of the island’s population lives in poverty. A debt crisis led to the creation of the unelected fiscal control board PROMESA, formed with no input from Puerto Ricans. The board is highly unpopular in Puerto Rico, Diaz said, as some Puerto Ricans feel that it is just another symbol of their lack of control.
Diaz detailed how Hurricane Maria traumatized the island in 2017, worsening the existing problems on the island. The University of Puerto Rico did a mental health survey before the hurricane and found that about seven percent of Puerto Ricans suffered from serious mental health problems, a rate already higher than the national average. Post-hurricane, suicide rates on the island spiked. Even more Puerto Ricans left the island, adding the trauma of moving to an unfamiliar place to the trauma of the hurricane itself. With government aid often slow to arrive, the diaspora and the islanders came together to support their physical and ancestral home, Diaz said.
This summer, hundreds of pages of private chats between the then-governor of Puerto Rico, Ricardo Rossello, and his associates were leaked, showing them mocking and insulting their fellow Puerto Ricans in vulgar terms. Many Puerto Ricans were furious, and demanded Rossello’s resignation, which happened several days later. Diaz pointed out that there were more subtle symbols of resistance as well, in addition to protests in the streets. These included using a higher unofficial death toll from Hurricane Maria rather than the government’s official numbers, indicating a lack of trust in the government, and the waving of both a black and white version of the Puerto Rican flag, created originally to protest PROMESA, and a version with a lighter blue, symbolizing resistance and independence, respectively.
Diaz is personally pro-independence, but more than anything, he wants islanders to have more control over their destiny, whether that means statehood, independence, or something else.

Carnegie Mellon’s new initiative, Humanities@CMU, is focused on creating a distinct brand for its humanities institutions. Key goals of the initiative are strengthening the humanities in terms of education, research, and student communities, as well as improving marketing and internship opportunities.
“In many ways, you, the students, inspired this approach. Dean Scheines and I were moved by Emma Flickinger’s piece in the Tartan last Spring, and we had followed a series of other articles the Tartan had done on the Humanities at CMU,” said Andreea Ritivoi, English Department head and leader of the upcoming Humanities@CMU Initiative.
Flickinger’s op-ed on the status of the humanities at Carnegie Mellon, published in Nov. 2018, discussed how she felt the humanities were undervalued in several aspects: campus culture, career recruitment, interdisciplinary work, and branding. Her article helped catalyze a town hall focused on the state of the humanities. A follow-up town hall is to be expected in the near future to introduce Humanities@CMU and gather input.
Ritivoi will be leading the initiative, alongside a steering committee comprised of faculty and students spanning humanities and non-humanities departments. The committee, yet to be formed, will be comprised of people within the humanities and those adjacent to them.
Explaining Humanities@CMU’s plan of action, Ritivoi told The Tartan in an emailed interview that the initiative would start with student input. This semester, Ritivoi and Dean Scheines will be hosting lunches with students to discuss prospective common spaces for humanities students and community building efforts.
The initiative also intends to create support for humanities-centric internships, building off of the Pittsburgh Summer Internship Program. In its second year, that program helped connect 48 Dietrich College students with internships at 34 organizations throughout the region. Ritivoi told us that Humanities@CMU’s current goal is to support 60 student internships.
Humanities@CMU also intends to expand the humanities by designing and launching undergraduate programs grounded in the humanities disciplines that are also flexible and broadly attractive for students in other fields. “Health, as an area, is going to be one of the first places where we look to build an interesting minor that is grounded in the humanities,” Ritivoi mentioned.
“Our plan is to bring more humanities-grounded programs to our other colleges and to draw those students into them. I know from experience, as a teacher, that once students from other colleges take our humanities courses, they are often hooked and acquire a deep respect for the humanities, sometimes adding a major or a minor in a humanities field.”
Ritivoi added, “It’s important to point out that the humanities have always been deeply interdisciplinary, on their own terms, and that throughout the long history of the humanities certain questions that were raised had what we would now consider a scientific question. For example, natural philosophy in the 17th century (and before then) had a very strong interest in what are now issues studied by physicists, astronomers, and mathematicians.”
“The humanities always point to what the actual impact on the human condition is, be it from an ethical perspective, a cultural one, or an aesthetic one. Our hope is to continue to support the already existing interdisciplinary conversation around the humanities at CMU, but also to systematically point out exactly what role the humanities play, and how key it is,” said Ritivoi.
Under the initiative, humanities programs are going to be reviewed to figure out the present strengths, as well as any additional support they could use. “We are looking to generate new ideas that will update existing programs for the intellectual sensibility of a new generation and the problems of our time,” Ritivoi said.
What’s unique about Carnegie Mellon’s humanities approach, according to Ritivoi, is the emphasis on world issues. Carnegie Mellon tackles issues like climate change, gender studies, technological ethics, racism, and globalization — all of which require a humanities lens, she said.
In the future, the initiative may bring new seminars, co-taught by groups of humanities professors in different disciplines. New professionalization workshops and research and writing groups may well be on their way too.
“While CMU is known for its STEM programs, I see that as a provocation not a problem, and I have always been inspired and motivated by the successes of our colleagues in CIT or SCS. We hope that the launch of Humanities@CMU will help us to strengthen our reputation among top universities with strong humanities programs,” Ritivoi stated.
“The uniqueness of CMU, for me as a humanist, is that an environment so powerful in technology and science has a culture of respect for high-stakes research and intellectual precision. I like that a lot.”

Since the 1990s, Carnegie Mellon’s family weekend has been an amalgamation of events, activities, performances, and sports matches, allowing families to experience a wide range of campus experiences. This year’s festivities proved no different.
Lauryn Patt, a sophomore in Dietrich College, attended a few of these events along with her family. “We went to the [Miller ICA] art gallery opening. It was neat,” said Patt’s mother. “Later in the day, we’re going to the football game.” When asked if they were enjoying the events so far, Patt’s father responded for everyone: “Yeah.”
Diane Eshelman, Assistant Director for First-Year Orientation and Family Engagement, told The Tartan in an email that this year’s family weekend had a few new twists. First, she said, “in an effort to be sustainable, we have moved away from printing paper schedules and have moved the schedule to the CMU Events app,” which has previously been used for events like orientation and commencement.
A photo booth was also added in the Cohon Center “where families can take photos with their students and show off their CMU pride,” Eshelman noted. Three new faculty talks were held over the weekend, Associate Professor Po-Shen Loh’s “Memorization, or Not?,” CyLab Director Dr. Lorie Cranor’s “Security and Privacy for Humans,” and Carnegie Bosch Professor of Business Param Vir Singh’s “Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Blockchain (CMU-Coin) at Tepper.” 
This year, Eshelman said, 1,500 families pre-registered, with more registering during the weekend. 
Eshelman says that families have reported to the Office of Parent & Family Engagement that they enjoy the variety of events offered. Over 60 events occurred this weekend, including the 16th Annual Chili Cook-Off complete with a free chili mug, a Carnegie Mellon football game, an a cappella concert called Vertigo, and several academic lectures. She says, however, that “most of all, our families enjoy spending quality time catching up with their student.”
Attendees tend to agree. Riley Knavish, a sophomore in Dietrich College, was excited to see her family. Her sister was equally excited, saying “it’s cool that Carnegie Mellon does this. There’s a lot of free stuff.” Even though they’re just an hour away in Mt. Lebanon, Knavish’s parents would never give up an opportunity to see her.

Over the past 40 years, the number of non-tenure track faculty has grown from 25 percent of the professorial labor force at institutions of higher education to a little over 75 percent. The absolute numbers of adjunct faculty show an even more drastic growth, as the last 40 years have also seen an increase in the number of students attending post-secondary schools. Now, around 700,000 faculty members are part-time, non-tenure track faculty, with another 600,000 faculty taking full-time non-tenure track positions. This means that 1.3 million of 1.8 million higher education faculty do not have access to the same benefits as their often equally educated counterparts on the tenure track.
Benefits provided by tenured, or even just tenure-track, contracts include an income better adjusted to increasing costs of living, consistent health and retirement benefits, job security, and academic freedom. Non-tenure track professors see little of these benefits. Their pay increases more slowly. They often have no health or retirement benefits. Most of the time, adjuncts are not aware of whether their current class will be taught the following semester, and non-tenure track faculty are always at the mercy of administrative politics. 
The phenomenon of adjunctification is widespread across higher education and it’s dangerously apparent, especially at Carnegie Mellon. After an interview with an adjunct in the English department, a few things were clear. Adjunct professors choose to teach a class because they love the idea of teaching, not because it pays well. Adjuncts at Carnegie Mellon, while paid more than other adjuncts in the Pittsburgh area, are not paid well. The adjunct from the English department sees their income as supplemental. Because of the part-time nature of their work, adjuncts are not given health or retirement benefits. And in spite of years of experience as an adjunct — as much as 10 to 15 years or more — adjuncts receive a relatively flat rate of pay per class. 
Beyond the personal economy, adjuncts at Carnegie Mellon tend to have little say in the future development of their department. These part-time educators are forced to deal with the economic and personal political whims of departments and administrations that can fire an adjunct professor at will, so the liberal arts ideal of a wide educational experience can be eliminated by a strong-willed department chair or the vagaries of administrative economics. A lack of influence in the future of the department decreases job security, thereby decreasing the economic security of adjuncts.
No matter where you go, adjunct professors are making up an increasing amount of the teaching faculty, and their economic insecurity and lack of academic freedom are both dangerous to the proper functioning of educational institutions. There are no protections for the majority of the educational labor force. An administration, a department, or a single person with power in either of those institutions could take advantage of an adjunct professor in a way that harms not only the economic standing of an adjunct but the educational value provided to students. As students who want the best value from our education, is it not our responsibility to fight for adjunct professors?
But the issue doesn’t just stop at adjuncts. Carnegie Mellon is an R1 research institution, and R1 institutions have seen a smaller increase in adjuncts than other post-secondary schools, like community colleges. At schools like Carnegie Mellon, the actual labor of teaching has been moved down the educational ladder to graduate students, and in some cases, even undergraduate students. 
In many departments, recitations for introductory classes are taught by grad students. In the English department, a significant number of Interpretation and Argument sections are taught by graduate students. On the other side of campus, there are undergraduate students teaching recitations in the Computer Science department. This is a symptom of departments and administration not spending as much money on the reason we are attending an institution of higher education: instruction and education. They’re dependent on students, who pay to attend the institution, to provide educational labor. For grad students, their research is supposed to pay for their cost of attendance, not their educational labor. Not only is it hard being an adjunct professor providing educational labor, but it’s also hard being a grad student. And an undergrad.
A doctoral candidate in computer science wrote to The Tartan describing their experience in attaining value for their labor. They expressed that Carnegie Mellon has removed the laborers from being able to decide their value. Not only have doctoral candidates been limited in their power over the future of a department, professors and researchers working with doctoral candidates usually don’t have the power to assign a value to instructional labor. The compensation for a computer science graduate student is generally enough to scrape by during their time here, but it can be harder for students who don’t receive the generous stipend that computer science students receive. I don’t believe it would be too much of a stretch to suggest that grad students and adjuncts exist on the same plane, with their economic security dependent on administration. However, there are a few important differences between adjuncts and grad students; namely, adjuncts tend to have the terminal degree in their field, while grad students are working towards it. Grad students are suggested potential value from their degree, but potential value is not adequate compensation, considering the recent intake of grads to the adjunct pipeline. 
Undergraduate teaching assistants receive even less immediate compensation for the promise of future value. Currently, a computer science undergraduate teaching assistant makes around 12 dollars an hour for teaching recitations, holding office hours, grading assignments, and creating assignments. In other words, doing the valuable work of an instructional laborer. It’s not hard to say that undergrad TA’s are not adequately compensated for the work they’re providing to the computer science department.
All of these issues revolve around administration cutting down the budget for instruction, as other administrative costs have continued to rise. To pay for these administrative costs, educational labor is devalued. This makes a student’s value in their education decrease, and administrations continue to do it. But at what cost? In 2013, Margaret Mary Vojtko, an 83-year-old adjunct professor at Duquesne University passed away from a heart attack. At the time, she was getting radiation therapy for cancer, her house was falling in on itself, and Adult Protective Services were called to open a case into her situation. She couldn’t afford anything on her wage as an adjunct. In April of this year, Thea Hunter, a 63-year-old adjunct in New York City, passed away. After not seeing a doctor due to a lack of health care and a lack of economic ability, Thea Hunter was rushed to the hospital, where she died a short time later. The lack of support for adjunct faculty can cost lives. It is Carnegie Mellon's responsibility to set the precedent for fair compensation for all faculty and staff.

When most people think of politics, they think about Congress and the President, instead of the nine individuals that sit on the Supreme Court. Members of Congress and Presidents can lose reelection, but justices on the Supreme Court serve a lifetime. During the Kavanaugh hearing, many Americans saw him unfit to serve on the nation’s highest court given his history of sexual assault and his poor temperament. Kavanaugh replaced Justice Kennedy, who was often considered the swing vote. With both Trump’s appointees, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court has taken a major step to the right. The SCOTUS 2019-2020 docket could have huge implications for many Americans.
This year, the conservative court will hear several cases, including significant LBGTQ civil rights cases, a Louisiana abortion case, and a case regarding the Second Amendment. Last Tuesday, the court heard Bostock v. Clayton County, GA, Altitude Express, Inc. v. Zarda, and R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes, Inc. v. EEOC. The first two cases,  Bostock and Altitude Express, were consolidated and argued together, and will determine whether or not Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits employment discrimination and protects against discrimination based on an individual’s sexual orientation. The second case heard last Tuesday, R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes, Inc. v. EEOC, will decide whether or not Title VII protects against employment discrimination of individuals who identify as transgender. 
With the conservative court, it is difficult to predict what they will decide on these two cases, but they should know that if they rule that sexual orientation and transgender status do not encompass Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, there will be significant social pushback. If they rule that these protections do not count for the LBGTQ community, they are effectively saying that those in the LGBTQ community are second-class citizens because they do not have civil rights protections. On Tuesday, hundreds of protesters, including transgender actress Laverne Cox, gathered outside the court to advocate to extend Title VII protections to the LGBTQ community.
Earlier this month, the Supreme Court also agreed to take on an abortion case that could shrink a menman’s ability to receive an abortion from her doctor. The case, June Medical Services LLC v. Gee, will decide whether states can prohibit doctors from performing abortions unless they have admitting privileges at local hospitals. The court heard an identical challenge to abortion three years ago in Whole Women’s Health v. Hellerstedt, which declared a Texas version of this challenge unconstitutional. Despite the court’s clear ruling in Women’s Health v. Hellerstedt, this restrictive law was pushed through in Louisiana and was upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. If the Supreme Court votes to uphold this law and overturn precedent — they have been willing to shirk precedent before — they will make it much harder for a woman to get an abortion in the United States. What the five conservative male justices need to understand is that if they uphold this law, many women may be forced to seek out dangerous abortion methods.
The fourth significant case the court will hear in this term is the New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. City of New York. This is the first major Second Amendment case that the court will hear in nearly a decade. It will determine whether New York City’s ban on transporting a licensed, locked, and unloaded handgun to a home or shooting range outside the city limits is consistent with the Second Amendment. With the conservative majority currently sitting on the bench, it is likely that the court will significantly expand the scope of the Second Amendment, even in the midst of growing advocacy for gun control. 
The three branches of government are coequal, and if the Supreme Court rules against popular opinion, the legislature can pass laws that will protect individuals against their rulings. However, it is unlikely for this to be possible if the Senate continues to be controlled by Mitch McConnell and the Republican Party. Decisions coming out of the Supreme Court are important and the Republicans will want most of this country to look away when the conservative court decides most of its cases, so the best thing people can do is protest and acknowledge that they know what is at stake.

There are a few types of people in this world. First, there are those who think Edward Snowden is a traitor and were anticipating his new memoir, Permanent Record, to tear him further to pieces. Second, there are those who think Snowden is a hero and were anticipating his memoir to get a deeper insight into the man. Third, there are those who just forgot that he existed until the memoir came out (which is likely a lot of people). I happen to fall within the second group.
To be very upfront, this isn’t a review of the memoir. However, I have been following Snowden very closely since 2013. In those years, I read every article and interview, watched every documentary I could find, and the memoir is a culmination of all that. Beyond just being a surprisingly well-spoken and charismatic figure, he is also very cognizant of what he has done and is an expert on the internet and the government’s surveillance capabilities. For example, when the FBI wanted Apple to create a backdoor into the San Bernardino shooter’s locked phone, a request that Apple denied, Snowden called their bluff and said that the FBI could already do so and would crack it within a few weeks. Sure enough, the FBI did just fine without Apple’s backdoor. 
Now there is a lot to be said about Snowden himself and whether or not he has spilled secrets to the Russian government. There is really no reason to believe he did. His memoir touches upon his ideology too, especially why he did what he did. The vast majority of people wouldn’t have even considered the dilemma he was in, and it’s very likely many wouldn’t blow the whistle on the government. He was cognizant of the fact that he was about to destroy his life, and that he could easily just join the rest of the surveillance community with their nonchalant attitude. He makes it clear that he has exercised a lot of discretion and caution. Also, what other option did Snowden have? No one else wanted to touch the issue of his asylum with a fifty-foot pole. 
However, the memoir, rightfully, doesn’t focus the discussion on whether or not he betrayed the country. Rather, it’s about what kind of country we want to be. Do we want to be a country that sacrifices values in the name of security? There are two big cynical arguments that I have heard: 1) security is needed for stability and we should achieve that by any means necessary, and 2) we never had values in the first place and it’s useless to care about that. 
For the former of those cynical arguments, that is overtly authoritarian. After 9/11, Americans gave the government carte blanche to do as they pleased so long as the government can keep terrorists at bay. But what good has it done? There hasn’t been any evidence of the programs actually helping. We let the government violate our rights for nothing. Even if it did amount to something, that still shouldn’t justify sacrificing our rights and privacy. Security can be achieved in other ways, that aren't reactionary moves motivated by fear. We can’t preach being the country of freedom and democracy and then do things that violate that. 
In response to the second cynical argument, is it wrong to have some level of standards in the first place, even if they are low? We joke about the NSA listening to our conversations, but the capabilities of mass surveillance are terrifying. If you send an email or make a phone call, there are stacks of computers capable of bouncing your data around to different places, tracking your location, tracing who you’re talking to, what you’re talking about, how long you talked about it, and they can remotely access your device. That's just scratching the surface. Our government spies on everyone, even organizations like UNICEF. Standards and values matter, even if they are all talk and no action. It only takes another 9/11 for the government to justify expanding upon their current capabilities, and not caring about values gives passive permission to that. 
The surveillance state has had a few blows here and there. The Supreme Court threw out the precedent that buying a phone or computer means you’re giving up your privacy, and warrants are now required to access cell-site information, which is the information about a call or text without the actual contents of it. But there is a very long way to go. We, as the public, should hold the government accountable for this. It’s an issue that has been glossed over, and Snowden’s efforts shouldn’t be in vain. It’s a very complicated topic to understand, but he has done all he can to relay the information responsibly and in a way that people can understand. 
So do yourselves a favor and go read his memoir.

The shift from “Columbus Day” to “Indigenous Peoples Day” is not new. California proposed this change in 1939, and officially implemented it in 1998. Today, eight states have officially adopted Indigenous Peoples Day in lieu of Columbus Day. Although we are far from fully addressing the atrocities Native Americans historically faced and how they are still affected by policies today, changing the focus of the holiday is a significant start in initiating the dialogue around justice for the Native American population in the States.
"For us to celebrate a man who’s done these horrible atrocities against indigenous people, to me, it’s a slap in the face... It’s wrong to spread false narratives of what actually happened. We have to start telling the truth, even in our schools," activist Anthony Tamez-Pochel told USA Today. Tamez-Pochel, who is Cree, Lakota, and Black, is leading the initiative to change Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples Day in Chicago. Currently, he is co-president of the Chi-Nations Youth Council, an organization that supports indigenous youth.
I understand the appeal of making our school curriculum more palatable by sugarcoating history and censoring literature that challenges us outside our comfort zones. It’s difficult and embarrassing to address the faults of one’s own history. However, it’s just as imperative that we teach our students accurate representations of history so that they can better understand how past actions affect contemporary issues. By teaching our youth to skirt around topics that may be uncomfortable, we are allowing the repercussions of our past to manifest into our present.
In this past midterm election, North Dakota’s voter suppression laws disproportionately affected Native American voters from voting. By requiring voters to have a residential address, those who lived on reservations found themselves suddenly not eligible to vote. Native American voter turnout remains to be significantly lower than other racial groups lower than other racial groups. With the 2020 presidential election looming over us, it’s even more pressing that we ensure that an already marginalized demographic get the opportunity to be at least somewhat represented.
Nobody sane will argue that changing “Columbus Day” to “Indigenous Peoples Day” will undo generations worth of oppression. However, it has the potential to start a conversation on the ongoing consequences of the actions that Columbus contributed to. In order to begin fixing a problem, we must be able to address the problem. Dedicating a day to an affected minority rather than one of the most iconic suppressors is a start.
