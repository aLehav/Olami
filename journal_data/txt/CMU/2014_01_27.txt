Both the men’s and the women’s basketball teams lost to the University of Chicago in two very different games.
The women’s basketball team had a hard time holding the floor against the University of Chicago Maroons, who took the lead five minutes in and never surrendered it. The Tartans had a tough time executing on offense, and only made 36 percent of their shots as opposed to their season average of 44 percent. After jumping out to a 5–2 lead, Carnegie Mellon surrendered three layups and a three pointer in a 9–2 run, and that was the final lead of the night. Excellent free-throw shooting from Chicago contributed to a first half that the Tartans  could not recover from. By the break, the Maroons led 47–29. The second half went better, but it was not enough to mount a comeback against Chicago. 
The win came in spite of continued stellar play from first-year forward, Lisa Murphy. She put up 22 points while shooting very well from the free throw line (10–13) and hounded both the offensive and defensive glass, finishing with 14 rebounds. Junior guard Gabrielle West also had a great second half after a shaky first half. She scored 12 points, all from distance, in the second half alone. They were two bright spots in what turned into a brutal, 88–69 loss, continuing the team’s up-and-down performance in conference play.
The men’s basketball team was more successful, but ultimately did not fare better after taking a 65–64 loss in a nail biter. 
A rough start in which Carnegie Mellon shot 1–10 from the floor allowed Chicago to get off to a 14–3 lead as the game began, but that was the first in what seemed like an endless series of runs.
The teams traded runs until, by the break, the Maroons had jumped out to a 37–31 advantage. The second half was similar. Runs of 9–2 and 8–0 eventually put the Tartans ahead of the Maroons 54–53 for their first lead of the night with just over seven minutes remaining.
The lead was extended to five and, with four minutes left, the Tartans had their largest lead of the night. The lead held until the Maroon’s junior guard Royce Muskeyvalley hit a dagger to give the Maroons the 65–64 advantage with 1.4 seconds remaining. Senior guard Rashaun Riley’s answer was just too long and the Tartans came away with a loss.
Senior guard Christian Manoli hit the turnaround jumper to give Carnegie Mellon its first lead of the night and continued his shooting streak, scoring 23 points and leading the charge for a Carnegie Mellon team that very nearly came away with a conference win. 
On Sunday evening, the teams took the court at home against the Washington University Bears. Both teams suffered losses. 
The women’s team lost 71–63 to the Bears, who are currently the number two team in their section, and the men’s team lost 94–81 to the eighth ranked men’s team.
Both teams have had a tough time in conference play and look to right the ship next Friday when they host the New York University men’s and women’s teams at 8 p.m.

The Major League Baseball (MLB) organization has a lesson to relearn. As MLB commissioner Bud Selig goes on a farewell tour to congratulate himself as the man who wiped performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) from the world of baseball, the MLB is covered in the blood of New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez’s (A-Rod) baseball legacy, a mark that, years from now, will still look more sinister than any other PED scandal.
By now, the decision is well-known. Rodriguez will be suspended for 162 games and any potential playoff games. It is the longest PED suspension in baseball history, extending almost 60 games longer than the 105-game suspension handed to former Kansas City Royals infielder Miguel Tejada for amphetamine use in 2013.
The only real surprise, however, was that A-Rod did not receive the full 211-game sentence he was initially given. Selig found his last scapegoat for PEDs in Rodriguez and was above nothing in trying to nail down a massive suspension.
The years 2012 and 2013 were embarrassing for baseball’s fight against PEDs. After Milwaukee Brewer right fielder Ryan Braun was one of the first players caught by the MLB’s testing system, the positive test was scrapped when it was found there was a sample collection mistake in arbitration. 
As the testing program once again proved to be ineffective, the MLB expanded its suspension policy beyond merely failing a drug test, to requiring proof that a player took PEDs. This plan has led to the MLB finding exactly zero players using PEDs.
Uncovering the recent Biogenesis scandal, in which several MLB athletes received PEDs from Florida anti-aging clinic Biogenesis of America, was not the genius work of the MLB. A former employee of the Biogenesis clinic released information to the media about the PED abuse. 
The names of the players were released, and this proof led to 50-game suspensions for all involved with two exceptions. Braun took a 65-game suspension that had a lot to do with his first failed test, and then there was A-Rod, who promised to take this fight to arbitration and beyond. A-Rod has already admitted to using PEDs once in his career, but that was in the early 2000s and he was not suspended then. The listing of A-Rod in the Biogenesis scandal started an ugly, public war between A-Rod and the MLB.
The initial 211-game suspension levied on A-Rod was absurd. It seemed to be intentionally two times longer than the longest–ever PED suspension. Arbitration was able to reduce the suspension to a similarly unreasonable 162 games. 
Each separate PED contributed a loss of 50 games for the first offense, and an additional 12 games — as well as playoff games — for obstruction. An entire season-long suspension for A-Rod was considered a huge win for the MLB over the players union, and Selig made sure everyone knew it.
The commissioner is set to retire after this season, so this final blow to PEDs was Selig’s swan song. It’s too bad he had to drag the union through the mud to do it. The MLB paid upwards of $125,000 for access to A-Rod’s medical records and put a witness on payroll. A-Rod lost 12 games and the playoffs for trying to pay the same person to tell his side of the story. 
Later, it turned out that A-Rod’s attempted bribe might have been a billing error, but that is not the problem in this case. Both sides attempted to take the battle to the court of public opinion.
This public battle is where the MLB gets really ugly and shows a darker side of the spectacle. Strategic leaks and media reports by the MLB, designed to destroy A-Rod’s public image, forced the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLPBA) to suspend their defense of A-Rod, in order to remain in the public’s favor. 
The MLB muscling the MLBPA out of the way takes the only defense the players have against the league completely out of the picture.
The actions of the MLB, such as stealing documents and compensating their star witness, Bosch, are not only questionable, but eerily reminiscent of the past.
Twenty years removed from a players strike, it appears the league has forgotten the animosity that once existed between players and owners in the MLB, and undermining the MLBPA might bring that attitude back. Selig attempted to pass a CBA with a salary cap and no arbitration, preventing the MLBPA from actually defending its players.
What the MLB did recently is not identical, but is quite similar to what happened in 1994. 
By pulling the rug out from under the MLBPA in arbitration for A-Rod’s suspension, the MLB showed it will sink to deep depths in order to get its way and make sure the MLBPA has to publicly agree or risk falling out of favor and losing legal power and leverage.
This action would shift the power from the players back to the league and bring baseball back to a time not long ago when four work stoppages happened in less than 25 years — a large number for such a highly paid position.
A-Rod broke the rules and the players established a punishment for what happens when someone breaks the rules. He should have gotten that suspension. 
The 162 games plus playoffs handed to him shows that the MLB would rather take down its targets than respect the unions designed to protect them.  
The relationship between the players and owners cannot deteriorate once again due to the MLB’s power to outmuscle the MLBPA in arbitration, for fear of another period of work stoppages and off-field issues ruining baseball.
This case is also interesting when the government’s adherence to the law is considered. The MLB is a heavily publicly subsidized organization. There’s no reason a government–subsidized organization should be able to push around the union in ways that go directly against the spirit of labor laws in this nation.
As a Yankee fan, I look forward to $25 million being taken off the payroll and hopefully spent on pitching rather than a player who was past his prime and struck out nearly every at bat. 
Baseball fans can only hope that the sport’s haunting past never rears its ugly head again. The lack of physical evidence that the MLB presented shows that it simply lacks the capability to catch players breaking the rules. 
This inability is not an excuse to break the rules or to try and nail down faces of baseball scandals, and that kind of scapegoating should never have happened.
When Selig pretends to have taken PEDs out of baseball, he can also pat himself on the back for taking the trust between the players and the league out of baseball — again.

A large portion of America will watch football for the first time all season next Sunday as Superbowl XLVIII airs. Never fear, uninformed viewer — The Tartan is here to make sure you have at least some idea about what is happening.
The Football
The game features the Seattle Seahawks against the Denver Broncos. Both finished with the top seed in their respective conferences and had home field advantage through the playoffs up until this point.
The Seahawks are a primarily defensive team. Led by their hard-hitting secondary, the Seahawks are a suffocating team that embodies the defense-wins-championships mentality. Pro-Bowl Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman became the face of the team last week when he was interviewed right after the Seahawks’ win over their rivals, the San Francisco 49ers.
Sherman shouted: “I’m the best corner in the game! When you try me with a sorry receiver like Crabtree, that’s the result you gonna get! Don’t you ever talk about me.” This interview came on the heels of Sherman deflecting a potentially game-winning touchdown pass aimed at 49ers receiver Michael Crabtree for a game-clinching interception.
Sherman’s play and antics have further overshadowed the consistent, yet unimpressive play of the Seahawks offense. Led by running back Marshawn “Beast Mode” Lynch, the Seahawks consistently pound the football, focusing on ball control more than long touchdown throws. Second-year quarterback Russell Wilson has not put up the gaudy numbers of his draft class peers Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck and Washington Redskins quarterback Robert Griffen III. Instead, he acts as more of a protector of the football, waiting for the right moment to burst out with a long play by improvising with his legs and accurate arm.
The one ace in the hole for the Seahawks is the return of wide receiver Percy Harvin. Acquired from the Minnesota Vikings for a first-round pick this past offseason, Harvin has seen very limited playing time since sustaining a variety of injuries over the course of the season. However, his speed remains unmatched in the league, so expect to see Harvin running all over the field on Sunday trying to make things difficult for the Broncos.
The Broncos are the perfect foil for the Seahawks, relying heavily on their high-flying offense for most of their wins. Quarterback Peyton Manning had the greatest statistical season of any passer in NFL history, setting the record for most touchdowns and most passing yardage. With a variety of weapons — all-pro wideouts Demarius Thomas, Erin Decker, and Wes Welker, along with breakout star, tight end Julius Thomas — it is nearly impossible to fully cover all of Manning’s targets on any given play. When combined with the two-headed running game of running back Knowshon Moreno and rookie running back Montee Ball, containing the Denver offense is no easy task.
On the defensive side of the ball, the Broncos still have a top-10 unit more than capable of stopping the pass and the run. Large defensive tackle Terrance “Pot Roast” Knighton looks to play a large role in containing Lynch and forcing Wilson to beat the Broncos with his arm and not his running ability. The loss of all-pro linebacker Von Miller to a torn ACL has certainly hurt the squad, but backup Danny Trevathan has done a tremendous job filling in for him.
The Halftime Show
The Super Bowl halftime show is a huge guarantee for media exposure, which is why superstar artists are willing to perform for little to no pay. This year Grammy Award-winner Bruno Mars was tapped to perform in front of the world’s largest television audience. We can look forward to huge sets and visual effects as Mars sings with guest performers Red Hot Chili Peppers.
The biggest point of intrigue surrounding the halftime show, other than the set list, will be the impact of the weather. With the Super Bowl being hosted in an open-roofed stadium in New Jersey in the beginning of February, there is no guarantee of good weather and a possibility of freezing temperatures and precipitation. Mars and the Red Hot Chili Peppers both traditionally perform in large, indoor venues, so their adaptation to the cold will be interesting to watch.
The Ads
The final piece of the Super Bowl viewing experience is the ads. With a 30-second advertisement spot costing around $4 million, advertisers go out of their way to make sure they have an impact and stay with their audience. In the past, some of the best advertisements have been from Doritos, which uses fan submissions with a million-dollar prize for the winners, and beer companies who fully understand who their primary demographic is.
But not all Super Bowl advertising has to cost a lot of money. During last year’s power outage, Oreo tweeted a picture referencing the blackout. This tweet went viral as people wanted to share the humorous and timely picture with friends and family. This tweet was marked as one of the most successful social marketing images of the year, and gained as much, if not more, exposure from the Super Bowl than the companies that paid millions of dollars for 30 seconds of air time.
Prop Bets
To help keep you interested during the game, here is a list of fun prop bets you and your friends can wager on and count throughout the game. A prop bet is an over-under guess on generally trivial things, like how long the national anthem will be and how many yards a specific player will gain.
Times Peyton Manning yells OMAHA while on the field: 12
Minutes after the game it takes Richard Sherman to turn from hyped up football player to well-spoken Stanford Graduate: 10
Microphones shoved in Sherman's face during this cool down period: 5
Shots of Peyton Manning's younger brother Eli Manning in the stands: 4
Times Skittles are referenced with Marshawn Lynch: 3
Inches of snow on the ground during the game: 2
Temperature at kickoff: 28˚F
Random guests that show up during the Halftime Show: 3
Advertisements that try and be hip by referencing months-old viral hits like "Harlem Shake"" or "The Fox": 5

Medicine and medical technology have long been areas of public interest due to their clear societal benefits. Recent technological advancements have encouraged medical advancements, particularly in the fields of orthotics and prosthetics. Studies by Carnegie Mellon researcher Yong-Lae Park suggest that soft, bio-inspired orthotic devices could aid in the rehabilitation of foot and ankle disorders.
Park, currently an assistant professor in the Robotics Institute and the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon, conducted the research while a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard’s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering with chief technology officer at BioSensics LLC, Bor-rong Chen and assistant professor at the University of Southern California Viterbi School of Engineering, Néstor O. Pérez-Arancibia. The team looked at the advantages of using a soft orthotic device based on the anatomy of the lower leg for rehabilitation of foot and ankle disorders.
Park explained that the idea for the device arose from the realization that the device needed to be different from traditional exoskeletons, which are rigid structures used for rehabilitation. 
“The advantage of a traditional exoskeleton is that all the joints are really well defined and you can transmit forces more accurately,” Park said. “But the limitations are that it is bulky and it defines your motions. You cannot define your motion by yourself.”
Exoskeleton devices generally limit motion to one-dimension despite the fact that natural ankles are capable of three-dimensional motion. The soft, bio-inspired device that Park and his fellow researchers developed mimics the four main muscles in the lower leg that contribute to the movement of the ankle. By modeling the device after the anatomy of the lower leg and utilizing a soft design, the team produced a device that allows for more natural motion. 
“It is impossible to copy all the muscles,” Park admitted. “As an engineer, we can simplify the identification. We can make the device compact and simple but still give active assistance.”
The development of a soft, bio-inspired orthotic has the potential to spark huge developments in the future. Park explained that while there have recently been many staggering developments in the field of prosthetics, very little has changed in the field of orthotics. Braces are generally the same and tend to keep joints in fixed angles or positions. “By doing this research, I think we can get more attention from society and more interest in this area, which will give us more leverage to support the advancement of the field,” Park said.
Park also sees this research having an influence on the integration of robotics into every day human life. 
“Today we use robots to help people, but they are not really an interactive part of our world. In the future I see robots as part of our daily life,” Park said. “In that sense, soft robots will have a large impact. This technology allows us to make robots soft so they can be closer to the human body and to human life.”
Despite the promising results of the research, however, there is still a long way to go. Park explained that the soft design, as opposed to the more traditional exoskeleton design, poses some problems. For example, it is much harder to define and transmit force in the soft design because, compared to traditional braces, the device is much more dependent on the user. 
Since the force must travel through the skin and muscle to reach the bone, force transmission and control are also more difficult. “This is very early staging of the prototype and design,” Park said. “The device itself cannot be practical immediately.”
An unconventional approach to orthotics, using soft robotics for rehabilitation purposes has the potential to greatly impact many fields of study. This research not only paves the way for new advances in medical treatment, but may also shed light on the steps that need to be taken in order to more effectively integrate robots into our daily lives.

If you were to go back in history and meet with the explorers and navigators of yesteryear, they would probably be wielding — at least one — magnetic compass. Whip out your compass app on your smartphone, and they’d probably be flabbergasted — well, with that and your time machine. But how has the compass worked to help everyone from ancient Chinese seafarers to today’s Boy Scouts of America? And how exactly does that timeworn technology work in your iPhone?
First, we’ll go over the magnetic compass. This trustworthy piece of equipment has been around since 200 BCE, according to William Lowrie, a professor emeritus at ETH Zurich. Navigators started using this compass regularly on land and sea closer to 1000 CE, in present-day China. The standard magnetic compass of the 20th century is made up of a magnetized needle in its heart with a face showing cardinal directions — north, south, east, and west. The needle is mounted on a surface with low friction so that it can easily turn; if held flat, one end of the needle will point toward magnetic north and one to magnetic south.
The compass is able to determine north and south due to the magnet’s interaction with the Earth’s magnetic field. The cause of the magnetic field is not completely known, but geologists have made hypotheses regarding the phenomenon by analyzing the layers of the Earth. The Earth is made up of an outer crust, followed by the upper mantle, the inner mantle, the outer core, and then finally the inner core at the very center. The inner core is made up mostly of molten iron, but the very center of the inner core is under so much pressure that the iron becomes solid, according to howstuffworks.com. It is believed that the rotation of the Earth and the immense heat from the core cause the iron to move in a rotational pattern. This rotational pattern may be the source of the magnetic field that we see on Earth. The field produced is very weak, however, which is why the needle on the compass needs to be very lightweight and on a surface with minimal friction.
As expected with any technology created over two millenniums ago, the compass has its issues. First, it has to be completely level to work — making it rather difficult to use on something like an airplane. Also, a magnetic compass can take a long time to correct itself. Another confusing thing is that the magnetic north pole is actually the geographical south pole (and vice-versa).
So if the traditional needle compass works because of a small magnet, how do the compass apps in phones work? As it turns out, the smartphones do have a small magnetometer, which can measure the Earth’s magnetic field. This information is combined with an accelerator inside the phone. The accelerator gets information regarding the phone’s position in space. It is able to pinpoint the phone’s position from solid-state sensors within the phone that can measure their tilt and movement. The information provided by these devices means that the compass app can display cardinal directions no matter which orientation the phone is in, according to the algorithmic software development company Sensor Platforms.
Whether using a 200 BCE  compass or the compass app on the iPhone 5S, the Earth’s magnetic field is the key to having reliable directions. Now, if only Apple could develop a moral compass app.

Today, society is flooded with new technologies. Devices and gadgets are becoming increasingly prevalent in people’s everyday lives. What if, however, all this technology that we have become so reliant on fails?
On Dec. 17, 2013, Target announced that payment information was stolen from 40 million customers. Since then, this prediction has grown to as high as 110 million customers. By installing software on the point-of-sale (POS) systems, the hackers were able to steal credit card information, names, addresses, and other personal information of Target customers. Customers and the media immediately placed the blame on Target for negligence of their cyber security systems. 
The issue of system failure is not unique to Target — similar headlines have appeared before, including in the case of Toyota’s recall due to break failure in 2010. How do we deal with these breakdowns of the technology we put so much trust in? Who do we hold liable?
In the case of the Target breach, it was instantly concluded that the company was at fault. They must have been careless in making their purchase of their hardware. On the other hand, if the technology is faulty, surely the manufacturers are the ones at fault. The POS systems were overridden by open source software; the makers certainly should have predicted this would happen. There are three important points that must be made in order to prove liability.
First, did someone get hurt? It must be proven that there was some cost to a person or property as a result of the mistake. In the case of Target, releasing information about customers’ information subjects them to unauthorized charges to their bank accounts or identity theft. 
Second, did the company make its best effort to understand the risk? If the company was negligent by ignoring the risk and not taking the precautions to prevent it, then it is difficult for them to claim innocence. 
To prove Target guilty of negligence, it must first be proven that they did not take care to optimize their security and were not aware of the hole in their system. Third, did the user get enough information? If there is any potential risk of using a product, the consumer must be made aware of the possibility.
A final point to be considered is the legislation behind the technology’s production and use. For example, the United States government is notorious in the world of pharmaceuticals for extremely strict regulations. Because of these restrictions, people are less likely to suffer from incorrectly administered or unknowingly harmful medication. 
What if the structure that the United States puts on pharmaceutical regulations were replicated for technology? If the government put more stress on reducing the risk of inventions before they are released to the public, we could stop more malicious technology failures.
However, with this system, there is potential to stifle innovation. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported in 2010 that 40-60 percent of clinical trials for products regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are tested outside the country. 
With lower standards for drug administration, it is easier to test and understand the product. Research and development becomes harder to conduct under strict rules and regulations.
Looking into the future, this burst in technological development does not appear to be slowing. It is up to us to find the balance in responsibility in order to prevent disasters while preserving innovation. 
Understanding the subtleties of liability and research and development legislation can help us make informed decisions about the technology that has become a permanent fixture in our everyday lives.
Pugwash is a non-advocacy, educational organization that meets on a weekly basis to discuss the implications of science, technology, and medicine in society. This is a summary of last week’s discussion on technology and liability.

Old rover finds new evidence of water on Mars
Continuing the search for life on the red planet, the Mars rover Opportunity, part of NASA’s Mars Exploration Rover Mission, has produced new findings that suggest life on Mars was once possible. The rover found evidence that a giant crater is likely to have once contained water that was just right for microbial life; it wasn’t too acidic or salty. Even though the rover has long outlived its expiration date, it continues to prove vital to scientists’ ongoing examination of Mars.

Scientists use waves to predict earthquakes 
Scientists at Stanford University and MIT are now using waves as a model to understand how a future earthquake will impact California. Instead of focusing on when the next earthquake will hit, researchers are now trying to study the way that the earthquake will shake the ground and anything on top of it. Waves have always been understood to create seismic fields in the same manner that earthquakes do. However, they produce such little force that they were always considered noise. Now, with this reassessment, scientists have made predictions that the next earthquake to hit California could be a big one.

Fruit flies found to detect cancer cells among other cells
Researchers that are a part of an international project at the University of Konstanz in Germany have found that fruit flies are able to smell the difference between a healthy cell and a cancer cell. These quantifiable findings have provided more evidence of the fact that animal sensory organs are far more acute than any artificial ones that could ever hope to be developed in the near future. Moving forward, scientists are finding new ways to diagnosis cancer in patients.

Sharks are at risk for becoming an extinct species
The International Union for Conservation of Nature found that 250 of the 1,041 total species of sharks are at a very high risk of going extinct. Unfortunately, they have nowhere to hide from overfishing and are thus being dwindled down to smaller numbers. This overfishing could have a cascading impact on many ecosystems because the loss of an apex predator can sometimes prove to be catastrophic at multiple levels of the food chain.

Video gamers impacting scientific world
It turns out that video games might not be as mind-numbing as parents make them out to be. Recent video game releases, such as Foldit, in which players make new proteins, and Planet Hunters, an astronomy game, have harnessed a fraction of what director of game research and development at the Institute for the Future Jane McGonigal estimates is 3 billion hours weekly that people spend on video games.  Scientists have been searching for the protein structure of an AIDS-like protein in monkeys for over 13 years; gamers of Foldit found it in three weeks.

Researchers mimic cat whiskers to increase sensors
A team of scientists at the University of California, Berkeley are mimicking the whiskers on cats to provide ultra-sensitive sensing for robots. These hair-like sensors could aid human-computer interaction because it would allow the machines to sense human touch with a higher degree of accuracy. The whisker idea is not new, but has never successfully been implemented until now.

In a small, cluttered room in the basement of the East Campus Garage, magic is happening. Nathaniel Krasnoff, senior mechanical engineering major and the president of the Carnegie Mellon Solar Splash team, spends hours working alongside his dedicated teammates, including senior mechanical engineer KJ Lee, to build an impressive, solar-powered boat that will race in two European competitions during the upcoming summer.
According to the official website, Solar Splash is “an international intercollegiate solar/electric boat regatta” sponsored by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Power Electronics Society. The main events that the competition consists of include the slalom, endurance, and sprint. The slalom event is a test of maneuverability in which the boat must navigate around several buoys. In the endurance event, the boat has two hours to complete as many laps as possible around a predetermined loop with energy provided by a combination of solar panels and lead-acid batteries. The sprint is exactly as it sounds — a test of speed across a much shorter course.
Carnegie Mellon’s Solar Splash has competed consistently in the official Solar Splash competition every year, with the exception of last year. This year, however, the team is back with renewed vigor and even higher aspirations than before: The team will be competing in the DONG Energy Solar Challenge, a solar boat competition that will be held in the Netherlands this June. The team has also been invited to participate in the inaugural Monaco Solar Grand Prix in July.
Krasnoff joked that the Solar Splash team was always seen as second to buggy at Carnegie Mellon. “So for us, always being the second child and now competing on behalf of the United States is a big step. We are honored and humbled and excited.”
The Solar Splash team currently consists of 40 members, although a main 10-member group is the core of the team. The team consists of members from various different academic backgrounds, including mechanical engineering and electrical and computer engineering, and works in specialized groups, such as hull, propulsion, and electrical — each with its own vice president. Their work space is split between Bramer House and the East Campus Garage basement.
Krasnoff made a point of remarking that their new hull vice president, freshman Sharina Lall, is a biology major, although her experience with Solar Splash has actually made her consider switching into the Carnegie Institute of Technology (CIT). Their electrical vice president, sophomore Thomas Eliot, was originally a mechanical engineer but changed his major to electrical and computer engineering after his experience with Solar Splash. Their new propulsion head, freshman Kira Fujibayashi, is an economics major who is in the process of switching into mechanical engineering.
“People do really get excited about what they’re learning here,” Krasnoff said. The process of learning how to build an electric solar-powered boat is entirely different than how students learn in the classroom. In fact, when the team was younger, they essentially had to start from square one. 
“We had no idea how to build a boat,” Krasnoff admitted. “We had no money, we were kicked out of our space behind Hamburg Hall, and we had no members. Now we have enough money for this new amazing adventure, two spaces, and 40 members.”
The actual process of building the boat begins with a boat design software called Michlet. One can set a series of parameters, such as how fast the boat needs to go or how long it needs to be, and Michlet, an evolutionary software, will run hundreds of iterations until an optimized model is created. After this process, molds are made by Advanced Pattern Works, an independently owned and operated model-making service. Carnegie Mellon Solar Splash has many sponsors, including Constellation Energy, CIT, the Steinbrenner Institute for Environmental Education and Research, the Richard King Mellon Foundation Institute, and Lockheed Martin.
“When we first came, really, there was nothing. No one knew anything,” Lee said. “But you learn. You fail and you learn, and now we’re entering an international competition, and it’s a big change. It’s been two years in the making, so it’s almost like a movie.” With the intellect and dedication that the members of Solar Splash have shown in past years, this summer’s European competitions are sure to be this movie’s happy ending.

Carnegie Mellon’s researchers are constantly making new discoveries in various fields of science. Here are summaries of some recent findings that you might have missed.
Using cuttlefish ink as novel battery materials
Researchers: Assistant professor of materials science and biomedical engineering Christopher Bettinger and associate professor of materials science and engineering and engineering and public policy Jay Whitacre. 
Discovery: Cuttlefish are a type of marine animal closely related to squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Though they seem to be an unlikely choice of study for a pair of scientists who work with batteries, Bettinger and Whitacre have discovered that the ink from cuttlefish “provides the perfect chemistry and nanostructure to power tiny electronic devices,” according to a university press release. In particular, cuttlefish will be useful in applications that are performed close to sensitive living tissue, such as for edible medical devices. The reason why cuttlefish ink is such an effective electrode material is that the melanin pigments in the ink exhibit charge storage capacities that are higher than those of synthetic melanin.
New developments in hydropower generation
Researcher: Professor of electrical and computer engineering Diana Marculescu.
Discovery: Hydropower — power that comes from the energy of moving water — is generally implemented in places where a lot of energy can be harnessed at once, such as at sites of large dams or water turbines. However, Marculescu is developing a way to make hydropower more efficient by generating smaller amounts of electricity in a larger amount of places. By using a process called hydrokinetic power extraction, Marculescu and her team will be able to harness small amounts of kinetic energy from multiple different water locations in a way that is both cheaper and more environmentally friendly than conventional hydropower methods. 
Measuring the universe to 1 percent accuracy
Researchers: Assistant professor of physics Shirley Ho and postdoctoral fellow of physics Mariana Vargas-Magaña.
Discovery: In astronomy, a standard ruler is an astronomical object that has a known size. By combining this known size with the measured angular diameter of the object in the sky, its distance from the observer can be determined. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III) — which Ho and Vargas-Magaña are members of — uses baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) — imprints of sound waves from the early universe that can be observed today in the distribution of galaxies — as a standard ruler. Ho and Vargas-Magaña measured BAO in parallel and perpendicular directions to gain a better understanding of the standard ruler, helping SDSS-III measure the scale of the universe to an accuracy of 1 percent.

For those who fought the arctic temperatures that waved down through the streets in shivering gusts of wind to attend The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust’s first Gallery Crawl of 2014, it was definitely worth the numbed extremities. This event occurs every quarter and is a great opportunity to sample all that the Cultural District has to offer. These offerings range from premieres of new art collections and lectures to an incredibly graceful performance of fire dancing. Whether you’re looking to acquire a new piece for your collection, or just want to wander around and strike up a few words with the woman selling her artisanal teas, the Gallery Crawl truly has something for everyone.
Seeing as there are far too many events for one to realistically see everything — especially in a low of 0˚F — here are a few great excerpts from the evening.
Structures of Time and Space
Friday saw the two floors of the Wood Street Galleries premiering artist Erwin Redl’s Structures of Time and Space. The two pieces that are exhibited, “Twists and Turns” and “Speed Shift,” differ greatly in terms of aesthetics and feel.
“Twists and Turns” is installed in the darkened second floor and features red and purple lasers shot through small squares of glass hanging from the ceiling. The effect is very space-like, with the lights bouncing around the room in a kind of organized chaos. The exhibit is one that commands silence and forces all attention on taking in the space. Looking up at the ceiling feels more like staring at the night sky and seeing a million tiny galaxies whizzing by.
“Speed Shift,” on the third floor, gives off a much different feel than “Twists and Turns.” While one can hear another person’s thoughts at “Twists and Turns,” Friday saw the third floor abuzz with attendees talking and ordering drinks. The room is brightly lit and painted a jarring white. The installation is comprised of multiple rows of lights that wrap around the room and flash on and off, giving the impression of a slow movement inching its way around the perimeter. Compared to “Twists and Turns,” “Speed Shift” is much simpler and doesn’t feel as inspired as its counterpart. As a whole, the room feels as if it’s a discarded set from a 1950’s science fiction B movie.
Life and Death of the Igloo
The 707 Penn Gallery continued its previously-open exhibit, Life and Death of the Igloo by photographer David Aschkenas. The collection documents the tearing down of the old Pittsburgh Civic Arena — reverently referred to as the “Igloo” by Pittsburghers. The images, while documenting destruction, are filled with enormous heart.
The pictures clearly communicate the fact that the Civic Arena wasn’t merely a structure that was torn down, but an entire history now only alive in memory. The first picture in the collection is a crudely drawn sign on a seat near the floor of the empty arena that reads, “Thanks For The Memories.” An image of workmen folding up a banner that reads “Pittsburgh Penguins, Stanley Cup Champions 1991-92” feels like thousands of voices whispering, “I remember that.”
The gallery being as small as it is, it is also easy to hear the voices of other attendees. Walking around and gazing at the pictures of piled twisted metal that once held thousands of exhilarated fans, small tidbits of conversation can be plucked out of the air. This Friday, one man and the woman behind the bar struck up a conversation about all the concerts they’d seen at the Civic Arena back in the day, with words such as “I saw Led Zeppelin there on their first major tour.”
Steel Town Fire
On the corner of 7th Street and Penn Avenue at the outdoor Agnes R. Katz Plaza, before a large fountain with rivers of still ice cascading down the sides, the Steel Town Fire performance group set down their flaming paint can to give three performances over the course of the night. Given the hazardous nature of dancing with open flame, the group performed with a kind of graceful recklessness that disregarded the frigid air and had onlookers tapping each other on the shoulder to share their astonishment.
Never stopping their fluid movement, the performers passed one continuous flame from object to object, which included swords and poi.  
The performance was broken into segments marked by changing songs. The group’s soundtrack varied from chill drum and bass tracks to music that sounded incredibly raw. Some songs allowed the movements of the performers to appear as graceful as those of ballet dancers, while others forced a kind of raw energy that made one feel as if they were watching an old-world ritual. The group’s attire, which included small amounts of body jewelry and henna face tattoos, also added to the ritualistic aesthetic.
Night Market
This pop-up indoor market offered a number of different things to those who walked in the door. The room felt as if it was lit by candlelight, with a single strand of white Christmas lights nailed up at haphazard intervals stretching around the room. The front of the room was set up with cafe-style tables and chairs facing a performance from a female singer 
and guitarist. She played gentle renditions of covers such as Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah” and Bon Iver’s “Skinny Love” as well as a few well-written original songs, and perfectly embodied the kind of casual, friendly, and serene atmosphere of the Night Market.
The Night Market had a wide variety of items for sale. The first table that greeted visitors was occupied by rows and rows of glassware in vibrant colors, while the last one showcased Irish cultural items, such as pendants and wool driving caps, and was curated by the Irish Festival association. In between was everything from Pittsburgh-inspired T-shirts from the web store DeadBuryDead to boxes overflowing with shining silver jewelry and sculptures of robots made from assorted pieces of junk metal.
Visitors could easily wander around the market, examining the pottery and sharing words. In addition to the arts and craft items, vendors sold food items, such as sandwiches. Local Pittsburgh roasters Zeke’s Coffee sold cups of their exceptional coffee for $1.50. Having roamed from event to event in the cold night, it was a wonderful 
experience to sit down with a cup of coffee at a table, listen to the serene sound of the live music, and simply enjoy the oasis of warmth that the Night Market offered 
to the Gallery Crawl.
Even though it shot right through one’s bones, the cold of the night also brought a sense of warmth. After braving the distance from building to building, there was always a sense of welcome at every door when one could unzip their coat and take in a new experience. Seeing as the next one will be in warm weather, this quarterly event isn’t to be missed.

Subzero temperatures and icy wind chills make it easy to contract a case of the winter blues, especially for students from states with warmer climates. For Carnegie Mellon students, however, a tropical solace is right in their backyard. Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens currently has its “Orchid and Tropical Bonsai Show” on display, offering a warm and colorful reprieve from Pittsburgh’s winter weather.
The display starts in the Palm Court, the first room that welcomes guests upon entering the botanical gardens, and stretches into the two adjacent rooms. The Serpentine Room features the conservatory’s tropical bonsai collection, and the Sunken Garden displays the conservatory’s orchids, which are on display especially for this show.
The Orchid Room, a fan favorite according to staff at Phipps, features the conservatory’s year-round orchid display, and is also incorporated into this show. The Orchid Room features glass pieces from regional artists Jenn Figg and Matthew McCormack as well. The pieces complement the plant life and add to the enchanting feel of the room.
The orchids featured in the show offer a colorful, lively, and fragrant contrast to the bleak colors of winter outside. According to a press release by Phipps, over 25,000 species of orchids exist in the world, and the conservatory features hundreds of them. The Barbara Trisherman Slipper Orchid Collection, which was “curated to be one of the world’s definitive slipper orchid resources,” according to the press release, is just one of Phipps’s many orchid collections featured in this display.
The tropical bonsai collection features a variety of the small Japanese trees that are grown to look old — from the typical upright tree to slanted trees, and even a tree that grows tiny oranges. Guests receive a pebble upon entering the conservatory and can vote for their favorite bonsai tree by placing the pebble in a glass jar in front of their preferred tree. The tree with the most pebbles at the end of the show will be featured on social media, according to a Phipps employee.
While viewers can find a splash of color in the orchid display, tropical bonsai are “said to give those who practice the art a sense of well-being,” according to the Phipps press release.
Those interested in starting their own orchid or bonsai collections can attend public programs on the cultivation and care of the plants on select Saturdays and Sundays at 1:30 p.m. in the Tropical Forest Conservatory. The classes are included in the price of admission, which, for Carnegie Mellon students, is free. Throughout the year, Phipps’s adult education program also offers bonsai classes on a variety of topics for experienced and novice gardeners alike.
Take a break from studying this winter and instead enjoy a warm escape from chilly Pittsburgh weather at Phipps. The “Orchid and Tropical Bonsai Show” is on display until March 9 and is open daily 9:30 a.m. – 5 p.m. Saturday through Thursday and 9:30 a.m. – 10 p.m. on Fridays.

There is only one word to describe Carnegie Mellon School of Music’s production of their most recent opera: fabulous. Flamboyant personalities came together with terrific costume design to form a bizarre rendition of Emmanuel Chabrier’s L’etoile. Stage director Gregory Lehane fully transported the audience to 1877 France.
L’etoile, which literally translates to “The Star,” tells the story of Lazuli, a poor peddler who falls in love with a princess, Laoula, who is destined to be married to the king, Ouf. When Lazuli denounces the king and slaps him, Ouf orders Lazuli dead, but his royal astrologer explains that with Lazuli’s death, the king’s death follows closely. Through a series of dramatic events, Lazuli ends up marrying Laoula, only to appear dead shortly after, having apparently been shot by officials. When Lazuli reappears alive after swimming in a lake, Ouf is so overwhelmed that he gives his blessing for Lazuli and Laoula to live happily together — a rare happy ending for an opera.
At typical opera houses, the audience’s hair tends to be gray. Many have expressed worry that the listeners of opera are slowly dying out. One look at the Philip Chosky Theater in Purnell Center for the Arts would tell anyone otherwise. Students from all different backgrounds came together to watch the production. For some, opera is a way of life; they live and breathe the music. But that’s not true for everyone. L’etoile was many people’s first experience with opera, such as freshman computer science major William Howard Matchen. “_L’etoile_ was a thrill!” said Matchen. “Hearing the orchestra while watching the colorfully-costumed actors interact in dialogue, song, and dance is an experience that will surely bring me back to the theater.”
Because L’etoile was originally written in French, the singing was all done in French with English supertitles to make it more understandable. To learn the French words, senior vocal performance major Olivia Vadnais (Lazuli) recommended sitting down with a dictionary to translate all the text. The dialogue, however, was spoken in English, creating an interesting mix of languages in the performance.
The students in the School of Music were pleasantly surprised by the decision to perform this classic opera, said Vadnais. She explained that with young voices, it is often difficult to find an opera suitable for the cast, so they often must resort to contemporary operas.
The Carnegie Mellon voice majors were cast as early as last May. L’etoile is double-cast with some principal roles changing on a Thursday/Saturday and Friday/Sunday schedule. The cast included Vadnais and master’s student Courtney Elvira Lazuli, junior Joanna Latini and junior Stephanie Ramos singing Laoula, and senior Nigel Rowe and junior John Teresi singing Ouf. Between May and November, they worked on becoming familiar with their roles, learning their lines, and practicing their French, according to freshman vocal performance major and chorus cast member Guillaume Poudrier.
For some, like Rowe who has been performing in operas since high school, the characterization was natural. “I saw Ouf in a way that’s not entirely different from the way I see myself, as a person,” said Rowe. “He’s pretty flamboyant, very high energy, and that suits me.”
For others, however, it was more difficult. Vadnais, who performed in last year’s Into the Woods, had to step into the role of a male for the first time, and that took quite a bit of practice. “I actually had my boyfriend observe and he’d tell me, ‘No, you need to do this with your hips’ or ‘Boys never move their hands like that,’ but it was definitely weird,” she said.
Since November, they have been rehearsing every day, perfecting both their voices and their interactions with one another and the audience, said Poudrier. Despite popular belief, opera singers are responsible for much more than singing; they also have to put on an act. In this aspect, the School of Music was incredibly successful, with every member of the cast performing brilliantly.
However, it’s not only the cast that makes up an opera. Master’s drama student Daniel Tyler Mathews, the team’s costume designer, produced radical pieces that, in some dramatic way, gave meaning to the atmosphere of L’etoile. “His costumes are perfect for the show,” said Rowe. “It’s kind of like walking into a French cabaret at the time when the opera was written.” The costumes also added a sense of good humor to the show, helping to make it the lighthearted, happy opera that it was written to be.
Overall, the piece was colorful, tasteful, and wonderfully performed. The amount of hard work put into the performance was evident, but the amount of fun the cast had was also clear. “The stressful moments never outweigh the fun I have on stage,” said Rowe. “We just have a dynamic on stage where it’s just really fun to be on stage with them.” Rowe is unsure of his future plans, but he’s happy to have gotten the chance to perform in L’etoile this semester.

There was the year that skinny jeans came into style. Leggings also reentered the fashion world a few years ago, followed by circle scarves and combat boots. All of these trends seemed strange when they first appeared until nearly everyone began wearing them; that generally happens with trends. Now fashion followers are wondering what the year 2014 will bring.
It’s too early to predict what styles from the past will reappear, which new trends will emerge, and which ones will come to an end. If the trends from the Spring 2014 New York Fashion Week (Sept. 5­ - 12) are anything to go by, certain trends are set to take the stage. Though most people tend to wait for fashion trends to make their mark before deciding to follow them, here is a sneak peek into this year’s fashion forecast for all you trendsetters out there.
One trend that has been in style for the past year or so is the menswear-inspired trend, and this trend seems to be a major one for spring 2014. White shirts and button downs were all over the runways at Fashion Week. With 2014 comes a new twist on these types of shirts in the form of contrasting details, such as leather accents or small studs on the collar and cuffs.
Contrasting collar shirts seem like a trend that will not last for long, so find one at an inexpensive store like Forever 21, rather than investing in one that will cost more. To carry this trend into any wardrobe, wear it as a statement piece with jeans and boots on casual days, or dress it up with a skirt and heels.
Another menswear trend, wide-leg trousers, is also making its way into spring 2014. Though most fashion experts say that wide-leg trousers will work on any body type, these types of pants are unflattering on most people. Certain wide-leg trousers are flattering for many people, though, like the bohemian, billowy type found at Brandy Melville or Free People.
While it’s too cold to wear them now, the summery wide-legged trousers look great on anyone with a top that is fitted or cropped. These pants are comfortable as well, and it is possible for one to get a lot of wear out of them once it starts warming up outside.
As it’s still below-freezing outside on most days, it might be more applicable to focus on trends fit for colder weather, such as sweaters and jackets.
While sweaters are always good for the transition between winter and spring, certain styles are making a comeback this season. The emphasis on pop art during Fashion Week explains the bright colors and large graphics on the sweaters found at stores such as Topshop. Their sweaters also feature some of the other major trends for spring 2014, which include the furry or fuzzy texture, as well as athletic-inspired clothing with thick-striped sleeves reminiscent of sports jerseys. These sweaters may not be for everyone, but they can be worn with dark jeans and combat boots for an edgy look.
As winter turns to spring, it may be time to start considering what jacket to wear for spring. Boxy jackets, or ones that are cropped, reappeared on the runway and are replacing the commonly worn moto jackets, which are inspired by biker jackets. Even if these jackets do not stay in style for a long time, it is highly likely that they will come back.
Bomber jackets are another style that have gone in and out of style and are currently back in for this season. Either of these types of jacket can be worn with a skirt or dress to balance out the toughness.
Some final trends for spring 2014 to take note of are metallic items of clothing, the micro-pleat, 3-D details, and pale pink. Each of these was seen in different clothes on the runway, and can easily be incorporated into anyone’s personal style.
As for the metallic trend, wearing a sweater in a metallic color, such as the matte gold one on popular online shopping destination tobi.com, is a bolder choice. The safer option would be a regular top with metallic detailing, which can be found at most stores.
Micro-pleated skirts were a major trend for last summer and could be found in every color at Urban Outfitters. They look great paired with graphic muscle tanks for a laid-back look.
Three-dimensional details include anything from sequins to beads or any other embellishment and instantly glamorize tops and dresses. Pale pink will be everywhere this season, but make sure to layer it with something edgy to avoid looking childish.
It may be that none of these trends will make their mark in 2014. Someone may invent something novel which will remain in style for a few years. While the year of the poncho is thankfully over and will not return, every season brings with it new challenges and possibilities in fashion. Wait for the spring 2014 trends to play out, or be one of the first to try them!

In the not-too-distant future, operating systems have surpassed human intelligence, and the only place left to buy clothes from is American Apparel. That is the world that Her drops viewers in. Directed by Spike Jonze, this movie was recently nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. 
The film follows Theodore Twombly, played by Joaquin Phoenix, a divorced man struggling with loneliness who sees an advertisement for an artificially intelligent operating system and decides to buy it. He then meets his operating system, Samantha, played by Scarlett Johansson, and their relationship begins to form and grow in interesting ways.
Her is an incredible science fiction film — and a fantastic film in general — because it not only portrays a realistic vision of the future and the issues that society will have to face, but because it also explores the ever-present struggles of human nature.
After viewing many movie trailers and commercials for the film, it’s easy to imagine the emotional depth that the film aims for. However, one thing that may catch viewers off-guard is just how funny Her is. Sometimes subtle, often vulgar, occasionally deep; all of these varied comedic moments strike the right notes with perfect timing within the film, making sure Her does not become too heavy and keeping it believable. After remembering that the movie is directed by Spike Jonze — who has collaborated with the likes of the team behind Jackass — it’s easy to see where the film gets its sense of humor.
Another aspect of the film that works well is its portrayal of the not-too-distant future. Filmed in Los Angeles and Shanghai, the urban setting creates great parallels between the large population density and the loneliness felt by the various characters throughout the movie. There’s this distance between how busy and populated future Los Angeles is and how the characters — especially Theodore — cope with their struggles in connecting with individuals and society as a whole. The film utilizes this great aesthetic as well, creating a future that isn’t drenched in chrome, but instead full of life.
While the film is phenomenal, the ways in which Jonze handles some of the secondary characters is problematic. Olivia Wilde’s character feels fairly single-note and doesn’t have much screen time, which is unfortunate due to what she represents in Theodore’s emotional progression throughout the film. 
Additionally, Chris Pratt’s performance as Paul, Theodore’s boss, received very little billing in the film’s promotion. He provides quite a few laughs and an interesting perspective on Theodore and Samantha’s relationship, though.
However, those faults are easily overshadowed by the main performances. The relationship between Theodore and Samantha feels authentic, and it grows and develops with the added issues that arise from Samantha being an operating system. 
Theodore and Samantha both have to deal with loneliness, love, expressing their emotions, and learning how to connect with others. Ultimately, this is what Her is about: How the ability to connect with and open up to someone is one of the scariest, and most rewarding, parts of life. How we open up to others as a society may change over time — whether it’s through handwritten love letters or a string of emojis — but ultimately those connections can lead to the deepest feelings and experiences.
As a film, Her certainly deserves its recent award nominations. It’s visually enticing, with great performances that provoke a lot of thought. A definite contender for Best Picture, it is a fantastic film that explores interesting concepts while staying true to human nature.

Wreck It Ralph
Thursday, Jan. 30 — 7:30 p.m.
When kids go into Litwak’s Arcade, they play the ever popular Fix-It Felix game, in which a villain named Wreck-It Ralph destroys a building, yet Fix-It Felix is always around to save the day. However, when the arcade closes, the characters come to life and have dreams of their own. Ralph (played by John C. Reilly) is tired of being the villain and aspires to be a hero. In order to prove to himself that he is more than just the overlooked bad guy, Ralph decides to journey into the arcade universe in order to search for the perfect game where he can finally save the day. Ralph may seem like a ruthless and gargantuan villain, but Reilly gives him an affectionate and sensitive side that makes it easy for the audience to root for him. Wreck-It Ralph brings the classic Disney element of wonder and brings new twists and laughs as viewers live in the arcade games rather than just play them.
V for Vendetta
Friday, Jan. 31 — 8 p.m.
Set in a dark futuristic version of Britain, V for Vendetta is a cult classic full of stylized action and provocative questions. In the totalitarian regime of Britain, the government has become corrupt and abusive. When young and innocent Evey Hammond (played by Natalie Portman) is about to be attacked by secret police, she is saved by a masked vigilante who goes by the name V (played by Hugo Weaving). V is not only a hero, but also a symbol of hope and rebellion against the tyrannical regime. With Evey by his side, V sets out to create a revolution to destroy the totalitarian government. V for Vendetta is more than just an action thriller; it is a piece of great science fiction which challenges us to question the philosophy and politics of our own world.

Hey Matt and Ryan
I live off campus, so I have a long trek to class everyday. With this polar vortex and the snow, I’m getting really tired of Pittsburgh weather. But all this misery gave me an idea. I heard that the organizers of the Olympics in Sochi were importing snow in order to have enough. I think Pittsburgh should start exporting it and Carnegie Mellon’s the perfect place to figure out how to make this happen. With all the engineers, and the business kids, I think the student body could make a killing.
Innovative Cold Engineering, Pittsburgh Grade Hielo
Dear ICE-PGH,
We also heard that the Sochi organizers were stockpiling snow, however you have beat us to the punch when it comes to monetizing Pittsburgh’s current predicament. Ryan has done some calculations regarding the melting rate of snow and Matt thinks we should leverage Amazon’s fleet of drones. We are still coordinating the no-drone rules in New Jersey, but the no-fly zone over Serbia was lifted last decade, therefore socio-politically we should be okay. What’s that? We only have two weeks to get 710,000 cubic meters of snow nearly 6000 miles?
CMU students don’t sleep anyway,
Ryan and Matt
Dear Matt and Ryan,
Within the past few weeks, all that I seem to hear about is that new movie Frozen. Everyone is obsessed with the movie, the songs, and the parodies. It never ends! I’m really confused and frankly, kind of annoyed. What’s the big deal? It’s that chick from Wicked in an animated movie about snow. As if I want to see more of that these days. Sure, maybe if I had a snowman and reindeer to hang out with, I’d sing about how I can pop snow out of my fingers too. But I don’t, so I’m not interested. Can you shed some light on this? What’s the big deal about this movie?
Convinced Otherwise L. D. HEARTED
Dear COLDHEARTED,
We hear you, and we get you. Despite nearly everyone’s obsession with this film, we are not convinced. Don’t get us wrong — it looks cute as a button. But the fact that our Twitter feeds have become one long page of lyrics about dancing around in the cold is just plain obnoxious. We wish we could explain it better. Really, we do. The best we can offer is to check out this new song we heard the other day called “Let It Go.”
Hang in there, you cold-hearted human, you,
Ryan and Matt

Warning: This article contains spoilers for “The Desert”, the midseason finale of The Mindy Project.
TV thrives on sexual tension. It’s just a fact. Sometimes, shows drag it out, season after season, using will-they-won’t-they plots to keep viewers interested. Other times, show runners will jump right in after a few seasons and try to play the series off of new relationships between characters.
The Mindy Project is, thankfully, the latter. At the end of last Tuesday’s midseason finale, titled “The Desert”, the FOX comedy brought together its protagonist, Mindy Lahiri (creator and writer Mindy Kaling) and Danny Castellano (Chris Messina) in a passionate embrace.
The catch? Mindy had just sent a letter to her very recently ex-boyfriend Cliff (Glenn Howerton) explaining her desire to make things work. And back in New York, Cliff realized his desire to do the same.
For viewers, that moment was a welcome surprise after a season of build-up between the pair. In fact, the episode showed them together as friends for the majority of screen time, and even the most casual viewer could see how well they knew and cared for each other.
Show creators are wary of these situations, in which main characters that previously showed strong romantic tension act on their feelings, because they fear losing what made that relationship compelling. A well-known example is the 1980s show Moonlighting, which saw a significant drop in ratings and cancellation in the season following such action on the part of its main characters.
The issue facing The Mindy Project now is whether or not Kaling can keep up that same tension-filled relationship after such a huge event.
Currently in its second season, the show has seen a huge improvement over the first, which was filled with potential, but weighed down by extraneous characters and situations that seemed forced.
Instead, viewers saw the formation of a true ensemble cast this season as the staff of a gynecology practice worked and interfered with each other’s lives. Each character seemed weird until another one outdid them.
Within the first few minutes of “The Desert”, it’d be easy to write Mindy off as insane, after she takes dating advice from Gone With the Wind and references Amanda Knox as “foxy-knoxy.”
But back in New York, only a few minutes later, nurse Morgan Tookers (Ike Barinholtz) is locked in the practice bathroom, and the reactions of the rest of the office staff may make viewers rethink Mindy’s status as the resident weirdo.
Sadly, ratings have not been kind to this gem, but perhaps the simultaneously satisfying and unsatisfying ending to “The Desert” will bring in more viewers looking to see where Kaling takes the fallout. If not, then TV is in danger of losing not only a comedy full of quality humor, but one full of the heart and meaning that is missing elsewhere on television.
Mindy Lahiri is both relatable and distanced by her crazy antics; viewers can sympathize with her everyday problems but also laugh at the way she deals with life. They can write off her dreams of a life lived like a romantic comedy, but at the same time wish right along with her. Mindy is both everyone and no one.
If you’re not watching, you should be. Don’t be turned off by a shaky first season or fear of the Moonlighting curse. The Mindy Project is a prime example of comedy that’s about more than just being funny.

A year is a long time to keep anyone waiting, let alone a rabid fan base hungry for a promised new album. Now, after multiple vague seasonal deadlines, bluestep artist Gramatik’s new album, The Age of Reason is finally here and delivers on the implicit promises made during the long delay. Bluestep is a combination of American blues and dubstep with extensive hip-hop, jazz, and swing influence as well.
The Age of Reason is very indicative of the new sound Gramatik has been exploring over his past few releases, especially 2012’s #digitalfreedom. The album opener and collaboration with ESKOBARS, “Brave Men,” features Gramatik’s biggest drop, with a bottom that goes right through the floor. While not indicative of the whole album’s sound — it certainly stands out due to its heaviness — it nonetheless makes a statement with its opening placement. This is Gramatik’s sound now: Like it or listen to something else.
Despite the move away from natural sounding samples to a more dub-inspired sound, there are many great things to be found in Gramatik’s new direction. The biggest benefit has to be the increased prominence of guitar-playing. Live, Gramatik teams up with a guitarist, and the addition gives his performances a human energy that is often lacking in electronic acts.
On “Torture,” the stomping track that Gramatik has been opening up his live performances with since the summer festival circuit, collaborator Eric Krasno channels the ghosts of every blues guitarist who ever worked their fingers to the bone searching for that one perfect riff. Not to be outdone, the drums on Gramatik’s backing track sound more like they’re out of a metal, rather than an electronic hip-hop, song, and punch right in the gut.
Other tracks that stand out include the funky “Obviously,” a collaboration with Exmag and male pop-vocal duo Cherub, and the jazzy-yet-heavy “You Don’t Understand.” “Pardon My French” has an extremely danceable and disco-like feel to it, which is interesting to hear coming from the artist who helped make a name for himself by creating a blissful hip-hop remix of Led Zeppelin’s classic “Stairway to Heaven.” 
The Age of Reason’s best moment comes at the very end with the groovy “It’s Just a Ride.” Featuring a calm duel of synthesizers and guitar in the beginning, the song then shifts into a rough guitar riff before finally dropping into a steady beat that incorporates all the previous elements of the song instead of exploding them off into a wall of bass. While his full-on remix of Bassnectar’s “Dubuasca” — a track Gramatik played live to great acclaim this past summer — was blocked from being released, “It’s Just a Ride” uses many components of it, especially the wispy and ethereal vocals in the background.
Being a strong and outspoken supporter of net neutrality and open-access to information, Gramatik releases all of his music online for free — often using Facebook and Twitter to share the link to his entire discography on torrent website The Pirate Bay. His songs can be found for download in many places on the net, including his website gramatik.net as well as thissongissick.com and bittorrent.com.

The 2014 Winter Olympics, which begin on Friday, Feb. 7, will take place in Sochi, Russia. Russia has made waves internationally with its harsh anti-gay policies and laws; recently, Russia’s lower house of parliament overwhelmingly approved a law banning the distribution of information about homosexuality to children, according to an article from CBS news online.
Although President of Russia Vladimir Putin has promised that the Winter Olympics in Sochi will be discrimination-free in response to backlash about the law, many Americans are worried about gay rights in Russia and gay American Olympic athletes.
A host of companies sponsors the Olympic Games, including Coca-Cola, McDonalds, General Electric, Proctor and Gamble, and Visa.
John Moriarty, a sophomore directing major, along with Jeff Kasanoff, a junior at Wesleyan University, co-founded Anything But Coke, a campaign to boycott Coca-Cola products to convince Coca-Cola to pull its sponsorship of the Sochi Olympics.
“Anything But Coke is an online campaign that I started because of the atrocities happening to gay citizens in Russia,” Moriarty said. “Hate groups across the country have spiraled out of control. For example, a group called Occupy Pedophilia has been kidnapping activists and gay teens and torturing them and putting videos of the torture online, and the government hasn’t been doing anything about it. Some of the leaders have spoken and said that [Occupy Pedophilia] is doing a service for the nation; they’re basically pouring lighter fluid over the situation.”
Moriarty hopes to send a message to Coca-Cola, and other Olympics sponsors, by drinking anything but Coca-Cola and pouring out the company’s products in public protests.
Last Sunday, Moriarty and about twenty others poured out Coca-Cola products — none of which they bought — at the intersection of Morewood and Forbes Avenues. Similar protests are slated in the coming weeks at other universities and high schools across the country. The next protest takes place next week at Wesleyan University. After that, protests will take place at schools such as Boston University and St. Michael’s College in Colchester, Vt.
Garrett Eucker, a sophomore vocal performance major, thinks that the campaign is trying to send an important message, but might be doing it in the wrong way. “I think it’s misleading, saying that people should be blaming Coca-Cola strictly because Coca-Cola is not supporting [LGBT rights] when it’s really Russia violating civil rights and Coca-Cola is supporting the Olympics, not Russia,” Eucker said. Eucker does agree that if Coca-Cola pulled their sponsorship from the Olympics, it would send an important message to Russia.
“Coca-Cola is not the villain. But they do have the power to make real change,” Moriarty wrote in an email to The Tartan. “This issue is complicated but it doesn’t mean it’s not black and white. We cannot support corporations who put profit before human rights. No matter who is suffering.”
Coca-Cola is one of many American companies to sponsor the 2014 Winter Olympics; according to the FAQ on Coca-Cola’s website, the company is the longest continuous sponsor of the Olympics.
“We are a business and our role as official soft drinks provider enables us to showcase the range of drinks we offer and sell these at the Olympics and Paralympic games,” the FAQ continues. “We recognize that attitudes to sponsorship have changed and we want to understand more about the social value our sponsorship brings. This is why we have been working with independent think tank demos to create a new model of sponsorship evaluation that looks to quantify the social impact of sponsorship activity.”
Moriarty draws parallels between his and Kasanoff’s campaign and anti-Coca-Cola protests in the 1990s. 
“This is not a campaign that hasn’t had a history of success in terms of boycotting Coca-Cola specifically,” Moriarty said. “In 1990 there was a series of protests at universities across the country that led to Coca-Cola disinvesteing in South Africa, and because they are a corporation that has so much influence politically and culturally, it pressured South Africa to rethink their politics concerning race.”
Moriarty also noted that the United States as a nation has boycotted the Olympic Games before. “We boycotted the Olympics as a nation in Moscow in the 1980s due to their civil rights violations. By not doing it now we are saying that these violations don’t justify it.”
Although the U.S. is sending gay athletes to the Olympics, Moriarty says that this isn’t enough. “In 1936, Coca-Cola sponsored the Olympics in Berlin, Germany, at a time when they were making their first anti-semitic laws saying that only Aryans could compete. We sent Jewish athletes in — some even won the gold — but they didn’t respond to the symbol because it isn’t enough. We need to give dictators financial incentive to pull out, just as we are giving Coca-Cola financial incentive to pull out.”
Moriarty, along with Kasanoff and the president of ALLIES, Carnegie Mellon’s LGBT support club, are meeting with a representative from Coca-Cola next week. “We have low expectations for the meeting, but hopefully from that meeting we can meet with someone higher up to see what they can do,” Moriarty said. “It’s a great sign because it means that they’re listening, and they’re hearing our voice, and we have made some influence — just 20 people pouring out coke.”

In the January 2014 issue of Dining Dish, Housing and Dining Services announced two important changes to the healthy food options on campus: extended hours at Evgefstos and new healthy menu options available at The Underground.
Evgefstos features vegan and vegetarian options not available elsewhere on campus. The eatery, however, was not open for dinner during the fall semester, and was only open until 4 p.m. Monday through Friday.
During Dining Services Advisory Council (DSAC) meetings, members of Undergraduate Student Senate brought attention to the popularity of Evgefstos and the demand for extended hours. Dining Services responded to the feedback by extending the location’s hours until 8 p.m. Monday through Friday.
“Meeting the needs of our vegetarian populations is an ongoing priority area in campus dining since [Evgefstos] opened in 2006” wrote Paula Martin, University Health Services’s registered dietitian, in an email.
Students have responded positively to the change and seem to appreciate the increase in healthy dinner options.
“I am neither vegan or vegetarian, but I think it’s a healthy option, and I am interested in eating healthy,” said Ade Odutayo, a master’s student in the Tepper School of Business.
“I think [the new hours] are better, [and provide] more options,” said senior mechanical engineering major Krystina Calfo. “I usually go to Resnik, but now I can come here instead.”
Dining Services is continuing to try to expand healthy and vegetarian options on campus by working with vendor partners to offer more vegetarian and vegan dishes at various dining locations.
“The past three years have included the addition of several new dining locations and seriously improved menus,” wrote student body vice president and junior electrical and computer engineering major Ian Glasner, in an email. “The food on campus is much healthier than it ever has been.”
The change in The Underground menu was also inspired by student opinions at DSAC meetings.
“Based on student feedback, Dining Services collaborated with our vending partner at The Underground to offer more healthy choices for students, besides the very popular traditional late night fare,” wrote Pascal Petter, director of Dining Services, in an email. “Although students can still order a cheeseburger or chicken fingers, they now have healthier alternatives to select from.”
The new menu items include more gluten-free options and egg beaters available for breakfast, as well as seven sandwiches, two salads, and one specialty item — blackened salmon filet. The Underground has also started to use whole-grain bread for the majority of sandwiches. In addition to these changes, The Underground has implemented a three-week rotating menu cycle that offers meal options under 500 calories.
“This cycle menu was launched as we learned from students that a similar menu offered at the Exchange, our highest volume dining location, was extremely popular,” wrote Petter in the email. “We shared this with our vendor partner at The Underground and the concept was emulated with positive results thus far.”
“Under 500 calories is healthy by the Underground’s standards,” Calfo said.
Other changes to improve healthy food options include fresh produce in Entropy+, a new noodle bowl concept for the Marketplace in the University Center, and grilled salmon available at The Exchange.
“We have to balance between offering our students variety and balance while also catering to taste preference,” wrote Martin. “The key here is ‘we offer’ and it is up to each individual student to ‘decide’ which menu items to choose and this is where the nutrition education and health promotion piece comes into the equation.”
University Health Services also contributes to improving students’ diets on campus by providing services to promote healthy eating and lifestyles.
“We offer peer education programs, individual nutrition counseling and education sessions, screening for disordered eating, and established the dinning icon program to assist vendors with menu planning that includes health-focused dining offerings” said Martin.
Housing and Dining Services has even more changes planned for the remainder of the semester, including premium dinners and theme nights in Schatz Dining Room, bento box lunches available from Worlds of Flavor, culinary showcase events, farmers’ markets, additional gluten-free items, and Halal options.
“I think we could do more for people with food allergies,” wrote Glasner in the email. “However, this is a difficult problem to solve because allergies vary greatly from person to person.”
For the upcoming fall semester, students can expect a nutrition app that will allow students to check nutritional values on any menu item from their mobile device, as well as more dining locations with revised hours of operation to reflect student demand.
“As the demand for healthy food continues to grow on campus, I have no doubt that CMU administration will continue to provide the quality of food students prefer,” wrote Glasner. “I am working closely with Pascal Petter, the director of dining services, to make sure students have access to healthy food if they want it.”
“We will continue to collaborate with students and campus departments to evolve the program based on campus needs and trends within the campus dining industry,” wrote Petter in the email. “As a matter of fact, I am currently developing a dining master plan and would welcome any suggestions or ideas that can help me make better informed decisions.” Students can contact Petter by going to his office in Morewood Gardens, via phone at (412) 268-9719, or email atppetter@andrew.cmu.edu.

Last year, about 100 Carnegie Mellon faculty sat down to decide what Carnegie Mellon does best. The list was narrowed down to eight discreet categories that have become the eight concentrations available in the Integrative Design, Arts, and Technology Network (IDeATe) program.
In this program, students from any academic background can choose from one of eight interdisciplinary concentrations, which include: animation and special effects, entrepreneurship for creative industries, game design, intelligent environment, learning media, media design, physical computing, and sound design.
The IDeATe program is headed by Thanassis Rikakis, vice provost for design, arts, and technology, and project manager Kelly Delaney. “If you decide that one of these areas is of interest to you, you go to your advisor and you say, ‘hey, you know I think I might be interested in doing some interdisciplinary kind of work,’ ” said Rikakis. “Then during your sophomore year you have to pass a portal course, and once you pass the portal course you have to take two courses within the list of concentrations.”
The list of concentrations came from a think tank of Carnegie Mellon’s faculty,” Rikakis said. “We had a one-year process for this, so we brought together some working teams from across all the colleges — about a hundred people — and they came up with the eight areas of strength that we have at CMU, and a list of courses. We have very good representation from all the colleges; that was the consensus outcome.”
Rikakis wanted the concentrations to have a low barrier of entry, so the portal courses, which are prerequisites to the concentration courses, are open to students of any major. Portal courses include collaborative, interdisciplinary courses, such as Introduction to Computing for Creative Practitioners and Introduction to Media Synthesis and Analysis.
The portal courses are designed to help ease students from disciplinary backgrounds into interdisciplinary work. Introduction to Media and Synthesis Analysis, for example, is described on the IDeATe website as “an introduction to basic principles for the creation of digitally mediated content, aimed towards students from science and engineering disciplines who have limited exposure to content analysis and authoring.” The course will have three modules: the narrative module, the visual synthesis module, and the sound synthesis module. All students in the course will complete an additional module — the critical analysis module — and then choose two of the three remaining modules.
By the end of the course, according to the IDeATe website, students will be able to “demonstrate the ability to think critically across several theoretical paradigms” and “articulate the relationship between Art/Design practice and theory.”
Computing for Creative Practitioners, on the other hand, is housed in the department of computer science and is meant for visual and liberal arts students looking to do more interdisciplinary work. The IDeATe website describes the course as “an introduction to fundamental computing principles and programming techniques for creative cultural practices, with special consideration to applications in music, design, and the visual arts.”
“You can do these from any major,” Rikakis said. “The portal courses are set up so that you can find the best concentration from the outside, and all the courses within the concentration are set up to be collaborative courses, so the instructors are expecting people from different backgrounds to work on things together.”
If a student working toward a concentration is particularly engaged in the program, he or she can take two more courses — in addition to the four required for the concentration — to make it a minor.
Rikakis stipulated that the main difference between choosing a concentration and a minor centers around double counting restrictions.
“If you’re doing a minor you can’t do that — you’d have to do some courses that don’t count toward your major,” Rikakis said. “We’re trying to keep the bar very low, so you can start it as a concentration and if you like it, you can make it your minor.”
The IDeATe courses were developed by existing Carnegie Mellon faculty, many who will go on to teach the courses they develop. Because many faculty are busy within their disciplines, however, Carnegie Mellon will also be taking on new faculty in the fall to teach the new courses.
“All of the courses are being developed by faculty from the working groups, but because many of the [faculty] are very busy teaching disciplinary courses and stuff like that, we are also hiring some new faculty,” Rikakis said. “We’re bringing in a number of new faculty to teach in this space along with existing faculty, but they’re all being developed by expert faculty we already have here.”
The IDeATe program will also be accompanied by the repurposing of a Carnegie Mellon building on the corner of South Craig Street and Forbes Avenue. According to Rikakis, the new collaborative, interdisciplinary building will be open 24 hours a day to anyone participating in the IDeATe program. The building will have a variety of spaces for everything from physical prototyping to media editing.
IDeATe project manager Kelly Delaney urges students who are interested in participating in IDeATe to contact their advisors and talk about registering for the portal courses this coming Fall semester.

“Lift every voice and sing, ‘til earth and heaven ring, ring with the harmonies of Liberty,” chimed the audience, led by senior drama major Tsilala Graham-Haynes in Rangos Hall in the University Center last Monday afternoon.
The song, “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” considered by many to be the national anthem of African-Americans, was used to kick off the keynote address by distinguished service professor of social and decision science and public policy and management Dr. Jendayi E. Frazer that concluded the Martin Luther King, Jr. Day program.
Carnegie Mellon celebrated Martin Luther King, Jr.’s birthday with classes in the morning and performances and speeches about diversity and remembering King in the afternoon.
The address featured two student speakers. Senior electrical and computer engineering major Vijay Jayaram delineated King as “a man who catalyzed a movement,” “a doer,” and a “drum major for change.” Jayaram also focused on King’s views on education, particularly the concept of moral education. He cited Martin Luther King, Jr.’s famous quote first published in the Morehouse College Student Newspaper, The Maroon Tiger, in 1947: “The function of education is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. Intelligence plus character — that is the true goal of education.”
Jayarum emphasized the importance of education to “understand the human condition before we are able to break boundaries.”
Following Jayarum, junior civil engineering major Millard McElwee spoke of his personal experience of being a “part of King’s dream.” Although he said that his experiences at Carnegie Mellon have shown that “true innovation comes from a variety of perspectives,” he also spoke of the need for there to be “more progress until [his own] narrative is the norm.” McElwee said that the best way to remember King is to persistently put the fight for equality at the top of our agendas.
The two student speakers set the tone for Frazer’s keynote, “Leading with Courage and Conviction.” In addition to her appointments in the Heinz College’s School of Public Policy and the department of social and decision sciences, Frazer is also the Director of Carnegie Mellon’s Center for International Policy and Innovation. She was sworn in as the first female U.S. ambassador to South Africa in 2004 and is widely credited for designing the Bush administration’s policies for ending the wars in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Burundi. Frazer was also instrumental in establishing many of the Bush administration’s initiatives in Africa.
Frazer’s speech called for a transformation of leadership, to return to a “purpose greater than self.” She defined courage as the “willingness to persevere, deriving from moral strength.” Frazer spoke of the process of turning faith into conviction into leadership. She drew examples from the lives of King, Nelson Mandela, and Mahatma Gandhi as leaders who led with courage and conviction, but also a willingness to compromise and change tactics when necessary.
Frazer discussed how we as citizens have moved away from the true actions against injustice, now settling for simply clicking the Change.org button instead of mobilizing a movement as King did. She referred to Harriet Tubman, who led slaves out of the South, as her personal inspiration, an epitome of action and leading with courage and conviction.
Student responses to the keynote address were overwhelmingly positive; most students found Frazer to be both intriguing and inspiring.
“I really like how she applied Dr. King’s values and beliefs to today’s society, and living life with a purpose and a vision,” said sophomore materials science and engineering and biomedical engineering double major Shreya Munjal.
“[Frazer] challenged [us] to look at the world from a different perspective,” said junior chemistry major Kevin Hunter. 
“She urged us to strive toward a better future for ourselves and those around us while holding true to our own ideals.”

On Jan. 10, Carnegie Mellon Emergency Medical Services (CMU EMS), after ten years of tossing the idea back and forth, was able to obtain their very own CMU EMS car. Former logistics director and current supervisor Evan Finkelstein said that the car allows them to transport equipment to any point on campus, making arriving at a call much more efficient.
Current logistics director and supervisor Blaise Loughman said, “The idea’s been around for ten years, but it started to make headway last year.”
Former operations director and alumnus Tim Bach and Finklestein were the main proponents of acquiring the car. They wrote an in-depth proposal to University Health Services (UHS) in which they compared the time that they could arrive at a scene of an emergency with and without a car. Additionally, they compared themselves to peer institutions such as Duke University and Columbia University, which both have cars and ambulances as part of their EMS programs.
After successfully convincing UHS that a CMU EMS car would be a beneficial investment, Bach and Finkelstein were able to make their plans a reality. Though technically owned by UHS, the car is authorized to be driven by only CMU EMS crew chiefs, who have to be specifically licensed to drive such vehicles. The CMU EMS Ford car is equipped with backboards, medical equipment, and audio devices that connect to the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire, University Police, and CMU EMS’s home base in Doherty Apartments.
The next step for CMU EMS, according to Loughman, is to acquire a golf cart so that they can more efficiently transport equipment within the campus.
CMU EMS is one of the most recognizable organizations on campus, with their 24/7 on-call staffing and direct support of Pittsburgh Emergency Medical Services and University Police. With its 25 current members, CMU EMS is required to be on watch 24/7, meaning that most members must work multiple shifts each week. The members comprise a wide variety of people, such as senior computer science major, executive director, and medical member Jeff Cooper, who will work at Google when he graduates in the spring. When asked why he became part of CMU EMS, he said that he “found a group of people that were also passionate about something big, like saving lives. It’s high stress, but it’s so rewarding.”
In 2011, CMU EMS saved a faculty member from cardiac arrest.
“When we see the faculty member, and she sees us in our uniform, she feels very thankful to us. It’s a great feeling,” Cooper said.
The achievements of CMU EMS have received acclaim from various medical institutions in the area that vouched for CMU EMS’s incredible response time — in many cases, if CMU EMS did not arrive as quickly as they did, the injured person may have died. Many of the events that CMU EMS respond to on a daily basis are generally not high emergency, but include injuries, intoxication, faintness, and allergy responses.
CMU EMS typically receives many more calls during the weekend. During Spring Carnival, CMU EMS doubles and sometimes even triples the staff that is available on-call, with different groups designated on midway, campus, and other areas relative to campus where CMU students may hang out during Carnival.
Recently, CMU EMS has been struggling with funding shortages. 
Loughman responded to a case in which he needed an EpiPen. 
He used the pen to treat life-threatening allergic reactions, that cost approximately $60, paid for by himself. 
Nonetheless, according to Loughman, adequate funding for CMU EMS is never a problem when lives can be saved and when people stay hungry to serve their campus in the biggest way they can.

Assisting an Outside Agency 
Jan. 17, 2014
A Carnegie Mellon student was arrested after failing to identify himself to law enforcement. 
The student was at a Beeler Street address, where Pittsburgh Bureau of Police and University Police responded to a noise complaint resulting from a party. The police dispersed the party, but were unable to confirm the student’s identity because he was carrying three ID cards and refused to cooperate. 
The student was later identified after being taken to Allegheny County Jail, and is being charged with carrying a false ID, presenting a false ID to law enforcement, and underage drinking.
Suspicious Activity
Jan. 20, 2014
A University Police officer reported a suspicious exhibit in the hallway connecting Wean Hall and Doherty Hall. 
When University Police arrived, a Carnegie Mellon student took responsibility for the exhibit. 
The exhibit, which used tape and construction signs and closed the walkway, was part of an assignment for class. 
University Police allowed the student to document the exhibit with a video camera, then requested that the exhibit be removed.

Committee Updates: Academic Affairs
The Academic Affairs Committee is planning a town hall meeting to discuss Faculty Course Evaluations. Academic Affairs is also focusing on Early Course Evaluations, which will be distributed soon. The Committee wants to get Student Advisory Councils for every academic discipline involved as well.
**Ex Officio Report: Pascal Petter **
Pascal Petter, director of dining services, gave a presentation to Student Senate on upcoming changes in Carnegie Mellon’s various dining locations. Petter showed plans and materials for new seating in the Carnegie Mellon Café, and discussed the recent push for healthier food on campus. The Underground, for example, has a revamped, healthier menu, while Entropy+ is carrying more fresh fruit. 
Petter is making changes to dining at Carnegie Mellon based on feedback from students, especially those on the Dining Student Advisory Council.
Special Allocation: Activities Board 
Student Senate approved an allocation for $1,600 to replace broken microphones. Although no Activities Board representatives were at the Senate meeting, Activities Board’s previous microphones were almost 30 years old, and recently broke.
Special Allocation: International Film Festival 
Student Senate granted $8,000 to the Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival to pay for travel and lodging for the guest lecturers and producers they are bringing in, including the first lady of Poland. The allocation was originally $3,000, until a motion to raise it to $8,000 was made. The Senate body agreed that the organization deserved the money in light of Senate’s history of granting their allocations and the importance of the Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival, which serves not only Carnegie Mellon, but the Pittsburgh area, and typically draws almost 1,000 people.

The White House recently released statistics claiming that just about 3 million people have signed up for health insurance plans through either the federal healthcare.gov or the state exchanges. While these statistics sounds like good news for Obamacare on the surface, Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini tells a different story.
According to a recent interview on CNBC, Bertolini estimates that about 70 percent of enrollees in Aetna plans have paid their first month’s premium, which activates the coverage that they have chosen. 
More harrowing, however, is the fact that only 11 percent of people who signed up for Aetna health insurance plans were previously uninsured. Eighty-nine percent of enrollees had their coverage canceled because of Obamacare and were forced into the exchanges as a result. This fact is consistent with a study by The Wall Street Journal that was also recently published.
Extrapolated throughout the whole industry, these facts reveal that of the 3 million people who have enrolled in private insurance, just 231,000 of them are uninsured people who will actually receive insurance because of Obamacare.
Proponents of the law will tell you that this statistic is not symbolic of the whole program because Obamacare also expanded Medicaid, which actually pays for the healthcare of lower-income Americans. Supporters will tell you that upwards of 4 million people have enrolled in Medicaid since Oct. 1 in the states that undertook the Medicaid expansion. Don’t believe them.
Medicaid determines eligibility based on income, and since incomes change all the time, people are constantly moving in and out of Medicaid. Senior elections analyst Sean Trende of political news website 
realclearpolitics.com estimates that only 190,000 people actually enrolled in Medicaid as a result of the Obamacare expansion in October and November. Add an additional 95,000 for December, and we get an estimated number of people who were uninsured before Obamacare and who will now receive coverage as a result of Obamacare. That number is 516,000 people, which is 1 percent of America’s former uninsured and 0.1 percent of all Americans.
Since the open enrollment period is halfway through, it’s fair to double these numbers and — to be generous — double them again just to account for any estimation errors. That number comes out to about 0.4 percent of the population. Imagine that, if Obamacare were around for five years, it finally reached an equilibrium of people who it is able to help out, with enrollments remaining constant each year. That’s 2 percent of Americans and only 20 percent of the uninsured.
Even with these incredibly generous estimates, Obamacare will likely only help 20 percent of the uninsured receive coverage. Getting coverage for the uninsured was the entire point of the Affordable Care Act. The government upended the insurance industry, canceled plans that had happy customers, cost people access to their doctors, removed top hospitals from plans, increased premiums, forced companies to stop offering part-time workers healthcare, and cut full-time workers’ hours to part-time. All for what?
At the very best, 80 percent of those uninsured now will continue to be uninsured. A program with a 20 percent success rate is a failed program by any standard. Do you get surgery from a doctor who succeeds 20 percent of the time? Absolutely not. Obamacare is not working and will not work. It won’t do what it’s designed to do, and more than helping the lower class, it will make the middle class suffer.
People in the middle class generally make healthy lifestyle choices and only need catastrophic coverage, which is real insurance in case of serious illness or injury — just as car insurance only covers accidents and not routine maintenance. 
As a result of Obamacare, the middle class saw their plans get canceled, so they had to buy more expensive plans to cover services they don’t need. The poor are eligible for subsidies and the wealthy can afford to pay more. Middle class Americans have no choice but to pay more for healthcare.
Obamacare’s effect on middle class Americans is just the most recent drop in the bucket of reasons Obamacare should be repealed. The GOP summit is ending soon, and we’ll just have to wait to see what policy solutions they propose to actually help the uninsured without upending one-sixth of the United States economy.

The Supreme Court is currently deliberating on a case challenging the 2007 Massachusetts law that mandates a buffer zone of 35 feet around clinics that provide abortions, according to The Boston Globe. Anti-abortion protesters maintain that the law violates their First Amendment right to free speech, while healthcare providers and members of Planned Parenthood argue that the law is essential to providing patients with safe and reliable healthcare.
The Supreme Court should absolutely uphold the buffer zone law, because restricting where people can voice their opinions does not violate First Amendment rights, as long as there are other readily available venues to do so. 
The buffer zone extends 35 feet, which is roughly the length of a school bus, and protesters can air their views just over the painted line that designates the area. Outside the buffer zone, people can do and say whatever they want.
More importantly, the Supreme Court should uphold the law because people have a right to access medical care without being afraid.
The lynchpin of the anti-abortion case is that keeping protesters off a certain strip of sidewalk violates their right to free speech. However, the idea of protest-free zones is hardly unprecedented. The Supreme Court itself has a buffer zone on its entire plaza that prohibits picketing, demonstrations, and vigils, according to The Boston Globe. Massachusetts institutes a 150-foot buffer zone around polling centers on Election Day. In these cases, protesters or private citizens can express their views freely, as long as they stay outside of these designated areas.
In the case of abortion clinics, the buffer zone is 35 feet, which takes the average person around seven seconds to walk, according to NPR. This space hardly prevents protesters from sharing their views, and gives patients a modicum of protection from demonstrators.
The anti-abortion protesters in this case argue that they merely wish to have calm and quiet conversations with the people approaching the clinics. The principal petitioner in the case, Eleanor McCullen, argues that, “It’s America. I should be able to walk and talk gently, lovingly, anywhere with anybody,” according to NPR. 
If all protesters approached patients civilly and calmly, then the circumstances of the case would be different, but the reality is that the space surrounding clinics is often chaotic, and sometimes violent.
McCullen was an ingenious choice for lead plaintiff in this case. She is a 77-year-old woman, clearly motivated by her religious beliefs, and so clearly not a threat to anyone. 
But not all abortion protesters have such a kindly visage. Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley points out that there is an issue of safety on a daily basis at these clinics, with patients often being verbally and physically harassed, according to NPR.
Abortion is a legal medical service in the United States, and citizens absolutely do not have the right or power to determine which legal services other people can have. Women have the right to accessible medical care without being screamed at or harassed, and without fearing for their own safety.

“They wanted to know who I am, where I live, where I work, how much I’m making, how many computers I have at home, why am I recording the movie, who am I going to give the recording to, why don’t I just give up the guy up the chain, ’cause they are not interested in me. Over and over and over again.”
This statement was made by the man who identifies himself as TU, a man yanked from an AMC movie theater in Columbus, Ohio for wearing his Google Glass, which contained his prescription lenses. For some odd reason, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) had been in an ordinary Ohio theater at 10 p.m. and caught him in the villainous act of wearing glasses to improve his vision, according to The Gadgeteer.
The man was held for three and a half hours and excessively questioned about recording a movie with his Google Glass, which had been turned off at the time. Strangely enough, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security — an organization created to fight terrorism — teamed up with the MPAA to investigate a potential movie piracy incident.
As wearables become mainstream over the next few years, the MPAA cannot have the right to violate the privacy of citizens and waste hours of their lives each time they wear Google Glasses in a theater. Considering the inconvenience it caused him, TU should be compensated beyond the two free movies that the MPAA chose to give him as an apology for three-and-a-half hours of interrogation.
Although the MPAA claimed that the interview was completely voluntary, TU states that he was threatened with “bad things” happening to him if he did not go through with it. In truth, it was voluntary — just as voluntary as the letters sent out to college students by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) demanding $3000 worth of voluntary settlements, according to NBC news.  
Trade organizations, such as the MPAA and Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), have become entirely too powerful, ruining the lives of hundreds by over-exaggerating cases of piracy and suing everyday citizens for all that they have. These organizations have created an atmosphere in which people cannot even wear their prescription glasses to a movie theater.
Piracy is wrong, as it threatens the livelihood of actors, directors, musicians, and developers. However, the five-year sentence and $250,000 fine for copyright infringement cited at the beginning of each movie is just ludicrous. It appears even more ridiculous when compared to the average time served by convicted rapists, which is less than six years.
In other words, current laws treat movie recording as nearly on par with sexual assault. While piracy is obviously a problem, it has been elevated to the level in which an innocent man has been pulled from a theater by federal agents simply for wearing smart prescription glasses.
The MPAA should look into working with companies to ensure that people cannot use Google Glass in theaters to record movies. Perhaps meeting with Google and adding a feature to their product that turns off video recording in theaters would be a better solution. This feature could be easily implemented by a Bluetooth signal if Google integrated the technology into its system. This feature would be relatively cheap, prevent the interrogation of innocent civilians, and more effectively prevent piracy.
The United States must reform its copyright laws to ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future. It must require the MPAA to have sufficient evidence against someone before ruining an ordinary movie night. In addition, it must force the MPAA to create new and innovative measures to prevent piracy, instead of instilling fear in the public and giving copyright infringers an assaulter’s sentence.

In Daxing, a suburb of Beijing, there is a curious building that is called a rehabilitation center. It is quite literally used to treat Internet addiction.
The facility is meant to be a solution for Internet junkies, whose population has risen dramatically thanks to the widespread availability of cheaper Internet and the popularity of online games, such as World of Warcraft and League of Legends.
According to The New York Times, the facility in Daxing boasts a 70 percent success rate. What does this treatment include? Well, it’s much like military school summer camp. Students are kept in dorms, guarded by adults. They abide by a strict schedule of physical activity and careful diets. Some are even periodically put on medication. On the whole, the camp is designed for patients to strengthen their bonds with reality.
In this day and age, Internet usage is everywhere. But at what point does Internet use cross into addiction that requires psychiatric help? It’s a very thin line that is somewhat arbitrary. Internet addiction camps exist to help Internet junkies reconnect, not to a laptop, but to life. Life outside the computer is something that educators need to start addressing. There are skills, values, and traditions to be sought outside of an LCD monitor, like physical activity, social interaction, and books — classic elementary school values that can be lost if computers are used in a casual fashion in education systems.
Imagine this: a student visits University Health Services. They don’t know anyone there, and they’re waiting for a doctor. Five minutes pass. What do they do? They pull out their phone and browse Facebook, their email, sports scores, and so on. They go on the web. Does this cell phone usage count as Internet addiction, or rather the more scientific name, Internet Addiction Disorder (IAD)?
Where’s the line between Internet use and Internet addiction? According to a CNN interview with Dr. Charles O’Brien, a psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania, any withdrawal anxiety or stress as a result of lack of Internet use can be considered IAD. In the end, adults need to make sure that children use the computer in moderation to avoid addiction.
So who usually suffers from IAD? Mainly, it’s people who obsessively play the aforementioned online games. In fact, many popular games are played on a professional level and include perks like sponsorships and television deals. Along with China, South Korea is considered to be at the forefront of treatment, especially because it deals with such high levels of both amateur and professional gaming. According to CNN, 8 percent of South Koreans between the ages of nine and 39, and 14 percent of those between the ages of nine and 12, suffer from IAD. Video games are becoming ingrained in the culture of South Korea and, as a result, it encourages Korea’s younger generation to start playing at an early age. Gaming gives children stimulation and determination, but there’s a point where children play too often and become too engaged. This addiction is why they need to learn in the classroom that the computer is a tool, not something to be dependent on.
If IAD is a real thing, how can it be stopped? The only reason IAD is a legitimate problem is that in countries like the United States, it is too simple to access the Internet. In fact, according to the Department of Education, nearly 97 percent of public schools in the nation have at least one computer per classroom. This number makes it so much easier for children to learn through multimedia teaching methods.
On the other hand, ease of access makes it very easy for kids to start playing online games. The reason IAD has boot camps in both China and South Korea is that these countries have high labor force participation. Since it is pretty normal for both parents to work high-intensity jobs, children’s Internet use often goes unregulated.
Perhaps introducing technology at a higher level of education might be a solution, for the United States, China, and Korea. The reason these rehabilitation centers work is that they force children to exert themselves in physical activity and other actions that don’t rely on technology.
So, why shouldn’t schools emphasize physical education, such as competitive sports? If children don’t want to participate in sports, then schools should start special interest clubs that involve the arts. Not only would this emphasis lead to a healthier youth, it would also steer children away from addictive gaming and toward more productive activities. Technology is most definitely a blessing, but society cannot let it hamper the development of our younger generation.

Last Monday, the Carnegie Mellon campus community celebrated the life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. with eight events planned throughout the day. Together, the events, coordinated by Student Affairs, made for a satisfying lineup of activities to engage the campus community in discussing diversity. Students read their work at the “15th Anniversary Celebration for the MLK Writing Awards”, and President Subra Suresh made an appearance during a listening tour on diversity.
It was good to see Carnegie Mellon’s Student Affairs invested in providing quality, educational events for students and faculty alike to attend. However, these and similar events nationwide sometimes fail to truly explore and evaluate the depth of Dr. King’s legacy.
As Americans, we sometimes forget the deeply radical nature of Dr. King’s work. This is partially due to the difficulty of acknowledging how blatantly and overtly racist our society was even a few short decades ago, especially given that racism still exists today. 
Though reflecting on Dr. King’s more straightforward inspirational messages is easier than evaluating the whole of his passionate and revolutionary work, it does a disservice to a great American leader.
Dr. King’s impact extends far beyond his famous “I Have a Dream” speech, and it certainly extends beyond some idyllic version of colorblindness, which is too often used as a crutch to avoid discussing race in America today. Dr. King utterly remolded the way American society works. He and other leaders of the Civil Rights Movement ended the absolute terror of living as a black American, especially in the South. For the first time in American history, mainstream culture was made accountable for the way it treated black Americans and all Americans of color.
It is easy to slip into the rhetoric that paints Dr. King as a passive leader, especially because he was such a passionate proponent of nonviolent tactics. However, Dr. King’s work was a radical example against thoroughly overwhelming odds of resistance towards injustice, a fact which should be reflected in MLK celebrations at Carnegie Mellon and elsewhere.

Entropy+ is officially going bagless. Starting next month, the campus convenience store plans to drastically reduce their use of plastic bags. No longer will students be able to carry out their purchases in plastic bags. Instead, they will be encouraged to use their backpacks, purses, or other reusable bags for transport. To ease the transition, Entropy+ will be selling inexpensive, recyclable tote bags.
The Tartan applauds Carnegie Mellon — and one of its most frequented locales on campus — for continuing to take steps towards environmental efficiency.
Non-biodegradable and crude oil-guzzling plastic bags are a major source of pollution and are devastating to marine life worldwide, according to livestrong.com. Many city, state, and national governments are taking action to tax or outright ban plastic bag use, and it is highly encouraging to see Carnegie Mellon following this trend.
With this environmentally-friendly initiative, Carnegie Mellon demonstrates its willingness to be active in pursuing change. Cutting out plastic bags places service to the environment before mere convenience, which is exactly the kind of prioritizing people everywhere need to do to protect and preserve our environmental health and integrity.
However, it is important to note that any step in the right direction cannot be followed by complacency. As a university known for innovation, Carnegie Mellon must continue to progress in its environmental standards. Whether it be large-scale movements such as improving facilities with more LEED certifications or transitioning towards clean energy, or small-scale movements such as offering incentives for students to reduce the prevalence of plastic water bottles, The Tartan encourages Carnegie Mellon to continue setting an example for what a green college campus should be.

Last week, Carnegie Mellon President Subra Suresh was invited to the White House along with a group of college presidents selected by President Obama for a workshop on expanding access to university education. One of the major topics in education associated with Carnegie Mellon is online learning, particularly our Open Learning Initiative (OLI), according to a university press release.
The OLI is described on its official website as “a grant-funded group” which aims to “create high-quality courses and contribute original research to improve learning and transform higher education.”
As Carnegie Mellon is considered one of the leaders in online education, it should strive to make significant improvements in online learning. 
Despite the potential inherent in online learning, its effectiveness has been brought into question in recent years. For Carnegie Mellon to make the most of its position at the forefront of online learning, it needs to acknowledge the existing flaws of this technology and pursue improvements to the online learning process.
The OLI offers many free, independent learning courses, with the aim of providing students easy access to academic course material and immediate feedback mechanisms. However, Managing Director of Guided Learning Strategies Dr. Frank L. Greenagel states that “developers don’t seem to be aware of how people learn, for they continue to use mostly flawed models,” and that “effective e-learning experiences for complex competencies are rarely scalable.”
In an academic paper titled “Comparing the Effectiveness of Classroom and Online Learning: Teaching Research Methods” Anna Ya Ni of California State University San Bernardino reports that of the classes evaluated “two of the online classes have higher failure rates as compared to face-to-face classes [and] ten percent of students failed in online classes, whereas only 4 percent did in classroom sessions among the six classes under study.” 
It also added that “the results indicate that failure rate is consistently higher in online research methods classes no matter who teaches the class: 8 percent of students fail in online class as compared to 3 percent in face-to-face class in general.”
Learning is not limited to information retention and test performance, but also includes improvement as a person. Online education may lack the social interaction and connection with professors and classmates necessary to attain this kind of holistic learning.
If Carnegie Mellon is to be recognized for pioneering a novel kind of education, it needs to acknowledge that education’s shortcomings. Additionally, it needs to be responsible in how it uses and presents new technology, and strive to provide comprehensive improvement.

I never knew the charm of spring; never knew my heart could sing.
Some days in a daze, there's brighter days. Funny how the feeling never stays.
Did you finally get a chance to dance along the light of day?
When all you want is friends, I'll see you soon.
Now as I look out my window, I see the world carry on.
You pick the place, and I'll choose the time.
You keep me searching for a heart of gold.
If we could take the time to lay it on the line, I could rest my head.
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you.
Fortune favors the brave. Make the memory the reason.
If you don't believe me. If you don't' like my plans, you mustn't tell me.
My bridge is burned, perhaps we'll shortly learn that this was arson all along.
