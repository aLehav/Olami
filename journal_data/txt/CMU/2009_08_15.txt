Carnegie Mellon’s athletics department offers numerous ways to stay in shape: get involved with students of different majors, ages, and backgrounds, and enjoy recreational activities: 17 varsity sports, at least 20 club teams, over 40 intramural sports, more than 15 fitness courses, and over 30 physical education courses. 
While first-years settle into their new college life, the varsity programs start pre-season training during the week of orientation, and the teams prepare for competition the first week of classes. Varsity teams compete in the University Athletic Association (UAA), which includes Brandeis University, Case Western Reserve University, Emory University, the University of Chicago, the University of Rochester, and Washington University in St. Louis. Introduced in 2007, Scottie the Scottish terrier was named the official mascot of Carnegie Mellon, but students and athletes are still called Tartans. 
Even if you were not recruited for a sports team, you can still exercise and develop a healthy lifestyle in a new environment. Adjusting to Carnegie Mellon life with a new home, new friends, new classes, and the experience of being away from the familiar can be challenging to many, but staying fit helps maintain a healthy level of activity and energy, will improve concentration and academic consistency, and can provide an outlet for anxiety. Endorphins are the best cure for everyday stress. 
If you want to get involved in athletic life at Carnegie Mellon, there are several options other than varsity sports, including club and intramural competition, as well as taking advantage of the athletics facilities, fitness classes, and physical education courses. The place to start is Student Health Services, where students can get information about better nutrition and how to adapt to campus food offerings. Creating a healthy meal plan will allow you to partake in athletic activities and maintain a healthy status. 
Carnegie Mellon seeks ways to improve fitness and wellness on campus and thus provides a weightlifting room in Skibo Gym and on the second floor of the UC, along with two cardio rooms in the UC — also on the second floor — and one in Resnik Hall above the Carnegie Café. There are ellipticals, bikes, and treadmills to keep your endorphins pumping.
Gesling Stadium is available to the entire student body during the times that varsity teams are not using the facility. The UC Equipment Desk, with access to the UC gym facilities as well as tennis and squash courts and Wiegand Gym, is open 6 a.m. to 2 a.m. on weekdays and 10 a.m to 2 a.m. on weekends. Skibo Gym is open from 6:30 a.m. to 11 p.m. weekdays and 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. weekends. 
Fitness classes offer opportunities to exercise in groups and enjoy the attention and motivation necessary to stay with a workout routine. Classes include abdominal sessions, dance, body sculpting, spinning, yoga, and pilates. A complete list of fitness classes will be provided on http://www.cmu.edu/athletics/university-programs/fitness/schedule.htm. 
If group classes interest you and you would like to get academic credit as well, there are three-unit mini courses offered for either the first or second half of each semester that can be taken pass/fail. There are also more than 30 courses designed for all skill levels, including personal fitness, racquetball, weight training, karate, aerobic fitness, and yoga, as well as courses for American Red Cross certification, first aid, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). For the complete list, look at https://acis.as.cmu.edu/gale2/open/Schedule/SOCServlet?Formname=GET_CLASSES&SUBMIT=Retrieve+Schedule&SEMESTER=F09&GRAD_UNDER=All&MINI=YES&DEPT=PE+.
Additionally, for those with more of a competitive edge looking for a light commitment, intramurals provide a way to stay in shape and stay on track academically. If interested, stop by the Intramural (IM) Office in Skibo Gym, which is located on the second floor, first office on the right. The program provides recreation for 6000 students of all athletic skill levels. There are over 40 indoor and outdoor sports offered. Intramural sports include flag football, tennis, golf, water polo, chess, soccer, bowling, table tennis, darts, and floor hockey, among numerous other options. Check out the website to get the complete list of fall intramural sport offerings. 
There are over 20 club sports available, including crew, lacrosse, ice hockey, ultimate frisbee, baseball, soccer, rugby, badminton, and fencing. The Explorers Club also participates in many other activities. Contact coaches and captains to get more information about joining the squads. For names and numbers, refer to the website mentioned above. 
Throughout the year, the Carnegie Mellon athletics department offers opportunities to learn more about fitness and wellness, and The Tartan will continue to provide key information throughout the year to help lead a healthy lifestyle. 
In addition to improving your own fitness, supporting the Carnegie Mellon athletic programs at all levels is a great way to get involved, such as joining the Carnegie Clan, an organization that brings school spirit to the stands. Cheer on the Tartans as they head into a new year of fiery competition.

As the school year starts again, one ubiquitous line exists in the conversation among students: “What did you do over the summer?” This past summer, 12 rising sophomores
coming from the Carnegie Institute of Technology (CIT), School of Computer Science
(SCS), and Mellon College of Science (MCS) gathered together in Mellon Institute
Room 357 for a 10-week research program — the Summer Research Institute (SRI).
At Carnegie Mellon, students with sufficient knowledge and passion in their fields are able to participate in some sort of research during the school year or summer. Programs like SRI, intended for those students who have finished their first year at college, show that this passion applies to even those students who have just begun their journey through college.
Maggie Braun, the assistant department head for Undergraduate Affairs in the department
of biological sciences, is one of many professors who strongly encourage undergraduate
students to participate in research. “In MCS, roughly 80 percent of the students
have had research experiences sometime in their four years here at Carnegie Mellon,”
Braun said.
Undergraduate research offers numerous benefits in one’s professional development.
Students have improved their “problem solving skills, analytic skills, oral communication
skills, and scientific writing skills” by doing research, Braun said. Anna Romanova, a sophomore biological sciences major and a participant in SRI 2009, said, “After SRI, I strengthened a lot in not only my hands-on laboratory skills, but also my critical thinking skills throughout the entire troubleshooting process.”
“I learned through our mistakes, and the fact that not everything works the way you
expect it to be — that’s science,” stated Siping He, another SRI participant and sophomore
biological sciences major. At numerous schools around the country, research positions
could be hard to obtain for undergraduate students. However, at Carnegie Mellon,
the door to world-class research is wide open for students who are passionate and diligent
on all levels. Students can take advantage of the opportunity and get a head start on what
they are interested in. 
Besides MCS, other schools at Carnegie Mellon also offer laboratory research for
their students. For instance, Kendra Garwin, a sophomore computer science major, is another
student who spent her summer doing research as a rising sophomore. Her research
is focused on verifying safety in hybrid systems, especially in traffic control. After this
summer, she claimed, “I’ve learned how to be more assertive in getting help and direction.
In addition, I’ve also learned a lot about the topic of research itself through hands-on experience. This is a time when I think I gained more experience-based knowledge than
book-based knowledge.”
With much said about the benefits and availability of undergraduate research here
at Carnegie Mellon, how can a student actually receive a research position? The first step
is to prepare a résumé and a cover letter. Most programs or professors would want to see a
student’s performance, achievement, and expression of interest through those two things.
In addition, as Garwin said, “Pay attention to any e-mails you get about internship opportunities, and send your résumé and cover letter to anyone and everyone you’re even remotely interested in working with.” TartanTrak is one of the most commonly used resources for jobs, internships, and research opportunities. Students can contact recruiters and send
their résumés through this system.
Even though there are plenty of chances, with many brilliant minds at Carnegie Mellon,
competition can sometimes be fierce. “Some of the components of a strong candidate
are a strong expression of interest and grades that reflect a good understanding of
the knowledge, although a 4.0 is definitely unnecessary,” Braun said. “We really love to
see students who articulate how the research experience is going to affect their professional
development. They can even start at day one!”

Dreams of space flight and deep space exploration have always been present in the
human mind. With the advent of modern technology, a simple and reliable method to
send people and objects into space seems to be increasingly feasible. Many methods have
been proposed, but the actual implementation of any of them still poses a major challenge
to today’s researchers and scientists.
One of the leading ideas suggested so far is the space elevator, which has the purpose
of transporting goods from the surface of the Earth to space. The concept is not new;
it was first proposed by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky as a tall tower that would reach into
space, with a large “castle” at the top of the tower. However, in 1895, there was no technology suitable to build such a tower. Today, the possibility of building a space
elevator is greater with advanced materials. 
The modern version of the space elevator would be an extremely long, thin carbon
nanotubule ribbon that would extend around 100,000 kilometers. Carbon nanotubules
are structures composed of carbon atoms that are bonded in a hexagonal pattern,
which can be rolled in a cylinder. This allows for immense strength and other unique
properties. Currently, scientists are working with both single-walled and multi-walled
carbon nanotubules, which describe a carbon nanotubule as one with a single rolled
layer or one with multiple rolled layers. 
Carbon nanotubules are the material of choice for space elevators because of their strength. A recently tested version of a carbon nanotubule had a tensile strength of 63 gigapascals, capable of supporting 6300 kilograms with a surface area of 1 square millimeter. When its density is taken into account, it has a specifi c strength nearly 312 times more than high-carbon steel. In addition, many different forms of carbon nanotubules are yet to be tested, and some have predicted tensile strengths almost three
times higher than the strongest known versions today.
Most designs of space elevators involve a base attached to the Earth, a cable, an elevator,
and a counterweight. Bases can be attached to ocean vessels, allowing the space
elevator to maneuver to avoid storms, debris in space, and other obstructions. They can
also be attached to the tops of towers or mountains, which would decrease maneuverability
but increase availability to power supplies and reduce the overall thickness,
and weight, of the cable.
The cable would be composed of carbon nanotubules, which would increase in thickness
as the cable increased in height. However, with modern technology and costs of
production, linking carbon nanotubules sturdily is not feasible. As cheaper and more
reliable and effective methods of connecting carbon nanotubules are discovered, the
costs of production would decrease, and space elevators will become more of a reality.
A space elevator would not be complete without the elevator, which has been proposed
to only climb upward using rollers, and essentially fall back to Earth at the top.
As the elevator ascends, it would increase its velocity, keeping a geosynchronous velocity
as its height increases. Solar and nuclear energy have been considered to power the
climb, but weight of the equipment for these kinds of energy is an issue. Researchers have
considered using laser beams to power the elevators, or even another cable to conduct
electricity.
The applications of space elevators would be numerous. Once an object is at the top of
a space elevator, its velocity would be great enough to escape the gravitational pull of
earth. Space flight and space exploration would benefit, as well as those with a commercial
space interest.
While space elevators are well-known, many other designs have been suggested to
put objects into space. Lightcraft are vehicles that use the power from lasers to propel
themselves upward. The laser would shine on the bottom of the vehicle, which would
generate enormous amounts of heat at that spot. This would heat air surrounding this
region and produce and upward thrust.
Launch loops are tracks that would use electromagnetism to accelerate an object into, or past, Earth’s orbit. The design is similar to the tracks used by maglev trains, which also use electromagnets for acceleration. Space guns have also been considered, which would shoot objects into space. However, this would require an extremely high velocity and would subject the object to tremendous forces, which would not allow humans to travel on space gun projectiles. Placing a space gun in a high elevation would reduce the amount of force needed to propel an object, but the object itself would still need to be able to correct
its velocity to stay in orbit.
Space flight is a relatively new event in human history, and technology is continually advancing to catch up with our ideas. Space elevators, and many aspects of space exploration, are only theoretical today, but in the future, they will likely become
a reality.

Welcome to college, the epitome of one’s time of independence,
freedom, and exploration. For some, this transition can be a breeze, but for others, such unprecedented personal decisionmaking can be overwhelming.
In the thick of things, it is not uncommon for your personal health to falter and your immune
system to weaken, especially when your dietary and sleeping habits change from optimal to
convenient. Unfortunately, if that does happen, you will not be told
how take care of yourself; every decision regarding your health will be left to your own wisdom. Here is a quick rundown of what to do when you get sick, so that it may allow you to quickly recover and frolic down the walkways of campus once again in no time.
The most common annoyance on college campuses is aptly
named the common cold. Viruses cause these colds; according to
WebMD, the rhinovirus is the cause of 10 to 40 percent of all
common colds. Because the cold is caused by a virus, you cannot simply take some antibiotics and be on your merry way. Most of you have probably experienced this sickness many times, with WebMD citing symptoms like a stuffy nose, sinus infection, sore throat, coughing, fever, or even some breathing issues. Medline-
Plus estimates the length of the typical cold to be between seven and 10 days. 
Almost everyone agrees that the best remedy is rest, and plenty of it. Be sure to drink fluids throughout the day to stay hydrated as well. Since viruses mutate every year, no two colds are the same, meaning there is no blanket medicine to treat the cold. However, you can
take Tylenol or aspirin to reduce the fever and cough drops or decongestants
to relieve other respiratory symptoms.
Just remember that colds, like many illnesses, are spread through the air or by touching
one’s eyes or nose with germinfected hands. All health officials agree on the importance
of washing your hands often, especially before you eat, and be kind to passersby in public by not sneezing or coughing without covering first.
Another common, but more dangerous, respiratory illness is the flu. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 5 to 20 percent of the U.S. population will catch the flu each year. Like symptoms of the cold, symptoms of the flu also include
body aches, chills, dizziness, and more severe fevers. In some cases, you could catch pneumonia due to the weakened state of your lungs. Luckily, the flu is more preventable. Flu shots are widely available, and Carnegie Mellon Student Health Services offers shots; last year’s cost was $15. Recovery is the same for the flu as it is for the common cold: rest, fluids, and over-the-counter medicines will work wonders.
One more topic of health concern comes in the form of sexually transmitted infections
(STIs). WebMD states that the three most common STIs are
human papillomavirus (HPV), chlamydia, and genital herpes. The first two generally have no
discernible symptoms in the early stages of the disease but are very harmful in the long run.
HPV can eventually lead to cervical cancer in women and to other potent cancers in men. There is an HPV vaccine available to help boost your body’s defenses, but the safest way to prevent any of these diseases is to use protection
when engaging in intimate activities. Chlamydia is caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, so
you can obtain a prescription for some antibiotics if needed. 
WebMD lists symptoms including a burning feeling while urinating
or unusual discharge. If left untreated, chlamydia can cause internal organ damage, or even
infertility. As for herpes, if there are warts on the genital area, you should see a doctor and abstain from any sexual activity.
Finally, here are a couple pointers that may save you (or your roommate) from an inconvenient health problem. Although at times getting proper sleep may seem impossible, you should not underestimate the importance of getting a good rest.
Timesonline.com explains that if you are sleep deprived,
or if you don’t eat the healthiest foods, your immune system weakens. When you get stressed out, take a quick 30-minute break and take a walk or jog. No time?
Cut back on terribly addictive websites where you learn about other people’s every action or
interest. Exercise also helps relieve stress and strengthens your heart. These simple philosophies can be surprisingly effective.

Aspirin aids colorectal cancer patients
A recent study has found that aspirin may increase the chance of survival for patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Previously, it was known that aspirin aided in prevention of
the cancer, but studies show that even after diagnosis, patients are more likely to survive.
The patients in the study were observed over a period of 12 years and were all diagnosed
with localized cancers. The study found that patients who took aspirin regularly before
their diagnoses were one-third as likely to die from the cancer as those who did not, and patients who began taking aspirin after diagnosis reduced their chance of death by half compared to other patients.

Antidepressant suicide risk decreases with age
The risk of suicide as a result of antidepressant use decreases significantly with age, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Officials have determined that suicide risk
is highest among children and adolescents.
Studies were conducted to determine suicide risk, which was based upon evidence of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Risk was higher with some forms of antidepressants than others, and the lowest risk is associated with sertraline, the generic form of Zoloft.
Doctors have taken these results into account, but they stress that all antidepressants
cannot be assumed to carry the same risks, so patients should consult with their physicians
regarding the risks of their particular medications.

Gene therapy may help cure inherited blindness
Inherited blindness is caused by a mutation in the RPE65 gene. Researchers have found
that by injecting healthy copies of this gene into the retinas of patients, vision was improved
enough that patients were able to see dim lights. This provides hope for both
doctors and patients, as this brings researchers closer to finding a cure for inherited
blindness caused by this mutation. In addition, similar techniques
may be adapted to other conditions, especially those affecting
vision.

New osteoporosis drug reduces risk of spinal fracture
A new drug, Prolia, created to treat osteoporosis, has been found to reduce the risk of spinal
fracture in post-menopausal women and in men being treated for prostate cancer.
The drug has not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, but the company
that produces it, Amgen, expects the treatment to cost around $2000 a year. Insurance
companies are already pushing patients to use the generic versions of current drugs, and it is unclear whether they will cover Prolia.
Despite reduced risks of spinal fracture, the drug has not shown evidence of reducing the
risk of non-spinal fractures in the studies that have been conducted.

Emotions conveyed in five-second touch
A new study conducted by scientists at DePauw University has found that emotions can be
conveyed through a five-second touch.
Participants were not told the sex of the person with whom they were paired, and they were
unable to see the other person. Instructions were given to try to convey a particular emotion,
and the other person had to guess the emotion. Participants were able to vary the location
touched, and the defi nition of “touch” included such variations as squeeze, shake, and
rub.While the study may not have much practical use, as touching is an intimate gesture, it is important for the study of psychology and science.

DNA reading made quicker with machine
A Stanford scientist has sequenced his DNA in one week using a machine and only
$50,000. Just six years ago, the Human Genome Project completed a similar task, but it took
them 13 years and over $300 million.
This advance, which is faster and cheaper than previous methods, may make it possible
for more people to sequence their DNA. While the costs are significantly cheaper, they still remain inaccessible for many. The machine used costs over $1 million, and a $50,000 price tag, which is based upon the cost of the machine and the number of
times it is estimated to run, is not affordable for many people.
In terms of science, however, it is a major advance that will allow scientists to study DNA
more closely and in a much less costly manner.

Alice 3.0 now available online
Alice, the programming software best known for being the brainchild of Randy Pausch, has
released a new version and is available for download online.
The Alice software is used primarily to provide an introduction to programming for people who have never had any exposure to programming and is often used to teach middle
school students. Alice 3.0 can be used to create videos and, at the same time, teach students
the basics of Java.

Galapagos wildlife threatened by mosquitoes
The wildlife in the Galapagos Islands is being threatened by mosquitoes brought by tourists,
according to researchers.
The southern house mosquito, which is a carrier of such diseases as malaria and West
Nile fever, has been carried to the islands, and researchers have found that the mosquitoes
are able to reproduce and survive in their new environment, which is bad news for the indigenous wildlife.
Despite attempted regulations requiring airplanes to be sprayed with pesticide before
arriving at the islands, mosquitoes have managed to find a way there. Mosquitoes have
been present in the Galapagos since the 1980s and have continued to arrive throughout the
islands since.

Carnegie Mellon — like any other university — has its own share of obscure traditions. Be it wearing kilts and playing bagpipes or squeezing into those tiny cars called buggies or wedging bottle caps into the walls of Wean Hall, not every tradition has a history that is easy to understand — but that doesn’t mean that, as a fi rst-year, you shouldn’t try to fi nd out more. So, here’s the fi rst step in trying to uncover some of the most famous campus customs. The answers and histories behind a smattering of Carnegie Mellon’s most cherished (and most confusing) traditions lie before you.
Scotland and Carnegie Mellon
Carnegie Mellon, among being a top-tier research university, networking center, and budding liberal arts college, is also one of the few schools in the nation that offers a degree in bagpiping. Andrew Carnegie, one of the two founders, was of Scottish heritage and harbored a deep love for his motherland, a feeling that is still present on the campus today. Bagpipers serenade the campus on warm evenings, the school mascot is a Scottish terrier (appropriately named “Scottie”), and a café on campus is named after Carnegie’s castle in Scotland, Skibo. As kilts are a trademark of Scotland, they are not an uncommon sight around campus as various students — and occasional faculty — celebrate the university’s heritage. Since coming to Carnegie Mellon, quite a few students have even expressed a desire to own a kilt of their very own.
Spring Carnival: Buggies, booths, and mobots, oh my!
Perhaps the most eagerly anticipated event on the school calendar, Carnival is a time for students to build, race, and have fun, though a lot of work goes into making it all come together. 
The first part of Carnival is the buggy racing, or Sweepstakes. Buggies are small, one-person vehicles pushed up hills and steered by a driver who lays down head fi rst inside them. While there are only two race days in Carnival — the preliminary and the fi nals races — a lot of work goes into making Sweepstakes work throughout the school year. Every year, on the Saturday morning of and Sunday mornings leading up to Carnival weekend, Buggy teams from different organizations, Greek and independent, will gather behind Hunt Library and all along Flagstaff Hill to do “rolls,” or test runs to perfect steering and braking. There are four different types of jobs involved in Buggy: driving the buggy from the inside, pushing it, fi xing and improving it as a mechanic, and providing support by helping to coordinate rolls. At Carnival, all the organizations race against one another, trying to see which buggy can get through the course (a circle around Frew Street, Hunt Library, and the Phipps Conservatory) the fastest. The course is divided into several different hills, each with a varying degree of elevation. Depending on what job or jobs students have, the tasks they do vary. Mechanics often keep “garage hours” during the week, pushers train on their hill, drivers drive, and support personnel do a whole slew of tasks, from being fl agmen to helping transport different items. 
Next is Midway. Visible from Forbes Avenue and held annually in the Morewood Gardens parking lot, Carnival’s Midway exhibit is a sight to behold. Student organizations who choose to participate construct a one- or two-story building or booth, inspired by a general theme. Last year’s Carnival theme was “Epic Adventures,” and past booths have been based on favorite movies, books, or events in history. The week before Carnival weekend is called “Build Week,” in which organizations pull their booths together after Move-On, the day when everyone moves their booth, in pieces, onto the Midway site. While Build Week is only a week long, preparations for booth begin in the fall semester. There is a student-run Carnival Committee that oversees safety, design deadlines, and sorts out which organization does what theme for their booth. Some organizations even start building parts of their booth months before Carnival, in order to make construction during build week easier and less taxing on their members. There are prizes given for the best booths in both the Greek and independent organizations, and these are always valiantly fought for.
Last, there are the mobot races, the most recent addition to the Carnival festivities. Started in 1994, mobile robots, or mobots, make their way through a course in front of Wean Hall — now you know what the curvy, white line is used for — trying to get through it the fastest without receiving guidance from their designer(s). The races, which draw huge crowds to the Mall, not only highlight how much more advanced technology has become, but also show how current Carnegie Mellon students are working to change the face of the robotics industry. By putting their innovative ideas to the test against their peers, students can take the reins in developing better technology.
The Fence: Best advertising tool on campus
Forget Facebook. If you have an event that you want the entire campus to know about, then taking the Fence is your fail-safe solution to getting the word out. Originally a wooden fence dividing the men’s side of the campus from the women’s, this Carnegie Mellon landmark has had a rich history as a social hub. Students have always been leaving messages at the spot, and gradually began painting them on the wooden structure. However, as time and the layers of paint progressed, the weight of the paint became too much for the wooden fence to hold, and it collapsed. 
Nowadays, modern innovation has blessed us with a concrete Fence, one that will stand up to the slings and arrows of outrageous paint jobs without falling down under its own weight like that last one. The new fence is claimed to be the most painted-on object in the world. The Fence is conveniently located in the center of the Cut, easily visible from Forbes Avenue as well. The rules for painting the Fence have been passed down from student class to class and can only be transmitted orally. These rules include the specifi c times at which it is proper to paint the Fence, how long it’s considered “polite” for a single organization to have the Fence, and how the Fence must be painted. Curious? Ask an upperclassman for the details. 
Keep in mind, though, that using the Fence as an advertising board is a great idea. It’s such a great idea that many organizations plan ahead before they’re going to take it. So, if you have an event and want to take the Fence, either work it out with the people who are in possession of it beforehand, or have a back-up plan. Chalking is another popular method of advertisement — as is evident from all the messages written on the ground everywhere.
Wean Hall: Concrete classroom or mecha in disguise?
Maybe you’re going to your programming class and noticed the bottle caps stuck in the walls. Are they an architectural touch or do they serve some greater, more meaningful purpose? 
While this “tradition” doesn’t necessarily have a set time to take place (unless fi nishing a soda is a momentous occasion), it has been going on probably ever since students discovered the bottle cap-sized holes in Wean’s walls. Computer science major lore states that when all the holes have been filled with bottle caps, Wean Hall will assume its true form: that of a Transformers-esque, Awkward Turtle mecha, capable of doing epic battle with Hamerschlag Hall or the Cathedral of Learning (your choice). While this rumor has yet to be confirmed by the administration, all of the holes in Wean are yet to be filled. 
Though one article could not hope to cover all the wacky things and traditions (and wacky things that are also traditions) happening on campus, it’s a start. The best way to discover more about Carnegie Mellon’s traditions is to get involved with organizations, whether it’s through Greek life, an independent organization, or with a bunch of friends. Traditions are most fun when they’re enjoyed by a group, and although Carnegie Mellon’s student base has a wide variety of interests, passions, and majors, there is one thing they all share: a drive to succeed in whatever they do, be it Buggy or Booth, mobots or the Fence. And that drive is perhaps the most cherished tradition of all.

When one thinks of Pittsburgh, one usually doesn’t think of food — except, that is, if you’re me. I am convinced that this city is the hidden jewel in America’s crown of cuisine. From downtown to Squirrel Hill and beyond, the diversity of flavors, ambiance, and prices make this American city a real winner in the world of restaurants.
Only have a few minutes between classes to catch an offcampus
meal? No problem. Craig Street is conveniently located close to campus and is packed with food from France to the hippie-land of Kiva Han. And, with the courage and knowledge to venture farther away (by bus!), plenty of delicious venues are located downtown. Don’t be afraid to wear a napkin as a bib and pick up a fork and knife while exploring the aromas and array of choices available in the offcampus food of Pittsburgh.
My first “real” restaurant experience as a first-year at Carnegie Mellon was during parents’ weekend in October with a delicious three-hour Sunday brunch at Station Square at
The Grand Concourse. At various stations set up within the train station-turned-restaurant, smoked salmon followed by eggs Benedict, unlimited cappuccinos, and a dessert of bananas Foster was enough for me to fall into a delicious food coma wherein my worries about my workload at college were soon forgotten. Call ahead for reservations, as the brunch is only on Sundays and is usually packed. 
Speaking of breakfast, I’m not afraid to admit that I am addicted to Pamela’s Diner. Inexpensive, convenientlylocated, and unbelievably delicious, this is the breakfast
go-to for Carnegie Mellon students (and, arguably, the entire population of Pittsburgh). With six branches, including Shadyside, Oakland, and Squirrel Hill, there really is no excuse not to go and try the blueberry and brown sugar pancakes, ham and Swiss omelets, or my personal favorite, the corned beef hash and egg special.
If Americana is not your thing, Crêpes Parisiennes on Craig Street is another option for that hearty fi rst meal of the day. And — ooh la la! — the paper-thin pancakes fi lled with savory meats and cheeses or sweet fl avors like Nutella or jam will satisfy every palette. Be sure to go full out French and order a café au lait or cappuccino to accompany your petit déjeuner.
And while we’re on our international tour of food, Lucca Ristorante, also located on Craig Street, is the best Italian around. Even if it is a bit on the pricey side, it’s the perfect location for a Valentine’s Day date or a way to coax your roommate into letting you have the bottom bunk. Gigantic entrees of pasta smothered in pesto or meaty Bolognese can be followed by traditional Italian desserts like tiramisu or gelato. Call ahead to reserve a spot on the outdoor porch, if the weather permits.
Kiva Han is the third and last restaurant I will recommend on Craig Street. Do not be daunted by the hipster baristas or the insane 45-minute wait you will endure to get your food. Kiva Han is a rite of passage at Carnegie Mellon, and every first-year, in my opinion, should be required to spend at least an afternoon with a hazelnut latte or green tea studying in this hippie haven. “The Hangover Cure” offered on the lunch menu is delicious — a rectangular burrito fi lled with hash browns and eggs and served with a side of hot sauce. The pastries and muffi ns offered as snacks are also a good pickme-up and better than anything you’ll get at that Seattlebased coffee chain across the street. Internet outlets and a study-friendly atmosphere make Kiva Han the best choice for eating well while still experiencing that good ol’ campus community.
For inexpensive late-night meals, a half-price food menu is available at Mad Mex, a short walk from campus in Oakland, from 2 to 4 p.m. on weekdays (except Friday), and every night from 11 p.m. to 1 a.m. Gigantic burritos, tacos, chilis, nachos, and everything in between are available at this favorite spot. Not only is the food good, but the atmosphere is young and vibrant. Be sure to bring your student I.D. to benefit from all the discounts.
For dessert, no pie beats Gullifty’s. Friday and Saturday nights often feature live jazz, and the crowd is always 90 percent locals, which makes for a friendly and fun atmosphere. The pecan pie, pumpkin pie, and turtle cheesecake are all excellent choices. This spot is also fun for a date or a night out with friends, and because of its late hours, it’s usually packed, so expect a wait unless you want to sit at the bar. If you’ve come during absolute rush hour, Eat n Park is only minutes away and also offers sugary treats, but try Gullifty’s first for a real Pittsburgh experience.
Last but not least, I’m afraid to admit I’ve yet to visit Pittsburgh’s famed Primanti Brothers. As it’s known for its gazillion-calorie sandwiches fi lled with the goodness of French fries, coleslaw, cheese, bacon, and other foods scorned by the American Heart Association, I’ll be sure to make this my next stop for a fast food dinner. Located at 3803 Forbes Avenue in Oakland, the lip-smacking entrees range from $5 to $8 per sandwich and the restaurant is open from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. Monday through Saturday, and until midnight on Sunday. It’s difficult to narrow down my array of favorite Pittsburgh eateries — The Original Fish Market, Ibiza, and tea time at the Frick Art and Historical Center are all fun food experiences I’ve had in this city. For now, take my word — go out and eat!

“Mai wan le! Mai wan le!” A Chinese woman hustled down the lengthy queue in front of a tiny but famous dumpling shop, known for serving up the best xiaolongbao — pork-filled dumplings that are Shanghai’s specialty — in the city. My friend Julia and I had been waiting with much anticipation but were filled with disappointment as we registered her words: The shop was sold out. The woman was handing out paper bowls to the people ahead of us, counting out the number of servings that could still be made, but as luck would have it, the last two bowls were handed to the man right in front of us.
Julia and I didn’t move. We had come a long way in an expensive taxi to Yu Yuan to taste these xiaolongbao — and now we just stared at each other, wondering what to do. Meanwhile, the man in front of us was motioning to a woman standing nearby — I assume she was his wife or girlfriend — waving his second bowl in the air and asking her if she wanted some. To our delight, she shook her head and the man then turned toward us and offered us the bowl, which we excitedly accepted and took several pictures to commemorate
the moment.
Since we were displaying quite openly that we were not native to Shanghai, our generous friend tried striking up a conversation and asked us where we were from. Now, although I have been learning Mandarin for the past two years, speaking it in a classroom and speaking it in China are two radically different situations. The Chinese don’t need to be patient with me, nor do they need to enunciate the four different tones in the language so that I don’t get
confused. They also don’t use the simple textbook sentences that I was used to. But, barring all these differences, my weeks spent in Shanghai had resulted in a drastic change in my understanding of the language. I was now familiar with making general conversation and since this entailed talking about where I was from, I was easily able to answer the question. The conversation tapered off and came to a definite end when it was finally our turn to receive a bowl of hot, steamed dumplings that Julia doused in vinegar. We grabbed
a spot on a bench by the lit-up courtyard and had our first taste of Shanghai’s xiaolongbao. It was excellent.
My trip to Shanghai was filled with many such firsts. It was the first time I was living in a country whose native language I was not fluent in, and the reality of this situation struck me the moment I stepped off the airplane at Shanghai’s Pudong airport. I was there for a four-week program to further my education in Mandarin thanks to a collaborated effort between Carnegie Mellon and Shanghai International Studies University. I had been warned by my professor at Carnegie Mellon that not many people spoke English in Shanghai, so I came completely prepared. I brushed up my Chinese and memorized the exact way to say Shanghai International Studies University Guesthouse to the taxi driver — I had been warned that if I said it wrong, he would take me to a completely different location. But as soon as the taxi driver asked me, “Nali?,” I was overcome by a fit of nervousness and mispronounced one of the words. I had to sheepishly hand him the written address to make sure he understood. 
Shanghai, which literally means “on the sea,” lies on the coast of China and is one of the most developed cities in the country. It has a fantastic skyline dotted with towering skyscrapers that light up in brilliant colors at night — not unlike New York City. Unfortunately, due to the large amount of pollution in Shanghai, the sky remains overcast with smog very often and seeing a blue sky is a rare occurrence. Not all of Shanghai is as well developed as the commercial areas, however. The city can be quite hot, dusty, and dirty.
While in the city, I often felt like I was an animal in a zoo. The Chinese stared at me like they had never seen an Indian before. Many of them chattered about me in Chinese while I smiled to myself, too afraid to call them out. Others tried to speak with me, and were quite delighted when I replied to them in Chinese. My American classmates drew crowds too. Their seemingly unnatural height and golden hair caused passersby to even bizarrely click photos of them.
While life in China took some getting adjusted to, one of the biggest adjustments I had to make was regarding food. I am a vegetarian, but that concept is pretty alien to the Chinese. The closest word I could find to describe my dietary restrictions conveyed that I could eat vegetables and fish, so most of the time I would just end up translating “No meat, no fish!” Even though I am a vegetarian, I decided to taste some Chinese delicacies and got a chance to try Shanghai’s xiaolongbao, Beijing’s Peking duck, and a famous pork dish in Suzhou. Sadly, not every experiment was very satisfactory. 
Towards the end of my trip, I actually started to think in Chinese. In one of my conversations with my mother, she asked me for a telephone number and for several seconds I couldn’t think of how to say the numbers in English. It is my dream to be fluent in Mandarin one day, and as I have experienced that the best way to learn a language is to surround yourself with it, I plan on making a trip back to China very soon.

Carnegie Mellon brings in students from all four corners of the world. Eleven percent of the student body hails from abroad, and we have representatives from all 50 states and more than 40 foreign countries; the school no doubt has its international prestige and allure. However, many new students find themselves discontented by the mundane setting. They come to Carnegie Mellon with the illusion that Pittsburgh is in a recession, an old cloudy steel city without much to offer. They spend their evenings sitting in the Underground wishing they were in New York City, and they only leave campus to go as far as Starbucks. As you traverse the campus, you might even hear an outcry, “There is nothing to do in Pittsburgh. It’s always cloudy and boring.” But this, let me assure you, is a big, fat lie. 
Pittsburgh is a great place to wander, and all you need to do is get yourself on a bus and explore. Here, my Pittsburgh neophytes, is a short lexicon to the hidden cultural gems and cool places to go in your new hometown. Pittsburgh has 89 distinct neighborhoods, which are sometimes difficult to locate. There’s Squirrel Hill, Shadyside, Highland Park, East Liberty, Bloomfield, Braddock, the South Side, Lawrenceville, and so many more funky niches and curious corners. Arm yourself with a trusty bus schedule from portauthority.org and get some help deciding on a destination with popcitymedia.com — a website that is a dictionary explaining all the attractions in each neighborhood — and nevertellmetheodds.org — a good Craigslist-like platform for artists groups, events, and all-around interesting gigs happening in Pittsburgh.

Consider this a shortlist of your bucket list, or at least my idea of what part of your bucket list should look like. The following are 10 events or things that all Carnegie Mellon students should strongly consider taking part in over the course of their time here.
Paint the Fence. Really, this should be something you do within your first year, or better yet, within your first month. But you could choose to get a little creative with it — such as sleeping under the stars at the Fence one night or, for the truly daring, maybe make it a goal to make a marriage proposal via the Fence before you graduate.
Reach the roof of each building on campus. Some may not be “easy” or “legal” to get on top of, but don’t let that stop you. Honestly, Pittsburgh is a beautiful city and at night you just cannot beat the view from the roof of Doherty, especially if you have a certain special someone with you.
Run the Pittsburgh Marathon or Half Marathon, one of the most well-run (pun intended) marathons in the U.S. There are plenty of perks aside from the actual running of the races, which take place in May and November respectively. In addition, you get to see parts of Pittsburgh you had no idea existed — and from a dead-tired perspective no less.
The Seven Wonders of Carnegie Mellon. This is a fun one. Some students have come up with a definitive listing of the seven greatest landmarks at this school. This one involves walking to each one — call it a learning experience or a getto-know-the-campus sort of thing. I can’t go into the specifics, but just ask around campus to get the details. 
Get a degree in bagpipe music. You can’t get it anywhere else. Seriously, we’re the only school crazy enough to offer it. If you’re undecided anyway, why not give it a try? Maybe a
minor?
See the view from Mt. Washington. As I said before, Pittsburgh is a gorgeous city, much nicer than wherever you come from, especially those of you from Philly (kidding!). Mt. Washington offers some truly breathtaking views of the Pittsburgh skyline and is an especially enjoyable spot to bring your sweetie. For a bonus, head there at night, when the city is lit up, for a truly picturesque sight.
Climb “Walking to the Sky.” Just think about the name you’d make for yourself if you do it during Orientation. People won’t know what to expect from you next. By graduation, you’ll practically be running this place. I really am just kidding, you know — unless you’re into that whole “getting arrested for acts of social protest against giant art on college
campuses” craze that’s been going around lately.
Riot! Seriously, Pittsburgh is becoming one of the most spoiled cities in the country in terms of winning sports championships, and odds are there will be a sports champion crowned by the time you graduate — with the obvious exception of the Pirates, of course. Heck, I’ve rioted thrice already.
Visit Fallingwater, the Frank Lloyd Wright house. No photo can even compare to the real thing. One of the most magnificent architectural wonders of this century is located just an hour and a half away. This is a must-see for architecture majors and normal people alike.
Leave your mark. I know this sounds cliché and all, but it’s true. There are more than enough ways to do so here: It’s as simple as fi nding something that works for you and expanding on it. Design your own major, show TBA twice per semester instead of once: It’s completely up to you. 
This list may have omitted some classics and included some odd choices, but take it from someone who is halfway done with something you’re just beginning: This place is full of wonderful little things that can bring you great joy — it’s just a matter of you taking the first step and wanting to experience
them.

Jack White — the man just doesn’t take a break. He wasn’t content with making blues popular again by ascending through the Detroit music scene with his pseudo-sister Meg or creating two solid American rock albums with Brendan Benson via The Raconteurs, so he decided to create a third band named The Dead Weather. Returning to his blues roots, The Dead Weather enters a subgenre of the blues with their album Horehound that The White Stripes simply aren’t able to create with two people.
Alison Mosshart, of The Kills fame, is the primary vocalist while White is supporting vocalist and mans the drum kit. Dean Fertita from Queens of the Stone Age is the lead guitarist, and rounding off the quartet is Jack Lawrence from The Raconteurs on bass. 
Horehound mixes the complex arrangements of The White Stripes’ Icky Thump with the darker blues of the Dr. John variety. This thumping, swampy atmosphere pervades the entire album, beginning with the very first percussive click on “60 Feet Tall” and ending with the
slow fade at the end of “Will There Be Enough Water?” While there is some variety within the tracks, the songs retain this mash of swamp blues. White manages to add a cover of his most influential artist, Bob Dylan, even though it is a relatively obscure track titled “New Pony.”
The most interesting aspect of The Dead Weather is their dedication to the various percussive bits that make up each song. Most notably found on the instrumental “3 Birds,” flourishes of White’s drums and Fertita’s guitar constantly find new ways of rearticulating similar ideas without sounding stale. Centered on Lawrence’s simple bass line, “3 Birds” constantly sees the addition of different layers and flourishes until it re-simplifies into an original idea and then starts repeating the process all over again.
While White is attempting to step far away from the limelight with The Dead Weather, which he attempted but didn’t successfully do in The Raconteurs, his command over the music is widely apparent. White is the primary vocalist in “I Cut Like a Buffalo,” which retains much of the quirky songwriting of the White Stripe albums Icky Thump and Get Behind Me Satan.
“Bone House” continues White’s trope of the home and homebuilding as Mosshart lets out bloodcurdling screams of “I build a house/For your bones.”
White’s drumming isn’t shabby either. Originally a drummer in his first band, in Horehound White reveals his immense ability to provide flourishes and fills when needed and just the right percussive touch that magnifies the tracks. The only downfall to Horehound is Mosshart. Don’t get me wrong, Mosshart’s voice fits so well within the tracks that she seems to disappear at times within tracks. Her voice is such a natural fit that the lyrics never seem to dominate the music at any level, and it blends in so well, much like Dan Auerbach from The
Black Keys — perfect for scrutinizing textures and sonic aspects, but lacking in forcefulness of singing lyrics. She is a fantastic singer, but she does not command any attention to her voice, except in “Bone House” and to some extent in “60 Feet Tall.”
It seems that Horehound was partly created to introduce Mosshart to the public, and while it will certainly do so, Horehound will fail to give her the spotlight and recognition she deserves for her performances.
While a sonically interesting album under scrutiny, Horehound is not an album for the typical White Stripes’ “Seven Nation Army” listener. The Dead Weather has created an album that introduces a more obscure subgenre of the blues to the mainstream. The band has not made an album that breaks new ground, much like The White Stripes never really broke any new ground in the blues, except Get Behind Me Satan. *Horehound*is simply a refreshing take on blues that unfortunately will not penetrate the mainstream for wide adoption.
The album’s diverse and constantly flourishing sonicbombardment will reward those who sit down and scrutinize the album with a good set of headphones or speakers.

While the Harry Potter series of novels is complete, fans of this magical adventure now eagerly await the movies, both excited
and a little worried about what the ever-changing group of directors will do to their beloved canon. Casual moviegoers also flock to them, knowing that the special effects and story promise a good thrill, not to mention the enchanting actors, new spells, and twisty plot that will keep them on the edge of their seats.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince makes good on all these promises and more.
With the original trio — Harry, Ron, and Hermione, played by Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson respectively — in their sixth year at Hogwarts, the fi lms have changed significantly from their inception. The three not only look older but have also honed their acting technique, making their performances in the sixth fi lm much more dynamic and convincing.
The film itself mostly adheres to J. K. Rowling’s tale, with a few scenes omitted in order for it to run in the allotted amount of time.  While most of these omissions do not detract from the fi lm, avid fans and purists might be a disappointed to find some of their favorite lines missing from the fi lm’s script. Some compromises aside, to the average moviegoer with a basic amount of Harry Potter lore, the film will seem like a sped-up version of the book. To the viewer new to the wizard craze, the film might seem to move too quickly and leave certain questions unanswered about the plot. Hopefully, this will serve as a lesson to read the book beforehand. 
That aside, the fi lm is masterfully crafted in and of itself. While in the previous installment, Harry Potter and the Order of the
Phoenix, the adventures into Dumbledore’s Pensieve may have seemed slow and too much like the other parts of the movie,
this is completely changed in Half-Blood Prince. Harry dives into a miraculous world of memories, fading in and out as the person recalls them. Quidditch scenes have the audience on the edge of their seats, while transitions between major events in the story refl ect the growing unease and rising tension between the forces of good and evil. Even small things, such as Horace Slughorn — played by Jim Broadbent — transfi guring himself back into a human from an armchair, or the reassembly of a ruined house, are given such attention that their details will amaze the audience. The cinematography and special effects, rather than leaving nothing to the imagination, actually end up provoking it. The audience will be treated to the wide variety of dazzling spells, extraordinary creatures, and thrills trademark to Harry Potter fi lms in a newer, cleaner light than previously shown.
As always, the acting from supporting characters is excellent. Alan Rickman as Severus Snape steals the show. His facial expressions, especially during a moment between Ron Weasley and Lavender Brown — played by Jessie Cave — in the hospital wing, are priceless. He has perfected his character, keeping Snape just as mysterious and oh-so-slightly ruthless as readers and watchers have come to love (or despise).
While Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince helps to answer more questions about the series, it leaves far more
unanswered. Harry and friends return to Hogwarts on a more somber note, with Harry harboring decidedly dark suspicions
about his classmate, Draco Malfoy — played by Tom Felton — and his allegiance. Harry once more stumbles across a strange
book, which claims to belong to the “Half-Blood Prince,” but he’s kept busy with schoolwork and winning over Slughorn
to probe too deeply into its secrets. Meanwhile, a dark plot against Dumbledore and the school unfolds, from cursed
objects to wizard duels, ending with a climactic twist. Overall, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a must-see.
Even for those unfamiliar with the story, the visual effects and the scope of the actors is enough to warrant a visit to
the cinema. The characters, whether on the side of good or evil, or those who are teetering between the two, are played
masterfully and the plot is sure to have movie-goers yearning for more of this magical series.

Dear Rohit,
I’m thinking about rushing a fraternity but I’m confused. I have heard a lot of good and not so good things about the fraternities here at Carnegie Mellon. What should I do?
—On the Greek Fence
Dear Greek,
Joining a fraternity isn’t exactly an easy decision, and I know this because I faced the same problem my first year. Fortunately, you have me to give you some advice. Our years at college are perhaps the most important time in our lives and we need to make the most of it. Fraternities were developed to help students boost their social lives so that they took some time out of academics — we all know how much of it we do here — and relaxed their minds with some fun stuff. Also, they help develop a network, not only with your brothers (or sisters) but also with alumni of the fraternity, who are ever-ready to help you out. 
There is a downside too, though. It takes a lot of work and time to gain and maintain membership in a fraternity, and if you are the lazy kind — which you shouldn’t be since you’re here at Carnegie Mellon — then a fraternity is probably not for you. So, just sit down and figure out what you want from your college experience and how much effort you want to put in to get it. Just remember that it is your choice to make and don’t let peer pressure affect you. Besides, you can always party with me.
Get off that fence,
—Rohit
Dear Rohit,
I am a first-year here at Carnegie Mellon and I’m feeling really lost. I haven’t really been able to make any good friends and I’m
clueless about how to spend my free time here. Can you make any suggestions?
—Depressed
Dear Depressed,
First of all, welcome to the Carnegie Mellon family. You’ve made it past one hell of an admissions process and should be proud that you survived — and that’s what you’re basically going to be doing for the next four years: surviving. Don’t worry about the lack of good friends just yet. The other first-years are most definitely going through the exact same emotions as you are while trying to jump the bridge from high school to college. We have a great system here at Carnegie Mellon to help first-years connect and interact: common housing. Use it! Start with your roommate and move onto your floormates, and in no time you will have a great group of friends that will last you through college and beyond. If you ever feel the need to talk to somebody, call your RA. They’re there to help you. As for free time, I suggest you jump with joy. This is your opportunity to get to know Carnegie Mellon better
and make use of the various clubs and activities that take place on and off this campus. So, go ahead and do just that. And  remember: if you need a partner for a game of Scrabble, I’m your man.
Game on,
—Rohit

In our minds, it can be impossible to unmake certain connections. Especially when it comes to music, particular songs and albums will always be linked with different periods in our lives. In high school, I dated a guy who fell for me because I could play every solo on Guns N’ Roses’ first album, Appetite for Destruction, note-for-note by heart. Imagine my surprise, then, years later, to hear “Sweet Child O’ Mine” blaring at me from behind the counter one afternoon at a bar in Prague. Imagine my increased surprise to see the waitress singing the song. Over the next few weeks, encounters like this kept happening. I started becoming paranoid, convinced that Axl Rose was slyly watching me from behind every bar I went to. Sometimes I swore I could see a braid from his cornrows peek out from around the corner. 
It had been a long time since I had heard anyone even mention Guns N’ Roses. A few years ago, when I was at the peak of my own rock-and-roll career (by which I mean when I used to play covers at dive bars fi lled with drunk middle-aged men), I would make a lot of Chinese Democracy jokes during the all-important but ever-doleful minutes of stage banter. Unfortunately, my pitiful attempts to keep the audience alive during equipment malfunctions and tuning disasters didn’t go over so well. For a while I thought the audience was simply misunderstanding my jokes, but I came to realize that it was just a subject that no longer mattered. Maybe 10 years ago I could have at least gotten a rise out of the guy who’s still pissed off about the Spaghetti Incident?, but even he had long given up any thoughts of
reclaiming Paradise City.
No, no one really cared about Guns N’ Roses anymore. In December 2008, after nearly 15 years of waiting, Chinese Democracy was released without nearly the pomp and circumstance Axl Rose had dreamed. In fact, if I remember correctly, it was only released in Best Buy stores. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity of lineup changes and bizarre MTV Video Music Awards cameos, GnR faded into oblivion along with so many other late ’80s–early ’90s hair metal bands. But then, suddenly, there they were again. I realize that maybe the way that rock stars die out is a sort of service to us. Years and years and miles away from my high school boyfriend and moonlighting gigs, I couldn’t help but feel oddly shadowed by that history every time I heard one of Slash’s riffs or Axl’s splaying vocals. I don’t believe that there’s any fateful reason for GnR to have headlined another summer of my life; I don’t plan on calling up an old love or dusting off the Strat. It was mostly a reminder that as much as we can (and should) keep moving forward, as long as there is “classic rock” radio, we will never be able to let anything die.

Soviet Premier Nikita Khruschchev drops in to Carnegie Tech as part of his 13-day tour around the United States. Standing through the moon roof of a student's car as he was driven around campus, Khruschchev probably enjoyed some of the excitement that he missed from being denied a trip to Disneyland.

An article on the new, computerized version of the card catalog features a photo of a student seemingly baffled by the new terminals. Apparently, the student had yet to attend one of over a dozen 45-minute long training sessions that would educate him on how to educate himself.

A Forum article discusses the changes on the Greek quad, including moving out a fraternity and moving in special interest housing for first-years. The writer is angry about rumors that the university will abolish all Greek organizations, and insists that fraternities and first-years can co-exist.

A new dining plan requiring students to purchase meals in pre-determined blocks causes many students to speak out against the plan. Previous plans had associated money values to blocks, but with the new plan, students were required to purchase full meals and could no longer spend their blocks on cookies and soda.

In this week's A Person's Opinion, we asked people what their favorite grade in school or year of college was. One response cited preschool as the best time because "we had crushes on our teachers." One graduate student said seventh grade because "I had lots of friends and liked school more."

The Computer Science Department is all grown up and moved out of Wean Hall. The Gates Hillman Complex, the department’s new home, is now ready for the 2009–2010 school year. 
The complex will add a major auditorium; new classrooms, clusters, offices, laboratories, and conference rooms; landscaping in place of undeveloped land; more parking; significantly more green space; and new traffic flow patterns across campus.
“It will be a great to have a place that computer science can call its own,” said Karalyn Baca, a junior computer science major. “I’ve seen a lot of digital renderings of the Gates Hillman Complex, but I’m just looking forward to seeing the actual buildings.”
Some parts of the complex are not yet ready, such as the Randy Pausch Memorial Footbridge and the exterior skin, which are set to be completed by the Sept. 22 opening ceremony. 
All parking and landscaping work is expected to be completed in October.
Move-in to the complex began on Aug. 10 and is expected to continue until the first day of classes, so that it will be ready for students.
“Consider that we only started planning for the buildings in 2004, and we only selected our architects in 2005,” said Randy Bryant, dean of the School of Computer Science.
Marc Scogin Merrill Elam Architects, an Atlanta-based firm responsible for buildings on other university campuses, such as Arizona State University and University of California at Berkeley, was assigned to the project.
Construction remained on schedule for completion in summer 2009 throughout the economic difficulties of the past few years. 
All of the funding had been set in place before the downslide of the economy hit campus. Bryant said that attention had to be paid to sticking to the budget, but that building quality was never compromised.
“The economy has given some extra motivation to finish the project on time so that the University can more quickly recover overhead from the sponsored research that will take place in the building,” said Guy Blelloch, professor and associate dean of planning for the School of Computer Science (SCS), as well as chair of the SCS Program Committee for the complex. “This being said, we did have to forgo some options which might have been included in a better economy.”
The Gates Center for Computer Science was funded by an initial gift of $20 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Hillman Center for Future-Generation Technologies was supported by a $10 million gift from the Henry L. Hillman Foundation.
The complex occupies the space between the Purnell Center for the Arts and the west side of campus. 
The Gates Center is on the south side and faces the Cut, and the Hillman Center is on the north side adjacent to Forbes Avenue.
“Surely the biggest challenge has been the site. It is a geographically complicated site, dropping 75 feet from the highest point on the Cut to the lowest point between Doherty and Newell-Simon Halls,” said Blelloch.
The complex is about 210,000 square feet in size, with 150,000 occupied by the Gates Center and 60,000 taken by the Hillman Center. The interior is composed of 310 offices, 32 laboratories, 11 conference rooms, 10 classrooms, an auditorium with a 150-person seating capacity, and 8000 square feet of open project space, along with the Planetary Robotics Center.
“It is a striking building both inside and out, and it provides a new set of connections between the main campus, the Cut, and the emerging west campus: Newell-Simon, Wean, and the [Collaborative Innovation Center],” Bryant said.
Set to be complete by the Sept. 22 ceremony, the skin represents a stark contrast to the main campus’s yellow-brick look devised by architect Henry Hornbostel.
Like the skin, the Randy Pausch Memorial Footbridge is almost complete.
The bridge connects the Gates Center for Computer Science to the Cut, representing Pausch’s role as a bridge between computer science and the arts. 
The bridge has been delayed by new plans to add an enhanced railing and lighting system to make it an adequate memorial for Pausch, Bryant said. The railings are expected to feature LED lights that can be programmed to change colors. The hope is for the railing to become a sort of virtual Fence.
In addition to the bridge, the building has many other connections around campus.
“The flow patterns around campus will change fundamentally,” Bryant said. “The building has five main entrances: Forbes, behind Warner Hall, across the Pausch Bridge from Purnell, via a raised bridge from Newell-Simon, and from the newly formed quadrangle consisting of CIC, Smith/Hamburg, Gates, and Newell-Simon. Inside is a series of hallways and a spiraling ramp that enables people to flow into and out of these five portals.”
Blelloch and Baca mentioned some of the complex’s many other contributions.
“The new complex is supposed to integrate a lot of green building practices, so it will be interesting to see how those are implemented in the new building,” Baca said.
The complex was built in the hopes of obtaining a LEED certification for its attention paid to the environment, like many other main campus buildings, including the campus’s newest dorm, Stever House.

Today, about 1500 first-years have been unleashed onto campus. The cluster of boxes and parents from move-in day will soon be replaced with tie-dyed shirts, loud house cheers, a stacked social calendar, and an enthusiastic Orientation staff as Orientation 2009: Unleashed commences.
“Unleashed is all about breaking free,” said Maria Mauro, a senior public policy and management major and one of six Head Orientation Counselors (HOCs) for this year’s events. “We’re hoping that Orientation serves as a time when first-years can try new things and discover how to unleash their potential here at CMU.”
The theme fits well with the university’s official new mascot, a Scottish Terrier named Scotty. Scotty made an appearance at spring training for this year’s Orientation counselors (OCs), and will be making cameo appearances throughout this week’s Orientation events.
The theme also complements plans by Rotimi Abimbola and Adam Klein, current Student Body President and Student Body Vice President, and the Carnegie Clan, a club that aims to build up school spirit on campus.
This year’s Orientation events will begin today and continue through Sunday, Aug. 23, the day before the first day of classes.
Move-in day events are for both parents and students, and include an address by Carnegie Mellon President Jared L. Cohon officially welcoming the Class of 2013+ to campus, a Greek life information session, and programs for each of the academic colleges, just to name a few.
As of 8 p.m. on Sunday night, events for parents have ended and first-years have their first floor meetings where they meet their OCs and resident assistants (RAs).
Monday is filled with orientation activities held by residential houses during the day. At night comes one of Orientation’s most anticipated annual events: Playfair. Playfair gathers the entire Orientation staff and the Class of 2013+ in Gesling Stadium for a night of cheering and a series of hilarious icebreakers that offer a chance to meet tons of new first-years.
“I am most excited for Playfair,” said Megan Sasinoski, a junior economics major and OC for Mudge House. “I was nervous about it during my orientation because our OCs said we would meet so many people at once. It was actually really fun, so I feel lucky to be able to do it again.”
Tuesday is just as eventful a day, kicking off the morning with another annual anticipated event: Community Collage. All of the class of 2013+ will gather in the Baker Tent as current students offer up stories of their lives both on-campus and off that have shaped who they are today.
“Attend as many events as you can,” said Rebecca Hirsch, a junior social and decision sciences major and Orientation leader (OL) for the Hill, to this year’s first-years. “You’ll meet new people with similar interests and meeting new people is the best part of Orientation. You’ll be surprised how many good friends you’ll meet during just the first week of being at Carnegie Mellon that you’ll have all throughout college.”
A performance by mentalist Craig Karges will round out Tuesday’s events. Karges is internationally well-known for his illusionist, future-telling, and other magical abilities. His performance will be followed by desserts with the Greek community.
“The best advice for freshman going through Orientation is to just have a good attitude,” said Emily Boncek, a sophomore mathematical sciences major. “It sounds really simple but it pretty much applies for everything because if you have the attitude that Orientation is lame or that it’s just going to be a bunch of awkward and boring activities, then you’re already setting yourself up for a bad experience.”
Sasinoski agreed.
“It’s so much better if you aren’t scared or worried about acting like a dork,” she said.
The academic side of campus comes out on Thursday as the day is taken up by college-specific events and the afternoon brings the time-honored tradition of Convocation. 
Convocation officially welcomes all members of the incoming class into their respective colleges as part of our academic community. Convocation is the last time all of the Class of 2013+ will be gathered together until Commencement.
With Friday comes time for one of Orientation’s most anticipated events: House Wars. Preparation for House Wars begins early in the day with transformation into house colors through face makeup, tie-dyed shirts, tying bandannas and more. 
First-years gather early with the Orientation staff to practice house cheers and prepare for their processional onto the Cut.
“I had such a great time at my House Wars and I can’t wait to see all the freshmen enjoy it as much as I did,” said Erin Delaney, a junior economics major and OC for Morewood E-Tower.
“My favorite visual during the week is watching seas of people in colored gear walking onto the Cut screaming at the top of their lungs for House Wars,” Mauro said.
Sunday has informal events throughout the day, and the choice is up to first-years as to what they want to do. At the floor meetings on Sunday night, first-years say goodbye to their OCs and prepare for the first day of classes on Monday.
“Orientation is about building relationships, connecting to your community, trying new things, and of course having fun,” Mauro said. “At that Sunday night before classes, my goal is to have the first-years feel comfortable, proud to be a part of this community, and that Carnegie Mellon is beginning to feel like home.”
Hirsch mentioned that the fun should not stop after Orientation.
“Carnegie Mellon is amazing but challenging. Always make sure that you balance your schedule so that you can have time for fun,” she said to first-years.
Welcome home, Class of 2013+.

Throughout this week, first-years will be reminded often about the importance of their Carnegie Mellon ID cards and the importance of not losing that ID. Along with providing access to most of their dormitories and being a key to their room, the Carnegie Mellon ID does so much more!
Many first-year students may open a checking account for the first time, and having an extra debit card to carry around may seem inconvenient. PNC Bank offers students the option to link their checking accounts directly to their IDs. Students simply have to access their PNC checking
accounts online, and follow the directions in the Account Services section.
“This option is great for Carnegie Mellon students who want convenient access to their PNC checking accounts,” said Michelle Loppert, a PNC branch representative. “Linking their accounts to their cards essentially enables students to treat their ID cards as a debit or credit card. Hopefully first-years will be forced to realize the importance of keeping track of their belongings early, and also how to prevent fraudulent spending.”
One thing students won’t be spending money on is bus fare; our IDs also serve as a free pass for all campus and Pittsburgh Port Authority Transit buses. The white bus icon on the ID lets bus drivers know that students can ride for free. Take a bus downtown and discover that our ID also provides free access to a romantic view of the city, the historic and famous Duquesne Incline.
Along with a trip to the Incline students enjoy free access to many Pittsburgh attractions, including the Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens — located just behind our campus, the Carnegie Museum of Art, the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, the Carnegie Science Center, the Andy Warhol Museum, the Mattress Factory — another contemporary museum, the Frick, and the National Aviary.
The ID also serves as the students’ dining pass — all first-years are required to sign up for a meal plan. That meal plan will likely include meal blocks and DineXtra dollars that can be used anytime for food a la carte or in Entropy+ as well. Students can use  this facility by simply handing over their card to food service cashiers to be swiped.
A new feature with this year’s dining is that DineX can now be used to purchase food in the vending machines of University-owned residential buildings.
Another way to spend money with the ID card is with PlaidCa$h.
“I would encourage parents to use the PlaidCa$h system with their kids since they will know exactly what the money is being spent on,” says Francisco Santiago, a resident assistant and junior mechanical engineer. “PlaidCa$h can be used basically anywhere on campus to buy food, art supplies, clothes from the bookstore, and any school supplies you need. But you can also spend PlaidCa$h at Giant Eagle [the local grocery store] too.”
There are also a few other off-campus locations that currently accept PlaidCa$h as a form of payment, such as the Starbucks on the corner and Forbes Avenue and Craig Street, and Maximum Flavor, a popular restaurant known for its good food and cheap prices.
“The only catch about PlaidCa$h is that you have to spend it where it’s accepted, and you don’t get any of it back,” said Santiago. “So it’s good for students whose parents want to give them PlaidCa$h because they never have to spend their own money on campus. All the money you work for goes to you.”
The PlaidCa$h account is accessed through the ID card and money can be added by going to the PlaidCa$h site on Carnegie Mellon’s website.
For an additional $45 students can join the Student Advantage program which provides significant discounts to various clothing stores and services, such as Footlocker and Greyhound. 
The ID would have a Student Advantage number printed onto the back of the card that can be 
entered in for a discount whenever shopping online or in person.
There are many other daily uses for the Carnegie Mellon ID. Along with providing access to their dorm rooms, the ID also serves as a key to most academic buildings after hours and allows students to use the laundry facilities. Students can also enjoy free use of both the Wiegand and Skibo gyms.
The ID serves as a tool for students to utilize the printing services in campus and residential clusters, and is necessary for picking up packages at the parcel pick-up office in the basement of the University Center.
Basically, the ID is valuable, especially since a lost ID means paying a $25 fee to have a new one printed. A good way to not lose it is to purchase a cardholder and a lanyard from either the Card Office or the bookstore, both of which accept PlaidCa$h.

When most people hear the name Carnegie Mellon, there are more or less two usual reactions. The first is a blank look, followed by the question of where exactly Carnegie Mellon is located. 
The other typical response is something along the lines of, “oh, in Pittsburgh, right?” What people don’t realize, however, is that Carnegie Mellon has campuses located in cities other than Pittsburgh, namely, a growing campus in the aptly-named Education City in Doha, Qatar.
Carnegie Mellon’s campus joined Education City in 2004, or CMU-Q as it is often known, at the invitation of the Qatar Foundation. The campus joined that of other well-regarded institutions such as Northwestern, Georgetown, Cornell, Texas A&M, and Virginia Commonwealth. Carnegie Mellon students now have the opportunity to study abroad in Qatar, while retaining the comfort of the familiar name of Carnegie Mellon. Undergraduate programs are available in computer science, information systems, and business, while graduate students also have research opportunities.
The study-abroad program offers more than just the chance for students to further their education; however, it is the chance for Carnegie Mellon students to experience a new culture and interact with people from many different countries.
“Our students enrolled in Doha are from all over the world: Qatar, the Middle East, and even the United States. We also have many students from Doha each semester who come to Pittsburgh to study,” explained Renee Camerlengo, Associate Dean of Student Affairs.
In addition to an involved academic curriculum and the opportunity to interact with a diverse student body, studying at CMU-Q offers students the chance to get involved with the local culture in Doha and really experience the quickly-growing city.
“The strength of the CMU-Qatar community is its commitment to giving back to the community.
Carnegie Mellon students regularly tutor local high-schoolers in computer science, teach the construction workers building Education City literacy, and volunteer with autistic children of immigrant families,” enthused Jessica Dickinson Goodman, Junior Ethics, History, and Public Policy major.
Carnegie Mellon students who had the opportunity to visit the campus in Education City emphasized the importance of the new experiences they participated in while in Qatar.
“Studying abroad in Doha offers the opportunity to gain some first-hand experience with a part of the world that a lot of people don’t know much about. It’s a really dynamic and rapidly-changing city, with a lot of cultural offerings. 
While there are plenty of things to do in Doha, other interesting places, like Dubai and Egypt, are only a short trip away,” stated Jennifer Marlow, doctorate student in Human-Computer Interaction. The new experiences are only further emphasized by the diverse mix of American and Middle Eastern traditions that Education City is composed of.
“Where else can you start your day drinking karak (tea) with a view of the Corniche and Doha Bay, attend a lecture on the history of Islam in the morning, have Pizza Hut for lunch, work on programming in the afternoon, cheer at an evening cricket match between Carnegie Mellon and Georgetown, and then enjoy kebabs on a traditional dhow boat cruise?” questions Marlow.

Welcome to Pittsburgh, also known as Sixburgh, City of Champions.
I’m sure when many of you began your search for the perfect college, you looked at more than just the university itself: You looked at the city in which the school was located. There’s a good chance you also visited the school, not only to see what the college itself looked like, but to figure out what kind of area it was near, whether it was part of a city scene or a more laid-back suburban area.
And when you visited, or read about, Carnegie Mellon’s atmosphere, I’m sure they told you about the many benefits or being in Oakland — the restaurants and coffee shops, its proximity to the University of Pittsburgh, its position on a bus route that can take you downtown or to the Waterfront — the list goes on and on. They may have even mentioned the chance you’d have to go watch some of Pittsburgh’s sports teams — a football game with the Steelers, a hockey game with the Pens, or a baseball game with the Pirates.
What you may not have realized, however, is that to give you the most accurate picture of Pittsburgh, they should have started with the description of the sports teams and then stopped there. Maybe they could have thrown in a reference to Eat ’n Park or going “dahntahn” (read: downtown), but really, that’s all that is necessary. Even if they had done this, though, you probably still wouldn’t understand how important sports are to the city of Pittsburgh unless you grew up here, or witnessed it yourself.
I’m sure some of you that come from other cities with big sports teams will try to tell me otherwise; you’ll try to maintain that really, your city is the most enthusiastic about sports. But I beg to differ. As a Pittsburgh native and now in my senior year here at Carnegie Mellon, I really do know and understand Pittsburgh’s love for its sports teams. Growing up, Sundays in my house were spent downstairs, with me and my sister lined up on the couch with my dad, all wearing Steelers sweatshirts, munching on wings, and learning about how the game was played. And while I may not always have been able to continue that tradition my whole life, my love for the Steelers has only grown. And you can bet that when I’m not able to watch the game, I’ve got a friend or family member — or both — texting me updates on the score.
I’ve heard that it’s something in the water; maybe that’s why the Pittsburgh sports fanaticism begins at such a young age. Regardless of the reason, the lives of the people of Pittsburgh tend to revolve around the city’s sports teams, and it’s contagious. 
While I think that anyone that wasn’t from Pittsburgh didn’t fully understand the ecstasy we felt after getting the “one for the other thumb,” the sixth Super Bowl win, that didn’t stop them from joining in the rioting that was going on in the streets. Pitt and Carnegie Mellon students alike poured out into the streets of Oakland and the South Side to celebrate the exciting win, and the same thing happened a few years ago to celebrate the original “one for the thumb,” although I wasn’t there to witness that one first-hand. While I’m not condoning the damage that was done during the riots, I think it’s great that Pittsburgh’s sports teams can work so well to bring people together.
It’s something that the people of the city can bond over: locals, visitors, and college students alike. Pittsburghers all share a common love for their sports teams that they are more than willing to share with college students in the city. Nothing brings people together better than gathering on a Sunday in a dorm lounge to watch the week’s game while taking a break from the day’s homework. It’s really the best way to learn what the city is all about, and to get the absolute most out of your four years here.
And it’s not just a “Stillers” thing, either; Pens fans were just as enthusiastic after their Stanley Cup win this summer, although they managed to celebrate with markedly less damage to the city. And even though the Pirates admittedly are not the best baseball team ever, that doesn’t stop people from heading to PNC Park to enjoy the fun atmosphere and possibility of fireworks associated with the game. It doesn’t matter if the team wins or loses. Pittsburghers can always come together afterward to celebrate the great catches and passes, or to commiserate over the lousy calls made by the referees.
I know that I sound like some crazy, obsessed Pittsburgh fan, but all I’m really trying to do is give you a glimpse of how important their local sports teams are to the people of Pittsburgh. And not only do I want you to realize how important they are, I want you to realize, at the very start of the year, how much more your years here can mean if you really try to be part of the city, and don’t just act like a visitor who’s merely popping in for a visit.
There are other ways to take in the city without following a sports team, of course, like going to Eat ’n Park or Kennywood, but sports are so much a part of Pittsburgh’s culture there’s really no better way. Pick any Monday morning during football season, and I can guarantee you that at least three out of the top five headlines on either the Tribune Review’s or Post-Gazette’s website will feature Steelers-related stories. Sports teams really do take over all aspects of the city’s culture, and it’s something that I love about my city, and I hope that you grow to love, too.
No matter what sport you prefer (except basketball... but who really follows that?), Pittsburgh has a team for you to bond over, and that’s an opportunity that I highly recommend you take advantage of. Maybe it is something in the water, so take a sip directly from the tap and see what happens. Even if the drink doesn’t magically turn you into a black-and-gold-wearing diehard Steelers, Pens, and Pirates fan (or any one of the three), maybe it will at least coerce you to watch a game and cheer for Pittsburgh, and then go out for a late-night celebration with your friends at Eat ’n Park. Then you’ll know what Pittsburgh is really about.

To go Greek or not to go Greek? I say go Greek. I faced this question three years ago just weeks into my first year — and my decision to go Greek was the best I have made in college. Four years will seem to speed by, and I couldn’t be more glad that I made the choice so early on.
In talking with my Greek friends, their biggest regret is often that they didn’t do the same, and instead waited until sophomore or even junior year. There are three categories of students who walk onto our campus: the nevers, the maybes, and the “OMG I must go Greek”s. For the nevers, there is often nothing that can convince them to go the other way. They will continually mock us, citing robed rituals, social mixers, and constant wearing of lettered shirts with cheesy sayings. The “OMG”s will no doubt join us as soon as they can get to the Quad. The maybes, however, make up the majority of Greek life on our campus. I was a maybe, yet have found myself addicted to world that Greek life offers.
As a member, the opportunities are endless, and to the unaffiliated student, the benefits these groups bring to campus should be crystal clear. Although represented by just 1006 students, or 20 percent of campus, the impact of our Greek community is quite big.
For members, the effect can be tremendous. Joining up may seem daunting to incoming first-years, but you should not let it phase you. Greek life at Carnegie Mellon is unique. Our size allows for a network small enough to get to know people, and large enough for every student to find their niche. And our reality is far from commercialized stereotypes as seen in Animal House and Legally Blonde. Like all things at Carnegie Mellon, we don’t do things halfway. We do it all — scholarship, leadership, philanthropy, networking, friendship, and support, just to name a few.
Fraternities and sororities were founded on these principles and we stick to them today. Sixty percent of Greeks are members of other campus organizations, with 32 percent serving in leadership roles, as of spring 2009. Four of the five Panhellenic sororities earned QPAs above the all-women’s average, and four fraternities surpassed the all-men’s average. Throughout a member period, we enforce a strict no-hazing policy. We make sure that members are held accountable for all that they do, allowing them to excel.
The support network offered serves as a home away from home for all its members. The physical chapter facility is available whenever needed for a room to stay overnight or a place to find people to listen to your problems. Greek housing is usually cheaper than campus housing, includes free laundry, and large common rooms, and — for the majority of the fraternities — a personal chef. Some fraternities and sororities even allow first-semester first years to move into the facilities if space allows. The diverse groups of personalities within a house allow each member to find an even closer niche within the chapter. This diversity allows members to play upon their strengths and take up leadership positions in everything ranging from Booth, Buggy, and Greek Sing to networking and event planning to philanthropy and community service.
Leadership is encouraged, but not required. In our community, you really do get what you give. If you don’t have the time to be the organization’s next president, you can enjoy all the privileges of just being a member. If leadership is what gets you, you have the chance to explore this in whatever area you choose.
Our community extends its passions far beyond its house and into every area of campus life. Five of the six Head Orientation Counselors for this year’s Orientation are Greek, as well as a large portion of Orientation leaders and Orientation counselors. Six members of the small cheerleading squad are Greek, as well as a majority of the varsity football team. Greeks are a constant presence at Spring Carnival, placing in Buggy, and making some of the most impressive Booths on Midway.
Greek life is not just a one-time experience — it’s a commitment for life. Once initiated into a Greek organization, the member is often given access to an extensive alumni directory of professionals, an alumni chapter in almost every city, and a lifelong connection to collegiate friends. 
As Greeks, we graduate from college knowing not only that they are connected for life but also that they have made a difference. Greek organizations were credited this past spring with over 4500 community service hours, $28,419 raised for philanthropies, and 59 campus educational programs.
We enter the real world knowing that we have formed an extensive social network. While our campus has just over 6000 undergraduates, the tight-knit qualities of our community ensure that we meet a few people in every campus demographic who can introduce us to even more people. Who knows who these people will be one day? Greeks alone represent 76 percent of all Congressmen and Senators, 85 percent of all Fortune 500 executives, 40 of 47 Supreme Court justices since 1910, and every U.S. President and Vice President since 1825 but four. When you add in the Carnegie Mellon intelligence factor for both Greeks and non-affiliated students, the benefits of a large social network are grand.
When I look back on my letters next year, I’ll remember with great pride the best thing I chose to do with my college years. And if you are a maybe or an “OMG,” I’m excited for you to get the chance to experience it too!
Sabrina Porter (sporter@) is president of Delta Delta Delta sorority and encourages all first-years to look into going Greek.

To students and faculty who have been around Carnegie Mellon for a few years, the complexity of the layout of our dear Steel City is only just becoming apparent. By now, we’ve gotten lost on the North Side, gotten turned around in Penn Circle, and taken the bus too far across the Homestead Grays Bridge one too many times. We’re finally getting a sense of which river is which, and which neighborhoods butt up against our own.
To first-years, let me try to break it down. The main campus is in Oakland. You probably live in Oakland, so that makes it easy. But maybe you live in Squirrel Hill. Your older friends might live in Shadyside. And last weekend, your parents took you shopping at Target at the Waterfront. Now, the Waterfront — that’s in Homestead.
Now, with potential new development that the university’s president, Jared Cohon, e-mailed the student body about over the summer, local geography may become even more complicated. According to an Official Communications e-mail sent out to the campus community on June 30, Carnegie Mellon has reached an agreement to purchase three acres of land, as well as a new building, right around the intersection of Forbes Avenue and South Craig Street. (To the first-years: That’s right near the Starbucks and Subway.) The university’s arrangement includes the Graphic Arts Technical Foundation (GATF) building right before Phi Bar on the north side of Forbes when one approaches from campus, a parking lot behind the building, and a lot in Junction Hollow. In addition, the university plans to purchase the National City Bank building and property across the street from the GATF building.
That’s a significant amount of space that will have Carnegie Mellon’s stamp on it. Already on South Craig Street is the Quality of Life Technology Center, and the Mellon Institute and the Software Engineering Institute are close by. Besides these buildings that bear the official seal of Carnegie Mellon University, many other sites on the street are frequented by Carnegie Mellon students often enough that they bear more of an unofficial seal. Lulu’s, Kiva Han, and scattered outdoor gathering spaces on the street are recognized for their association with the school’s students, as well as are recognized by the students as a comfortable spot to frequent.
As part of this newspaper’s editorial board, I’ve written about this expansion before, as it was vaguely outlined in the Campus Design & Facilities Development’s master plan for the university’s development. While not implied in Cohon’s June 30 e-mail, there have been whispers on campus of the university administration’s desire to shroud South Craig Street with plaid, burgundy, and white flags denoting Carnegie Mellon territory. Like Harvard Square, the retail area right around Harvard University in Boston, we could have our very own mini-city.
However, as part of the editorial board,I have argued that re-branding South Craig Street as an overly planned or organized offshoot of the university’s main campus up Forbes Avenue is undesirable. While it is unquestionably important for the university to expand physically as its educational presence expands globally, the potential for natural, unplanned growth on the part of the university must remain. All buildings within walking distance of campus should not be educational; students need regular exposure to retail establishments that are officially unassociated with that which dominates the rest of our existence while we’re at school.
Moreover, I have to wonder: Can we really handle the extra layer of confusion? We’re on Carnegie Mellon’s campus, in Oakland, a neighborhood of Pittsburgh. It’s North Oakland, really. Or is it East? Is there an East Oakland? Are the intramural fields in Squirrel Hill? If we own most of South Craig Street, will we be on Carnegie Mellon’s campus, in the Carnegie Mellon mini-city, in Oakland, in Pittsburgh, in Allegheny County, in Pennsylvania, in the Midwest-slash-East Coast?
Aside from this argument, though, I am encouraged and excited by this development. Cohon and his administration are aware of the university’s place — and not just its physical one — in the city, and are interested in expanding and continuing to work hard. Moreover, he is doing more as our president than simply focusing on and worrying about the budget issue. (First-years: Don’t worry, there’s no budget crisis... But if you’d like to donate now to the school — just five small dollars! — that’d be cool. The money would be put to use. Probably for grass seed to rejuvenate the ground once the white tent in the middle of the Mall is removed following your Convocation.)
Money makes me nervous. I’m only just starting to become financially responsible, and that’s only because I now have what feels like a trillion graduate student loans to manage and bills to pay. (You’d think sass and wit alone would pay my way through the Heinz College, but alas, my words can only carry me so far. As in, not very.) I appreciate that Cohon mentioned the financial impact of these property purchases on and around South Craig Street in his June 30 e-mail, and I understand his need to present himself and the university as fiscally responsible, especially because the money world is a less than ideal place right now (so I’m learning). I think we’re all just going to have to trust Cohon that the university won’t shut down as a result of this proposed expansion — none of us appreciate irony that much.
I agree with Cohon, too, that “the strategic value of this land to the university is unquestionable.” But I do have to question what is going to be put on that land, and why. Yes, we need growth. That “why” is simple. But surely, the fact that there is so much space for development involved in this purchase will invite a lot of chefs into the kitchen. Many voices will want to be heard as to the direction of our school’s growth: investors who are funding it, students who are living in it, faculty who are working in it. But despite all of these chefs likely trying to influence Cohon’s decision as to what specific development takes place, it shouldn’t be over-calculated. If the school tries to plan out exactly what function the space should have: who will — or should — use it and when, what colors it should be, and who should feel like they belong, then the freedom and creativity that students need to be a bit normal around here could be squandered.
Spontaneity in education is great; spontaneity in urban development is even better.

While financial aid might be harder to come by and scholarships scarce these days, one study shows that going to a school with a high cost of tuition might pay off. An article recently published in The New York Times — “Do Elite Colleges Produce the Best-Paid Graduates?” — ranked Carnegie Mellon as one of the schools whose graduates received the highest starting pays in the nation. Granted, the group behind the research only considered graduates who went into the workplace directly after earning their bachelor’s, not those who continued their education in graduate school. The fact remains, however, that Carnegie Mellon has one of the highest starting salaries for its graduates.
Intriguing, though, is the fact that the article also includes a study on what the highest-paid college majors are and provides a list of the top 10 most profitable ones. Again, this list only considers students who pursued career options after earning their bachelor’s, not graduate school. Not surprisingly, just about every blend of engineering makes the cut; also on the list, in no particular order, are physics, economics, and computer science, along with mechanical, industrial, civil, and environmental engineering.
So, in times when fiscal matters are dictating more and more the way we set the course for our lives, how should we react to this? For some, it is a validation of their chosen path and an indicator that the hard work, diligent study, and copious student loans put into their education will eventually pay off. For students considering colleges to apply to and careers to choose, it has undoubtedly made their decisions either a lot easier or a lot harder.
While those in the hard science professions may be rejoicing — and, for all the effort they put into their studies, they do have the right to — the article doesn’t strike me as all that comforting, despite hailing from one of those happy majors. While the article cheerily assures us that “hardworking students will always do well, wherever they go,” it also provides a list of the bottom 10 majors by career salary. These include drama, fine arts, music, education, and Spanish.
Though it does not come as a great surprise to see the more liberal majors in the lower-paid tier, the uncertainty still so pervasive in our economy might lead to fewer and fewer students pursuing those career paths. It raises the question: Should choice of school and major be about what each student wants or about what their wallet demands? On one hand, perhaps it will entice more people with an aptitude for the sciences and engineering to choose that field and bring more creative thinkers to that arena. On the other hand, it might also draw people away from majoring in more liberal fields, leaving us with fewer elementary school teachers, artists, actors, and musicians in the future. Or, to go out on a limb, perhaps those dedicated to their chosen major will still pursue it, regardless of whether it is a “good investment.”
What I see as the most troubling is not that student loans are rising (which they are), or that graduate school has been teetering back and forth in being a good or bad fiscal investment (which is troubling in itself), but that, for an already competitive and generally not-very-well-paid set of majors, the stakes have just gotten even higher.
People are seeking security, whether it’s in cautious daily spending or carefully chosen professions. Parents may be less willing to let their children major in areas in the liberal arts, instead leading them toward other subjects in the hopes of building a more stable future. Students themselves may choose to pursue areas that are not as passionate about in order to gain job security. While hardly against science and engineering, I cannot help but feel that this will develop into a trend and that, years down the road, we will be a society composed of many brilliant technicians but few brilliant writers, artists, and musicians.
Both quantitative and liberal fields are vital to an education and a civilization. In an age when the culture revolves so much more around all things material and their acquisition, attendance at theaters, support for galleries, and even subscriptions to newspapers have plummeted. If people begin to choose their majors solely as a matter of finance, what will the future hold? Gleaming cities with every technological innovation the mind could call for, but not a play or movie to be found for miles? I hope not.
But there will be fewer; that much is assured. And though I should be congratulating myself on my clever investment, I can’t help but wonder about 20 years from now, when I walk out of my office with my sterling career at its fruition, if I’ll see as many cinemas and playhouses as I do now, or whether it will all have become a thing of the past.
