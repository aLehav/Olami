Shakhtar Donetsk vs. Inter Milan
Although both of these teams are coming from Matchday 1 losses, Inter Milan still has some momentum left over after being crowned the champions of Serie A back in May. Milan also played very well against Real Madrid, nearly holding the La Liga table-toppers to a draw. In contrast, Shakhtar looked disorganized against Sheriff, their messy and tired-looking defense conceding two goals. While these two have historically drawn often and have had similar performances in their last five matches, I would say that Inter Milan has pretty good odds to move up the Group D table.
Prediction: Inter Milan wins 3-0
Ajax vs. Besiktas
This match is a tougher one to call. While Ajax has historically done well against Besiktasş (along with fellow countrymen Fenerbahçe), having won all four of their previous meetings in European competition, this is their first time playing each other in nearly two decades. Furthermore, members of the Turkish Big Three have improved significantly in recent years, with Fenerbahçe having held Ajax to a draw, before winning in their second group stage meeting back in the 2015/16 season. However, given both teams’ performances in their last five matches leading up to their  Tuesday clash, Ajax looks like they have the edge in terms of momentum.
Prediction: Ajax wins 2-1
Real Madrid vs. Sheriff
Despite Sheriff becoming the first Moldovan side to qualify for the Champions League group stage and having won their first game against Shakhtar Donetsk, they are still far from matching Real Madrid in terms of fame and resources. With Real’s domestic momentum, sitting at the top of La Liga after losing the top spot to Atlético Madrid by just two points last year, Sheriff would need something special to overcome the Spanish giants. The odds, for now, are solidly in Real Madrid’s favor.
Prediction: Real Madrid wins 2-0
AC Milan vs. Atlético Madrid
Although AC Milan fielded a loss on Matchday 1 while Atlético drew, it’s arguably a little more impressive to lose 3-2 to the current Premier League table-toppers Liverpool away (but still earn two away goals) than to draw at home against a 10-man Porto. Milan’s recent home record is also better than Atlético’s away record, so for this match, I would have to go with the Italian side.
Prediction: AC Milan wins 3-1
Borussia Dortmund vs. Sporting
There isn’t much to debate here. Sporting has never beat Dortmund, and while Dortmund is coming off of a 2-1 victory against Besiktas on Matchday 1, Sporting suffered a 5-1 defeat at the hands of Ajax. Save a miracle, this match is firmly Dortmund’s.
Prediction: Dortmund wins 4-0
PSG vs. Manchester City
This is definitely a match to watch this week, especially if Lionel Messi is fit to play again. Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City has been looking strong this season, just one point shy of the top of the Premier League table, while PSG, unsurprisingly, has a strong grip on Ligue 1. Although both teams are coming in with similar recent performances, City looks like the stronger of the two, having won 6-3 against Leipzig on Matchday 1 as PSG drew to Club Brugge. While Man City may be more fatigued coming off a close 1-0 victory against Chelsea on the weekend, they have the momentum and the tactics to pull off another win.
Prediction: City wins 3-2
Porto vs. Liverpool
Champions League matches with Porto can never be called with certainty. Despite coming into this match as the clear underdog, Porto has pulled off surprise upsets time and time again. Still, Liverpool’s domestic dominance cannot be ignored, and while I think that they have the definite advantage, it would be a mistake to rule out Porto completely.
Prediction: Liverpool wins 2-0
Leipzig vs. Club Brugge
Despite Leipzig coming off of a loss on Matchday 1 and Club Brugge coming off of a draw, I would still bet on Leipzig as the favorite to win this head-to-head. Leipzig’s momentum after putting up a huge 6-0 win over Hertha Berlin on the weekend will make them especially dangerous, and homeside advantage will almost certainly be in effect. Overall, I think this game is in the hands of the Germans.
Prediction: Leipzig wins 2-0
Atalanta vs. Young Boys
Having successfully pulled off a 2-1 upset against a 10-man Manchester United on Matchday 1, Young Boys will be looking to continue their winning streak as Atalanta tries to move up the Group F table. Atalanta will need to be vigilant, especially on their defense, to avoid the same fate as Manchester United. As long as neither side makes serious defensive errors, however, I would say that the two are pretty evenly matched.
Prediction: 1-1 draw
Zenit St. Petersburg vs Malmö
Both of these teams have had similar performances in recent matches, and both  fielded losses on Matchday 1 playing against arguably stronger opponents: Zenit conceded a late goal in the second half to Chelsea and Malmö lost 3-0 to Juventus. Considering Zenit’s home record against Malmö’s away record, it seems like Zenit might have a slight advantage in this match, but I would not be surprised if it turns out in Malmö’s favor. Personally, I don’t have a particularly strong conviction in either team walking away with all three points. It wouldn’t surprise me if neither are able to capitalize.
Prediction: 0-0 draw
Wolfsburg vs. Sevilla
Ironically, both of these Group G teams drew on Matchday 1 and ended with 10 men on the field due to a red card. However, Wolfsburg is coming into the match having lost 3-1 to Hoffenheim on the weekend, while Sevilla just won 2-0 against Espanyol. If Sevilla carries this momentum into their Wednesday match, they will have the advantage.
Prediction: Sevilla wins 4-2
Bayern Munich vs. Dynamo Kyiv
Like the Dortmund vs. Sporting match, this one is a no-brainer. Bayern has been strong domestically, especially at home, sitting on top of the Bundesliga table. Furthermore, the Germans comfortably won 3-0 against Barcelona away on Matchday 1 while Kyiv was only able to draw against Benfica. Robert Lewanowski is playing well, and all signs point to Bayern walking away from this game with all three points firmly in hand.
Prediction: Bayern wins 4-0
Salzburg vs. Lille
The other half of Group G, both teams drew against opponents who lost a man in the second half on Matchday 1. However, Salzburg will be coming into the match with a significantly better record in terms of recent performances in comparison to Lille. This, plus the homeside advantage, seem to give Salzburg the edge in this head-to-head.
Prediction: Salzburg wins 1-0
Juventus vs. Chelsea
This is certainly another match to watch. Juventus, coming off of a solid 3-0 win on Matchday 1, will be looking to keep their position atop the Group H table against the defending UEFA champions. The Italians definitely have better morale coming into this match, having won 3-2 against both Sampdoria and Spezia domestically. In contrast Chelsea lost 1-0 to Manchester City on the weekend, and was only able to hold Aston Villa to a 1-1 draw in the Carabao Cup the week before that. With both Dybala and Morata missing the game, however, it seems like Chelsea may have the upper hand in this matchup.
Prediction: Chelsea wins 2-0
Benfica vs. Barcelona
While this match would have been easy to call in past years, Barcelona’s recent performances after losing Lionel Messi have been lackluster to say the least. Sitting fifth in the La Liga table and having won very few matches in the last month, Barcelona’s prowess this season has been uncharacteristically questionable. That being said, Barça should still have the advantage when it comes to each player’s individual performance, but if Benfica is able to take advantage of cohesion and other cooperation-based errors, they could certainly pull off an upset. While Benfica’s chances still seem slim against Barcelona, their recent home record suggests they have a decent chance of toppling the Spanish giants.
Prediction: Benfica wins 2-1
Manchester United vs. Villareal
The ironic thing is that despite only having won one of their last five matches (drawing the other four), Villareal’s recent record is still arguably better than United’s, who have lost three of their last five matches. While Villareal is the underdog coming into this match, United’s loss against Champions League newcomers Sheriff on Matchday 1, along with subsequent losses to West Ham in the Carabao Cup and Aston Villa on the weekend, raise serious doubts about their ability to perform. This, coupled with questions about Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw’s fitness for the Wednesday clash, tip the scales in Villareal’s favor. Unless United is able to pull it together ahead of then and successfully utilize Cristiano Ronaldo to his full potential, Villareal looks like they could slip away with all three points and leave United at rock bottom.
Prediction: Villareal wins 2-0

Team Explorer Places Fourth in DARPA SubT Challenge
A group of students, faculty, and staff from Carnegie Mellon and Oregon State University under the name "Team Explorer" went all the way to the final round and placed fourth in the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Subterranean Challenge. The challenge is a simulated search-and-rescue mission, where the team's robots must go into a subterranean environment and identify objects that might belong to a potential human survivor.
Recovering Hispanic Heritage
It's National Hispanic Heritage Month, and to honor it, Hispanic Studies and Translation Professor Kenya Dworkin has worked as part of a committee organizing a series of events with the University of Pittsburgh. In her research, Dworkin is working on recovering the history of 19th century Cuban cigar workers who immigrated to Florida and adapting it into a book. 
Robots with Muscles
Nowadays, robots aren't all metals and circuitry: researchers are finding ways to incorporate biological materials into robots to make them function similarly to humans. Mechanical engineering Ph.D. student Wenhuan Sun published a paper examining how one could fabricate a protein like collagen, which is naturally found in human skin and tissues, to mimic the properties of a tendon or muscle to help a robot walk or swim. Sun studied how collagen fibers could be compacted in specific ways to get different muscle or tendon-like properties, training a deep neural network that could recommend different fabrication parameters depending on the user's desired result.
COVID-19 vaccine booster shots to be available soon in Pennsylvania
Pennsylvania Acting Secretary of Health Alison Beam issued an order for vaccine providers to start preparing for the distribution of COVID-19 vaccine booster shots to be distributed once further CDC guidance is issued. The CDC is recommending to provide booster shots of the Pfizer-BioTech COVID-19 vaccine to frontline workers, people over 65, and people with underlying health conditions who received the second dose of the vaccine at least six months ago.
The FCC commits to 1.2B in funding student access to technology
Aiming to bridge the "homework gap" between remote students with technology and those without, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced that it would commit $1.2 billion to funding laptops, tablets, Internet access, and more in schools across the U.S. This money comes from the Emergency Connectivity Fund, a $7.17 billion fund that, paired with the Emergency Broadband Benefit Program, can benefit remote students that lack access to technology needed to submit assignments, participate in classes, and utilize other resources that those with technology freely enjoy.
The FCC starts cracking down on robocalls
Voice service providers are now required to file plans with the FCC on fighting robocalls. If those plans are not in the FCC's database, other phone carriers will have to block calls from these providers. The FCC already set a now-passed June 30 deadline for providers to implement anti-robocall technology called STIR/SHAKEN that authenticates the identity of the caller, though smaller providers have gotten an extension on the deadline. Officials hope that these moves will lead to fewer robocalls, but recently robotexts, which are similar in nature to robocalls but don't yet have regulations governing them, have been on the rise.
Trial of Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes continues
It is the third week of testimonies for the trial of Elizabeth Holmes, who started health technology company Theranos. Theranos lied about being able to use a pinprick of blood in a machine that supposedly could, but did not actually, run over 200 tests, and garnered the interest of high-profile investors likening Holmes to Steve Jobs. This week, the most notable testimonies were from former Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, an investor and board member of Theranos; a patient who Theranos machines inaccurately described as likely to have a miscarriage; and former Theranos lab director Adam Rosendorff who attempted to convince Holmes to push back the launch of the faulty tests.

A new member will be joining Carnegie Mellon’s campus in the fall of 2022, along with the incoming first-year class. This member is coming with plenty of money and high expectations, not unlike some other incoming first-years. And not unlike this year's graduating class, this member will heavily rely upon remote participation.
This is not a new student, but rather a new fixture to the Carnegie Mellon campus. 
On Aug. 31, Carnegie Mellon partnered with the Emerald Cloud Lab (ECL), a San Francisco-based biotechnology startup, to create the first cloud lab on campus. The partnership was formed shortly after the university received a $150 million grant from the philanthropic Richard King Mellon Foundation during the summer. 
As of now, the construction of the lab near Bakery Square is set to begin this semester and is expected to conclude in the latter half of 2022.
Cloud labs are an emerging form of technology that allows researchers to conduct experiments remotely, gaining much popularity during the pandemic. Using cloud labs, researchers are able to simulate hands-on environments and take advantage of flexible, scientific infrastructure. So far, these laboratories have specialized in artificial intelligence research — past experiments have ranged between the topics of cybersecurity and machine learning.
However, ECL is keen upon bringing the life sciences into this new form of lab work. According to their company website, their past endeavors have included applications to many different biotechnology-related fields: pharmaceutical research and development, translational medicine, and even drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics.
ECL promises to bring Carnegie Mellon researchers the ability to control an entire life sciences laboratory from their computers. Researchers will be able to use ECL's Command Center application to design experiments while dropping their samples off at designated drop points on campus. With a cloud lab, researchers will be able to run their experiments in a facility tailored specifically to their needs. In addition to research, the cloud lab has already been a pivotal component of many undergraduate and graduate STEM courses at Carnegie Mellon. 
It is important to note that the cloud lab is far from a virtual lab. There will be highly trained technicians present, along with robot instrumentation, to run the experiments. However, it will allow for the remote participation of many experiments simultaneously. In other words, the cloud lab at Carnegie Mellon is on a mission to improve the efficiency of scientific research on campus.

It was 2019, life was good, and Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road” came out of nowhere. What seemed like a meme became months of repetition, remix, and a career for Lil Nas X. Though he has released a couple of semi-successful singles since his first album, Lil Nas X’s “MONTERO” has proven to be a cauterizing moment in solidifying his place in the music industry.
The eclectic creativity behind “Old Town Road” reaches full form in “MONTERO,” as Lil Nas X brings listeners into an entirely different universe–somewhere between Mount Olympus and “League of Legends.” From the cover artwork to the associated videos (especially those for “ONE OF ME” and “MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name)”), the album is a voyage into a bubblegum-platinum videogame based deeply in classical mythology.
The generosity of “MONTERO” means that its astounding visual thematics do not translate to musical lack. Clean production and unexpectedly wonderful instrumentation characterize the album, ranging from morose, lute-like acoustic guitars in “TALES OF DOMINICA” and “AM I DREAMING” to renaissance heralding trumpets in “DOLLA SIGN SLIME” and “INDUSTRY BABY” to Glass-Animals-style synths in “VOID.” 
Regarding the five other voices featured on the record, Lil Nas X put together a diverse and joyful lineup: queer icon Elton John (“ONE OF ME”), Doja Cat (“SCOOP”), Megan Thee Stallion (“DOLLA SIGN SLIME”), Jack Harlow (“INDUSTRY BABY”), and, in a wonderful ode to her father’s role in “Old Town Road”’s success, Miley Cyrus (“AM I DREAMING”, which also features birds!).
In genre, Lil Nas X flaunts his unique flexibility. Like “Old Town Road,” a distinctly country-hip-hop track, “MONTERO” brings the best of rap, pop, and hip-hop, while still managing to dabble in areas far more subtle. The down-and-dirty metal feel of “LIFE AFTER SALEM” and Paramore-style rock on “LOST IN THE CITADEL” pull the record in a seemingly alt direction, while gospel samples in “DEAD RIGHT NOW” throw us into the heavens. The varied sound has something for everyone, and since it’s his first album, will draw audiences far past the hit singles.
Lyrically, the album re-introduces us to Lil Nas X in a bold way; it is expository in nature from its title — Lil Nas X’s given first name — all the way down to the picture of a nude Lil Nas X right on the cover. Tracks like “VOID’’ and ‘’SUN GOES DOWN” bring us into the deepest depths of Lil Nas X’s worst moments, with lines like “Lately, I’ve been feeling small as the salt in the sea” reminding us that his journey as a breakout artist has not always been easy. 
“THATS WHAT I WANT,” along with its groundbreaking video, brings Black queer romance and sexuality to the general public in its purest form: “I want someone who love me/I need someone who needs me.” Between the longing and the reminiscing, though, there is room for the kind of too-cool triumphant spirit that makes this genre-bending record accessible to pop culture.
From the highs of “DONT WANT IT,” to the lows of “VOID,” to the massive complexity of tracks like “ONE OF ME,” Lil Nas X opens the doors to a vast mansion where he sits on a throne of Swarovski crystals, journaling about the woes of high school and rewatching his Grammy wins. “MONTERO” is, more than anything else, a celebration of everything that Lil Nas X has done in the past three years. Calling himself “living proof that if you want it/you can have anything right before your eyes,” he reminisces on his life before fame with a humble certainty. As for the future, “ART OF REALIZATION” gives fans something to chew on: “I’ve been driving a lot … With no actual direction/Not heading toward any specific place.”

Q: “Hi A.T. I’m thinking about leaving my SO. How should I do it?"
A: Two words. The. Fence. If there’s one thing that CMU students underestimate, it’s the power and potential of our favorite drippy fixture. Sure, RAs use it as an opportunity to spread school spirit during O Week. Yeah, 112 and Bhangra paint it when they need the publicity. But the real advantage is that you can loudly, publicly, and more-or-less anonymously say whatever you want to virtually everyone on campus, including your soon-to-be-ex. That’s the alpha thing to do, anyways. Show ‘em you wore the pants in the relationship the whole time. Some people send a text, you paint the Fence.
Q: “A.T., I’m getting tired of the same ol’ apps. What do you use to find love?"
A: Take the path of least resistance. What’s a site you’re already always using? YouTube? Facebook? Twitter? No! Piazza. According to a study I half remember from a dream I had, over 80% of students will lunge towards their phone if they think it’s a post about their upcoming assignment. Use that panic to your advantage. Personally, when I’m writing bae I title all my messages with “Due Date Moved Up”, just to make sure I got their attention. 
Q: “Heart health is super important, A.T. How does a busy Tartan like me get their cardio?”
A: Creativity is the name of the game. Use your head when you gotta move your body. In line at a career fair? Run in place! That way, you’ll work up a sweat, and your recruiter will subconsciously think you’re that excited to work for them. Walking past the Fence? Jump over it! What is the Fence if not a massive hurdle with some club painted on it. See a rabbit on the cut? Chase it to its warren and meet its family.

From selfie sticks to silver foxes, the differences between Zoomers and Boomers seem to grow by the dozen each day. But one thing seems to bind all ages together (and no, it’s not saying “You too” when a waiter says “Enjoy your meal”). No, it’s a shared hatred of scooters that has Grandma Isadora and Cousin Kayleigh shaking their fists at the dining room table.
A few months ago, Spin, a company seemingly inspired by washing machines and Fox News, made its debut on the streets of Pittsburgh. Finally, the young and young at heart could zip around the Steely City with the press of a button. The average CMU Joe could compete with the dozens of Boosted Board Bros that run stop signs and run off with our girlfriends. The future was now, and it went 15 mph.
Of course, public opinion was far from unanimous. Did a few brave souls jump at the opportunity to go “vroom?” Absolutely, and we recognize those who decided to have fun with their limited time on Earth. Take School of Design student Harriet J., who said that as soon as she saw a Spin scooter, she “raced down Mount Washington and just, like, forgot about dying!” Affordable transportation and mortality transcendence? Sign us up! Or Neal R., a math major who, on his first ride, rode so long he contracted “motorcycle wrist” and was immediately inducted into biker gang Sons of Anarchy. Sure, he hasn’t been heard from since and might be a neo-Nazi now, but we applaud his dedication to joy and youthfulness.
But there are those who refuse to see life as an opportunity to smile, eat chocolate, and kiss babies. There are those who wag their fists at laughter, spit at glee, and take a dump on the proverbial parades of others. “They’re too fast, they should really lower the speed on those things!” said vocal performance major and complete buzzkill Yusuf B. “Get ‘em off the sidewalk!” screamed first-year and future assistant principal Lisa K. “Spin? More like SIN! God hates scoots!” decried CS student and card-carrying Sigma Male Trevor O. I staggered away from each of these statements with only one thought: were these really the thoughts of healthy young adults? The ripe oranges of society, ready to be plucked and juiced? I needed to hear the grey side of things. I needed to talk to old people.
“You look just like my old paperboy! Do you have the ‘Gazette’ by any chance?” greeted me as I entered Life’s Twilight Senior Living. Despite COVID-19 protocol, upon entering the home I was met with cheek pinches and offerings of hard candy. My face hurt, and while I do like Werther’s Originals, I needed the Greatest Generation’s thoughts on Spin. “Like the dishwasher?” former fighter pilot Johnny S. asked. “No sir, the new scooters you can rent,” I clarified. “Rent like a skin flick at the nickelodeon?” former circuit justice Don R. queried. “Yes, something like that. They’re electric scooters-” “I’m afraid of electricity!” former heart surgeon and Civil Rights activist Theodora E. injected. It was painstaking, but eventually, I was able to wrangle their thoughts out of their skulls. And they were as follows: scooters too fast, scooters too scary, we hate fun. Precisely the thoughts of my more youthful classmates!
I can only speculate why two very different groups of people have the exact same thoughts about an objectively rad and cool idea such as rentable scooters. Perhaps there’s a generational predisposition to vertigo. Maybe old-heads and youngsters alike fear hip breakage. Maybe there’s something in the water that makes people hate fun. Either way, the effect is clear. When you complain about scooters, you sound old as hell. So either step out of the way or try taking one for a Spin.

As phase four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe soldiers on, there’s a consistent nagging feeling that Marvel movies will get stale. “Black Widow,” which came out earlier this year in July, proved to be a significant disappointment, and the promotion for “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings” was not exciting enough to make it seem like a standout Marvel movie. Luckily, the film is out for everyone to see and it’s pretty awesome. 
The action sequences alone are worth the price of admission. This is the first Marvel movie in a long time where not only was the action clearly shot, but there was a sense of rhythm and flow to the choreography that paid homage to the action of Jackie Chan. There were some shots of action in the movie where I felt genuinely giddy with excitement, and that’s a feeling that I have been missing from a big blockbuster movie in the past few years. 
But beyond the amazing action is an engaging, even if slightly familiar, story to back it up. The Ten Rings is shown to be a legitimately competent organization that operates in the shadows, taking down governments and building a silent empire over the course of 1,000 years. The main antagonist, Xu Wenwu, leads the Ten Rings with, well, his ten rings. It’s a powerful entity, perhaps cosmic in origin, that essentially overpowers the person who wears it and grants him the gift of immortality. 
What makes the story stand out is the way it is structured. Instead of showing the audience every event in order, we get the backstory of the Ten Rings and how Xu Wenwu meets Shang-Chi’s mother, Ying Li. She’s a powerful guardian from another dimension called Ta Lo, which is rumored to have mythical beasts and magical powers. Cutting to the modern-day, we then see Shang-Chi in San Francisco as a grown adult who parks cars for a living. He’s called back into action when mercenaries sent by his dad attack him on a bus, setting off a thrilling action sequence where we see Shang-Chi as a martial arts master. It is a fantastic way to build tension through the story, as information is revealed gradually over the course of the story rather than shown chronologically like a traditional story. 
The family dynamics between Shang-Chi, his sister Xialing, and their father drive the heart of the story. As it turns out, Ying Li was killed by Wenwu’s former enemies. This sets Wenwu, and eventually a young Shang-Chi, on a path of blood to settle the score. At the age of 14, Shang-Chi is sent on the final hit to kill the man responsible for his mother’s death. It’s after this that Shang-Chi runs away, where he then lives his life in San Francisco. His sister, realizing that Shang-Chi will never return, also runs away to Macau, where she sets up an underground fight ring. 
Wenwu’s motivation throughout the whole story is to make his family whole once again, but without sacrificing his power as the head of the Ten Rings. In a standout performance from Tony Leung, we see a man who realized he had the ability to love and grow old, giving up everything for Ying Li. After her death, he is driven mad, and that madness is manipulated by dark forces. He is convinced that the love of his life is held captive in Ta Lo by her former guardians. He resents Ta Lo because they deemed Wenwu unworthy of being able to live in Ta Lo, so Ying Li gave up her powers to be able to live with him. 
This conflict, rooted in elements of mysticism and themes of grief, separates the story from a traditional Marvel origin story. Where most Marvel origin stories try to show characters overcoming their grief and become the heroes they are meant to be, “Shang-Chi” shows how grief has already torn a family apart and how that family becomes whole again. In becoming whole again, they find their true selves. It’s not the most original story, but it is certainly very effective and it is different from Marvel’s traditional formula. 
Of course, the film does follow the Marvel formula of having a big CGI fight in the third act, but it’s a very enjoyable CGI fight. As it turns out, the dark force manipulating Wenwu is actually a soul-sucking monster that nearly destroyed Ta Lo once. The monster was locked away in a mountain that has been guarded for thousands of years, but Wenwu is able to break the monster free. But there’s also a protector dragon that, with the help of Shang-Chi, fights the monster. It sounds ridiculous, but on screen, it was a lot of fun to watch. It also helped that the CGI action was well shot and was interspersed with a very personal and well-choreographed final fight between Shang-Chi and his father. 
The movie isn’t perfect by any means. It does have some pacing issues, and as said earlier, the story does feel familiar. But the movie is a really well-done origin story with phenomenal action sequences that have set the bar for action in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story is personal and touching, with a great antagonist who will be remembered as one of the better ones in any Marvel movie. If you have been turned off of Marvel movies, come back and give “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings” a shot. It’s a very fun ride, and a pretty engaging one too.
Score: 7/10

On Thursday, I interviewed Adam Feldman, the chief theater critic and national theater editor at “Time Out New York.” We talked for about an hour on theater criticism, the future of Broadway, and the Tonys. You can follow him on Twitter @FeldmanAdam, on Instagram @adfeldman, and read his articles in Time Out. Here is an edited excerpt from our discussion.
Me: Thanks for having me. I’m writing this for a section in the school newspaper that’s more freeform so I’m trying to write about what it means to be a theater critic and your thoughts, like how theater is changing.
Adam Feldman (AF): That’s a pretty broad topic. I have a lot of thoughts about being a theater critic. As you know, I’ve been doing it for a while so those are sort of different from my thoughts about going back to it now or about the future of Broadway, or about the Tony Awards or any of that so, I mean, just ask away.
Me: So what’s your process for when you’re writing a review for a play?
AF: Usually, there’s a period of previews before the play opens. In olden times, the critic would go to the show on opening night and would file the review that night, and it would go into the next day’s paper. Now, there’s a period immediately before the show opens when the press is invited, usually within a few days of the official opening date, and then the press will hold back its opinion until opening night. I’ll book a date, and we usually get two seats. I like to see shows with a few days of leeway until I have to file the review, because sometimes it’s good to have space to reflect on what you’ve seen and let it sink-in to organize your response. Most of the reviews that we’ve run historically in Time Out are fairly short or getting longer now that we’re less print-bound. Now we’re not print-bound at all, but the brevity of the reviews was partly a function of the design of the magazine when it was a print magazine, and now we’re sort of figuring out exactly how that will work (but that’s in my case personally).
I try to track my response to things while the show happens. They usually provide us with the script so that I don’t have to take notes about the dialogue exactly, which can take you out of the experience. I try to be a good audience member — a responsive and open audience member. I don’t go in with a checklist of things to checkbox in that I’m looking for because every show works differently. They have different intentions, different strategies, and different aesthetics. There’s a first-level response which is I was involved in it, did it capture my imagination? And if so, why? And how? And if not, why? And how? We have a star system where most things kind of fall into the 3-4 range. We don’t give half stars, so it can be a decision because four looks like a big recommendation and three looks like a sort of middling review. A lot of it also involves finding interesting ways to write a review. You don’t want to just pedantically layout the same thing every time, you want the writing itself to be engaging, and you want readers to enjoy reading your review. You want to find any angles on it that might be of interest to a general reader or in my case probably a slightly more theatrically inclined reader. I think that my job is to write for a relatively informed audience that is interested in finding good examples of the kind of theater that New York can do. Next, I examine my response and try to form it into an engaging expression of my opinion, and I try to give it little tests for its reliability and fairness. No person in the world is capital O objective, but there are ways of sorting out your biases. You try to be fair to the show that you’re writing about and you also try to separate your own “small t” taste from something like a “capital T” taste. If I happen to like certain kinds of things more than others as a matter of personal taste, that’s a different thing from my critical evaluation of them. If I’m a restaurant critic, and I happen to love grilled cheeses, I’m not just gonna only write good reviews of grilled cheeses. Even if I don’t happen to like octopus, I should be able to recognize a good octopus when I taste one.
Me: Thank you, that’s a very good answer (laughs). Do you feel like, when you’re watching a play on your own time, you still find yourself getting this critical mindset?
AF: It’s more fun to just see a play when I’m not writing about it. I can relax and don’t have to think about it as rigorously as I would if I were criticizing it. But of course, I will have critical opinions. Maybe the fact that I see so much more than most people might guide the course of my response to things in certain ways — because I will have reference points that a lot of other people won’t have. I’ve seen hundreds of shows a year for more than 20 years. I think for a lot of people going to the theater is a special occasion; they will see one show, a big Broadway show, and it’ll be exciting. You know just that experience is very exciting by itself for someone who doesn’t do it very often, but for someone who does it very often that experience itself is not exciting anymore. The work that I can see within that context is often very exciting, and I try to stay as excitable about it as I can.
Me: Do you ever review a play that’s a revival of a play you already reviewed?
AF: Yes that’s happened. I’ve seen many different “Companies,” “Summer in the Park with Georges,” “Hamlets” ... There are shows that people do regularly and you find yourself analyzing the production more specifically than you would probably with a new play. If it’s a play that you’ve seen before, then you’re much more alert to the choices that are being made by the director and the actors. You just have a different set of reference points, so you try to separate as much as you can the work of the writer, the director, and the cast. And that can be difficult, especially in theater and especially for new works, because good actors can make an ordinary text seem great and bad actors can make a very good text seem mediocre. Also, the work of the director is a lot less obvious than it is in a movie. In a movie, the director’s work is central. Every moment, you have no choice but to see what the director is choosing to show. The director’s work in theater is a lot subtler: You as an audience member still have the choice to look wherever you want on the stage, so a director’s job is often to guide the audience to look where they are meant to be looking. That’s the nature of the beast.
Me: So more about movies — what do you think about movie actors going to Broadway? Do you think they have a unique perspective?
AF: I think it’s a bit of a mistake to categorize people as movie actors. They’re actors, and they have skill sets. Many of them had stage backgrounds before they became movie stars. A lot of people that we think of as mass-culture stars also happen to be trained theater actors, and sometimes even if they’re not, they turn out to be very good at it. Some actors are doing their first stage work and turn out to be natural and have the command and skill set necessary to pull off the stage performance. I thought Jake Gyllenhaal did very well in “Sunday.” I’ve also seen him in a couple of other things and he’s acquitted himself very well on stage. There are times when I’ve seen actors who are clearly out of their element: it showed in the way that they held their bodies and used their voices on stage. There are ways that you have to open up a performance on stage — you have to make it read from farther away. It’s usually in the direction of underacting rather than the direction of overacting. Sometimes there’s some compensatory overacting but usually, when a movie star performance doesn’t go well on stage, they’re not making the most of the medium.
Me: So why did you decide to become a theater critic?
AF: In my case, it sort of found me. I’ve always enjoyed reading theater criticism, I enjoyed theater very much and I did some theater and when I moved to New York I had some free time and would sometimes go chat on an Internet early message board with other theater enthusiasts. Someone saw what I was saying on those boards and asked me to write reviews for them and then led to another thing and I ended up at Time Out. It turned out it was something I liked to do; I was doing it on the side at first and then at a certain point it became a full-time job. Now it has been my full-time job at Time Out since 2003. I always had opinions on theater and I enjoy writing and I enjoy being part of that conversation. I enjoy helping people find the best stuff to see. It can be difficult to know what is worth your time and money so I want to steer people toward the best work, I want to push the culture forward and push the art forward, and that sometimes also means steering people away from things that you think will not be worth their time or their money I know it’s painful to get a bad review, but I think it is its part of a healthy ecology of the system.
Me: So speaking of pushing theater forwards, do you think theater has changed in any broad ways since you started writing for Time Out?
AF: It changes a lot from moment to moment. It reflects larger cultural shifts. It also reflects in some ways the economics of making theater. In the 30s, for example, you had a lot of two-and-a-half-hour comedies with casts of 30. You find that very seldom anymore because it’s extremely expensive to produce and hard to make back your money on. Many serious plays have casts of four and have to write around that. Musicals are a little bit different because they have the potential to earn more money. There have been trends back and forth. There’s a trend towards a certain kind of jukebox musical where they use existing pop songs and try to get audiences who have residual affection for that music and try to work it into the show. The sound of Broadway musicals has evolved over the past 20 years. A lot of Broadway musicals for a long time were holding onto a style that had become sort of retro. It’s a constantly changing scene, there’s no one thing, and it moves in different directions. This year, for example, in the fall Broadway season, there is an unusually large number of plays by African American writers that is certainly a reflection of a lot of the cultural discourse that happened last year and after the George Floyd murder, and so a lot of producers were responding to that conversation by saying “well, when we come back, we’re gonna lead with this.” It wasn’t a collective choice, but that’s what ended up happening, because everyone had the same idea. This was an unusually fast reflection of the culture, possible in part because everyone had suspended their seasons anyway. The entire culture evolves and theater reflects that evolution.
Me: Do you think COVID-19 is going to change the ways that theater is produced in any permanent ways?
AF: It’s hard to know. If people continue to feel awkward about going out with large groups of people, then theater will certainly suffer. If it dies down and it becomes just like, “oh remember the great flu of 1918” then I think it has a good chance for recovery. The challenge is staying afloat during these times, in part because COVID has harmed tourism, and Broadway theater, in particular, has become quite dependent on tourist attendance. For these shows to keep running when a big part of their audience base is reduced that’s a real challenge. How things go in the new year will depend in large part on the course of the disease.
Me: Do you think there’s gonna be a hit coronavirus play or musical in like 15 years?
AF: I don’t know. I don’t think there will be a hit one. There might be something that takes it on, but it’s a little on the nose. There might be a show that is centered in this time and obliquely uses the concerns or reflects the concerns of this time. And a lot of creative people had a lot of time off in the past year, so I don’t doubt that a lot of the work that we’ll see in the next few years will reflect some of the changes that happened to them during the past year. “Come from Away” is sort-of about 9/11, but it’s about something that happened in relation to 9/11. I have seen some other shows that have tried to address 9/11 and they have not been able to. You can make stories out of people’s decisions about how to deal with it or about the way that they interacted with each other during it, or the way that isolation forces people into confronting themselves, but it won’t be about medical drama.
Me: Hopefully you’re right.
AF: I don’t know, maybe there will be a great way to do it. I want to stay open to anything.
Me: You have touched on this a little, do you think that these plays should be made more accessible?
AF: There’s a lot of different things that can make theater seem a little out of reach for people, and they all have different issues attached to them. One thing that did come out of this past crisis was streaming theater. Although it’s tricky because it’s not really theater in a very specific sense — in the sense that it isn’t a live event, but is a recording of a theater production or it is theater people doing a live video production. One thing it did call attention to is the lack of full captures of shows that people might be interested in seeing. In Great Britain, the National Theatre, for example, has a long-running series of cinematic releases of their place where they have multi-camera highly-skilled captures of the performances. Commercial Broadway really doesn’t do that and with the success of “Hamilton” last year for Disney and “Come from Away” this year, more and more people are realizing that there is a market. There are a lot of people who don’t live in New York or can’t afford to go to the theater and would love to see shows in this way. Hopefully, there will be more of that and hopefully, that’s one lesson that we’ve learned from the past year.
Me: I read your article about the best performances of the Tonys, and that got me wondering what you think goes into making a great performance?
AF: For a good Tony performance, a combination of things. One factor is how it was shot. A number that works like gangbusters in the theater, you take it out of context and plunk it down at Radio City Music Hall you lose some of that energy and compression and excitement that the number has. And sometimes, the opposite happens, and a good number can really be heightened by the camera. The smaller numbers tend to do better because they don’t get lost in the space. Some of the bigger numbers that are now playing to 6,000 seats were designed to play to 1,000 seats. But mostly the material has to be there to begin. Sometimes there will be one where the material isn’t great but it just lands like gangbusters in the performance. A lot of it is the choice, and that can be very important for the show. “Grand Hotel” is a solid show with one absolutely phenomenal number that they sold like crazy on the Tonys, and that performance kept the show open for two years. That’s the dream: when you go to the Tony Awards, that it will really connect with an audience.
Me: Do you think that the Tonys work well as a showcase of these types of acts?
AF: Yeah. It’s one of the only times that the national audience can see what’s happening. It’s still the gold standard in terms of presenting Broadway’s wares to a national audience. It’s a national advertising platform, but it also celebrates mostly New York productions. New York theater is a local industry and it is amazing that it has this national platform and I think it’s great. It’s a celebration of the whole process of making Broadway theater.
Me: Do you think it was more difficult for people to vote for shows they hadn’t seen in a while?
AF: In a weird sort of way, it kind of evens the playing field because often people vote in May and that’s why there’s a big crush of shows that open in March and April. They want to be foremost in the voters’ minds, and so shows that open in the summer or fall can be at a disadvantage. In this case, everyone was at least a year out, so in that respect, it’s probably evening the playing field a little. I think it made less of a difference for me, because I pay very close attention to these things because of my job anyway so I remember these things more than a more casual voter might. But it’s a strange year all around, and not everyone had a chance to see everything. Only the people who did see everything can vote, and that might change the way that the voting goes.
Me: When it is time for you to vote do you ever go back and see shows?
AF: There have been times in the past when I’ve gone back when something opened earlier in the season and they will sometimes invite voters back to refresh their memories.
Me: So this is the question going back to when you talked about how you became a theater critic. From there, how did you become the president of the Drama Critics Circle?
AF: At that point, it was a two-year rotating gig and I had some changes that I thought were overdue, so we had a little election. I won, and I ended up doing this second term, and then by that point, I was sort of entrenched in everything. I have been doing it for 16 years now (which is way longer than the previous record of four). I think there may be some people coming up that have some interesting things that they want to do, and it may be my time to step aside soon. That doesn’t require that much responsibility, that position is mostly we get together twice a year and we vote on awards.
Me: What do you want people to know about the Tonys that you feel is misunderstood about them?
AF: I think there are a lot of things that people don’t understand about them. I publish these explainer pieces all the time about the way the voting goes down. If you go to our Tony page, you can see some pretty in-depth coverage of the evolution of this year’s Tonys. There are those kinds of little nitty-gritty things. I think that one fundamental thing that people seem to get wrong is that people think that they should be open to off-Broadway shows and things like that, and that’s just not what the Tonys are — for various reasons, but mainly practical ones. There aren’t enough seats in off-Broadway theaters to accommodate Tony voters, the end. It can never happen unless they change the entire way that Tonys are awarded. If they are awarded by a committee, then they could do it that way but then it wouldn’t be the Tonys. The point is that you have a broad voting base and specifically focus on Broadway theater. There are awards for off-Broadway shows and they are their own thing.
Me: Thanks! I just have one more question: Where do you want Broadway theater, or maybe just theater in general, to go? Are there any trends popping up that you’d like to continue?
AF: Yeah! I want it to keep on pushing in new directions and I want it to keep challenging us. I would prefer that people write new scores — it’s more interesting to me and it feels less compromised. There are certainly ways to take jukebox musicals and make them into something artistically interesting, but it’s difficult because that wasn’t the thing for which those songs were originally conceived. I would love it for New Yorkers to get back into the habit of going out to the theater more and reclaiming it as the New York cultural activity that it is. When it works for me, theater can be really thrilling and engaging in a special way. It’s a very special event that New Yorkers and visitors should in my ideal world, be taking more advantage of. Partly that’s going to be on the theaters themselves to create work that is interesting and relevant, and I encourage producers to put more adventurous stuff on Broadway. But, if they do, then they have to also find that it is commercially viable. So that’s on us as an audience to go to that work and support it. It’s a beautiful experience.

This week, Carnegie Mellon welcomed goats back for their fifth visit to campus, “one of the herd’s favorite spots to munch,” according to the Allegheny GoatScape website. In conjunction with Carnegie Mellon University’s Sustainability Initiative, Carnegie Mellon partnered with Allegheny GoatScape, a Pittsburgh nonprofit created in 2017. After three days on the job, the goats made commendable progress eating away at the vegetation on the hill between Gates and Purnell. In fact, it takes the goats less time to clear the area each year, asserting victory for goats and passersby alike. 
From the University of Pittsburgh’s Greensburg Campus  to the Erie National Wildlife Refuge, the goats have made appearances across Western Pennsylvania. In an interview with The Tartan, Allegheny GoatScape Founder and Executive Director Gavin Deming said that transportation is easiest when sites are close to the organization’s home base in Pittsburgh’s Northside, but they have made trips as far as two hours away with relative ease. “The goats, when we’re finishing up a project, they know when there isn’t much food left,” he explained. “They know when they hop in that trailer there’ll be food on the other side, so they’re pretty good at working with us to get into the trailer.”
With their successful track record and indisputable charm, the goats have a full schedule ahead of them. According to Deming, their grazing season is between late April and mid-to-late November. Popular demand for Allegheny GoatScape has led to a waitlist on their website for the 2022 season, although the organization prioritizes grazing in public spaces like Frick Park and the Great Allegheny Passage.
Allegheny GoatScape touts a win-win platform; landscapes are protected from invasive vegetation, and the goats indulge in their favorite pastime. After all, Deming said, “That’s what they do: they eat.” Though it might be impossible to clear some terrain with a weed-whacking machine, goats could easily scale it. This is an especially useful trait in Pittsburgh, a city notorious for its hilly topography. The goats are also an environmentally conscious alternative to pesticide deployment. Ecological benefits aside, the herd also lightens up the mood on campus.
“I’d heard about using goats instead of machines before,” Master of Science in Robotics student Seth Karten said, “but I’ve never actually seen it in practice. I thought it was really interesting that they were doing cliffside landscaping. I’m all for it.”
Allegheny GoatScape splits its grazers into four herds. Each is provided what Deming describes as a “guardian donkey” that guides and protects the group. Team Sunshine, led by GoatScape’s youngest mini donkey, came to Carnegie Mellon this year with all 10 of its grazers. The goats munched through invasive vegetation from Wednesday morning to Friday afternoon. Typically, Deming said, it takes a herd two weeks to clear an acre of land; the goats usually take on spaces between a quarter of an acre to an acre and a half (about the size of a football field). Currently, two herds are taking on an acre each at the Flight 93 Memorial in Somerset County, PA.
As colder weather approaches, Deming and the other Allegheny GoatScape staff are making preparations for their goats. With the addition of two new herds to the organization since last winter, it has yet to be determined where they will live during the off-season. Regardless of location, the goats will happily eat their way through winter and emerge this spring to continue their work against invasive overgrowth.

As the COVID-19 pandemic caused a worldwide halt to life in March 2020 and Carnegie Mellon University transitioned to virtual learning for the rest of the Spring 2020 semester and beyond, dance- and performance-based organizations at the university found themselves in a uniquely difficult position. The Tartan spoke with representatives and members of some dance organizations to find out how they navigated the pandemic and the virtual semesters and how they are staging a comeback for this in-person semester.
While Spring 2020 was a virtual semester starting in March, Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 were hybrid semesters with about half of the student community on campus. “We tried a lot of different things,” said Matías Jonsson, a captain of the Carnegie Mellon Ballroom Dance Club and fifth-year senior in physics and computer science, speaking of how the organization managed to function during the hybrid semesters. They did not conduct any in-person meetings and instead adopted some virtual learning measures like conducting social events on Gather.town and paying their coaches to “continue teaching things that members could work on on their own” via Zoom.
Dance sessions on Zoom, it appears, were a common measure undertaken by many dance organizations on campus. But it came with its own set of challenges. Jonsson explained that though one could learn technique and how to move through Zoom lessons, learning how to move with a partner — an essential skill in ballroom dancing — would be hard to work on in a pandemic setting.
Ashima Sharma, a captain of Carnegie Mellon Jiya, the all-female Bollywood fusion dance team, and a civil engineering senior, echoed the sentiment. Jiya is a group dance team whose choreography involves synchronized movements among its dancers. “The whole point of dancing is you’re dancing on the same beat,” she said. “It’s really hard to achieve that sync at all over Zoom.” Members of the team were scattered across the country and faced a wide variety of technical issues; they experienced trouble with audio and video transmission delay, poor WiFi and internet connectivity, and live streaming-related problems. Despite the issues and the resulting annoyance, Sharma said, it was nice to be able to be social and active.
Some managed to have in-person meetings with the few members on campus during the hybrid semesters, but the strict COVID-19 mitigation rules on campus premises naturally limited interactions and brought up other issues. Having facial coverings on while performing meant adapting to not being able to emote through facial expressions. Sharma explained that members of Jiya learned to practice moving their eyes more often, and wore costumes and choreographed movements that emoted what they could not.
Besides the mask mandate, activities that entailed physical exertion, such as dancing, required 10 feet of social distancing. SLICE worked with the Cohon Center and the athletics department to add visual indications in places like studio spaces to assist the organizations in maintaining distance.
Many organizations felt challenged by only being able to perform indoors with limited capacities and few options to have an end-of-the-year performance according to Elizabeth Koch, associate director of SLICE, in an emailed response to questions from The Tartan. SLICE and the Activities Board worked together to advocate for the outdoor stage last year, which was used by organizations to record dance videos and host limited in-person, end-of-the-year performances.
Keeping up member participation also proved challenging for many organizations throughout the virtual semesters as more people experienced Zoom fatigue. For Lili Chang, who was the artistic director for the Carnegie Mellon Helix Dance Crew at the time and is now one of their choreographers and a senior studying business and computer science, trying to keep the team morale high was a priority. She explained the importance of camaraderie with people in the team, and the effect the loss of it has in a group setting. “Everyone going to practice and talking to each other … [it] doesn’t happen over Zoom, so it kind of makes going into practice really dreary,” she rued.
“It was draining,” revealed Jonsson. “Every semester, we would see fewer people show up to the Zoom calls. And there was nothing we could do.” At some point, people were so exhausted from Zoom calls that adding one to their schedule just so they could dance alone in their rooms was not feasible. “[If] everything being hybrid had lasted one more semester, I think our club might not have made it,” he admitted.
As many students returned to campus this semester for the first time since the pandemic started, it was also an opportunity for the organizations to rejuvenate and recruit. The new COVID-19 mitigation rules, while still requiring facial coverings on campus, now also require students, staff, and faculty to be fully vaccinated with exemptions for medical and religious reasons, and indoor gatherings of up to 50 people are now permitted. The success of the Activities FAIR on Sept. 14 resulted in a large number of signups for many organizations.
“Seeing over 100 people come and then seeing them continue to come back to our lessons and seeing how excited they were to learn how to dance — it brought back my motivation,” revealed Jonnson, recollecting the Ballroom Dance Club rush this semester. To abide by the COVID-19 indoor gathering rules, they divided the Rangos Ballroom in the University Center into three rooms and had about 50 people in each room during the rush events. According to him, they had over 200 people sign up for the mailing list and 60 of them paid membership dues.
Chang, too, is happy to have her team members interact in the same space again. “Having people cheer for each other, and hype each other up  —  it was really fun,” she said, reminiscing about a choreography homework session where everyone has to choreograph their own small thing and then perform it for the team. “That’s probably one of my favorite moments, just watching everyone dance.”

“We are not an experiment. We are the underdog; the underestimated. We are the ceiling-breakers. We are the celebration of culture and joy that will persevere after an embattled year. We are the surprise.”
This was the caption to Simu Liu’s instagram post in response to Disney’s CEO’s comment describing the first majority-Asian cast Marvel movie “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings” as an “experiment.” But this has not been the only instance of unfair management of the release of a Disney movie. Due to the pandemic, the premieres of both “Shang-Chi” and “Black Widow” were up in the air between movie theaters and Disney Plus. In a rather last-minute decision, Disney CEO Bob Chapek confirmed the theatrical-only release of Shang-Chi on Sept. 3, 2021, and the Disney Plus release 45 days later while "Black Widow" was set to be released in both theaters and Disney Plus (for an extra $30 fee). This created major issues for the box office results of “Black Widow,” as the estimated revenue was 67 percent lower than the company had hoped for after box office revenue plummeted dramatically after opening weekend.
Scarlett Johansson, the star of “Black Widow,” took things into her own hands by suing the Walt Disney Company for allegedly breaching its contract with the hybrid release of “Black Widow.” In a press release on Sunday, July 18, the National Association of Theater Owners criticized Disney’s decision to simultaneously release “Black Widow” in both theaters and Disney Plus, stating that the success, or the lack thereof, “demonstrates that an exclusive theatrical release means more revenue for all stakeholders in every cycle of the movie’s life.” This has also inspired Emma Stone, star of Disney’s “Cruella,” to “weigh her options,” according to “The Hollywood Reporter” Editor Matt Belloni, in terms of legal action against the company for the same issue.
In addition, Marvel fans have voiced their opinions. Many took to TikTok to rant about the lack of marketing and advertising for “Shang-Chi,” agreeing that Simu Liu was left to do the promotion of the movie himself on his social media. One TikToker (@offscreenpodcast) shared a video stating his views on Disney’s lack of action. “Is it just me or does it seem like the marketing for this movie is just not happening, like, the only person that’s been hyping it up and posting is the main guy,” he said.
The budget for “Shang-Chi” was also found to be one of the lowest movie budgets ($200 million) among Marvel Cinematic Universe movies probably due to the disproportionate attention and money devoted to making Disney Plus a success. Disney Plus lies in a gray area that is reminiscent of the beginning of Netflix when it was in limbo between an online streaming service and renting movies. It also makes it hard to justify paying $30 for a movie in addition to the subscription versus just paying the subscription to watch a full TV show, such as “WandaVision” or “Mandalorian,” two of the most popular streamed television programs this year.
To give Disney the benefit of the doubt, we must take into consideration the complexities of dealing with the distribution of cinematic media during the pandemic, but for arguably two of the most anticipated movie releases of the year, shouldn’t Disney have handled these issues better? Although nothing can be done about the reaction and revenue after the release of the movie, the bulk of the effort should have been placed on the advertisement and marketing for the movies. Although “Shang-Chi” did incredibly well despite low expectations ($90 million four-day opening weekend), the treatment of its promotion is representative of the perception and value put on Asian Americans, a highly marginalized group in cinema. The first all-Asian and Asian American cast movie, “Crazy Rich Asians,” was only first released in mainstream media in 2018. Several more followed, such as “The Farewell” and “Minari,” but why does it feel as if movies with diverse casts are being made for monetary gain? “Minari” was supposed to be a telling of a true Asian American pioneering story representative of multiple generations, but why was it so underfunded and essentially undervalued? At a budget of just under $10 million dollars, it proves that although Asian Americans have just begun to be fairly represented in media and cinema, there is still much more to be done and fought for.

There’s a story of a large empire that attempted to conquer or prop up a smaller nation that fundamentally did not want to be governed by outside forces. It’s the story of the British empire in Afghanistan. It’s the story of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. It’s now also the story of the United States in Afghanistan. 
If there’s any confusion over labeling the U.S. as an empire, allow me to elaborate. Though it is labeled a republic and we preach the values of democracy, we still conquered territory through our history like any empire would. The U.S. still has many territories around the world, and we have major spheres of influence where we have made other countries reliant on us, primarily for economic reasons. This isn’t a prescription of judgment on whether this is good or bad. Rather, it’s important to understand history and imperialism to understand just what went wrong in Afghanistan.
Let’s start with some brief history. When the British empire was in Afghanistan, they ruled by dividing and conquering, resulting in many shifting alliances that never truly solidified British rule over Afghanistan. The Soviet Union faced opposition from the anti-communist Mujahideen during their attempt to take over Afghanistan. It was only inevitable that the U.S. nation-building campaign was also doomed to fail. 
During the British and Soviet attempts to take control of Afghanistan, the goal was primarily territorial. They wanted to expand the size of their respective empires and exert their influence and power. The U.S., however, entered Afghanistan as part of the War on Terror. It was a reactionary move after 9/11 that intended to destroy Al-Qaeda and anyone who provided them sanctuary, such as the Taliban. In the early stages, it seemed to have worked. By 2002, the Taliban was nearly decimated. So where did nation-building factor in?
It’s very clear that the United States also wanted to exert its own influence and power in the reconstruction effort in Afghanistan. George Bush evoked George Marshall in his 2002 speech when he called for reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan. The reference to the famous World War II reconstruction plan in Germany and Japan was no mistake. Just as the Marshall Plan was meant to further extend United States primacy, so was the Afghanistan reconstruction effort. Building a government that preached and upheld U.S. values in a region that the U.S. had a fraught history in would have been a major push forward for U.S. interests.
But there are major differences between the Marshall Plan and the Afghanistan effort. First, the U.S. had not actually fully won the war yet. Second, there was not enough funding for the plan in the first place, with only $38 billion allocated from 2001-2009 for humanitarian aid and reconstruction. Third, the U.S. diverted resources away from Afghanistan toward Iraq, which only further jeopardized nation-building efforts. Fourth, and most importantly, is that the government that was propped up by the U.S. and its allies would never be considered fully legitimate because it was a government propped up by outsiders. Now, in 2021, that government has fallen, and the Taliban has taken control of Afghanistan again. 
To further elaborate, let’s turn to Carter Malkasian, a civilian advisor for the military in Iraq and Afghanistan. He had interviewed a Taliban scholar about why the Taliban had such an edge in the battlefield against the better-trained and better-equipped Afghan army, who had the backing of the U.S. and NATO. The scholar’s answer was simple: we fight for belief; the army fights for money. 
If the Soviets and the British couldn’t compete when their objectives were territorial, how could the United States compete when our nation-building goals were mainly ideological? Not only were we outsiders, but we were aggressors. Thousands upon thousands died in the collateral damage caused by the war, which only gave the Taliban more legitimate reasons to continue fighting the U.S. and the Afghan government backed by us. 
It goes to show that modern imperialism has not evolved but shifted to fit the modern world order. The glory days of imperialism and colonization saw European empires partially motivated by a sense of superiority, that their whiteness could save the “savages” they deemed below them. Of course, that’s far too racist for modern sensibilities. Territorial expansion is also far too aggressive for modern sensibilities too. Instead, the imperial superiority complex has taken the form of who has more liberal ideals. Democracy and freedom are values to be spread around the world, but the goal is not an altruistic one as promoted on the surface level. A world that cherishes U.S. values is a world which the U.S. dominates.
To reiterate, this is not a prescription of whether this is good or bad. What’s important to take away is that ideological wars are not something the U.S., or any other empire for that matter, has the capacity to truly win. Afghanistan has served as the most recent example of this. Ultimately, it is up to the individual nation and the people of that nation to determine what it is they want for themselves. No outsider empire, such as the U.S., can achieve that goal by force, even if they were truly altruistic in nature. Besides, the U.S. should focus on upholding its own values at home first before it tries to force those values on others.

In 2004, the movie “Hotel Rwanda” premiered in theaters, gaining critical acclaim, along with three Academy Award nominations. Don Cheadle played Paul Rusesabagina, a businessman who used his hotel to shelter and save over a thousand people during the Rwandan genocide in 1994. During this dark time in history, more than one million lives were lost after Hutu nationalists massacred the population of the Tutsi minority. A few years after the genocide, concerned about his family’s safety, Rusesabagina relocated his family to Belgium in 1996. He traveled the world, speaking to people about his experiences during the genocide. Film executives heard about his story, and began working on a movie with Rusesabagina. After the release of “Hotel Rwanda,” his platform grew and grew, resulting in Rusesabagina receiving the Presidential Medal of Honor in 2005. 
Rusesabagina, now a permanent resident of the U.S., started to speak out against the current government in Rwanda, accusing President Paul Kagame of rampant corruption and poor treatment of the Hutu population. Rusesabagina quickly became a controversial figure in Rwanda, as many accused him of lying about his claims regarding the Kagame regime. Moreover, Rusesabagina’s backing of the National Liberation Front (FLN) landed him in hot water after an FLN attack resulted in nine deaths. However, Rusesabagina has repeatedly claimed that he had no involvement whatsoever in these attacks and strongly condemned the group's use of violence. 
After his accusations of Kagame, the Rwandan government began to look for a way to silence Rusesabagina. Their plan came to fruition when Rusesabagina took a GainJet flight to Dubai on Aug. 31 of last year. When the plane took off, Rusesabagina was quickly bound and gagged. A few hours later, the plane landed and he found himself in Rwanda. Kagame and the Rwandan government had paid off GainJet to divert the plane. Rusesabagina was then arrested and charged with murder, terrorism, and arson, among other crimes. Since then, he has been held in captivity waiting for his trial. Recently, his trial took place and Rusesabagina was sentenced to 25 years of prison by the Rwandan court system.
While one can argue about whether Rusesabagina carries some of the blame for the actions of the FLN, most can agree that the way he was brought into Rwanda was abhorrent. Ned Price, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department stated, “The United States is concerned by the Government of Rwanda’s conviction of U.S. lawful permanent resident Paul Rusesabagina on September 20. The reported lack of fair trial guarantees calls into question the fairness of the verdict .... We urge the Government of Rwanda to take steps to examine shortcomings in Mr. Rusesabagina’s case and establish safeguards to prevent similar outcomes in the future.” Furthermore, Price criticized the lack of access Rusesabagina had to attorneys and noted how the circumstances of his trial gave him fewer rights than what a defendant would normally have in Rwanda.
To put it lightly, Price's statement just isn’t enough. I fully understand that Rusesabagina is not a fully innocent man. It can easily be argued that his sheer association with the FLN means he needs to take responsibility for the horrendous actions of the group. But even if Rusesabagina is a guilty man, it is very difficult to justify a private company and a corrupt government joining forces to kidnap and imprison a permanent resident of this nation. Some American politicians have spoken out on this, most notably Marco Rubio, who “demands that Paul be set free.” But sadly, larger names such as former President Donald Trump (who was in office when Rusesabagina was kidnapped) and President Biden have not said anything about the issue. Biden might think that having his state department put out a toothless message might mean something, but it comes off as hollow. Even though Rusesabagina was flying from Dubai, he is still a permanent resident of this country and we have an obligation to protect him. I’m no expert on foreign policy, but I do know that we could have done and said more. President Biden could have at least taken the time to personally rebuke Rwanda. This country’s lack of action on Paul Rusesabagina sets a dangerous precedent as well. Now that Rwanda has gotten away with effectively kidnapping Rusesabagina, what’s to stop other foreign governments from trying the same thing?
When people needed his help, Rusesabagina risked everything he had to save them. We in the U.S. watched “Hotel Rwanda” and wished that we had his courage and fortitude. But when his rights are being infringed upon, the world is silent. Now, I know Rusesabagina may very well be guilty of these crimes, but it is undeniable that his kidnapping made this trial anything but legitimate. Through his lack of action, President Biden is tolerating the unlawful abduction of American residents. I urge you, President Biden, speak out against the actions of the Rwandan government and in doing so ensure the safety of our residents in foreign nations.
