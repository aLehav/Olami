The men’s and women’s track and field teams traveled to New York City last weekend to compete in the UAA Championships, hosted by New York University. The women’s team finished in sixth place of the seven teams in competition with 53 points, while the men claimed second with 177.
Throwers from both teams exhibited tremendous performances at the UAAs. Zachary Erra-Hernandez, a junior thrower who is finishing off a season full of new personal records, won the discus event, throwing 44.69 meters. First-year Paul Hamerski threw 52.36 meters in the javelin in a third-place performance, while junior Nathan Cheek and David Markowitz added fourth- and sixth-place performances, respectively, in the javelin. Gino Pilato placed third in the discus with a 43.79-meter throw.
Junior distance runner Joshua Newby cited the throwers as one of the key components to the Tartans’ success at UAAs, saying, “the throwers were clutch today.”
On the women’s throwing side, senior Sarah Menio threw the discus 32.73 meters for sixth place, and senior Carissa Iannone won eighth in the javelin with a performance of 28.61 meters.
The distance team excelled as well. Newby, who placed first in the steeplechase and fourth in the 5,000-meter run, said, “everyone performed really well,” elaborating, “Billy Littlefield scored us a point in the 10k, and Marc-Daniel [Julien] scored for the 1500-meter.”
Sophomore Tommy Vandenberg won the 800-meter with a season-best time of 1:52.77, placing him as the 14th-fastest 800-runner this season in Division III.
Senior Ben Nealy and first-year Marc-Daniel Julien each finished in fifth place in the 400-meter dash and 1,500-meter race, respectively. Newby said, “the most exciting moment for the team was when Marc-Daniel Julien, a first-year, improved by five seconds in the 800 yesterday and a 10-second gain for a PR [personal record] today.”
Julien said the UAAs was “personally the best track meet of my year.”
The women’s distance team faced intense competition from teams including NYU and the University of Chicago, but still saw a 37:19.69 second-place finish in the 10,000-meter by senior Emily Wobb.
Sophomore Halley Bayer won eighth and junior Elise Hall claimed ninth in the 5,000-meter, while senior Leila Bouabdellaoui received ninth in the 3,000-meter steeplechase.
“We had a pretty good showing... maybe this year was more of a learning experience than anything else,” Bayer said.
Sprinters and jumpers had a vital role for the team. Sophomore Mike McDermott won the high jump in a 1.98 meter jump. Also winning was the 4x400-meter relay team of first-year Doug O’Connell, Julien, senior Noel Titus, and Vandenberg. Titus finished second in both the 100-meter and 200-meter competitions.
First-year Ben Neiman, competing after struggling with injuries for a portion of the season, placed third in the 110-meter hurdles with a personal record of 15.72 seconds, and junior Mike Standish claimed third in the 400-meter hurdles with a season best of 56.72 seconds. First-year Brandon Hoane placed seventh in the triple jump.
From the women, Jacqueline Guevel swept away the competition in the hurdles, winning the 100-meter event in 14.43 seconds and the 400-meter in 1:02.23. Her 100-meter performance is ninth in the nation, while her 400 is fourth; Guevel qualified for Nationals during UAAs due to her impressive times.
Sasha Spalding finished sixth in the 200, and Jenna Asperslag, who pulled her hamstring prior to the final heat in the 100-meter dash, still walked through the finish line to give a point to her team.
“The team overall did really well all around on the field and on the track,” Julien said. Both the men’s and women’s teams will travel to Allegheny College’s Gator Invitational on May 10.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s Ultimate team, Mr. Yuk, took part in the USA Ultimate’s Ohio Valley Division-I College Open Regionals this weekend. The team went 4–2 this tournament and ended up tying for fifth after being awarded the third seed at the onset of the tournament.
Head coach Aaron Kane said the team was disappointed with the overall result, having high expectations of finishing in the top two. The team took solace in the fact that the loss came against the best schools in the conference. Captain Nipunn Koorapati, a master’s student in electrical and computer engineering, said, “[We] wanted to be a strong contender in the region, and we definitely were, regardless of the final place result.”
Mr. Yuk had a busy weekend, with six matches over the course of Saturday and Sunday. On Saturday, the tournament featured a round robin format, in which teams were split into groups of four and played three matches against the other members in the group.
Carnegie Mellon faced Saint Joseph’s University and emerged with a 13–8 victory after pulling out to an early lead and never relinquishing it. Mr. Yuk then focused on Millersville University, whom it beat 13–7. Mr. Yuk ended up losing the last game of group play with a score of 11–12 against the University of Cincinnati. The teams were evenly matched, but the Tartans could not pull ahead before the time ran out. It was a position Mr. Yuk has been in many times; Koorapati said “the team played in a lot of close games all year.”
For the last match on Saturday and all of Sunday, the tournament’s format became a single-elimination bracket, with seeding decided by results on Saturday. Carnegie Mellon’s 2–1 record meant that the team had to win all of the single-elimination matches to advance to Nationals.
Mr. Yuk hit the ground running, winning the first two matches of the single-elimination tournament against Shippensburg University (14–12) and Kenyon College (14–10). The team was playing well with high energy all weekend. The runs off the disc, the quick combination throws, and even the long bombs were finding their marks this weekend, Kane said.
When playing Pennsylvania State University, Carnegie Mellon brought that momentum with them and jumped out in front early, leading Penn State 8–6 at halftime; however, Carnegie Mellon’s lead shrank until the team ended up losing 12–14. “We played them close, and we were up at half-time; we just came up a little short,” Koorapati said.
Kane said of this weekend, “There was a ton of effort, but any shortcomings came down to lack of depth and not executing [in vital moments].” The loss ended the tournament and the season for Mr. Yuk.
Mr. Yuk was proud of its season; according to Koorapati, they went into the season wanting to be competitive against the best teams in the conference, and they met that goal. The team also had a strong season overall: Mr. Yuk went 24–8 all season and never lost more than two games in any one tournament. The team also improved upon particular aspects of its play: Kane explained, “often [Mr. Yuk] would start ahead a lot, and in the past, prior teams would not hold on, but this team rallied and got better at finishing those games off.”
That level of stability is something that Kane is looking forward to building on while cultivating further new talent going into next year.

The Tartans took second place in the UAA Conference Championships for the first time since 2009 in women’s tennis this weekend, sealing an overall record of 12–7.
The women’s tennis team began their championship run with a 9-0 victory over the University of Rochester on Thursday morning, marking head coach Andrew Girard’s 300th career victory.
The Tartans started the match with three wins in doubles action as junior Katie Cecil and sophomore Angela Pratt won 8–3 at No. 1 doubles, sophomore Bryn Raschke and first-year Brooke Tsu won 8–1 at No. 2 doubles, and senior Alex Tapak and sophomore Lydia Utkin won 8–1 at No. 3 doubles.
Cecil won her No. 1 singles match, followed by a No. 6 victory by Raschke. First-year Elizabeth Martin and Tsu each turned in wins at No. 3 singles and No. 4 singles, respectively.
The final two singles victories came from Pratt at No. 2 singles and first-year Abbey Hamstra at No. 5 singles.
On Friday afternoon, the team beat the No. 10 Washington University in St. Louis to advance to the semifinal round of the UAA Championship Tournament. After falling behind 1–0 in doubles play, the No. 1 pair of Cecil and Pratt came back at 8–4 to tie the match at 1–1. Raschke and Tsu came back from a score of 0-3 to win their second match of the tournament and give the Tartans a 2–1 lead with an 8–4 victory.
“The best part of the weekend was having that great doubles and team wins to get revenge against Wash. U,” Raschke said.
Following Tsu’s tough loss at No. 4 singles, Cecil won the Tartans back the lead at 3–2 with a 6–2, 6–3 win at No. 1 singles.
Martin was next up in singles play when she won 7–4, 6–1 at No. 3 singles for her second win of the tournament. With only one more point needed for the team victory, Pratt led with a three-set come back win No. 2 singles. Pratt overcame a 6–0 deficit after the first set to win 6–4 and 7–5 for the fifth and deciding match point.
The final point for the Tartans in Friday’s match was won by Raschke at No. 6 singles.
Unfortunately, the team was unable to carry the momentum from Friday into Saturday’s championship game. The Tartans lost 9–0 to the No. 3-ranked Emory University Eagles. Although there were first-set wins in singles play from Martin and Hamstra, both lost in the third set by their opponents.
The Tartans now look forward to playing in the NCAA Regional Tournament on May 10. “We fought hard in our matches and cheered for each other among courts,” Raschke said. “We look forward to NCAAs.”
Hamstra said, “This weekend was really important for us as we approach NCAAs, and our second-place finish and win over Emory really showed what we can do when we work as a team.”
“I would like to see us carry the team unity we had this weekend into Regionals and come out with a win,” she added.

The 16th-ranked Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team suffered a tough 6–3 loss against Case Western Reserve University on Sunday morning to take fourth place in the UAA Conference Championships. This makes the Tartans’ record 13–7 for the season.
“We’ve had some tough losses to deal with this weekend, but they’ve been against good teams and we’re looking ahead now,” first-year Yuvraj Kumar said.
The team received points in the match against Case Western from the doubles win by sophomore Bryce Beisswanger and Kumar, along with a win by senior Duke Miller at No. 3 singles and a No. 6 singles victory by senior Jooho Yu.
Although the Tartans led 4–3, the match point came down to the No. 1 and No. 2 singles games, both of which were heart-wrenching tiebreakers. Both sophomore Christian Heaney-Secord and Kumar won their first sets but fell in the last two sets.
Yesterday’s loss was especially tough after a 5–4 loss to No. 3 Emory University Eagles just the day before. Yu and sophomore Thomas Cooper tied the match at 1–1 with an 8-5 win at No. 2 doubles before Beisswanger and Kumar came from behind to win 9–7 at No. 3 doubles.
Holding a 2–1 lead, the Tartans fell in singles matches at No. 4 and No. 3 to lose the lead before first-year Abhishek Alla won 6-2, 6–2 at No. 2 singles. This tied the overall score at 3–3.
After Alla’s win, the Eagles regained the lead with a win at No. 5 singles and secured the win with a victory at No. 6 singles.
“We are still trying to come together as a team,” Heaney-Secord said. “We are close to having a breakthrough but haven’t gotten one yet. We played Emory really tough though.”
The Tartans’ losses were preceded by a victory Friday against the University of Chicago. Carnegie Mellon began the match sweeping doubles play before taking a 4–0 lead as Alla won 6–1, 6–2 at No. 2 singles.
Alla’s victory was followed by a win by Heaney-Secord, who sealed the Tartan’s victory by winning a three-set match, coming back to win in 6–2, 6–1 after dropping the first set 5–7.
Carnegie Mellon then sealed the win at No. 3 and No. 4 singles. Miller won in with 6–0, 4–6, 6–4 at No. 3 while Kumar won 7–5, 6–3 at No. 4.
Overall, the team remains positive and looks forward to future matches and new opportunities to improve its record.
“We had a good win against Chicago, which really boosted our confidence into Emory,” Kumar said. “I think we’re just getting better with every match and if we make NCAA regionals we’re going to come out firing.”

The NFL Draft — and the TV spectacle that it has become in recent years — ended this weekend. The Steelers came into the draft aimed at getting younger members on their offensive line and the entirety of their defense. The Steelers also had to replenish some of the depth at their skill positions like quarterback, running back, and wide receiver, after losing players to both free agency and age.
The Steelers’ first-round pick, the 17th overall, was Jarvis Jones, an outside linebacker from the University of Georgia. Jones does not have the prototypical physical attributes desired in a standard 3–4 outside linebacker, but more than makes up for it with his speed, strength, and quick play recognition. He was drafted to replace all-pro linebacker James Harrision, who was cut as the Steelers desperately tried to get under the salary cap this offseason.
Picking Jones is not without risk, though, since he comes with a shaky injury past. Jones started his career with University of Southern California, but was not cleared to return to play after suffering a neck injury during his first year, prompting the transfer to Georgia. Jones also lacks some of the pass-rushing technique needed to exceed at the professional level, often quitting on a rush if it is not initially successful.
In the second round, the Steelers took Le’Veon Bell, a running back from Michigan State University. Bell was taken in an attempt to add some stability to a backfield that shuffled through Rashard Mendenhall, Issac Redman, and Jonathan Dwyer due to injury and performance issues. Only Dwyer is still with the team, so Bell will bring some much-needed depth. Bell is a strong running back who fits the traditional Pittsburgh ground-and-pound offensive style, while also bringing the pass-catching ability to work in the modern pass-oriented league.
Markus Wheaton, a wide receiver from Oregon State University, was worthy of the Steelers third-round selection. Wheaton has the measurables to be a starting receiver in the NFL, but doesn’t always play like it. Wheaton has great speed, but can be a little iffy on his route running, neutralizing most of that advantage. He is stepping into big shoes, as Wheaton was drafted to help replace receiver Mike Wallace, who left for the Miami Dolphins in the offseason.
With the first of their two fourth-round picks, the Steelers selected all-pro safety Troy Polamalu’s eventual replacement in Syracuse University safety Shamarko Thomas. Thomas is a physically punishing safety, very similar to Polamalu, but does not yet have the instincts and vision that made Polamalu great. Thankfully, Thomas will have a year or two to spend backing up Polamalu to learn from one of the best.
The second fourth-round pick was used on quarterback Ben Roethlisberger’s new backup, quarterback Landry Jones from the University of Oklahoma. Jones was picked to avoid having the aging Charlie Batch fill in for Roethlisberger for the fourth straight year. Jones can make and throw in the book, but he is slow in his release, which gives defenders a chance to close whatever hole he was trying to throw into. Jones was part of a quarterback class that was largely unimpressive compared to last year’s and took a slide in the draft as a result.
The Steelers addressed their age at cornerback in the fifth round by selecting Terry Hawthorne out of the University of Illinois at  Urbana-Champaign. Hawthorne is a tall, long corner with the speed and the physical attributes to be a great player. His on-field performance has not lived up to this physical prowess, though, and his field vision and instincts leave much to be desired. Hawthorne can be frustratingly inconsistent, showing flashes of greatness followed by stretches of being out of position and making bonehead plays.
The Steelers rounded out their draft with sixth-round picks, Justin Brown, a wide receiver from Oklahoma, and Vince Williams, a linebacker from Florida State University, plus a seventh-round pick, Nicholas Williams, a defensive tackle out of Samford University.
Overall, this was a good draft for the Steelers — it firmed out the team’s foundation that will hopefully allow them to outperform their 8–8 record from last year. They filled in many of the depth issues on offense and found current and future replacements for the aging defense. The further development of last year’s top two picks, guard David DeCastro and tackle Mike Adams, should aid in the transition of the Steelers from an aging veteran team to a youthful, experienced one.

A simple telephone game called Polly hardly seems like a life-changing technology with the potential to aid developing countries. However, Carnegie Mellon Language Technologies Institute professor Roni Rosenfeld and Ph.D. student Agha Ali Raza’s use of Polly to help illiterate people in Pakistan get in touch with prospective employers does indeed have that potential.
Polly is a simple game in which a caller can record a message, add various funny sound effects, and send it to a friend. The user begins the game by calling Polly’s number. “It’s a missed-call mechanism,” Raza said. “When you call, Polly doesn’t pick up, but instead calls you back so you don’t have to pay for the call. This is because the people with whom we are working with are generally poor so they are sensitive about the air-time cost.”    
Next, the user records a message. Polly then plays back the message with several different sound effects, such as the “I have to run to the bathroom” effect, the “drunk chipmunk” effect, the “whisper” effect, or background music. The user then selects one of the effects and gives Polly the number of the friend whom it will be sent to.
“A system as simple as Polly is easy for people here to use,” Raza said. “But in developing countries it’s a big challenge for people because they expect a person on the other end of the phone. So how do we teach them? One way is to develop something so fun that they want to learn it themselves.” 
Polly is this development. It teaches low-skilled and illiterate people how to use speech interfaces in an entertaining way.
But as fun as it is to send silly messages to friends, that’s not all that Polly is capable of doing. In Polly’s main menu, there is also an option to listen to job postings. “Part of our team is working in Pakistan,” Raza said. “They scan the daily newspaper and try to find advertisements that are suitable for low-skilled workers. These are updated every two to three days.” Examples of such jobs include positions for maids, gardeners, and drivers. 
This unique feature offers illiterate individuals the opportunity to apply for jobs they wouldn’t have heard of otherwise. Polly also gives the option of forwarding advertisement postings to friends. “It’s very hard to reach people who aren’t educated and can’t read or write,” Rosenfeld said. “You can’t reach them through newspapers or through billboards. The only way you can reach them is by sound — by voice.”
Polly has been an extreme success since it first launched last May. According to a live tracker of Polly online, its overall call volume has reached over 160,000 users and job advertisements have been listened to by over 380,000 callers. There are approximately 700 job advertisements posted in the system; this means that, on average, each job advertisement has been listened to around 500 times. In addition to job postings, Raza and Rosenfeld are looking into how to incorporate surveys and public service announcements into Polly. This way, Polly can both disseminate and gather information. Other possible directions for future expansion include giving reports on health, agriculture, or weather — things that people need on an everyday basis.
Polly is currently centered in Pakistan, because that is where Raza is from, which makes it easy for him to communicate with the people there. “It’s generally a good idea to have locals working with you who can also understand the work you are doing,” Raza said. They plan to launch Polly in India next week, and they will continue to expand it in the years to come. “We will just write down the phone number and give it to some low-literate people and tell them to call it and see what happens,” Raza said. “That’s how we launched Polly in the first place, and that’s how it took off.”
In fact, Raza and Rosenfeld only gave Polly’s number to five Pakistanis last May. “We haven’t given it to anybody else. Polly spread by itself,” Rosenfeld said.
Polly is a simple game, but it exemplifies a concept that has the potential to make a big difference in the world: using entertainment to reach underprivileged populations. If Polly spreads throughout the rest of the world as fast as it spread through Pakistan, it will change millions of lives.

Robots that track your inner body’s functions may seem like science fiction, but Carnegie Mellon researchers are working to create electronically active, edible medical devices that can be implanted in a patient’s body. This development would essentially allow patients to ingest devices such as drug delivery systems or biosensors in pill form, and would be far less invasive than traditional methods of implantation. The device would move through one’s gastrointestinal (GI) tract like food. Christopher Bettinger, assistant professor of materials science and engineering and biomedical engineering, along with Jay Whitacre, professor of materials science and engineering, have completed the first step in the process by designing edible power sources for such devices.
The battery, designed with materials that are safe to consume, is also meant to be taken in pill form. “We have designed a battery that is made of simple, biocompatible materials that are consumed daily in common diets.... This is a platform technology that can serve as a power supply to drive active electronics on any edible medical device,” Bettinger said via email.
The devices are designed with flexible polymer electrodes and a sodium ion electrochemical cell, which allows the device to be folded into an edible pill that can be consumed by the patient. “The device is simply swallowed and follows the normal path of food through the GI tract,” Bettinger said. The battery’s power supply lasts roughly an hour, and the remnants pass through the patient’s system as waste within 18–24 hours. This method makes the battery economically efficient.
“This battery is designed for one-time use without recharging. The idea is to make them very cheap so that ingesting at one device per day would be economically feasible,” Bettinger said.
The development of this device is the beginning of an innovation in the way medical procedures are performed. “Making batteries that are able to power edible devices enables the integration of medical devices noninvasively for a variety of potential functions including sensors, drug delivery systems, etc.,” Bettinger said. “One example would be that we can perhaps have a system that can deliver large protein molecules to the body by programming their release in the small intestine. We haven’t done this yet, but it’s a potential application.”
While there are some technological hurdles to overcome, such as ensuring that the device is packaged well enough to withstand the acidic environment of the stomach, the team has ensured that the process is at least psychologically comfortable and biologically safe for patients. “We think there is a big future in edible devices because most patients are comfortable with swallowing a pill,” Bettinger said. Furthermore, the safe and biocompatible design of the device largely reduces the risk of any negative side effects as it passes through the GI tract.
The development of a safe, economically efficient power source has set the foundation to begin the development and widespread use of edible medical devices that perform targeted functions and offer treatments.
“The battery that we have developed is just the beginning. Once you have the battery technology down — which we do — this opens up a lot of different applications in actively powered edible electronics,” Bettinger said.
Bettinger and Whitacre believe that edible electronic devices will likely promote additional integration of the device with tissues and biological matter in the GI tract, according to their paper. Other applications of their edible pill may include monitoring the tissue of the GI tract, and even electrical stimulation of these tissues for treatment of digestion disorders.

Though practicing math problems may sound dull and even repulsive to some, three students happily put their math skills to the test by representing Carnegie Mellon in the William Lowell Putnam Competition, one of the most prestigious math competitions in the country. They took fifth place in the competition.
Each participating school sends a representative three-person team to compete. The school’s ranking is essentially the sum of the team members’ individual places, with lower-sum teams ranking higher. The team members — sophomore mathematics majors Albert Gu and Michael Druggan, along with first-year Science and Humanities Scholar and mathematics major Linus Hamilton — regularly attend the weekly Putnam seminar, taught by assistant professor of mathematical sciences Po-Shen Loh. There, they prepare and practice math problems from topics covered by the undergraduate math curriculum including analysis, algebra group theory, combinatorics, and more. 
The teammates also met for three hours every Sunday and occasionally did problems by themselves to prepare for the Putnam Competition.
This year, 4,277 American and Canadian undergraduates from 578 institutions participated in the competition, which was held in December. The students were given six hours to solve 12 complex mathematical problems using a combination of creative thinking and concepts taught in college mathematics courses. In total, 138 Carnegie Mellon students participated in this year’s competition, and 30 placed in the top 500. Hamilton placed in the top 10.
According to Gu, problems that appear in the competition act as brainteasers because “they have a different flavor from math” and they differ from problems that a mathematician typically encounters. The peculiarity of problems may be what inspired the three to compete in the first place. All three had been competing since high school.
Carnegie Mellon placed among the top five of the nation’s teams. It is possible the team members’ success came from constant practice and starting early.
“I feel that this year, there weren’t any problems that [were] especially out of the ordinary,” Gu said.
Druggan also felt confident going into the competition. “I was good at math, so competition was fun, even though I didn’t learn anything,” he said.
All members agreed that math contests like the Putnam Competition bring them satisfaction since they help strengthen their problem-solving skills.
Despite their bright attitude and seemingly impressive results, the team members met some obstacles during this year’s Putnam. Gu and Druggan agreed that they did not fair as well in the recent Putnam as they did in past competitions.
“Some problems were just hard; the solution came out of nowhere, and it [was] hard to come up with,” Gu said.
Druggan echoed Gu’s sentiments. “Unfortunately, everyone did poorly on this [year’s competition] because the hard problems were just too hard,” he said.
According to the team members, some of the problems they ran into included missing fine details that judges deemed important, and not being able to conjure up creative solutions quickly enough. However, the team remains undeterred in their future math competition pursuits. After all, competitions like the Putnam are meant to be activites that students like Gu and Druggan accomplish in addition to going to class and doing homework.
“Coming in fifth was a nice surprise, but we hope to do better next year,” Gu said.

If you ever find yourself being interrogated in a room similar to one found in Law and Order, you might wonder if the mirror in the room is a one-way mirror, a mirror that is reflective on one side but transparent on the other. Once you know how one-way mirrors work, however, you can understand various ways to tell them apart from ordinary mirrors.
Let’s first look at how normal reflective mirrors work. Basically, a reflective mirror is a glass sheet with its back surface silvered. The silvered surface reflects the light that falls on the mirror. This reflected light creates the perception of an image behind the mirror.
One-way mirrors, on the other hand, have only their front surface partially silvered. This coating is very thin and allows a large amount of the light falling on the mirror to pass through, while reflecting the rest. The reflected light gives the perception of an image. The rest of the light passes through to the other side.
But if one-way mirrors let light through and the persons behind it can see you, why can’t you see them? The lights in the place behind the mirror are dimmed or the room is simply left dark; in contrast, the room in which the mirror is kept is brightly lit. So for the person looking into the mirror, a lot of the light falling on it from his or her side is reflected back, but barely any light is transmitted from the other side. However, a great deal of light passes through the glass into the dark chamber on the other side, allowing the people there to observe the activity in front of the mirror.
This knowledge leads to the critical question, “How do you tell if a mirror is a one-way mirror?” While there are multiple ways to tell them apart, one simple test is extremely effective. Extend your hand toward the mirror, so that your fingernail just touches the mirror. If you see a small space between your nail and its image, it is an ordinary mirror. However, if the nail and its image are touching each other, you should be aware that it is likely to be a one-way mirror and someone may be observing you. This technique works because ordinary mirrors have the back surface silvered, leading to a gap between the nail and its image. One-way mirrors, on the other hand, have their front surface silvered, so there is no gap.
Another technique involves turning the light off on your side and shining a flashlight at the mirror. This would reverse the effect of the one-way mirror, and you should be able to see through to the other side. In an ordinary mirror, you would just see your reflection. 
Alternatively, you could rap on the mirror with a knuckle. A real mirror, which is backed by a wall, will give a muffled sound, while a one-way mirror will produce a much sharper sound. This sharp sound is similar to what you hear if you rap your knuckle against a pane of glass, such as a window pane.

Hookah smoke has carcinogens and carbon monoxide
Despite the common misconception that smoking hookah is safe, researchers analyzing regular hookah smokers have identified that using a hookah three times a day exposes one to more carbon monoxide and the carcinogen benzene than smoking a half-pack of cigarettes. The study asked 13 healthy volunteers who smoked both cigarettes and hookah to only smoke hookah for four days. After a week, the volunteers were asked to smoke only cigarettes for a week. On average, the volunteers smoked hookah three times a day and had eleven cigarettes per day. 
The researchers took urine samples and determined that the amount of benzene, which is linked to leukemia and lung cancer, was higher when the users smoked hookah instead of cigarettes. Breath tests also indicated that volunteers smoking only hookah had 2.5 times the amount of carbon monoxide in their breath than when only smoking cigarettes.

Studies show monkeys conform to social norms
Researchers at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland recently noticed a pattern of fickleness in male monkeys when they emulate the behavior of other monkeys. The researchers observed the behavior of wild vervet monkeys in South Africa and found that adult males migrating into the group quickly caught on to the social norms of the group.
They tested social conformity by giving some groups of monkeys blue and pink corn. In some groups, the blue corn was meant to taste repulsive; in others, the pink corn was. After some time, monkeys in each group only ate the colored corn that was initially considered “good” even when researchers presented both colors that tasted the same. When male monkeys moved to a group that ate a different color, however, the researchers noticed that the males would eat the same colored corn as its new group despite its previous experiences with that color.

Large HIV vaccine trial study halted after poor results
Scientists are currently halting the largest study of an HIV vaccine, stating that there is no way the study would show that the vaccine can prevent HIV. The $77 million study, which involved over 2,500 subjects, met its goal for participants a few months ago. The study had shown that 41 percent of those who received the vaccine contracted HIV, compared to 30 percent that received placebo shots. While these statistics do not prove the vaccine actually increased the risk of contracting HIV, researchers also determined the vaccine failed to help. The participants will no longer receive any shots, although they will continue to be monitored for the next five years, in hopes that the study will still glean helpful information regarding a vaccine for HIV.
This study, which used a weakened cold virus called ade5 to transport HIV genes for the vaccine, may halt other HIV research using similar biological methods.

Einstein’s theory of relativity passes toughest test yet
Einstein’s theory of relativity, which is in opposition to the quantum theory of physics, recently passed its toughest test yet. Scientists have been tracking a celestial system containing a neutron star two times the mass of the sun and a white dwarf star. They orbit each other every hour and a half. Astronomers’ observations of the system have remained consistent with the theory of relativity.
The astronomers believed that the system, which exhibited extreme characteristics, would not emit gravitational radiation predicted by Einstein’s theory. However, the scientists were able to observe the gravitational radiation by measuring the time of arrival of radio waves sent from the neutron star over a long period of time.

Scientists discover incredibly small fairyfly insect
Two scientists have recently discovered a minuscule wasp that is only two times longer than the width of a human hair. The wasp, named Tinkerbella nana after the Peter Pan character, is a fairyfly, a type of wasp found across the world that is typically parasitic. The paper written by the two scientists theorize just how small an insect can get. The authors state that a winged insect cannot get smaller than 150 microns in order to fly, which is only 100 microns smaller than Tinkerbella.
Despite its incredibly small size, there have been two insects already discovered smaller than Tinkerbella.

Federal authorities plan to no longer protect gray wolves
Federal authorities from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service plan to drop the gray wolf from the endangered list in the lower 48 states, after 18 years of protection. The species, which had been hunted almost to extinction in the West and has since rebounded, is now a nuisance for many ranchers and farmers in the western United States. Some have continually lobbied to remove the wolves from the endangered list.
The protection of the gray wolves will now be left to the individual states. California, in particular, is considering imposing its own protections. Although the federal authorities believe that de-listing the wolves is a success, many conservationists and scientists are skeptical and frustrated about the decision.

The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust held its quarterly Gallery Crawl on Friday. The Gallery Crawl is a grand tour around the galleries, shops, studios, and restaurants of Pittsburgh’s Cultural District and is free and open to the public.
The Gallery Crawl features an eclectic selection of venues, artists, and performers designed to reflect the lushness and variety of Pittsburgh’s flourishing art scene. It includes both professional and amateur works of art and performance, as well as the wares and services of independent local vendors and businesses.
With nearly 40 stops to see and even more events to visit, the Gallery Crawl was completely overwhelming. It is impossible to cover all of the events even in four hours. Throughout the night, there were restaurants filled with activity, music filling the streets, and people rushing in and out of venues; it is almost the exact picture you would think of if asked to dream of a city.
The venues that inspired the atmosphere of the night were just as important as the aura of the Gallery Crawl. There were some truly awe-inspiring works on display. For instance, in the Wood Street Galleries, Gregory Barsamian’s exhibition Memento Mori features a dozen or so fascinating and dark machinations. Using strobe lights and spinning kinetic sculptures, Barsamian is able to create a new creature altogether, a sort of mesmerizing Frankenstein of sculpture and film. Based on his dream recordings, Memento Mori features works that are dark, intense, and surreal. There are paper worms writhing around in tiny rooms, paper bags breathing in and out, and human hearts turning into birds.
Another incredible exhibit is Tony Tasset’s Magnolias for Pittsburgh, an outdoor installation on the corner of Seventh and Penn avenues. Magnolias features a deceptively simple concept that nonetheless manages to stun: two bronze magnolia trees placed in a landscape with a few live magnolia trees and some ivy.
At first sight, it is almost impossible to tell that the flowering magnolias are indeed fake; each petal of every flower had been individually hand-painted and the tree itself had been cast from a hand-sculpted replica. The trees, with their fresh, eternally blooming pink flowers on dark black boughs, exude an ethereal sense of beauty that becomes even stronger the moment you realize the trees are not real.
Another highlight of the evening was the Night Market, a gathering of local Pittsburgh vendors to display their wares. There was an incredible variety of vendors there, selling food, jewelry, beauty products, art, clothing, accessories, and more. The Night Market was an amazing opportunity to see the creativity and workmanship of these local artisans and buy souvenirs.
Yet another major component of the Gallery Crawl was familiarizing audiences with the local community. The Gallery Crawl itself required attendees to venture into restaurants and buildings all around the Cultural District and invited exploration into what the city had to offer. There were also a number of venues dedicated to showcasing work from students in schools around Pittsburgh, as well as from local artists and businesses.
One of the venues that featured the most student work was the Trust Arts Education Center, which displays the works of Pittsburgh public schools students, grades K–12. There is an undeniable charm in the works of some of the younger students: a sense of innocence and imagination, filled with bright colors, smiley faces, and the occasional sense of great artistic promise. Among the older students, there is a more refined sense of creative expression and a wide variety of subject matter, ranging from marriage to race to transportation. After a few hours of seeing professional artwork, it was relaxing to look at the work of these younger artists.
Other venues were focused on exploring a certain concept or theme in their exhibits. For instance, the SPACE gallery— partnered with the mentoring program Strong Women, Strong Girls (which has a branch at Carnegie Mellon) — featured Mean Girls, an exhibit designed to raise awareness of bullying among girls in America and to encourage positive social change. Another venue, the August Wilson Center for African-American Culture, celebrated and honored the vivacity and diversity of African-American culture in Pittsburgh.
On perhaps a less sociopolitical note, there were also medium-specific venues such as the ToonSeum, which features the work of cartoonists and animators. The ToonSeum is part museum and part comic book shop, a combination that would excite any cartoon aficionado. Featuring political cartoons, Sunday-morning newspaper comics, and animated movie stills, the museum takes visitors on a lovely little trip down memory lane to rediscover the magic of cartoons and animation and appreciate the medium in a new light.
The evening also featured a number of performances and musical acts. For instance, the Arcade Comedy Theater, which specializes in alternative and improvisational comedy, continually held brief, bite-sized snippets of improvisational comedy throughout the night. Also, its neighboring venue, Harris Theater, played regionally made short films shown on a loop.
Pittsburgh public school students also put on a number of performances. Between the Trust Arts Education Center and August Wilson Center there were student musicals and choir performances, a fashion show, and plenty of dance shows.
The Gallery Crawl is a unique opportunity to experience what Pittsburgh has to offer in terms of culture and entertainment. The only complaint it raised was that it is only a one-day event; it would be more successful if it spanned over two days. During the Gallery Crawl, there were many performances that played at the same time, making it impossible to see the events all in one night.
Anyone who lives in Pittsburgh should go see the Gallery Crawl at least once. No matter the person, the Gallery Crawl will have something to please them. But most importantly, it is an integral part of the city experience. There is a tangible thrill of excitement and grandiosity up and down Liberty and Penn avenues, with music and activity infused in the evening air, as you pass the shops, restaurants, and bars on an art excursion.

If you’re currently reading this article and don’t know the story of William Shakespeare’s Romeo & Juliet, you should probably just stop reading. No? All right, if thou doth persist. The timeless classic tells the story of young lovers Romeo and Juliet whose respective families are locked in a perpetual feud. Their love goes through multiple trials until they finally find peace in committing suicide in each other’s arms.
Just about everyone has been told this story, so what makes a production of the play stand out is how the story is told. The School of Drama’s production of Romeo & Juliet, directed by voice and speech professor Don Wadsworth, definitely takes an interesting and relevant approach to the time-tested tale.
This Romeo & Juliet is set in the modern day, and this setting helps bring forth many of the central themes of the play. Phone cameras and Facebook statuses figure prominently in the characters’ actions, and costuming and music choices firmly establish the play in the present. By setting the 500-year-old tale in the ecstasy-fueled, individualistic culture of today’s youth, this production conveys the continued resonance of Romeo and Juliet’s story and illustrates why this show will never die.
Romeo and Juliet perfectly capture the rush of being in love and the desire to make that feeling, that one moment in time, last forever despite daunting circumstances. The violence of the play also speaks volumes about the needlessness of the deaths in today’s society, especially since it all occurs amongst youth. Just as with the recent explosion of mass shootings around the country, the youth of Romeo & Juliet die for reasons completely unknown to them, and that makes their drive to fulfill their lives all the more powerful.
As with most School of Drama productions, the acting as a whole is top notch. Senior acting major Brian Morabito takes full advantage of the extroverted Mercutio, turning him into a whiskey-swigging, coke-sniffing loose cannon. Senior acting major Marquis Wood’s Tybalt perfectly complements Morabito by matching that level of energy, but with laser-sharp focus. Senior acting major Alex Spieth’s Nurse kept the audience in stitches throughout with her sharp comic delivery and occasional sips from a flask.
And of course, it wouldn’t be Romeo & Juliet without a Romeo and a Juliet. Senior acting major Adam Hagenbuch and senior acting major Grace Rao support the entire play as the title characters, and each does a great job at avoiding the usual pitfalls that accompany the roles (e.g. being whiny, foolish, immature, etc.). Senior acting major Lachlan McKinney takes the role of Friar Lawrence and does a lot of great things with it. McKinney expertly swings from providing comic relief to portraying a man helplessly watching everyone’s lives fall apart, and he does it with all the commitment and energy that makes people forget they’re watching an actor pretend to be someone else.
The set is minimally decorated but encompasses multiple levels, allowing the action to occur in numerous places. The actors all inhabit a space that’s closed in on three sides by chain-link fence, a set that highlights the urban environment in which the play is set, as well as the characters’ feeling of entrapment, both in their inability to love each other due to the feud and their inability to change their fate and eventual demise.
The decision to incorporate modern-day music into the production is an interesting one, but the music was occasionally distracting. At times it drowned out the actors or made the production feel a little bit too cinematic. That being said, when it worked (such as the use of “What I’ve Done” by Linkin Park at the conclusion of the first half) it made the play really hit you in the gut.
Romeo & Juliet is a tough play to do because just about everyone knows how it’s going to end (Shakespeare even lays it all out in the opening prologue, though this production leaves those lines for the end). For a production to have any resonance for the audience, the story must be told in a new and exciting way that they haven’t seen before. The School of Drama definitely found a good way to showcase both the talents of its students (everything from acting to set design to lighting) and prove that a play written during the Elizabethan era can still pack a punch and be relevant today. Romeo & Juliet is a play that perfectly embraces what it’s like to be young and in love, and that’s a feeling that anyone can somehow relate to.

For students who grew up in more homogenous areas, coming to Carnegie Mellon can be eye opening in many ways. One of the perks of this community is the diversity seen on campus. 
While this diversity is easily seen walking from class to class, each group also has representation on campus through the many organizations that celebrate the culture with which they identify.
One of these organizations, Awareness of Roots in Chinese Culture (ARCC), chose to share Chinese culture through its annual show, One Night in Beijing. Directed by ARCC president Victor Dong and One Night in Beijing coordinator Dennis Liang, this production is one that helps students feel connected to Chinese culture.
Because it is the one big event for ARCC each year, students old and new begin working on the show nearly two months in advance, and they find it extremely rewarding. First-year undeclared Dietrich College student Vira Shao said the reason she joined the production was that she felt “out of touch with her roots and wanted to reconnect.”
However, the performance is not just rewarding for the performers themselves: The production also compels audience members to feel connected to the Chinese culture, regardless of whether or not they identify with it. 
This year’s theme was “The White Serpent,” based on the legend of Bai Suzhen and Xu Xian, who cross the barriers between the spirit world and the mortal world with their love. The story is punctuated with dance, song, and music, many of which portray ancient Chinese traditions.
The production was engaging throughout. While the moral of the story could be considered cheesy, the actors did not take themselves too seriously, adding humor that supplemented their overall message. Students spent large amounts of time preparing for the show, as evidenced by the number of props and costumes.
While most of the acts were enjoyable, the standout performances were those that emphasized aspects of Chinese culture while fusing them with more modern qualities. One such performance, “Deep in the Quiet Night,” used fans and interpretive dance to depict an ancient Chinese poem and featured beautiful choreography. 
But arguably the best performance of the night was “A Love Before Time,” a song from the movie Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. First-year chemical engineering and biomedical engineering double major Carrie Qiu had a voice that outshone the rest, and she delivered a lovely performance at the end of the show.
One Night in Beijing was a great experience for those wanting a taste of Chinese tradition. It was satisfying to see a performance in which students are proud of their heritage and are inspired to share it with the rest of the student body.

Tucked away at the back of the Hillman Hall of Minerals and Gems in the Carnegie Museum of Natural History is a small room filled with dazzling jewels and stunning necklaces, bracelets, brooches, and more. While they look as though they could belong to royalty, in reality the precious gems in this room are the works of artist Paula Crevoshay as part of the Garden of Light exhibit.
As one enters the room, a large turquoise and gold necklace glittering under its display case immediately catches the viewer’s eye. Strategically placed at the center of the room, this necklace drew several visitors to the exhibit and was unarguably the main attraction. Nevertheless, the multitude of sparkling artifacts lining the walls could capture the attention of jewelry aficionados and those indifferent to jewelry alike.
Crevoshay, who has been designing jewelry for more than 30 years, began doing so as a hobby. After four years of learning ancient metal techniques used in India, she launched her career in jewelry design. Crevoshay’s workshops currently span the U.S. from New Mexico to New York, with additional locations in Thailand and Hong Kong. Her pieces are priced between $5,000 and $250,000, and have been compared to those by designers Fabergé and Lalique. The main reason for such steep prices is her design process: According to Whirl magazine, each piece is drawn by hand, and contains 18-karat yellow gold intertwined with gemstones that have been sourced from all over the world.
Each collection featured in the Garden of Light exhibit is entirely unique from the next, yet still unified by the common theme of nature. Crevoshay draws inspiration from the beauty of the environment, evidenced by names such as “The Undersea Garden” and “Big Blue Marble” for her jewelry collections.
The previously mentioned turquoise and gold necklace is part of “The Undersea Garden” collection. Other standouts in the exhibit include the “What is Green?” display, consisting of jewelry characterized by gold swirls and intricately carved gems in the emerald hue, as well as the water-centric “Big Blue Marble,” which contains jewels with opal, pearl, and turquoise. Yet another called “Winged Partners” pays tribute to its namesake, with glimmering brooches in the shapes of butterflies and dragonflies. Even for someone without any interest in brooches, it is impossible not to admire the elegance of Crevoshay’s designs.
Those with no inclination toward jewelry should not be discouraged from visiting this exhibit. As beautiful as the Garden of Light is, it is educational as well. There is one display of famous diamonds from around the world, where the description reads, “Many have adorned the crowns of royalty, while others have been lost in the mists of time.” Each gemstone has its source location indicated, and some are even emphasized, such as the “Tourmalines of Brazil” collection. This enchanting exhibit takes visitors out of the museum and transports them to, as the name indicates, a garden of light.
The Garden of Light exhibit will be on display at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History through Aug. 11.

After a seven-year hiatus, the critically acclaimed television comedy Arrested Development will return with a new season starting on May 26. The show, originally produced by and aired on FOX, was cancelled in 2006 due to low ratings and a lack of viewers — even though it won multiple awards, including six Emmys and one Golden Globe.
For years, there were rumors that a spin-off movie based on the show was being written and produced, Arrested Development has remained off the air and the screen since 2006. Now, the show is back — but as opposed to airing weekly on FOX, the fourth season will premiere solely on Netflix, which will release all 15 episodes simultaneously.
Renowned for its tongue-in-cheek attitude toward issues like homosexuality, incest, alcohol, and tax evasion, but Arrested Development focuses on the drama surrounding the Bluth family — drama that they cause and inevitably exacerbate. Sometimes touching and sometimes just plain weird, the show has one constant: quirky charm.
Its charm is largely due to the cast of the show, and when it was announced that the show would be revamped, there were concerns about maintaining this originality. However, despite the six-year gap since the last episode was filmed, most of the original cast will be resuming their original roles, including Jason Bateman as Michael Bluth, Portia de Rossi as his sister Lindsay Fünke, Jessica Walter as their mother Lucille Bluth, Michael Cera as Michael’s son George Michael Bluth, David Cross as Lindsay’s husband Tobias Fünke, and Jeffrey Tambor as the patriarch of the family, George Bluth, Sr. The show also features Ron Howard as the voice of the narrator in addition to his role as producer.
Many of the guest characters featured on the show are also returning to the now Netflix-exclusive series, including Liza Minnelli and Ben Stiller. In addition to the returning characters, the show also boasts a Hollywood-hefty playbill for the new season, including guest stars such as Isla Fisher, John Slattery, and Kristen Wiig.
It’s both surprising and praiseworthy that, after such a long break, the show would attract not only such a star-studded returning cast but an influx of such well-known guest stars. Perhaps even more surprising is the amount of public attention and hype the show has gained in anticipation of the new season. New memes based on the show are circulating and quotes from the show are popping up in conversation: It’s clear that people are talking about it.
While it had its shortcomings, perhaps the show’s absence has made viewers realize how much they missed the quirky Bluth family. Though the show’s past main problems have been low viewership and audience ratings, Arrested Development has always received respectable reviews from critics. Hopefully, the new Netflix exclusive series will return with a bang and make the comeback even more exciting than the original series.

Fighting with your best friend, studying for a challenging exam, pulling on a rubber band until it almost snaps — all of these things create what we define as tension. But what about a well-told story? According to Radiolab co-host Jad Abumrad, that involves tension, too.
Abumrad and his co-host Robert Krulwich have spent years developing Radiolab, a popular NPR program now in its 11th season that has become known for its accessibility in dealing with challenging scientific and lofty philosophical questions. Abumrad and Krulwich ask real questions and look for real answers that can be understood by real people — and they do so in an entertaining and engaging way. That’s something that few can brag about.
Abumrad’s talk on Tuesday, hosted by AB Lectures, was humorous, honest, and inspiring. His story is one of uncertainty, setbacks — and, well, tension. He embodies some combination of journalist, musician, producer, scientist, and philosopher, but he is none of these things in the traditional sense. The tension in his job is “the kind of tension that lies in the head of someone who’s doing something that’s hard to describe,” he said.
During college, Abumrad studied music composition and creative reading, dreaming of writing scores for film. But after writing one full score for a feature film, he realized that path wasn’t quite right for him. His fascination with the abstractions of science and nature began in his mid-20s, and it wasn’t until then that he began to find a place to combine all of his interests.
He started Radiolab with Krulwich in 2005 and has been filling a gap in science journalism ever since. Listeners have come to expect a lot from a Radiolab episode; in addition to the compelling content, the show features a unique production style. Incorporating music, sound effects, and raw interview clips — interspersed with live questions from the hosts — creates a natural flow of thought that guides listeners on a mental journey.
In many ways, each episode is like a musical composition, with slower buildup sections and high-intensity crescendos into the meat of the story. Every second of the show is more compelling and engaging than the second before, seducing the listener, as Abumrad put it. “It’s kind of slutty,” he joked.
Perhaps the most difficult part of creating the show, he noted, is balancing “the stickiness of stories and the intensity of science” to create a meaningful and memorable learning experience for listeners. Working hard to find a balance between science and philosophy, wonder and fact, Abumrad acknowledged that stress is an important part of what he does. “It means I’m doing my job,” he said.
Like any other endeavor, Radiolab sometimes has failures, as Abumrad was quick to point out. There are times when conflicts can’t be resolved on the show and when no real answer comes out of an interview. To Krulwich and Abumrad, however, it’s important to broadcast their failures, because their job is to explore the world, and failures are to be expected.
The lecture was announced just days before, which may have contributed to the low audience turnout. But for those who were there, Abumrad’s experiences held real value. As his work with Radiolab has made him keenly aware of, we are a “network of sometimes-contradictory thoughts,” and, to Abumrad, that’s okay. What really matters is how we react to the tension.

This isn’t your typical high-brow list filled with Oscar nominations or European art films. Let’s face it: Argo was far from the best picture of the year and only won Best Picture because it kissed Hollywood’s butt and featured the comeback of Ben Affleck and his amazing facial hair. The films listed below are the ones that impacted college students. They’re actually exciting, and they took us to another world without leaving us hopeless or depressed at the end (cough Amour cough). In no particular order, we present to you some of the best films of the 2012–13 school year.
Facing Morality Without Sentimentality
Flight
Don’t let the trailer fool you. While at first glance it may seem like a ridiculous plot centered around Denzel Washington commandeering an upside-down airplane, Flight presents a very real and very difficult struggle over addiction and responsibility. Washington gives a powerhouse performance as the alcoholic pilot driven to humility and acceptance over the destructive choices that make this film so believable and human.
The Sessions
A story about a quadriplegic who vows to lose his virginity with the help of a sex surrogate, The Sessions is an incredibly beautiful film about living a life unrestrained by fear and paralysis, physical or otherwise. John Hawkes provides a miraculously powerful yet accessible portrait of a man who wants to live a normal but fulfilling life — one that not only moves viewers to tears but also inspires them to do the same.
The Mind Bender
Looper
Expertly blending futuristic sci-fi with old-school gangster movies, Looper follows time-traveling mobsters who kill victims sent from the future. Rather than getting bogged down in the mechanics of time travel, Looper instead focuses on thorough character development, allowing for a meaningful and contemplative story arc.
Seven Psychopaths 
Written and directed by legendary playwright Martin McDonagh, Seven Psychopaths is a refreshing black comedy crime film with an all-star cast that delivers amazing performances and biting wit. The film begins with a seemingly harmless and playful plot around a struggling screenwriter named Marty, played by Colin Farrell, trying to find the perfect movie. He becomes entangled in a dog kidnapping plot while trying to deal with two men named Billy and Hans — played by Sam Rockwell and the incredible Christopher Walken, respectively — who run a dog-kidnapping business. Little do they know how much trouble they run into when they steal the beloved Shih Tzu of a dangerous and psychotic L.A. mobster named Charlie, played by Woody Harrelson. The story possesses incredible twists and turns that make the film very dark, yet genuinely funny within seconds. Walken is pitch-perfect as the delicately cunning Hans, and Farrell is marvelous as the anxiety-driven character driven into a whirlwind of psychopaths. Together, they make for a truly entertaining picture.
Man vs. Beast, Man as Beast
Life of Pi
Ang Lee managed to make a seemingly unfilmable book into one of the best films in recent history. The story revolves around a teenage Indian boy named Pi who has lost everything, including his family, in a shipwreck. Pi finds himself stranded in the vast nothingness of the sea with a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. A visual and spiritual masterpiece of cinema, Life of Pi is a rare treasure that makes a viewer question not only the journey that Pi faces, but how one should view life itself: Should we focus only on the inevitable dark misfortunes of life, or should we convert those misfortunes into a beautiful experience of its own? In a way, everyone has a little bit of Pi in them, which makes this film a magnificent ode to life and how we as human beings should decide to live it.
The Heart Warmers
Silver Linings Playbook
A story about mental disease and about moving on with life, Silver Linings Playbook is a romantic comedy done right. With Bradley Cooper as an estranged husband diagnosed with bipolar disorder and Jennifer Lawrence as a sex-crazed but wounded widow, there is plenty of homely spark that provides warmth and joy for its viewers. In its vulnerable characters lies the relatable core of this film, making it a journey of hope and acceptance for two seemingly messed-up characters who find each other in chaotic circumstances.
The Intouchables
A cultural sensation in its native France, The Intouchables is a storytelling miracle in which a rich quadriplegic named Phillipe befriends a man off the street named Driss and hires him as a caretaker. While it seems like an overdone formula, The Intouchables conveys fresh and true feelings of affection and love that develop in the strongest human relationships.
The Troublemakers
Django Unchained
Quentin Tarantino’s wild Spaghetti Western epic is — as expected — filled with rich dialogue and spectacular performances that make it one of the most entertaining pictures of the year. With several stylistic showdowns between a vengeful Jamie Foxx as Django and Leonardo DiCaprio as Calvin Candie — a southern version of a young monarch who likes to play sick games —  Django Unchained exceeds any other film this year in terms of explosive charisma and energy.
Spring Breakers
There are going to be expectations when Disney starlets play wild party girls spending their college spring break with a “gangster with a heart of gold” named Alien, played by a James Franco complete with cornrows, tattoos, and grills. While it may seem like an airheaded excuse for exploiting young actresses, Spring Breakers takes a sudden and dark turn that feels more like a real-life experience than an actual film. Director Harmony Korine creates a splashy, fizzy portrait of a spring break gone too far — yet he infuses it with enough life that it’s hard not become invested in the girls’ wild journey. Plus, there is a Britney Spears montage. Enough said.
The Modern Masterpiece
Anna Karenina
One of the most overlooked films of this year, the newest adaptation of Anna Karenina provides a bizarre yet entrancingly beautiful new look for the Tolstoy classic. Joe Wright, director of films such as Pride and Prejudice, Atonement, and Hanna creates a blazing theatricality that enhances the majestic Russian setting as well as the dramatic nature of the story. With Keira Knightley playing the doomed protagonist, she provides a charming and complex portrait that falls in love with the seductive Count Vronsky, played by Aaron Taylor Johnson. The film is gloriously unique with its dream-like aura and fabulous performances that uphold the classic novel’s reputation.
Hopefully, this will serve as a refreshing guide from the otherwise redundant lists that overlooked a few films. With a wide array of genres and themes, there are many great experiences to be had when watching some of the best movies that helped us survive another year as college students.

Dear Patrick,
Is it true? Is this really your last column? Who will I turn to to solve my existential crises? Who will offer pithy solutions to my banal problems?
Thanks,
Ire Necessary, Escaping Everyone, Doubtless Yearning Oncoming Unavoidably
Dear I NEED YOU,
(No one’s ever said that to me before.) Take a deep breath. I know it will be hard. I’m not sure what I’ll do when I can’t bestow my pearls of wisdom to my two loyal readers. I may have to walk up to people on the street and tell them how to properly live their lives. I’ve done that before, but who knew mothers didn’t want a 22-year-old dude telling them how to raise their kids? Is it my fault they’re doing it wrong? (Answer: Yes — I should have addressed it in this column.)
Once I’m gone, you’ll probably try to find some other substitute, going up to other dashing young men you meet and asking them for advice. When I’m gone, someone else will be taking over this column — although that person won’t be as wise as I am, or witty, or handsome. If you really rely on advice from a college newspaper, you probably have problems that can’t be addressed in this column.
Have a drink in my honor,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
I can’t move my body. I look down. My legs are jelly. Look up. The clouds are jelly. Everything is jelly. I’m on a piece of toast. The sky is peanut butter. The sky is falling. I’m in a sandwich. My bones are the crunch in the peanut butter. I smell delicious. Someone drops the sandwich. I crawl away. Giant monsters surround me. Six-legged beasts. Mandibles close around me. I try to scream. I taste peanut butter. Help.
Thanks,
I’m Hairless, Avaricious, Voracious Eating Nonstop, Ogres Mouth-breathing, Orifices Ultimately Trifle, Helplessly Am Noodles, Dying I’m Tastelessly Attacked, Somehow Tirelessly Enervated, Please, Eagerly Advise, Need Unusual Tips, Bloodlines Utterly Terminated, Terriers Eagerly Ruminate
Dear I HAVE NO MOUTH AND I TASTE PEANUT BUTTER,
Relax. There are no giant ants. It’s a dream. You’ll be okay. I’m aware of the chair I’m sitting in. The Old English changes to ashes in my mouth. I cough them up but nothing comes out. The computer stares back at me. Every time I press a key it lets out a quiet scream. It hurts. Every type hurts. The “Q” feels safe. No one hits the Q. I hit the Q. It screams louder than the rest. Where am I? The keys fight back. They press my fingers.
I cry. I can’t stop. The keys type me. What am I doing? Where am I? Someone passed out behind me. The guitar stops. My tears are now of joy. The silence is endless. Silence everywhere. I taste the silence. Please make noise, any noise. I look down and my fingers are sausages. The keys are the forks of party-goers at a fancy cocktail party. Poking and prodding. Am I cooked already? They’re so hungry. Why is everything on a skewer? Now they have to spend the whole party walking around with the skewers. I smell delicious.
Cut me some slack, it’s my last column,
Patrick Hoskins

Looper
7:30 10
In Looper, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis play the same dude, divided by time travel — one’s the hero, the other’s the villain. Writer/director Rian Johnson has an inspiring faith in love — in this case, showing that it can drive someone to evil. The film’s virtue is in its pure strength as both a genre-based product and a vessel for human observation. Looper has a few interesting things to say about time travel, but it has more poignant insights on sacrifice, morality, and fatherhood. It’s an intensely interesting picture that will one day be recognized as a pillar of science fiction.
Zero Dark Thirty
7 10 1
Last year’s media frenzy surrounding Zero Dark Thirty mostly centered around its depiction of torture in the hunt for Osama bin Laden. It’s unfortunate because, while those sequences play like an artsy version of 24, the film is otherwise an extraordinary procedural. Jessica Chastain turns in an explosive performance as Maya, a CIA agent who spearheaded the bin Laden investigation. A series of great supporting performances, a tense and forceful screenplay, and a final 50 minutes that will glue you to your chair make this a political procedural not to be missed, and one of the best pictures of 2012.
Mulan
8 10 12
Take a trip back to your childhood with 1998’s Mulan, certainly one of the finer Disney musicals of that decade. The film, set during China’s Han Dynasty, depicts the journey of a woman who masquerades as a man in order to join the army and fight against a Hun invasion. Since it’s a Disney musical, she is required to carry along a colorful pair of animals of different species — in this case, a dragon and a cricket. Mulan lacks the memorable songs of The Lion King or Aladdin, but is markedly improved by a level of visual splendor rarely achieved in animation.

Students gathered to protest outside Warner Hall on Thursday in response to an email from Carnegie Mellon President Jared Cohon, which they say could threaten the freedom of expression on campus.
Cohon's email, sent to the campus community Tuesday evening, addressed an ongoing controversy surrounding a performance at Spring Carnival's Anti-Gravity Downhill Derby, in which a female art student dressed as the pope and was naked from the waist down, her pubic hair shaved in the shape of a cross. Cohon called the act "highly offensive" and said the university is still investigating to determine whether disciplinary action is warranted.
"I regret that this occurred, and I apologize to all who were offended by this, for religious or other reasons, and especially to those who witnessed this behavior," he wrote.
The student protesters, however, say that disciplinary action against the student would represent a limitation on freedom of expression. About 20 to 30 students stood in front of the administration building throughout the afternoon, holding signs with slogans like, "I support your right to offend me" and "Don't make Downhill Derby a slippery slope." Three university police officers stood stationed in front of the doors of Warner Hall throughout the protest.
"When I read Cohon's email, I got offended that he called it highly offensive," said Anshuman Bansal, a first-year computer science major. "As president, he's the mouthpiece for the university, and I don't think that [email] represents the entire student body.... I don't think we can really have an art school if we can't accept that art will offend somebody."
Bansal held a sign that read, "No apologies for free expression." 
"His email came close to crossing a line," said Daniel Kirby, a senior physics major. "I'm not comfortable with that email, but I'm not here to protest that email. I'm here to make sure that no other action is taken, that no punitive action is taken, that the right to freedom of speech on campus is upheld as per the university guidelines."
The student artist in question, who said she was advised by the university to withhold her name from the press, said she was upset when she read Cohon's email. "Up until yesterday, I have been told that everybody in the university, all the way up the chain, has been completely in support," she said. Thus, when she received Cohon's email, she felt "like I was thrown under the bus."
"Yes, [my performance] was offensive," she said, "but look at the conversation it's started on campus."
Students were not the only ones upset by President Cohon's email. Professor Clark Glymour, a university professor in the philosophy department, submitted an open letter to a Facebook group, "Send Letters of Protest to Jared Cohon," that was formed Wednesday night. In the letter, he wrote, "Your letter to the campus concerning events in the arts parade in April of this year threatens to put you, and the University on a false footing.... Your public response was a palpably political document, promising to put the student in question through an unspecified process and calling her behavior offensive, without qualification as to who was offended."
As the student protesters held signs, they engaged passing students in conversation about the incident. Kate Uncapher, a sophomore chemical engineering and engineering and public policy double major, said that as a Catholic, "we recognize that you get to do what you want. However, when you sign up to be a student at Carnegie Mellon, you do sign up to follow a code of conduct.... The code of conduct as far as I am concerned was violated."
"I can see that others don't think it was violated," she added, gesturing toward the protesters, "but I believe that Carnegie Mellon as a private institution has the ability to tell you how you should act, because we signed up for it."
Although Cohon did not attend the protest, Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno came and spoke to some of the students, according to senior logic and computation major Madelyn Glymour, who helped to organize the protest. Casalegno commended them for being respectful in their protest. "We've been very pleased with how respectful everyone's been, by and large," Glymour said.
The incident first became controversial on Monday, when KDKA-TV reported that the Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh found the performance inappropriate and offensive. "I’m upset because I think what happened at Carnegie Mellon is really not just an insult to us as Catholics, but it was an insult to other religious denominations and it was an insult to who we are as American citizens,” Bishop David Zubik told KDKA.
The Catholic League also released a statement on Tuesday about the incident, comparing it to the ongoing investigation into the Beta Theta Pi fraternity. "CMU’s decision not to suspend this female student, who publicly ridiculed Catholics and violated the local ordinance on public nudity, while invoking sanctions against the frat boys for offensive behavior behind closed doors, is legally problematic and morally indefensible," wrote the league's president, Bill Donohue.
The story has since been picked up by larger news outlets, including The Huffington Post and conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh.
KDKA incorrectly reported that the student artist was handing out condoms. The artist clarified that she had not handed out condoms; another student, who was also dressed as the pope, had passed out condoms on his float. She explained that her performance was meant to address the ongoing sex scandals in the Catholic church and to criticize how Pope Benedict XVI handled the cases.

When it came time to give a title to his final speech before the student body, retiring Carnegie Tech president John C. Warner had a few ideas.
“Old presidents never die, they just lose their faculties,” he joked to his audience in December 1964.
As Jared Cohon, Carnegie Mellon’s eighth president, prepares to step down from the position, The Tartan takes a look back at the history of Carnegie Mellon’s other presidents and the events that marked their terms. 
The information for this article was obtained from a combination of The Tartan’s own archives, minutes and notes from the university’s board of trustees, five published books on Carnegie Mellon history, and interviews with people involved in the university’s history and presidential searches.
The resulting 110-year historical picture reflects the Carnegie Mellon of today. The institution’s presidents themselves have embodied the contrasting disciplines, backgrounds, and approaches inherent in the modern multi-faceted university. Each leader faced issues unique to his own time in office, although some debates surfaced repeatedly over the school’s history. 
One major undertaking, every 14 years on average, was replacing the president himself due to resignation or retirement.
Contrasting approaches
From the start, the executive heads of Carnegie Mellon and its predecessor institutions have come from a variety of backgrounds.
Arthur A. Hamerschlag, the first president of the Carnegie Technical Schools, was appointed with input from Andrew Carnegie himself. In November 1903 — two years before classes began — a committee from the school visited Carnegie’s home in New York City and mentioned Hamerschlag, already a prominent organizer in multiple New York-area trade schools. Hamerschlag’s background as a trade-school supporter and consulting engineer pleased Carnegie so much, the committee reported, “that he promptly suggested that we secure him at once [and] that he be paid a good salary.” Hamerschlag’s appointment was confirmed the following week at a suggested salary of $8,000 a year, plus a house on the school grounds.
The Carnegie Technical Schools were originally founded to give two- and three-year vocational educations to Pittsburgh’s working class. With his practical background and a developing close relationship to Andrew Carnegie, Hamerschlag focused his tenure on constructing the school’s physical presence and getting periodic infusions of money from its founder.
“Since [campus architect Henry] Hornbostel maintained his offices in New York, day-to-day supervision of the building projects in Pittsburgh often fell to Hamerschlag, who may have devoted half his time to campus construction,” professor emeritus of history Edwin Fenton wrote in his 2000 book Carnegie Mellon 1900–2000: A Centennial History.
School historian Arthur Wilson Tarbell, in his own 1937 history of the institution’s early years, said that the first president was not interested in academic ceremonies so much as solving practical problems as they arose. “He was not college trained; indeed his formal educational preparation had been meagre beyond belief,” Tarbell wrote. “In his fundamental make-up he was more of an engineer than an educator.”
As the Carnegie Technical Schools evolved into the Carnegie Institute of Technology — and control of the institute passed to a New York-based corporation after Andrew Carnegie’s death — Hamerschlag felt increasingly left out, according to biographers. He resigned his presidency at the end of June 1922.
Thomas S. Baker, Hamerschlag’s successor as president, was a music critic, scholar, and teacher of German literature with a Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University. He had joined Carnegie Tech three years earlier as the institute’s secretary, equivalent to vice president. Baker began his term officially as “acting president” from July 1922 until being named president in full the following February.
From the beginning, Baker’s education was welcomed by the campus community. “The announcement that Dr. Baker has been appointed president is received with much satisfaction by alumni and students,” wrote The Tartan’s editors in the Feb. 14, 1923 issue. “For he is a man of learning and also a good scholar who has devoted his life to the advancement of teaching; besides he has a great personality which has won him many friends in this country and abroad.”
Baker’s tenure at Carnegie Tech marked a halt in construction and a shift to “spiritual, cultural, and character-building efforts,” Fenton wrote. Projects ranged in scope from the paving of muddy campus walkways to advancing the prowess of Carnegie Tech’s drama program and research capabilities. Baker himself gave lectures in French and German on European speaking tours.
Within these two contrasting frameworks — down-to-earth practicality and scholarly refinement, science and art — the next six presidents of Carnegie Tech and, later, Carnegie Mellon University, set the foundation for the school as it is today.
Issues shared and unique
Some campus issues have troubled a number of the university’s administrations over the years, no matter the background of their presidents.
One such topic that rose to prominence this school year was criticism of Carnegie Mellon’s “stress culture” and accusations of insufficient mental health resources being available to those who seek them. It led to a town-hall meeting hosted by representatives of Student Affairs, the provost’s office, and student government. However, 2013 is not the only time that the student body and administrators have discussed problems with the community’s well-being.
From his first greeting to students, Baker was encouraging students to attend to their physical and mental health, as well as to their education. “Your happiness and success will be increased if you get something more from your college life than that which is secured in the class room and laboratory,” he wrote in the Sept. 20, 1922, issue of The Tartan. “I wish it were possible for every student to take part in some branch of athletics.... I hope also that every student will have a share in some phase of undergraduate social life.”
President Robert Doherty’s annual report for 1937 put the situation more bluntly: “There must be less stress; a reduction must be made in the intensity of scheduled work.”
As he was retiring as Carnegie Tech’s fourth president at the end of 1964, Warner alluded to both the nature and the amount of the university’s coursework as ongoing challenges. “We have, I believe, taken the easy way out of merely increasing our demands upon students without changing significantly what we teach or how we teach it,” he said during a lecture. “The result has been to increase the drudgery of learning without adding appreciably to the excitement of learning.”
Other issues facing Carnegie Mellon’s administrators were more tied to a particular time or place.
H. Guyford Stever, in the president’s office 1965–1972, presided over a particularly tough period as both Carnegie Tech and American society changed rapidly in the late ’60s. Stever’s administration oversaw Carnegie Tech’s complicated merger with the Mellon Institute in 1967, followed by an era of student and faculty unrest for a variety of reasons.
“CMU students may go on record as the first ones ever to throw marshmallows at a U.S. Senator,” read a Tartan article on Jan. 23, 1970, after a small number of students disrupted a speech by Senator Strom Thurmond (R–S.C.). Other acts of Vietnam-era protest included a ransacking of Carnegie Mellon’s ROTC office, blocking access to the Wean Hall construction site in support of minority workers, and a student/faculty mass meeting opposing required courses in the newly organized College of Humanities and Social Sciences.
“President Stever walked a fine line, defending the right of students and faculty to free speech while he attempted to explain his stance to the students who did not share the views of the protesters,” Fenton wrote in his Centennial History.
Lincoln Wolfenstein, a professor emeritus of physics who came to Carnegie Tech in 1948, remembered being at odds with President Richard M. Cyert, in office between 1972 and 1990, over the university’s new Software Engineering Institute and projects from the U.S. Department of Defense.
“I had this saying — we like to say the university needs money in order to carry out its function, and then in contrast I said sometimes Cyert seemed to think the function of the university was to get money,” Wolfenstein said. “So [Cyert] set up a committee to discuss this question of freedom on campus. Should there be restricted work going on, so people who did something couldn’t talk to the rest of the campus about it? Was that a bad idea and how to limit that?”
Though the SEI and the Defense Department contracts stayed, Wolfenstein gave Cyert credit for being “forthcoming” and discussing the issues with concerned members of the community.
Seventh president Robert Mehrabian took over in 1990 at a time when Carnegie Mellon’s rapid transformation into a national research university had placed increasing strains on the school’s resources, Fenton wrote. In response, Mehrabian created a structured administration where data and information were empasized — to some extent — over personal interactions.
“Rather than see individual faculty members of the university, he preferred to have them work through their deans or vice presidents,” Fenton wrote. “This administrative style functioned well, but it offended some faculty and staff members who were accustomed to having direct contact with the man in the president’s chair.”
Students expressed similar opinions in The Tartan when commenting in March 1996 on Mehrabian’s suddenly announced resignation. “Maybe we’ll get a president that we’ll actually see around,” one complained, while another rhetorically asked, “How can I miss someone I’ve never seen?”
Replacing the president
From first consideration to final selection, the process of choosing a presidential successor can take a year or more.
Cohon, set to step down from office on June 30, will be replaced by current National Science Foundation Director and former Dean of MIT’s School of Engineering Subra Suresh. Suresh was selected as president in February after a three-part process, beginning in the 2011–12 school year with the formation of a search committee and the hiring of a search firm, followed by a series of meetings to gather input. Formal proceedings of the committee — made up of eight faculty members, eight university trustees, and one trustee chair — began in July 2012.
A.D. “Tony” Rollett, a professor of materials science and engineering, was the search committee’s co-chair and 2011–12 chair of the Faculty Senate. The overall presidential search process, he said, was a combination of what was done here previously and “what we thought was a good idea anyway.”
Rollett said that the committee’s early action included drawing up a white-paper report on the desired qualities of the university’s next president — a step that was also carried out in Carnegie Mellon’s two previous presidential searches in 1989 and 1996. The use of a single 17-member search committee, however, varied from previous practices that sometimes used multiple bodies divided into faculty, trustees, students, or other groups.
Despite the difference, Rollett said the single committee worked well together under leader Jim Rohr, executive chairman of the PNC Financial Services Group. “Faculty and trustees don’t normally mix very much,” Rollett said. “There’s a certain element of ... getting used to each other.”
A new step this time around, gathering input from all of Carnegie Mellon’s department heads, was well received and produced remarkably consistent results across campus. “That was really interesting,” Rollett said. “There was a very coherent view of the university and a pretty coherent view of what the issues were.”
Successfully finding and selecting the right new president is not always a seamless transfer.
Cohon’s retirement date of June 30, 2013 — a one-year extension beyond his previous term — was formally set in August 2010, giving university administrators almost three years of advance planning time. Even with significant lead time, transitions have not always been as smooth as hoped.
Warner, who served a year as Carnegie Tech’s vice president in 1949 before being elevated to the presidency in 1950, hoped for a similar handoff on his own retirement in the 1960s, according to biographer Ludwig F. Schaefer. 
In 1961, at the age of 64 — four years before a mandatory retirement age — Warner sent a memo to the board of trustees outlining desired characteristics for his replacement. 
Search committees were set up in 1962 and had drafted desired criteria for candidates by 1963, but no presidential successor had been chosen before Warner’s preferred retirement date of June 1964.
Foreshadowing Cohon’s 2012 term extension, Warner agreed to remain at Carnegie Tech for up to an extra year. 
Stever, then an MIT professor, was eventually named as the next president in October 1964, to take over Feb. 1, 1965.
Stever’s own abrupt resignation, upon being nominated to lead the National Science Foundation, left the university lacking a president for five months. 
Without a successor in place, the Board of Trustees appointed Edward R. Schatz, Carnegie Mellon’s vice president for Academic Affairs, to fill in temporarily from February 1972. Schatz remains the university’s only acting president who did not continue into a full term to lead the institution.
The trustees had narrowed their list of permanent candidates down to four by April, but it wasn’t until May 9 that the board formally recommended Cyert, then the dean of Carnegie Mellon’s Graduate School of Industrial Administration, to the post effective July 1.
Even with the process over, some members of the board had reservations about the future. “Some trustees feel that the responsibilities of running the University are now so heavy and varied,” the May 9, 1972, meeting minutes noted, “that at the proper time we should consider complementing the president with another top officer whose main job would be to serve as a kind of ‘outside’ president for such matters as fund-raising, public relations, etc.”
Presidential legacies
With the 201 decision to name the Collaborative Innovation Center after Mehrabian, all of Carnegie Mellon’s past presidents are memorialized with at least one building on the Pittsburgh campus. They also have a presence on the second floor of Hunt Library, where university archivist J. Dustin Williams manages a collection of presidential artifacts.
Most of the collection consists of administrative materials from the president’s office, Williams said, but there are more personal items as well, including presidential correspondence, speeches and papers written by the presidents, and other memorabilia.
“I was actually just looking at a merry Christmas [message] from the faculty — kind of a nice one — that was to Baker, if I remember,” Williams said. He also singled out presidential correspondence, which gave a more personal sense of what Carnegie Mellon’s leaders thought during their times in office.
“We try to keep everything that we can that the president’s office can give to us,” Williams said, even though most materials aren’t open to the public until 50 years after they were produced. “We are in the process of trying to get more materials from Mehrabian’s time and, especially right now, Dr. Cohon’s time.”
A less physical legacy of past presidents is their effect on the leaders who replace them. 
The personal qualities of a long-term, well-liked president can become core parts of a successor’s job description.
Searching for Warner’s successor after a 39-year career as a professor, department head, dean, vice president, and president became a hunt for “a combination of academic and personal qualities that only a genius with the values of a saint and the constitution of an Olympic athlete could meet,” Fenton wrote.
Likewise, Cohon’s 16-year tenure at Carnegie Mellon left an imprint on the search for his replacement.
“Nobody was saying exactly ‘Get another Jerry,’ because you can’t,” Rollett said of last year’s input-gathering process, “but nevertheless some of those characteristics were very important.”
Suresh, as a materials scientist, does, however, share academic background with Cohon, an environmental engineer. 
“More than one trustee turned to me and said, ‘Is it necessary to have a scientist-engineer?’ ” Rollett said. “And I said, ‘No.’ ”

Panther Hollow Inn — known among students as “PHI” — formally announced that it is closing by the end of May after many years of operation. 
This news met with a great deal of attention within the university community and from local residents. 
The news of PHI’s closing drew a substantial response from the campus community, with many students concerned that this closing was an effect of Carnegie Mellon’s desire to develop the area surrounding Craig Street. 
Despite initial speculation that the closing may have been part of the university’s Master Plan, Vice President of Campus Affairs Michael Murphy released a statement stating that it was not the university who had purchased the bar.
Student body president Will Weiner confirmed this statement. 
“I got in touch with Vice President of Campus Affairs Michael Murphy and he confirmed with me that CMU did not buy the bar,” Weiner said. “Beyond that, I’m really not sure.”
Within hours of the news of PHI’s closing being shared online, a change.org petition for keeping PHI open was released, reading, “This is not about the need for alcohol, this is not about delicious greasy food, this is about keeping the love and tradition of CMU students alive.” Within three days, the petition reached 750 signatures. 
Weiner added, “It’s been an interesting reaction. I’ve never really seen anything except for when the Fence got cut up a few years ago, where the whole campus rallied around a cause.”
When asked about their memories of PHI bar, junior computer science major Dave Cummings and senior chemical and biomedical engineering double major Emerson Hum both spoke favorably of its proximity to campus. 
A master’s student in biomedical engineering responded that she had a strong attachment to PHI, saying that “it would never be the same.” 
Senior materials science and biomedical engineering double major Courtney Joe shared this view as well, recalling her fond memories at PHI and saying that a new business “cannot replace what had happened there.”
Staff at PHI stated that owner Eugene DePasquale was very upset by the closing of his bar, and was unavailable to give any comments regarding this announcement.
To commemorate the bar, students began selling PHI T-shirts on the Cut the Friday after this announcement. 
“It’s a community object,” Weiner added, “one of the few unique CMU hangout spots.”
Any future plans for the Panther Hollow Inn building are still unknown.

A Town Hall presentation open to all members of the Carnegie Mellon community was held last Tuesday to discuss two major Campus Projects: the construction of the Sherman and Joyce Bowie Scott Hall and the upcoming additions to the University Center.
Ralph Horgan, associate vice provost of Campus Design and Facility Development, began the meeting with an overview of the two projects. Dean of the College of Engineering Jim Garrett then discussed the history of the Scott Hall building.
The Scott Hall project began seven years ago as a vision of a nanotechnology laboratory. This vision took its first step toward reality when Carnegie Mellon alumnus John Bertucci (E ’63, TSB ’65) provided funding for a feasibility study. Gary Fedder, Carnegie Mellon professor and director of the Institute for Complex Engineered Systems (ICES), then put together a proposal for the building, which at the time did not receive funding. The university eventually approached Sherman Scott about possible funding for an energy institute, and according to Garrett, “Suddenly we had the different pieces, that when put together, would allow this building to move forward.”
In addition to the Scott donation, funding has been received from sources such as the Eden Hall Foundation and Richard King Mellon Foundation. 
A building design was created that would incorporate biomedical engineering, nanotechnology, and the Scott Energy Institute. Following Garrett, Fedder spoke regarding the design and contents of the building.
Scott Hall will include a clean room, or nanofabrication facility, that will house equipment used to make electronics and sensors. This room will be at the same level as the current fourth floor of Wean Hall. The biomedical engineering department labs will be housed on the same level as the clean room; biomedical engineering offices will be located one floor above. Presently, the biomedical engineering facilities are separate from the main campus and located on the Monongahela River. 
“Having them on campus and in proximity to both Wean Hall and Roberts Hall is going to make a huge difference in research and interactions,” Fedder said.
The Scott Energy Institute will be located on the same level as the Mall, or fifth floor of Wean Hall, and will house engineering for power systems, as well as battery and solar work. The space in the top level of the building has not been designated but will possibly hold the ICES Disruptive Health Technologies Institute, which will research methods to lower the cost of health care.
Furthermore, Scott Hall will contain a café similar to Tazza D’Oro in the Gates Hillman Complex, as well as conference rooms and study areas.
Visuals were then shown depicting the layout of Scott Hall. Unique features of the building include the green roof above the clean room, the anchoring of the structure on “table legs,” and the use of dichroic glass, which changes colors when hit by sunlight. 
Additionally, Scott Hall will have indoor connections to Baker and Porter Halls, Hamerschlag Hall, and Wean Hall, and will have a bridge to Roberts Engineering Hall.
Attendees of the Town Hall asked questions ranging from building design issues to parking concerns. Live construction and traffic updates, as well as a webcam, can be found on the Scott Hall website.
Following the Scott Hall presentation, Vice President for Campus Affairs Michael Murphy described the upcoming additions and renovations to the University Center. 
“Most of you are aware that athletics have been a big issue on campus. This project couples the commitment to athletics with a similarly important issue for us, which is a black box theater,” Murphy said. 
“Additionally, there’s this notion that we’ve turned our back on Forbes Avenue, because of the loading dock there…. One major piece of this is creating a much more positive front to Forbes Avenue.”
This University Center project is the second step of a three-phase endeavor to improve Carnegie Mellon’s athletic facilities; the first phase was the addition of turf to the soccer field, and the third will be the redevelopment of the Skibo Gymnasium. Although the design is not yet complete, an architect for the project has been selected. Director of Athletics Susan Bassett described the preliminary additions.
Approximately 20,000 square feet of the 48,000 -square-foot addition will be dedicated to fitness, including two exercise studios, cardiovascular, free-weight, and Cybex equipment, stretching areas, and a spinning studio.
“We’re really excited about this,” Bassett said. “It will absolutely transform our programs. I’m equally excited about the black box theater…This is going to create an appropriate, dedicated theater space for rehearsals and performances for all our student groups.”
Project manager Andrew Reilly then discussed the timeline of the project, which will be in the design phase from May 2013 to February 2014 and under construction from March 2014 to July 2015. 
Reilly said, “We’re going to impact campus.” This project will affect areas such as the drop-off next to the University Center, the parking garage entrance, and the pool. Another goal of the University Center project is to calm Forbes Avenue. Possibilities include narrowing Forbes Avenue to a two-lane road with turn lanes, improving pedestrian walkways and bike paths, and adding additional traffic lights.
During the question and answer session, some members of the university community offered suggestions or raised concerns. Mary-Lou Arscott, architect and studio professor at Carnegie Mellon, proposed that the renovations bring natural light to the basement floor of the University Center. “I have a point about the basement, which is sorely missing daylight…. This is our social life — the shops, the bank, the post office — these are the things that everybody has to come across. People are working down there … and yet they never see the daylight. It seems like a key to the community,” she said.  
Additionally, fellow architect and Carnegie Mellon studio professor Hal Hayes praised the project, saying, “I think it’s a great program. All the things that are going in here can really contribute so positively to student recruitment and retention, and faculty recruitment and retention.”  Hayes was concerned, however, about the lack of adequate dining options in the University Center.  “[One] thing I think is missing from this is that we have no decent restaurants where you can take parents, or anybody who wants to go to one of these performances. That would be a tremendous asset to campus,” said. 
According to Reilly, such topics have been in discussion and will be considered during the design process.

Students were recently asked to vote on a new design for the Carnegie Mellon student ID card.
Next year, every Carnegie Mellon student, faculty member, and staff member will receive a new SMART ID card. Those who currently have a sponsored or affiliated ID will not receive a new SMART card, as the technology on the new cards is being used for public transportation access. Currently, such access is marked by a bus icon on the ID card. 
The transition to SMART cards comes as a result of a new agreement between the university and Port Authority of Allegheny County (PAT). According to the HUB’s website, “SMART cards contain a computer chip allowing a cardholder to simply “tap” his or her card on the PAT bus (or incline or T) reader in order to gain transportation access.”
The change in Carnegie Mellon’s agreement with Port Authority also resulted in an increase in the transportation fee that students pay — from $110 to $120, according to the HUB’s website. 
Other than the change in transportation access, the SMART cards will be used in the same ways that current ID cards are used, including access to a student’s Plaid Ca$h, print quota, and on-campus residence.
The University of Pittsburgh already employs SMART-card technology, and according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, it recently extended its agreement with PAT for another five years. 
Carnegie Mellon, Chatham University, and the University of Pittsburgh — the three local universities that pay the PAT for unlimited rides — generate about 600,000 rides per month, about 11 percent of PAT’s total riders, according to the Post-Gazette. 
Students received emails asking for submissions for designs for the new ID cards. There has been some controversy among students about the three designs being offered as voting options. 
“[The new designs] are not great. There is one that’s okay, but other than that the designs could’ve been better,” said Nathan Oh, a first-year information systems major. 
Camilo Estrada, a first-year vocal performance major, agreed. “I feel like we could come up with something better.” 
The controversy over the submitted designs offered even led to an online petition on change.org, written by Jordan Wu, an undeclared first-year CFA student. 
In the petition, Wu wrote that “after viewing the submissions, I believe that the designs are not the best that CMU has to offer us. It is implausible to me that CMU, with our amazing arts and design schools, could produce designs such as these. Frankly, I would be embarrassed showing any of these designs to anyone as a representation of our school.” 
Samantha Dickinson, a junior creative writing and linguistics double major, spoke about the effect that the appearance of the ID card could have on some students. 
“I guess people see it as a reflection of themselves, so carrying around something that they don’t want to represent them could be problematic,” she said. 
The petition has over a hundred signatures and comments such as “we can do better than this.” 
Dickinson also said that she supports the adoption of a “really basic design. I don’t usually look at my ID anyway.”
When students return for the fall semester, they will be able to pick up their new SMART cards Sept. 23–27 from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at Andy’s Alcove on the lower level of the University Center.
In order to receive a new ID card, students must return their old card, or face the standard $25 replacement fee. 
New undergraduate students will receive their SMART cards during Orientation.

Attendees of an open Town Hall discussed the fate of Craig Street on Wednesday. 
Led by Vice President for Campus Affairs Michael Murphy, the Town Hall informed the audience and the Simonds Commission — which is the group of trustees, faculty, and senior administrators responsible for new projects and renovations to Carnegie Mellon properties — about the development plan for Craig Street. The Town Hall also served as a forum for community members to discuss their own opinions on the project.
Carnegie Mellon owns and leases several properties in the Craig Street area, including the recently acquired diocesan property near Central Catholic High School on Fifth Avenue.
The Institutional Master Plan for Carnegie Mellon outlines the future development of the campus and properties held by the university in the surrounding area. Murphy stressed the university’s desire to strike a balance between collegiate interests and those of the community: “We have to have the right mission, the right balance, [so Craig Street is] CMU-centric and a modern destination of choice.” 
A possible roadblock in the project’s development is the zoning designation of Carnegie Mellon’s various properties. The campus falls under an Educational/Medical/Institutional (EMI) zone, which means that the university is at much greater liberty to do what they like with the property. Much of the property in the Craig Street area is part of a residential or business zone, which means that the university has to work with more restrictions. 
Despite these possible constraints, Murphy was adamant that the university has no plans to fundamentally alter Craig Street. “We’re not talking about changing functionality, we’re not talking about throwing anyone out of their place,” he said. 
Senior biomedical engineering and materials science and engineering double major Sohini Bianka Roy attended the meeting as a representative of the undergraduate Student Senate, and discussed the stake of students in this matter. 
“The goal was essentially to have some kind of Tartan pride,” she said. “When you walk down to the University of Pittsburgh’s campus, you see that ‘Go Panthers,’ you see that pride, and we felt that Craig Street is kind of like our own little corridor street.” Murphy then opened the floor to the audience, asking “What is your vision for Craig Street?” 
The audience had a wide variety of suggestions, such as having retailers selling Carnegie Mellon merchandise, having some Carnival events there, or having a visual connection to the school, such as painted thistles on sidewalks. 
Murphy said that the current plan for representation of the university was to keep symbols “subtle yet iconic.” 
Another popular idea was asking businesses to stay open an hour or two later some nights. 
As one attendee pointed out, “[Craig Street is] a place where students could go, but then the hours would have to match their weeks.” 
The idea of closing down traffic on Craig Street to create a place for students to congregate was also suggested. Director of the Remaking Cities Institute and member of the Simonds Commission Don Carter said that the Commission had investigated this possibility, but the museums on Craig Street needed the space to let their patrons exit on the weekends. 
The audience consisted of mostly faculty, but all were clearly passionate about the project. 
Assistant Vice President for Diversity and Equal Opportunity Services Everett Tademy said, “I’m invested in the project because Carnegie Mellon is invested in it.” 
Director of Facilities Management Services and professor of civil and environmental engineering Don Coffelt was invested in the project as a faculty member and a resident of the Craig Street area. 
He expressed enthusiasm about the project, saying, “I think the only complicating factor is it’s going to take time. Because it’s complex, and you don’t want to get it wrong.... It would be harder to fix if we got it wrong than it is to go slowly and make sure we get it right.”

Special Allocation: Enactus
Enactus petitioned the  Senate for $3,000 to fund Project eLuma, a charity concert to be held during Carnival. This event was specified in the Joint Funding Committee (JFC) budget, but due to some confusion the money was never received. Because the Enactus representative was unable to answer some important questions, the Senate voted to allocate $0.
Academic Affairs
The creation of the “Thrive” wellness course is still under way, but is currently awaiting approval from Carnegie Mellon’s administration and undergoing standard checks and procedures. 
Senate has received money from the university to help the creation of “Thrive,” and has also submitted an application for a grant that funds initiatives striving to impact campus culture. 
Additionally, Senate did not receive a large number of responses to the current draft of the “Thrive” syllabus, but did receive a few of very good quality. 
Senate members were invited to give additional feedback on the course syllabus if they wished.
Campus Life
The gallery crawl hosted by Senate was not a massive success, due to conflicts with both the 1000plus service event and booth building; however, those who did attend said they enjoyed the experience. Additionally, Senate planned to give out free coffee and donuts during Move-On for Carnival.
Finance
After re-evaluating financial allocations, it was found that some people and organizations had spent less money than they were allocated by the Senate. This leftover money was added back into the Senate’s balance sheet. Student Senate is set to end the academic year in a financially stable position.
Outreach
The “Senate With You” outreach event was declared a success, with Senate members putting up balloons on the CFA Lawn despite a downpour of rain. Additionally, the publicity event “Bring a Friend to Senate Day” was also declared successful.

An open letter to President Cohon and others concerned:
Let me start by explaining something about myself. I have PCOS, or poly-cystic ovarian syndrome. The syndrome results in a low level of estrogen being produced by my body, making me skip my period, feel ill, gain weight, and suffer from bad mood swings. Around one in 10 women are affected by this syndrome. It is precancerous, if left untreated. Guess what the treatment is?
It’s birth control.
In the past and present, the institution of the Roman Catholic Church (not that I DO NOT say Catholicism) has been responsible for attempting to limit women’s access to birth control, whether they use it for this reason or for others. Condoms have been similarly stigmatized. This causes many women to face risks that will never be present for men, including myself. So, yes, I do have a stake in this conversation, the one that the girl on campus — who will hopefully remain unnamed — started during the Anti-Gravity Derby during Carnival. 
University of Michigan professor Mrinalini Sinha wrote that "Women … are conspicuous in nationalist discourses as symbols of national culture and, through the control of women's sexuality, as the markers of community boundaries" in Feminist Theory Reader.
For the institution of the Roman Catholic Church, this is most certainly the case. It fears that by allowing women freedom of expression of their sexuality, the whole of civilized society will suddenly succumb to sin and immorality.
I understand the concern — I do. But that concern has no place on a private college campus at an event where nudity is typical and in criticism of a piece of performance art that was likely sanctioned by the school itself.
Ultimately, the piece was a criticism not of Pope Francis, but of the institution of “the pope” as it stands today. This is all aside from the allegations of child abuse the church has faced in the past and present.
By allowing us to begin this conversation on campus — where the institution of the church belongs — the nameless girl has done her job, even if it was done by offending a bishop. 
I truly believe that Catholicism can be a force for good in this world. It acts as a guiding force for many people and as a source of hope for many more. My problem lies with the institution and the control it holds over the lives of non-Catholics in addition to Catholics. The fact that this girl — and I, in my turn — has received violent hate speech and her status at Carnegie Mellon is in question is evidence of the unreasonable sway it has over the public. 
When I was spoken to by CBS a few days ago, I only knew a little of the events leading up to the bishop’s complaint. 
I was approached by the reporter, Andy Sheehan, who asked me if I knew about the derby and my name before pointing the camera in my face. I answered his question of what my opinion was — “didn’t harm anyone” — and then uncomfortably edged away. He asked me to spell my name for him and I refused. “I’m not comfortable with this.” He repeated the question before I just said, “No” and left in a hurry with a friend at my side. He used the interview anyway, without my consent.
The interview was conducted badly and unethically, and not once during our short conversation did Mr. Sheehan ask for any information concerning the context of the event. He wouldn’t know that nudity is standard fare at Derby, or that her piece was likely for a school project. Least of all did he know that the message of the piece concerned the freedom of women’s bodies and was not simply trying to offend Catholics.
Was the piece meant to be offensive? Probably. I haven’t spoken to the girl, and I don’t know if I will. But, as I said, at least the offensiveness has brought an issue of freedom to the forefront of our community’s mind. 
That Carnegie Mellon would offer an apology for supporting creative examination of societal issues — and barely even talk about the other events this year — is an affront to the student body. It increasingly seems to me as though the administration cares far more about image than about its student body.
The riots in 2009 and my friend’s suicide this year — in addition to Beta’s sexual allegations and scandal regarding the possible filming of sex with a minor, where the distribution of that material barely blipped on the administration's radar — and now this? 
A girl does not deserve to be persecuted for speaking her mind, especially in a forum that is explicitly educational. Carnegie Mellon should be a place for us to experiment in our art. Yes, the parade was open to the public. Yes, nudity is expected. So doesn’t that make it the administration's responsibility to censor the projects before they are preformed? 
I’m not a fan of censorship, as you might guess, but you cannot blame the student for reflecting badly on her institution when the institution is so little involved in the events.

Laughter is supposed to be the shortest distance between two people, at least according to Victor Borge. It is a great misfortune that this simple and powerful means of communion was flagrantly subverted at a recent Carnival event, whose title seemed to be a CMU-nym for "lighthearted." The Anti-Gravity Downhill Derby float that set out to mock both the pope as well as community standards of respect was calculated for exclusion of, among others, Catholics who actually think of their "pope" in familial terms.
Since Catholics on Carnegie Mellon's campus are made of hardy stock, we consider the architects of this float themselves more the victims of their own narrow and tasteless humor than we are; it differs only in degree from the sneering humor we have become perhaps too accustomed to over the years from a variety of sources. Still, we grieve the chance to conspire with them in laughter. Even had we ourselves been the object of ridicule, it would have been fun, since "angels can fly because they take themselves lightly." The unmistakable contempt underlying this float both for our faith and its figures means we cannot, we were meant not to, share in the laughter: a pity, but not the end of the world. It does not entail — to us — any sort of administrative punishment of the students, faculty, or staff involved. Communion is not fostered by coerced censorship — nor do we Catholic students, staff, or faculty hold any grudges, if the cross is not to be emptied of its meaning.
Instead, we pray that the good name of this great university will not be diminished by the thoughtless, heedless actions of a few; that prospective Catholic students will not read either these actions or the lack of much community response as a sign that either they or their faith will not be welcome here; and that these actions will not become precedent for similar mockery to be endured here by members of other faith communities. We will smile, though, at the reality of mercy, which is the cause of both laughter and joy.

At the close of every school year, The Tartan reassesses the year’s events. We present here a list of the people and happenings that are worthy of recognition. Thistles go to people and events that had a positive effect on the campus community and the world at large. Thorns go to those that have negatively impacted the community.
A thistle to departing University President Jared Cohon, for his 16 years of unfailing and loyal service to Carnegie Mellon. We at The Tartan wish him a happy retirement.
A thorn for the recent outbreaks of mass violence. Shootings and other tragedies across the nation, including those in Boston, Mass.; Aurora, Co.; and Newtown, Conn. have taken innocent lives and disrupted the daily peace that the average citizen should be afforded.
A thistle to Randall Munroe and his webcomic xkcd, which recognized that Carnegie Mellon has the best hash bashers as part of a competitive April Fools update.
A thorn for the U.S. Senate’s inability to pass even the most mild of gun control measures in the form of background checks, displaying more loyalty to gun lobbyists than to the safety of Americans.
A thistle to the Presidential Search Committee for finding Carnegie Mellon’s next university president, Subra Suresh. Suresh is  an excellent scientist and administrator, and he will benefit the university greatly.
A thorn for Beta Theta Pi for being at the center of allegations involving the recording and sharing of sexually explicit recordings. Although the allegations have not yet been detailed or confirmed, the fact that both the national fraternity and the university have suspended the Carnegie Mellon chapter indicate that there is evidence of serious issues within the fraternity.
A thistle to both the residents of Boston and the Boston Police Department for their steadfastness and courage in the face of the recent Boston Marathon bombings.
A thorn for the administration for not updating the campus on the Beta Theta Pi allegations. The student body deserves to be kept up to date on matters regarding the safety of the campus community.
A thistle to the current Student Body President Will Weiner and Vice President Meela Dudley. Weiner and Dudley succeeded in engaging the student body with their initiatives during their time in office, including their initiative to register voters during the 2012 presidential election and watch student election debates. Their Town Hall initiatives on campus issues were a landmark for communication between students and faculty.
A thorn for a 3 percent tuition increase for returning students and a 4 percent increase for incoming students for the 2013–14 academic year. Carnegie Mellon is an expensive school even without these increases.
A thistle to Carnegie Mellon for founding the new Scott Institute, devoted to environmental and sustainable improvements of energy use. This new center aims to bring together interdisciplinary collaborators to tackle world energy and environmental problems.
A thorn to Apple and Samsung for their continuing patent wars. Both companies are innovators in the technological marketplace. They must focus on innovation and the satisfaction of their customers, rather than on lawsuits over various technologies they have both used in their products.
A thistle to Student Affairs and student government for addressing Carnegie Mellon’s stress culture, student health, and well-being, as well as hosting Town Halls to discuss these issues.
A thorn for the Hamerschlag House residents that painted the message “McGill, I could use a sandwich...” on the Fence. This message was written in poor taste and exuded sexism toward the women of McGill House.
A thistle to student government for increasing their visibility, particularly Student Senate for actively engaging its constituency through last semester’s Senate Week.
A thorn for the public parking meters on streets within Carnegie Mellon’s campus boundaries. These meters make parking expensive for students who once used these spaces to park cheaply while living on campus.
A thistle to HERB and his creators for successfully separating the cookie and cream of an Oreo — a difficult task for a robot — and bringing us one step closer to having robotic butlers.
A thorn to the Spring Carnival Committee for removing Midway Market this year. Midway Market was a valuable resources for smaller organizations to reach out to people enjoying Carnival and to connect with others in the Carnegie Mellon community.
A thistle to AB Concerts for quickly finding a replacement act for Spring Carnival after Ludacris unexpectedly cancelled. Their ability to find a good replacement — Lupe Fiasco — in under 48 hours is commendable. Lupe Fiasco’s performance was a high point of this year’s Carnival festivities.
A thorn to Pennsylvania’s Voter ID law, which would have disenfranchised many people during a presidential election were it not for the order of a judge that delayed its enactment by a year.
A thistle for recent legislation and hearings regarding gay marriage and marijuana across the nation. Legislation concerning marijuana included legalization in Colorado and Washington. The Supreme Court heard cases regarding DOMA and California’s Proposition 8. These issues revolve around personal decisions, and legislation should be passed to reflect this freedom.
A thorn to cyclist Lance Armstrong, a man who was once a star athlete who fell from grace after facing doping charges by the United States Anti-Doping Agency.
A thistle to AB Films for using the Bat Signal to announce the arrival of Batman films in McConomy Auditorium as an exciting interlude from studying.
A thorn to Innocence of Muslims, the YouTube video whose terrible production and acting was surpassed by how deeply offensive it was to Muslims worldwide, culminating in mass protests.
A thistle for the Tartan sports teams that had impressive records and accomplishments this year. The football team ended the season with a winning record of 6–4 while the club roller hockey team had a record of 14–0. The women’s tennis team placed second in the UAA Championship Conference while both the Frisbee and golf teams excelled in their division. The women’s soccer team ranked sixth in the nation and entered the Elite 8 of the NCAA Championship while the men’s team ranked 14.
A thorn to the playlist at the Carnegie Mellon Café for playing the same limited list of songs on loop throughout the year, and particularly for the inclusion of Taylor Swift’s latest singles.
A thistle for Housing and Dining Services for providing students on campus with stellar new dining options, such as Worlds of Flavor and The Pomegranate, which offers kosher options. The extended hours at Entropy+ are also appreciated by students on campus working late into the night.
A thorn to Pittsburgh mayor Luke Ravenstahl for allegations of using city funds for personal reasons and possibly knowing about misappropriation of funds by the Pittsburgh Police Bureau’s Special Events and Finance offices.

Last Monday’s article “Joint Funding Committee’s budget remarks out of line” questions the professionalism of the JFC in an unacceptable manner. In addition to drawing inaccurate conclusions, the article fails to recognize the increased transparency of the budget process.
The JFC makes decisions by considering how best to maximize every student activities fee(SAF) dollar to improve student life. Our comments on budgets are both justified and in line with our mission: questioning why previously granted repair expenditures continue to be requested, stating resource constraints, and noting lack of clarity in fiscal behavior are all necessary for responsible allocations. We also include our metrics for travel and food, giving organizations insight into our decisions.
AB Concerts’ budget increase is another point of contention. As Carnegie Mellon’s best-known tradition, Carnival impacts every student. Largely funded through Spring Carnival Committee, Carnival would not exist without JFC funding. The Carnival concert has an inherently large impact proportional to its cost, and as such, the budget increase for this event complies with the JFC’s mission.
The final point was that there was “favorable treatment of certain organizations.” It is absurd and inaccurate to state that any “exceptions” made were unprofessional. AB Tech received money for food –— as did Spring Carnival Committee — because they are organizations that enable other organizations to successfully operate. We fund their meals out of the recognition that not to do so would lead to decreased effectiveness and efficiency for the organizations they assist.
Consistently, The Tartan has chosen to focus on a so-called lack of transparency rather than the changes made to improve transparency. Throughout the budget process, the Student Body Vice President for Finance has made himself available through office hours and information sessions while JFC representatives have repeatedly met with their groups. During budget review, the JFC focuses on past budgets, fiscal audits, and actual spending, so as to carefully consider every line item.
Ultimately, the JFC wants to fund student organizations so that they can fulfill their mission, while maximizing the impact of every dollar we allocate. Ideological disagreements regarding our decisions are appreciated — accusations of favoritism and unprofessionalism are not.
Divya Krishnan and Niharika Ray
JFC Representatives

It’s almost funny now — how quickly the media and the American public suspect people of different colors of committing heinous crimes, rather than people of their own race. It’s as if every time a terrorist act like the Boston bombings occurs, people forget the anthrax scare, the Westboro Baptist Church, and even the Ku Klux Klan — all acts of terror committed by someone not of color. All certain people can see anymore are suicide bombers, the planes that crashed into the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001, and that these incidents were caused by people of a different race or nationality.
This racial profiling needs to stop. The public targets and harasses people they suspect to have committed a crime because of their skin color.
Racial profiling is not helpful even if the public does catch the criminal — it is harmful no matter what. People have argued that racial profiling is okay because the net effect is the safety of the American people — who cares if one person gets hurt to ensure millions of lives? The flaw in this kind of thinking is that the public is still only targeting people who are not white. If a white person was specifically targeted to ensure the lives of millions, people would be up in arms about individual privacy.
A Saudi Arabian man at the Boston marathon was tackled to the ground by bystanders because he had been standing too close to where the bomb went off. He had nothing to do with the bombing, but was targeted anyway, just for looking Arabian and being close to the bomb. He was the only victim admitted to the hospital that had his apartment searched while he was detained at the hospital. Even when he was cleared of any suspicion, the death threats and hate mail continued to come. The same thing happened to a Muslim student — Sulahaddin Barhoum — who was trying to become an Olympic athlete and was targeted for the Boston bombings. He will now forever live under that shadow.
Ironically, the real suspect in custody is Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, a young, white, Eastern European man.
The worst part about all of this is that people feel entitled to assume skin color or race about the suspect because of “what they’ve been through” with 9/11. They feel nothing of accusing darker-skinned people of committing these atrocious crimes because others like them have done it before, even though the public shies away from assuming the same thing about white people.
John Green, author of Looking for Alaska, said it best via Twitter after the Boston bombings: “The people of Boston don’t need amateur speculation. They need blood donations.”
The media also perpetuates racial profiling. Black people who commit crimes are immediately labeled as “criminals,” Muslims who commit crimes are immediately labeled as “terrorists,” but white people who commit crimes are “misunderstood” or “psychologically unstable.” For the case of Tsarnaev, the media made it a point that terrorism “wasn’t talked about” in their home. That wouldn't have mattered at all if he hadn't been white. White criminals are always portrayed to be more than their crime — white people are seen as people by the media even when they are criminals. People of color are debased into just their crimes — they are nothing more than what they do.
In essence, a criminal who is of color is seen as a representation of that entire race. A white criminal is seen as an exception, an anomaly.
The media is also incredibly invested in keeping a division between domestic and international terrorism, though most stations are willing to concede that it is terrorism, no matter who is committing the act of terror. Terrorism is terrorism, even if it occurs domestically.
Not all Muslims are terrorists, and not all Christians are with the Westboro Baptist Church. People have to be judged not by race or nationality, but by their actions and character.

The Boy Scouts of America (BSA), after delaying their decision regarding a change to policies banning gay members, has announced a new and baffling stance: You can be gay and a member of the Boy Scouts as long as you are under the age of 18. This stance means that, if gay, you can achieve scouting’s highest honor, the rank of Eagle Scout, but you are banned from becoming an adult leader to pass on the valuable skills, insights, and knowledge you have acquired as a scout. This decision is an indication that the BSA is in the pocket of religious institutions, including those of the Mormons, Catholics, and Methodists, who sponsor almost half of members nationwide, according to the BSA. It seems as if the BSA would rather remain there than take a stand for a semblance of fairness.
Clearly, this is an unsatisfactory solution, particularly for proponents of integrating members of the LGBT community into the Boy Scouts. It bars gay adults from participation completely, which serves no conceivable purpose for the BSA and most likely still prevents them from regaining much of the corporate sponsorship they have recently lost, such as Intel. The only logic that I can fathom that would lead to this conclusion is the preposterous belief that gay adults are pedophiles — that or they fear the nightmare scenario of adults with diverse backgrounds indoctrinating children with the poisonous, insidious concepts of tolerance and acceptance that have done so much to undermine our society.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints has come out in favor of the proposed plan, saying that they support the decision to allow gay youth membership. The BSA is likely pleased that they can count on keeping one of their main sources of funding and members; they may think that this nonsensical discrimination is in keeping with the “morally straight” tenant of the Scout Law. They have somehow managed to conflate the word “straight” in the sense of sexuality with not being a dishonest person and, in doing so, managed to toss the original meaning completely out the window.
Once again it is clear that keeping Mormon approval is more important to the BSA than the well-being of youth or a sense of fairness and decency. But this move doesn’t make much sense in the context of Mormonism either, since Mormons allow members to be homosexual, so long as they don’t actually do anything homosexual. If an organization — one that has prominent adherents like sci-fi author Orson Scott Card actively fighting against gay marriage — can trust adults to deny themselves any sexual activity, why in the world can they not be trusted with leadership of youths?
Allowing gay youths to join scouting is a step in the right direction, and I am glad to know that the organization has some sense when it comes to considering the children. When I previously wrote about this issue last October, I mentioned what a positive experience scouting was for me and my psychological health. I argued that it is not only negligent but also malicious to bar children with a far greater risk of bullying and suicide. 
To be fair, I should be glad that the BSA has stopped being directly harmful to a large portion of America’s population and is now only cruelly discriminatory to people in a way that is to its own detriment. But I’m not; this feels like a peace treaty that shouldn’t be signed. I call upon all fellow scouts to continue decrying and protesting this unjust and illogical stance.

Anyone who has watched writer David Simon’s HBO television series The Wire is familiar with the term “Hamsterdam.” Hamsterdam refers to a section of Baltimore where the sale and consumption of drugs are legal on the show.
Hamsterdam came about because the drug trade on mainstream street corners became too disruptive to everyday citizens. People were murdered and taxpayers moved out of the city to the neighboring county to avoid violence and drug culture. As a result, a rogue cop created Hamsterdam, comprised of empty row houses where the drug trade is legal and regulated for violence.
Hamsterdam was incredibly successful. Street corners were peaceful. Crime decreased by 14 percent in the district. Groups that distributed clean needles and condoms set up in Hamsterdam and reached people in the shadowy underworld of the drug trade that were once unreachable. Narcotics Anonymous set up in Hamsterdam and saw an influx of members looking to stop drug use. Cops even started charging all mid-level dealers a tax in order to continue operating in Hamsterdam. They used this tax to buy a basketball hoop for the kids of Hamsterdam who were no longer needed to help dealers complete illegal deals.
Obviously this is a TV show, and it may not reflect what would happen if drugs were legalized, but it forces one to consider if drug prohibition does more harm than good.
One example that legalization advocates like to point out is that both President Obama and former President George W. Bush used illegal drugs. Obama wrote about using cocaine and smoking weed in his autobiography, and Bush was allegedly arrested for cocaine possession in 1972 but had his father pull strings to get the arrest expunged from records. Both men went on to become President. If either were caught and jailed, their lives would have radically changed. Additionally, Steve Jobs said that his experimentation with LSD was “one of the two or three most important things” he’d ever done, according to Time magazine.
I hate to think about what other potential-filled, otherwise law-abiding citizens drug prohibition has barred from contributing to society. Institutionalization should be reserved for those who will negatively affect society if left free. Drug users are not a threat to society. Overcrowded jails, clogged justice systems, and dead law enforcement officials are not appropriate sacrifices to prevent people from getting high.
Additionally, according to a study by California State University Bakersfield, the size of the undocumented, untaxed black market for drugs in the U.S. is $475 billion. That’s 3 percent of our country’s gross domestic product (GDP). Economists should be going crazy for legalization. A 3 percent GDP bump would bring in a lot of revenue, especially because drugs would be subject to additional excise taxes like alcohol and tobacco.
Currently, drug legalization in the U.S. is incredibly unbalanced. Alcohol and tobacco attain legal status while drugs that, according to The Economist, are less addictive and harmful — like ecstasy, marijuana, LSD, and shrooms — are illegal. If alcohol and tobacco are legal, there is no legitimate justification for these less harmful drugs to be illegal.
Finally, it’s quite possible that the positive effects of drug legalization outlined in The Wire, could happen. We could document and discourage drug use. Safe practices could be promoted and people could discover a way out of drug culture. Also, with drugs out in the open, the Food and Drug Administration could regulate drugs for safety and make sure people looking for heroin don’t get rat poison. There are a lot of really good potential effects to smart drug legalization.
Realistically, drugs won’t be legal anytime soon, and blanket legalization of all drugs everywhere would have very immediate, very harmful consequences. What the government can do in the meantime is to eliminate all federal laws restricting drug possession. Many states already have laws making these drugs illegal, so nothing would immediately change.
Over time, states and cities looking to experiment with new ways to deal with drugs could try different policies. If they worked, other states would follow suit. Washington and Colorado recently legalized marijuana, but those laws technically mean nothing because it’s still federally illegal to possess, use, or sell marijuana anywhere in the country. These contradictory laws should not prevent states from experimenting with legitimate ways to find peace in the war on drugs.

Hello Tartans,
One part of Carnegie Mellon’s Student Government has been a President’s cabinet. This cabinet works with the President and Vice President to help make different initiatives come to fruition during the school year. This year, our cabinet will be split into two different branches. The branches and the descriptions of their roles are listed below.
A Chief of Staff will also be selected to oversee and connect these two branches. Members of the cabinet should expect to spend 2–4 hours a week on cabinet-oriented work, of which one of these hours will be a weekly meeting.
We hope to have a cabinet full of Carnegie Mellon students who are passionate and excited about making a difference for students on our campus. Here’s a basic description of what we’re looking for:
Cabinet Task Force
The first of these branches is a Task Force that will act as the core group of cabinet representatives who work to make sure events run smoothly and board initiatives are achieved. The following are the positions that will be available:
Application Engineers will work to make sure that any technology that is presented by Student Government is working properly, while Public Relations will work to advertise all Student Government sponsored events.
Events and Logistics works with the rest of the task force to make plans for different events and programs, and Campus Coordinator will work as a connection between students and the administration to relay important campus trends. Meanwhile, Community Coordinator will work with students on campus and the greater Pittsburgh community to form meaningful connections. Constitutional Adviser will work to make sure that all Student Government practices are in line with the current constitution and will be prepared to work on any needed bylaw changes.
Cabinet Advisers
The second branch will be known as the Advisers who will serve as representatives for different large student groups on campus. These advisers will choose their own specific initiatives to work and focus on. These initiatives should relate to the passions of the representatives and the groups of students that they represent. The following adviser positions will be available: Greek advisers, first-year advisers, graduate student advisers, residential life advisers, and athletics advisers.
Have an idea for a position that we haven’t listed? Let us know! Fill out your application at tinyurl.com/cmucabinet.

Some of the friends you made this semester will stick with you for the rest of your life.
Now is the best time to start a big project since you are pumped and ready to take on the world.
Summer break is a well-deserved breather for you, so don't do anything stressful.
Don't get your hopes up, because chances are, it's not going to happen.
If you push too hard, those around you may not appreciate it.
You may feel like you are being wise, but carefully consider your actions.
Don't give in to temptation. Resist and you will reap bigger rewards later.
There will be a lot of struggles this week, but don't let them get the better of you.
Pay attention to important issues this week, but not any more than they deserve.
The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. You may want to hang out in large groups rather than with just one friend.
Nature calls, but not in that way. Try to de-stress before finals with a nice hike or a fishing trip.
Don't forget to look up from the paperwork once in a while.
