After winning the Intercollegiate Tennis Association National Team Indoor Championships, the Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team earned its number-three rank and went on to kick-start a hectic but certainly productive outdoor season with spring break training in Claremont, Calif. Training prepared the team for its five-game winning streak before it fell to nationally second-ranked Washington & Lee University 3–6 this past Saturday. The team rallied Sunday to overcome Johns Hopkins University 6-3.
The women’s tennis team improved its record to 15-1 after this weekend’s results.
Over spring break, the Tartans won over Chapman University 6-3, Pomona-Pitzer College 7-2, Redlands College 8-1, Bowdoin College 7-2, and the University of the South 7-2, maintaining their undefeated status. Each victory pulled the team higher up in national rankings, but unfortunately, when they arrived back on this coast to take on Washington & Lee, the team ran dry of good luck and could not pull through to overcome the Generals.
“Although we played a lot over break, we played top ranked teams and were able to get some great practice. It was super because we also got to relax a bit as well as play in amazing weather!” junior Danielle Rosenfeld said, “Everyone is playing really well and we’ve been working hard, so it’s nice to see the results our team has had this season.”
Carnegie Mellon handed over two of the three doubles matches, with losses from the duo of first-year Courtney Chin and sophomore Kelly Hart (9-7), and H&SS first-year Amanda Wu and first-year Jennifer Chui. The team of first-year Laura Chen and sophomore Ashley Herrick took the only doubles victory for the Tartans, dominating Katie Tabbs and Lauren Caire 8-2.
Washington & Lee overpowered the Tartans, earning four of the six points in singles with Chen (6-3, 6-4), Wu (3-6, 6-4, 6-4), Chui (6-4, 7-5), and junior Alisa Liebowitz (6-2, 6-1) falling to their opponents to leave Chin claiming a decisive 6-2, 6-3 win for third singles and first-year Cze-Ja Tam recorded a 7-5, 6-3 win for fifth singles.
Despite Saturday’s disappointment, the Tartans came back strong yesterday to take on hosting Johns Hopkins University to tally a 6-3 win. The team swept the doubles matches with the duo of Herrick and Chen commencing the shutouts at number-one doubles with a 8-5 victory. Inspired, Chin and Hart, along with Wu and Chui, went on to snatch their wins over the Hopkins sides in second and third doubles, respectively.
Carnegie Mellon split the singles competition with Chen taking first singles 6-1, 5-7, 7-6 (7-2), Chin taking 6-0, 6-4 in number-three singles, and Liebowitz taking 7-5, 3-6 in number-five singles, 12-10 over their opponents. Chen confirmed her athleticism as she prevailed and grabbed the third-set tiebreaker in number-one singles.
“We’ve had a great run so far this season, but our loss to second-ranked Washington and Lee was both good and bad- it is always disappointing to lose, but this match also shows that we weren’t that far off from victory,” noted sophomore Jennifer Chui “ we found where we fell short and we can capitalize on this during future practices.”
The team will host the University of Pittsburgh this Wednesday at 4:30 p.m. on the campus tennis courts.

Members of the Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s swimming teams competed in the NCAA Division III championships in Minneapolis, Minn. this weekend and showed well,  coming away with strong finishes and honors. The Tartans were represented by one swimmer from the women’s team, sophomore Molly Evans, and six swimmers from the men’s team: junior Gates Winkler, senior Tom McConnell, junior Jonas Altman-Kurosaki, sophomore Alex Hanson, senior Brad Henderson, and junior Andrew Seo.
Last Wednesday, Evans competed in the 500-yard freestyle and finished fifth in the finals heat with a time of 4:54.34. She shaved off three seconds from last year to break the school record that she set the year before. Evans’ speedy swim awarded her an All-American title. This marked the third time she has earned All-American recognition and the first time for the 500-yard freestyle event.
Winkler had a strong performance in his first NCAA championship appearance receiving All-American Honorable Mention. Winkler finished eighth in the consolation heat of the 500-yard freestyle with a time of 4:34.58.
Last Thursday, Hanson competed in the 400-yard individual medley and finished 23rd overall with a time of 4:04.33. The Tartans had three swimmers compete in the 200-yard freestyle on Thursday. McConnell finished 46th with a time of 1:43.34, Winkler finished 54th with a time of 1:44.21, and Altman-Kurosaki finished 56th with a time of 1:49.43. The men’s 400 medley relay team — composed of Hanson, Henderson, Seo, and McConnell — finished 19th with a time of 3:31.58.
Last Friday, Evans competed in her second event, the 100-yard backstroke. With an outstanding time of 57:48, she finished third in the consolation heat, earning her All-American Honorable Mention. Henderson and Seo both competed in the 100-yard breaststroke to finish 19th and 37th, respectively. Henderson touched the wall in a time of 57.03 while Seo recorded a 58.41 finish.
During Saturday, the last day of the championship competition, Evans received her second All-American Honorable Mention of the weekend with a first-place finish in the consolation heat of the 200-yard backstroke. Evans finished with a season best time of 2:02.76.
Hanson also hit the water on Saturday to compete in the men’s 200-yard backstroke with a time of 1:56.21 to take 36th place. Seo and Henderson finished 20th and 24th in the 200-yard breaststroke with times of 2:04.65 and 2:05.40, respectively. With three swimmers in the 1650-yard freestyle, the Tartans had a successful final day. McConnell earned All-American recognition with a fourth-place finish in a time of 15:29.76. Winkler and Altman-Kurosaki followed finishing 14th and 22nd. The 14th-place finish earned Winkler his second All-American Honorable Mention of the championships.
The NCAA championships marked the end of a successful season for the Tartan swimmers.

The past few weeks have been busy for the Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team, which spent spring break in southern California and won three out of five dual matches. The 13th-ranked Tartans last weekend also outplayed 19th-ranked Washington and Lee University 8–1 but dropped a 6-3 decision to 17th-ranked Johns Hopkins University the next day. These matches bring the Tartans to an overall record of 11-4.
Over spring break, the Tartans traveled to Chapman University in Orange, Calif. and left with a 7–2 victory. The team quickly snatched all three doubles matches to go up 3–0, followed by wins at second, third, fifth, and sixth singles for a decisive clinch. The next day at Claremont McKenna College, the Tartans went head to head against 20th-ranked University of Texas at Tyler and came out with a 6–3 victory, winning two doubles and four singles.
Despite the easy wins the previous two days, the Tartans faced tough competition against 13th-ranked Redlands University in Claremont and lost in a close battle, 5–4. After doubles play, the Tartans found themselves down 2-1, with the lone win coming from the doubles duo of junior Niko Ljuboja and sophomore Bobby MacTaggart. In singles play, MacTaggart, sophomore Alex Nemerov, and junior John Spero won their singles to bring the match score to 4–4. Junior James Muliawan was the last match on, but lost in a close 3–6, 7–6, 6–7 fight.
The next day, the Tartans were unable to redeem themselves against 11th-ranked Bowdoin College and dropped a 7–2 decision in sunny Palm Springs. After being unable to hold of the tough competition in doubles, the Tartans gave up an additional four singles, with the two wins coming from Spero and MacTaggart at third and fourth singles.
On the final day of spring break, the Tartans regained their momentum and easily defeated the University of the South 8–1. They kicked off the day by sweeping doubles and then winning five of six singles.
For the entire trip, Spero was the lone player who remained undefeated 5–0 in singles competition.
Last weekend, the Tartans traveled to Lexington, Va. to face 19th-ranked Washington and Lee University and won in a fast 8–1 victory. Immediately after the match, the Tartans once again hit the road to Baltimore to play 17th-ranked Johns Hopkins University. A slight hardship befell the team Saturday morning when one of their members became sick, so junior Ravi Raghavan flew in Saturday night to rescue the Tartans. Unfortunately, the Tartans fell in a 6–3 upset, with the only wins coming from Spero, senior Yiran Liu, and a doubles point from Muliawan and Ljuboja.
“This was an okay weekend for us, and even though we lost, everyone put in their best effort and tried their hardest. The loss against Hopkins showed us where some of our weaknesses are, so now we can work on them extra during practice,” Liu said.
“We take every match very seriously, so the loss to Hopkins is just a reminder that we need to keep focusing and working hard during every practice,” Muliawan added, “But overall, everyone played well, and this will help us better prepare for the UAAs next month.”
The Tartans gear up again this Thursday against Grove City College away for matches set to start at 4 p.m.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s golf team spent their spring break at Bonita Bay Country Club in Naples, Fla. playing golf and working on perfecting their techniques. 
Most recently, the Tartans spent this past weekend competing in the Jekyll Island Collegiate Invitational held on the par-72 Oleander Course in Jekyll Island, Ga. to finish 21st place out of 27 schools.
The golf team wrapped up the three-day Jekyll Island Invitational yesterday against 26 teams. The Tartans shot 324, 317, and 321 for a combined score of 962 overall as a team during the 54-hole invitational and tied for 22nd.
On the Friday, the Tartans shot a combined team score of 324. Junior Christopher Lee and first-year Michael Cheng led the Tartans, shooting eight over par at 80, followed by first-year Terence Einhorn, who carded 81. Seniors Joshua Chen and Alex Timmons shot 83 to complete the team score of 324.
The Tartans improved their overall scores on Saturday by shooting a 317 team total. Timmons and Cheng shot six over par at 78 and Chen, Einhorn and Lee followed with 79, 82, and 85 respectively. The team improved two spots in the standings to tie at 22nd.
The golf team concluded the invitational yesterday with a strong effort by Einhorn, who shot two over par at 74. Chen and Lee shot 82, Cheng shot 83, and Timmons scored 88 to wrap up the final day of the tournament, holding steady at 22nd overall. Einhorn placed 77th individually in a field of 135 competitors.
The golf team will tee off next this Saturday at the McDaniel Invitational at the Bridges in Gettysburg, Pa.

The men’s track team ended its season one point away from winning the University Athletic Association (UAA) conference meet. The Tartans posted a score of 105, finishing just behind Emory University. Senior Brian Harvey ran a career-best 4:11.63 in the mile, securing his place in the NCAA championships. Also earning an NCAA berth was junior James Hulley. Hulley broke the school record and won the UAA title in the shot put with a throw of 16.47 meters. Junior Chris Bridgman also earned a UAA title in the pole vault by clearing 4.53 meters, breaking both the school record and establishing a new career best.
At the NCAA track and field meet, Harvey crossed the finish line after running the mile with a time of 4:11.65, enough to place him at ninth in Division III. “The previous two years I finished in eighth and fourth so ninth place was a big disappointment for me especially since top eight are given All-American honors,” said Harvey. “However, this race will definitely motivate me even more for outdoor track, my last season as a collegiate athlete.”
Hulley placed fourth in his heat with a distance of 15.19 meters, but the shot put throw was not enough to advance him to the final round. “It was a disappointing end to my indoor season to place 11th when i was seeded 3rd going in, but it gives me something to shoot for during the outdoor season,” said Harvey. 
At the UAA conference meet, the Tartans performed well, with many track and field members placing. Senior Chris Fornataro came in second to Hulley in the shot put, hitting a mark of 13.82 meters, and first-year Anthony Hernandez finished sixth with a distance of 12.83 meters. Sophomore Pat O’Brien also placed sixth in the triple jump with a distance of 13.32 meters.
There were three fourth-place finishes for the Tartans in track events. Senior Ryan Anderson finished fourth in the mile run with a time of 4:15.91. Junior Dario Donatelli finished fourth in the 3000 meters with a time of 8:41.09, and senior Craig Hahn finished fourth in the 400 meters in a time of 51.26.
Finally, first-year Rob Morhard finished sixth in the 800 meters with a time of 2:03.99.
Sophomore Dan Melamed said that the meet was a “disappointing loss since we were only one point away from the first ever Carnegie Mellon men’s indoor championship. We’re looking forward to defending our title for outdoor at our home track in April.”

For the Carnegie Mellon’s men’s basketball team, this year’s season was a monumental one, finishing with a record of 20–7 to tie the most wins in a season for the program and mark the furthest advancement in to the NCAA tournament ever. Unfortunately, the Tartans lost to host John Carroll University in the second-round game in a fraction-of-a second heartbreaker that followed some questionable officiating.
The first round game against SUNY Brockport on March 6 proved to be a nail-biter. The Tartans came out on top after two overtimes, with fans hoping it was just an attempt to keep things interesting with the extra two periods. 
One of Carnegie Mellon’s fans who attended, Vinny Giacalone, a senior on the football team, summed up the game’s intensity: “If you offered me the chance to go watch Lebron James play at Madison Square Garden or to go back and watch CMU versus SUNY Brockport again, I would choose this game in a heartbeat. It was the best basketball game I have ever attended. Not only was it an awesome back-and-forth war of a game, but it was clear to every fan in the building that the men poured their heart and souls onto that floor trying to get a ‘W’.” 
Free throws were the name of the overtime game, with senior Terrance Bouldin-Johnson making one to tie regulation and send the action into its first overtime, and seniors Ryan Einwag and Corey O’Rourke sank theirs to ensure a win at the end of the second overtime. Five players recorded double-figure scores, with junior Jack Anderson leading at 15 points on the game.
After this extended contest on Friday, the team turned around to face 10th-ranked John Carroll on Saturday, March 7. Head coach Tony Wingen praised his team’s preparedness for this game and said, “I am very proud of our performance against John Carroll, given the fact that we had played in to double overtime only 18 hours beforehand. The guys did a great job preparing themselves physically and mentally on such a short turnaround, although I’m not surprised because they have done that all season long.” The expeditious action was full of lead changes and marked athleticism from both teams. After O’Rourke tied the score with 18.8 seconds left in the game, John Carroll’s Chris Zajac sank an impossible jump shot with the clock hanging on to .3 seconds. As John Carroll fans proceeded to falsely celebrate their victory, officials granted the Tartans their final possession. An out-of-bounds baseball pass from Anderson to Bouldin-Johnson, who was waiting two-thirds of the way down the court, proved to be unsuccessful as Bouldin-Johnson was smothered by several defenders when he caught the pass and the fraction of time ran off of the clock.
While it may be manifest to look back on certain games in hindsight, the team can take stride in its notable season as a whole. Playing into the postseason and extending their opportunities for victory was well-deserved by this group of student athletes. Six graduating seniors leave the team a little younger, but the program looks to have similar success with the foundations of determination and teamwork in the seasons to come.

The Carnegie Mellon Rowing Club traveled down to Camp Bob Cooper in South Carolina for spring break, a week full of intense training in preparation for the following weeks of competition.
The unprecedented number of rowers, 45, were eager to get off the bus and start the workouts, and from then on, did not get much of a break. With the sun shining and the temperature just right, the crew team hit the water in perfect conditions and underwent four workouts a day. The team was thrilled that they were no longer using ergs or mirrors anymore and were actually rowing their boats.
“The week we spent down in South Carolina is about the same as a month’s worth of practice back here, and we definitely capitalized on that,” said first-year novice Harold Kim.
On the final day of the trip, the Carnegie Mellon Lightweight Men’s 4+ team of senior Brian McGraw; sophomores Justin Perry, Sean Lubner, and Ed Burns; and coxswain senior Elliot Beltzer pulled through with a tremendous victory over Penn State.
With a successful trip behind them, the team is well on their way to a successful season as they compete this Saturday and Sunday in two separate races. 
They will jump-start the weekend in Philadelphia to compete in the Murphy Cup and conclude the weekend at the University Athletic Association championships at Lake Arthur in Moraine State Park, just 45 minutes from campus.
“I think as a team, the novices are going into the spring season on a very good start,” concluded Kim.

Recently honored as the University Athletic Association Women’s Tennis Athlete of the Week, first-year Courtney Chin has been an asset to the program’s impressive performance so far this season. Competing in both singles and doubles matches, Chin maintains winning records as the Tartans tennis team finishes out a handful of regular season matches before conference and national playoff competition begins at the end of April.
Chin is in the College of Humanities & Social Sciences working towards a major in economics, and is a fellow writer for The Tartan. Chin, like many other student athletes at Carnegie Mellon, saw the opportunity of attending this university as a way to focus on a prosperous academic career while also being able to continue a career in the sport that she loves. While free time may be devoted to studying and catching up on sleep with a more demanding course load, Chin is reaping the benefits of a successful tennis season while in her first year at Carnegie Mellon.
A self-declared fruit fanatic, Chin also enjoys pasta dinners before matches and tournaments to keep up the high energy level that tennis requires. Living the life of an athlete has been guided by wise advice and comfort from her family, especially her dad who she regards as her biggest influence and inspiration. This guidance has proven to be a helpful part of the equation given Chin’s ability to balance academics and athletics successfully. Even if sometimes she wishes she had the ability to freeze time, to prepare for matches, prepare for classes, or even just to tidy up her room, Chin is managing and enjoying the life of a student athlete.
Chin is a native of Cupertino, Calif., and hopes to return to her roots after earning her degree. While pursuing a career, Chin expects tennis to always have a prominent role in her life. Part of her positive experience playing tennis in college has come from her teammates. “Tennis is so much more fun when you get to cheer for your teammates while also having support from them during tough matches,” Chin said. “I have a lot of great memories so far from the team, and I’m looking forward to even more memorable ones to come.”
The women’s tennis team is currently ranked third in the nation after they won the Intercollegiate Tennis Association National Team Indoor Championship earlier this month. After defeating nine nationally ranked teams, Chin and the rest of the women’s tennis team are well-equipped to continue this auspicious trend. Up next is a home match against the University of Pittsburgh this Wednesday at 4 p.m. on the campus tennis courts.

The American Physical Society held its March meeting from the 16th to the 20th of this month at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center in downtown Pittsburgh. The meeting, attended by a wide breadth of divisions of the APS, including Biological Physics, Computational Physics, and Condensed Matter Physics, provided an opportunity for the conference-goers to present their research and to hear talks given by leaders in other branches of physics.
On Tuesday, Steven Plotkin of the University of British Columbia presented his work on predicting, via physical simulation, types of protein misfolding and the reasons why misfolding occurs. Proteins, after they are created, must undergo a process of folding upon themselves in order to be useful, “but up to 30 percent of newly translated proteins are degraded by the proteasome because they do not reach the proper configuration.” Proteasomes are large structures, made of several proteins, which break down other proteins. Plotkin reported that the simulation’s predictions have been confirmed in vivo and discussed the application to diseases resulting from misfolded proteins, such as mad cow disease. In such diseases, it is believed that a protein misfolds in a particular way, which causes other proteins to misfold. The result is a detrimental accumulation of misfolded proteins, which eventually causes damage to the cell. With better understanding of how misfolding occurs, drugs could be created to target the ways that proteins incorrectly fold. 
In another talk given in the same session, Jeffery Saven of the University of Pennsylvania spoke about his work in engineered protein structure and function. The characteristics of proteins are believed to be largely decided by the sequence of amino acids that form the protein, which are in turn coded for by sequences of DNA. He posed the question, “What ensemble of sequences are consistent with that structure [of a protein]?” and presented computational approaches to answer the question. The methods allowed his group to design proteins that aggregate gold, forming gold nanoparticles inside cells. Using these results as a proof of concept, Saven hopes that he will be able to design proteins for other functionalities.
On Wednesday, in a session called “Super-Computations: Space Clouds, Hurricanes, and Other Fluids,” the speakers talked about their use of computer simulations of fluids. George Karniadakis of Brown University presented his work on modeling the human circulatory system through a hybrid two-dimensional (for large, unobstructed flows in arteries) and three-dimensional (for smaller blood vessels and bifurcations) model. His group has had success in matching their model to per-patient observations of blood pressure. They intend to adapt their model to simulate blood flow within the brain. By modeling blood flow in the brain, Karniadakis hopes to be able to predict phenomena like aneurysms, which are sacs formed by blood pressure on weakening blood vessel walls, which can eventually burst and cause brain damage or death. On Friday, during a session titled “Glassy and Amorphous Systems,” Panchapakesan Ganesh of the Geophysical Laboratory at the Carnegie Institution of Washington and Michael Widom of Carnegie Mellon’s physics department presented their joint work on simulations predicting a liquid-liquid phase transition in supercooled silicon. At approximately 1200 Kelvin, 500 Kelvin lower than the freezing point of silicon, their model reveals a situation where two liquid phases of differing densities coexist, a state for which experimental evidence so far has been inconclusive. Their findings may lead to further investigations of supercooled liquid silicon. Furthermore, the analytical tools created by the group can be used to simulate the behavior of other atomic ensembles, facilitating the discovery of new materials.
The March meeting of the American Physical Society was one of the largest physics meetings of the year. Apart from giving scientists a forum for the current issues of their particular fields, it also allowed them to broaden their knowledge of other branches of physics.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that injection drug use has directly and indirectly accounted for one third of AIDS cases since the spread of HIV/AIDS was first declared to be a public health emergency.
There are an estimated 11,981 injection drug users in the Pittsburgh area, according to a report published in the Journal of Urban Health in 2004. All across the world, needle exchange programs have been established to help prevent the rapid spread of diseases like AIDS and hepatitis C. Almost 14 years ago, Caroline Acker, an associate professor in the history department at Carnegie Mellon, started such a program in Pittsburgh. It started out as a single table with a pickle jar for used needles on a street corner, and today has turned into Prevention Point Pittsburgh (PPP). The organization has expanded its services from just needle exchange to free, confidential HIV and hepatitis C testing and counseling, crisis intervention and counseling, and overdose prevention and response education
.
Acker, co-founder of the PPP, said in an interview that she was first exposed to the needle exchange program while living near San Francisco, where “it instantly made sense to [her] because it was so clear that giving injection drug users sterile syringes would prevent transmission of blood-borne diseases.” She stated that her inspiration to take part in the needle exchange program came from “[her] brother’s passing due to AIDS, a family history of addiction, and [her] background in drug education.” However, upon arriving in Pittsburgh, she faced some major obstacles in the project: getting the word out to drug users and getting legalization and funding for it. 
“Ironically, getting the trust of drug users was not the biggest problem .... In fact, the first [injection drug user] to participate in this program turned out to be an important partner in [PPP’s] work,” Acker said. However, she had a much harder time trying to gain legitimacy and support. The program was finally legalized in March 2002, and in April of that year, PPP established a county needle exchange site in Oakland. Since then, over 5000 injection drug users have enrolled in the program for critical prevention services.
Acker believes this program is extremely important because there have been studies all around the world proving the success of needle exchange in keeping the level of HIV-positive individuals down. 
Acker recounted that a study conducted in the 1980s in such cities as New York showed that two thirds of the 2 million injection drug users were HIV positive. However, when New York State began to fund the needle exchange program, the epidemic curve of the disease showed a reverse. 
She also cited another study conducted in 1995 in which cities were studied while HIV prevention work and especially needle exchange programs were present. If the city had an initial HIV infection rate of less than 5 percent, then with both programs occurring, the city showed little or no increase in infection rates even after eight years. Acker considers Pittsburgh to be one of those cities sustaining HIV positive rates under 5 percent.
Carnegie Mellon students have become involved in this program as well. Acker described a first impression to the needle exchange program as “students [asking] why [you would] give needles to people to inject illegal drugs.” However, after she explained the public health rationale, which she stated as “knowing of a dangerous disease ... and identifying the mode of transmission and interrupting that mode of transmission [unclean needles], you can control the disease,” several students from both Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh Medical School offered to volunteer in the program.One such volunteer is senior history and policy major Ellen Parkhurst. Parkhurst has been volunteering in the program since August 2007. She has progressed from just volunteering in the needle exchange program to doing a research project on how the supplies given to the drug users are utilized and the extent of the users’ knowledge about health safety. 
Parkhurst said, “[I] was able to find out what they are doing with [the supplies] when they leave the site, and that was fascinating to me because it’s always been that we give [drug users] needles, but now I know what they do with [the needles].” Parkhurst also spoke of Acker as “someone who inspires you to do something when you need to get it done and a kind of person who you really want to impress.”
Acker stated that right now “[they] are still a struggling program since there is no federal funding for purchasing the needles.” She also said, “We don’t have enough resources to meet the needs of Allegheny County. So our energies are focused on expanding the program in the city.” 
Still, she does wish that groups of people in cities that don’t have the needle exchange program will try to take the opportunity to start one for their cities. 
Acker’s dedication to public health as a layperson has earned her the 2008 Benjamin Rush Individual Public Health Award from the Allegheny County Medical Society.

March 7–9, the conference "Art and Code" took place, focusing on the common ground between art, design, and computer science pedagogy.
According to conference organizer and Associate Professor of Art Golan Levin, many people have creative ends in mind for the computers that surround them, but they hesitate because programming seems too hard. 
"The problem, it turns out, may not be programming itself so much as the ways in which it is conventionally taught," wrote Levin in the conference’s forward.
Multimedia-based programming environments under development — such as Processing, Alice, openFrameworks, or VVVV — use art and music as the hook for attracting creative individuals, with the goal to expose programming to more left-brained people.
The conference began with half-day workshops led by the creators or developers of these programming environments, including Casey Reas of Processing, Zachary Lieberman of openFrameworks, and Sebastian Oschatz of VVVV.
The workshops aimed to both give an idea of what is possible with each of the software packages, and also to teach people from all skill levels how to use the basic features. On Sunday, the leaders of the workshops took the stage and gave hour-long talks to demonstrate the successes and future potential of each package.
On Sunday evening, the conference attendees were encouraged to attend a meeting of the Pittsburgh Dorkbot chapter, which, as stated on its website — www.dorkbot.org/dorkbotpgh — is an organization celebrating "people doing strange things with electricity." Sunday's Dorkbot meeting at the brillobox in Bloomfield was a special event, where individuals gave five minute–long presentations on their ideas or projects in progress. The presentations ranged from demonstrations of general-purpose interactive systems to overviews of unique designs like that of the music-driven lighting system of ARS Electronica in Linz, Austria.
Monday's activities centered on giving short introductory lessons to students for each of the software packages, and culminated with panel discussions on ways to teach programming that encourage exploration. The idea is that by making program effects immediately accessible by visual or auditory means, the beginner can more easily make connections between what he types in and how the computer interprets his commands.
"Why the Lucky Stiff," or Why, for short, is the pseudonym of a computer programmer best known for his book Why's Guide to Ruby, which teaches the programming language Ruby through stories.
Why's The Little Coder's Predicament reprinted as the conference's afterword, begins with an anecdote: when he was young, it was simple for him to write programs on his TI calculator and share them with his friends. This was a formative experience that encouraged him to explore more in depth. However, according to Why, "current versions of Windows have no immediately accessible programming languages" — in general, it is not as easy today to get one’s feet wet and to get excited about programming.
Why then details some principles which he believes, if implemented, may make programming accessible again: transportable code, meaning code that can quickly and freely change hands. Simplicity means that it should be straightforward to do tasks such as load and display images, which typically take tens of lines of code. There should be a sensible environment: the environment should be tuned to the interface. For example, a programming environment on a console should be easy to use with the provided game controllers. Finally, any such environment should be free, to encourage people to actually use the thing.
"Art and Code" brought artists, designers, and computer scientists together, and in doing so developed their senses of what is possible with the computer as a medium. The workshops and panels, and the coffee breaks, led to conversations that in cross-pollinating developers, will lead to more usable and powerful tools for artist-programmers.

For Laura Rosser, numbers are always associated with colors. The number two is always orange and the number five always red. Rosser also associates colors with music. While playing the piano, she “sees” the note E flat as turquoise and the note F sharp as yellow-green. Many notes together create a medley of colors for her. Although Rosser’s story, reported by ABC News, may suggest that she simply has a very creative and poetic mind, these phenomena can be attributed to a condition called synesthesia. Simply put, Rosser’s brain has some internal cross-wiring that involuntarily activates one sensory pathway on the stimulation of another sensory pathway. Thus when she reads a number or hears some music, her sensory pathways for seeing color are immediately activated. 
“Color synesthesia,” as this is called, is not the only form of the condition. The ABC News article also narrates the case of James Wannerton who can “taste” words. For Wannerton, the word “change” tastes like cheese and the words “roasted nuts” taste, not like nuts, but like burned meat. Certain words can be especially distasteful for Wannerton. The name Derek, for example, tastes like earwax.
Like Rosser and Wannerton, most synesthetes have this condition since birth. Scientists have recently discovered that the condition could be hereditary and could have its roots in genetic mutations. According to the New Scientist, researchers at the Imperial College London and the University of Oxford have discovered that a region on chromosome 2 may be responsible for the condition. 
What is particularly interesting about this find is that the same chromosomal region has been associated with autism and epilepsy. This discovery has led scientists to believe that the three conditions may share some common underlying neurological mechanism. 
Other chromosome regions which have been linked to this disorder include regions on chromosomes 5, 6, and 12. These regions are responsible for directing the way the brain gets structured. 
Scientists have still not figured out which exact genes are responsible for the disorder but hope that the findings will shed some light on the functioning of the brain. Research in this field has also called to question the fact that the condition is completely hereditary and if certain environmental factors cause the condition.
ScienceDaily reports that color synesthesia is influenced to a certain degree by environmental factors. Studies conducted by scientists at the University of Edinburgh and University of Sussex revealed that color synesthesia has some certain common characteristics in many individuals. The letter A, for example, is always associated with the color red, while the letter V is associated with the color purple. 
Scientists believe that this color-letter association has to do with the way people learn languages. A is commonly used in English and is hence associated with a very common color term — red. V, a rather uncommon letter, is associated with the relatively uncommon term purple. This shows that external factors can influence synesthesia to a large degree. 
Even more surprising is the discovery that hypnosis is able to induce synesthesia in individuals normally not exhibiting the condition.
Medical News Today describes a study conducted by scientists at the University College London in which subjects who were hypnotized displayed color synesthesia. The scientists who conducted the study believe that hypnosis may cause certain suppressed connections in the brain to become activated, causing the various sensory pathways to become interlinked. 
These researchers believe that synesthesia is not caused due to abnormal connections in the brain, but due to increased activation of existing links in the brain.
Research has thus found some insights into the condition, but the actual mechanism of the condition still remains a mystery. 
As for those with this condition, their daily lives are not affected much by the condition. In fact, many have developed artistic abilities because of the condition. 
As Rosser put it, “I see it as a gift, as a sort of spiritual god thing that enables more intuition, whether it’s musical or even with people to be able to see some extra things out there.”

Watching a movie where a sword comes right out of the screen at you can be a thrilling experience. Filmmakers make this possible by using 3-D technology that makes the audience feel as if it is part of the action. As stated in an article on www.guardian.co.uk, the first 3-D film, The Power of Love, was released in 1922. Since then, the technology has been used by filmmakers far and wide.
In order to experience the 3-D effect, one has to wear specially designed 3-D glasses. The 3-D effect is possible due the phenomenon of binocular vision, because of which humans see the world in 3-D. Humans see their everyday world in three dimensions because of the interaction between the images received from both of their eyes. The effects of binocular vision can be explained by considering a simple fact — the accuracy at recognizing things changes if the world is viewed with one eye closed. 
As explained in the Encyclopedia of Virtual Environments, developed by members of the Human Interface Technology Lab (HITLab) in the University of Washington, binocular vision occurs because our eyes are spaced approximately 2 inches apart. With a gap of 2 inches between them, the two eyes view the world differently. The brain is able to correlate both the images and put them together to make the world appear three-dimensional. Since images of far-away objects tend to be unclear due to poor resolution and blurring, it is hard for the brain to recognize such an image. If only one image reaches the brain, this recognition process is even more difficult. Thus, with one eye, it is harder to realize the proportions of the image because the image from the other eye is missing.
After analyzing the mechanics of binocular vision, which allows humans to distinguish between the 2-D film screen and theater performances, scientists were able to come up with a method that allowed the movie-goer to see the action of a movie in 3-D. They made this possible by devising a technology in which a person in the audience simultaneously sees a different image with each eye. The two images are then put together by the brain. So even while sitting in the theater, one can feel as though he or she is sky-diving or stepping on the surface of the moon. As stated in the article “How are 3D films made” available on www.dvoted.net, a 3-D film is able to make us view two different images because it is shot separately using a special camera that records it onto two different filmstrips. These shots correlate in the same way as images received by each of our eyes would if the eyes were in the place of the camera. When the film is played, the shots are projected onto the screen on top of each other. The 3-D glasses allow us to distinguish between the images, because with the glasses on, our left eyes see the shot projected only through the left projector and the right eyes sees the shot projected by the right projector. Our brain mixes the images together and gives us the 3-D effect.
Traditionally, this was made possible by the use of different colors in the same shot. One image displayed on the screen was in red, the other on top of it was in either green or blue. The glasses were made in such a way that one lens could only filter the red light and the other could only filter the green/blue light. Two different images reached the eyes and the brain did the rest of the job. While colors were being used as part of the technique for separation, the drawback of this technique was that one could not really watch a colored 3-D movie. 
Polarized 3-D glasses use the technique of stereoscopy to give a 3-D illusion. These glasses are based on the principle of polarization of light. Polarized light oscillates in only one plane, and different polarization filters cause the light waves to oscillate in different planes. A film using stereoscopy consists of two images projected simultaneously on the same area of the screen through polarizing filters that are oriented at right angles to each other. Thus, each image consists of light that oscillates in a different plane. The polarized 3-D glasses have similar filters. Therefore, light through one filter passes through it only if the light itself is similarly polarized. Hence, the key to 3-D vision is achieved again — two different images reaching the two eyes simultaneously. Some wonder why a 3-D film viewed without glasses appears to be a strange sight that is very fuzzy and out of focus. 
The reason for this is the use of two different images, which are not registered by both the eyes as different if 3-D glasses are not used. 
The world of 3-D makes a person reach out to places like the solar system or underwater while sitting in a neighborhood movie theater. A simple scientific concept has thus been used to help audiences have completely new experiences.

Medical costs send Americans abroad
Due to rising health care costs and insufficient insurance plans, more and more Americans become “medical tourists” as they explore health care possibilities abroad. 
Moreover, the availability of high-quality medical facilities with U.S. accreditation, coupled with more reasonable rates, make health care abroad a more viable option for Americans. 
According to a report issued by the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, at least 85,000 Americans prefer being treated at foreign facilities for procedures ranging from minor dental implants to heart valve replacement and bypass surgeries. 
Medical tourism is expected to increase because of escalating health care costs and also because certain insurance companies are promoting the practice. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield of South Carolina is one such firm, which has opened a company called Companion Global Healthcare that specializes in helping potential customers who want to go abroad for medical procedures.

Removal of carb gene helps heart
Scientists propose that the suppression of a carb gene, known as DNA-PK, could help overcome the negative, weight-gaining effects of carb-rich foods like pasta, rice, and bread. 
Researcher Hei Suk Sool, from the University of California, Berkeley, said that this gene plays an important role in the liver’s processing of excess glucose into fatty acids. 
The study was performed on mice whose DNA-PK gene had been removed. After maintaining a high-carb diet, these mice were 40 percent leaner than ordinary mice and had improved blood-lipid profiles, lowering their risk of heart disease. The results of the study were published in the journal Cell.

Virus linked to global warming
A study shows that adverse effects of climate change have lead to a sharp increase in outbreaks of the West Nile virus, a mosquito-borne illness, across the United States.
As a result of higher temperatures, increasing humidity, and rainfall, this virus is quickly spreading to humans via mosquitoes that carry it. 
Warm weather increases the length of the mosquito season and also allows the mosquitoes to reach biting age faster. 
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the West Nile virus led to 43 deaths nationwide in 2008 out of the 1300 infections diagnosed last year.

Obesity reduces life span significantly
According to a recent investigation of 57 studies that included almost 900,000 people, obesity can reduce a person’s life span by two to four years. 
Extreme obesity can take eight to 10 years from a person’s life. Researchers have calculated that an increasing Body Mass Index (BMI) can not only have direct consequences on humans such as heart disease and diabetes, but can also increase the risk of cancer. 
Authors of the study advise people to prevent weight gain instead of taking drastic mesures to reduce weight later.

Robotic fish detect pollution in water 
British scientists have developed robotic carp-shaped fish that can detect pollutants in water. 
The robots exhibit movement similar to fish and are equipped with chemical sensors that allow them to detect pollutants from leaks in ships and underwater pipes. 
The robots then transmit signals back to land through a Wi-Fi system. In addition, the fish do not need a remote control for navigation and are able to move underwater independently. Each fish is about the size of a seal and costs $29,000.
The fish will first be tested in the sea near northern Spain. If the trials of the first five fish are successful, the team hopes to use the fish in rivers, lakes, and seas all over the world.

Astronomers detect  saltwater on Mars
Scientists from the University of Michigan have discovered droplets of salt water present on the leg of the Mars Phoenix Lander. 
The results were based on pictures of the Phoenix lander, in which droplets appeared to coalesce on the leg of the rover. 
Previously, scientists believed that water was present on Mars in the form of ice or vapor, but these findings suggest that liquid water is present on the planet.
The scientists believe that constant temperature changes in certain regions of Mars and the presence of salt in the water prevents it from freezing. This increases the chances of having life on Mars, as liquid water is an essential component for life to exist.

Study proves bird species endangered
A recent study called “The U.S. State of the Birds,” shows that one third of the 800 bird species in the U.S. are endangered. 
The study concludes that causes for the declining population of birds include such problems as pollution and habitat destruction.
The report claims that over the last 40 years, the population of grassland birds has reduced by 40 percent and that of arid land birds has reduced by 30 percent. 
The report showed that the situation is especially dire in Hawaii, which once contained more that one third of all the American bird species. 
Now, most of the Hawaiian bird species are endangered. Scientists believe that extensive climate change will make the situation worse, and that this problem needs to be worked on.

Scientists discover new bacteria
Scientists from the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) have discovered three new species of bacteria in the upper layers of the Earth’s stratosphere that are resistant to ultraviolet radiation.
The bacteria were discovered in samples collected by a balloon sent by ISRO in the stratosphere. 
The samples retrieved by the ISRO contained 12 bacterial colonies and six fungal colonies. 
Out of these colonies, three were of bacteria that had not been previously discovered. Scientists believe that this could be an indication of the  presence of extraterrestrial life.

The relaxation that spring break brought is officially over, and we are now in the stressful weeks piled with homework and exams before Carnival arrives with a big bang. But before there is an escape into the world of Booth and Buggy, we need to deal with the reality of the pile of work mounting high on our desks.   
If you’re looking for ways to alleviate, if not eliminate, this upcoming stress, here are some quick and easy ways to do so.
Take 10
Relaxation doesn’t mean staying in bed the whole day. That’s just plain lazy. Relaxation is about being calm and stress-free, and this zen state of mind doesn’t need to be restricted to moments of sipping a tropical drink on a sandy beach, but it can be brought into everyday life as well. 
Exercise can be pretty relaxing. This statement may sound contradictory, but scientifically speaking, exercise causes the human body to produce hormones called endorphins, which impart a happy feeling, automatically reducing your tension. Of course, even though the nearest gym may be just down a few flights of stairs, who finds the time to go work out for an hour when there’s so much homework to do?
Donna Morosky, the director of fitness and health in the athletics and physical education department, has some answers.
She suggested a simple way of bringing some calm into our everyday lives, and she called it “Take 10.” 
“Take time out for yourself each day, just 10 minutes,” she said. “Get up 10 minutes early, plan your day, take a few deep breaths, or do a bout of exercise. You’re going to be much more efficient, much more alert, and much more productive.”
Morosky’s words are pretty easy to follow, as she isn’t expecting a huge time commitment, nor is she asking you to take the extra effort to change into comfortable clothes and sports shoes to do a workout. All she’s asking for is 10 minutes of your time.
Get it together
Much of the stress that plagues our daily lives comes from being unplanned. A midterm you just found out about, a quiz you forgot to study for, a meeting you missed: All of these add unnecessary tension to the day that could have been avoided by just planning ahead. Try making life stress-free by using those extra 10 minutes to go over the tasks for that day. If the stress can be avoided, why endure it? 
Take a deep breath
Here at Carnegie Mellon, students are always working on assignments, or if it isn’t an assignment, they’re studying for an exam. Almost everyone has experienced the feeling of being under pressure to come up with a project, put together a presentation, or get a paper in by its deadline. And now that we’re sandwiched between spring break and Spring Carnival, this pressure is at its peak as professors rush to get all the midterms out of the way. It’s times like these that it becomes very easy to succumb to the stressful environment and, in short, lose your mind. 
When the stress of the situation starts mounting, it’s best to take one simple step: Just stop. “Walk away from your work,” Morosky recommended. “And take 10 minutes to take 10 deep breaths.”  
Put on some calming music, close your eyes, and concentrate on breathing. Another great way to find some balance is to spend 10 minutes with your legs up against the wall. Morosky explained that this position helps reduce the pressure on your heart as the flow of blood to your brain is aided by gravity, and the greater flow of blood to your brain revitalizes you. 
Taking meditation classes may also provide some great stress relief. OM, a spiritual organization for Hindus, Jains, and Sikhs, offers “Shanti,” weekly yoga and meditation classes. Contact ravimehta@cmu.edu for more details. 
Work it out
A great way to ensure a stress-free day is exercise. The athletics and physical education department offers a variety of one-hour classes covering topics ranging from Himalayan yoga and spinning to samba and hip-hop. These classes do not require prior registration and cards to attend them can be purchased at the University Center equipment desk. Try a single class of yoga, spinning, or Pilates with a $7 single class card. All the other classes can be attended once with a $4 card.
But for those who can’t afford to lose an hour, “Take 10” applies here as well. Morosky suggests simple things like just walking up and down the hall, or taking a walk in the evening around campus with a friend; things that will get your blood pumping and get you breaking a sweat. 
Chug the H20
“Keep yourself hydrated,” Morosky stressed. “Our brain is 90–95 percent water and we need water more than anything.” The coffee that most of us regularly drink is a diuretic, meaning that it dehydrates the body by extracting all the water and making us use the bathroom more frequently. To overcome this loss of water, it is essential that we replenish our water content by regularly drinking water. 
More often than not, the reason people’s brains seem slow and unable to function is because they are severely dehydrated.  
Dress your space 
The state of one’s mind has a lot to do with the environment it’s in. If the space is cluttered, thoughts are disorganized as well. For this reason, it is important to create an airy and calming atmosphere in the room that is conducive to work. This doesn’t mean hanging up wind chimes and playing classical music, although both of these can be quite effective, but it means creating your kind of calm. If you think blasting rock music is calming, then go for it. 
For those who aren’t quite sure what is calming for them, there are a number of things that are worth a shot. Try something as simple as letting the sunlight in, or keep your windows open to get some air circulating in your room. Natural light and air can do wonders for the state of mind. Also try getting a potted plant for your room. Plants emanate a peaceful vibe that can make the room a more relaxing place. They make the air in the room fresher and richer with oxygen. As a part of the 1000plus initiative, an Emerging Leaders team is giving out free plants on April 3 in the Merson Courtyard at 4 p.m. Test out the effectiveness of having plants in your room by getting a plant from them. 
No matter which method you try, stick with it. Results are not going to show up overnight. If you can embed these ways of relaxation into your lifestyle, you will soon see yourself becoming a calmer person.

The house lights went out and a sea of cell phone lights flickered in the audience as the presenters announced the first act. The excitement was palpable as the stage lit up and Greek Sing 2009 began.
One of the most anticipated events in the Greek calendar, and drawing as much enthusiasm and often as much hard work as booth and buggy, Greek Sing is the Greek Council’s annual charity event wherein each fraternity or sorority chapter is invited to perform its own short show. Often drawing inspiration from musicals, movies, and pop culture, Greek Sing participants have been known to pull out all the stops to produce shows that entertain and awe.
This year was no different.
The night started off with alumnus Tim Dimond strumming a few chords on his guitar and then going all-out into a Carnegie Mellon-style version of the Spice Girls’ ’90s hit “Wannabe.” Poking fun at rising tuition, TBA, nerdiness (a cosine function was mentioned in the lyrics), and other traditions, Dimond had the crowd roaring with laughter by the end of his performance.
The first act consisted of the singles performances, which were relatively low key. Delta Tau Delta kicked off the night with their rendition of “Delts in Tights” and pranced about the stage in their merry rendition of Robin Hood. As the performance called for a female role in Maid Marian, one of the brothers sang in falsetto and traipsed about in a white dress, much to the delight and amusement of the audience.
Beta Theta Pi once again performed an original piece. Their show featured the perils of trying to write a script during the school year, and then during spring break, and then at the last minute, after the extension given to them had passed. Somehow managing to feature The Twilight Zone, a little bit of flashing, as well as an elderly horticulturalist in their performance, Beta’s show was very original. Next was The Jungle Book, presented by Theta Xi. A comedic rendition of the childhood classic, Theta Xi’s version included red lights drenching the stage whenever the main villain — Shere Khan the tiger — graced the stage, tap-dancing, and a musical centered on the “Bare Necessities.” Not taking itself too seriously, though, their performance also included a “They’re grrrreat!” shout from Shere Khan and then some cannibalism, first from the vultures and then from everyone, as a celebration at the end of the show.
Pi Delta Psi presented their version of Mulan, with the brothers singing many of the female roles. Their performance followed the Disney version of the tale for a while, and then broke out into a rap-battle against the Huns. Following them was a step performance by alpha Kappa Delta Phi, which involved coordination of rhythm and beat as the sisters performed various configurations of step dancing.
The second act of the show brought much more tension, as the highly competitive doubles performances began. Starting with Chicago. by Kappa Alpha Theta and Kappa Delta Rho, the bar was set high as the sisters, complete with gold top hats, danced on a two-tier stage with remarkably versatile sets that changed from a prison to a sparkly court room scene. Next up was Seussical: The Musical from Delta Delta Delta and Alpha Epsilon Pi, which consisted of an intriguing storyline, although it was not always clear who or what each character was. Featuring creative and flashy costumes, as well as whimsical hairpieces and good singing, their show kept viewers entertained.
Delta Gamma and Sigma Phi Epsilon came together for the first time to produce The Lion King. Using sets that functioned almost like Venetian blinds, the pair was able to quickly change scenes from day to night and do it beautifully. Perhaps one of the most lauded moments in their piece was during “Hakuna Matata,” when the sister playing young Simba transformed into adult Simba, played by a brother, by jumping behind from one of the tiered platforms and having the new actor come out from behind them. Their performance involved creativity and a sense of fun. What followed was the first doubles collaboration ever between two fraternities: Pi Kappa Alpha and Sigma Alpha Epsilon. Their show took its main plot from the movie 300, including an epic battle between the leader of the Spartans — Condomitus — and the Persian ruler —Herpses — who was also a cat, as were all the Persians. At the end of the performance, which featured several scantily clad men, the audience found that it was really all an employee’s idea for a new commercial for a fast food place.
A Nightmare Before Christmas by Alpha Chi Omega and Kappa Sigma was next. With actors who really got into their roles like Jack and Sally, and sets that changed easily from Halloween to Christmas Town, the two groups had a lot of talent and always kept something happening. The vanquishing of the Boogie Man was especially funny, as the villain collapsed with a high-pitched “Nooo!” when Jack came in to rescue Santa. The last performance was Kappa Kappa Gamma and Phi Kappa Theta putting on West Side Story. Using two-story sets to represent houses, the groups showed the fight between the Sharks and the Jets fluidly without breaks in the action. Although the ending of their act happened very quickly, which might have made it a little difficult for new viewers to understand, it was a poignant show and was carried off very well.
Theta Xi’s The Jungle Book won first place in the singles category while Kappa Alpha Theta and Kappa Delta Rho’s Chicago bagged first place in the doubles category. While Greek Sing 2009 did encounter a few problems with its microphones and had to pause once or twice to fix a few technical difficulties, it was nonetheless an enjoyable performance benefiting a great cause, namely the Lustgarten Foundation and pancreatic research. The show was able to raise $36,050 for this cause.

Studying abroad with your own university doesn’t really sound like going abroad at all, but it is when Carnegie Mellon has a new home in Doha, Qatar, continents away from our main campus in Pittsburgh.
Carnegie Mellon is known for being a global university, making its mark in different parts of the world. Now it has done so once again by opening a branch in the Middle East, bringing Carnegie Mellon to a nation that is collectivist, diverse, and in the middle of revolutionary change. I feel as though I could not have asked for a better place to study abroad: the campus at Doha is so unique, but still so integrated with the main campus in Pittsburgh.
Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar, or CMU-Q, along with five other universities, is part of Education City (pictured above) and is comparable to the university in the U.S. CMU-Q offers degrees in business administration, computer science, and information systems. 
The size of the student body is only about 3.5 percent of the undergraduate population in Pittsburgh, and this small size gives you the feeling of belonging to a really huge family that is extremely close and where everyone knows each other, unlike Pittsburgh, where I still meet new people every day. Though the community on this campus may seem different, here, too, we are a set of motivated people out to make a difference in the world.
Qatar is a collectivist society and is ruled predominantly under Shariah or Islamic law. Due to Friday’s being a holy day, the working days are Sunday through Thursday.
Many people from Middle Eastern countries also reside here, creating Qatar’s huge expatriate community. This makes studying here really interesting since you meet people from all over the Middle East and can try to learn Arabic in all the different dialects. While living here you are not only able to learn about Muslim culture in general, but you also start picking up the subtle differences among the cultures of different communities.
Qatar is currently in a revolutionary period in its history, in which the government is taking steps to improve the education system, advanced research and development, and build a sustainable nation relying on the strength of its own people. Education is spreading and is taking higher priority, especially among women. Sheikha Moza, the consort of the Emir of Qatar, started Education City and brought the best universities from around the world to set up their campuses here. CMU-Q itself has a higher percentage of women attending the university than men. When coming from a society where seeing women in leadership roles is not so unusual, it is interesting to view women achieving higher positions in a society where they do not have equal standing.
Carnegie Mellon has integrated itself so well into this society that it is interesting to witness the blend between traditionalism and modernity. CMU-Q, while respecting the culture and the tradition of the people here, is at the same time opening the minds of the citizens, making them better educated to lead their country.
Even though all the Qataris are deeply rooted in their culture, you will find that they have welcomed foreign brands into the country. Although many dress traditionally, with women wearing the abaya and covering their heads with the hijab, and men wearing the thobe, the Qataris really value brands — much like New Yorkers — and cover themselves from head to toe in accessories from Chanel, Gucci, and Louis Vuitton. This love is demonstrated by the many malls in Doha; one of them, named Villagio, even has a canal inside and gives you the feel of being in Venice. The locals love to drive expensive cars from the makes of Bentley, Lamborghini, and Rolls Royce. Driving here is a nerve-racking experience, as the Qataris are crazy drivers: They drive at very high speeds in their Land Cruisers and flash their lights at people who are driving too slowly in front them.
Despite being a small county, Qatar has many tourist attractions. The Museum of Islamic Art recently opened, showcasing Muslim art going back as far as 1300 years. Souqs — Arab marketplaces — are really popular, especially Souq Waqif, where people go to eat ethnic food and smoke sheeshah — known as hookah in the West — while playing cards. Cuisines from all over the Middle East are offered here.
If you thought the camel was only used as a form of transport, then you were wrong. People here drink camel’s milk and eat camel meat. One of the local fast foods is shawirmas, which is basically meat rolled inside pita bread. A popular drink is karak, which is spiced tea like the chai in America. Alcohol is illegal in the country, as it is prohibited under Islamic law. Arabian coffee is extremely popular, and is flavored with local spices and much stronger than regular coffee. For this reason, you don’t see people drink 12 ounces of coffee in the morning.
People take advantage of the desert for adventure sports. They drive their Land Cruisers and All-Terrain Vehicles (ATVs) on the dunes. This is an extremely dangerous sport, as the dunes are steep and constantly shifting. Another popular sport is hunting with falcons, and people train extremely expensive falcons for this task. Qatar hosts a lot of popular sport events throughout the year. It hosted the Asian games in 2006; the golf season was kicked off in Doha in January this year; and international tennis tournaments take place annually. The citizens are fond of motorbike racing as well as horse racing.
Even though the Qatari campus may sound vastly different from Carnegie Mellon’s main campus, it is still Carnegie Mellon. The students here still value our Scottish heritage and still have their “hearts in the work.”

Iran is back after the better part of a decade with their first album since Moon Boys in 2002. Oh, and before you say it — no, Iran is not a country. This “Iran” refers to a band that was conceived by frontman Aaron Aites in San Francisco in 1998. Spewing lo-fi rock, the band is typically known as a throwback to early-’90s indie music. Not many have heard of Iran, but their two albums were highly lauded within the underground universe of indie music. As such, their newest release, Dissolver, is an interesting addition to their repertoire. Those looking for another old-school indie release will be surprised by their new album.
Dissolver is a dramatic shift from their previous two albums. Kyp Malone and David Sitek join the new lineup and both are members of electronic-indie powerhouse TV on the Radio. Malone, as guitarist, and Sitek, as the co-producer, are heavy influences on Iran’s new sound. When contrasting the two bands and their discography, it is nearly impossible to not notice the influence that they have on Dissolver. Iran seems to throw away the typical lo-fi presence that was so prevalent in early indie bands, such as Pavement, by attempting to create an album that dabbles in pop sensibility, brooding ballads, atmospheric textures, and fuzzed-out guitar licks. Aites’ lyrics no longer hide behind the music and are at the forefront. Sharp guitar parts are placed throughout the entire album, and digital effects find their place in nearly every song.
The sprawling songs, both “Where I’m Going” and “Airport ’79,” are the most appealing tracks on the album. “Where I’m Going” builds up through Aites’ lyrics to an instrumental train wreck of notes that crash violently around the listener without making the listener lose interest. Its long, brooding guitar jabs, dabbling piano, fuzzed-out background noise, and various other electronic tinkering results in a pallet of sounds that build up to an epic climax, giving the listener goosebumps. With “Airport ’79,” Iran creates an atmosphere with its music that recalls the typical existential bout found in the modern age. Aites sings: “It’s hard to tell if I’m still high anymore/I look at everyone/And they look like anyone.” The serene song encapsulates this typical modern theme with an atmosphere that is both interesting and sonically complex.
Two other appealing tracks are “Buddy” and its reprise in the latter half of the album. The combination of songs displays the more humorous side of the band, despite the seemingly severe tone of Aites. Closer inspection of the lyrics of “Buddy” reveal it to be an extremely silly song. It is about a man who lies to his buddy, saying he is dying, apologizes for lying, and then lies to him again about the same subject. In the reprise, the silliness is complete with the drunken spewing of “buddy, buddy” over and over with loud stadium noise in the background. Through the inclusion of a reprise that is so ridiculous, Iran is attempting to poke fun at the current state of the music industry, which is populated with bands that make somber atmospheric songs without any lyrical depth to justify its stern tone. Everyone is a target, even themselves.
The most notable aspect of Dissolver is its ability to create interesting sonic atmospheres that have multiple layers of interesting sounds and textures. Through the electronic tinkering of Sitek, the inclusion of Malone, and Aites’ embrace of pop sensibility, Iran has created an album that doesn’t attempt to push forward any bounds of music, but gladly accepts its place in the good pile of obscure music. While most will cling to the pop songs on the album, those who continue with the album will be rewarded with atmospheric gems that contain complex layers of textures and sounds.

At last, we can peel off our down jackets and set aside our sweatpants for lounging — with six weeks of school left, there is plenty of time to celebrate the official coming of spring. And, just like many students have been doing since last week, there is no better way to do so than to slide on a breezy, lightweight outfit and lie outside on the grass. 
A variety of spring styles have already made their debut on campus, from floral dresses to high-waist shorts to an array of strappy and embellished sandals. The temperature has nowhere to go but up, yet in this transition phase with the occasional chilly wind, it’s important to suit up with appropriate pieces.
Jung Eun Kwak, a sophomore mathematical sciences major, and Shu Ming Lim, a sophomore in H&SS, show off their terrific senses of style without succumbing to the sweeping wind. Both use one main piece as a statement and keep the rest of their outfits simple. 
Kwak wears an exaggerated cowl-neck sweater with ruffled short sleeves, and because there is so much emphasis on top, it shows off her face and neck. Overall, her outfit is slimming, chic, and surprisingly easy to recreate.
Lim fearlessly tries on one of spring’s most talked-about items — the harem pant. With a drop waist and a low inseam, the silhouette is incredibly hard to pull off, but Lim has it down pat. In accordance with Kwak, she keeps the main focus of her look on one piece, and wears a splash of color on top. Her strappy flat sandals contrast with the pants, making her style one-of-a-kind in creativity.
If you aren’t sure where to look for statement pieces like Kwak’s sweater or Lim’s pants, there are a variety of stores in Pittsburgh that offer both and everything in between. Feminine style with edgy twists can be found at Chick Downtown, a local boutique that offers See by Chloe, Jill Stuart, Anna Sui, and many more. If you’re looking for a bold floral top or dress, Chick has a wide selection, and interlaced among the racks are LNA leggings with ankle zippers and destroyed boyfriend jeans.
The Dress Circle, located in Shadyside right off Walnut Street, is another boutique that features pricier but beautiful designs from the likes of Michael Kors, Derek Lam, Chris Benz, 3.1 Phillip Lim, and many lesser-known independent designers. Many of the pieces boast stunning shapes and have just the right amount of flow, drape, or fit. At this store, it’s worthwhile to take time combing through the racks because there is almost always at least one piece that will catch your eye.
Finally, for those of us looking to catch the spring fashion bug without spending a fortune, there is Southside’s Urban Outfitters. In fact, they offer a less dramatic version of Lim’s harem pants at a relatively low price. With a fresh new spring line, Urban Outfitters also offers a great assortment of sandals, pocket tanks, and colorful dresses.
It’s great to finally be able to step out and feel spring in the air. An important part of spring is the opportunities it provides — and there’s no better way to take advantage of all the possibilities than to experiment with daring looks and dramatic pieces.

Leadbelly is an amalgamation of different approaches to explain an overlooked and complicated man. With so many juxtapositions throughout the work — between black and white, man and woman, powerful and powerless — the author, Tyehimba Jess, explores these dynamics using multiple forms like biography, persona, lyric, and hard-driving prose poems to highlight Huddie “Leadbelly” Ledbetter, a legendary blues musician.
The author’s style and gift for creating metaphors and visuals that place the reader into the context he is describing make reading Leadbelly particularly enjoyable.
The first poem, “leadbelly’s lessons,” acts as a title poem and an introduction to the book as well as to Jess’s style of writing. The book is very poignant, a touching tribute to a man the author probably never met but felt inspired to write about. The work details Ledbetter’s life, including significant events and people from his childhood to old age.
The first section –– “what kind of soul has man?” –– consists of six poems that represent the earlier part of Ledbetter’s life. The first is a list poem of 11 questions the author must have imagined Ledbetter’s mother Sallie asking. It is truly a mother’s hymn, ending with the nursing of her son, and wondering about which of her breasts nursed into him such talent and such torture. The next one describes Ledbetter’s father and his work, his son’s conception, and the potential he sees in this tiny little boy. The next three poems personify the pistol Ledbetter’s father gave him, the street he lived on as a child, and his guitar, Stella, speaking from the perspective of each, respectively, and how they directly affect and influence Ledbetter as a young man. My favorite poem of the book, “1912: blind lemon Jefferson explaining to leadbelly,” is similar to the first poem; however, it tells a story of desperation from an older person’s perspective.
Sections that take a different tone and structure are “man plowing with mules” and “you don’t know my mind....” The former introduces John Lomax, who recorded songs with Ledbetter and went on tour with him throughout Texas. “Prisoner #489235, parchman farm, Mississippi September 3, 1934” is a not even a poem, but a reproduced letter in the perspective of Jack, an inmate who describes seeing and hearing Leadbelly perform. 
I appreciate that Tyehimba chooses to include poignant details like this; they provide the audience with perspective: an interior and exterior view of Leadbelly and whom his life affects. The poem “leadbelly: mythology” makes interesting use of strikethroughs that prompt the reader to read the text in two ways. This format is especially good because it forces the audience to re-evaluate the written words and their meanings.
He uses this technique in the latter section, “you don’t know my mind...,” where a split space down the middle of six of the eight poems gives each poem three different reads. Manipulating space allows Jess to create new meanings and interpretations of his poems; his words almost speak to the readers and reflect his spoken words. They almost demand performance, with such an oral quality that longs for them to be performed on stage. The themes of society, bigotry, family, childhood, and hard work are woven through this chronicle of Leadbelly’s life, from his Southern roots through a rich history of music and dialect, to the end, which closes with a devotion from his wife, Martha, after his death.
The last section –– “good morning baby, how do you do?” –– is the section that is the most obviously interconnected: Each poem follows using a line or phrase from the previous one. The repetition of the line “I’ll unload the trunk, air out the best suit” begins the first poem, “leadbelly & martha: return to New York, 1936,” and ends the last poem, “martha: vigil.” This technique provides cohesion and flow, almost suggesting to the reader that these poems are all one idea. They might also suggest that all the people in Leadbelly’s life are on one page, each with a common understanding of their current reality in relation to this man. The last section is also the last to pose a question. I can appreciate the inclusion of the timeline in the back matter of the book, which clarified some questions I had about this musician’s life. As a legend, he tried to “stake his claim on the breath of each Black/willing to open his mouth and spit out/southern legend’s soiled root.”

It’s hard to come by funny and realistic love stories these days, as most movies offer the same sappy storylines and predictable dialogues. But Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist, based on the book by the same name, is a break from this low standard. 
With refreshing dialogue, nuanced characters, and a detailed plot, the movie is simultaneously comedic and sweet, keeping the audience hooked from start to finish.
Nick O’Leary (Michael Cera) is an awkward teenager, a music lover (his favorite band is the elusive Where’s Fluffy? — a band that plays at secret locations that can be found by following a trail of clues), and the bass guitarist for a queercore band “The Jerk-Offs,” and he is recently heart-broken because of his unexpected break-up with the super-hot and super-bitchy Tris (Alexis Dziena).
The first scene of the film opens with Nick recording his 12th mix tape for Tris, an attempt at winning her back. But unknown to him, Tris isn’t listening to any of his tapes and is instead throwing all of them away.
Norah Silverberg (Kat Dennings) is the daughter of a famous music producer and a music lover (her favorite band is also Where’s Fluffy?), and she is secretly in love with Nick, although she has never met him. Norah has become acquainted with Nick by listening to Tris’ discarded tapes and she loves Nick’s taste in music. 
As is common to all plots, a big event takes place that throws everyone together, and the event for this movie is the appearance of Where’s Fluffy? The only question is: Where are they playing?
Norah and her friend Caroline (Ari Graynor) go watch Nick’s band perform, and Nick and Norah finally meet, although under hilarious circumstances. 
Tris is also present at the performance as, being the vindictive person that she is, she wants to flaunt her new boyfriend in Nick’s face. 
Because of Tris’ presence, Nick doesn’t pay much attention to Norah, but Nick’s gay friends Dev (Rafi Gavron) and Thom (Aaron Yoo) are ecstatic at Norah’s interest in him and decide to get the two together as they are sick of Nick’s moping. 
In an attempt to give the two a chance to spend time alone, Dev and Thom offer to take the very drunk Caroline home, but later, they lose her as she wanders away.
After this, the movie follows Nick and Norah as they search, either for Caroline or for Where’s Fluffy? 
Tris isn’t out of the picture yet. Jealous of Norah, she follows them and continuously sabotages their time together by reminding Nick of his heartbreak and puncturing Norah’s self-esteem.
During their search, Nick and Norah both discover more about each other, and about themselves. Nick comes to a decision about Tris and Nora opens up about her father.
Apart from the seriousness, much hilarity is provided by Caroline’s drunken antics, as she wanders her way from the dirty bathroom of a bus station to a gay Christmas cabaret, and by Nick’s friends’ jokes, as they travel around New York City in the early hours of the morning.
Nick and Norah is well made, as it weaves together different subplots seamlessly, never letting the story lose its pace. The actors do a good job with their roles, especially Cera, who portrays an awkward and pitiable Nick with ease.

I work in an old building downtown that has been slated for demolition at least once. The floors are all pitched at irregular angles, as if the place were once part of a motorized carnival ride that has now ground to a halt. I am very fond of it.
My favorite part of this building is the freight elevator. You have to pull on straps stapled into a pair of latticework gates to close the car. The gates appear to be homemade. Most people, after tiptoeing onto the worn boards, feel compelled to devise an escape plan. When the car starts, one expects to hear a dirge of rot and corrosion, a sound like the singer Tom Waits clearing his throat. That’s why it’s so disconcerting when the box begins to sink through the guts of this old building and is utterly silent.
When I was in elementary school, there was a substitute teacher who was legendary for her ability to intimidate. She never resorted to corporal punishment. She never had to. Her malice, flickering somewhere in the back of her eyes, purring beneath her level commands, was enough to terrorize any child of eight. The prospect of violence emanated from her like dog breath.
There was a week in late April when our regular teacher, a dowdy woman named Mrs. Michalow, whom I had once seen in the checkout line at Food Lion with a case of Diet Pepsi under her arm, had jury duty. She was going to be absent for a week. By Wednesday, the substitute had eroded the will of the entire class, rather like a steam shovel clawing out sections of a wall. On Tuesday, she had made an overweight child cry when she said, “some of us are ugly” and put her fingers on that child’s desk. On Monday, another child wept when the substitute took a library book from her and pretended to tear a page from it.
When we arrived in class on Friday, the substitute, whose name I have since forgotten, was not there. The rumor spread quickly, and it turned out to be true: She had died that morning.
Sound, when you break it down to its most basic parts, is a string of particles chafing. Like beads rubbing against one another in an angry woman’s necklace. There’s something beautiful and frightening in the unexpected absence of that friction.

Dear Joe,
I have feelings for someone I work with. I want to tell him, but I don’t want to ruin the good relationship we have as co-workers. I can’t tell if he feels the same way because he is not usually very forthcoming with his thoughts and feelings. How do I let him know I like him without setting myself up to be embarrassed every time I see him when he tells me he’s not interested?
—Tentative in Tepper
Dear Tentative,
Try to remember the days of middle school, when we were all forced through peer pressure to confront whomever we had a crush on. Often times, we were rejected, or sometimes even called “gross” or “lame.” And when the rejection was over, we had to walk in the same hallways, take the same classes, and go to the same parties with the people who rejected us. 
But we dealt with it, Tentative. That’s the risk we’re willing to bear when we take such chances. The same goes for you today. Sure, you’re bigger, but your question is tantamount to the sixth-grader asking if he should ask his dream girl to the dance. Luckily for you, extensive media has been published on this subject. Just take any movie ever targeted for a high school audience and you will see that the consensus of these films is to take the risk. Now the only problem you have to face is how to do it. 
Listen, Tentative. This guy is your coworker. If you’re going to break the news, don’t let it happen in the office. Ask him to coffee. Even do it during a lunch break. Just ask him if he’s interested in meeting up again at a more personal time. If he says yes, then party right. If it’s a no, then just move forward. However, feel free to steal his stapler for mild retribution. The jerk was asking for it.
Godspeed, 
—Joe
Dear Joe,
As a freshman living in the dorms, I’ve had to adjust to having a roommate for the first time. Most of the time it hasn’t been bad, but last week he happened to open the door while I was looking at a scandalous picture of my girlfriend on my computer. I was able to close it before he saw anything too juicy, but he saw enough to know that I do, in fact, have lewd photographs of my girlfriend. My roommate is a lonely CS major who can definitely hack through any sort of security system I put on my computer, but I also don’t want to delete the pictures, of course. What should I do?
—Double-clicking in Donner
Dear Double-clicking,
The idea of looking at naked pictures of your girlfriend already raises questions. Is this on the Internet? Did you take the pictures? If so, wouldn’t it be awkward for her posing for such a picture? It just seems a little odd, that’s all. Maybe you’ve successfully identified me as a traditionalist. If so, you could probably guess what I’m going to tell you. 
Naked pictures have a rich history that existed well before the Internet. In fact, you can find naked pictures created before the printing press, or even hieroglyphics. With that said, why do you embark on such advanced methods just to catch a few quick peeks of your lady friend? My advice, Clicker, is to print out the pictures and delete those files. Laminate if you want longevity, and find a shoebox to store them in so your Keeper of the Linux friend doesn’t get to them. 
Signing off,
—Joe

Plebes (Tech first-years), as always, are insulted in a Carnegie Tech-esque joke. Here, the student is told that when mercury leaves a thermometer, all that remains is a vacuum. The dumb plebe’s response: “What does a vacuum look like?” It’s okay, plebe. No one in Carnegie Tech at that time knew what a Roomba looked like.

Tech rejoices as it receives a whopping $113,700 in research grants. These grants support studies in positronium and equilibrium measurements in reactive metal systems at high temperatures. Thankfully, with the grant money, the high temperatures could now be achieved through a special radiating device, rather than the previous method, which involved sticks, matches, and furious hand rubbing.

The Natrat, the annual prank issue of The Tartan, makes a joke out of pretty much everything. Even the movie section features ridiculous titles. For instance, Infinity will be playing, whose plot is you, watching the movie Infinity. Also included in the events page is a barn raising, a hacking competition, and “Shamlet,” or Hamlet performed replacing “h” with “sh.”

Pizza Outlet’s name isn’t just a joke. Boasting a special of 10 large pizzas for under $50, Pizza Outlet has got pizzas in bulk and is selling them dirt cheap. Such news reminds us of better times, when utilitarian-named food businesses kept to their word. Now, the Spaghetti Warehouse barely stores any of its products for extended periods and The Cheesecake Factory still does not have an assembly line.

Noted for his work in The Cosby Show and speech at the 2007 commencement ceremonies, Bill Cosby delivers to the campus a Scottie dog named “Maggie,” which will be taken care of by a professor. The dog will now be a real-life mascot for the school. While many were excited about the new dog, others were disappointed. The delivery of Maggie ended all debate about having any alternate school mascots, such as The Highlander, The Blogger, or even Bill Cosby himself.

Ever since it made its debut in feminist scholarship, the term “Islamic feminism” has been the topic of intense debate and scrutiny. 
While secular feminists view it as a divisive strategy to form a counter-camp to Western secular feminism, advocates of Islamic feminism disagree.
“The West has no understanding of women’s mobility in the East,” said David Kaufer, head of the English department at Carnegie Mellon. 
“Many people in the West see ‘Islamic feminism’ as an oxymoron,” he added.
Western feminism occupies a memorable space in American history because it emerged when women in the West demanded rights to assemble and vote, whereas Islamic feminism is seen to be an “import from the West” because people are not aware of a similar tradition in Islamic history, said Kaufer.
Assistant teaching professor of English at Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar, Amal al-Malki, stated in an e-mail that “Islamic Feminism, as a paradigm and a movement, transcends geographical boundaries and talks to Muslim women not just in the Muslim world but [also] to those living in the West.”
Islamic feminism is a product of its time and is not born out of any contemporary political Islamic movement, stated Malki, whose article on Islamic feminism was published in last week’s Sunday forum of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
In her article, Malki discusses the importance of Islamic feminism as a defense mechanism adopted by Muslim women to protect themselves from the oppressive practices of patriarchal cultures by emphasizing the rights guaranteed to them in Islam.
“We need to differentiate between Islam as a religion and political Islam. Political Islam has been synonymous for religious extremism that took a violent path, deviating from the peaceful message of Islam. It has created a whole world of images and symbols that have negative connotations in the Western mind,” she stated in the e-mail.
Kaufer also suggested that Muslim women bear the burden of proving that while they may appear to embrace certain Western ideals of feminism, they are by no means imitating Western feminism.
“The Islamic woman faces an identity battle where, in order to be taken seriously, she must from the grassroots of Islam extract a word — ‘feminism’ — that the West would understand, and yet not be mistaken for simply importing the history of the Western conception of women,” he said.
While Islamic feminism does not occur often in Western discourse, it faces opposition by secular feminists in Islamic countries, such as Iran and Turkey.
For example, Haideh Moghissi, a professor of sociology at York University in Canada and founder of the Iranian National Union of Women, stated in her book Feminism and Islamic Fundamentalism that while “it has become fashionable to speak sympathetically and enthusiastically about the reformist activities of Muslim women,” this is a problematic development as it resonates the political message of Islamic fundamentalism.
Moghissi, who left Iran in 1984, also mentions in her book that the term “Islamic feminism” originated in Iran to cater to the female political elite and serve the interests of the country’s “clerical rulers,” rather than the average Iranian woman.
On the other hand, Melek Yazici, a senior business major at the University of Pittsburgh, believes that Islamic feminism is a response to the cultural oppression that resulted in the exclusion of women from the social sphere.
“It is a struggle to get our rights back and make our way back into mainstream society,” she said.
Yazici, who hails from Turkey, also pointed out that a more nationalistic concern underlies the clash between secular Turkish feminism and Islamic feminism in Turkey.
“Turkish feminists think of Islam as the cause of all our problems in Turkey, without taking into consideration cultural values,” said Yazici.
Straddling Europe and Asia, Turkey was strictly secularized in 1923 under its founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. 
Since then, many Muslims in Turkey have been caught between religion and secularism, as Islamic practices like wearing the headscarf have been banned in public institutions, including schools and colleges.
“They have been brainwashed with the idea that Islam is the reason why Turkey couldn’t become a developed country earlier in time,” she said. “You would see a lot of Turkish feminists supporting the ban in schools, which is ironic: women not supporting the freedom of fellow women,” Yazici said.
Miles away in the Persian Gulf region, in Qatar, the local government continues to initiate women’s empowerment in both academic and professional arenas, stated Malki. 
“This counts for them as some change needs to be based on strong and legitimate grounds,” she said.
“For example, the Women’s Department in the Supreme Council of Family Affairs have been working on empowering women through different means; the most fundamental is to educate them about their legal rights,” Malki stated.
Dana Hadan, a Qatari national and a senior at the Tepper School of Business, said, “Islamic feminism means to me enjoying all my rights as a woman, such as getting an education, working wherever I want, getting married whenever I want and to whoever I want, and living on my own terms without having to take a male’s permission to do anything. “However, doing this does not force me to compromise my religious values. My religion allows me to do it,” she said.
A University of Pittsburgh alumnus, Abrar Rageh, said that women in the East and West “can build a bridge of understanding and unity” based on their complementary position in this realm of feminism.
“Women in the West had to fight for rights that were already granted for women in the East, such as voting,” Rageh said. 
“Women in the West finally got that right. Meanwhile, women in the East have the religious right, but culturally are oppressed. Women in the East and West can then stand together as one, help each other overcome these obstacles, and oppose oppression in any shape or form,” Rageh said.
“The key lies in getting the best education we can,” said Hadan. “With education and confidence, Islamic and Western feminists can force governments to create laws that support women’s rights rather than feed the agenda of a male-dominated society,” she said.
On whether women across the world can establish a “global sisterhood,” Malki stated that the “universality of women’s issues and concerns are almost often interrupted by the specificities of their local culture.”
“I know as a woman that, although there is an emotional connection that relates me with all women in the globe, I am still different and unique as I am a product of a certain culture that has its set of freedoms and constraints,” she said.

Next Saturday marks the second annual Carnegie Mellon day of service, 1000plus, where students have the opportunity to give back to the greater campus community through a plethora of service activities.
“This ambitious initiative aims to engage over 1000 members of the Carnegie Mellon community in unique service activities in the Pittsburgh area on one day per year,” said Coordinator of Student Development Lucas Christian, who also sits on the 1000plus board.
“Our hope with 1000plus is to help members of the Carnegie Mellon community see the wide variety of ways they can impact the community through service. We also hope that individuals who participate in 1000plus can establish relationships with service agencies that result in reoccurring involvement and support.” 
Students, staff, and faculty are all invited to participate. This year will mark only the first anniversary of this annual day of service. 
“1000plus was started to give our campus opportunities to get engaged in service, as well as to allow people to network with others who also have an interest in making a positive impact on our world,” junior chemistry major Ashley Kilp said.
Christian also commented, “The initiative was created last year by a group of individuals with a lot of hopes and very little time to turn them into reality. Last year’s committee did not start planning until February of 2008.”
Nevertheless, Kilp feels that the event was a success: “It was an absolute blast. People brought their friends; we had music playing; and it felt really good to be doing something worthwhile and have fun at the same time.”
This year, 1000plus is partnering with Pittsburgh Cares to expand the types of volunteer positions offered throughout the Pittsburgh community. 
“Pittsburgh Cares has helped us identify a wide variety of opportunities that we think will help students, faculty, staff, and alumni gain a new perspective on how they can give back to their community,” Christian said. 
“For example, this year’s list of service opportunities includes a project that allows participants the opportunity to rappel down Mt. Washington while cleaning up the cliffside.”
Other opportunities include sorting books at the Library for the Blind and Physically Handicapped, planting trees with the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy, painting classrooms at the Wilkins School and Community Center, and requesting donations from shoppers outside the Giant Eagle in Squirrel Hill.“There really is something for everyone,” Kilp said.
The most anticipated activity offered during 1000plus could be the Service Crawl. 
A service crawl is a scavenger hunt of sorts involving a variety of service-oriented tasks. 
Described as similar to the CBS reality show The Amazing Race, the service crawl actually pits groups of four to five volunteers against each other in a race to visit several nonprofit agencies and complete short mission-based projects in support of those agencies.  
“Currently, there are a lot of agencies in need of volunteer support,” Christian  stated.
“Through participation, the volunteers will hopefully be inspired to take action and continue be involved within their communities,” explained program assistant Alex New.
Also, there is typically a reward at the end for the fastest team. 
“Carnegie Mellon is one of our most active college campuses,” New said. “For example ... Pittsburgh Cares hosted a service crawl during Carnegie Mellon’s orientation.... We also are working on coordinating Service Saturdays, where around 20 different students volunteer every Saturday for the entire academic year.”
Because space is limited for some opportunities, students, faculty, or staff members interested in participating in 1000plus should register in advance online at the program’s site:www.willyoubecounted.com/opportunties. 
On March 28, check-in begins at 11 a.m. in Wiegand Gym in the University Center, followed by a short program highlighting the university’s service accomplishments at 11:30. 
Teams of volunteers will leave from the gym and participate in various service opportunities between noon and 5 p.m. 
Service projects will last approximately two to four hours. 
Transportation is provided for service opportunities outside of walking distance.

A new study by Carnegie Mellon’s Green Design Institute can make students feel better about how their online purchases affect greenhouse gas emissions. 
The study was led by H. Scott Matthews, associate professor of civil and environmental engineering and director of the Green Design Institute, and it compared the energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions associated with customers purchasing a flash drive from a traditional retailer to purchasing the same item from Buy.com.
A traditional retailer’s supply chain typically operates by shipping goods from manufacturers to distributors who then ship to regional warehouses to store the goods, finally shipping them to actual retail stores.
Buy.com’s Internet retail model eliminates these intermittent steps and associated carbon dioxide emissions by shipping directly from distributors to customers through a parcel service.
“In a study of this nature with numerous variables, we took great care to estimate average- case performance using simulations and approximations,” Matthews  said. “We were able to show that in the majority of cases studied, the Buy.com e-commerce model does perform better than shopping at traditional retail in the areas of carbon dioxide emissions and energy consumption.”
According to the study, ground shipping in Buy.com’s model uses 35 percent less energy and carbon dioxide emissions than a traditional retail model; when express air shipping is used, the difference is smaller, but still in favor of the e-commerce model.
Emissions from such factors as individual packaging and delivery, as well as computer and data center use, apply only to the commerce model.
The most significant element, however, only applies to the traditional method of purchasing: 65 percent of the emissions associated with the traditional model result from customer transportation to and from the retail store. 
“These results are surprising to me; I never would have guessed that customer transportation is such a huge factor,” said junior decision science major Andrea Tan.
Many Carnegie Mellon students make purchases online of everything from books to clothes to electronics. 
“I’ve been buying online a lot more since I came to college,” said Natalie French, a first-year civil and environmental engineering major and eco-rep. “It’s easier for me to buy something online than to take time to go to the store.”
“For me it’s all about the time,” remarked Anna Lenhart, a junior civil and environmental engineering major and vice president of Carnegie Mellon’s Engineers Without Borders chapter. “If I need something right away then I will buy it in a store, but if I can wait for shipping, I will definitely purchase online.”
While students interviewed said they wouldn’t likely change their purchasing habits in light of these results, French added that she likes buying online even more now because “it gives me more hours in a day and saves the world.”
Some students like the idea of going green while saving money. “I buy online because it’s cheaper; reducing carbon emissions is icing on the cake,” said Eddie Yuen, a junior civil and environmental engineering major and eco-rep.
The study, “Life Cycle Comparison of Traditional Retail and E-Commerce Logistics for Electronic Products: A Case Study of Buy.com,” can be found at www.ce.cmu.edu/GreenDesign.

Cornell University and Penn State University (PSU) recently added their names to the growing list of universities that have severed ties with Russell Athletics, the collegiate gear manufacturer for many schools. The company has lost some of its contracts due to the closing of its factory in Honduras.
The universities’ decision to end contracts with the apparel manufacturer was made because of the company’s motives for the future of the Honduras factory. 
According to union representatives, Russell Athletics closed the factory mainly because of its workers’ attempts to unionize and not significantly because of the company’s economic concerns.
Two factory workers were brought into the United States and toured universities to tell their side of the story as workers and leaders of the union. 
Moises Elias a Bovado, the president of the union, and Norma Estela Mejia Castellano, vice president of the union, came to the U.S. so that they could reveal what was happening in Honduras.
They explained the difficulties they had in forming the union, the threats they received, and the problems they wanted to erase. They also detailed the current status of unemployed workers in Honduras and how they looked to the U.S. government for assistance.
The two workers toured many universities, mainly those that had a contract with Russell Athletics, and recited their story to the students, staff, and faculty who gathered to listen to them. Both Bovado and Castellano spoke through an interpreter.
“We were so shocked to hear how our collegiate gear was made. We are very proud of PSU for taking the right step,” said Sagarika Badyal, a first-year engineering student at PSU. She noticed that “we never really think about the fact that we have no idea where our clothes are made; for all we know they could be the product of child labor.”
Nakul Bagla, a business administration first-year at Carnegie Mellon, said, “I love to go shopping and buy new clothes, but I rarely inquire about where and how these clothes are made.”
Roger Rouse, a history professor at Carnegie Mellon, teaches a course about globalization that makes students question the integrity of some textile producers. Jake Arakal, a junior materials science and biomedical engineering double major, remembers sitting in one of Rouse’s classes thinking about the issue of textile production.
“Rouse made us check the tags on all of our clothes one day in class so we could see where they were produced. I was kind of surprised when he took a poll of the class and less than 20 people had clothes made in the United States,” Arakal said.
Sanil Shah, a CIT first-year, said, “All they say on the tags of clothes is the country they are manufactured in. However, that does not tell us a lot about the conditions of the workers that made these clothes.”
People can find out where their clothes originated by taking advantage of many organizations dedicated to this cause.
For these investigations, there are many nonprofit organizations, such as United Students Against Sweatshops (USAS), and others that focus on researching information about textiles manufacturing for consumers.

On Wednesday, there was a talk on Middle Eastern culture, American education, and the combination of the two. Zvika Krieger, a journalist for The New Republic, spoke on campus about the expansion of American universities into the Gulf region, including trendsetter Carnegie Mellon Qatar. Krieger spoke on the complexities involved with integrating two distinct cultures, including local reactions, national impact, and changes in popular opinion. 
Krieger’s lecture was the first in a new series, The Israel Speaker Series. 
Elliot Onn, senior social and decision sciences major and member of Tartans for Israel, spoke on the series’ goals.
“By bringing in speakers whose reputations are based on their accuracy and who have the inside track, so to speak, we are enabling intellectual inquiry in a way that can't happen when you're advocating a position or pushing one point of view,” Onn said.
Onn also hopes to show Carnegie Mellon students how they can use their skill sets to address global issues, as well allow them to explore these big ideas through smaller ideas and theories. 
Krieger began his lecture by talking about his background in the Middle East and the way he views the relationship between their society and the West. 
“The Middle East is a region full of contradictions,” Krieger said. 
In Lebanon, a Hezbollah fighter repeatedly told Krieger “Death to America,” then in the next second, said “I hate America, but I love the Lakers.” 
In Beirut, a local girl in a nightclub was dressed in a miniskirt with a Hezbollah necklace.
In Egypt, locals on a bus were commenting on the evils on America, then after learning where Krieger was from, switched to talking about Britney Spears and asking him for help getting a visa. 
“American universities opening in the Middle East is such a minefield topic for so many people,” Krieger said, citing many of these daily encounters as some of the reasons. 
Krieger said that he had never gotten so many letters, phone calls, and blog and website comments on any of his other article topics. 
Onn was hopeful that the world of contradictions could be quelled.
“I think that when societies in the Arab world strip away factors that support fundamentalism (such as propaganda in media and incitement), these intra-cultural conflicts will certainly disappear with them,” Onn said.
Krieger took a similarly optimistic tone to Onn.
“I think as technology and globalization closes the rift between East and West, we'll start to see a lot more common ground emerge,” he said.
Krieger focused his talk on American education in the Gulf and spoke on three main regions: Qatar and the cities of Dubai and Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.
He described Qatar as having a “vision to be the hub of American education.” Qatar’s university campus, Education City, does not have full universities but rather their strongest programs. Carnegie Mellon Qatar, for example, offers degrees in computer science, business, and information systems. Cornell’s medical school and Georgetown’s journalism school are just two more of the programs. According to Krieger, Education City aims to be the Ivy League of the Middle East.
Dubai has taken quite a different approach. While all of Qatar’s schools are funded by their government in the form of the Qatar Foundation, Dubai’s universities are for-profit. Krieger called Dubai’s main campus, Knowledge Village, a “shopping mall” of low to middle-quality institutions. In recent years, however, Dubai is attempting to set itself apart from Qatar in separating its village into individual cities, such as Healthcare City featuring Harvard University. 
As for the capital of Abu Dhabi, its schools are government-funded like Qatar. With 10 percent of the world’s oil, Abu Dhabi has a lack of worry for its future, and thus it is taking the slowest approach out of the three regions. Similarly to Qatar, it aims to attract only high-quality institutions. In addition to recently signing a deal for a full New York University campus, Abu Dhabi has already installed a branch of the Sorbonne, the Louvre, and a Massachusetts Institute of Technology research facility. 
“There are two main questions here,” Krieger said. “On the one hand, how is this good for the universities? On the other hand, is this good for the Arab countries?” 
According to Mark Rudnick, senior English and history major and member of Tartans For Israel, the advantage lies with the Arab regions.
“I think certainly both groups have a lot to gain from the relationship, but the Arab countries in particular have a great deal to gain from the expansion of Western education, and really just the expansion of high-quality university education overall,” Rudnick said.
Krieger brought up the many advantages and disadvantages of education in the Gulf, including a diverse population, predominance of English, and a safe atmosphere. On the other hand, he mentioned a high cost of living, a lack of indigenous culture, and a lower quality of students when compared to the American counterparts, and a lack of cultural activities for university students.  
He also mentioned that these Gulf institutions are attracting the brightest students and professors from other Middle Eastern institutions, including the well-known American Universities at Cairo and Beirut, calling it a “brain drain.” 
Onn spoke on the idealistic side.
“Stylistically, some American schools in the region want a strict American educational experience, and that is also the preference of their state benefactors. This approach carries the benefit of introducing inquiry and debate, but it is new in the sense that it's not the nature of the region,” he said.
Krieger mentioned that this movement is very new and that things may change. 
“What works in America does not work best in the Middle East. You can not just take an American institution and plop it down in the Middle East,” he said. 
Rudnick remains optimistic.
“I think that as more established universities continue to make the push to expand to the Middle East, the education system that grows there will gain a lot of respect,” he said.
The next installment of the series will be Yossi Klein Halevi speaking on his spiritual journey in the Middle East today at 4:30 p.m. in the Adamson Wing (BH 136A).

Skiing accidents are not uncommon on the slopes, and a lingering debate stands between skiers and medical groups over wearing helmets. No studies have confirmed or denied the effectiveness of helmets for skiers, but they have become increasingly popular with skiers. In light of Natasha Richardson’s recent death, we thought it was important to share some statistics on the tragic causes of traumatic brain injury (TBI):
Number of people who sustain a TBI each year in the U.S.: 1.4 million
Number of people who sustain a TBI and die each year in the U.S.: 50,000
Percentage of TBIs caused by falls or blows: 47
Number of people whose problems with language and learning persist a year after their injury:
 3.17 million

In the article “CMU students bring the Penguins straight to your phone,” published in the March 2 issue of The Tartan, Michael Chuang was mistakeningly identified as a Ph.D. student in chemical and computer engineering. 
Chuang is actually a Ph.D. student in electrical and computer engineering.

Move over, network news anchors: A comedian is here to stay.
On March 12, Jon Stewart interviewed CNBC’s Jim Cramer, an often erratic, supposed financial analysis expert who hosts his own stock market television show, Mad Money. On his late-night Comedy Central show, The Daily Show (the best of late-night television), the never quiet, sometimes crass, always brazen comedic host called Cramer out on his inability — and seeming lack of desire — to protect the American people from greedy CEOs and CFOs of major financial companies while presenting financial advice on his CNBC program. He also used Cramer as a representation of CNBC’s — and likely other major news networks — failures to accurately predict or cover the downfall of the stock market.
While Stewart is known for being to the point with his interviewees, unafraid to call anyone’s bluff and quite often straddling a fine line between comedy and abrasion, this interview was different. His interview with Cramer signaled a new, more serious direction for Stewart’s interviews, and represented an important new direction in which journalism must move in order to remain truthful and loyal to the people.
I won’t pretend that my somewhat inappropriate crush on Stewart isn’t influencing my desire to see more interviews and important news stories led by the comedian-turning-reporter. My leftward-leaning love is witty, smart, and wears nice suits. I am, admittedly, easily swayed by such characteristics. That said, though, it is this very wit that makes Stewart so relevant and so necessary for the voice of the American people in times of trouble.
The interview with Cramer was, more or less, a case study — albeit a very relevant and powerful one — of the problem with mainstream news reporting. When the effervescent financial reporter tried to reestablish the legitimacy of his faulty reporting related to the country’s economic crisis, insisting that he was misled by the financial leaders that actually brought down the economy, Stewart’s ability to mock while simultaneously making a significant point in his argument, and rallying the audience behind him, worked: “The CEO of a company lied to you,” he stated in shocked disarray. “But isn’t that financial reporting?”
“We have reporters who try really hard; we’re not always told the truth,” Cramer reiterated, flustered. From my limited experience as a journalist for this student newspaper, I sympathize with Cramer: It can be very difficult to encourage interviewees to get to the meat of the issue about which you are interviewing them, and it’s rare — if it happens at all — to get past anything but face value, the edited content that is sold to journalists by interviewees and informants. But, then, this is the essence of journalism: digging below the surface and subverting what is sold to consumers, the American people, at face value.
Stewart sees this. He and others following suit, such as Stephen Colbert’s character-driven news program and Daily Show spin-off, The Colbert Report, have been using comedy as a means of questioning the rest of what is displayed in the media. More than just an important case study of the failures of financial reporting on the part of major news networks, such as CNBC, this interview acts as a window into the potential future of truthful journalism, led by such comedic pioneers as Stewart.
In the interview, Stewart was able to call out Cramer in ways too politically incorrect on traditional news venues, as he insinuated that CNBC and the Cramer-types of reporters are in bed with the bad guys. Moreover, he seemed shrewdly aware of his own role in changing face of journalism, in the need for more honest reporting: as he concluded the interview, Stewart called for CNBC and Cramer to get back to “the fundamentals on reporting” so he could “go back to making fart noises and funny faces.”
This is the point. Stewart, a comedian, is filling the void left by dishonest mainstream media sources. Maybe this is the future of comedy — a transition from playground humor to the subversion of — for lack of a better, less hippie-tastic word — the Man. In this age of fast-paced information acquisition and an overwhelming number of means of the transmission of that information, is laughter and gentle mockery the only things left that we can do?
Stewart may represent the new form of counterculture in this country — even though he wears a (well-fitting) suit. Is this the new means of subversion? Like safety-pin earrings to the British punk subculture in the 1970s, is the comedian-as-reporter our only means of subverting those in power — the heads of the financial industry that brought down ordinary Americans, and the media sources that did nothing to out them — in this age?
Jessica Thurston (jthursto@) is too scared to poke safety pins through her ears.

The technological revolution that the world is experiencing is old news these days. Blackberrys are no longer reserved for high-powered businessmen; rather, I pass more people in the hallways on campus who have either a Blackberry or an iPhone than don’t. And it’s not even just the college and high-school crowds that are part of the cell phone craze: most kids as young as elementary and middle school carry around at least a simple cell phone, which is a shocking contrast to the long year I spent begging my parents for my first phone.
And with the changes in technology, many changes are being made in the way things were done. Now, not only do teachers have to worry about a cell going off in class, but they also have to be alert for students attempting to cheat via text messaging. And when students sit down to take the strictly enforced “you may never, ever speak of your answers to anyone” AP tests, cell phones are put into double-digit piles in the front of the room. But I never thought that adults, long finished with the days of exams and homework assignments, would find a way to use their smartphones to cheat in real life. I was wrong.
At least three recent court cases had to be thrown out due to cell phone uses in the courtroom. Jurors in each of these cases used their smartphones to access the Internet for either Google or Wikipedia to get information, look up definitions of confusing words, or read online versions of news stories concerning the case, after they were specifically told not to by the judge at the beginning of the trial.
I will be the first to admit that more often than not, I do not understand the complex and convoluted legal rules that mire courtroom proceedings. With bringing forward witnesses, entering evidence, and calling the ever-important objection, things can get confusing to an outsider fast. What I do understand, however, is that you’re only allowed to know what the judge decides that you are allowed to know. There’s a reason for objections and evidence, and it’s to help ensure that the trial is fair, as ensured by the Constitution. When a judge tells you not to do something, such as look for information about the case, you don’t. And yet, people did. Why? One juror stated that he was simply curious.
Not only are people using their phones to act as lawyer and gather their own information about a trial, but they are using them to update sites like Facebook and Twitter with information about the cases. Even with my limited legal knowledge, I know that this is a no-no. How seriously can a juror really be taking a case if he makes sarcastic comments about it on Twitter? I sure wouldn’t want people chiming in on — and possibly influencing — my court case via a juror’s status update.
Aside from the legal and ethical issues that going against a judge’s instructions brings about, we also cannot ignore the financial effects of these mistrials. When a case has to be thrown out at the end of the trial because someone confesses to, or is caught, tampering like these jurors did, thousands of dollars are wasted in court proceedings when the case has to be thrown out and more money is spent in appeal trials. The economy is clearly an important issue to everyone right now, and losing money because jurors couldn’t follow instructions is something no one needs.
In this technologically driven age, people want to know whatever they want, whenever they want it. Boundaries mean very little anymore — you can search the Internet for practically anything you want, from celebrities’ sex tapes to blog entries on what people had for dinner last night or their opinion on politics or religion. And this ease of having information at our fingertips has made us feel entitled to information, and made us think it’s okay to research anything and everything at any time, and to feel that while rules do exist, we are obviously the exception to them. After all, in these cases, people aren’t spreading any malicious rumors — they just want to know the truth.
But while jurors may think that they’re helping to ensure a fair trial by doing some background research on their own, they need to realize that they’re not. In going against the judge’s directions, they are messing with the whole system of legal proceedings. Each juror is supposed to keep his or her opinions and deliberations about the trial to him or herself, in order to keep the trial fair. When they search the Internet for information, there is a high likelihood that the information they find will skew their opinion, whether they realize it or not. This is especially dangerous if their source is a site like Wikipedia, where the accuracy can never be verified and could be quickly changing. So in trying to help make a trial as fair as it can be, they are actually helping to do just the opposite.
But is there really a way to police this trend? Even if jurors had to surrender their cell phones while in the courtroom, they would likely just look things up on their computer when they got home. And sequestering every jury definitely doesn’t sound like a feasible solution. There’s no way for the court to make sure that jurors do what they’re told in this case — just as there’s no way for them to be sure a juror isn’t discussing the case with others and asking for their input. There are some things that just cannot be policed. So the only real solution is relying on people’s own — and their fellow jurors’ — sense of integrity. If the judge tells them not to look up extra information, they just shouldn’t do it. Simple as that.

American International Group (AIG), once the largest insurance company in the U.S., has been in the news ever since its initial collapse in September and the consequent taxpayer bailout of $170 billion that it received from the Treasury and Federal Reserve.
A week ago, AIG announced that it would be paying bonuses to its executives, in total worth around $165 million. What is even more stinging than the fact that American taxpayers’ money is being used to beef up already high salaries of executives is the fact that the executives being offered the bonuses are the same ones primarily responsible for the collapse of the company.
Bonuses offered by companies are often performance related; if the company makes a profit, the employees receive more bonuses. AIG’s bonuses seem to completely defy this logic. AIG is defending its decision, saying that the bonuses were promised to the employees last year before the company collapsed, and by the contract, the company is obliged to pay the bonuses.
According to a statement made by Edward M. Liddy, the chairman of AIG, in The New York Times, the bonuses are being awarded in order to “retain the best and the brightest talent” in AIG. It is hard to see how the executives responsible for making the faulty judgments that brought the company to collapse in the first place can be termed as the “best and brightest talent.”
Many taxpayers, however, as well as President Obama, did not agree with AIG’s strategy of retaining key employees by paying them with taxpayer’s money. Taking heed of angered citizens’ complaints, Obama promised to do everything he could to keep the bonuses from being paid out.
And he certainly kept his word. We believe that the Obama administration is taking the right steps to counter this situation. Soon after the announcement of the bonuses, President Obama ordered the Treasury Department to try to block the bonuses. Last Thursday, the House approved a 90 percent tax on bonuses paid to employees of firms receiving large amounts of bailout funds.
We are pleased that the government is responding to public sentiment in this way and is taking an active role in managing the money of the people. Using the bailout funds for awarding its employees bonuses is an extremely irresponsible move on AIG’s part, and it is heartening to see that the government is taking measures to block the bonuses and also to prevent other companies from misusing the bailout funds in this way.
Editorial Dissent, Amanda Cole: Public sentiment has no place in business, and a large tax should not be instituted just to appease the public.

There were several ambiguities in the Feb. 7 article “Online higher education company gains popularity” describing the company 2tor, which is partnering with USC’s Rosser School of Education to deliver teaching certification online.
We have two types of problems with the article — the nature of the article and the misrepresentations. The article starts as a prospectus or infomercial for 2tor. It goes on to undermine the teaching certification program we have with Chatham with an inaccurate statement about the program: “...to make this happen, students must know in their first year that they want to pursue this route, and it is rarely used.” At no point did the author check with anyone involved with the program. She implied that one has to know in the first year led to the “rare use.” It also does not convey the nature of state certification for teaching.
The opinions of one of us (Jones) were solicited to contribute perspective on online learning and to comment on 2tor. The article was not submitted to me before publication, otherwise I would have demanded that my name and contribution be removed, given the promotional tone of most of the article, for which the only other source was the on-campus commercial representative of 2tor.
Using The Tartan for this sort of promotion of external commercial enterprises by students under the guise of legitimate journalism is extremely unfortunate, to say the least. This undermining of the mission of The Tartan strikes us as a problem equal in import to that of the confusing message of institutional affiliation of an educational startup.

As a fourth-year architecture student, I would like to respond to the March 2 article, “Schools of Art, Architecture should work together.” I would argue that there are more interdisciplinary qualities between the two than what is decribed in the article.
I disagree that it is “rare for students of each school to dabble in courses with each other.” I know of plenty of architecture students that have taken art studios or photography courses. I would also like to note that every architecture major is required to take three semesters of drawing courses — not CAD drawing, but drawing in the traditional sense. While it is true that this course is taught within the School of Architecture, it is really more of an art class.
I’d also like to bring to light a collaboration that is currently occurring between art and architecture students that I am involved in. An architecture studio and an art studio have been working together on the renovation of an old house to be turned into a community/sustainability center. We got a chance to work with Peter Fend, the lecturer noted in the article (let me briefly concur with the “crazy” accusation), on the project. I could go into great detail about how the two studios are working together or how many of my peers are involved in artistic endeavors, but the point is that these interdisciplinary instances do arise more frequently than one may perceive at first.

Student government elections will occur in less than a week, yet thus far, there has been very little publicity from either the elections board or the candidates to help get the student body informed, involved, and voting, and we’re unhappy with this.
Until Friday afternoon, there seemed to be no sign of the upcoming elections on campus — the usual posters that litter the walls of every building on campus  were missing, and even on Friday, there were only campaigners on the Cut for one of the three tickets for student body president and vice president.
Despite the lack of publicity about the elections or the candidates on campus, many students are still at least partially informed about the election, as each candidate has a Facebook group dedicated to his or her campaign, and each also has a website outlining his or her campaign promises.
Publicity for this year’s elections has been almost entirely done on Facebook, and even then, groups didn’t really contain any information about the candidates or their platforms until the middle of last week. This gives the student body very little time to learn enough about the candidates and their goals to make an informed decision before voting next week. Students now have less than one week in which to learn everything they can about the candidates for student body president and student body vice president of finance before voting begins next Sunday.
The student government website only updated candidates in the middle of last week, and even at the time of this article’s publication, the candidates’ platforms aren’t available on the student government site.
While we know that it is difficult to properly publicize elections when they occur only two weeks after spring break, we think that the elections board should be doing more to make the student body aware of the elections and properly educate them about the candidates.
We encourage students to visit the candidates’ websites to learn more about what each candidate plans to do if elected; more information about the candidates can be found on page A1 of this week’s issue. In addition, we encourage students to attend today’s debates, which will take place at 5 p.m. in Doherty Hall 2315, and will offer students the opportunity to ask about the candidates’ platforms and plans for the upcoming year.

Students often look forward to days off from school — snow days and national holidays are always eagerly anticipated. Another time students can get out of classes, and many times many days of classes at a time, is during a teachers’ strike.
While students may look forward to the mini-vacation that strikes can bring, many other members of the community do not share their elation. Because of this, Pennsylvania legislators are re-introducing the Strike-Free Education Act, a proposed ban on teacher strikes, that was first introduced in 2007 but did not pass. 
Proponents of the bill argue that frequent teacher strikes have a detrimental effect on students’ education, but the Pennsylvania State Education Association conducted studies proving that teacher strikes have no significant impact on students’ annual test scores.
The supporters of the bill also argue that 37 other states have banned teacher strikes because of the alleged interruption they bring to students’ lives. Parents are rallying behind the ban because they are unhappy with the strikes disturbing family summer plans and with their children missing classes. However, as required by state law, every day of class is recovered and students do not lose a single day of instruction. So while strikes do interrupt students’ education, they do not miss out on any learning in the long run.
While we realize that there are legitimate reasons for complaints against strikes, such as interruptions of classes that often last unnecessarily long, getting rid of teachers’ rights to strike is not the answer. Strikes are sometimes necessary in order for teachers to improve their working conditions, and although they may seem disruptive at times, they are an effective, and sometimes the only effective, method of negotiation.
We firmly stand behind teachers’ right to fight for more benefits, for better salaries, and for better working conditions. If other public employees and union members (ahem, such as Port Authority bus drivers) are allowed the right to strike, then this right should not be taken from teachers. No law should be passed to restrict teachers’ freedom to demand better treatment.

This weekend, our Student Government began a new transportation initiative (you likely saw posters for it plastered everywhere on campus) called the Loop Bus. The Loop Bus is a weekend-night way for students to get around town to areas they might not go otherwise — or might not trust a PAT bus to take them to. For all the details on the bus, you could either check out this space from the March 2 issue when Jared and Pooja announced the plan, or http://stugov.andrew.cmu.edu/executive/projects/loop_bus.html. But I am not writing here to just rehash what was written then.
Jared and Pooja ran on a platform of finding issues that unify the student population at Carnegie Mellon, and they have done an excellent job of actually doing this. From their task forces to their efforts to improve Tartan Pride, the Loop Bus is just the latest program that helps bring the campus together. Both graduate and undergraduate students should take advantage of it, and the more who do, the more value will we see from it.
Sure, the Loop Bus provides a safer method of getting around Pittsburgh for students. But more than just improving safety and ease, the Loop Bus can improve the Carnegie Mellon experience. The Loop Bus can become cool. It can become the way for students to go out on weekends and to meet up with other Carnegie kids; the way for graduate students to meet the other half of the Carnegie Mellon population and for undergraduates to realize that graduate students (occasionally) come out of their labs.
And for this to happen, we need everyone to find out that the Loop Bus exists, and show us that they would actually use it. In the elections next week, we will be asking the student body, by non-binding referendum, if they would like to see this initiative, or others like it, supported by Student Government. And more than that, if they would be willing to pay a little bit more ($4 per semester) in fees to have the Loop Bus, and whatever else we can come up with, exist all the time.
So to be an informed student, I believe that each and every one of you should go ride the Loop Bus this weekend. And at the same time as we encourage you to go make the Loop Bus a real success, we will be asking you to let us know if it is something you want. If it is, we will do our best to make sure it continues, and if not, Student Government will continue to innovate on your behalf, working to unify the campus, and working to make Carnegie Mellon as good as it can be for you.
