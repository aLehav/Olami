The Carnegie Mellon softball team traveled to Hiram College on Wednesday, May 5, for a doubleheader, dropping the first game by a single run before edging out the Terriers in the second.
The Tartans fell behind in game one when Hiram opened the scoring in the top of the second with their first run and were unable to capitalize on any chances in the bottom of the inning. The scoreline remained 1-0 in favor of the Terriers in the third and fourth innings until Hiram extended their lead with two more runs in the top of the fifth. In the bottom of the inning, Carnegie Mellon first-year Kiera Boucher hit an impressive triple while junior Emily Song and senior Brittany Pierce were on second and third base, respectively, allowing both runners to score. Boucher then scored following a solid hit by Megan Hu to tie the score at 3-3 after five innings.
The next two innings were runless for both teams before Hiram pulled ahead again with a run in the top of the eighth. The Tartans responded, with sophomore Piper Johnson tying the score at 4-4 following sophomore Isabel Bermudez’s hit into center field. Hiram pulled ahead again with another run in the top of the ninth, and with a runless bottom half of the inning, the Terriers edged out the Tartans in game one with a score of 5-4.
Game two began similarly to game one, with Hiram taking a 3-0 lead after a run in the first inning and two in the second. The Tartans came back in the bottom of the fourth inning, with junior Audrey Pederson giving Carnegie Mellon their first run in the second game following a hit by Song, after which junior Summer Faille extended the Tartans’ tally to two runs. Boucher then hit up the middle, allowing Song to make it back to home plate, before scoring herself after Hu singled to the left. This allowed the Tartans to take over the lead at a 4-3 margin before Hiram tied things again with a single run in the fifth inning.
The Terriers then recaptured their lead by scoring two more runs in the top of the sixth, but the Tartans rallied — Song scored after a double by Boucher, and a throwing error by the Hiram shortstop allowed Boucher and Hu to add two more runs to let Carnegie Mellon retake the lead at 7-6. The game was called at the top of the seventh due to darkness, with the Tartans still leading.

Using Twitter to predict traffic
With the power of big data and language analysis, Associate Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering Sean Qian and his Ph.D. student Weiran Yao were able to use information scraped from Twitter to accurately predict morning traffic patterns. By applying language analysis models to anonymized, geotagged tweets, Qian and Yao were able to gain insights into the sleep-wake patterns of individual commuters as well as planned and accidental traffic incidents which affect congestion times. Even simple personal tweets can provide useful information, showing just how powerful abundant data can be when properly harnessed and interpreted. This new method helps supplement the lack of traffic information during nighttime, and can help transportation agencies better optimize their routes.

Vehicle electrification and ridesharing services
Companies like Uber and Lyft have changed the way we commute, with ridesharing services now making it easier than ever to get a ride using only your phone. However, mobilizing massive fleets of automobiles comes with an environmental cost in the form of air pollution, something the free market does not correct for on its own. In a study by Professor of Engineering and Public Policy and Mechanical Engineering Jeremy Michalek and his Ph.D. student Matthew Bruchon, it was discovered that if companies like Uber and Lyft were properly taxed for their contributions to air pollution, they would be incentivized to reduce that cost, and increasing electrification of their vehicles is one way of doing just that. While companies like Uber and Lyft are making attempts at increasing electrification, the study finds that the rate of conversion to electric vehicles would be greatly accelerated with properly imposed penalties.

With the spring semester almost over, much of the Carnegie Mellon community's attention turns towards the upcoming fall semester. So far, Carnegie Mellon administrators have indicated that the fall semester will feature the return of mostly in-person instruction, and the university announced on Monday that COVID-19 vaccines will be required for all students enrolled in U.S.-based programs starting in the fall.
In an email to The Tartan, Provost Jim Garrett wrote, "In general, fall 2021 will look much more like fall 2019." He specified that the majority of classes will be offered in-person in the fall with limited remote classes. 
Plans for the fall are still in flux. As of Sunday, the schedule of classes for fall 2021 still has not been released, and class registration has been delayed to the week starting June 7. Additionally, students will not be able to study remotely in some cases. For example, the electrical and computer engineering program emailed students that the fall would be fully in-person. They wrote, "If you are unable to return to campus for the Fall 2021 semester, please reach out to your academic advisor to discuss a leave of absence."
Travel restrictions have remained throughout the pandemic, most recently when President Biden barred certain groups of travelers from India due to COVID-19 concerns (students were exempted). Provost Garrett assured that Carnegie Mellon expects the majority of students to be able to study in person and on campus in the fall.
Garret added, "In light of the ongoing pandemic, we also recognize there may be some international students who will encounter visa challenges with consulates in their countries of origin that may preclude them from on-time arrival." The Office of International Education (OIE) will continue to work with students on visa issues, according to Garrett. He wrote that each department and program will work with international students to ensure they can continue their academic progress.
Garrett wrote that planning to have the fall semester in person was enabled by COVID-19 vaccines. In his email to The Tartan, he credited COVID-19 vaccines as "critical to our ability to protect community health and well-being as well as resume in-person operations in the fall." Carnegie Mellon has now joined multiple other colleges in requiring students to get COVID-19 vaccines to return to campus.
Even with vaccines, Garrett wrote, "We will still be using other mitigation tools to protect our community." Most Carnegie Mellon students in the U.S. have been able to get vaccines since all 50 states opened eligibility to all adults. Despite this, April 2021 set the record for most COVID-19 cases within Carnegie Mellon with over 100 cases. Vice President for Student Affairs Gina Casalegno and Chief of Staff Daryl Weinert acknowledged this record in an email, and wrote, "Failure to follow protocols puts our entire community at risk, jeopardizing students as they prepare for finals and impacting our thinking about hosting in-person events on campus, including Commencement in just three weeks."
In the email to The Tartan, Provost Garrett wrote, "We urge all students to continue to wear facial coverings; wash hands frequently; maintain physical distance from others; complete your daily self-assessment; and if you’re going to be on campus, remember to participate in Tartan Testing. It is essential to practice these precautions even after you are vaccinated."

On Wednesday, May 5, Carnegie Mellon University awarded Dr. Lucy Shapiro the Dickson Prize in Science and hosted a lecture from her over Zoom. Shapiro is a professor of developmental biology at the Stanford University School of Medicine. She has worked extensively in understanding cellular mechanics and also received the National Medal of Science in 2011 from President Barack Obama. 
Shapiro’s lecture began with an introduction by Provost Jim Garrett, Dr. Luisa Hiller, Dr. Jonathan Minden, and Dr. Veronica Hinman, who all expressed their congratulations to Shapiro on the work that she has done throughout her career.
After the introductions, Shapiro began her talk about the complex systems that underlie processes like cell division. Central to the cell’s behavior is a cascading series of regulatory systems that control gene expressions. Since most of her work has been with the bacterial strain Caulobacter, Shapiro talked extensively about the different processes and regulators within bacterial cells. For example, Shapiro explained in-depth the role that the transcription factor CtrA plays in regulating other enzymes like DNA methyltransferase. 
One of the biggest takeaways from her research that Shapiro emphasized was that the core logic of the cell regulatory network is conserved, while the peripheral logic is flexible. As a result, the fundamental operations of cells remain consistent across different cell types, but other systems are adapted to cells' specific environments and functions. Shapiro also discussed the various experiments that she and her collaborators performed and how these studies provided insights into how DNA methylation controlled the timing of cell cycle transcription factors, and what the architecture of the cell’s regulatory system looks like.
At the end of her talk, Shapiro summarized the importance of understanding these integrated cellular subsystems since, she said, this idea of system logic applies to nearly every domain of life. Afterward, the floor was opened for questions.
Many of the questions asked focused on the viability of an inherently stochastic system since the complex chemical reactions that happen in a cell happen randomly. In response to this, Shapiro explained that stochastic cellular processes are viable due to the many levels of regulatory systems in place to ensure that the system survives. Such systems act as a check on the randomness so that the mechanisms which keep the cell alive have fail-safes. 
Another audience member asked if it was possible to model these cellular systems and to predict their behaviors. To this, Shapiro responded that it was possible and that she and her collaborators have conducted interdisciplinary research in this area using computer simulations in place of wet-lab experiments. She went on to emphasize the importance of having an interdisciplinary education, as scientific advancements often come from the intersection of different fields.
The last question from the audience asked Shapiro what she would like to say to the next generation of scientists. Shapiro began by expressing her pride and gratitude for the cohorts of students that she has worked with. She reminded the audience of the importance of scientists being not only researchers but also effective communicators. Shapiro asserted that scientists need to ensure that the knowledge that is created in the laboratory can be used to benefit all of society, especially during times of political and social upheaval.

The Undergraduate Student Senate presented the work of the Senate committees over the past year and elected the chairs of each committee for the next school year in their final meeting last Thursday.
There are eight committees in the Senate, those being the Academic Affairs, Advocacy, Business Affairs, Campus Life, Communications, Finance, Internal Development, and Executive Committees.
At the meeting, the Academic Affairs Committee presented their work with various other faculty and university groups to investigate course delivery modes, implement the 2020-2021 pass/fail voucher policy, fund course materials, and survey students on their academic experiences during the pandemic. The Advocacy Committee reviewed their survey used to assess how students learned best during the pandemic, and they also presented recommendations according to their feedback from administrators. The Business Affairs Committee highlighted their recommendations for creating all-gender housing, more equitable on-campus employment policies and payment, and raising awareness of transportation options on campus. The Campus Life Committee discussed the social media campaign Humans of CMU, Senate Scotty Sweepstakes, the First Lecture Series, and their efforts towards setting up outdoor charging stations in the future. The Communications Committee created a Senate Spotlight series on social media and explored possibilities for students to receive updates on Senate initiatives they were interested in. The Finance committee reimbursed Black Lives Matter projects and poll workers, began an initiative to pay Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion student workers, and held a financial town hall for university administration to answer financial questions. The Internal Development Committee held socials for senators and also contributed to creating the Senate Spotlight social media series. The Executive Committee worked with Communications and Business Affairs to secure The New York Times digital access for Carnegie Mellon faculty and students. 
In addition, Senate held an election for the Executive Committee, which is composed of the chairs of each of the other committees. Liam O'Connell was re-elected Senate Chair on a 16 to 0 to 0 vote. Emily DuBois was elected as Academic Affairs Committee Chair over James Gallicchio. The rest of the candidates, not having any competitors for their positions, were voted on as a collective slate consisting of Diana Crookston for the Finance Committee, Jeanie Xu for the Advocacy Committee, Prithu Pareek for the Business Affairs Committee, Victoria Liu for the Campus Life Committee, Saloni Gandhi for the Internal Development Committee, and Yoori Kim for the Communications Committee. The slate of candidates was elected 13 to 0 with 4 abstentions. In addition, Mason Xiao was elected as Sergeant-at-Arms, a role whose purpose is to conduct meetings by creating meeting slides and ordering meeting food.

On Thursday, April 29, Mayor Bill Peduto announced that Pittsburgh’s largest nonprofits plan to invest $115 million in his much-discussed OnePGH initiative. Among the commitments was $4 million over the span of five years from Carnegie Mellon, which would be directed towards programming for arts, entrepreneurship, and education as well as administration of the fund.
Large nonprofit institutions in Pittsburgh, like Carnegie Mellon, Highmark, the University of Pittsburgh, and UPMC, have come under criticism in Pittsburgh for their property tax exempt status despite relying on taxpayer-funded resources like road maintenance and police. WESA has estimated around 40 percent of land parcels in Pittsburgh are tax exempt, and city policy has sometimes tried to make up for lost revenue. In 2018, Peduto said that $1.6 billion of the $3 billion he wanted to accomplish the city’s goals would need to come from private or nonprofit sources.
Former Mayor Luke Ravenstahl sued UPMC to challenge their tax exempt status. Peduto dropped the lawsuit when he became mayor in 2014, opting instead to negotiate voluntary contributions from the city’s big nonprofits.
The OnePGH fund, a nonprofit run separately from the city, selects projects based on a bi-annual strategy approved by its board of directors. Peduto announced that, as of yet, no money from the city is going towards OnePGH, and none of OnePGH's funding is intended directly for the city government. OnePGH developed a 141-page prospectus to woo investors, with 12-year timelines of investments aimed at improving Pittsburgh’s resiliency.
The largest share of the $115 million was contributed by UPMC, which promised to invest $40 million in affordable housing in addition to separately funding a downtown homeless shelter and service center with Highmark and the PNC foundation. The University of Pittsburgh’s $8 million commitment over the next five years is planned to go towards community engagement centers, green infrastructure, and administration of OnePGH.
Mayoral candidate Ed Gainey called the commitments “$135M too little, 7 years too late,” criticizing both the timing of the announcement, less than three weeks before the Democratic primary for the mayoral election, and the scale of the plan. “If UPMC paid city and school district taxes, they’d owe our communities $40 million per year,” said Gainey.
One solution that cities have negotiated with large nonprofits is payments in lieu of taxes from nonprofit institutions which can be funneled directly to the city budget. Some critics of OnePGH argue that payments in lieu of taxes would be a more direct way of meeting the city’s needs with donations by giving control of funding to the city government instead of the nonprofit fund. Pittsburgh City Councilwoman Deb Gross, who endorsed Gainey in the election, gave a statement to PublicSource comparing the plan to a “shadow government.” Allegheny County Controller Chelsa Wagner told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in 2019 that “The OnePGH concept, to the extent that it has been defined at all, smacks of the outsourcing of government to elite, private interests.”
Peduto told reporters while discussing OnePGH at Carnegie Mellon in 2019 that OnePGH was a preferable alternative to payments in lieu of taxes because money could be directed towards the sustainability and resiliency goals outlined for Pittsburgh in the OnePGH plan instead of the city budget. “If we’re going to address the major issues facing the city over the next 12 years, we need to be able to do it in a way that is outside of the way it was done in the past,” said Peduto.
Pittsburgh City Councilperson Erika Strassburger wrote in an email to The Tartan, “As the Council Member representing part of the East End of Pittsburgh, I can say that many of the benefits the large non-profits bring to Pittsburgh are concentrated in the East End of the City, and I would like to change that.” Strassburger, who represents most of Carnegie Mellon’s campus, as well as parts of Oakland, Point Breeze, Shadyside, and Squirrel Hill, continued, “I think OnePGH starts to distribute the wealth more evenly across the city geographically, and in targeted ways.”
Strassburger, who has endorsed Peduto in the upcoming election, does find that “The best-case scenario would be for the large non-profits to pay property taxes,” but thinks that the city would first need action from the state legislature.
Gainey supports resuming a legal challenge to the nonprofit status of UPMC. Through a spokesperson, Gainey wrote in an email to The Tartan that as “the region's largest employer, largest landholder, and most profitable entity,” UPMC should fall into a different category than small community-based nonprofits and not qualify for tax exemption.
However, Gainey noted that “Universities like Pitt and CMU don't fall neatly into either category,” and would merit discussions of “the types of partnerships, including payments in lieu of taxes, are appropriate to ensure that those institutions are giving their fair share back to the community.”
In an emailed statement, Carnegie Mellon spokesperson Jason Maderer said, “Carnegie Mellon University has a long record of investing in and supporting our community and our region. We share the vision of a city where all of our neighbors have access to opportunity, quality education, clean and green spaces and infrastructure that supports a thriving community. CMU’s participation in the OnePGH partnership is a continuation of our commitment to achieving these goals.”
For some students, making payments in lieu of taxes is a necessary step for Carnegie Mellon in view of the university’s impact on Pittsburgh. Catherine Taipe, a junior who has written in favor of payments in lieu of taxes for The Tartan, wrote in an email to The Tartan that “It is outrageous to see OnePGH being treated as a victory by the Mayor's office when it is rarely the bare minimum.”
“Considering the controversies with the Mon-Oakland Connector and the 2016 Predictive Policing project from Metro21, CMU's impact on Pittsburgh is not entirely positive,” said Taipe. Taipe added, “[Payments in lieu of taxes] are the compromise to paying the millions in taxes the people of Pittsburgh deserve.”

It's been a ride.
With entirely virtual programming at The Tartan this past year, we’ve called Zoom and Slack our most reliable and ever-present friends. However, this wasn’t the case for everyone — many classes and many campus activities struggled to transition to an online presence, especially with regards to motivation and integrity.
The issues only got worse. From the wildfires on the West Coast and the unrest over Richard Grenell’s position at Carnegie Mellon to the rise in COVID-19 cases and the passing of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the school year was not off to a good start.
Election season only exacerbated the tensions and conflicts around the country, both in the real world and online. Conflicts peaked with the insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and continued as anti-AAPI hate crimes spread around the country.
Thankfully, the year wasn’t entirely pathetic and painful: we saw the distribution of vaccines grow to allow us to hopefully return to in-person instruction in the 2021-2022 school year. Accommodations in learning environments should be more accessible, as personal situations have become more understood and administrations have become more flexible.
However, there remains a lot of work to be done. Of particular interest and relevance to the Carnegie Mellon community is a review of Richard Grenell’s contribution (if any) to the academic explorations here. We have yet to also properly justify and address the shortening of the upcoming academic year.
And, last but not least, we must be particularly cautious when planning to return to a “normal” school environment next year. Students cannot take this lightly, and must remain proactive with pandemic measures, such as mask-wearing and social distancing.
We’re very thankful to have been able to share our thoughts and contribute to the campus discussion this past year and are excited to resume our work in the next school year. Furthermore, the prospect of returning campus traditions — such as Carnival and Booth — is something we are all looking forward to.
Thank you for staying connected with us as we share with you our thoughts, ideas, and interests. Stay safe, and best wishes on your finals! See you next year!

Facebook’s Oversight Board has upheld its decision to bar former President Donald Trump from using its platform on Wednesday, May 9, 2021. This decision was to reaffirm the ban Facebook placed on Trump after his allegedly incendiary posts about the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol insurrection.
This is completely unacceptable. A private company should not have the power to silence anyone from having a voice. A decision to silence someone is not to be made in a meeting room in a corporate office. If corporations can silence people on demand, especially prominent figures who have a large following, then the future of the world is in the hands of social media companies. Since governments cannot directly influence private companies, social media companies would have unrestrained power on the world without checks and balances.
A counter argument can be made with regards to the terms and conditions of the social media companies. It can be said that what Trump posted, especially around Jan. 6, has caused violence, which violates the terms and conditions of Facebook. While that is completely valid, a similar argument can be made about the Black Lives Matter protests that turned into riots and caused looting of stores, which under Facebook’s terms and conditions should also have resulted in the removal of the accounts that incited the protests and riots. However, I have not heard of significant social media account removals tied to the Black Lives Matter riots, which is a clear indication of Facebook’s bias and selective enforcement of its terms and conditions. It should be made clear that I support Black Lives Matter, but not the riots that come as part of the movement.
Silencing Trump, or anyone on any side of the political spectrum, is inherently a bad idea for the country. This is evident in the rise of supposedly “free speech” social media platforms such as Parler and Gab as a result of crackdowns by Twitter and Facebook on right-leaning content and platforms. Parler and Gab are social networks that are currently dominated by right-wing leaders, and several conservative leaders have accounts there, such as Ted Cruz and Eric Trump. These platforms would not have risen to their popularity today if not for Twitter and Facebook’s attempts to direct the narrative away from conservative voices. This can all be summarized in a Chinese Chengyu “物极必反/物極必反,” which means when things develop to an extreme, it will suddenly turn to the other direction. This is exactly what is happening with Twitter and Facebook’s efforts to silence the Right, as when the Right feel they are being silenced, they will move somewhere else where they can flourish.
With the rise of right-wing media and social networks, the internet is divided into two sections, one occupied by mainstream social networks which are perceived as leftist by conservatives, and one occupied by the conservatives where conservatives can speak freely among themselves. This means that everyone stays in their own bubble and does not listen to what the other side has to say, and this phenomenon is increasingly spilling from the online world to the physical world, as seen in the role that Parler played in organizing the Jan. 6 insurrection; protesters used Parler as one of their platforms to organize the insurrection. 
Take Erie, Pennsylvania, one of the most politically divided towns in the United States. Tons of money was poured into the town before the 2020 election, and this has led everyone to retreat into their political corners even more than before. This means that people are scared to state their beliefs publicly out of fear of violence and have lost customers. I also have several friends from other universities that are Trump supporters, and they fear publicly stating their beliefs. Even wearing red hats is risky for sports fans who do not want to be confused with Trump supporters.
I genuinely fear the United States going into a civil war within the next 30 years as a spillover of the current virtual divide into the real world continues. When Democrats cannot be friends with Republicans, we have a serious problem at hand.
What mainstream social media can do is not control the narrative and instead let the narrative happen by itself. This way, opposing sides can hear each other in earnest without interruptions, and this is the only way the country can walk out of this extreme divide. And that starts by unbanning Trump, a prominent conservative, and letting him have a platform to preach his ideas. This may be dangerous, as seen by the Capitol insurrection, but the alternative is likely more dangerous because the extreme divide that is happening right now is not going to go away by itself. We are faced with two bad options, so we have to choose the lesser evil.
