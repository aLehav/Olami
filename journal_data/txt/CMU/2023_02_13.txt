Men’s Basketball
The Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team hosted the 24th-ranked Emory Eagles this past Friday, Feb. 10. 
The first half was a back-and-forth between the Tartans and Eagles, with a total of six lead changes and four ties. A 10-3 run by the Tartans in a two-minute and 23-second span gave the Tartans a 33-32 lead that they kept until Emory tied it up with 31 seconds left in the first half. The second half was much the same story: there were six lead changes and one tie. Though the Eagles started the second half with a 6-0 run, the Tartans regained the lead thanks to a three-pointer from senior Nick Nakasian, which put the team up 48-47. 
The struggle between the teams continued until late into the second half. With 57 seconds left in play, Carnegie Mellon trailed Emory by one. However, a two-pointer from junior R.J. Holmes and two free throws from junior Jack Stone gave the Tartans a three-point lead that the Tartans kept for the rest of the game. As the clock hit zero, the score showed 63-60 in favor of Carnegie Mellon. 
Looking to keep their win streak at home alive, the Tartans hosted the University of Rochester on Sunday, Feb. 12. 
Much like their previous game, the Tartans started out in a back-and-forth fashion; the lead changed five times in the first 14 minutes of play. With 5:56 left, senior Josh Berry completed a layup and gave the Tartans a 28-27 advantage. However, these would be the last points of the half for The Tartans. The Yellowjackets went on a 15-0 run to close the half, making it 42-28 to close the half. 
Rochester continued their run into the second half, scoring seven to the Tartan’s two. However, Carnegie Mellon started to stage a comeback. In the next six minutes, the Tartans went 13-5. With 4:24 left in play, the scoreboard read 74-64. But with less than a minute remaining, the Tartans were able to close the gap to just three points, 74-71. However, a series of fouls on both sides at the end resulted in a final score of 82-78 in favor of Rochester. 
These two games have moved the Tartans to 15-7 for the season and 7-4 in conference play. For their next game, the team will be traveling to the University of Chicago on Friday, Feb. 17 for a 7:30 p.m. CT tipoff.
Women’s Basketball
On Friday, Feb. 10, the women’s basketball team hosted the Emory Eagles in Wiegand Gymnasium.  
After the first two minutes of play, the Tartans had a promising 9-2 lead over the Eagles. This lead widened to 14 points with 2:11 left to go in the quarter. However, the Eagles were able to regain a little bit of ground, and by the end of the quarter, the scoreboard read 22-11 Tartans. The Tartans continued their strong play into the second quarter, but did let up a little. They scored 14 to Emory’s 16, making it 36-27 at the break. 
However, the Eagles started to stage their comeback in the second half when they opened with a 9-2 run, which then ran into a 16-6 run. This gave Emory the lead, 43-42, with 3:32 left to go in the third quarter. With the Tartans only scoring 10 in the third quarter, they were now behind, 51-46. In the fourth quarter, the Eagles widened their lead to double-digits, but the Tartans managed to bring it back to six points. However, the Eagles finished the game 11 ahead of the Tartans, 70-59.
On Sunday, Feb. 12, the women’s basketball team hosted 25th-ranked University of Rochester in Wiegand Gymnasium.
The Yellowjackets took an early 8-0 lead over the Tartans, which caused an early Tartan timeout. Though the Tartans would be behind by 10 twice in the first quarter, the Tartans would be behind 19-11 the first time the clock hit zero. The second quarter was much of the same; the Tartans were unable to get an edge on the Yellowjackets and finished the half behind, 35-23.
The second half was a slightly different story for the Tartans. In the third quarter, they were able to hold their own, scoring 19 to Rochester’s 20. In the fourth quarter, however, the Tartans were able to recover some lost ground, but it wasn’t enough. With just over 2 minutes left in the game, the Tartans began an 8-0 run that ended with 48 seconds to go. As the Yellowjackets let the clock run out, the scoreboard read 68-60 in favor of the visitors.  
With these two losses, the women’s basketball team is now 11-11 overall and 2-9 in conference play. They will next be facing the University of Chicago on Friday, Feb. 17 when they travel to the Windy City for a 5:30 CT tipoff. 
Men’s Track and Field
This past Saturday, members of the Carnegie Mellon men’s track and field team traveled to the Joe LaRocco Invitational in Salem, Va., hosted by Roanoke College. Members of the team also traveled to the Boston University David Hemery Valentine Invitational over the weekend. 
At Boston University, a number of Tartans found success in their events. In the distance medley relay, the team of sophomore Eamon Brady, junior Andrew McGovern, junior Alex Invanov, and sophomore Colin McLaughlin set the school record with a time of 9:53.95. McGoven also individually claimed a school record in the 800-meter run when he crossed the finish line in 1:51.08. Additionally, McLaughlin claimed his own school record when he bested his previous record in the 3,000-meter race with a time of 8:15.35. Senior Elijah Sech and Brady also competed in the 3,00-meter race, where they finished with times of 8:17.91 and 8:32.96, respectively. Senior Alex Halkias also competed and got a personal-best indoor time of 22.29 in the 200-meter dash. 
Like those at Boston, Tartans in Virginia also took spots on the podium in their events. In the 60-meter hurdles, junior Thomas Rich broke his previous record with a time of 8.34, which gave him the win. Behind him, sophomore Mich Nowlin finished fourth with a time of 8.89. In the mile, junior Jacob Hsu claimed first with a time of 4:24.30. Junior Charlie Murphy took first for the Tartans in the 3,000-meter run with a time of 8:57.79. First-year Gaven Williams took fifth in the 400-meter race with a 52.17. 
On the field, sophomore Cody Breidenbach won the weight throw with a mark of 18.61 meters, while senior Bailey O’Malley placed fourth with a mark of 15.19 meters. O’Malley, however, took first in the shot put with a throw of 15.24 meters while Breidenbach took sixth with a throw of 13.77 meters. Sophomore Ethan Higgs took second in the high jump, clearing 1.88 meters, which Rich took fifth with a height of 1.83 meters. In the triple jump, sophomore Sebastian Sanso took fourth with a leap of 13.06 meters while first-year Morgan Johnson placed just behind with a jump of 13.03 meters. In pole vault, first-year Christian Duckworth placed second when he cleared 4.35 meters while fellow first-year Harrison Hayward cleared 4.05 meters, placing fourth. 
The team’s results at the Joe LaRocco Invitational earned them first out of ten teams with a total of 123.5 points. The team will next be competing at the Penn State Tune Up on Friday, Feb. 17 and the Mount Union Tune Up on Saturday, Feb. 18. 
Women’s Track and Field

Penguins' goalie Tristan Jarry has had a rough month. On Jan. 2, Jarry had to leave the much-anticipated Winter Classic just 15 minutes into the game due to a lower body injury that kept him on injured reserve for nearly three weeks. He could finally return on Jan. 20, but after playing just two games, Jarry was once again out of the lineup due to a brand new, unrelated upper body injury. Over both of these stretches, the Penguins have called up Dustin Tokarski from the AHL, but Casey deSmith has remained the starting goalie for the majority of games. While I’m not saying that deSmith sucks, I am saying that the Penguins are 9-11-4 while he’s on the ice. Neither he nor Tokarski (with a record of just 1-1-0) can compare to Tristan Jarry’s 16-5-5. You'll understand why I’m anxious for Jarry to be back. 
Just as strong as my wish for the Penguins to win, I'd love to see Jarry remain with the Penguins for a while longer. Unfortunately, he might not be able to show that he's worth another contract if he can't get back out on the ice and prove that he can keep the pucks out, and keep himself in. Jarry is one of the main reasons I started actually watching hockey — I remember listening to one of my first ever games and the announcers were just losing their minds over Jarry’s stops. I remember going to see the Pens play in person for the first time and losing my own mind over his saves! If you scroll back in my Twitter, you will find a tweet in which I call Tristan Jarry my hero. If the Pens don't renew Jarry's contract, he'll be a unrestricted free agent at the end of this season. I have to say, if Jarry moves teams, he'll be taking a little piece of my loyalty to the Pens with him. This one's for you, Ron Hextall: You better keep this guy around.
Earlier this week, the Penguins announced that Jarry would be going back on injured reserve, retroactive to Jan. 22. While this means he can still come back any time, there have been no hints as to when Jarry might return. However, he was seen practicing with the team as recently as Thursday, and was well enough to accompany the team on their three-game California road trip this weekend.

Yesterday, while sitting in The Underground, I had the dubious pleasure of watching the 76ers play the Nets. It was a close game, with the Nets holding a slim lead, one that had initially been much larger. The 76ers were shaving it away though, point by point. There was still hope for both teams. Five minutes. Then one. Then seconds. The 76ers took the lead, and the Nets needed a three-pointer to tie.
Oh, the tragedy of supporting New York sports teams. Across almost every sport, there is a curse on teams from the Empire State. This week, the Brooklyn Nets joined their sister teams in racing to the bottom. After building a phenomenal team based around superstar Kevin Durant, top-tier point guard Kyrie Irving, and 2016 first-round pick Ben Simmons, it was supposed to be a team capable of keeping the Nets in the postseason contention year on year, and maybe bring in a ring or two. After relocating from Jersey, and consistent one-and-done playoff heartbreaks, this was supposed to be the Nets’ big year, or at least, the start of a new dynasty. The Nets had commenced a great experiment, throwing their faith into their three big players.
Of course, this is Foul Play, and no joy escapes this column. After signing Durant and Irving in 2019, neither player had much playing time in the 19-20 season, with both sitting out due to injury. Year one of this new duo, a seventh seed and a one-and-done sweep in the postseason.
Year two was impressive. Irving put up a 50-40-90 season, becoming the fourth to do so while also averaging over 25 points per game (PPG). And yes, Durant was one of those other 50-40-90/25 PPG players. It should have been a match made in heaven. The production kept up as the Nets clinched the second seed, blew the Celtics out in five games, and were on the precipice of greatness.
And then in the second round, Irving got injured and the Nets lost in seven. The most promising season, destroyed by injury, a story that haunts even the best of teams. What if Irving hadn’t gotten injured? What if the Nets had won even one game more against the Bucks?
Durant started fishing for trades in the 22-23 season. Irving started becoming a controversial media piece, and the team that had seemed poised for greatness appeared to be falling apart. But even with the rumors swirling, the Nets managed to hold on to the 5th seed. And then, Durant called off the trade request, opting to stick with the Nets. Sure, Irving was back in the news, but they’re playing basketball. They’re winning games. This is their year. The great Nets experiment played on.
With less than a second left, the ball was tossed back in play. They needed a three to tie, and the ball was tossed far from the three-point line. At half court, a Nets player grabbed it, took a breath, and threw the ball.
And it went in. The crowd started screaming, and for a moment, I wanted to start screaming too. In The Underground. At like, 8 p.m. This was the sort of storybook ending to games you wanted to see. The Nets had forced a game to overtime on a last-second buzzer beater.
The Nets called it quits on the experiment this week. Kyrie Irving was traded to the Dallas Mavericks for a handful of players, and some seventh-graders. I mean, draft picks. For 2029. Don’t you just love the NBA?
It was okay, though. They still had Durant, Ben Simmons, and now, Spencer Dinwiddle. It wasn’t a superstar lineup, but it was still pretty good.
No. No stop what you’re doing. That’s called “optimism” and this is basketball, and when teams start going down, they go down hard. So, as everyone (who had a few too many drinks) expected, the Nets traded their big man to the Phoenix Suns, for a couple of players to keep them afloat, and a huge number of picks. And yep, some seventh graders got traded too, because why don’t we start thinking about basketball players who are still learning algebra. The Nets were giving up, and they were back on the rebuild. They had two handfuls of picks, a serviceable team, and the 5th seed. They have a shot at making things work.
My heart was pounding, seeing the Nets cheering. Dinwiddle looked perfect, and ESPN kept playing the instant replay.
Then, my heart dropped. I looked at the refs, huddling around the replay booth. I watched the replay again, and again, and again, and then I realized something.
Dinwiddle was still touching the ball when the clock hit 0.0. That incredible shot, that perfect basket to tie it all up, wasn’t valid.
A few moments later, the refs said the same. The call was overturned. The game was over. No overtime. No chance to turn it around. The Nets had taken a 12-point lead at one time and had lost it. They’d stayed above water, only to get dragged down by the 76ers. And in the last seconds of a close game, they had their tying shot ripped away from them. Their hope was gone. It was a poetic representation of their last few years. Perhaps the most accurate depiction of being a New York sports fan.

Welp, it’s that time of year again. Superbowl Sunday, one of the biggest sporting events of the year. Of the top 32 broadcasts in American history, 30 of them are various Super Bowls. The other two? The finale of M*A*S*H and the 2016 Presidential Debates. Obviously the American public has its priorities straight. Personally, I tune in whenever my Giants are doing well, but I haven’t had much cause for celebration recently.
This year promises to be a pretty insane matchup, between the 16-3 Philadelphia Eagles and the 16-3 Kansas City Chiefs. 
The Kansas City Chiefs
Since picking up Patrick “Kermit” Mahomes from Texas Tech with the 10th overall pick of the 2017 NFL draft, the Chiefs have been perennial contenders. They’ve been to the AFC championship in ‘18, ‘19, ‘20, ‘21, and now ‘22, and won the whole kit and caboodle in 2019. They also get stomped on by an old man and a bunch of retirees in 2020, but we try not to talk about that out in Kansas City. They have the number one ranked offense in the country, racking up a ludicrous 29.2 points per game this season, thanks to the fast food blood sacrifice Andy Reid made. Their homegrown defense ranks ninth in the country. On top of their rankings, the Chiefs have accumulated 546 total points this season, and had secured the number one seed in the AFC prior to the postseason. Pat “I'm actually a running back too”  Mahomes has won MVP this season, his second in five years. If Kansas City wins, it’ll be the first time people pay attention to Kansas since The Wizard of Oz, even if KC isn’t even in the state.
The Philadelphia Eagles
The Eagles have had a much more tumultuous few years. After winning it all in 2017, against Brady no less, in a game that got Eagles quarterback Nick Foles immortalized with a statue, the Eagles just… didn’t do great for the next four years. After going 13-3 in their run, the Eagles failed to break 10 wins until this year, even going 4-11 in one year. It’s been a rocky journey for the franchise. But that win in 2017 was their first, ever, and now, Jalen “Get ready for a world of”  Hurts, a young QB out of Alabama and Oklahoma, has dragged his team into the big game again. The Eagles scored 28.1 points per game in the 2022 regular season, and combined that with two blowout wins in the postseason against the Giants (RIP) and the Vikings (skoL). In what is definite and perfect proof that the NFL is rigged and the Eagles are paying them off. There are two Es in EaglEs and RogEr GoodEll.
Coincidence? I think not. Meanwhile, in Philadelphia, the city is busy smothering the poles with grease to stop the city members from climbing up anything vertical like a drunk man at a strip club. Don’t worry, regardless of whether Philly wins or loses, something is getting burned down.
Predictions, Prayers, and Pain
Well, I hate the Eagles. As a rabid Giants fan, I’m praying we start World War III moments before this game kicks off. And as a resident of Tucson, Arizona, I’d like to offer up Phoenix as the first city to be hit by the nuclear blast. But if I have to put money on someone winning, it’s the Chiefs. I don’t know what’s in Andy Reid’s burgers, but it’s made him a football genius, and if I was Nick Sirianni, I’d be scared of coaching against him. Mahomes is somehow able to make plays on a bad ankle, a bad foot, a bad arm. Hell, at this point, I don’t think he’s human, but apparently there’s nothing in the rulebook stopping a mutant from playing football. Mark my words, we’re gonna find out in 10 years that Mahomes was from the planet Zircon or something.
Either way, I don’t really know if the Eagles defense can take over this game like they usually do. I’ve seen them play great, but I think if Mahomes can get cooking, he’s gonna bake them into a pie before they know it. Or something, I’m not great with cooking metaphors. Even if the Eagles jump out to an early game lead, the Chiefs are known for pulling off comebacks. Somehow the worst place to be when playing an NFL game is up 10 against the Killer City Chiefs. 
Final Predictions
Kansas City Chiefs 31, Eagles 28. One of the two Kelce Brothers changes his name and moves to Thailand with Kliff Kingsbury. Hassan Reddick somehow tackles a USAF jet during the flyby. Philadelphia starts building all its houses on 10 foot poles, and the Chiefs finally turn Kansas and Missouri into one big state.

In November 2022, Dr. Anna Smajdor, a professor at the University of Oslo, published an article in “Theoretical Medicine and Bioethics” entitled “Whole Body Gestational Donation.” Whole Body Gestational Donation (WBGD) is a proposed form of organ donation that involves the use of the entire human body to bear a child, something commonly referred to as surrogacy. The difference between surrogacy and WBGD, as Smadjor coins it, is the same as between donating a kidney while alive and having “Organ Donor” on your driver’s license. The implication here is that the person volunteering a WBGD will be completely unconscious when the donation occurs. The donated organ can still be used — which in the case of pregnancy is solely possible if the only part of the person’s body that is “dead” is their brain. In this situation, the body is still well and functioning enough to support new life, but the person has no awareness of the pregnancy and cannot control any bodily functions.
This is why, following the release of Dr. Smajdor’s paper, headlines — which alarmingly came from very few, mostly-non-news sources — framed her paper as, “Brain-dead women should be kept alive and used as surrogates, professor suggests.” I chose very intentionally not to start this article with that kind of language, because I think it misrepresents the argument made and confuses the ethical issue at stake. 
The concept of WBGD was not created by Dr. Smajdor. In fact, her paper is an expansion on a concept introduced in 2000 by Rosalie Ber, medical faculty at the Israel Institute of Technology. Ber’s publication, “Ethical Issues in Gestational Surrogacy,” was published in the same journal and discusses the ethics of surrogacy in general, specifically with regards to the social and biological designations of motherhood. I would find many hard-pressed to find moral issue with normal surrogacy, which is a regular part of reproductive dialogue nowadays. Similarly, it would be difficult for anyone to condemn regular organ donation as designated on drivers’ licenses, which is actually often considered to be the morally right thing to do. If you’re not using your organs anymore, why should you stop anyone else from using them, especially if it could save someone’s life? It is actually completely logical for Ber and Smajdor to have come to the conclusion that they did, which, simply stated, is that the womb is an organ like any other. And if someone fully and legally consents to their body being used to deliver a child, what other problem exists?
If you’re asking yourself, “Does this even work?” the answer is yes. Ber cites numerous examples of brain-dead women being victims of rape and carrying babies to term. There is also an example of a woman in a healthy, voluntary pregnancy who suffered a brain-fatal hemorrhage and carried her prehancy to term with no harm done to the fetus. In cases like these, there was no established directive to guide physicians and family members, and in most cases the other biological parent made the decision of whether or not to keep the mother alive for the sake of the baby. Some chose not to.
The issue faced, it seems, is one of women’s historical loss of power over their bodies. The implication that people with female reproductive organs could be used simply as vessels for new life is troubling, especially in the context of lessening reproductive rights in the past few years. Smajdor attempts to diffuse what she calls “potential feminist objections” by proposing that this type of donation would be possible for men as well. While this is biologically accurate and possible via implantation in another organ like the liver, as Smajdor acknowledges, it is so risky that it is almost considered fatal. Smajdor asserts that this is irrelevant because the donor is already dead, so it doesn’t matter if their body also dies in the course of donation, but I think that this is maybe where we begin to draw the line.
The question I ask now, beyond “Is this right?” is, “Why would this ever be necessary?” The population of Earth just increased to eight billion. There is no reason to be concerned about whether the very few eligible brain-dead people would consent to carrying babies. Smajdor even elaborates on the varying states of brain death and their relation to this donation concept — and for what? It may be a worthwhile addendum to a living will or advanced directive — for example, “If I am pregnant and suddenly become brain-dead, I wish for my pregnancy to be carried to term if possible.” 
Outside of this, there is really no need to create the potential for those who wish to capitalize on women's bodies to do so any further, especially since normal, living surrogacy is not extremely difficult to come by. The concept of purposely impregnating and possibly killing brain-dead patients solely for the purpose of creating new life is, at the very least, alarming and divinatory of certainly unethical developments.

Imagine a currency that matches the value of a regular, physical dollar in the United States but can be accessed through the internet. Citizens in countries with rapid inflation can purchase said currency and avoid losing their buying power day by day. People in areas with high crime rates or limited access to banks need secure alternatives to store money. Now, they can safeguard their assets digitally wherever they are.
MakerDAO, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), is a service that brings financial tools to the Ethereum blockchain. In operation since 2017, MakerDAO currently holds over six billion dollars worth of crypto, making it one of the largest protocols in the decentralized finance (DeFi) market. MakerDAO’s services include a stable cryptocurrency and the ability to earn interest on or borrow crypto.
In 2017, there was no way to convert cryptocurrencies into a U.S. dollar equivalent without moving funds off the blockchain. MakerDAO looked to fill gaps in the DeFi space and pair traditional financial services with the benefits of blockchain technology. 
Thus, MakerDAO created DAI, a stable cryptocurrency whose value is always worth one U.S. dollar.  If someone wanted to hold their assets on-chain without being exposed to the price fluctuations of crypto, they could simply convert their crypto into DAI. Users of MakerDAO can earn interest on their DAI if they deposit it into the protocol savings account. They can also borrow DAI by depositing crypto collateral such as Bitcoin or Ether. At any time, users can withdraw their DAI from the savings account or their collateral from the protocol as long as they repay the DAI they borrowed. 
DAI deviating from a 1:1 ratio with the U.S. dollar renders all of MakerDAO’s services useless. So MakerDAO closely monitors and maintains the ratio using over-collateralization and incentives. 
If someone deposited $20K in Bitcoin into the protocol and borrowed $10K in DAI, they have an overcollateralized position. But if the deposited value of Bitcoin later fell to $5K, the position would be undercollateralized, and only $5K worth of crypto would be backing the $10K in DAI lent out, destroying the ratio. The minimum collateralization ratio (Crypto Collateral Value divided by DAI Loan Value) prevents the value of the collateral deposited from being less than the DAI lent out. So, in the previous example, as the position's Bitcoin value decreased, the minimum collateralization ratio would trigger MakerDAO to sell the crypto collateral even before it reached $10K to ensure proper collateral backing. 
To further illustrate this idea, imagine a sink. Water runs through the tap and into the drain. If the drain is plugged, water starts to fill. However, the sink will never overflow because of the hole below the sink's rim that drains excess water. In the same sense, the minimum collateralization ratio is the hole that prevents the water from overfilling, the collateral is the size of the sink, and the debt value is the water. The minimum collateralization ratio prevents the debt of DAI from exceeding the value of the collateral backing the DAI. 
MakerDAO also uses monetary incentives to control DAI's value. MakerDAO has two proprietary tokens: DAI and MKR. DAI is always worth one dollar, whereas MKR fluctuates in value. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, MKR is a governance token for MakerDAO. DAOs sometimes issue governance tokens just as companies issue shares. And just as shareholders can vote on issues concerning their company, governance token holders can vote on changes to a protocol. If someone suggests adding MakerDAO’s offerings to Arbitrum, another blockchain network, MKR holders can vote for or against that proposal. Introducing the protocol to another blockchain network might increase total revenue, but MKR holders must consider factors like implementation costs and possible security risks. 
In general, MKR holders vote to increase or decrease variables that would keep DAI at one dollar since the price of DAI is a function of supply and demand. Less DAI on the open market increases scarcity, pushing the price up. More DAI on the open market increases the quantity, decreasing its price. Changing the borrowing fee or total amount of DAI borrowable are a few ways MKR holders can influence the price of DAI. A higher borrowing fee discourages users from borrowing DAI, decreasing the demand and price. A lower total loanable DAI amount decreases the overall quantity available, thus increasing the price. 
Essentially, MakerDAO — including its profitability and stability — is MKR holders' responsibility. Good decisions reward MKR holders with a more valuable token, but bad decisions punish them by diluting the value of their MKR tokens. The goal of MKR holders is to keep DAI at the one dollar target price and keep MakerDAO profitable. If MKR holders vote for changes that create a surplus in the MakerDAO treasury, the protocol will use the surplus to buy MKR tokens off the market and destroy them. 
To ground the idea, consider a coveted car manufacturer producing five supercars each worth a considerable amount. If the car manufacturer bought back one supercar and destroyed it, the value of the other four supercars would increase. In this sense, MakerDAO is the manufacturer of MKR and will buy back and destroy MKR tokens using treasury surplus to make other MKR holders’ tokens more valuable. Alternatively, if MKR holders create changes that lower DAI’s value below one dollar, the protocol will mint and sell MKR tokens to buy back and destroy DAI. By creating more MKR tokens, each individual MKR token becomes less valuable. The protocol uses the proceeds from the MKR token sale to purchase DAI. Just as the car manufacturer can buy and destroy their supercars, so too can the protocol buy back and destroy DAI. By destroying DAI, the amount of DAI available decreases, making each individual DAI more valuable. This process is done until DAI regains its one dollar target value. 
MakerDAO markets the stable crypto DAI as having three use cases on their website: earn, borrow, and multiply. Earning is done through the DAI savings account and can function as an on-chain version of a bank’s savings account. Borrowing is generating DAI from over-collateralized loans. By borrowing DAI against their crypto, users can take out loans against unrealized gains. In doing so, users can access their money without selling their crypto and triggering the taxable event. The multiply option is similar to borrowing but uses the DAI generated to automatically purchase more collateral. If someone deposited $20K worth of Bitcoin and borrowed $10K DAI, they could convert that DAI into Bitcoin and deposit the new Bitcoin as collateral, making their total collateral $30K worth of Bitcoin. Because each loan amount has to be less than the collateral value, eventually, no more substantial DAI could be created and deposited. Now, a user has $30K exposure to Bitcoin rather than the original $20K, hence the tool’s name, “multiply.” Multiply is a good way to automatically increase the exposure to an asset without having to deposit new money into the protocol or convert borrowed DAI collateral manually. 
To provide the savings interest rate and pay developers and contributors, MakerDAO must generate revenue. Users borrowing DAI pay a fee to MakerDAO. Additionally, when a user falls under the minimum collateralization ratio, the protocol takes a percentage of the collateral sold. 
One of the most important factors that determine the safety of protocols in DeFi is standing the test of time. MakerDAO is one of the oldest and largest DeFi protocols to exist, and it has survived many market shocks. Large firms such as Andreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital, Dragonfly Capital, and Paradigm have invested over $50 million cumulatively in MKR tokens and actively participate in MakerDAO’s governance. With such big money in the game, MakerDAO has contracted audits by security organizations in the blockchain space and third-party auditors. In the event of long-term market irrationality, hacks, or security breaches, MKR holders can also vote to trigger an emergency shutdown. The Maker Protocol will stop, and users can withdraw their collateral, and DAI users can redeem DAI for collateral. 
Uncertainty plagues the future of all blockchain projects. Cryptocurrency and decentralized financial regulation remain unfinished. And it’s hard to predict what legislation federal agencies will produce. Still, MakerDAO has distinguished itself as a cornerstone in DeFi, offering simple financial tools that function in any market condition.

Robot FRIDA paints with artificial intelligence
While DALL-E and AI-generated art technology is widely available, it's difficult to translate this digital technology into physical technology. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon's Robotics Institute hope to change this with FRIDA, a robotic arm taped with a paintbrush. Like online AI-art generators, it can accept text prompts and files of other artworks for inspiration, but the researchers have also experimented with audio input as well. To create the physical piece, however, FRIDA first learns how to use its paintbrush. Then, FRIDA generates a digital piece using models similar to DALL-E and simulates how it would paint the artwork with brushstrokes. FRIDA then starts to paint, and compares the brushstrokes it produces to the simulation, adjusting the simulation accordingly. After hours, FRIDA produces a painting. The researchers emphasize that FRIDA is not an artist, but rather hopes to help humans express themselves artistically through technology.
Recognizing objects not by visuals, but by motion
Have you ever recognized someone not by the way they look, but the way they walk? Carnegie Mellon researchers in the Department of Psychology collaborated with the National Institute of Mental Health to investigate how humans use motion cues on top of visual cues to understand the world around us. In their study published in "The Journal of Neuroscience," they created a set of animations that replicated the movement of an object or animal, but didn't contain the image, shape, or colors of the original object/animal. After presenting the videos to 430 participants, they found that participants accurately identified the objects 76 percent of the time. Then, to identify which parts of the brain were involved in identifying motion cues, they scanned the brains of 15 other participants while they viewed the six most highly recognized object videos and their corresponding static images with the object in picture. They hope that their findings can assist in health care, to help clinicians study populations with difficulty in social perception, and in artificial intelligence, to help artificial intelligence see the world the way humans do.

In a paper published this past month in “Journal of the American Chemical Society,” scientists named new antimicrobial particles “Keanumycins” after actor Keanu Reeves since they “are so efficient at killing different microbial species” and Reeves “played many iconic killers in his cinematic career.”
One important discovery highlighted by the paper was the antimicrobial called “Keanumycin A,” which is extremely effective at inhibiting the fungus known as gray mold in over 1,000 plant species. In an international survey of fungal pathologists, gray mold was voted second in scientific and economic importance due to the damage the fungus causes.
But what exactly is an antimicrobial? Antimicrobials are the class of medicines that are used to prevent and treat infections that include antibiotics and antivirals. 
Antimicrobial resistance is a growing concern, however. Bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites will change over time in response to antimicrobials, which in turn makes infections harder to treat. As such, antimicrobials become ineffective and infections become harder or impossible to treat.
“Many human-pathogenic fungi are now resistant to antimycotics (antifungals) — partly because they are used in large quantities in agricultural fields,” study co-author Sebastian Götze said in a statement.
As such, antimicrobial development has been decreasing since it was deemed unprofitable. Most antibiotics are natural products or come from some sort of natural product, and the cost of discovering new natural product-based structures has increased significantly. As such, most pharmaceutical companies have abandoned this field of research.
The group of researchers, including those from Leibniz Institute for Natural Product Research and Infection Biology in Germany, said that these antimicrobials can be an “environmentally friendly alternative” to the traditional chemical pesticides. The Keanumycins have been tested against gray mold rot on hydrangea leaves, where it was found to be highly effective. Since these Keanumycins have not been used before, they may advance the fight against drug-resistant fungi. 
Researchers extracted these “killer” compounds from bacteria from the genus Pseudomonas. Members of this genus are “very toxic” to amoeba that feed on bacteria, so they are good candidates for being antimicrobials. Scientists have labeled three different Keanumycins as “A,” “B,” and “C.”
While Keanumycins are effective against plant fungi, they also appear to “strongly inhibit” the human pathogenic fungus Candida albicans. While C. albicans doesn’t harm humans, it's important to know that these antimicrobials work against human infections as well.
These latest developments are an important step for scientists to develop new antimicrobials that can fight drug-resistant infections.

Last Thursday, the Carnegie Mellon University Flea Market last Thursday brought student and local vendors to Simmons Auditorium. The event was organized by a team of eight students as a curricular project for Introduction to Entrepreneurship.
Carnegie Mellon students sold clothes and jewelry, and there was a succulent table with miniature potted plants. Table games offered a chance for students with Cup Pong skills to win plush toys and other prizes. Local businesses took part in the market as well, including the cat lounge Rescue and Relax, an Edgewood-based nonprofit offering cat fostering and adoption.
The inspiration for the event was an attempt to find a creative way to bring in the most money, competing with other groups also testing out entrepreneurial ideas for their business development class. The team wanted to do something different, outside the box of the usual bake sale, said student Brian Hsu. Where the money goes is largely at the students’ discretion, with the requirement of donating at least ten percent of the profits.
Students' responses were positive and excited, Hsu said. Beyond just a class project, Hsu says the Market would make a great annual or semiannual opportunity for students to get together and ply their wares.

It’s already that time of year again. Target is selling overpriced chocolate and Giant Eagle is selling wilted roses. On your walk to class, it seems there’s more PDA than ever. That’s right, it’s the season of love. Gross. Except… you can’t ignore that little voice in your head when you see the cutest couple ever walking down The Cut, whispering, “God, I wish that were me.” 
Despite all your efforts in the past, Cupid has somehow managed to miss you completely. Even though it may seem like you’re hurtling straight toward a post-graduation future of microwave dinners alone, I’m here to reignite your passion for love and impart some wisdom. Behold, the best and only how-to guide to dating on campus you’ll ever need!
The first step to a successful love life is to be mysterious. People are attracted to what they don’t know. One way to achieve this aura of mystique is to keep eye contact at a minimum. Eyes are the windows to your soul, and you don’t want to scare away any potential suitors by being too earnest from the beginning. So, next time you’re at La Prima, sipping your coffee, take care to aggressively ignore anyone that tries to meet your gaze. 
If this precaution somehow fails, and you find yourself engaged in conversation with someone you’re attracted to, TREAD LIGHTLY. A conversation is a pivotal moment for many reasons, like establishing first impressions. One rule of thumb which has always worked for me is to let your interlocutor do most of the speaking. People love to talk about themselves, so, let them! While I know you’re probably dying to learn everything about your new companion, try to limit follow-up questions. You don’t want to leave the impression that you’re nosey. Besides, this tactic prevents you from being a blabbermouth and talking about off-limit topics, like your hobbies and favorite color. An added bonus is that it keeps you mysterious! 
Okay, now, say you’ve managed to hook your potential paramour with riveting colloquy. What comes next? To keep the thought of you fresh in their mind, you must establish your presence in some way. A tried-and-true method is not just to be yourself, but to also smell like yourself. Studies have shown that people are most attracted to others’ natural scents. So, next time you’re thinking about showering before seeing someone of interest, don’t, and let that musk marinate instead! Another good method of establishing your presence is to subtly show off how smart you are. Let’s put it into practice: The next time you attend lecture, ask a million questions only you will understand and the professor will have a hard time answering. This is one of the most effective ways to distinguish yourself from the crowd. And if someone confesses to having failed the most recent midterm, don’t hesitate to tell them how high you scored. Remember, intelligence is attractive!
College is a hectic time full of changes for most, so make life easier and be consistent for the future loved ones in your life. For example, wearing the same outfit every day is a good way to keep yourself recognizable. However, you want to be careful of potentially coming off as a peacock — nobody likes an attention seeker! One way to avoid this faux pas is to keep it simple; the t-shirt you received during Orientation Week and whatever jeans you found lying around on the floor will always look good together. When in doubt, just remember, consistency is key!
This mantra leads me to my next and last bit of counsel: Be consistent, but don’t be too available. If you’re there for everyone all the time, your prospective partner isn’t going to feel special. You should reserve extraordinary acts of kindness, like holding open doors and greeting the food service workers on campus, for your partner only. 
With that being said, I hope this how-to guide has equipped you with the necessary tools to find your future partner in crime. While you might not score a darling in time for this year’s Valentine’s Day, your love life will definitely be ripe for success with these pointers!

Yet another James Cameron work has come back into theatres recently. This year marks the 25th anniversary of his 1997 Romantic/Historical Epic “Titanic” and oh, titanic it is. This 194-minute colossal motion picture is, no doubt, the cornerstone of '90s big-budget cinema. As a matter of fact, this film was so big-budget, due primarily to its production costs spiraling out of control, that it seemed the entire world couldn’t stop talking about this film. Just ask your parents about it.
This film was predicted to be a giant flop but became the biggest sweetheart hit (a perfect date choice if you and your significant other are willing to sit for three-plus hours), and the highest grossing movie ever made at the time of its release (inflation not considered). Such a picture, one would figure, is stainless. In many ways, it is.
In terms of the film’s effects, it delivers one of the most jaw-dropping spectacles one could imagine during its last hour, especially considering the technological options of the time. The final sequence, thankfully, is not a long melodramatic kicking-crying never-ending event, but a coordinated and heavily researched unsurpassable recreation of a heartbreaking incident in human history, executed with taste, bearing in mind that some of the survivors of the actual ordeal were still alive at the time of release.
Of course, effects only take a film so far. And for "Titanic," this holds significantly more weight due to the fact that audiences already know what is going to happen. The iceberg that truly starts the action of the picture doesn’t appear until nearly two hours in, so we must be subjected to a good story to build up to caring about what happens to the people on board. In this regard, the film is debatable.
Everyone knows the story of “Titanic”: Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), a poor-in-cash but rich-in-life vagabond, falls in love at first sight with Rose DeWitt (Kate Winslet), a young lady to-be-married so congested with high society that she wishes to end herself, and it isn’t until she meets Jack that she realizes she loves life. It’s a simple premise, but one that everyone and their mother seems to like. However, the biggest issue I see with “Titanic” is the general message of the film, as the actions of Jack and Rose seem to have people so blinded with rose colored glasses that they don't see that what they perceive as affection and courage is actually poor decision making made completely of ill-rationale and emotion. 
Rose is, throughout the film, a liability that Jack takes on constantly. From the moment that they interact on the first night on the stern of the ship, this cycle begins of Rose endangering herself, causing him to have to save her, and not once afterwards does he realize that his luck is eventually going to run dry and that this girl he met just a few nights ago will get him killed or in serious trouble.
When the ship is sinking and she is placed on a lifeboat by Jack and her irascible fiancé Cal (Billy Zane), it would be perfectly rational for her to stay on the boat, allowing Jack to figure out by himself a way off, where they could reunite some few hours later — it isn’t that Jack ever needed her help during their escape sequence, anyways — but she decides to jump back on the sinking ship, essentially sealing Jack’s fate at the end of the picture. 
Another scene which should have had Jack in the mindset to question the validity of the love that he has with this woman is when he was framed by Cal to have stolen the Heart of the Ocean necklace. Jack proclaims his innocence while being arrested, but Rose doesn’t believe him. Why doesn’t she? Jack could not have faked falling in love with Rose for the sake of pocketing the diamond necklace, as he did not know about the necklace until after they had already begun their romantic affair. Taking into account that he strolled with her back to her cabin, the supposed scene of the crime, you would think that she would realize that Cal is clearly framing Jack in a terribly planned way.
Logic SHOULD have it that Rose defended Jack, a man she had up to that point danced, kissed, made love with, allowed to draw her nude, and promised to live the rest of her life with when they reach New York. This plot hole is only exacerbated further when she pens a letter to her violent and highly capable fiancé to find the naked drawing of her, but is surprised to see him retaliate by taking Jack to be killed by drowning? It doesn’t make any sense, and unfortunately, that seemingly slight error throws off this entire film in more than one way.
Of course, that isn’t to say that the story is irredeemable. The point of “Titanic” should not be seen as one centered around Rose, but rather around Jack. Jack is the important one because he is the one that sacrificed his life, practically the only thing which he owned, in exchange to give Rose a chance at another life, one which she would not throw away or treat as worthless. I do not feel inclined to banter on about how “the door wasn’t big enough” and that Jack could have fit on it too or whatnot. Sure, I can see that the prop department should have seen the blatant mistake and corrected it by making it smaller, but they didn’t and so it blots the picture. Still, Jack should not have been spared death, as his martyrdom represents what it means to give up everything for someone that you love, while also representing the deaths of all the people who died on that freezing April night in the middle of the Atlantic.
The film is a good romance, all-in-all, however slighted by its own script. Given Valentine’s Day approaching, one should definitely see the movie if they have never before, especially with romantic intentions. "Titanic" will not disappoint and has something for everyone, and to that, it is commendable.

Ceci, 
So after getting accepted to study graduate physics at six schools, I somehow ended up back here. Could have saved a lot of time on applications if only I'd known. Can't get enough of this place I guess. 
At first I didn't really like the idea of staying at the same university another four years. At a certain point, shouldn't I outgrow this school? But I'm hoping it won't be like my undergrad experience. I've got a new house in Bloomfield with Arthur and his friend Mabel. I honestly love our neighborhood. It feels like I'm just a citizen of Pittsburgh who happens to go to CMU, not a college student who happens to live in Pittsburgh. I think it'll be different this time.
I was talking with Arthur last night and apparently, him and Sammy have been hooking up — which is very odd. I told you about Sammy, right? She was that weird girl from orientation week. I suppose I'm glad Arthur told me, since she and I have… history, I guess you could call it. But it doesn't make any sense. He was the very first person I told my story to, and he was the one who told me all those concerning things about her. I tried reminding him about all that, but he insists she's changed. I flat out told him I don't want to see her at our house, and that if he ever brings her over he's gotta let me know in advance. He seems to respect that, but I can't figure out how his brain makes that make sense. 
Last week I went to a physics colloquium over in Pitt where I had a really great conversation with two other grad students. On Saturday the three of us went to get coffee out in Lawrenceville, and guess who I saw? It was Clair, that girl I used to say hi to on campus all the time. I went over and chatted with her, because, I mean, what are the odds? I saw her in passing all the time, and I think we incidentally got dinner together a handful of times, but otherwise she was like a D-list character at best. But we hit it off super well for some reason, and I guess I was feeling bold because I asked her out. I feel like she was kept in my life for some reason. Whenever we reached the point where we might stop waving to each other on the Cut, we'd hang out with a mutual friend by chance. So she'd get bumped back up to getting a wave, and so on for years and years.  
We got dinner yesterday, and I have to say it went really well. We took a long walk through Schenley afterward and had a really great conversation about our undergrad years. Our social circles were always pretty adjacent, we just talked a lot about how our friends were doing. It makes me happy to hear that people are figuring it out. 
Classes have been pretty rough so far, I can't lie. Penco, the old M&I professor, is teaching a class on quantum field theory that is just absolutely killing me. I'm doing big league physics now. Last week I was having trouble studying, so I went to my old favorite table in Sorrels. I don't think I belong there anymore though, because I felt like an old man hanging out at a middle school. I miss my Sorrels friends — the nameless regulars who studied at the high tables with me. Back in the day it was exciting, because any one of those people had the potential to become a character. But I think it's best I leave that kind of fun to the kids now. How did we not realize how young we were? 
The research has been going really well. I haven't had the chance to truly invest myself in a project like this since I did robotics in high school. Nothing I did during undergrad comes close. I stay at the Mellon institute for hours and hours, because my brain is just buzzing with activity. I forget to take breaks because there's always more things to code and more tests to run. I don't really even go out that much, because all the bars in Oakland are crawling with undergrads anyways. I go to Union Grill like once a week with Mabel and her friend to get their $2 cocktails, but that's about it.
You, on the other hand — seems like a weekend doesn't go by without some excitement on your snap story. What's it like being a carefree youngster living it up in New York? Are you and Cynthia a thing now? Now that I have my car in Pittsburgh, I can drive to visit whenever I want. Next week I have Monday off, let's do something fun that weekend. I want to meet Cynthia, make sure she's good enough for you. 
I'm sure she's great though, you tend to pick the good ones. Look at us go. 
Love,
Andy

As the opening bars started, I recalled my motivation for coming here. Besides looking to see and be seen, for what reasons does opera appeal to its audience? I tried to picture how opera was once a popular art form (indeed, the first best-selling record was that of an opera star, sold in Italy). "Così Fan Tutti" was first performed in an era with no recorded media, set to a style of music that was popular. But even without contextualizing it within its time — making the medium seem anachronistic — it is not hard to place the motivation for opera firmly in the modern day. Look at soap operas, telenovelas and k-dramas today, and it starts to make sense: the same over-the-top plots and lovers are not hard to find. With the medium seeming less alien, it becomes clear that opera is purposefully hyperbolic to draw out shared parts of human nature — a trait shared by popular music and movies today. For example, "Così"’s aria “Love is Like a Little Thief” resonates with anyone whose love life has ever been anything but sublime. 
I am not a big fan of the Classical period (I think the music is mostly repetitive, with an emphasis on the technical, and forgettable compared to the work of later composers) but I was pleasantly surprised. There was one lovely aria (the aforementioned “Love is Like a Little Thief”) with a simple, lyrical melody that made my hair stand on end. The operatic exaggeration resonated with me here; despite the overwhelming differences between when the piece was written and now, the alternating joy and frustration of being in love remains the same (“a little serpent is love/He takes away and gives peace/as he pleases to the heart”). Some things truly defy both time and custom. 
The attitudes of the time shone through in this piece, however. What stood out to me is the cavalier attitude towards war, reflecting a more violent era. Women believe they may never see their husbands again (and that they may die horribly), and yet the joke is on them. I found it difficult to laugh. The overall message of the work is “all women cheat, but we live with it.” Unsurprisingly, men escape scrutiny. They are arguably more easily persuaded to cheat on their lovers — and with their best friends’ beaus no less. Indeed, they instigate the infidelity: they accept the bet (that each can seduce the other’s fiancée) and are not chided for it. 
To look down on "Così"’s plot from the standpoint of a more enlightened society would be a mistake. It is not hard to find similar misogynistic attitudes in media today: specifically, the idea that badgering enough — even to the point of assault — will lead to affection. The performances show little developing attraction otherwise (between disguised men and fiancées) and give very little in the way of an alternative explanation, other than that the harassment was successful in its aim. This notion is reflected in modern day rom-coms where predatory behavior is rewarded. The manipulative tactics used by the protagonists also go unchallenged by any character, and are again played for laughs. In one scene, a man even threatens suicide if the woman he desires does not return his affection — and it works. Such antics would not be out of place in “Revenge of the Nerds” or “Animal House.”
Presenting such a piece in an environment such as Carnegie Mellon raises questions about whether directorial choices could, or should, moderate some of the protagonists’ worst excesses. I came away concluding that there is only so much an old text can be re-interpreted short of modifying it. (“Albanians” was translated from Italian as “hippies.”) I wonder if the director could have gone further in terms of blocking, such as the degree of intimidation of female lovers. However, I believe there is a strong argument for presenting the piece in its original form, transposed into the modern day. Seeing such behavior in a more modern context raises questions of how unrealistic it is. Similar misogyny would not have been out of place in 1960s San Diego, where this production was set. While the director’s stated intention was to set the piece in a time of female sexual liberation, the setting was also, maybe unintentionally, a shrewd choice for drawing attention to male chauvinism in a time considered relatively modern. Perhaps viewing "Così" as a dusty time capsule is a mistake at everyone’s peril.

Every time a Carnegie Mellon missed connection is posted, I can’t help but think about how many stalkers we have on campus. In case you didn’t know, Carnegie Mellon does actually have a stalking problem. In 2019, there were 24 total cases of stalking, 10 in 2020, and 13 in 2021. Yikes! When Missed Connections first became a thing, I thought it was cute, but the more I thought about it, I realized it’s kind of problematic. 
At the very least, I feel like Missed Connections promotes an anti-social atmosphere. Instead of actually approaching these people, are people actually thinking, “Oh man, they’re so cool, I should make a Missed Connections post about them”? Like how many people actually end up meeting the people they post about?
Here’s some of my criticisms of some recent Missed Connections.
“Submitted 1/28/23, 8:54 PM
1/28 8pm ish. To the girl that had an interesting interaction w a homeless man before taking the 71C w my friends and I. If you’re single hmu”
I’m not too sure how to start with this one. If you saw this person having an “interesting interaction w a homeless man” and want to maybe connect with her, then why not ask them if they’re okay, etc. Or did I miss something, and it’s more socially acceptable to instead post about them not even an hour later to see if they’re single?
“Submitted 2/3/23, 11:37 AM
To my 104 TA ..., I lowkey had a crush on you but didn’t want to make things weird. Hit me up if you are interested”
How on earth is this TA supposed to hit you up if you didn’t say who you are, coward. Let the entire campus know who you were and how you had an awkward crush on a TA. The post additionally named the TA, which I think is a little weird. I would find it weird if I was a TA for a class and later found out someone had a crush on me, especially if it wasn’t reciprocated. But hey, love works in mysterious ways, so who am I to judge?
“Submitted 2/2/23, 9:08 PM
to the guy I am best friends with, i have feelings for you, but i dont match ur type, so it is what it is” 
To whoever this is, if you’re not going to directly tell your best friends you have feelings for them, it’s never going to work out in the first place. Either tell them you have a crush on them or get over it, there’s really no other way. Posting on Missed Connections instead does nothing for you.
“Submitted 2/3/23, 5:30 PM
to the cute indian girl who sat next to me at the counter in prima earlier this week i wanted to say hi”
My brother in Christ, just say “Hi” instead of letting her live rent-free in your head for the rest of the week. Additionally, someone was tagged in the comments referring to this post, which I have a problem with. Send the person the post instead of tagging them; if they wanted the person who posted about them to know their name, then the one who was posted about should respond. 
Maybe I’m just some guy who’s just hampering other people’s fun, but the amount of detail that some of the people on this campus describe other people with is a little disturbing. But please, for the love of God, can’t we just talk to each other normally?

For a long time vampire stories have sought to answer the age old question: What is our deepest desire as humanity? Whether it be love, lust, or a place to belong, these stories, of course, take us through a journey of what it would be like to live in a world where that desire carries on long after the body expires, and the cravings of lifeblood to satiate it are impossible to keep at bay. 
Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre reminds us of that in Michael Pink’s adaption of the quintessential vampire tale, "Dracula." The story follows our dear friend Jonathan Harker on his journey to Transylvania where unspeakable horrors await him, and what follows from there is the race against time to stop "Dracula" from wreaking any more havoc than he already has.
The ballet, written to be a close adaption of Stoker’s novel, surprisingly holds that title pretty well considering that it condenses the story into a little over two hours. We begin the horrific tale somewhat in media res; we enter Jonathan’s nightmare, depicting his and Mina’s wedding and (spoiler alert) Mina’s transformation into a vampire, which happens later in the novel.
I found myself so immersed in the show it only felt like each act was 15 minutes, when in reality, 45 minutes passed by before the intermissions. It’s hard not to be immersed —from the moment the show begins, it doesn’t wait for the audience to be brought into this world of gothic horror; a loud, thrumming heartbeat resounds throughout the entire theatre, bringing you directly into Jonathan’s nightmares. Here we get just a small bite of the theatrical feast of what’s to come; through the veil of the mesh drop down, we get a glimpse at the production — the set is made up of scaffolding and stone, the yellowed lighting of the dim Victorian bulbs, and the projections depicting the journey ahead. 
Dancers in devilish masks taunt Jonathan (Corey Bourbonniere) and Mina (Hannah Carter), who bursts out of a coffin, foreshadowing her transformation into a creature of the night. After waking from this nightmare, Jonathan begins his fateful journey to Transylvania, first bidding farewell to his wife, Mina, and his longtime friend, Van Helsing (Jack Hawn). This strong setup sets the tone for the show and does a great job at pulling the audience into the story, keeping them glued to their seats throughout the show.
The set design was impressively utilized throughout the ballet, from the swift scene changes of Dracula’s castle (wrought-iron gates and all) to how set pieces were incorporated into the choreography of the scene… literally (one example of this I found particularly creative is the way Jonathan’s boat ride to Transylvania is interpreted: He stands on a freestanding staircase as dancers spin it around). The costuming was incredible, especially the dresses in the opening of Act II during the party — they keep that Victorian style without being dangerous to the dancers and touching the floor.
This adaption breathes some (undead) life into the story, chock full of emotion in every pirouette and sway of the dancers. As this is my first time watching a ballet, I don’t really have the correct vocabulary to describe the dancers' movements accurately, so I’ll try my best. One of my favorite moments in the ballet was when Lucy (performed by Tommie Lin O’ Hanlon) was enchanted by Dracula (Colin McCaslin) during the party — she rises to her toes and dances towards him, completely in a trance and subject to his every command. They reach the top of the stairs, where Dracula bites her, and, with her arms splayed, leaves her to be found by the rest of the party.
There were some cool moments where Dracula would just slink over things, like the railings of staircases, and even people (he slid himself over Jonathan’s shoulder and onto the floor in a rather passionate dance sequence). Another neat bit of him doing this is when he leaves Renfield’s (Joseph Parr) cell to go to Mina’s room — he hangs upside down from the railing like a bat, grabs onto the railing and lowers himself to the ground, where the floor fills with fog and he emerges from it, as if he had become the fog himself. The ensemble dancing scenes were also incredible — I especially loved the Undead’s dance at the end. They all ooze out of crypts in the wall, writhing and wailing, longing for a taste of blood. Overall, the choreography truly was great to see, and the dancers did an incredible job making these characters feel real, especially Dracula, whose stage presence was incredibly over-the-top but sinister.
To those who read the book who may be wondering the same thing I did — yes, the ballet takes some liberties. HOWEVER, those differences were justified to make the plot coherent for ballet. For example, there wasn’t going to be enough time to go through every night Dracula visits Lucy, and the (multiple) blood transfusions that follow. The only thing I have any issue with was how Mina was handled towards the end — instead of helping out the gang to watch for Dracula using her psychic connection with him, she immediately disappears after being bitten and the gang goes after her. I feel as though the aspect of Mina’s “strong female” characteristics could’ve been better represented in that moment, but some things were cut for time, which is understandable; it’s hard to condense nearly 400 pages of the book (or nine-hour audiobook) into two-and-a-half hours of dance. Additionally, Mina’s attempt to understand Renfield tried to show that side of her that isn’t just a damsel in distress, which did help a bit to cover that part of her character. Honestly though, the entire production was so mesmerizing, I can overlook the inaccuracies.
Wish you could’ve made the show but still want to quench the thirst for a good ballet performance? There are a few other upcoming shows in this year’s season, including "The Masters Program" with the PBT orchestra, as well as "Sleeping Beauty," also with the PBT orchestra, so go check them out if you get the chance!

On Jan. 31st, Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald offered to send county police to support the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police (PBP) in their patrols of Downtown. On Monday, Feb. 6 these plans were confirmed by Christopher Kearns, Superintendent of Allegheny County Police, meaning there is a joint effort between city and county police to patrol Downtown Pittsburgh. 
This Thursday, Feb 9., Mayor Ed Gainey held a town hall on the details of this new plan. The goal is to increase the number of police officers in Downtown, which is also colloquially known as the Golden Triangle. Currently, the number of cops on-duty in the Golden Triangle is anywhere from three to 10; Gainey promises to increase this to 18 by the end of March. 
However, Gainey also described his hope to address these concerns via several non-traditional means. He has expressed opposition to police sweeps of those living on the streets, arguing, “People say you should just put them in jail, lock them up. For what?” He pointed to his administration's efforts to increase affordable housing Downtown to address the overcrowded Second Avenue Commons shelter, one of only five all-gender homeless shelters in the city and the only one in Downtown.
The impetus for this change is a growing concern among business owners who worry that the perceived increase in violent crime will drive away business. The Downtown Neighbor's Alliance (DNA) is a nonprofit organization whose members represent business owners in the Golden Triangle. According to the Post-Gazette, John Valentine, executive director of the DNA, supports this increase in policing. 
Residents of Downtown point to a number of recent criminal incidents. On Jan. 19, a man was shot and killed during an altercation near Liberty Ave and Wood St, and on Jan. 29 shots were fired near Sixth Ave. and Smithfield St. Nearby property was damaged, including a shattered window at the Omni William Penn Hotel, but nobody was injured. 
Residents and business owners have been expressing concern about the increase in crime as early as October last year, after a man was shot and killed in an alley off Fort Duquesne Blvd. However, crime statistics provided by Allegheny county indicate that several categories of crime, including assault, burglary, and disorderly conduct, have been decreasing in the city for several years. The notable exception is criminal homicide — 56 offenses of which were counted in 2022 (the highest since 2014). Whether this string of recent shootings in Downtown reflects a larger trend remains to be seen. However, the immediate effect of this perceived crime wave is a desire for increased police presence by residents and businesses owners. 
Business owners on the South Side echoed similar concerned; multiple spoke in front of state legislators from the House Democratic Policy Committee this past Wednesday, Feb. 8. They were primarily concerned by the increasing number of underage teenagers drinking and loitering on E. Carson Street, the main commercial artery of the South Side and an extremely liquor-license dense region of the city. However, Acting Deputy Chief of the Pittsburgh Public Safety Department Linda Rosato-Barone noted that crime has actually been decreasing in the neighborhood. 
This change in policing has drawn criticism, with some comparing this "saturation policing" to "hotspot policing," the tactic used by the Memphis Police Department — a unit of Memphis "hotspot" police were responsible for the death of Tyre Nichols. The Pittsburgh Police Bureau denies this comparison, and vows that no such specialized units will exist in the city. David Weisburg, a professor at George Mason University who specialized in crime-prevention policy claims that saturating an entire neighborhood is not an efficient prevention strategy.
As of now, Mayor Gainey's administration promises that this increase in policing will be accompanied by other measures that seek to reduce crime. In fact, Gainey ran on a platform that included "Redirecting Resources" and "Demilitarizing the police equipment and training." This increase in policing, though welcome by businesses owners, remains troubling for those who advocate for alternative strategies.

On Tuesday night President Biden gave the State of the Union address. This was the first State of the Union address since the Democrats lost the House of Representatives to the Republicans, a fact exemplified by the presence of Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) standing behind him as the Speaker of the House, a position he has been serving as since early January of this year.
The president had a divisive audience, not only with a split Congress, but also with American households throughout the nation. According to the Associated Press, a new AP-NORC poll only 37 percent of Democrats support a  Biden-Harris 2024 re-election campaign, down from 52 percent in October 2022. The decline is concentrated mostly in Democrats aged 44 and younger, only 23 percent of whom support re-election. According to the poll, the main issues concerning both Democrats and Republicans are inflation, the economy, and governmental spending.
“Two years ago, our economy was reeling … we have created a record 12 million new jobs, more jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four years.” He assures us that the economy is coming back around from COVID, due to his governmental policy while also taking credit for the decrease in the inflation rate we are seeing, now at 6.5 percent, down from the 9.1 percent we suffered from in June 2022.
Biden affirmed plans to continue his governmental spending policy with the Inflation Reduction Act to deal with rising costs of pharmaceuticals, gas, and groceries. He also vowed to continue granting government subsidies towards student loan-debt forgiveness, and green-energy projects. 
Biden plans to pass legislation to make multi-billion dollar corporations pay an average of 15 percent in federal income taxes. He also plans to crack down on Big Oil, stating that ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP and the other supermajors made a record $200 billion dollars last year, then used said profits to “buy back their own stock, rewarding their CEOs and shareholders.” His proposition: “Quadruple the tax on corporate stock buybacks to encourage long term investments.”
When Biden claimed that  “too little” of Big Oil’s profits go to investing in new long-term investments, specifically oil refineries, viewers began to hear outbursts from the crowd. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA) the last U.S. oil refinery with significant downstream unit capacity was built in 1976.
Biden claimed that he spoke to oil companies executives on why they’ve barely increased domestic oil production in the past 50 years, who said: “We’re afraid you’re going to shut down all the oil wells and the oil refineries, so why should we invest in them?” Biden said he responded, “Well, we’re gonna need oil for at least another decade.” Many in the chamber, including Rep. McCarthy behind Biden, began laughing.
Biden made the case for Congress to increase the debt limit. He accused the Republicans of wanting “to take the economy hostage … instead of making the wealthy pay their fair share, some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset.”
Republicans began yelling over the president. Before the address, according to CNN, McCarthy and most Republicans explicitly opposed cutting government entitlements in negotiations with the debt ceiling, though some want Social Security to sunset in the coming years.
Biden also promised to push companies to lower fees and ban them from overcharging the average consumer. He also urged for universal pre-K, reforming police nationwide (in light of the police beating of Tyre Nichols), cracking down on taxpayer fraud, and banning assault weapons.
Biden spoke about the fentanyl crossing into the country from the Southern border, with border patrol “seizing over 23,000 pounds of fentanyl in just the last several months.” Deaths from fentanyl, oxycontin, and other hard substances have been growing every year. In 2015, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), 52,000 individuals died of drug overdoses. In 2020, that figure had close to doubled to around 92,000. Biden brought that figure up, only to have a few from the chamber yell “Border!” and “It’s your fault!” Biden did not respond to the heckles and moved on to foreign policy.
America is currently at odds with the People's Republic of China. Both the United States and China are increasing military spending, and Biden made sure to state that any aggression towards the sovereignty of America will be met with retaliation. He concluded with a call to stand America fast to peace, justice, and most of all, common ground. “We are the United States of America and there is nothing, nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together.”

A 7.8 magnitude earthquake devastated Turkey and Syria on Monday, Feb. 6, around the Turkish-Syrian border. The death toll has amassed more than 7,000 lives, injured tens of thousands others, and reduced thousands of building and houses to rubble. Tremors were reported as far as Israel and Jordan.
The earthquake’s epicenter was less than 15 miles from the city of Gaziantep, with its effective intensity range reaching the island of Cyprus and the cities of Damascus and even Cairo. CNN noted that Turkey’s Head of Disaster Services, Yunus Sezer, reported the initial death toll at around 3,000 lives lost in Turkey. In Syria, the Syrian State News Agency recorded around 700 initial deaths, and the Syria Civil Defense also reported another 740 deaths in areas occupied by oppositional anti-government forces; On top of this disaster, the country has been embroiled in a civil war for the past 13 years, with the northwestern areas of the country being the primary site of conflict.
Thousands of aftershocks have affected the region, some almost as powerful as the initial quake, sending both countries into a state of grave emergency. European countries, the United States, and other NATO allies have sworn to assist financially and physically by sending medical, rescue, and financial assistance.
By Tuesday morning, first responders worked exhaustively to free people from underneath broken concrete and twisted metal. According to the Associated Press, they are fighting a losing battle, as there is only so much time and oxygen for people trapped under mountains of debris, with too many missing and not enough hands to reach out. Along with the lack of resources for first responders is the fact that Turkey and Syria are still amidst a deadly winter. As rain and snow accumulates, the odds of survival for those trapped beneath rubble continue to decrease. 
According to Turkish officials, despite the near complete depletion of hospitals and clinics, medics have rescued nearly 8,000 civilians across 10 of the 81 Turkish provinces. Videos have circulated of the damages, showing cityscapes strewn with rubble and human remains. More than 23 million people live in the areas hit by the quakes and many of them have no other place to go. For the past few months, the United Nations has been executing an effort to assist more than one million migrants monthly throughout all of Eastern Europe. But with this quake, all efforts have come to a screeching halt, leaving many people without assistance and throwing the region further into chaos. Food and shelter has also been a struggle to maintain with overcrowding being common in many of the emergency camps set up by emergency medical groups.
The U.S. has made efforts by both state and federal powers to send aid to the people of Turkey and Syria. According to the White House, President Biden spoke with Turkey’s President Erdogan on Monday to work out a plan for America to assist. According to John Kirby, Coordinator for Strategic Communications under the Biden Administration, the U.S. will send 158 urban search-and-rescuers to assist Turkish efforts, and are negotiating on the amount of money and supplies to send.
Meanwhile, due to the ongoing civil war, American and Western assistance teams are hesitant to be deployed in Syria. Some areas are entirely controlled by Tahrir al-Sham, a group with ties to Al-Qaeda. There are also sanctions in place on Syria by the European Union from the 2010s and before which have sent humanitarian requests for assistance through a bureaucratic whirlpool of paperwork, costing time that the people in need do not have.
It should also be noted that Syria has close ties with the Russians. Russia has sworn to send in 300 military personnel to Syria for road clearing and other much needed assistance. Alongside Russia, Algeria, Iran, Iraq, and the UAE has sent planes of first aid to Syrian government-controlled airports. 
Still, in both Turkey and Syria, emergency workers are struggling to keep up the physically and mentally demanding job, with help in the form of more hands and resources constantly being in short supply.

According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, the suffix “-gate” refers to a political scandal. It originates from the Watergate scandal that ended with the resignation of then-US President Richard Nixon in 1974. One of its newest additions is Qatargate: allegedly, current and former members of the European Parliament — the legislative branch of the European Union located in Brussels, Belgium — have been influenced by Qatari and Moroccan officials to promote these countries in European legislation. The charges against them are organized crime, money laundering, and corruption. The scandal exploded in mid-December and has been rocking the European institution ever since.
New facts may come up with investigations still proceeding. What follows is a small guide to what is known as of now.
The group:
At the center of the investigation is a group of current and former members of the European Parliament (MEP) and lobbyists who worked together to promote foreign countries’ interests in the institution.
The head of this group was former Italian MEP Pier Antonio Panzeri, who was arrested and later started cooperating with the Belgian police leading the investigation. According to his lawyer's statements, he acknowledged his involvement in “acts of corruption.” 
Another key figure of the group was Francesco Giorgi, the previous advisor to Panzeri, who also confessed his criminal actions: according to court documents analyzed by Le Soir and La Repubblica newspapers, he admitted he took bribes from the Qatari and Moroccan governments.
Giorgi’s life partner — Eva Kaili, Greek MEP and one of the European Parliament vice presidents — seems to be also involved as well. Giorgi denied any involvement of Kaili but admitted that she knew of the origin of the money he had received. She is currently under arrest. Suspicion of her participation stems from her strong support of Qatar, even calling the country a “frontrunner in labor rights” in a parliamentary setting while the European Parliament approved a resolution expressing concerns about migrants’ work conditions for the 2022 Football World Cup in Qatar. 
The names of two other MEPs were revealed by Panzeri and Giorgi: the Belgian Marc Tarabella and the Italian Andrea Cozzolino. Both have been accused of participating in the scheme and are now under investigation.
The operations:
The amount of money that has been seized by the Belgian police in December is €1.5 million ($1.6 million) from the homes of those involved. Grigori said this sum consisted of bribes to influence the European Parliament. An example is blocking resolutions that damaged foreign countries as written in. In its analysis of police documents, German Der Spiegel news magazine reported that Panzeri and Giorgi prepped the Qatari Labor minister for his appearance at one of the European Parliament’s Subcommittee on Human Rights meetings last November. Panzieri promised to reveal more of the modus operandi as part of his plea deal. 
The group was “shockingly amateurish” in its operations as reported by Der Spiegel. For example, the bribe money was hidden in private apartments and Giorgi kept track of his “lobbying project” for Qatar in an Excel file stored on his Google Drive. Der Spiegel also highlighted how “those involved were apparently aware from the very beginning that their activities went far beyond normal lobbying work” because they used codewords and clandestine payment methods.
Alberto Alemanno, a professor of EU Law, suggested that the reason these officials were able to operate for several years and in a sloppy way unobserved is due to the fewer checks and controls in the European Parliament compared to other EU institutions (like MEPs not being sanctioned for not reporting donations and gifts).
The foreign countries:
While the name of the scandal only refers to Qatar, Morocco is also accused of profiting from Panzeri’s group’s services.
As reported by Der Spiegel, the Moroccan government was willing to illegally pursue its interests in Brussels because of its economic dependence on the European Union. Data from the European Commission shows that 64 percent of Morocco’s exports in 2019 went to the bloc and that EU countries are responsible for more than half of foreign investments going to Morocco. According to the investigation documents studied by Der Spiegel, the head of the Moroccan foreign intelligence service was directly behind the corruption of those affiliated with Panzeri.
Qatar's reasons to participate in the illegal scheme are thought to be different than Morocco's as noted by Der Spiegel, and mainly concerned the desire of the Arab country to clean up its name after the reports on slave-like working conditions of those migrant workers that were employed in the building of football stadiums for the 2022 World Cup. The main point of contact with the Qatari government for Panzeri’s group was the then head of Qatar’s national human rights committee and now labor minister.
Both countries deny any involvement in the issue.
Current information about the scandal is believed to be just the tip of the iceberg. Other countries may have tried to influence the European Parliament in a similar way. The stakes for European democracy are high. Now a gate has been opened to the criminal operations taking place in the heart of the European Union, we just have to wait to see what next will come out of it.

A Norfolk Southern freight train traveling through eastern Ohio derailed on Feb. 3, sending 50 of its tanker cars into a massive pile-up. The train was transporting both hazardous and non-hazardous materials when it experienced a technical malfunction of unknown cause. No injuries or fatalities were reported from the immediate incident, as the crew was able to exit the scene before the cars caught fire. Toxic material was released into the air, spewing toxic fumes for several days.
An evacuation order strongly urged residents within a one-mile radius of the scene to leave while local officials and investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and EPA analyzed the safety of the surrounding environment, checking air and water quality levels for toxicity.
Many residents of the village of East Palestine, Ohio were within eyesight of the blaze. Aerial drone footage taken by the NTSB showed the smoldering wreckage of tanker cars scattered across a wide swath of track, fires at the derailment site burning through the next day.
NTSB officials collected evidence from the scene last week, according to a news briefing, and will “methodically and systematically review” that evidence to discover what caused the incident. Their Washington-based laboratory will process and evaluate the recorded data. Preliminary analyses from the lab are typically completed within four to six weeks, but the complete incident report addressing what exactly caused the derailment may take as long as two years before it is publicly available. Serious industrial accidents of this nature can take years in the process of analyzing exactly what went wrong.
Twenty of the derailed cars were identified as transporting hazardous material. Five cars held vinyl chloride, a constituent in the making of PVC pipe and other plastic products. Several others contained residual benzene from previous shipments. These two materials are both highly flammable and vulnerable to drastic temperature changes, such as the rapid fluctuation from that day’s single-digit weather to the heat of the chemical fire.
To lessen the risk of explosion, workers from Norfolk Southern drained off and then burned the hazardous spill from at-risk tank cars in a controlled release, sending the fumes into the atmosphere. Both vinyl chloride and benzene are known carcinogens. Inhaling the toxic chemical fumes can be dangerous, with effects ranging from skin burns to lung damage, and can be deadly in concentrated doses.
Days after the spill, state and federal officials determined the air quality to be below harmful levels. On Feb. 8, residents were advised it was safe for them to return home, contaminant levels measured within the range of acceptability. Wreckage and debris from the pileup were still being cleared away late last week. Schools in the district were closed for the week, and students were sent home to ensure all buildings and systems were ready for their safe return, with officials planning to reopen these buildings on Feb. 13.
The chemical content of the spill is known to be mainly vinyl chloride; however, at this time the extent of chemicals leaching into the environment is not certain. The EPA has told residents the atmospheric chemicals are at safe levels. The health impacts being felt by the local population, however, are hard to ignore.
East Palestine residents have reported sickness and even death among the local pets and livestock. Although necropsies for these animals will be necessary to determine the precise cause of death, many in the community believe chemical exposure to be the cause. 
Residents have been observing peculiar behavior in many of their pets since the derailment. According to these pet owners, cats, dogs, and other animals that weren’t able to be evacuated are falling ill and dying at an abnormal rate, with visual evidence that many residents are taking as a harbinger of the illness being quietly inflicted upon them.
Downstream of the chemical release, numerous dead fish have been spotted and are being scooped out of rivers by the Ohio EPA.
Despite surface waters being contaminated to the point of killing aquatic life, officials from the Ohio EPA made reassurances to residents that their well water should be safe for consumption. Environmental remediation efforts are underway in particular areas where the rail incident deposited toxic chemicals.
Concentrated rail networks in the western Pennsylvania and Ohio region make the threat of rail accidents a foremost issue for public safety. Pittsburgh’s aging rail infrastructure raises the threat of a similar train disaster within the city, and the dense population around city tracks multiplies the potential for a deadly event if a similar situation were to occur. The NTSB’s vehicle recorder lab will be working to determine what caused the accident and to make any necessary safety recommendations to mitigate the risk of future derailments.

A Timeline of Events
The first balloon was first reported on Feb. 1. It was in Montana near Billings Logan International Airport, and the airport was shut down for a couple hours in response. The reporting brought national attention to the balloon, and it immediately hit headlines across the country. People started wondering where the balloon came from, who sent it, and what, if anything, was its purpose.
The next day, the Pentagon started talking. It was a high altitude Chinese balloon that had been flying over the U.S. for a few days. A second balloon was reported over Latin America, and later that evening, Canada confirmed a third, unnamed incident that it was currently tracking. While the latter of these events was overlooked, the balloon was now fully ingrained in the American news cycle, and the questions started coming. Was it dangerous? Why hadn’t the U.S. done something yet?
It was Friday when China finally commented, with the Foreign Ministry apologizing for the balloon "straying off course," and saying it had no intention to violate any airspace. This started a back-and-forth between U.S. and China officials, with China claiming it was all an accident, while the U.S. pointed out this was a violation of American airspace. The situation became tense as U.S. Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, canceled a trip to China, while internal pressure on Biden erupted. The conservative faction of the House, headed by Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), put the president on blast, demanding action. China continued to claim the balloon was nothing more than a weather balloon. 
Saturday was the last day the balloon was allowed to fly, and an F-22 Raptor shot it down shortly after it flew over the coast of the Carolinas, while it remained within U.S. waters. A naval mission was instructed to pick up what was left of the balloon, and the debris was shipped to U.S. intelligence for investigation.
Background and Aftermath
Officially, that’s the beginning and end of the 2023 Chinese Balloon incident, but that’s just the end of the flight itself. There’s a lot more, especially in the realm of balloon usage and China’s recent history. While China maintains that the object was meant to report on the weather, there’s reasonable cause to doubt that claim. China has been working on balloon technology at an increased rate since April of 2022, according to Reuters, and as early as 2014, there were papers published in Chinese academic journals calling for the use of balloons in air defense and air incursion. Combining this with China’s current aggressive stance — wolf warrior diplomacy, a nickname for aggressive, confrontational foreign policy, has been noted across almost all Chinese embassies in foreign countries — and the U.S.’s claims hold more weight. 
On top of that, the downed balloon bears no resemblance to any weather balloon currently used. Weather balloons are usually much smaller than the downed balloon, and carry a globally standardized set of equipment. Most weather sensors have not been changed in a while, and the sensors recovered don’t fall in line with weather technology. Data gathered from American U2 spy planes seems to show that the balloon had significant intelligence gathering capabilities, including equipment that would be unusual on a weather balloon or similar meteorological device. The balloon also has claimed electronic tracking capabilities, including the ability to track and capture mobile phone and radio signals and data. 
Further capabilities included the balloon's apparent ability to increase and decrease in altitude to enter favorable currents that would help it travel to specific locations. The balloon entered American airspace at an altitude of 60,000 feet, and was shot down at an altitude of 58,000 feet, seemingly dropping into lower airstreams in order to travel. The wreckage was recovered, and the U.S. identified propellers and rudders for movement, as well as a large solar panel for energy. 
This is not the first identified strange balloon, with two near Japan and one near Taiwan reported recently, though none of those were linked to China explicitly. In addition, the Pentagon released information saying the balloon is one of 40 flown over five continents since 2017, five of which incurred American air space. This is, however, the first of these balloons to spend significant time over the US.
Despite such findings, China has vehemently denied any negative association between the balloon and intelligence gathering capabilities. In fact, the country has continued to raise objections, claiming that the U.S. shooting it down was a violation of international law. The U.S. has responded with evidence that the balloon was not part of a meteorological data agreement, nor was it authorized to be in American airspace at that time, and was therefore a valid target for attack. While the balloon posed no danger to American citizens and was recovered without any accident or damage to American property, the U.S. has still responded to the incident strongly, bringing together diplomats from the U.S. and Canada to discuss the situation with China.
Another object was shot down over Alaska over the weekend, and the situation does not appear to de-escalate anytime soon. China claims the balloon was not meant for spying, and has accused the U.S. of escalating and causing an international incident. As it stands, the two countries are currently negotiating as the U.S. attempts to find more information from the debris.
In terms of domestic pressure, the Republican Party, as well as hawkish Democrats, have called for stronger defense of American airspace, as well as improved early detection and warnings systems to prevent this from happening again.
Recent updates
The U.S. has shot down a number of other unidentified objects over American airspace in the last week. While U.S. intelligence don’t have much information about these objects, and most have been shot down over Alaska and Canadian airspace. The current reports are foggy, but there might even have been a fourth object. Meanwhile, Chinese naval vessels have started moving closer to the Japanese EEZ, and other strange actions have been taken by the Chinese military. On top of all that, China has gone quiet in response to the United States, while planning on shooting down another unidentified object over Chinese ports this time, which they aren’t talking about. The number of unidentified objects being shot down and reported this week is very high, and the government remains exceptionally tight-lipped about it.

This week, Mayor Ed Gainey announced plans for a new policing initiative in Downtown Pittsburgh. The primary aim  is to increase the number of cops on the street in order to deter violent crime, over concerns that increasing violent crime is driving business away from Downtown. This initiative is supported by an influx of Allegheny County Police Officers who will supplement the work of Pittsburgh city cops. 
Whether or not there has genuinely been a spike in violent crime is hard to say — overall crime in the city has been trending down for several years. Downtown stakeholders, represented by the Downtown Neighbor's Alliance, point to recent shootings that have heightened the fear of crime among residents. Concern over crime has grown nationwide, but whether this rise is proportional to actual crime rate is a complicated question. It's also hard to overlook the fact that the Downtown Neighbor's Alliance is interested in public safety for the purposes of maximizing their revenue, and that a pattern of police which addresses their concerns may not be in the best interests of all community members. If we may be radical for a moment, when cops protect capital they often harm people. 
This influx of cops has drawn criticism from the Pittsburgh Citizen Police Review Board, with some comparing it to the "Saturation Patrols" used in Memphis that were responsible for the death of Tyre Nichols.
From our perch atop Oakland, this might feel like an issue we can view at arm's length. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if many Carnegie Mellon students feel disconnected from the city in which our school is situated. Carnegie Mellon has a much higher proportion of students from out of the state than our much larger neighbor, Pitt, and often it's easy to overlook the broader impact of our school on Pittsburgh. 
In 2017, the Pittsburgh Police Bureau began a pilot program in conjunction with Metro 21, an interdisciplinary research initiative at Carnegie Mellon that seeks to use technology to address urban issues. This project in particular sought to use AI and machine learning to "reduce serious violent crime in Pittsburgh through prevention without increasing arrests by predicting locations — not individuals — at heightened risk of violent crime. Police patrol activity was then directed to those locations." The program was suspended in June of 2020 by then-mayor Bill Peduto, over concerns about lack of transparency in the algorithm and potential racial bias.  
An important lesson to gain from this is that work we do in STEM does not exist in a vacuum, and technological innovation without regard for societal context will simply reproduce the same injustices we should be trying to dismantle. Technology is not a silver bullet to solve injustice, it's merely a tool that we must be responsible with. Mayor Gainey's plan to add new cops to Downtown should remind us that Carnegie Mellon still exists in the community of Pittsburgh, and we should be conscientious about local events especially as it pertains to the impact of our work.

Ireland recently decided to require all alcoholic beverage containers sold in the country to have a health warning label similar to what is already on cigarettes (but without the pictures). This is part of Ireland’s plan to reduce alcohol abuse. While this caused a revolt in the Southern European wine-producing countries, I believe this decision is a step towards changing the culture of a country to be more healthy and for that reason should be pursued.
Ireland’s rationale is to reduce dangerous alcohol consumption behavior, which can cause a burden on the state. Diseases caused by alcohol consumption not only affect the person afflicted by them, but also their families and friends, and the society at large via the healthcare system that provides treatments. I have heard of multiple instances in the news of deaths of innocent people caused by someone driving under the influence of alcohol. Ireland has courageously called out alcohol as a danger to public health to protect its citizens from it. The country has already enforced minimum prices on alcoholic beverages to discourage consumption. This is a difficult statement to digest for countries that culturally like wine and have made wine production an important sector of their economies, like Italy, France, and Spain. They have perceived the Irish law as a direct attack on their culture, lifestyle, and heritage. I do come from a wine-loving and wine-producing country, and I can understand why such a reaction is taking place — we like good wine with good food, the wine aisles in supermarkets are very well stocked, and a bottle of wine is always a good gift to bring with when invited for dinner.
But science has started to show that even moderate alcohol consumption is not good: indeed, the World Health Organization has recently stated that “when it comes to alcohol consumption, there is no safe amount that does not affect health.” Such a statement again rocks all those countries that have made drinking alcohol a part of their core culture. We are living in an age where we pay more attention to our health (the pandemic has helped accelerate the process) and if alcohol is indeed dangerous for our health, then we should reconsider its cultural acceptance. This is hard, of course: cultures are engrained in people’s lives, and there is social pressure to abide by them. But I believe this update of culture is so essential for today’s world: for a bigger, more imminent problem such as climate change, for example, we can see that our consumption and travel habits are polluting and killing the planet. 
Even if it is hard because people can be so accustomed to it, drinking less alcohol can be beneficial to one’s health. Translating this personal change into a cultural one can be valuable for societies at large.

Editor's note: According to The Tartan style guide, we use the Oxford comma. This article has caused quite a stir in the office.
I want to thank my parents, Tom Brady and Jimmy Fallon. A sentence which obviously implies that my parents are a world famous quarterback and a talk show host, right? It’s grammatically incorrect, and it’s definitely something that needs to be criticized. Any reader would quickly assume that I was the progeny of two world famous people.
No. No they wouldn’t. That’s the obvious issue of the Oxford comma. It’s just… unnecessary half the time, and for most of the other half, we’re smart enough to figure out we don’t need it. Do I really need to put in a comma so people don’t think I’m Jimmy Fallon’s son? (P.S., Jimmy, if you see this, pay me your child support.) In a lot of written scenarios, the Oxford comma is just a piece of grammar meant to standardize things, but in a language like English, with so little standardization already, why bother?
And that’s not the long and short of it. The Oxford comma has problems when dealing with the one thing it’s supposed to handle — lists!
One of the problems with listing proper nouns next to improper nouns, is that confusion can start. Take a list like the following, "I met the landlady, the pastor, Mr. John, and Ms. Doe." There's a problem here. Is this four people, or is there 'Mr. John' an appositive phrase? Perhaps Mr. John is just a clarification on who the pastor is, but with this comma situation, it's also possible that Mr. John is another person. This is where the Oxford comma fails, it's made the sentence more complicated and harder to read. Here, I'd actually recommend people not use the oxford comma, because it makes things easier to understand.
The Oxford Comma is a tool, not a catchall. It also doesn’t really handle a situation where the latter part of the list is designed to elaborate on the first part of the list. “I am considering traveling to California, San Fran, or LA.” Does that sentence mean I’m planning on going to either California OR San Fran OR LA, or should I drop the comma and say I’m planning on traveling to San Fran OR LA in California? The Oxford comma is a small part of a language that is incredibly complicated, a small piece of linguistics that can be useful, but shouldn’t be considered the standard. We can decipher when we need to use the comma, versus when the reader can figure out that the list is not self descriptive.

In 2017, Louis CK got “canceled,” and for good reason. 
Five women, all of whom had worked with CK, came forward with sexual misconduct allegations. In the allegations, Louis CK was accused of repeatedly pressuring women — all of whom worked with or beneath him — into watching him masturbate. In some incidents, he did it without permission or over the phone. In others, he asked repeatedly until the victim gave in and agreed. 
Now he’s performing at a sold out Madison Square Gardens.
To be clear, these allegations have been proven; CK admitted in his response statement that these accusations were all true. In his response, he stated “The power I had over these women is that they admired me … and I wielded that power irresponsibly. … I will now step back and take a long time to listen.”
And by a long time, he meant approximately nine months because by 2018, he was back to performing. In 2020 and 2021, he began his “comeback” tour with two separate specials called “Sincerely Louis CK” and “Sorry” (and yes, there’s merch). In one of his sets, he even makes light of the allegations, joking about how he likes to jerk off and doesn’t like being alone, how he “likes to share.” And these shows were successful. CK won a Grammy for “Sincerely.”
So what’s the issue here? Personally, I don’t care about the cutesy titles or whether or not Louis CK performs again; he’s already outed himself as moral scum, anything else is just auxiliary evidence of what we already know. The problem is how much success we keep giving this man, and a problem that CK himself identified. The accomplishment and admiration granted from his career gives CK power to wield over the women he harasses. It’s a dynamic that we’re all well familiar with by this point: Big man in the seat of power with a woman beneath him. 
Those who maintain that as long as he’s funny, he deserves whatever success his comedic merit brings him are missing the point. We need to remember that by his own words, that success has been the key to his actions. We cannot separate the art from the artist’s sexual misconduct when the art allowed it to happen. 
Sure he’s apologized, he’s promised to think more critically about his actions, but as long as he continues winning Grammys and selling out massive stadiums, he’ll still always have that power, canceled or not.

Bed Bath and Beyond is a retail company that specializes in home goods and décor. They've been financially struggling for a while, and in recent months, have been aggressively downsizing by closing stores to avoid bankruptcy. Anecdotally, when I went to the Bed Bath and Beyond in Yonkers, New York, this past August, they didn't have any forks in the store. They've seen better days, it would seem. 
Because of this long, slow, decline they've been targeted by Private Equity firms and short sellers. Short sellers are investors who bet against the value of their stock — in other words, they profit when the value of the company goes down. This is done via various fun-sounding financial instruments like a "margin account," which are very exciting to talk about if you're into that sort of stuff. It's an extremely high-risk investment, and thus typically done by institutions like hedge funds which can stand to lose a couple million on a bad day (or rather on a good day, because recall that they profit when companies do poorly). Private equity firms, sometimes called Vulture Capitalists, purchase companies that are failing, drive them into the ground and sell the scrap for a profit. 
Since Bed Bath and Beyond is receiving lots of attention from these types of capitalists, a small community has developed with the aim of screwing over these short-sellers and firms. A righteous cause, no? Well, there are some very strange things about this community, and I think ultimately, making enemies of hedge funds doesn't automatically make you the good guys.  
The gathering point of this community is r/BBBY, a subreddit whose name refers to the stock ticker of Bed Bath and Beyond. They are an offshoot of r/WallStreetBets, a notorious community of meme stock traders and crypto enthusiasts who triggered the January 2021 GameStop fiasco. GameStop was in a very similar situation to where Bed Bath and Beyond currently is — a declining retailer preyed upon by short-sellers and vulture capitalists. WallStreetBets saw the potential of organizing a large group of individual investors and triggered a short squeeze.
A short squeeze happens when the value of falling stock suddenly goes up. The conditions upon which the short-sellers were relying have suddenly turned upside down, causing them to scramble to buy back the stock. This triggers a feedback loop, because the short sellers want to cover their losses as soon as possible, which only makes the value go up even more. So on and so forth until the meme stock traders who poured their life savings into GameStop get an absurd return on their investment as the stock hits stratospheric values. That's what these people on r/BBBY are praying for, and they'll fixate on any news that hints at a potential short squeeze. It worked once with GameStop, so why not again? But sometimes, reality kicks them in the teeth. 
At the start of this month, Bed Bath and Beyond missed an interest payment, a clear sign of their declining financial health. This was confirmed by the Wall Street Journal, although naturally the users of r/BBBY distrust large institutions. Some of them emailed Bed Bath and Beyond themselves to find the truth, and to no surprise the WSJ was proven right. The company had indeed missed their interest payments. This subreddit, whose information bubble is so tight it could suffocate you, reacted with unbelievable aggression towards, I need to emphasize, this completely factual piece of information. Instead of recognizing that the company is doing poorly, they instead started doubting the loyalty of these people who contacted Bed Bath and Beyond (many of whom were long-time posters). User u/ApeOfDiamondz argued, "If you don’t think people have posted here to get upvotes and become popular/trusted by the community, only to turn around and throw out massive FUD campaigns at the same time, you’re delusional." So they're having a pretty good day. FUD here refers to "Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt," three things entirely antithetical to their worldview. Their entire financial future revolves around the baseless hype that their meme stock will "Go to the Moon" and vindicate all of the time and money they've sunk into this fantasy. So even the smallest quantity of FUD is completely unacceptable. 
In fact, these redditors use enough mantras and in-group slang to make L. Ron Hubbard proud. Some of their favorites include "HODL" (Hold On for Dear Life), their constant reassurance to one another; "Diamond Hands," referring to an investor with unflinching revolve and high risk tolerance; "MOASS" (Mother Of All Short Squeezes); "Ape," a term of camaraderie (referring to the line "apes together strong" from Rise of the Planet of the Apes); and as if they couldn't get more childish, "tendies" is their term for money or assets (coming from a common 4Chan term for chicken tenders). It's very cultish, and when you hear these people communicating in their code-speak it's hard not to feel like that most of them just really need a group of friends.
Even if a short squeeze ends up happening, it won't change the fact that these people are living in a different information reality. They will come up with absurd conspiracy theories to ignore the very clear reality that BBBY might not actually go to the moon, and that their investment strategy is probably a terrible idea. It's even harder for them to accept this reality when they're part of a community that constantly reassures one another, "WAGMI" (We're All Gonna Make it). Plus, based on how frequently some of these users post to r/BBBY I really think they just enjoy belonging to a community. When your identity revolves around the terrible decision to invest in a meme stock, you're obviously gonna HODL like a good Diamond Hands because acknowledging the alternative is unthinkable.
This are extremely similar to crypto-trading communities (in fact, almost all of their slang comes from crypto spaces). Much like crypto, the issue with this community is that they seem to understand the fundamental unfairness of our financial system. They understand the perverse incentives of capitalism, and they observe how corporate executives and hedge fund managers reap immense profits by exploiting the markets. Their problem isn't that this is an unfair system — their issue is that they're not the ones who get to profit off that unfairness. To quote YouTuber Dan Olson, their only problem with capitalism is that "it doesn't provide enough opportunities to be the boot." They're trying to play the exact same game as the big-money Wall Street-types they despise, they're all just really dumb and bad at it.

Are we living through another Cold War? In replacement of the Soviets, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) have become our main adversary, and as the spheres of influence grow further and further apart, our hostility towards the CCP and theirs to our democracy grows likewise. The amount of nuclear warheads we have pointed towards each other only assures us that Mutually Assured Destruction lies close on the horizon unless something is done to attenuate such an event.
America, like every other nation on Earth, has a history of war and conquest, with periods of evil and shame. There are many peoples throughout the world that would may want to raise arms against the United States, and depending on the circumstances, I might not blame them. It is, however, possible for it to be true that America is both flawed and also one of the best countries to live in. Much of the world has understood this for generations, and many people, including my very own parents, came to this country for the sake of themselves and their children, because this very land was considered a sanctuary from the tyranny and corruption which plagued much of the world.
It is a complex topic, and one that I do not claim to fully understand, but I can see trends and patterns in history, and one that stands out is that when goodness doesn’t fill the vacuum of morality, evil will take its place. When America does not act to defend freedom, wickedness grows, as it has happened before. Take, for example, the Iranian hostage crisis in 1979, in which 59 American and Canadian diplomats were held hostage for 444 days. Then-president Jimmy Carter did not use force, but applied economic pressure via freezing Iranian assets and implemented a series of economic and diplomatic sanctions. Thus, the world saw America reduced down to a “paper tiger”, a term used by both Mao Zedong and Osama Bin Laden to describe the U.S. 
We saw it in 2021 when the United States withdrew from Afghanistan, where a country collapsed to terrorism upon gaining independence of our support. An entire generation of people, especially educated women, who have never experienced the oppression of extreme religious fundamentalism, suddenly had their rights stripped from them. Our adversaries are now willing to test U.S. aggression. The Taliban in Afghanistan, Russians in Ukraine, soon, it’ll be the Chinese in Taiwan if we do not stop this cycle of foregoing our allies for the sake of maintaining international peace. If the Munich Agreement taught us anything, it’s that there is no way to satisfy expansionist totalitarian regimes through concessions.
Just a few days ago, a Chinese spy balloon flew over the entire continental United States, and even after detection, the U.S. military refused to shoot down the craft. The balloon was originally spotted in Montana, the state harboring most of our nuclear arsenal, and made it all the way to North Carolina and the Atlantic Ocean before being terminated. High-ranking Chinese officials deny the balloon was used for intelligence, and are angered that a Chinese aircraft was downed in American airspace (as if we had any other choice).
The question that everyone must have on their minds is: How much will China push before the U.S. opposes them? It’s clear that America and the Biden administration are trying to keep safety and peace above all, but the price for that is freedom — maybe not for us, but our own allies. This is not an advocacy for a total military offensive, but rather a request that we look at the consequences of hesitant defensive actions and America’s refusal to stand up to our enemies’ unjust expansionism.
While it might seem hypocritical to say that America should both stand against expansionism and totalitarianism and also be involved in every foreign conflict whether our assistance is appreciated or not, the alternative to that, isolationism, is far worse. As the world's leading economic and military power, it is the duty of America to stand up for democracy, lest history repeat itself.

Novel-tea is The Tartan’s literary and language opinion column, so if you like hot takes and reading about cool ideas in the literary community then this is the place for you!! If you have your own hot take to add to this column, do not hesitate to contact us.
Valentine’s Day is coming up and that means… romance novels!!!! There are so many cute cozy novels coming out this year, so even if you’re single this Valentine’s don’t you worry! You can live vicariously through your favorite characters. Special for the holiday, I decided to do a little list for you all of some romance books I’m looking forward to in 2023:
Knives, Seasoning, and A Dash of Love by Katrina Kwan
Did someone say chef love story? Katrina Kwan’s new novel coming out on Dec. 19 is a book I’m expecting to leave us hungry for more. When a sous chef’s embellished resumé lands her a job with one of the most impressive chefs on the scene, she just wants to keep a low profile. However, that doesn’t seem to be in the cards for her and her new boss, who rules the kitchen with “an iron fist.” Spicy, sweet, and everything in between, this friends-to-enemies-to-lovers is exactly what we’ll need to end 2023.
The Neighbor Favor by Kristina Forest]
When a socially-awkward book-worm Lily Greene asks her cute neighbor to help her find a date to her sister’s wedding, she is completely unaware that he also happens to be her favorite fantasy author (who writes under a pen name). When he realizes Lily is the woman he’s become enamored with over email, he refuses to “complicate things,” agreeing to set her up with someone else, but who knows how long that will last? “The Neighbor Favor” is expected to be released on Feb. 28 and will be the perfect pick-me-up to a mid-semester reading slump.
Happy Place by Emily Henry
I am many things, and an Emily Henry girlie is in fact one of them. For those who could not get enough of  “Beach Read,” I’m sure this spring release date is making you crazy. “Happy Place” (expected publication April 25) features Harriet and Wyn, a couple who met in college and built their best friendships as a couple. However, when they break-up, they refuse to tell those same friends — which is how they end up sharing a bedroom at their friend group's summer getaway. Lying to their friends (and themselves), Harriet and Wyn are in for an eventful summer.
Lunar Love by Lauren Kung Jessen
Lauren Kung Jessen’s January release features a matchmaker who can’t seem to find herself a match. When her grandmother’s matchmaking business rooted in Chinese astrology is threatened by some new dating app, Olivia Huang Christenson is beyond furious. So, Liv and the app’s developer, Bennet O’Brien, decide to compete to find a match… for each other. What could go wrong?
Bonus Lit-fic Romance: Big Swiss by Jen Beagin
Unlike the others on this list, “Big Swiss” is lit-fic with a strong romantic plot which is basically my bread and butter. While it was only published a few days ago, Jen Beagin’s new novel immediately hit my TBR. Greta transcribes therapy sessions for a sex coach, not expecting to become enamored with one of his clients. She nicknames her Big Swiss and is fascinated by her outlook on life. When Greta recognizes Big Swiss’ voice at a dog park, she introduces herself with a fake name and they hit it off. Greta’s attraction to Big Swiss makes her ignore the ethics and guilt just to sustain the relationship. Goodreads reviewer Meike describes “Big Swiss” as following the Ottessa Moshfegh vibe of messed up female protagonists, so those of you who read my first novel-tea piece know that this sapphic lit-fic will be a must-read.
