It’s been about a month since the NBA season resumed, with 22 of the 30 teams reporting to a Disneyland sports complex that serves as a “bubble” from the coronavirus pandemic. So far, it has worked: as the remaining teams enter the second round of the playoffs, there are still no positive cases of COVID-19 in the bubble.
The eight remaining teams are as follows: the Boston Celtics, Milwaukee Bucks, Toronto Raptors, and Miami Heat in the East; The Los Angeles Lakers, Los Angeles Clippers, Denver Nuggets, and Rockets in the West.
The teams eliminated were not without exciting performances, perhaps the most impressive being the Mavericks’ young superstar Luka Doncic, who continues to prove he is capable of leading a team to the playoffs despite his youth. Even in the Game 6 loss to the Clippers that dropped them from contention, Doncic nearly triple-doubled, with 38 points, 9 rebounds, and 9 assists (not far from his average for the entire season). Earlier in the series, Doncic nailed a clutch buzzer-beater three pointer to secure a Game 4 win for the Mavs to keep them alive. On the Clippers side, superstar Kawhi Leonard was a consistent presence on both sides of the court, and Paul George went off for 35 points in a Game 5 blowout that helped seal the series. The Clippers will go on to face the Jazz in the conference semifinals. 
Jazz guard Donovan Mitchell has also had a phenomenal series despite losing to the Denver Nuggets; the Nuggets having ousted the Utah Jazz in a 7 game battle. In Game 1, Mitchell exploded for 57 points—the third-highest point total scored by one player in a playoff game. Despite this, Nuggets guard Jamal Murray doubled his point total in the last 20 minutes, and the bench came through for the Nuggets to take the first game. Mitchell was back for more in Game 2, dropping 30 points with help this time from teammate Jordan Clarkson who put up 26 himself. Defensive stud Rudy Gobert showed up on offense, which gave the Jazz a boost that allowed them to take Game 2. The Jazz went on to win the next two games led by two more stellar performances from Mitchell which included another 50 point game. Murray matched him the whole way, but in the end, it was the defense and Nuggets center Nikola Jokic’s clutch hook shot that put away the Jazz in a low-scoring and hotly-contested Game 7, 80-78. The Nuggets go on to face the Clippers in Round 2. 
The Clippers’ fellow LA team and rival, the Lakers, were also able to advance, knocking out the Portland Trail Blazers in a 131-122 Game 5 victory. In the team’s first playoff series win since 2012, Lebron James and Anthony Davis led the way to four consecutive wins after a Game 1 loss to Damian Lilliard and his Trail Blazers, culminating in a triple double from James and a playoff career-best 43 points from Davis in Game 5. They were able to lock it down on defense after allowing 34 points to Lillard in Game 1, who left in the third quarter of Game 2. Rising star Alex Caruso was also integral to an important Game 3 win to tip the scale in favor of LA. The Lakers go on to face the Rockets in the second round.
In perhaps the most exciting series of the entire first round, the Rockets were able to overcome the Thunder after a hard-fought series. The Rockets came out of the gates strong, with Harden dropping 37 points and the bench adding another 42. Houston forward Eric Gordon thrived in his replacement role, scoring 21 points, with 14 in the second quarter. The momentum carried into Game 2, when Houston's bench came through again despite a lackluster Harden for a 111-98 win. OKC came to play in Game 3 however, with four players scoring over 20 points, and a run of 12 straight points sealed the victory in OT. In another clutch situation, OKC point guard Dennis Schroder scored a late bucket to edge out the Rockets again in a 117-114 Game 5 win. The Rockets responded with a 34-point blowout as Westbrook returned and OKC faced two ejections in the third quarter. In Game 7, Harden was lacking on offense, but he made a game winning block at the end of the game to lead the Rockets into with a 104-102 win. 
In the East, the Celtics made quick work of the Philadelphia 76ers, sweeping them in four games with their young talent shining. Jaylen Brown and Jason Tatum both showed up big for Boston; averaging 21.5 points, 5.8 rebounds, and 2.5 assists; and 27 points, 9.8 rebounds, and 2.5 assists, respectively. Star guard Kemba Walker was able to bounce back from an unproductive first game, and center Enes Kanter provided lock-down defense that was key in all four wins. It wasn’t all good news for the Celtics, however, as they lost forward Gordon Hayward to an ankle sprain in Game 1. 
The Celtics will go on to face Toronto in the Eastern Semifinals, who themselves sweeped their quarterfinal opponent, the Brooklyn Nets. The Raptors controlled the series from the start, with a blowout 134-110 win under a spectacular game by guard Fred VanFleet. Toronto led for the entire game, but not in Game 2, where they trailed for the first three quarters before a clutch fourth quarter comeback. Defense won the Raptors Game 3, and they were able to close out the series in Game 4 despite missing star point guard Kyle Lowry.
In yet another Eastern Conference sweep, the Heat made quick work of the Indiana Pacers. Heat forward Jimmy Butler came up big in Game 1, notching 28 points and two clutch three-pointers that helped the Heat seal the opening victory. Butler was integral to the Game 2 victory as well, but he got some help from sophomore Duncan Robinson, who tied a franchise record with his 7-for-8 three-point shooting. The team’s 18 three-pointers were also a new franchise record. Another youngster, center Bam Adebayo, proved to be key in a nail biting Game 3 victory as he made clutch defensive plays and added 22 points, along with 11 rebounds. The theme continued in the fourth and final game of the series as rookie Tyler Herro led the Heat bench, which scored more than both the Heat starters and the Pacers Bench, to a 99-87 victory to end the series. The Heat are facing the Bucks in the second round. 
The Bucks put away the Magic in five games after a stunning Game 1 upset. All-star defensive player Eric Bledsoe and the Bucks clamped back down on defense, holding the Magic to just 96 points in Game 2. All-star Khris Middleton continued his slump, but superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo played well enough to cover for him, dropping 35 points and pulling down 11 rebounds in Game 3. He continued a stellar performance in Game 4, where Middleton finally came through with 18 points in the final quarter to overpower the Magic. The momentum carried into Game 5 when the Bucks were able to end the series with a 118-104 victory—that is, after their choice not to play because of the death of James Blake shifted the game three days later than originally scheduled. Other teams followed suit, and for a brief time it seemed the season was in jeopardy after a rumor that the Lakers and Clippers voted to boycott the entire season circulated. The season resumed, but the reason for the boycott remains at the forefront of the players and coaches minds, along with the entire country.

The COVD-19 pandemic continues to sweep through the nation, leaving thousands dead in its wake and forcing Americans to adapt to a new “normal”: one replete with face masks, social distancing, and obsessive sanitation. Yet as deadly and disruptive as the disease is, a quick search on the internet will reveal that Americans are incredibly divided over this issue. Some, understanding the risks of the disease and its implications for themselves and their loved ones, willingly follow the recommendations of public health officials. Others, frustrated at perceived infringements of their personal freedoms, refuse to wear masks and social distance, with some going as far as hosting COVID-19 parties
In this age of rampant misinformation, it is not surprising why Americans are so conflicted, and it does not help that COVID-19 has become such a politically charged topic that its status as a threat to public health and safety seems to have fallen by the wayside. With the ubiquity of social media and multimedia news networks, vectors for misinformation are numerous and constantly barrage people with dubious claims and fringe ideas. While we understand the danger of misinformation, quantifying its scope can give a better appreciation of just how serious of a problem it is.
A study this past May by Kathleen Carley and her research team in the School of Computer Science did just that, looking at the frequency of “bot” accounts on Twitter. After analyzing over 200 million tweets using powerful machine learning techniques, the data suggested that 82 percent of the top 50 most influential retweeters were bot accounts, and of the top 1,000 retweeters, 62 percent were bots. From these tweets, over 100 types of inaccurate COVID-19 stories were identified, such as pieces speculating about potential cures. Bots on their own already pose a threat, but humans aided by bots are more prevalent. In discussions around controversial topics like reopening America, bots on their own accounted for 34 percent of the tweets, but humans collaborating with bots accounted for the remaining 66 percent, indicating orchestrated efforts to sway the conversation. Not only this, but bots help circulate conspiracy theories about 5G causing COVID-19 or hospitals faking over-capacity by using mannequins. Twitter was the starting point, but the study has since been expanded to include other platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and Reddit.
One of the major benefits of social media platforms is that they democratize the exchange of information. However, without rigid fact-checking policies in place, it becomes all too easy to propagate misguided views through large populations, creating misinformed groups either inadvertently or, in the worst case, for an ulterior motive. And with the combined psychological stress of a pandemic and increased time spent online and on virtual platforms, people now are more susceptible to misinformation than in the past. Some social media platforms are taking proactive steps to try to combat the spread of misinformation, such as YouTube changing its algorithms to promote legitimate COVID-19 related videos and burying ones with potentially misleading claims, or WhatsApp implementing features to make it easier for users to get information from the World Health Organization. Whether these measures are effective at beating back the tide remains to be seen, especially against armies of bots.
As long as the pandemic continues to rage, so too will misinformation about the disease. For now, it is up to the consumer to fact-check any claims that they come across. Even though the thought of parsing through your daily feed sounds overwhelming, Carley remains optimistic, stating that average users can do a lot to protect themselves from bots. Simple tasks like inspecting accounts closely for mistyped links or mismatched names and profile pictures can go a long way towards sniffing out bots. [As for important information on the pandemic, always use authoritative or trusted sources. So, the next time you are scrolling through your Twitter feed, pay attention to the little details and treat everything you read with a healthy skepticism: that little bit of added vigilance could make a world of difference for you and your community.

On the morning of Aug. 31, a widely circulated photo of The Fence on campus sparked outrage among the student body. The Fence, which had been previously painted to say “Black Lives Matter” was defaced to read “All Lives Matter." “Black" had been crossed out in yellow paint.
According to The Fence rules, anyone who paints it must stand guard around the clock to prevent repainting, and if anyone is to paint the fence, they must paint it in its entirety. The defacing on Monday violated the rules, which means that it is an act of vandalism.
Following the incident, an email from Provost Jim Garrett and Vice President for Student Affairs Gina Casalegno went out to the campus: “The rules governing the Fence are upheld by members of the student body. As such, the university does not typically manage the Fence, or interfere with its content. This is not the first controversial message displayed on the Fence, and we are proud that our students have managed this situation in keeping with Carnegie Mellon’s culture and values.”
The email also added at the end “CMU believes and unequivocally affirms that Black Lives Matter.”
On the morning after the vandalism, The Fence was repainted swiftly by students, and on Monday night, dozens of students showed up to guard it. The Tartan reached out to some students who had gone back to repaint the fence, as well as some who stayed into the night to guard it. They all expressed their shock and disappointment at what had happened.
Ebi Indiamaowei, a freshman computer science major who helped repaint The Fence, explained how he was “holding his breath,” expecting something to happen to the Black Lives Matter message painted on the fence. Then it did.
“It was in the back of my head that I wouldn’t be surprised if someone did something to [The Fence], but the longer it was up there the more I was surprised. So when it happened on my first day, I felt really disappointed,” Indiamaowei told The Tartan.
Sheldon Yawson, a Dietrich College sophomore and a resident assistant at Stever who also helped repaint The Fence, echoed those sentiments, and added the effect it had on her.
“When I first saw it, it confirmed what I knew was already true,” Yawson said, “the microaggressions against Black students, the idea you don’t belong on campus because of the color of your skin.”
Melina Castillo, a freshman ECE major, said she didn’t expect such an overt act of “bias and discrimination” on campus. She also added that “with painting the fence, it wasn’t just one person. It was probably a group. I fear that I walk by these people every day not knowing who they are.”
During the night, students also put up 107 Black Lives Matter signs around campus, including one sign that read “why is it on us and not the administration?” A number of other signs read “Poor Black Lives Matter,” “Black Engineers Matter,” and “Black Fathers Matter.” The rest carried similar messages.
Students also spoke strongly of their disappointment at the administration’s emailed response.
Twain Byrnes, a CIT first-year, told The Tartan they would “be staying all night to guard the fence and possibly into the future until CMU creates some sort of solid response to this incident with an actual action plan.” Many students who were there also expressed their disappointment and anger at what they considered a “lackluster response.”
Yawson felt the response was a cop out.
“They basically sat around all morning and thought 'What’s the easiest thing we can do that people don’t blame us fully, but so that we don’t have to do the work to prove that Black lives matter on campus,'” she said.
Yawson also added, “when I first came to campus, I was under the assumption that if you violated the fence rules then there would be significant punishment, but now the fence rules are broken for hate speech and for a hate crime, and their response was just ‘Well some people repainted the fence and yeah Black lives matter,’ which is how it read to me”
Indiamaowei felt his perception of the school had been changed after their response.
“If the kids had put a swastika on it, there would be no issue, the consequences would have been swift and immediate and there wouldn’t even be a conversation about it. That’s the kind of energy I was hoping the school would have, and when there wasn’t, I was really disappointed.”
The student discourse has been largely rife with calls for the university to take action to attempt to find the perpetrators responsible.
Yawson pointed out, “CMU can’t have it both ways. If CMU can’t go after the person who broke the fence rules, and that’s ok by CMU standards, then why have the rules in the first place?”
Indiamaowei felt that Carnegie Mellon should do more to investigate “a hate crime,” adding that “saying something like Black Lives Matter isn’t something they should just say, they have to earn it. Even if they get flack in the news for ‘being too liberal,’ the university should actually enforce its ideals and put their money where their mouth is.”
The Tartan reached out to the Carnegie Mellon police department for comment, and a spokesman from the university responded, saying “CMU Police does not anticipate any action because there are no security cameras on the Fence, and in the absence of a witness coming forward, there is no avenue of inquiry to pursue at this time.”
After the publishing of this article, an email went out to the campus from President Jahanian which addressed the incident and announced an investigation into it. At this time, it is our understanding that Carnegie Mellon Police still have" no avenue of inquiry." The headline has been update to reflect the situation.

The student government executive committee has had a busy first week. They dealt with the controversial vandalism at The Fence, as well as allegations that they had been pressured by administration to approve reductions to the student activities fee without approval from their respective legislative bodies, alongside the typical beginning-of-year initiative launches. In an interview with The Tartan, Govind Menon, Student Body President, Liam O'Connell, Undergraduate Student Senate Chair, and Josh Gyory, Graduate Student Assembly President, explained their plans and priorities moving forward.
Campus was rocked on the first day of classes after an unknown vandal changed the message on The Fence from “Black Lives Matter” to “All Lives Matter,” with "Black" crossed out. The response to the incident started with a Monday Zoom meeting initiated by SPIRIT. According to Menon, over 150 students were in attendance. “We were able to listen to some of the concerns and what the student body is really wanting at this moment in time,” he said, “we got a lot of good insights and ways that we could help from that meeting.” 
Later, the executive committee sent out an email to campus Sept. 3, with the subject line “We MUST Do Better.” In the email, they condemned the vandalism as “ a clear display of hate speech and intolerance towards the Black community,” (emphasis in original). They pledged to take appropriate measures “to ensure that an incident like this cannot take place again,” and to work toward a campus that is “actively anti-racist.”  
Since the email went out, the student government executive has met informally to discuss actions, but they have had difficulty enforcing the existing graffiti and postering policy. As O’Connell put it, “this incident is really complicated by the fact that it took place on The Fence… if this [vandalism] was done on a wall or on a sidewalk, I think it would be very, very clear cut.” 
As of now, the rules that govern The Fence are essentially unofficial, existing outside of student government or university enforcement. “We, as students, can probably name several rules that we think govern the fence,” O'Connell said, but, “a lot of those rules are not codified at all, and aren't in the graffiti and postering policy.”
Because The Fence has been governed mainly by tradition rather than student government or university policy, the “main ideal that we’re all striving toward,” as Menon put it, is to codify the traditions into the postering policy in the student handbook. He added, however, “while we may be leading this effort, I don't think it's fair for us to make these decisions on our own... we really want to get community engagement and feedback on this process, because it's a student tradition. All students and community members should have insight on this.”
Menon says that The Fence incident, alongside the nature of this past summer, has changed his policy approach for this year. Many of the policy proposals he and Emma Cohron, Student Body Vice President, ran on were “very internally focused,” Menon said. Their priorities have now shifted toward collaboration with the “Undergraduate [Student] Senate and the Graduate Student Assembly to collectively try and pursue the goals that students have,” in order to better demand “accountability from the administration.” 
Some efforts that Menon and Cohron have started this summer include the launch of a student government newsletter, actions to make “CMU PD more transparent,” as well as “working with students to raise money for Black Lives Matter” and getting “administration to match that crowdfunded total.” They’ve also begun talks with student governments across the country to “form a national coalition for the exchange of resources,” and in the future, pursue a “lobbying arm in Congress to actually bring about some sort of meaningful change at a national level,” Menon said. 
Another major effort, Gyory added, has been the pursuit of a university-wide book club, with a focus on “racism on campus, which is a really sensitive and critical topic right now.” They’re currently working with the Provost’s office to try to get the program funded. The book club’s first text will be Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents, from Pulitzer-prize winning journalist Isabel Wilkerson.
O’Connell stated that the Undergraduate Senate’s “first and largest priority right now is really just making sure that the undergraduate body has the resources they need for this semester.” To try and ensure that all Carnegie Mellon undergraduates are on “equal footing in terms of access to resources,” O’Connell said, Senate is “using some of our funding to provide funding for undergraduate students who have to pay [for things like] software or art supplies.”
The executive committee also stuck to their decisions to approve a reduction to the student activities fee after The Tartan published an op-ed from Peter Tschofen alleging that Gina Casalegno pressured them to act without approval from their legislative bodies. “I wouldn't say she pressured us,” Gyory said, “there was a tight deadline, so I guess that's where the ‘pressure’ came from.” After the Board of Trustees had approved a ceiling for the student activities fee, Casalegno went to the executive committee and recommended a reduction in the fees to address “the uncertainties of the semester and potentially help students feeling any financial burden,” according to Gyory. He stands by the decision to reduce the fee, adding that the GSA reevaluated their budget over the summer, slashing “large budget items” such as events that were no longer possible due to the ongoing pandemic. The reduced fee, which results in a smaller pool of funding for student organizations, still maintains “pretty high flexibility for student organizations and departments to utilize funds this semester,” Gyory said. “I think it's still gonna be tricky, but we did keep that in mind when we lowered [the fee].”
O’Connell agreed, saying “I don’t think this was a situation of pressure.” He explained that the Undergraduate Senate had “heard from students that it would only be fair to have a student activities fee that was more reflective of the level of activity that would really be able to take place on campus.” No vote was held on the fee reduction in either body, but as Gyory said, there was a “large discussion” at a summer GSA general body meeting before they got back to Casalegno with their decision. O’Connell noted that the Undergraduate Student Senate doesn’t have “any kind of functioning going on over the summer,” so for this decision, the seven-member executive committee of the Undergraduate Student Senate met to gather feedback. The decision was decidedly “not unilateral,” O’Connell said.
“This year is going to be really important for us,” O’Connell stated, adding that student government has “real challenges that have to be faced.” 
“All of our collective priority going forward is making sure that people have or are on equal footing this semester, even though we're all remote, and also providing some urgency to the school's efforts into our own efforts relating to diversity, equity and inclusion,” O’Connell said. “Our job should be to really, you know, push very hard towards those both.”

As a student with a disability, I thought this would be a helpful exercise for me to reflect. Still, I hope that honestly sharing my experience can at least help one person, one little bit, for just one moment.
I was asked to share my experience because there seem to be lower rates of requested disability accommodations for others of my ethnicity and background. According to the Office of Disability Resources at Carnegie Mellon, “the number of students that haven't turned in (disability) documentation is highest” for students of my ethnicity and background.
However, I do not share my experience as a representation of my ethnicity group, nor as an explanation as to why in this particular context, people of my background struggle to ask for help. I share this experience in the perspective of an angry, fearful, ashamed young man. In many ways, I am still that young man. But in many ways, I wonder if I am more than that.
For as long as I can remember, people always seemed to give me sideways glances. It felt like people looked down on me, that they were laughing at me, and that I was the perpetual butt of all jokes. I was always on my toes, looking over my shoulder and questioning the relationships in my life, asking myself if my loved ones were secretly threats. It made sense that my friends were all fakes, my family didn’t really care about me, my girlfriends were just using me. If I were to look back on my life and describe the strongest, most persistent feelings I felt, I think it would be a tie between anger, fear, and shame. 
I was viciously angry. After all, everyone else seemed to find joy in living their lives, and I felt robbed of any positive emotion. I demanded perfection from myself, and when I couldn’t achieve my impossible expectations, I took it out on myself and others. I felt that it was me against the world, and I felt that anyone that seemed to enjoy my company was falling for my masks and tricks, that they were fools for believing I was worth liking. Even worse, the people that disliked me were evidence of my worthlessness. I internalized their negative opinions of me as facts. And, like gasoline, it fueled my self-hatred. It’s no surprise that an acquaintance from high school described me to my friend as “this guy just always looked really angry.”
But underneath my shield of anger was a deep, burning fear. Why did that person leave me; is it because I am worthless? What if I’m really just defective? What if because I am defective, I will never deserve love and affection? What will the future hold for me, if I am destined to be alone? These questions plagued my mind, and my fear of the future muddled my thinking and behavior. I began to use drugs and alcohol, romantic relationships, and anything to stuff down the impending, omniscient, persistent fear.
My behavior left me in desperate shame. I didn’t understand why my Saturday nights always ended with me in handcuffs and in the hospital. I didn’t understand why, in a school with some of the most brilliant, talented, and hardworking individuals, I was walking around with a black eye from the night before after getting stumbling-drunk and violently throwing fists at my peers. 
At the end of the day, I was a slave. Once swearing to myself that I would never use drugs or drink, I found myself sleeping with a dab pen under my pillow and liquor on my nightstand. The very last thing I would do before I drifted off to sleep was get high and drunk, and the very first thing I would reach for in the morning was not my phone but the bottle. Who was I? How could I be so worthless? When, if ever, will this end?
One day, on April 23, 2018, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I said goodbye to my friends that I blamed and took for granted, to my girlfriend that I resented, and to my family that I felt I had disappointed. I brought my student ID so that I could take the bus to downtown Pittsburgh, my credit card in case I wanted to get something to eat beforehand, and my driver’s license so that they could identify my body. I didn’t want to die, but I couldn’t take the pain anymore.
I took the elevator down to the lobby of Morewood Gardens, hitting my dab pen the entire way down. I walked off the elevator, and into the lobby, accepting that I wouldn’t be back. The 67 bus to downtown was coming in one minute, so I had better get to the bus stop soon. On my way out, I passed by three police officers rushing past me to get onto the elevator. They looked like they were in a hurry. 
It was a Sunday, so when I got onto the bus, I was alone. I sat at the very back, where the bus driver couldn’t see me, and I started to cry uncontrollably. I cried all the way down.
Around the time the bus was coming up to the skyscrapers in downtown Pittsburgh, I thought about those police officers I had seen in the lobby. Then, it hit me. Did someone call those police officers to come get me? Did someone actually care whether I lived or died?
So after returning to campus via a 61C bus, I called campus police and found myself in Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic for the next eight days.
I think about April 23, 2018 pretty often. To think, if those police officers came two minutes earlier, they would’ve busted into my dorm room and hauled me off to the hospital themselves. Then, maybe a month or two later, I would’ve left a little quieter. If they had come two minutes later, well, it would’ve been too late. Instead, I passed those police officers in the lobby of Morewood Gardens exactly as they were about to get on the elevator. Sometimes, I wonder if I am nothing more than just damn lucky. Other times, when I think about the people in my life that care about me, and whether or not I deserve their love, I wonder if I am more than that.
My bipolar I disorder doesn’t define me, but it has shaped me into the person I am today. In the end, I am just one person with a sum total of one person’s experiences. I can’t tell you why you should or shouldn’t go to disability resources to ask for accomodations for your classes. That simply isn’t for me to decide for you. What I can say is that if getting disability resources will keep you one iota away from rock bottom, then get those accommodations. Life is too short and too fragile to risk it.
