The Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team took the court on Saturday for the final contest of the season against conference rival Case Western Reserve University. The Tartans fought valiantly, but could not overcome the Spartans and fell with a score of 93–87. The loss ends the Tartans’ season with a 10–15 record, 3–11 in University Athletic Association (UAA) play.
The game opened with explosive offensive play from both sides, and the first half saw the lead change eight different times. The teams went back and forth for the majority of the half, trading fouls and points until it seemed no team would come out ahead. Junior forward Jack Serbin made the difference for the Tartans. Serbin finished a lay up with three minutes to play in the half to keep the Tartans up until the break. Serbin took control of the court, scoring 22 points in the first half alone and shooting 9 for 13 from the floor. Serbin’s massive performance sent the Tartans into the locker room with a 42–40 advantage.
The second half proved less than ideal for the Tartans, but it started with a bang. Carnegie Mellon opened the half on a 14–2 scoring run over five minutes. Five different Tartans contributed to this run, and the Tartans were gaining momentum as they found themselves up 60–48 with just over 12 minutes left to play. But the Spartans would not be silenced, and answered with a comeback of their own, scoring 11 of their next 13 points, cutting the Tartans lead to 3, 62–59. 
The Tartans pushed back again, increasing their lead to double digits with seven minutes left to play as junior guard Matt Hillman hit a jumper. The score was 74–63 at this point, and the Tartans felt in control. That feeling didn’t last long however, and the Spartans quickly responded with a 14–3 scoring run of their own to tie the game at 77. The game clock ticked down, and the Spartans drained a three-pointer with just over a minute left in the game to give the visitors the lead for good.
The Tartans fought to the end, shooting 48.4 percent from the floor to the Spartans 38 percent. Serbin led all players in scoring with 36 points and tied his own season-best record with 18 rebounds. The junior closed out the season with 24 double-doubles, and scoring 20 or more points in seven games.
The Tartans may not have reached all of their goals for the year, but it was definitely a season to remember. Carnegie Mellon won their first four games, but could never manage to win consistently after that. The rest of the season was plagued by loss streaks, but the Tartans were resilient and always found a way to pull themselves out of a rut. Even in conference play, the Tartans upset a very strong University of Rochester team in double overtime to remind themselves that they can still compete with the best, even if their record does not show it. Serbin was an anchor for the Tartans this season, averaging 18.4 points per game. He scored 460 total points with 161 field goals made, shooting 42.5 percent from the field. Sophomore guard Ryan Maha has also been a force for the Tartans this season, scoring 295 pints of his own on 109 field goals. Maha shot 44.5 percent from the floor for the season. 
The entire Tartan squad made this season possible, and they will be looking forward to improving in the offseason and coming back with a vengeance in the fall.

The Carnegie Mellon women’s basketball team played their season finale against Case Western Reserve University on Saturday. The Tartans finished the season with an 83–49 victory, closing out the season 19–6 overall and 8–6 in the University Athletic Association (UAA) play.
After Case Western got the first few points and the Tartans made one foul shot, senior guard Lindsay Poss got the first three-point field goal for the Tartans. After a Spartan miss, the Tartans got the ball to junior center and forward Lisa Murphy quickly, taking the lead for the first time in the game. Case Western tried to play catch up, but the Tartans kept finding ways to get the ball to Murphy under the basket. After senior forward Liza Otto made the game 8–7, the Tartans never relinquished the lead, though the Spartans continued to try and challenge the Tartans for it. By the end of the first quarter, the Tartans had racked up a 21–12 lead.
In the second quarter, the Spartans committed three straight turnovers as the Tartans continued to build their lead. Though Case Western was able to score several shots afterward, Murphy continued to make baskets for the Tartans, taking advantage of aggressive Spartan defense by drawing fouls. Her 16 points during the quarter gave the Tartans a comfortable margin, attracting more attention during the points in the game when she outscored the entire Spartan team. As Case Western tried to tighten up against Murphy, several Tartans were able to take advantage of the distraction by driving for layups, keeping the Spartan defense off balance as the Tartans entered halftime with a 44–26 lead.
In the third quarter, the Spartans tightened up their defensive play during the time when Murphy was given time to rest on the bench. However, Tartan offensive production continued to keep the Spartans at bay, ending up with a 64–42 lead.
The fourth quarter saw the Tartans continue to dominate against the Spartans. Murphy continued to play at a high level, bowing out when victory became certain as the spotlight shifted to Poss and Otto in their final regular season game.
The Tartans shot 53.3 percent from the floor and held the Spartans to a 27.1 percent effort. Carnegie Mellon also earned more rebounds, marking 53 in comparison to Case Western’s 30. The Tartans’ 13 offensive rebounds led to 19 second-chance points. Murphy finished with 36 points, just one point below her career high. With 12 rebounds in the game, she also obtained her 13th double-double of the season. Otto closed the game with 17 points, eight rebounds and five assists. Poss added 16 points for the Tartans.
The Tartans have definitely had a season to remember. Though the team had gone through a stretch of losing six conference games in nine tries, the Tartans remained resilient, closing out the season with strong wins against Emory University, the University of Rochester, and Case Western. Serving as a beacon during good times and bad, Murphy has been the dominant force for the Tartans, commanding the attention of opposing teams all season long with her team leading 23.7 points per game, despite never having attempted a three-point field goal in her career. Murphy’s season totals include 592 points scored, 228 field goals made, and 75.2 percent in field goal percentage, breaking her previous marks in these categories. Her 136 free throws came close to matching her best last year, and her 173 free throw attempts came close to matching her first-year production.
Junior Jackie Hudepohl has also been a strong player for the Tartans at guard. Averaging 15.2 points per game and making 76.8 of her shots, Hudepohl has performed excellently week in and week out. Otto and Poss have both done well this season, performing as consistently as they have during their collegiate careers. First-year guard Jenn Mayberger looks to be a strong force for the Tartan defense going forward.
The Tartans now await their playoff fate as they hope to compete for the 2016 NCAA Division III Women’s Basketball Championship.

With the Carnegie Mellon women’s basketball team putting up a fight in the University Athletic Association (UAA) this season, the dominant play of junior star center Lisa Murphy cannot go unnoticed. In a season where Murphy leads the nation in field goal percentage and has led in points per game at times during the season, the Tartan side looks hard to beat. 
Murphy’s experiences go beyond her talent for finding the net in a Carnegie Mellon basketball game. At Carnegie Mellon she has had the pleasure of working at a high level, both on and off of the field, and her teammates cannot be overlooked either. On the court, Murphy has been a force, earning two Division III National Player of the week awards as she has averaged over 23 points a game. With a jaw dropping field goal percentage of 75.2 percent, Murphy explains that her success this season really comes from two different places. Her teammates’ high level of play has been hugely important, along with her improving preparation, which is facilitated by her coach’s efforts. 
Playing well as a team has been a huge deal both for Murphy and the team as a whole. “My personal success is due to the team, if that makes sense; I mean I couldn’t be doing what I’m doing without everyone else … I’m just standing there, and they’re passing me the ball, I’m not doing anything fancy.” As Murphy points out, as a center, it’s much easier for her to put the ball in the basket when she has the ball right where she needs it to drop it in.
From a preparation standpoint, coach Jacquie Hullah has brought new strategic initiatives that have gotten the team more and more competitive every year since she joined the program. This past year in practice, Murphy explains that the team, “would count points based on defensive stops, instead of offensive scores, which really made us focus more on the defensive end of the ball and really make us take more pride in defense.” Murphy has also found herself watching a lot more film this season, which has doubly helped her play on the court by giving her information on her opponents, and improving her ability to get information from the film.
Balancing the game with outside life can absolutely be a challenge, but Murphy feels it is a healthy one with benefits. Of course her friendships with her teammates make the struggle much less stressful. “I’ve met my best friends on the team so, in that sense, being on an athletic team is just a great way to make friends, and a great support system.”
Murphy discusses the challenge of a very busy sequence of play at the start of spring semester, where the team is playing two UAA games per weekend. With so much time away, the team has a lot of work to do, but doesn’t miss the opportunity to enjoy the trips together. ”We love Catch Phrase and that’s kind of our go to game on the road.  But also we’ll go to other people’s house and do it. We challenged the men’s team once; we won, of course.”
Part of Murphy’s choice to attend Carnegie Mellon over a few potential NCAA Division I basketball programs was the commitment to education displayed by the school.  Murphy, a psychology major, works hard to excel in school work and devotes even more time outside of school to her interests. Twice a week, Murphy goes over to the Children’s Institute of Pittsburgh in Squirrel Hill where she interns and works with an autism class there. She has also had the opportunity to work at the children’s school on Carnegie Mellon’s campus.
Part of what has been great about Carnegie Mellon, from Murphy’s perspective, is the opportunity to balance commitments. “Luckily at the Division III level you have the ability to get a really well rounded education, so it hasn’t been much of an issue.” Clearly, Murphy has had a season to impress, and there is no question she, and her teammates, are showing they are in the right place to make a statement.
The Carnegie Mellon women’s basketball team wrapped up UAA play on Saturday with an 83–49 demolition of Case Western Reserve University to secure 3rd place in the UAA.

Republicans had their turn to caucus for their candidate in Nevada, but the chaos that ensued delayed results from coming out for quite some time. Far more people than expected tried to get into caucus sites, generating widespread confusion as some people ran out of ballots, while others voted multiple times. In the end, businessman Donald Trump took his third contest in a row, garnering 45.9 percent of the vote.
Trump has taken command of the Republican field, especially after capturing every delegate in South Carolina. His frontrunner status has begun to wear down establishment opposition to his candidacy. On Wednesday, Representatives Duncan Hunter (R-CA) and Chris Collins (R-NY) became the first sitting members of Congress to endorse Trump. On Friday, an endorsement from New Jersey Governor Chris Christie broke the narrative of Trump’s poor debate performance on Thursday.
Trump’s victory should be particularly disquieting to Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), who finished with 21.4 percent of the vote. The Nevada caucus marks the second time in a row that Trump won the evangelical vote, a voting bloc that normally votes for the most conservative candidate. It seems like these conservative voters are turning to Trump’s ultimate anti-establishment campaign despite his less-than-consistent conservative record. Although Cruz leads in his home state of Texas, he definitely does not want a scenario akin to Newt Gingrich during the 2012 primary, who only won his home state of Georgia and South Carolina.
Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) finished ahead of Cruz with 23.9 percent of the vote. Despite former Florida governor Jeb Bush dropping out of the race and Ohio Governor John Kasich not even bothering with Nevada, Rubio has not managed to corral moderate Republicans looking for a pragmatic candidate who can win the November election. Although he had a strong debate performance against Trump, it seems unlikely to flock away from Trump based on that debate given the lack of such dropout following any of Trump’s debate performances.
As Super Tuesday approaches, Trump has a lead in almost all the states that will be up for grabs come March 1. His strong performance so far in the primaries has led some to consider him a strong candidate for the general election, chipping away at one of Rubio’s main points of contention. Helmut Norpoth, a  political science professor at Stony Brook University, has used a statistical model that predicts Trump would have a 97 percent chance of winning the general election should he become the nominee. First reported in The Statesman, the model, which is based on primary results and patterns in the cycle, has matched the result of every presidential election since 1912, with the exception of the 1960 presidential election. In contrast, the model asserts that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would defeat Rubio and Cruz with 55 percent certainty, and Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) would have a 40 percent shot to win against the Republican senators.
Norpoth’s prediction may change, but it does not look like Trump will go away soon. Perhaps a brokered convention may be the last option for the senators to try and overtake Trump, but wary voters may want to coaelsce around the frontrunner and avoid a protracted fight.

The rapidly approaching U.S. presidential election has candidates brawling harder than ever for the Democratic nomination. Last week, candidates fought to win over South Carolina voters before the weekend’s primaries.
The Democratic Party has produced two very distinct candidates: Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Both Sanders and Clinton are backed by massive groups of polarized supporters, each pushing hard for their candidate’s nomination.
On Feb. 23, four days before the primary, Sanders and Clinton arrived in Columbia, South Carolina for CNN’s Democratic Town Hall.
Sanders began the town hall by stressing the first difference between his campaign and Clinton’s: campaign donors.
This January alone, Sanders raised $20 million from a record breaking 770,000 individual contributors. Each individual contribution averaged to about $27.
Clinton, on the other hand, accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from corporations. Clinton’s top campaign donors include Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, and Morgan Stanley.
To open, Sanders called upon Clinton to release transcripts of the paid speeches she made to Wall Street banks, a request she had previously avoided answering.
Sanders also emphasized that he had never received such donations. He added, “I am happy to release all of my paid speeches to Wall Street — here it is,” and motioned towards an empty space and said, “there ain’t none.”
Clinton curbed the request again, maintaining that she would only release her transcripts if other candidates released theirs as well. She then asserted that the pressing issue was not the issue of the transcripts, but of which candidate presents the best plan to regulate Wall Street.
Most notably, Sanders and Clinton differed in the way they spoke about racial issues in the United States.
Sanders emphasized the need of reform in the criminal justice and education systems. He advocated for increased funding for historically black colleges and universities.
Clinton instead retold stories from the audience. She recognized a group of women from the audience who lost children because of police brutality and gun violence, addressing broader issues affecting the country.
She urged white voters to recognize “that [their] experiences may not equip [them] to understand what a lot of our African-American fellow citizens go through every single day
Clinton’s message appears to have hit home. She managed to receive the support of 86 percent of black voters. Since 61 percent of voters in the primary were black, that was sufficient to clear the necessary threshold without supporters of any other race. Clinton was competitive among non-black voters as well, though, and cruised to a 50 point walloping of Sanders. 61 percent of Sanders’ supporters were white, which put a low ceiling on Sanders support in a state where white voters made up 35 percent of voters. Clinton took 39 of the 53 pledged delegates up for grabs.

In what might have been the most heated debate yet, Republican presidential hopefuls once again took to the stage last Thursday to vie for their party’s nomination. Even though there are still five candidates left, the main show was Senators Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Marco Rubio (R-FL) and their attacks on reality television show host Donald Trump. Neurosurgeon Ben Carson and Ohio Governor John Kasich were present, but were too mild-mannered to really make a splash.
Until this debate, Cruz and Rubio had refrained from attacking Trump. However, with the primary season moving along, the two runners-up need to make their moves now if they want a chance to overtake Trump.
Rubio was the most successful, shaking off his past image as someone who just reads lines (sometimes reading the same line multiple times). The Florida senator was constantly harassing Trump, asking hard questions about the businessman’s past. Accusations that ranged from using illegal immigrants to work on the Trump Tower, to claiming that Trump just repeats empty phrases — a little ironic coming from Rubio, who repeated himself at the last debate.
As expected, Trump denied all charges and jabbed back at Rubio. In response to hearing that he had hired undocumented workers, he said he was the only person on the stage who had hired anyone, period. Trump made sure to point out the irony of the repetition.
Cruz attacked Trump as well, but was far behind Rubio in both quantity and quality of zings. Still, he was more of a presence on stage than either Carson or Kasich.
The last two were merely sideshows to the main attraction, both literally and figuratively. While Trump stood between Cruz and Rubio, Kasich and Carson were on the edges, occasionally dipping into the fray before quickly being shouted down. Despite their shared lack of participation, they went about it in different ways. Carson asked if he could be attacked as well, hoping for some more action, while Kasich explicitly refused to make comments regarding his opponents, attempting to stay above the mud-slinging.
That might be the most striking outcome of this debate: not who “won” or “lost,” but that the quality of discourse has fallen to shouting matches. Once during the debate, the closed-captioning registered “unintelligible yelling,” and that sums up the tone and substance of the night.
While some serious issues were discussed (or rather, briefly mentioned), and personal histories are important aspects of a candidate, most of the time was spent in a shouting match between the top three potential nominees. Trump has been attracting voters with his bluster, and Rubio and Cruz were trying to match that hot air with their own.
While the debate was spirited, it might not make much of a difference to voters. Trump, Rubio, and Cruz all performed well, and drew on their strengths. Nothing new was added to the race — except perhaps Rubio’s ability to think on his feet — and voters will likely already be set in their opinions of the candidates.
As the race continues, there will be three more debates, on March 3, 10, and 21. If Republican voters haven’t decisively picked a nominee by then, the race might turn into a messy fight at the national convention.

Most countries in the world mandate paid family leave for new parents so they have time to spend with their babies before returning to a life at the office. America, however, has a strong business culture that often avoids mandates that can constrict the freedom of entrepreneurs. America is moving away from such a strict mindset, though, and paid family leave is slowly but surely becoming a popular bipartisan issue. Candidates are split on how and if the federal government should mandate paid family leave.
Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson
Carson is largely opposed to government mandates, so it is likely that he is against mandated family leave. However, this is purely speculation and Carson does not seem to have mentioned the issue.
Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX)
Cruz has spoken very highly about the value of paid family leave. However, Cruz thinks that federal mandates are generally a bad idea and believes that paid family leave is not unique.
Ohio Governor John Kasich
Kasich has said that paid family leave will  hurt equal pay and opportunity for women because it will cause employers to be skeptical about how productive women will be compared to men who would not go on paid family leave (it’s unclear how he feels about parental leave for all parents, however). Kasich believes it is a better strategy to create flexibility for new mothers to work at home and online so they can spend time with their newborn infants. He believes this reduces the workload enough to allow parenting to be the foremost obligation in a person’s life, without hurting their ability to get equal access to jobs and fair wages.
Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL)
Rubio believes mandates are counterproductive, however, he would institute a massive tax credit for offering paid family leave. The credit would cover 25 percent of leave for up to 12 weeks and $4,000 per employee. He believes stricter mandates will hurt equal employment opportunities for women, while a tax credit will help to provide family leave without imposing major costs on business. Rubio’s tax credit fits with a theme of his campaign where he uses tax relief as a carrot rather than outright spending on programs.
Recipient of a small loan of a million dollars Donald Trump
Trump has said that people are people are discussing paid leave, but ought to use caution because the American economy has to be competitive. Trump has not been more specific about his ideas on paid family leave.
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton
Clinton has a three part plan for paid leave. The first part of her plan is to guarantee up to 12 weeks of paid leave for both family and medical reasons. This gives new parents adequate time to spend with their children before returning to work. The second part is to ensure at least two thirds wage replacement, preventing this from being a major loss for businesses. The third part is a promise to tax the wealthy instead of the middle class and has little to do with family leave.
Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT)
Sanders has pushed legislation on the Senate floor to raise the payroll tax by $1.61 to guarantee 12 weeks of paid leave for all citizens. His plan would cover leave and does not seem to have caps for wage replacement.
The payroll tax increase would fund wage replacement for new parents.

The first truly large scale test of the 2016 presidential candidates’ appeal, Super Tuesday, is upon us. With most of the votes happening in the south, the event has often been called the “Southeastern Conference (SEC) Primary,” but a primary in Massachusetts and caucuses in Colorado, Vermont, North Dakota, Alaska, Minnesota, and some American territories will also contribute to the largest single day delegate windfall of the calendar. The outcomes of the day will likely spell doom for several candidates who underperform, but a few upsets can revive the candidacies of some of the struggling candidates. There are several key states that will determine the rest of the race.
Colorado
Colorado is one of a number of caucus states that Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) hopes will revive his candidacy which is flailing after a brutal defeat in South Carolina. Colorado is a swing state in general elections, but the Democrats can lean very far left in primaries. Furthermore, the caucus environment favors Sanders, with his strong grassroots movement rife with activists, as opposed to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Current polling has the candidates about tied in the state, and a Sanders victory could help him preserve his candidacy.
Georgia
Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) has made significant ad buys in Atlanta. While businessman Donald Trump will be hard to beat outright in Georgia, the delegates are allocated proportionally and Rubio has done well in cities thus far. If he manages to increase his share of the vote by 4 percent or so, it could end up putting more delegates to his name and helping move his candidacy forwards.
Massachusetts
The Bay State is demographically favorable to Sanders, featuring a largely white and liberal populace. The mixed primary could also help Sanders as Republicans defect either out of a preference for grassroots style candidates or a desire to face Sanders in the general election because he might be an easier target. Polling currently shows Clinton somewhat ahead of Sanders amongst registered Democrats, but that lead could evaporate in the coming days due to both the structure of the primary and the recent focus Sanders has had on New England’s most populous state.
Minnesota
The Minnesota caucus could be pivotal in both races.
On the Democratic side, Sanders’ built-in caucus advantages could help him, as can the very liberal nature of Minnesota’s Democrats. Sanders taking caucus wins can also help him claim to be the voice of the Democratic base, which could help sway some superdelegates who feel uneasy with the accusations of bias towards Clinton flying at the DNC.
On the Republican side, Ohio Governor John Kasich has largely staked his presidential campaign on a strong showing in the midwest. Minnesota is one state where a second or strong third place finish is possible and will help him form an argument that he has a chance and isn’t just siphoning votes away from Rubio.
Oklahoma
The Oklahoma primary is historically a difficult one to gauge. Culturally, Oklahoma has strong influences from both the south — strongholds for Trump and Clinton — and the midwest, which influences the state’s politics heavily. This is a state where both Kasich and Sanders can make powerful statements with better than expected finishes or completely flop based on whichever strain of Oklahoman dominates the ballot box. As of right now, Clinton appears to have a very slight edge over Sanders while Kasich has largely ignored Oklahoma and it seems to be amongst his worst states. Polling has been very sparse, however, and it is unclear who is doing well in the state.
In the polls that have been released, Rubio has been close to toppling Trump. If Rubio is able to finally break the narrative of endless second place “wins,” he could give himself significant momentum going into the rest of March and can mount a more credible challenge to Trump.
Texas
Texas is a gargantuan delegate haul, with 255 delegates available to the Democrats and 155 to the Republicans, the largest state in both races on Tuesday. Clinton currently holds a lead over Sanders that might be large enough to put the Sanders candidacy to bed if it persists, but on the Republican side, it is the one state where Trump is not the favorite going in. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) will be looking to cash in on a home state advantage to try and offset the gains Trump will make in other states. Some polls have shown Cruz with massive separation from the field while some have shown him just barely leading Trump. If Cruz can put together a big win, he could help his candidacy recover from consecutive finishes behind Rubio and a media narrative that increasingly ignores him.
Vermont
Vermont is Sanders’ home state and he is currently leading polls by close to 90 percent. Vermont’s 16 delegates is only a slight haul, but having a win that emphatic on Super Tuesday, especially in a caucus state, can help him control the narrative on his candidacy coming out of Super Tuesday and possibly weather the blow of his likely massive losses in the SEC primary.
Virginia
Virginia’s moderate brand of politics has resulted in Kasich and Rubio making hard plays for good showings in the state. If Kasich is able to mount a second place finish, it could help his candidacy survive to Michigan and Ohio, states where his profile is high and he might be able to win if he builds momentum. Rubio has made a hard play for the suburbs of DC located in northern Virginia and could potentially grab a state victory. Recent polling has been sparse but has shown Rubio within striking distance of Trump while Kasich is far behind but steadily gaining in polls.

Passwords are one of the Internet’s most ubiquitous features, as they have been used throughout history to authenticate the identities of people trying to access privileged information. But as code-breaking computations become more and more complex, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to prove that a user is human with just a simple password.
In order to tackle this mounting challenge, cyber security researchers have begun studying rigorous human authentication methods. Research into cyber security is often very difficult to conduct, however, since, in order to come to empirically significant conclusions, researchers have to have access to a robust body of data. 
This data, which often includes private information like passwords and user IDs, is safeguarded to the point that these experiments are often over before they begin. However, a team of researchers from Carnegie Mellon University and Stanford University have created a breakthrough method that will allow researchers to safely share this privileged information to further the study of cyber security protocols.
The research team consisted of Anupam Datta, an associate professor in Carnegie Mellon’s Department of Computer Science, Jeremiah Blocki, a postdoctoral researcher at Microsoft Research, and Joseph Bonneau, a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University. 
Recently, this project has gained the confidence of Yahoo!, a large-scale search engine that boasts around 800 million active users each month across the globe. Yahoo! has such faith in this method that they have agreed to share password statistics from 70 million of their users. This tremendous data set will allow researchers throughout the field of cyber security to analyze real-world information and construct a more accurate picture of passwords in their natural habitat, and the ways by which they might be better protected or constructed.
“This is the first time a major company has released frequency information on user passwords,” said Datta in a university press release. “It’s the kind of information that legitimate researchers can use to assess the impact of a security breach and to make informed decisions about password defenses. This is extremely valuable, so we hope other organizations will follow Yahoo’s lead.”
The algorithm works, essentially, by “distorting numbers in the data set so the list is ‘differentially private,’” according to the university press release. 
Differential privacy is a cryptographic term which essentially means that the accuracy of queries, or searches, in databases are maximized, but the chances of identifying the records from said database are minimized. In terms of the Yahoo! data set, this means that when using the information, there will be a high degree of accuracy, but finding out whether or not a specific user is included in a certain group of data will be nearly impossible.
The research encrypts the Yahoo! data set by distorting the numbers in this way, such that no individual user is truly at risk. Another safeguard within this data set is that the data isn’t necessarily actual passwords, but frequency lists, which count the number of times a specific password was created by a certain group of users.
“I have already started the Yahoo! data to model and analyze a rational offline password attacker using game theory,” wrote Blocki in an email interview with The Tartan.
There are many types of password-cracking programs out there, and by running real data through constructed examples of these programs, researchers can really determine how to better protect actual users. With access to a data sample this large, there are tremendous opportunities for relevant experiments that can be extrapolated into the real world.
Blocki notes that he is “excited to see what other security researchers are able to [do] with the frequency data now that it is available publicly,” and, given the new avenues this secure sharing method open up, there are a variety of possibilities.

On Feb. 12–13, the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence held a meeting to declare that Carnegie Mellon University’s Pokerbot — Baby Tartanian 8 — had won first place at the Annual Computer Poker Competition in the total bankroll category and third place in the bankroll instant run-off category, out of 11 participating teams. A “Pokerbot” is exactly what it sounds like: a robot that plays poker. Heads-Up, No-Limit Texas Hold’em poker, to be specific.
Baby Tartanian 8 was designed by Noam Brown, a Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science, alongside his adviser, Tuomas Sandholm, a professor in the Computer Science Department. The project is representative of an incomplete information problem. The aim of this problem is to be able to find and play the strategy with the best results, based off limited information.
“This algorithm is not specific to poker,” Brown said. “It should be generally applicable to any strategic interaction where you have multiple agents and asymmetric information.” Asymmetric information is a situation where one person has information that the other person doesn’t. Examples of this type of situation include negotiation situations, security situations, and transactions.
Tartanian 8 was developed as a successor to the previous bot Tartanian 7 using the Comet supercomputer at the San Diego Supercomputer Center. Tartanian 8 was built entirely from scratch, boasting better, faster algorithms, and hardware that supports increased computation power. 
“The one thing that we used this year that we didn’t use in the previous years was the idea of pruning,” Brown said. “In a game like poker, where you have a lot of actions available to you, pruning helps cut down to actions that are worth investigating according to a given situation, instead of considering all the actions available to you.”
A paper published recently by Brown and Sandholm explains the idea of pruning as a way to minimize the options that would be investigated, while ensuring that the algorithm still arrives at an optimal strategy. However, due to the competition’s restrictions on the participants, Tartanian 8 had to be scaled down to Baby Tartanian 8, a 200 GB version with two cores.
Baby Tartanian 8 was developed after the “Brains vs. Artificial Intelligence” exhibition organized by Carnegie Mellon last year, where Carnegie Mellon invited top poker players to compete against Tartanian 7. Although three of the four human players had higher earnings than Tartanian 7, they had not won by enough of a margin to consider their win to be of statistical significance. This means that it wasn’t possible to distinguish with certainty about who was better.
After 80,000 hands of poker, played over a span of two weeks, the researchers, with feedback from the poker players, were able to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the bot. The strengths were that Tartanian 7 often did things that humans wouldn’t. For instance, it would bet a very large sum of money on a very small pot or a very tiny amount to a very large pot. As opponents, they said that such strategies threw them off. According to them, that was one instance when the bot was unpredictable, as human players generally don’t make such decision, but the bot was unfazed, and was able to balance that move with other moves.
The researchers also identified some of the weaknesses of the bot. One of the major weaknesses of the bot was that the algorithm was designed to put card hands into similar sets of hands on which it could use a similar strategy. This is called abstraction. When grouping those hands together, the bot would sometimes misjudge the situation, which would cause it to have it a suboptimal strategy and act absurdly.
This feedback was critical for the development of the newest bot, and future plans for the Tartanian model involve upgrading the algorithm and equipping it with better hardware that is more suited to perform higher computation levels.
“The ultimate goal in this line of research is to eventually beat the top humans,” Brown said. “Hopefully, in the next 2–3 years, we will be able to accomplish that.”

This week at Pugwash, we ventured into global economics, with the usual technological spin.   When America wants to import goods, a United States corporation will purchase goods from another nation. In many cases, these companies will over-buy so that they can drive out domestic competition by over-supplying the American markets, and so that large corporations can avoid the embarrassment of having a deficit of goods. 
Because of this, it appears to other nations that the demand for a good from the U.S. is higher than it actually is. This artificially inflates demand and raises the global price for a good, thereby impacting less wealthy nations that may not be able to afford the product. 
To summarize, the global market price of a good is not reflective of the genuine supply and demand. Our question was: could an algorithm be designed that would inform U.S. companies how much of a product to buy, and which countries to purchase from, such that our purchasing decisions reflect the actual supply and demand of these goods?
In response to the idea of using an algorithm for these tasks, some members offered alternative ideas on how to affect this issue. One participant gave the example of certain all-you-can-eat buffets that would charge people for wasting. 
Essentially, take what you want, but pay for what you do not use. This member thought that this idea could be applied to a company, thereby incentivizing the company not to over-buy. It was also mentioned that this policy would absolutely not work on the individual level (outside of buffets), because enforcing such a thing would be almost impossible.
Next, one member mentioned that “there is no such thing as an unbiased algorithm.” Essentially, if we decided to implement an algorithm to make trade decisions, we should keep in mind that an algorithm is still a program written by a human with certain biases, and thus cannot be seen as conveying some sort of objective economic truth. However, another Pugwashite thought that algorithms were already being used to make economic decisions in many areas, and that it is natural to extend this technology to our global trade. If it has been so successful here, why not extend the reach of these programs?
Furthermore, using an algorithm could be a good way to bake externalities into the price of goods. A well-known example of this is carbon tax policies. 
An algorithm could take into account factors such as long-term environmental damages, and modify the prices of global products accordingly. Yet another member warned that leaving our marketing decisions up to an algorithm would be placing tremendous power in the “hands” of one non-human entity. Furthermore, it may be very well understood how to make a machine learning algorithm, but it is not very well understood how exactly a specific algorithm “learns.” 
Effectively, we would have a non-human system that we do not understand well making tremendous decisions for our country and world. Is this really a corner we want to code ourselves into? Further, we questioned what exactly the inputs to this algorithm would be. 
Would we input price values into the algorithm to receive a “true price” output? 
But wouldn’t this ruin the entire point of the algorithm, where we are using it because we do not trust the market values of these items? 
There would have to be some other sort of input, but what? How can we possibly know what factors are necessary to predict the true global value of a product? 
Humans have tried to out-engineer the market before, and it has been a failure most of the time. The most obvious example is the Soviet Union. 
Could such an algorithm be another failed, and possibly profoundly consequential, attempt in a history of humans attempting to out-think the market? The market is the summation of millions of decisions, or in the case of global markets, billions. Do we really think that an algorithm can do better? In conclusion, the idea of a computer system finding the genuine price of an item is attractive, and seems to be successful in certain areas such as energy. 
But to apply this technology to the global market may be anti-capitalist and infeasible. Perhaps we should leave market decisions to the market.
Student Pugwash is a non-advocacy, educational organization that discusses the implications of science. This article is a summary of last week’s discussion on global economics.

At some point, you’ve probably used Google Maps to figure out how to get somewhere. If you went to menu and clicked “Satellite,” you were able to see physically what your surroundings look like, so you could look for key landmarks. In fact, the concept of satellite imaging was so popular that Google created a whole new application dedicated to it: Google Earth.
Google Earth emerged from Earth Viewer 3-D, a program created by Keyhole Corp., a digital mapping company based in Mountain View, California. Keyhole Corp. was also funded in part by the Central Intelligence Agency. According to a Google press release, Google acquired Keyhole Corp. back in 2004, and thereafter released Google Earth in 2005. 
The present application highlights 3-D images that allow the user to explore cities, buildings, bridges, monuments — you name it. Distant galaxies can be explored using Google Sky, a feature introduced in Google Earth 4.2 in August 2007, and the ocean can be explored using Google Ocean, a feature introduced in Google Earth 5.0 in February 2009. 
Google Earth images are so detailed that you can clearly see your house, objects in your yard, all pretty accurately. But how does Google Earth get all of these high-resolution graphics? The answer lies in satellite and aerial imaging. We’ll focus on satellite imaging here. 
Satellite imaging is a process that uses satellites to scan the Earth and gain information about it. Satellites use different sensors to collect electromagnetic radiation reflected from objects on the Earth — passive sensors collect radiation from the Sun reflected on the Earth, while active sensors send out radiation themselves and analyze it after it has been reflected off of the Earth. The difference in reflectivity allows us to identify objects using remote sensing. 
Water, for example, reflects little infrared or visible light, while vegetation absorbs visible light, but strongly reflects infrared light. 
Satellite images are the result of thousands of pixels that the satellite scanned into rows and columns. The satellite gathers these pixels into a computer file, and the area the file covers is called a scene. Scene sizes vary depending on the type and size of the sensor. 
Satellite imaging has many applications — personal, environmental, militaristic.  It can be used for weather predictions; it can also help map out enemy terrain. 
Google Earth gets their images from satellites like TeleAtlas and EarthSat, which compile photographs and maps into digital form for commercial use. Google Earth images differ from images collected by major satellites in many ways. 
With Google Earth images, the image is sharpest in the center and becomes increasingly blurry towards the edges. There is also no timestamp on Google Earth images, so although they are one to three years old, it is impossible to tell the exact time and date the images were taken, which is essential with images from major satellites. 
While compiling images is a major feature of Google Earth, the most challenging thing is transferring those images to your computer quickly and efficiently. One way Google Earth cuts down transfer time is by using your computer’s disk cache to store images for places you’ve already looked at so that when you look at them again, Google Earth doesn’t need to re-download the images. 
Google also has a patent called Universal Texture, which uses two methods for getting large amounts of information to your computer — mipmapping and clip stacking. 
Mipmaps are collections of bitmap images that create the illusion of depth by working within a texture in an inverted pyramid structure. These images stack onto one another in layers, with each layer having twice the resolution of the layer below it. Clip stacks are portions of giant mipmaps that are clipped to a specified maximum size, which speeds up the process since Google Earth relies on the fact that a user only wants to see a portion of the mipmap at a time. 
Since the data comes from different sources, it is provided at different resolutions, which is why your town may appear really crisp, while a town in, say, Mexico, is blurry. Google Earth has several countries including the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom mapped out clearly to the street level, and there is a good amount of information on other regions like Western Europe, India, and Japan, but everything else is hit or miss. While you can zoom in to look at the Egyptian Pyramids in great detail, for example, you can’t see where the local grocery is. 
There is also controversy that it may provide unwanted information, whether in regard to personal privacy or national and international security. Google has blocked Google Earth in Iran and Sudan since 2007 due to U.S. government export restrictions, and Maroc Telecom, a major service provider in Morocco, has also blocked the application since 2006 for unknown reasons. Other countries such as India, South Korea, and Israel have expressed concern that Google Earth made highly classified locations visible to terrorist organizations, some of which have since been censored and pixelated by Google. 
Regardless of how you use it, the images were brought to you through the use of satellite imaging.

Unlike the past locations that I’ve written about, I stumbled upon Paris 66 accidentally one Sunday morning. It was, in fact, quite a stroke of luck that we were able to find seating in the place that was, unknowing to me, quite popular.
A friend and I had made plans to try out a popular brunch spot in East Liberty, only to find that without a reservation it was near impossible for a couple of walk-ins to land a table, unless we were willing to wait for 40 minutes. We were not. Our stomachs were growling, and snow was beginning to settle on the relatively quiet streets. Where was everyone? Probably somewhere warm, devouring goopy-yolked eggs and steaming hot peppermint tea. Needless to say, I was getting restless, so we began to walk down Centre Avenue in hopes of finding a place to eat. It was actually Google Maps that indicated to us that there were in fact several places to eat nearby, and the hopeless romantic in me lunged towards the first place that promised what I hoped to be a quaint European atmosphere.
With the direction we were going in, the place was quite easy to miss, and we would have walked right past it had Google Maps not gleefully announced that we had reached our destination. Why was it easy to miss? There weren’t any tables outside because of the snow, and the facade of the restaurant looked like your typical street store: covering shade hovering about a large glass window with some flags attached from the upper half of the building, rippling in the cool winter air. The flags were, of course, of the European Union, the United States, and France.
Since then, I’ve had the chance to return, so here’s a rundown of what I have had the pleasure of trying:
Quiche du jour: The quiche of that day was made with sun-dried tomatoes, spinach, and goat and swiss cheese. The crust was perfectly cooked, and the quiche itself did not have the overwhelmingly eggy flavor that I was expecting. It was light in each bite, but filling in all. An instant classic.
Paris 66 Crepes: The crepes at Paris 66 are made with buckwheat, so they’re pretty heavy and have flavor in and of themselves (even without the filling). This crepe was loaded with a sunny side up egg, tomato provencal, ham, swiss cheese, and mushrooms en bechamel. The presentation was breathtaking. The crepe was carefully wrapped with the egg at its center and other components carefully placed around the plate. The individual components were delicious, particularly the mushrooms en bechamel, which to me tasted like a thick cream of mushroom soup. All together, though, it was a bit heavy. There’s a lot of flavor, and a lot to digest, so tread carefully.
Omelette du jour: When I arrived for brunch, the omelette of the day was salmon and swiss. The salmon was cooked to perfection and omelette was clearly carefully crafted. This is really worth trying.
Creme Brulée: From the perfectly crunched shell to the astonishingly delicate flavor, this was by far the best thing that Paris 66 served up. The components worked together so well, my mouth was finding it difficult to process how it had never encountered the blend that made up this harmonious taste. If I had to go back and order one thing, this would be it.
Mariage Freres: Bouddha Bleu: I was so excited that Mariage Freres tea is served here as well, and even more excited to see that they had more flavors that I hadn’t tried yet. This was a fruit green tea with some smoky accents to it. It washed down the quiche splendidly, and made for good sipping after I was finished with my meal.
Cha-ching: The place takes cards and cash. Fair warning, it is a little on the pricier side, so do check out menu prices before heading out if you’re waiting on a pay check.
Herbivores, Omnivores, and Carnivores, lend me your ears: There’s a great mix of vegetarian, gluten-free and non vegetarian options, which are helpfully indicated on the menu. The waitress also said that some dishes could be ordered as vegetarian versions, so do be sure to ask if you have your eye on something in particular.
Are we there yet?: It’s up in East Liberty, a two minute walk from Target, so I’d go for any of the 71’s. Uber or Lyft works too. Here’s the address: 6018 Centre Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15206.
Click, click: The website for this restaurant has improved significantly since I first used it, and includes a menu, an about page, some pictures of the restaurant, and other features. Do check it out: http://www.paris66bistro.com/
For those stay-at-home days: Take out is available, but home delivery through the restaurant is not available. Here’s a number to call for take out, reservations, and any inquiries: (412) 404–8166
Hours:
Mon–Thu: 11 a.m.–10 p.m.
Fri–Sat: 11 a.m.–11 p.m.
Sun: 10 a.m.–3 p.m.
21+: French wines are available, along with all sorts of European beer and wine.
Ambience: The staff is incredibly friendly, and mostly French-speaking, so be sure to say bonjour on your way in! The decor is very rustic and old-timey, which brings about the European feel that I love about the place. There are small Eiffel Towers positioned around, as well as framed old posters and other intriguing wall mounts. Très chic.
College student friendly?: Other than the pricing, yes. The place does see a lot of couples and elderly groups enjoying a hearty lunch together, but the staff is very accommodating and happy to serve all.
Overall rating: 4 melons

Most students use spring break as a time to take a much-needed breather from Carnegie Mellon, but senior drama major Nate Bertone doesn’t have that luxury — he’s got two major artistic endeavors premiering right when we return. First, he’s directing a free evening of artistic performances commenting on diversity called “Kaleidoscope.” Featuring the world premiere of the musical Polka Dots, the show is on Monday, March 14 at 7 p.m. in the Philip Chosky Theater. The second piece is a photo project he’s been working on since sophomore year titled “We Wear the Mask.” The exhibition is set to premiere at the Future Tenant gallery in the downtown Cultural District on Friday, March 18 at 6 p.m. as part of the quarterly Cultural Trust Gallery Crawl. While simply reading that could cause a wave of stress, the Massachusetts native speaks of his momentous efforts as if they’re privileges rather than responsibilities. He hopes to spark conversations on campus and in the wider community regarding ways we can channel negative emotions into positive change.
“Kaleidescope,” a one-night only event, is a multi-discipline affair bringing together students from the School of Drama, Scotch ‘n’ Soda, and members of Arts Greenhouse, a Carnegie Mellon-sponsored after-school creative program for local high school students. The night will begin with musical performances from Arts Greenhouse, then feature original spoken word pieces from both Arts Greenhouse and Carnegie Mellon students, and wrap up with the world premiere of Polka Dots with a talkback with the cast following the performance.
Bertone was given the exciting opportunity to debut Polka Dots after connecting with one of the writers on Facebook; a friend posted a video of the writer performing an original song called “Sticks and Stones” about a young girl named Lily using positive thought to overcome school bullies. The themes of the song permeate Polka Dots, which is about the character of Lily Polka Dot and her experience as the first polka dot in a school for squares. The entire musical is based on the historical experience of the Little Rock Nine. Don’t be put off by the fact that the show was written as a touring educational show for middle school students: Bertone assures that the label is more of an age minimum than a maximum. “It’s a show that has these important topics from a middle school perspective but its very sophisticated in its conversations and has beautiful music … it’s a show that can be enjoyed by adults but also understood by children,” he said.
Four days after “Kaleidoscope,” Bertone’s exhibition “We Wore the Masks” opens downtown. A self-professed social media obsessive, Bertone is primarily interested in exploring the momentous changes that living online has brought to the human experience. He says that his photo project was spurned by the idea that “on a daily basis we wear masks that we need to remove in order to get to know each other … with social media we are constantly able to change the way that the world sees us by rewording a status or editing [our] profile picture, personally hand selecting everything the world sees about us.” 
The project involved asking subjects to tell Bertone something about themselves they wouldn’t necessarily want to share with the world and then define it in a word. Bertone then photographed the exposed subjects and printed the word across the subject’s body, allowing them to finally share their true selves with the world. In addition to the existing photographs, the March 18 opening reception at Future Tenant will host a “living gallery,” where walk-ins may themselves become subjects and add to the collection.
Soon to graduate as a drama major with a focus in scenic design, Bertone has worked on a number of Carnegie Mellon productions including last year’s Milk Milk Lemonade and Hydrogen Jukebox, the School of Music opera. However, Bertone’s real interests lie in directing and playwriting, a passion sparked by his experience with the School of Drama’s annual Playground festivals, which allow for students to conceive, propose, and produce original theater pieces. “Playground really was the outlet where I understood what you can do with theater, and that really helped spark my path change,” he said. “Letters from War,” a play he wrote for Playground his sophomore year inspired by his grandmothers battle with Alzheimer’s and grandfather’s lung cancer, grew past its Carnegie Mellon roots and had its world premiere last May in Massachusetts.
Due to the wide age appeal of “Kaleidoscope”, Bertone expects to see a packed house in the Chosky Theater for the one-night event. “The hope is that we can get CMU students to come to this, and fill the audience with middle and high school students as well, and all have this conversation together,” he beamed over a cup of iced coffee. “The show is called kaleidoscope because in a kaleidoscope all the colors are in there and when you put them together it becomes this one beautiful image.

The hall was packed. Children were squirming with excitement, running up to the front of the auditorium to buy pre-signed editions of the newest book of the Timmy Failure series. In the audience was a mix of adults who had come with their children, and adults holding bags with a stack of their favorite Pearls Before Swine collections, ready to be signed later on. Those outside were scrambling for tickets, praying that they weren’t sold out. This was the bustling state of Carnegie Lecture Hall last Sunday, Feb. 21.
As the clock struck two, Stephanie Flom, the Executive Director of the Carnegie Library walked over to the podium, and hushed the hall to a lulled silence. With murmurs of excitement still resonating throughout the room, Flom began by speaking about the lecture series, the sponsors of the event, and finally about Stephan Pastis. “I’ve just spent the last few minutes backstage speaking to Stephan,” she chuckled, “and he’s a very funny guy.”
Pastis arrived at Carnegie Library’s Lecture Hall as the sixth installment of their children’s author lecture series. Pastis has been touring the world, talking about both his children’s book series, Timmy Failure, and his award-winning newspaper comic series Pearls Before Swine. Although he has been drawing from a very early age, Pastis was a lawyer for almost ten years, which he later explained was boring beyond comprehension. In 2003, he dropped it all to pursue his passion, and has been thriving ever since. He used the lecture as an opportunity to talk about how he got where he is today, the origins of his ideas, his thought processes, and what he believes good writing really is.
The highlight of the lecture was definitely the portion where Pastis described his writing technique. Aside from this lecture, I’ve also had the pleasure of sitting in on lectures given by Lois Lowry and Margaret Atwood. Both of these incredibly distinguished authors spoke about the roots of their ideas, how they wrote while building off of past experiences, and conducting thorough research. Pastis, in this sense, is a little unconventional. He spoke of a four-step thought process that he goes through, while brainstorming ideas for his comic strip.
“When you write for a newspaper, you have to make a lot of comic strips,” he sighed. “365, to be precise.” His technique consists of the following steps:
1. Listen to really loud music
2. Drink a lot of coffee
3. Draw all over the walls
4. Dance
“Listening to loud music distracts that part of your brain that wants to think logically,” Pastis said. “If you have to think too much about what you’re writing, it’s not going to be funny.” He complemented this explanation with some examples of strips that came out of it. He went on to say that working in this manner has made his work “unintentionally autobiographical.” He confessed that most of his ideas seemed very random to him when they first popped into his head, but when he’d go back to read some of his work, he’d see snippets of his life breathe through his work.
Pastis admitted, however, that not all of his ideas stem from this four-step plan. Rat, his cynical, and arguably most popular comic character, gets a lot of his thoughts and opinions from Pastis himself, and irritating encounters that he experiences on a day to day life. “I’d like people to know, that you if do something stupid near me, chances are that the whole world is going to know about it, because I will include it in a strip with Rat,” he joked, with the loudest laugh in response being from a squirming third grader in the front row.
Pastis continued his lecture with some interesting anecdotes about the controversies he’s been involved in and some legendary comic-artists that he has encountered. We learned that Pastis has been banned from entering Turkey after unintentionally insulting the revered first president of Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. 
He also spoke of meeting the rarely seen, reclusive Bill Watterson (the creator of Calvin and Hobbes) and the legendary Charles M. Schulz, who not only created the Peanuts comics, but also was one of Pastis’ biggest inspirations. “I read in an article somewhere, that every Sunday morning he would go to this specific cafe and order an english muffin, so I decided to give it a shot and I went and sat there for hours.” Pastis joked that he must’ve looked very suspicious as he was the only one in the shop looking around nervously and not eating anything, but at long last, while taking a final scan of the room, there sat Schulz. 
Pastis, who was a lawyer at the time, worked up the nerves to speak to his idol and greeted him with what he believes to be the worst way to introduce yourself to someone: “Hello Mr. Schulz, my name is Stephan Pastis, and I’m a lawyer.” Pastis said Schulz’s eyes widened with terror until he explained his passion for comics and Schulz offered to look through his work and give him some advice. “It was so amazing, we sat for a couple of hours just skimming through my work. I was so lucky to have had it with me in the car. It was the best day of my life.”
After speaking for around 20 minutes, Pastis left the rest of the hour for questions, which he took from children and adults alike. He concluded his session by drawing some of his characters on large pieces of paper which were given away to very lucky fans, and then walked over to the children’s library for book signing.
What I’m usually disappointed with when attending the lectures at the Carnegie Library, is the book signing segment. The lines are typically ridiculously long, and the time with the author is fleeting and impersonal. Pastis, however, insisted on taking the time to speak to each of his fans, signing their books as personally as possible with quick sketches of their favorite characters and even offered to take pictures. 
Unfortunately, I had left all of my Pearls Before Swine collections back in India, but I did manage to pick up a record by the psychedelic folk band Pearls Before Swine from Caliban for Pastis to sign, much to his amusement. “I’ve seen this record online, and I’ve always wanted to hold it. I just want to draw all over it,” he laughed, and signed both the front and back of the vinyl cover. When I told Pastis I was from Bangalore, he excitedly informed me of his recent visit to India and how he’d love to go back and check out Bangalore in the near future. All in all, it was a great day.

On Saturday evening, students gathered in Rangos Auditorium to watch the annual Mayur Show. This year’s theme was “Meet the Kapoors,” and featured various dance and vocal performances. The show was arranged by Mayur, the South Asian Student Association. The “hosts” of the show were the imaginary Kapoor family and Simran Patel, portrayed as a stereotypical Indian family and their soon-to-be daughter-in-law.
Simran is completely ignorant of her Indian roots, having grown up in the United States. She falls in love with and gets engaged to Ranjeet Kapoor, who has recently moved to the U.S. from India. He wants Simran to appreciate his culture and he invites her to visit India to meet his parents. Ranjeet and Simran then and go on a journey through their home country, beginning in South India. The first was a performance was by CMU Payal. The traditional South Indian dance featured a skit depicting scenes from the Hindu holy scripture, Ramayana.
Some of the teams that participated were from outside Carnegie Mellon. Notable groups included Pitt Avaaz and Pitt Zisha, vocal performance and dance teams, respectively, run by South Asian students from the University of Pittsburgh. One of the highlights of the first half of the show was a solo called “Gaurav and his Ukuleke,” in which first-year engineering major Gaurav Balakrishnan expertly played his instrument while singing in both Hindi and English. A brief intermission was bookended by two fashion shows, one featuring Western styles and the other, Indian. All the while, the Kapoors were making light on the differences between Indian and American culture, coming on stage to introduce acts.
CMU Bhangra brought a flavor of North India to the show in the second half, as the Kapoors shared their Punjabi heritage with Simran. The loud, celebratory dance is native to the Punjab region, and one of the biggest dance activities on campus. Vocal performances by the Saans, Avaaz, and Deewane a capella groups blended American and Indian music. Singers started off with American pop songs and transitioned back and forth with traditional and contemporary Indian songs. After Simran performs in Sahara, Carnegie Mellon’s newest Indian dance team, the Kapoors conclude that she is suitable to marry their son. Simran learns the virtues of Indian culture, while at the same time preserving her American upbringing, a sentiment shared by many Indian-Americans who live in between two unique cultures. Ranjeet also takes in Simran’s culture by learning how to rap, (though not up to Simran’s standards). The couple lives happily ever after.
The performances were wrapped up by local Indian-American singer/songwriter Jai Matt. The crowd went wild when the singer pulled event-goers up on stage to dance. Next, the long-awaited meal was an opportunity for the audience to interact with the performers. The food was catered by various Pittsburgh-area South Asian restaurants — Silk Elephant, Tamarind, and Ali Baba.
Mayur, in particular, celebrates all South Asian cultures, across all religious and linguistic bounds. It is responsible for events like the Diwali-Eid Gala, which celebrates both Hindu and Islamic holidays. As the largest South Asian organization on campus, one of Mayur’s goals is to promote interest in South Asian culture by reaching out to “students of other nations and cultures.” This theme was evident not only in the diversity of the audience, but by that of the performers as well.
All of the proceeds of this year’s Mayur show will be donated to relief efforts for the Chennai Floods. Chennai and other parts of South India were inundated after record rainfall in November and December last year. The floods killed at least 500 people, and inflicted severe damage on the region’s infrastructure. Recovery is an ongoing process.
Overall, the event was successful in bringing together a diverse audience and exposing them to different South Asian performances both on and off campus. Following the main show was an after-party at the Loft in Shadyside, with more performances by Jai Matt.
Students of Indian background make up a large percentage of both the undergraduate and graduate population here at Carnegie Mellon. Many clubs, including Mayur, are dedicated to celebrating Indian culture and, for many Indian Americans, they are a good way to stay attuned to their heritage.

It is no secret that life is completely unpredictable. The only certainty is uncertainty. This lesson has blinded Hollywood creatives on a consistent basis. When a movie hits, or a phenomenon catches hold, Hollywood will do everything in their power to reproduce it. 2001: A Space Odyssey did not start with credits as prior movies did. Trailers stopped using the gravelly voiceover of Don LaFontaine. 
The trailer for Guardians of the Galaxy had a catchy pop song, and now all trailers do. But when that journey for reproductive success means blindly creating content that does not appreciate itself, audiences just buy tickets to the opera or spend the weekend at home binge-watching House Of Cards. On Feb. 12, the highly anticipated Deadpool was released and audiences jammed the ticket booth. Why?
For the sake of argument, let’s not consider the absolutely brilliant marketing campaign. In February 2004, a movie based on the Marvel Comics character Deadpool was announced and writers were hired to develop a story with Ryan Reynolds in the title role.
After getting tossed around like a pack of gum at a high school pep rally, the character landed at 20th Century Fox, along with the rest of the X-Men, when Marvel sold off some properties to avoid bankruptcy. The Deadpool movie was shelved. In 2009, X-Men Origins: Wolverine happened and depicted a version of the Deadpool character that was, let’s just say, frowned upon. In the six years since, the initial script was rewritten and Reynolds, operating as a producer, pushed for a proper story and a theatrical release.
Am I saying that every movie should take six years to hash out every detail? Of course not, but there is not yet any evidence of projected success in this tale. Movies are shelved all the time. 
What separates this Deadpool movie? Reynolds’ producing and Tim Miller’s directing comes from a place of passion for the character. In an issue of the comic, and this story is now becoming famous, the “Merc With The Mouth” is asked what he looks like under his mask. Deadpool responds saying he looks “like Ryan Reynolds crossed with a Shar-Pei.” Reynolds read the issue and became interested. 
Over the years, Reynolds connected further with the character and had ample time to consider every angle for a film. He realized a “proper” Deadpool story is naturally cinematic. The writers agreed and penned a brilliant script that captures all the best cinematic qualities of Deadpool. Lucky for us, the audience, the best cinematic qualities of Deadpool are the best qualities of Deadpool: fourth-wall breakdown, condescending sense of humor, graphic violence, and cheeky, harsh language.
Writing a proper story for a cinematic adaptation is not a universal quality. A proper Batman story is not cinematic, most notably because of “The Boy Wonder.” A proper Batman story has Robin: a teenage, orphaned, acrobat who wears red and green tights and confronts homicidal criminals. That will not work on screen.
Deadpool’s cinematic appeal is the ability for it to be taken off the page and put on screen. The audience responds to authenticity, not comedic gimmicks or star power. The passion Reynolds and Miller hold for the character fuels the film to its record-breaking success. Maybe Hollywood will take notice and learn something.
You can expect plenty of movies “like Deadpool” in theaters soon. The fourth wall is no longer sacred. R-rated action films are going to make a comeback. Unfortunately, I anticipate these films to not be treated with the same appreciation for the story that the creators of Deadpool had for theirs. I anticipate them to be “like Deadpool” in every aspect except the one that audiences appreciate: authenticity.
It doesn’t hurt that the marketing campaign was just as authentic as the film itself. A successful film marketing campaign must be treated as an extension of the film, not a simple representation of it. That is what Deadpool and Fox did perfectly. 20th Century Fox embraced a self-awareness of the character and used it to expand upon their movie. Billboards depicting the film as a Valentine’s Day release (it wasn’t) love story (it was) were brilliant. They released viral pieces of Deadpool himself spoofing other pieces in entertainment and pop culture. They used the fourth-wall breaks to their advantage when Deadpool addresses the camera and does press interviews in character. The studio piqued everybody’s curiosity and then released a spectacular movie. Word of mouth took over, and Deadpool is now breaking more records than Michael Phelps.
If Hollywood can embrace the fact that movies are more than a dollar amount, take pride in their product, and hire filmmakers that are passionate about making the right film, we can expect more movies “like Deadpool,” movies that are remarkable and profitable at the same time. With any luck, the writers of the next Transformers movies are taking notes.

I spent this Friday night waiting anxiously for the chance to see some all-American hunks bare it all. I almost didn’t score tickets to the School of Drama’s production of The Full Monty, but I was committed. First on the waitlist, I rushed to my surprisingly good seat smack in the center of a totally occupied row toward the middle of the Philip Chosky Theater. The crowd buzzed with anticipation, a decidedly middle-aged and suit-wearing audience for a musical about male strippers. The set blended two worlds: a glitzy curtain of streamers suitable for Chippendales and rusty metal scaffolding perfect for an upstate New York steel mill. The lights went down, and I was at a freaking strip show.
The premise of The Full Monty is simple, if a bit contrived. Six unemployed, depressed, altogether average Buffalo millworkers turn their desperate sights on a new line of work, one that’s hotter than a steel rod straight from the furnace — and twice as hard. They’re led by Jerry, a divorced father and the man with a plan who I’m not sure deserves to be the show’s protagonist. Think of Jerry as your sexist bum uncle who’s always pulling get-rich-quick schemes out of his ass; he’s the least compelling and least likable character of the bunch. This is no fault of senior drama major Nick Sacks, who played him earnestly and amplified his main redeeming feature: love for his teenage son Nathan (played by junior drama major Nathan Salstone), whom Jerry will lose custody of if he doesn’t come up with his half of the support money. Sacks and Salstone communicated a powerful father-son bond that cut through the unlikelihood of the plot.
The shiniest jewel in The Full Monty’s G-string was the supporting cast. The funniest song in the show was “Big Black Man,” the stripper tryout of a — ahem — not-so-big middle-aged black man misleadingly nicknamed Horse (played by Avery Smith). I honestly have no idea how Smith managed to be sexy while wearing trousers up to his belly button and dancing a medley of the 70s’ greatest hits. But my favorite of the unlikely strippers was Malcolm, played by the hilarious and adorable Josh Grosso. Jerry and his self-conscious best friend Dave (played by senior drama major Michael Leadbetter in a fat suit) collect Malcolm for their team after saving him from a suicide attempt brought on by his crippling friendlessness.
One of the show’s most memorable songs — “A Big Ass Rock,” which listed several comic ways a guy might kill himself — was also the one I had the hardest time laughing at. But Leadbetter saved the otherwise cringe-worthy scene with his formidable talent for physical comedy. For one, his impromptu stripper audition featured what can only be described as a full-body hip thrust minus the hips. For a character we meet when he’s about to off himself, Leadbetter presented a Malcolm who was probably the show’s most joyful character — once he finally has friends. He also snags a boyfriend in fellow amateur stripper Ethan (played by senior drama major Adam Stern-Rand), a character whose two defining characteristics are “dumb” and “jaw-droppingly large schlong.” Still, the boys’ gorgeous duet (“You Walk with Me”) and not-so-subtle handholding at Malcolm’s mom’s funeral brought on all the emotions. I’d like to survey the audience, but I called it the second Malcolm and Ethan simultaneously make a Sound of Music reference. Let’s just say I can spot homoerotic subtext a mile away; it’s an art.
The women of this show deserve a special shout-out. Despite the casual misogyny and hyper-inflated masculinity complexes of characters like Jerry, who’s definitely compensating for something, the women of The Full Monty were unquestionably badass. They carried the most electric group numbers — “It’s a Woman’s World” and “The Goods” — and gave the show heart. Refreshingly, this show skips the meet-cutes and the getting-togethers; it drops us instead right in the middle of two marriages. Dave and Georgie (senior drama major Erika Olson) and Harold (senior drama major Chris Garber) and Vicki (senior drama major Amanda Jerry) are in parallel rough patches, but their love for one another shines through the depression and humiliation of unemployment. Both pairs have fabulous chemistry, though I sort of fell in love with Vicki’s boundless enthusiasm for the team’s poindexter choreographer Harold. I caught a serious case of goose bumps during Georgie and Vicki’s reprise of “You Rule My World,” earning it a place among the few love songs that don’t make me want to hurl.
A show like The Full Monty has to have a happy ending, in more ways than one. Jerry’s league of everyman strippers — dubbed “Hot Metal” — opens their one-night-only show for what seems like the entire population of Buffalo. They’ve promised their audience, myself included, “The Full Monty.” Both audiences whooped for this mediocre yet charming strip show, waiting with baited breath for these believably average dudes to show their moneymakers. The final moment came with blinding stage lights. I didn’t see much, besides a few dangling silhouettes. In the end The Full Monty wasn’t about going all the way, but about holding tight to the people you love and having a crazy, off-color journey. Turns out it’s all in the foreplay — though no one’s about to say no to a spectacular finish.

The experience of teenage girls is often oversimplified or relegated to chick flicks, pop music, and tumblr. On Friday night, however, the new Frame show On Becoming gave this group their due, spotlighting the young, modern, female experience with soft lighting and glittering gauze. Each piece of art was deeply personal yet universal and came together cohesively. Somehow even the snacks, red velvet cupcakes and pink lemonade, seemed to match the ethereal color pallet. Standing amidst the crush of trendy fur coats and listening to the excited buzz of voices, it felt like opening night at a professional gallery.
On Becoming is the brainchild of sophomore art major Paola Mathus, sophomore BXA with gender studies major Jenna Houston, sophomore BXA with computer science major Kate Werth, and sophomore BXA with Logic and Computation major Toni James. Houston laid out the basic premise of the show, saying “it’s about the period of development between 13 and 22 for anyone female identified. And so I think we were thinking about things like changing into new bodies, relationships, I guess the beginnings of romantic relationships, and also how the Internet impacts those things.” Each artist took the basic concept and ran with it, resulting in a multifaceted show that spans interpretations and media, with printmaking, animation, painting, videography, and photography all making an appearance.
When I first stepped into the gallery, I was immediately drawn to one of Houston’s pieces in the back corner of the room. Simple and almost colorless, the piece, titled “Myself as her Doll, Myself as my Doll,” is a series of six photographs lined up on white backgrounds, with lit candles underneath each one. The candles have pastel ribbons tied around their holders, and the whole piece evokes the aura of a child’s memorial and seems somewhat ‘old-fashioned.’ A picture of a birthday cake with “Happy Birthday, Jenna” scrawled across lets us know we are peering into Houston’s childhood. The piece conjures a profound sense of loss, even though the girl in the photos is only standing on the other side of the room.
This piece played well with the piece beside it, a projection by James of sketched faces blinking in and out of existence. The faces are each unique, but fail to leave much of an impression as they disappear. James said the work was, “about people who come and go in life. Just like a simple representation of that, and [it] tries to kind of capture a similar type of indifference towards that.” The two pieces, along with James’s other animation about losing her favorite hideaway spot, put an interesting lens on On Becoming, highlighting what is lost or left behind in the process of becoming a woman in today’s society. They were emotive and subtle, the kind of pieces that bubble up in your consciousness weeks later. They were striking precisely because of the indifference James mentioned. There was no clear-cut message or single emotion, and instead the viewer had to grapple with a strange tangle of feelings that were much more human.
The other works in the show were less retrospective. Werth’s work focuses more on the experience of relationships, using printmaking and text to explore romantic connections in the 21st century. One piece of her’s is emblematic of her work in this show. It consists of a paragraph of poetic text printed repeatedly in white ink on a dark purple sheet. In places the text has been layered beyond recognition, in others it’s as crisp as a page in a book. The text, according to Werth, is, “all dreams I’ve had while I was sleeping alone and just kind of missing the person I was in a relationship with.” With its evocative imagery and thoughtful medium choice, the piece exemplifies her collection of strong, professional grade work. Her work gave the whole show a clear narrative.
Mathus’ work spanned the back wall of the gallery, and her paintings were the gravitational center of the space with their bold colors and clean composition. Her two most engaging pieces were self-portraits. They both depicted the artist, but that was where the similarities ended. One was stark, with only a single, completely black figure sitting curled up in the middle of a blank white canvas. The other was painted in pale pastels, with an overlay of abstract shapes and glitter. The juxtaposition between these two paintings highlights a complicated idea Mathus brings up in this show. She has been focusing on the self-portrait, because “as a visual artist and as a painter I feel like visuals and identity have just merged together into this really strange, single form of identification for myself … I feel like having just a visual portrait of yourself is such a strange idea to me, and playing along those terms I feel like any of the portraits I make end up being different iterations of what myself and what a portrait and what my art could ever be.” Her paintings were perhaps the most difficult and inaccessible pieces at the show, but were also conceptually interesting and complex. What makes them difficult to digest is the level of ambiguity in them. They seem to contain more questions than answers, and that makes them a fascinating experience.
The back room of the gallery held Houston’s second piece, a two panel video of her, dressed in her underwear, putting Disney princess temporary tattoos on herself and scratching them off. On the surface the piece seemed blatant — female sexualization is hardly a new topic — but while the broad topic may be overplayed, Houston’s specific angle was engaging and fresh. The piece explores the actual physicality of the body, and how “at this age [women] begin to become sexualized by media, other people, themselves, any of those things. And yet it’s also the time when you have, when you personally find the most flaws with your body.” It explores “the juxtaposition of a marred body versus a sexualized one.” The concept of self-sexualization, even in the face of personal insecurity, was shrewdly illustrated by the voyeuristic, yet hesitant feeling of the videos, and the fact that Houston herself was the subject matter.
Mathus summed up the artist’s different takes on the subject of female coming of age in the 21st century, saying, “I think we all evolve through very different ways. Like Jenna’s visual representations and social and cultural stigmas and these different subjects, and Toni's a lot about these retrospective moments, and Kate focuses on the relational and … you putting yourself along with technology and the real world into these relationships. So we’re all focusing on very different works.” Mathus’ own work seems to focus on personal identity and the conception of the self.
The girls also have diverging conceptions about what they want people to take away from the show. James says she hopes to give people, “understanding … or just a glimpse as to what it is [like for girls at that age]. I think what this gallery does is kind of put people in that place themselves, where as maybe before they couldn’t.” Houston’s goal differed slightly because “a lot of the work I do make is for that group. Despite the fact that we’re trying to put other people in that place, I think I’m also trying to bring people who are in that place, some of their things to light, because I feel like sometimes they’re not.” 
Mathus came into the show from a different direction. For her, “it’s not necessarily about you having to put yourself in my shoes, but this is what I’m experiencing, this is what I’m living, and these are the things I’m thinking about and considering, and it’s … not necessarily to put themselves in my shoes, but more to just see what my shoes are.”
Despite these differences, the four girls seem to work together effortlessly. Without coordinating they all arrived in a similar color scheme (mostly soft or dusty purples, pinks, and blues) and aesthetic. In a show full of glitter, bows, and Disney princesses, some people might call them out for falling back on the generically feminine. Mathus counters this conception, saying, “at first we were like, we all love these colors and these things but we don’t want to be pigeon holed by stereotypes or clichéd concepts of what ‘girl’ is. But then we realized, no, we just like these things and it doesn’t matter if they fall under these ideas. It’s who we are and what our art looks like.” The effect is an unabashedly honest show.
With a group of artists that click so well, I would have liked to see more intermixing of their pieces. Their different conceptions of what it means to “become” in this day and age played off of each other well, yet the curating of the show kept each artist and concept separate. The placement of Houston’s memorial and James’ animations was a brilliant move, and I would have liked to see that spirit carried throughout the space.
On the surface, these clear motifs may seem heavy-handed, but as you spend time with each piece and with the show as a whole, the unique, personal angle becomes clear. I will keep returning to Werth’s poetic descriptions and James’ nostalgic animations for a long time. I have already had several illuminating conversations about Mathus’ and Houston’s work as I try to unpack the questions they raised.
By the time this hits stands, On Becoming will be no more. The impression it made, however, remains. This show has raised the bar for exhibits at The Frame. Jenna Houston, Paola Mathus, Kate Werth, and Toni James are all artists worth keeping an eye on.

This Thursday, Carnegie Mellon University hosted a screening of the movie 1982, a film written, produced, and directed by Carnegie Mellon alumnus Tommy Oliver. The film has been shown in film festivals throughout North America, such as the Austin Film Festival, the Nashville Film Festival, and the Toronto Film Festival, and is based on the director’s own childhood experiences.
The film is set in Philadelphia in the year 1982. 1982 is the start of the crack epidemic in Philly” said Oliver, when asked about his title choice. The movie centers around a man named Tim Brown, who desperately tries to keep his family together as his wife enters a downward spiral due to a crack cocaine addiction.
The movie begins by showing us a loving, intact family. Their care for one another is clear, until the mother falls back into her addiction. She disappears from the house, leaving Tim and Maya, the daughter, to fend for themselves. The audience never learns of the mother’s actions while she is out of the house, a nod to Oliver’s own childhood, where he never knew what his mother was up to while she was gone. Shenae, the mother in the movie, comes back from time to time, such as when she spoils her daughter’s birthday and steals her presents for drug money, or when she refuses to support Tim’s story and as a result he is taken to jail. After Tim confronts Shenae’s drug dealer Alonzo, played by Wayne Brady, Alonzo commits a drive-by shooting of Tim’s workplace, regardless of the fact that Maya was actually in the building. Maya survives, and the trauma from the near-death of her daughter causes Shenae to realize the toll of her actions on her family. The movie ends on a slightly optimistic note with Shenae entering rehabilitation to attempt to beat her addiction.
The movie pulls at the heart strings of the viewer, showing one man doing whatever he can to keep his family intact and undergoing hardships that are often hard to watch. Oliver paints a portrait of this era and the debilitating effects it had on the population by telling the story of this one very brave man.
After the film came to a close, Oliver hosted a question and answer session with the audience. He addressed several of the issues he faced when creating this movie, first and foremost the budget constraint. Without the resources of a multi-million dollar Hollywood blockbuster, Oliver had to be creative and cut costs where he could. Nowadays, with the increased availability of camera equipment and less expensive resources, it is “both easier and harder to make a film,” Oliver said. While there is more opportunity to create films on a small budget, many others also have the same opportunity, which increases the competition.
One thing that Tommy Oliver stressed in one of his responses was his desire to make movies that have meaning. Oliver seeks projects that he is passionate about, or that he knows will resonate with the audience. Oliver is particularly passionate about the movie 1982, as it is based on his own childhood experiences. They even chose the set of the film to be the exact neighborhood that Oliver grew up in. There are, however, some major differences between Oliver’s own childhood and the events and settings shown in 1982. Oliver changed the gender of the child in the story, so Maya, played by new actress Troi Zee, is female. Oliver also introduced the father character, a figure who was absent as Oliver was growing up on the streets of Philadelphia.
In addition, Oliver discussed the jump from the business world to the film industry. Graduating from Carnegie Mellon University with a double major in economics and digital media, Oliver entered the work force at Microsoft in Seattle, where he felt like “a hair on a cog of a cog.” Working at such a large company left him feeling like he wasn’t making as large of an impact as he should have been, so he left Microsoft and began focusing on his film career. Oliver has since produced multiple movies such as The Perfect Guy, Kinyarwanda, and Black Eyed Dog. 1982 is the first feature-length film that Oliver has directed.
Finally, Oliver discussed the pressures of creating a film with a black male lead. Many major film studios are unwilling to create a film with a black lead without labeling it a “black movie,” stated Oliver. Oliver argues that his movies are simply movies about people, not necessarily black people. His distaste for the category of “black film” was apparent, as was his determination to not be placed within the constricting boundaries of that category.
Oliver currently has a deal with Lionsgate, and has plans to release more films in the near future.

As many students may remember, the Panther Hollow Inn was a staple of Carnegie Mellon University. With its red tent and brick walls, the bar was a daily hub of nightlife and socializing. Unfortunately, the building was shut down and gutted in 2013, which left the campus community searching for alternate places to hangout. Since the closure of Panther Hollow Inn in 2013, the space has remained empty, although there was talk about the potential opening of a new Chipotle.
Chipotle is a vastly popular Mexican chain restaurant that has become a quick eat haven for young adults. Currently, the nearest location is on Forbes, in the heart of the University of Pittsburgh’s campus, where the line often wraps around the restaurant on the weekends.
The Department of City planning had previously approved an application to renovate the property. There were then plans, with a projected cost of $500,000, to turn the building into a new Chipotle. Next, Pittsburgh confirmed that there were indeed plans to convert the once beloved pizza hub into the fast food burrito chain. A representative of Winthorpe Valentine LP, the owner of the building, briefed the Pittsburgh Planning Commission back in 2014 on plans to renovate the bar into a new restaurant. Work was set to begin on January 15th, 2015, however, over a year later, the building is still empty and there are no works in progress to restore the prime business location on Forbes and Craig.
A second Chipotle on Forbes is a disputable business situation. Only two blocks down, the current Chipotle is booming with business from hungry college students. Pittsburgh is the second most populated American college town after Boston, and thus well-known food chains thrive in this city. Opening another Chipotle near the Carnegie Mellon campus would reduce revenue from the current Chipotle near the Univerisity of Pittsburgh, and the money would simply be reallocated. It would also take pressure off the staff and workers, whose weekend shifts can be tiring. It should be noted that Chipotle is not a franchise, and only opens new branches based on company expansion policies.
Recently, however, Chipotle’s poor reputation has stemmed largely from its multi-state E. coli breakout. The Food and Drug Association has reported that as of Jan. 27, 2016, a total of 55 people have been infected. This has caused the famous chain to shut down 43 restaurants on the West Coast. With thorough investigation, the FDA has attempted to trace back the root cause of the bacterial breakout. Mexican cuisine, however, is hard to trace given the complexity of the dishes. Unfortunately, no isolated ingredient has been identified. Sophomore Ryan Francis points out that investing in another Chipotle is simply a bad idea, as the brand is losing profit. Instead, Francis would prefer to see a gluten-free option closer to campus, similar to Gluuteny’s location on Murray. Sophomores Sally Sohn and Megha Joshi concur, stating that there are already so many dining options near campus. The two vouched for a convenience store, especially given that Entropy is not open 24 hours.
As of now, the sacred ruins of Panther Hollow Inn have not been touched, and it does not seem that the city is proposing plans on them either. Carnegie Mellon’s Dining Services is also in the dark regarding the ideal location’s renovation.

This Saturday, members of the Carnegie Mellon community traveling down Forbes Avenue were greeted with the sight of multiple construction workers hard at work attempting to halt damage that took place the previous night. At around 11 p.m. last Friday, a 12-inch water main ruptured on Forbes Avenue, near Hamburg Hall, the Tepper Quad construction site, and the Robert Mehrabian Collaborative Innovation Center (CIC), Carnegie Mellon officials reported in an email that was released to the student body.
Among the many workers in hard hats and other individuals attempting to resolve this issue were Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority members, Pittsburgh Public Works, CSX Railroad, Campus Design & Facility Development, and Pittsburgh and University Police officers. The effort being put into this project was put into perspective when witnessing the massive amount of water spewing from the water main, which was traveling along Forbes, creating its own self-contained flood.
As a result of this water main break, the section of Forbes Avenue between Morewood Avenue and S. Craig Street, as well as one of the two adjacent sidewalks, was blocked, halting traffic in this area. Additionally, Neville Street, from the Bellefield Boiler Plant to Winthrop Street, remained closed.
Students were seen shuffling along the remaining open sidewalk on Forbes with many stopping to stare at the event that was unfolding in front of them. 
This not only affected traffic along Forbes Avenue, but due to its location near the Carnegie Mellon campus, it also had a direct impact on students in nearby buildings. Hamburg Hall, Smith Hall, and the Robert Mehrabian Collaborative Innovation Center (CIC) were facing lower and lower water pressure throughout the day until the buildings lost water service completely. Students and faculty members within these buildings were advised to use restrooms elsewhere throughout the day.
Due to the inaccessibility of traffic in this area, the Warner Hall, Gates, and CIC parking garages were closed off. Carnegie Mellon officials compensated for this by making free parking available “in the East Campus Garage for those permit holders affected by the traffic restrictions,” as stated in an official Carnegie Mellon alert post.
Passersby were advised to stay clear of the area due to concerns for their safety when approaching the heavy machinery that was being utilized to contain the issue. As stated in an updated alert posted on Sunday morning, it is still unclear when repairs will be completed.
As of 12 p.m. Sunday afternoon, water service was reportedly restored to Hamburg Hall, Smith Hall, and CIC. In the updated alert message, University officials stated “PWSA’s replacement of a valve leading to a 6-inch water line to Hamburg Hall was instrumental in restoring water service.” The workers involved in this project should be commended for their relatively speedy work when faced with this unexpected emergency.
The continuous updates that were posted throughout Saturday and Sunday in response to this water main break can be found on www.cmu.edu/alert.

Computer scientist Judea Pearl wins 2015 Dickinson Prize in Science Award
Judea Pearl, a professor of computer science at UCLA, has been awarded Carnegie Mellon University’s 2015 Dickinson Prize in Science. The Dickinson Prize in Science was established in 1969 by physician Joseph Z. Dickinson and his wife Agnes Fisher Dickinson to award individuals in the United States who have made outstanding contributions to the field of science.
Pearl has been a faculty member at UCLA since 1970, and directs the University’s Cognitive Systems Laboratory. He is internationally known for his contributions to the fields of artificial intelligence, human cognition, and the philosophy of science. His work has not only influenced machine learning, but also computer vision, robotics, natural language processing, computational biology, econometrics, cognitive science, and statistics. This list of Pearl’s many accomplishments provides the basis for his earning this distinguished prize.
This highly esteemed award comes with a medal and a cash prize. A portion of this cash prize will be donated to Pearl’s alma mater, the Technion, where he earned his bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering. Another portion will be going to the Daniel Pearl Foundation, named after Pearl’s son, a journalist, who was murdered in Pakistan in 2002.
Pearl will accept his award on Monday, Feb. 29, and will present the Dickinson Prize Lecture titled “Science, Counterfactuals, and Free Will” in the McConomy Auditorium in the University Center.
Carnegie Mellon study warns charging cars overnight causes harmful emissions
A study published this week in Environmental Research Letters by Carnegie Mellon faculty members warns that even though charging electric vehicles overnight puts less pressure on the power grids, the resulting greenhouse gas emissions outweigh the cost benefits.
The research was led by professor of mechanical engineering and engineering and public policy Jeremy Michalek. He and his team of researchers used the PJM Interconnection, which supplies electricity to most of the eastern United States, to model their work. They found that when electric vehicle drivers charge their cars overnight, the electricity is a quarter to a third cheaper to produce; however, this is because the grids switch to power from coal.
Coal plants tend to operate below capacity at night, so they are available to meet the increased need posed by charge cars. But these plants produce sulfur dioxide, which, according to Michalek, “can cause 50 percent higher costs to human health and the environment.”
In a separate study, Michalek and his team looked at the national effects of charging vehicles overnight. They confirmed that the effects on emissions that they discovered for the eastern United States are true across the country.
Michalek says that these effects may not be permanent, however. As the grid becomes cleaner and we phase out harmful energy sources such as coal, cleaner sources of energy will be able to fulfill the late-night need. But because the government has been slow to legislate for cleaner energy sources, this may take some time. In the meantime, Michalek and his team discourage overnight charging.

Every first-year reads Randy Pausch’s The Last Lecture before starting at Carnegie Mellon. The book tells Pausch’s story of his persistence to keep a positive outlook on life despite his battle with cancer and leaving his final legacy. During his last lecture at Carnegie Mellon, Pausch offered his final words of wisdom and inspired the audience members, particularly the students, to educate and empower themselves before they embark on their individual ventures.
The Last Lecture, inspired The First Lectures Series, which is a series of student lectures given by seniors before they graduate from the university. These lectures are read in three separate events throughout the semester. During each event, two peer-nominated seniors share their experiences at Carnegie Mellon and offer their advice to current students.
This Wednesday marked the first installment of this year’s First Lectures Series. Students flocked to Doherty Hall to hear seniors Sneha Kannoth, who is majoring in neuroscience, and Jeremy Applebaum, a chemistry major, tell their stories.
Kannoth’s Story:
Sneha Kannoth started off as a premedicine mathematics major. She was obsessed with grades, which is a problem that many Carnegie Mellon students can empathize with. However, Kannoth had a brilliant revelation. She decided to officially declare five different majors not just because she wasn’t sure what she wanted to pursue, but because she was so afraid of remaining undecided. Some of these majors were mathematics, biology, and chemistry. After remaining in major limbo for a while, she did finally decide to pursue a degree in neuroscience.
To conclude her lecture she imparted the following words to current Carnegie Mellon students: “I propose we graduate, along with our respective major, with a degree in ‘undecided.’”
Her overall message: it’s okay to be undecided.
Applebaum’s Story:
Jeremy Applebaum was admitted to Carnegie Mellon off of the waitlist. He described his happiness, surprise, and excitement upon receiving this last minute notice of acceptance. Without hesitation, he decided to submit his deposit.
Soon thereafter, he discovered that his decision to attend Carnegie Mellon would not always leave him with the feelings of excitement he initially felt upon notice of his acceptance. He found himself facing some negative consequences.
For one, Applebaum constantly felt like he had to prove himself because he was initially waitlisted. Not only did he feel pressured to prove himself, but he also started to doubt his ability to fall in line with the high work rigor that is often associated with the students of Carnegie Mellon. He described a moment when one professor showed Jeremy’s class a slide that read “my heart is in the” followed by a blank line.
Applebaum stated that he “didn’t have anything to fill the blank line.”
Throughout his life, Applebaum felt as though he was constantly being told “no.” At the end of his lecture he proposed that our generation be the “just-say-yes generation.” He encouraged the audience to say yes to new environments, new things, and new opportunities.
To conclude, Applebaum showed pictures of what he said yes to; underwear bike races, spontaneous ski trips, and other unique opportunities.
“Being in college is a license to be dumb, so put yourself out there and say yes.”
The next lecture in this series will take place on March 16 from 4:30 to 6 p.m., with student speakers Rubini Naidu, a psychology major, and electrical and computer engineering major Nitsan Shai. The final lecture will take place on April 13 during the same time with electrical and computer engineering and human-computer interaction double major Erik Pintar, and electrical and computer engineering major Wole Idowu. These lectures will take place in Porter Hall 100.

On Wednesday, Feb. 17, Donald Trump took on his most formidable foe yet: the Pope. While returning from a visit to Mexico’s border with the United States, Pope Francis was asked about Donald Trump. He said, “A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian.” The Pope’s comments sparked widespread controversy and debate over whether the Pope had crossed a line by commenting so frankly on politics. Donald Trump responded, “for a religious leader to question a person’s faith is disgraceful.” Other Republicans defended Trump, suggesting that it isn’t the Pope’s place to get involved in politics. They couldn’t be more wrong.
Why is it disgraceful for a religious leader to question your faith? Isn’t it a religious leader’s job to question your faith and challenge you to be a better Christian? The Pope, the world’s most influential and popular religious figure, is clearly qualified to offer his opinion on what makes a good Christian. You don’t have to agree with the Pope, or even adhere to the same faith as him, to admit that he clearly has some authority on the matter.
“But Emmett,” I hear you say, “It’s not the Pope’s place to get involved in politics.” Perhaps, under different circumstances, this would be true. But politicians, especially Republicans, routinely parade their faith to earn votes. And if Republicans make their faith an issue of the political debate, then criticism about their faith is fair game, especially from religious leaders who have authority in that field to offer insights.
Donald Trump has stood on a stage in Iowa, not once, but twice, waving his Bible in the air to prove his Christian bona fides to religious supporters. Ted Cruz rallies are as much religious revivals as they are campaign events. Marco Rubio has an ad called “Faith” in which he says, “The purpose of our life is to cooperate with God’s plan.” All three candidates fight over Evangelicals like three raccoons who have found the last trash can on Earth.
The Pope isn’t infringing on the political world; rather, the candidates brought religious discourse into the political fray. Since the Pope is one of the world’s most important religious leaders, and since Republicans made religion an election issue, the Pope has every right to get involved in politics. If the candidates made their economic platforms a central campaign issue, you wouldn’t bemoan economists for offering their analysis. In the same way, you can’t begrudge the Pope for taking a stance when the candidates have made their faith central to their campaigns.
“But Emmett,” you say, in that pesky way that you insert yourself into my articles, “faith is different. It’s between each individual and the God that they worship. It’s not supposed to be about how you live your public life.” To the contrary, the Pope and many other Christians  believe that the only way to truly express genuine Christian belief is to act like Jesus acted. Which is to say by feeding the hungry, and healing the sick, and forgiving people, and practicing nonviolence, and resisting cruelty and oppression.
I would direct you to a little text called the Bible, which, I’ve be told, offers some important insights about Christian living. In Matthew 25, Jesus himself said, “Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.” In other words, Christians show their love for Jesus in the way they treat others. Jesus also said, in John 13, “A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.” A Catholic could also focus on James 2: 17-24, which says, “Faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead… You see that a person is considered righteous by what they do and not by faith alone.”
Catholic social gospel, which the Pope obviously advocates, teaches that it is every Christian’s responsibility to enact their faith and improve the world through acts of goodwill and compassion. If they don’t, then they can’t really be said to have much faith at all. 
You don’t have to agree with this interpretation to understand why the Pope said what he said. To many evangelical Christians, the most important relationship is a private one between each individual and God. But to many others, including the Pope, Christians express their love for God by loving other people.
Pope Francis also needs to speak up because his is a much-needed perspective. When it comes to immigration, I wish that the Republican candidates, especially Donald Trump, would take a look inside the Bibles that they so gleefully wave about:
Exodus 22:21 — “Do not mistreat or oppress a foreigner, for you were foreigners in Egypt.”
Leviticus 19:34 — “The foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native-born. Love them as yourself, for you were foreigners in Egypt.”
Deuteronomy 10:18-19 — “He ... loves the foreigner residing among you, giving them food and clothing. And you are to love those who are foreigners, for you yourselves were foreigners in Egypt.”
Hebrews 13:1-2 — “Do not forget to show hospitality to strangers, for by so doing some people have shown hospitality to angels without knowing it.”
That, more than any other reason, is why it’s so important for the Pope to get involved. If we want to overcome Donald Trump’s nativist, racist rhetoric on immigration, we have to do it by working within the prevailing argument planes within the Republican party, and one of those planes is religion. 
Whether you believe that faith belongs in political discourse or not doesn’t really matter, because it’s already there. Religion is a major aspect of political identity, especially in the Republican party. 
The least we can do is value religious voices like Pope Francis that are leveraging spiritual arguments to advocate justice and mercy for immigrants. It is through those types of arguments that we have the best hope of making a difference.

Two weeks ago, America witnessed a bizarre spat between two hilariously dissimilar celebrities: Pope Francis and Donald Trump.
During a recent interview aboard the papal airplane, Pope Francis incited a wide range of reactions across the country when when a reporter asked for his opinion of Trump, and Trump’s infamously controversial proposal to build a wall between the United States and Mexico to keep out illegal immigrants. The Pope responded, “…a person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian. This is not in the Gospel.” He went on to qualify his statement, saying, “We must see if he said things in that way and in this I give the benefit of the doubt.” The real estate mogul replied, with a virtuously offended air, that it was “really, not a nice thing to say,” and that “for a religious leader to question a person’s faith is disgraceful.” The Pope’s single initial comment resulted in a heated media debate concerning the involvement of religion in politics due to Trump’s plan to build a wall between the United States and Mexico to keep out illegal immigrants.
However, the issue here is not of religious commentary in politics. For Christians, religion affects every other domain of life, so the Church’s opinion is relevant on many non-religious debates, including the political race. Yet many Christians are indignant about the comment, specifically because he seemed to challenge the candidate’s faith. There exists disregarded context surrounding the situation, however, which clarifies that although the Pope did not mean to accuse Trump of not being Christian, the statement was still a very inappropriate one for him to make.
It is important to note, in advance, that many news sources put excessive emphasis on the phrase “not Christian,” while in reality, Pope Francis’ entire statement regarding Donald Trump was much less aggressive than that single phrase. Most major news sources led with a headline quoting the phrase “not Christian,” making the quote needlessly inflammatory.
Pope Francis has earned a wonderful reputation as a man of great compassion. It is easy to understand his desire to affect change, express his opinion, and encourage acceptance of a topic very close to his heart. As a South American, he cares greatly about issues regarding the well-being of Hispanic and Latino immigrants. Therefore, his urge to use his ability to influence and aid that cause is very understandable.
However, there are centuries of context surrounding his authority as Pope, and the phrase “not Christian” carries a lot of additional meaning, most of it unintentional. It’s is a very common phrase, something that Pope Francis has probably used many times throughout his life. It’s probable that the Pope did not mean to say that Donald Trump is not a Christian, but that he’s not exhibiting Christian values. It was not a question of faith’s existence, but a criticism of its bearer’s actions.
Unfortunately, in Catholicism, Pope Francis happens to be the one person on the planet who can actually decide if someone’s Christian or not. Catholic popes have the ability to excommunicate people who they deem unfit to remain in the Church, although the ability has not be exercised in many years.
Excommunication is essentially saying that someone is no longer a Christian. In addition, Catholic faith also has a concept of papal infallibility. Basically, this is a belief that the Pope, on subjects of faith or morals, cannot be wrong, and so every Catholic has the obligation to obey him. So his position as the ultimate authority on what is or is not Christian adds significance to the phrase “not Christian.”
In this vividly theatrical political race, criticism of Donald Trump has become routine, even from the Vicar of Christ. The Pope’s unfortunate wording allowed news media to invent a headlining squabble between the two characters, adding yet more drama to this political popularity contest and distracting from the real issues.

On the night of Saturday, Feb. 20, Jason Brian Dalton, a 45-year-old Uber driver with a wife and two kids, went on a shooting rampage in Kalamazoo, Michigan. He left six people dead and two injured. The victims apparently had no connection to Dalton and were randomly picked as targets. It’s a community’s worst nightmare — “How do you go and tell the families of these victims that they weren’t targeted for any reason other than they were there to be a target?” said Kalamazoo County prosecutor Jeff Getting to 
The Atlantic.
Unfortunately, this kind of gun violence is not uncommon in the United States. In fact, according to the Mass Shooting Tracker, which defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are shot (including the shooter, should they shoot themselves), the Kalamazoo shooting was the 44th mass shooting in 2016. Since Kalamazoo, at the time that this article was written, six more incidences of mass shootings have been added to the list, bringing the total number of mass shootings in the first 57 days of 2016 to 50, the number of people injured to 173, and the number of fatalities to 78.
Every time a tragedy like Kalamazoo makes the headlines, there are dozens of similar tragedies that fly under the radar, such as the workplace shooting in Hesston, Kansas on Thursday, Feb. 25, that left four dead and 14 injured at multiple sites, or the man who shot and killed four people on a rural property in Belfair, Washington before shooting himself, also on Feb. 25. Mass shootings have become commonplace occurrences. Some are premeditated; others are random. Some have no fatalities, while others are deadly. Some are committed by mentally healthy people, while others are committed by people struggling with mental illness, but they all end the same way — with a community left devastated and terrified of weapons from which they cannot protect themselves.
While mass shootings have become common in the United States, they are not nearly as commonplace in other developed countries. According to the Human Development Index, for every one million Americans, there are 29.7 homicides by firearms each year, the highest in the world. The nation with the next highest rate is Switzerland, who has only 7.7 firearm homicides per million people.
We need to start looking at the rate of mass shootings and gun violence in the United States as a problem with a solution, not just a series of tragedies that are bound to happen in a world where guns and violent people exist. We cannot simply turn away from these tragedies and say that “guns don’t kill people, people kill people.” It is true that a gun cannot shoot on its own, but it is also true that for a person with a gun, especially with a semiautomatic handgun that can be easily concealed, such as the gun that Dalton used, it only takes a pull of a trigger to end someone’s life. It just takes a split second of rash decision-making, a brief wave of uncontrollable anger, or a slip of a finger. How can we stand idly by and not acknowledge how much easier guns make it for people to kill people? How can we try and justify this loss of life by saying “it wasn’t the gun’s fault?”
As Americans, we have Second Amendment rights that entitle us to the possession and protection of firearms. This is a right born out of the desire to protect ourselves and our families, and that is definitely a worthy endeavor. But when we as a country face incidences of mass shootings on an almost-daily basis, when our desire to protect enables others to destroy, there is something fundamentally wrong with the laws and attitudes surrounding guns. This is not a question of who has what rights, it is not a question of the power of the government, and it is not a question of what party the NRA supports. This is an issue that pertains to the saftey and well-being of American citizens and must be treated as such.
According to Vox.com, “In Australia, after a 1996 mass shooting, lawmakers passed new restrictions on guns and imposed a mandatory buyback program … seizing at least 650,000 firearms. According to one review of the evidence by Harvard researchers, Australia’s homicide rate dropped about 42 percent in the seven years after the law was passed and its firearm suicide rate fell by 57 percent.” In the United States, where gun culture is very much ingrained in our society, a buyback program like this would not stand a chance of passing in Washington, and even if it did, it would not be a be-all, end-all solution to gun violence. People will find ways to get guns if they want guns, and there is no legislative action that can prevent this. But Australia is an important case study to consider — when we limit the number of guns available, there is a likely chance that the amount of gun violence will decrease. When less people have guns, it makes sense that guns will kill less people.
Mass shootings do not have to be things that just happen, even in the United States. A high rate of gun violence does not have to be a defining trait of this country. But without a change of attitude concerning gun control, there will be nothing done to prevent more innocent people from being killed. If we are not able to look past the controversy and really consider how we can enable people to protect themselves with guns while better protecting people from guns, nothing will change. My thoughts and prayers go out to the people of Kalamazoo, to the people of Hesston and Belfair, and the other 47 places in the United States that have experienced mass shootings in 2016. May these tragedies serve as a wakeup call for change.

Earlier this month, when the FBI announced that they were unable to open the phone of one of the San Bernardino shooters due to an automatic self-erase feature iPhones initiate after ten failed passcode attempts, they obtained a court order to have Apple help them create software that can unlock the phone. From the start, Apple has made it clear that they will not support any activities that risk people’s privacy.
Apple’s position seems to be protective of the basic rights of U.S. citizens. In doing so, however, they are unwilling to help protect the public from further terrorist attacks. Since 2013, there has been a 35 percent increase in terrorist attacks worldwide. Any evidence about the shooters from San Bernardino could provide information about future attacks by people related to the shooters and how they can be prevented. Messages, contacts, or photos could provide information about other people who were aiding them, and these people must be held accountable in court for what they did. Specifically, the FBI believes, “the device may hold clues about whom the couple communicated with and where they may have traveled,” according to Fox News. Although commitment to privacy sends out an important message to Apple’s customers, the safety of the U.S. people goes beyond supporting any individual basic rights.
Apple’s disagreement with the government has also upset the families of victims of the December attack, who want justice for what happened to them and their families. In the past week, they have all come together to file documents supporting the FBI in their legal battle. Families of the victims are demanding answers for what happened and how they were targeted. Robert Velasco, who lost his daughter in the shooting, spoke for many of the families when he told The Associated Press, “The only way to find out [what happened] is to open up that phone and get in there ... we’re kind of angry and confused as to why Apple is refusing to do this.” The victims are not alone in this opinion: in poll done by the Pew Research Center, 51 percent of Americans said that Apple should unlock the iPhone, while 38 percent said that Apple should ensure the security of user information. Apple is in opposition with the majority of people they are claiming to defend.
Even though Apple has previously cooperated with court orders to release information from private phones, this is the first case in which the government has asked them to create new software that will make it easier to unlock the phone. The main law referenced in these types of court cases is the All Writs Act,, which allows the government to issue orders to seize any information that is not required to be released under other laws.
Apple does not feel obligated to create the software the government is asking for, especially since it puts information from users of all  of their devices at risk. New decryption technology would make it so that texts, emails, photos, and other private documents would be vulnerable to being read by other people. However, Apple must take into consideration their powerful standing as a tech company: they have a monopoly on products that have the potential to go beyond the grasp of the government. It opens up the possibility that people can find ways to break laws and avoid being caught. This makes the court case an important precedent for other technology companies to learn from.

It’s very telling that of the five remaining candidates with a meaningful shot at the presidency, three have deep ties to New York City. Trump University President Donald Trump and Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT), both boisterous demagogues with little respect for those who disagree, personify some classic traits of New Yorkers, and their Big Apple origins inform their candidacies in ways that are not immediately obvious. Both of their anti-elite bona fides were established fighting battles central to the heart of New York City lore. Former Secretary of state Hillary Clinton’s ties are purely political, she literally moved to New York State because she was told she ought to run for senate, but they are also meaningful for exploring other parts of her candidacy that have been off-putting to the rest of the nation.
The Trump campaign is immediately bizarre. His campaign is catering to those Americans who feel disenfranchised, but the white nationalism he espouses is built to disenfranchise. His campaign is appealing to the conservative grassroots, but he’s the candidate least consistent with conservative orthodoxy. He plans to bust up the rule of the political elite, but he’s a high profile billionaire. Those first two are bizarre and deeply uncomfortable truths about his candidacy given his frontrunner status in the GOP nomination race, but the third requires a deeper look into the origin story of the man whose business ventures are so legendarily catastrophic that he seemingly is only a billionaire because he says so.
Donald Trump is a product of Queens, New York’s most populous borough. That population, however, does not contain most of New York’s moneyed elite. Trump’s consistent mentions of fellow Queens native Carl Icahn have become notable on the campaign trail and the Donald has always shown an affinity for New York’s outer boroughs over the island in its center. In a recent interview with Politico, Reverend Al Sharpton, a high profile civil rights activist also from Queens, said that Donald Trump does feel like he was shut out of Manhattan’s upper echelon and he never felt like he was taken seriously.
It feels absurd to those of us who have not amassed a billion dollars, but Donald Trump has a real conviction that he is on the outside looking in at elitists unwilling to give him a chance. New York City’s Manhattan-centric culture really has left scars on a lot of people. Referring to Manhattan as “the city” and the centrality of the borough to New York lore has always led to a bit of resentment from denizens of the outer boroughs. The “Manhattan douchebags” are featured at every public school (and private school, but there they are called “students”) across the whole city. 
This election shows what happens when that mindset is universalized. Trump believes political elites are happy to destroy things they do not care about if it doesn’t affect them. New York’s LaGuardia Airport has been clogging up traffic in Queens for years and it benefits absolutely no one except whoever happens to be living in Gracie Mansion at the time. Trump seems to think immigration and trade are the result of American political elites feeling the same way about places between the coastal populations of the country. Trump’s answer to how he feels the political elite operate overcompensates. To defeat the Manhattanites that rejected him, Trump wants absolute power and to prove he is beyond reproach. The results would almost certainly be disastrous.
Bernie Sanders hails from Midwood, Brooklyn, a heavily Jewish neighborhood that has become more diverse over time. Sanders is a classic Brooklyn Jewish socialist. He may get that meshugana health care plan from those Danes, but Jewish community leaders would kvell at how eloquently their boychik defends old Brooklyn Jewish feelings on labor policy. What a mensch.
While Sanders gets some of his policies from the democratic socialist nations in Scandinavia, he has a different driving philosophy behind it. Scandinavia’s policies are often couched in rhetoric about the unified nature of all of their citizens. Sanders, on the other hand, wants to create a unified front against the rich. This was the reaction of Jewish families that came to America post-Holocaust. When families came across the Atlantic to escape the Holocaust and other acts of anti-Semitism, Jewish communities became very sparse and started to band together very tightly. That said, as a result of the Jewish diaspora, Jewish people have been ethnically diverse for a long time and shtunks with their local businesses tried to exploit Jewish immigrants, many of whom were quite poor, by pitting different ethnic groups against one another through rumors and other slander. American Jews, especially in New York, have been in our fair share of ethnic squabbles, but whether we are religious or not, the closeness of our community means everything to Jews. In a touching answer to a question of Islamophobia, Sanders’ extension of this idea into modern politics sees discrimination as a weapon in class warfare and vows to fight against the rich and show rachmones to the poor.
The impulse towards Jewish Socialism is certainly noble, but, like Bernie, has become something of an alter cocker in the intervening years. Sanders’ policy often seems designed to watch the wealthy squeal, rather than provide meaningful benefits for the average citizen beyond vague appeals to a rigged economy. Furthermore, many people believe Sanders has a myopic view of discrimination and would do little for people who face structural barriers outside of the generational wealth people are endowed with by the lottery of birth.
Being a Jewish native of the Bronx, I see these two forces in action on a regular basis. The pair, though they have their issues, is powerful in New York politics. New York has a long line of Republicans in Name Only (RINOs) who identify with the outer boroughs and resonate with Republicans more culturally than on a policy level (for example, former Mayor Rudy Giuliani) and liberal progressives who will go on never-ending rampages against inequality despite occasional opposition from those they seek to help (current mayor Bill de Blasio). Of course, there are some self-described saviors, the classically arrogant New Yorkers who believe they can micromanage everyone into their preferences and save us from the terrifying extremes of the New York left and right (lookin’ at you, Bloomberg) who are lurking just outside our main focus in case this presidential race devolves into a New York style political brawl. 
The trope of New Yorkers and our bizarre brand of libertarian socialism just does not fit nicely on the whole nation’s ideological scale. This can make New York’s political landscape incredibly hard to navigate, especially for an outsider. One person who has answered the call, however, is Clinton, our senator from 2001 to 2009.
Clinton has always gotten a lukewarm reception from the residents of New York, even liberal New York City. The Clintons were not particularly popular upon exiting the White House. Their image was marred by controversial policy actions like some of Bill Clinton’s presidential pardons and crime bills, as well as a series of well-known scandals. Hillary Clinton ran for Senate anyway in a non-competitive election. 
However, she immediately got to work as a very pragmatic politician. While she was distinctly liberal, she also built a powerful base of support in New York, particularly with Wall Street, that reviled strip of the Financial District in lower Manhattan. This did not endear her to New Yorkers, but in the absence of meaningful competition, she was able to snag a second term in the Senate on her way to announcing a presidential run. New Yorkers had her back against President Barack Obama, though. We may not like to admit it, but Wall Street basically keeps our entire state solvent. We know she understands how to rein such interests in — Wall Street has become astonishingly liberal in recent years — without ignoring them completely and alienating important power players. A lot of people see this as shilling, some see it as pragmatism. The nation’s answer to that dilemma will probably decide this election.
New York has always been a cultural and political outlier in America. There is a real disdain for New York outside of the city. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) made hay after associating Trump with “New York values.” Rome, Italy or London, England would never be forced into the embarrassment of having to pay for a national tragedy on par with 9/11 out of their city budgets, but New York did. However, if you put the right faces to what we really have to say, it seems maybe we were never the outlier after all.

The concept of a dress code, like most systems society likes to fetishize, isn’t inherently bad. It’s meant to maintain standards for presentability, respectability, and professionalism. It represents values that are collectively held in high esteem by members of the society it originates from. Or rather, it often represents values that are regarded as being worthy of aspiration by the few in power, based on their prejudices and biases, and which are then imposed on the section of the population under their control. It’s not necessarily a bad thing, but, like most social structures, it is poorly defined and therefore open to misinterpretation and manipulation.
Last month, Kansas Senator Mitch Holmes wrote a guideline for the Kansas Senate Ethics and Election Committee, which details etiquette and rules for testifying witnesses. The second rule on the guideline reads: “Conferees should be dressed in professional attire. For ladies, low-cut necklines and miniskirts are inappropriate.” Nowhere does it detail at what length does a skirt become a miniskirt. Nor does it list any restrictions specific to men. After several days of attention scrutiny from the media, he retracted his statement. However, this case isn’t an outlier. This is merely a relatively harmless example of a much larger phenomenon, something so normalized that we often forget it’s even happening.
In March, Maggie Sunseri, a student at Woodford County High School in Versailles, Kentucky, released a documentary titled Shame: A Documentary on School Dress Code chronicling the experiences of girls at the school. Over the course of the documentary, we find out that the teachers enforce the school dress code unequally. In particular, girls are called out way more often than boys for breaches in the dress code, leading to loss of class time, trips to the principal’s office, and public humiliation. An example of the unreasonable nature of their policies is the criterion that girls shouldn’t expose their collarbones. However, it is the principle behind this that is even more disturbing. In the documentary, Principal Akers comments that problems with sexual harassment had been a motivating factor in the stricter implementation of the dress code. In particular, “certain outfits that [female students] wore created this situation where guys would make inappropriate statements, and there was a distraction to the learning environment based on what some of the folks were wearing at school.” And of course the way to change this is to limit the girls’ freedom. A high school junior in the film states that the implementation of the dress code is sexist to both men and women since it “perpetuates the notion that a woman’s body is inherently more sexual than a man’s body, and that young boys’ natural tendencies are to harass or assault women.”
This specific instance points to the larger problem of trying to create guidelines for a topic as tied to gender roles a clothing is in our society. It ultimately comes down to the fact that society considers men and women to be different in more ways than just certain biological features. They’re also supposed to have distinct personalities and priorities, both of which are reflected in their choices of clothing. This is reflected in the numerous double standards in workplace dress codes that are so ingrained in us that we don’t even notice their existence. For example, men aren’t allowed long hair, facial piercings or make up in many jobs in the service industry, while women are often forced to dress in hypersexualized clothing such as skinny jeans and heels. And God forbid if you’re outside the gender binary! A 2013 GSLN survey showed that 19 percent of LGBT students were prevented from wearing clothes that were thought to be from another gender while nearly 32 percent of transgender students were prevented from wearing clothes that differed from those designated for their legal sex.
Our social institutions are a reflection of who we are as a collective, and until very recently, we were extremely sexist, homophobic, and plain bigoted. Therefore, it makes sense that these conventions have bled into daily lives, our subconscious even, until we find it hard to imagine a world without them. When was the last time you saw a man in a skirt, or a woman in a crop top and yoga pants walk by on the street without attracting stares (for very different reasons, I know)? I’m not saying this can, or will, change overnight. However, the first step is always to recognize that there is a problem.

In the wake of Justice Antonin Scalia’s death, there has been a great deal of speculation about how the U.S. government should proceed. On the Democratic side, there are those that want to see Barack Obama appoint a new justice before he leaves office. In contrast, there are members of the Republican Party that do not want Obama to appoint anyone before his tenure as president is over. Among those opposed to Obama appointing a new justice is Senator Pat Toomey (R-PA).
Toomey is very adamant about Obama putting off the decision until the next president is in office. Toomey believes that, by waiting until the next president has been elected, the American people will have a more direct influence on the choice. By stalling on the nomination, the vacant seat will be left open for at least 415 days, making it the seventh longest Supreme Court vacancy in history. This is in sharp contrast to the average vacancy of 67 days. The Republican party’s decision to strike down any nominee not only blocks the president from exercising his constitutional powers, but can severely influence the judicial process for the Supreme Court. 
A Public Policy Polling survey found that 76 percent of Pennsylvanian voters disagree with Toomey’s obstructionist policies. This is only one of several recent issues that has caused him to be viewed in a negative light by many Pennsylvania voters. Of interest to The Tartan is how voter apathy towards local elections and a lack of voter education has resulted in Pennsylvania being represented by someone who does not share the same beliefs as the people he was elected to represent.
Despite being passionate about a variety of large scale issues and putting a great deal of effort into campaigning, younger people did not turn up in the polls in 2010 when Toomey was elected. This lack of turnout caused a significant shift in Pennsylvania’s representation in Congress. The reason for this lackluster turnout boils down to an idea many young people hold that they are not actually able to change anything in politics. Many young people believe that voting won’t actually lead to a solution. It tends to be the case that despite caring about local issues, young adults don’t care about voting in local elections. 
Recently, a petition was started to make Pat Toomey do his job of advising and consenting to a nominee put forward by Obama. Toomey’s agreement to prevent an appointment is rendering him useless as a Senator. He was elected to perform his constitutional duties, but is failing to fulfill his obligations when he threatens to block the president from carrying out a constitutional process. It is his duty, and the duty of all members in Congress, to allow a nominee to be appointed to the court. 
Toomey claims that it is quite a common occurrence to leave court vacancies open for extended periods of time during election years. This claim, however, is false. He is violating vital constitutional processes, but more importantly, he is letting down those who have entrusted him with the power to represent them fairly and accurately. The Pennsylvanian population now has to react by petitioning for Toomey to represent them because of the lack of action by voters during the midterm elections.
Toomey has also been ducking the question of if he would be willing to meet with a Supreme Court nominee. This leads many to assume that Toomey would reject meeting with any nominee. This is a blatant obstruction of the constitutional process. It’s already upsetting that he decided to side with congressional Republicans on their decision to likely decline any nominees, but now there’s a chance that he won’t even consider siding with the people he was elected to represent.
The fact that he is going against a three quarters majority of public opinion raises questions about Toomey’s loyalty to citizens of the Keystone State. He seems to value his ties and relations in D.C. more than the trust of his constituents. As a Senator, he was elected to be a trustee, meaning that those who voted for him entrust him to speak and advocate on their behalf. 
However, it seems more as if he’s been acting as a delegate for the Republicans of D.C. Toomey seems to be falling in line with Republican Senate leadership in their vow to block any decision made by Obama rather than acting on behalf of those who elected him. He’s a perfect example of an elected official who would rather strengthen personal ties with his party lines in D.C. rather than act as an effective proponent for the people who elected him.
Despite Toomey’s choice to back the party’s decision to reject any justice nominee, it’s hard to put the blame on Toomey’s shoulders alone. The blame falls, at least in part, on those who did not vote in the 2010 midterm elections. Despite having 8,478,509 people registered in Pennsylvania at the time of the election, only 3,977,661 people actually voted in the election. The lack of turnout on election day resulted in a shift from a Democrat to a Republican trustee, and a trustee who does not accurately embody the will of the people. This highlights a critical issue: Low voter turnout leads to unfavorable candidates being elected.
While it might seem like local elections are not as important as the presidential elections, they are probably the most important. Voting in local elections is a great way for citizens to most directly have their voices heard in Congress. It’s important to elect someone that the entire population can trust. If less than half of the voting population is actually voting,  it’s hard to have any influence over what happens in D.C. Those that complain about not being represented are most often the ones that do not vote to make their voices heard. 
There needs to be a shift in the way local elections are thought of. We must place more emphasis on local elections, and young people need to realize the importance of voting. It is not enough to be passionate about issues and advocate for candidates. Voter turnout needs to increase for accurate and effective representation to be put in place. If there is no change in voter turnout, there will be no change in representation. Consequently, it is likely that there will be other elected Senators with only 24 percent of the population in agreement with them.
The last day to register for the upcoming election, in which Toomey is up for reelection, is March 28, 2016. That deadline is creeping up fast, and many college aged people still aren’t registered. You can register in Pennsylvania by going to the Pennsylvania Department of State website and clicking on Voter Registration. The actual election will take place on April 26, 2016. Democracy only works when people participate by registering and showing up to the polls on election day.
