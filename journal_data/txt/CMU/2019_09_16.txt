The 2019 World Para Swimming Championships kicked off last Monday in London, and spectators didn’t have to wait long for excitement and drama to set in. 
The women’s 400m freestyle S6 final, a classification of disability for the athletes, was the second medaling event of the championship, and witnessed a newcomer, 14-year-old Jiang Yuyan (蒋裕燕) of China, facing off against Paralympic champion and world record holder Yelyzaveta Mereshko of Ukraine. 
Jiang came into the competition with a time of 5:31.44, and had put up a time of 5:24.92 in her heat that morning, finishing nearly one and a half seconds behind Mereshko, but qualifying for finals in second place. Because eight out of the nine swimmers in the heat would move on to the finals, the pace wasn’t exactly cutthroat, and neither woman was close to Mereshko’s world record of 5:14.69. 
The finals of the women’s 400m freestyle S6 began with Mereshko having the best start off the blocks (Jiang taking more than a half-second longer). Using the momentum from her start, along with a high stroke rate, Mereshko turned at the first wall nearly two whole seconds ahead of the entire field — a lead which only increased in the subsequent lap. 
At the 200m mark, Mereshko had shaken off virtually everyone, and was several body lengths ahead of all of her competitors, save Jiang. The split showed that Jiang had not only been chasing Mereshko’s punishing pace, but had gained on her. Though she lost some ground to Mereshko during the following length, it was Jiang who pushed off the wall first heading into the last lap, 0.2 seconds ahead of the pre-race favorite.
The last lap saw both women fighting for gold, with Mereshko pushing as hard as she could, but Jiang maintaining her slim lead. Mustering up all the strength she had left, Jiang surged ahead even further in the last 25 meters, finishing with a time of 5:13.32, over 4 seconds in front of Mereshko, and setting a new world record. 
Jiang then went on to win the women’s 100m freestyle S6 final (just ahead of Mereshko again) and set a new championship record. She also took bronze in both the 100m backstroke S6 and 50m freestyle, setting a new Asian record in the latter. In her final event, the women’s 50m butterfly, she once again took first place, breaking another world record in the process. 
Life wasn’t always this like this for Jiang. When she was only four years old, she was run over by a truck. The sheer size and weight of the vehicle crushed the bones of the limbs trapped under it, and after being rushed to the hospital, doctors amputated her right leg and arm. Even after the procedure, bone overgrowth in the residual limbs necessitated many more visits to the hospital. Attempting to aid her recovery and future growth, doctors suggested Jiang try swimming. Her mother enrolled her in a swim program during summer break in 2012, and she’s been in the water ever since.
The journey to a world record was not an easy endeavor. In a translated interview with local media First Hand Investigation (later published by The Daily Mail), Jiang’s mother recalls that some of the other kids cried, calling her daughter “half-a-person,” and told her not to return to the pool. Nevertheless, Jiang persevered, saying that “some kids would cry because they choked on water and would not want to keep swimming. I wasn’t like that. I just picked myself up and kept going.” 
In 2015, she became the national champion in the 50m butterfly. Two years later, she placed first in six separate events domestically and won the 100m freestyle at the 2017 Asian Youth Para Games in Dubai. Now, Jiang is not only a world champion three times over, but a holder of two world records as well. “In the water, I don’t need prosthetics, I don’t need a crutch,” she states. “I can rely on my own strength to determine my direction and goal.”

Carnegie Mellon University's men's soccer team scored at opposite ends of the match to cruise to a 2–0 victory over Westminster College on Friday night.
The Tartans scored in the 15th and 77th minutes on goals by juniors Nick Isham and Patrick Kollman, respectively. This put their season marks at two and three goals each, as the Tartans improved to 3–2 overall.
Opportunities came early and often for the Tartans, as they mustered a total of 13 shots on goal compared to Westminster's two. The shots led to a goal shortly into the first half, as the Westminster goalkeeper lost control of a spinning shot that became Isham's second goal of the season. The Tartan offense continued pressing Westminster's defense in the second half and came away with another goal on a low, hard shot into the corner by Kollman assisted by junior Reed Peterson.
On the other side of the field, Westminster struggled to maintain an offense. Despite a charge at the end of the first half, the Tartans blocked shots and had a timely diving save by their keeper, Alex Singh, to maintain a shutout.
"We talked all week about [how] the small things matter," said Carnegie Mellon head coach Brandon Bowman of his team's performance, "They build up to the big things, and I think you saw that tonight."
The men's soccer team is now entering a crucial stretch of games against Allegheny College, local rival Grove City College, and John Carroll University. At just above .500, Bowman hopes his team will build on their play in Friday's win. "We try to focus on how we're playing, and hopefully, the results come with that," he said. 
The Carnegie Mellon men's soccer team plays next at Allegheny College on Monday, Sept. 16.

You’d think that after a summer of cryotherapy, frostbite, helmets, trades, fines, fights, near fights, conspiracies, and arguably the most boring costume on FOX’s The Masked Singer (he was the hippo), Antonio Brown’s summer saga would be over once the former Pittsburgh Steeler finally got what he wanted – a spot on the New England Patriots, current Super Bowl champions. But Tuesday’s New York Times report accusing Brown of sexual assault has highlighted the most damning problems with the National Football League (NFL), especially with regard to the #MeToo movement within sports.
As we learned in the report, Britney Taylor, Brown’s former physical trainer, filed a civil lawsuit in a Florida court accusing the star wide receiver of three separate incidents of sexual assault – two in June 2017 in Florida, and one in May 2018 in Pittsburgh. Claims made in a civil lawsuit are made with no formal police investigation. 
If the claims are true, Brown wouldn’t face charges or jail time. He would have to pay compensation to Taylor for the harm caused. In a statement released on Twitter, Brown’s legal team claims that Taylor approached Brown in 2017 to invest $1.6 million in one of Taylor’s business projects, which apparently was a cover to pay off a $30,000 IRS tax lien and use $300,000 “to purchase property already owned by the accuser and her mother.” The statement also claims that in 2018, Brown and Taylor reportedly engaged in a consensual personal relationship while Taylor was helping to train Brown for the upcoming football season. 
But just as quickly as news of the lawsuit broke out, the NFL has dealt with the case in typical fashion. For now, Antonio Brown will play for the Patriots while the NFL conducts their own investigation, planning to work with Taylor in the case and interview Brown next week, according to the New York Post.
While the NFL was reportedly considering placing Brown on the NFL Commissioner’s Exempt List, their eventual decision to let Brown continue to play is frustrating, disappointing, but not surprising. For what feels like years, the NFL has received nonstop criticism for how it handles its players’ cases of domestic violence and sexual abuse. While the organization has set policies and made efforts to improve this, such as a six-game unpaid ban for domestic violence cases against partners and the NFL Players Association Commission on Violence Prevention, it feels as if the NFL treats cases more as public relations problems against their players and their organizations rather than recognizing their influence on the world at large. 
The NFL Commissioner’s Exempt List doesn’t seem to be a punishment. According to the NFL Player Personnel Policy Manual, “The Exempt List is a special player status available to clubs only in unusual circumstances. The List includes those players who have been declared by the Commissioner to be temporarily exempt from counting within the Active List limit.” 
To interpret this policy from its jargon, Brown would not be able to play games or practice for games, but he would still be able to receive treatment at training facilities and essentially be put on paid leave for the time being. He also would not count towards his team’s standard 53-man roster. Most recent players to be placed on this list include Adrian Peterson and Greg Hardy in 2014, both in separate child abuse and domestic violence cases, and Kareem Hunt in 2018 before his eventual suspension last fall for beating a woman in a hotel.
With regard to cases of personal misconduct such as sexual abuse and domestic violence, it feels as if the NFL acts outside of the standard moral practices of business. Combined with an inept criminal justice system when it comes to prosecuting sexual assault and harassment, especially high profile cases, NFL players and other athletes often escape with little punishment.
This kind of treatment is so contrary to what we’ve seen in the past year and a half with #MeToo’s influence in the entertainment industry. Stars like Kevin Spacey, Max Landis, Charlie Rose, Matt Lauer, and Harvey Weinstein swiftly fell out of the spotlight and into public disgrace. But in the largely male-dominated world of sports, the #MeToo movement is incredibly behind. Just this year, wide receiver Tyreek Hill was investigated for child abuse, yet was still offered a three-year, $54 million contract extension with the Kansas City Chiefs. Hill was also accused of domestic assault in 2014, eventually pleading guilty and serving three years of probation.
Across the sports industry, men are almost exclusively in charge. There are few women in the front offices of teams, and even fewer in the offices of the leagues, which stands in stark contrast to some of the progress made by the world of entertainment. In the entertainment industry, Hollywood is attempting to make a more conscious effort and awareness to give a larger representative voice to women and other diverse perspectives. 
Meanwhile, all four professional sports leagues are led by male commissioners; Roger Goodell, called “the most powerful man in sports” by Business Week, has worked as the NFL commissioner for 12 years. National Hockey League (NHL) commissioner Gary Bettman has held the position since 1993. No matter how many initiatives and committees the NFL or any other sports leagues build to combat personal misconduct and domestic abuse, their poor handling of these issues over the years makes it hard to have faith in these initiatives.
There needs to be a fundamental societal change in the industry for #MeToo to have any chance to possibly break into sports. In an article in New York Magazine, Will Leitch claims that “When the only goal is winning, it’s quite easy to rationalize your morality into ‘second chances’ and ‘redemption stories.’ If he plays for another team, he’s a monster. If he plays for yours, he has ‘overcome off-field adversity.’ If you produce, your crimes will not be forgiven, but pushed under the table. Sports will not change until they are required to.” 
The #MeToo movement has already struggled with the line between these redemption stories, providing these second chances, and tackling some larger, complex issues. For the #MeToo movement to overcome these issues and to break foundation within sports, the culture of sports needs to be upended. But with talented players like Antonio Brown acting seemingly however they want and getting away with anything, what will it take for sports culture to reach this necessity to change?

University of Washington (UW) researchers recently published a study in the American Geophysical Union’s Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres concerning mapping the time and place of so-called superbolts, lightning bolts which contain thousands of times more electrical energy than normal lightning bolts, according to a UW press release. Contained within these superbolts are one million Joules of electrical energy.
Superbolts and every other kind of lightning bolt are most active in a very low frequency range. With that said, previous research has demonstrated that superbolts typically strike the Earth in a completely different manner from normal lightning bolt — but researchers don’t understand why.
"It's very unexpected and unusual where and when the very big strokes occur," remarked Robert Holzworth in the UW press release, the lead author of the study and professor of Earth and Space Sciences at UW. He has been observing and tracking lightning for 20 years and manages the World Wide Lightning Location Network. This research consortium is managed by UW and is in charge of roughly 100 lightning detection stations around the world, from northern Finland to Antarctica. Having so many stations around the world allows scientists to accurately and precisely observe the time when lightning reaches at least three stations and compare the readings from these stations to discover the size and location of a lightning bolt. 
Though the World Wide Lightning Location Network began operation in the early 2000s, this study only looked at 2 billion lightning strokes which were observed between 2010 and 2018. About 8,000 of these strokes (4 millionths of a percent or 1 in 250,000) were confirmed to be superbolts. Holzworth says they only had gathered enough data in recent years to conduct a study. 
The authors of the study looked at their own network’s data as well as that of Earth Networks, a Maryland-based company, and the New Zealand MetService. According to the paper, superbolts most commonly strike in the Mediterranean Sea, tropical oceans, lesser hotspots east of Japan, the Andes, and in the northeast Atlantic Ocean. While regular lightning bolts typically hit land, superbolts typically hit water. 
“Ninety percent of lightning strikes occur over land. But superbolts happen mostly over the water going right up to the coast. In fact, in the northeast Atlantic Ocean you can see Spain and England's coasts nicely outlined in the maps of superbolt distribution,” stated Holzworth. The average stroke energy over water is greater than the average stroke energy over land — such a dramatic difference was very unexpected.
The time of year superbolts strike is also different from that for regular lightning bolts. Regular lightning bolts typically strike over the summer, with “lightning chimneys” that match up with the times summer thunderstorms occur in the Americas, sub-Saharan Africa, and southeast Asia. Superbolts, in contrast, usually occur between November and February. They are also more common in the Northern Hemisphere although they do occur in the south as well. As of yet, more extensive patterns for superbolts are unknown. In some years, more superbolts occur for unexplained reasons. For example, occurrences of superbolts reached a peak in late 2013. There were also many superbolts in late 2014, but there were far fewer superbolts in later years. 
“We think it could be related to sunspots or cosmic rays,” said Holzworth, “but we’re leaving that as stimulation for future research. For now, we are showing that this previously unknown pattern exists.”

Diabetes affects over 30 million Americans, and millions more around the world. These individuals must inject insulin, sometimes as often as four times per day, to treat their condition. Scientists have long searched for a method of delivering insulin orally, and Carnegie Mellon researchers may have found an answer — in strawberries.
Nicholas Lamson, a research assistant who worked on the project, explained in a press release, “The problem with insulin is that it's a protein. The human stomach is very adept at breaking down proteins — such as with food.”
Insulin must be absorbed by the small intestine in order for it to function effectively in a therapeutic setting. Pills are developed to encapsulate insulin molecules so that they are fully intact during absorption. However, if the proteins that protect the insulin are completely undigested by the time they arrive in the small intestine, they are too large to absorbed into the bloodstream. On the other hand, chemicals that force the small intestine’s pores to open often cause lasting damage.
“We took around 110 fruits and vegetables and screened them for an ability to open up the gaps between the cells of the intestine wide enough to allow the insulin to pass through,” said associate professor of chemical engineering Kathryn Whitehead in a press release.
As it turns out, strawberries contain a compound that can enlarge intestinal pores temporarily, without introducing toxic elements or causing permanent side effects. Pelargonidin, the compound in question, also gives strawberries their red color.
The research team worked in the lab to produce a pill that encapsulates insulin using pelargonidin, and proved its efficacy in mice. Although no side effects were discovered, the drug is far from being available for human diabetic patients to use to manage blood sugar.
“A number of challenges must still be addressed, one of the biggest being the necessity of variable dosage,” said Lamson in a press release. “Diabetics must test their blood sugar throughout the day and administer an insulin dose appropriate for their blood sugar levels. This is easy to do with an injection, but much more difficult to do with a pill.”
In the future, the team intends to use pelargonidin from strawberries in other protein therapy medicines, including those used to treat leukemia, osteoporosis and autoimmune disease.

About 90 percent of the human population is right-handed — this has been the case for the last 10,000 years. But what sets lefties apart? A new study published in the journal Brain has identified the specific genes that are related to which hand you prefer. 
We’ve known for a while that genes play a role in determining handedness. Studies of twins have shown that 25 percent of the variation can be explained by genetic makeup. But this is the first study to identify genome-wide significant loci (fixed positions on a chromosome, or where a gene “lives”) for human handedness in the general population. 
Data were collected from the UK Biobank, a repository of biological information from a large group of people. A big part of what allowed them to identify these loci was the size of the study: it included approximately 400,000 people, 38,332 of whom were lefties. Dr. Akira Wiberg, a Medical Research Council fellow at the University of Oxford and the first author on the study, said in an Oxford University press release, “Many researchers have studied the biological basis of handedness, but using large datasets from UK Biobank has allowed us to shed considerably more light on the processes leading to left-handedness."
The researchers identified four loci that were associated with handedness. Three of the four were also associated with encoding proteins involved in brain development and patterning. 
“Many animals show left-right asymmetry in their development, such as snail shells coiling to the left or right, and this is driven by genes for cell scaffolding, what we call the ‘cytoskeleton,’” said Professor Gwenaëlle Douaud in thepress release, associate professor at the University of Oxford and joint senior author on the study.  “For the first time in humans, we have been able to establish that these handedness-associated cytoskeletal differences are actually visible in the brain. We know from other animals, such as snails and frogs, that these effects are caused by very early genetically-guided events, so this raises the tantalizing possibility that the hallmarks of the future development of handedness start appearing in the brain in the womb.” 
The loci associated with left-handedness are also strongly positively correlated with schizophrenia, while they are negatively correlated with Parkinson’s disease. Of course, correlation does not imply causation. Deepening knowledge of these genes could, however, help scientists understand these diseases. 
“Throughout history, left-handedness has been considered unlucky, or even malicious. Indeed, this is reflected in the words for left and right in many languages. For example, in English ‘right’ also means correct or proper; in French ‘gauche’ means both left and clumsy,” said Professor Dominic Furniss, associate professor at the University of Oxford, and also joint senior author on the study, in a press release.  
But being left-handed could have some benefits. One striking result is that there is an increase in functional connectivity between right and left language networks in lefties. Detailed brain imaging of approximately 9,000 participants showed differences in white matter tracts, which contain the cytoskeleton of the brain that joins the language-related regions.
“We discovered that, in left-handed participants, the language areas of the left and right sides of the brain communicate with each other in a more coordinated way. This raises the intriguing possibility for future research that left-handers might have an advantage when it comes to performing verbal tasks,” Dr. Wiberg said, but he warns that these results do not apply neatly to every individual. “It must be remembered that these differences were only seen as averages over very large numbers of people and not all left-handers will be similar.”
The study does not definitively conclude whether increased coordination of language function gives left-handers a cognitive advantage at verbal tasks, the authors leaving this question to future investigations.

Add-ons are a common concept nowadays. From cable packages, to insurance on Amazon purchases, to downloadable content in video games — it seems like everything comes in a basic, stripped down form, with the rest sold as extras. But what about those cases when the “extras” are just as or more valuable than the base they’re added to?
Take a car, for example. If you wanted to add a sound system, media center, or heated seats, your bill could quickly go up by several hundred dollars (depending on the manufacturer and dealer). Of course, these are luxury items, after all, so it makes sense that you’d have to pay a bit more for some added comfort.
But not all add-ons are created equal, and some are less about personal luxuries and more about safety. Car manufacturers are now equipping vehicles with driver-assist warning systems like camera arrays and radar, which enable blind-spot monitoring, collision warning systems, and even automated parallel parking.
So while self-driving vehicles might be just over the horizon, we have the potential to make our existing vehicles safer with the tech we have now. As Corey Harper, a postdoctoral fellow at Carnegie Mellon’s civil and environmental engineering department said, “We don’t have to wait for a future with self-driving cars to realize a lot of the benefits of sensing and automation.”
Harper and his colleagues recently published a study into a few of the driver-assist technologies available. The researchers came to the conclusion that these safety systems, if made standard on all US vehicles, could prevent “1.6 million crashes” per year.  All totaled, the reduction could potentially create a “net benefit of more than $20 billion annually” for an average cost of $600 per car.
With any luck, the publication of their study might bring attention to the benefits of these features, especially for prospective car owners weighing their options. Not only do these safety features “provide distributed benefits… [such as] less congestion, fewer taxpayer-supported emergency responses,” but they also help prevent personal injuries, damages, and deaths. 
Popularizing these added safety features can help reduce the frequency and costs of accidents on both a personal and public level. And with time, they may even become a part of the standard new-vehicle package at no extra cost.

The Lumineers transgress music industry tradition with their newest album, III. Rather than take the typical route, they told a story in three parts, releasing three songs at a time in their EPs, Gloria and II, before finishing the narrative with four new songs, which got
compiled into the complete 10-song album. In addition to this unique and emotional three-chapter album, the Lumineers document the tumultuous generations of the fictional Sparks family through short films that coincide with each song.
In an interview with the Huffington Post, The Lumineers’ percussionist Jeremiah Fraites explained that III “thematically deals with not just addiction and alcoholism, but how you continue to love a person in the wake of the trauma they cause.”
Lumineers bandmates Fraites and Wesley Schultz have first-hand experience with a loved one suffering from addiction, and listening to III, you can instantly tell that they poured their souls into their music.
The first chapter is about Gloria Sparks. The first song, “Donna,” gives off a nostalgic, but melancholy vibe, juxtaposing Gloria Sparks’ current life with her husband and baby to her childhood growing up with her mother Donna.
The second verse of the song is the most potent and sets the tone for the rest of the album: “If you don’t have it, then you’ll never give it / And I don’t blame you for the way you livin’ / The little boy was born in February / You couldn’t sober up to hold a baby.” It establishes how Gloria’s lack of love from her mother growing up influences her own role as a mother, and how her addiction is rooted deeper than just the individual level.
The video opens with Gloria with her husband and baby posing for portraits, but having trouble getting everyone to focus at the same time. Rather than being a humorous moment, however, you can see the exhaustion in the parents’ faces. Next, it zooms into their home, revealing Gloria catching herself from a fall between the piano and the baby’s crib, with the baby watching from the corner innocently. While Gloria climbs into bed, it reveals her tear-soaked face staring at a portrait of her parents on the bedside table, then cuts to flashbacks of her parents, baby Gloria crying, gravestones of her parents, and then fast-forwards to her own baby sitting on the floor confusedly looking into the camera.
In “Life in the City,” the Lumineers give a very brief sense of hope of traveling to a new city, but the “dream, it died” and there is a realization that “living life in the city […] will never be pretty.” The video follows Gloria as she goes to a bar, does a line in the bathroom, then hooks up with someone she meets at the counter, before returning home to her sleeping family and putting her wedding ring back on.
The close of the first chapter, “Gloria,” left me in tears, diving deep into the addiction, with evocative imagery in the lyrics and the film. The song is a plea for Gloria to slow down, pointing out “I smell it on your breath […] booze and peppermint,” and asking, “Gloria, did you finally see that enough is enough?” The tempo also fits with the urgency of the lyrics and the scenes, from her husband coming home to her on the floor, her mouth foaming and her body twitching, the baby in the background crying, to Gloria sneaking drinks behind the house and fighting with her husband.
The second chapter chronicles Junior Sparks’ teenage years as he struggles at home with his father Jimmy and his absent mother Bonnie. “It Wasn’t Easy to Be Happy for You” starts with the heartbreak of a girlfriend leaving him, and “Leader of the Landslide” picks up with him recognizing the toxic nature of his family, with his alcoholic father being the titular “leader of the landslide.”
The video emotionally showcases Junior’s relationship with his father, as he continuously drinks and throws parties, beating Junior and pulling a gun when he rejects his father’s offerings of alcohol. By the end, Junior runs out while the rest of the party disperses or lies on the floor laughing deliriously. Similar to “Gloria,” the tempo and video perfectly match in intensity. Last of the chapter is “Left For Denver,” capturing the pain of Junior’s mother leaving him behind.
The last chapter explores Jimmy Sparks, the father of Junior and son of Gloria. The videos for the last four songs have yet to be released on YouTube, although the complete film appeared at the Toronto International Film Festival on Sept. 8.
These four songs are rather despondent additions to the album, but Schultz’ haunting vocals really make the song stand out from the rest. “Jimmy Sparks” specifically dives into the details of Jimmy’s difficulties in his relationship with Bonnie and trying to save his sick son by making quick money at the casino, and it only spirals from there. “April” is a short instrumental, but the music is no less heart-wrenching than the rest of the Jimmy Sparks chapter. The conclusion to the album, “Salt and the Sea,” was actually the song that started it all, with darker undertones than a lot of their previous music that helped them shape the stories of Gloria, Junior, and Jimmy Sparks.
Although I enjoyed the Lumineers’ previous two albums, I actually did not follow III as it was released chapter by chapter throughout the year and had no idea what to expect. However, the album completely surpassed any expectations I could have possibly had. Although definitely heavier than some of their other work, III is a well-crafted narrative and a candid exploration of addiction that should not be missed.

You can feel the anticipation building as the audience waits anxiously for the start of the show. People have brought in their snacks and drinks and are quietly munching on them while flipping through the programs. They are reading all about the fabulous cast of The Lion King, the performance they will soon experience at the Benedum Center in downtown Pittsburgh.
The lights begin to dim. People silence their cell phones and a voice erupts over the speaker, announcing where the nearest exits are and to enjoy the show. The lights fade to a black out.
"Nants ingonyama bagithi Baba…"
The first line of the show bursts out of the dark as the lights come up revealing a beautiful set of oranges, reds, and yellows. A gigantic ribbed fabric sun rises from the ground and covers the entirety of the backdrop on the stage.
Pride Rock slowly moves its way on stage and stands proudly in the middle. It soon is decorated with many people costumed as animals. The intricate masks and beadwork stand out in each individual costume design, as well as the beautiful makeup design on each performer, created with bright colors on some and neutral on others.
One of the most incredible things to witness are the puppeteers hard at work. The show actually has over 232 puppets used throughout the production. Their puppets have difficult and unique mechanics that take time to master, so watching their intricate movements is particularly intriguing. One of the most beloved characters, Zazu, falls under the puppet category. The actor, being one of the main sources of comic relief in the show, is tasked with the creation of expression through a puppet and body movements, rather than his own expressions, which can pose a challenge. Luckily for the audience, these actors are some of the most talented and expressive.
In total, it took around 37,000 hours to build these masks and puppets to perfection. This is clear from how beautiful the show is when put all together. The show is the third longest running Broadway performance, which is not surprising at all. This spectacular show has been dazzling and warming the hearts of many for years, and will continue for many years to come.

Silence is what I first felt meeting you.
I couldn’t help but notice how your scattered long black hair looked perfect compared to my uncombed
black hair oiling down to my scalp
Just as fast as my entire body rose in shock
As the introvert’s chaotic mind
Went completely
Silent.
With a person with ADHD you rarely have these quiet moments, you see.
I think in weird tangents all across
Images constantly refresh in my head remembering every face and conversation I’ve ever had
But suddenly it was like an infinite loop in my system
Of your smile slightly covered with your straight hair
I love counting
I would “like” hate anyone who said “like” the word “like” too often:
you said it 36 times.
I love painting
The thick paint dripping like a molten river from the brush turning
to blades of grass with dew on them:
you remind me of that.
I love static electricity
I could rip apart wires and build circuits but in the end as I sit writing this poem in the dark:
I hope my goosebumps settle down in the same silence of my mind.
I love counting
While counting the time signature of my favourite song
I’ve opened the door for you one time
I couldn’t help but notice how you walked in sync with the song.
I love painting
And the conglomerated tar requires the endless forces of the brush to ruffle
Backwards and forward
But all I can think of are scattered numbers
Freud calls dreams a wish fulfilment…
Does it mean you’ll only stay in my dreams?
I love static electricity
Like the attraction of particles to be cemented together, bound for life
When Feynman said the neutrino floats and drifts alone in the universe
I felt that feeling that
I didn’t need you
That I was experiencing so much of the universe on my own
Boundless.
I love counting
When I counted how many times I thought my new professors moved a yawn in the people sitting around 
me
I imagined where you were turning my head ever so slightly:
Your eyes were closed,
From my boundaries,
Or perhaps I fell asleep before actually turning around.
I love painting
The textures of your callous wrists as they move over the violin
Like the poetry of the mumbling of your fast tones
My brush would break into a thousand wood splinters before I could touch your curvature
And I’m okay with that.
I love static electricity…
I love counting
I love painting
I don’t ramble anymore
I can remember things now
I can breathe slowly now
I don’t panic lying in my bed thinking of whether I’ll get to talk to someone the next day
I love counting,
In how many ways you changed me
I love painting,
A thank you letter to leave by your door
I love static electricity
That I feel from loving myself today
Silence is dangerous, my parents said to me.
My whole life I’ve been told I’m too shy
I used to tell them “my mind is running free”
But now that I look at you
Peace is all I feel.
Silence
That was long awaited by me.

Sex and the City, an iconic and timeless property, has been through its fair share of screen-time. From its six seasons airing on HBO to its time on the big screen in Sex and the City (2008) and sequel Sex and the City 2 (2010), the charming yet dramatic tales of Carrie Bradshaw are told from her first person narrative writing a sex column. It is no wonder that the Sex and the City adventures have held wide popularity throughout their existence, but for nostalgia’s sake, I’d like to explain just how novel and hitched into relevance its entire legacy truly is. 
Aiming to reach an audience of anyone interested in fantasizing about a promiscuous life in the Big Apple, Bradshaw writes tales of encounters-both sexual and romantic- and weaves in her own hint of comedy to allow levity to relationships commonly given too much gravity in our mundane lives. An example of this would be after the divorce between Charlotte York and her ex-husband Trey MacDougal. While pining over her lost “one big love” she meets her “putz” of a divorce lawyer. Bald, loud, ill-mannered, Harry constantly flaunts his affection toward Charlotte. In no time, Charlotte falls in love with Harry and even converts to Judaism for him. The irony of such a relationship displays just how complex and clever creator Darren Shaw truly made the Sex and the City empire. 
With the proper Charlotte, practical Miranda, promiscuous Samantha, and playful Carrie, Sex and the City encompasses all parts of a woman one might aspire to be. Throughout the show and movies, each woman holds their own experiences good and bad, explicit and heartfelt, allowing the viewer to connect with them on surface and deeper levels. For such reasons, the Sex and the City empire gives each viewer the opportunity to live vicariously through each character. I doubt that this gem of a show (and successive movies) will ever lose potential in society as it holds such a unique balance of comedy and sexuality for anyone to enjoy. As I grow as an individual, I will always cherish Bradshaw’s (and Shaw’s) honesty and unique approach to life as it tells us that love is not dead and one shouldn’t be afraid to have fun while searching for it.

While many have named Jon Chu’s adaptation of Kevin Kwan’s book Crazy Rich Asians the pioneer full-cast Asian-American movie marking a historical change in ethnic representation, Hollywood’s first full-cast Asian-American movie was actually made more than two decades ago. The Joy Luck Club, directed by Amy Tan in 1993, held the position of first Asian-American movie for 25 years. Following the movie’s release, viewers had high hopes for Asian representation in Hollywood. The Joy Luck Club was held as an exception to Hollywood’s typical cast and remained alone in its category until the last two years.
Last year, there was more Asian-American representation in films than ever before, starting in June with Pixar’s 8-minute feature film Bao, which played in theaters before Incredibles 2 and portrayed cultural differences between a Chinese immigrant mother and her first-generation son. In Aug., three movies with Asian-American leads were released: the novel adaptation Crazy Rich Asians starring a full-Asian cast, Netflix original To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before starring Lana Candor, and Searching starring John Cho. As a result, the hashtag “#AsianAugust” began to gain popularity on the internet. This May, Netflix released the original Always Be My Maybe starring Randall Park and Ali Wong, and A24 limited-released The Farewell starring Awkwafina.
Several factors influenced the 25-year gap between the release of The Joy Luck Club and Crazy Rich Asians. Following the release of The Joy Luck Club, director Wayne Wang faced difficulties pitching Asian-American film ideas to studios and casting Asian actors in other movies. Though Wang’s efforts for The Joy Luck Club led to lead actor Ming-Na Wen later landing the lead role in Disney’s animated film Mulan, it was still difficult for Asian-American actors to land roles that were not specifically written as an Asian role.
“I work in an industry that really has no regard for my voice and the voice of people like me and so, what do I do? Keep knocking on that door or build your own house?” Constance Wu tweeted, quoting Ava DuVernay two weeks prior to the release of Crazy Rich Asians, which she starred in. 
During the casting of Crazy Rich Asians, director Jon Chu faced challenges in the proper portrayal of identity: whether or not a Malaysian can play a Singaporean, an Asian an Asian-American, or if a parent has to be of the same ethnic background as the child. In addition, with a limited number of Asian-American actors to pull from, Chu’s casting soon turned international, and he had to be careful of casting actors with different English accents.
While Asian-Americans slowly turned the tide in Hollywood, they were also beginning to become more represented in media last year. In the 2018 Winter Olympics, Chloe Kim became the youngest woman to win the Olympic snowboarding metal, Mirai Nagasu became the first woman to land triple axels in figure skating, and the Shibutani siblings became the first sibling ice dancers to earn a medal in the Olympics.
Starting in Sept. of last year, the popular Facebook group “Subtle Asian Traits”, founded by a group of high-school seniors from the Melbourne area in Australia, went viral. The group references cultural pressures that many immigrant children face, and started with a group of students sharing jokes about their bitter obligation to attend Mandarin classes every weekend while their friends got to sleep in. “Subtle Asian Traits” now holds 1.4 million members and has countless sub-groups such as “Subtle Asian Dating” and “Subtle Curry Traits.”
While it is uncertain that the plethora of Asian-American led films will continue or be added to the slow but ever-growing collection, Wu believes this is just the beginning. “My dear Asian-American friends, we are building our own damn houses. We got the tools, the ability and we definitely got the style. Just because others don’t see it, doesn’t mean we don’t have it. We do. I’ve seen it,” tweeted Wu in 2018.

After 13 years, Tool came back with a monster of an album, Fear Inoculum. With ten songs clocking in at a length of an hour and 26 minutes, it’s certainly their longest album. It dethroned Taylor Swift from the charts once it came out, quite possibly the most glorious feeling I’ve felt in the past few weeks. A mainstream album by a famous metal band that is actually topping the charts is a rare occasion, but it shows how big the following for the genre is and how dedicated the fans are. 
I was thrilled for the album. Tool has inspired a lot of my songwriting. Lateralus is one of my personal favorite albums, and I was hoping the album would be something along those lines. But on my first listen, I ended up feeling a thing I thought I wouldn’t feel. 
Disappointed. 
Each song on Lateralus had riffs and moments that would hit you and stick with you for the rest of the day. You hear the initial bass line of songs like “Schism” and it’s immediately memorable. I didn’t feel that same way about Fear Inoculum. Despite having songs that would be upwards of 16 minutes, I felt like I couldn’t pick out many memorable moments throughout the album. In fact, many of the songs could have been cut down by three to five minutes, and it wouldn’t have made a difference. “7empest”, “Descending”, and “Invincible” have a few of the memorable riffs, but overall, the first experience just felt fine. 
What was that, Tool? You make an album after 13 years, and that’s what you give us? Of course, my expectation of what I wanted was subverted, and I wasn’t the only Tool fan who felt this way. Quite a large section of the fanbase felt a little bit of disappointment. The album wasn’t exactly what we wanted. But despite that, something drew me to the album regardless. The composition was all solid, and there was a lot to like in it regardless of how disappointed I felt on the initial listen. Tool does take some time to sit down and click with, which is a quintessential facet of progressive rock and metal. So I did that. I sat down for a second listen, this time taking away my expectations, and mentally preparing myself for the journey. I felt a different feeling this time. 
Satisfaction. 
Okay, Tool. I get what you’re going for. The point of it wasn’t to retread the past. There are moments that recall the past and made me ecstatic, but the sound is different. Tool has evolved, and they aren’t afraid to keep pushing the boundaries of what they can make. The songs feel less long this time around, and things seem to flow more clearly. It hasn’t fully clicked yet, and I don’t know whether the next listen will make me love it more or love it less. So I decided to give it one more go, and my feelings changed again. 
Elation. 
It took three listens, but I eventually loved the new Tool album. It’s a lot to take in at once. The album is so dense and has a lot to unpack. For a mainstream album, it is comparatively inaccessible compared to their previous works and other mainstream metal and rock albums. The choices were truly daring. Each part of the composition, from the little transitions to the larger scale instrumental jams, felt like it had a purpose and deliberate weight to it all, even if it felt overly long at times. 
The concept of the album is also interesting. A big theme in Tool’s music is maturity, both in the lyrics and in the composition. While the music on this album is lengthy, it never feels particularly self-indulgent. The odd time signatures and polymeters all serve a purpose to the overall concept and theme of the story. The band is growing and maturing over the years, and this album is more proof of that. Even if there isn’t something that sticks out the same way riffs do on Lateralus, listening to this album feels like an experience. There isn’t a single song you can listen to without being in the mindset to sit down and truly listen to the music. It demands attention and demands you to listen to it rather than rock to it, although there are certainly many moments throughout this album where you can do both. 
Tool’s return feels like an old friend coming back. Granted, I am not old enough to really grow up with Tool, but they were a defining experience in high school and were my gateway into progressive metal. Fear Inoculum is a massive piece of music, and it’s a lot more rare to see something like that become super popular now. I will be listening to this album several more times, searching for new meaning in it, and paying attention to the musicality and picking up on new things. 
Welcome back, Tool. 
Standout tracks:
“7empest”
“Descending”
“Invincible”

It feels wrong to walk through the floors of the Miller Institute for Contemporary Art's exhibition "An Atlas of Commoning: Spaces of Collective Production" while the exhibit is deserted. The pieces featured not only depict different aspects of the modern communal experience, but beg to be experienced as a group. I was too nervous to take off my shoes and stand on the large rug by myself, unable to read all of the pamphlets dissecting different communal projects alone, and felt weird sitting next to empty seats to watch the videos. Perhaps the experience of going alone heightened my awareness of the ways in which shared experiences can shape experiences. So, whether by yourself or in a group, be sure to stop by the Miller Institute for Contemporary Art before "An Atlas of Commoning", produced in collaboration with ica and ARCH+, closes on Sept. 23.

Dr. Kiron Skinner is back on campus as Director of Carnegie Mellon’s Center for International Relations and Politics after she was fired from her position as Director of Policy Planning at the Department of State.
Politico reported that her firing came as a result of an “abusive” management style, but in an interview with The Tartan this week, Skinner denies these allegations.
Skinner had taken a leave from her post at Carnegie Mellon last September to pursue what she called her “first real deep dive into government.” She’s worked as a foreign policy advisor to the George Bush, Newt Gingrich, and Mitt Romney presidential campaigns, and served as part of Donald Trump’s transition team in 2016, but this was her “first real day job” in government, she said in an interview with The Tartan.
The allegations made by anonymous state department sources in Politco include Skinner making homophobic remarks, accusing staff of having affairs, and abusing her authority. Several members of Skinner’s staff had allegedly threatened to quit if she was not fired, according to a senior State Department official.
At the time of her firing, Skinner did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Now, she denies making any homophobic remarks, and characterizes some of the reporting as being “out of context.” “I was trying to build a very different type of office,” Skinner said. “There were people that didn’t like how I was doing things.”
Throughout her career, Skinner says, she’s never been accused of any impropriety. She also notes that no official State Department investigation was made prior to her firing. “You can’t be at an elite university and be a big homophobe,” she said.
Several people came to Skinner’s defense over these reports, including Carnegie Mellon professor and Director of the Undergraduate Economics Program Dr. Carol Goldburg, who told Breitbart News that after working with Skinner for over 10 years, she had “never observed language or behavior that could be considered discriminatory.” Goldburg continued, “As one of the few out lesbians on our campus, I am not tone-deaf to even subtle forms of discrimination such as micro-aggressions, and can categorically state that Kiron Skinner does not engage in such behaviors.”
Skinner says that most of the internal conflict stemmed from her big plans for the Office of Policy Planning. She says she entered an office that had little power, and was “building [it] up from the ground, and also bringing a whole different perspective,” while trying to “build relationships around me,” and “doing it not fully staffed.”
As Director of Policy Planning, Skinner under Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Skinner was reportedly working to advance Donald Trump’s “America First” foreign policy agenda and to diversify the State Department, with more hires that spoke the language of regions of interest and hires from academia. To this, Skinner says, “I did rub some people the wrong way, but I came from a whole different world.”
Despite her firing from the Trump administration, Skinner holds steadfast to what she calls the “Trump Doctrine” for foreign policy. She characterizes it as “an attempt to match American capabilities to new geopolitical realities.” “When [Trump] calls it America First, he means putting national interest at the center,” Skinner said.
The politics of the Trump presidency address “the anxiety of where we’re going and what we will be,” Skinner said. In the geopolitical sphere, “we just have more to worry about now, which means diplomacy matters more now.”
Skinner stresses that China continues to grow as an adversary to the United States, and mentions that “when you look at China and all those who have nuclear weapons, they’re from the global south.” Because of this, “we need diverse teams of people who are addressing these things,” Skinner said.
Skinner’s comments on China’s expanding power have led to pushback. At a public talk in Washington this May, Skinner said, “this is a fight with a really different civilization and a different ideology, and the United States hasn’t had that before. The Soviet Union and that competition, in a way, it was a fight within the Western family.” With China, in contrast, “it’s the first time that we will have a great power competitor that is not Caucasian.”
This statement led to criticism. A Foreign Ministry spokesperson for China called it “simply absurd and utterly unacceptable.” An op-ed in The Tartan written by a Chinese doctoral student stated, “I am offended by her claim that since China is not a country of Caucasians, it should be treated differently from other ‘white’ countries by the U.S.”
To this, Skinner says: “Did I misspeak? Sure.” The criticism “was really legitimate… it’s a legitimate discussion,” Skinner said. Still, she clarifies that “China is very different than other competitors we have had” and that “we have to take China on its own terms. A lot more seriously.”
Away from the politics of Washington, D.C., Skinner looks forward to leading the Center for International Relations and Politics into the future. She stresses the importance of facilitating the range of classes necessary to give students a “broad understanding of American politics and the international sphere.” 
Skinner also looks forward to “growing within the new undergraduate major in Economics and Politics,” a Bachelors of Science degree co-sponsored with the Tepper School of Business coming this fall. It will be the first co-sponsored major within the Institute for Politics and Strategy.
The responsibility to present different ideas to undergraduates cannot be understated, Skinner says. After all, the department is “trying to create the next President of the United States and the next set of cabinet members.”

As students walk around campus this fall, they’ll see a new buildup of traffic outside the front entrance of the Purnell Center for the Arts. This is The Exchange Pop-Up Café, which has found a temporary home under the Purnell portico while The Exchange’s original location in Posner Hall undergoes renovations.
One of the most popular dining options on campus, The Exchange will reopen in the renovated space on Nov. 4 with a new design emphasizing speed of service and expanded seating. It will feature an open kitchen, coffee bar, and more grab-and-go menu options. At the start of the semester, the pop-up was operated in a tent at the front of Merson Courtyard outside the Cohon Center. The current location outside Purnell provides better cover, and will remain open until Oct., weather permitting.
Turnout has been good through the first three weeks of the semester. Dave Collins, who manned the register at The Exchange in Posner, also does so at the pop-up, making him a familiar face for regular customers over the years.
“Students from the School of Drama love that we’re so close now,” Collins said in an interview with The Tartan. “People come from all over campus because we have a good reputation. We’re popular with all the sports teams, soccer players. [It’s a] diverse group that comes here.”
While some returning students make their way across campus to grab their sandwich order at pop-up, first-years have no experience with the original café. First-year drama student Bahaar Esfahani appreciates its close proximity to her classes in Purnell, but does not think she will make the trek to Posner when the pop-up closes and the original location reopens.
“I literally have no idea where it used to be,” said Esfahani. “I walk out of Purnell, and [the pop-up is] right here. The location’s really convenient because I walk out of class, I’m hungry, and it’s right here.”
This is also the case for Wael Al Saeed, a masters student in computer science who spends most of his time on campus in the Gates Center. “I only discovered it this week,” he said.
While the new location has brought new customers, who wouldn’t otherwise get their lunches from The Exchange, the small nature of the pop-up means that there are some limitations to their menu. Despite this, they’re continuing to offer a wide variety of options, including breakfast, deli, and off-the-grill sandwiches, hot entrée and pasta specials, as well as hot coffee.
“There are [limitations] because we don’t have the storage,” said Collins. “We don’t have the refrigeration here to offer our full menu, but try to offer what we know is popular.”
The Exchange Pop-Up Café currently operates on weekdays from 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m.

Soon, Carnegie Mellon’s Manufacturing Futures Initiative (MFI) and Carnegie Mellon partner Advanced Robotics for Manufacturing (ARM) will occupy a new facility, Mill 19, alongside other manufacturers. The facility will be a place for MFI and ARM to collaborate, as well as many other purposes.
Mill 19, owned by the Regional Industrial Development Corporation (RIDC), is situated in Hazelwood Green, a 178-acre site once home to Pittsburgh’s leading steel mills. Now, much of Mill 19 will be leased to Carnegie Mellon, and a prospective 8.3-acre expansion in Hazelwood Green is in Carnegie Mellon’s hands. Both MFI and ARM will be situated on the first and second floor of the building, occupying nearly 60,000 square feet.
Carnegie Mellon has had its sights on the area since before Mill 19 was built, signing MFI and ARM on as anchor tenants before the first building had even been constructed. In total, Mill 19 will be comprised of three buildings, forming a 264,000 square foot complex.
Particularly unique to Mill 19’s architecture is that the steel frame of its former steel mill will be maintained. The new construction of Mill 19 is done entirely within the steel frame, something Carnegie Mellon says symbolizes the industrial past and future of Pittsburgh.
As for Carnegie Mellon and its partners’ initiatives, the facility will be a place to prototype and advance new technologies for manufacturing. Previously, work of this sort was being done by ARM at Carnegie Mellon’s Lawrenceville-based National Robotics Engineering Center (NREC).
The creation of ARM happens to have been catalyzed by Carnegie Mellon itself. According to Jay Douglass, Chief Operating Officer for ARM, it was Carnegie Mellon that authored the proposal which resulted in ARM’s creation by the United States’ Department of Defense. To date, ARM has funded over 40 projects, three of which have been in collaboration with Carnegie Mellon.
Douglass stated, “Our mission is to fund development projects that can be shared with our members to move U.S. manufacturing competitiveness forward.” He made sure to note that “CMU is one of the top robotics research institutions in the world. As such, it makes great sense for us to be partnered.”
On future plans for Mill 19, Douglass said, “We are going to be conducting our own research and development in robotics for manufacturing and installing test cells for a variety of robotics applications. We all plan to provide a de-risking capability for some of our local members as well as the [Department of Defense]. Our roommate here at Mill 19 is the CMU Manufacturing Futures Initiative, and we have several projects planned to collaborate on with them.”
With Carnegie Mellon, ARM will be working on a set of training curriculum for robotic technicians and a metal grinding application for tight spaces, Douglass told The Tartan. On a broader scale, ARM has helped Carnegie Mellon and the city of Pittsburgh become leaders in manufacturing innovation, focused on technologies like AI, autonomy, 3D printing, and robotics.
MFI director Gary Fedder told The Tartan that the MFI will be running major advanced manufacturing projects driven by industry needs, requiring industry collaboration. Partner companies at Mill 19 will be donating or consigning equipment as well as sponsoring projects.
“Many of these projects will take the form of ‘workcells’ where some problem in robotics or automation of manufacturing is being explored and ‘de-risked’ for eventual industry use,” said Fedder. “CMU envisions that these workcells not only will serve the needs of the immediate project, but also serve as a testbed resource for secondary spin-off projects — for example in ‘digital twinning’ technology, in human-robot interaction, in energy use, in cybersecurity, or in workforce development.”
While MFI partner ARM has made good use of the NREC, Fedder explained the uniqueness of Mill 19: “An important distinction between Mill 19 and NREC is the intent that Mill 19 is a more open facility that is seen as an extension of campus. We envision substantial numbers of undergraduate and graduate students doing research at Mill 19. Historically, while NREC has run a host of exciting projects, much of its focus has been on the development of autonomous platforms for all sorts of sectors: e.g., military, autonomous vehicles, mining, construction, and farming.”
On the partnership between MFI and ARM, Fedder said, “Our two organizations are complementary and synergistic. CMU researchers primarily work to discover, invent and innovate to explore new ideas and areas. ARM’s mission is to bridge the gap between ideas and inventions to de-risk technology for manufacturers. So the combination of ARM and CMU at Mill 19 is quite powerful.”

The world is on fire, and the people with power are holding the gas can and the match.
This is hardly a metaphor. The people most responsible for the climate catastrophe, which has stopped knocking at our door and is now beating it down, are fossil fuel executives and those helping them in their mission to choke the entire world in ever-darker clouds of smoke. That category also includes every politician who refuses to speak out against these obscenely rich figures, every powerful person taking their money to build boxy glass edifices on hillsides in western Pennsylvania cities, and the consultants and marketing specialists selling “clean” coal, or “natural” gas, or “energy independence,” while more than one million species face extinction. Climate change is forcing millions to flee their homes, and all of us are living in a hotter, more unpredictable planet.
Climate change is already reshaping the dynamics of our world, and it’s naïve to think that anything short of revolutionary political change will alter its destruction. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded in their 2018 report that “the report finds that limiting global warming to 1.5°C would require ‘rapid and far-reaching’ transitions in land, energy, industry, buildings, transport, and cities,” according to a summary released by the IPCC. The report also warns that “a number of climate change impacts…could be avoided by limiting global warming to 1.5°C compared to 2°C, or more. For instance, by 2100, global sea level rise would be 10 cm lower with global warming of 1.5°C compared with 2°C. The likelihood of an Arctic Ocean free of sea ice in summer would be once per century with global warming of 1.5°C, compared with at least once per decade with 2°C. Coral reefs would decline by 70-90 percent with global warming of 1.5°C, where virtually all (> 99 percent) would be lost with 2°C.” Such “rapid and far-reaching” transitions will not be accomplished by policies like not using plastic straws. They won’t be accomplished by a carbon tax, or by “market-based solutions,” or by asking companies worth billions of dollars to please, maybe, pump less oil out of the planet.  
Universities in general, including Carnegie Mellon University, are playing both sides. Provost Jim Garrett sent an email on Sept. 9 “announcing the creation of a new campus-wide Sustainability Initiative,” which would “be organized around objectives that strengthen our university’s commitment to sustainability; elevate Carnegie Mellon’s engagement with the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a shared blueprint for sustainability adopted by countries, cities and universities such as ours; and improve coordination of our sustainability education, research, and practices among CMU students, faculty, staff and local community members.” Meanwhile, the university takes money from the descendants of oil tycoons like Wilton E. Scott, whose “chief love in the energy business was exploration: the adventure of finding and developing new sources of oil and gas,” according to his obituary. The Wilton E. Scott Institute for Energy Innovation “seeks to optimize energy resources, reduce the environmental impacts of energy production and use, and develop breakthrough technologies and solutions that will have a meaningful global impact and to accelerate the transition to a sustainable, low carbon energy future.” Meanwhile, the Institute boasts a Fossil Fuel Experts page, and the university has not divested its $2.36 billion dollar endowment from fossil fuels. 
Institutions have bigger impacts than individuals. Therefore, institutional changes have bigger effects than individual changes. That being said, individual change is still change, and you really should stop using so much plastic (the tap water is literally fine; invest in a filter if it brings you comfort), driving everywhere, taking international flights, and eating meat. All well and good, and every little bit helps. But no matter how much you deprive yourself, no matter how many plastic straws you don’t use, the United States military this year alone will release more greenhouse gases than the entire country of Portugal.
We will not mitigate climate change solely with our reusable packaging and Meatless Mondays. It will take massive public action, and a radical reimagining of our society, to force these institutions to act. What will a world look like without cars spewing pollutants into the air, coal-fired power plants and mountaintop removal, leaky pipelines and toxic water, a few nihilistic frackers who are holding our lives in their hands? We could have fixed this decades ago, but Exxon and their close corporate friends are willing to kill the world for profit. 
It’s never too late to do something. But instead of buying a new set of eco-friendly storage containers, why don’t you donate to one of the groups combating deforestation in the Amazon? Or work in your community, building connections with the people around you, working for a broader goal than just temporarily alleviating your guilt at a lifestyle of consumption and waste? Buying something won’t fix anything. Organizing will. The Fridays for Future movement, which started when then-15-year-old Greta Thunberg sat outside the Swedish parliament building “every schoolday for three weeks, to protest against the lack of action on the climate crisis,” has grown to an international movement, with chapters in 29 countries. Extinction Rebellion has held actions around the world, from die-ins to blocking bridges. These organizations are just a few of the partners in the Global Climate Strike, which will be held on Sept. 20 and 27. Fridays for Future PGH will be hosting an action at the City-County Building, 414 Grant St, Pittsburgh, PA 15219 at 12:00 p.m. on Sept. 20. It will take all of us to make the world better, so let's start now.

A couple of months ago, I wrote an article on the Indian midterm elections that had just taken place. The results were stunning. The Indian National Congress Party (Congress) had defeated the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the Hindi heartland, equivalent to the U.S.'s rust belt, leading political analysts to speculate that the tide has turned in Congress’ favor.
They had reason to believe so: a massive defeat in an election just six months before the general elections, the slowing economy, growing unemployment, disillusionment due to unfulfilled poll-time promises, and growing momentum among the opposition parties had all culminated in the form of that upset for the BJP. The article that I wrote back in January took a  neutral view on the issue of whether Modi will win a second term, conceding that it may not be the landslide victory that people thought it would be in 2014, but that he had a fair shot at winning it, considering the fact that he and his right-hand-man, Amit Shah, combined are an election machine. 
General elections in India are the largest democratic exercise in the world. As they approached, the tide had turned back in the BJP’s favor, and most polls predicted a BJP win. They were all right. Modi did win — and with a landslide margin at that, beating even my expectations that the opposition might just put up a spirited fight at the very least. BJP increased its Lok Sabha (the Lower Chamber) tally from 282 to a whopping 303 seats. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by the BJP stands at 353 of the 543 elected seats.
For a party that had lost elections in three of its homebase states only 6 months ago, this was a spectacular win. Many of the issues that caused the BJP’s defeat in December 2018 still existed in April and May 2019, and yet they won. Some key events played a major role in ensuring the success of BJP: issues of national security, caste dynamics, and fractured opposition, to list a few. The election also debunked several expectations of what would take place, namely that a large number of religious minorities would vote in BJP’s favor this time as well. This baffled several analysts who had speculated that persecution of religious minorities by right-wing fringe groups, and disappointing policies related to women would translate into votes for the Opposition. The BJP’s carefully-built coalitions in different states with local parties, the intricate caste and religious calculations before fielding candidates in constituencies all paid off in their favor, as the Opposition was left unprepared and in disarray.
BJP’s second win has proved that Indians, though disgruntled over our apathetic economy, are willing to ignore it for the sake of national security. The terror attacks in the Jammu and Kashmir states which killed Indian army soldiers and the retaliatory airstrikes in Pakistan conducted by India in February led to increased support for the BJP in the run-up to the elections. Social media sites saw renewed activity as people from both countries faced off in the virtual world, trading insults, even as military and diplomatic tensions rode up. The way the situation de-escalated later solidified the party’s support base and moderates who were concerned about the economic issues plaguing the country put those on the back burner in the interest of national security.
Modi is a charismatic leader who knows how to build his brand as a strong-man, with even his staunchest opponents agreeing on that. He also has the backing of one of the world’s largest grassroots-level organizations in Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu right-wing ideological organization. BJP is the political arm of the RSS, and Modi himself is an RSS alum. Having a dedicated grassroots level organization at the national level that deploys its dedicated volunteers for campaign work at a local level, visiting the homes of people in different constituencies, personally listening to their grievances, is a massive advantage, one that none of the other parties currently enjoy. 
Perhaps the Congress Party had that advantage a couple of decades ago, but the party is now aging, most of its leaders hovering around 65. This is especially old considering  India has the largest youth population in the world right now. The Congress party is a slow, aging party that refuses to play catch up with new methods of electioneering, like social media or data analytics. It’s another advantage that the BJP enjoys, thanks to RSS's large youth base. 
Caste dynamics came into play as well, as I had predicted in my January article. Without getting into the nitty-gritty of the complicated caste system in India, the introduction of 10 percent reservations to upper-caste people (basically increasing affirmative action for upper-caste people) swayed a significant number of upper-caste votes to BJP. 
The election results surprised me not so much by the end result as by its overwhelming mandate for the BJP. Of course, I continue to have concerns with many of the government’s policies. As a recession nears, that concern only grows. But I choose to give them the benefit of the doubt. 
I continue to be peeved by Atishi Marlena’s loss in the East Delhi constituency to BJP’s Gautam Gambhir. Atishi has been credited with Delhi’s education policy reforms and worked for an honorarium amount of 1 Rupee (0.014 USD). Yet she lost to Gambhir, a former cricketer. In that moment, and even now, it feels to me like the loss of meritocracy. 
But I'm still optimistic about the future of democracy in India, and as a new generation comes of age, hopefully, we will start taking over the reins and lead the country to a better future.

Last time on Accounting for Your Life, we talked about the importance of saving, and some general guidelines on how to save. Even though we painted in very broad strokes, I hope that those principles at least gave you some food for thought and helped you start to think about how to reshape your views on spending and saving.
But all this talk about saving raises another big question: after your money makes it through the grueling gauntlet of taxes, bills, and unexpected expenses into your “savings” category, where should you put it? Should you keep it in the bank? Should you invest it all in gold? Should you fill a vault with it and go swimming like Scrooge McDuck?
More important than simply having a lot of cash saved up is ensuring that that money grows over time. Choosing where you put your money can have a big impact on your financial wellness down the line, so making the right choices now can help your wealth compound and grow significantly over time.
Before we talk about the options that exist, it’s worthwhile to consider why we want our money to grow over time instead of just sitting in a dark vault. Is it because we like seeing larger and larger numbers in our bank account? Sure, everyone loves seeing bigger numbers. However, the far more pressing concern is that you want to make sure that the money you saved maintains its buying power.
We often hear it said that 25 years ago, $20 could buy a lot more than $20 today. Considering that the U.S. economy has a habit of heading in an expansionary direction, it’ll probably buy even less 25 years from now. This is because economies that are doing well tend to experience inflation, which means that prices for goods and services tend to go up. Runaway inflation is a bad sign, but a modest rate of inflation is unavoidable. That's why the Federal Reserve tries to manage the inflation rate to be around two percent a year.
If you just save your money and put it somewhere safe, it's actually becoming less valuable as time goes on. Sure, that $100 in your savings account is still going to be $100 in the year 2040, but it’s not going to go as far as it would have in the year 2019. For that reason, it’s important to grow savings rather than just have savings. So what are your options for where to stash your stacks?
For those of you closer to broaching full-on adulthood and on the verge of entering the workforce, a 401k and an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) should be your first considerations for storing savings. Setting aside a portion of your paycheck to directly deposit into your 401k or IRA is a great way to ensure that the money you set aside grows over time. Some employers match your contributions to your 401k, which just means more money for you, and in the case of IRAs, you can often write off your contributions as a tax deduction.
However, do keep in mind that these accounts are not like traditional savings accounts: for a 401k, you cannot make direct contributions and there are steep penalties for early withdrawals before the age of 59 and a half, the official age for retirement as set by the IRS. And for an IRA, though you can make direct contributions and have as many accounts as you want, you cannot exceed the federal limit of $6,000 a year as of 2019. We will talk more about these retirement accounts later in the series.
For those of you who are still in college or the awkward transition between student and adult, a good place to store savings would be an online bank account, which often boasts higher interest rates than traditional brick-and-mortar banks. In most cases, banks may offer a pitiful interest rate on their savings accounts, often less than one percent compounded monthly.
By contrast, there are a lot of banks that offer savings accounts with a two percent or higher interest rate, compounded daily. I’m no mathematician, but it’s clear that the second option is better.
How is it that these online banks can afford such high interest rates? Part of the reason is that they don’t have as much overhead as established banks such as PNC, Wells Fargo, or Bank of America do. Most of their business is done virtually, so there’s no need for expensive office buildings and large management teams across the U.S. In some ways, you can see the rise of online banks as a natural consequence of the internet.
Transferring your money to an online bank is straightforward enough in that you just open an account and transfer from an existing account. Choosing the right bank is up to you, though keep in mind that most online banks do not offer checking services comparable to those of established branches, so accessing your money from an ATM or using a bank-issued debit card might be out of the question. In that sense, online bank accounts are best viewed as a receptacle for money where liquidity is not a concern, and you should still have a regular checking account for day-to-day expenses.
A third option is a certificate of deposits (CDs) and timed savings accounts. These offer even higher rates, sometimes as high as three percent, but the catch is that you cannot access your money at all for a period. Essentially, you’re giving the bank your money with the promise that they can use it and lend it however they want, and in return, they’ll pay you back the principal plus interest. If you’re sure that you don’t need the money for a while, then timed savings and CDs can yield even higher returns.
Now that you’ve saved some money and have a place to put it where it can grow, you’re probably feeling pretty good about the future. But if you consider the big picture, we can do better. With a two-to-three percent interest rate, an online savings account might help you keep pace with inflation, but you’ll never outperform it by a decent margin. So rather than just saving and stashing, we’ll begin tackling our biggest and most important topic starting with the next issue: how to invest.

During the last few weeks of Aug., you may have seen your Instagram story feed transform before your eyes. Your friends’ Instagram stories, normally containing memes and pictures of people’s dinners, suddenly featured memes, pictures of people’s dinners, and panic over the Amazon rainforest. The Amazon rainforest is burning. If you checked the news, browsed social media, or talked to anyone during the month of August, chances are you’re painfully aware of this fact.
Cyberactivism has been a good start to help increase awareness of this environmental catastrophe. In order for it to be effective, however, it must be followed by concrete action. Overall, cyberactivism has failed to inspire mass action, as it has skimmed over the likely cause of the fires: animal agriculture.
NASA’s Earth Observatory has analyzed the timing, location, and intensity of the fires, and found that these patterns indicate deliberate land clearing. In other words, humans have been intentionally starting fires to clear up space for industry. Though Amazonian deforestation is a multifaceted issue, about 80 percent of current deforestation in Amazon countries is carried out to increase beef production, according to Yale University's Global Forest Atlas. 
Animal agriculture is the leading cause of deforestation in the Amazon, and as such, is the probable cause of many of the 2019 fires. This presents an inconvenient truth for many Americans. Some of America’s largest corporations, such as Costco, McDonald’s, and Walmart, sell Amazonian beef to the public. Therefore, veganism, or reduced beef consumption at the very least, is a fitting solution to this environmental crisis. Less demand for beef (and its byproducts) would decrease the demand for Amazonian land, and reduce the need for deforestation.
Much anti-vegan rhetoric focuses on the impact of soy production on the Amazon. Soybean production is a major threat to the Amazon rainforest but is secondary to livestock production. Further, 80 percent of soybeans produced worldwide is consumed by livestock. The environmental burden proposed by soybeans should not be discounted, but rather it should be looked at as a result of livestock production.
As the fires in the Amazon rage on, cyberactivism is beginning to die down. In order to fight deforestation and prevent further fires, the demand for Amazonian land must be reduced. We must do so by reducing the demand for Amazonian-raised beef and other cattle products.

Last Thursday, Saturday Night Live announced its three newest cast members. Within hours, videos were uncovered revealing that one of them, Shane Gillis, used racial slurs while appearing on a podcast, insisted on including bigoted comments in his standup routine, and called a Democratic presidential candidate a “Jew c***k”.
While the comedian may lose his opportunity to appear on SNL, this has already become yet another occasion for people to express outrage against the outrage: a condemnation of “cancel culture” destroying people’s lives. But even if Gillis is removed from SNL’s lineup, I argue that it would be an exception that demonstrates the overall lack of a predominant cancel culture.
For someone to be canceled, it means that their livelihood is lost or permanently damaged due to a public backlash against something they did or said that was perceived as objectionable. If people are going to assert that a Twitter army of “politically correct” “social justice warriors” is destroying lives with their purity tests and barrages of hate, then we must have some evidence of it destroying lives, right? For a cancel culture to exist in any substantive way, people must be getting canceled.
Whenever I ask for examples, people mention Aziz Ansari (you can watch his July standup special on Netflix), Kevin Hart (according to IMDb he is acting in at least four upcoming productions), or James Gunn (he has now written the script for The Suicide Squad and has been rehired to Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3). None of their stories are examples of cancel culture at work.
While figures such as Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby have ended their careers from their criminal acts, the public response to their behavior was substantively different from what people imagine politically correct “cancel culture” to be. The only clear-cut example I’ve seen of a successful “canceling” was of Rosanne Barr being fired from her show following her racist tweets targeting a former Obama aide, but even so, she may find a new audience in time. 
For every actor, musician, and personality who faced incidents where it appeared that they were being "canceled," practically all of them either stayed intact or recovered one way or another. Beauty personality James Charles has regained most of the subscribers he lost since he was supposedly canceled. Viner turned YouTube personality Logan Paul suffered a massive backlash at the beginning of 2018 over his “suicide forest” video, but since then has almost reached 20 million YouTube subscribers and got away with “going gay” for a month earlier this year.
Rapper XXXTentacion had his songs returned to Spotify’s playlists while he was being prosecuting for domestic violence. Even gaming YouTuber ProJared could make a comeback after controversies surrounding soliciting nude photographs from minors and an alleged affair. And none of this is mentioning the numerous public figures who haven’t suffered any tangible damage after being “canceled.”
It seems that a lot of the discussion around cancel culture is more “looks like so-and-so is getting canceled” than anyone actually being canceled. PewDiePie? Canceled. Kanye West? Canceled. Taylor Swift? Canceled. Half of the SNL cast members? Canceled. Kanye West? Canceled again. Woody Allen? Canceled. Every actor who’s played a character of a different ethnicity? All supposedly canceled. It’s as though the source of cancel culture’s perceived power is people repeatedly asserting how powerful and pervasive it is.
A counterpoint to this is that the outrage people on social media display while targeting someone shows the power of cancel culture when that target is bullied off the platform, but that’s not what cancel culture is; that’s cyberbullying. Cyberbullying can, but not necessarily, be a component of cancellation. It is only a sufficient component of canceling someone if the target’s livelihood is actually threatened by leaving the platform. I wouldn’t call The New York Times opinion columnist Bret Stephens canceled after he was bullied off of Twitter for taking offense to being called a bedbug.
But what other explanation is there for all the attention paid to cancel culture, and the attacks on various public figures? I will refer people to what Bloomberg Opinion columnist Noah Smith dubbed “the Shouting Class." This is generally a small subset of people on social media who spend their time on social being vocally outraged about something or someone. They might be part of the 10 percent of Twitter users who send 80 percent of all tweets, or the people who mobilize the cancel hashtags.
Regardless, this is an incredibly small group of people — and unless you want to “cancel” the Shouting Class, they won’t be going away without systematic changes to how social media functions, with its mechanisms for elevating certain types of voices over others. What we can do now, however, is remind ourselves that the people trying to use years-old tweets to get someone fired don’t represent any society at large, and we must resist giving them the oxygen that social media platforms tend to want us to give them.
However, it’s also important to acknowledge that when the discourse around who the Shouting Class is going after enters the general public, that person is likely receiving the scrutiny and accountability that is warranted; at that point it’s out of the Shouting Class’s control. Whatever happens to Shane Gillis’s future at SNL is up to the show's powerful producer Lorne Michaels now.
As I finish this, it appears that there’s new reporting on a corroborated sexual misconduct allegation against Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his time at Yale. I wonder if the almighty cancel culture will actually get him this time.
