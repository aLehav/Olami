Junior Thomas Vandenberg represented Carnegie Mellon University at the 2014 NCAA Indoor Division III Track and Field Championships this weekend, placing fourth in the 800-meter run. “After just missing nationals for the past couple of years, making it this year was my number one goal,” Vandenberg wrote via email.
Vandenberg was the only Tartan to qualify for the trip to Nebraska to face off against the best track and field athletes in the country. 
Vandenberg qualified 11th out of 16 to make the event and was in the second heat of the preliminaries. While he did not finish in the top two of his Friday heat to guarantee his spot in the finals, his third place finals finish, as well as the third place overall time with a 1:51.77, was good enough to get him a spot.
“I was really exicted to see how fast I ran on the first day,” Vandenberg wrote. “I’ve always been a competitive runner, so I knew if I raced against the top runners in the country, I would be able to race as fast as them.”
On Saturday, the finals field was slower as a whole, but Vandenberg still shined. “I had made nationals, so I had accomplished my goal, and running well at the meet was sort of the icing on the cake,” he wrote. 
His time of 1:52.47 was good enough for his fourth place finish and netted Vandenberg the first All-American honors of his college career. Vandenberg’s finish single-handedly placed Carnegie Mellon in a tie for 42nd in the team scores. This event marks the end of the indoor track and field season, but the outdoor season kicks off this weekend at the Washington and Lee Track and Field Carnival.
“I took a couple of days off after nationals, but now I’m back at it. My goals are definitely to qualify again,” he said.

On Saturday, the Carnegie Mellon women’s swimming and diving team finished off their season at the 2014 NCAA Swimming and Diving Championships in Indianapolis, Indiana. Collectively, the team placed 39th overall at the meet.
Senior Soleil Phan finished her collegiate career on a high note, swimming a season-best 52.58 seconds in the 100-yard freestyle on the way to a 27th place finish. Phan also teamed up for a 26th place finish in the 400-yard freestyle relay with senior Megan Garvey, sophomore Felicia Wang, and first-year Gillian Crews. The four women combined for a time of 3:35.05.
Wang was another top individual performer placing 17th in the 100 meter breaststroke, setting a school record and narrowly missing out on a finals spot.
The top performers for the Tartans were the 200- and 400-meter medley relay teams which both set school records and earned honorary All-American titles in the process. The 200-meter team, consisting of sophomore Kira Singhaus, Wang, Crews, and Phan placed 15th with a finals time of 1:45.68. The same athletes combined for a 14th place finish in the 400-meter relay with a combined finals time of 3:50.34.

Carnegie Mellon’s men’s and women’s track and field teams started their outdoor season this weekend at the Washington and Lee Track and Field Carnival. Both squads had top individual performances on the way to strong overall team 
performances.
The men’s team started off strong with first-year Kyle Weaver taking first place in the pole vault. His 4.60 meter vault broke the previous school record of 4.58 meters set back in 2008.
Two other Tartans took home first place finishes for the men. Senior Zach Erra-Hernandez continuing his domination from the indoor track season in the shot put, leading the field with a throw of 15.50 meters. He also placed highly in two new events for him, the discus and hammer. He threw 43.24 and 51.59 meters respectively, good enough for a third-place finish in each.
Sophomore Marc-Daniel Julien netted the Tartans their only track victory with a 1:56.00 time in the 800-meter run. Several other athletes placed highly with a pair of second place finishes in the 5,000- and 10,000-meter runs, and three more third place finishes in the 1,500-meter run, 110-meter hurdles, and long jump.
The Tartan women also had a lot of success at the meet with several top three finishes throughout the meet.
Senior Jacqueline Guevel had a great weekend with a first-place finish in the 400-meter hurdles and a second-place finish in the 100-meter hurdles with times of 1:03.86 and 15.54 respectively.
Junior Sasha Spalding had the other Tartan victory. Her 10.51-meter throw in the shot put was good enough to lead the field and earn a Carnegie Mellon sweep of the event. Spalding also placed third in the long jump with a 5.02-meter leap.
Senior Samantha Oleson had the other top finish, taking second in the shot put with a 10.32-meter toss. Oleson just missed out on two more top finishes, placing fourth in both the discus and hammer throws with throws of 29.53 and 33.60 meters 
respectively.
Both teams will hope to build on their performance as they compete in the Carnegie Mellon Mini-Invite this weekend.

When people think of sports on campus, they often think of varsity sports. These sports take an extraordinary amount of time and talent, things not everyone at Carnegie Mellon may have when it comes to athletics. However, for those of us who are not cut out for varsity or club teams, there are intramural (IM) leagues.
With the end of spring break came the start of a new lineup of intramural sports. Intramurals for the mini 4 semester include badminton doubles, indoor soccer, softball, kickball, tennis doubles, and golf.
One out of five students participates in IM leagues, according to supervisor in athletics Colin Shaffer, a junior ethics, history and public policy and business administration double major. “Participation numbers are constantly growing and we get a wide range of students,” Shaffer said in an email. According to coordinator of intramural and club sports David Wiley, intramurals are designed so that you can go out and have fun while you play sports.
For those who do not have friends who participate in IM sports, a free agent system allows students to meet new people in the community while playing sports for free.
Carnegie Mellon Athletics provides a diverse offering of sports and activities through IM leagues. Some leagues are competitive, but all are open to any student regardless of talent level.
“IM sports provide an opportunity for any student, no matter what their athletic background, to compete and to have fun,” Shaffer said. Some of the leagues are more recreational, designed for students to hang out and have fun. Come championship time, though, Shaffer said, “all of our sports are extremely competitive throughout the women’s, [co-rec], men’s [recreational], and men’s competitive finals.”
While athletes in varsity and club sports compete with students at other schools, IM competition remains entirely within the Carnegie Mellon community. IM leagues have various divisions based on the level of competition people are looking for. There are divisions for students who want to play with no base level of talent or experience, as well as competitive divisions.
Beyond different divisions, there are also a variety of activities. In addition to five-on-five basketball, there are IM leagues for dodgeball, inner tube water polo, and even a rock-paper-scissors tournament. Through these unique sports, the athletics department aims to introduce people to new experiences and make IM sports inclusive, according to Shaffer. “Inner tube water polo is probably one of the most popular sports on campus simply because it is different, it’s fun, and literally anyone can sit in an inner tube for an hour and float around with their friends,” Shaffer said.
It’s easy to get involved, said Wiley. Not only can students play with friends or as free agents, but the games are also refereed by members of the Carnegie Mellon community, who can be near the action without actually playing. IM sports are not limited to students; faculty or any other member of the Carnegie Mellon community can participate too.
With a range of activities designed for wide participation, IM leagues are a place where people can seek either competition or fun. “It’s a way to get out of the classroom and clear your mind,” wrote Wiley in an email. “An active mind cannot exist in an inactive body.”

The first week of March Madness may as well be a national holiday. Starting Thursday, there has been nonstop college basketball from noon until after midnight. Millions of hours of productivity go down the drain for the economy as every sports fan tries to find an excuse to miss work and those poor souls stuck in a cubicle constantly check scores and their brackets. There are the discreet workers, as more brazen ones just watch the games with the NCAA website streaming every game for free, complete with a “Boss Button” that quickly pulls up a faux spreadsheet to give the allusion of being busy. Men are so desperate to get out of work to watch the games that vasectomies rise nearly a thousand percent the week leading up to the first weekend as the forced seated recovery period is the perfect excuse to stay home and sit on the couch while watching the game.
The only redeeming factor for the economy is the massive upswell of gambling, through office pools and Las Vegas sports bookies. March Madness is the perfect storm of gambling. The fixed bracket, propensity for upsets, and near infinite possibilities make it exciting for everyone from the college basketball aficionado to the sports novice who chose their bracket based on mascot cuteness. The odds of a perfect bracket are so astronomically low that billionaire Warren Buffett was willing to offer a billion dollars to anyone on Yahoo with a perfect bracket. By the end of the second day, no one who entered the competition was left unscathed and only one bracket of the millions who entered via Yahoo was still perfect, but that only lasted through the next game the following day.
The magic of March Madness is the Cinderella. The low seeded, generally small conference team that no one outside of their alumni has ever heard from suddenly gets thrust into national spotlight with the improbable upset over the traditional power house. This year has been filled with craziness; we have already guaranteed that at least one double digit seed will reach the elite eight, with 10 seed Stanford and 11 seed Dayton set up to play in the Sweet Sixteen.
With the rise of the “one and done” first-year, veteran mid-major teams — while generally having less raw talent, have the teamwork, leadership, and experience to beat the squads of blue-chip prospect mercenaries fielded by the Kentuckys, Dukes and Kansases of the world. This paradigm shift, inspired by the change in the NBA draft eligibility rules — which force players to be one year out of high school before declaring for the draft — has dramatically increased the parity in the tournament, making it even more ridiculous.
Duke University, a national powerhouse, has now lost in the first round two of the last three years to a 14 and a 15 seed. Florida Gulf Coast University went from a 15 seed to the sweet sixteen, making history in the process. The only holy ground is still the 1 versus 16 matchup, but that doesn’t mean a 16 seed hasn’t come close. The only thing about number one seeds anymore is their propensity for being upset in the second round instead of the first.
The upset has become so common that the 5 versus 12 matchup is universally known for its upset potential. Nearly every year, at least one 12 seed advances in the tournament. This year, three of the four 12 seeds won their games with the fourth — North Carolina State University — blowing a massive lead late in the second half and taking the game to overtime before finally falling to the five seed Saint Louis University.
As we progress into the sweet sixteen and beyond, the upsets should theoretically die down. Cinderella’s carriage is supposed to turn into a pumpkin as the clock strikes midnight and the big boys are supposed to duke it out for the title. But the last few years, things have not been going according to plan, and this year seems no different. With George Mason University, Butler University, Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) and Wichita State University all making final four runs as low seeds in the last eight years, the blue blood schools are consistently getting shown up. This year, traditional powerhouses Duke University, the University of North Carolina State University, Syracuse University, Ohio State University, Villanova University, and the University of Kansas, along with the new class of schools like VCU and Wichita State, which both received high bids given their recent success and lofty records, all got knocked out before the end of this first weekend.
While March Madness has certainly gotten more exciting over the years, the quality of play has debatably declined with the decreased emphasis on team play and increased focus on raising draft stock for the June NBA draft. The college basketball purists may bemoan the degradation of their beloved sports, but I, for one, am thrilled at the prospect that the craziest three weeks in basketball is on the path to somehow becoming even more ridiculous.

The nationally ranked Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s tennis teams were both in action this past weekend against other highly ranked opponents.
Both teams took care of the lower ranked University of Mary Washington, but the men’s team fell to the fifth-ranked Johns Hopkins squad.
On Saturday, the eighth-ranked women’s team traveled to Fredericksburg, Va. to face off against the 21st ranked Eagles. 
The Tartans continued their dominating season as they cruised to an easy 7–2 victory.
Junior Angela Pratt and first-year Nicholle Torres, along with sophomores Brooke Tsu and Abbey Hamstra, jumped the Tartans out to an easy lead as they took two of the three doubles matches.
Carnegie Mellon then put the match away winning five of six singles points, with Tsu winning without conceding a single game, 6–0, 6–0. 
The single Tartan loss came as Hamstra took the game to a third set, but was unable to pull out the victory as she fell 2–6, 6–2, 0–1 (6–10). The 11th-ranked men also faced off against the 17th-ranked Eagles, ultimately winning 6–3.
Junior Bryce Beisswanger and sophomore Yuvraj Kumar took the only Tartan doubles victory 8–6, but the singles play pushed Carnegie Mellon over the top.
With the exception of sophomore Abhishek Alla, all of the Tartans won their singles matches, although several required a third set to do so.
Sunday was a different story as the men faced fifth -ranked Johns Hopkins. The Tartans repeated the start of Saturday as only one pair won their doubles match, although this time it was juniors Christian Heaney-Secord and Will Duncan winning 8–1.
The singles did not quite follow Saturday’s script, as only two Tartans — Heaney-Secord and first-year Kenny Zheng —won their matches by scores of 6–4, 4–6, 6–1, and 7–5, 6–4 respectively. First-year Kiril Kirkov was the only other player for Carnegie Mellon to put up much of a fight as he made it to a third set before falling.
The Carnegie Mellon teams find themselves on the lowerside of the UAA rankings, but have a chance to 
improve.
The men’s tennis team will face off next against teams from Washington and Lee University on Saturday at 10 a.m. at home.
The women’s team will host at home as well; however, their matches will not begin until 1 p.m.

Coming off a spectacular February in which they went 9–1, only losing to the Utah Jazz, expectations were high for the Miami Heat and superstar small forward LeBron James for the month of March. Last year, March was a good month for the Heat, who were in the middle of their 27-game win streak. This streak helped them get the No. 1 overall seed and home court advantage throughout the playoffs. 
However, the performance drop-off seen from the entire team over the course of the last 10 games has been shocking and has seen them fall three games behind the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference. They have gone 4–6 over that stretch while giving up an average of 102.6 PPG, a number unusually high for this team’s stingy defense. What has suddenly gone so wrong for the Heat?
The most obvious and important reason for this sudden drop in performance is the drastic failure in James’s performance since the team’s 107–124 loss against the Charlotte Bobcats on March 3. Over the next three games, James did not reach even 20 points and made only three jump shots. He has not been himself since that game, and with the exception of wins against the Washington Huskies and Cleveland Cavaliers, has shot nowhere near his season average of 57 percent.
It doesn’t help that one of the best defensive players in the game isn’t playing anywhere near his capability on that end. There were several defensive rotations where James seemed lost and did not track his man down — definitely not the way to re-establish himself in the MVP race considering fellow small forward and MVP rival Kevin Durant is in the midst of a 33-game streak of 25 or more points.
Another factor working against the Heat is the presence of too many talented yet underperforming role players. Shooting guard Ray Allen, one of the greatest shooters in NBA history, has been in a season-long slump and is having his worst shooting season statistically. He’s had nowhere near the impact he had on the Heat’s title charge last season. The same goes for small forward Shane Battier. More often than not, Battier has been played on larger power forwards for purely defensive purposes. 0–5 shooting nights aren’t rare anymore; in fact, they’re becoming the norm. The Heat need their two premier perimeter shooters to be on top form to beat the Pacers or any possible contender in the loaded Western Conference. The likes of small forward Michael Beasley and center Greg Oden were supposed to be low-risk, high-reward moves, but both of them have been more of liabilities and have only displayed fleeting moments to showcase the talent they truly possess.
The inconsistent play of the Heat’s other two superstars, forward-center Chris Bosh and guard Dwyane Wade, has also exacerbated the Heat’s situation. Wade looked to be in prime form until this recent stretch and it looked like he would be in optimal shape for the playoffs, but concerns about his knee are resurfacing, and he sat out on one night of back-to-backs again. Bosh had been on a hot streak recently, but his poor defense and lack of menacing presence in the paint or rim protection hurt the Heat against the likes of the San Antonio Spurs, Houston Rockets and the Denver Nuggets, who all exploited the freedom in the paint. 
The Big Three — Bosh, James, and Wade — came together so at least one of them could pick up the slack when other members were going through a slump, but when none of them are clicking, the Heat are in trouble.
Some of coach Eric Spoelstra’s decision-making has also been questionable. The Heat have not used previously key rotation players power forward Udonis Haslem and small forward Rashard Lewis at all during this stretch, which was evident in the recent loss against the Boston Celtics. 
The Heat have also been poor at holding onto large leads. They had double-digit leads in the games against the Celtics and Bulls, both of which they eventually lost.
The Heat haven’t had this bad a stretch since March 2011 when the Big Three were in their first season together. It’s been a similar story this time around. 
Teams like the Brooklyn Nets, Chicago Bulls, and of course, the Pacers are going to pose stern challenges in their conference and any of the West’s top eight teams would present a more than formidable challenge. If the Heat want their coveted three-peat, they need to get their act together and do it soon.

Room selection offers students several options: room retention, room with a retainer (also known as a “pull-in”), general room selection, RA/CA housing, special-interest housing, block housing, gender-neutral housing, and open assignments.
Most students will participate in one of three room selection choices: room retention, room with a retainer, or general room selection. However, a wide variety of housing options is available to all students. Room selection begins on March 6, so all students returning next year should begin thinking about their housing plans for the 2014–15 school year.
Room retention
Room retention, the first phase, is for students planning to retain their current room for the next school year. Although there are some exceptions, room retention is available to most upperclass students, except those in special-interest housing, a first-year dormitory, or an RA/CA room. First-year students are not eligible to retain their rooms, regardless of their room location. Students considering room retention should remember that once they retain, they cannot change or cancel their housing assignment until the open cancellation period begins.
Room with a retainer
Students retaining their rooms during the first phase are required to fill any vacancies in the room, suite, or apartment with “pull-ins.” In order to be “pulled in” to a room, students must be eligible to participate in room selection and must not have already selected an assignment for the school year.
General room selection
General room selection is the final phase of room selection. During this phase, students eligible for housing who haven’t participated in the preceding phases choose a room from the remaining spaces. Students planning to participate in general room selection must apply online. They are then given a random room selection time slot.
RA/CA housing
RA/CA housing is only available for those students holding an RA or CA position during the 2014–15 school year. These students will not be eligible to participate in room selection, and will instead be assigned a room through the application and selection process carried out by the Office of Student Life.
Special-interest housing
Special-interest housing allows groups of students to apply for group housing centered around a certain interest or theme. Special-interest housing groups should consider how they plan to positively impact the larger residential community before completing the special-interest housing application process.
Block housing
The block housing phase of room selection allows groups of students to select a “block” of rooms near each other in one of the applicable dormitories. Students electing to apply for block housing must identify a group representative who will be responsible for setting up their block housing group on the housing application and will remain the main contact point between the group and Housing Services.
Gender-neutral housing
Gender-neutral housing, available in the Oakland Community Apartments, permits upperclass residents of different genders to reside in the same room.
Open assignments
Due to fluctuating availability in room assignments, some students are given an open assignment. This means that while they are guaranteed a room for the 2014–15 academic year, they will not immediately know where that room will be located, or what style of room they will be assigned. After receiving an open assignment, students wait until they receive an offer for a room for the upcoming year. After receiving their offer, they can decline the offer and cancel their housing agreement within three days without penalty, even if the offer was made after the open cancellation period ends.

Fairfax Apartments
Location: 4616 Fifth Ave., near the corner of Fifth Avenue and Craig Street
Styles of housing: Apartments — one-bedroom (two students) and efficiency (two students); the Fairfax Annex has two-bedroom apartments (three students)
Size: 272 residents
Room retention: Yes
Kitchens: In each apartment and efficiency
Lounges: Community room in basement with limited availability
Other amenities: Laundry room and aerobics room in the basement
The Fairfax Apartments are an excellent transition for upperclassmen to living in off-campus housing. Once acquainted with back-alley shortcuts, it’s a quick 10-to-15-minute walk to campus, and the building’s proximity to S. Craig Street, which houses many restaurants that are open late at night, make it appealing to many college students. 
Inside the individual apartments, every room is carpeted, except for the kitchen and bathroom, which have tiling. The walls, conveniently, are solid — a welcome change from the paper-thin dividers that separate rooms in some on-campus housing. Fairfax is also relatively quiet, although every now and then, a group of happy, shouting people may break the silence. The rooms are furnished and come prepared with beds, tables, and drawers. The kitchen has a stove and refrigerator. Some units even have dishwashers. Air conditioning and heating are included, as well.
Bus stops for the 54C, 71 series, and 75 are also located close to the building’s doors. 
Laundry payment may be the largest problem students have with Fairfax. Doing laundry requires that students first buy a $5 card to pay for the machines. The card does not actually come with $5; students must input money manually, and the machine accepts only bills. 
In addition, Fairfax’s Internet connection uses Comcast rather than Carnegie Mellon’s Internet. Finally, the cost of living is one of the highest at Carnegie Mellon, but Fairfax’s amenities and its location may justify some of those expenses.
Doherty Apartments
Location: On the corner of Forbes Avenue and Beeler Street
Styles of housing: Apartments — one-bedroom (three students) and efficiencies (two students); a two-bedroom suite for special-interest housing
Size: About 150 residents
Room retention: Yes
Kitchens: In each apartment and efficiency
Lounges: Study lounge, TV lounge
Other amenities: Lounges include a piano, pool table, and ping-pong table; laundry facilities include six washers and six dryers; exercise facilities include four cardio machines and dumbbells. 
Located close to campus facilities, Doherty Apartments is a good option for on-campus housing. It is a three-minute walk to the Resnik Café and 10 minutes from most classes. Doherty is a solid option for students who wish to have their own kitchen in an autonomous apartment style of living.
Doherty is divided into four separate towers, each headed by its own RA, who provides his or her residents with essentials: trash bags, paper towels, and, of course, toilet paper. Each tower consists of three floors and a basement.
As a community, there are weekly events to satisfy your sweet tooth and appropriate exercise programs to sweat off the day’s regret. However, due primarily to the tower layout of the building, making friends in Doherty can be more difficult than in other housing options. 
Doherty Apartments provides air conditioning only in its exercise room. However, the heating system was upgraded recently.
The rooms provide a mix of privacy and integration with roommates. The one-bedroom triples include a bedroom for the three beds, a bathroom, and a living room with a kitchenette. The living room also has three study desks, a dining table, a couch, and a small loveseat. Two-person efficiencies are similar, though everything is located in a single room without some of the furniture.
Doherty Apartments provides a decently-sized living area for those who seek autonomy in college life.
Margaret Morrison Apartments
Location: On Margaret Morrison Street, beside the Greek apartments
Styles of housing: Apartments — two-floor, two-bedroom (four students)
Size: 80 students
Room retention: Yes
Kitchens: In each apartment
Lounges: One near the storefronts
Margaret Morrison Apartments, located on the Hill, offers residents on-campus apartments. Each unit has two floors, with a lounge and kitchen on the first floor and bedrooms and bathrooms either up or down a floor, depending on the apartment. All of the “Maggie Mo” apartments were redone in 2007, when they were refitted with new furniture, appliances, and countertops.
The bedrooms are some of the biggest that you will find on campus. Each apartment has a kitchen, which is nice for upperclassmen tired of campus food.
Additionally, each of the apartment units is separate from the others.Residents also have access to laundry and exercise facilities, which are on the street level of Margaret Morrison Street.
Starting next academic year, Margaret Morrison apartments 131 and 132 will be a 16-person “Sustainability House” which is accepting applications for residents.
Although the common areas may be a bit tight, “Maggie Mo” can offer residents the chance to have independence while still living on campus.
McGill House
Location: The Hill — across the courtyard from Boss, in front of Hamerschlag
Styles of housing: Prime singles and prime doubles
Size: 71 residents (female only)
Room retention: Yes
Kitchens: One on the first floor
Lounges: One per floor, and one main lounge on the first floor with a study lounge
Other amenities: Laundry room
McGill, Carnegie Mellon’s only all-female dorm, offers residents prime doubles and singles arranged into suites. Each suite connects two doubles, or two doubles and one single. Rooms in McGill are small, so residents are often forced to loft their beds. However, the size of the rooms is offset by the convenience of semiprivate bathrooms in each suite.
McGill may be one of the smaller dorms, but residents’ social lives are certainly not limited. McGill offers a friendly environment, especially since residents can socialize in any of the individual floor lounges or in the large first-floor television room and study area. 
Weekly events bring together residents from both Boss and McGill and offer a reliable dose of fun and entertainment. Also, if residents tire of their own building, they are just a few steps away from other Hill residences.
McGill’s location on Margaret Morrison Street, like the other Hill residences, make it exceptionally convenient to a number of locations. Residents can catch art exhibitions, shows, and events at The Frame, Carnegie Mellon’s student-run art gallery on the corner of Forbes Avenue and Margaret Morrison Street.
A short walk across the street, residents can take advantage of the nearby campus dining locations, including Tartans Pavilion, the Carnegie Mellon Café, and the Zebra Lounge. When campus food gets too monotonous, the food trucks parked nearby offer a great alternative to on-campus dining.
Morewood Gardens
Location: Corner of Forbes and Morewood avenues
Styles of housing: Prime singles, prime doubles, prime triples; one six-person and one 10-person suite reserved for special-interest housing
Size: 455 residents
Room retention: Yes
Kitchens: Three, one on the second, fourth, and sixth floors
Lounges: Two lounges per floor
Other amenities: TV room, quiet study lounge, computer cluster, workout facility, recreation room, and two laundry facilities at opposite ends of the building
While students of most residences have to pull on their shoes and head to campus to find a hot meal or a working printer, Morewood Gardens residents need not leave the premises. Fully equipped with a computer cluster, a source of convenient (albeit greasy) food at The Underground, large laundry rooms, and a gym, this dorm is completely self-sufficient. And what’s more, it’s smack at the corner of Morewood and Forbes Avenues, only a couple of steps away from campus.
The dorm’s proximity to campus gives it a significant edge over other residential areas. This factor maximizes your sleep time before early classes and also allows you to sprint back for your homework when you realize you’ve left it in your room. 
While both Stever and Mudge houses are located on Morewood Avenue, they normally house only first-year students, making Morewood the only choice for older students who want to live in this area.
Morewood’s plentiful lounges, including a few on each floor in addition to the larger study rooms and TV lounge on the first floor, allow for frequent group gatherings. While this is a positive attribute for more social students, it means that several rooms on each floor are likely to experience frequent noise disturbances throughout the day and night.
When choosing a room in Morewood, it’s hit-or-miss. Some rooms are spacious and quiet, while others are small and loud. It’s the luck of the draw, and sometimes you lose. Try to plan out which rooms look best from the floor plans online, and try to visit a room before committing. This will give you a good idea of what you’re getting.
Morewood Gardens could be a great place to live, but before deciding to move in, check out the rooms ahead of time and ask the current residents about the noise situation, as some rooms are better than others.
Neville Apartments
Location: 617 Neville St., at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Neville Street
Styles of housing: Apartments (six-occupant apartment with single and double bedrooms)
Size: 24 residents
Room retention: Yes
Kitchens: In each apartment
Lounges: One common basement, four living rooms
The Neville Apartments are a living community through the Carnegie Mellon housing system, comprised of eight apartments that feature a mix of double and single bedrooms. Previously a co-op, Neville is now a traditional apartment living situation.
Neville apartments contains fully furnished bedrooms and living spaces, with each of the four apartments containing two bathrooms. Additionally, each apartment has a mix of single and double rooms, as well as two kitchens containing a stove and refrigerator. The basement contains laundry facilities and a student lounge, and students will have to purchase their Internet service from Comcast.
This switch back to apartment-styled housing is a new shift, as Neville had been run as a housing co-op since 2003. The co-op was created based on the tenets of sustainability and environmental awareness, activism, and equality in race, gender, and sexuality.
Residents who had applied for admission were encouraged to participate in various events hosted by the current members of the co-op during the room selection period. 
Neville Apartments will not be application-based housing, but can be selected through the standard university housing selection process.
During its time as a co-op, Neville had no RAs, instead using liaisons to the Housing and Student Life offices who would help the co-op solve housing problems. However, with the transition to apartments, this is unlikely to remain the case, as current Carnegie Mellon-affiliated apartments make use of the RA system.
What kind of community Neville will have after its co-op days has yet to be seen, but the building and space will remain the same as it was.
Roselawn Houses
Location: Roselawn Terrace (off Margaret Morrison Street)
Styles of housing: Three-bedroom houses (one single, two doubles)
Size: Five students in each of 12 houses
Room retention: Yes
Kitchens: One in each house
Lounges: One in the common Margaret Morrison space and a living space in each house
The Roselawn Terrace houses, located off Margaret Morrison Street, are some of the most sought-after housing options on campus. Roselawn is located on the edge of campus, providing students with a feeling of independence while still only having to walk less than 10 minutes to get to class. 
Each house, divided into a single-occupancy room and two double-occupancy rooms, holds five students. The bedrooms are quite small — so small, in fact, that one of the doubles can’t hold both residents’ desks. The upside to this is that the living area on the first floor is spacious.
Living rooms have hardwood floors and comfortable furniture. Each dining room has a large table that seats six by a wall of windows. Kitchens have been completely refinished with new cabinets and appliances. All the walls in the houses have been given a fresh coat of paint with vibrant accent colors.
One downside to the Roselawn houses is that residents no longer have access to the basement, cutting down on the storage space previously offered. The rooms also have closets that tend to be too small for most people’s wardrobes. 
In addition to the large living spaces offered in Roselawn, residents have access to the Margaret Morrison lounge and exercise room. All Roselawn residents are also on the campus laundry network, getting free laundry and access to laundromat-style dryers.
Another good thing about Roselawn houses is that, while there is more than enough living space, the cost of living in the house is less than the cost of living in some Oakland apartments.
Roselawn houses offer the feeling of living on your own, while still providing residents with the amenities and assistance of campus housing. If you don’t care about the size of your bedroom, Roselawn is the place to live.
Shady Oak Apartments
Location: 601 Clyde Street
Styles of housing: Apartments — efficiency (two students), two- and three-bedroom 
apartments (three students)
Size: 82 residents
Room retention: Yes
Kitchens: One in each apartment and one in the basement
Lounges: One in the basement with multiple couches and a big-screen TV
Other amenities: Street parking available and a spacious backyard with a grill
Shady Oak, located on Clyde Street, contains apartments each boast a full kitchen complete with an electric stove and oven, as well as a dishwasher. The layouts vary greatly from apartment to apartment, with some having single bedrooms and no common living space, others having shared bedrooms with spacious living rooms, and others having a combination of the two. 
There is a lounge in the basement with numerous couches and a big-screen TV; this space is commonly used for watching sporting events and hosting study groups. Basic gym equipment is also located in the basement. For students who want to keep an active lifestyle and don’t get enough of a workout from the 10-minute walk to campus, there are multiple treadmills, an elliptical trainer, and a weight-lifting station. 
The basement is also home to four washers and four dryers — not on the campus laundry network and accepting only quarters — and a large table for folding laundry.
Venture outside to find a picnic table and charcoal grill that is always available. The backyard is large enough to play a game of Frisbee or football with friends. Across the street, there is a bus stop for the 71C, which can be taken to Downtown to watch a show or to East Liberty for a date at Target.
There are some drawbacks to living in Shady Oak. The plumbing has a tendency to malfunction, sometimes causing pipes to burst, leading to water shut-offs. The radiators have also been a cause for concern: They are set on a building-wide timer that can sometimes shut off in the middle of the night or be set on full blast on warmer days.
Woodlawn Apartments
Location: At the corner of Forbes Avenue and Margaret Morrison Street
Styles of housing: Apartment — one-bedroom (two students), two-bedroom (four students), and four-bedroom (seven students)
Size: 35 residents
Room retention: Yes
Kitchens: One or two full kitchens per apartment
Lounges: TV lounge and exercise room, shared with Margaret Morrison Apartments
Other amenities: Two washers and two dryers are in the basement. The Frame, a small student-run art gallery, is also located on the first floor.
Woodlawn Apartments may be one of the older housing options on campus, but it is convenient for walking to class, and it’s right on the Forbes Avenue bus routes that can take you anywhere else that you’d like to go.
The bedrooms and living rooms both boast plenty of space, a definite upgrade for those used to sharing cramped quarters. Some rooms have hardwood floors; others have thin carpeting. The building will be undergoing renovations this summer to upgrade the wiring and fixtures in addition to installing brand-new bathrooms.
Several times per semester, The Frame art gallery, which is housed in the first floor of the apartment building, has loud parties that can be heard throughout the building. 
Woodlawn Apartments is great if you want to live with a big group of friends, since each apartment houses a lot of people. Woodlawn is also a good choice if you want a small community and are looking to live in an apartment on campus.
West Wing/Resnik House
Location: Adjacent to Gesling Stadium, next to the University Center
Styles of housing: Suite — typically five students share a common living space and bathroom
Dorm — prime singles and prime doubles
Size: 296 residents
Room retention: Yes
Kitchens: Two in West Wing, two in Resnik
Lounges: West Wing all floors, Resnik all floors
Resnik and West Wing are the ideal dormitory choices for students who aren’t ready — or aren’t willing — to move off campus but want a bit more of a grown-up place to live in than a typical dorm. While students in these dorms have the chance to be more independent, they also boast a quick walk to any of the academic buildings on campus, a definite benefit for those mornings when you just can’t stop hitting the snooze button.
Both dorms consist primarily of suites, which are made up of two doubles and a single with a common bathroom and lounge for the suite. A limited number of prime singles and doubles do exist in the buildings as well, though they are not as well known.
Resnik and West Wing are optimal for a group of friends who wish to live together but want to maintain their proximity to campus and the other advantages — like free toilet paper and a once-a-week bathroom cleaning — that living on campus offers. Students mostly stay inside their suites, leaving the hallways relatively quiet. The lounges do fill up, however — usually with groups of students either working on homework or playing video games.
Both buildings offer kitchens on certain floors, which is nice when you’ve had your fill of The Exchange and El Gallo de Oro. If you don’t feel like cooking, Resnik is home to a number of dining options. There is the Tartans Pavilion, the Carnegie Mellon Café, and Resnik Café. In particular, Resnik Café offers a variety of choices, including sushi, Indian cuisine, and comfort foods, among others.
With the numerous amenities that Resnik and West Wing offer, it is not surprising that both of these dorms fill up early in the room selection process. Hopeful residents are advised to find a friend who can pull them in.
Webster Hall/Shirley Apartments
Location: 101/103 N. Dithridge St.
Styles of housing: Apartments — one-bedroom (two students) and two-bedroom (three students); prime singles
Size: 273 residents
Room retention: Yes
Kitchens: One in each apartment
Lounges: None, but each apartment has a living area
Other amenities: TV room, quiet study lounge, workout facility, recreation room, and two laundry facilities at opposite ends of the building
Webster Hall, located at the corner of Fifth Avenue and North Dithridge Street, is a popular off-campus residence offered by Carnegie Mellon. Webster is located in the heart of Oakland, about a 10-minute walk from campus. One of the first stops on the Carnegie Mellon shuttle line, Webster offers easy access to the numerous restaurants, cafés, convenience stores, and shops located in the Oakland area.
Carnegie Mellon rents out one-bedroom apartments to two students, and two-bedroom apartments to three students. The apartments are spacious and offer many benefits that dorm rooms do not, including a fully-furnished living room, two bathrooms, and a kitchen. For many students, this escape from typical dorm life is the basis of Webster’s appeal.
In addition to the spacious apartments, students also benefit from the facilities offered by Webster. The building contains a gym, a homestyle deli, and even an in-house hair and waxing salon. Additionally, each floor has a trash-disposal facility and a laundry room.
There are, however, some small disadvantages. The laundry facilities can become a hassle for many residents. Using the facilities can become expensive, with a cost of $2.50 to wash and dry one load of clothes. The dryers on most floors are not fully functional, often requiring two full runs to completely dry clothes. For many students, this is one of the biggest complaints about Webster.
An additional point for consideration is the price. Renting apartments in Webster can be costly, but like Fairfax Apartments, its location and perks may justify the price.
Shirley Apartments, located next door to Webster Hall, contains a floor plan similar to Webster’s floor plan. Each apartment has a bedroom, a living area, and a kitchen, while the efficiencies are essentially rooms with a bathroom and a kitchen. One downside of Shirley, however, is that it is one of the farthest living spaces from campus. 
Welch House/Henderson House
Location: Behind Scobell House, on Margaret Morrison Street
Styles of housing: Prime singles and prime doubles
Size: 83 residents
Room retention: Yes, except for non-single rooms on the first floor
Kitchens: One on the lower level in each building
Lounges: TV lounges and study areas in both buildings
As one of the more recently renovated student dorms on campus, Henderson House is a clean and quiet place to live. This dorm offers students air conditioning and heating, connected bathrooms — which are cleaned once a week — shared with one other room, and the intimacy of a small building, with 20 rooms per floor. The first floor is generally reserved for first-years only. 
Accepting residents by application only, Henderson along with McGill are considered “Wellness Houses,” because they promote green practices, maintain a substance-free lifestyle, and generally encourage healthy living. Each student who lives here is expected to sign an agreement promising to adhere to these standards during the school year. Students can also take advantage of playing for the house’s intramural teams or participating in weekly optional community activities set up by the resident assistants. Tickets to special events like plays or shows are subsidized by the dorm, which is a nice perk. 
Henderson, although placed on the outskirts of Carnegie Mellon, is sheltered from any traffic or noise from campus. The dorm’s residents also respect an unwritten policy of peace and quiet, which makes this dorm ideal for studying. 
Despite all Henderson has to offer students, there are drawbacks. Dorm rooms are not the largest, and on occasion the heating will malfunction, overheating many of the rooms.
Welch is one of the Hill houses, but it distinguishes itself by having a 24-hour quiet rule. This often means that Welch attracts students who prefer to keep to themselves and are less interested in creating a community atmosphere. However, the atmosphere seems to suit students who want a comfortable home and don’t want to be distracted by noise. The rooms are large and bathrooms are spacious.

Oakland
Just a 10-to-15-minute walk (or five-minute bus ride) from campus lies the neighborhood of Oakland, the home of late-night food, University of Pittsburgh pride, and a population made up almost entirely of college students. Oakland is home to some of Carnegie Mellon students’ favorite restaurants, including Conflict Kitchen, Chipotle, Fuel and Fuddle, and The Porch. For students over 21, Oakland has a solid group of late-night destinations, such as local bars like Hemingway’s, Mad Mex with its margaritas, and a liquor store with an extensive selection, all within walking distance from each other. Another benefit of Oakland is its availability of affordable housing close to campus. Oakland Avenue and Atwood Avenue are lined with housing for both Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh students.
Most people living here are always up for fun; if you’re looking for a quiet neighborhood, Oakland may not be your cup of tea. Starting on Thursday nights — the start of the weekend for Pitt students — the neighborhood bustles, filled with groups of college kids out to have a good time. Oakland should be noted for its lively atmosphere and is ideal for anyone looking for an extended weekend and college-oriented surroundings.
Shadyside
Shadyside is home to upperclassmen from Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh, graduate students, and young working professionals. Accessible by Pittsburgh buses, it tends to be slightly pricier than Oakland or Squirrel Hill; however, it is the most charming of the areas surrounding campus, with its tree-lined streets and boutiques. The neighborhood is best known for two things: shops and bars. Walnut Street is lined with a wide variety of shops, from small boutiques to Apple, J. Crew, Ann Taylor, and Banana Republic. Cozy restaurants like the Walnut Grill are interspersed among the shops.
Just blocks from the restaurants are Shadyside’s bars. William Penn Tavern and Shady Grove are the most popular, known by Carnegie Mellon students as the closest bar locations outside of Panther Hollow Inn. William Penn Tavern in particular gathers a large number of Carnegie Mellon students. On Tuesdays and Sundays, William Penn Tavern is open to all ages for its wing nights, where customers can get 10 wings in a variety of flavors, from traditional BBQ to the flavor mix of “the kitchen sink,” for a great price.
While the area near these bars can be particularly loud from Thursday to Sunday, Shadyside is generally a very relaxed, quiet area. The young professionals and the college students who live there are diverse ­— from artists to technical majors to medical students. Shadyside is a great area for anyone looking for either an escape from campus or a popular shopping and nightlife experience.
Squirrel Hill
is either a 20-minute walk or a three-minute bus ride from campus, and the buses are very frequent — all of the 61 buses serve the route. The cost of living in Squirrel Hill is higher than in Oakland, but lower than in Shadyside. Furthermore, Squirrel Hill is the most residential of all the areas surrounding campus. In addition to housing upperclass students from Carnegie Mellon, it is also home to faculty and Pittsburgh families not associated with the university. Most Carnegie Mellon students know the neighborhood for its restaurants and Giant Eagle. Squirrel Hill has a vast diversity of restaurants, from Thai food at Silk Elephant to Mediterranean food at Mediterranean Grill to the waffles at Waffallonia. The restaurants are dispersed among small shops, including those on the main thoroughfare of Forbes Avenue.
On Murray Avenue, just off of Forbes, Giant Eagle is the perfect one-stop shop for all of your food shopping necessities. Squirrel Hill is relatively quiet, with most noise coming from traffic on Forbes and Murray Avenues. It is not a college neighborhood like Oakland and Shadyside, and it does not have a prominent bar scene. It does have a residential atmosphere, however, that the other two areas lack. 
For someone looking for a short ride or walk from campus with all the necessities within walking distance and a wide variety of cuisines, Squirrel Hill may be the right place to look for a home to rent.

What’s New?
New upperclassmen housing: 624 Clyde house
Located across from Shady Oak apartments at 624 Clyde St., the new 624 Clyde house will contain 28–34 apartments for off-campus living. Unlike other off-campus residences, 624 Clyde will be looking strictly for students “with a global curiosity,” according to the application — students “who are committed to deepening their own intercultural competency, and who have an interest in developing a mutual understanding of their responsibilities to be active global citizens seeking to bring change to the world they can influence.” The building will have a kitchen, study lounge, and three common rooms.
CPDC replaces rooms on West Wing 2nd Floor
Students will be unable to apply for housing for the second floor of West Wing because the space will soon hold the new Career and Professional Development Center (CPDC), which currently resides in the basement of the University Center. Likewise, students who currently live on the second floor of West Wing will have to move elsewhere for the fall semester, but will be given priority during Room Selection. 
Morewood Gardens to offer block housing
This fall, Morewood Gardens will join off-campus locations in offering block housing for upperclassmen. For block housing, six to 12 students may choose a “block” of apartments or rooms next to each other so that they may be in close contact. This option is popular for first-year students who enjoyed the people on their dorm floor, or for those who want to have better access to their closest friends. Other dorms that offer block housing include Webster, Fairfax, Neville, Shady Oak, and Shirley Apartments.
Fairfax Apartments not offering certain rooms
Rooms 218, 219, 319, 419, 519, 618, 619, 718, 719, 810, 819, and 919 will be unavailable as living spaces for the 2014–15 academic year, due to a need for “ongoing maintenance,” according to Housing and Dining Services. Students currently in these rooms will be given priority during room selection.

Last November, astrophysicist Alan H. Guth — Victor F. Weisskopf professor of physics and a Margaret MacVicar fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology — discussed the theory of inflation in his lecture “Inflationary Cosmology: Is Our Universe Part of a Multiverse” at Carnegie Mellon. The presence of such a world-renowned physicist on campus caused quite a flurry of excitement, but now Guth’s lecture has an added significance: Evidence for the theory of inflation, which Guth first proposed in 1980, was finally confirmed this past Monday.
When our universe was approximately 380,000 years old, the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) came into existence. In its earliest stages, long before the formation of stars and planets, the universe was a very hot and dense place, where protons and electrons moved around freely in plasma. 
As the universe expanded and cooled, protons were able to combine with electrons to form hydrogen and photons began to decouple from the matter, leaving behind the CMB — a faint radiation echo of the Big Bang that permeates the entire universe.
However, according to physicsworld.com, the CMB showed that the universe is homogeneous, flat, and isotropic, which is contrary to the highly curved and heterogeneous structure suggested by the Big Bang Theory. It was this disagreement which prompted Guth to propose the theory of inflation.
Inflation is the idea that fractions of a second after the Big Bang — within 10-34 seconds — the universe underwent a period of exponential expansion in which it increased at a rate faster than the speed of light. According to PBS, the universe expanded by at least a factor of 1025 during this minuscule period of time. This rapid expansion accounts for the smooth and flat appearance of the CMB.
So how can an event that occurred 13.8 billion years ago be confirmed? According to CNN Tech, there are tiny ripples in the fabric of spacetime called quantum fluctuations that were blown up during inflation, launching gravitational waves that can be observed in the CMB today. As the waves pass through spacetime, they will squeeze the fabric in one direction and stretch it in another, creating two types of polarization known as E-modes and B-modes.
While E-modes have already been detected in the CMB, they can also be a result of other mechanisms. This past Monday, however, the Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization telescope (BICEP2), which scans the sky from the south pole, finally detected B-mode polarization.
According to universetoday.com, other teams will continue to verify these results from their own measurements in the next year. The confirmation of the theory of inflation not only validates the origin of the structure of the universe, but also predicts the existence of a multiverse — an entire collection of multiple universes.

Google Glass, a set of glasses that will stream an augmented reality pertinent to one’s surroundings has recently sparked a new debate about the way technology affects our lives. Augmented reality is a perfectly clear view of the world that is supplemented, or augmented, by computer-generated sensory input. It’s the idea that we can stay forever plugged in to the Internet and our surroundings. Wearing Glass will provide us with a constant stream of information about where we’re headed and with whom we’re talking. Programmed to get smarter over time about the types of information it provides us, the glasses respond to movements in the eyes, rather than physical controls.
While the capabilities of Glass all sound advantageous, one of the questions that Google still hasn’t been able to answer about the device is how much it will distract users. Until the technology improves, the biggest danger with Glass and other types of augmented reality is that those wearing them have to constantly focus and re-focus their eyes to see both the world around them and the text on their screen. For example, wearing Glass while driving, although helpful from a navigation perspective, could be incredibly dangerous because drivers will be focusing on reading directions from Google Maps instead of on the road.
Perhaps just as important of a question is that of privacy. Do we really want people knowing where we are at all times? Checking in on Facebook is a conscious decision we make; there’s no automatic feature that will post where we are at all times. With Glass, there’s a constant record of where you go and what you do. Glass has a camera feature, where you can take pictures and videos of whatever you want. If someone pulls out their cell phone, those around them can see what they’re doing, but Glass users can take pictures or videos without anyone knowing.
How private will pictures and videos be? And will law enforcement or the NSA ever have access to pictures taken by Glass users that might be evidence of criminal activity? Do we really want to be talking to someone who is wearing a device that can tell what kind of mood we are in or instantly pull up our Facebook page? On the other hand, Glass could make strides socially for people with autism or prosopagnosia, a disorder that causes a person to have difficulty recognizing faces.
When Apple’s Siri was first released, it was anticipated by Forbes to be one of the most potent and influential technologies ever released, but after only a few months it fell completely out of favor. The frenzy over Glass may also be completely forgotten in a few years. Augmented reality prompts us to consider what we lose socially to technology.

With a constant demand for cleaner energy sources as technology advances, one alternative that has been receiving a lot of attention in recent years is electric cars. It has been a goal among many researchers to cut the cost of batteries in electric cars so that the vehicles can become a competitive alternative to the traditional engine-operated cars.
In 2010, researchers at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) developed a wireless charging technology called Shaped Magnetic Field in Resonance (SMFIR). This new method of charging is compatible with online electric vehicles (OLEVs) and could allow electric cars to collect electricity from a road-embedded charging system, making electric cars a much more viable form of transportation.
In his 2011 paper titled “Application of SMFIR Technology to Future Urban Transportation,” professor of the Graduate School for Green Transportation at KAIST In-Soo Suh states that “SMFIR technology enables the electric vehicle to be charged while the vehicle is in motion” as opposed to being charged from traditional charging stations. Power cables embedded in the road create magnetic fluxes, which can be collected by OLEVs to fuel them.
The charging mechanism on the road gets activated only when OLEVs run over it, so other vehicles will not be hindered by the magnetic field. When an OLEV hovers over the charging mechanism, a power inverter installed on the road lets current flow. Then the pickup device — made of a ferrite core and coiled with copper wires — installed underneath the vehicle collects the magnetic flux. After the induced current of collected magnetic flux is converted into DC power, the Power Distribution Unit (PDU) then distributes it to the appropriate sectors within the vehicle. 
The harvested electricity can be either used to operate the electric motor or can be stored in a battery for emergency purposes. This battery is one-third to one-fifth the size of the battery for traditional electric vehicles because OLEV does not require as much storage space. Also, vehicles can be charged either when they are running or when they are stationary. According to KAIST, only 5 to 15 percent of the road needs to have charging devices implanted in order for the vehicles to safely operate.
Suh’s paper further explains the processes of wireless power transfer systems: the supply mechanism embedded on the road operates by having multiple segments of powered cable loops with various lengths. Each segment has two cable lines with currents of opposite directions, which creates a dense magnetic flux in between the cables. 
When the sensor on the road detects an OLEV, the powered cable loops begin the supply process. The ferrite structure within the segment determines the shape of the magnetic field, which influences the density of the magnetic flux. 
Thus, depending on the vehicle profile — such as its speed and acceleration — on certain parts of the road, design decisions of the supply mechanism (such as where to install it or how long the segment should be) can be altered for the optimum efficiency.
Currently, OLEVs are being tested in many regions of Korea. Since March 2010, OLEV trams in Seoul Grand Park in South Korea have been used to transport visitors to various destinations around the park. Also, since last July, OLEV buses have been tested as a public transportation system for Gumi-Si in Korea. OLEVs are an optimal fit for public transportation systems like buses and trains, as those vehicles operate on predetermined tracks, allowing for easier and more efficient installation of power cables.

Climate change, Lyme disease linked
Researchers from the Public Health Agency of Canada in Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec have discovered evidence that global warming could promote the spread of Lyme disease. They discovered that the spread of mild temperatures between 1971 and 2010 corresponded with the distribution of the deer tick Ixodes scapularis, which carries the bacteria that causes Lyme disease. Over the past few decades, the prevalence of Lyme disease has greatly increased. The researchers suggest that if the current climate projections for now until 2070 hold true, Lyme disease will continue to spread.

U.S. and Mexico restore ecosystem
The United States and Mexico have agreed to open the floodgates of the Morelos Dam near Yuma County, Ariz. on Mar. 23 for almost two months in an attempt to restore the Colorado River Delta ecosystem. 
The ecosystem has withered from lack of water since the repeated damming of the Colorado River. Researchers, who have studied the river channel to determine the optimal time for restoration, chose the date. They hope that the deluge will create sandbars that will become a habitat for new seedlings, flush salt from the soil, and replenish groundwater stores.

Calcium to prevent alcoholism relapse
Researchers at the Central Institute of Mental Health and the University of Heidelberg in Mannheim, Germany have gathered data that suggests that the calcium ions present in acamprosate, a drug approved as treatment for alcoholism, could be the active ingredient, not the acamprosate itself. The team previously determined that abstinence from alcohol raises glutamate levels, which makes a person more likely to relapse into alcoholism. The team’s new research suggests that the calcium present in the drug reduces glutamate levels, which suggests that acamprosate itself is inactive.

Brain distinguishes real vs fake laughs
Researchers from Royal Holloway, University of London have discovered that the brain is able to distinguish between sincere and fake laughter and responds differently based on its sincerity. The team monitored the brain responses of participants who listened to people produce genuine laughter from watching funny videos, as well as forced laughter. The researchers found that the participants’ brains had very different responses to genuine laughter versus forced laughter.

According to the U.S. Geological Survey, a toilet flush uses anywhere from one to four gallons of water. What happens to all of this water? Does it all go to waste? Last Friday, Mark van Loosdrecht, professor of environmental biotechnology at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, gave a lecture on “Waste-Based Biorefineries.”
Van Loosdrecht, an Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors (AEESP) Foundation 2013–14 distinguished lecturer, has been a professor at the Delft University of Technology for over 25 years, and is well known for his research in biofilm and granular sludge systems for wastewater treatment.
The lecture, sponsored in part by the civil and environmental engineering department at the University of Pittsburgh, discussed how wastewater is recycled into viable components, such as chemicals and cellulose fibers.
The original purpose of wastewater treatment, van Loosdrecht said, was sanitation. In the 1970s, however, many people became more environmentally aware and realized the potential of reusing wastewater and the components of biological waste to produce chemicals or even energy.
“Today we call it resource recovery, when we get things out of the water to use again, like phosphates,” van Loosdrecht said. “In the future, we think we could really integrate this into production cycles — integrate it into the chemical industry.”
Recently, the focus of wastewater recovery research has shifted to the production of energy from the associated biological waste. This research, however, is difficult to do on a large scale in an economically- and energy-efficient manner.
Van Loosdrecht began with a discussion of common resource recovery practices, such as recycling cellulose fibers from the toilet paper in wastewater. 
Although these fibers can be recycled into new toilet paper, van Loosdrecht said, it would be difficult to find a market for this method. Instead, the fibers — which are separated from wastewater with sieves — are used as a component of road asphalt, where the length and quality of the fibers is irrelevant.
Van Loosdrecht discussed many of the important chemical products that can be extracted from wastewater, and the existing processes for such extraction.
Polyhydroxyalkanoates — better known as PHAs — for example, can be used for a variety of applications ranging from making plastics to paper to probiotics in fish food. PHA is produced by many of the bacteria found in the organic waste that can be separated from waste water.
“It’s an interesting compound — PHA — because almost every bacteria can make it. It’s almost more interesting to study which bacteria can’t make it,” van Loosdrecht said. “It is stored inside the cell granules, so you can easily extract it by just separating the cells, by centrifuge or other methods.”
Van Loosdrecht helped develop a new photosynthesis and feeding cycle that helps such bacteria grow and produce more PHA.
Another important byproduct of wastewater is alginates. Alginates, which are typically extracted from seaweed, are used widely in the food, textile, and pharmaceutical industries. Van Loosdrecht was also part of the research that led to the Anammox reactor. Anammox, which is short for anaerobic ammonium oxidation, was a process discovered in the late 1990s that converts nitrite and ammonium — two byproducts of wastewater refinement — into nitrogen gas.
Van Loosdrecht received his masters and Ph.D. from Wageningen University, and is a member of the Netherlands Academy of Technology and Innovation, as well as the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Editor's Note: Joey Peiser is a brother of Sigma Nu
Greek Sing, Carnegie Mellon’s largest student-organized philanthropic event, took place last Saturday at Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Hall. The event raised over $90,000 for The Children’s Institute, the organization that Greek Sing has partnered with the past four years and for which they have raised over $250,000 in total. The performances ranged from self-aware comic skits to professional and precise Broadway-style productions, but all were brimming with an energy and enthusiasm that was palpable throughout the auditorium.
The evening was broken into a singles category, one Greek organization performing alone; and a doubles category, a fraternity and a sorority performing together. The singles performances were much more relaxed and fun, with the precision and professionalism of the doubles all showing teams who came to win. The singles also contained much more original content — which helped add to the fun atmosphere — with the doubles almost exclusively adapting major musicals.
Standouts from the singles category included a hilarious musical adaptation of the hit television show, Archer, titled Sterling: The Musical, which ended up taking third place in the singles category. Featuring fifth-year chemical engineering major Jason Kelso as the too-suave-for-his-own-good Archer, the production was true to the off-kilter comedic spirit of the show and was packed with hilarious punch lines and songs. 
Sigma Alpha Epsilon’s original show A Shrub’s Life, which ended up taking home second place in the singles category, was equally entertaining, with botanical puns galore and a laid-back attitude that made it clear the cast was there to have fun. The energy permeated the auditorium, leading to many missed jokes due to overwhelming laughter.
The productions of the doubles category were packed with all sorts of shiny bells and whistles. The months of work that went into Greek Sing was evident in many of these performances, with complex choreography ripped right from Broadway and intricately designed sets and costumes. 
Standouts from this category included Pi Kappa Alpha and Kappa Alpha Theta performing a Carnegie Mellon-themed adaption of the hit 1950s musical Grease, for which they won second place. The production was incredibly engaging, with great dancing, costumes, and numerous Carnegie Mellon references — such as turning the “greased lightning” car into a buggy and a set that included a painted fence saying “Spring Carnival 1959” — that the audience loved. 
The most entertaining doubles performance, and the one that was awarded first prize for the category, was Lambda Phi Epsilon and Alpha Kappa Delta Phi’s adaptation of the Disney musical Mulan. Featuring stunning costumes, a great set, energetic performances by all members of the cast, and most importantly, original jokes that were written into the script to give it the individual, fun spirit that many of the other doubles were lacking, the performance was delightful.
Greek Sing 2014 was another great installment of an event that raises an enormous amount of money for a worthy charity. It’s also a great way for many members of the Greek community to show off the talents that many wouldn’t expect them to have, such as singing and dancing or writing a great script. Hopefully next year there is a greater push for original content, for it is in these performances that the spirit of the event was its best.

“A long time ago/We used to be friends/But I haven’t thought of you lately at all.”
Never has the theme song to Veronica Mars fit so well. On March 14, after seven years of waiting, the short-lived TV series made the leap to the silver screen.
After years of movie rumors floating around, creator Rob Thomas and much of the main cast announced a Kickstarter campaign to raise $2 million — the minimum needed to make the film.
They reached that goal within 10 hours and almost tripled it in the 31 days the campaign ran. Over 91,000 people donated a total of $5.7 million to see this movie made. The question now is whether or not it is a success.
The movie picks up nine years after the series finale. Veronica (Kristen Bell) has graduated from law school and is on her way to becoming a lawyer in a prestigious New York law firm. She hasn’t worked a case since she transferred to Stanford University and left the town of Neptune, California, but that changes when pop star Bonnie DeVille (Andrea Estella) is murdered.
Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring), both Bonnie and Veronica’s ex-boyfriend, is the number one suspect. Veronica heads back to Neptune to help her former love find a lawyer, but stays to help clear his name and solve the case.
There is no doubt that this movie is a love story to the fans. Even minor characters from the series make an appearance, like friendly stoner Corny (Jonathan Chesner) and another of Veronica’s exes, Leo D’Amato (Max Greenfield).
The main characters that are present are more mature, but still have the personalities of their younger selves. Most characters’ careers aren’t really a surprise: High school basketball star Wallace Fennel (Percy Daggs III) is now a basketball coach, while computer hacker Mac (Tina Majorino) is working for a tech company.
Logan’s career, however, is a surprise and is best kept secret until you see the movie.
Jokes and references abound, from mentions of marshmallows, the affectionate nicknames for fans, to a reference to Veronica working for the FBI, a shout-out to the last-ditch effort by Thomas for a renewal.
In terms of story, though, the movie was a little weak. While it was nice to see old faces brought into the story, the sheer coincidence of all these people being connected in some way to this case is unbelievable.
The background story of Neptune’s widespread police corruption was interesting, but the inclusion of Celeste Kane (Lisa Thornhill), the mother of one of Veronica’s exes, for only a brief moment in a pivotal scene was a stretch that felt more like an excuse to have her there than actual plot development.
That being said, Veronica Mars is a wildly entertaining movie — for fans. Non-fans might find it interesting, but it’s so bogged down in show references and character history that they might find themselves completely out of the loop.
The recap at the beginning of the movie gives a good brief overview of the series as a whole, but it’s hard to encompass three seasons of mysteries into two minutes.
One of the best things about the movie, besides the fact that it’s Veronica Mars, is the usage of real-life celebrities in cameos. The show was set in southern California, but never had the clout to bring in any bigger names. The movie makes good use of the stars’ connections, with appearances by Justin Long, Bell’s husband Dax Shepard, and James Franco.
Bottom line: Fans of the series will love it. It’s everything you loved about the show: witty, smart, and heartfelt; there’s just more of it.

As of last Thursday, the eighth annual Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival is officially in full swing. Under this year’s theme of “Faces of Work,” the festival features a number of films from around the globe that all focus on workers and, often, their struggle for a better life. The festival, which began last Thursday night with a screening of the Polish film Walesa. Man of Hope and held its campus premiere on Friday with a screening of the documentary Shipbreakers, will continue through April 5. Most screenings will take place in McConomy Auditorium.
The festival’s theme is in dedication to the life and work of influential Carnegie Mellon professor Paul Goodman, who passed away due to a stroke in early 2012. At Carnegie Mellon, Goodman pushed to expand international university projects in technological and environmental research, especially in developing countries in Asia and South America. 
According to the festival’s website, Goodman was an avid filmmaker who produced over 20 documentaries demonstrating “how global development and technological expansion are changing the nature of workplace demographics and methods of production” by highlighting the “important but often overlooked work of individuals such as a nurse, a factory worker, a glass blower, a fisherman, and a women’s rowing team.” Several of his works will be screened along with other films over the course of the festival — including Shipbreakers, for which Goodman posthumously won the Best Producer of Documentary Film Award at the 2014 Madrid International Film Festival.
Opening night Thursday at the Regent Square Theater included the screening Walesa. Man of Hope, directed by Andrzej Wajda. The film tells the true story of Lech Walesa, a common shipyard electrician who becomes embroiled in the workers’ rights movement of Poland, eventually becoming the leader of the Polish trade union, Solidarity. In this position, Walesa was able to negotiate significant concessions for workers from the communist regime. Walesa was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983 for his efforts and was elected the first president of Poland following its independence in 1989. 
The world of Walesa. Man of Hope is a vivid nightmare: a Soviet-bloc country where the police beat and arrest citizens on the flimsiest suspicion and tanks roll through the streets. Indeed, when Walesa leaves home, he often hands his wife his watch and wedding band and instructs her to sell them if he doesn’t come back. Interspersed with documentary footage of the actual Polish riots and demonstrations that took place over the course of the 1970s, the film is a compelling narrative, focusing on Walesa as both an unlikely political leader — his talents for leadership coming not from books, but, as he says in the film, from ”knowledge of Poland and its people” — as well as a family man who struggles to provide for both the monetary and emotional welfare of his wife, Danuta, and their six children even when he is being paraded through the streets as a hero. Danuta Walesa was in attendance at the screening.
The film’s handling of Walesa’s private life occasionally slips into a whitewashing of the beloved figure — frequent verbal hints at the man’s dirty secrets or ill treatment of his wife are never explored — and the toll his efforts have on his family, especially Danuta, are given a very surface-level treatment. The depiction of the public Walesa, however, is where the film soars. One can’t help but feel moved watching him lead the workers’ strikes. Walesa truly was a natural-born leader, and the film perfectly captures that aspect of the man.
Before the film, Danuta Walesa gave a brief introduction of the film, in which she stated that “[the film] is more a creation of the director than a documentary ... in which you will be able to see the people struggling for their freedom.” She also addressed what was surely on everyone’s mind: the obvious relation between the political struggle in Poland depicted in the film and the current bloody revolution and ensuing political battles in another former Soviet nation, Ukraine. In a brief Q&A session after the film, Danuta Walesa fielded many questions regarding her husband’s life and legacy and how it has shaped many of the recent protests against totalitarian governments. In response to an audience member who asked if there was a moment that she realized the Solidarity movement was big, she responded that she was “only just coming to realize” how big it was.
The festival’s campus opening night on Friday featured a screening of the documentary Shipbreakers, directed by Ralph Vituccio, an instructor in the Entertainment Technology Center, and produced by Paul Goodman. The film focuses on Indian migrant workers who dismantle decommissioned ships along the beaches of Alang, highlighting the terrible conditions in which the impoverished men perform this dangerous job. A panel discussion was held afterward with Vituccio, Shipbreakers cinematographer Tom Clancey, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette assistant managing editor Mark Roth, and University of Pittsburgh professor of political science Michael Goodhart. University of Pittsburgh professor of global studies Roger Rouse served as moderator.
Keeping with the festival’s theme, Shipbreakers details an industry that requires virtually no electric power, but runs almost exclusively on manual labor. Much of the work is performed using brute force — there are many instances of a hammer and chisel being put to work against steel and iron — and the lax enforcement of workers’ rights and environmental regulations makes the occupation a virtual death sentence. While Alang is not the only site of this industry, virtually all privately-owned ships are dismantled in similar shipyards in developing countries such as Bangladesh and Pakistan.
During the panel, Vituccio said that “many workers were reluctant to talk to us” due to the risks involved with publicly denouncing the shipyards. Therefore, he said, each worker who did speak had “incredible courage” in basically putting his life on the line by speaking to “people he’d never see again.”
The stories these workers tell are harrowing, to say the least. Among tales of men being crushed to death by falling steel, many of the workers complain of the smoke they are forced to breathe due to the lack of proper masks. Workers are largely unaware of the kinds of toxins to which they are exposed — many of them have been outlawed since the 1970s, but are still present in the ships being dismantled. Interviews with workers and managers reveal a large disparity in how the situation is viewed. One shipyard manager even insisted that because there were trees growing outside his office, that meant there was no environmental problems. “Greenery means no pollution,” is how he put it. 
The conditions in Alang are contrasted with the same industry being performed in Brownsville, Texas, where Mexican migrant workers dismantle U.S. government-owned ships according to strict environmental and safety standards. A chilling visual compared the workers in India wearing a simple cloth tied around their faces while workers in Texas performed the same task wearing a complete Hazmat suit and mask. 
While the film made a good case that the practice of ship recycling should follow the strict regulations followed in the United States, Clancey pointed out in the panel that the wages paid were “high for Mexico, but are extremely low by U.S. standards.” He also mentioned that ships are only dismantled in such a highly regulated fashion in Texas because they are owned by the U.S. government and, therefore, have to be dismantled in that manner according to EPA regulations. They are forbidden from being sold to private shipyards in developing countries.
The two films featured in the opening of “Faces of Work” are signs of good things to come in the festival. One thing is certain: Both films leave one with a greater appreciation of working conditions in the United States. After witnessing men beaten to within inches of death for protesting for their right to collective bargaining, or a man working nearly 20-hour days breathing in hazardous chemicals, recent protests over the wages of McDonald’s workers certainly lose some fire. While certainly present, this effect, however, isn’t the point of “Faces of Work.” Indeed, many Americans were in similar situations during our own Industrial Revolution. As Vituccio explained in his introduction to Shipbreakers, the goal of the film was to “focus on the burden of the common worker,” whether that be a dockyard worker in China or a gas station attendant in New Jersey. The films of “Faces of Work” demonstrate the past, present, and future struggles of men and women all around the world; celebrating their successes as well as mourning the losses felt along the way. 
“Faces of Work” will be hosting screenings through April 5. More information can be found at cmu.edu/faces.

Did you know that there’s a level of Hunt library beyond the fourth floor — a world of wonder, accessible only by elevator? No, it’s not the room made out of candy in Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory; it’s the Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation.
A valued resource for the study of North American flora, the institute boasts an impressive collection of environmental art that it showcases in two exhibitions every year. This year’s spring exhibition, Duets, opened last Thursday and couples botanical art with items created between the 16th and 21st centuries.
According to assistant curator of art Carrie Roy, Duets attempts to “explore the history of botanical art through harmonious pairings.” The exhibition is organized into displays of two works of botanical art next to each other. Often, the pairs of art are of the same subject, but are different in regard to style, technique, or methods.
There is a wide variety of artwork, from pencil sketches and watercolors to different forms of photography, and this diversity keeps the gallery interesting. Albert G. Richards’s black-and-white radiograph (X-ray photograph), for example, reveals the inner architecture of a rose in full bloom and allows one to marvel at the complex nature of such a seemingly simple organism.
Beside each pairing is a description explaining why the two pieces were put together, and it is in these descriptions where the real meat and potatoes of Duets lies. Some are contrasts, others comparisons.
The subjects of the artwork range from beautiful, exotic flowers found only in the Amazon or other remote lands, to the average, everyday onion. Indeed, the pieces’ artists range as well from novices to masters. The pairing of the finely educated Raphael Henri-Charles Ghislain’s stunning watercolor of a Ranunculaceae plant with the untrained James Bolton’s soft, almost surreal watercolor of the same plant demonstrates the passion found in botanical art. Both of these men were driven by “a love of the natural world that propelled them both to hone their observational skills,” one for professional development and the other for simple pleasure.
According to Roy, Duets continues the Hunt Institute’s long history of trying to “showcase environmentally important issues.” She continued that the exhibition gives “digestible little bits of what we’re about and why this art is important.” Duets certainly provides an appreciation for the field of botanical art, and many of the pieces are truly stunning and perfect for a quick study break while in Hunt Library. Duets will be on display through June 30 on the fifth floor of the library.

Warning: This article contains spoilers for season four of Pretty Little Liars.
Last Tuesday, ABC Family aired the finale for season four of their hit television show, Pretty Little Liars. For a show with a storyline that’s been moving slowly lately, the previews for the finale set huge expectations. 
A number of the clips featured a scene with the show’s main characters brandishing a gun at the mysterious “A”, demanding this character to finally remove his or her mask and reveal “A”’s true identity. It gave the audience reason to believe that they might finally find out who “A” is, and what really happened to Ali (Sasha Pieterse). As usual, however, Ali’s “tell-all” revealed few of the answers that viewers were looking for. Though the show generated a lot of buzz, with supposedly a record-breaking number of tweets, it did not live up to expectations.
Nevertheless, viewers were given some answers in the episode; after all, it was called “A is for Answers.” To recap, the four main characters — Aria (Lucy Hale), Emily (Shay Mitchell), Hanna (Ashley Benson), and Spencer (Troian Bellisario) — met their old friend Ali, who they finally found out was alive at the end of the last season. They were also able to hold a full conversation with her, which was another first for the show. 
We learned that someone hit Ali with a rock the night that everyone thought she was killed, and thereafter she was buried alive by none other than her own mother. Ali was then pulled out of the ground by creepy Mrs. Grunwald (Meg Foster) and was convinced by Mona (Janel Parrish) to leave town and fake her own death. Meanwhile, another girl was buried in Ali’s grave and falsely identified as Ali — a girl who was actually killed by Melissa (Torrey DeVitto), Spencer’s sister. It was somewhat unclear how that girl was killed, and why she was identified as Ali. Adding to the drama, though somewhat unnecessarily, “A” shot Ezra (CMU alumni Ian Harding).
The show’s writers continued the show’s habit of generating more questions for whatever answers were given. One question that the show will definitely focus on in the upcoming season, premiering June 10, is why Ali’s mother was willing to bury her daughter. Who tried to kill Ali, and why is the would-be killer’s identity important enough for Ali’s mother to keep silent?
As for Ezra, most people know or expect that he will still be alive in the next season, especially since there are a lot of questions that he needs to answer. According to an interview, Harding revealed that there would be a love triangle between Aria, Ali, and Ezra next season. I predict that it will end well for “Ezria” fans, but no one can know for sure.
Other questions include the role that each character has in this show. Obviously the main characters have a purpose, but was CeCe Drake (Vanessa Ray) just placed on the show as a distraction or was she somehow involved? And what about Jason (Drew Van Acker), Wren (Julian Morris), and other random characters? It seems as though there were several storylines that started in the show, but then did not lead anywhere and had to come to a halt. It would be nice to see them attended to next season.
Despite the episode’s flaws, there were some positives as well, including the fashion seen on the show. While Pretty Little Liars is known for the fashionable outfits put together for each character by costume designer Mandi Line, sometimes the outfits can be hit-or-miss. This episode, however, did not disappoint, with the exception being Spencer’s weird sweater.
This episode began with the same scene in which the penultimate episode ended. It was difficult to really see what each character was wearing, but most noticeable were Aria’s colorful scarf, Hanna’s patterned leather jacket, Emily’s leather jacket, and Spencer’s cutout turtleneck sweater (even the name doesn’t sound appealing). A few scenes later, Ali’s white  sequined top — another fashion standout from this episode — appeared when she went to the bar to meet Ezra.
The weirdest part of this episode — and the one that’ll probably lead to the most questions — is the scene where Ali’s mother is seen being buried in a grave while still alive. It’s obviously connected to the way Ali “died,” but still confusing, since Ali’s mother basically helped to kill Ali. Judging by the lack of answers given in this episode, we’ll only have to wait a few more hundred episodes before we finally find out who “A” is.

Directed by the legendary Wes Anderson — whose works include Moonrise Kingdom, The Darjeeling Limited, and The Royal Tenenbaums — The Grand Budapest Hotel is a whimsical whirlwind through the adventuresome life of a concierge and his lobby boy. 
The movie is a bright and colorful spectacle set against the backdrop of Europe during the World Wars, which ensures an interesting and compelling duality to the film and the story. 
The outrageous and sometimes hilarious plot is driven by its strong main characters, played by a cast that is fairly typical of a Wes Anderson film: Gustave H (Ralph Fiennes), the concierge; Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori), his lobby boy; and a slew of eclectic and eccentric guests of the hotel, including characters played by Adrien Brody, Jude Law, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, and Tilda Swinton. 
The plot follows Gustave H, his role as the main concierge at the Grand Budapest Hotel — located in the fictional Republic of Zubrowka — and his journey to determine his innocence in the unfortunately-timed death of an elderly ex-lover, Madame D (Swinton). 
When it is discovered that Madame D has left Gustave a valuable painting, her family has Gustave imprisoned for her murder. Zero must help him first escape, and then travel to a monastery to prove his innocence, all while being trailed by an assassin (Willem Dafoe).
Though the.3 film ends somewhat sadly and rather abruptly, the sense of whimsy and wonder is maintained through the colorful sets, costumes, and the fantastic acting. 
The star-studded cast serves as an added attraction rather than a support to carry the film, and Revolori manages to make his major big-screen debut stand out even against the talented big names that accompany his performance. 
There is a particular brand of humor from which much of the film draws its charm, evocative of an absurd 1930s madcap stage comedy. It’s vintage, but a vintage that is so quirky that it feels as if it could be set in a parallel universe. 
Anderson’s writing and production talent marries perfectly with the absurd storylines that he borrows from writer Stefan Zweig’s novels Beware of Pity and The Post-Office Girl.
The film contains many nods to Zweig’s writing and even Zweig himself in the character The Author, played in the film’s present by Tom Wilkinson and in flashbacks by Law. 
Physical humor, ridiculous situations, and just enough drama without going completely overboard are the perfect blend for this cast and Anderson’s signature style. 
It’s hard to pinpoint exactly what it is about Anderson’s films that is so enjoyable for audiences — most of them become huge box office successes, despite limited releases. They’re quirky, unusual, and fun — but above all, they’re the ultimate escapist opportunity. 
The Grand Budapest Hotel is no exception: The colorful cast of characters, rollercoaster plot line, and unusual narrative structure and setup are sure to not only captivate viewers, but also take them along for a magical journey. 
The movie will show at The Manor Theatre in Squirrel Hill through Wednesday.

Dear Ryan and Matt,
My boyfriend is very outgoing, and he seems to know everybody. We can’t go anywhere without running into someone that was on his floor his first year or who dated his best friend. When we get meals together, I expect them to be quiet, but they turn into social experiences that I don’t want to be a part of. How do I tell his friends that he’s with me right now, and can come play later?
Sincerely, 
Mingling Yeoman, Toddles Intimate Meaning-making Excursions
Dear MY-TIME,
It’s nice to be with someone who knows everybody, but we understand your predicament. You might try talking to your boyfriend and letting him know that when you two are together, you expect it to be the two of you — together. You can also take the initiative to turn down requests to join his friends yourself, saying things like “We’d be happy to join you another time.”
If that doesn’t work, you might have to resort to scare tactics. Make mention of discussing things couples need privacy for — like a breakup or an unexpected pregnancy.
Have you tried staying in?
Matt and Ryan
Dear Matt and Ryan,
Ugghhhhh it’s after spring break and I have no motivation to do any work. I just want to go back to the carefree days that last week provided. Why can’t I go back? Why do I have to work again? I’m feeling so listless and apathetic right now I don’t even think I can fin—
Dear … um … Sir or Madam,
The first week back from spring break is always the worst. It’s not like the first week of school, when professors expect nothing and homeworks amount to nothing more than “read the syllabus.” But when you get back from break, it’s more like, “Hope you’ve been hitting the books this past week, because here’s three assignments and an exam — good luck.” So, you have two options now, assuming you haven’t done any work at all this week. Hit the ground running next week, picking up the slack and getting on top of everything you should have done last week. Or, continue to be as apathetic as you want. But seriously — get your butt in gear. No one’s saying you have to be productive all the time right now, and taking a break now and again is healthy. 
If life were like spring break forever, it wouldn’t feel like spring break. And we’d all probably be dead,
Ryan and Matt

The Wolf of Wall Street
Thursday, March 27 — 10:30
Saturday, March 29 — 10:30
Martin Scorsese returns to make a ferocious film about real-life figure Jordan Belfort and his life chock-full of debauchery and corruption while heading his brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont. Warning: This movie isn’t for the faint of heart. Think of Frozen — and then imagine the exact opposite of that. Leonardo DiCaprio gives the performance of a lifetime as a hysterically arrogant Belfort who is on top of the world with his millions, his gorgeous trophy wife, and his endless supply of drugs. Despite the movie’s raunchiness, Scorsese and DiCaprio’s collaboration provide a fierce rush of energy and comedy that places it among the best films of the year.
Saving Mr. Banks
Sunday, March 30
2
We can all recall our childhoods being filled with memories of Disney films — but most of us don’t know the struggle to bring those films to the screen. After Walt Disney’s (Tom Hanks) daughters beg him to make an adaptation of P.L. Travers’s (Emma Thompson) “Mary Poppins,” he agrees to uphold his promise. When Disney reaches out to Travers, she is more than reluctant about selling her work into the moneymaking machine of Hollywood. Her stubbornness nearly derails the project and causes the production to stretch into 20 arduous years. Saving Mr. Banks is a captivating story that sheds light on the passion that both Disney and Travers had about the story of a magical nanny that they both wanted to share — although in completely different ways.

After much anticipation, AB Concerts announced on Wednesday at 11:59 p.m. this year’s Spring Carnival concert performers: Icona Pop and Mac Miller. Icona Pop is a Swedish DJ duo with an emphasis on electro house and indie pop. The duo gained attention in the United States for their song “I Love It” in 2012. Mac Miller, a rapper and Pittsburgh native, is most popular for his song “Party on Fifth Ave.”
Icona Pop and Mac Miller come on the heels of Lupe Fiasco, who performed at last year’s Spring Carnival, and Passion Pit, who performed at the 2012 Spring Carnival.
AB Concerts co-chairs junior computer science major Rebecca Paren and senior human-computer interaction and business administration double major Ronny Ho explained their selection, saying that because it’s so difficult to please the campus as whole, they liked the idea of selecting two distinct artists to appeal to a wider audience.
The selection process started with a collective brainstorming session, Ho said. “Literally on a chalk board — everyone just name-drops artists and bands,” Ho described.
From there, it came down to questions of scheduling, cost, and campus appeal. Ho and Paren noted that it can be difficult to get top artists for Spring Carnival, because it usually coincides with the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in California. The members of AB Concerts also usually avoid country music, because they doubt that it will appeal to a large segment of the student body. 
Beyond that, Paren and Ho said, the co-chairs are open to anything, although the university prefers that they stay away from artists that encourage marijuana use.
Paren and Ho are excited for Mac Miller; they both liked the idea of featuring an artist from the Pittsburgh area for the 100th Spring Carnival. They are also excited to host an up-and-coming foreign group like Icona Pop.
The student body’s reaction is mixed. Icona Pop has generally garnered more excitement than Mac Miller. First-year mechanical engineering and engineering and public policy double major TJ Murray explained, “I am excited for Icona Pop because they take me back to the glory days — and nights — summer.”
Saumya Dalal, a junior computer science major, said that this year’s artists are a marked improvement over previous years. “I think it’s a good choice,” she said. “It’s definitely better than last year’s concert, or the year before.”
Sentiments about Mac Miller seem more negative than sentiments about Icona Pop. 
“The first thing I thought when I found out Mac Miller [was coming] was ‘LOL,’ and then how he seems like the kind of artist that wouldn’t want to perform at CMU,” said first-year fine arts major Joni Sullivan.
The co-chairs explained that the AB Concerts board always expects mixed feelings about their decisions.
“We want the student body to understand we aren’t choosing people we love.” Paren said, “Our musical interests do not influence who we pick. We want to do what’s best for the campus with the money and timing we have.”
The concert will take place on Friday, April 11 at 8 p.m. on the Mall or, if there are bad weather conditions, in Wiegand Gymnasium. 
The concert on the Mall will be open to the public. Students will not be required to get tickets unless the concert is moved indoors, where space is limited.

Dominic Akerele and Rohan Saigal 
Junior chemistry major Dominic Akerele is running for student body president (SBP) with junior electrical and computer engineering major Rohan Saigal as student body vice president (SBVP) on a platform of increasing student engagement, making the printing system on campus more effective, creating a campus homepage specifically for students, and improving students’ general health.
Akerele and Saigal want to generally improve student life at Carnegie Mellon. “This is a prestigious university — academically very stressful — so I think it’s the job of the student body [vice president] to distract everyone from that life, so you can get out of here with a good degree, a good job, and on track for your life, but at the same time make this the best four years possible, not just during the four days of Spring Carnival,” Saigal said.
Akerele said that a major goal of his and Saigal’s campaign is to revamp Carnegie Mellon school spirit. “We would like to build in [a spirit-raising week], especially into the fall, because primarily I feel students only have one major thing that they look forward to, which is Spring Carnival, but I feel the fall is kind of lacking something,” Akerele said. “We’d have a week designated where we’d amp up students, have activities going on, free food. And it all culminates in one final day, maybe the Friday leading up to midsemester break, where the students have a day off, where we all get together as a campus. I’d like to have Dr. Suresh give a speech, as well. I would also like to build the bond between the president and the student body … I’d like to see a recurring speech to engage students.”
Reforming printing will also be a focus of the campaign. Akerele and Saigal want to improve printing by either reforming the maintenance policies on the printers, or establishing more printing centers both on campus and off, in locations such as Doherty Apartments, Fairfax, or even Beeler Street. The running mates also want to create a student-oriented homepage, as the current Carnegie Mellon website is more oriented toward prospective students and parents. The proposed homepage would have a link to Carnegie Mellon’s Blackboard and show what extracurricular activities were going on around campus. The final element of their campaign platform is improving student health. “When we all leave CMU, obviously our career is very important, but everyone’s number one priority should be staying alive and living and [being as] healthy as possible. We don’t promote that enough. Being healthy correlates directly with happiness,” Saigal said. “We want to make better maintenance of the Skibo Gym — better weights, more fans, more air flow. It looks like a prison cell sometimes; maybe paint it up. They are extending the UC in two years, but that’s two years, not now.”
Akerele is a COMPASS Mentor, which is a peer-mentoring program that benefits first-year minority students in science and math. He is also a brother of Pi Kappa Alpha, an RA in Doherty, and a member of the Committee on Student Organizations (CoSO). Saigal is a member of Carnegie Mellon’s Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, the treasurer of Pi Kappa Alpha, and an avid Carnegie Mellon basketball fan.
Fun Facts: 
Akerele is developing his own street-wear brand and watercolor paints.
Saigal’s father taught at Carnegie Mellon when he was a child, and he used to play in Baker and Porter Hall all the time.
Ian Glasner and Shalini Ray 
Junior electrical and computer engineering and business administration double major Ian Glasner and junior biological sciences major Shalini Ray are running for student body president (SBP) and student body vice president (SBVP) on a platform of improving student policies, restructuring dining plans, and improving campus unity. Two notable reforms include restructuring the current dorm alcohol policy, and remodeling Faculty Course Evaluations (FCEs). As of now, Carnegie Mellon’s policy is that if underage drinking is reported or discovered on campus or in campus housing, police respond and cite the students involved. Those students then go before the Pennsylvania Magistrate and get a state citation from government of Pennsylvania. All eight Ivy Leagues, many private universities, and the University of Pittsburgh all have an internal system, in which an RA writes the student involved up for underage drinking, and the student goes through an internal disciplinary process. There is no official citation. As Glasner put it, “It goes on your permanent record for school, not your permanent record for your life.”
Another notable reform would be reforming the current process of FCEs. Student Senate is currently trying to reform the system, and Glasner and Ray would continue those efforts. “If you drop a class in the first three weeks because the professor was awful, you don’t participate in FCEs. That’s a huge, huge, gap,” Glasner said.
Most of Glasner and Ray’s platform centers on increasing student input. “Students need to be involved, and if students were involved, they wouldn’t miss stuff like this,” Glasner continued. “It’s not like they should have seen it, it’s just that students need to be in the room when policy is created. Students are the customers on this campus, we’re where all the money comes from, and it’s unfair to us to leave us out of the discussion.”
Both Glasner and Ray expressed their commitment to improving student life. “It would be a huge honor because being SBVP means that my peers trust my decisions and value (my) judgment and it places me in a position where I can make a tangible effect on student life on campus,” Ray said via email.
Glasner is the Community Advisor (CA) at the Residence on Fifth, and will be the CA for Resnik and West Wing next year. He is a co-founder of CMU in Haiti, as well as a brother of Sigma Alpha Epsilon.
Ray is a member of Carnegie Mellon’s bhangra team, the social chair for the Lunar Gala fashion show, a sister of Kappa Alpha Theta, a Student Senator and the vice chair of Student Senate. She is also a kickoff committee member of 1000 Plus, a show board member of Mayur SASA, a member of Bhangra in the Burgh, OM, Doctors of Carnegie Society, Bio Student Advisor Council, Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers, Minority Association of Pre-Health Students, and a Group-X fitness instructor.
Fun Facts:
Glasner has been to Haiti three times.
Even though she is from Baltimore, Ray is a die-hard Steelers fan.

While many Carnegie Mellon students traveled to the Caribbean over spring break in search of beaches, concerts, and frozen margaritas, 10 Carnegie Mellon students made their first trip to Haiti with a more service-oriented goal.
CMU in Haiti, the nascent student organization that sponsored the trip, raised $6,000 for various charities in Haiti — one of the world’s poorest countries — which they distributed during their visit. They supported Society of Providence United for the Economic Development of Pétion-Villois (SOPUDEP), a Haitian grassroots organization which runs a school, a microfinance program called Fam SOPUDEP an Aksyon (FASA), and a group to empower women called Mouvements des Jeunes Unis pour le Développement des Bobin, Pétion-Villois (MOJUB).
This trip is CMU in Haiti’s first to the country; co-founders electrical and computer engineering and business administration double major Ian Glasner and professional writing major Laura Scherb founded the organization in 2013 as an effort to not only take an annual spring break trip, but also to establish and maintain a relationship with their counterparts in Haiti. Glasner was inspired by his high school experience at Los Altos High School in Los Altos, Calif., where he was a member of the outreach and philanthropy organization Solidarity in Haiti. Los Altos High School recently became an official sister school of SOPUDEP after Solidarity in Haiti’s annual trips to Haiti connected the two schools.
Glasner hopes that CMU in Haiti will stand out among the myriad of other student organizations that take spring break trips to impoverished countries or domestic places in need, including Global Medical Brigades (GMB) and Global Public Health Brigades (GPHB), which both traveled to Honduras this year; Orphanage Outreach, which traveled to the Dominican Republic; and Habitat for Humanity, which traveled to Macon, Ga.
All of these organizations do service work, from providing medication and public health infrastructure in the case of GMB and GPHB, respectively, to building homes for those in need, like Habitat for Humanity, or volunteering at orphanages like Orphanage Outreach. 
CMU in Haiti also focuses on service, with additional goals that involve forming relationships with the Haitian people the students interact with and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) like SOPUDEP.
Glasner and Scherb hope to establish a similar relationship between Carnegie Mellon and the Haitian organizations they worked with this past spring break. CMU in Haiti, Glasner said, is distinguished not by the service they do — although it is an important part of their initiative — but by the connections they are making with Haitian organizations and Haitian citizens.
“It was an incredible trip,” said Connie Yang, a first-year mathematical sciences major. “I went in knowing only some facts from the newspapers, like the level of poverty [in Haiti]. But there I learned about the people — they were so nice and genuine.”
Glasner said that their work is as much about helping Haitians as it is about teaching students at Carnegie Mellon. “Its about creating lifelong philanthropists — people who will be more knowledgeable,” said Glasner, who is also currently student body vice president. Glasner has himself shown long-term dedication to Haiti; he has now traveled on three similar charitable trips to the nation.
CMU in Haiti emerged from “The Uses and Abuses of Haiti,” a seminar taught by Michael West, a professor in the department of modern languages at Carnegie Mellon. 
Glasner raised money for Haiti in high school with the Haiti Solidarity Club and spoke in the seminar about his experiences. 
Together with Scherb, he launched the club to address the urgent needs about which they had learned.
The club has three main purposes: first, to raise money before the trip; this fundraising directly benefits the schools and organizations in Haiti; second, for the students to learn about Haitian culture and ways of life during the trip and forge connections with the Haitian people; and third, for the students to raise awareness about Haiti after the trip.
According to Yang, many of the NGOs working in Haiti suffer from the same types of corruption which have effectively crippled the Haitian government. To avoid this corruption, CMU in Haiti partnered with Rea Dol, a woman who has received international recognition for her grassroots efforts within Haiti. 
Dol founded SOPUDEP in the 1990s to help some of Haiti’s most impoverished residents through a number of ancillary organizations such as the SOPUDEP school and FASA; the need for her programs has intensified since a 2010 earthquake devastated much of Haiti.
The students visited a refugee camp that continues to house Haitians affected by the earthquake. 
“The leader of the refugee camp gave an impassioned speech ‘that the people of Haiti do not want to be given fish. They want to learn to fish.’ Their spirit, given those bad conditions ... is really amazing,” said Yang.

In 2004, Carnegie Mellon opened a branch in Education City, a region of educational facilities on the outskirts of Doha, the capital of Qatar. Last Tuesday, the university celebrated the tenth anniversary of the CMU Qatar campus with an hour-long ceremony featuring key leadership from both campuses, as well as alumni, faculty, students, and distinguished international guests.
When Carnegie Mellon opened its Education City campus in 2004, it began by teaching only 41 students in two academic programs. Now it offers five programs, including biological sciences, business administration, computational biology, computer science, and information systems to over 400 students.
CMU Qatar has graduated over 300 students in its decade of education, all of whom have enrolled in top graduate programs or been sought out by the world’s leading companies.
Mark Kamlet, provost and executive vice president of Carnegie Mellon, spoke on behalf of Ilker Baybars, the dean of the CMU Qatar campus, at the ceremony in Doha on Tuesday.
“I will say — and the students know — that the Carnegie Mellon curriculum in Qatar is every bit as rigorous, as challenging, as thorough, and as demanding as in Pittsburgh. I also want to say that the students here have done extraordinarily well. And I mean not only academically but as ethical, bright, hardworking, and humane leaders,” Kamlet said. “Indeed we are here helping to create the next generation of leaders, entrepreneurs, thinkers, and problem solvers.”
CMU Qatar has received much recognition from the international community. One measure of this recognition, a university press release notes, is the many high-profile visitors that the university’s campus in Qatar has hosted, including Bill Gates, Hillary Clinton, and former U.S. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu.
University president Subra Suresh said that the success of CMU’s Qatar campus is a hallmark of Carnegie Mellon’s leadership in the field of higher education.
“Higher education and governments are awakening the need for greater educational opportunity, and many are taking action. But I can think of no other nation that has responded as vigorously and imaginatively as has Qatar,” Suresh said in a university press release. “The story of Education City has been a powerful example for the entire world, and the world has taken notice of this success.”
The tenth anniversary celebration comes on the heels of the annual Initiating Meaningful Pittsburgh and Qatar Ties (IMPAQT) program, which sends Carnegie Mellon students from Pittsburgh to Qatar every Spring Break.
IMPAQT, according to its website, began in 2008 as part of a fifth-year scholar initiative. The program is meant “to develop strategies and initiatives to best leverage the relationship between the two campuses toward enhancing student life and the student experience on both.”
Gail Wilson, a sophomore computer science major who recently returned from IMPAQT, said that CMU Qatar is an important way to expand Carnegie Mellon’s international name. “Carnegie Mellon is getting on a much more international level, which is really, really cool. But also they’re starting anew there, in a way,” Wilson said.
“The dynamic between the two campuses is really interesting — they’re still Carnegie Mellon students, they’re still just as passionate, all that stuff,” Wilson continued. “But the campus is so small they’re also like a huge family there. Especially for us visiting, everyone knew us, everyone was saying hi to us, introducing us to friends. It was really, really cool.”
Students who participated in IMPAQT each came up with a project to bridge the two campuses. 
Wilson planned to have students from both campuses answer questions to see the differences and similarities between the cultures of the two branches.
Wilson, however, said that her project evolved along with the rest of the group’s. “When we got there we decided, though — although a lot of us are keeping the same projects — but a lot of us are focusing on getting people at Carnegie Mellon Pittsburgh to know more about the Qatar campus.”

The second installment of “The First Lectures” was held on Thursday, March 20 at 8 p.m. The idea for the lecture series came from Vaasavi Unnava, a first-year economics and statistics double major. The title “First Lectures” alludes to former computer science and human-computer interaction and design professor Randy Pausch’s The Last Lecture, which he gave in McConomy Auditorium after being diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer in 2006.
In a previous interview, Unnava said she was particularly struck by the line, “It’s not about how to achieve your dreams, it’s about how to lead your life.”
In his last lecture — and in the book it inspired which Pausch co-authored — Pausch discussed his journey through life and the notion of “achieving your childhood dreams.” According to the Facebook event page for “The First Lectures,” “Each lecture is individualized and meant to tell the story of a senior, through good and bad, and is a reflection on the past four years at Carnegie Mellon, and how his or her school and peers have impacted them.”
The two speakers at last Thursday’s event were senior acting major Thomas Constantine Moore and senior business administration major Stephen Serrao.
Moore discussed the importance of focus while at Carnegie Mellon. He spoke about how difficult it can be that so many actors are competing for a limited amount of roles. According to the U.S. Department of Education, over 90,000 bachelor’s degrees in visual and performing arts were awarded in 2011 alone.
Moore noted, however, how the university provides its students with many opportunities. “CMU sets people up,” Moore said. “CMU gives its students a competitive edge like none other. Students arrive with a passion and leave with understanding, skill, and connections.”
At times, Moore said, the workload made him feel like he was drowning. “Most of the time,” he said, “drowning us is this school’s way of teaching us how to swim.” Specifically, Moore talked about his experience in 15-112: Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science. 
Moore said that although it was the class at Carnegie Mellon he had to work hardest in, he enjoyed it so much that he became a teaching assistant for it.
Moore soon found that he couldn’t continue being a TA when he began his junior year. “Junior year, you’re in four shows, which means you can expect to be in rehearsal or performance six days a week, 12 weeks out of each semester,” Moore said. “One of the traits I think CMU people share, in general, is an absolute abhorrence for admitting defeat. But a big part of learning to focus is learning how to recognize when something is happening in your life that you really can’t afford.”
Moore maintained, however, that he had no regrets. “I’m still glad I did it. I’m glad I tried it. Even though I was drowning, it was the sort of drowning that builds character, I think.”
Moore thinks that the best way to find success at Carnegie Mellon is to focus on one area you excel in, having a sense of incredible focus, and through the encouragement of adventurism. 
He also talked about some of the diverse and exciting events he has been involved with as a senior. “This year I’ve also choreographed a dance piece for the first time, written and performed my own one-man show for Playground, successfully mounted an ongoing web comic, and begun to professionally design websites for actors in my program.”
Serrao, a senior business administration major, questioned the definition of learning. He proposed a new definition: significant learning. Significant learning, Serrao said, calls for learning both inside and outside the classroom while creating a web of insight, what he described as a "complex variant of learning that challenges how you think, behave, and reason"
Serrao had three lessons for students at the school, urging them to “strive for excellence, put people first in everything you do, and to embrace vulnerability.” According to Serrao, following these three guidelines is the key to success. “Once you get these three points, you’d be on your own path to learning,” he said.
Regarding his first point, Serrao said that it was important to maintain excellent company: “whether you’re in or out, and whether you’re surrounded by the right people.”
Speaking to his second point, Serrao admitted that “initially I thought of my success before [that of others], but it just didn’t work. I made it a [priority] to surround myself with excellent and successful people.... Put people — not just yourself — first and success will follow you.” 
"I learned that everything of meaning and importance carries with it a level of risk," Serrao said when expanding his third point. "Embracing that risk, uncertainty, and often discomfort — namely vulnerability — will allow you to question, learn, and grow meaningfully."
According to Serrao, it’s important to start realizing success is not just about an individual, but also includes the people surrounding that individual.
Serrao also thought it was important to embrace vulnerability. “Being vulnerable is being alive, and is when you’re allowed to grow the most,” Serrao said. “To be able to grow as a person, you need to embrace risk and face its values. It’s important to be aware, because it is the first step toward pesonal growth.”

Trevor Hadick 
First-year chemical engineering and engineering and public policy double major Trevor Hadick is running for student body vice president for organizations (SBVPO) on a platform of improving communication between organizations and the Committee on Student Organizations (CoSO), as well as increasing collaborations between organizations and making space allocations more efficient. Hadick also hopes to reform the current student government elections process by having two election periods: one in the spring to elect the SBVPO, and then another in the fall to elect members of the Committee on Student Organizations.
“This position has been underutilized and underdeveloped; however, I plan on going above and beyond the defined duties of the position,” Hadick wrote in an email. 
“I want organizations to see me as a resource, even beyond recognition/re-recognition and space allocations. My goal is to be their ally by helping connect them to the important resources here on campus, assisting organization’s transition to new leaders, and advocating for their thoughts and opinions.”
According to his platform, Hadick plans to increase communication throughout the various organizations and branches of student government, but he also wants to ensure the retention of institutional knowledge. 
Though he is new to student government as a first-year student, he has spoken extensively with more senior members to better understand the process. Hadick feels that his relative inexperience could prove to be an asset. “I hope to bring a new perspective and fresh twist to the current procedures of the student body government.... I know that along the way there are going to be times when tough decisions need to be made, even if they are going to upset students. However, I must do what is in the best interest of the student body and organizations as a whole,” Hadick wrote.
Hadick is vice president of the First-Year Advisory Board for the Carnegie Institute of Technology (CIT). The board acts as the voice of first-year students in CIT and communicates with the administration, staff, and faculty. 
He is also a member of the men’s club soccer team and a member of Engineers Without Borders (EWB). Next year, he will be a member of the International Project Planning Committee of EWB, as well as an RA in Mudge House.
Fun Fact: 
At the age of 14, Hadick became a U.S. Soccer Federation Referee. Now, going into his fifth summer as a referee, he will be promoted to a grade seven referee, which will allow him to referee soccer games across the continental U.S. 
Jackson Michalak 
Sophomore computer science and math double major Jackson Michalak is running for student body vice president for organizations (SBVPO) on a platform of reforming the room registration system and mature organizations re-recognition system, as well as giving organizations more help and support in recruiting. 
Michalak said that the position of SBVPO involves representing students, but that the point of the position is to represent organizations themselves. He said that these roles overlap.
Michalak said he would reform the room reservation system, which student organizations use to reserve space for meetings and various activities. “I think it’s horrible to deal with,” Michalak said.
Michalak also wants to streamline the system of creating new organizations on campus. “I think there needs to be a clearer set of expectations for what is required for a new organization,” Michalak said. “For CoSO, I’ve been acting as the chair of new recognition, so I’m responsible for interacting with the new prospective organizations, to a large extent, to make sure their constitution is up to expectation and makes sense, and make sure that the structure that they’re trying to build will be stable.”
Part of the problem, Michalak said, is that there is no clear list of what the expectations of a new organization are. “If you go to the university’s website now, you go to the CoSO page — some of the information is out of date; it’s sort of ambiguous as to what the expectations are for a new organization. I do meet with an organization to help them with their constitution, [but] there are many things missing. There’s ideas that they didn’t realize were required, or weren’t required, and there’s all these sets of assumptions that don’t match up. So I think it would be nice to have one place where all of that would be clear.”
Another important area that some student organizations need help with is recruitment and general advice, according to Michalak. CoSO reaches out to support struggling organizations, and simply lacking membership is a very common problem. More generally, sometimes organizations need advice on how to improve day-to-day operations or special problems. “I think it would be good to have a better outlet for advice on these things with an organization,” Michalak said. “It’s a definite problem that should be addressed, and can be addressed reasonably.”
Michalak is a member of the Plaid Parliament of Pwning (PPP), Carnegie Mellon’s computer security club. He is also the chair of new recognition of the Committee on Student Organizations, as well as a regular observer of the University Center Allocation Board (UCAB). Michalak began attending meetings when he decided to run for SBVPO.
Fun Fact:
Michalak speaks Polish fluently.
Paul Kioko could not be reached for comment.

Elena Karras
Junior chemical engineering major Elena Karras is running for student body vice president for finance (SBVPF) on a platform of creating more transparency in the funding process. Karras said she aims to create transparency through open metric meetings, office hours, and better-educated JFC representatives.
Karras said she would like to host an open metric meeting at the beginning of the year so that organizations can voice their opinions about what metrics the JFC should use to fund organizations, and to answer questions about the metrics. Typical metrics include travel, food, and lodging, among others. “It’s sort of a way to hear the voices of the people who are involved in the process,” Karras said about the potential meeting.
To keep lines of communication open between the SBVPF and student organizations, Karras’s platform includes expanding the office hours that current SBVPF Jalen Poteat held this academic year. 
Karras said she would hold the office hours all year, with increased hours during the budget submission period. “I also want to make sure that [organizations] feel comfortable coming to me with any questions that they have,” Karras said. According to Karras, organizations are often unaware of all of their options for funding, what they can do with their money, and the funding process itself.
Karras said she would release JFC applications during the summer and choose representatives at the beginning of the academic year in order to train them extensively on the entire budget process. 
“It’s really important to choose [representatives] early and make sure they’re clear on what the funding avenues are — not just the JFC process — but the funding process as a whole,” Karras said. She wants representatives to be comprehensive resources for their organizations.
According to her platform, Karras would also strengthen collaboration with the student body vice president for organizations (SBVPO) to ensure that she and the SBVPO are both in agreement “in terms of where organizations are and what organizations need.”
Karras has been a member of Student Senate and the JFC for two semesters, where she has guided organizations through the funding process as a representative. She has gone through the funding process as the treasurer for College Democrats too. She is also a part of the Internal Development Committee, which educates Senators about recent happenings and brings them together as a cohesive body, according to Karras.
Karras is a lighting tech area head for Scotch’n’Soda, vice president of membership development and programming for Panhellenic, a sister of Alpha Chi Omega, president of College Democrats, and a general member of AB Tech, Spring Carnival Committee, and Carnegie Tech Radio Club.
Karras took an unusual road to becoming involved in Student Senate. 
She was originally a write-in candidate for the Carnegie Institute of Technology after her friends voted for her. 
A write-in candidate is not printed on the ballot, but can be handwritten onto it by voters. 
“I stuck with it because I realized it was something that I thought was very important because you need people who are passionate about serving our campus and who care that ... all organizations are being served to the best of their ability,” Karras said.
Fun Facts: 
Karras can solve a Rubik’s cube in under two minutes.
Karras has beaten Doge2048.
Matthew Greenberg 
Junior economics major Matthew Greenberg is running for student body vice president for finance (SBVPF) on a platform of making the budgeting process more efficient through a two-step plan.
As SBVPF, Greenberg would first implement a key performance indicator (KPI) to evaluate the impact that an organization has on the campus community, according to his platform. 
Greenberg said the KPI would be indicative of the organization’s performance during the current and previous academic year. 
At present, organizations are evaluated by the JFC during the budgeting process mainly by their performance in the previous academic year and the word of organization members.
“The biggest problem with the funding committee as of right now is that you can’t judge an organization on what they’re doing this year and how they’re improving or not improving,” Greenberg said.
Greenberg said he would require JFC representatives to go to the biggest events — and possibly a few minor ones — for organizations that they represent, in order to more directly see the impact the organizations have on the campus during the current year.
Greenberg is also proposing to reform the JFC representative selection process so there are two selection periods — one in the spring and one in the fall. 
According to his platform, Greenberg would establish an early-decision type process to choose JFC representatives. 
During the spring, “[Representatives] who have a good reputation and who didn’t do a bad job would have the option to retake their seat the next year,” Greenberg said. Students who were not previously representatives would also be able to apply for positions at the same time, according to Greenberg.
If positions remained open after the spring selection, Greenberg said there would be a fall selection similar to the selection that occurs now. “That way the best [representatives] will still be there, will be trained, and will have the ability to use this KPI to judge performance and to judge impact of the organizations and ... be able to teach the new [representatives] how to do that,” Greenberg said.
Greenberg is the CEO of his own company, Greenberg & Bao Portfolio Strategies, LLC, which identifies market inefficiencies. 
He is a brother of Pi Kappa Alpha and was the chair of the fourth annual Matthew Tembo Memorial Soccer Tournament. According to a university news release, Pi Kappa Alpha hosts this soccer tournament each year to be “a positive force in the prevention, treatment, education, and research of substance abuse and alcoholism.” Greenberg is also a member of the Undergraduate Finance Association.
When asked what he hopes to accomplish for himself through the position, Greenberg said, “I think it will help me to fine-tune my skills both as a CEO and just generally dealing with money on a daily basis.” 
He said that the position would also give him good experience in leading a group of people to develop an efficient budget. Greenberg stressed the influence that the SBVPF has to improve student life. 
“Especially at a school where everyone’s working so hard, it’s important that you get the best quality of life that you can have here ... and the VPF certainly has the ability to impact that,” Greenberg said.
Fun Facts: 
Greenberg been to 18 different countries and all five Disney theme parks, and was in Spain for the World Cup when they won in 2010. 
Greenberg is also a die-hard fan of New York sports teams, especially the Rangers and the Yankees. 
Divya Kothandapani 
Sophomore electrical and computer engineering major Divya Kothandapani is running for student body vice president for finance (SBVPF) on a platform of improving the transparency of the JFC and the advising resources for student organizations.
Kothandapani wrote in an email, “I would like to make [organizations] more aware of the SBVPF and make myself approachable so [organizations] can contact me any time throughout the year if they are confused with how campus finances work and need advice to be successful.”
Kothandapani wrote that the JFC currently only meets at the end of the academic year to determine what the following academic year’s budget will be, but that organizations must manage their budgets themselves throughout the year. 
She wrote that a lack of financial advising resources causes confusion and is a source of debt for many organizations.
She wrote that she would work to engage JFC representatives with organizations to familiarize them with the budgeting process and to understand why certain decisions are made. “The JFC exists to support [organizations] and it wants to help your [organization] succeed,” Kothandapani wrote. 
“I want to create a better, ‘friendlier’ image for this committee so the students are more comfortable and understand the importance of the resources it can provide.” Kothandapani hopes to work closely with the SBVPO to more actively help organizations with fundraising, ideas, support, and promotion.
When asked what she hopes to accomplish for herself in the position, Kothandapani wrote, “By helping [organizations] with something as important as finances, I would be proud of myself for reaching out to help them achieve their success and improving our student activities would make me even more excited to come to school everyday and be a part of this community.”
She wrote that she hopes ot reach the student body even further as SBVPF to help a larger group — over 200 student organizations — to succeed. Kothandapani joined Student Senate during her first year at Carnegie Mellon as a member at large, and later, a CIT senator. 
She has served on the Business Affairs and Finance committees and is now the business affairs chair. She is also involved with the Executive Committee of Student Senate. 
Kothandapani is currently a JFC representative as well, a position which she wrote has helped her learn the pros and cons of the SBVPF position, including the strengths and weaknesses of the current system. The SBVPF chairs the JFC. Kothandapani’s other involvement on campus includes treasurer for Hindu spirituality and culture organization OM, captain of classical Indian dance team Payal, a member of the CIT Community Building Commitee, and a Donner mentor.
Fun Facts: 
Kothandapani loves dancing and has been a part of the bhangra team.
Kothandapani started a classical Indian dance team this year.
Kothandapani used to be shy and reserved when she first came to Carnegie Mellon; now loves making new friends and being 
involved on campus.

Over the last few years, it seems like the housing market has finally rebounded from the last real estate crisis. As Mother Jones reports, housing prices in some areas have been rising as much as 20 percent annually. However, the homeownership rate is still dropping. If less people are buying houses and becoming homeowners, then why are prices increasing?
But you see, my friend, that corporations are people too, and multiple homeownership among some of the largest financial corporations has soared. Wall Street firms, such as the private equity firm Blackstone, have been buying scores of foreclosed single family homes and renting them out. Armed with deep corporate pockets and the ability to pay upfront in cash, these firms are able to outbid individual buyers and own as many as one in every 11 homes in some areas, according to bloomberg.com.
Furthermore, Blackstone and its competitors have begun selling securities backed by rental payments from the properties they have purchased, which — considering Wall Street’s last foray into the real estate market — should raise some alarms. Here’s a sequel that no one wants to see: from the same people who brought you the smash hit movie of 2008, Real Estate Crisis: Subprime Meltdown, here comes the blockbuster event of the summer: Real Estate Crisis 2: Rental Fever! The single largest question, as elaborated upon in a credit analysis from Standard & Poor, is how Blackstone and other companies will manage the vast number of single-family homes it has acquired to avoid disruptions to cash flow. Unlike apartment buildings, single-family homes require more individualized care and are dispersed geographically, making maintenance incredibly difficult. Horror stories have already emerged detailing rental companies’ mismanagement. In one case, a company simply painted over the mold in response to a tenant’s complaint of mold on the walls, The Huffington Post reports.
It is also unclear how these companies will ensure that their houses are consistently leased and that their tenants consistently pay. According to the same Mother Jones article, Blackstone expects that 95 percent of its homes will be occupied at all times, each with an average monthly rent of around $1,300. These expectations may be overly ambitious for single-family rentals, and, therefore, they would need to be revised significantly in the case of an economic downturn. Of course, the activities of these rental companies will need to be watched carefully, but it is questionable whether regulatory agencies will do anything about it. The story of the mold on the walls is a disturbingly apt metaphor for the state of American financial regulation over the last few decades. The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which was supposed to provide more stringent regulation of the big banks after the 2008 crisis, has largely remained unimplemented, according to USA Today. This is especially true in regards to its two most important proposals: ending too-big-to-fail firms and banning proprietary trading.
While a housing bubble in itself may not be a bad thing, a housing bubble backed by unregulated, risky trading is a toxic combination that could once again implode the United States economy and, even worse, leave scores of people homeless without even an apartment to rent. The United States needs to push for stronger financial regulation before events play out like they did in 2008.

Last year, Pebble, one of the first smartwatches truly compatible with iOS and Android devices, was released via Kickstarter crowdsourcing. While it has been a somewhat successful product, it has only managed to sell around a few hundred thousand units and has not yet reached mainstream level. Despite the fact that Best Buy and other technology chains now carry it, those outside of the most tech-savvy group of young people do not seem to have been convinced yet that they need a smart watch.
However, the status of smart watches is about to change. 2014 will be the year of smart watches. Last week, Google announced that it will finally be making a serious entrance into the market with Android Wear — a minimal version of the Android operating system created specially for watches, which allows voice control, notifications at a glance, and support for a wide array of health monitoring devices.
Additionally, Motorola announced the summer release of one of the first devices to support this newly adapted operating system: the Moto 360. Motorola took an interesting approach to the watch’s design, abandoning the rectangular form factor of previous smart watches in favor of a circular design resembling traditional watches. Motorola focused as much on the design as the specs and has finally created something that will provide people with a familiar, attractive design.
Google has officially entered the market, and consumers and analysts are anticipating an Apple iWatch to be released before long. Over the past year, Apple has hired numerous health specialists, who are likely working on some kind of wearable fitness device. Last week, renderings of a Healthbook app — including real-time monitoring of various vitals such as heart rate, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and more — were also leaked by 9to5Mac.
As Digital Trends suggests, the iWatch will likely provide data for this application — controlled through Siri — and carry many features similar to Android Wear. The iWatch, as well as Android Wear devices, will not attempt to replace current smartphones, but to supplement them. These devices will provide a minimal always-on display of notifications, events, and more, meaning that people will finally be able to keep their phones in their pockets and focus more on the people around them.
The arrival of mainstream smart watches represents a change in lifestyle, in which technology becomes more continuously integrated into our lives. Instead of constantly reaching for our phones and taking time out of our lives to monitor notifications and events through various apps, we will always be able to obtain a given moment’s most important information with a simple glance at our wrists.
It’s ironic to think that new technology may allow us to become more sociable and fit, instead of the usual opposite result. The fact that we will be able to simply glance at our notifications, like people have glanced at watches for centuries, means that we will spend less time in the digital world and more time in the real world, while staying connected simultaneously. 
Because smart watches provide useful features and are now more similar to traditional watches that are already mainstream, people will soon be lining the stores to get their own.

Obama’s presidency may as well have eight months left. Now even Nate Silver, former New York Times statistics whiz, is predicting that Republicans are more likely than not to win control of the Senate in 2014. 
If that happens, President Obama’s last two years will be a brutal struggle against Congress with little to show for the first six years of his presidency but a stimulus of questionable efficacy and a healthcare act that's hurt more people than it's helped.
Let’s take a look at the races in 2014. One must remember that Senate seats go up for election every six years, which means that the Senators up for re-election in this cycle are the same ones who won in 2008, a wave election year for Democrats. As a result, Democrats are defending 21 seats and Republicans are defending only 15. In a Senate where Democrats control 55 total seats and Republicans control the remaining 45, Republicans only need to pick up six seats in 2014 to gain the majority.
Of the 36 seats up for election this year, some are totally safe, as popular incumbents are seeking re-election in states that generally vote for their party. John Cornyn (R–Texas), a two-term incumbent, probably won’t lose, just as three-term incumbent Jack Reed (D–R.I.), whose race is currently uncontested, won’t lose. 
Eliminating those seats leaves us with Democrats defending eight competitive seats and Republicans defending two — still not a pretty outlook for the president’s party, especially considering that Republicans are defending two seats in Georgia and Kentucky, two solidly Republican states.
Exacerbating this situation for Democrats is a retirement wave where many of their most popular incumbents are retiring from senatorship after serving multiple terms. Montana, a state that Mitt Romney carried by double digits in 2012, is losing veteran senator Max Baucus (D–Mont.), who has decided not to run in 2014, instead assuming the role of ambassador to China. Even though the fundamentals of a Senate election in Montana favor Republicans, a superstar candidate like Baucus whose name is well known and who polls exceptionally well, would make this a tough pickup for Republicans. 
Without the benefits of incumbency to influence the election, two fresh names on the ballot will likely fall prey to the state’s fundamentals, which favor Republicans and the most statistically significant factor in midterm elections: the president’s approval rating, which is hovering around a markedly low 43 percent.
Democrats have a similar situation in West Virginia, where Jay Rockefeller (D–W.Va.) decided not to run for re-election, putting a state that’s been hit the hardest by Democrats’ regulation on coal, safely in Republican territory. Add South Dakota to that list, and already Republicans are looking at three easy pickups, shifting the Senate landscape to 52 Democrats and 48 Republicans.
The next wave of possible Republican pickups comes form a group of Senators in traditionally red states that Mitt Romney won in 2012. This is where Obamacare and the toxic political atmosphere for Democrats comes into play. Mark Pryor (D–Ark.), Kay Hagan (D–N.C.), Mark Begich (D–Ala.), and Mary Landrieu (D–La.) are already fending off advertisements labeling them as the deciding vote for Obamacare.  Recent polling puts their chances even with or slightly below their potential Republican competitors, as primaries aren't over yet. However, as we’ve seen in every election, a party’s candidates always suffer in polling during their primaries, so expect those four Senators’ races to sway a few additional points toward Republicans as primaries come to a close.
If Republicans pick up three of those four seats, they’ve already won the majority and that’s not even counting other potential pickups. Superstar Scott Brown (R–Mass.) just announced his candidacy in New Hampshire after moving there early this year, Carl Levin (D–Mich.) retired, and though Michigan is a traditionally liberal state, it is quite possible that Republicans will nominate a better candidate than Democrats and carry the race.
Additionally, Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) just retired, and a high-quality Republican candidate could put a state whose most famed newspaper, the Des Moines Register, ended 30-plus years of endorsing Democrats to endorse Mitt Romney in 2012. Finally, Al Franken (D–Minn.) won a highly controversial race in 2008, and barely walked away with the victory. Obama additionally only carried the state with 52 percent of the vote in 2012. Now that the landscape is much more toxic to Democrats, a Republican pickup is not out of the question.
So what happens if Republicans do pick up the Senate? Obama has had a great time being able to paint Republicans as obstructionists, as his agenda has been primarily opposed by a Republican majority in the House of Representatives, which polling concludes is likely to stick around in 2014. If Republicans take over the Senate, Obama's whole “one half of one house is opposing my agenda” narrative turns into “one man against Congress.”
If history is any guide, the American people generally don’t like presidents that defy the will of Congress, as it stings of tyranny. Obama’s agenda will be effectively dead, and he’ll be forced to comply with the will of an adversarial Congress, or be defined as an inflexible, imperialistic ideologue for abusing his veto power. Either way, Obama’s days of creating and pushing an agenda are over, and the president whose candidacy marked the self-declared “moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow, and our planet began to heal” will be reduced to nothing more than a lame duck.

Take a moment and think of your biggest complaint about the United States. If you’re like me, our penchant for intervening in the affairs of other nations is probably near the top of the list. A close second place in the race for worst thing about the States might belong to the unrestrained corporate greed — at the detriment of employees, consumers, and the environment — which is either supported or unopposed by the government. The maltreatment of ethnic minorities and the LGBT community by both individuals and institutions is also a front-runner.
The list goes on. From government surveillance to widespread corruption of both law enforcement and bureaucracy, it’s pretty easy to see that there’s a lot wrong with the United States of America. As such, a degree of cynicism and suspicion is an unsurprising and rational response to the actions of our government. 
So when Vladimir Putin and his government decries United States and European Union (EU) statements condemning the Russian intervention in Crimea by claiming “the pot is calling the kettle black,” one has to admit he has a point.
But that does not mean the kettle isn’t black. Apart from gun laws that line up with what many liberals would like to see in the United States, almost any issue one might take with America is not only present, but likely more pronounced in Russia. 
While the attempts by certain states to pass laws legalizing discrimination against homosexuals in the name of “religious liberty” are a frightening step backward that we need to acknowledge and fight against, here in the United States we have the ability to denounce these laws as morally repugnant. 
In Russia, such vocal opposition would be illegal, as would even saying that homosexuality is not a form of perversion in any forum where a minor might overhear. While the Olympics were taking place there was little controversy, since foreigners at Sochi were exempt from Russia’s anti-gay propaganda laws, but doing so at other times or other places would lead to deportation for foreigners or jail time for locals.
While the United States government has little direct control over the country’s media, most television and print in Russia is controlled by the government. The handful of independent news and media organizations must ration out their criticism, lest they attract the ire of the Kremlin and have their assets seized and gifted to one of the oligarchs who run the massive, formerly state-owned corporations inherited from the Soviet Union.
For the sake of LGBT rights and press freedom alone, Russian annexation of Crimea should be opposed, or else another 10,000 square miles of the planet might be subject to brutal repression and gag laws. Russian media would counter this argument by rightly pointing to the United States’s habit of propping up repressive regimes around the world; America’s misadventures in illegal invasion need to be conceded, particularly in Iraq. Regardless of the justification or the end result, breaching another country’s sovereignty is illegal and does not befit a nation that considers itself a world leader, which is something Russia has not failed to point out.
Of course, if you believe RT — a Kremlin-funded English news TV outlet — or other Russian media outlets, Russia hasn’t put a single soldier on the ground in Crimea. The heavily armed soldiers carrying AK-74’s, standard issue assault rifles for Russian infantry; wearing Russian fatigues and body armor “bought in a shop”, Putin asserted in a public address; and driving Russian military vehicles with Russian identification plates are Crimean “self-defense” forces. Crimean forces who, for some reason, speak with Russian accents and have admitted on camera that they are Russian soldiers.
Compare the troops at the Belbek Airfield standoff — where 300 Ukrainian servicemen and their families marched unarmed on their own base and demanded to talk to an officer after warning shots were fired — and the image reminiscent of the Maiden protesters who ousted former President Yanukovych, which RT is trying to advance now.
If you, like me, are opposed to any aspect of the conduct of the United States or any other Western power, you should be opposed to Russia’s indefensible lies, deceit, and aggression. People who live in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones, but there’s more than one all-window home on this block.

On March 11, the United States Senate managed to unanimously approve a resolution. The 97—0 vote was in favor of a bill that made numerous changes to the military’s sexual assault policies, most notably getting rid of the “good soldier” defense in cases of alleged sexual assault.
Under the current system, a soldier’s good performance and pristine military record may be presented in his or her defense when charged with sexual assault of a fellow member of the military. Senator Claire McCaskill described the good soldier defense as “the ridiculous notion that how well one flies a plane should have anything to do with whether they committed a crime.”
As Major Franklin Rosenblatt wrote in a 2010 journal article published in The Army Lawyer quoted by Time Magazine, “In application, character witnesses are commonly called to testify about their willingness to deploy with an accused. Other allowable ‘good military character’ testimony includes that an accused is ‘dedicated to being a good drill instructor,’ lawful, easygoing, dependable, and well liked. With so many traits to choose from that are permissible and admissible, nearly anyone can qualify as a `good soldier.’” 
Evidence had increasingly come to light regarding the number of unreported, unprosecuted sexual assault incidences in the United States military, and removing this defense is an excellent step toward properly punishing those who commit sexual assault.
This bill now has to pass the United States House of Representatives. Many hope that the measure will be passed in an effort to promote the prosecution and prevention of military sexual assault. Doing away with the absurd good soldier defense is certainly a step in the right direction.

Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg recently launched the Ban Bossy Campaign with Lean In and the Girl Scouts of America. The campaign seeks to stop people from calling young girls “bossy”, as the term is inherently gendered and always pejorative, and discourages the cultivation of leadership qualities in young girls. Notable participants include former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Beyoncé, as well as Jane Lynch. 
Some critics of Ban Bossy claim that the campaign itself is ridiculous — that banning language is useless and does not effect change, that women should just deal with being called bossy, and that young girls shouldn’t be bossy anyway. 
These particular criticisms miss the true purpose of the campaign. Ban Bossy seeks to make people understand that language has impact, most especially on young children, and that the cultural practice of discouraging young girls from pursuing leadership starts very early in children’s lives. The eradication of the word “bossy” will not end sexism in the United States; it’s just one word, and grown, professional women are not the target of the campaign. 
The point of the campaign is that we use the word “bossy” to shame female children when they express themselves. Parents and teachers should curtail controlling or overly aggressive behavior in children while raising them to be functional adults, but when boys exhibit such tendencies, the usual response is something along the lines of “boys will be boys.” By this mindset, when boys act on aggression, they are manifesting a natural instinct. 
When girls exhibit aggression, they are behaving in a way that is somehow shameful and to be discouraged. 
This cultural tendency both encourages and excuses aggression in boys that can easily become violence in men, and teaches girls to censor themselves — to be smaller, quieter, and more compliant. This gendered disparity is what the Ban Bossy Campaign is trying to right.
Ban Bossy has an added importance for young girls of color in the United State as they grow up and begin to take leadership roles. While adult white women are at a disadvantage in the labor market, adult women of color are at an even greater one. 
White women earn 77 cents for every dollar white men make, on average. Black women earn 64 cents for every dollar, and Latina women earn 55 cents, according to the Center for American Progress. The myriad of ways in which sexism and racism intersect in the United States means that young women of color need even more support in their development as young leaders. 
It’s true that banning the word “bossy” itself will not have much cultural effect; but the campaign is important and necessary because it seeks to make people think about the way they use language, and all the implications that words can carry.

In response to student demand, Housing and Dining Services will now offer block housing in Morewood Gardens for students choosing to live with a group of six to 12 friends or peers.
Housing and Dining Services’ choice to offer block housing in Morewood Gardens provides students looking to remain with their friends an option in a central location on campus, but the process must be altered in future years to accommodate students choosing to participate in general housing selection. 
The option for block housing in Morewood Gardens is a welcome addition in a move to offer students a wider variety of choice during the housing selection process. 
The Tartan also appreciates that Housing and Dining Services took student demand into account when making the decision to offer block housing in a dorm-style location. Previously, students could only choose block housing in Webster, Fairfax, Neville, Shady Oak, and Shirley Apartments, which are all off-campus and apartment-style.
As Housing and Dining Services revisits block housing for the 2015-16 room selection process. However, the process should be altered further to take into account the incentives that offering block housing in a wider range of locations could create. 
Currently, students could choose block housing because they receive priority for room selection over those participating in general room selection. While the option of block housing benefits students who are able to find a group of friends to form a block with, the system could be detrimental to students who are unable to do so. 
Block housing has the potential to force students who choose to live with a random roommate or roommates into rooms left over after block housing selection. Offering block housing in a dorm known as a central building for upperclassmen could severely limit the choices of upperclassmen to obtain the housing they want as they compete with student blocks.
As Housing and Dining Services continues to improve the room selection process, they should consider altering the time at which students choose block housing, so that those participating in general room selection can compete. 
For example, for next year, blocks could choose a number in the general housing selection process or they could be limited to certain floors of dorm-style locations to provide other students the opportunity to obtain their preferred housing. Otherwise, these students have much fewer options to choose from in room selection.
