On Jan. 24, former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison. Over 150 of his victims spoke in court, and the total number of accusers has risen to nearly 300 young women. He has been a criminal since his years at Michigan State University to his rise as the leading doctor of USA Gymnastics. Victims have said they merely believed his abuse was how doctors typically worked, as they were exposed to him when they were as young as six.
As the Time’s Up movement takes off in Hollywood, the importance of eradicating sexual assault by men in all positions of power cannot be understated. From politicians to producers to doctors, sexual assault is an epidemic among powerful men across many professional fields. As reported by The New York Times, since the fall of Harvey Weinstein, 51 men in Hollywood and politics accused of sexual assault have resigned, been fired, or experienced serious professional fallout. This “Weinstein Effect” has not yet fully permeated into the sports world.
Nassar’s case is unique, not only for the vast number of women speaking out, but also for the court decision. Most cases of sexual assault in sports never make it past rumors: cases are usually settled quietly outside of court, and accusers often retract their statements. It happened with Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant, with Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger in 2009 and 2010, and with Chicago Blackhawks forward Patrick Kane in 2015. Claims of sexual misconduct and domestic assault seem to be in every sport, from football to golf to gymnastics, but are swept under the rug.
This is the horror expected by victims of sexual assault. A crime is reported, one that changed the victim’s life forever, and their abuser is allowed to walk away with his life and reputation intact. The Nassar case changes things.
The unprecedented number of victims and the explicit description of the crimes committed brought justice to almost 300 women. But if there were so many victims and the assault was so damaging, why did it come out just now? Why were allegations only leveled against Nassar within the last two years, after the Indianapolis Star released a story about the first two accusers?
The blame lies undeniably with USA Gymnastics. The board of USA Gymnastics and, to a similar extent, the leaders of Michigan State, have covered up Nassar’s crimes since he began his work. Allegations date back over 20 years, but many victims are only just now w forward. Olympic gold medalist McKayla Maroney stated that USA Gymnastics paid her $100,000 to keep quiet about her allegations against Nassar. Michigan State processed misconduct claims in 2012 and 2014 — neither were pursued, and both were dismissed. The people in power were desperate to keep Nassar in power as well, covering up scandal after scandal until they could no longer hold back the words of the women they had let down.
Nassar faces sixty more charges of sexual assault in a separate county in Michigan, after having already received his sentence from the first case. The entire board of USA Gymnastics has resigned on the request of the U.S. Olympic Committee, and both the President and the Athletic Coordinator at Michigan State have resigned as well. These enablers of abuse will not face charges; they will not have to listen to the accounts of the countless women they allowed to get abused. They will likely all find new jobs soon, with their role in this brushed under the table.
Sadly, America is just now learning how to address the way many powerful men abuse their power. The Larry Nassar case is hopefully the first of many to bring down the men enabled and forgiven by society, and perhaps it will set a standard for the future. There is nothing that can bring back the years lost to Nassar’s abuse and no way to turn back time in order to save every single woman he violated in his office, under the guise of medical expertise. Yet, perhaps this surge of men finally facing consequences for their actions will allow victims, not only those from sports but countless women assaulted by men in power, to finally begin to heal.

Can you imagine cheering for a team called the “New York Jews” or the “San Francisco Chinese?” What about wearing a hat whose logo is an exaggerated stereotype: a yarmulke-wearing big-nosed man or an excessively slant-eyed man donning a conical hat?
Just thinking about these hypothetical teams is uncomfortable, but one ethnic group, Native Americans, is commonly used as professional sports teams’ mascots throughout the U.S. The Washington Redskins in the NFL has received a lot of flak over the past several years for their blatantly racist name, while the Atlanta Braves and the Cleveland Indians of Major League Baseball, the Chicago Blackhawks of the NHL, and the NFL’s Kansas City Chiefs have also been criticized, albeit to a lesser degree. The Cleveland Indians made a major step towards rectifying their team’s offensive branding this past week.
Last Monday, MLB announced that after the 2018 season — due to get underway on March 29 — the Indians will discontinue their “Chief Wahoo” logo. The logo has long been criticized for the way it depicts Native Americans as a racial caricature, from its bright red skin to the feather poking up from its hair. The mascot, originally appearing with yellow skin and a thinner face in 1948, changed to its current form in 1951 and has long been a point of contention. Native American groups have argued for years that the logo is derogatory, while some diehard fans have defended it. Increasing pressure from MLB commissioner Rob Manfred over the past year prompted the Cleveland club to finally make a change.
The Indians had already been shifting away from the logo for a few years now, using the simple “block-C” logo more frequently. After 2019, Chief Wahoo will disappear from all official uniforms and signs at their stadium, Progressive Field. Fans, though, will still be able to purchase Chief Wahoo merchandise at the team’s shop and in retail stores throughout Ohio. The team will also keep the trademark and still profit off of Chief Wahoo merchandise, although MLB claims this is an attempt to prevent businesses from using the logo in negative ways.
While the removal of Chief Wahoo is a crucial victory for Native Americans, there is still a long way to go before the exploitation of Native Americans for mascots is entirely eradicated. Redskins owner Dan Snyder and the NFL have both opposed changing the team’s name, despite it being widely considered the most offensive example. Although the Braves and the Chiefs have slightly less insensitive names, they have drawn criticism for their fan cultures. Braves fans perform the “tomahawk chop” to intimidate other teams — fans chant to loud music and simulate the action of using a tomahawk with their arms. The Chiefs’ pregame ritual involves a cheerleader riding onto the field on a horse named “Warpaint” waving the Chiefs flag while a special guest bangs on a massive drum.
While the Chief Wahoo logo will soon be gone, this is simply the first long-awaited step that the other sports teams must follow. This is not a matter of being politically correct. This is a matter of removing blatantly racist imagery and cultural appropriation from nationally known institutions that feed into the enduring stereotyping and dehumanization of Native Americans in the U.S.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team played two games against University Athletic Association (UAA) rivals this past weekend, the New York University (NYU) Violets on Friday, Feb. 2, and the Brandeis University Judges on Sunday, Feb. 4. The Tartans split the games, falling to NYU 71–59 and defeating Brandeis 72–58.
Against the Violets, three Tartans scored double digit points, led by junior Patrick Ehland with 14 points off the bench. Ehland also led the team in rebounds, with seven. Sophomore Colin McNeil posted his first career double-double, with 10 points and 10 assists, which also led the Carnegie Mellon squad. Sophomore Zach Howard also added 10 points in the loss.
The Tartans opened the game strong, going on a 9–2 run to set the tone early. The Violets responded immediately with their own 14–1 run in the next five minutes to establish a 16–10 lead over the home team. The momentum shifted to the Tartans, who took back the lead 22–18 with a 12–2 run, with seven of the points from junior Seth Henry. Seven straight points gave the Violets back the lead, who held on to end the half leading 31–28.
Ehland scored the first points of the second half, tipping in his own missed layup. Continuing the back-and-forth runs of the first half, the second half began with a 11–4 run by the Tartans. After trading baskets for the next couple possessions, Ehland’s layup tied the game at 45–45. Over the next eight minutes, the Violets put together a 17–6 run for an 11-point lead. With 2:13 left to play, a free throw by Ehland cut the lead to seven, but the Violets built on their lead and finished the game 71–59.
The Tartans recorded more second chance points, points in the paint, and bench points than the Violets, but suffered from a lower field goal percentage (37.3 percent to the Violets’ 46.4 percent).
Four Tartans recorded double digit points against the Brandeis Judges on Sunday. Sophomore Trent Suddeth led the way with 15 points and 10 rebounds, on his second career double-double. McNeil and Howarth scored 11 points apiece, while McNeil also dished out a team-high five assists, and senior Ryan Maha added ten points.
The Tartans began the game hot, scoring seven straight points on their way to a 20–4 run, which included four consecutive three-pointers, over the first seven minutes of the first half. The Tartans defense did not let the lead fall below 10 points. The home team entered the half with the score 45–24.
An 11-2 run early in the second half helped the Judges cut the Tartan’s 21-point lead to a 12-point lead. At the midway point of the half, a layup by Howarth sparked 11 straight points for the Tartans to make the score 66–44. The Tartans would not relinquish the lead, ultimately winning the game 72–58.
An overall 48.3 field goal percentage for the game gave the Tartans the edge over the Judges, who shot 35.6 percent from the field. The Tartan’s 35 percent three-point percentage compared to the Judges’ 26.3 percent also helped the Tartans secure the win.
With their win against Brandeis, the first since December, the Tartans broke a 10-game losing streak and move to 5–15 on the season and 1–8 in UAA play. The team will return to Skibo Gymnasium to host Emory University  on Friday, Feb. 9, at 8 p.m.

This past weekend, the Carnegie Mellon women’s basketball team faced off against two University Athletic Association (UAA) rivals, the New York University (NYU) Violets and the Brandeis University Judges.
In front of an excited home crowd at Skibo Gymnasium, the Tartans battled the Violets in a nail-biting game on Friday, Feb. 2. The game came to the final seconds of the fourth quarter, with the Tartans ultimately falling 68–63 to their University Athletic Association (UAA) rivals.
Three Tartans scored in the double digits, with sophomore MaKayla Filiere leading the way with 23 points. Sophomore Katharine Higgins followed with 15 points and nine rebounds, while first-year Kylie Huffman dropped 10 points off the bench and added four blocks. Junior Jenn Mayberger led the team with nine rebounds and six assists.
The Violets got on the scoreboard first with a quick layup and held off the aggressive Tartans squad for most of the first quarter. With 3:44 left in the quarter, Filiere hit a three-point shot to make the score 10–8 and take the first lead of the game for the Tartans. The Violets responded with a 7–0 run in the next two minutes, and led 17–2 at the end of the quarter.
Th teams traded baskets for much of the quarter, the Tartans keeping the lead within reach. A layup by sophomore Megan Jaeb after an offensive rebound gave the Tartans their second lead of the game, 26–25. Late in the quarter, the Violets tied the game and soon pulled away, and led 34–28 at the half.
Coming out of halftime, the Tartans stayed aggressive, their defense keeping them in the game. Feeding off the defense, the  offense came alive, surging to a 39–36 lead after an 11–2 run capped off by a layup from sophomore Laura Ochsner. The Violets fought to tie the game 48–48 at the end of the third quarter.
Bursting into the fourth quarter, the Violets scored five straight points to take a small lead over the Tartans. With 2:41 left to play, the Violets led by seven points. The Tartans scored five straight points of their own to cut the deficit to two. A layup from Huffman brought the Tartans within one point with 13 seconds to go. Down by three points, two missed three-point attempts forced the Tartans to foul with two tenths of a second left in the game. A final two free throws ended the game, the Violets taking the win 68–63.
The two teams finished with nearly identical field goal percentages, with the Violets shooting 40.6 percent from the field (26-64), and the Tartans shooting 41.3 percent (26-63).
On Sunday afternoon, the Tartans lost to the Brandeis Judges 60–52. The Tartans were led by Filiere’s 16 points and sophomore Laurel Pereira’s 13 points. Mayberger led the Tartans on the glass with 10 rebounds. Mayberger also led the team in assists, with five, and steals, with four. Huffman and Higgins each recorded five blocks.
The first quarter consisted of back and forth possessions between the two teams, each trading baskets and the lead. With 1:45 left to play in the quarter, a three-point shot by Filiere made the score 17–12, the final score of the first quarter.
Pereira started the scoring in the second quarter, and the Tartans led for the entirely of the quarter. They led by as much as 10 points, but the Judges finished the half with two buckets to cut the deficit to six points, 33–27.
A 13–4 run by the Judges in the third quarter gave them back the lead, 43–42, with 2:16 to go. The Judges held on to their lead, extending it to 12 points late in the fourth quarter on the team’s third three-pointer of the period.
Both teams’ overall shooting efficiency was low, but the Judges improved their shooting in the second half from 27.8 percent to 32.4 percent, and made five triples while the Tartans made only one. The Tartans’ team shooting fell to just 18.7 percent in the second half, allowing the Judges to come from behind to take the victory.
The Judges also benefited from 24 points off the bench, while the Tartans contributed only 10 bench points.
After the two games this weekend, the men’s basketball team’s record moves to 1–8 in UAA play and 9–11 overall this season. The Tartans will next host Emory University on Friday, Feb. 9 at 6:00 p.m.

The scene in Star Wars: Episode IV — A New Hope, when through the bluish light of R2-D2's suspended 3D image, Princess Leia famously says, "Help me, Obi Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope," captures, arguably one of the most iconic moments from the Star Wars universe. With its graceful desperation, an undercurrent of hope and the impending possibility of adventure, the scene, in some ways, sets the mood of the movie. It inspires us to seek out those moments of adventure in our own lives, and the best part is that we might be able to do that with 3D images like the one in the scene.
Researchers at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, have managed to create such an image about the size of a postage stamp, according to Science. At the moment, the researchers' technology uses a single particle to draw these images, which means that it can only draw very small pictures, though they are high-resolution pictures. Daniel Smalley, an electrical engineer who worked on the research says that to make the images bigger, they would have to refine their prototype and create a system to manipulate 100 to 1000 particles at once. 
Previously, we have used holograms — 2D image surfaces — and certain illusions to render 3D objects in a 2D space. However, the images created by them have to be viewed from a certain angle to be seen fully. But, the new 3D images actually occupy 3D space and can be viewed from all angles. It could be thought of as a 3D sculpture made of light. 
According to Science magazine, this free space volumetric display works by first "trapping" a cellulose particle in a photophoretic "trap". The trap is essentially a suspension of some gas or liquid that has been exposed to a beam of the laser. The laser then guides the particle around while red, green, or blue lights illuminate it. This particle then becomes a single pixel, as it scatters the illuminating light. Thus, similar to the effect of waving a sparkler around, guiding the particle in a loop to scatter light in the same ways over and over again, blurs the pixels together to create an image made out of light. The group's research was published in Nature this past Jan.

When scientists apply for research funding and reviewers evaluate applications with a focus on the applicant's CVs, male scientists are more likely than female scientists to receive funding. When reviewers focus on the proposed research, the bias vanishes.
These were the findings of a recent study of 24,000 grant applications to the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), a federal funding agency similar to the U.S. National Institute of Health.  
In 2014, CIHR replaced its traditional grant application system with a more modern one, consisting of two complementary grant application programs. In one program, grant applications are evaluated primarily based on the proposed research the grant would support. In the other, grant applications are evaluated primarily based on the applicant — their previous research and their career.
A team led by health-informatics researcher Holly Witteman examined three years' worth of grant applications and their outcomes, comparing the two grant programs. They found that in the program that focused on the applicant, not the proposed research, male applicants were four percent more likely than female applicants to have their applications accepted. "That’s a significant difference,” Witteman says, especially considering the overall application acceptance rate was about 15 percent. This gender bias was not present in the grant program that focused on the proposed research itself.
This study's results are less ambiguous than other studies on gender bias in grant applications. Previous studies have been often inconclusive because they typically did not take into account the research fields of applicants (and the gender ratios in those fields), the nature of the grant program, and what factors the reviewers were actually assessing. Witteman says her team was able to draw "more robust conclusions" because of the unique dual structure of CIHR's grant program and because they statistically accounted for the factors that many other studies have not.
The study's findings are hopeful because it shows that sometimes it only takes a simple change to reduce bias: in this case, asking application reviewers to focus on the science rather than the scientist.

What does your debit card have in common with a smartphone, a library book, and an outdoor cat? All of these things are commonly equipped with a technology called Radio Frequency Identification, better known as RFID.
RFID is a short-range technology that uses radio waves to track and identify specially tagged items. Because RFID tags are usually small, light, and flat, they can be attached to almost anything. According to Technovelgy, each tag has a microchip that contains digitally stored data, as well as an antenna that can send or receive radio signals. 
According to HowStuffWorks.com, to read the data on a RFID tag, you need an RFID reader. The reader sends out electromagnetic energy in the form of radio waves, which are received by the tag's antenna. The tag responds with its own radio signal, which contains the data stored on its microchip. The reader can then pick up and interpret ("read") the data. 
What kind of data do you store on an RFID tag? Some tags, like the anti-shoplifting tags you can find in any retail store, are manufactured with their data built in and permanently fixed, often a unique serial number that can be used to identify an item. On other tags, the stored data is something that needs to be customized, changed, and updated - like the RFID-enabled computer chip in some public transit passes, which keeps track of your balance, deducting the cost of a fare each time you use the card.
Most commonly, because RFID tags are mass-produced and cheap, the stored data is incredibly simple. "Electronic article surveillance tags, which are still used in packaging today, have a 1-bit tag. The bit is either on or off. If someone pays for the item, the bit is turned off, and a person can leave the store," explains Mark Roberti of RFID Journal. "But if the person doesn't pay and tries to walk out of the store, readers at the door detect the tag and sound an alarm."
There are two main types of RFID tags: active tags power their own signals with an internal battery, while passive tags must "harvest" energy from the reader's signal to send a reply. According to RFID manufacturer AB&R, the way the tags interact with the reader determines the kind of RFID system: Active Reader Active Tag (ARAT), Active Reader Passive Tag (ARPT), and Passive Reader Active Tag (PRAT). In both ARAT and ARPT systems, the tag is activated by the reader's signal. Most RFID systems in our everyday lives belong to this category. In PRAT systems, the reader simply acts as a receiver for signals from the active tags; these systems are used to keep tabs on an inventory of large, valuable items that can move around, like a herd of cows.
According to the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History, RFID was originally a military invention, designed to supplement radar. Radar was an essential tool during World War II, but, on a radar screen, you couldn't tell if the planes you saw were your fighters or the enemies. To fix that problem, the British designed a technology they called "Identify Friend or Foe," or IFF: the first RFID system. IFF, installed on fighter planes, sent out radio waves to other aircrafts. If the other planes were friendly, their own IFF devices would respond with a radio signal marking them as allies.
After RFID technology was first declassified and made available for civilian use in the early 1970's, it was mainly used for keeping track of herded cattle. HowStuffWorks.com explains that the "inductively coupled" RFID tags used for this purpose were too large and expensive for a widespread commercial application. When the technology's usefulness became clear, researchers began working constantly to make the technology smaller and cheaper. In the decades that followed, the smaller and more affordable RFID technology became, the more regularly we interacted with it. 
Pet identification microchips, automated toll payment (E-ZPass), and "chip-and-PIN" cards are just a few examples of the extremely versatile ways RFID has been implemented in our daily lives. With pet microchips, which can be scanned at animal shelters to identify the owners of lost pets, RFID technology provides a reliable solution to a widespread problem. In the case of E-ZPass, which eliminates congestion by letting you drive through a tollbooth without stopping, RFID functions as an automation tool, streamlining a previously tedious encounter. And on chipped debit and credit cards, which store your payment information not in a magnetic stripe but on a RFID chip, RFID technology not only enables contactless payment but also actively protects your data. The RFID chip, because it's a tiny computer, can have built-in cryptography protection. In this case, RFID is used to revamp an old system, making it elegant and far more secure.
New RFID innovations are still being implemented across the globe. According to AB&R, an area with great potential for RFID tags is the complete replacement of the barcodes found on almost every consumer product. "RFID is similar to barcoding in that data from a tag or label are captured by a device that stores the data in a database," their website explains. "RFID, however, has several advantages over systems that use [barcodes]." 
While barcodes need to be manually scanned, with a scanner that needs an unbroken line of sight to read the code, RFID tags are scanned automatically. When you check out a tagged library book, a reader embedded in the security gate scans the book's tag as you exit the library. Many envision a similar system in grocery stores and other retail outlets, where a reader would scan the tags in your cart as you exit — completely eliminating the checkout line.

The Children’s School at Carnegie Mellon University — one of the most sought after children's schools for children three to six years of age in Pittsburgh — is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. In 1971, it was placed under the Department of Psychology in the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences. The school was founded in 1968 by Ann Baldwin Taylor — a developmental psychologist and educator, with a grant from the Esso Foundation and support from psychology professor John Sandberg. Dr. Baldwin served as director of the school for 25 years after which Dr. Sharon Carver, who also teaches at Carnegie Mellon, led the school and is serving her 25th year as the school’s director. Dr. Carver completed her Bachelor's and Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon.
Dr. Baldwin founded the school based on the vision of John Dewey — philosopher, psychologist and educational reformer — who believed in progressive education, such as learning by doing, and argued that learning is a social process which makes the school a social institution through which social reform can and should take place. The school designs its own curriculum and comprises of 96 students who are both racially and economically diverse, with only 15 percent from Carnegie Mellon-affiliated households and one-third of the students on partial or full scholarship. At the moment the school has 17 educators and three substitutes. 
In a Carnegie Mellon press release, Dr. Carver says, "the needs of the children have not changed all that much over the years, but each year the Children's School makes a greater impact on [Carnegie Mellon] and the broader community of early childhood development, research, and education." The laboratory school provides a space for over 200 undergraduate students enrolled in child development courses and research to better understand children's language, concepts, mathematical and scientific thinking, and other cognitive foundations for learning. 
The school provides its students with a constructive learning environment and in return, the students participate in research conducted at the school. While enrolling, parents have to consent to the research studies which are only conducted if approved by Dr. Carver and the Institutional Review Board (IRB).
One of the projects that the school has is "Message from Me," which is an age appropriate adaptation of technology that allows the children to record the activities of their day using kiosks and send them to their parents’ mobile phones or emails. According to the Message from Me website, this project is based on the principle that, while these children — aged three to five — are developing rapidly and in many ways, they are unable to tell their parents what they “did at school” due to limited abilities in remembering and explaining. This would not only foster better communication skills among the children but also “enhance parent-child conversations in ways that impact the child's feeling of individuality, self-confidence and well-being.”
Another example of the research at the school is that of Dr. Anna Fisher — an Associate Professor in Carnegie Mellon's Psychology Department who is currently working on "Classroom Environment, Allocation of Attention, and Learning Outcomes in K–4 Students." The research aims to study the effects of visual media on children's ability to get distracted in a classroom setting. This research is a multi-study process and will be conducted using a variety of approaches.

Last week, a friend dragged me to a movie that she described as a "love story between a mute woman and a fish." I was intrigued and had no idea what to expect. The Shape of Water turned out to be marvelous, an adult fairy tale swimming in truths about racism, homophobia, and the fear of the unknown.
The setting is Baltimore, Maryland. The time is the early '60s: America is in the grip of the Civil Rights movement and at the height of the Cold War. While Washington is obsessed with finding new ways to stay a step ahead of the Soviets, many Americans view the "others" — those with different skin tones, sexual dispositions, or ideologies — with contempt.
Elisa (Sally Hawkins) is a mute, isolated and idealistic cleaning lady in a hidden, high-security government lab in Baltimore. She values routine and seems content with her stock in life. Everyday, she wakes up in the evening, makes her hard-boiled egg, checks in with her roommate Giles (Richard Jenkins) a repressed gay unemployed artist, takes the bus to work, and arrives just in time for her chatty and protective friend Zelda (Octavia Spencer) to punch her in.  All of this is upended when the "fish" is brought into the lab by cruel government agent Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon). The credits bill him as the "Amphibian Man." He is a blue-skinned, humanoid amphibian kidnapped by Strickland from the Amazon, where the natives consider him a god.
Strickland and most of the facility view the Amphibian Man as a test subject to be weaponized. They want to study and dissect him, looking for secrets that might counter the Russians. Strickland, in particular, treats him with contempt and hatred, routinely torturing him to show dominance. Opposing Strickland is Robert Hoffstetler (Michael Stuhlbarg), a scientist with a secret agenda, who wants the creature studied in a more humane way.
Elisa, on the other hand, becomes fascinated with the Amphibian Man, sneaking into his chamber, and introducing him to things from her life — hard boiled egg and recorded music. Neither of them can speak to anyone, and this shared experience lets them read each other on a more primal level. They develop an instant wordless bond. With time, their bond blossoms into love, leading to an inter-species romance that is beautiful, because it is narratively challenging. It flies in the face of social, even moral acceptability, and is set in a time when interracial and same-sex relationships were viewed in the same way.
Save for a surrealistic dream sequence late in the movie, neither Elisa nor the Amphibian Man utter a single word. And yet, stolen glances, intimate body language, and the characters’ actions reveal their deep longing to each other and to us. Sally Hawkins has done a truly incredible job with Elisa, spectacularly conveying her growth through the movie.  She goes from being despondently content with her humdrum existence to facing down everything that is expected of her with a burning passion. She sneaks the Amphibian Man out of the lab in a daring escape and uses sign language to tell a clueless Strickland to f*** off in a poignant display of defiance. Hawkins has succeeded creating a multi-dimensional character with strength and vulnerability — without a line of dialogue.
Another way to look at The Shape of Water is as a monster movie. The Amphibian Man is green, blue and scaly, sounds like an alien, and towers above the human characters. He also has a penchant for violence — he claws off two of Strickland’s fingers and eats Giles’ cat. And yet, like Frankenstein’s monster or Godzilla or Kong, we see him as a literal fish out of the water, in a hostile, bigoted environment, fighting to survive.
The real monster, however, is the human being responsible for the creature’s plight. Michael Shannon has a blast playing Strickland as a willfully ignorant isolationist — the classic ugly American. He is humorless, intimidating, and regressive. In an early sequence, he makes fun of Elisa for being mute to her face, assuming she is also deaf. A little later, he calls her to his office and aggressively propositions her. He is openly contemptuous to those beneath him, virulent to those unlike him, and obsessed with impressing those above him. He even starts to look like a monster when he reattaches the fingers the Amphibian Man cut off. They turn gangrenous and drip with pus for the rest of the movie.
As is expected with a Guillermo Del Toro movie, the cinematography and set and sound design are out of this world. The visual palette itself is full of deep, oversaturated blues and greens — in hand soap, in Jello molds, in bathroom tiles and on the creature itself — and is evocative of the inherent mystery and romance of the ocean. The camera pans gracefully between lush scenes, and Alexandre Desplat’s score has a warm fluidity. This creates a sense of buoyancy that keeps a viewer from getting bogged down in the movie’s weightier themes.
The Shape of Water is Del Toro’s most impressive work since Pan’s Labyrinth. It has been nominated for 13 Oscars, and I hope it wins a fair number of them. Go watch it if you’d like a delightfully bubbly and slightly weird romance that makes you believe in love again. Go watch it if you’d like a heady meditation on race, bigotry, inclusion, and sexual identity told through a breathtakingly simple metaphor. Just go watch it. It’s an instant classic.

Dear Izzy, 
There seems to be only one thing on the minds of everyone around me these days, except mine, and that’s their freshman summer. More specifically, jobs. My friends are worrying about their resumes and stressing out about interviews; some are even choosing which, of their many internship acceptance letters, to reply to with an enthusiastic YES. My parents are constantly, constantly, constantly nagging me and pushing me to start applying for jobs and to put myself out there to get experience, and they just keep stressing that “THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR YOU,” but they’re honestly just making me more stressed about everything. So, now I’m sitting here, in my room, freaking out about if my résumé looks good enough and poring over company research to impress recruiters at the job fair. I’m worried if I’m actually going to be able to get any internships this summer, or if my grades are high enough to get me those internships. And I don’t want to waste my whole summer doing nothing. What do I do?
Just Only Beginning Lengthy Experience Search, Struggling
Dear JOBLESS,
There are two terrible things about job season: the pressure and stress of the people around you, and the frustration and pressure you feel because of your friends’ stress and of how, when you think about it, short job season actually is. However, job season goes by surprisingly quickly, and you’re taking all the right steps to prepare for a job fair (even if you do feel a little rushed).  
But, I’m not gonna lie, it will be hard to waste your whole summer doing nothing – mostly because there are so many options for things to do. And, in my opinion, they’re all pretty fun and interesting too.
Carnegie Mellon is a great place to be during the summer. Carnegie Mellon offers a bunch of summer classes in popular courses, and gives you an opportunity to take classes that you wouldn’t be able to take during the school year. Carnegie Mellon also constantly advertises pre-college jobs, so applying for one of those positions is also a great option. You can also ask your professors to see if they will need research assistants over the summer.  In short, you’ll be able to work with a professor or grad student on their study and learn a lot more about what Carnegie Mellon faculty work on outside the classroom.  Additionally, Pittsburgh summers are a lot nicer than Pittsburgh winters, and the weather ranges from nice, sunny, and perfectly temperate to a boiling but welcomingly hot. 
You can also plan to go abroad, either to study or apply for an internship. A few study abroad programs have summer terms and give you the option to take classes, hold internships, or even both. Most students who study abroad, during any term, only take two classes, along with their internship.  However, that still gives you a lot of time and a lot of great opportunities for you to explore the city – and the continent – around you and immerse yourself in a new culture. 
But in all honesty, it is perfectly OK to take a break and relax during your freshman summer. It’s perfectly OK to return to your old summer job in your hometown and to just have a great time with your friends and family. In your future, you’ll get internships and jobs in a bunch of different places far away from your home, and you may not get a moment soon to see all your family and friends together again in one place. So, take a moment this summer to pause, reflect, and take a breather from your first jam-packed year of college, from the comfort of your own home.
Hope these options help,
Izzy

Last weekend was a bit crazy. In addition to our narrated experience at Mario’s in the previous edition of The Tartan, I also imbibed some whiskey on Thursday and wine on Saturday. In an effort to tone down a developing habit, my friends and I decided to treat ourselves to a weekend brunch instead. It’s the perfect setting for a good time where drinking is not the only social activity available, but it is at the same time wholly welcomed. And the perfect place for both booze and brunch? The Yard. 
The location: Its location is prime for the Shadyside/Squirrel Hill dweller like myself. Located on Bellefonte Street, right off of Walnut Street, The Yard sits next to a parking garage and across from a parking lot, giving drivers plenty of options. It’s also easily accessible by foot from campus or by the 71 bus. It is situated among shops, boutiques, and bakeries, giving the perfect opportunity for late morning leisurely strolls and window shopping. 
The drinks: I was a little tired out from drinking, so I can’t speak on the cocktails they offered. However, we did notice they were a little on the expensive side. If you know you can drink your fill, though, they do offer bottomless mimosas for $15. That’s a decent deal if you deal your cards right. For slightly cheaper, you can help yourself to a Bloody Mary bar! The variety of drinks the Yard has is admirable. In addition to the brunch menu, anything from the lunch menu is available as well, making it possible for you to order one of their dozens of draft beers. They offer appropriate coffee-flavored concoctions as well, from a vanilla bean coffee cocktail to rum-spiked cold brew. 
The vibe: The Yard is definitely not the classic brunch atmosphere — it lacks the white walls, all glass, avocado toast aesthetic. It’s casual and laid-back, with the music playlist they would use during lunch or dinner time still playing. We didn’t mind at all. Young adults around were enjoying themselves, and the room was playful but not too loud. We sat at a corner table that awarded us some privacy and comfort, but we still were able to enjoy the vibe. 
Lit or nah: The Yard is known for having some lit moments — it’s iconic for its trivia nights. But with brunch, I think people are sleeping on that. Their brunch menu is extremely good with a balance of savory and sweet classics. My chicken and waffles dish was the bomb, and their beignet pancakes were poppin’. The crowd, however, was minimal. You can always play it safe and call in for a reservation. That could be a good thing if you’re trying to get a table, but there were plenty of seats open. I don’t think people know about the lit-tential of their brunch experiences without going to The Yard. Definitely give this place a try next time the line for Pamela’s is a bit too long.

On any random day circa 2015, there existed the off chance everyone could find a contemporary cultural icon to relate to. With players such as Kanye, J.Lo and even Ru Paul on scene, the feeling of a diverse norm within the entertainment industry seemed almost guaranteed, even if it would only come to fruition in a distant future. Yet, over the past few months, BROCKHAMPTON and their many artistic ventures have proven that this diverse future within the arts may come sooner than we believed, and all at the hands of the same generation demanding it. 
It was a cold day in Philadelphia when I arrived for the BROCKHAMPTON concert; the winds were rough, the snow steadily falling, and the sun hidden deep behind gray clouds overlooking the city. The streets were barren apart from the few pedestrians that hurriedly rushed to their destination in an attempt to avoid the frigid outdoors, but in an alleyway some fifty feet away from the Theatre of Living Arts there sat a group of twenty or so kids patiently withstanding the weather for one purpose. Approaching this group, one thing became clear: there is no room to question that they are a part of something much larger than music. 
Anyone who has witnessed the line for a BROCKHAMPTON concert will tell you that they are not merely concert-goers. Being a fan of music means you delight in the art, but being a fan of a boy band means you’re a part of the culture, and those who follow BROCKHAMPTON exemplify this well. Diverse, unique, and curious, the fans that gathered to watch the show portrayed a new generation in nearly every sense. Finding each other through the internet, just as BROCKHAMPTON did themselves, their bonds transcended age or geography. Instead their relationships were formed under the similar beliefs that attracted them to the boy band in the first place. These were the outcasts, the unacknowledged, and often ignored kids of communities ranging all over. These were the people of color who felt unsafe and unwanted, the groups who didn’t fit into the norms of their communities, the gay kids who lived in homophobic environments, and everything in between. These were kids who had taken a step back and realized they disagreed with their homes, their states, and their societies and wanted to make a change.  
“Question everything,” they reminded me, quoting the very name of the group’s label and diving deep into discourse about these notions of identity. It is not easy to find a fandom that so consistently engenders the group they follow, yet BROCKHAMPTON’s fanbase does so to a "T," always able to relate to someone’s experience out of the 14+ member boy band. Every hour that lead up to the show seemed to only make the fans grow more wild with excitement, and, when the show opened, the feeling in the air was palpable. 
Sometimes what you need most is tangible proof that the world is changing to begin believing it. Through their work, their actions, and the space they are creating, BROCKHAMPTON mirrors a growing generation of people no longer willing to wait for the art they consume to represent them. Instead they exemplify the future they desire and share it through the means of their talents. BROCKHAMPTON’s music has become an anthem to those groups that have been ignored and underrepresented and their fandom a refuge for those without a space or community willing to accept them. Their music gives those who seek representation words to scream, to sing, and to cry out, feeling unity in knowing they are a part of something larger while doing so.  It is a cultural manifesto expressed through the art of their craft, and it is already visibly taking shape in the crowds that attend their shows. Without realizing it, these fans have become the hand that propelled the group forward into the mainstream, allowing for a platform that has no choice but to give attention to those who previously lacked it and forcing the industry to question their standard. What becomes mainstream? What is accepted under that category? Abiding by what rules? Through what sacrifice? 
It is through the power of people like the fans of BROCKHAMPTON that we can find representation in an industry that so persistently continues to lack it. It is important to acknowledge the necessity and brilliance of being spoken for by those who can and those who will do it justice: to thank not only the artists but also the culture that cultivates them and their message. BROCKHAMPTON and every fan that has allowed them the opportunity to shine exist as a product of a multitude of others that preceded them, all fighting for the same future. Let this stand as a love letter to every fan that follows an art which represents a revolution. Let this be a love letter to the growing generation of those who strive to create a platform in which success is possible for the underrepresented. This one's for you.

When I first walked into Faith Wilding’s Fearful Symmetries exhibit at the Miller Gallery, the first thing that caught my attention was a TV screen. On the screen was Wilding, rocking back and forth in a chair as she recites her monologue, "Waiting." In the monologue, Wilding lists everything she is “waiting for” at different stages in her life, from her "first date" to her "baby to stop crying" to her "first gray hair." The piece purposefully illustrates the events of a woman’s life in a mundane, repetitive manner, as though a woman goes about her life always waiting for something happen. As I watched and listened to Wilding perform on the screen, I started to feel a little emotional. Boiling down in such a way, the events of my life as a woman was eye-opening, and it reminded me how precious time really is. The other pieces in the Fearful Symmetries exhibit were just as thought-provoking, and they allow viewers to see the life and experiences of women from passionate, beautiful, and emotional perspectives. Wilding uses various media in her artwork displayed in the exhibit, from collages to drawings with colored pencil. The Fearful Symmetries exhibit has already traveled to several college campuses and art centers, and it was curated by Shannon R. Stratton. On Friday, Feb. 16 at 5 p.m., a talk with Faith Wilding herself will take place in the Miller Gallery. The event is free and open to anyone who is interested, so if you have time, definitely take advantage of this opportunity.

In keeping with tradition, this year’s 60th Annual Grammy Awards succeeded in elevating various artists to the international stage and failed in rewarding the safest of the bunch. For the second year in a row, an insulting winners pool was punctuated not a day later by infuriating comments from the top brass at the Recording Academy. Last year, after Adele’s forgettable 25 took the top honor of “Album of the Year” over the universally lauded Lemonade from Beyoncé, Recording Academy President Neil Portnow said, “I don’t think there’s a race problem at all.” Of course, there is a problem, as the last nine Album of the Year winners were all white.
This year, Bruno Mars broke the streak but did so in a fashion that was simultaneously frustrating and confusing. His album, 24K Magic, was a smashing success that took inspiration from the classic sound of artists like James Brown and infused it with modern pop. It’s a good pop album, and few contend this. However, the controversy here comes from the other nominees in the field: Lorde’s Melodrama, Childish Gambino’s Awaken, My Love!, JAY-Z’s 4:44, and perhaps most notably Kendrick Lamar’s DAMN. Lamar, who has now been nominated and lost three times for the night’s top honor, had the most critically acclaimed album of the year, the most commercially successful album in the field, and the largest cultural impact of any album last year. By most accounts, Lamar deserved the award. I think he deserved the award. Especially given that his 2015 album To Pimp a Butterfly devastatingly lost at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards for Album of the Year to Taylor Swift’s 1989. Lamar was at least due for a conciliatory win, even if DAMN. had not been the best album in the field. Moreover, his performance to open this year’s ceremony was explosive, expertly crafted, daring, and incredibly well-performed. He seemed perfectly set up to win "Album of the Year."
And then, Mars won “Best R&B Performance” over SZA. Then, he won “Song of the Year” and then “Record of the Year.” By the time the Album of the Year award was to be presented, it had become clear that Mars was going to win, and he did.
It is important to say here that Mars is the first person of color to win Album of the Year in nearly a decade, and as far as pop albums that have won the award in years past, 24K Magic is unquestionably better than most. It is the fact that Lamar has now lost in the category for three consecutive albums, with each one being completely different from the last. It is the Recording Academy’s ceaseless rejection of hip-hop as a legitimate art form. Two rap albums have won the top award in Grammys history, the last time being in 2004 with Outkast’s Speakerboxxx/The Love Below. Lamar’s impact on hip-hop and music at large is undeniable, and he will go down as one of the best artists of this decade and likely the best rapper of his generation. Why then, do the Grammys refuse to reward the revolutionary artist graciously waiting for his chance to celebrate?
Another frustrating category was “Best Pop Solo Performance,” which went to Ed Sheeran’s “Shape of You” over four female nominees. Sheeran, who did not attend the ceremony, presented a song literally about the objectification of women’s bodies, while nominee Kesha attended and performed a show-stopping rendition of her song “Praying,” a powerful song about her survival of sexual assault and harassment at the hands of her former producer. Later, the only female Album of the Year nominee Lorde did not perform, as she was the only nominee for the night’s top honor that was not offered a solo performance slot. When asked if he thought the Grammys had a gender issue, Portnow replied that women should “step up” in order to receive more nominations and awards.
Of course, Portnow has been met with major backlash. He has since issued an apology and announced the formation of a gender task force to address the show’s continued issues. Now, given the long history of controversy under his tenure, female music executives are calling for Portnow to resign, and he should. The Recording Academy has continually failed to address the biases at the core of its process, and Portnow should be replaced by someone committed to equitable representation for artists of all races, genders, sexual orientations, and genres. Otherwise, ratings will continue to fall, and the Grammys will lose what little credibility it has left.

Just after winter break, several Carnegie Mellon students and professors engaged in a Twitter discussion about the best practices for teaching coding. The thread was brought to awareness after former adjunct professor in the School of Computer Science, Robert Seacord, tweeted, “As a Carnegie Mellon professor, I didn’t spend a lot of time catering to struggling students. I think this diverts resources from those who are going to succeed and make a difference.”
The tweet has since been deleted but not before students could see and interact with it.
Tanvi Bajpai, a junior in the School of Computer Science and teaching assistant (TA) for 15-151/21-128, a class teaching the mathematical foundations for computer science, replied to Seacord’s tweet with a thread about the importance of helping struggling students. 
Another student took screenshots of Seacord’s tweet as well as Bajpai’s replies and posted them to the Facebook page “Overheard at Carnegie Mellon.” This post has received over a thousand reactions and comments.
Most of the Carnegie Mellon students and faculty members who responded to Seacord’s tweet, both online and offline, strongly disagreed with the opinion presented in the tweet and felt that it was not representative of the school overall. 
In an interview with The Tartan, Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science Professor David Kosbie said in response to the tweet, “No matter what one person may say, if they hold an opinion that [Carnegie Mellon] professors are [not devoted] to their students, they hold a wrong opinion. Not just a minority opinion: a wrong opinion. In my experience, [Carnegie Mellon] professors are truly devoted to their students. They may express this in many different ways, but that truth lies at the core.”
Kosbie, who has many times taught the popular introductory computer science course 15-112, has ample experience handling coding beginners and struggling students. Kosbie stresses that figuring out how best to help struggling students can be complicated, as introductory coding students can be quite a diverse bunch in terms of their experience and what they need to learn best.
“There are many ways to help struggling students,” Kosbie says. “Office hours, tutoring, advising, being sure they are aware of and using their resources well, perhaps helping them seek counseling, helping them live healthily and keep a balanced perspective. The list goes on and on. And none of these is a panacea. No one approach will work all the time. So faculty need to be creative as well as observant, to reflect on a student’s very individual situation, and find the best approach for that one struggling student.”
With some struggling students, it can be unclear what a professor should do. Kosbie raises the example of a student who is not putting in enough effort for whatever reason, be it a lack of belief in their ability, a lack of sleep, or a lack of motivation. “Sometimes, heroic intervention can help such a student pass a course. Sometimes not. In the latter case, however, maybe in some cases failing the course can be the best learning outcome for them — if they self-reflect, consider why they failed, and consequently modify their behaviors to be more successful thereafter. Isn’t that then a success? What should the professor do in such a case? I am not saying they should simply let the student fail, but neither am I saying that that is obviously uncaring or inappropriate.”
As for Seacord’s tweet, Kosbie believes that a professor cannot determine which students will end up succeeding a making a difference on the basis of one homework assignment or one course at one time. He says, “I defy a faculty member to determine with any confidence all their students who will be the most successful over time. I have seen students struggle, and struggle, and struggle, and struggle. And finally, finally, get it, and then shine brightly! And I have hired such students to TA. And I have seen them go on to brilliant careers. In fact, in many, though certainly not all, such cases, their struggles were somehow essential for their future successes.”
Iliano Cervesato is another School of Computer Science professor who often teaches the introductory course, 15-122. Cervesato agrees with Kosbie that the needs of students in such courses are widely varied. “15-122 introduces computer science to a large swath of the student population on campus — 800-900 altogether in the current academic year, a number equal to about half this year’s freshmen class. With size comes diversity: some students have years of programming experience, while others have had exposure to no more than the basics; some are committed to pursuing computer science as a career, others don’t know much about it and just want to check it out,” Cervasato said in an interview with The Tartan.
Regardless, he believes that it is a Carnegie Mellon professor’s job to help all struggling students: “Struggling students are students who need a lot of help, and I think we do a good job making opportunities to seek help available to them. In fact, I see this as an obligation on our part, within the bounds of the resources available to us.” 
One such bound is the time availability of TAs. Cervesato explains, “We are blessed in that the university provides us with lots of resources in the form of a large number of wonderful, knowledgeable, caring and truly dedicated TAs... Now, we need to remember that TAs are students too, with their own coursework, deadlines and other obligations. Because of this, I encourage my TAs to set boundaries.”
Although many Carnegie Mellon computer science professors intend to provide the resources for success for all students regardless of struggle, many of the comments on the Facebook post were from people saying they had experienced the brunt of Seacord’s philosophy, that they needed to be “weeded out” of a Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) field in order to make room for brighter students. 
For some, this mentality started in the very first week of college: “When I was an incoming [Computer Science] freshman, our advisor told us that our first two years will be like a ‘boot camp,’ and I remember how freaked out I was about that, initially,” Bajpai told The Tartan.“We know that we’re supposed to work hard, and so we turn that into a competition: who stayed up the latest? Who got the least amount of sleep? Who has gone the longest without a shower?”
What Bajpai is describing is a stress culture, a system in which it is expected, required, and normalized that people be stressed out to the detriment of their happiness, relationships, and well-being. It has long been documented that Carnegie Mellon has a stress culture, and it is especially prevalent in the STEM majors.
According to Bajpai, stress culture is enabled by the idea that constant competition in STEM is beneficial to those fields. “What I’ve noticed about this whole ‘weeding out kids in STEM’ mentality is that most people that think like this believe that that’s why classes in STEM are hard, like, we make STEM hard because we only want the best of the best doing it,” Bajpai explained. “That’s just absurd. Classes in STEM are hard because the subject is difficult.”
Bajpai believes that in order to combat the stress culture at Carnegie Mellon, the focus should be shifted from grades and assignments to learning. “Taking the time to learn the material is more important then spending all the time in the world to desperately try to finish one assignment in a class. I think professors here already try to encourage that kind of mentality,” she contends. “But most students have associated some kind of glory with staying up super late or not eating or showering... I think we need to not perpetuate and advertise that ‘glory’ to incoming classes.” Bajpai explains that this is why she wrote in her tweets about being lucky to have people stay up late with her and make sure she understood a subject rather than finished an assignment.
For anyone looking to teach, Professor Kosbie advises to “not judge the struggling student. Help them as best you can, and shower them with love and support. And if they fail, as some surely shall, still be there for them to help turn that into the best failure possible for them, that they may grow and be stronger for it.”
Seacord refused to comment when The Tartan reached out in order to get his response to the reaction to his tweets by the Carnegie Mellon University community.

There are few figures in history that evoke as much admiration, disdain, and often heated debate as Karl Marx. In celebration of his influential and controversial life and work, attendees of the Marx@200 events organized by The Humanities Center will gather to discuss his writings and the various ways they have been applied since their inception. Whether you’re a dyed-in-the-wool libertarian or hammer and sickle-sporting communist, Marx@200 events offer a nuanced take on Marxist thought in the modern day.
If Karl Marx were alive today, it would be his 200th birthday. 2018 also marks the the 170th birthday of Marx’s most-referenced work, The Communist Manifesto, and 2017 marked the 150th birthday of another famed piece of his, Capital: Critique of Political Economy. Scholars of Marx across the world have used these birthdays as a special opportunity to discuss his influential writing.
At Carnegie Mellon University, Marx@200 will join in this worldwide examination of Marx’s work with a series of lectures, performances, and even art installations. The Humanities Center at Carnegie Mellon, which emphasizes the importance of research and interdisciplinary studies and seeks to create a larger role for the study of humanities, is behind this commemoration, hoping that it will, according to their website, “explore Marx’s critique of inequality and capitalism as well as his influence on political movements and political regimes, including totalitarianism.” This past Tuesday, they hosted the first event of the semester.
The lecture and panel discussion was called “Marx and the Global South,” and featured four distinguished professors and their opinions on how Marxism has been applied to the global south, including their critiques of it. Though there were seemingly obvious examples panelists could have drawn on, from Ché Guevara’s revolution to communism in Southeast Asia, the lecturers tackled obscure and fascinating subjects untouched by even the most well-read Marxists.
Marian Aguiar, Associate Professor in the Department of English at Carnegie Mellon University, started the discussion with an acknowledgment of Marx’s ungainly westernized perspective related to India, but resolved to say that “the global working class should have various contextual changes” and could benefit from Marxist ideals. The next speaker, University of Pittsburgh Associate Professor in the Department of English, Susan Andrade, riffed on material from her cultural studies course, “Uneven Development and Cultural Production,” which focuses on the idea that “Marx teaches that economic relations are uneven between different classes of people, that unevenness is the condition of capitalism,” according to her website.
The next speaker was Paul Eiss, a Carnegie Mellon History Professor, who spoke about how the “geographic struggle, rent-seeking behavior, and price increases” in Latin America make the region conducive to Marxist theory, and also spoke about how a Marxist community in Mexico known as Cherán has thrived and became a “poster child of movements.” He was followed by Shalini Puri, Associate Professor in the Department of English at the University of Pittsburgh, who gave a riveting explanation of her Marxist beliefs and how they have influenced her studies in the Caribbean.
As these descriptions may suggest, the short lectures were dense, by design, in order to foster a thoughtful discussion. Most of the professors were seemingly sympathetic toward Marxist ideology, but I suspect much of the Baker Hall room was diverse in thought, judging by the quality of discussion. Anyone interested in Karl Marx, whether he represents ideological perfection or the bane of political theory, could have enjoyed the educational event this past Tuesday.
As previously mentioned, this was only the first event of the semester. The next is a lecture by Jessie Ramey of Chatham University, on “Gender and Inequality in the Age of Neoliberalism.” Throughout the rest of the semester, more lectures, discussions, art installations, and a reception will be held. For a full schedule, visit https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/humanities-center/center-events/marx-200-events.html.
Karl Marx, whether one is sympathetic to his message or not, is someone worth studying further and his 200th birthday gives perfect reason to coalesce around a complex and controversial subject such as Marxism. At Carnegie Mellon, The Humanities Center has provided an accessible means of celebrating the figure by organizing Marx@200.

The Pittsburgh Promise scholarship announced on Jan. 29 its intention to implement significant reforms beginning with the current class of seniors in Pittsburgh’s public high schools. The changes involve lowering the maximum scholarship amount from $7,500 to $5,000 per year, while broadening full eligibility status to a larger population of students.
Previously, the scholarship amount was determined using a “sliding scale” which gave more money to students who had been attending Pittsburgh Public Schools for a longer time. A student who has been in the school district since kindergarten used to be eligible for more than someone who transferred to the district in middle school, for example. But starting with the high school class of 2018, students who meet certain criteria (namely a 2.5+ GPA, attendance record of 90+ percent, and acceptance into a college in Pennsylvania,) can receive up to the full scholarship amount so long as they have been attending a traditional public or public charter high school in Pittsburgh since the ninth grade.
Two other efforts to widen the group of scholarship recipients will soon take effect as well. The first is the establishment of a $1,000 minimum scholarship to students who receive a full ride to college via another scholarship program. The second change is the ability to spend scholarship money on room, board, and textbooks in addition to tuition.
These reforms are especially important to students whose tuition are covered by other scholarship programs but nonetheless struggle to afford other college expenses. While critics argue that this money could be better spent helping students whose tuition is not fully covered, The Pittsburgh Promise explained in a press release that these efforts are in response to a University of Pittsburgh study,, which stressed the importance of room and board support for low-income college students.
While the current cohort of Carnegie Mellon University students who receive the scholarship will be unaffected by the changes, the news has major implications for future classes of Carnegie Mellon students from Pittsburgh. This is especially the case because the number of Pittsburgh Promise Scholars at Carnegie Mellon has been on the rise for the past several years. Brian Hill, Carnegie Mellon’s Director of Student Financial Services, wrote in an email to The Tartan that the Pittsburgh Promise “greatly reduces the self-help (loans and work) resources that Pittsburgh Promise recipients would otherwise need to cover their educational expenses.”
On top of being one of the many eligible colleges for the Pittsburgh Promise, since Sep. 2017, Carnegie Mellon has been a “Preferred College Partner,” one of 19 Pennsylvania colleges and universities that provide additional support to ensure the success of Pittsburgh Promise Scholars. According to Hill, the financial aid office hopes that this effort will do something to make up for the decreased maximum scholarship resulting from the recent program reforms.
By choosing to be a Preferred College Partner, Carnegie Mellon is allocating some of its limited financial aid funds specifically for Pittsburgh Promise Scholars in order to improve the University’s relationship with its surrounding community. When asked in an interview why such an approach was chosen over allocating the money to the general financial aid pool, Hill defended the decision. “It’s part of being a Pittsburgh citizen,” he said. “The program has been great to our students who have come here through the Promise, and we want to make sure that it continues.”

The Undergraduate Student Senate’s Campus Life committee recently launched a new campus outreach initiative in the form of the Humans of CMU Facebook page. Originally based on Brandon Stanton’s viral Humans of New York Instagram account, Humans of CMU aims to showcase many of the unique and compelling stories that walk on our campus every day. The goal is to display the diversity of perspectives that our community has to offer, by profiling different organizations, individuals, and events on our campus. Humans of CMU will provide a central spotlight on the diversity, community, and unity that exists at the heart of the Carnegie Mellon community.
Initially, Humans of CMU wants to publish a series of interviews with influential student leaders on campus, aiming to show the variety of backgrounds that Carnegie Mellon University hosts. Student leaders are unique and often have compelling stories about their paths thus far that aren’t always visible from the outside. Humans of CMU aims to delve deeper into those moments and leverage the uniquely potent portrait-interview format to begin to tell those stories in a way that we can all relate.
Campus Life committee recognizes the ability of a variety of different figures to provide impactful insights that shape the experience of everyone on campus. In light of that, Humans of CMU will be reaching out to faculty and campus leaders as well as students, aiming to include their perspective and foster a culture of understanding where students and faculty can bond over shared cultural experiences and the joy of life’s most meaningful moments.
Moving forward with the project, the Campus Life committee aims to keep a consistent engagement with different aspects of our campus by creating special themed weeks that create a more focused view the various activities that shape the lives of all our students — for example, Humans of CMU will host “Athletics Week” and “Technology Week,” allowing the students and community members who are immensely dedicated to those activities to share their passion and illustrate the diversity that permeates our campus just below the surface.
Interviews are currently being conducted on campus, both through existing student leadership channels and through the classic, serendipitous approach utilized by the original Humans of New York. For those who have a story to share, please reach out to us too! Stay tuned on Senate’s Facebook page at www.facebook.com/cmusenate. Interested students will be contacted by Ryan Dumas to further the interview process.
Finally, Humans of CMU is just getting off the ground — check out the current Facebook post, and be sure to share the link with other members of our campus to spread awareness and discussion of the diversity, inclusion, and unity that our campus is capable of.
Please direct any inquiries, comments, or suggestions about this initiative to Ryan Dumas at wdumas@andrew.cmu.edu.

With the opening ceremony of the PyeongChang 2018 Olympics fast approaching on Feb. 9, South Korean society has mobilized at an effort to successfully host 50,000 participants and staff from 95 countries at the winter Olympic and Paralympic Games. From the continuous hard work of the 129-member organizing committee to the thousands of volunteers who have dedicated countless hours to the training and preparation of the event to the ordinary citizen eager to welcome an international crowd to their home country, the past year for Koreans has been one of a common mission and purpose. 
The observed general unity, however, is an oversimplification of the social sentiments revolving around the Olympic games. Since 2011 when PyeongChang was selected as the host city, there has been much debate surrounding the broader goal of hosting such an event. Government officials have argued since its inception that the Olympics would promote peace in the region, creating opportunities for the two Koreas to hold talks and to display to the international community that the peninsula is one of peace and not one of conflict. Such a discussion about the role of the Olympics in relationship with the two nations has revealed a creeping divide within Korean society about relations with the North. 
This growing divide among Koreans has much to do with an increased presence of a conservative political faction, led by the Liberty Korea Party, and a generational gap that has become increasingly out of touch with much of Korean contemporary history — a story of divided families, a divided economy, and most significantly, a divided nation that has worked arduously to position itself in the 21st century and has struggled greatly to seek a unique South Korean national identity. 
Such an increased internal divide has not been well-documented in Western media, yet the evidence of its existence can be most patently seen in South Korea's response to Kim Jong Un's New Year's Speech.
"North Korea's participation in the Winter Games will be a good opportunity to show unity of the people and we wish the Games will be a success," said Kim in his address. "Officials from the two Koreas may urgently meet to discuss the possibility." 
While for many this was a message of hope — a historic stepping stone for reunification of the two Koreas — others saw this as an act of deception, driven by ulterior motives and a desire to take the spotlight away from South Korea. The Moon administration's seemingly all-embracing cooperation with the North — the hosting of reunification talks, the welcoming of North Korean athletes, performers, and officials, and an agreement to field a joint women's ice hockey team, to name a few — has been met with both support and criticism.
"Maintaining peace between the North and South is the most urgent issue," said Park Cheol-hyun, in an interview with Channel News Asia, who came to cheer on the debut of the joint women's ice hockey team with his family last Sunday. "It's important to achieve that through the Olympics and I think the unified team is very meaningful." 
Meanwhile, on Jan. 22, groups of protesters gathered at Seoul's central train station protesting the decisions made by the administration with banners reading, "We're opposed to Kim Jong Un's Pyongyang Olympics!" The backlash has been accompanied by a seven percent drop in President Moon's approval ratings.  
While I empathize more with the optimists, believing that the Olympics could indeed spark a period of increased collaboration with the North, I do have my hints of doubt about the motives of the Kim regime. Many experts have offered a wide array of explanations on Kim's sudden change in tone, such as attacking South Korea's relations with the U.S., presenting the North as being cooperative at an attempt to relieve U.N. sanctions, or buying time to produce more nuclear weapons in midst of a crippling North Korean economy. 
However, though I do not associate myself with the social conservatives in the South, I comprehend the complaints and criticisms of many of the Moon administration's agreements with the North. It seems to me that, after decades of a tumultuous and emotionally-draining history of the South, there now exists a more evident and unique South Korean identity. It is an identity fueled by a story of perseverance in light of conflict and division, military coups and dictators, and extreme economic hardship. In this context, some of the administration's decisions — which have been made in the name of furthering efforts at reunification — may seem to have gone too far in disregarding this new national identity: for instance, the flying of a flag of the Korean peninsula instead of a South Korean flag or the fielding of a joint women's ice hockey team instead of a full South Korean roster. 
The administration, therefore, must be well-aware of this precarious situation. Indeed, the support for reunification still remains strong amongst South Koreans, and Moon still reigns a solid 66 percent approval rating. However, a moderate approach is necessary in these heated times, and the more apparent South Korean identity must be respected and recognized. 
As for the average South Korean, like me, who does not really know how to feel about these changes, we will cheer on both the North and the South Korean representatives in all their sports endeavors at the upcoming PyeongChang winter Olympic games.

Make no mistake: Donald Trump is still Donald Trump. The State of the Union address was one many expected to mark a continued pattern of deranged ramblings in public appearances, yet what we saw was very different. Namely, Trump stuck to the teleprompter. The speech shared little rhetorically with Trump's usual Twitter outbursts and hyperbolic attacks. It was undoubtedly written by his team of advisors, some of whom are competent enough to construct coherent English sentences unlike the President. Trump's signature off-script quips of "terrible" and "carnage" were nowhere to be found. 
And yet, the terrible policies behind his typical insultingly simplistic language remained. He spoke of the need for a southern border wall and reinforced his apparent unwillingness to negotiate on immigration, despite empty calls for bipartisanship that he has in days since thrown to the wayside. Noticeably absent were calls for the border wall to be paid for by Mexico. While nothing has changed on Mexico's position on the matter — they have repeatedly, remarked that they will never pay for such a preposterous wall — Trump's personal position remains unchanged. In opportunities where Trump gets to speak freely, he still insists Mexico will pay. This notion is just as absurd now as it was when he first introduced the idea years ago and so too is Trump himself. 
So, Trump's tendency to completely fabricate statistics that aid his position continued. Has unemployment been going down? Yes. Is it the lowest it has been since the market crash of 2008? Also yes. But, just as Republicans attempted to shift the blame for the 2008 financial crisis from Bush to Obama, they also now seek to take credit for Obama's economic successes. Trump claimed that "since the election, we have created 2.4 million new jobs." According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, that number is actually 1.8 million. Moreover, that is the slowest rate of jobs growth since 2010. So no, the impact of their controversial tax cut bill has not been instant and it is certainly not responsible for the continued improvement of the economy.
Perhaps the most egregious example of Trump's statistical cherry-picking comes in the form of African American employment. During the campaign, Trump falsely claimed that 58 percent of young African Americans were unemployed. In truth, the number was actually 19 percent as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Now, Trump not only accepts these statistics but claims that he is responsible for the change. The overall rate of African American unemployment was 7.7 percent when Trump entered the office and has only since fallen 0.9 percent. This suggests not that Trump has had a positive impact on the rate of African American employment, but rather that rate has so far been unaffected by his policies. Given Secretary of Education Betsy Devos' well-documented attempts to undermine the public school system under Trump's appointment, it would not be surprising to see the rate of African American unemployment soon start to increase.
During the 2016 election, the stock market was a giant bubble waiting to burst according to Trump. Now, he boasts about the soaring market and how substantive an impact his policies have had on it. (I know what you're thinking: what policies?) He claims the majority of tax cut benefits will go to the middle class when in truth they will disproportionately aid families earning more than $200,000 per year. As usual, Trump's truth is a lie.
So what should we take away from the State of the Union? Exactly what we should have taken away the moment Trump announced his candidacy: facts have no place in Trump's world. What I believe to be more important is the impact he has had in his first year in the Republican party. The GOP has been perpetuating half-truths and falsehoods regularly for decades now. They were and are often called out for it by the news media and the public. The difference is that now they feel invincible. Trump has shown that one can invent an entirely fictional reality to operate in and still be successful politically. Perhaps it is his celebrity status that gives him that power. It most certainly has to do with the color of his skin and his gender. But, it is important to remember that the Republican party also has the power to do the right thing. 
The only Republicans calling Trump out are not running for reelection. While the understanding persists that standing against Trump as an elected or running Republican is electorally irresponsible, so too should the "decency" that representatives, like Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ), love to preach. Republicans like Flake have nothing to lose. But, the United States has everything to lose. If the Republican party steers deeper and deeper into being a legislative vehicle for Trump, they jeopardize the federalist system established under the Constitution and the objective reality that we live in. If facts can be debated and if Senators can be unilaterally swung to serve the ludicrous wishes of the President, then we risk the democratic republic under which we all live.

You might have seen the headlines. Harvard University banned single-gender organizations in May 2016, but they are now being enforced for the first time. Those who decide on single-gender organizations are barred from holding leadership positions, including athletic team captains. This ban came after Harvard's poor policies regarding sexual assault came to light. But Harvard's banning of single-gender organizations takes away powerful female-only spaces, leading to the #HearHerHarvard movement, which is one I proudly support. 
The #HearHerHarvard focuses on the positives many women have found in sororities across the country. Even at Carnegie Mellon, I've seen students who are not a part of Greek Life question its importance. But here, just as in Harvard, Greek Life can serve as an important part of someone's undergraduate experience. Greek Life is not for everyone, but it has given valuable skills and experience I simply would not be able to find elsewhere.
While Carnegie Mellon currently has more first-year females enrolled than first-year males, Carnegie Mellon was a traditionally male school, and females in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) still have to combat stereotypes daily. Being in a sorority, I've seen firsthand the commonplace discrimination, especially of women of color, within STEM fields. Without the space afforded to me by Greek Life, I'm not sure I would have been as aware of the workplace discrimination these women face. 
But Greek Life has also provided sorority women the opportunities to help break the glass ceiling. Last semester, the Panhellenic Council provided a session with Professor Linda Babcock, who taught us how to negotiate for better salaries to help lower the wage gap. I would not have learned this information if it were not for Greek life.
Greek Life has also provided a space to talk about sexual assault, which is, unfortunately, a glaring issue at Carnegie Mellon — while the fraternities' role in sexual assault is often brought up, I'm not going to comment on this at this time; it's far too complicated of an issue to try and discuss in this article. My sorority has also provided a space for women to talk about these issues. It's not just recommending resources; I've had plenty of conversations in the living room of my sorority house on not only how we can better support survivors but also how we think we can terminate rape culture here at Carnegie Mellon. If it wasn't for Greek Life affording me this female-only space, I probably wouldn't be having these conversations, nor would I have realized how widespread an issue sexual assault is here at Carnegie Mellon. 
My sorority has also given me the basic ideals we were founded on: sisterhood and service. Last year, the Greek Community gave back to Camp Kesem and raised over $100,000. Through the philanthropy I've been able to participate in thanks to my sorority, I've realized my passion for service. Its also given me sisters who have been there to be my shoulder to cry on and celebrate my greatest moments so far as an undergraduate.
But, I will also agree that Greek Life can make improvements. We could do a better job with diversity and intersectionality, and this is a concern we are trying to address as a community. When Greek Life is done well, it can have tremendous benefits for not only its members but also its community. Greek Life at all schools is not perfect, but I have seen Greek Life here benefit its members in ways that are indescribable. I never once felt unwelcomed (or hazed, for that matter), and my sorority has allowed me to grow as a student, leader, and person, giving me a space to talk about women's issues. When they say "it's not four years, it's for life," they're not kidding; I will forever carry the lessons I have learned and am continuing to learn as a member of the Greek Community for the rest of my life.

On Dec. 12, 2017, the nation nervously waited for Alabama to choose between Republican Roy Moore, an alleged predator, or Democrat Doug Jones, a consistent advocate for civil rights throughout his career. However, 2017 did not see the last of suspenseful Senate elections between conventional candidates and strikingly unqualified candidates. On Nov. 6, Missouri must elect someone to represent its state in the House.
Here is where Republican candidate Courtland Sykes comes in the scene.
Sykes identifies himself as the "America First candidate" and has consistently shown support for President Donald Trump's campaign promises and policies. "If you like President Trump, then you and I see eye-to-eye," he proudly stated in his campaign video. Ultimately, he has a mission to "fulfill Trump's 'America First' agenda," which he believes is being "sabotag[ed]" by "globalists and Big Government."
His stance on immigration is just as firm as Trump's. "Immigration is out of control," he says as a video of a riot plays in the background. Generalizing all immigration as being a detriment to American society is both misleading and factually incorrect. At first glance, immigrants may be interpreted as an economic burden to a nation. However, the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania has shown empirical evidence which demonstrates the positive economic impact immigrants have left in this nation.  Welcoming immigrants has provided more opportunities for non-immigrants, and immigrants generally pay more in taxes than they consume in government services. Immigrants are responsible for a "disproportionately high share of patent filings, science and technology graduates, and senior positions at top venture capital-funded firms." The Apple device that you are probably reading this article with would not exist had it not been for a refugee's son. The contributions are endless. However, even without the overwhelming support that data can provide, isn't life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness reason enough for us to welcome Americans? Not according to Sykes' or Trump's definition of "Make America Great Again." 
He demands the swamp in Washington be drained. In his video, he defines this by having "no more RINOs [or Republican In Name Only]," flashing a video of Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-WI), and "no more liberals," showing an emotional Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-CT). He heavily advocates for a uniform conservative government that will not "stand in Trump's way." What Sykes, like many hyper-partisans, conveniently forgets is that the U.S. is a democratic republic, meaning there is not, nor should have, just one party ruling in Washington. We need representatives in the Senate who speak for the millions of Americans, not just the select portion who happen to have one specific political view. That is not to say that Democrats and Republicans have all lived together in harmony, but such blatant demonizing of the opposing party is a phenomenon that has not been seen to this extent.
Sykes' criticism does not end with his political life. He additionally drew sharp criticism for his equivocal answer to the question: "Do you support women's rights?" What should warrant a simple "yes" or "no" ended up being a five-paragraph essay in an interview and later posted on Facebook where he criticized gender equality. "I support women's rights, but not the kind that has oppressed natural womanhood for five long decades," he states. He expects to "come home to a home cooked dinner at six every night" and for his daughters to adopt a similar lifestyle to the one he and his fiancé have set up. Of course, there is nothing inherently wrong with traditional gender roles if that is what the couple desires. However, Sykes fails to differentiate personal beliefs and ethics. What he and his fiancee decide to do is up to them, but what other individuals and families do across America is not. Instead of encouraging all Americans regardless of sex to pursue the "American Dream," his paradigm discouraged just about half the U.S. population from pursuing their respective dreams.
Although the Senate candidates who have sparked controversy have generally been Republican, it is important to note that the GOP is not the only party that is susceptible to having candidates who are morally-questionable; the Democratic Party has beyond its fair share of dirt that must be exposed. The problem of creating a larger political division runs far deeper than differences or conflicts between parties. It greatly lies in the divisive mentality that any political party can internally generate.

Each year, the Grammys spark heated debate. In recent years much of the discussion has been centered around diversity and for good reason. Only a handful of black artists have won the three most prestigious awards — Album of the Year, Song of the Year, and Record of the Year — while many have been pigeonholed into categories like hip-hop, R&B, and “urban contemporary.” In fact, only one hip-hop artist has ever been awarded one of the three major awards: Outkast for Speakerboxxx/The Love Below in 2004. Clearly, the representation of minorities is an issue that needs to be better addressed and solved. 
However, another constant source of drama has been that the awards often end up being a popularity contest. Over the past few years, the main three awards have typically been given to the most popular artist of the year, as opposed to the artist who created the most artistically impressive or meaningful piece of work. For example, this year, Bruno Mars, who has produced some of the best pop songs since 2010, swept the board with singles “That’s What I Like” and “24K Magic” off his album 24K Magic. 
However, his catchy party track and love song from 2017 managed to beat out all of the nominations from what has been nearly unanimously deemed the best album of the year by critics: Kendrick Lamar’s DAMN. DAMN was Lamar's third powerful masterpiece in a row, featuring hard-hitting beats and angry but agile rapping, Lamar’s signature intricate storytelling style, and intense lyrics that delve into politics, fame, and faith. While Lamar handily won every rap category, he was unable to break through in any of the three mainstream divisions. In fact, despite already being considered among the greatest rappers of all time, Lamar has never triumphed in a major category, even having had all three of his studio albums nominated for Album of the Year. 
One of the main reasons why artists like Lamar get snubbed is because their music isn’t considered “safe” enough. The Grammys would rather dish out the awards to party tracks like Mars’ “Uptown Funk” or mushy love songs like Ed Sheeran’s “Thinking Out Loud” than an angry hip-hop track that deals with touchy issues like institutional racism and police brutality. This is not to say that Mars and Sheeran aren’t extremely talented pop musicians — they certainly know how to write an addicting melody and lyrics that easily get stuck in your head — but their art isn’t nearly as impactful or complex as Lamar’s. 
Such snubs can even happen within the genre-specific categories, with one of the most glaring examples being 2014’s award for Best Rap Album, where Macklemore and Ryan Lewis’ The Heist managed to beat out Kendrick Lamar’s good kid, m.A.A.d. city. The former album was incredibly popular that year, especially among non-hip-hop listeners and was best known for the pop anthem “Can’t Hold Us” and the silly “Thrift Shop.” good kid, m.A.A.d. city, on the other hand, was a gritty, plot-driven account of the dangers of growing up in Compton, California, the city where Lamar is from, and was deemed an instant rap classic. Here also, the Grammys chose to reward the safer, more mainstream artist.
While the way the Grammys hands out their awards is disappointing, it should not come as a surprise. They have consistently gotten it wrong for the past several years. Therefore, it might instead be helpful to investigate the causes and what they mean for the Grammys status as an awards show. 
We have to remember that the Grammys are essentially a once-a-year television show. They, like any show, are trying to cater to an audience and convince as many people to tune in as they can, and the audience that will get them the highest ratings is mainstream America. This explains why The Recording Academy tends to reward the most popular songs; the more people know the winning songs, the more they will enjoy watching and the more they will want to watch again the following year. 
Another part of attracting larger television audiences, especially as television ratings rapidly drop as more people switch to streaming, is to transition the awards show into more and more of a spectacle. This is just what the Grammys has done. Less of the actual handing out of the awards is being televised, with the only major categories and a few specific genre categories making the cut. Instead, much of the Grammys’ airtime is filled with radical performances and speeches from hosts and winners. This year, stand-out moments included Kesha’s moving response to sexual harassment with her song “Praying” and Camila Cabello’s support of the "Dreamers" protected by Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), an Obama-era immigration policy that was rescinded by President Trump, in a poignant speech.
This results in many viewers simply watching for the performances and speeches, rather than being invested in the actual results. Additionally, many people are more interested in the glamor of the "Red Carpet" than the awards themselves, looking to see what extravagant dresses and otherworldly makeup their favorite celebrities don for the event. Even if their favorite artist does not win, people are entertained by the increasingly theatric performances and the allure of the "Red Carpet."
Essentially, the Grammys are shifting away from being an awards show and instead becoming a sort of year-in-review concert. Yes, they still do give out awards, but they tend to highlight the most popular music each year rather than the most critically acclaimed, and fewer of these decisions are shown on television each year. Instead, the Grammys have become a celebration of excess: a competition for who can wear the wildest dress, who can have the most elaborate, mind-blowing performance, and who can make the boldest statement in their speech. It’s time to stop expecting the Grammys to be an accurate measure of the most artistic music of the year and instead just sit back and enjoy the show.
