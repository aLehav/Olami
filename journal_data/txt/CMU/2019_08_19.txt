This is Penalty Shouts, The Tartan’s sports column inspired by the The New Yorker’s column Daily Shouts. This satire-fueled column will focus on anything and everything funny in the sports world that is deserving of our comedic attention.
In a surprise press conference over the summer, Lebron James’s son, Lebron James Jr., announced his future intentions to “take my talents to Carnegie Mellon University.” A truly shocking move for the younger James, who goes by the nickname “Bronny,” he has decided to enter college early to complete his undergraduate degree before he declares for the NBA. Recently, there was some speculation that Adam Silver’s decision to change the colloquially known “One and Done” rule was precipitated by Bronny’s future high school graduation date, but Bronny decided to forget all that. He wants his college degree.
After hearing the announcement, the Athletic Director for Carnegie Mellon said, “We’re glad that Bronny has decided to attend our prestigious athletic institution, but he’ll need to focus on academics first. There’s a reason ‘student’ comes first in ‘student-athlete.’” Bronny chuckled at the thought. “There’s a reason I’m majoring in Computer Science,” Bronny said, “I’ll find some smarty-pants to do all my work, so I can focus on basketball.” The six foot and two inch, fourteen year-old Bronny then proceeded to give me a noogie; I guess I’m doing all his work next semester.  
Lebron James, Sr., was excited to learn about his son’s decision to attend Carnegie Mellon. He believes that if the basketball thing doesn’t work out, he’ll have a head start on a career because of Carnegie Mellon’s academic reputation, but James said, “My son could break Steph Curry’s ankles right now.” Safe to say, James is confident that the ‘basketball thing’ will work out. I wish I had Lebron James as my father. When I tell my parents that I want to be an astronaut, they say “Matt, you’re too tall,” and crush my dreams without remorse. If Lebron was my dad, he’d say, “Son, I love you. Chase your dreams,” and then he’d pay for a bone shrinking surgery. My parents would say, “Matt, that’s not possible. You can’t shrink your bones enough to become an astronaut.” Yes, I can, Dad. Lebron said I can.
Even Bronny’s godfather, Chris Paul, and future teammate Zaire Wade’s father, Dwayne Wade, are supportive of Bronny. They both attend Bronny’s AAU games whenever Lebron James, Sr., can’t make it. Paul and Wade both said they feel as if Bronny is the son they wish they had. Zaire Wade was not present for the comment. When I asked Paul and Wade about bone shrinking surgery, they looked at each other and laughed; they’re both considerably shorter than the NBA average height. Little did they realize, my dreams were fully crushed. I’ll never get to be an astronaut at this rate.

Even if you’ve only been on Carnegie Mellon’s campus for two days, you’ve probably been made aware that sports at Carnegie Mellon are not particularly exciting, but has anyone ever actually considered the reverse argument? That sports at our small to medium sized school are actually some of the most interesting things to watch? No, of course not. Everyone loves to bash Carnegie Mellon sports at large.
There’s something beautiful about going to watch sports at our school, and I’d recommend that everybody try to see at least one of your friends play the sport they’re passionate about. If you want to see random people you don’t know play mediocre sports, go to a Pirates game. Actually, I do also recommend going to PNC Park: it’s beautiful and tickets are dirt cheap. But what’s even better than dirt cheap? Free. And you get into all of our sporting events for free.
Most of my friends are the Carnegie Mellon archetype of socially inept nerds — I am, too — but sports are a good spot for your small social gathering. Get two or three friends and chat up a storm, while you watch that classmate of yours from your Interp class break some Case Western kid’s ankles. 
Maybe some of our sports teams don’t win all of their games, but caring about winning is for people who don’t care about the camaraderie engendered by the challenge of a sports game. Try out something new, and maybe, just maybe, you’ll enjoy it enough to feel like you can write about it for the Sports section for The Tartan. 
For the most passionate sports fan, coming to Carnegie Mellon may be a little slow compared to New York, Philadelphia, or Boston, but there are plenty of opportunities to make our small, slow campus a little faster. Take it upon yourself to show up with your friends at a football game with “TARTAN” spelled on your shirts. Yell loudly at the field: “Wow, you suck, field!” After the game, take a member of the opposing fan section out to the parking lot, and of course, ask them out to a nice dinner. And all of this in the name of making Carnegie Mellon a more passionate sports school. Be the change you want to see in the world. 
For the least passionate sports non-fan, try something new! You probably still won’t enjoy attending a sporting event, but you never know. College is the perfect time to try something new, and the worst case scenario is that you lose an hour of your time. However, attending with your friends makes that hour seem a little less like a waste and more like a fun side trip in the novel of your life. 
My final recommendation to any person new to Pittsburgh or wishing to rediscover its beauty is to attend Dollar Hot Dog Night at PNC Park. Dollar Dog Night can convert the most hardcore vegetarian into a carnivore for one night, and the best part is the lack of limits on how many times you can go back for more hot dogs. The purchase limit at one time is four hot dogs, but if you keep going back, you could probably approach Joey Chestnut’s record of 74 hot dogs. 
Carnegie Mellon may not be known for its sports, but it is known for its innovation. In spite of the lack of reputation for sports, the Athletic Department has announced that it will be coming out with ‘Sports 2’ soon, so get on the bandwagon while you still can.

If you’ve ever been to a rock concert, music festival, or any event that involves loud music, you might have seen a table of people handing out free earplugs. Staving off hearing loss has become a cause of growing global concern over the last few years. According to reports by the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. alone experienced a 31 percent increase in adolescent hearing loss between the years 1998 and 2006. Globally, it is projected that 1.1 billion people are at risk of developing hearing loss due to rising noise levels in recreational settings. 
Although hearing loss and deafness can come in many forms and have any causes, damage to structures within the ear due to excessive or prolonged noise is a rising cause for concern. This damage —  cochlear damage — is often permanent, ranging from mild to severe.  The cochlea, otherwise known as the “inner ear,” is filled with tiny hairs that bend in response to sound waves before transmitting the signal to the auditory nerve. 
But the hairs can break if they bend too far, killing the cells. And unlike the rest of the hairs on the human body, these hairs do not regrow, meaning any loss or damage is often permanent.
At least, that is what scientists have always thought. However, researchers at Johns Hopkins Medicine recently published a report detailing their discovery of a protein pair tied to the creation of inner ear hair cells. According to associate professor of neuroscience at the Johns Hopkins University Dr. Angelika Doetzlhofer in a Johns Hopkins press release, their research has the potential to “develop new treatment strategies for hearing loss.”
Based on experimentation with mice in their laboratory, the researchers examined the proteins involved in hair cell development and identified the two proteins primarily responsible: Activin A and follistatin. Activin A was mostly found where hair cells were being formed, while follistatin was found deeper in the cochlea, away from the hair cells.
This implied that their roles in hair cell development were related, but in fact, the opposite is true. Activin A flowed into the cochlea, inciting cell growth. But if there was too much of the protein too early in development, the hair cells grew prematurely throughout the cochlea. Conversely, follistatin flowed outwards, and its overproduction caused the cells to grow in a haphazard fashion. 
So, these proteins seem to play a delicate balancing act in the development of hair cells, ensuring that the cells grow exactly where they need to be. But their interaction must be precisely timed to ensure proper growth: "It's like building a house — if the foundation is not laid correctly, anything built upon it is affected,” said Dr. Doetzlhofer in a press release. 
Although the potential for treating hearing loss due to cochlear damage is there, the research is still in its fundamental stages, and it is too early to guess at what it might lead to. So until then, it might be best to keep the WHO safety guidelines in mind to protect your hearing.

Carnegie Mellon’s 140 acre campus is home to around 14,000 students, who all generate trash every day. For rising sophomore art major Julie Lee, what began as a fun assignment to collect trash items she finds on the campus grounds turned into a crusade to raise awareness of the trash we generate as a community. She started an Instagram handle for the project: @trashofcmu. The account’s bio describes it as “an archive recording weekly posts of trash found in Carnegie Mellon University campus and surrounding Pittsburgh areas”.
The project provides us with an inkling of the volume and variety of trash that we, as a community — as a campus — are producing everyday. Browsing through the pictures in @trashofcmu, we are confronted with the waste of different varieties, both mundane and weird. From dental flosses, candy wrappers, and hair clips, to band-aids, tampons, and even condoms, she has found them all laying around on the campus grounds. The items she collects are all meticulously collected in petri dishes before she photographs them and uploads the pictures to Instagram.
The birth of @trashofcmu came in the form of a class assignment. “My approach to this was...an archive project that would record my time during CMU that would not only reflect on me but would also reflect on the environment that I was in,” explained Julie, over a phone call. “This was based off a fun little assignment my professor Bob Bingham gave us. He just gave us these little petri dishes and he said ‘Go out on campus and collect stuff that you found on the ground and then come back.’” After seeing her enthusiasm for the project, he gave her a set of 20 petri dishes, and that’s how the project was born.
In social media, people’s attention is the greatest commodity — and that’s what Julie is hoping to attract with @trashofcmu. “This is going to be for four years — I’m going to be doing this for my entire undergrad years in Pittsburgh,” Julie said. “I figured, why not record this not only through something that’s contained that only I can see but on something that’s more public like Instagram where you could get more of the community involved and witness this time unravel, and how much stuff we have collected over four years of undergrad.”
One of the things that struck her the most during the time of the project so far was how much stuff we waste, especially how much traces we leave behind. “On an existential note, if you are worried about what you are leaving behind, I guess you shouldn’t fret because you leave behind a lot actually,” she said, wryly. Discussions about sustainability and waste shouldn’t ignore the very human faces behind every piece of trash found on the roadside, and floating above and under sea water. “Whether I know it’s you, or I think it’s someone else, someone has left this sticker behind.”
“Why does someone drop a Mamma Mia! sticker?” Julie’s voice is incredulous as she asks the question, as she recounts the volume and variety of the trash she has collected in barely an academic year. “In my time during this project, I — only one person — found at least five dental flosses in the CMU-Pittsburgh area, imagine how much has been laying around outside of that! That scale disturbs me, and I want to show how much we’re wasting, whether we know it or not.”
The variety of the trash she has collected is also surprising. “People have dumped jewelry; something really gross like chewed bubblegum; and sadly, health-items like tampons and condoms. Someone had dropped broken headphones. I saw broken glasses on the side of the road for at least two weeks before I was like, no, I’m picking these up for my project,” she said.
Explaining how she chose items to pick for the project, Julie said, “I want a balance between the fascinating and the mundane. On one hand, you’re seeing something predictable that you always see on the side of the road like pieces of wrappers, and occasionally, you find something interesting, like a ticket to AWRA or magnet of the number 8.” 
She hopes that viewers share the child-like curiosity and the fun she’s having with this project, but also the fact that our streets need to be cleaned up and the waste be disposed of responsibly. “If we aren’t already aware, just be aware of how our routines impact or interlap with other people’s routines and environments, and what we will leave behind.”
The trash depicted in @trashofcmu is only a tiny window into waste produced by one community in one city. There are thousands of such communities only in Pittsburgh and millions of cities and towns and villages around the world. If an environmentally-conscious campus like Carnegie Mellon struggles with environmental sustainability and waste-disposal issues, it’s a warning sign to increase awareness, to impart the urgency of the current situation of global climate change and how sustainability plays a major role in thwarting it. We, as a campus, should rise up for change — we should be the change we want to see in the world.
Follow @trashofcmu on Instagram for archival documentation of trash collected in Carnegie Mellon.

Beware: this movie is not as advertised. The Farewell is billed as a heartbreaking tearjerker of a movie, but the movie is more like a comedy with some tender moments. Its tender moments are often nostalgic and cathartic, rather than dramatic.
However, the only beat that truly misses the mark is the last two minute long attempt at catharsis, which reverses the most tender moment of the film. That isn’t to say the movie isn’t one of the most emotional, or one of the most successful, of the year to date, likely only rivaled by its A24 distribution companion, The Last Black Man in San Francisco.
The Farewell is a tight, technically sound piece of small budget Hollywood cinema that draws heavily from the American independent cinema of John Cassavetes through Andrew Bujalski and Joe Swanberg and the rest of the mumblecore crew. All of the long takes and unobtrusive editing allow the movie to create an atmosphere of something resembling naturalistic conversation, and the lack of a soundtrack, save a few key emotional moments that are obviously non-diegetic, resemble the technical creations of a mumblecore movie. There are just a few more bells and whistles in The Farewell, and obviously, a better camera.
Much like the 20- or 30-year-old unsuccessfully artistic and socially inept characters from which mumblecore has earned its name, Billi (a stellar Awkwafina) is a 31-year-old writer and Guggenheim Fellowship applicant who can’t afford to pay rent anymore. But instead of mumblecore’s emotionally incapable group of friends, Billi turns to her family for help. We quickly learn that her family is even more incapable of honest emotional communication than a group of 20-year-olds that are stuck in an extended adolescence.
Another advertisement billed the movie as dressed in tradition, but the only appearance of tradition is a fake wedding ceremony and the withholding of information from Billi’s Nai Nai (grandmother), played by Zhao Shuzhen, about her lung cancer. Supposedly the premise of the movie, the lie is a simple piece of dramatic irony to keep some semblance of plot in an otherwise plotless movie. Otherwise, the lie is not important. It doesn’t register as a tradition to many of the characters in the movie; it’s just something people do, similar to how you won’t tell a decrepit old man that he’s dying. The lie is less an active impropriety on the part of the family than a willful ignorance of the proximity of death. Nobody wants to hear they’re dying, especially when death is close anyway.
The advertising of the movie, while commercially successful scoring a sound 11 million dollars at the box office already, bears little relation to the content of the movie.
The Farewell is about the small conversational moments around a dysfunctional family: the multiple men in the family who lie about their smoking habit, Billi’s father with a drinking problem, the relations who stayed in China that hold a grudge against the relations who left, and most importantly, the inability to communicate emotions with any success.
Much like Noah Baumbach’s The Squid and The Whale (he later wrote and directed the most successful mumblecore movie, Frances Ha), the family in The Farewell is middle to upper class with a significant amount of dysfunction, but the most interesting parts of each movie come with the main character learning to understand a split identity. In The Squid and the Whale, Jesse Eisenberg’s character is split between understanding his two divorced parents; in The Farewell, Billi is caught between her American and Chinese worlds.
One moment in one of the previews where Billi’s uncle says, “That’s the difference between East and West,” and continues to say the least impactful line of the movie is the least interesting discussion of Billi’s understanding of family and her identity in a family caught between the States and China. The line feels out of place in the movie, as if it was put there only for advertising purposes. Otherwise, Billi’s introspection regarding her role as an independent, future matriarch is special. The parallels between Billi and Nai Nai are undeniable. Nai Nai is Billi’s mentor. She is preparing Billi for her future role; it’s part of why Nai Nai keeps asking after Billi’s romantic life. The other part being, of course, the always comedic awkward grandmother role.
Yet, the role of independent matriarch is one tempered by a dependence on the family around you, and the two most impactful images of the film deploy both Billi’s understanding of her Chinese-American identity and her identity as the Nai Nai of the future. In a transitory moment between two narrative points, Billi walks on a Chinese street at the head of her family with a stern smirk adorning her face, but after her return to the States, Billi walks through New York City surrounded by strangers in three-piecesuits and hi-vis construction vests looking lost in a world where she no longer has a family on which to depend.

Toni Morrison, the celebrated American author, died two weeks ago on Aug. 5 at the age of 88 due to complications from pneumonia. Her role in the contemporary American canon can never be overstated. Novels like The Bluest Eye, Song of Solomon, Sula, Jazz, and Morrison’s magnum opus, Beloved, have earned their way into colleges and high schools across the country.
My first interaction with Morrison’s work was during my last year of high school, when we read The Bluest Eye. This novel is likely the best place to start with her work, as it is a slow introduction into Morrison’s way of writing, which is usually accessible; however, the reasons her work is often categorized as ‘magical realism,’ can make her work more idiosyncratic than most popularly loved writers. It is also, in part, the reason why her writing is so critically acclaimed, with many colleges offering classes where her novels and criticism are prominent, or even the only work read in the class.
Moments like the ending of The Bluest Eye, where the main character’s eyes turn blue, or the ending of Song of Solomon, where the main character learns to fly, are where Morrison’s work powers its way into the popular and critical American conscience. Her novels are masterful explanations and explorations of how to deal with trauma dealt by a dominant class. They show us the myths and legends people have used to make the world a little less scary. Song of Solomon borrows the myth of Ibo Landing and puts it into a more contemporary setting. Beloved makes the horror story, the rural house haunted by a ghost, into a story about the trauma of losing a child, the historical trauma of losing a child, and how a mother interprets and handles all of that pain.
Throughout all of her work, Morrison deftly handles the intersections of class, gender, and most obviously, race. But narrowing interpretations of her work just to the standard issues of modern social justice limits the wide ranging fiction she has produced over the years. In one of her last novels, A Mercy, one of the main themes of her work from the beginning, class, is centered more than many of her earlier novels, but Morrison’s understanding of social justice extends beyond feel good representations of characters of color. There is a real understanding of the way our social history of race and gender and class is woven together to form a world system that has dealt out pain among the people that are closest in our lives: our significant others, our parents, our siblings, our children.
Beyond a critical attempt to understand Morrison’s canon, the stories she tells and how she tells them are beautiful. She is an expansive writer with comparisons to be found in some of the other critically acclaimed modernists, like William Faulkner and Virginia Woolf. Since her passing, many of her quotes have been thrown around the internet like soundbites of her writing, but a sentence or two doesn’t capture Morrison’s ability to build a story into that quote.
Morrison fills both the aesthetic demands of the critic and the sublime beauty of the popular taste. Both sides of myself loved what Morrison had to offer the world and so many others agree, especially the people whose pain and trauma was represented in a more exacting way in Morrison’s novels. Toni Morrison was a highly capable writer that has attracted almost everyone with her work, and her work will continue to do so for years into the future. However, it’s a sour day when we are reminded of how close the date may be where she is forgotten. Until then, I’ll work to make sure that the world remembers the sublime writing that Toni Morrison produced over the course of her 88 years.

5 in 5 is a new series that gives food and drink recommendations for one type of place in five different neighborhoods. To welcome incoming first-years and welcome back returning students, the inaugural article of the series will tackle one of the most important studying places: the coffeeshop.
Commonplace Coffee — Squirrel Hill
A little further down Forbes after the Murray intersection, this café is medium-sized, so sometimes table space is limited. Be sure to try a creamy latte and a fresh donut.
Kaibur Coffee — Polish Hill
Nestled at a street corner in Polish Hill, Kaibur Coffee is a bit difficult to find for students limited to the bus lines (the 54 will bring you closest, but there will still be some walking). In a mainly residential neighborhood, Kaibur will have less students and more locals, but a great food menu to go with their coffee. Limited tables.
Espresso A Mano — Lawrenceville
One of the first coffeeshops I tried in Pittsburgh, Espresso A Mano remains one of my favorites. With tall ceilings, several tables, and a great and extensive drink menu, this place is a top-notch study option. Despite the space however, this one is popular, and tables go quickly.
Redhawk Coffee — Oakland
Right in the heart of Oakland, Redhawk is a favorite for Pitt students who want to grab a drink to and from class. The vibe is chill and sunny, but this is less for studying and more for a quick stop.
Constellation Coffee — Bloomfield
Constellation has a quieter feel, near the intersection of Penn and Main at the edge of Bloomfield. With a simple set up and large windows at the storefront that allow lots of light in, you can get a lot of work done. And make sure to grab one of their delicious scones!

Welcome to Maddy's Monthly Meme Madness, where we take a look at the Top 5 most-liked memes on the Facebook group, Carnegie Mellon Memes for Spicy Teens, posted in the past month. In this Orientation edition special, we will do a recap of the Top 5 most-liked memes since our last standard edition (published April 29).
1) "CMU Venn Diagram" by Alexander Chen (10/10)
Let’s have a round of applause for Alexander and his high-effort meme. The fruit of his labor yielded over 900 likes, making it the most liked meme since our last meme roundup. These four seemingly unrelated aspects of what many face during their Carnegie Mellon experience coalesce into the most ambitious crossover since Infinity War.
2) "Birth control" by Ashim Singh (9/10)
This is an excellent variation of the “don’t leave your birth control out” meme. Stress culture and its devastating effects can double as birth control, and this meme captures that phenomenon. The icing on the cake for this meme would have been a change in “Dad’s” icon picture on the top. Perhaps our beloved Farnam would’ve tipped the ranking from a 9 to a 10.
3) "CS relationships" by Jenny Yu (9/10) 
Computer science is seemingly inescapable in this institution. After taking 110 and crying every day at my technological ineptness and exploding imposter syndrome, I understand why SCS students wouldn’t want to burden themselves with another 9.0 units that being in a relationship adds to one’s schedule.
4) "Respect the Beep Boop" by Chaya Wurman (8/10)
Would the meme roundup of summer 2019 really have been complete without a tribute to our beloved Beep Boop? The loss of such an iconic part of our campus has devastated our community. The text editing makes me slightly uncomfortable in this meme, though, so I, unfortunately, cannot give this meme a perfect score.
5) "Beep Boop exclusive generation by Likhitha Chintareddy (9/10)
Note: Chintareddy is the online editor of The Tartan. This affiliation has no bearing on the meme rating.
Carnegie Mellon, land of innovation, rigorous academics, prestige… and the Beep Boop. Why is an intersection so integral or iconic to the Carnegie Mellon experience? Who knows? Certainly not this critic who has just half a brain cell remaining. Unfortunately, the text alignment drives me up a wall. The alignment of the text on the right, or lack thereof, is unsettling.
Honorary mention. "You beeped your last boop" by the Carnegie Mellon Instagram.
We salute to the beloved Beep Boop. I suppose all good things must come to an end, though I am sorry to those who did not experience the Beep Boop glory of the Morewood/Fifth intersection. However, I'm optimistic that when one meme door closes, another will open. We welcome the Class of 2023+: both the students and the new memes to arise.

As the year quickly approaches, the Orientation councelors, the Office of Residential Education, and the faculty and staff of Carnegie Mellon University are hyped and ready to welcome the class of Class of 2023+! These staff and students have been training and anxiously awaiting the arrival of the incredible new students of our school.
The Orientation Staff specifically has been in training for the last week, prepping all sorts of incredible activities such as Playfair, House Wars, the Last Lecture video discussions, Craig Street Crawl, Pittsburgh Connections and so much more!
The students of Orientation staff are not only committed to their own work and passions, but they are dedicated to helping the first year students acclimate to their new home, and are excited to share all of their knowledge and experience, as well as answer any and all questions!
One major goal of Orientation is to create a comfortable environment for each individual by tailoring the experience to them. With loads of incredible options to explore campus, hear about student life and check out the city of Pittsburgh, there is something for everyone.
There are many things that make the Carnegie Mellon Orientation special. I asked some returning Orientation Counselors what their favorite part of Orientation was and many were eager to respond.
Mitch Wiedmann: “Meeting people. I meet more people during orientation than any other organizations or classes. It’s nice to make connections with different people.”
Thomas von Davier: “Getting to see the energy and excitement of parents on move in day because there is a magical thing that happens when you are the first person to welcome them to the university.”
Equally as excited are all the first-time Orientation Counselors, who told me which part of orientation they are most excited for:
Isa Giammatteo: “Becoming close with a small group of first years that will gain trust in me and having this bond that will continue through the year.”
Lauryn Patt: “Interacting with the first-years on my floor.”
Lindsey Helsel: “Seeing the first years bond with one another and building a sense of community.”
As this new school year kicks off, Orientation staff are thrilled to get to know the Class of 2023+ and share in all of their passions, talents, knowledge and questions!
Here’s to an incredible year full of new and continued friendships, new experiences, adventures, classes, learning, and a plethora of opportunities to discover parts of yourself.
Welcome, Carnegie Mellon Class of 2023+, to your new home!

As of Aug. 15, Carnegie Mellon’s School of Computer Science (SCS) has a new dean. 
Martial Hebert, the former head of the Robotics Institute, was selected for the position by the 20-member Dean Search Committee, co-chaired by Professor Lorrie Cranor and Machine Learning Department head Roni Rosenfeld, with help from the executive search firm Isaacson, Miller. 
Hebert will take over for former head Andrew Moore, who stepped down at the end of 2018 to rejoin Google as the head of its Cloud AI project. As the new dean, Hebert will oversee the seven departments making up SCS, including the Institute for Software Research (ISR), the Computer Science Department (CS), the Machine Learning department (ML), and Hebert’s own Robotics Institute (RI). 
The Tartan sat down with Hebert last week to discuss his new role and his vision for the future of SCS. Hebert, who has been with RI since 1984, sees his appointment as an opportunity to “understand and appreciate all of the disciplines,” and connect those disciplines to the broader research being done at Carnegie Mellon. “I would love to see CS, and what we do in SCS, connecting to everything, basically…[not] just in terms of computer science providing a toolbox…[but] being able to link those tools, those ideas…to create new field[s], new disciplines.”
Hebert’s focus on interdisciplinary applications of computer science dovetails with that of Carnegie Mellon president Farnham Jahanian, whose bio describes Jahanian’s expertise in “advancing research and education within and across disciplines.” Hebert’s expertise extends in particular to artificial intelligence, the newest undergraduate major in SCS. 
Hebert hopes to integrate AI technology into other research areas on campus by “looking at AI plus ‘X’…going further than just AI applied to ‘X’. Rather, seeing how we can go much further by seeing what this new field looks like.” Hebert gave the example of automating discovery, when scientists use AI to comb through scientific papers and look for new, untried research angles or previously unnoticed connections, as a “new way, basically, of thinking about how to do experimentation and discovery in science,” and one way in which AI is already reshaping an academic discipline. 
Carnegie Mellon has been at the forefront of AI research for years, including the creation of the first AI computer program in 1956, as well as “pioneering work in self-driving cars, facial recognition and natural language processing,” according to a university press release about the creation of the AI major, the first undergraduate program of its kind offered by a U.S. university. 
That press release stressed that the AI major “would include a strong emphasis on ethics and social responsibility.” According to the program webpage, this “strong emphasis” is one required ethics elective out of 32 total courses, which students can choose from “Freshman Seminar: Artificial Intelligence and Humanity”, “Ethics and Policy Issues in Computing”, and “AI, Society, and Humanity”. 
AI technology, with its revolutionary potential, has faced ethical criticism on privacy and humanitarian grounds, with its use for automation and by law enforcement agencies and the military sparking backlash from workers and activists, something that Herbert addresses by saying that “on the education level, we need to inject those concepts of ethics at basically all levels.” He adds that “it needs to be more pervasive, it needs to be more structured, but it’s already a part of the education,” referring to the required ethics course. 
Career placement for CS graduates is another consideration for Herbert, given that 50% of CS undergrads who did not pursue further education went to work for just 4 companies (Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon). An increase in the diversity of placement “would be great to have,” but that he has noticed that “a much larger proportion of students stay here locally, in the local companies, local branches of companies, so that’s an interesting evolution.” He has noticed that more students are staying in Pittsburgh for summer internships, a “stunning change” from the usual Bay Area or Boston tech scenes. 
While Hebert is “excited about everything at this school,” he stressed the unique intersection at SCS between “the entire spectrum of [computer science] research,” and research from the most fundamental to the most applied. His main goal, however, is to expand the possibilities of computer science. He says, “most people have a restricted view, of what it means when we say computer science. Which is kind of boring, kind of a small toolbox, you know. You want to have a much more expansive viewpoint.”

Welcome back to the land of meal blocks, hard classes, high stakes and long nights. Something, however,  has changed since you were last here.
For years, the traffic lights at the intersection of campus’s busiest intersection — Forbes and Moorewood — emitted a beeping tone when the walking signal flashed. “Beep boop, beep boop,” it rang, sounding like an automated bird chirp.
The beeping tone was recognized far and wide as a welcome to campus. Many students came to refer to the intersection as “the beep boop.”
The traffic tone was designed and installed to help blind and visually impaired people know when it is safe to cross the street. Devices like these are known as accessible pedestrian signals. The beep boop was “assuredly” installed at the request of the Blind and Vision Rehabilitation Services of Pittsburgh, an organization that was once based on Craig Street, according a statement by the School of Computer Science to The Tartan via their twitter account.
Rumors that “the beep boop” would soon meet its end swirled around campus during finals week of the most recent spring semester. The steel poles that held up the traffic lights and walk signs had grown rusty. And they looked a bit out of place next to the newly renovated walkway leading into campus.
In July, new traffic lights and walk signs were installed on shiny black beams, and the old signs were removed. The “beep boop” was replaced with a recording of walking instructions.
Students mourned. “Overheard at Carnegie Mellon”, a Facebook page popular among Carnegie Mellon students and alumni, was flooded posts about the traffic chime’s removal.
They started on July 24. Maya Greenholt, a junior psychology major, posted a picture of a construction crew installing the new lights. The caption read “The last beep boop.” Over 1,100 people reacted to the post, 761 with a crying emoji.
“Let’s all scream beep boop as we cross the street to keep it alive for ever,” declared Cali Colliver, a junior, just hours later.
“Does anyone have a recording of the Beep Boop?” asked Aaron Satyanarayana, a sophomore.
By July 25, the fence was painted as a tribute to the beep boop. “You’ve beeped your last boop,” it read between the posts.
Carnegie Mellon featured photographs of the fence on their official Instagram page, along with a recording of the traffic chime. “Turn on your audio & you’ll be able to hear our old friend anytime,” the post read.
“Anyone know how to hack a walk sign system?” asked Lucas Moiseyev, an ECE major, in a post on the Overheard CMU Facebook page.
“Dude you could probably figure it out,” said Vicki Posnanski, a senior in Mechanical Engineering. “I wrote a paper about transportation infrastructure for my cyber security class and road signs are ridiculously easy.”
The accessible pedestrian system ended up developing an obsessive, cult-like following. To some, this just seems like another day at Carnegie Mellon. Nick Marotta, a junior Design major, said he saw the posts as a “pervasive reminder that I was at Carnegie Mellon.” “They made me laugh,” he added.
Others were frustrated by the hysteria. Peter Rezk, a senior philosophy major, called attention in an interview to what he saw as a lack of empathy.
“Carnegie Mellon University culture is everybody losing they minds over a crosswalk sound being removed and SILENCE when Antwon Rose’s killer escapes Justice in Pittsburgh,” said Rezk in his post.
Rezk’s post was deleted by the moderators of Overheard, prompting a series of outrage and criticism that was also deleted. Overheard’s moderators explained that they deleted the post because “wasn’t overheard,” and “the comments were extremely vicious.”
“Now, when I cross the street it feels strange not to hear it,” said Marotta. In the beep boop’s heyday, students living in the nearby Morewood E Tower often complained about being kept up at night. But Marotta, who lived in E Tower during his first year, says that the noise never bothered him. “It sort of ended up blending in with the cicadas and birds,” he explained.
And therein lies the problem with the beloved traffic chime. It blended in, and wasn’t working well for people who depended on it.
In fact, “Cuckoo-chirp” style Access Pedestrian signals like the beep boop were designed to resemble bird calls in an effort to avoid causing a disruption to the public.
Research sponsored by the National Cooperative Highway Research program in 1998 found that “people had difficulty remembering which tone was for which direction, often didn’t know which direction they were traveling, and that birds sometimes mimicked the chirp sound.” And according to the American Council for the Blind, “Cuckoo-chirp” signals are no longer the recommended standard.
By instructing people to “cross Forbes Avenue,” the newly installed traffic chime is an improvement for those who rely on it. Polara, a leading manufacturer of crossing sound systems, says that “[accessible pedestrian systems] have also proven to benefit to all pedestrians,” especially children.
So although the beloved sound is gone, far from all is lost.

Carnegie Mellon’s undergraduate orientation week begins this Sunday, Aug. 19, and will continue through Sunday, Aug. 26. The summer camp-esque orientation is a way to get to know people and surroundings before classes begin on Aug. 27.
This year’s theme is “Breakthough” signifying the “many breakthroughs, big and small, that you will achieve throughout your college transition and time at CMU,” according to the online guide that can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/first-year-orientation/. There are events that touch on all areas of life at Carnegie Mellon.
Academic:
Orientation week can be a great way to get more information about your college, and to get any academic questions answered before beginning your first year.
On Sunday at 11 a.m., each college will have academic breakout sessions where parents and students can talk with their presiding college deans, advisors, and faculty members.
Drop in advising sessions will run on Tuesday, where students can come in and talk with academic advisors without having an appointment. These meetings can be great for finalizing one’s schedule, asking questions about adding or dropping courses, and getting general advice.
On Wednesday evening, each college hosts dinner and evening activities from 4:30 p.m. to midnight. In the afternoon, students will bus to different locations around Pittsburgh with their classmates from their college.
BXA Intercollege Degree Program and College of Fine Arts students will go to the Children’s Museum; College of Engineering students will enjoy an evening of laser tag at Zone28; Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences students will visit the Heinz History Center; Mellon College of Science students will explore the Carnegie Science Center; School of Computer Science students will tour the Google Pittsburgh offices; and Tepper School of Business students will attend a reception at PNC Bank’s Headquarters and visit the attractions in downtown Pittsburgh.
Academic Orientation is scheduled on Thursday (8:30 a.m.- 4 p.m.), when students will have another opportunity to meet deans, professors, advisors, and learn about courses and expectations. This is followed by Convocation (5-6:10 p.m.) on the College of Fine Arts Lawn.
Extracurricular:
Carnegie Mellon offers a wide variety of extracurriculars, and orientation can be a great time to explore the options. On Tuesday, join the Mindfulness Room Open House (3-4 p.m.) to learn about their services, relax, and cultivate wellness through dog therapy. Therapy dogs will be present! There will also be sessions on Tuesday about service and civic engagement on campus (2-2:45 p.m.) and Greek Life. (1:30-2:30 p.m.)
On Friday from 1 to 4 p.m., the Club Sports Showcase will take place on The Cut, where students can try out different sports such as quidditch, lacrosse, and fencing. On Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, there will also be religious events hosted by various organizations on campus. Greek Night, an opportunity to ‘meet and greet’ with all campus greek organizations, will also take place Sunday. (9:30-11:00 pm)
Community:
Some of the highlights of orientation are focused on building strong bonds between incoming first-years. At Playfair (Monday, 8-9:30 p.m.), called “the largest icebreaker ever!” students are encouraged to meet as many people they can in the class of 2023+. On Tuesday at 10:30 a.m., late Carnegie Mellon professor Randy Pausch’s Last Lecture will be shown in McConomy Auditorium, followed by a time for discussion. Later that evening, students will take their class photo on the Baker Hall Lawn.
Often many students’ favorite event, Casino Night, is held on Thursday evening (8:30 p.m.-midnight), when students get to dress up for the week’s biggest social event with food, dancing, and table games. On Friday night (7-9:30 p.m.), students will compete in House Wars in their house colors and themes for the coveted Carnegie Cup. The First-Year Showcase will begin at 8 p.m. on Saturday evening. Auditions and rehearsals are scheduled throughout the week to select the chosen few to perform for the class.

While most undergraduate students are gone over the summer, Carnegie Mellon’s Division of Operations get a chance to renovate, construct, and expand. This summer has been no different. Ralph Horgan, Associate Vice President of Carnegie Mellon’s Campus Design and Facility Development (CDFD), says they’re “racing to the finish” to get a variety of operations done before this semester begins.
Two of the most notable changes to campus will be the newly built ANSYS Hall and the ongoing construction of TCS Hall. The 36,000 square foot ANSYS Hall sits between Scaife and Porter Hall, and will serve the College of Engineering.
TCS Hall, across Forbes Avenue from the Integrated Innovation Institute, will house new facilities for the School of Computer Science, with space for the Institute for Software Research, the Human Computer Interaction Institute, and the computational finance program. Horgan says the top floor will also serve as a “collaborative space.” They’re hoping construction on the building will be done by the Spring of 2020.
Carnegie Mellon is also currently branching into other areas of Pittsburgh real estate. This past July, Mill 19—a former steel mill-turned research and development center—opened in Hazelwood Green, about 2 miles south of campus.
The 190,000 square foot Mill 19 facility is home to a partnership with the Advanced Robotics for Manufacturing group, a not-for-profit seeking to address “workforce development issues,” according to the partnership’s announcement. It will also house the College of Engineering’s Manufacturing Futures Initiative. Horgan says the space is large, “kind of like the National Robotics and Engineering Center,” and features a ten-ton crane.
Another expansion beyond our original campus came last year when Carnegie Mellon purchased Fifth Neville Apartments, an acquisition that displaced then-tenants of the building. Horgan says they’re now working to renovate that building, bringing it up to Americans with Disabilities Act code, addressing safety concerns, installing Carnegie Mellon wireless interent, renovating flooring, and providing aesthetic upgrades. He says the new Carnegie Mellon housing option will be open one year from now.
The Melwood Avenue acquisition last year, which will be a new space for the College of Fine Arts and the Miller Institute, is not “not fully fleshed out” as of yet, Horgan says.
On campus, projects have included both housing and academic building renovations. A 4-year plan to modernize all classrooms is now well underway, with 60 classrooms renovated of the 80 planned. Horgan says that “President Farnam really pushed the classroom initiative”. CDFD wanted five years to do the work, but Farnam insisted on completing the 20-million-dollar project in four years.
Horgan says these classroom redesigns have been “very sophisticated and research-based” thanks to years of study by the Simon Initiative, a research branch dedicated to education. CDFD also worked with faculty committees, an audio/visual team, and Carnegie Mellon Facilities Management Services to get make progress on the classroom project.
Horgan says CDFD undertook a “smattering of things” this summer in addition to the above projects, many of which will be ready for the semester’s beginning.
Warner Hall, where Carnegie Mellon administration are housed, began serious renovations last year that wrapped up in June. Floors 3-6 of the building were completely redone, including the President's office.
A new engineering makerspace in Hamerschlag Hall is “finally getting finished,” Horgan said.
Morewood Gardens wrapped up its third summer of construction. Work on the building is expected to last a total of four years. New bathrooms and plumbing with chilled water and air conditioning are among the improvements. When asked whether this would be a new standard for on-campus housing, Horgan said that not all dorms will see a similar renovation but all new buildings would have these amenities.
In a move that could draw much attention, CDFD and Carnegie Mellon Dining are “getting very creative rethinking the dining room experience” in Schatz Dining Room, a student space beloved with a tinge of irony. Slated for completion in October, Horgan says the space could be similar to the renovations in the Morewood Underground.

This article is also published in Medium, titled "Hong Kong, Taiwan, China — can we stop talking about politics?"
I just came across another article about the Hong Kong protests again. This one took a critical stand on the radical behavior of young Hong Kongers, claiming that they’ve followed the wrong role models and were misled by their whims of passion, of course written by a Chinese mainlander. Then I looked through the comments section: it was flooded with flattering words from other angry Chinese mainlanders adoring the authority and intelligence of the author of this completely biased article. So I get it: they are attacking and they are angry, both the Chinese and the Hong Kongese.
To me, anger is such a naïve and hopeful emotion. It's the product of being blissfully brainwashed by only one side of the conflict, a side that indicates that there’s a way out, a right way. I’m jealous of those who still have it when talking about politics. Okay, I do talk about politics. People drag me into these discussions because “I want to hear your ideas,” or they wonder “how could you not care about this thing?” People love it: political conversations are bonding experiences, the colliding of minds feeding onto each others’ bombastic self-confidence to make judgments or assertions on the direction of the world. Suddenly, everybody becomes the all-knowing experts that could rightfully make crucial decisions for countries. Like early teenage girls dreaming about their first dates, the talkers are full of passion and illusions. I’m a bit cynical, a bit broken-hearted. I’m tired of pretending that I’m into this game because every time I talk about it, I’m peeling open my old scars.
A bit of context about me: I grew up in Beijing until I was 14 and then moved to Taipei for four years of high school. Now I call both places my home, and I sincerely love the people in both places. But we all know what this meant: for four years, I went back and forth between China mainland and Taiwan and lived in between their animosity against each other. I was the only Chinese mainlander in my high school and probably one of the few Chinese high school students in Taiwan, considering that student visa was not available for high school students. This meant that when situations arose, silence was my best buddy and the emo phrase “nobody understands me” was accurate. How do I knit together my 14 years of experience to explain to a Taiwanese friend that their casual comments or actions actually hurt me?
First of all, I need to be clear that I wasn’t discriminated in any way. My friends were all awesome and kind human beings. I also had changed myself to fit into the surrounding to the extent that I could perfectly pass as a Taiwanese. For a while, on both the mainland and Taiwan, people assumed that I was a local. But that created the problem: what really hurt me was when the two groups both fully accepted me as a member of theirs and pointed their fingers towards the other. 
From the questions they threw at me, to the direct confrontations between Chinese and Taiwanese in public, both groups were desperate to prove their superiority and paint the other side as the villain. For four years, I encountered millions of small situations where the intent was hurting the people on the other side. Millions of arrows shot from the people I love on this side to harm the people I love on the other side. Nobody else could feel it — people were laughing, people were smiling, then people were angry, people were filled with tears— people were in a current where they could float smoothly forward, where they were blissfully protected by the umbrella of their side. But I was given the complete information of both sides and found all of their actions justifiable. So I stayed silent, in the suffocating in-between spaces. When people asked if I thought Taiwan was part of China, I said “I don’t have any stance on this."
But to myself, I had to make a choice to explain the sources of all of this pain and save myself from further damage: a choice between humanity and politics. I could either give up on humanity and stop loving people, or I could say that the system of politics was dividing people and turning us against each other. A choice between the calling of a warm beating heart and the desire of a cold steel mind. Obviously, I chose the latter to blame. Politics was an abusive mind game to me. And it was only years later did I realize that I wasn’t playing it right. I ignored the fundamental rule of this game: you have to choose a side. The winning strategies only serve one side at a time. You have to choose a side to win, or else you’ll always be losing, hurting.
So that gives me more unpopular opinions: when one talks about politics, in a way that gives normative arguments, one automatically has opt-in to dividing the world by consenting to the system’s rule that there’s a “they” and there’s an “us”. Or else, one stands in the in-between areas, bearing the burden of empathy and fail to draw the line between people. Unfortunately, there is no way out of this game. The only way to win is by not playing it at all.
I’ve proudly watched the flag-raising ceremony in Tiananmen Square. I used to jog around the Summer Palace. I saw fireflies for the first time at the age of 18 in the countryside of Taiwan. I waved the Taiwanese flag with my classmates on a parade for the national day. I did a project on the Nanjing Massacre and I knew all too well about it. I made friends with a Japanese grandpa who sold beautiful hand-drawn postcards in Tokyo, only a few hours before I fell in love with Japan. I’ve never been to Hong Kong, but it isn’t hard to imagine the beauty of the land, of the people, of the culture. It has never been hard.
I’m tired, exhausted, downtrodden by the artificial system that we call politics. I have no solution nor opinion to offer, but I ask that please, if I seek refuge in books and fantasies, don’t drag me back to talk about politics.

We've all heard the fable of the sticks: a single stick is easily broken, but a bundle is much harder to break. It's cheesy and cliche, but many cliches exist because they carry at least a grain of truth. For me, this fable succinctly summarizes one of the largest lessons I have learned in my past three years at Carnegie Mellon.
I've struggled with social anxiety for as long as I can remember. I think I can count with one hand how many times I left my house during my high school career for non-school or family-related reasons. Once I got to college, I hoped that leaving home and starting fresh in Pittsburgh could give me that extra boost in confidence. Everyone else is in the same position in a new city, so surely I won't be too awkward making new friends.
That thought was somewhat correct. I talked to new people during Orientation. I still remember my cheeks burning as I ran through Playfair and singing along to "Cake by the Ocean." This was the college experience that I hoped for and more.
Unfortunately, that rush was much shorter-lived than I had expected. The buzz of a new beginning faded, and I found myself falling back to my old habits and withdrawing from the world. I didn't have many close friends, and some of the friendships I did have faded. I was afraid to make new bonds with people; what if these new bonds I make in college disappear into thin air? Would the effort put into maintaining an relationship have been done in vain? Sure, I currently had friends who I would say hi to and maybe grab a bite with here and there, but I found myself unable to be myself or comfortable around others. I felt like an actor with a mask that would appease the audience and come off the second the curtain closes.
"You should come to The Tartan," a friend told me. She probably saw my political Facebook rambles and saw a potential writer. Maybe she saw The Tartan as an outlet for me. I was nervous. Me, a writer? I never thought of myself as interesting. What's so interesting about a small-town girl from Alabama? I didn't want to decline, so I decided to go to my first All-Staff meeting in my second semester of freshman year. I chatted with the editor of Forum and wrote my first article.
I thought that joining such an extracurricular activity would be isolating, and it was at first. I would come to All-Staff to pitch a topic to my editor, write it, and repeat. I didn't swing by production or talk to any of the other writers. Again, my anxiety had a vice grip on me and told me that nobody really cared. This cycle continued for that entire semester.
Entering sophomore year: the editor tells me that she wants an assistant. This doesn't seem too demanding socially, so I say yes. Little did I know how much this would change my life. I walked in the office thinking that I would just be typing away and dragging objects on InDesign, but what I got out of it was so much more. Being an assistant made me talk to more people and having people talk to me. My shell was being pecked at, and it was only a matter of time until I came out.
It's cheesy. I know. I won't pretend that being so involved in a club and being so close with a community magically cured me and pumped confidence into me. I still struggle with social anxiety and probably will for a while. However, I have never met a group of friends who I feel more comfortable around. The encouragement, love, and support that this group radiated helped me go through some of the hardest parts of my college experience and even inspired me to open up about my own experiences with mental health. If you told me in freshman year that I would genuinely be looking forward to being surrounded by people, I would have thought you went insane and throw a half-empty can of Red Bull at you. However, that's just what happened.
Perhaps your community isn't in The Tartan, and that's perfectly valid. However, I firmly believe that having any community that can vouch for you and support you is vital. Find your niche. It doesn't matter how long it takes to find it, but don't underestimate the power of a bundle. If I remained as a lone stick, I know I would have snapped. I might not even be here at all. College carries its fair share of difficulties; having the support from others can make all the difference. Sure, it may not stop the storm, but it can provide shelter that helps you stay dry.

Former Congressman (R - IL) and current conservative radio show host Joe Walsh is someone I remember having intense feelings about for nearly four years. Him being a Tea Party conservative and me leaning left is an obvious sign of political disagreement, but I had always thought of him as someone who cared more for voting for a candidate who aligned with his own party, rather than his own beliefs.
As recently as the end of 2016, Walsh accused Obama of "hating Israel because he's a Muslim." Leading up to the 2016 presidential election, he showed support for then-candidate Donald Trump. In October, he went so far as to tweet that "On November 8th, I'm voting for Trump. On November 9th, if Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket." His list of provocative actions and remarks extends far beyond just those two incidents, but there has recently been a shift in his tone.
I was a bit taken aback when I first saw it: Walsh, a staunch Trump supporter who even said he would bring his musket if Clinton were elected president (which I would hope was a hyperbole on his part), was now calling out Republicans for not taking a stand against Trump and prioritizing party over policy. After the Helsinki Summit in July 2018, where Trump sided with Putin instead of the FBI regarding potential collusion during the 2016 election, any shred of support that Walsh had for Trump was eviscerated. A man that he once defended relentlessly was now "a man that [he] will never support again" and "a traitor to this country." Since then, Walsh has stuck to his guns with his conservative values, but his criticism of the president has remained unchanged.
On Aug. 14, Walsh published an op-ed for the New York Times titled "Trump Needs a Primary Challenge." He points out how Trump is not only a bad conservative but a bad actor on the political stage. Walsh saw how his former Republican colleagues, who had wanted to minimize the national debt and executive power during the Obama administration, were now allowing the debt to balloon under the Trump administration without so much as a "word of protest." Throughout the op-ed, he criticized Trump on everything from his lack of understanding of trade to his racist and nativist remarks towards four congresswomen.
Walsh also addressed his personal controversies regarding personal attacks against his political opponents and questioning Obama's religious beliefs. In an interview with CNN regarding his op-ed, Walsh even apologizes for playing a role in helping elect Trump. Admitting his regret and apologizing for his previous wrongdoings was a vulnerable move on his part, but what caught me off guard the most was him not only addressing his mistakes, but calling them a precedent for Trump's rhetoric and leadership. In the op-ed, he described the current administration as "the worst and ugliest iteration of views I expressed for the better part of a decade."
At the end of the op-ed, he calls for a right-wing contender who "could stand up, look the president in the eye and say: 'Enough, sir. We’ve had enough of your indecency. We’ve had enough of your lies, your bullying, your cruelty, enough of your insults, your daily drama, your incitement, enough of the danger you place this country in every single day. We don’t want any of this anymore, and the country certainly can’t stand four more years of it.'"
Perhaps him apologizing for helping Trump get elected is his way of hiding the skeletons in the closet. Only Walsh knows his own motives, and it is not up to me to forgive him for his past actions. The cynical part of me believes he's currently trying to save face and perhaps become more visible in the public sphere. However, I don't know if a public stunt to gain traction for a conservative talk show would go to this extent for over a year. Regardless, the fact that someone whose support for a single candidate once seemed unmalleable but is now shattered leads me to wonder where the tipping point for conservativism lies. The ex-GOP and the Never Trump Republicans have definitely been a quieter minority within the party, but part of me is hopeful that enough of them can create an opening for a candidate who can represent their ideas. Maybe we can have a candidate who can change the channel from the White House edition of The Apprentice. Or maybe I'm just too optimistic.

In thinking about topics to tackle for the new year, the Tartan staff and I hit upon one that doesn’t get enough attention: personal finance.
College students aren’t the best with money, and it reflects in the many negative stereotypes that older generations — and students themselves — believe in. The idea that we tend to overspend, undervalue the importance of saving, and are often saddled with debt hangs over us like a dark cloud, branding us as financially irresponsible.
But while it’s easy to buy into the gainsaying, the reality is more complicated. Recent analysis shows that members of Gen Z tend to be more financially sound than their predecessors, better understanding the importance of things such as saving and retirement.
So, although it’s not true that Gen Z is by default bad at handling money, there is still room for improvement. According to a study by the National Endowment for Financial Education, only 24 percent of millennials — who are not that far away from us in age — are considered financially literate. A lack of solid money habits now can translate to compounding consequences down the line, so statistics such as these are alarming.
It’s not reasonable, of course, to cover the entirety of financial literacy in a weekly column. As with any field of importance, there is an overwhelming amount of information out there, and to cover it all in detail would take forever (not to mention a whole lot of ink and paper!). With that in mind, welcome to Accounting for Your Future, the Tartan’s new personal finance column! The goal of this installment is to cover the big topics of saving, spending, and investing, all in focused pieces published weekly.
College is a transition between adolescence and adulthood, and part of that transition is getting your financial ducks in a row. Of course, as busy Carnegie Mellon students, we have various priorities such as our studies, research, and extracurriculars, so planning for the future sometimes takes a back seat. Yet good habits established early can pay dividends later, so it’s worth your consideration. This column is not intended to teach you everything you need to know to be financially literate, but the hope is that this introduction will spark your interest to learn more about how to be financially prosperous. If you’re just starting to think about finance, then think of this as a springboard. And if you’re already a finance wizard, maybe you’ll learn something new.
That’s all for now! Tune in next week where we will begin to discuss the all-important act of saving.

It’s late in the evening and you collapse on your bed. It’s new, a bit stiff, and either too high or too low for you. Maybe you’re in a triple and have the unfortunate luck of being the top bunk. Maybe you have a rare single, and the room all to yourself. Your clothes have been carefully folded in the standard wood-colored drawers. Your laptop is sitting pristinely on the otherwise empty desk. You had set up a few decorations — a band poster there, a stuffed animal here — to make it a little bit more you.
But whether or not your roommates are around, or your floor is rowdy with people getting to know each other, you are, for perhaps the first time in your life, alone. Your parents just left, possibly crying, as they drive back home. You are a college student now, and this is your life.
For my fellow upperclassmen, you know this feeling. For me, it happened three whole years ago. For incoming first-years, you’ve just experienced this, and maybe it hasn’t sunk in yet. This is your time, and your life to experience, your choices to make, but as a newly-minted senior, I want to share some things I wish I knew when I first stepped onto Carnegie Mellon University’s campus.
You don’t have to know everything. When I started here, I was an undecided Dietrich College student who had no idea what she wanted to do with her life. I had interests, but they hadn’t yet evolved into passions. But surrounding me were so many students who did know, and who had known for a while. They were the people with detailed goals, set paths, and specific dreams.
I would call Carnegie Mellon a pretty vocational school. Yes, it has ground-breaking research and innovative programs, but from my experience as an undergraduate, I have felt a strong push to get the perfect job. Many of the students here are career-focused, and have plans on how to achieve their goals.
This is a wonderful thing, but I want to tell people like me who might not know what they want to do: you’re not alone. I thought I was, and I gave myself so much unnecessary stress thinking about it. Take your time to explore classes. There is a reason the deadline for declaring a major is at the end of the spring semester of sophomore year. So few people take the two years, but they are there for you to learn and discover and hopefully, find something you are passionate about.
Grades matter, until they don’t. First, don’t tell your parents I’m telling you this. Second, I don’t mean that you should skip classes or skirt on your assignments. What I mean is that grades are important, but only as a measurement of your learning. What matters is what you learned, if you learned. Did you take anything away from this course? Will you use it in the future? Did you enjoy it?
So many times, I fretted over grades without actually learning anything, and to me, that’s one of the worst things you can do in college. This is a place to learn, to grow, to make meaningful connections and relationships. Don’t let grades overshadow that.
Take your time to find your community. Beyond my academic studies, the most important part of my experience at Carnegie Mellon has been my involvement on campus. I cannot overvalue the experience of having a community. Being around people who are passionate about the same things I am passionate about is an amazing feeling and has pushed me to grow both as a student and as a person. Whether this is through a club or a sport or student government or even just a gathering of mutual friends, I encourage you to find it.
However, take your time to find the right fit. You don’t need to rush into anything, or literally rush a Greek organization. Of course, you should if you want to, but don’t feel pressured into joining five clubs or making commitments that you won’t be able to keep. Test the waters, and keep what feels right.
Take advantage of your environment. I had never been to Pittsburgh before I visited campus, but I truly love it here, and it has become my home. I know so many people who are content to simple lives between their dorm room, the University Center, and whichever buildings they have their classes in. To me, this is a missed opportunity.
Pittsburgh is an eclectic city with much to offer. No, it may not have to hustle and bustle of New York or the extent of cultural diversity as San Francisco, or the consistently sunny weather of Los Angeles, but I think it has heart. From the South Side to Squirrel Hill to Downtown, there are food options ranging from Thai to Argentinian to Ethiopian. There are entertainment events, shows, and museums to fill your free weekends. Pittsburgh has everything you need if you just look for it.
I’m sure there will be more for me to learn and discover in my senior year, but as we kick off this new academic year, I wish you the best in creating the college experience that is perfect for you.
