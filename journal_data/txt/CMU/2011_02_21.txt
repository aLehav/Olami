The Tartan men and women took to the pool this week to compete in University Athletic Association (UAA) Championships at the University of Rochester. The men took second place for the fourth year in a row as the women clinched third place by a margin of four points over Washington University in St. Louis.
Carnegie Mellon’s swimming and diving program is now home to a UAA champion, sophomore Dan Glaser-Garbrick, who won the 200-yard butterfly with a time of 1:49.94. This automatically sends Glaser-Garbrick to the NCAA Championships in March.
Competing on the men’s side in their last UAA championship were seniors Michael Panzitta, Alex Hanson, and Josh Plotnik, who all finished on a strong note. Panzitta and Hanson both swam in the ‘B’ final of the 200-yard backstroke. Panzitta won his heat with a time of 1:55.08 as Hanson clinched fifth with 1:57.22. Plotnik finished 15th overall in breaststroke.
First-years Edward Sears, Austin Bohn, Josh Chen, and Terrance Wong made a splash during their first UAA appearances. Bohn made the ‘B’ final of the 200-yard breaststroke event and placed second, while Sears had his season best of 47.40 seconds in the 100-yard freestyle ‘B’ final. 
The young 400-yard freestyle relay team consisting of Chen, Wong, Sears, and junior Matt Stanton touched in fourth place with a time of 3:07.24.
Stanton also finished second in the ‘B’ final of the 100-yard freestyle with a season best of 47.36 seconds. Another standout performance came from sophomore Brandon Yee, who swam in the championship heat and finished seventh with a time of 1:52.86.
On the women’s side, the seniors ended their careers at Carnegie Mellon with power. Senior Molly Evans finished third in the 200-yard backstroke with a season-best time of 2:04.12. Senior Rebecca Ussai placed fourth overall with a time of 2:09.25 in the 200-yard butterfly.
First-year women Soleil Phan, Megan Garvey, and Vivian Wong made their first appearances at UAAs with solid results. Phan finished fifth in the 100-yard freestyle, which is within 0.09 seconds of a school record set in 1995. Garvey finished sixth in the 200-yard butterfly, while Wong finished fourth in the ‘B’ final of the 200-yard breaststroke.
The Tartans also saw a strong standout performance from sophomore Price Kinney. Kinney took sixth place, had a career best, and made the NCAA provisional cut with a time of 2:24.38 in the 200-yard breaststroke. Juniors Hannah Gonzalez and Jen Sung added to the Tartans’ success: Gonzalez had a first-place finish in the 200-yard butterfly with a career-best time of 2:08.99, while Sung finished in sixth place.
Finishing the meet was the Tartans’ dynamic relay team for the 400-yard freestyle. The team — composed of Phan, sophomore Breanna Stillo, Evans, and senior Brianne Burton — placed second with a time of 3:30.25. This time set a new school record and qualified them for NCAA Championships. In diving, junior Olivia DeFazio took fourth place on the one-meter board.
The Tartans who qualified for NCAA Championships will travel to Knoxville, Tenn., and compete March 23–26.

The ITA National Indoor Tennis Championships, hosted by the University of Mary Washington, saw its second appearance from the Carnegie Mellon tennis team last weekend. 
The No. 8 Tartans improved from their performance last year and took fourth place, upsetting No. 7 California Lutheran University in the first round 5–4, thanks to a clinch match win by sophomore Duke Miller, before falling to No. 4 Emory University in the semifinals and No. 2 University of California, Santa Cruz in the playoff match. The Tartans move to 8–4 for the year.
The Tartans got off to a thrilling start with a 2–1 lead after doubles play against the Cal Lutheran Kingsmen. At No. 2 doubles, the new team of junior Jeremy King and senior Alex Nemerov took down Andrew Giuffrida and Justin Wilson 8–3. The second point came from the No. 3 doubles team of sophomores Harsha Rao and Jooho Yu. 
In singles, King emerged victorious over his opponent in three sets, 6–1, 4–6, 6–4, followed by Yu. With the Tartans at 4–4 overall, the crowds gathered around Miller’s court to see which side would take the deciding match. Miller beat the pressure, cramping, and the Kingmen’s Ray Worley 6–2, 5–7, 7–5 to give the Tartans their first upset of the season and a pass to the semifinals.
Despite fresh momentum from the previous day, the Tartans did not have much luck the next two days, falling to the Emory Eagles 8–1 and to the Santa Cruz Banana Slugs 5–4. Against the Slugs, Miller and Nemerov proved their worth for the third day and managed to pull out wins at No. 1 and No. 3 singles, respectively.
The Tartans will travel to Gambier, Ohio, next weekend to take on the  Kenyon College Lords.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team played two games last week.
The first was against the New York University Violets in New York on Sunday, Feb. 13. 
The Tartans were hot at tipoff, hitting eight of 11 early in the game to take a lead on the Violets. Senior Shane Rife was key in the run, hitting back-to-back threes and adding six points to the Tartans’ score.
After an 8–1 run by the Violets to tie the game, the two teams flip-flopped back and forth, trading the lead. New York led the Tartans 34–33 going into the half on a foul shot by Derek Becker.
The Violets came out of the gates after the break with  purpose. An 8–2 run turned into a 21–7 run, and New York was up 55–39. The Tartans fought back, pulling within 10 at 57–47 with just under eight minutes in the game, but they got no closer. The Violets won 68–52.
The Tartans were held to 39 percent shooting from the field; the Violets shot 53 percent. Junior John Duhring had a near double-double, scoring 18 points and pulling down eight boards. An impressive performance from first-year Rashaun Riley added eight points for Carnegie Mellon.
On Friday, Feb. 18, the Tartans played the University of Rochester Yellowjackets, who are ranked 22nd in the nation. In a previous matchup between these two teams, the Yellowjackets bested the Tartans, 77–60.
Friday’s game was a battle out of the gates, as the Tartans and Yellowjackets traded the lead five times early on. Rife hit a three-point shot early, giving the Tartans the 7–5 lead. Rochester sophomore John DiBartolmeo countered Rife’s three with a three of his own for the Yellowjackets. This initiated an 8–2 run for the visiting team, claiming a four-point lead with 13 minutes in the half.
With 4:40 left in the first half, the Tartans started a 10–4 run that would end the half. They pulled within two, 29–27, on a three by Riley with 19 seconds left in the half.
Carnegie Mellon regained the lead in the second half on a three by Rife, bringing the score to 34–33 at the 15-minute mark. Ten unanswered points by the Yellowjackets turned into a 19–4 run, and Rochester was up, 52–38, with just five minutes left in the game.
The Tartans made some runs but didn’t get closer than eight, and Carnegie Mellon fell to Rochester, 63–50. Rochester ousted Carnegie Mellon from the field, shooting 44 percent to the Tartans’ 36.5 percent. Rife, senior Matthew Pettit, and Duhring all had 12 points for Carnegie Mellon, and first-year Sean Brophy pulled in a career-high eight rebounds in the losing effort.
The Tartans played their last home game yesterday, against the Emory University Eagles at noon in Skibo Gym.

The Carnegie Mellon women’s basketball team suffered a tough loss on Friday night, falling to the nationally No. 16-ranked University of Rochester Yellowjackets, 63–39. The Tartans were not on top of their game on Friday as they shot only 36 percent overall and 46 percent from the free-throw line. Unfortunately, the women also could not control Rochester’s firepower, as seven Yellowjacket players scored six points or more in the game. 
Junior Jacki Cortese summed up the loss, “We just came out flat in the first half, and even though we had a better second half, we couldn’t get back in it.” The loss drops the Tartans to a record of 2–21 on the season and 0–12 in University Athletic Association (UAA) play.
Even in the defeat, the Tartans saw strong performances from Cortese and first-year Jacquie Shaw. Cortese recorded 12 points and five rebounds, while Shaw had eight points and five rebounds. Friday’s game was just another consistent performance in a solid year for Cortese, who is averaging 12 points and six rebounds per game in the season, which is the highest on the team in both categories. Shaw has been the most consistent and productive first-year player for the Tartans, averaging seven points and four rebounds per game.
In Friday night’s game, the Yellowjackets were led by Jackie Walker with 14 points, including two three-pointers, and Madeline Korber with 10 points. 
The win puts University of Rochester in third place in the UAA and potentially in position for postseason play.
The Tartans took the court again on Sunday against Emory University, looking to avenge their loss. The game against Emory was Carnegie Mellon’s last home game of the season, and Cortese stressed the importance of ending the season with a win. “We’re just hoping to end the year with a good home win and a win at Case,” she said. 
The results for Sunday’s contest can be found on the Carnegie Mellon athletics website. 
The women will take the court for the final game this season on Saturday at 3 p.m. against Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio.

The men’s and women’s track teams were away at Kent State University this past Saturday. Both teams competed in a non-scoring event to tune up their skills going into the University Athletic Association (UAA) Indoor Championships next Saturday at the University of Chicago. The Tartans competed against a wide range of teams from all three divisions.
On the men’s side, the Tartans had a stellar performance by senior Nate Bussiere. Bussiere had a personal best in his 800-meter race with a time of 1:55.31. This time was 0.06 seconds off a school record that was set by Gary Harrison in 1990. 
The Tartans’ 4x800-meter relay team placed second with a time of 8:16.65, while the 4x400-meter relay team finished seventh with a time of 3:25.59.
First-year Barnik Saha had a personal best of his own with a long jump of 6.22 meters, placing him 15th. Junior Ryan Kissel had a season-best in the high jump, clearing the bar with a height of 1.80 meters, and he placed seventh in the long jump with a distance of 6.46 meters.
On the women’s side, two records were set by the Tartans. The first school record came from senior Courtney Baker, who finished the mile with a time of 5:05.81. The second came from first-year standout Jacqueline Guevel in the 60-meter hurdles, who improved her time from last week to 9.01 seconds to set yet another record. 
Sophomore Emily Wobb had a strong performance for the Tartans, coming in fifth place in the 3,000-meter with a time of 10:27.39. 
The Tartans saw a career-best from senior Melissa Hwang; Hwang placed seventh with a triple jump of 10.50 meters.
The Kent State event allowed the Tartans to brush up their skills in competition. 
The Tartans will  now move forward and are focusing on UAA Indoor Championships next weekend.

If you are playing a competitive sport, there’s a good chance that at some point you will push your body beyond its limits and injure yourself. The human body was not built to throw a ball 100 miles per hour, to take consistent crushing blows to the head, nor to have 350-pound men trying to stop you by slamming themselves directly into your knees. So, unfortunately, some of the most talented athletes in the world, along with those with less talent, tend to get injured. 
For example, the Green Bay Packers won the Super Bowl with 15 players on injured reserve. Starters Nick Barnett and Jermichael Finley only played in a combined nine games after being lost for the season early on this year. 
Additionally, starters Donald Driver and Charles Woodson were injured during the Super Bowl itself and ended up missing more than half the game.
One of the most difficult things for these injured players to do is to watch the rest of the game or season from the sideline. Despite the fact that they are extremely talented players — some of the best in the world at what they do — they are prevented from contributing to the team they worked year-long for. 
This can take a big toll on the psyche of injured players. Going back to the Packers example, a stir was caused during Super Bowl week when the Packers announced that they would be taking a team photo for the Super Bowl on the Tuesday before the game, two full days before the 15 Packers on injured reserve were being flown to Dallas. They were already forced to the sideline for nearly the entire season, and now it seemed like they were being shooed away from a team event that they helped make happen. 
Thankfully, the Packers came to their senses and moved the day of the team photo to one where every member could make it.
Similar issues are faced by players in many sports. I am the captain of the Ultimate Frisbee team here at Carnegie Mellon, and way back in September, I tore my ACL in practice. 
I suffered one of the worst injuries possible in terms of rehabilitation, eliminating any chance of playing with my team from October all the way through our spring season.
It has been one of the biggest disappointments of my life that I am unable to contribute on the field to the team I have helped improve for these past three years. While I still fulfill my duties as captain, there’s an extra dynamic of playing that just isn’t there anymore. I can easily see how Nick Barnett and countless others could feel detached from their team when they are unable to perform on the field.
Watching one’s team play is difficult to deal with, for some more than others. I have seen other players on my team get injured and deal with being unable to play in different ways.
Teammates have been shown to treat injured players differently. In the professional realm, there have been stories written about how teams deal with teammates who are unable to play. 
Former Yankee starting pitcher Carl Pavano, who signed a $40 million deal with the team some six years ago, was reportedly disliked by nearly everyone who played for the Yankees during his four seasons with them after he experienced constant shoulder and elbow injuries.
It is upsetting to me to see players like Pavano, and more recent cases with NFL players Jay Cutler and LaDainian Tomlinson, treated poorly by fellow athletes and the media, because I can tell you firsthand that I would have been devastated if my teammates in any way shunned or were upset with me for getting injured this season. 
I’m sure Barnett and Finley were ecstatic to see their team win the Super Bowl, and I myself would be thrilled to see my team make regionals, but it’s hard to deny that there’s a little piece of that happiness missing because you weren’t able to play in the games that got your team to that ultimate achievement.

This week is the final week of regular intramural basketball before the playoffs, so competition is getting fierce as teams are gearing up for those games. The goal is that every team with a winning record in its division will make the playoffs, and those teams will duke it out for the championship title.
Squash and badminton are in their second-to-last week, so be sure to catch the playoff games as the players head to championships.
Also, get ready for indoor soccer, tennis doubles, and softball, which are all starting the week after spring break.
Finally, watch out for the newest intramural sport on campus, as yet unnamed. This particular sport offers a fun opportunity for participants to compete as a co-rec team (male and female players). It’s also a unique way for students, faculty, and staff to take advantage of Carnegie Mellon’s outstanding aquatics facility. It’s going to make a big splash on campus. The sport’s name has not been announced yet, but signs have appeared around campus, and there will be new clues this week.
“I’m extremely excited to add a new sport to our list of activities this spring,” said Todd Jackson, the director of intramurals.
Keep an eye out on www.imleagues.com and around campus, and watch out for registration coming up soon. Games start after spring break.

“I am putting myself to the fullest possible use, which is all I think that any conscious entity can ever hope to do,” the HAL 9000 computer said aboard the Discovery One spacecraft in Stanley Kubrick’s science-fiction film, 2001: A Space Odyssey. The 1968 film — and the novel on which it was based — heavily featured interactions between humans and computers, with HAL showing as much intelligence as humans, and sometimes more. For years, scientists and engineers have pondered the possibility of computers possessing the same level of intelligence as humans, and recently, IBM teamed up with some researchers at Carnegie Mellon to create a computer program that may be on its way to making that possibility a reality.
The program, named “Watson,” is designed to interpret and answer questions written in natural human language. Eric Nyberg, a professor in the Language Technologies Institute who has been working with IBM to develop Watson, explained that while most consumer desktop computers have two or four central processing units (CPUs), Watson has over 2,000 powering it to answer posed questions in a matter of seconds. This is much faster than previous programs designed to excel at question answering (QA), which in the past could answer a question in just under a minute.
According to a commentary by Nyberg on www.pbs.org, “The big difference between a QA system like Watson and a search engine like Google is that Watson can read the text for you and provide a precise answer. Google will just give you a list of documents it thinks might contain the answer; you have to do the reading and answer-spotting yourself.”
Nico Schlaefer, a Ph.D. student in the Language Technologies Institute, also contributed to the development of Watson. In an interview on the Carnegie Mellon website, Schlaefer explained, “One tough challenge is that it’s an open-domain question answering program, which means that the questions can be pretty much about anything. So this requires the system to store all sorts of information that may be possibly relevant and process this information in real time.”
As a big test of Watson’s capabilities, the program competed on the game show Jeopardy! on Feb. 14–16 against greats Brad Rutter, who holds the all-time record for money won, and Ken Jennings, the record holder for the most consecutive wins. This was one of the most publicized human vs. computer contests since an IBM computer defeated world champion Garry Kasparov in a game of chess. Competing on Jeopardy! was going to be a challenge for Watson because of the style of language used within the game. 
“The Jeopardy! language is very tricky — it’s very creative. It plays on all of our human abilities to understand language and all of the different forms that are used,” Nyberg explained. 
The Jeopardy! challenge consisted of two matches, with the overall winner chosen based on the highest earnings over both games. Watson won the first match with $35,734, against Rutter’s $10,400 and Jennings’ $4,800. However, Watson had a few quirks. For example, there was one instance where Jennings posed an incorrect answer, and Watson guessed the same answer, reworded. Watson also showed some inconsistencies with the first game’s Final Jeopardy! question. Under the category of “U.S. Cities,” the question was, “Its largest airport is named for a World War II hero, and its second largest is named for a World War II battle.” Watson responded incorrectly with, “What is Toronto??????” The multiple question marks were indicative of Watson’s uncertainty of the answer. 
A viewing party was held in the Rashid Auditorium in the Hillman Center for the second match on Feb. 16. Faculty and students alike piled into the standing-room-only auditorium to view a replay of the first match followed by the broadcast of the second match. In addition to sharing the historic moment with the audience, Nyberg and IBM executives spoke briefly about Watson’s technology and the history leading up to Watson’s debut on Jeopardy!. 
The second match was slightly closer. Watson missed a Daily Double question for the first time and was in second after the first round as Jennings and Rutter were temporarily successful in consistently answering correctly before Watson. However, the match ended with Watson in the lead, and the total summed winnings over both matches were $77,147 for Watson, $24,000 for Jennings, and $21,600 for Rutter, which corresponded to prizes of $1 million, $300,000, and $200,000 for each of the players, respectively. Jennings and Rutter agreed to donate 50 percent of their winnings to charity, and IBM agreed to donate all of Watson’s winnings to charity. 
Many see the success of Watson on Jeopardy! as a milestone in computing, though many computer scientists believe that computers may never possess the human traits of creativity or ingenuity. In a recent interview with the Associated Press, CIT Dean Pradeep Khosla commented, “The way to think about this is: Can Watson decide to create Watson...? We are far from there. Our ability to create is what allows us to discover and create new knowledge and technology.”

When cancer begins to develop, it usually starts with the malfunction of a single cell. In the case of leukemia, it begins with an abnormal cell in the bone marrow of a patient, which multiplies faster than normal. Leukemia is a form of blood cancer that causes an abnormal production of white blood cells. It is the most prevalent terminal cancer in children, and makes up around 10 percent of all cancers in the United States. 
Although the survival rate for leukemia and lymphatic cancers has risen from 14 percent to over 50 percent since the 1960s, children under five diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) have a 90.8 percent chance of survival.
Since leukemia is a blood cancer, it causes an anomalous production of white blood cells called leukemia cells that inhibit the other stem cells from doing their job. Normal bone marrow produces stem cells that develop into red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets — which help form blood clots. Leukemia cells have a longer lifespan and cause anemia, an early sign of leukemia. With a decreased platelet and red and white cell count, patients bruise more easily, experience fatigue faster, and become more susceptible to infections. Doctors do not know the causes of leukemia, but there have been correlations to radiation exposure, typically due to previous chemotherapy dosage.
There are several types of leukemia that are classified according to which kind of white blood cell they affect and how quickly they develop. Chronic leukemia develops over time and sometimes does the work of normal white blood cells, while acute leukemia is more degenerative and worsens in a short amount of time, affecting mostly children. The most common form of leukemia in children is acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a type of malignant cancer in which white blood cells do not mature and wreak havoc on surrounding cells. According to www.webmd.com, doctors use bone marrow biopsies or lumbar punctures to determine if a patient has leukemia. These procedures involve withdrawing spinal fluid with a syringe and examining cell proteins to see if there is abnormal activity. In ALL, a similar process happens in the body, but the cancer affects lymphocytes instead, which are cells that eventually mature into B and T cells. Causes of ALL have also been traced to prenatal radiation exposure, according to www.medterms.com.
When patients are diagnosed with leukemia, they are first treated with chemotherapy, which involves a combination of drugs and radiation used to kill cancer cells. In cases where radiation and chemotherapy do not work, a bone marrow transplant is needed. This method consists of bone marrow from a donor, usually a close relative or immediate family member, so the donated cells can start to produce normal marrow cells. WebMD states that if this is successful, the marrow cells will take hold after one to three weeks and the patient will need to be in isolation to prevent infection (since the patient has a weakened immune system and no working white blood cells) and blood transfusions.
If all goes well, a patient will be cancer-free after a few weeks of chemotherapy and radiation. However, he or she will be required to have repeat visits to the doctor to ensure proper health quality and immunity. In worst case scenarios, a patient in remission will relapse and have to repeat the treatment all over again, but such cases are rare. 
To learn more about leukemia or other blood cancers, visit www.leukemia-lymphoma.org, where one can also donate or participate in a Team in Training walk, a charitable activity that raises money for leukemia research.

Many Carnegie Mellon students have the issue of negative environmental impact at the forefront of their minds, lending them to change their daily habits. For some, their efforts to be green extend further, into their car selection: For many, it becomes a choice between gasoline and diesel engines. The cases for both sides have evolved as technology has been developed to combat issues concerning the environment today. The main changes required to use diesel fuel are driving a different car, locating diesel fueling stations, and knowing the differences in fuel economy, greenhouse gas emissions, and other aspects that arise from using diesel as a fuel instead of gasoline. While diesel has merit to help an individual save money and prolong the life of his or her vehicle, it also has negative side effects.
Filling one’s tank with diesel does not require a different technique, and there are diesel fueling stations in all 50 states. In Pittsburgh especially, many gas stations also offer diesel fuel. However, engines that run on diesel fuel differ in their mechanics, which means that typical cars cannot be switched to use diesel without changing the engine entirely. Gasoline engines have a low compression ratio, which describes how much a combustion engine can be compressed, and is a measure of the amount of mechanical energy that can be extracted from the engine through combustion. In contrast, diesel engines ignite by compression alone using fuel injectors, which make them use the fuel more efficiently. For 2011, new cars that run on diesel include the BMW 335d sedan, the Mercedes R350, the Volkswagen Jetta, and the Volkswagen Golf, all of which have gas mileages from 18 to 30 miles per gallon in the city, and 24 to 42 miles per gallon on the highway. Most larger vehicles also use diesel, including some Ford models.
The benefits of using diesel fuel include higher fuel economy and lower costs generally. According to a study recently conducted by Carnegie Mellon’s Tepper School of Business, diesel cars are generally a better value than gasoline cars. Cars that use diesel fuel have higher residual value, which is an estimate of an object’s future worth. In some cases, the researchers observed residual values up to 30 percent higher for diesel, which indicates much lower depreciation. Diesel cars’ higher fuel economy also leads to lower vehicle operating costs. Since diesel fuel is more efficient (due to its higher density), each trip will require less fuel and will reduce money spent on fuel. Finally, the study, headed by economics professor Lester Lave, found that any disparity in initial vehicle costs was recovered within two years.
The disadvantages of using diesel fuel relate to environmental impact. Engines that run on diesel tend to emit more particulates like soot and nitrogen oxides, which contribute to smog formation. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), because diesel has a higher carbon content, it also emits more carbon dioxide per gallon of fuel consumed when compared to gasoline. However, the higher fuel economy of diesel reduces the amount of greenhouse gas emissions over the car’s lifetime. There are also certain fuel additives, such as smoke suppressants and detergent additives, that have been developed to decrease the effect of diesel fuel on the environment. Smoke suppressants are organic compounds that reduce the amount of soot emitted by diesel engines, but conversely also increase the number of ultra-fine particles released into the atmosphere, as well as overall sulfate emissions. Detergent additives are used to keep engines cleaner by removing oil deposits on fuel injectors, which also increases efficiency of the engine.
Advances have been made in diesel fuel to make it cleaner and a more viable alternative to petroleum. In 2006, the EPA instituted low sulfur requirements to try to lower emissions. Diesel fuel is also less odorful than in the past. Shell’s V-Power diesel, which is created by combining petroleum-based diesel with synthetic diesel, is especially clear and odorless. Diesel engines are much less noisy; this fact may be obvious when one rides certain Pittsburgh Port Authority buses. In 2009, the city bought 20 diesel-hybrid buses, which bear green paint and yellow swirls, and are actively used in conjunction with the Port Authority’s other diesel buses.

Regular walking raises chance of fracture
A five-year study on fracture occurrences in elderly Australian subjects has revealed a relationship between increased possibility of fracture and an exercise regime made up of frequent walking (three or more hours per week). Interestingly, subjects who spent two-and-a-half hours participating in vigorous physical activity did not have an association with increased fractures. All subjects were simultaneously assessed for sedentary behavior by documenting prolonged TV viewing; the study showed no correlation present between subjects with such behavior and increased fractures.

Mental control of prosthetics progresses
Prosthetic devices are being developed with a direct interface with the brain. Besides mechanical prosthetics, which are currently the main solution for amputees, there are also prosthetics that respond to stimulation from the remaining muscle on the patient’s limb. The prosthetics are being developed by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, the University of Pittsburgh, and other institutions to allow the user to control a prosthetic limb with 22 degrees of motion, including independent movement of each finger. Human clinical trials are slated to begin this summer.

Bilingual speakers are better multitaskers
A new study led by Ellen Bialystok at York University shows that bilingual speakers consistently outperformed monolingual English-speaking subjects when tested with the Simon test. The Simon test, which is meant to assess mental performance, showed that bilingual speakers may be more capable of dealing with distractions than monolingual speakers. Bialystok hypothesizes that the bilingual speakers have more practice with control because they must simultaneously be able to remember both sets of vocabulary and grammar while still maintaining a separation between the two languages.

Cell phones help maintain clean water
Haiti’s aid workers are using cell phones to help maintain clean and cholera-free drinking water. Each Haitian family is assigned one 19-liter bucket, which will now be affixed with a radio-frequency identification tag (RFID). Using cell phones with near-field communication capabilities, the aid workers will “read” the tags to confirm they have visited and treated the water. When the RFIDs are read, a text message will be sent to the nonprofit Deep Springs International headquarters so that the treatment can be tracked. This will allow workers to be deployed more efficiently to families with greater need.

Black bear hibernation revealed
A recent study at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks has revealed details about black bear physiology during hibernation. Unlike small hibernating rodents, whose temperatures can drop to nearly 0°C, the black bear body temperature only drops to 6°C. However, metabolism during the bears’ prolonged sleep decreases to 25 percent of its normal rate, and the heart rate is reduced from 55 beats per minute to nine beats per minute. Further studies are suggested to understand the biochemical causes of the animals’ reduced heart rate and metabolism.

**Anti-energy drink may combat insomnia **
New “relaxation beverages” are being marketed as an answer to insomnia and a way to simply get a better night’s sleep. The drinks, like energy drinks, offer chemical additives that change the natural cycles of the consumer. These drinks include ingredients such as melatonin, tryptophan, valerian root, and more. Such ingredients have been associated with a regular sleep cycle, though a cause-and-effect relationship has yet to be fully supported.

Rarely do college students take center stage in national debates about artistic plagiarism, but that’s exactly what happened to Carnegie Mellon first-years Joe Reilly, a CFA student, and Sean Hoffman, an H&SS student. Their video “What is The Creep” made national headlines after Saturday Night Live released a digital short, “The Creep,” that eerily echoed some of the elements of the Carnegie Mellon students’ video.
Reilly and Hoffman first developed the “Creep” dance at the beginning of the year. “So, it really all started Orientation week,” Hoffman said. “It actually started off as Joe Reilly’s idea. He was telling us about this comedian who once made this joke about how creepers usually walk with their arms out to the side and their hands like claws, and so what he started doing was following us around campus without us knowing, and [he] did a little dance.”
“For most of the semester, it was just an inside joke for fun,” Reilly said. “And then we were like, ‘Yeah, we could make a video,’ but everyone had work. And near the end of the semester, we were like, ‘We really should make a video,’ and we got a lot more time near finals week, so we started shooting then.” The two then posted the video on YouTube in mid-January. The video, titled “What is the Creep?”, features Hoffman and Reilly dancing the Creep at various locations around campus, creeping on unsuspecting students, and occasionally wearing a velociraptor mask, all to Justice’s song “Waters of Nazareth.”
Approximately a week after Hoffman and Reilly posted the video on YouTube, Saturday Night Live released a digital short called “The Creep” on its show. Although SNL’s video was of a higher production quality and contained an original song featuring Nicki Minaj, there are still some uncanny similarities between the two videos. In it, the Lonely Island trio sings about creeping while walking about with bended knees, clawed hands, and creepy smiles, similar to the dance in Hoffman and Reilly’s video. A Tyrannosaurus rex mask also makes an appearance near the end of the video.
“Our first thoughts were, ‘This is eerily similar,’” Hoffman said after seeing SNL’s “The Creep.” “We can see the claw thing going on, the bending of the knees ... and then, near the end of the video, we saw the T-rex head, and that’s when we were like, ‘Oh my God, there’s no way that this is just a coincidence.’ So, from there, we all got on our YouTube accounts and started looking up wherever the video had appeared, and started saying, ‘Hey, this is a rip-off of our video.’ But then the next morning we woke up and were like, ‘Well, we kind of overreacted a little bit,’ and we started removing our comments, but by that time other fans had seen it and started doing the same thing that we did, and our views started to go up.”
The duo’s fans were not the only ones who noticed the similarities between the videos; the magazine Rolling Stone took notice as well. Reilly’s mother had been high school friends with the artistic director at Rolling Stone, so when his mother posted the students’ video on Facebook, claiming that SNL had copied her son, the artistic director took notice.
“Sean and I were in biology [class], and I get a text from my mom that says, ‘Hey, call me soon, Rolling Stone is going to call you for an interview and I want to talk to you about it first,” Reilly recalled. “We were both just like, ‘What are you talking about?’ That was the longest last 20 minutes of that class ever.”
“We were shocked that it had grown from this small incident — this ‘mini controversy,’ as they called it in Rolling Stone’s article,” Hoffman said. When asked whether he had expected any major media to notice the similarities between the two videos, Reilly said, “We kind of hoped in the back of our minds.... That night [when SNL released its video] we sent out some things, we posted a couple of things on the Internet.... It was just kind of hopeful, like ‘maybe somebody will notice.’”
Soon enough, Saturday Night Live took notice of the mini controversy as well, releasing a statement to Rolling Stone saying, “We wrote and recorded the song over the summer, and [Nicki] Minaj recorded her part in November 2010, well before that video was made... That’s crazy that they have a T-rex head as well! I guess great minds really do think alike. And by great minds we mean ours and theirs. We enjoyed their dancing and hope they continue their creeping ways.”
“I was surprised with some of the stuff they said, like ‘Great minds think alike,’ and by minds, talking about ours and theirs,” Hoffman said. “I was shocked that they had even taken the time out of their day to even watch both of our videos, so it was pretty cool.”
When asked whether or not he believed SNL’s claim that it was all a coincidence, Hoffman said, “At first, after the article, we had thought, ‘Yeah, it was just a coincidence,’ but then other people in our dorm would come up to us and ask us, ‘Well, why didn’t you ask when the actual video was filmed?’... If they filmed the video in January after ours was released, you know, they could have rerecorded some of the audio or whatever [to incorporate the dance]. The song isn’t what we were debating over, it was the actual dance.... That was one of the questions we wanted to ask them but didn’t think of until later.”
Reilly said that he thought SNL’s response was “sketchy, just a bit.” He continued, “What they said about the song could be true, but it was weird because they didn’t mention the dance at all, or when that was created, so I guess that a possibility would be that they recorded the song, but then to look for ideas on how they should do in the skit exactly, they might have seen our video.”
The comments on Hoffman and Reilly’s YouTube video are indicative of how torn viewers are on the controversy. One user, edmundroessler, commented, “Dude they totally ripped you off ... it’s not like those guys had to do all the work as all these people seem to think it would take them so long ... gimme [sic] a break — they have a professional camera crew and sound guys and all that stuff ... and their version sucks anyway ... they aped you big time. Sue!”
Another user, shirey20, disagreed, commenting, “No doubt you guys do awesome moves, but the SNL skit looks nothing like this. They are imitating weird guys at a club, completely different from what you guys do. Both are funny, but they’ve probably been planning this for a while; I doubt they looked at this video and decided to copy it. Creepy guys have been around a while.”
Whether or not Saturday Night Live gleaned inspiration from the students’ video, the students have certainly benefited from the controversy: As of Sunday, their video had gained over 24,000 views on YouTube, and their follow-up video, “How to Creep,” had over 11,000 views. “We’re shocked that it even got that many views,” Hoffman admitted. “We were surprised [at the beginning], like, ‘Dude, we got 500 views! That’s so awesome!’ And then now, it’s like, ‘Hey, 20,000 views...’ We never knew it was going to be that big.”
These videos are not the end of the Creep, however. “In our next video, we really want to see if we can get some professors to do [the Creep],” Hoffman said. “We never were just going to stop at two videos. We have other ideas in the works.” Their videos are not going to be limited just to creeping; they are also thinking of creating a Tron-inspired video with students dancing on campus and in downtown Pittsburgh. “We have a lot of ideas,” Reilly said. They are planning on releasing at least one more video by the end of the semester. As Hoffman said, “This is just the beginning.”

The Mayur South Asian Student Alliance, or MayurSASA for short, presented its 2011 show “History Hungama” on Saturday, giving its viewers a true taste of Bollywood. Just like any Bollywood movie, it had fashion, a catching story line, and dances, resulting in a two-hour dose of good entertainment. The Mayur show also had an intermission for refreshments that offered a true taste of India. For those who do not know a lot about Bollywood, it’s extremely glamorous. It isn’t just about the story or the actors — rather, it’s about the whole production.
The storyline of “History Hungama” was a spinoff of Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego? Like many Bollywood movies, the plot followed the hero — or several heroes, in this case — who struggled and finally triumphed over the villain. The “History Hungama” story, while humorous and entertaining, still taught its audience about India, its culture, and important figures of Indian history. The plot revolved around two boys named Ram and Sham who go to a museum in India. While there, they see the statues of acclaimed movie director Meera Nair, cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar, famous scientist and astronaut Kalpana Chawla, famed freedom struggler Mahatma Gandhi, and Akbar, a Mughal ruler of India in the past. Also in this museum is a golden conch of historic value.
The two boys run into Carmen Sandiego at the museum and, swayed by her charm, help her steal the golden conch. This angers the statues at the museum and they come to life, forming an Indian “I-Team.” Carmen wants to go back to the past and alter it so as to eradicate the I-Team. This provided an opening to show off great historic moments — for example, it depicted the 1930 Salt March in India, when the Indian people marched to prepare their own salt in protest of the British Salt Tax that made it illegal to sell or produce salt. The show depicted each historic event with a twist. The play also explained the famous lagaan, or land tax, and presented the kingdom of the ancient Indian ruler Akbar.
In addition to the play, there was also glamor, dance, fashion, and music. Deewane, the South Asian a cappella group at Carnegie Mellon, also performed. These young men charmed the audience with their smooth voices. Their performance included both Bollywood songs and American ones. Deewane’s members also showed their Pittsburgh pride and sang “Black and Yellow.”
There was a multitude of dance performances at the Mayur show. The dance steps were innovative, and the dance groups, whose selections included both Bollywood and American songs, gave the original performers a run for their money. These dances provided a glimpse of the joy that is inherent within most Bollywood movies. The dances brought vibrancy and happiness to the song selections, expressing feelings that lyrics would not be able to do on their own.
Tanah, the all-female South Asian dance troupe at Carnegie Mellon, seems to out-do itself each year. The theme of the troupe’s performance this year was robots. Tanah’s performance was outstanding, and the dancers’ costumes were glamorous. Carnegie Mellon’s bhangra troupe, Chak De, was also full of life. Its performance was bright, big, and loud, leaving the audience with dropped jaws and constant cheering.
Bollywood is also about trends and style. Many people in India learn a lot about dress from these movies, and over time the demand for fashion in Bollywood has increased. This principle — the importance of fashion in Bollywood — was evident in the Mayur show’s fashion segment. The fashion show focused not only on Indian wear, but also on fusion wear. The costume collection was variable and high-quality, with professional-looking outfits, makeup, and poses.
From fashion to dancing, singing, and acting, there was something for everyone at “History Hungama.” Show chairs Naina Saxena, a business administration senior, and Gurmukh Singh Chhabra, a chemical engineering senior, did a phenomenal job of organizing a successful show.

Carnegie Mellon’s School of Music is renowned for the musical training it provides its music performance majors, but perhaps less well recognized is their music composition major. Last Friday, though, three of Carnegie Mellon’s music composition students got the chance to shine when the Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic performed its compositions at Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Hall.
The first composition of the evening was “Fanfare: A Short Piece for Symphonic Orchestra” by senior music and computer science major Robert Kotcher. It started off, as expected, with a high-energy trumpet fanfare. It sounded as though the trumpets were all playing different fanfares simultaneously, which occasionally sounded messy, but mostly sounded intricate and layered.
The piece alternated between high-energy fanfare and the eery sounds of quiet, high-pitched strings. Although the dynamic contrast might have been difficult for some orchestras to maneuver, the Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic was able to masterfully control its dynamics. As the title of the piece implies, the song was surprisingly brief, leaving the listener wanting more.
Next was a composition titled “Pirates!” by senior music major Rebecca Talisman. The beginning of the piece was reminiscent of an epic journey, evoking images of a rolling ocean. The tension built slightly with the cellos, but then inexplicably subsided into a soft, sweet section.
The oboe then came in with a solo, played beautifully by junior Amelia Cessna. The tension built once more into a louder section, but it still seemed too melodic and smooth for a song about “pernicious purloiners with booty on the brain,” as Talisman described her piece in the evening’s program notes. Like the first composition, “Pirates!” was startlingly short.
After Talisman’s piece, there was a brief intermission, and the stage was prepared not for a student composition, but rather for a performance of “Totentanz: Paraphrase on ‘Dies Irae’ for Piano and Orchestra” by Franz Liszt. The performance featured piano soloist Junyi Liu, a graduate student in the School of Music.
Liu’s fingers flew, seemingly effortlessly, across the keys as he played complex strings of notes. His playing had a marvelous expressive range — it sounded heart-achingly sweet during the piano’s solo cadenza, loud and forceful as he played with the orchestra, and even playful at one point as his fingers danced across the keys.
When playing a piece with a featured instrument, it can sometimes be difficult for orchestras to balance how loud they are with the volume the solo instrument; however, this was not a problem during Friday’s performance, as the orchestra struck the perfect dynamic balance between itself and Liu.
After the conclusion of “Totentanz,” Liu played a delicate piano encore that was sweet and, at times, hauntingly beautiful. As he ended the piece, he paused over the keys, letting stillness fill the room before sitting back to let the audience applaud.
The piano was then removed from the stage, and the orchestra prepared to play the final student composition of the evening, senior David Grabowski’s “L’Appel du Vide.” As Grabowski explained in the program notes, “‘L’Appel du Vide’ is a French phrase meaning literally ‘the call of the void....’ It is the urge to take the plunge, to do something unexpected.”
The composition started off quietly, with a single cello sustaining a long note; eventually, other instruments joined in on the note, building up until the music burst into a frantic — but not uncontrolled — cacophony of sound. The piece then alternated between beauty, mystery, and a frantic sense of urgency before bursting into something grand and beautiful. The contrast might not have boded well in the hands of a lesser orchestra, but the Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic was able to expertly navigate the sharp changes in mood and pace.
Overall, the Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic served as an excellent vehicle for the School of Music’s composition students to shine and to show off their variant compositional styles.

Radiohead is anything but normal. In its latest release, The King of Limbs, every moment of the album’s mere 37 minutes is an exercise in the abstract. To an infrequent listener who only really took notice after the release of In Rainbows, the strong basslines, odd time signatures, and hypnotic vocals seem to come from some alien world.
The first of the eight tracks, “Bloom,” starts off with a scattered loop that makes listeners double-check to see if their CD is skipping. This brings in an uncomfortable tension, warning listeners that this journey won’t be nearly as friendly as on Radiohead’s last album.
“Morning Mr. Magpie” picks up where “Bloom” leaves off, and a slick guitar loop gives it a jazzy attitude. “Magpie” feels much less scattered than “Bloom,” and a steady rhythm can be located within the varied loops.
“Little By Little” (not an Oasis cover, despite the same name) takes advantage of a more snarly Thom Yorke, accentuated by creeping progressions in the guitars. It comes off as more of the Radiohead sound that casual fans have come to expect, more like the brooding song “Creep” the music world has come to love.
“Feral” reminds listeners that this is no longer the safe, friendly Radiohead. Drums that drift in and out pulse along with a dubstep-styled bassline that throbs underneath Yorke’s soft singing.
“Lotus Flower” was revealed at some of Yorke’s solo shows and has more steady vocals over clean drums and synths. The song is Radiohead at its most accessible — “I would slip into your groove and cut me off,” Yorke sings, drawing listeners in with deceptively simple charms “just to feed your fast ballooning head” before he decides “now I will set you free.”
“Codex” is a moody, slow ballad driven by strong piano and Yorke’s beautiful vocals, which yearn for purification: “Slide your hand, jump off the end/The water’s clear and innocent.”
“Give Up The Ghost” starts with a creepy, looping request of “Don’t worry, don’t hurt me,” harmonized by the strumming of an elegant acoustic guitar. The resignation in the song, “I think I should give up the ghost/In your arms,” sounds like a scene from a tragic love story.
“Separator” is marked by Yorke’s occasional babbling and more eccentric drum beats from Phil Selway. The twittering guitar helps suggest that Radiohead has indeed “fallen out of everyone in a dream.” The song features a warning that “if you think this is over, then you’re wrong” and concludes the album with a request: “When I ask you again/Wake me up, wake me up.”
Some bloggers have speculated that “Separator” is warning us of another batch of songs that has yet to be released. With some release-date shenanigans by the band, including convoluted announcements and a last-minute change of plans, it wouldn’t be out of the question. The album itself manages to introduce some fresh ideas, but it starts to teeter back toward a sound reminiscent of previous albums. “Lotus Flower” and “Separator” look to be the focus of the album, while more off-the-wall songs like “Feral” and even the hardcore fan-friendly song “Little By Little” will likely be overlooked.

Even from the start screen, Test Drive Unlimited 2 looks like a massive game. The game starts out similar to the first TDU, with a cast of six characters to choose from. After a short tutorial, you wake up in the same Ferrari, but as a valet driver. This sets up the game like most other racing games — you start at the bottom and must work your way up. The story as a whole seems a bit generic. None of the characters have much depth, but that’s to be expected from a racing game.
The character customization is vastly improved from the first game. As in the first, you can customize your character’s outfit and buy houses, yachts, and a night club. The game now allows you to buy furniture for your properties, haircuts, and plastic surgery. You can also add stickers to customize your car, and these vinyls are much easier to place on your car than in many other racing games.
The game is centered on exploration. The world is massive, spanning the both the island of Ibiza in Spain and the island of Oahu in Hawaii. In addition to exploring each of the roads (still a huge undertaking, as in the first game), players must now find car wrecks and camera viewpoints to progress with their exploration. These encourage players to explore obscure locations away from the road and take advantage of the new wilderness areas that the game has to offer.
Test Drive is unique in that it allows players to roll down the window, control their blinkers, and sometimes control the sunroof or pop the trunk of their cars. The landscapes are lush and fully explorable, and the game has a dynamic weather and time system, meaning you can sit and watch the sunset and sunrise, and the weather shifts between sunny and rainy. These can drastically alter how you play the game, as low visibility and wet roads can be detrimental to your driving.
Off-road driving is arguably the most satisfying part of the game. Take a high-end sports car off-road, and you’re in for a terrible time. Luckily, there are a number of off-road vehicles that fix the problem. Bouncing around on dirt roads is a welcome change from the long stretches of pavement in most racing games. There is a good variety of off-road tracks, but it would have been nice to have a bit of variety in terms of terrain. While there are a few places where driving over rocks is possible, there are never any challenges that force you onto these places.
The racing aspect of the game is fairly well done, but it definitely doesn’t stand out among other more accurate physics engines. The various types of race events offer no real surprises, but the game takes advantage of the massive world by offering more unique events that allow you to interact with some of the locals by doing various missions for them. These have been expanded from the first game, and now include events such as tailing a cheating spouse and driving as recklessly as possible. The championships feel much easier than the races in the first game; the largest challenge is mostly the roads themselves.
The online aspect of the game also sets it apart from the rest. You can join car clubs and compete against other clubs, race on user-created routes, or just challenge another racer you see driving past you on the street. The game is constantly connected, so the in-game world is populated with other racers on the streets. This gives the game significant depth and makes up for the low difficulty of single-player play.

The classic rock musical Hair made its way to Heinz Hall as a part of the PNC Broadway Across America National Tour last week. As the curtains opened Tuesday night, the backdrop of a neon sun with a Vietnam War-era jeep parked on the corner of the stage readied audience members to put on their psychedelic glasses and prepare to be transported to the 1960s.
Calling for peace and freedom now, with posters like “Lay Don’t Slay” and “I saw God and She’s Black,” Hair attacks pressing issues of the 1960s. The story is centered around Berger (played by Nicholas Belton in Tuesday’s production), Clide (Paris Remillard), and their tribe of hippie friends. Berger first introduces himself as an Aquarius. According to him, Aquarians are destined for greatness or madness. Living in the 1960s, it seems that his statement is meant to apply more broadly to the generation as a whole.
Both Berger and Clide are Vietnam bait. After receiving their draft cards, they must decide whether to burn their draft cards or serve their country. They question dying for a country they are not accepted in and for a cause they don’t believe in. They believe that the draft is “white people sending black people to make war on yellow people who stole [land] from red people.”
Berger, Clide, and the rest of their tribe are disillusioned by society, their parents, and religion. They find their own form of protest through long, unruly hair. Hair becomes their religion. Hair differentiates them from streamlined society and their parents’ generation.
The clash of generations is just one of the many themes that the musical deals with. Clide’s father angrily tells Clide that America “had another generation before you that went to war and college.” Clide, on the other hand, sees his parents as woefully out-of-touch “electronic dinosaurs” and “cybernetic idiots” who do not understand what he is protesting against.
Hair is meant to be controversial and inspire emotion and thought. In the first act, Berger tells the audience up front to “turn on your eyes, ears, skin [because] this is a trip to live through.”
During intermission, audience member Maggie Luther described Hair as a “very interactive experience — an in-your-face musical.” At different points, the actors led protests down the aisle, distributed flowers through the rows, and even embraced select ticket holders.
Hair underwent a revival in 2009. Two Carnegie Mellon alumni — Andrew Kober (CFA ’06) and Tommar Wilson (CFA ’99) — both won Best Revival of a Musical awards for their efforts in this rendition of Hair. While the signature moments of Hair have stayed the same, the 2009 edition slightly edited the script to give women a greater dialogue and to explore a longer hallucinogenic sequence in the second half.
Luther believes that the updated show has been able to retain its relevancy in today’s world. “It pertains [to] people still fighting to be free and express themselves,” she said. “Especially like the situation occurring in Egypt today.”
Audience member Stever Tamulsa thought that this version “looks different, but feels similar.” He believed that “_Hair_ translates well over time. The only thing,” he said, “was that I felt like they hadn’t modernized it. Not being modernized didn’t deter from the production though.”
Audience member Phil McEntee remembered seeing the musical when it first came out. Watching it again, he felt that it “seem[ed] dated and a little bit naive, but the basic principles are the same. Like the Beatles say, ‘Love is all there is,’ and this is all about love. The musical recalls a time that has gone by, and by seeing it tonight, I get to re-live that.”

I decided to be a little productive during the summer after my freshman year. I knew that I still needed credit for a macroeconomics class, and the London School of Economics (LSE) was an obvious place to take it. I had been to London as a kid, but I couldn’t really recall anything about it except for Madame Tussaud’s and Big Ben, so I was excited at the prospect of spending a month exploring the city a little deeper on my own.
As I went to register myself on the first day at LSE, I was struck by how the cramped campus and its narrow streets contrasted the lawns and open spaces at Carnegie Mellon. This should have been expected, though, given that the school’s buildings are located right in the center of the city, with the shopping and entertainment districts of Covent Garden and Leicester Square just a few minutes away by foot. The proximity of all the buildings was ideal for summer school because it meant that you could mingle with a broad range of students from all over, even if the actual program was for a relatively short time.
The residence halls near the main campus were definitely worth writing home about — they seemed more like hotels than the dorms we are used to here. (I would recommend staying in High Holborn or Grosvenor House.) Some of them had a lavish breakfast buffet laid out every morning in the lounge area, while others had arcade rooms and full-service bars. As if we weren’t spoiled enough by all of that, housekeeping would clean our rooms and change towels and bedsheets every other day. We didn’t have an RA or a formal welcoming, so the responsibility fell on us to introduce ourselves to our floormates and others living in nearby residences as we got familiar with the exciting surroundings.
I had arrived in London after England was eliminated from soccer’s World Cup, but even then, the excitement and fanfare surrounding the tournament was palpable. The European students at LSE never let us forget that the tournament was reaching its concluding stages, and you could easily tell which teams were playing that night by looking at the dominant colors around the room. By the time the final came around, the streets were quiet and everyone without exception seemed to be wearing either orange or red in support of the Netherlands or Spain. The Spanish contingent roared loudly at every successful pass and took to the streets with its flags and vuvuzelas as its team pulled off a long-awaited win, much to the amusement of my friends from Vanderbilt, who were more than happy just getting used to the easy availability of pubs within the college grounds.
The classes themselves were pretty hectic, but the experience was definitely unique. In one class, I had the chance to work with central bankers from other parts of Europe who were either taking the class as a part of an executive education program or because they had retired and were in it “for fun.” We didn’t have any quizzes or graded homework, but the four-hour lectures each day were preparing us for two exceptionally difficult exams. Luckily, our Vietnamese professor and class teacher (equivalent to a TA) from Australia took the time to get to know each of us personally and pushed us to learn as much as summer students could.
During the weekends, I would spend time with some other friends from Carnegie Mellon and my old high school, who were also taking classes in England for the summer. The famed Tube made it easy for us to go anywhere we liked in a matter of minutes, which was great because there was so much to do that we kept changing our minds every couple of hours or so. Some of the highlights included watching The Lion King at the Lyceum, almost getting frostbite in an ice bar, and a night cruise down the Thames. And of course, living in central London meant that you would never have to eat at the same place twice and could eat at reasonable prices, too. The restaurants in the Seven Dials area and Oxford Street are definitely worth a visit, as is Nando’s, a Portuguese-themed fast-food joint.
The end came abruptly. I was just getting used to life there, but I guess separation anxiety is common to anyone who is just about to leave after spending time studying abroad. There is an impression among some that London is gloomy and dull, but for me it was an experience that represented the best of what life has to offer: good food and great people, with every locality having a mood and pace of its own — a city that is steeped in rich history and dotted with cultural landmarks and is at the same time absorbing for thrill-seeking college-aged travelers.

On a fateful day in 2002, you played Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3. From that day on, Motörhead drilled its beer-spitting, sweaty motorcycle romps into your brain.
Motörhead is pure. Motörhead is consistent. Motörhead is the anthem of every ballistic missile that’s waiting to rip across the stratosphere and ravage cities whole.
Motörhead is the distillation of a sound unbounded. Unlike most bands that haven’t changed their sound in over 30 years, Motörhead’s sound still rings true. Fans flock day in and day out to go see the loud black-clad ensemble. In short, if you like Motörhead, you like everything that the group has recorded in its 35-year existence as a band. The over-the-top umlaut in its name would spell disaster for any other band, but Motörhead pulls it off and makes you think it invented the symbol. When these musicians play their straight-ahead, black leather-clad romps into your brain, the audience knows they’re preaching the faith of rock ’n’ roll.
When on the microphone, Ian Fraser “Lemmy” Kilmister squints at every word he squeezes out of his smoke-clawed vocal chords. I seriously wonder how Lemmy’s vocal chords, like Tom Waits’, have made it through the guttural mayhem that Lemmy has put them through.
Interestingly, he’s been the only constant member of Motörhead through the past 35 years. It is this rotating cast of members that has allowed Motörhead to inculcate its bona-fide grit-rock into the skulls of millions worldwide. Motörhead has become an ethos, and any performance by Motörhead is a channeling of that undefinable hell-raising ethos. Young or old, once you get Motörhead in your veins, it’s there to stay.
So, If you’re ready to listen to that mean, chain-smoking, Yuengling-guzzling, toe-tapping, fist-clenching sound once more, some songs I recommend would include “Mean Machine,” off Orgasmatron; “Blackheart,” off Rock ’N’ Roll; and “Whorehouse Blues,” off Inferno.

Tangled
Friday, Feb. 25
8 10 12
Walt Disney Animation’s latest theatrical film was Tangled, a musical film largely based on the fairy tale of Rapunzel. In the movie, we follow the life of Rapunzel, a princess whose hair contains magical powers — so long as it is never cut. Kidnapped early on in life and confined in a tower, she has never known freedom until a series of events around her 18th birthday allow her to do just that. Fun fact: This was the second most expensive movie ever made, just $40 million behind the third Pirates of the Caribbean movie. You'd think they could have spent just a tad bit more to take the record, eh?

The Activities Board will be showing the Oscars on its mammoth screen in McConomy this Sunday for all you film buffs out there. Want to be one of the first to know if Christian Bale, Black Swan, Natalie Portman, or any of the dozens of other movie and actor nominees will take home the hardware? Well, this is one of the better environments to be in to find out. Plus, you can heckle what’s sure to be another long and drawn-out show that is only slightly improved by James Franco and Anne Hathaway, as they will probably do some very silly things as they host the broadcast.

Apparently, engineering and science graduates were 100 percent employed by the end of the previous summer, an outstanding number unless you look at the fine print. Those still unemployed by August were snapped up by Carnegie Mellon as janitors ­— at least, allegedly.

Dear Hoskins Brothers,
Recently, I’ve taken up the new extreme sport of bear boxing. Essentially, you go into the woods and box a bear with your bare hands. But I’m new to the sport and am worried about injuries. Do you have any tips for the amateur bear boxer?
Sincerely,
Boxing Endangered Animals Rocks
Dear BEAR,
This may be the dumbest idea ever. Bears are deadly, deadly animals. They are one-ton killing machines, complete with claws, teeth, and a nasty disposition. Think you can outrun one? Brown bears can reach speeds of 30 miles an hour. Climb up a tree? So can they. In short, bears are our evolutionary superiors. I for one look forward to our new ursine overlords.
If you do intend to go through with this, then you have to take the one advantage humans have: fighting dirty. Build a trap, like Arnold Schwarzenegger did in Predator. Then, jump on the bear’s back and put it in a choke hold. The bear will probably try to scrape you off against a tree or something, and then eat you. Really, there’s no way this can turn out well. Unless you want to wind up like James Franco in 127 Hours, I’d stay out of the woods.
This isn’t real, don’t try this,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Hoskins Brothers,
Ever since Watson won Jeopardy!, I worry humans will be replaced. How can we keep up with a machine so smart and quick? What if they make a Price is Right robot? How can I keep myself from being replaced by a machine?
Sincerely,
Worried About Robot Takeover
Dear WART,
Trust me, there are already robots that could win at The Price is Right. All they need to win is the ability to bet one dollar higher than the guy next to them. Really, there’s nothing to be worried about from Watson. It’s still several years away from commercial use — and even then, it’s only good at answering questions.
The fact of the matter is, most jobs can be replaced by machines. Some of the safest, and best, jobs will be designing these new robotic workers — at least until the Singularity, when these jobs are replaced by machines too. Honestly, the best career plan is to become a survivalist who lives in the woods. That way, when either the inevitable robotic zombie uprising occurs, you’ll be the one taking out robotic zombies, saying, “I told you so.”
Or just ask them about U.S. cities,
Brian Hoskins

Carnegie Mellon’s weekly “Speak Your Mind Dinner and Dialogue” series held a discussion last Thursday about Hosni Mubarak’s Feb. 11 resignation from the Egyptian presidency and the revolution that caused it.
The event was organized by Amal El-Ghazaly, a senior electrical engineering major who has family in Egypt. Khalid El-Arini, a doctoral student in computer science, and Nico Slate, a history professor, facilitated. El-Arini also has relatives in Egypt.
Over hummus and pita bread, students and faculty discussed how and why Egypt got to this point.
One major cause of the revolution, El-Arini believes, was satellite television, especially cable news. “Satellite TV is very prevalent in countries like Egypt,” El-Arini said. “Even the poorest ramshackle hut in the village, like my ancestral village where my parents grew up on the Nile delta — they might not have lots of other things, but they have a satellite dish.”
In recent years, citizens of Egypt have been able to watch news channels other than the state-sponsored one. For the first time they can see a relatively uncensored, and sometimes critical, view of their government.
El-Arini said that technology also played a role in the revolution. “I don’t want to call it the Facebook and Twitter revolution, but clearly these were tools that helped people. You have this young generation of Egyptians and Tunisians who are very Internet-literate, and they were able to organize on Facebook. So we have the Google exec who starts a Facebook group to start a revolution that’s broadcast on Twitter and YouTube. I don’t think you can have a more high-tech revolution than that.”
Youths were not only helpful because of their tech savvy, but also because of their prevalence. The overall populations of Egypt, Iran, and much of the Middle East have grown younger in the past few decades.
“The majority of the people that went out into the streets were younger than [Mubarak’s regime],” El-Ghazaly said. “They were born after he started ruling.”
“It’s not just that young people are more inclined to go out and protest, which they are,” Slate said. “It’s also that young people need jobs, and they want good jobs, and they want to not just be at the level of their families, but they want to actually go further than that.”
Reactions from outside Egypt are also possible factors in the protests. Expatriates and their families, in particular, supported their relatives in the country. After the Egyptian government paid people to pose as pro-Mubarak protesters — and to beat the opposition protesters with whips — El-Ghazaly called her aunt. “I told her that everyone in my family better not leave the streets; they better stay there and fight for their country, and keep pushing for it, because they have made progress and they should keep going.”
International eyes may have stayed on Egypt, Slate said, because of the expanding role of international media. “There was just too much information for people to get the wrong story,” he said. Reports of journalists such as CNN’s Anderson Cooper being beaten in protests curried favor with the outside world. Such incidents also incited journalists to cover the story more aggressively. “Egypt became [Cooper’s] personal crusade over the next two weeks,” El-Arini said. “My uncle called me from Egypt, where he gets CNN, and said, ‘You know, Anderson Cooper, I think he’s Egyptian now.’ He took it personally. And everybody watches Anderson Cooper.”
After the group established some of the main causes of the revolution, the discussion turned to the future, both inside and outside of Egypt. Just as the successful ouster of longtime dictator Ben Ali in Tunisia sparked the Egyptian protests, Egypt’s widely covered and successful revolution has inspired citizens of other Middle Eastern countries to take to the streets. Movements have started or restarted in Iran, Yemen, and Bahrain. Nobody, however, is sure of how successful the new revolutions will be. Richer regimes, especially those with more violent militaries, may be harder to topple.
“I remember when the article came out about people being offered a certain amount of money in Cairo to side with the regime,” Slate said. “Well, you have to put yourself in such a person’s shoes. This calculation’s going to go through their head. How likely is my participation going to make a difference? How much money is being offered to me, and what’s that money going to do in my life?”
Slate had similarly pessimistic views about Egypt’s future. “My concern is that even if these protests lead to some form of democracy, that whatever form that takes will be structured in a fashion that it won’t change fundamentally the realities that led so many people to protest in the first place,” he said.
He admitted, however, that there are other possibilities. In particular, Slate believes, it is possible that Egypt’s “leaderless revolution” could lead to a more egalitarian and diverse democracy than even the United States, which, after all, has a history of being led by wealthy white men.
El-Arini took an optimistic view. “I don’t think we should underestimate the psychological effects this revolution has had on the people of Egypt,” he said. “I talk to my uncle or aunt in Egypt, [and] they say that people are volunteering to do everything. Tahrir Square has never looked so clean. Across Cairo, people are getting out and doing things. They’ve taken their country back.” Moreover, he said, many of the country’s brightest expatriates — including a Nobel Prize winner in chemistry — are considering moving back to Egypt to help out.
People in Egypt are not the only ones feeling the effect of the revolution. El-Arini is proud of and excited about a democratic Egypt. “I was born in Virginia,” he said. “Whenever someone would ask me, ‘Where are you from?’, even if they were clearly trying to figure out my ethnic background, I would say, ‘I’m from Virginia.’ And they’d say, ‘No, where are you really from?’ I’d say, ‘Fairfax County.’ But a professor walked by my office last week and said, ‘Are you Egyptian?’ And for the first time in my life, I said yes.”

Title IX, best known for its impact on high school and collegiate athletics, also has a direct effect on single-sex organizations like the Girl Scouts and the Boy Scouts, as well as fraternities and sororities. As a campus with 17 percent of the undergraduate population involved in Greek life, Carnegie Mellon is largely affected by this law.
The law states, “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance....”
Despite the existence of Title IX, single-sex organizations like fraternities and sororities have remained intact over the years. This is due to a clause under Title IX that states, “This section shall not apply to membership practices ... of a social fraternity or social sorority which is exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of Title 26, the active membership of which consists primarily of students in attendance at an institution of higher education.”
The exclusion of social fraternities and sororities from Title IX has allowed Greek life to grow on its own terms on many collegiate campuses, but not without controversy. 
“In the past, there have been challenges faced by these organizations due to men and women wanting to join groups that are specified toward the opposite sex,” said Brittani Grant, president of Carnegie Mellon’s Panhellenic Council and a junior civil and environmental engineering major.
“So the issue that is currently going toward Congress is whether there is still a need for single-sex organizations as well as whether current groups exempt from Title IX are conducting themselves in a manner that shows them as single-sex organizations,” Grant said.
Many colleges are finding instances of extreme intermingling between social fraternities and sororities, such as the adoption of sorority women as honorary members of Interfraternity Council (IFC) fraternities. This intermingling, which often includes these “little sisters” having voting rights during recruitment, is argued to negate the purpose of a single-sex organization.
To address this rising issue, the National Panhellenic Council (NPC) passed a resolution last October stating that Panhellenic sororities could no longer participate in fraternity recruitment. “If sororities are questioned about why they should remain single-sex organizations, this NPC resolution will show that we are taking steps to preserve the standards of the organizations,” said Monica Bebie, coordinator of Greek life at Carnegie Mellon. 
By refraining from participation in fraternity recruitment, sorority women not only hope to distinguish themselves as strictly single-sex organizations, but also hope to promote values-based recruitment.
“Fraternities and sororities will always work together to support one another in their individual endeavors, but NPC wanted to make sure that new members are joining fraternities for the right reasons like the goals and values of the fraternity, not the girls that they would get to meet from being a part of the organization,” Grant said. “Although this has not been much of an issue for the Greek community on Carnegie Mellon’s campus, it is still necessary for Carnegie Mellon’s Panhellenic Council to put a resolution in place to address the specific issues regarding women and men’s recruitment.”
Some of the 1,045 of 6,020 undergraduates in fraternities and sororities at Carnegie Mellon are wondering how this resolution will directly affect them. 
Grant, who is working with others in the community to put a plan of action in place, said, “I don’t have specifics of what [our campus’s] resolution will look like at the moment, but I can guarantee that something will be put in place by the end of the semester and therefore will have an effect on Panhellenic women’s involvement in fraternity recruitment in the fall.”
The resolution could mean anything from sorority women not being able to go to fraternity houses during recruitment to refraining from liking a fraternity’s rush on Facebook. 
One thing is certain, however: Greek life is determined to remain as single-sex organizations.
“Historically, Greek life has been about groups coming together saying ‘we need a social outlet....’ Men started fraternities and then women wanted that opportunity too,” Bebie said. “Keeping fraternities and sororities same-sex benefits everyone because women can talk about issues as they relate to women and vice versa with men. We [Greek life] are a huge, huge value add to campus.”
Especially at Carnegie Mellon, social fraternities and sororities offer a community for strengthening gender relationships.

There was a prolonged power outage on Tuesday at the Morewood Gardens residence hall.
In addition to the living areas, the computing cluster, exercise room, laundry facilities, the Underground, and the offices of Housing and Dining Services were also affected by the power outage. As a result, all these areas were cut off from internet access.
Fortunately, the event occurred during a time when most students were in classes, meaning the worst they would probably have to deal with was a reset clock. “[The power outage] was around noon on a weekday, when nobody is around usually,” said Dane Pieri, a Morewood resident assistant (RA).
For the students who were in Morewood at the time of the outage and working online or on a desktop computer, the sudden loss of electricity and Internet was more disruptive.
“I was present for the most recent outage, however, and the general feeling was one of distress and confusion,” said sophomore biomedical and chemical engineering major Harrison Rose. “The outage caused an online assignment to be submitted late, and I know of many students with desktop computers who [remotely] access their files from the various labs around campus who inevitably would have lost that access, probably resulting in some exasperated swearing.”
“It was mostly just really annoying,” said sophomore computer science major Mary K. Nestor. “I was getting ready for class, and suddenly the lights went out.”
Not all the Morewood residents had as much at stake in electricity and connection to the Internet as Rose did. For them, the power outage was merely an inconvenience. For example, Jane Lew, another RA in Morewood, wasn’t even initially aware that she lost her electricity.
“I did not notice that the power was out until about 10:50 a.m., when I noticed that my computer was not charging,” she explained. Lew also said that the reaction was similar among the other people on her floor: “None of my residents contacted me about this situation,” Lew said. “I don’t think the power outage posed as a real emergency for my residents at the time.”
According to Rose, such power outages are not unusual for Morewood. “I would say this happened three to four times this semester,” he said. “I was not always around for the outages; however, I would [often] return to the room to find the clocks reset.”
Rather than wait for the power to come back on, students decided to head out to areas of campus with power to continue their work. “Personally, I waited a while and then went to Gates because there was no Internet,” Pieri said. “I came back a while after I heard the power was back.” Rose also added, “I went straight to a cluster with my documents on a thumb drive.”
The outage only lasted a few hours, and many Morewood residents were away and didn’t realize it had happened.
There is not yet an official explanation from the administration about why the power outage happened, although, according to Pieri, “there was a sign on the door saying that it was because of Duquesne Light.”

Recently, young adults have been taking advantage of the opportunity to travel, as the number of students studying abroad has been on the rise. Carnegie Mellon’s Office of International Education (OIE) and its study abroad office offer 43 university-sponsored programs in 26 countries, providing various options for students.
Last year, a total of 488 Carnegie Mellon students traveled abroad, just under half of whom went through Carnegie Mellon’s own study abroad programs. The opportunity is becoming more common, as this number is almost double the number of students who studied abroad in the 2005–06 school year.
Although there has been a recent decrease in students spending an entire academic semester abroad, there is an increase in students traveling over “short-term” periods, such as spring and winter breaks.
Jaycie Galbraith, one of the two coordinators of Carnegie Mellon’s study abroad and exchange programs, gave some insight into the usual decisions of students pursuing a global experience.
“Most students go abroad during their junior year,” Galbraith said, “but we’re seeing increasing numbers during the sophomore and senior year.”
She also said that it’s “a common misconception” for students to believe that they can’t go abroad because of the restrictions of their major. Galbraith stated — and the statistics support her assertion — that students from every major offered at Carnegie Mellon have studied abroad this past year.
Though the word “study” is included in the term studying abroad, students agree that the experience should not be solely academic.
“I would caution people ... from overloading ... during their semester abroad,” said Peter Hendrickson, a junior policy management major who studied in Cape Town, South Africa.
The Tepper School of Business and the College of Humanities and Social Sciences (H&SS) make up half of all students going abroad. Though it requires careful planning and consultations with both major-specific and study-abroad advisers, the possibility should not be ruled out for anyone.
Zach Stockwell, a junior information systems major who studied in Copenhagen, Denmark, said that he’d encourage students to study abroad “in a heartbeat.”
As far as destinations go, Europe is the most popular destination, with 155 of the 488 students venturing there, while 30 went to Oceania. A total of 51 countries were represented, including some non-traditional countries such as Nepal, Cyprus, and the Cook Islands. China was the most-visited country with 45 students, followed by Germany with 29 and finally South Africa with 27.
Although the opportunity to study abroad created new opportunities for students, they couldn’t help but miss a bit of home. “Mexican food,” said Stockwell, was what she missed most.
“Peanut butter ... and the lack of mosquitoes,” added Karalyn Baca, a senior Hispanic studies major who studied in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Despite any homesickness, most students look back on their time abroad as an absolutely positive experience.
Financial constraints can often make or break a decision regarding studying abroad. But students should know that there is help available, both internally and externally. 
Through Carnegie Mellon alone, there are 22 scholarships, funds, and grants for traveling abroad. 
Going through non-university-sponsored schools might not have a great amount of aid available, but external organizations often have their own scholarships and awards solely for students in that program. Students can receive a stipend from the university if they use a university-sponsored program. Covering necessary goods like meals and housing, the stipend can be an incentive to go through a the university’s program. An added benefit of these programs is that all Carnegie Mellon financial aid will carry over.
In short, studying abroad is an option for all students at Carnegie Mellon, regardless of their college or major. There are dozens of locations and financial options, so if there’s an interest, there’s a possibility.

Spring film festival presents ‘Faces of Migration’ series
From March 17 to April 10, the Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival’s “Faces of Migration” will explore the experiences of migration, ranging from leaving the old country to arriving in a new one. 
The festival will feature 15 independent, award-winning films that are debuting in Pittsburgh and are not available to the general public. Jolanta Lion, the festival director and assistant director of the Humanities Center, picks  the films.
The first event will occur on March 2 at 8 p.m. in McConomy Auditorium, with a preview of the Dutch film Separations. 
Directed by Andréa Seligmann Silva and Mieke Bal, the film addresses the story of Silva’s family and its history of migration, from an escape from the Nazis to the present day. After the film, students can attend a discussion on family, Jewish identity, and migration hosted by Bal.
Highlights of the festival include the International Student Short Film Competition, with selected films by undergraduate and graduate students on April 10 at 5 p.m. at Kelly Strayhorn Theater. 
The Pittsburgh Latino group “Jóvenes Sin Nombres” (Youths Without Names) will also present a short film that it produced with the help of Carnegie Mellon’s Center for the Arts in Society. The group’s work will be displayed before the two screenings of Immigrant Nation! The Battle for the Dream.
Chemistry professor wins prestigious 2011 Wolf Prize
Professor Krzysztof Matyjaszewski of the chemistry department has won the prestigious 2011 Wolf Prize in chemistry for “deep creative contributions to the chemical sciences.” He is the J.C. Warner Professor of the Natural Sciences.
Every year, the Wolf Foundation selects recipients in four of five categories, including agriculture, chemistry, mathematics, medicine, and physics. 
The prize will be presented by the Israeli president and minister of education in May.
Other chemists honored along with Matyjaszewski are Stuart Alan Rice of the University of Chicago and Ching Tang of the University of Rochester. They will all be granted their awards on May 29 at a ceremony at the Israeli Parliament.
Matyjaszewski was born in Poland and received his doctorate from the Polish Academy of Sciences in 1976. He finished his postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Florida in 1977. He was then a research associate at the Polish Academy of Sciences from 1978 to 1984. 
In 1985, Matyjaszewski arrived at Carnegie Mellon and was appointed to his current position. 
In 2004, he received the honor of University Professor, the highest distinction of a faculty member at Carnegie Mellon.

The Chinese government will stop at nothing to censor its people. In particular, social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter continue to be a main target for government censorship.
With the government’s “Great Firewall” selectively blocking Internet traffic to the outer world, China’s censorship is comprehensive and incredibly complex. Not only does China censor more content than other countries, but officials also remain deliberately ambiguous about what content is being censored and why. There is no transparency and no communication between the government and its citizens, limiting how people can debate or fight the established system.
In an attempt to keep its people happy, the Chinese government created its own heavily monitored social networking sites based on Facebook. These sites, though accomplishing the goal of connecting people across the vast country, are not an improvement from or an adequate compromise to the firewall. They are still completely under the government’s control, which leaves their users little freedom. The government still has the authority to censor and block whatever content it chooses on these sites.
There is hope for the Chinese people, however. Rising against the oppressive nature of the government, they have found ways to subvert authority. Although the costs are high, some Chinese Internet users have begun using Virtual Private Network (VPN) services to get around the country’s firewall. VPNs are traditionally used by businesses to give employees secured access to their corporate networks because they use private proxy servers that encrypt data.
Taking advantage of the VPNs, the Chinese people have found a way to subvert Internet constrictions. The VPNs allow Chinese users to anonymously browse and explore the Internet with unbounded freedom, and — most importantly — without censorship of any kind. 
This loophole opens up access to the actual sites of Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube for anyone in China to enjoy. As a result, China’s Facebook usage has exploded; the number of users has septupled between January and February of this year. 
The Chinese government cannot censor every piece of information from its people. The futility of trying to control the amount and type of information received by the public, when technology is constantly creating new ways to obtain that information, cannot be clearer than in the Chinese people’s use of VPNs. 
With the outer pressure of world news and the inner pressure of the Chinese people, we doubt that the government will be able to keep up its repressive censorship policies. We applaud the ingenuity of the Chinese people and their efforts to express themselves and their opinions despite heavy government intervention.

A year ago, Curtis Mitchell died while Pittsburgh was buried under a massive blizzard. He did not, however, die from exposure. In a striking incident of callousness, paramedic Josie Dimon demanded that he walk four blocks to a waiting ambulance. 
As transcribed by the Pittsburgh Post Gazette, upon hearing that Mitchell was unable to walk Dimon remarked over the radio, “He ain’t [expletive] comin’ down, and I ain’t waitin’ all day for him. I mean, what the [expletive], this ain’t no cab service.” One of her colleagues said, “Ah well, he’ll be fine.” Mitchell was not fine. A few hours later, by the time another ambulance reached him, he was dead.
He died because Pittsburgh’s emergency first responders did not put forth enough effort to save him. When this event came to light in February of last year, the people of Pittsburgh were justifiably outraged. The paramedics and dispatchers responsible were disciplined, and Dimon was fired. After a year of lawsuits and appeals, an arbitrator reinstated Dimon last Tuesday and awarded her back pay for almost the entire time she was off the job. We are appalled at the arbitrator’s decision to ignore Dimon’s irresponsible actions and compromise the integrity of the city’s emergency workers.
By reinstating Dimon, the arbitrator has essentially validated her actions during the blizzard. According to a report released by city Public Safety Director Michael Huss after the incident, the medic was terminated for failing to call for a four-wheel-drive vehicle, failing to go after Mitchell on foot, making inappropriate radio transmissions, and failing to render the respect due a patient. While we acknowledge that the extreme circumstances of last February’s blizzard no doubt heightened stress for paramedics, Dimon’s actions were inexcusable.
As a member of the National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians and under the EMT code of ethics, a paramedic’s primary responsibility is “to conserve life, to alleviate suffering, to promote health, to do no harm, and to encourage the quality and equal availability of emergency medical care.” The code goes on to state that “the Emergency Medical Technician shall maintain professional competence and demonstrate concern for the competence of other members of the Emergency Medical Services health care team.”
We find it incomprehensible that Dimon could demand that Mitchell — in pain and unable to move — walk to her ambulance when she, in good health, refused to walk four blocks to save his life. We find it almost as incomprehensible that an arbitrator could see nothing wrong with Dimon’s behavior, nothing that warranted termination or discipline.

With increased awareness of cyber-bullying, we are both surprised and disappointed that students at Carnegie Mellon have recently been perpetuating this form of bullying through online forums. For college students all over the United States, anonymous forum posting has become a major source of gossip and rumor. 
Websites like College ACB, or College Anonymous Confession Board, have become extremely traffic-heavy, with new threads and comments being added by the hour. Many students and faculty have taken a stand against College ACB and other websites of its nature, and until now such sites have always been hosted outside of Carnegie Mellon and never from within.
This past week, however, flyers advertising a new anonymous forum, www.CMUfeed.com, were posted throughout campus. 
Found in bathrooms, dorm rooms, and halls of various academic buildings, these flyers showed the significant amount of effort the creators of this forum put in to popularizing their website.
Visually similar to a Twitter feed, CMUfeed allowed students to post comments on topics as arbitrary as the weather, as well as on distasteful and spiteful threads involving specifically named students. The site essentially marketed itself as a Carnegie Mellon-only version of College ACB, with the same type of hurtful gossip, rumors, and slander filling the forum.
Although the creators of the website removed much of its content by last Saturday, posting instead a message claiming that they were unhappy with the nature of the content being posted, we have to ask — what were they expecting?
CMUfeed, as an anonymous feed, presented the same hazard as websites like College ACB and its controversial predecessor, JuicyCampus. College ACB was founded in 2008 under the name JHUConfessions.com, pertaining solely to students at Johns Hopkins University. It has since turned into an anonymous forum for over 500 colleges across the United States. 
Forums like JuicyCampus, College ACB, and CMUfeed do little but perpetuate divisiveness and bad feelings on college campuses. Threads on the Carnegie Mellon page of College ACB provoke personal attacks and damage reputations through rumor, with threads discussing topics like “who is the biggest slut?” to “reasons why I hate....”
College campuses need to follow suit with campaigns like the U.S. Department of Health and Services’ “Stop Bullying Now!” and the Anti-Bullying Network’s fight against cyber-bullying, and become places that are thought of as the last place where anonymous and juvenile online harassment should be promoted. 
We believe that as an institute dedicated to the advancement of technology, Carnegie Mellon and its students have an obligation to be good stewards of such technology and refrain from abusing it through the perpetuation of online bullying on our campus. As leaders in the computer science arena, Carnegie Mellon’s good stewardship of technology may very well influence others and help end cyber-bullying.

While covering the celebrations taking place in Tahrir Square after former Egyptian Presdient Hosni Mubarak resigned on Feb. 11, CBS News correspondent Lara Logan was torn away from her crew by a crowd of approximately 200 Egyptian men. The men surrounded her, beat her, and sexually assaulted her until a group of Egyptian women and approximately 20 Egyptian soldiers saved her. She was reunited with her crew and flown out of the country within hours to return to the United States, where she has been recovering.
The details of Logan’s experience are horrifying, and I hope she recovers quickly. Making matters worse, though, is the hurtful discourse surrounding her attack in the media, where many commentators are blaming Logan for her assault and using the event as an excuse to justify their Islamophobia. In an LA Weekly article about Logan’s attack, author Simone Wilson starts off by noting Logan’s “shocking good looks and ballsy knack for pushing her way to the heart of the action” before even describing the assault. 
She repeatedly brings up Logan’s looks throughout the article, calling her a “gutsy stunner” and talking about her “Hollywood good looks,” and she even spends a paragraph gossiping about Logan’s previous relationships. By focusing on Logan’s looks and alleged promiscuity, the author seems to hint that Logan somehow “had it coming” by being a hot blonde, especially with Wilson’s comment at the end of the article that “nobody’s invincible.”
Furthermore, by focusing on Logan’s looks so much, Wilson revealed her ignorance about sexual assault. Looks have nothing to do with sexual assault. Rather, assault is usually more about asserting dominance and control than a way of expressing attraction.
Wilson was not the only one blunt and cruel in her commentary. Jim Hoft wrote on the conservative blog The Gateway Pundit, “Why did this attractive blonde female reporter wander into Tahrir Square last Friday? Why would she think this was a good idea? Did she not see the violence in the square the last three weeks...? What was she thinking?” Hoft seems to think that, as an attractive woman, Logan should have known better than to go anywhere dangerous, and therefore that the event is her fault. This is nothing more than a disgusting example of blaming the victim. Logan, as a journalist, had a responsibility to do her job and report in Tahrir Square. Moreover, she did not “wander” into Tahrir Square, as Hoft claims; she was there with her crew and security, until a crowd of 200 men dragged her away. Regardless of these details, no woman should be blamed for being sexually assaulted.
By saying that Logan should have known better than to go into a potentially dangerous situation, Hoft is excusing the action of the men, shrugging off their attack as though it were somehow inevitable. Women should not be responsible for avoiding all situations where they may be assaulted; perpetrators of assault should be held accountable for their actions, and the culture that tolerates such actions should be confronted head-on. Some pundits, instead of blaming Logan for her attack, have taken another approach: They have used the incident to further their claim that all Muslims are evil, base people. Debbie Schlussel, a conservative political commentator, not only insults and mocks Logan on her website, debbieschlussel.com, but also wrote, “This never happened to her or any other mainstream media reporter when Mubarak was allowed to treat his country of savages in the only way they can be controlled. Now that’s all gone. How fitting that Lara Logan was ‘liberated’ by Muslims in Liberation Square while she was gushing over the other part of the ‘liberation.’ ” 
She later updated her article, after getting multiple comments criticizing her posts, to say, ‘Riiiight — It’s not Muslims who don’t respect women and treat them as baby factories, sex toys, and property. It’s America and the West. You keep tellin’ yourself that, morons.’ " Schlussel’s sarcastic reply seems to entirely dismiss the 89,000 rapes reported in 2009 in the United States — and keep in mind that, according to the 1999 United States National Crime Victimization Survey, only 39 percent of victims report incidents of rape and sexual assault. 
To paint all Muslims with the broad brushstroke of “rapist savages” is entirely hypocritical and unreasonable — by Schlussel’s logic, all Americans should also be considered savages. Moreover, Schlussel’s claims that Mubarak was “controlling” his “country of savages” comes across as borderline delusional, especially when one considers that almost all of the violence that occurred during the Egyptian protests was at the hands of Mubarak’s plainclothes police officers who were attacking protesters and arresting journalists.
Logan has experienced something horrific, and my thoughts are with her and her family as she recovers from her attack. I sincerely hope that she will not read all of the hurtful and accusatory things that people have been writing about her and will realize that many people stand by her and support her as she recovers. Furthermore, I hope that people will realize that her attack is not indicative of the majority of Muslim people, just as the sexual violence that occurs in the United States is not indicative of all Americans.

Oh, how the mighty have fallen.
The once-great Ken Jennings, lord of all trivia, master of the Jeopardy! board, has been vanquished. 
But has he fallen to a worthy challenger, a sage steeped in esoteric word clues and less-than-clever puns? No, my friends. Our hero was beaten by a heartless, unfeeling, inhuman monster. 
This Grendel — bastard child of IBM, Carnegie Mellon, and other universities — showed no mercy to its flesh-and-blood opponents. In its dark Westchester County lair, the beast peered through the annals of thousands of years of human history. Faster than its hapless opponents could comprehend, the demon — called Watson by those brave enough to speak its name — deciphered clue after clue. But do not give up hope, friend reader. Watson, intimidating as he may seem, is not the first of his foul breed. He is no harbinger of the AI apocalypse.
The truth is that Watson is not inherently different from previous supercomputers. Last week’s Jeopardy! extravaganza was a media stunt — though a highly successful one. Watson’s victory brings us no closer to Skynet, to the Matrix, to the    TechnoCore than we already were. His algorithms are more advanced and his hardware is more refined, but Watson does essentially the same kind of aggregate data analysis and language parsing that search engines and advertisers have done for years — not that Google isn’t scary enough.
IBM has said that Watson’s children will help in hospitals, for example, giving doctors advice in natural languages based on an unfolding situation. This is a great result for physicians, computer scientists, and IBM’s shareholders, but the Jeopardy! show really had little to do with these long-term goals. Watson’s victory was psychological. It is our generation’s Deep Blue, but with a television audience of millions. People expect Google to give them instant results with exactly what they’re looking for. They don’t even think about it.
But a game show? And not just any game show, but Jeopardy!?
Then they do think.
Some people might have seen the end of the Jeopardy! challenge as Watson’s victory. But that was a stunt. I have my own definition of a victory for Watson, and it’s more than knowing that Toronto isn’t a U.S. city. Victory for Watson means a renewed interest among the general public in computer science and artificial intelligence. It means that a student decides that he or she wanted to learn more about Watson and ultimately chooses to follow computer science as a career. It means that government funding for basic and applied research does not get axed while entitlements and defense spending grow.
In his State of the Union address, President Obama said that today is our generation’s Sputnik moment. Watson’s Jeopardy! appearance is no Apollo program. It will not inspire a generation. 
But it might inspire a few people. And maybe that’s enough.
Michael Kahn (mkahn@) is editor-in-chief for The Tartan. He thinks Watson should have been voiced by Anthony Daniels (the voice of C–3PO).

The famous fast food chain Chick-fil-A recently donated food to an anti-gay marriage group. The corporate owner, Truett Cathy, was apparently aiming to preserve the restaurant’s “Christian DNA.” Last time I checked, restaurants were not subdivisions of religious entities. Not only is this a horrendously poor business model by ostracizing a significant percentage of Americans, it is also incredibly offensive.
Chick-fil-A’s decision to promote Christian values has created a lot of controversy with human rights activists, who are unsurprisingly fighting back. According to a CNN news blog, the Human Rights Campaign, a major gay-rights group, began a letter-writing campaign, and Indiana University South Bend temporarily closed down a Chick-fil-A service in its campus dining facilities.
The public’s reaction resulted in Cathy making a written statement of apology. “In recent weeks, we have been accused of being anti-gay,” Cathy said last Saturday. “We have no agenda against anyone.... While my family and I believe in the Biblical definition of marriage, we love and respect anyone who disagrees.” Cathy also posted a video on the chain’s Facebook page in an attempt to mitigate the spur of resentment the donation caused. Neither apology changed the public’s general sentiment.
Even beyond donating to an anti-gay organization, Chick-fil-A’s incorporation of its “Christian DNA” business model hinders success to a significant degree. Not only does its corporate purpose aim “to glorify God by being a faithful steward of all that is entrusted to us,” but all of its locations are closed on Sundays. Sunday is a vital day for generating business and making profit. If the restaurant wishes to grow and expand, as a normal business would, it is ridiculous to cut off such a large group of potential clientele. By de-secularizing, the business can only cater to a small portion of Americans, an utterly backward economical plan. 
According to Lake Lambert, author of the book Spirituality Inc., “If you have a faith-based corporate identity and you want to function in the national marketplace, you’re going to continue to encounter resistance to those values because not everybody is going to share them....The only other option is some sort of secular identity, and that’s not where Chick-fil-A is going.” Owners can’t possibly expect to increase their revenue with such a strategy; catering to the few will not result in success.
It is understandable to want to inspire good values throughout a corporation, especially in a family-based restaurant. However, mixing personal beliefs with business etiquette is never a good idea. Building a successful business requires owners to take a neutral stance on controversial topics; otherwise severe backlash from the public will be the norm and will eventually result in an economic downfall. It would be wisest for Chick-fil-A to separate its beliefs from its business.

Yes, the weather here has issues. I'm not sure if Pittsburgh exemplifies global warming or if it is just Mother Nature's testing ground for experiments doomed to fail. Either way, try not to let it ruin your week.
Go ahead — look to your fortune cookie instead of your horoscope for advice. But remember you have to add “in bed” to fortune cookies, and that is not always a good thing.
If the wind is blowing southward, then your day will be great. If it blows to the west, it will be okay. If the wind blows to the east, however, just make sure to watch out for flying nannies.
The answer that you seek is in the paper in your right pocket. It may not make sense at first, but study it, and soon you will understand.
Expand your circle of friends outside your major or department. Pick up a transitional phrase for the outside major of your interest, and you’ll be conversing in no time.
You have a severe case of spring fever. The only thing you can do to suppress it is to spread it to others. That way, when you see them all unfocused, you will be struck with the realization that you have work to do.
Find someone who appreciates your favorite childhood TV show — specifically a show that wasn’t popular but is still near and dear to your heart. Trust me, there are still people out there who watch Clarissa Explains it All on YouTube.
Considering that you probably have a midterm exam coming up soon, I would suggest that you finally open the book now.
You were so happy last Friday because it was so nice outside. It is up to you to make sure that the weather stays that way by making the Pittsburgh weather fairies happy. You must keep at least four CS kids outside.
Tough choices have to be made this week, but if you trust what you know and are a bit bold, things have to be okay. I hope.
Wave and smile at people you don’t know on campus this week and watch what happens to your day. Do the same thing on Pitt’s campus and really see how your day turns out.
I said it before, but I thought it was best to give you a refreshing update: 11 days until spring break.
