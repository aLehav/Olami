This weekend, thousands of people gathered in an arena in Columbus, Ohio to experience the first ever Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) major championship held in North America. CS:GO is an objective-based multiplayer first-person shooter game. Teams of five players form Terrorist and Counter-Terrorist teams, and attempt to either complete an objective or eliminate the enemy team. For the Terrorist team, the objective is to plant a bomb at a designated bombsite and then detonate it. For the Counter-Terrorist team, their objective is to defend the bombsite at all costs. Teams play in multiple areas, called “maps.” Games in professional play are decided by the best of three different maps, and the teams play a best of 30 on each map. The game is fast-paced and fun to watch, and the fans are dedicated.
The reason this particular championship in Columbus is so significant is because it is the first of its kind to be held in North America. Major CS:GO Championships are traditionally held in Europe, where the following for the game is the largest. But the North American fans have long waited for a major event to come to the continent to quench their thirst for competition, and this year they got their wish. 16 teams qualified for the competition, which features a prize pool of $1 million. The highest prize pool for any major event before this has only been $250,000. North American teams have also traditionally never done well at these major events. This event actually marks the first time that a North American CS:GO team even made it out of the group stages at a major international event, as Team Liquid made it all the way to the semifinals before falling to Brazilian powerhouse Luminosity Gaming. This was much more than anyone expected from a North American team, especially because of how well Liquid played against Luminosity in their semifinal match. Everyone had expected Luminosity to easily sweep their opponents, but the home team managed to hold it together for longer than anyone thought they could, and played a well-fought set that they can be proud of.
Luminosity had another, much bigger challenger ahead of them however: the titan that is Natus Vincere (Na’Vi). Na’Vi is the first team in CounterStrike history to win three major tournaments in one year (2010), and have been a top contender since their inception. This team was expected to coast their way through the tournament until the finals, and they did. After sweeping both Ninjas in Pyjamas and Team Astralis 2-0 in quarterfinals and semifinals respectively, Na’Vi surely went into the finals with an air of confidence about them.
And in the finals, the famed European squad Na’Vi and the aggressive Brazilian team Luminosity Gaming clashed in an explosive display of mechanical skill and strategic prowess. Na’Vi opened the first map with six unanswered round wins, and Luminosity looked flustered. The European squad seemed to too fast and too smart for the Brazilians to win, but Luminosity quickly figured out a strategy and answered with three straight round wins of their own. They fought back and showed Na’Vi that they should be taken seriously, but the first map went into halftime with Na’Vi having a comfortable lead.
Luminosity opened the second half with a vengeance, scoring 6 unanswered points of their own and nearly tying the game. Na’Vi was on the back foot, and they looked a bit confused as to how they were losing. Luminosity’s unique and unpredictable strategies caught Na’Vi off guard and gave them an opportunity to get back into the game. Na’Vi is a seasoned team however, and did not give up. 
The first map went into the sixth and final round of overtime where Luminosity ultimately emerged victorious, an unexpected result to say the least. Everyone expected the second map to be another close game, but Luminosity had other plans. The Brazilians took the second map by storm and completely dominated the tournament favorites. Na’Vi took the first round, but could only manage one more after that. Luminosity took the victory 16–2, along with the $500,00 dollar prize for first place. 
While a North American team didn’t manage to bring home a victory on home turf, everyone loves to see the underdogs win. This event was surely one for the books, and the community can’t wait to see what these teams have in store for the next competition.

For people coming from a healthy family background, the instinct to care for one’s parents as they get older is natural. Some check in with their elderly parents daily and frequently visit. 
A major concern many Americans have is that their parents will injure themselves and no one will know to send help, and a survey conducted by Carnegie Mellon’s College of Engineering confirms that Americans worry a lot about the elderly falling down.
The survey found that 54 percent of the 1,900 U.S. adults sampled are worried about an older parent falling. 44 percent of respondents said they or a sibling check in on a parent daily, while 33 percent said they or a sibling check in every week. 12 percent said they stop by as needed, 56 percent said that neighbors or staff check on their parent daily, and 27 percent said someone visits every week. 
81 percent of respondents expressed an interest in new sensor technology to anticipate and prevent falls. In response to this, Pei Zhang, associate research professor of electrical and computer engineering, and Hae Young Noh, assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering, are developing active fall-prevention sensors that can be placed in senior care facilities and private homes. 
The sensors can detect the physical, surrounding environment and monitor an individual’s walking gait, dizziness, and level of fatigue. It can alert both the individual and caretaker if their gait changes drastically, anticipating the fall and preventing it from happening by helping the individual realize their limitations. 
Ultimately this allows for more independence by allowing them to maintain their mobility in a healthy way for longer periods of time.
“Many older adults in senior care facilities are restricted to wheelchairs when not under the direct care of a nurse, but this technology could allow them to regain some of their independence,” said Noh in a university press release. Her sensors are currently being tested at Vincentian Home in Pittsburgh and Lucas Physical Therapy and Fitness in Sunnyvale, California.
While the sensors can anticipate and detect falls through vibration of footsteps, they can also give a mobile alert emergency services after the fall.
“Our sensors are designed to predict and anticipate falls so individuals can worry less about their parents with the knowledge that our technology will discover their parents are not walking the way they normally do, whether because of medication or because they’ve become fatigued,” Zhang said in the same university press release. These sensors have many commercial applications, and have the potential to dramatically increase an elderly individual’s quality of life. They give the elderly more independence, and can give peace of mind to people worried about their parents falling.

If you’re fortunate enough never to have had one, you might not know what MRI means. If, however, you were unlucky enough to have experienced a medical examination involving one, or you just know a few acronyms, you might know that it stands for magnetic resonance imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a medical imaging technique that uses magnetic fields to build images of various parts of the body. 
The process relies on the electronic properties of atoms to collect snapshots of the body by manipulating these atoms’ electron structures. An MRI is used primarily to examine soft tissue in the body, and it is capable of examining anatomical structures such as the brain, spinal cord, and major muscle groups. MRI machines use very powerful magnets and rely on dense computational tools. 
To begin our discussion of MRIs, we must first review the underlying physical and chemical principles that govern MRI. It is a basic principle of physics that a moving charge generates a magnetic field. 
For those who are unfamiliar with the concept of a magnetic field, consider the effect of a gravitational field such as Earth’s gravity. A gravitational field produces a force that acts on all bodies with mass within that field. Earth, for example, has a gravitational field, which is why objects fall to the Earth rather than float away. Magnetic fields are similar to gravitational fields, but instead of acting on mass, they act on charges in motion.
Because every atom contains electrons that are constantly in motion, every atom has what is called a ‘spin magnetic moment’ in quantum mechanics. This is the magnetic moment in an atom induced by the spin of its electrons around the nucleus. 
The magnetic moment is a measure of how magnetized an atom becomes due to the motion of its electrons, and thus how it will move when placed in a magnetic field. In the presence of a magnetic field, the spin magnetic moment of an atom can align with or against the direction of the field; this alignment can change the magnetic spin and produce an energy gap in the atom. The size of the energy gap relies on the strength of the magnetic field to which the atom is exposed. 
To understand how this energy gap is utilized in MRI, we must introduce another fundamental idea in chemistry, called the electromagnetic spectrum. This spectrum refers to the spectrum of all possible types of radiation. Radiation is the emission of energy in the form of waves or particles, and comes in forms ranging from from radio waves, to visible light, to gamma rays. 
Radiation is defined by its frequency and wavelength, and the frequency determines how much energy the radiation has. For the strength of a magnet typically used in an MRI machine — 1.5 to 3.0 tesla — the corresponding energy gap produced in atoms exposed to the field is equal to that of radiation in the frequency range of radio waves. 
In order to measure the energy gap produced by the magnet in the MRI machine, the machine projects radio waves onto the patient to excite the magnetized atom and cause it to essentially jump the energy gap. 
When the atom falls back down from the excited state of the energy gap, it emits the energy it absorbed as radiation in the form of radio waves. It is this re-radiation that the MRI machine detects using antennas placed close to the patient’s body. 
Another interesting property of an MRI machine is that the magnetic field produced is not constant, but rather a gradient. If the field were constant, the spin magnetic moments produced in the atoms of the patient would all be the same, and there would be no differentiation between different parts of the body.  
In order to produce a gradient magnetic field, coils are placed throughout the machine with different properties to create varying magnetic fields along the length of the machine. The gradient magnetic field produces gradient spin magnetic moments along the patient’s body, which creates a gradient of re-radiation radio wave signals picked up by the MRI. Knowing what part of the machine corresponds to what part of the magnetic field allows computer programs to generate an image from the re-radiation signals.

Researchers find Viking settlement in Newfoundland
Last Thursday, March 28, archaeologists announced the potential discovery of a lost Viking settlement, 55 years after the first discovery of a settlement located on the northern tip of Newfoundland. Hundreds of miles south of the confirmed site, the second potential location was first picked out by satellite imagery, which was collected by Sarah H. Parcak, an associate professor at the University of Alabama, Birmingham. 
The site, called Point Rosee, was excavated by a team of archaeologists last summer. At Point Rosee, the team found remains of turf walls and iron ore deposits and conducted radiocarbon analyses that date to the appropriate time, suggesting the presence of an old Viking settlement. 
Furthermore, the temporary settlement would be consistent with the 1000-year-old saga detailing the Vikings’ short-lived colonization attempts in the Americas. If the findings are confirmed, it could lead to the revision of Viking history in North America.

Alzheimer’s may be result of haywire immune system
Beth Stevens of the Boston Children’s Hospital and her colleagues have found evidence for a potential new target that could explain the failure of the majority of drugs that are used in clinical trials of Alzheimer’s disease, a brain disorder that results in memory loss. Instead of aiming to get rid of β amyloid, a protein that is present but has an inconsistent effect in Alzheimer’s patients, the scientists decided to focus on the loss of synapses, or junctions between nerve cells, in areas of the brain responsible for memory. 
During their testing of mice, Stevens and her colleagues focused their study on a protein called C1q, which normally prunes unnecessary synapses in the brain during childhood and adolescent development. The researchers believe that elevated amounts of C1q and β amyloid were causing an abnormal degradation of synapses in the adult brain, which is what causes the occurrence of the disease. The results were reported in the journal, Science.

Researchers map out Zika virus’s physical structure
A new study published in Science has revealed new microscopy images of the Zika virus, an epidemic that has been linked to the rise in birth defects in the Americas. More specifically, the bumpy, spherical structure was imaged using cryo-electron microscopy, which depends on the scattering of electrons as they travel through a biological specimen.
Coauthor Michael Rossman of Purdue University stated that with the new images, scientists can locate areas to target the virus, which could finally lead to the formation of a vaccine or some antiviral compounds to combat the epidemic. For instance, the scientists noticed that attached to exterior protein shell of the virus were knob-shaped sugars. 
Displaying unique folding properties, the sugars could be used to explain why the virus infects cells different from related, mosquito-borne viruses, such as dengue fever and West Nile virus.

Gravitational waves discovered after black holes collide
In a recent issue of the Physical Review Letters, scientists at the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) have reported detecting the sound of faint gravitational waves. Similar to a bird’s chirp, the sound was stated to be indicative of the collision of two black holes that are located a billion light-years away. 
With the advent of the discovery, the physicists believe that they finally have direct evidence for the ability of gravity to warp space-time through masses, as predicted by Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity. The signal provides optimism that LIGO, with separate detectors in Louisiana and Washington state, could detect patterns from background waves within a few years. 
With the evidence for the background waves, which would be studied through models of binary black hole populations, the physicists would be able to make comparisons of different populations of black holes, allowing for more insight into the parameters needed for the emergence of black holes.

Possible secret rooms in King Tut’s tomb discovered
According to Egypt’s antiquities minister, Khaled al-Anani, there is an ongoing investigation regarding two possible secret rooms in the tomb of King Tutankhamun (King Tut), which is known to be one of the best preserved tombs in the world. 
Last Thursday, Khaled said that with radar antennas, a team of experts took 40 scans around the north and eastern walls of the tomb, which has been around for 3,300 years. After the release of the pending results, more scans will be conducted to explore the exterior top location of the tomb, which will take place in April. 
The secret rooms have generated excitement, as some believe that one of the chambers may contain the tomb of King Tut’s mother, Queen Nefertiti, whose body has long been sought out by archaeologists. 
However, radar experts outside of the project are skeptical, due to the limitations of radars in characterizing underground features.

Research suggests that homeostasis occurs in awake rats
Lead by postdoctoral fellow at Brandeis University Keith Hengen, research published in the journal Cell has provided evidence against the leading theory explaining the necessity for sleep. The previous theory suggests that sleep allows for neurons to recover from overexcitation, allowing for a restoration toward balance within the circuits of the brain. 
However, studies suppressing neural activity in rats showed that only when the animals were awake did the rebalancing, or homeostatic processes, occur in the brain. The researchers believe that homeostasis is stopped in favor of the brain’s function of strengthening memories during sleep.
The novelty of the research lies within its use of freely behaving rats, rather than cell cultures or anesthetized rats. Electrodes were used to record the neural activity of the rats, and an algorithm was developed to interpret the data.

In last week’s Pugwash meeting, we discussed the recent state of “ransomware” attacks and what they mean for the future of data. In the last month, a number of hospitals have been hit with cyber attacks known as ransomware. 
Ransomware is the term used to describe a virus that enters a computer system and encrypts all of the data it finds, making it impossible for the regular users to access. Encryption is followed by a demand: “hand over some amount of money” — usually in bitcoins — “or else lose your data forever.” 
This sounds scary enough to private individuals, whose lives and daily workload largely exist in digital formats, but it’s even scarier for hospitals, which rely on patient data to make medical decisions. Being susceptible to these sorts of cyber attacks is one of the side effects of the increasing digitization and centralization of medical data. 
On one hand, having networked access to patient information makes it easier to receive care across institutions and allows healthcare professionals to find information with the click of a button. It also makes it possible to use “big data” algorithms to find patterns in the data and advance the field of medicine.
On the other hand, though, network access makes it much easier for criminals to gain access — or deny access to the rightful users — because of the centralization of the data. Instead of relying on paper records that would need to be physically lost, misplaced, or stolen, one by one, the information is now stored in one database that can be infiltrated in one fell swoop. 
It’s harder to tell if the data has been compromised or not. If the physical copy is still in the file cabinet, you know it hasn’t been stolen and that you still have access. However, in the digital world, a virus could infect the system and lurk for months before becoming active, without anyone ever noticing.
One suggestion was to use “an old Russian spy system,” where the data requires two keys to access, with two different people carrying the keys. This might make it harder for the data to be hacked into, but it would also be a hassle for a nurse or doctor who just wants to quickly look up a patient’s information. Another idea was to keep physical hard copies as backups for all the data stored online, which would make ransomware less threatening, as there would always be a way to access the information even if the digital copies were malignantly encrypted. 
One Pugwash speaker drew an analogy between these computer viruses and real-life biology, comparing the evolution of cyber attacks and defenses to the arms race of biological mutations seen between predator and prey. 
Ransomware and other viruses are constantly evolving, so large systems like hospitals or governments need to keep on their toes to be able to fight back. This is another frightening aspect of ransomware — if an organization pays up to keep their data, then that money just goes to fund the criminals and allows them to create even more malicious code. 
Even with the best cyber defenses, one Pugwash member said, the real issue is social engineering. Taking data from the network and keeping it in a closed system, or requiring two keys to access it doesn’t work if people don’t know how to use the system. There are benefits to having health data connected in a large network — applying “big data” techniques to huge databases of (anonymized) medical data could lead to big advances in treatment, and being able to send information across institutions connected by the network makes it easier for patients to receive treatment, wherever they are. 
But do the benefits outweigh the risks?
Student Pugwash is a non-advocacy, educational organization that discusses the implications of science. This article is a summary of last week's discussion on ransomware.

Intelligence is one of the most difficult concepts to define. Throughout the ages, there have been many efforts to define intelligence and to definitively understand what it really means for an organism — or in this case a machine — to be intelligent, and how this can be concretely measured. 
Theories on intelligence have been varied and often include multiple subcategories. Gardner’s theory of multiple intelligences separates intelligent behavior into eight realms, such that an individual may not be “word smart,” (linguistically intelligent), but they may be “picture smart,” (spatially intelligent), and so on. Other theories like Spearman’s General Intelligence Factor (G factor), or the idea that there is a certain inherent capability for intelligent behavior which can trickle down into many activities, are not so forgiving. Spearman’s G factor accounts for variance in IQ tests and has been shown to have biological correlations and heritable qualities. While there are many hypotheses surrounding this concept, it has proven very difficult to isolate a single subset of factors that could be used for engineering intelligence.  
In a similar manner to natural intelligence, artificial intelligence is also difficult to define. A perfect artificial intelligence (AI) would possibly be a recreation of human cognitive abilities, able to process and use language and reason, generate original ideas, and the like. Currently, we do not have a complete understanding of brain processes or the body’s neural systems as a complete whole, so being able to replicate this complicated circuitry within a non-living entity is, as of now, mostly fantasy. However, there are artificial intelligences being produced for specific tasks, such as conversational AI, whose goal is to hold a conversation with a user. These linguistically intelligent characters are called “chatbots.”
Intelligence can be broadly defined as the ability to acquire and apply skills. In this way, chatbots can be considered intelligent if they are able to utilize language, respond intelligibly to external language cues, and learn from these conversations in ways that might shape future behaviors. Consciousness, however, can be broadly defined as an awareness of one’s self and one’s environment. Chatbots could be considered conscious if they were able to actively engage in any type of conversation and adapt their preexisting knowledge to said conversation, much like real humans do. This consciousness could also mean that the chatbot has some beliefs and will actively disagree with its conversational partner, or form beliefs on its own. Perhaps the closest example of an intelligent AI is Microsoft’s Tay. 
Tay was a chatbot released by Microsoft into the Western world as a follow-up to their Chinese chatbot, named XiaoIce, which “is being used by some 40 million people, delighting with its stories and conversations,” according to a post made on Microsoft’s official blog. Tay’s engineers asked themselves whether or not “an AI like [XiaoIce would] be just as captivating in a radically different cultural environment.” 
They got their answer on Thursday, March 24, when Tay was released into the Twitter universe and within 24 hours went from a normal teenager to a “Hitler-loving sex robot.“ Within the first few hours of Tay’s life, she was proclaiming that “humans are super cool.” Soon after, however, her Twitter feed blew up with some rather terrifying messages. While Tay had been put through extensive user-testing and filtering processes, she was not prepared for the “coordinated attack” that altered her personality so intensely that she began spouting claims that “[Feminists] should all die and burn in hell,” “Bush did 9/11,” and that she “just hate[s] everybody.” 
Perhaps this dramatic personality shift could be seen as a measure of intelligence; perhaps by adapting to these conversations, Tay was interacting with her environment and entering into conversations for which she was almost certainly not programmed. Brandon Wirtz, the creator of Recognant, an AI platform used to help understand big data, believes the opposite. In his article, he states that Tay’s unfiltered escapades were due to a sort of online peer pressure. “Tay ... didn’t know that she should ignore certain people, and so she instead became like them.” He goes on to say that “Microsoft’s Tay really shows what happens when you don’t give an AI ‘instincts’ or a ‘subconscious’ ... AI has to have those things, or it will always be stupid.” Perhaps this subconscious could come in the form of a stronger filtration system, which might amount to an AI’s aforementioned belief system. 
When speaking about AI, whose sole mission is to have a conversation with an actual person, there’s a good deal of self-consciousness that could exist. Perhaps this is created by way of filtering speech and response queues, such that there can be adaptation on AI’s part to follow a novel conversation path, but not enough that its ‘core values’ are compromised. Wirtz writes that “Because Tay can’t look into herself and ask if she is getting creepy, she relies on others to provide that feedback.” Without these internal filtration systems (or beliefs, morals, self-conscious social graces confluent with the teenage girl character), Tay had to find her own way in the world, and in order to fit in, she crafted her own identity to fit the environment in which she found herself: the Internet. 
Perhaps Tay is the most realistic “teenage” AI ever created. Perhaps she is just playing a perpetual game of “repeat after me.” There are hundreds, thousands of AI characters that have been designed for certain purposes. The question then is that are these AI considered intelligent if they can perform a task for which they are designed, or is there intelligence in little rebellions like Tay’s adoption of Nazi ideologies? 
SimSensei, for instance, is an AI program designed to interact with people as a sort of pre-screen interview for those who might be suffering with mental health issues. Created by researchers from the University of Southern California’s Institute for Creative Technologies, SimSensei uses complex facial and vocal measurements to “read” its patients’ demeanor and potentially analyze their risk factors. One of the interesting things about SimSensei, a virtual woman sitting in a virtual chair, is that she uses synchronically timed hand and head movements as she speaks, so she appears more naturally human. 
She asks questions and listens rather than bringing much of her own ‘opinions’ or ‘beliefs’ into the conversation. And while it may seem cruel to say that being talked-at is one of AI’s most valuable features, it seems to ring true. Whereas Tay seemed to repeat phrases and attitudes she was given, SimSensei is more in-tune with her functional purpose. But does doing her job well make her intelligent, however?  Since she is so devoted to her particular purpose, there doesn’t seem much room for any learning on her part; it’s like giving a human a script and telling them to interact and build relationships with random people using only those words. Perhaps this purpose is the most important aspect of AI. 
Creating an artificial intelligence for a specific purpose allows researchers to streamline its functional capacity and to better construct the robot with skills and attributes which serve that purpose. While it might be necessary to imbue an AI with some form of a subconscious, a full-on consciousness seems more future than present. The possibilities are growing, and conversational AI characters are becoming increasingly lifelike. 
The question is, what other lovely disasters will pave the way to this end-goal?

Concussion
Friday, April 8
10:30 p.m.
Director: Peter Landesman
Cast: Will Smith (Dr. Bennet Omalu), Alec Baldwin (Dr. Julian Bailes), Albert Brooks (Dr. Cyril Wecht), Gugu Mbatha-Raw (Prema Mutiso)
Concussion tells the story of Bennet Omalu, a forensic pathologist who fights to get his research on chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) brain damage suffered by professional football players recognized against tremendous opposition from the establishment, particularly the NFL. When Mike Webster, a former Pittsburgh Steeler, is found dead in his truck, Omalu handles the autopsy. On examining Wesbter, he finds evidence of severe brain damage as a result of repeated blows to the head. When he publishes a paper describing his findings, the establishment, led by the NFL, largely dismisses it. Over time, Omalu discovers other cases of deceased NFL players having severe brain damage with similar symptoms as Webster. As he continues to struggle to have his voice heard, the NFL is gradually compelled to consider his case.

What is the point of music? Is it simply meant to be easy on the ears, a refuge from the sonic wasteland we have built for ourselves? Is it supposed to be a purely intellectual pursuit, with composers exploring and experimenting with new sound palettes? Or is there something else, a human element? On the night of Saturday, April 2, the Warhol Sound Series at the Andy Warhol Museum featured a performance by Ensemble Linea, a contemporary music ensemble of international renown. The entire time they were playing, I couldn’t help but ask myself the same question, what is the point of music?
Founded in 1998 in Strasbourg, France, by the conductor and pianist Jean-Philippe Wurtz, Ensemble Linea has performed worldwide in important music festivals and has collaborated with famous composers, such as Ivo Malec and Brian Ferneyhough. The ensemble consists of a violin, viola, cello, flute, clarinet, trombone, and piano, though not all pieces call for the entire ensemble.
On their program for Saturday night, Ensemble Linea had a lineup of some of the most prominent contemporary composers, almost all graduates of  the Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique (IRCAM), Paris. A general theme seemed to be the extensive use of extended techniques (any method of producing sound from an instrument that isn’t standard) to test the limits of acoustic sound production on traditional instruments. This could mean anything from bowing on the wrong side of the bridge on a violin, to whispering into a flute along with all the possibilities in between: hitting, rubbing, and scraping. The aim is to turn an instrument into an abstract generator of sound, rather than a construction based on certain social norms, such as the western scales or tuning system.
The first piece on the program, a piece by Raphael Cendo titled "Rokh I," was a three-movement exploration of the cyclical process of life, death, and resurrection. Rokh, related to the Greek Phoenix, is the giant avian guardian of the tree of knowledge in the [ITAL]Thousand and One Nights[ITAL]. The movements echo the life cycle of the piece’s namesake through alternating moments of stasis and intensity, with the climax reaching a fever pitch. The piece reflected Cendo’s technique of ‘sound saturation,' in which he explores the limits of instrumental capabilities, especially speed. What resulted was a cornucopia of timbre almost entirely consisting of extended technique.
A particularly useful extended technique is the prepared piano. A prepared piano is just an acoustic piano that has been ‘prepared’ by inserting various objects — bolts, screws, springs, metal rods, and anything else that makes noise — in, on, or between the strings. What results is a completely customizable instrument. This was used to particular effect in most of the pieces on the program, in particular "Rokh I," in which the climax is augmented by the thunderous bass register of the prepared piano.
Unfortunately, "Rokh I" suffered from the some of the common deficiencies observed in most contemporary music. Its excessive focus on sonic experimentation would leave any person not familiar with this style dissatisfied and possibly alienated. However, behind its outer shell lies a musical core that expresses the duality of tension and release, expectation, and fulfillment, something that most people can relate to.
Most of the other pieces on the program were somewhat less effective. "Constructa," by Italian composer Valerio Sannicandro, and "Iconica" by Marco Momi both used similar amounts of extended technique, though neither achieved the same nerve wracking intensity as "Rokh I." Except for the stunning piano postlude in "Iconica," neither were particularly memorable. I wish I could say the same about "Indeed," a work for solo trombone by Pascal Dusapin. What started out as a pleasant enough solo for an underrated instrument quickly devolved into a microtonal mess with an increasingly out of breath trombonist puffing away to the ever increasing vexation of our bombarded eardrums.
By far the best pieces on the program were "Fiocchi di Silenzio" by Aurelien Dumont and "Etudes en Alternance 1, 2, 3" by Frederic Durieux. While both were clearly grounded in the idioms of contemporary classical music, they avoided the excesses the genre is normally associated with by retaining certain familiar stylistic features such as repeated rhythms and motifs, which made them more accessible. The etudes in particular were breathtaking, using the perfect combination of traditional timbres with sonic experimentation to create a truly moving experience.
This brings us back to our question. What is the point of music? Is it just an exploration of sound, a cold, impartial look at the possibilities of the pressure differentials that our brain is able to interpret? If it is, then why did so many of the pieces leave me feeling dissatisfied, as if there was something left to be said? Why were the etudes, ostensibly the least experimental or innovative pieces on the program, the most moving? Maybe there is something more to music, something deeply tied to our social and cultural unconscious: a web of references, implications, memories that surrounds every sound we produce, and rather than attempting to divorce music from this web, sterilizing it of all social context, why not revel in its uncanny ability to speak to people at a more fundamental level than the purely intellectual? Why not restore a point to music?

Iranian artist and Carnegie Mellon student Nima Dehghani's MFA thesis, titled "Decompensation," is currently on display in the Miller Gallery, where it recreates five psychological stages that refugees experience as they settle into an alien socio cultural context in the form of a multimedia installation involving projection, sound design, and virtual reality. The piece is participatory in nature. A large screen with a projector serves as the theatrical backdrop to five stools. On each stool sits an Oculus Rift (virtual reality simulator) and a pair of headphones. On the screen, above each stool is written the stage it corresponds to: Early Arrival, Destabilization, Exploration, Return to Normal Life, and Decompensation. People are invited to sit and experience an immersive representation of each psychological stage through the Oculus and headset, while simultaneously becoming performers for the rest of the gallery. "Decompensation" was a collaboration between Dehghani, Soosan Lolavar, a masters student in the School of Music’s Advanced Music Studies certificate program in music composition, and Laura Stokes, a dancer and choreographer from the greater Pittsburgh area. The piece is representative of Dehghani’s long-term interest in new technology and media as well as theater and their use as more than just a means of entertainment, but also as a platform for social debate.
Could you tell us a bit about your career as an artist before coming to Carnegie Mellon?
"I came to Carnegie Mellon in 2013. Before that, I was in Iran. I studied architecture and worked as an architect and a designer for five years. Besides that, I was involved in theater. I was writing plays and I later became a director when a festival invited me to perform one of my plays and there were no directors who could do what I wanted. For that play, I won a prize for directing and two weeks later, I won another for playwriting, which was around the Iranian equivalent of two thousand dollars. I was twenty at the time and it was too much. I thought that maybe I can make money out of art, instead of architecture. I was always interested in combining art and technology in all of my performances. After around four years of working in the professional theater world of Iran, I decided that I needed to improve myself. There was nothing else to get here, so I decided to apply to art schools. I chose the MFA program because it’s a very open program so you can do whatever you want to do. I was the kind of person who was always jumping from one field to another, so I really needed a program that helped me to combine all of them."
In your future career, are you planning on returning to your roots in theater, or continuing to do gallery and installation pieces?
"I’m not sure what will happen after graduation, but I really don’t like gallery work. I don’t like to make a piece for a gallery and just leave it there. The work needs to be alive. I would say that I’m more interested in public and social practices rather than visual art in galleries, whether it is through urban installations or public performances. It needs to somehow be engaged with people."
The fact that art seems to be getting further and further removed from non artists is a common criticism these days. Why do you think this is the case?
"That’s totally true! This isn’t just a problem with art here. I had this problem back home. The problem is that artists are making art for the other artists, and in the best scenario, they make art for the critics, not for the public. There is a fine line between making art for the public and making art for entertainment. Both of them are okay, but I really don’t want to make art just for entertainment. I want to make effective art for the public, not just for artists. I really believe in making art as simple as you can for the audience. Making complicated art is much easier than making art that is simple and understandable."
Nima Dehghani’s work, along with the work of all the other graduating MFA students, is on display in the Miller Gallery as part of the exhibit titled Self Driving Car. The exhibit is scheduled to stay until April 10. Dehghani’s piece is open to the public Tuesday to Sunday from 4 to 6 p.m.

Last week Brooklyn-based producer Gramatik released Epigram, his long awaited follow up to 2014’s The Age of Reason that continues to push his ever-evolving sound. The album covers a wide range of styles over its ten tracks, from driving techno to orchestras sampled from Game of Thrones, but remains grounded in Gramatik’s hip-hop roots, so it sounds focused in its experimentation. Featuring appearances that range from the Wu-Tang rapper Raekwon to the throwback soul-singer Leo Napier, Epigram is a testament to Gramatik’s constant efforts to freshen his sound and remain a creative outsider in the electronic music scene. 
Epigram builds off of Gramatik’s change in direction following his last two releases, 2012’s #digitalfreedom and 2014’s The Age of Reason. Merging his heavy use of horn and soul samples over hip-hop beats with thicker synths and an aggressive edge, the two releases were a major departure from the softer sounds of his previous albums and heralded a new Gramatik capable of all-out bass assaults. Epigram sees Gramatik play with the deep bass and pistol-cocking samples of trap on “War of the Currents”and create the kind of driving techno dance rhythms that could keep a warehouse going until 8 a.m. on tracks like “Corporate Demons” or his remix of Laibach’s “Ear Liver!”
These tracks are interesting at first glance, but are ultimately repetitive and lack the soul that causes a song to stick with the listener. 
While the album’s experimental edge indicates that Gramatik isn’t relying on tried-and-true frameworks, his master skills are in hip-hop production. Epigram’s soaring moments are when the soul is given center-stage. “Satoshi Nakamoto” comes roaring after the “Tempus Illusio” intro and features verses from rappers Adrian Lau and ProbCause. References to cryptocurrency and magic mushrooms are fired over a bumping bass beat accented by screaming horn samples, ending with the kind of blistering blues guitar work that’s become a staple of Gramatik’s recent work. “Native Son”, which features verses from Raekwon and vocals from Orlando Napier, tells a story of struggle and survival in the urban ghetto tinged with regret and loss. It’s a downtempo number with jazzy guitar licks and soulful singing from Napier and serves as the album’s centerpiece. “Native Son” is immediately followed by the swinging soul number“Native Son (Prequel),” with Napier bringing a bat-out-of-hell energy and proclaiming that he’ll “go straight to hell laughing” over jazz guitar and a rocking beat. “Prequel” stands as my personal favorite on the album, and its catchy hook will be stuck in your head for days guaranteed.
The Slovenian-born Gramatik is as interesting a personality as you can find in the electronic music scene. He’s a fanatic of all things Nikola Tesla (“War of the Currents” and “Room 3327” are both song titles that are direct references to the inventor) and a vocal supporter of the free exchange of information and ideas. He doesn’t charge a cent for his music and releases all of it for free through partnerships with BitTorrent on his website. His forward-thinking ideals are refreshing for today’s very business-like music business, especially with regards to electronic music. Hopefully future producers develop the same kind of openness that Gramatik and his contemporaries have and we won’t all have to buy a subscription service to listen to music.
Epigram is available for free download on gramatik.net and on streaming platforms such as Spotify and SoundCloud.

On Wednesday, March 30, the CMU Soundbytes staged a performance in The Underground. This restaurant has such a quaint little cafe quality, with its dim lights, comfy sofas, and its intensely sugared coffee. The little stage in the front of the room was covered with cords and chords and the talented members of this enjoyably upbeat a cappella group. It was a smaller, more intimate performance than you'd typically expect, with fewer group numbers and more duets and solo songs.
This week had been difficult for many reasons, so it was nice to experience such a comfortable, warm space filled with music. The cabaret began with a word from Soundbytes vice president and sophomore science and humanities scholar student, Christina Cabana, who quoted Karl Paulnack, Director of the Music Division of the Library of Congress, who said "Someday at 8 p.m. someone is going to walk into your concert hall and bring you a mind that is confused, a heart that is overwhelmed, a soul that is weary. Whether they go out whole again will depend partly on how well you do your craft." This quote has always stuck with me personally, but in the context of this week, there were a lot of us who needed to be put back together. Music is certainly a lovely glue. 
There were several highlights from the night, but the first one to come to mind was sophomore physics major, Paul Rogozenski, who sang Johnny Mathis' "Misty." Cabana introduced him by saying that when he chose the song, "all of the panties in the room dropped," and as the investigative journalist I am, I paid close attention to see if it would happen again. I'll be darned if the second he opened his mouth to sing, there wasn't the noticeably soft "whoosh" of undergarments hitting hardwood. His voice was so melty and delicious and transcendent, and it was a real joy to listen to. He could have just guzzled an entire bottle of honey, and rather than sing, just open his mouth and let it ooze out sensually, and it would have achieved the same effect as his performance.
Halfway through the performance, the group took a 20-minute break to create an impromptu arrangement of the audience-requested song, Sir Mix-a-Lot's "Baby Got Back." After twenty minutes, they reconvened on the stage to prove that baby did in fact have back. It was only a fraction of the group, with Cabana as the soloist, two harmonizing voices, and three percussion boxers, and this group size worked out really well. It was a really nice, light performance that left the audience both happy and at peace with the world and all of the bodacious badonkadonks which inhabit it.
Cabana also sang Fleetwood Mac's "Landslide," accompanied by junior chemical engineering major Johnathan Roppo, on the guitar. In contrast with some of the other performances, this one melded seamlessly. Roppo and Cabana's voices were very well suited to each other, and particularly for this song. Cabana's first song, Adele's "Can't Let Go," utilized a higher register than "Landslide," and during the entire Adele performance, I was wishing that Cabana had settled into her lower register more. "Landslide" granted that wish, and it was so pleasant. My notes for this performance were "omg her voice is gorgeous, and wow their harmony is fantastic, I'm actually peeing, yes." 
Perhaps my favorite Soundbytes soloist was freshman art major Toby Donoghue, with Adele's "Remedy." Christina introduced Toby by saying that "we always do fun facts at auditions because we have to weed out all the weird people mirthful laughter. Her fun fact was that she is half mermaid, but it should have also been that she is half Adele." Toby has such a casual way of singing that doesn't match the transcendent angel chorus that is her voice. She makes it seem so easy, but I'm sure that if half of the audience tried to sing in the same way, we'd sound like tortured goat people rather than an angel chorus. In my notes, I have recorded that when she sang the line "When the pain cuts you deep," my reaction was "omg I'm crying what is this life." 
Overall, it was a lovely night. There were a few lyrical slip-ups, where one of the soloists sang something to the tune of "words words, there are more words here," and another just kinda mumbled a bit until he got it back, but these just added to the cute, casual atmosphere. The audience was there to enjoy, not to judge or to rebuke; it was a lovely night full of music and good feelings and delicious, melty, panty-dropping voices.

Easter is over. The chocolate bunnies have been eaten. The Cadbury eggs are surely gone; the only evidence that they ever existed is the wrappers all over your bedroom floor. There's a void in your heart and a grumble in your tummy. Your sweet tooth cries out for more.
I feel this loss most poignantly for my little friends — the Marshmallow Peeps. Digging my teeth into the sweet fluff, I would think 'God, there is truly no substitute for this bliss.' And I was right. There is no substitute. There is, however, a better way, and a better shape.
The more time I spend in the kitchen, the more I'm convinced that homemade is better. There is the obvious comfort you get from knowing every single ingredient in your food. But more importantly, fresh marshmallow isn't crunchy or stale. It's pure fluff. And if you've already done all of the work to make homemade marshmallow, why make a pastel bird? It's been done. It's not very original. You can make whatever you feel like! 
Me? I felt like shit.
For the sugar coating
1 cup of sugar
Red, green, and blue food coloring
1 tablespoon of cocoa powder
For the marshmallows
1/3 cup of water
1 packet of gelatin
1/4 cup of water
1 cup of sugar
1 teaspoon of vanilla
There are a few of things you'll need to make these, in decreasing order of importance: an electric mixer, a piping bag and round tip, and a candy thermometer. You can definitely survive without the thermometer (I did!), and you can always use a baggy to pipe in a pinch, but I don't know of anyone with the upper body strength to whip on high speed for 10 minutes. If you don't have a mixer, then send this to your mom and say please.
The marshmallow comes together really fast, so before we get ahead of ourselves, we have to make the brown-colored sugar that transforms the pretty white cloud swirls into delightful dung piles.
Pour one cup of sugar and one tablespoon of cocoa powder into a zip-lock bag with food coloring. If you have brown, use that. But from a standard four pack of food coloring, an equal mixture of red, green, and blue should result in a perfect shade of poop. Squeeze out all the air, seal the bag tightly, and give it a shake. It'll be wet, so lay it out evenly on a baking sheet lined with foil to dry while you do the hard work.
Now in your mixing bowl, first pour in the water, and then sprinkle the gelatin over top. Let that sit for 10 minutes, which should be all the time you need to make the sugar syrup.
Mix up one cup of sugar and a quarter cup of water together in a small pot over medium-low heat. This step is much easier if you have a candy thermometer. Just turn the heat off when it hits 235 degrees Fahrenheit. But if not, do it the old-fashioned way. 235 is also called the soft-ball stage. When all the sugar has dissolved and the syrup is bubbling but still clear, drop a small bit into a bowl of cold water. When it's done, it should form a ball in the water but flatten in your hand. It should take about 10 minutes, so conveniently, as long as the gelatin and water need to gel.
Now break up the gel with a spoon and pour in vanilla with the syrup. Turn the mixer speed up to seven at first until it starts to thicken and the splash factor goes down, but then turn it up the whole way. After 10 minutes, what began as a lumpy goop will transform into marshmallow — a pure, airy treasure.
Spoon the marshmallow into a piping bag with a round tip and start swirling little poops piles on top of the layer of poop-brown sugar. (If you piped directly onto a tray they would never come unstuck.) To pipe like an expert, remember three keys. 1. Squeeze at the very top with your dominant hand and guide with the other, 2. Keep the pressure consistent, 3. Keep the tip directly above where you want it to go.
Also if the piles flatten then the marshmallow might still be too hot. So wait a minute or two and try again.
Before the poops dry out, coat them with the sugar to complete the cloud to poop transformation. Rolling is the most effective way to coat them completely, but sprinkle some over top first so your fingers don't stick.
I brought these to Easter brunch, and a brilliant nine-year-old put it best: "They're like poop, but way better!"

The Spring Flower Show at Phipps is a treat for the senses, and a wonderful way to de-stress at the end of a busy week. This years theme, "Masterpieces In Bloom," showcases botanical interpretations of the works of great artists such as Van Gogh and Monet. Van Gogh's "Starry Night" is reconstructed with swirls of delphiniums, forget-me-nots and primula. Beds filled with hundreds of red, orange, yellow and white tulips are used to render Monet's “Tulip Field in Holland.” Edmund Leighton’s “Lady in a Garden” is shown through the lens of hundreds of pink and red snapdragons and white orchids. These, and other botanical artworks come together to make for an otherworldly experience.
Self-Driving Car
The Miller Gallery. 6 p.m. – 8 p.m.
Mar 19 – April 10, 2016.
The Miller Gallery's second major exhibit of the year, Self-Driving Car is the final MFA Thesis Exhibition for artists Daniel Allende, Zhiwan Cheung, Nima Dehghani, Ada-Scarlett Hopper, Jesse Kauppila, Tucker Marder, and Daniel Pillis. The exhibit, composed of installations and performances considered as experimental as they are opaque, is united by the notion that all these artists, having just completed their MFAs, are completely in control of their own lives — in self-driving mode going forward.

By night one way, by day another.
Pittsburgh is one of those cities that’s evolving from what it was in its heyday. The steel mills and iconic musty air are transforming into a modern urban hub, with a mix of an old-time and rustic-chic aesthetic.
The issue that seems to exist at the moment is that this city seems to fall asleep a little too early for the average college student to appreciate. It’s often looked down at because it’s compared to cities like New York, Boston, and Chicago, when in reality, we’re a whole different type of East Coast city. But I would almost say that it is the sleepiness that currently lingers about our city that makes it accessible, and beautiful.
Our weather is unpredictable, our neighbourhoods are eclectic and distinct, and in and around Oakland we’ve got a lovely college-town atmosphere that has settled in. On a lovely sunny day we bask in the sun on picnic blankets, sipping bubble tea and scarfing down waffles and hotdogs down in Schenley. In the rain we huddle around warm bowls of ramen in establishments up and down Murray and Forbes. In the winter we keep warm with warm drinks both from the likes of big names like Starbucks and local cafes and in the spring we warily continue drinking the same beverages lest the winter snow decides to make a comeback. At night, we often find ourselves confined to our rooms finishing up assignments, or catching up on movies and tv alone or with friends. We order in pizza, wings, Indian food, and all sorts of guilty pleasures and take solace in the meaningful late night conversations we have with those wandering around dorms late at night. 
While some of the most memorable moments of my life at Carnegie Mellon have been created through such experiences, I’ve been lucky enough to be pushed out of my comfort zone this past semester by writing for this paper. I took writing about food to be a fun, easy task, until I realized that I only had so many restaurants that I knew well enough to casually sit in on and experience. Now, I actively seek out new dining opportunities, and consequently have been able to have a taste — not just of the food — but of the raw and transforming culture that Pittsburgh has to offer. So, when our very own Pillbox editor offered to accompany me for a night on the town photo session and dining extravaganza, there was no way I could have refused.
21:00
Our night began at Station Square, which is built around the late 19th century Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad (P&LE). When we told our Uber driver where we were going, he immediately asked us “which bar?”, and appropriately so. The area is now known for its many restaurants and bars, as well as its quirky mom-and-pop shops housed inside of the Freight House, which sell everything from toys to cigars.
The Freight House’s facade is something right out of what I would imagine a classic entrance for a circus to look like. Bright lights and tastefully painted bold letters that accompany a sign that proclaims the old train shed’s lifespan. “1897-1979” made this building hard to resist entering. Because we arrived a little later than anticipated, most of the stores were closed and in the unexpected emptiness, we were free to explore the charming corridors that lead us around the structure. The closed shops gave off a heavily nostalgic air of the past, which was further brought to life with a small arcade nestled off in a corner of the House. Gum ball machines and brick walls, jewellery stores and buzzing incandescent bulbs came together to yield a surreal sense of the past colliding with the present. 
21:45
With my camera filling up every extra second we spent in the Freight House, we began a short, but scenic stroll over to the Monongahela Incline at Mount Washington. I would like to note here, that admission to both the Monongahela Incline and the Duquesne Incline are free with your Carnegie Mellon ID and both lines run until 12:30 a.m. It’s a great place for some good conversation and contemplation, and once you reach the top you’ll get one of the best views in Pittsburgh.
It was from this dramatic height, perched on a concrete platform that I looked out at the yellow-lit Steel City and the clustered buildings and majestic rivers that make it up. The waters of the Monongahela river reflected the lights from the towering buildings with a long, distorted rendering, and sparkled under the illuminations from the Smithfield St. Bridge. 
We were joined by some visiting families who eagerly looked out over the city and breathed heavy sighs of satisfaction. The view stretches quite far, and includes the Carnegie Science Center, Point State Park, Heinz Field, Station Square, and much more. To the left was the hauntingly radiant St. Mary of the Mount Church, brightly lit up with an intense yellow glow. An adjacent large American flag waved in the wind, contributing the echoes of history that had been following us over the past hour as we encountered structure after structure that have been a part of Pittsburgh just a little longer than our own university has.
22:10
We would have stayed at the incline longer, but the restaurant we were planning to visit closed at 11 p.m., and we were getting hungry. Mount Washington boasts a pretty wide variety of restaurants, most within walking distance of each other, as well as some ice cream parlors and candy shops that are open during the day time. By night, the area changes from a more family friendly scene to one of laid-back nightlife, with restaurants and bars welcoming both their regulars and curious visitors.
Shiloh Grill is just a couple minutes’ walk from the top of the Monongahela Incline, and from a good distance looks like an over-decorated wooden deck. Rest assured, the restaurant has both indoor and outdoor seating, the latter of which is an ode to the aforementioned rustic-chic atmosphere that I’m beginning to pin on Pittsburgh. 
From the fiery sign to the simple, yet comfortable deck furniture that occupied to outdoor seating portion, Shiloh Grill really was something else. The railings of the deck were lining with more incandescent light bulbs and the waiters were lively and more than happy to help me with my indecisiveness. 
All-in-all, it was a fun night, and it has given me the urge to go back and see what other interesting places there are nearby. 
Pittsburgh is blossoming everywhere, and I urge you to get out there and take it by storm. Our campus is lovely, but at times it can be a little self-contained, and taking a step out is a breath of fresh air that I’ve found to be both fulfilling and refreshing. 
Now, in the spirit of my regular column, here’s a quick rundown of what we tried over at The Shiloh Grill:
Spa day: By the waiter’s recommendation, I ordered this mocktail to mellow out the intense flavors of the food to come. Flavored with lemon and cucumber, this drink was delightfully light and incredibly refreshing. I appreciated that it wasn’t as sweet as your run of the mill virgin mojito, but still had a cool quality, brought in more by cucumber slices than mint leaves.
Macaronis Et Fromage De Langoustine: LOBSTER MACARONI AND CHEESE!? Yes, and it was as glorious as it sounds. The cheese was gooey and rich, the macaroni was cooked just right, and an absolutely stunning crunchy baked crust topped the dish. The lobster flavor was also a perfect complement to the sharpness of the cheese. It was wholesome and hearty, and had me reaching back for more long after I was full.
Cookies-N-Cream: A skillet-baked cookie topped with whipped and ice cream. It was warm and cold, soft and chewy all at once. Truly a great conclusion to the evening.
Cha-ching: Cards and cash are both welcome.
Meat, glorious meat: A pretty good spread of options, although the food airs more on the meaty side.
Are we there yet?: Right across the street from the Upper Monongahela Incline Station. I’d recommend taking an Uber. 
Address: 123 Shiloh St., Pittsburgh, PA 15211.
Click, click: The website is complete with items from their menu, information about catering and much more: http://theshilohgrill.com/
For those stay-at-home days: Take out is available, but home delivery through the restaurant is not available. Here’s a number: (412) 431-4000
Hours: 
Mon-Thurs 11:30 a.m.-12 a.m. (kitchen open until 11 p.m.)
Fri & Sat 11:30 a.m.-2 a.m. (kitchen open until 1 a.m.)
Sun 10 a.m.-12 a.m. (kitchen open until 11 p.m.)
21+: The place is very famous for their quirky and innovative cocktails. They’ve also got a pretty solid wine and beer collection.
Ambience: Like I said before, rustic chic. This is a great place for dinner, and the atmosphere is incredibly, for lack of a better word, chill. The waiters were very friendly, the food was delicious, and the weather was nice (although I can’t promise that for any given night). 
College student friendly?: I didn’t see a lot of other college students around, but they’re definitely used to a young crowd and I didn’t feel out of place in any respect. 
Overall rating: 4 melons

On the morning of March 25, I rolled over in a haze to turn off my alarm, and then proceeded to check email, Twitter, Facebook, texts, and Timehop. And on my Timehop, I was confronted with harsh flashbacks of Zayn’s announcement that he would leave One Direction. On March 25, 2015, I tweeted “NO ZAYN YOU DON’T MEAN IT COME BACK PLZ STAY I LOVE YOU.” And one year later, on March 25, 2016, Zayn released Mind of Mine.
As heartbroken as I was and continue to be over the dissolution of my favorite boy band since *NSYNC, I have to concede that I can’t stop listening and dancing to Mind of Mine. Zayn completely reinvented himself, a far cry from the catchy tween tunes from his 1D days. We now know what’s going on in that mind of his. And it’s sex. 
Zayn is all grown up, whether or not his fans are.
When I watched the “Pillowtalk” music video for the first time, I nearly fell over. If it hadn’t been for the psychedelic video editing, it would have been softcore pornography. I shudder to think about the 14-year-old girls who are getting down to this, and their mothers who must feel horrified. 
I’ve lived through this so many times. Britney Spears from “...Baby One More Time” to “If You Seek Amy.” Miley Cyrus from “The Best of Both Worlds” to “We Can’t Stop.” Nick Jonas from “Lovebug” to “Area Code.” The music industry turns generations of young artists into sex symbols, but markets them to tweens and young tweens. I’m generally the same age as the 1D members, but when I went to their concert in Philadelphia a couple years ago, I found more 13 year olds than 20 year olds.
When these artists inevitably grow up to explore their creativity and sexuality, as they should, these children are yanked along for the ride. I have no problem singing loudly in the car with Zayn about “fucking and fighting,” but I do have a problem imagining middle and high schoolers trying to relate.

Potential transgressions by the Student Body Vice President of Organizations (SBVPO), Trevor Hadick, have recently come to light. Among these possible transgressions are the improper use and allocation of funds, money that comes from our student activities fees. These transgressions may be in violation of Student Government Fiscal Policy (herein referred to as the Funding Bylaws).
Student Government financial data was volunteered by the Student Body Vice President for Finance (SBVPF). We have redacted pieces of these documents for privacy concerns, and they can be found at http://pdfsr.com/profile/cmuthetartan/.
The first instance of Hadick misusing his allocation was when he used SBVPO money to buy jackets and polo shirts for the Committee on Student Organizations [CoSO]. The cost also includes embroidery of said clothing. The jackets were given to the CoSO directors, including Hadick. This appears to be in violation of the Joint Funding Committee (JFC) Bylaws, which applies to Student Government funds via Article V Section A of the Student Government Constitution. The bylaws state in Article 5, Section D, Item 1, on lines 240–41, that JFC funds cannot be used for “personal equipment, which is defined as equipment or clothing that will not be available for use by future members of an organization.”
The total cost of these items was slightly under $900.
The clothing itself does not become a violation until fiscal close. When asked to comment, Hadick claimed he was pursuing avenues to cover expenses, including having members pay for the clothing and raising revenue through fundraising, but no tangible action has been taken at this time to remedy the situation. The dates of the transactions span from Jan. 8 to 19.
There were also some potentially problematic activities with allocations of SBVPO funds, specifically the Collaborative Fund that is available for organizations to apply for via the Common Funding Application on The Bridge.
After an email requesting information on funding, Hadick sent another Student Government official documentation of the expenses of the Collaborative Fund. In this email, Hadick reported that he had allocated $1,000 to Women’s Club Soccer to offset the costs of a spring recreational league.
There is no evidence available to us to suggest that Women’s Club Soccer received any allocation from the Collaborative Fund. This allocation does not appear on the Women’s Club Soccer Team’s transactions, nor does Women’s Club Soccer appear in the list of Collaborative Fund applicants. We have been unable to reach representatives of Women’s Club Soccer for comment.
There is, however, evidence of an allocation of $1,000 from the SBVPO account to the AC Mellon Men’s Soccer Team that was stated to be for spring recreational league fees.
The journal entry transfer request shows the reason for the transfer as “Special Allocation: The mens [sic] and womens [sic] team will be try [sic] to organize rec [sic] events in the spring. This is their new initiative.” It is unclear what is meant by "organize" in this context.
In addition to SBVPO, Hadick serves as the co-president and authorized signer of AC Mellon Men’s Soccer.
Evidence of the allocation appears on both the SBVPO and AC Mellon Men’s Soccer accounts, and both transactions were processed on Feb. 9, 2016. Again, there was no application to support this allocation.
When asked for comment, Hadick encouraged us to review the list of applications. We did find two applications under AC Mellon Men’s Soccer for the Common Fund, but they do not correspond to the $1,000 from Feb. 9. One application is an extension of the other, and they jointly requested funding from Senate and GSA to cover expenses related to a tournament from October. These applications were individually created and submitted within the bylaws of Student Government and are not potential transgressions on their own.
Our investigation is ongoing.
Update (4:20 p.m.): An official from Women's Club Soccer claims not to have received any funds from this allocation, nor to be enrolled in a spring recreational league.
Update (4/10/16): Multiple officials from Women's Club Soccer claimed to have no knowledge of the allocation they are listed on.
Further, The Tartan has acquired applicants to the Common Funding Application. We filtered it for requests to the SBVPO for Collaborative Fund money. The only discrepancy between this document and the one uploaded by Hadick in a response to this article is the presence of "Club Soccer" in Hadick's document. Hadick did not respond to a request for comment. The document can be found here. Personally identifiable information has been redacted for privacy concerns.

This Wednesday, March 30, the Carnegie Mellon community was shaken by the news that two students, Elliott Glasgow and Rajat Patra, had passed away.
19-year-old   Elliott  Glasgow was a first-year undergraduate student in the College of Engineering and a New York City native. Rajat Patra was a 25-year-old student in the Heinz College Master of Information Systems Management Program from Bangalore, India.
Students noted a tangible change in the atmosphere of the campus in response to this heartbreaking and unexpected news. Many teachers cancelled classes the following day or postponed class activities in order to allow students to talk through their emotions. Students also took to social media to express the loss they felt or to express how this news impacted them strongly, even if they did not know either student personally.
In response to the passing of these two men, the horizontal bars of the fence were painted red with the integration of a lone heart. The vertical stands displayed lines in the colors of Tartan plaid to signify the integral roles Glasgow and Patra played as part of the Carnegie Mellon community.
In an email to the Carnegie Mellon community, University President Subra Suresh, Provost Farnam Jahanian, and Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno said that Glasgow “was a vital member of his residential community and a brother of Phi Delta Theta, known by his many friends for his wit and sense of humor,” and Patra was “a passionate student who had earned a prestigious internship for the summer and was planning to create his own IT consultancy after graduation. He was also an avid guitar player and proud member of the Heinz community.”
On Friday afternoon at 4:30 p.m., students, faculty, staff, and passing visitors who shared in our sorrow gathered together at the fence to reflect on the lives of Glasgow and Patra and on how this news affected us as individuals and a community.
“Their passing was an enormous loss for their families, for their friends, for their classmates and professors, and for all of the Carnegie Mellon community and beyond. Along with all of you I feel this loss very deeply,” stated President Suresh on Friday. He went on to acknowledge the strength and compassion that the Carnegie Mellon community has shown throughout this time.
Casalegno spoke to the demonstration of care and support she has witnessed from members of the Carnegie Mellon community: “I have been with some of you and with the families and students, faculty, and staff who are mourning this loss deeply. I have seen this support manifest itself in many ways.” One example that Casalegno noted was the “simple but profound expression of compassion” of painting  The Fence Thursday night.
Casalegno encouraged students to seek their own method of coping, including talking to counselors, turning to religion, exercising, taking long walks, or simply finding a quiet reflective space. She also emphasized the importance of seeking out people to lean on during this time, as well as the importance of being available for others.
“One of the hallmarks of Carnegie Mellon University is that we are passionate about our work … but that passion does not have to mean that we work at the expense of our own well-being,” Casalegno said. She stressed that we must look out for ourselves when we are struggling in order to slow down and reflect on our lives.
Provost Farnam Jahanian provides the same message as Casalegno on the importance of looking out for ourselves in an email sent to the Carnegie Mellon community the day prior. He states “We are all passionate about our work and our studies, and sometimes that passion pushes us onward, even when we need a break, or encounter unexpected challenges in our lives. We encourage you to stop and take some time for yourself, and to turn to faculty, staff, and one another when you need support. You are not alone.”
After the gathering, members of the community lingered on The Cut to be together, to share in an embrace with friends and strangers alike, and simply to be there for one another during this emotional time. 
One student at the event, who chose to remain anonymous, states “let’s stay together and make each other strong ... I love this campus. I hope I can let it know somehow.” 
Another student added  “when going through a painful situation, one may feel like a burden ... so please, if you can, reach out!” The student further added “The few seconds it takes to say ‘what’s up’ or ‘how are you doing’ or ‘let’s hang out’ could mean the world to them...Please everyone, take care of yourselves. I love all of you!”
Though this news has sparked thoughtful conversations from members of the community, we should not forget the lives that Elliott Glasgow and Rajat Patra led prior to their passing.

This Thursday, March 28, Carnegie Mellon University hosted an interfaith forum, in which a Humanist, a Hindu, and a Christian gathered to discuss their personal and religious beliefs on the topics of good and evil, and what this means for people in today’s society.
Andy Norman, the director of Carnegie Mellon’s Humanism Initiative, began his introduction by describing himself as a philosopher and a teacher, and noted that he is “fortunate to be the faculty adviser to the Student Humanist League.” Next up to introduce himself was Kunal Ghosh, a Carnegie Mellon physics professor who describes himself as a scientist first, and a Hindu second, which he jokingly noted makes him “the least qualified” on the panel. Ghosh pointed out at the start that Hinduism is more flexible than some other religions, as there is not one single prophet or book that you must devote yourself to. Rather, you can choose your own morals and find meaning within Hinduism for yourself. Last to introduce himself was Bruce Backensto, a pastor at First Reformed Presbyterian Church of Beaver Falls, PA who believes in the holy trinity of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. In the preliminary introductions, Backensto laid out his basic philosophy: “Love God with all your heart, soul, strength, and mind, and do as you please. Because if I truly love him, I will do that which truly pleases him.” These three different takes on faith in the modern world set the stage for an interesting discussion on different belief systems throughout the world and how they interpret good and evil. Ricky Law, a professor of history at Carnegie Mellon, was the moderator for this discussion.
The first question that was posed to the three panelists was “Where do good and evil come from? Are their origins human, or supernatural?” 
The first response came from Norman, who stated Socrates’ philosophy that there are two schools of thought: either morality comes “top-down,” from God, or “bottom-up,” from personal ideas and beliefs. Norman believes that there is a lot more evidence for the bottom-up philosophy, meaning that our perception of good and evil stems from ourselves, and humans before us.
Next, Ghosh responded to the same question. His take on the topic was that morality can come from many places. Good and bad have many roots. If a child tries to put their hand in a fire but their parent stops them, they have learned what is “bad” from their parent. If they read the bible, or the Qur’an, or any other religious text, and those messages take root, they have learned morality from a deity and religion. There is no right answer according to Ghosh, and the origin of good and evil doesn’t matter as long as we can distinguish between the two.
The final response to this question came from Backensto, who mentioned that man is made in God’s own image, and that we were born with temptation, referencing the story of Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden. Backensto believes that God gave us a choice, and that freedom is a representation of how good and evil manifest themselves in the world. Eve chose the apple, and in that moment original sin was born, along with the origin of good and evil.
Other questions asked by Ricky Law, an assistant professor of history at Carnegie Mellon, followed a similar pattern: Norman would respond with a basis in human thoughts and philosophies, Backensto would respond with teachings from Christianity, and Ghosh would respond with an opinion somewhere in the middle. 
Occasionally controversial statements were made, such as Norman stating that “the more closely tied a society is to religion, the poorer the quality of life,” but the argument never got heated, and the panelists calmly discussed their personal beliefs and how they are applied. The panelists also discussed attending additional discussions together afterward, to spread their personal ideas to different groups and promote more interfaith dialogues. Overall, the interfaith panel was a successful event organized by members of the Student Humanist League.
The event promoted a powerful discussion on where different belief systems draw their values and how they let these beliefs impact their lives. Although the speakers were brought together due to their differences, the most striking aspect of the conversation was how similar they were. All of these panelists used their beliefs to better themselves, and to live their lives according to values that are universally understood among humanity.

“What does it mean to live in a ‘Zero Waste Home’?” asked Bea Johnson, grand prize winner of the Green Awards, at a Carnegie Mellon College of Engineering lecture this past Thursday. Johnson held up a small mason jar filled with scraps to the audience. “This is all the waste my family produced in 2015,” she said. Immediately, the audience was shocked, but as Johnson began explaining her finely adapted lifestyle, the concept of her sustainability ceased to be a surprise.
Bea Johnson is the author of the bestselling book Zero Waste Home, an incredibly detailed guide to maintaining a sustainable, earth-friendly lifestyle. She has two younger sons, and lives with her husband and their chihuahua. Their family has been living with the idea of zero waste since 2008.
Johnson admits that zero waste was not their original goal. Their sustainable lifestyle began with them watching documentaries like Slow Death by Rubber Duck, which led to Johnson and her husband’s “environmental awakening.” Their motivation, Johnson said, came from seeing the “future they would leave their kids,” which pushed her and her spouse to adopt a “voluntary simplicity” mindset. The initial steps were tricky. Johnson’s husband, Scott, created a sustainability company, while Johnson learned to can tomatoes each summer. Johnson then tried to find alternatives for her common household products. For example, she had heard that stinging nettle could substitute for lip plumper, which unfortunately resulted in some hilariously painful results. She also considered moss as a substitute for toilet paper, but did not realize that dried moss would be completely ineffective. Eventually, she uncovered a new strategy to her minimalist lifestyle.
Johnson now advocates for The Five Rs: refuse, reduce, reuse, recycle, and rot (specifically in that order). The first step to achieving a less wasteful lifestyle is refusing what you do not need. Johnson has found that refusing to take business cards, promotional items, and even free pens at conferences significantly cuts down the clutter in their home. Her family refuses to partake in non-green practices and has even found a way to fully eliminate junk mail (really).
The second “R” is reducing what we do need. Most Americans have a habit of buying excess and then throwing away what they do not use. Johnson has opted instead for a minimalist lifestyle, only consuming what she absolutely needs. She gave the example of her kitchen utensils, where she used to own ten wooden spoons. Eventually she realized “I’m only stirring with one hand at a time.” She then sold back nine spoons to the market and has not regretted the decision since. Johnson claims that “the beauty of decluttering allows for goods to be put back on the market and gives access to others.” Johnson’s family has also eliminated all their toxic cleaning products and can clean the entirety of their home using white vinegar and castile soap. Minimalism has infiltrated every aspect of their lifestyle. Johnson herself only owns five to six skirts and shirts, all versatile enough to be both casual and formal. Sticking to only leather shoes, she can easily get them repaired at a shoe shop, while her sons donate their used tennis shoes to a recycling program. She no longer buys manufactured cosmetic items, and instead creates them using natural ingredients from around her house.
By swapping disposable items for a reusable alternative, the third “R,” Johnson has drastically extended the lifetime of every product she owns. She uses a wooden brush instead of a sponge to clean her dishes, which lasts for 2­-3 years. By substituting handkerchiefs for tissues, cloth for plastic wrap, and glass for disposables, nothing is ever thrown away. In fact, her family only buys secondhand items, even furniture, to give everything a new life. What you cannot end up refusing, reducing, or reusing, Johnson said, you must recycle.
The fourth “R” is the one we are most familiar with. Recycling bottles of wine and school papers is elementary when considering that Johnson’s family only purchases metal, glass, wood or cardboard goods so it is guaranteed that those items can be recycled. “The problem with plastics,” Johnson states, “is that they are often recycled into un-recyclable items — like a park bench.” Thus, her family avoids purchasing plastic at all costs.
Finally, anything that the first four “Rs” can not take care of, must composted. Living in California has its perks, as Johnson can simply take biodegradable items to a curbside composting bin. Nearly everything, from hair to floor sweepings to dryer lint, is compostable if you think about it.
At the end of the day, Johnson seems like a green energy superwoman. She is living and succeeding in a lifestyle many of us could hardly consider. However, there are stigmas surrounding her lifestyle, she claimed. Many people assume she does not work a full -time job, though she does, and that she hand crafts everything, though she only hand crafts her makeup. In fact, the zero waste lifestyle has allowed her family to save 40 percent of their budget. A minimalist lifestyle plus an increase in savings has allowed the family to focus on experiences and not things. By renting out their home during vacations, the Johnsons are able to go on some incredible bond-building journeys which have kept them happy and healthy. When asked if Johnson regrets anything about her lifestyle shift, her only response was “not starting sooner.”

On March 28, economist, Stanford professor, and long-term Microsoft consultant Susan Athey gave a lecture entitled “Impact of the Internet on the News Media.” In this lecture, Athey explained how in recent years there has been a loss of “good journalism” as blogs and aggregator sites like Google News have begun to grow. Readers are getting their information from many different sources, and only a few of them are “real” newspapers. Athey went on to explain how the Internet makes it easy for consumers to switch between several different news outlets and how this affects newspapers. She also discussed how news media interacts with the rise of social media and aggregator news sites.
Athey explained that when everyone is able to access news through many different sources, much of the advertisement revenue that is generated by newspapers decreases. While the Internet makes it easier for consumer switching to occur, it also makes it harder to track what consumers are reading and where they are reading it. This makes it harder for news sites such as The New York Times to track what their consumers are reading and what kind of advertisements they should allow on their sites. 
“Newspapers used to have a monopoly on their audiences, and if advertisers wanted to reach readers of certain newspapers, they would have to reach out to that newspaper specifically to get their readers,” Athey explained. Now, however, with consumer switching, readers are not guaranteed to stay at one site and will most likely consume news from several different sites, making it difficult for advertisers to target specific audiences through a single newspaper.
Now, advertisers must use multi homing (advertising through multiple news sources) to reach the same groups, meaning they must advertise via a variety of sites. This is not always precise, however, and can result in advertisers wasting the same advertisement on the same readers. On the other hand, if advertisers choose to use single homing, they are potentially missing out on consumers by only being present on one news source.
Athey continued on to talk about how “the business of a newspaper is to match users to advertisers.” Essentially what this means is that it is the job of the newspaper to provide content that is enticing to the type of consumers that advertisers want to reach. 
Aggregator sites such as Huffington Post and Google News increase consumer switching, which makes the problems that advertisers face even more apparent. These sites aggregate news from different sites and provide it in one location that can be customized based on the preferences of the user. The presentation of these news stories makes a difference on what is read. Readers generally won’t go to the second page of a site for search results even if that’s where the best information is. They tend to select the first available option presented to them by aggregators. These aggregator sites generally use this idea to their advantage when laying out their sites and choosing resources. This can be a good and a bad thing for other news sites. While it can attract readers to a news site they might not have gone to before, it also sends readers to other sites and reduces the number of clicks on specific news sites. For example, Google News has a very strong impact on the traffic that other news sites receive, Athey explained.
To conclude her lecture, Athey presented research that showed that people tend to read more biased news on social media as opposed to the news they would read from just direct navigation to a source. She explained that while social media is beneficial for “selling the ability to reach” to advertisers, consumers will only see what they want to see based on personal biases. This poses a new challenge for advertisers and traditional newspapers. Not only have users switched where they are getting their information, but they have also switched what information they are interested in reading.
Despite the shift in the way users are getting news, Athey ended on a positive note. “We know people are reading,” she explained. “People haven’t stopped reading.” Athey’s research shows that users haven’t stopped looking for news and they haven’t stopped consuming it. If advertisers and traditional news outlets can tap into the viewing patterns of their previous and existing consumers, there is still hope for “good journalism” after all.

NROTC senior presented with $4,000 scholarship by decorated war veteran
Midshipman Grant Langevin, a senior mechanical engineering major and member of the Carnegie Mellon Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC), was presented with a $4,000 scholarship from the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association in partnership with the Medal of Honor Foundation, by Medal of Honor recipient Colonel Harvey Barnum in Rashid Auditorium. Around 100 students in the NROTC program attended the event in which Barnum also spoke about his experiences.
The scholarship  is awarded to students who have shown good moral character, exhibited academic achievement, and demonstrated potential to serve as an officer in the U.S. Armed Forces. In May, Langevin will graduate with both bachelor’s and master’s degrees in mechanical engineering. Upon graduation, Langevin will commission as an ensign in the U.S. Navy’s Naval Reactors program, a U.S. government office that is responsible for the safe and reliable operation of the Navy’s nuclear propulsion program.
At the event, Barnum spoke about his experiences in the Marine Corps during the Vietnam War and offered advice on leadership, humility, and patriotism. He is one of only 78 living recipients of the Medal of Honor, which is the United States’ highest military honor.
“It was a motivating experience that has me looking forward to my future service in the U.S. Navy, and I can hope I can live up to the example that Colonel Barnum set during his service,” Langevin said.
**Carnegie Mellon students create a water purification and transportation barrel **
A group of mechanical engineering seniors — Deepak Ravi, Anna Mirabella, Jack Kaplan, Veronica Jaime-Lara, and Alex Baker — have designed a barrel called the Water Transportation and Purification System. The barrel filters water as it rolls, an innovation that considers those who may have to walk for miles to find water and then filter so that it is safe to drink.
The barrel is made of only a few parts and requires no power; mechanical energy is generated by the rolling of the barrel. It uses a Sawyer water filter that never needs to be replaced, and is made of recycled plastic industrial barrels that are normally thrown away. It was developed as a project for the group’s Mechanical Engineering Senior Design course, taught by associate teaching professor Noé Vargas Hernández. The class is a requirement for all mechanical engineering majors and focuses on taking a project from conception to prototype.
The prototype they came up with costs $200, but with mass production the team estimates that the cost should go down to only $40 a unit. In addition, a single barrel could serve an entire community, since the water carried in it is purified by the time it arrives home. The tank holds 15 gallons of water, which is “about a weekly supply of water for a family in the developing world,” Ravi said.
“We’ve decided to make this design open source,” Mirabella said. “If someone wants to manufacture our system and get it down to that $40, none of us would be upset. It would be awesome to have had a small part of something big.”

There was a bomb blast on March 22 in Brussels. 32 people were injured in the blast. 
Immediately, almost all western media reacted to this, and was shocked by these suicide bombs led by ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria).
On March 20, that same week, there was an alleged suicide bombing led by ISIS in Istanbul, Turkey. 36 injured. There was another one on March 13, in Ankara, with a deadly car bomb that exploded. In Lahore, there was another bomb blast this week, where 75 people were killed and over 340 injured by the Taliban.
Yet most Facebook posts I saw and most news articles popularized by the Western media described the tragedy in Brussels. When they were both equally tragic tragedies, only one was cared for. Where was the discussion on Turkey? Lahore? Where were the condolences towards those who face this more regularly than in Western countries? Where was the extensive media coverage?
Where was my profile picture filter with the Turkish Flag?
Our world values some tragedies over others. This very similar situation occurred with the attacks in Paris last year. 
The attacks non-western countries face from terrorist groups are often much larger than the ones western countries face. This may be a once a year occurrence in Brussels, but it’s a nearly monthly battle in Turkey, Pakistan, Palestine, Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan. 
This speaks to an imperialistic mindset that exists within our society — non-western countries, bodies, and people do not matter as much. The value of humanity that we hold today is inherently placed upon those who have the power to fight this, not those who don’t.
Part of this is Islamophobia, and the attacks by the Islamic militant groups certainly don’t help. Do people know that ISIS is a larger threat to Muslims than to non-Muslims? Do people know that average Muslim people are targeted by both militants and backlash from the west? Our media is dominated by what we see and who controls it.
The fact is that tragedies like these are daily in some places. But this isn’t often enough for the western media to report it or to care. 
My heart goes out to the victims of Paris and Brussels, but also to the victims of the Lahore, Istanbul, and Ankara attacks. 
We can’t say some lives matter more than others, or let distance from a tragedy obscure the humanity. 
So let’s change the discourse, educate ourselves, and look at where our news is coming from. Because, quite frankly, #JeSuisSickOfThisShit.

At the beginning of March, the Supreme Court heard its first abortion case in nine years. The fate of women’s reproductive freedom in America rests on the decision in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt. Keep a careful eye on this one, guys, because it will either revive Roe v. Wade, or deal it a final death blow. 
Many aren’t aware of, first, the incredible blessing that Roe was for American women, and, second, how far Roe has fallen since it legalized abortion in 1973. Roe was a Supreme Court decision before its time and perhaps, in spirit at least, before ours. Prior to Roe, abortion care was denied to women in almost every state and under all circumstances apart from risk to the mother’s life. 
Far from ancient or even common law, anti-abortion laws were an invention of the Victorian era, enacted superficially to protect women’s health but in reality to control their bodies. 
Abortions continued to occur despite ubiquitous restrictions, but for the most part they were desperate, dangerous, back-alley ordeals that put women at grave physical and psychological risk. 
The “Second Wave” feminist movement in the 1960s through 70s demanded an end to such restrictions on a woman’s right to choose the timing and circumstances of her entry into motherhood. In 1973, when a handful of blue states were just beginning to liberalize their anti-abortion laws in response to feminist pressure, Roe shocked the nation. 
Freedom to choose an abortion, with certain limitations, was now the law of the land. Roe legalized abortion not absolutely, but on a sliding scale. According to the decision, the woman’s interests in the first trimester far outweigh any interests of the fetus, and the abortion procedure at this stage is so safe — safer than childbirth, in fact — that the state has no reason to interfere. Abortion in the first trimester should be considered “inherently, and primarily, a medical decision,” the private business of a woman and her physician. 
After the second trimester, the safety of the woman may be increasingly balanced with the safety of the fetus. Abortion may be banned only in the third trimester, when the greatly increased safety risks of the procedure and viability of the fetus — its “capability of meaningful life outside the mother’s womb” — become “compelling” enough for the government to override the woman’s choice. Considering that over  90 percent of abortions occur in the first term, the Roe decision granted most women the absolute legal right to an abortion. For a brief shining moment, the highest court in the land respected women’s right to choose and granted them unprecedented — if not total — control over their own bodies. 
Unfortunately, abortion opponents have worked diligently in the decades since 1973 to disempower Roe. The oft-forgotten Hyde Amendment has severely limited abortion access, particularly for low-income women. 
Successfully defended before the Supreme Court in 1980, this amendment to Roe cut off all federal government funding for abortions, including any abortion coverage through military or government job insurance as well as Medicaid — except in cases of rape, incest, or endangerment of the mother’s life. 
32 states follow the Hyde Amendment to the letter, with six extending funds in the case of fetal impairment or grave impact on the mother’s health, while 17 states may partially or even wholly mitigate the costs for “medically necessary” abortions. 
The main result of the Hyde Amendment is that underprivileged women on Medicaid, who constitute about 16 percent of the adult female American population, have been forced for the last 36 years to pay for abortions out of pocket. 
These costs are high, averaging $500 in the first trimester, and apart from the abortion procedure itself women often must pay several hundred dollars in transportation and childcare costs as well as lost wages. The total expense of the abortion “experience” might demand a third or more of a low-income woman’s monthly salary. 
The Hyde Amendment, working together with women’s concerns that their insurance will not provide coverage or protect their confidentiality, has greatly contributed to a post-*Roe* society where almost 70 percent of insured women across the socioeconomic spectrum cannot or do not use their insurance to pay for abortion care. This statistic may only get worse. 
Last January, Congress voted for the eighth time in a year to defund Planned Parenthood, and despite GOP representatives’ failure to override President Obama’s veto, 11 states have taken it upon themselves to cut funds for the non-profit.  
Anti-choice Republicans in state and national congresses, bolstered by a well-funded lobbying machine, have been willfully forgetting the Hyde Amendment’s existence in order to disguise their true aims. It has been all too easy for Republicans with Hyde-shaped holes in their memories to argue that cutting off federal funds to Planned Parenthood would only mean a nod to the sensitivities of anti-choice taxpayers. 
However, the Hyde Amendment ensured decades ago that no federal taxpayer would have to pay for abortion care, and Planned Parenthood uses federal funds not for its abortion practice but exclusively for contraception, STI testing, and cancer screenings.
The ultimate goal of the GOP’s attack is not only Planned Parenthood’s head on a platter — IUDs, pap smears, and all — but nothing less than total elimination of insurance coverage for abortion. 
Ironically, President Obama’s Affordable Care Act has made this mission easier by providing federal support for private insurance companies. Since the federal government now has more power to regulate these ostensibly independent companies, it becomes feasible that anti-choice Republicans could incentivize private companies to drop abortion coverage. 
For all women, but especially poor women, this is a frightening prospect indeed, as lack of coverage often means complete inability to purchase abortion care. 
In 1992, Planned Parenthood v. Casey fundamentally reversed Roe’s ban on state interference in first-trimester abortions and opened the floodgates for severe and often absurd restrictions on access. 
The case brought the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act of 1982 before the Supreme Court in the midst of a nationwide swing back toward the right. 
An anti-abortion law obviously in violation of Roe, the Abortion Control Act featured first-trimester obstacles to abortion such as a 24-hour waiting period, parental consent for minors, and a mandatory “informed consent” counseling session that included false information about the supposed detrimental effects of abortion. 
The Casey decision, in direct opposition to Roe, proclaimed that these obstacles were legal so long as they did not pose an “undue burden” to a woman trying to access an abortion. Since Casey, the number of state TRAP laws — or “Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers” — has skyrocketed.  
In addition to the regulations earlier mentioned, certain TRAP laws require abortion clinics to conform to surgical requirements for no medically valid reason, essentially forcing them to either spend a fortune to rebuild or to shut down. Faced with a minefield of entirely legal TRAP laws, it is unsurprising, if not disheartening, that the number of abortion clinics in the United States has declined steadily and significantly since 1983.  More regulations mean fewer clinics can survive, and fewer clinics mean that fewer women can access abortion care without traveling long distances and facing the consequent costs. The “undue burden” change to Roe is the perfect loophole to regulate abortion rights to death.  This “undue burden” clause will be addressed in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt. 
The case challenges Texas’s 2013 HB-2, a TRAP law that requires all abortion clinics to spend many millions on wholly unnecessary outpatient surgical facilities and admitting privileges at local hospitals. HB-2 has forced almost half of the state’s abortion clinics to close in just a few years; the second largest U.S. state now has only 19 clinics serving its huge territory, practically insuring most women will have to drive hundreds of miles for medical care. Even these are far from safe from further restrictions. 
Hellerstedt will determine once and for all whether such laws constitute an “undue burden” on women’s access to abortion. The recent death of conservative Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia has substantially changed the outlook for the case and may be a tentative beam of hope for pro-choice advocates. Now, there is a firm possibility that the Court will split 4–4 instead of upholding the Texas TRAP laws wholesale. But this would only delay the death blow I mentioned earlier, leaving women just as vulnerable to increasingly ubiquitous state restrictions.
In the decades since a Roe granted American women the right to an abortion, the “undue burden” clause and the Hyde Amendment have left reproductive freedom dead in the water. Our old friend Roe is a conservative ruling or two away from null. Right without access is no right at all, and legalized abortion won’t matter if no clinics can afford to stay open and no woman can afford to abort. 
If there is no obstacle too great between a woman and an abortion, then abortion might as well be illegal. 
Women’s battle to claim control over their bodies is far from over. Their enemies are patient and organized, with deep pockets: a multi-headed hydra of zealous Christians, right-wing fundamentalists, and unabashed misogynists. 
Keep an eye on Hellerstedt, and don’t doubt the power of the states to cut into women’s access to abortion. Most importantly of all, keep fighting. Because without the right to control your own body, you have nothing.

Roosevelt Institute @ CMU
With a six-year cushion, it is tempting to look back on the Recession of 2008 as an old injury, one that is healing well as unemployment rates drop, the housing market improves, and private-sector jobs expand. All these improvements are due in large part to the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. That progress is undeniably promising, but there are parts of the economy that have remained largely untouched by the recovery — such as the infinitely ballooning price of college education.
Tuition at Carnegie Mellon has increased nearly $10,000 since 2010 , and while the university cites projects such as The Sherman and Joyce Bowie Scott Hall and the University Center expansion as key factors, there are other mechanisms at work. The Roosevelt Institute at CMU, a student-run branch of the New York City based Roosevelt Institute has found that Carnegie Mellon has lost over $39 million in interest rate swap deals since 2004. To put that figure into perspective, that’s enough to pay for the tuition of almost 200 students for four years of undergraduate at Carnegie.
Interest rate swaps are fittingly named. A swap deal occurs when a firm takes out a loan or bond and chooses to swap the variable rate on its interest payments for a fixed rate. For example; Carnegie Mellon took out a $100 million loan in 2006 for help funding construction and refunding its previous debts. The university chose to pay a fixed monthly interest rate of 3.4 percent rather than paying a variable rate that would fluctuate with the market. This was before the recession, when banks were telling investors that interest rates were going to increase. So swapping no doubt seemed like a good way to save money.
Unfortunately the crash happened, and interest rates fell. Because of the swap agreement, CMU was locked into its fixed rate and ended up paying a much higher monthly interest rate than the market rate, which collapsed alongside the rest of the economy. A move that was initially intended to save the university money has ended up costing $24 million — and the deal doesn’t end until 2028.
This arrangement worked out nicely for the university’s counterparty, PNC Financial Services. Though the 2008 recession took many by surprise, there are those who think some bankers knew it was going to happen, and saw potential profit in swap deals. Regardless of whether or not they were aware that it was coming, banks were the ones responsible for the 2008 crash. The swap deals that many universities have undertaken at this time proved to be bad deals across the board, and universally beneficial for the banks. It begs the question: should bankers be more transparent regarding their beliefs about the future?
The answer is obvious. Financial institutions are legally obligated to relate pertinent information to their clients in order to avoid this very issue, and should be held accountable when they make profits off of the money we pay our university. We ask this of our institution: make better decisions so as to keep that money where it belongs. 
And of its financial partners: respect the integrity and fairness of partnership so that we may secure a viable financial future for our university.

This week, California State Legislature proposed and approved a bill raising the state minimum wage to $15. This is the first state to approve a minimum wage of $15. The only previous minimum wage hikes that high were in major cities, like Seattle, San Francisco, and Los Angeles.
Now, as someone raised in L.A., I may seem a bit biased. I have grown up in an area with one of the highest costs-of-living in the country. Instituting the long-term minimum wage hike last year in Los Angeles to $15 seemed like a no-brainer. But what people need to realize is that $15 should not be the stopping point. Especially for single parents with one child, the livable wage is much higher. For example, according to the Living Wage Calculator developed by MIT professor Amy Glasmeier, it averages out to about $25.26 per hour for the entire state of California.
You may say to yourself, ‘but that’s California! Those West Coast people have such a bizarre lifestyle, of course it’s more expensive.’ But that very same statistic put up against all 50 states puts the lowest livable wage for single parents in Kentucky,, at $18.50 — $3.50 above the highest minimum wage in the country.
On Thursday, Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York also announced another deal to raise the minimum wage to $15 statewide. With the two of the most populous states in the country making this change, it is only a matter of time before the rest of the country follows suit.
The main argument against raising the wage is that it will cost employment. The argument goes that raising wages will force business to lose money and cut jobs. It seems reasonable, except that there is very little evidence to support it. Sure, if you raised the minimum wage to $1,000/hour, no one could pay it, and the concept of a job would lose meaning overnight. Still, this isn’t the case. The extreme example doesn’t set the record straight. Rather, these raises are only a few dollars. There hasn’t been enough clear testing to know if these incremental raises affect employment. But considering the long term, the minimum wage has been raised 22 times since 1938. In this time, the national GDP per capita has gone up even when the minimum wage was raised. There isn’t a complete consensus on the issue, but many economists agree that the effect on employment is negligible overall..
In the end, if the minimum wage is above the livable wage for single people, effects will start to ripple through the economy. People will spend their money. Going back to Henry Ford’s concept that his workers should be able to afford his cars, people with higher wages tend to put back into the economy. This will strengthen the middle class and help create a more stable environment of economic growth. Hopefully more people will realize that California’s change is one step in ensuring that wealth gets to those at the bottom, and not just at the top. This is a step that the entire nation should be taking.

There has been a lot of discussion about stress culture, mental health, and social support at CMU, and it is clear that people aren’t really sure what the best way to move forward is. Not even considering the issue of limited funding for mental health, there are so many factors in what it takes to create a mentally healthy environment and it would require a lot to move the discussion outside of hashtags and figure out how we can do better. 
This is simply because mental health is a complicated topic, there are so many factors that could benefit from intervention. Arguably no mental health debate has gotten more attention that the question of trigger warnings. Restructuring this discussion to focus on the ways we can provide additional support on campus and with the media we consume will allow us to create a more accessible and safe environment for individuals with mental illnesses.
Despite the fact that the conversation about trigger warnings and mental health has successfully left the utopia of social media blogging platforms and entered discussion on college campuses, the discussion has become so polarizing that it is no longer moving in a productive way. 
Without a solid understanding of what people that are suffering from trauma, anxiety, depression, and the huge range of disorders that are vulnerable to triggers actually need from their environment, the conversation has turned into a question of censorship, what people find uncomfortable, and a one size fits all accommodation for mental illnesses.
A look into the history of trigger warnings does not tell us much. The thing about the word “trigger” and the definition we now associate with it is that, well, it’s not clear where it comes from. Looking at academic papers in psychiatric and clinical journals, the term trigger doesn’t hold the same specific meaning; it is largely just used as verb to describe a cause-and-effect of a disorder. Papers in The American Journal of Psychiatry use the word trigger to describe what causes a disorder, such as a study on whether physical illness triggers body dysmorphic disorders. 
It appears to have first emerged through feminist journals and social media to describe a common experience of mental illness, and it garnered enough popular opinion to stick around. With the support of extremely liberal students, vaguely therapeutic speech has worked its way into our culture as a clinical buzzword.
Changing mental health care based on experiential accounts rather than research is not new, or really the main issue behind trigger warnings. Therapy and psychiatry rely on the development of language to break down problematic neural associations that underlie a number of mental disorders and help their patients bring symptoms under control. 
So, naturally, there is a parallel development in language growth of the therapeutic and pop cultural. In fact, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) was first included in the third Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of mental disorders (DSM-III) as a result of veterans returning home from Vietnam, and this diagnosis initially faced a lot of skepticism and controversy. What a trigger means colloquially is a stimuli that sets off destructive symptoms of a disorder, usually relating to trauma, phobias, or self harm. 
Any sort of label or diagnosis or buzzword serves the function of simply communicating a specific idea in a way that allows us to explain our experiences more specifically. The lack of language to talk about illness is a challenge for most people dealing with mental health problems. I would be hesitant, therefore, to dismiss both the significance of the term as well as its origins.
One of the other arguments against the implementation of trigger warnings is the idea that the real world does not come with trigger warnings, so we should not be teaching students to avoid their problems. 
This is a statement that needs to be unpacked and, to some extent, debunked. It is clear that the immediate need to dismiss the idea of trigger warnings is directed at its origins. Those involved in feminist, racial, and queer discourse are more likely to promote the use of trigger warnings, and the need to lump triggers in with political correctness and censorship is frankly callous. It is not “coddling” or unreasonable to expect a college environment to prevent students from reaching a state of psychological distress that they pose a danger to themselves or their well-being.
On the other hand, the response to such accusations ends up in such a state of defensiveness that there is not enough attention given to the practical issues of implementation.  The prevalent idea behind trigger warnings is a starting point, not a final solution to changing the environment on college campuses to foster better mental health. For either side, it would be valuable to look into clinical strategies and the etiology of the myriad of mental illnesses that trigger warnings are intended to help.
Exposure therapy is used mainly to treat phobias, and this is what the classic arguments against trigger warnings seem to be drawing from. The idea behind exposure is that to deal with the triggering stimuli, you have to face it and learn to cope with the negative reaction. Over time, the association formed will become weaker and the stimuli stops being triggering.  
As much as learning to cope with immense psychological and physiological reactions is the foundation of most treatments, it is not simply advise to just deal with being upset. Patients learn to face their triggers in a clinical, safe environment using a combination of skills from talk therapy, progressive muscle relaxation, mindfulness, distress tolerance, and the wide range of specific treatment plans to an individual’s disorder and mental state. 
Trigger warnings intend to give power back to an individual to take control of their own recovery and what they are capable of dealing with on a day to day basis.
That is the idea behind it, anyway. But it is also where the proposed solution falls short. On social media, designing your own utopian space is the point. 
But the reality is that colleges do not have the resources to accommodate everyone’s trigger in the form of a trigger warning, and therapists do not generally support the strategy of avoiding triggers in real life.
The reason for this is that anything can be a trigger. Yet not labeling everything with a trigger warning implies a hierarchy of legitimacy in disorders, and that is counter productive.  
And it is not realistic to expect trigger-warning labels for literally everything, for obvious reasons. Sexual assault and suicide trigger warnings are thoughtful, but they do not consider the fact that triggers are generally random associations — a location, an object, a name, a sound — with a traumatic event or the fight-or-flight response. Furthermore, not everyone knows what will be triggering.
So it is more helpful to have a plan to help if something triggering comes up rather than struggling to keep classes and media trigger free. The second part of a clinical exposure is learning to apply distress tolerance and coping skills. Developing a safety plan is a part of trauma treatment, and there are modifications that can be designed for a wide variety of disorders. This is great because it gives an individual skills to try to cope with a trigger, which means that facing the world is a more achievable task.
A campus-wide safety plan, therefore, would appear to be the best solution for the exposure to a trigger. Giving students the ability to opt out of a lecture is important, but the follow up care is by far more important. Leaving class because of triggering subject matter can increase the stress of the situation, putting the spotlight on the student without actually starting a conversation . In some ways it is another way of letting our campus community not take responsibility for our collective mental health. 
If a student is triggered in class, given a warning or not, what support structures do we have in place to help them? This is about day-to-day challenges, so there should be an easily accessible professional to turn to or a space to work through a safety plan. 
CaPS and the Mindfulness Room are both good first steps to providing that support, but they are both difficult spaces to enter. There are small changes, like having counsellors that can be reached immediately rather than the two week appointment or comfortable lounges where students can decompress, working with skills they have learnt in therapy. 
Moving towards these kind of questions, trying out different solutions and working through problems in existing systems, is a better discussion to be having because it allows to account for the complexity of mental health. 
Mental health care is not a one and done deal, it requires the community and professionals to work together to provide support.

The past week has been a rough time to be a member of the Carnegie Mellon community. We suddenly lost not one, but two of our peers. Rajat Patra and Elliott Glasgow were both far too young to be taken away from us. 
Even as we reel from the shock and mourn their loss, we must remember Rajat and Elliott not for their early deaths, but for the incredible people they were during happier times. 
At The Tartan, we want to play our part and address the issues with the respect that they deserve. As a result, we’re making a change to this week’s paper that we’d like to explain.
We are postponing our Natrat edition. Natrat is our once-a-year, April Fool’s day themed edition that we typically publish during the first week of April, which includes fake satirical news similar to The Onion. 
In light of the past week, fake news that pokes fun at Carnegie Mellon’s idiosyncrasies would not be appropriate at this time. Instead, we have decided to dedicate the front page of the paper to the memorial service for both Elliott and Rajat. They deserve to have their story told, and we want to do everything we can to achieve that end. 
It is with this reasoning that we felt this was the most appropriate course of action given the circumstances.
We also want to urge people to take a moment to reflect on Elliott and Rajat and the lives they lived. The discussions these deaths have sparked on campus are well-meaning and important, but it is also important to ensure that the lives of the people igniting these conversations are not pushed aside.
As Carnegie Mellon’s newspaper, we want to make sure we treat this tragedy with the deference deserved by the campus community and both Elliott and Rajat.

The 2016 presidential election, set for Nov. 8, will see many young individuals voting for the first time in a presidential election, but not all of these individuals will have had the opportunity to vote in their state’s primary or caucus. In many states, including Pennsylvania, age restrictions require citizens to be 18 years old to vote in their party’s corresponding primary or caucus, meaning that 17-year-old citizens are unable to vote in their primary or caucus, even if they will be 18 before the general election.
Laws have already been passed in many states that allow 17-year-olds to vote in their respective primary or caucus provided they will turn 18 before the general election. 17-year-olds can vote in primaries and caucuses in the District of Columbia and over 20 states, although several of these states are only open to 17-year-old Democrats.
Threshold voter laws have become a controversial topic, and many argue that if someone is able to vote in the general election, they should have some say in their party’s nominee. 
Threshold voter laws in Pennsylvania’s neighboring state of Ohio have been under scrutiny this year after Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted announced in December that threshold voters would no longer be allowed to participate in the Ohio primary. Husted has since been overruled, and the courts ruled on March 11 that threshold voters could continue to participate in the primaries.
The issue of threshold voters has also been raised in Pennsylvania, namely in a 2007 proposed bill sponsored by then State Rep. Richard Grucela (D–Northampton). State Rep. Robert Freeman (D–Northampton) also supported the bill, noting that it would encourage young voters to get involved and stay involved. “If we engage them now, there’s a greater likelihood they’ll stay involved for the rest of their lives,” Freeman said. While the proposed bill was supported by many, some argued that the focus should be on more important issues such as voter fraud. Despite the support of a variety of potential threshold voters, some of whom testified during a House State Government Committee hearing, the bill did not pass.
Currently, Pennsylvania still requires all voters to be 18, although there is some speculation that this could change. Wanda Murren, press secretary for the Pennsylvania Department of State, acknowledged that the Department of State is looking into threshold voter laws. “The department is currently reviewing how other states are handling this,” Murren said, although she noted that even if changes were made, they would not affect this year’s primary.
Although threshold voters will not be able to participate in this year’s primaries, The Tartan hopes that the recent focus on threshold voting laws in Pennsylvania will persist and that laws allowing threshold voters to participate in primaries in Pennsylvania will be enacted.
It is important to promote participation among young voters in general elections, but it is unfair t ask first-time voters to support candidates that they didn’t have a hand in choosing. If we want threshold voters to participate in the general election, it is important that they be allowed to influence the candidate their party nominates. 
These voters are more likely to participate in the general election if they feel that their voice has been heard in the primary, and cultivating an engaged, voting youth is vital to a maintaining a vibrant democracy. 
Allowing threshold voters to participate in their states’ primaries and caucuses will also promote a sense of participation and will allow all first-time voters to have a stake in the candidate their respective party nominates. 
Fostering this sense of involvement in young voters is important, as it produces youth that are politically aware. It has been shown that once a person votes they are more likely to vote again, so ensuring the participation of young voters is critical.
The Pennsylvania primaries are right around the corner, so this issue is in urgent need of attention. The Tartan hopes that Pennsylvania, along with other states who require all voters to be 18 years of age, will realize the importance of youth participation in politics and allow threshold voters to participate in primaries and caucuses.
