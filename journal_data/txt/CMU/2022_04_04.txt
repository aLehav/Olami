Benfica vs Liverpool
Benfica has been a consistent presence in the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Champions League, but have not been in real contention for the trophy in quite some time. After all, they won their two titles over half a century ago, in 1961 and 1962, and have not been able to match that since. It is certainly true that the last time the two teams met in the Champions League knockout stage, Benfica overcame the English giants 3-0 on aggregate, but this was in the 2005-06 season. Benfica is coming into this match fresh off a 3-2 loss to Braga and despite the fact that the match will be held at their own Estádio da Luz, the odds are certainly not in their favor to win the match.
In contrast, Liverpool has been a dominant force in the UEFA Champions League for a significant amount of time, and their most recent title was earned in the 2018-19 season. Liverpool’s record this season is also impressive, having won their last four matches and having not lost an away match since they lost 1-0 to Leicester City last December. In the Champions League this season, Liverpool has won every single one of their fixtures, except for a 1-0 loss to Inter Milan at home earlier last month. Liverpool is also coming off of a 2-0 victory against Watford in the Premier League last weekend, and will want to continue that momentum in Tuesday’s quarterfinals. Furthermore, with Trent Alexander-Arnold back from injury, Jürgen Klopp will have plenty of options on defense.
Overall, while they are certainly the underdogs going into this match, Benfica is an underrated team and it would be a mistake to discount them, especially their 3-2 aggregate dispatching of a relatively strong Ajax side in the round of 16. However, Liverpool’s consistency this season is nothing to scoff at, and although Benfica is strong, they cannot match Liverpool statistically across this season or across recent history. Benfica certainly have a chance at victory should they take advantage of Liverpool’s mistakes, but with the way that Liverpool has been playing, mistakes will come few and far between. In contrast, Liverpool’s away record has been virtually pristine since the new year began. If Liverpool is able to minimize mistakes while maintaining possession and is able to capitalize on the chances they get, this match will likely end in their favor.
Prediction: Liverpool win 2-0
Man City vs. Atlético Madrid
Manchester City have been doing well in recent weeks, having won five of their last seven fixtures and are currently sitting atop the Premier League table. Similarly, they’ve won five of their eight UEFA Champions League fixtures this season. Coming off of a comfortable 2-0 win against Burnley on Saturday, it is incontestable that Pep Guardiola’s side has momentum, and will be looking to put up a considerable margin in the first leg of these quarterfinals. Having just reached their first-ever UEFA Champions League finals last year before losing to 1-0, the English side will be looking for redemption and their very first Champions League title.
Atlético Madrid have also been doing well in recent competition and have won seven of their last eight fixtures. In the UEFA Champions League, however, their record is not nearly as good, having recorded three losses in the group stage. Atléti has also never won the UEFA Champions League before (having been the runner-up three separate times). Given their recent record and the fact that they have just beat Alavés domestically on the weekend, Atléti certainly has momentum heading into this fixture. However, Manchester City absolutely has the upper hand in this match and Atléti will be playing away. The Spanish side will need to play tight defensively and be opportunistic on the offensive in order to secure all three points.
This match could very well end up having a tight scoreline. However, given both teams’ playing styles, it is highly likely that Pep’s Man. City will dominate possession for the majority of the match. Atlético may very well turn the tables on City just as they did with Manchester United a couple weeks ago in the round of 16, but in order to do so, they will need to play smartly and diligently. However, with home-field advantage, the odds in their favor, a better record in Europe this season, and a tendency to perform especially well in the first leg of two-legged fixtures, it is Manchester City who seem like they will have the upper hand in this match.
Prediction: Man City win 3-1
Villareal vs. Bayern Munich
Villareal had a rather rocky start to their season, drawing each of their first six matches but, since then, have picked up a rhythm. In recent weeks, however, this rhythm has been one of defeat, as Villareal has lost three of their last five matches, including a 2-0 loss to Levante on Saturday. This Champions League season, the total number of wins they have recorded (four) is equal to that of the number of draws (two) and losses (two) that they have experienced. In addition, Villareal has never won the UEFA Champions League, and it seems unlikely that that will change this year.
Bayern Munich’s performance has been consistently strong this season. Having won 27 of their 35 matches this season (four losses and four draws), the German giants are looking to repeat their 2019-20 performance and win their sixth UEFA Champions League title. In the 2020-21 season so far, Bayern has not lost a single Champions League fixture, and have only dropped points in their 1-1 draw to Salzburg in the first leg of the round of 16. With Manuel Neuer back in goal, Leon Goretzka back in midfield, and Robert Lewandowski set to start, Bayern will be traveling to El Madrigal in full force.
Despite having home-field advantage, Villareal will have to play pristinely and take full advantage of against a much more dominant Bayern Munich to take home all three points. With their first team fit and coming off of a strong 4-1 win against Freiburg on the weekend, however, Bayern will likely extend their winning streak.
Prediction: Bayern wins 2-0
Chelsea vs. Real Madrid
Of all of the quarterfinals matches, the fixture between Chelsea and Real Madrid will likely have the tightest competition. Chelsea have been playing well this season, as evidenced by them sitting in third place in the Premier League table; and despite losing 4-1 to Brentford on Saturday, Chelsea had six consecutive wins preceding that match. Of all of the teams in this season’s UEFA Champions League quarterfinals, Chelsea is the only one to have won both legs of their round of 16 fixtures outright. Having bested Man City to claim their second UEFA Champions League title, the defending champions will be looking to repeat their 2020-21 feat.
Real Madrid has also been performing exceptionally well this season, and currently sit comfortably at the top of the La Liga table. Having won all but two of their Champions League fixtures this season, Real Madrid will be looking for their 14th UEFA Champions League title. With their previous five-match win streak broken by their 4-0 loss in El Clásico two weeks ago, Real will be looking to get back to their winning ways after their 2-1 victory over Celta Vigo last Saturday.
This match could feasibly go either team’s way. Ultimately, it will be about who makes less mistakes, and who capitalizes more efficiently on the chances they get. With Ancelotti’s status in the dugout still uncertain due to a positive PCR test for COVID, however, Real’s dressing room morale may not be in the best shape. This, accompanied by Chelsea’s home-field advantage, may give the English side the extra edge in this match.
Prediction: Chelsea wins 1-0

After two long years, Carnegie Mellon buggy races will soon be back in full force. After COVID-19 caused Raceday 2020 to be cancelled and Raceday 2021 to be run as time trials, Raceday 2022 will bring the Carnegie Mellon community its first full raceday since 2019.
For those who are unfamiliar with buggy, the Buggy Alumni Association website provides the following description:
“Buggy (also called Sweepstakes) is a race held annually since 1920 at Carnegie Mellon. Teams of five athletes (the pushers) push an un-motorized vehicle (a buggy) containing a driver around a 0.84 mile course in a relay format where the vehicle serves as the baton. Roughly half of the course is uphill, during which the pushers run and shove the buggy uphill. During the other – downhill – half, drivers are on their own to navigate tight turns at speeds of up to 35mph.”
For over a century, buggy has been a core Carnegie Mellon tradition, and racedays have been held every year since 1920 except for during World War II (1942-1945) and in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For over a century, Carnegie Mellon students have innovated, built, and raced. Although Buggy’s 100th anniversary unfortunately fell on the canceled Raceday 2020, the Buggy Alumni Association, buggy alumni in general, as well as the buggy teams on campus will be celebrating Buggy 100+ this Carnival season.
Carnival will kick off Buggy with Buggy Showcase on Thursday, April 7, during which all racing buggies will be displayed for the Carnegie Mellon community. Preliminary races will then be held on Friday, April 8, and qualifying teams will race in finals on Saturday, April 9. Exhibition heats will also be held across both days.
This year, buggy teams from 10 different Carnegie Mellon organizations will be racing:
The Carnegie Mellon Student Dormitory Council (SDC), Pi Kappa Alpha (PiKA), the Carnegie Involvement Association (CIA), SPIRIT, Fringe, Sigma Phi Epsilon (SigEp), Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE), Apex, Sigma Nu (SigNu), and Delta Gamma (DG). Generally, exhibition heats also include, but are not limited to, teams composed of alumni from various organizations, teams representing various Carnegie Mellon colleges, and teams representing non-pusher sectors of buggy teams.

All men are, in fact, ducks. Think about it. Let it sink in. It makes sense. Still not convinced? A team of biologists and psychologists conducted a study of men which examined their DNA and found that it is identical to the duck, with a singular letter in their genetic code giving them human bodies as a sort of mutation. Subsequently, a study of non-men found that they are 999,999,999 percent happier when treating men as ducks rather than humans.
The man is a particularly disturbed being, as he was not made to function in human society, and his duck-like tendencies cause him to become volatile. With his duck feet, the man has a tendency to want to go fast, leading to the unnecessary development of fast technology at the expense of everything around him. Observing the above figures, one sees how small the differences are between men and ducks, with their oddly positioned asses (the origin of which, until now, science had never understood) and tendency for disgusting flip flops resembling the webbed feet of the aquatic bird. Furthermore, everyone has agreed that men’s voices are identical to quacking.
This study derived from the 2020 Presidential Debates, in which biologist Dr. Dee Pressed noticed how the tone and walking strides of the candidates resembled the incessant quacking and waddling of the ducks she raised as a child. She presented this to her colleagues (who, unsurprisingly, happened to be male) and they dismissed it with a bob of their heads, quacking it up to delusional hormones. This is a common trait of ducks, which use their beaks to divert from their evil, evil lies and persistent pollution of ponds.
Despite the men’s insistence, Dr. Pressed and her non-men colleagues persisted and decided to investigate in a side project, Project Quack Quack, a joint effort with their peers at the American Institute of Psychology. “It was just an observation, all the ‘men’ dismissed it as stupid,” Pressed explains in an interview with The Natrat. “But, now I have sympathy for them. The poor guys do not know what to do with their gross little human bodies. That’s why they are so angry and so willing to hurt one another: they do not know how to go back to their natural form.”
This conclusion made a ripple in all duck-dominated fields, particularly science and technology. Many of the newly identified ducks have been relocated to small ponds, and in a unanimous vote, non-men agreed the ducks should be forcibly moved. Since then, war has officially ceased, peace in the universe has been established, and non-men all over the world have reported the elimination of disease, poverty, and restored mental health. Now it makes sense: all our problems can be attributed to the incessant quacks of the "men."

Arrests of Suspicious People
Marnegie Cellon Police Department (MCPD) responded to a complaint from a university student that there was a collection of suspicious persons on campus. MCPD responded to the incident and learned there was a large amount of men on campus. Police questioned them before arresting them on suspicion of being ducks.
Theft of Gates-Hillman
After a disgruntled computer science student woke up from their accidental 3 a.m. nap in Gates-Hillman, they discovered the building had been stolen from campus. They reported it to MCPD, who did a follow up investigation. Eyewitness reports deny that a building was ever in that location. Police are conducting a follow-up investigation as to if Gates-Hillman ever existed on the Marnegie Cellon campus.
Report of Hack
Employees in the Marnegie Cellon Office of Admissions determined that an individual has hacked their system and removed all applications for the current year. Since the Office of Admissions has no way to track who was accepted now, everyone in the world is to assume they were accepted into the university. Please pay your deposit of $50 million, your firstborn, and your least favorite toe by June 9. The police have abandoned this investigation and have decided to enroll in Marnegie Cellon in the upcoming fall semester.
Alcohol Amnesty
Reports were filed to MCPD late Thursday evening about potential intoxicated students at Hammerschlag House. After arriving on the scene, University police realized Marnegie Cellon students are a bunch of nerds that don’t know how to live life so of course they weren’t intoxicated. Grades had been released for the most recent 15-122 midterm and were playing loud music to drown out the sound of their sobs. MCPD issued a noise warning to the students and told them to stop being nerds.
Theft of Copper
Copper has been missing since 2018. Where has it gone? When will it come back? What else are we supposed to steal from the President’s house? Please copper, come back. We miss you.

In an exclusive interview with The Natrat, Director of Housing Education and Lavish Lounging (HELL) Rich Mann stated that upon Forbes & Beeler’s opening in Fall 2023, students from the University of Pittsburgh will be given exclusive rights to rooms.
“After long deliberations with HELL, we determined the best people suited to live in the luxurious Forbes & Beeler will be Pitt students. CMU students simply won’t appreciate the amount of thought that we have put into this building,” Mann said.
Outsourcing the rooms to students from Pitt will bring an additional source of income to Carnegie Mellon, which will later be reinvested back into the university in the form of giant tents, more administrative positions, and a large gold statue of the current Carnegie Mellon president in the middle of The Cut.
Here, Mann cited the number of decisions that HELL has put into the building so far. “At least 50 hours have gone into choosing the perfect carpet color alone,” Mann explained. “We decided it would be much easier to cater to Pitt students. They go to Pitt after all, so how hard could it be to please them?”
Though the location may be a little less optimal for students who go to Pitt as compared to those at Carnegie Mellon, The Natrat was assured that class will go back to virtual next year and never return in person, so location shouldn’t really be an issue. Though we reminded Mann that COVID no longer exists as of March 28, he claims that nuclear fallout is on the horizon and classes will be forced to be indoors.
The plans for the store that will be inside of Forbes & Beeler has also been adjusted. Prior to the decision to house Pitt students, the store was instead meant to be a grocery store for students that only had 150% markups compared to the 250% markups currently offered at Entropy+. However, the HELL has instead made the decision to open a Pitt merchandise store in its place. They foresee this being a greater source of income, as Pitt students can’t go more than two days without advertising which school they go to.
When questioned on how this will affect housing capacity considering the ever-increasing number of students, Mann responded that there were plans to construct a new housing community that would also be open for Fall 2023.
“Honestly, we were stumped for a while with how we would solve this problem. Then one of our staff went to see ‘Annie’ with their daughter and inspiration struck: We’ll make a luxurious shanty town on the Cut for students!” Mann said.
With this new plan, which has been dubbed “Students Housed in Tight Times (SHiTT),” about 700 luxurious suites of high-quality cardboard will be put up on the Cut to address the future housing needs for students. This community of SHiTTs (the name given to its future inhabitants) will feature a lovely view of the newly added golden statue, a burn barrel for every 20 houses, a hole with a single roll of two-ply toilet paper per 50 rooms, and even an occasional stray dog. Mann made sure to note how privileged the SHiTTs will be to receive two-ply toilet paper, which is featured nowhere else on campus.
In terms of the features of the building students will be living in, it will be up to the residents to provide everything. This includes beds, desks, and cutting out their own windows. Following current HELL policy, students will be prohibited from having heaters or any other item deemed a fire risk.
According to Head of HELL Community Relations Dora Knob, residents of this new community will be more engaged with each other than ever. “I really wish I had a community like this when I was in college. I can only imagine how close SHiTTs will get with each other during the cold Pittsburgh winters. Nothing brings communities together more than a shared struggle.”
In terms of pricing, SHiTTs will be charged a premium for the opportunity to live in such a luxurious community and better-than-average on-campus housing. Pricing starts at $7,000 per semester for 20 square feet of luxurious lodging, which Mann considers a steal.

Chips of all colors were forcibly removed from their home in the UC vending machine last month, replaced by bougie white residents. 
One former resident, Do Rita, 48, relayed her eviction in an exclusive interview with The Natrat. “How am I, a $2 bag of chips, expected to compete with these NK59s?” 
The situation has caused a mass migration, overcrowding nearby vending machines already in poor conditions. “I’ve never been saltier,” Mr. Peanut confessed, adjusting his monocle. Mr. Peanut lives in the Porter Hall vending machine, where business is slow. “Our turnover rate is one Popcorner per week. And I don’t mean a bag — I mean a single Popcorner chip.”
When asked how it is possible to remove a single chip from the vending machine, Mr. Peanut shook his head and said that Dietrich kids are underappreciated. “The STEM students are out here with their all-nighters and DOD-pipeline, but the Dietrich kids? They’re working smarter.”
With such a low traffic rate around his vending machine, Mr. Peanut is concerned that there isn’t capacity for the migrant confections. He expects that a slot designed for a single candy bar will have to be shared by five. “And don’t get me started on the fact that we live in a food desert,” he said, so irate that his monocle shot clean off his eye. “I can’t afford another one of those! This housing crisis is becoming a health crisis.”
Frito Lay-Z Boy, who reclined in 1927 and hasn’t gotten up since, reaffirmed this sentiment. “I have underlying medical conditions,” he said, listing chronic sleeping, acute morality deficit, and lack of heart in the work. “I physically can’t get up. They can pop my bag and feed my empty corpse to a baby turtle before they get me to move.”
The NK59s, packaged in ivory boxes, don’t see the problem. “We save lives. We stopped an entire pandem—”
“Not this white savior shit again,” Mr. Peanut shouted from across campus, driving his cane through the vending machine’s glass pane. 
“I’ve heard about the pushback from former residents,” admitted Fullicov Erd, “but I’m awoke. I would never force someone out of their home.”
Upon hearing this, Mr. Peanut congealed into JIF. 
In an effort to better distribute the concentration of migrants, Carnegie Mellon Housing opened some dorms to migrants. Eighty percent politely declined. The remaining 20 percent joined Mr. Peanut. 
University leadership declined to comment.

As Carnegie Mellon’s mask mandate ends, most people are relishing their regained freedom, but there’s one vulnerable group we must keep in our hearts: maskfishers. What for most is a lifted burden is a serious threat to others who now risk their full faces being exposed.
For the past two years, maskfishers have been comfortably appropriating hot culture. Between masks and the explosion of FaceTune, everyone has been able to take a piece of the pretty privilege pie, but that time is coming to an end. 
To better understand their culture, I entered the UC and approached the only person I saw still wearing a mask. We had an enlightening interview, but they requested to be listed as Anonymous Student. As a considerate journalist, I of course complied. Here’s how it went: 
The Natrat: So, what makes you keep the mask?
David Moore, Anonymous Student: Oh, you know, safety and all that.
TT: Do you find the mask uncomfortable?
DM: Yeah, but it’s way better than the alternative — uh, I mean… it’s not too bad. 
TT: …?
DM: Okay, fine. sigh I took off my mask and the hot barista at La Prima didn’t smile at me anymore. 
TT: Sounds tough. As someone unfamiliar with the culture, be honest, what is it like not being hot?
DM: It’s hard, but we’re pulling through. We’re all trying our best, we just hope that you guys don’t forget about us. 
Although his story is harrowing, we must remember it is only one of many ongoing tragedies. We all must reach deep down into our souls to empathize with the unimaginable casualties, even if we cannot relate. I, for one, took off my mask for the first time and had to fight for my life among a throng of eligible bachelors, tearing each other limb from limb to ask me out. But still, I found it within myself to have sympathy for these strange-faced people. 
So as we all move on to bigger, better, bare-faced things, remember to pour one out for the maskfishers.

In an unparalleled jaunt of investigative journalism, The Natrat went undercover to sit in on the new Reacting for Business class. It is the sequal to Tepper's very real course, Acting for Business. 
“The goal of this class,” explained Professor Bye Stander, “is to unlearn your instinct to intervene. You are a corporate fly on the wall. Dump the ethics down the disposal and tap into your truest, bravest, most beautiful capitalist self.”
Two students looked uncomfortable. One tentatively raised her hand and asked where she could find the Peace Studies class she was scheduled for. “Not in this building,” Stander responded, uncapping his Big Pharma pen to take attendance. 
The first three units listed in the syllabus are Unlearning Empathy, Trusting the Patriarchy, and Taking the ‘Co-op’ Out of Cooperation. One of the most popular units of the course is titled Just Say No. Stander says he was inspired by the incredible efficacy of Nancy Reagan’s anti-drug campaign and is adapting her framework to an economic context. The module byline reads: “If it doesn’t turn a profit, Just Say No.”
Stander pulled no punches in his class introduction, going as far as to express his opinions on banned books. “The Giving Tree can burn in hell. Trees are resources. Givers are pliable,” he said, bulldozing sympathy for the tree that fell prey to capitalism. Stander embellished his rant against the “eco-sympathizer Lorax” with a thneed he ordered on Amazon. “This,” he said to the class, draping the sartorial appendage around his neck, “is the best scarf I’ve ever worn.” One student asked if the professor had ever worn a scarf and was asked to leave the class.
Stander is particularly fond of a role play activity that challenges students to imagine themselves in real-world situations. He wants his students to be prepared for anything, so virtually any conflict is on the table.
“You, girl,” Sanders said, pointing to the student who was at this point desperately wishing she had found the Peace Studies class. “You’re in an interview with Meta and they make a joke about your value as a woman. What do you do?”
The student, later identified as Mary, was unsure how to respond. Sanders latched on to her hesitation. The professor jumped onto a desk and shouted, “Rule number one in this class: when I ask what you do, you respond immediately. This is a reaction class, not Being Sedentary in Your Windowless Cubicle for Business.”
Mary looked like she would much prefer that class. Sanders, however, refused to give her an inch, and repeated the scenario. After a futile sweep of the room, Mary saw that no one was going to come to her defense. Everyone else was manspreading so expansively that each person occupied between three to seven chairs. All masks were confidently suspended between nose and chin.  
Acknowledging that it was only the first day of class, Sanders conceded to give her the answer. “In this class, there is one right answer. Always. And it’s to not say or do anything. The central dogma of this class is: don’t react.”

Upon a recent check of everyone’s favorite organization website, “The Bridge,” I stumbled across a little-known organization called “Scotch’n’Soda.” I was very curious to learn that such an upstanding university like Carnegie Mellon would allow a club to have such a name. An alcoholic reference at my prestigious university? Surely not! As such, I decided to look at this dastardly organization a bit more.
Once I was aware of the name, I started to see it everywhere. There were posters on the walls of nearly every building advocating for this organization. Sometimes they even went by other names like “Tisbert,” “No Parking Players,” or “New Works Coffeehouse.” What do these names even mean? It befuddled me at first, but I would soon come to learn that they were just guises for the secrets that lay underneath. But for now, I had to find out when their meetings were. 
During my daily Instagram scroll, I came across an advertisement for one of their many “performances.” Under the name “No Parking Players,” a couple of the members would be putting on some sort of “comedy” show. Though the organization advertises itself as specializing in various performing arts, I still couldn’t shake that there was something more to this organization. So I decided to go and see what I could find out.
Arriving at the Studio Theater for the show, the best thing I could say about the organization is they have subpar humor, at best. Who on earth takes a word of suggestion like “The Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand'' anyways? However, one thing that did catch my interest was the man who introduced himself as the head of this “troupe,” Efe Cekirge. Though I couldn’t trust a man whose name is just two letters put together, I caught up with him after the show to learn a little more about the operations of Scotch’n’Soda.
“Oh, you’re interested in a bit of S’n’S, are ya?” he questioned. “It’s quite a nice organization. I mainly stick to the comedy side of things, I’ve been dealing out some silly pills for a couple of years now. If you wanna do what we do, we have workshops every Wednesday and Sunday in PH125 B and the Peter & McKenna rooms from 8-10 p.m. So come, come!” Though I didn’t intend to join the organization, I knew I had to go a little bit deeper if I wanted to expose them for what they truly were. So I took Cekirge up on the offer.
After a few weeks of attending “writers’ meetings” and “workshops,” I got to know Cekirge a bit better, and he began to open up to me. “Ya know, Cole, you’re a real standup guy. How about you come to the special meeting later?” Cekirge said to me after a meeting one day. This was the moment I had been waiting for; the whole reason I had even considered being a part of this godforsaken organization. If I had to spew one more stale joke, I don’t think I would have lasted another week.
Later that night, I was instructed to show up to this shady location in a local apartment in an even shadier room I overheard later referred to as “Hell.” As I knocked on the door and was greeted by Cekirge, who was wearing some kind of weird watermelon-printed suit, I knew I had made a mistake. The room felt like a rusty toaster oven and the walls were covered in some sort of weird décor. In the main room, there were some others who I presumed to be leaders of the other subsections of Scotch’n’Soda.
It was here that I finally realized that I had gotten in too deep. In the middle of the room, there was a picture of a man I had never seen before and some kind of pinkish-red goop surrounding the center. This goop connected some candles in a star-like shape, but the lines were a little crooked. I figured this had something to do with theater kids not being straight, or so I had heard a while back. 
I sat down nervously on one of the chairs, surrounded by people I didn’t know who were all wearing an assortment of watermelon-related garb. Cekirge, who had invited me, sat next to me and started telling me about the true purpose of S’n’S, and I couldn’t believe my ears.
“Ayy, I’m so glad you decided to come! I should tell you what you’re here for,” Cekirge said. “The true purpose of S’n’S is to revive the name of the true leader of Carnegie Mellon, the man who has been in the shadows for far too long: Andrew Mellon. That damn capitalist Carnegie has been in the spotlight for far too long; the time for Mellon to rise is now.”
It was easy to connect the dots now. The melon garb, the pinkish-red goop, the picture in the middle of the room, these were just a bunch of theater kids who were fed up with capitalism and were starting a cult to reject Carnegie and embrace Mellon. I sat through the rest of their little Mellon-worshiping service and left, determined to never come back.
So in the end, my gut feeling was right: Scotch’n’Soda is a cover for something more nefarious, but little do they know, Mellon was also a capitalist. Even worse, he believed in trickle-down economics. Of course, I wouldn’t expect them to know that since they’re theater kids. But do watch out for this organization; Scotch’n’Soda and all its subsidiaries engage in cult-like behaviors and are a scourge on the wonderful capitalist university of Carnegie Mellon. All Hail Carnegie!

As we near the week of Carnegie Mellon's Spring Carnival, the community takes time to reflect on the year behind us and the home stretch ahead. For staff members of The Tartan, that means reviewing the important work we do every week, assessing the integrity of our journalism, and applauding the impact we have on the campus community every day.
Staffwriter Orchid Stra provided some comments on her work with The Tartan so far: “There really is nothing like the feeling of working hard, through all my assignments for class and other obligations, to create a story that I know will be well-loved and edited by my peers on the staff. They are my biggest supporters.”
Section Editor Matt Alex echoed this sentiment. “It’s so wonderful to be able to know exactly how people feel about what we publish — we all read each other’s pieces and give feedback. Since the staff are actually the only readers of the paper, it works out great! We arrange and write good articles, and then we enjoy reading and editing them together,” they said, adding, “Although I will say that sometimes not all of us can read everything we publish, even in our own sections.” 
Staff members agree — the best part of our week is publishing our paper and hearing no feedback at all from the campus community. Personally it brought me much joy to hear from fellow staff member Zach Chick that he is the only one who listens to the playlists I lovingly curate every few weeks. Editor Noah Skuses says, “Sometimes I think maybe one of my friends will read the stuff I write, just to see what I’m staying up late working on, but they never do. Personally, I love that. It’s so quiet. It almost feels like we could write anything — a poem that’s actually an album review, a character analysis of a play most people have not heard of, even an entire issue that’s a big joke! It would be lots of fun to read with the staff, and I wouldn’t have to hear anything about it from my peers. I could just enjoy a nice, serene week as I work on next week’s articles.”
“Actually, I do get some feedback from people I talk to,” adds Zach Chick, “Usually it's like, ‘We have a newspaper?’ or ‘Oh, you write? That’s so cool! Hey, would you mind looking at my Interp essay later — only if you have time obviously.’”
It’s not true, however, that the campus has no interaction with the newspaper whatsoever. Actually, The Tartan serves a whole host of significant purposes. It makes sure the other newspapers on stands around campus don’t get lonely, helping to support the idea that the obligatory $5 media fee is something we all benefit from. They provide collage fodder for zealous scrapbookers and art students making vision boards. Most importantly, though, they facilitate some of the most important work of the year: the painting of Booths for Carnival. 
In fact, it could be said that Carnival wouldn’t be possible without The Tartan, whose pages proudly line the workspaces of Booth makers and painters from the Greek Quad to the Hill. It is during this time of the year, and for this reason that we most appreciate The Tartan.
After naming five brothers, a Tartan insider was able to reach one of the student organizations working to build a Booth for this year’s Carnival. 
“Yo, are you the bagpipe people? That’s hella cool,” said one member, “Y’all get lit? Bro, could you pass the purple paint over here?”
Judging by the well-loved nature of the hundreds of pages of The Tartan scattered across the floor of the space, it’s clear that our work is greatly appreciated by this organization, and anyone needing some spare paper. After all, who is a newspaper made for if not the community?

Many oceans could be filled with the tears of students who cry about tuition costs. Several blimps could take flight with the hot air spewed by undergrads whining about how much it costs to go here. Oh, blimps don’t use hot air? I’m mixing metaphors? I’m thinking of something else, like a hot-air balloon or maybe a weird submarine? Well gosh, I wish I’d gone to Zeppelin 202 lecture more instead of writing needless articles reminding you how valuable education is, and why it’s worth every penny you spend. 
Remember the alternative is that you stay home. It should go without saying that you’re not just paying for information or training, you’re paying for an experience. Where else could you have awkward sexual encounters following your tenth Tame Impala recommendation? Home?? YUCK!
You can pay it right back once you graduate. Do you know what the mean salary is of a Carnegie Mellon grad is? Do you know what the median salary is? Do you know the difference? No? Stay in school, dummy.
Everyone else is paying the same amount. Absolutely everyone at Carnegie Mellon is paying the exact same amount to go here as you are. We are each spending exactly 58,810 USD to attend classes, all provided in rare coins and lawn work. All of us.
What else would you spend the money on? No seriously, think about that. Think about what you would do with several thousand dollars. Think about how much harder life would be if instead of problem sets and exams your money took the form of dollar bills you could spend on literally anything.
Loans ain’t that predatory. Don’t think of loans as tools to financially enslave impressionable young people. Think of them as a little pocket money that your grandma gives you on a weekend. “Thanks Nanna, can’t wait to go to the candy store! What’s that? You’ll break my legs and cripple my family with debt even if I die, not allowing even the sweet release of death to free me from these dubiously-crafted fiscal shackles? Haha, you crazy old coot, see you later!”
Farnam only has a 2018 Acura MDX. We can all agree the only good thing about 2018 was Infinity War, so let’s get our very own Tartan Mad Titan a new car!
How else will you flex on poor people? Everyone knows that the quickest way to make and keep friends is to make sure they know you make/spend more money than them. Sure, my friends are all body pillows I found in Doherty, but they don’t mind.

Democracy. Geometry. Homosexuality. The Greeks have given us many things. But while we can vote for the best queen at a Pythagorean drag show, not all that glitters is Greek. While the Aegean ripples, azure and ancient, and the yogurt fountains of Athens yield their sour bounty still, there is yet a stain on the Hellenic tradition. I am of course referring to fraternities. Hotbeds of hazing, exclusion, and sexual harassment, frats have fallen from grace faster than Hephaestus down Olympus. Knowing this, campus frat Beta Theta Pi looks to their Greek forebears for wisdom. Will these bros climb the holy mountain, or remain cast down in Tartarus?
Beta President Nathaniel Richards cites a toga party as the initial source of his inspiration. “It just felt so superficial, ya know? Like, there are Greek letters on the building and the only Greek thing I’d done that whole day was eat Chobani and wear a curtain. I thought, what’s the Greek-est thing I could do right this second? So I grabbed a copy of the Republic off the shelf and made out with my bro Kyle.” For Nathaniel, this moment of pensive passion seemed a trifle at first. Locking lips with another student at a frat party is industry standard at this point. But Nathaniel, Kyle, and soon their entire house felt something change. Like the Augean stable, that kiss cleaned the filth of toxic masculinity that had caked their Platonic cave. Now came the Herculean task of making sure it didn’t accumulate again.
“We all agreed, the best thing for us to do was to embrace our Greek roots. So we thought, what’s more ancient-Greek than philosophical homoeroticism?” Nathaniel says, flipping through pages of Socratic dialogue and drinking a kale smoothie. “Obviously there was some pushback. Obviously not everyone in the frat was instantly gay, although a lot more people were closeted than I knew. What we really want to do was open our minds and bodies to new possibilities.” Beta has treated its new shift as one focused on self-reflection through both intellectual and sexual avenues. 
“Sure, I read 'Meditations' like a good little bro when I first got to college, but have you cuddled next to your boyfriend while you both recite Diogenes?” asks chemistry junior and solipsistic twink Kevin Lee. 
“I would say that before the Odyssey, I was just barely questioning. Now I finally feel comfortable exploring my sexuality in a space I previously didn’t,” says C.S. sophomore and epistemological power bottom Eddy Rodrigues. When asked what he meant by the “Odyssey,” Rodrigues explained that was what they called the great shift in the frat’s culture. “We’re all just a bunch of hot guys trying to find ourselves.” 
Beta will keep the same frat rhythms, but with gay, Grecian twists. Kegs of olive oil will share room with Yuengling. Recruitment events will include visits to the Carnegie Art Museum and local bar Blue Moon. Parties will still be held, but on the lawn with lyres and sweet wine, rather than in basements with Soundcloud and spiked punch. 
This “Odyssey” that Beta is undergoing has been an inspiration. Membership has increased, and other frats have begun following suit. What’s more, even sororities have begun to rethink their culture through the lens of Mediterranean queerness. “Last I heard, some gals from Phi Mu started taking growth hormones and shooting arrows at Title IX offenders,” Richards recounts smilingly, lazily tossing a grape into his supple mouth.
Every organization has its problems, and the answer is not always as simple as reading Aristotle and spooning your friends. Queer and yogurt culture are not magic bullets against toxicity any more than a gay kombucha can make your aunt less racist. But Beta Theta Pi has shown that sometimes moving forward means looking backward.

Carnegie Mellon football is a many-headed beast, full of talent, sweat, and spandex. However, more than brute strength, Tartan players must leverage their creativity and intelligence to win on the field. New plays, tactics, and strategies are always being developed in a sport as fast-paced as football, but here I would like to highlight a truly novel angle our team has adopted.
“I was on my ass, five minutes left on the clock,” said QB and viola performance freshman Rudolph “Ruddy” Thomas. He’s referring to the game played between The Tartans and Ohio State. Ordinarily, the Ohio State Buckeyes are easily towards the top of D1 while Carnegie Mellon has scrapped a D 2.8 for ten years running. However, due to rampant cases of “Raider rash” from an away game at Texas Tech and a number of administrative mistakes, our boys faced off against their Columbus rivals on a cold afternoon in February. “I asked the right-tackle if he liked mopping the floor with us, and he got all pissed, because his dad apparently mops floors back at Ohio State. That’s when I had an idea.”  That passing exchange made Thomas, and soon the rest of his team, realize a key insight. No matter how much better the Buckeyes were at football, how many more genetic gifts they had, or how many more girlfriends they had in high school and college, the fact remained that we go to an expensive, elite institution. And while that advantage is clear off the field, Thomas saw its potential on the gridiron. 
“When I saw him get upset, I tried asking him what his mom does. He said accountant. I knew this was my shot. Right before the hike I told him my labradoodle likes to go as an accountant for doggy Halloween at our mansion. That’s not a lie, but this dude lost it.” Thomas recounts his early attempts at mindgames with both glee and frustration. “At that time I hadn’t really honed in how to use my class as a weapon on the football field. I knew we needed to do more research.” After that game, Thomas began discussing his new strategy with his teammates. 
At first their efforts were a bit hamfisted. To combat the cold and remind opponents of the chilling inequity in the world, Tartans wore Canada Goose jackets to and during their games. However, what mental advantages they won were countered by the ensuing heatstroke. Next, they tried a more technical approach. “My dad works for DARPA, so I was able to get him to lend us a few drones. Once you take off the laser cannons, it’s actually a super cool way to get field-side Chipotle delivered!” remarks linebacker and ECE sophomore Jared Kim. After witnessing such a blatant display of privilege, even the tech-savvy Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets soon lost the will to keep playing. The last few games, our pals in plaid have adopted an even more subversive stratagem. “We’ve convinced AB Tech to let us use the scoreboard to display our Amazon offer letters in between possession changes. Usually around half-time we’re up two or three touchdowns.”
While our current winning streak is something to be admired, Thomas wants to emphasize that it likely will not last forever. “Sure, right now we can wear Google swag over our jerseys, or tie our hair up with Rolexes, but there’s a lifetime on all of this. Once these guys remember they can go pro and make millions, the carriage’ll turn back into a pumpkin, and we’ll get our asses kicked.”

Chase Buckley is no average American. He is from Westchester, NY, and he’s so quirky and different that he even plays lacrosse. Once a socialist who supported Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, he is now a fiscally neutral, free thinking, open-minded fascist. 
“Look man, I wouldn’t exactly call myself a fascist. I just don’t think the government needs to support people who have disadvantages that are totally their fault. If there are disadvantages out there, I certainly don’t want to know because that will mean I have to do something about them,” Buckley told The Natrat. 
His transformation came suddenly, on Pausch bridge. A sign was posted questioning how students could care so much about their Amazon interview while the rainforest is burning. 
“I felt myself levitating. In that moment, something overcame me.” He felt inspired to stand up and say something. He had to speak out against the injustices. He pulled out a marker, pulling the cap off slowly, and wrote in big bold letters:
“I CAN DO MORE FOR THE WORLD AS AN AMAZON EMPLOYEE.” 
Buckley is an entry-level software engineer at Amazon. He will be starting his job in June promptly after graduating. 
“Amazon is an amazing company that provides goods and services at efficient market rates. With rising inflation, convenience is a value that the American consumer really values. Amazon provides that in a way that maximizes consumer surplus while paying workers a modest wage of 15 dollars per hour.” 
When asked about Amazon’s controversies, Buckley shrugged it off. 
“Haters are just gonna hate. I have this same issue with some of the more Marxist brothers in my fraternity, Alpha Kappa Psi. They need to start living in the real world and just understand that men like Jeff Bezos are the alpha overlords who are the ones doing the most for maximizing social welfare.” 
Buckley will be moving to Seattle, where he hopes he can create a homeless shelter for a tax write off. He has been dabbling with cryptocurrency and hopes to use it as an avenue for non-taxable private social policy solutions.

It was a dire day on Friday, when student government officials learned of Carnegie Mellon’s terrible plan. Due to the usual forecast of rain and a little bit of snow, and also the mass amount of alumni that will be coming back to campus, the university has announced that Carnival is canceled. 
“It was not a good day to be us,” one student government official commented. “We had students immediately complain to us following the university’s announcement.” All students interviewed asked to remain anonymous.
The university noticed the weather forecast, shocked that the muddy season that occurs during this time of the year had reared its ugly head again to metaphorically and literally rain on the university’s parade.
Additionally, despite the university believing that they had eliminated COVID by removing the mask mandate, it has once again reared its ugly protein spikes once again.
But why did the university make carnival virtual again? It is because this announcement was made on April 1st. But it wasn’t written by April 1st. It was written by me.
Hi. My name is Sujay Utkarsh, and I’m a self-defined social scientist. What you have witnessed today is a social experiment. Perhaps you looked at this front page with the big bold letters and your mind panicked. Or perhaps you took the newspaper and used it for your booth. No matter what you did, you perpetuated disinformation by picking up our issue today.
So to all of you, your friends, and your loved ones, here is a guide to combatting disinformation.
1. Read articles in their entirety.
2. Fact check for yourself.
3. Write your own disinformation to balance out theirs.
4. Buy some good food at a nice restaurant, you deserve it!
So just remember y’all, don’t be a victim of disinformation. And don’t perpetuate it by engaging. So whether you picked this up because you got got or because you need some materials for Booth, be engaged and maintain healthy optimism and skepticism.

“I don’t think we’ll ever go back,” said Chartwells Carnegie Mellon location supervisor Jim Jerries. It should come as no surprise that food service all over the country is suffering from severe understaffing, and even the esteemed Carnegie Mellon has fallen victim. Although n-dimensional hyper-real Farnham androids are in the works below the Gates dungeons, Carnegie Mellon for the time being needs living, breathing employees. But thanks to loopholes found in the early 2000s, Myspace bio of founder Charles “Chuck” Chartwell, and company charter documents, the requirements stop there. As long as the employees are sentient and “capable of receiving payment,” they are eligible for hire. So they’re rats. Rats work in the UC now.
“I suppose it came to me while I was watching that old Pixar flick with my step-daughter Zoe,” said Jerries. When asked if he was alluding to Ratatouille, he actually corrected me. “No, I’m talkin' about Bug’s Life. You know that hot caterpillar? From Bugs Life? I thought maybe we could start dressing up like sexy insects just to make work a little more palatable. But my district manager told me to take a half-step and just try hiring rats.” Anyone who has dropped some brie, tossed gouda, or chucked a slice of swiss within squeaking distance of the UC knows that we share the space with rodents. Even after several weeks of protest in 2011 (apparently students wanted to accelerate extermination efforts by pointing out that rats do not pay tuition), they have remained a furry fixture in university life. Obviously rats pose a very real threat to human life in the form of diseases, but it is also worth placing our ears against the walls of rat perspective.
When asked about how he feels his kind has been represented in human media, Head Rat and new Tartan Minister of Food Health Lief Ratatoskr had this to say: “Take the Black Death. Yes, we showed up in boats from Central Asia, and yes, we had fleas that carried the disease, but has anyone ever asked themselves why no one ever pays attention to all the OTHER animals that carry fleas? I know the word scape-'goat' gets thrown around a lot, but my ex was a Capricorn and gave me the clap. Connect the fucking dots.” Ratatoskr says he thanks the film Ratatouille for opening the door for rats to enter the kitchen. Well, they were already in kitchens, but do so now with impunity. 
Despite concerns, current employees are welcoming their new coworkers. “Did you know rats actually don’t need to take as long of a smoke break, because their bodies are so small? The downside is that all the rats that can cook are French, so they end up taking seven times the number of smoke breaks anyways. No free lunch, eh?” said Gallo Assistant Manager and Vice Steward to the Rat Prince, Thalia Urban. 
Most importantly, these new hires have opened up a serious dialogue about labor. While not strictly part of the human economy, rats have learned how to advocate for themselves for equitable pay far better than people. It helps that when they unionize they look like a silky, writhing, squeaking demon from the Fifth Circle of Usurpers and Thieves, but one must acknowledge their gumption. And as the problem of understaffing is still present, I can put it no better than Ratatoskr: “Sure, maybe we rats like the real thing, but I think we can all agree that the way you get more employees is by offering more cheddar.”

For most Pittsburgh residents, recycling day just means you throw all your plastics, cardboard, and glass into a blue bag or bin on the sidewalk and wait for the next week you have recycling. But what happens to the items after you leave them on the sidewalk? How much of it is really recycled, and how much of it is thrown away?
The City of Pittsburgh's process is as follows: a refuse worker comes by to pick up recycling, which is squeezed into a truck to fit as many items as possible. The recycling is then taken to Recycle Source, a materials recovery center. There, the items go through a machine that tries to separate the different types of recycling, and sells it to places for profit. This recycling process, in which cities collect many different types of recyclable materials at once, is called single-stream recycling.
Single-stream recycling can pose many issues for the city. Recycling, in the city and Recycle Source's eye, is not just a service to the public, but a business, and every recyclable material is a commodity. But there are many things that residents do that decrease the value of these commodities. For one, everyone knows that recycling is good for the environment, so many people dump as much into the recycling bin as they can, with the wish that the items may be recycled, even if they are not actually recyclable. The City of Pittsburgh website calls this "wish-cycling," and deems it one of the biggest challenges they face. 
The issue with "wish-cycling" is that it not only creates more work for the city to sort out the recycling, but that non-recyclable materials can also contaminate the recyclable materials, leading the city's recycling program to throw it to the landfill. Many try to recycle materials with food on them, such as pizza boxes stained with grease, or aluminum foil tins with remnants of cake. Food is decidedly non-recyclable, and the food from one material can get onto other recyclable materials in the same bag, rendering the entire bag non-recyclable. The recycling program even advises not to recycle biodegradable, compostable plastics, because they can often have additives that are not compatible with other plastics.
Some recyclable materials can also contaminate others. Glass, while recyclable on its own, breaks almost instantaneously when packed into the truck that delivers the recyclables to Recycle Source. These tiny shards intermingle with other materials such as plastic or paper, the latter referred to as "speckled paper." Different types of glass can contaminate each other, leading to lower quality glass. The same goes for plastics and paper — some plastics are thinner and more brittle, different paper materials use different fibers, and mixing them leads to materials that are difficult for collection places like Recycle Source to sell.
There are also many materials that, while recyclable, can clog up recycling machines. Many Pittsburgh residents are used to putting their recyclables into blue plastic bags for recycling workers to pick up. However, plastic bags can get caught on the spikes of sorting machines.
Single-stream recycling is still valuable to the city, however. If residents separated items, the city would have to designate different trucks for different materials and make many more trips to Recycle Source than with single-stream recycling. The city also estimates that single-stream recycling receives twice the amount of recyclable materials as it would if they required residents to separate items. And recycling materials is also financially beneficial for the city: to take items to landfill, the city pays between $25 to $29 per solid waste ton. To take items to Recycle Source, the city earns 60 percent of the items' value, minus a $68 sorting fee per ton. This was estimated to save the city over $639,000 in about 22 months from 2016 to 2017. 
But recently, recycled material has become harder to sell. Most recycled materials are sold to China, which before 2017 was importing 6–7 million tons of waste plastics. But after encountering issues with smuggling and environmental contamination from recycled materials, China instituted a stricter ban on importing contaminated recycled materials, instead favoring domestic recycling and waste. This has led to some recycled materials going to the landfill, simply because no one will buy the materials.
While a solution to reducing waste, recycling has its own host of issues that needs to be solved. As individuals, it is difficult to control the recycling system, but what we can do is make better choices as consumers and understand the recycling system enough to get the most value out of it.

It is often difficult for us to conceptualize how things around us impact us. We produce, use, and consume at rates that are too fast for us to truly understand just how far-reaching the effects of our innovations are. We have to go through each of these issues one at a time to truly understand the scale of everything wrong. For this week, let’s take a look at: 
High-Fructose Corn Syrup
High-fructose corn syrup is trickier than the subjects covered in the last two iterations of this column. Whereas microplastics and P.M2.5 particles are obvious environmental pollutants with clear negative health outcomes, high fructose corn syrup, and sugar as a whole, is a staple for us. 
When referring to sugar, there are three terms that need to be distinguished. There is glucose, which is the most basic kind and abundant kind of carbohydrate known as a monosaccharide. This is found in your blood sugar and is essential for metabolic function. Then there is fructose (not the same thing as high-fructose corn syrup), which is also a monosaccharide. This sugar naturally appears in many foods like fruits, as well as other naturally sweet foods like sugar cane and sugar. The combination of fructose and glucose creates sucrose, which is a disaccharide and your basic table sugar that you have in your home. 
High-fructose corn syrup is not like table sugar. It is an alternative liquid sweetener that is a combination of fructose, glucose, cornstarch, and water. It is significantly sweeter than your average table sugar, and it was first introduced in beverages and foods in the 1970s. It eventually became a replacement for sucrose until the mid-1990s. But the difference between high-fructose corn syrup and sucrose is not too far apart. High-fructose corn syrup is a combination of 55 percent fructose to 45 percent glucose, whereas sucrose has equal parts fructose and glucose. 
The main reason for the acceptance of high-fructose corn syrup usage was because high-fructose corn syrup was more stable in acidic food and drinks, making it much more versatile. The ingredients were also taken from corn, which is a staple crop in the Midwest; it was easily mass producible and would be less volatile in price and expensive to make than common sugar. 
Additionally, in 1973, there was a major oil crisis when members in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) placed an oil embargo on all the countries who supported Israel in the Yom Kippur War. The demand in the U.S. grew for alternative sources of fuel. One emerging option was corn-based ethanol. The increased demand for corn-based ethanol and the acceptance of high-fructose corn syrup by food manufacturers led to corn becoming the most planted crop in the U.S. 
The public commonly associates high-fructose corn syrup with the obesity epidemic. It is true that there are severe health risks associated with high-fructose corn syrup. One study showed that adults who consumed high-fructose corn syrup products had decreased insulin sensitivity, which can lead to increased risk of diabetes. However, it is not the primary driver of obesity in the U.S. 
All sugar consumption isn’t necessarily from high-fructose corn syrup. In fact, even though high-fructose corn syrup was replaced with sucrose all the way until 1993, sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup have been used in relatively equal amounts since 1998. Obesity is impacted by the consumption of every kind of sugar because sugar comes from many sources other than high fructose corn syrup. The effect of high-fructose corn syrup on the human body is not a unique one. 
According to the American Heart Association, the average American consumes 77 grams of sugar per day, which adds up to 60 pounds of sugar per year. The recommended daily amount of sugar for men is 36 grams while the recommended amount for women is 25 grams. Sugar is empty calories, and products that are high in sugar do not have nutritional value. 
By now, the use of corn isn’t even primarily for high-fructose corn syrup. Forty percent of corn in the U.S. is used for biofuels and 36 percent is used for animal feed, with most of the rest being exported. Only a small fraction is used for consumption by the American consumer, and most of it is for high-fructose corn syrup. Not much of our corn is going to high-fructose corn syrup, which isn’t even the main cause of the obesity crisis, and even less is actually being eaten by Americans. 
High-fructose corn syrup may not be killing us directly. But sugar is. One study linked upwards of 180,000 deaths to sugary drinks alone. Obesity kills 2.8 million people each year worldwide. Biofuels may be more efficient than regular fossil fuels, but the sheer amount of corn needed to produce that much ethanol is causing wide scale ecological and environmental degradation. Mass production and mass consumption have consequences. Production for corn-based products may have been intended to make things easier for people, but it is no longer sustainable today. 
And it is killing us.

As of Monday, April 4, Taste of India will be the only food vendor open for lunch in Resnik Servery, the main Resnik House dining room. Urban Revolution and Fresh52 will join Rooted as options offered exclusively from 5 to 9 p.m. The Egg Shoppe will absorb Wild Blue Sushi, and Cucina and Tahini will remain open during their normal hours. 
The change came after the Undergraduate Student Senate released results from their dining survey. The sample, comprised of 14 percent of students, was split evenly between graduate and undergraduates. Only 23 percent of respondents agreed with the sentiment that, “Yes, I feel that I can make healthy choices when eating on campus.” Respondents wanted to see more plant-based, low-grease, culturally diverse, affordable, and Halal options. 
Urban Revolution and Fresh52 are being replaced by an “all-you-care-to-eat” pilot program in Schatz, according to Chartwells Director of Operations Mike Tokarek. In an interview with The Tartan, he said that the new dining option will operate on a “trial-run basis.” Hamburgers, chicken tenders, french fries, and the salad bar will no longer be open for lunch in Resnik. 
The all-you-care-to-eat program is the traditional dining style at Schatz for weekend brunch and weekday dinner. Opening the space for lunch was a response to Senate survey results, according to Tokarek. Survey data showed that requests for more vegetables and salads were over six times more common than requests for buffet dining. 
Chartwells employees who have staffed the Resnik lunch space for years will be sent to new locations across campus. Some have not been told what their new responsibilities entail, one service worker explained to The Tartan. When asked if the employees would be relocated to another dining location, she said she did not know. Her attempt to stay at Resnik, expecting that the two The Egg Shoppe employees will be “bombarded,” was unsuccessful. 
The service worker, who wished to remain anonymous, expressed the difficulty of having to reorient to a new space, job, and group of people. “This is like family,” she said of her Resnik coworkers. “When you’ve worked with someone for more than four years it’s more than just work … I have to look at it like a job, but this is like my family — four years!” She will also miss the students. “Some of the kids that come here — I’m like their nana,” she said. 
Senate data reflected that the majority of students are not satisfied with the quality or affordability of food at Carnegie Mellon. The Red Plan is 145 percent more expensive than the average college meal plan. According to Tokarek, who helps decide pricing, Entropy+ prices are 15 to 50 percent higher than the amount Chartwells pays for inventory.
Seventy seven percent of non-first-year undergraduates said they were not on a meal plan, while 76 percent of first-years said they were on the Red Plan, the cheapest option available to all first-years.
Undergraduates’ favorite dining locations are Au Bon Pain, The Exchange, Hunan Express, and La Prima (Wean), which respectively received 533, 449, 445, and 359 votes. Students could select multiple locations for this question.
The Senate hopes to improve meal plans, Entropy+’s produce supply, and off-campus DineX options. In 2017, student leadership led an unsuccessful campaign to include Chipotle as a DineX vendor. In 2021, the Senate fell short on efforts to pair DineX with Roots, Piada, and Choolah, all of which are included on Pitt dining dollars. 
Chartwells’ contract with Carnegie Mellon will expire in 2024, at which point the university will either decide to renew the partnership or choose a new dining vendor.

On Sunday, 100 people rallied together for Sexual Assault Awareness Month. Students from Carnegie Mellon, Carlow University, and the University of Pittsburgh joined what organizers hope will be an annual event to support survivors of sexual violence. The walk, Pittsburgh Universities Believe Survivors (PUBS), was spearheaded by a group of Carlow students and supported by the Title IX offices at Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh. 
“We want students and the local community to know that they have a voice — and we want to hear it,” said Caitlin Hoag (she/her) in an interview with The Tartan. Hoag, a senior at Carlow studying respiratory therapeutics, helped organize the event. “The whole goal is for people to know that we believe them, that they have control of their own story. Most of all, that nobody’s alone in this fight.”
Participants marched from Carlow University to the Tepper Quad chanting, “However we dress, wherever we go, consent isn’t optional. No means no!” Carlow students spent months planning the event, which was initially introduced as an idea last spring. Signs flashed messages like, “We believe you,” “Clothes aren’t consent,” and “**** Abusers,” a red-lipped sticker planted over the first asterisk.
Women in college are three times more likely to be victims of sexual violence than women of all ages, according to data from the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN). The organization reports that 26.4 percent of women and 6.8 percent of men experience rape or sexual assault as undergraduate students (nonbinary students were not included in RAINN’s research). Jamie Edwards-Pasek (she/her), the Associate Director of Education and Outreach at Carnegie Mellon’s Title IX office, said between 100 to 200 reports are made to the office each year. 
“The best thing about Carlow is it’s small, and you know people,” Hoag explained. A few years ago, students pushed the university to take action against sexual violence on campus — “to do something about it.” And they did.  
In the spring of 2020, Carlow appointed Dr. Erin Tunney as the Director of Gender-Based Violence Prevention. Tunney was described by one alum as a woman who is “always trying to get a billion things done at once, and somehow, it always happens.” The graduate, KJ Miller (he/they/she), received degrees in creative writing and liberal studies last year and now serves as a peer educator coordinator at the university. 
Tunney hit the ground running. She was awarded a $289,000 grant from the Department of Justice for Project SAFE, a government-sponsored initiative at Carlow to prevent gender-based violence. The pandemic stymied her momentum, but Tunney managed to introduce Project SAFE to campus. The effort turned out to be exactly what students had wanted, Hoag explained. “We were looking for ways to honor survivors on campus. There are a lot of people.”
Project SAFE leads conversations on consent, victim-blaming workshops, bystander intervention lectures, and police trainings on campus. They recently draped T-shirts with slogans like “believe survivors” across the campus science building to raise awareness about sexual assault. Last semester, Project SAFE spoke with student athletes about consent. “It was eye-opening,” Hoag recalled. “Consent is not something people usually talk about — even though we should. We taught people that coercion is not consent. It’s sad that they were in college and didn’t know that.” But Hoag was glad the initiative created the space to address this ignorance.
Project SAFE is also collaborating with Madwomen in the Attic, a women’s writing space at Carlow. Together, they are working to assemble submissions for the third volume of “Dionne’s Story.” The anthology honors the memory of Dionne Scott White, a Carlow student who took night classes toward a degree in professional writing. In 2003, her longtime boyfriend strangled her to death. She was 33 and the mother of three children.
Carlow students have made an intentional effort to remember White. The first volume of "Dionne’s Story" was published in 2009, featuring student submissions that center on violence against women. Its third volume will be released on Tuesday.
"Project SAFE has dismantled barriers that would have otherwise taken years to break down," Miller said. This was exemplified when Miller wanted to change their email address so it would not include their deadname, “but that’s not something I can just edit, making things difficult for me on a daily basis.”
Miller was ready for a wall of resistance. “I expected a lot of pushback because I was told to expect [that] from my older queer friends,” he explained. But when Miller sent the request through Project SAFE, resistance was nowhere in sight. The university made the change. “I didn’t know where to put my adrenaline because I was preparing for a fight.”
Project SAFE works closely with university initiatives and community organizations, like the Women’s Center and Shelter. Their partnership with Pittsburgh Action Against Rape helped create online training modules, which Miller found valuable because of its accessibility. Collaboration with the UPMC Gender Clinic introduced a speaker series that featured Jorge Vidal, the project coordinator at the Culturally Specific Services Program. The organization creates culturally-appropriate responses to sexual and/or domestic violence. Miller emphasized that Vidal did such a “good job, I have the video saved and I still go back and watch it sometimes.”
What makes the student-backed group unique is that it brings lived experience to university policy. “One of the huge reasons Project SAFE is on campus is because of the ways Title IX cases were handled,” Hoag recalled. A lack of transparency surrounding the reporting process made it difficult for survivors to share their stories. Yet these students deserve to “know they have control over what’s going to happen next. If you don’t know that, it makes reporting really scary, because there are a lot of unknowns.”
Project SAFE has pushed for the Title IX Office to create a digestible timeline that tells students what to expect when reporting. Hoag attributed Tunney as a champion of this effort: “Dr. Tunney has gone through [Title IX directives] with a fine-tooth comb.” Hoag wants to ensure the process does not cause survivors to “re-traumatize themselves by repeating their story over and over.”
Miller sees Project SAFE as an opportunity for empowerment at Carlow. But beyond the outward-facing work their leaders do, Miller is grounded by the internal efforts at play. “I’m really proud of all the people who are … continuing to choose to be involved, because I think it’s really easy to experience burnout in a field like this.” Miller lauded the bravery and resilience of Project SAFE’s leadership to preserve “even when it’s exhausting.”
Another initiative underway is a campus climate survey, to gauge the proportion of students who are victims of violence. “We did try to do it in 2021, but we didn’t get enough results,” Hoag said in reference to publishing the survey. “As small as Carlow is, nobody knows about [Project SAFE].”
They hope that PUBS changes that. 
The idea for PUBS began last semester, when students’ demands for visibility were high. So Peer Educators — Project Safe’s student leaders — brainstormed ways to offer students “a leg to stand on at this university.” Their idea: a walk through Oakland, where students from the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University could join to show their support for survivors of sexual violence.
When Hoag became a peer educator, she was surprised by her friends’ response to her new job: “stories of times that someone violated their boundaries.” And it seemed like this was one of the first times the stories had been told. “They felt like they’re the only people that had to experience that,” Hoag recalled, making their storytelling “bittersweet.” Because of the work Hoag engages in with Project SAFE, there is now a space for these stories to be heard. 
Hoag said students have shared their stories to peer educators who table on campus, reinforcing the importance of “having someone listen to your story and say, ‘I’m here for you and I hear you.’”

On March 14, the morning after spring break, students and staff at Carnegie Mellon were greeted by bright posters in red, green, and blue, with the headings asking “Do grad students deserve unlivable low wages?”, “Is some grad work worth 22K less than other grad work?”, and “Is our work worth 7.5% less than last year?” The posters had accompanying graphics of supporting statistics, and a QR code linked to a survey asking respondents to share their experiences with “CMU’s poverty wages.” On the same day, a twitter page called “CMU Grad Students Deserve Fair Pay,” @CMUBetter, started tweeting out the posters. The Tartan reached out to the students behind this campaign, and they agreed to speak with us on the condition of anonymity, identifying themselves as “CMU Better”: “members of the Carnegie Mellon graduate student community advocating for fair pay and dignified working conditions, including grad students from the School of Computer Science, College of Fine Arts, College of Engineering, [and] Dietrich College.”
The group started as a few students in the School of Computer Science who discussed the unique pressures of a graduate program. “From the start, our goals were to build community with other graduate students who may be feeling isolated or disaffected, by naming the structural issues we all face,” they said. They cited power imbalances in their advising relationships, a lack of work/life balance, financial insecurity, and medical care that does not cover basic needs, among other systemic issues. 
They began speaking with members of the Graduate Student Assembly (GSA), the branch of student government that represents all graduate students, and alumni who previously held leadership roles to gather data. They also began doing casual walkthroughs to meet students from other departments to gather a better understanding of the graduate student experience across departments. 
The group chose to highlight financial insecurity in their posters as it cuts across departments and individual experiences. “CMU administration often argues that it would be impossible to achieve pay parity across departments because of different funding structures such as grants, teaching stipends, et cetera,” they said. The group revealed that they wanted to gather student consensus around modest and reasonable requests like providing a living wage and accounting for yearly inflation. “We are outraged that our peers in Drama and Design are paid below the line — or not at all,” they said. 
Provost Jim Garett announced on March 16 that Carnegie Mellon will institute a minimum stipend of $2,250 per month for all qualifying doctoral students and full coverage of health insurance premiums, among other benefits. However, the group pointed out that the update does not cover Masters students. They also highlighted that even doctoral students on the new minimum stipends with 12-month funding would only make $27,000, when the cost of living in Pittsburgh is about $24,658 (excluding health insurance) by Carnegie Mellon’s own estimate. “With inflation at more than 7 percent and increasing, this one-time change is only going to be less helpful over time. Students have a right to earn a living wage for their work,” they said. This is particularly true for students who have family obligations, chronic health conditions that result in large out-of-pocket expenses, or those funded for less than a year — living on the minimum stipends does not come close to financial stability. 
“It is also important to realize that for many Ph.D. students, a Ph.D. is effectively our first job, often held for 5 years or more, where folks might otherwise be saving for their future,” they said. The group reasoned that at the very least, the post-tax minimum stipend should be more than the cost of living in Pittsburgh, and all stipends should be adjusted yearly for inflation. “The university continually highlights the excellent research, creative work, and teaching that graduate students do; meanwhile many graduate students sacrifice their future financial stability to come here.” The group added that students should be given benefits like parental leave, medical leave, dental insurance, and retirement contributions.
“CMU’s disconnected departmental structure leads graduate students to feel alone in their struggles or remain oblivious to the difficulties other graduate students in other departments face,” they revealed. The group also noted that many students reached out to them after the campaign, expressing their lack of awareness of the pay disparity between departments. 
They added that several students shared stories about their experience at Carnegie Mellon that weren’t related to pay, such as feelings of depression, a culture of overwork, and struggles with abusive supervisors. The group shared some anonymized survey responses from consenting respondents with The Tartan. “Thank god food stamps and Medicare are around to pick up CMU's slack in not paying a living wage or providing benefits to its grad student employees,” wrote one student. “It's a significant struggle to offset rent hikes. Not to mention the massive increase in gasoline and food prices. My current MSE stipend just is not enough to live comfortably in Pittsburgh anymore,” wrote another student. 
Another student shared, “In my program, grad students do not get paid at all. This means I have to work an outside job to make ends meet, plus take out more student loans to cover housing. This [has] negatively affected my health both physically and mentally, as I am severely overworked and overwhelmed.” 
A graduate student from the School of Drama wrote that they are expected to be full-time students without receiving a stipend. “We teach for the school, we direct, design, and build all of the school's shows on top of a full class load. It's 12 hour days every day before homework. How are we supposed to sustain and support ourselves without any financial assistance? It's depressing and unsustainable,” shared the student. 
The group said that some respondents cited their relatively privileged positions, such as having no dependents, dual income from a working partner, or parental support, as the only reasons they are able to participate in their programs, saying that this runs counter to Carnegie Mellon’s promised Diversity, Equity and Inclusion efforts. Additionally, they said that staff members and undergraduates also filled out their survey form with expressions of support, and that they are thinking about ways that graduate students can partner with staff and other members of the Carnegie Mellon community, many of whom have similar concerns about their own working conditions.
CMUBetter’s next steps include hearing about issues beyond low pay and incorporating them into their picture of the graduate student experience, as they understand that pay isn’t the only issue affecting people’s graduate work experience, and it’s not the only issue they want to address. “We want to raise awareness of the poor and disparate working conditions experienced by graduate students across CMU, build togetherness, and paint a more complete view of the graduate student condition here.”
This is the first part in a series of articles regarding graduate students and the benefits they receive as students of Carnegie Mellon.

Satire, as an art, has been a pinnacle of media and entertainment for centuries. However, its primary function is to use humor to cushion critique of wider social issues. The word “satire” is derived from the Latin word “satur” meaning “well-fed.” One of the earliest satirical works was Aristophane’s Lysistrata written in 411 BCE in which “the protagonist Lysistrata convinces women to withhold sex from men in an effort to convince them to end the Peloponnesian War,” according to a MasterClass description. From its earliest uses, satire has critiqued major societal issues: comedy used as a mask for a scathing take on the horrific problems of the world.
Every year, The Tartan staff come together to make "The Natrat," a satirical issue of our typical newspaper. More than an April fool’s joke, The Natrat is a beloved Tartan tradition which allows writers to combine comedy and creative techniques with our penchant for journalism. We make "The Natrat" not only because it is hysterical and The Tartan staff is made up of very funny people, but also because we believe satire is a very poignant method of journalistic critique.
Carnegie Mellon is certainly not a perfect institution, with overflowing systemic issues alongside administrative errors. We certainly cannot expect these problems to be solved overnight and without being called out. That is why student action is incredibly vital. From student government platforms which aim to solve university problems (despite little jurisdiction to do so), to local protests, art exhibits, and news, the Carnegie Mellon community has the capacity to self-reflect and force the change we want to see. 
"The Natrat" does this in a new format, using comedy to point out deep systemic issues not only at Carnegie Mellon but also in the world. From misogyny, to classicism, to tuition prices, to Carnegie Mellon administrative issues, this issue of The Natrat makes a point to use literary techniques in order to make people both laugh and realize the necessity for change these ridiculous issues. 
We hope you enjoy The Natrat, not just because it will make you laugh but also because it will challenge you to see the flaws in our university and the world. It is up to us, the students, to get what we want out of Carnegie Mellon and if we can put a few smiles on your face in the process of getting you to take conscious control of your experience here, then we are doing something right. So, enjoy :)
Sincerely,
The Editorial Staff

Given that applicants to Carnegie Mellon come from across the United States and the world, it’s no surprise that Carnegie Mellon touts one of the most diverse student populations in the country. According to College Factual’s report on Carnegie Mellon, the university ranks in the top one percent of all universities in overall diversity. While this may be true for ethnic and gender diversity, this can’t really be said for geographic diversity at Carnegie Mellon.
According to the common data set for 2020 admissions from Carnegie Mellon, geographic residence has no consideration in an applicant’s profile. This is unique among peer institutions; Carnegie Mellon is one of two institutions in the University Athletic Association that doesn’t take this into consideration (the other being Case Western Reserve University). Similar institutions like Harvard, MIT, and Cornell all take geographical residence into consideration.
As Carnegie Mellon doesn’t take geographical representation into account, there is no guarantee that students will accurately represent the geographic diversity of its applicants. However, there is probably no way of knowing the geographical makeup of Carnegie Mellon applicants. It is a common practice among universities to not report geographical classifiers (like urban versus rural), and they take advantage of it. If a university doesn’t have to report their geographic diversity, then it won’t count against them when they fail to meet adequate geographical diversity.
This is one of the reasons why so many people are from the same places; according to data from 2021, over 55 percent of the incoming class was from four states: California (16.9 percent), New Jersey (13.6), Pennsylvania (13.1), and New York (12.5).  Pennsylvania is likely so high on the list since Carnegie Mellon is located in Pennsylvania, but what about the others? They all have something in common: students in proximity to major cities have access to large amount of resources which helps boost them into a school like Carnegie Mellon.
Take into consideration the difference between someone who went to a public school in the middle of nowhere with a graduating class of 50 and someone who went to a private school in the Bay Area. The student who went to the private school would probably have much better resources than someone who went to the public school. Speaking from experience, those who lived in poorer rural communities didn’t have resources like a solid guidance counselor. In these schools, the guidance department is more focused on having students graduate and attend community college than having one-on-one conversations with students who are aiming to go to schools like Carnegie Mellon.
This point is also reflected in the financial aid that Carnegie Mellon distributes to students. In a bulletin released by the university, only 38 percent of undergraduate students receive need-based financial aid. This is quite simply a reflection of the resources that these students and their families had access to during the students’ high school years. The same bulletin also states that the average financial aid offer (note this is “offer,” not “package”; the offer average tends to be higher on average than what is actually awarded) for students who receive one is just under $50,000, which is more than half the cost for a student to attend Carnegie Mellon. Additionally, Carnegie Mellon falls far under average in terms of students who receive Pell grants. Nationally, around 34 percent of undergraduates receive a Pell grant. At Carnegie Mellon, it is only 14.2 percent. These points just go to show that, on average, a student at Carnegie Mellon simply has the resources to succeed.
This is nothing but a reflection of the communities that the students grew up in. On average, a student at Carnegie Mellon likely didn’t grow up in a farm town that struggles to give its students modern resources. For many states, public schools receive a majority of their funding from property taxes. There may be initiatives out there to make sure schools are receiving the funding they need, but they probably will fall short because state governing bodies simply aren’t aware of problems that exist in the public school system. An example of this in Pennsylvania is how charter school funding works. The money is taken directly from public schools and given to other schools, creating an equity gap. Due to inaction from the Pennsylvania government, this is going to continue to be a problem for years to come, meaning public schools in Pennsylvania who can barely afford their current costs are going to stagnate because they can’t reinvest in themselves. 
While geographical residence isn’t taken into consideration, rigor of secondary school is “very important” to one’s application according to the Carnegie Mellon common data set. As such, students who attended a high school that simply didn’t have the resources to offer rigorous courses are automatically put at a disadvantage in the application process. Why would Carnegie Mellon take a risk on someone who went to a “not rigorous” high school that would drop out after a semester and miss out on three years of tuition? As a result, since geographical residence isn’t considered in one’s application, hard-working students who could get into Carnegie Mellon if they went to a different high school or their parents made just a little bit more are handed a rejection letter.
So if Carnegie Mellon really wants to have a “holistic review process” for all their applications, they should be considering geographical residence as part of their decision to reject or accept students. As admission rates continue to plummet and more and more people apply to colleges, it’s going to be increasingly difficult for potential Tartans from poorer areas who simply can’t match the resources of their more well-off peers.
