The Carnegie Mellon swimming and diving teams have had a busy start to the semester, topping Case Western Reserve University and Allegheny College before falling to Kenyon College and Ashland University in a double-dual meet on Saturday. The men are now 6–2 on the year, while the women are 4–4.
Less than two days after returning from their training trip in Miami, Fla., the teams took to the starting blocks in Cleveland to battle Case Western Reserve. 
The women were victorious, 133–95, and many of the Tartans took first in their respective events, including junior Molly Evans, who took first in the 100-yard backstroke and the 1000-yard freestyle. Senior Sara Andrews took the 200-yard freestyle, junior Brianne Burton won the 50-yard freestyle, and sophomore Victoria Adams beat out the competition in the 500-yard freestyle with a time of 5:20.58. Sophomore Olivia DeFazio also swept the one- and three-meter diving events. Junior Rebecca Ussai and first-year Dorothy Yu took first in the 100-yard butterfly and 400-yard IM, respectively.
The men’s side of the team was equally dominant, nearly doubling the Spartans in points, 156–80. 
The Tartans who took first were seniors Jonas Altman-Kurosaki in the 1000-yard freestyle with a time of 9:56.51; Jeff Dahlen in the 100-yard backstroke, finishing in at 54.04; junior Alex Hanson in the 400-yard IM, and first-year Dan Glaser-Garbrick in the 100-yard butterfly. First-year Brandon Yee grabbed the win for both the 100- and 200-yard freestyle, while senior Matt Kuhn swept the diving competition.
“These past couple weeks have been our most intense weeks of training, and even though a lot of the guys are feeling tired and sore, we have been able to perform at higher levels than I have seen in my four years here,” Dahlen noted of his team’s spectacular success this month. “I think our success throughout the season has been attributed to our depth as a team. We are fortunate to have studs in every event. Our freshman class in particular has done an outstanding job of filling in the voids and has really expanded our depth as a whole. Our coach always jokes that it makes his life difficult to put together relays because we have so many talented guys.”
The Tartans  continued their momentum against Allegheny College, winning 187–105 on the men’s side and 162–124 for the women’s. Both teams kicked off the meet by taking first in the 200-yard medley relay. In the 1000-yard freestyle, Adams and senior Jon Spring took the victories, followed by a win from Glaser-Garbrick in the men’s 200-yard freestyle. 
Dahlen and Evans won the 100-yard backstroke, while senior Jason Huber and Yu cleaned up in the 100-yard breaststroke. The 200-yard butterfly was again won by two Tartans, Yee and Ussai, while the 50-yard freestyle was taken by senior Scott Moorby and Burton. Kuhn and DeFazio dominated in the one-meter dive event. Yu picked up her second event win in the 200-yard backstroke, and first-year Price Kinney claimed victory in the 200-yard breaststroke. Hanson picked up another event win for the Tartans in the 500-yard freestyle, while DeFazio won her second dive event in the three-meter, and sophomore Eli Fatsi won the three-meter event for the men’s side.
The heavy workload seemed to take its toll on both teams on Saturday, however, as they went up against perennial Division III champion Kenyon College and Division II program Ashland University. The men were only able to pull off one individual victory, while the women were able to take two as the Tartans fell to both opponents.
Despite the losses, the Tartans cannot help but be encouraged by their strong training and results. “Coming off of a training trip, it’s tough to be at our best every meet,” said sophomore Allyson Koyen. “But everyone has been getting up for each race, and hopefully our strong efforts will carry over when we taper for championships.”
“We are in great shape, and we’ve been swimming better and better every weekend, and I think with a good rest for conferences we can really turn some heads,” Dahlen observed. He, like so many players in every varsity sport at Carnegie Mellon, remarked, “Beat Emory.”
The Tartans will return to competition this Saturday against Westminister College in New Wilmington, Pa.

During winter break when the campus was recovering from a rigorous fall semester, the Tartans’ women’s basketball team was hard at work during the winter break and into the new semester, advancing its overall record to 8–6 and University Athletic Association (UAA) record to 1–2.
The Tartans started off their winter break schedule with a 59–53 win at Hiram College on Dec. 18. The victory was a team effort: Sophomore Ali Aunkst finished with 13 points, sophomore Jacki Cortese recorded a double-double 12 points and 10 rebounds, fifth-year senior Rachelle Roll added 11, and first-year Brit Phillips finished with 10. First-year Emily Peel grabbed 11 boards.
After a week hiatus, the Tartans hit the hardwood with a win, 65–61, on Dec. 29 in the first game of the Ohio Wesleyan Bishop Classic/Hoops for Hope against Franklin University. Phillips ended with a career-high of 21 points, sophomore Jennifer Larsen ended with 15, Aunkst with 10, and Roll pulled down a season high of 12 rebounds.
In the championship game of the Ohio Wesleyan Bishop Classic/Hoops for Hope on Dec. 30, the Cardinal and Gray pulled out an entertaining victory over Olivet College in overtime, 58–56. Though Carnegie Mellon was down 16 points with 10:40 left in the game, the squad went on an astonishing 20–3 run to secure a lead. With 30 seconds left in regulation, Olivet tied the game and the Tartans were unable to answer, sending the game into extra minutes. A trey by Aunkst and a foul shot by Phillips secured the 58–56 victory. Aunkst scored a career-high 23 points and was named to the All-Tournament team. Phillips scored 14 points and was named the tournament’s Most Valuable Player.
Despite their productive offensive, the Tartans were most proud of their team defense. Larsen stated that the whole team “trust[s] each other and it really pays off for us when we play that way. The best thing we can do as a team and as individuals is play great defense. We have the ability to play really amazing team defense and when we are dedicated to doing that every aspect of our game improves.”
Unfortunately, defense was not enough on Jan. 3 for Carnegie Mellon in their last non-conference game against Stevenson University, as they fell 61–63. Larsen tallied 19 points and sophomore Nicole Vaccarella knocked down 16 points.
Carnegie Mellon opened its UAA season on Jan. 8 with a 56–47 win at Emory University. The Tartans ended the first half strong with a 33–21 lead. However, they came out cold from halftime as the Tartans shot one for eight while Emory started with a 12–4 run. However, Carnegie Mellon kicked it into overdrive, answering with a 6–0 run to take a 10 point lead. Never looking back, the Tartans kept up intense defense to secure the 56–47 win. Larsen tallied 26 points and nine rebounds, Roll had a double-double with 10 points and 13 rebounds, first-year Tori Baggio pulled down eight rebounds, and Phillips scored seven points while dishing out six assists.
The win to start conference play proved to boost the squad’s confidence. “We needed the win against Emory to prove to ourselves that we belong in this conference and I think everybody else was just as psyched as I was to get a victory,” Larsen said.
Unfortunately, the second game of UAA play ended a little differently for the Tartans, with a hard loss, 58–51, at University of Rochester on Jan. 10. Phillips ended the night with 22 points, Larsen added 13, and Roll grabbed eight rebounds.
Although Carnegie Mellon lost a tough game to Rochester, Vaccarella says the team is still hopeful. “After the weekend, the team has gained a greater sense of confidence going into the rest of conference play,” she said. “Our win against Emory and a competitive game against Rochester has proven that we can become a major competitor this year. We know that if we continue to work hard, and focus on playing together as a team, we can be very successful this year, and take everyone by surprise.”
Saturday marked the Tartans’ third conference game, but they lost their road game against Case Western Reserve University, 49–71. Case’s defense forced the Tartans to make 28 turnovers in the first half, which gave the Spartans a comfortable 43–24 lead going into the half. While neither team shot well, Case made 28 out of 34 free throws while the Tartans only made 23 trips to the line, making 16. Peel recorded 12 points, Aunkst scored 14, and Roll grabbed 12 rebounds.
Carnegie Mellon continues UAA play with two home games this weekend, starting with the University of Chicago on Friday at 6 p.m. and Washington University at 2 p.m. on Sunday. This weekend is also the Tartans’ “Heroes Weekend.”

The Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s track and field teams took on opponents from all divisions this past Saturday in their first meet of the 2010 season. The teams competed at Division I Kent State University’s Doug Raymond Invite, some continuing on from cross country, others shaking off nearly nine months of rust since the end of the 2009 season. Top runners for the women included juniors Laura McKee and Courtney Baker, while juniors Nate Bussiere and J.P. Allera ran well for the men. Seniors James Hulley and Chris Bridgman held their own in the field events.
In the women’s 400-meter dash, senior Diane Mattingly took 20th place with a time of 1:02.16. Sophomore Luci Laffitte competed two heats later and finished in 1:04.39 to take 24th overall. McKee then led the way for Tartans in the 800-meter run, completing the race in 2:28.41 to finish seventh in the event, 5.92 seconds ahead of senior teammate Crystal LeePow, who came in 16th. In the one-mile run, it was Baker taking charge for Carnegie Mellon, clocking in at 5:17.58 and finishing fifth overall. First-year cross country standout Emily Wobb took 12th with a time of 5:34.73.
For the men, first-year Joel Lu and sophomore Ryan Kissel finished 34th and 35th in the 60-meter dash with times of 7.68 and 7.75 seconds, respectively. The duo also competed in the 200-meter dash. 
Bussiere put forth a strong showing in both the 800- and 1000-meter runs, taking eighth place in the 800 (1:59.86) and sixth in the 1000 (2:34.95). Sophomore Rob Morhard also competed the 800, finishing 15th in 2:04.63. 
Morhard was the team’s top finisher in the mile run, finishing 18th in 4:33.55, five seconds ahead of junior teammate Justin Kurp (22nd). Allera was the lone Tartan to compete in the 3000-meter run, completing the event in 9:03.23, good for 11th place overall.
“The meet was early in the season, but it was a good way to gauge where we are and where we need more work,” said Bussiere. “I was pleased with how I ran, especially so early in the year. It’s always hard to get going after winter break, but this was a good opportunity to jump-start the season.”
In the field events, junior Pat O’Brien tied for 10th in the high jump with a height of 1.90 meters. Bridgman began his final season by finishing fourth in the pole vault, clearing a height of 4.30 meters, while Kissel took 13th in the long jump with a 5.96-meter leap. Hulley, hoping to make a mark at NCAAs this year, started off his senior season by taking eighth in the shot put and 13th in the weight throw, with distances of 15.71 meters and 15.92 meters, respectively. Senior Chris Fornataro also competed in both throwing events, coming in 27th in the shot put (12.30 meters) and 18th in the weight throw (14.23 meters).
Both the men’s and women’s teams will next compete Saturday at Denison University in Granville, Ohio.

While most students were lounging on the couches and enjoying the holidays with friends and family, the Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team was knocking down free throws and perfecting plays. Over the long winter break, the Tartans moved their record to 4–9 overall and 0–3 in UAA play.
Just before the break, the Tartans hosted Heidelberg and Hood Colleges at the 19th annual Radisson/Carnegie Mellon Tournament. On Saturday, Nov. 28, the Tartans fell to Heidelberg 74–60 in the tournament’s opening round. After scoring eight unanswered points early in the first half, things were looking good for the Cardinal and Gray, but Heidelberg countered with a 13-point run of their own. Heidelberg maintained their lead for the rest of the half and entered the break leading 34–29. The Tartans challenged the Berg in the second half, taking the lead three separate times, but eventually fell short. The Tartans were led by junior Shane Rife with 16 points, followed by junior Matt Pettit with 14 points, and senior Jack Anderson, who cashed in for 12 points.
On Sunday, Nov. 29, the Tartans took on Hood College in the consolation game and came away with a 77–67 victory. Pettit paved the way for the Tartans, dropping 17 points and was named to the All-Tournament team. Three other Tartans finished the game in double digits: Anderson and sophomore John Duhring had 15 points apiece, while Rife added 10 points and a career-high of five assists.
On Dec. 2, the Tartans traveled to Huntingdon, Pa., to take on the Eagles of Juniata College. After only shooting one for nine in the first five minutes of the game, a massive dunk by Duhring jump-started the Tartans to an 84–79 victory. Duhring was eight for 12 and scored 18 points in the first half alone. He finished the game with a career-high 23 points, followed by Pettit and Anderson with 13 and 11 points, respectively.
The Tartans claimed their first winning record of the season on Dec. 12 as they defeated LaRoche College 73–58, improving to 4–3 overall. The Tartans started strong off the tip and took an early 8–0 lead. 
The Redhawks were able to come within two points of the Tartans at the end of the half, but after the break, the Tartans appeared unstoppable. Led by Anderson’s 21 second-half points, the Tartans took a double-digit lead over the Redhawks. Anderson finished the game with 27 points, while Pettit cashed in for 15 points and 12 rebounds, and Rife finished with 13 points.
After a two-week break, the Tartans were back in action on Jan. 3 playing Widener University on the campus of DeSales University. The Tartans were strong in the first half and went into the break with a 35–32 lead but lost momentum in the second half. Anderson’s career high of 28 points was not enough to make up for the Tartans’ 20 turnovers and poor second-half shooting percentage. The Tartans were only three and 13 from behind the arc and shot 33.3 percent in the second half.
The Tartans were unable to rebound from their loss to Widener as the fell to Alvernia University on Jan. 4 at the Casa Mia Holiday Classic hosted by DeSales University. The Tartans dropped a 72–62 decision despite having four players score in double digits. Pettit recorded his fifth double-double of the season with 10 points and 11 rebounds, while Anderson once again led the team with 16 points. 
The Tartans were just 39 percent from the field compared to the Crusaders’ 49 percent. Despite the two losses, Anderson’s performance earned him University Athletic Association (UAA) Athlete of the Week honors.
On Jan. 8, the Tartans opened up UAA play in Atlanta, Ga., at the home of the Emory University Eagles, but fell 80–67 in a disappointing battle. 
“We had a pretty rocky start to the season and so we really wanted to come out strong in UAA play,” sophomore Max Gordon said. “It was really disappointing to come away with a loss in our UAA opener.”
Just two days later the Tartans dropped their second UAA game to the Yellowjackets of Rochester University. After an early 14–2 run by the Yellowjackets, the Tartans could not find a way to win. A three-point play by Anderson brought the Tartans to within one point, but the Yellowjackets went on a 10–0 run and maintained control for the rest of the game.
Jan. 12 was a bittersweet day for the Tartans as they tallied their fifth straight loss in a game against Catholic University of America. However, in the loss, Anderson became the 18th player in Carnegie Mellon history to score 1000 career points. The game was close, but the Tartans were unable finish on top.
“It’s really tough on the team morale to lose five games in a row, but it’s still early in the season,” Gordon said. “We have a big game against Case Western coming up and it will be a great opportunity to show our character and turn this season around.”
Unfortunately, the Tartans were unable to come away with a victory at Case Western Reserve University and fell to the Spartans 74–70. The Tartans fought for the win, as first-year Christian Shepley sank two three-pointers to come within two points with only 3:30 remaining in the game, but it was not enough and the Spartans held onto their lead.
The Tartans will resume UAA play as they face the University of Chicago in Skibo Gym on Friday at 8 p.m.

After coming off a strong fall season, the Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team looks to continue its success in an always-challenging spring season. The Tartans are currently ranked number six in the country, coming off an undefeated fall that featured a variety of accolades.
Last year, the team finished the season with a 21–3 record, earned its first showing in the history of Carnegie Mellon at the NCAA Championships, and took second at the UAA championships after falling 4–5 to Emory in the finals.
Opposing teams will have nightmares about the Tartans’ deep lineup, starting with sophomore phenomenon Laura Chen. Chen, who starts at number-one singles, is coming off her second consecutive ITA regional championship in both singles and doubles. Sophomore Courtney Chin also had a strong fall season, placing second behind Chen in the ITA regional tournament and finishing number four in the regional rankings. First-year Alex Tapak, who is ranked number 13 in the region, completes an intimidating top three of a team that stands to be one of the best in Carnegie Mellon’s history.
The Tartans have circled the dates of Feb. 26–28 as one of the most crucial periods of their season. This marks the start of ITA Indoor Nationals, where the Tartans are defending champions and where they have always experienced a good deal of success. It also could be an important match to start out the team on the right foot, and it would give them a great deal of confidence throughout the season. The Tartans have made winning this tournament one of their main goals. 
“We have been looking forward to this tournament ever since we came back from school,” Chen said. “If we defend our title, it would be a defining moment early in the season that should be able to set the tone for the rest of the year.”
Carnegie Mellon begins the quest for the number-one ranking on Saturday, Feb. 13, against Slippery Rock University and Penn State Behrend at the Oxford North Athletic Club.

Returning to competition after an injury last semester, sophomore Jen Larsen has made determined efforts to help out the Tartans’ women’s basketball team in some close matches. In the first University Athletic Association (UAA) conference game at Emory in Atlanta, Larsen posted a career-high 26 points and nine rebounds, and she as been contributing respectable numbers in more recent games as well. 
.Larsen commented on her goals for the rest of the season. “My biggest individual goal for the rest of the season is to gain better consistency in how I play. I want my teammates to be able to depend on me,” she said.
Larsen’s hometown of Exeter, N.H. has a much different atmosphere as a small town than the city life of Pittsburgh, but Larsen appreciates the manageable size of the city and the somewhat secluded feel of campus relative to its distance from downtown. Although she misses the beach and plentiful snow of New England, she has embraced the change in going to school away from home. Larsen and her friends have found the Tartans Pavilion to be an ideal hangout and study space, and a convenient place to eat during her busy schedule of practices and classes during basketball season.
As a student studying psychology, Larsen hopes to someday open her own practice as a clinical psychologist in a region of the country where she can be closest to her family and friends. Carnegie Mellon’s prestigious academic reputation was a deciding factor for Larsen’s choice of schools, and the chance to play college basketball sweetened the deal. In the future, Larsen hopes to perpetuate the presence of sports in her life by joining an adult league after college while she pursues a career. Until then, Larsen can look forward to keep contributing admirably to the women’s basketball program and take advantage of the academics that Carnegie Mellon has to offer.

The women’s basketball team is calling this upcoming weekend “Heroes Weekend” in honor of the nonprofit organization they have been working with this season, the Hero Program.
The Hero Program supports financially constricted families facing terminal illnesses by helping raise funds, medical supply donations, and monetary gifts like prepaid gas cards. After meeting Steve Wetzel, a program head, at an athletic department-wide event, junior point guard Alex Hansen explained that the team “was particularly moved by his story and the types of things he was doing.” Hansen and sophomore forward Jen Larsen then had the opportunity to spend time with Wetzel and a Hero family, which “made [them] realize the impact [they could] have on local people in need.”
For Heroes Weekend, the Tartans’ main event will be “Hotcakes for Heroes” on Saturday from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. in Rangos 3. All-you-can-eat pancakes will be served for $5 a person. Also, T-shirts and Heroes wristbands will be sold during the event and at both the men’s and women’s games on Friday and Sunday. All of the proceeds will be given to the Hero Program.
The Tartans want to host a successful event, one where they, as stated by Hansen, “can raise awareness about something in our community that [Carnegie Mellon students] can support and change. There will be Hero families at the breakfast, so everyone who comes can actually see where their money is going.”

Prior to a couple of months ago, professional golfer Tiger Woods was recognized as the best golfer in the world, and possibly the best golfer of all time. Then, in the early morning of Nov. 27, 2009, Woods was involved in a minor car accident, but the details of what caused the accident were not released. A few weeks later, it was discovered that the accident took place while Woods was fleeing from his wife, Elin Nordegren, after she discovered that Woods had been cheating on her with several mistresses. From then on, the media exploded, turning an already intriguing story into a full-blown investigation. Despite the bad press, the public shouldn't just throw their favor for Woods out the window just yet. 
Woods has been treated unfairly and has been exposed to way too much media criticism. However, if Woods plays his cards right, he will be able to put this troubling time behind him. After the incident, the only thing mentioned on the news was the Woods situation. Different channels ranging from ESPN to CBS reported on the “scandal,” with many people attacking Woods for his infidelity. Overall, the Woods story has been blown way out of proportion, and the public is not taking into account that Woods is a human being, just like everyone else. As a human, he will obviously make some mistakes in his life. Although what he did was wrong, there is no reason for us to judge his every move. Woods’ status as a role model should be determined based on the way he handles this situation, not because of the mistakes he has made. If Woods continues to handle himself in a professional manner, and proves that he has turned his life around from a major setback, this could in fact increase his status as a respected role model. He will always have this as a red mark on his mostly perfect resume, but he can easily bounce back in a huge way.
We must also remember that Woods is still the best golfer in the world today. No matter what he does off the course, he still brings excitement to the golf world unlike any other to ever play the game of golf. Golf fans should separate his play from his off-course antics, and view him as someone that has worked so hard to achieve many of his current accomplishments. Woods could not have gotten this far without hard work throughout his life, and any other current golfer cannot rival his level of dedication to the sport. He has fully earned his title as “Sportsman of the Decade,” as presented to him by the Associated Press. Tiger has 71 career PGA Tour Titles and has also won 14 major tournaments. No golfer other than the great Jack Nicklaus can be mentioned in the same sentence as Woods when talking about the game of golf, and it should be kept this way. This situation should not undermine his accomplishments, and I fully expect Woods to someday be elected into the Hall of Fame.  
Another debate has been about Woods' future ability to bounce back from such a devastating blow to his reputation. Major companies such as Gatorade, AT&T, and General Motors have all dropped Woods as a sponsor. Some companies, such as Nike, have stuck with Woods but lessened the amount of publicity he gets within the company. I believe that if Woods follows a few simple steps, he can come back to golf facing a much better reaction than many people are expecting. First off, Tiger must seek help from other superstars that have been in similar situations. The first name that comes to mind is none other than NBA hero, Kobe Bryant. Bryant went through the exact same situation almost seven years ago. However, Bryant has easily salvaged his reputation by making well-timed apologies along with continuing to give all his effort on the court. He has made it his personal goal to win as many championships as possible, and he is actually coming off an NBA championship from last year. Along with great success on the court, Bryant has healed his image by staying out of anything controversial for the past seven years. As long as Woods stays clean and continues to have success on the course, he will be able to repair his image. 
The road out of infamy will be extremely tough for Woods, but not impossible by any means. As long as he makes all the right moves, and fixes up his personal life, he will come back stronger than ever. By the end of his career, Woods will be remembered as the greatest golfer to ever play the game, and this incident will merely be a speed bump in what will be an otherwise stellar career.

One of the most debated health issues of 2009 was the swine flu pandemic. At Carnegie Mellon especially, the disease infected student after student at an alarming rate. While the government has issued vaccines available for the general public, one Carnegie Mellon professor has developed a model that will make any future influenza vaccines much more effective and applicable to a multitude of diseases.
Soo-Haeng Cho is an assistant professor of operations management in the Tepper School of Business, teaching courses in not only operations management but also dynamic programming to Ph.D. students. His paper, “The Optimal Composition of Influenza Vaccines Subject to Random Production Yields,” was published in October 2009 and concerns providing a way to determine what virus strains would be most useful to be combated by a proposed vaccine. Although science is not part of Cho’s official role, he still has a remarkable grasp of how influenza viruses affect people.
Every year, various influenza viruses circulate with different levels of severity. In 2009, the most prominent of these virus strains happened to be the swine flu. “We cannot perfectly predict which virus strain will spread each year,” reported Cho from his office in Posner Hall. He first became interested in this research several years ago, when only two manufacturers provided flu vaccines. One of the manufacturers was forced to abandon production after their vaccines were revealed to be contaminated, leaving only 50 million vaccinations available to the general public — not nearly enough. 
By the end of 2009, demand for the swine flu vaccine lessened as the active cases of flu had declined since the peak of H1N1 cases in the fall. 
Therefore, the government decided to cut back its orders from vaccine manufacturers — a Yahoo news article reported that the U.S. would cut its vaccination order from Australia’s CSL Ltd. in half — as fear of the swine flu decreased. Each year, the Vaccine and Related Biologic Products Advisory Committee decides by February or March which specific virus strains to include in vaccines. Essentially, the committee has to choose one of three options: It can delay its decision in order to observe the viruses more thoroughly, it can retain the virus strain used in the previous year, or it can change to a new virus strain. “If you change to a new virus strain,” warns Cho, “production becomes more unpredictable.” 
He points out the flaw in the argument as this: If the committee chooses to distribute earlier, the risk of protecting against a wrong strain rises. Of course, even with meticulous planning, there’s no telling if the vaccine will be useful again in the years to come, as the viruses are constantly mutating. The observation option involves monitoring virus activities around the world. This is precisely how Cho developed his mathematical model. It included several variables, including the “cross-efficacy” of the vaccine in question (how effective the vaccine will be when a vaccine strain differs from a circulating strain), the number of manufacturers, how many vaccines the manufacturers can produce in a certain amount of time, the amount of time before distribution, and the number of viruses estimated to be circulating.
Cho hopes that the model will be considered before the committee meets again for the yearly distribution plan. The ultimate goal of his work — to better match supply and demand through an “optimal dynamic policy” — may lead to a better use of limited resources, and, more importantly, limited time in the face of global health crises.

Air pollution has been a huge problem over the past century, especially here in industry-based Pittsburgh. But beginning last summer, a team of researchers at Carnegie Mellon have conducted research on particle air pollution and reevaluated the effect of these particles on health and the environment.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has attempted to reduce pollution through specific concentration limits. Air pollution in particular has always been an issue, requiring costly solutions and causing roughly 50,000 premature deaths in the U.S. yearly. It has also been proven to have a negative effect on climate around the globe.
Neil Donahue, a professor of chemistry, chemical engineering, and engineering and public policy (EPP), helped spearhead the project due to his interest in how chemicals are oxidized in the atmosphere. He and Allen Robinson, a professor of mechanical engineering and EPP, belong to Carnegie Mellon’s Center for Atmospheric Particle Studies (CAPS), which helped conduct the study.
Over the past few years, Donahue's goal has been to work with a team of scientists and engineers in order to answer two questions about air pollution: Where do these particles come from, and what are their influences on climate and public health?
CAPS involves around 50 people, including both graduate and undergraduate students, post-doctoral scientists, research manager Albert Presto, and engineering professors Peter Adams and Spyros Pandis. They based their research off of work previously done by a group at the University of Colorado, who wrote a paper describing what several of the air particles looked like. 
CAPS’s work began in the laboratory, using smoke-emitting devices like diesel engines and wood stoves. The emissions are diluted to atmospheric conditions inside a large Teflon bag. Afterward, the bag was exposed to ultraviolet light that acts as a model for the sun, causing a burst of chemical reactions inside the bag. The resultant organic substances were analyzed with mass spectrometers.
The research soon moved into the field. Last summer, the group visited Pittsburgh International Airport and put the emissions from their 737 engines through the same test. Additionally, they traveled to Montana and the National Fire Laboratory to test smoke from forest fires. A press release from [SLANT12]www.cit.cmu.edu[SLANT12] stated that CAPS now has the ability to perform air quality research directly in the area of interest: "The team harnessed new technology — a custom-outfitted box truck with on-board instruments that allow researchers to conduct experiments at places where the pollution exists, rather than having to take everything back at the lab."
Air pollutant particles affect water droplets in clouds. The higher the particle numbers in the atmosphere, the denser the cloud (resulting in the clouds appearing whiter than normal). Dense clouds reflect sunlight at a greater percentage than other clouds, resulting in an overall “cooling effect” on the planet. The change in “[solar] energy due to changes in clouds between 1850 and now is one of the largest uncertainties in climate models,” said Donahue.
Air pollutants may also find ways to return to the surface of the planet, but the form may have huge consequences. Using a one kilogram bottle of Pennzoil, containing thousands of potentially harmful organics, as an example, Donahue explains that if the oil were allowed to spread across Carnegie Mellon’s entire campus, it would evaporate, and there would be about one microgram of the pollutant per every cubic meter of air. Although diluted enough to meet EPA standards, CAPS research has shown that the oil in gas form can be transformed, condense onto particles, and contribute to particulate pollution in what Donahue calls “reactive distillation.” These new, oxidized molecules have very different effects on clouds and probably have very different health effects (an area of current research).
This transformation also means more bad news. It may mean that scientists have underestimated the effect of certain pollutants on the environment, since they’re transformed into entirely new substances after they enter the atmosphere. The new substances affect the chemical pathways that cause climate change and have other adverse effects, meaning that new green technology, such as revamped catalytic converters in cars and diesel particulate filters in factories, might need to be reevaluated. “Is [green technology] going to solve our problem?” wondered Robinson. “Maybe not.”
Donahue, Robinson, and the rest of the team will continue their work later this year by analyzing vehicle emissions in Los Angeles. With the data they’ve compiled, they hope to reach new conclusions on how we affect our planet.

Graduate students at the Heinz College have developed new methods and technologies that have allowed a division of General Electric (GE) to improve its efficiency. As a part of their final project, graduate students Ashish Mehta, Pramod J. Mallapragada, Joseph Morse, Venkatesh Narayan, and Nitika Sharma (all of whom are part of the Master of Information Systems and Management program) developed programs and processes that allow GE’s truck-leasing division to work more efficiently.
The basic premise of their project is to simulate industry-standard processes in the college environment and to get a feel for the way organizations work. This will also help them get some experience before actually going on to their jobs in professional life. According to their adviser, Christopher Kowalsky, an adjunct associate professor in the Heinz College, their project “followed the best practices” of process management and each person played a part similar to one they would play after graduation. Kowalsky said that they “worked as if they were professionals,” with concrete goals and regular evaluations.
The goal of the project was to work with the sponsors at GE to find a way to improve the productivity of GE’s truck-leasing division. This division has two types of customers: the first are long-term customers who draw up contracts for many months or years and whose plans are known well in advance. The methods for dealing with such customers are well-established. The second type of customers includes those with “short cycle sales,” one-time assignments that are often on the spur of the moment. The second type of customer is harder to pursue because the customer’s needs have to be dealt with quickly. GE noticed that these shorter-term customers represented an opportunity for the company to grow. 
It was this opportunity that the team from Heinz analyzed, resulting in the creation of a website allowing salespeople to access GE’s central databases without having to actually be at the office. “[GE] needed a better tool to help its field-deployed sales team connect wirelessly back to their branch offices and the business Customer Care Center,” stated a Heinz College website press release. A solution was needed “to link existing database systems and deliver data in an online application, accessible from mobile handheld devices.” GE’s salespeople can now complete many of their duties by using just their Blackberrys. The team also extended GE’s existing infrastructure to allow their application to work seamlessly. Being able to complete all the required work in the field is essential, as many of GE’s customers are far away from their offices, and this application allowed the salespeople to spend more time selling and less time in the office. It also helps the salespeople work toward realizing GE’s ambitious goals of contacting five times as many customers and doubling their customer base. The Heinz team also came up with processes that allow the necessary data entry to be done quickly and painlessly by reducing the number of pieces of data that salespeople need to input.
As a project, this took up a significant amount of the students’ time. “The team spent, individually, about 23 or 24 hours per person per week over the 14 weeks,” Kowalsky said. The team also worked with GE personnel to ensure that it met its goals and provided the results GE wanted. GE had a transition of the technology at the end of the term and is now employing it productively and also continuing to develop and extend the results of the project.
It is interesting to note that this is just one of many projects that the Heinz College has under development. Previous projects have been carried out while working with companies like Ernst & Young, Bearing Point, and UPMC. Giving students insight into the inner workings of companies provides tangible benefits. “This has been a big win, and a competitive advantage for our commercial team — very helpful during a tough economic time in our industry,” said Brent Russell of GE, as quoted on the Heinz website.

Albert Einstein is best remembered today for his theory of relativity. However, it was his explanation of the photoelectric effect that earned him a Nobel Prize in physics in 1921. The photoelectric effect explained the behavior of light particles in terms of discrete quanta, or amounts of energy. This research greatly accelerated the understanding of the operation of the solar cell, allowing for a number of innovative improvements.
Silicon is the most versatile semiconductor material because operating on a silicon substrate is both easy and well studied. Today, as a result of this ease of use, silicon has become ubiquitous. We see it in our integrated circuits, microprocessors, and also in the solar panels used to harvest the sun’s light energy.
All atoms have a dense nucleus composed of neutrons and protons. This nucleus is surrounded by negatively charged electrons, which are equal in number to the positively charged protons in the nucleus. The atom therefore has no net charge. For most atoms, the outermost orbit of electrons constantly strives to accept or reject electrons so as to contain eight electrons (its most stable state). Silicon occupies a special place in the periodic table of elements, as it has four electrons in the outermost electron orbit. This allows every silicon atom to form bonds with four other silicon atoms by sharing electrons. This sharing of electrons forms a bond known as a covalent bond. By forming four covalent bonds, each silicon atom now has eight electrons.
The simplest solar cell can be devised from just crystalline silicon. When light falls on the surface of the crystalline silicon, the energetic light particles — photons — transfer their energy to the electrons in the covalent bonds of the silicon atoms. Electrons can only leave the bond they are shared in if supplied with sufficient energy. Only photons that are vibrating at a “threshold frequency” or above possess enough energy to knock an electron out of its covalent bond. Any photons at frequencies less than the threshold frequency pass right through the silicon wafer without releasing any electrons. Photons with too much energy release an electron, and the excess energy is dissipated in the wafer as heat. 
Releasing electrons from bonds is important because free electrons constitute the flow of electric current. The electrons that receive sufficient energy from incident photons then break free from the covalent bond and are forced to move in one direction, usually toward one electrode. 
An escaping electron leaves in its place a “hole,” which simply represents the lack of an electron in a bond. These holes, which are atoms missing an electron, migrate toward the opposite electrode anti-parallel to the direction of motion of the electrons. The movement of electrons generates an electric current, which ultimately is the basis for getting power from solar cells.
Solar cells are made of a number of layers. These layers all serve various purposes. The layers typically include a protective layer, a non-reflective layer, contacts, and doped silicon or other light-reactive material.
Efficiency is defined as the ratio of output electric energy to the incident light energy. A silicon wafer alone produces very little electric energy, usually on the order of less than 5 percent. This efficiency can be improved by a number of methods. The best option is to introduce certain impurities into the silicon crystal. These impurities can have their electrons freed relatively easily, and are usually trace amounts of boron or phosphorous. Reducing the amount of incident light reflected by the surface of silicon (crystalline silicon is highly reflective) also improves the efficiency of the cell. The first solar cell (made of selenium instead of silicon) had an efficiency of around 1 percent. As more was learned about the chemistry involved, better materials began to be used. With time, the doped silicon cells reached efficiencies of around 25 percent, as stated on www.PhysOrg.com. While this might seem like a low efficiency when compared with other energy sources, this is a considerably high efficiency among the solar cell technologies. Recently, other elements and combinations of elements have been used to manufacture cells. These materials include complex compounds such as gallium arsenide and cadmium telluride.
Today, the highest efficiency achieved is 43 percent, as reported by www.PhysOrg.com. These cells consist of a number of different light-capturing layers, allowing the cells to capture a broader spectrum of incident light. This would mean that photons having lower frequencies may also be used to generate electron-hole pairs
According to Nature, the Earth receives as much energy in one hour as is required by humans for an entire year. Efforts by nations around the world to harness this “free energy” are picking up. The advantages of this source of energy are plenty; for example, there is no fuel spent and there are no noxious exhaust gases to damage the environment. With our fast-dwindling fossil fuel reserves, it is becoming increasingly clear how important a renewable source of energy is for the survival of energy-dependent mankind. Today, of the many renewable energy sources available, solar energy is the most researched, owing largely to solar panels. At the rate research is progressing, it seems comfortably positioned at the top of the stack of renewable energy sources.

The Internet connects people around the world — an unparalleled network of information about almost everything, accessible almost everywhere. But can it fabricate a disease?
The Morgellons Research Foundation states Morgellons is characterized mainly by the belief that fibers are emerging from the skin. Symptoms of itching, biting and crawling sensations also exist, as do skin lesions. There are even more ambiguous symptoms to describe the affliction, including changes in cognition, memory loss, mood disturbance, and serious neurological manifestations. The fibers supposedly produced from individuals who had Morgellons have been analyzed by scientists in the Tulsa Police Crime Lab, and did not match anything in an FBI database, meaning more research is to be done. These fibers are of diferent colors and appear in bundles. After tests were run under the direction of lab director Mark Boese, it was concluded that the fibers could have been a byproduct of some organism, although it was not stated which. 
Many people with Morgellons claim they feel these fibers under their skin: some in large patches on their back, and others in small places, like on the toes. A few report pain and disfigurement. There is one common idea stated by patients: these fibers cause enough damage to change the lives of the sufferers.
Other causes have been proposed to explain the fibers. Some believe they may be caused by a certain bacterium or parasite, and others believe they are created by the body in a form of an immune response. Many researchers have proposed their own explanations, but often without sufficient evidence to support their claims.
Morgellons is a controversial disease; at least 13,000 families suffer from it, but the actual number is thought to be even higher.
However, its origins are as uncertain as its classification in the medical world. The name Morgellons can be traced back to 2001 to a woman named Mary Leitao, whose two-year-old son developed lip sores and noted feelings of “bugs.” After examining the sores, she found that they contained a number of fibers growing from them. However, her claims were dubious; many doctors did not find anything unusual with the sores, even as Leitao continued to note the emergence of more fibers from her son. Some doctors suggested Leitao suffered from a syndrome where a parent pretends a child is sick for attention. Nevertheless, Leitao continued to research the disease more and eventually formed the Morgellons Research Foundation.
Using the Internet, individuals can diagnose their own symptoms if they feel they have a disease. Without proper medical training, and with the panic that may accompany the belief of having a disease, it is likely that many could have found symptoms of Morgellons online that matched their own. They would have then concluded they had the disease. As more and more people searched for their symptoms and found Morgellons, it became more widely known. However, at the rate information spreads around the Internet, some believe it is likely Morgellons is simply an Internet meme that spread quickly but is not entirely true.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are currently researching Morgellons and have not yet confirmed if it is a real, infectious disease. However, most medical professionals do not believe Morgellons is a real disease, and instead note its similarity to some psychological disorders. One of the most prominent theories explains Morgellons as being delusional parasitosis. This is a psychiatric disorder where patients believe they are infected with parasites and may even feel them under their skin, a condition known as formication. Patients may also attempt to remove these imaginary parasites by picking away at their skin, explaining the lesions that are found in those afflicted with Morgellons. Some are also known to collect the removed parasites and fibers from under the skin as proof of disease and present them to physicians. Those with Morgellons might show their fibers to their doctors. Morgellons is also believed to be confused with true skin disorders such as different forms of dermatitis. In addition, real parasites, like scabies, can cause similar symptoms. The scabies parasite buries under the skin, causing itching.
While Morgellons cannot yet be discarded as a fabrication, its strongest support comes from its victims instead of researchers. Morgellons must provide true scientific evidence before it can be accepted by the medical community.

Google pulling out of China
Google has threatened to end www.google.cn in China over concerns about censorship and hacking. Hacking targeted a flaw in Microsoft Internet Explorer, violating Internet user privacy, while censorship is a long-running dispute regarding human rights. Yahoo supports the decision, but Microsoft has no plans to exit China. Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer disagrees with the situation: “There are attacks every day. I don’t think there was anything unusual, so I don’t understand.”

Innovation in e-book screens
Current e-book readers only display colors in black and white and aren’t useful for viewing color magazines. Pixel Qi is a hybrid display screen that can display colors when a backlight is on. When the backlight is off, the e-book displays black and white colors, uses 70 percent less power, and is readable in direct sunlight. It can also be used in devices like netbooks or tablets. Pixel Qi CEO Mary Lou Jepsen plans on seeing this technology sometime in the first quarter of this year.

Regarded as the champion of the civil rights movement and one of the greatest orators of all time, Martin Luther King Jr. was truly an individual who changed history. His masterful speeches motivated millions, while his non-violent method of protest ushered in a new era of peaceful public movements for change. In an effort to keep his legacy alive and to commemorate his life and accomplishments, the Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebrations at Carnegie Mellon promise to be both an informative and appreciative look at how far the country has come and a reminder of what work must still be done to truly ensure equality in our society today.
While many students at Carnegie Mellon have been celebrating Martin Luther King Jr. Day with a half day off from school for as long as they can remember, most are probably unaware of the struggles behind its being established as a national holiday. A bill to establish King’s birthday, Jan. 15, as a national holiday was twice introduced to Congress, only passing the second time. Some states, such as Illinois, Massachusetts, and Connecticut, had already established state-wide holidays commemorating the activist’s birth, but the Southern Christian Leadership Conference collected 3 million signatures in order to press the government to make the day a national holiday. The first attempt was stalled in Congress for eight years until it received the support of President Jimmy Carter, though it was ultimately defeated in the House by a margin of five votes.
King’s widow, Coretta Scott King, was not disheartened. She worked a political angle, garnering the support of governors and mayors across the country. In 1980, Stevie Wonder also lent his talents to the cause; his song “Happy Birthday” motivated the public support for the holiday to be made national. With 6 million signatures in favor of the holiday, the second bill was passed by the House but faced an even tougher fight in the Senate. At last, Martin Luther King Jr. Day was signed into law in November 1983 by President Reagan, though it was not officially celebrated until 1986. Even then, the holiday was still not celebrated by all states under that name. Many protests occurred through the years to rectify this, one of the most famous being the moving of Super Bowl XXVII from Arizona to California. At long last, though it might seem surprising given it how recently it occurred, all 50 states celebrated the holiday in 2000. This year marks the first decade in which all 50 states have joined in the festivities.
Celebrations happening on campus and in the Pittsburgh area this year involve a medley of the arts as a tribute to King. Just as the arts have been a boon to the civil rights movement in the past, they continue to provide a sounding board and a venue for new ideas to be expressed.
The arts have always been integral to the spread of hope and belief, as well as effective at rallying people to action at injustices suffered. It was no different during King’s protests. While Wonder’s hit song helped to propel the second bill for Martin Luther King Jr. Day through Congress, it was by no means the only contribution the arts had in the civil rights movement. Other famous songs of protest include Bob Marley’s “Blowin’ in the Wind” and “Eve of Destruction” by Barry McGuire, not to mention countless other protest songs chanted at marches and demonstrations. To this day, popular songs are still used to protest political dealings, current events, and most often war.
Rhetoric has also held a treasured place in civil rights history thanks to King. His famous speeches not only inspired his listeners with their content, but also by their adroit choice of words and skillful presentation. Over the course of his involvement with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference as well as independently, King’s command of his audience and infallible oratory acumen allowed him to win over countless supporters and earn the admiration of many others. According to AmericanRhetoric.com, King has three speeches in the 100 greatest speeches of the 20th century. His “I Have a Dream” speech holds the number-one spot, while the two others make the top 50 and one of them, “I’ve Been to the Mountaintop,” is in the top 15.
Through music and voice, the civil rights movement relied on the arts to help carry its message. Now, the tradition of the arts as a medium for ideas and new thought is continued in Pittsburgh and on campus. At Carnegie Mellon, the observation of the holiday will kick off at noon today with singing, verse, and interpretation from the School of Drama and Music in Kirr Commons in the University Center. Next will follow President Jared Cohon’s State of Diversity address in McConomy Auditorium. At 1:30 p.m., high school students and students who have received awards from the creative writing program, Student Affairs, and the Office of the President will read works in the Rangos Hall in which they discuss their personal experiences of race and discrimination. Also included in the festivities are a puppet show and a candlelit procession occurring later in the day. (For a full schedule of events taking place at the university for Martin Luther King Jr. Day, please see the front page.)
In the Pittsburgh area, many activities are being held to celebrate diversity. Oakland will host its eighth annual Martin Luther King Jr. Day in the Park, which will consist of ice skating, sledding, and art projects in Schenley Park on Monday from 1 to 4 p.m. Other areas around the city will hold various events: The Carnegie Science Center will offer free admission, the Campbell Memorial Chapel at Chatham University will also offer a program of spoken word, song, and dance, as well as many others places around Pittsburgh. Many venues are also collecting donations for the Haiti relief effort as a tribute to the work of King.
East Liberty has long been famous for its celebrations of the holiday. This year, the Kelly-Strayhorn Theatre featured the performance East Liberty Celebrates Martin Luther King, Jr.! on Saturday. The event was free and combined the talents of many local dance, theater, and hip-hop groups to form its tribute.
Let Freedom Sing! is also another fun event going on during the holiday, taking place on Monday starting at 7 p.m. at the Franklin Regional High School in Murrysville. The event features a musical tribute to King, and while free, any donations will go toward building a Martin Luther King Jr. monument on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.
While students may be happy to have no classes after 12:30 p.m., it is important to remember why exactly these celebrations are being held. Though King was a brilliant orator and someone who believed in equality, he was also courageous as seen by leading peaceful protests despite fierce opposition. While having classes until lunchtime might come as an unwelcome change for some, the activities happening on campus and all around the city ensure that students will not only be able to find a fun way to spend their afternoon, but also honor the person whose great sense of conviction, skill, and bravery gave so much more to this country than a free Monday in January.

It’s winter in Pittsburgh, and that means that the ground is covered in snow and ice, effectively shutting up most of Carnegie Mellon’s student body inside until the spring thaw. Instead of hibernating for the rest of winter, try one of these snow-friendly activities that can be found around the city.
Take a glide on the wild side
Well, maybe not the “wild side,” exactly, but gliding around the ice rinks at nearby Schenley Park or downtown Pittsburgh’s PPG Plaza is a perfect activity for a snowy night. Skating can be a great way to bond with your friends, especially if you need to hold onto them to stay upright. This also makes it a great spot for a date. Schenley Park offers several college ID nights throughout the week, giving students a small discount and making the price of admission $3 (at all other times, the cost for adults is $4). With the cost of renting skates ($2.50), this is an affordable activity that’s great for winter — especially since it leaves enough money leftover to buy a steamy cup of cocoa and still stay under $10 total. For more information on ice skating in Pittsburgh, visit www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/parks/schenleyskatingrink.htm or www.ppgplace.com/rink.
Get away for the weekend — on skis
Pittsburgh itself isn’t a great area for skiing or snowboarding, but going on a weekend trip to ski proves to be easy and affordable, as there are many ski slopes within about two hours of the city. The closest, Boyce Park, is located about 20 minutes away in nearby Monroeville. The rates are fairly low, especially since its proximity to Carnegie Mellon does not include the cost of a pricey hotel. The downside? The snow isn’t always great, and it may lack excitement for more experienced skiers. For anyone looking to actually get away, Blue Knob Ski Resort is about a two-hour drive away and is home to the highest skiable mountain in the state according to the resort’s website, www.blueknob.com. Rates are reasonable and vary depending on time (the resort offers both four-hour and full-day passes). This could be either a weekend trip or a day trip, but either way, it’s a great way to enjoy the snow. As another option, Seven Springs Mountain Resort boasts the largest skiing area in the state. As an added bonus, this resort has other activities on site like bowling, indoor swimming, shopping, and nightclubs (for guests over 21, of course) as well as a few different kinds of lodging, including hotels and cabins. All three locations offer ski school for beginners, so even if you’ve never skied, this is still a great option while the snow lasts.
Take a sleigh ride with your sweetie
Nothing beats cuddling up with your significant other when it’s cold outside, but instead of hiding from the snow, take advantage of it! Horse-drawn sleigh rides are only available in the winter, and now is the perfect time to take one. Most of the sleigh rides nearby are still a bit of a drive away, but this romantic activity will be much more impressive than studying each other’s chemistry notes. Seven Springs (see above) offers sleigh rides in addition to skiing and snowboarding. Most sleigh ride operations stopped at the start of the new year, which makes this activity even more special now.
Snowless activities for snowphobics
Sick of the cold and hate the snow? That doesn’t mean that you should stay in your room until Carnival. There are plenty of fun indoor activities around Pittsburgh, many of which are free or discounted for students. Pittsburgh is home to numerous art and history museums, all of which provide the opportunity for a relaxing day out. Phipps Conservatory, which is located on the other side of Flagstaff Hill, will help you forget that it’s snowy outside with its tropical plants and warm temperatures. On campus and off, there are indoor sports and fitness activities, like indoor tennis, basketball, and yoga, as well as opportunities to watch sporting events. Try attending a Carnegie Mellon athletic event on campus or a Penguins game at the Mellon Arena. Student tickets are available during the pre-game student rush, cutting the ticket cost to $20.

It’s a new year, a time of celebration, and that means we forget all the bad and fondly recall only the good from 2009. Last year is no more, and to prove it many people mark the occasion by making New Year’s resolutions. These are statements meant to inspire everyone to accomplish some sort of goal over the course of 2010. Sometimes people stick with them and lose those extra 20 pounds but most people forget about them by the end of January and dig into their super fudge deluxe ice cream with fervor. As a result of this, let’s take a shot at deconstructing some of the more common recurring resolutions and why people fail at keeping up with them. Hold on tight, people, this could get dicey.
Spend more time with family and friends
The resolution: This is a classic. According to a poll done by www.newsfeedresearcher.com, 50 percent of Americans vow this every year. And why not? There are 24 hours in a day, and it would be nice to cut a slice out of every week to reach out and reconnect with people you are supposedly close to. 
Why we fail: Ever come back after a time away from home and immediately wish you were gone again? Yeah, that’s why people can’t spend more than a few minutes a day with their families. Don’t forget the fact that you are the most important person in your life. Alone time is key to staying sane in this world.
Keep fit, lose weight, eat healthier
The resolution: Let’s face it, Americans are fat. Sometimes even ridiculously fat. In fact, according to The New York Times health guide, roughly two-thirds of Americans are considered overweight or obese. Riding a bike, walking some odd miles each day, or even eating an apple instead of that cobbler are great ways to get rid of that gut.
Why we fail: Nobody actually wants to be fat, yet every year there are more and more unhealthy people around. People just cannot control themselves. You tell yourself one cookie per week, then it ends up being two or 12. You lose five pounds, then celebrate with chocolate cake. It’s as if people are predisposed to obsessing over the unhealthiest foods. 
Learn something new
The resolution: Working on a new skill is never a bad idea. We are curious people at heart who enjoy experiencing new things and becoming talented in different ways. The world is filled with interesting theories, items, and places that are just begging for you to learn about them.
Why we fail: The problem with this one is that it is too broad. For example, did you know that the Times Square ball that drops every year weighs 11,875 pounds and descends 77 feet starting at 11:59 p.m.? No, you didn’t, so you just learned something new. Has the resolution been accomplished? Technically it has, so by mid-January people will forget their ultimate dream of learning how to build the Titanic out of toothpicks and go about life as if their resolution was never even made.
Here’s to hoping your New Year’s resolution is a little more attainable so your 2010 doesn’t turn into a tailspin or flameout of all your hopes and dreams.

Among the mirrored rooms of the Mattress Factory, multiple artists have collaborated to unveil their portrayals of post-Warholian human depiction. In short, Likeness is anything but boring. Don’t expect to see formal paintings of royals dressed in glittering garb; instead, modern technology and limitless creativity bring this series of art to the white-washed brick rooms of the North Side gallery.
Jim Campbell, one of the artists featured in the exhibit, incorporates strings of LED lights to produce his “Liz Walking: A Distillation Portrait.” With alternating flashes of the LED lights that hang about an inch from the wall, a shadow is produced that looks like a person walking, but never moving forward. So deceiving is this shadow that one standing from a distance might think there is actually someone walking in place behind a white sheet.
Even as visitors travel from floor to floor via elevator, the art never leaves. On the ceiling of the elevator, a screen of monochromatically shaded LED lights (“Fathers of the Elevator,” also by Jim Campbell) forms the faces of several U.S. presidents, looking down on viewers as they descend to another floor of interesting pieces.
Paul DeMarinis’s piece, titled “Dust,” should be classified as “living art,” considering a big part of the artwork involves a transformation. Here’s the process: Pictures of missing children paired together are scanned onto phosphorescent powder, which is able to conserve light and can therefore project a negative of the image. The powder doesn’t last long, though, and as the minutes pass, the images warp and distort, eventually disintegrating to the dust they were formed from.
“Self Portrait as a PowerPoint Proposal for an Amusement Park Ride,” by Jonn Herschend, tells a story by giving the spectator a realistic environment. The exhibit features a room with a running PowerPoint presentation, a “Wet Floor” sign sitting beside buckets catching water from a seemingly leaky roof — which you’re not entirely sure is part of the piece — and a janitor’s closet slightly ajar.
Joseph Mannino’s series “The Space Between,” features dozens of photographs, each of a single person with letters written on fingers or knuckles, and an overall aim to blur the separation among artist, subject, and audience. The photos are cut in half, thus creating two images, with some displaying phrases like ”stay true,” “wet dreams,” and “got milk?”
Other pieces in the exhibit include Tony Oursler’s “Vampiric Battle,” where he recreates our obsession with looking younger and the measures we will go through to get the desired effect. Nikki S. Lee’s “Layers” series features a drawing of someone of a different ethnicity layered over a drawn self-portrait. Greta Pratt’s digital print collection, “Liberty,” features everyday Americans dressed as Lady Liberty and working so they can come closer to the famous American dream.
Take a trip over to the Mattress Factory, check out the work of these seven artists, and your definition of “portrait” will never be the same again.
Likeness will continue at the Mattress Factory until March 21.

“The things an American who is abroad for a very long time misses ... weren’t the things you were supposed to miss,” wrote Adam Gopnik, a correspondent for The New Yorker living in Paris during the 1990s. “We are supposed to come to Europe for leisure, sunshine, a more civilized pace, for slowness of various kinds. America we are supposed to miss for its speed, its friendliness, for the independence of its people and the individualism of their lives. Yet these were not the things I missed....”
It’s true. During my four-month stay this fall in Grenoble, France, as an intern at the Xerox Research Centre Europe, I was more conscious of missing the little things in shared culture more than any grandiose ideals of the American way. The big stuff is there: French people consume American media, all the way from Pixar’s Up (re-branded in French as Là-Haut) to “Jingle Bells” (playing in English on the radio). It was the smaller points of reference that I found myself wishing for: being able to casually mention a weekend drive on I-80, for example, without having to first explain the U.S. interstate highway system, the terrain of central Pennsylvania, and what it feels like to drive across it.
Few things either tie us together or keep us apart as much as geography. If anyone in France asked where I was from, I typically started by answering “Cleveland.” I would start zooming out until something made a connection. If not Cleveland, I was from Ohio. If not Ohio, I was from a place halfway between New York and Chicago. If not that — and this became mostly my standard answer — I was from the United States, “in the center, but a little to the northeast.”
The situation was reversed when my new acquaintances tried to tell me where they were from. Even after nine years of French classes, I found I’d only studied the “big” places in France. I had heard of Grenoble before living there, but it wasn’t until I arrived that I knew anything about the actual city, its region, or most other French places. When I met a new person, I tried to keep the name of his or her hometown in my mind long enough to get back to a map and look it up. At least I wasn’t alone in this problem: I was once part of a conversation in which a girl from the northern city of Lille was defending her region against two southerners, who had lumped it in with Paris.
Grenoble itself presents an astonishing range of geography for the outdoorsy newcomer to explore, a lot like a few days I once spent in Boulder, Colo. A city in southwestern France about half the size of Pittsburgh, Grenoble is squished into two river valleys in the shape of a Y at the foot of the Alps. The flat part, laced with 200 miles of bike lanes and trails, is a haven for bicycle commuters. Half an hour on a local tram puts you at the beginning of one of the mountain ranges and their hiking trails, while for an hour on a regional bus you can be at a couple of alpine ski resorts.
During my out-and-about time, I became aware of an underlying difference between the French and American approaches to public transportation. I mentioned one day at lunch to my co-worker, Claude, my amazement at how easy it was to get around — especially on the national rail network, which ran multiple trains per day from Grenoble to any destination I could think of. In my co-worker’s view, what makes this possible is that in France, certain services are deemed too important to not have, so they are provided by the government and funded by the people through taxes. The idea that a rail service should be profitable — or forced to be profitable — seemed absurd.
The downside to funding large public services is that in France there’s a 19.6 percent value-added tax on almost everything. On the one hand, it helps pay for increased public services like rail networks, vacation time, or health care; on the other, the costs of consumer products or services in Grenoble are consistently about 50 percent above what they are in Pittsburgh. Debating the pros and cons of each of these systems is a complicated matter. On the occasions when the subject came up among my co-workers or acquaintances, the only conclusion I was ever able to draw was that it’s impossible to just consider health care or prices or vacation time alone — the way each of these things functions in American or French society is tightly bound up in the cultural system as a whole.
One of the most basic reasons for living abroad is to experience something “different.” Though living in France meant losing a large amount of shared experiences and cultural context with the people around me, it was also the best way for me to start learning new ones. As the weeks went by, I became more integrated into French life and started to rebuild a common, everyday framework of experiences. More importantly, I stopped comparing the experiences to their American counterparts. As Gopnik had discovered before me, I didn’t miss America’s speed, independence, and individualism — I learned to ignore them.

When Vampire Weekend released their self-titled debut album in January 2008, they were already riding the hype from the blogosphere. The album went on to sell half a million copies in the United States. Now, two years after Vampire Weekend, their sophomore album, Contra, might just top that record. Currently, it sits comfortably at number one on the iTunes Top Albums chart.
Signed to XL Recordings, the foursome hails from Columbia University, a factor that sometimes lands them the criticism of being preppy white kids taking from African sounds. Some even go so far as to accuse the band of ripping off Paul Simon’s Graceland in their first album. Despite this negative backlash, Vampire Weekend stays true to both their Afro-pop influences and upper-middle-class backgrounds in Contra, as if to tell off the skeptics who doubted them.
Oftentimes, a sophomore album can venture too far from the debut, sometimes to the point where listeners mistake the album to be by an entirely different band. Other times, there is no progression between the first and second albums, leaving listeners with the feeling that they’re hearing the same songs, just with different lyrics. In Contra, Vampire Weekend does a wonderful job of standing firmly on that precariously thin line.
In this new album, fans will not only recognize the sound that is so clearly Vampire Weekend, but also experience something new: the band’s curious dabbling in synthetic sounds, as evidenced in “California English,” in which the band uses pitch correction. “Diplomat’s Son” uses a reggae beat while combining M.I.A. samples with classic rock. “Giving Up the Gun” contains wooden percussion instruments as well as synthetic dings. The song “White Sky” also includes a familiar synthetic beat repeated from the band’s debut album Vampire Weekend.
Vampire Weekend released two singles from Contra titled “Horchata” and “Cousins.” While “Horchata” is cleverly written (Ezra Koenig, the band’s lead singer and guitarist, plays with multisyllabic words, rhyming “horchata” with “balaclava”) and fresh, “Cousins” leaves a lot to be desired. The song does not move forward, further evidenced by the music video, in which the band moves back and forth in an alley.
The album concludes with “I Think UR a Contra,” an echoing, somber ballad supplemented by the melancholy sounds of a piano. “I had a feeling once,” Koenig sings to an ex, “that you and I could tell each other everything.” He ends the album with the lines “Never pick sides, never choose between two, but I just wanted you.” It would seem, in this album, that the quartet has matured. So whether you love them or love to hate them, give the album a listen. It’s worth the time.

Long before the airing of Monk, another eccentric private investigator fought crime using his own unique methods. Residing at No. 221B Baker Street, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s character Sherlock Holmes is possibly the most famous fictional detective in the world. Holmes prowled through the streets of London and across the pages of 56 short stories and four novels, as well as over 211 films, and this past year he made his most recent appearance in Guy Ritchie’s Sherlock Holmes.
Robert Downey Jr. joins the list of 76 actors who have portrayed Sherlock Holmes in the past. Becoming one of the most depicted movie characters in history is a daunting challenge in itself. As with other directors who were faced with the task of converting a well-loved story into a movie, Ritchie dealt with the problem of creating a new production while remaining true to the story itself.
Sherlock Holmes begins with the Baker Street detective and his good friend and chronicler Dr. Watson, played by Jude Law, preventing a human sacrifice by a mysterious cult. Good old Inspector Lestrade shows up, late as usual, to apprehend a key figure in the cult: Lord Blackwell, prominent in high society, politics, and apparently witchcraft as well. Blackwell is executed after delivering mysterious words of warning to Holmes, who takes the foreboding message nonchalantly and falls into a fit of boredom in the weeks following the arrest. Blackwell is duly hanged, and Watson himself declares the lord dead, but the sentence turns out to be not as binding as expected.
This film can be characterized as an attempt to turn the classic story of Sherlock Holmes into a true Hollywood action-packed adventure, to the point of Ritchie adding a few pieces of his own. All the big-league characters of Holmes lore are present, including Irene Adler ­— played by Rachel McAdams — who was always known to Holmes as “the” woman, and his arch-nemesis, Professor Moriarty.
Ritchie has included many aspects of the books in his movie, including several scenes from the anthologies. When bored, Downey Jr.’s Holmes does indeed shoot a patriotic V.R. into his room’s wall, he tests poisons on his own dog, and he retains his boxing prowess and connections among the London criminal underworld.
On the infamous Irene Adler, a romantic tension and near make-out scene between her and Holmes was inevitable in a movie version. As the most mysterious and dangerous female character, her performance was mildly interesting to follow, but not enthralling or as haunting or memorable as the original character would lead the audience to believe. “By far, it was one of the worst acting jobs by a leading lady I’ve seen in a long time,” Aurelia Henderson, a first-year in H&SS majoring in creative writing announced. “Nothing about her was bad-ass.”
The plot was intriguing and far more interesting in its final reveal as a story of logic and lust for power, a web spun by the mortal but intimidating hands of Professor Moriarty rather than a fanciful black magic theme. A conflict not much remarked upon in the books became a central issue in the movie — that of Watson leaving bachelorhood and adventures behind to live a quiet married life. This new issue effectively brought Holmes’ and Watson’s characters and relationships to light, allowing the audience to better know them while providing an opportunity for wonderful banter and quick wit between the two friends.
Amidst pistol and fist fights, seductions, and journeys to the high waters of both treason and the Thames, this film presents a highly exaggerated version of the mystery classic, which, though giving new audiences a false image of the books themselves, is entertaining.

Dear Rohit,
I think I might be too picky when it comes to dating. I never seem to like guys around campus. Sometimes I think it’s better just to be alone than to settle for someone, but what if my expectations are too high?
—Seeing No One Better
Dear SNOB,
Firstly, you are not the only one with this problem. Carnegie Mellon has a history with this sort of thing. If you’re searching for a relationship, I don’t think there’s any reason to waste your time with someone you’re just not feeling a connection with. It’s hard enough to find somebody worth dating, and when you factor in your orientation, college, and personal tastes, the dating pool continues to shrink. 
Are you looking exclusively at Carnegie Mellon? There’s a whole city of boys out there just waiting to meet someone like you. I’d also suggest looking around online — you may be surprised at how much more open people can be about their preferences on the Internet. You shouldn’t really be worried about having high standards. It’s good to be picky, but you should always remember to give people a chance. You never know, the one you supposedly settled for could turn out to be the one you were looking for all along!
Someone special is near,
—Rohit
Dear Rohit,
There is this guy that keeps showing up everywhere I go. He doesn’t talk to me or anything, but it’s kind of unnerving to see him all the time. I don’t know what I should tell him because I don’t know if he’s doing it on purpose or what his intentions are. Can you help?
—Scared of Stalkers
Dear SOS,
I am here to help you. That’s what I am paid for. Well, actually, I don’t get paid, but that’s not the point. How many times has Mr. Stalker crossed your path? If it’s more than five times a week, the probability of that being a coincidence is negligible, as our fine statistic students would say. 
If so, you probably do have a stalker on your hands. You should have one of your guy friends, preferably a football player if that is an option, have a talk with him and figure out what his issue is. 
Maybe he’s harmless and wants to be friends but is too shy to approach you. It is up to you to decide whether to pursue that friendship or not. If he continues to bother you, do let me know.
Be safe and sensible,
—Rohit

100 Years Ago
Jan. 19, 1910
A column on student activities and eligibility states that “men come here primarily to learn, and not to engage in theatricals and concerts.” I have to disagree. I primarily came here to play ultimate Frisbee and write funny articles for the widely read school newspaper.
50 Years Ago
Jan. 20, 1960
A special announcement declares the opening of a new department of graphic arts that was established at Carnegie Tech. That was it. The whole paper that week was this announcement, pretty much just a flyer. The 1960 staff apparently needed a week off to recover from the first week of classes.
25 Years Ago
Jan. 22, 1985
A review for Beverly Hills Cop appears in this issue with the writer praising Eddie Murphy’s role and the film as “solid entertainment.” I agree with the author on that point. Unfortunately, that was just about the last time Murphy was in a good movie.
10 Years Ago
Jan. 24, 2000
A blurb in the Forum section this week declares that The Tartan has unveiled its first redesign in 10 years. It also urges readers to submit feedback about the new design. Hey, did you know the current Tartan was just recently redesigned? And that this right here is the first article to mention it?
5 Years Ago
Jan. 17, 2005
A writer for the Forum section this week rants a bit about the redundant nature of award shows on television. Apparently, there were 40 in 2004. Reading the article, it looks as if she’s out of the running for Best Breakthrough Forum Writer, too.

A Sports article praises the Steelers for making it to their seventh Super Bowl, which they won in a game that I enjoyed watching until the end. Building upon that accomplishment, the Steelers boldly decided to miss the playoffs this year.

For most people at Carnegie Mellon, Tepper is the name of our school of business, but on Wall Street, David Alan Tepper is considered one of the best hedge fund managers in the United States.
In its annual earnings report, Tepper’s hedge fund firm, Appaloosa Management, recorded about $7 billion in profits in 2009, making it the highest-performing hedge fund firm in 2009. Tepper himself will take home a well-earned $2.5 billion bonus for his performance and leadership.
But Tepper’s success can also be considered to be a sign of much broader economic recovery. While the collapse of former giants like Bank of America and Citigroup in early 2009 sent most investors running, Tepper consistently bought the banks’ then-almost -worthless shares. 
By the end of March, shares in Bank of America alone accounted for more than 60 percent of Appaloosa’s portfolio. While his investment tactics perplexed and worried many of his peers and clients, Tepper was making a bet on economic recovery to revitalize these banks. 
His bet paid off, and by September 2009, Bank of America and Citigroup shares increased 330 percent and 223 percent, respectively.
“David Tepper’s recent success should most of all teach students that confidence in one’s judgment is more important in making risk-based decisions than the consensus of opinions by experts and pundits,” said Milton Cofield, executive director of the undergraduate business program at Carnegie Mellon.
Risky investments are where Tepper has had the most success over his career. After earning his MBA from Carnegie Mellon’s Graduate School of Industrial Administration in 1982, Tepper joined the treasury department at then-struggling Republic Steel in Ohio. After the company was bought by the LTV Corporation in 1984, Tepper became a credit analyst at Keystone Funds located in Boston, and in 1985, he joined the research department at Goldman Sachs, working in the newly established high-yield bond group. 
In general, high-yield bonds, or “junk” bonds, are characterized by their low investment grades at the time of purchase, and thus typically offer higher yields to attract investors. In the 1980s, most high-yield bonds were thought of as “fallen angels,” or bonds that were originally issued with an investment grade rating, but had since been downgraded to a lower rating due to financial troubles at the issuing company. By the end of 1986, Tepper was the head of the high-yield bond desk at Goldman Sachs. In 1992, he left Goldman Sachs to start Appaloosa Management.
“I think after being passed over for partner too many times, he just quit and started doing his own thing,” senior economics major Luke Johnson said. “The man knows his own worth.”
“[Tepper] can analyze a business and he can say whether that business will actually go bankrupt, or if it is only having temporary financial problems, but has a strong business plan,” business master’s student Kanwaljit Chugh said.
Given Tepper’s predilection for seeking out distressed companies that need investment the most, it should come as no surprise that he is also a big philanthropist. In 2004, Tepper donated $55 million to Carnegie Mellon’s Graduate School of Industrial Administration, which then officially renamed itself as the David A. Tepper School of Business. Tepper has also made several large gifts to his alma mater, the University of Pittsburgh, including several undergraduate scholarships and grants.
Despite his wealth, Tepper comes from a middle-class background and still prefers a modest lifestyle. Despite the fact that they have over $12 billion under management, Appaloosa has its headquarters in a small three-story office building in the town of Chatham, N.J. Tepper himself still lives in Chatham in the same two-story home that he bought back in 1991. 
The Independent aptly described him as one “who eschews the glitz of Manhattan or the gargantuan houses of Connecticut in favor of nights at home in New Jersey with his wife Marlene and their three children, and for coaching his kids’ baseball, soccer, and softball.”

Carnegie Mellon students joined with the Pittsburgh community Monday to celebrate and remember the life and achievements of Martin Luther King Jr. As University President Jared Cohon explained in his address, Martin Luther King Jr. Day is, “something other than just a day off.” With events ranging from panels to processions to puppet shows, Carnegie Mellon came together to recognize and embrace the diversity King once dreamed of.
The events started immediately after classes with a “Community and Choral Tribute” in Kirr Commons by students in the schools of drama and music. Performances honoring King included song, verse, dance, and personal interpretation. Readings included portions of President Obama’s “Letter to My Daughters” and Maya Angelou’s “Million Man March.”
At the conclusion of the tribute, students, faculty, and the community were invited to attend Cohon’s address, “State of Diversity at Carnegie Mellon,” in which Cohon discussed the importance of embracing the differences intrinsic to students within the university. Carnegie Mellon’s growth in the area of diversity is determined based on yearly “diversity reports.” The 2009 diversity report states that the number of enrolled under-represented minority undergraduate students rose, as did the percentage of international undergraduate students (currently at 5 percent and 15 percent, respectively). These numbers have risen steadily since the first report was issued in 2002. “We are a more diverse university, I would claim, in every way,” Cohon said. “We want to embrace diversity in all dimensions.”
Following Cohon’s address, local high school students joined current Carnegie Mellon students to read personal narratives concerning racial difference and discrimination. All participating students are recipients of Martin Luther King Jr. writing awards sponsored by the Carnegie Mellon Creative Writing Program, Student Affairs, and the Office of the President.    
In another of the day's events, community members were invited to join an open discussion hosted by the President's Diversity Advisory Council (DAC). The discussion offered an opportunity to gather feedback on a document drafted this year titled "A Guiding Principle for University Culture." The document focuses on further engaging talent that represents variety, as well as creating significant and authentic exchanges between students of different backgrounds. Panelists included Cohon; Janel Sutkus, director of Educational Research; Ray Obenza, from Human Resources in the Software Engineering Institute; John Lehoczky, dean of the College of Humanities and Social Sciences; Shernell Smith, coordinator of Student Development in Campus Affairs; and Eric Wu, a sophomore in the School of Computer Science.
Children belonging to the Children’s School and the larger community were also included in the day’s celebrations. Holden Puppets presented a puppet show performance of World Neighborhood in the University Center. 
Later in the day, a candlelight procession was organized with the intention of honoring and remembering King and his symbolic march for civil rights. Attendees were encouraged to remember the struggles and trials overcome in the name of freedom and equality, while reflecting on the power of non-violent protest.
The celebrations came to a close with a keynote address and reception in the University Center. James Cone, the Charles Augustus Briggs distinguished professor from the Union Theological Seminary in New York delivered a speech titled “Nobody Knows de Trouble I’ve Seen.” Cone specifically discussed the dichotomy between King's message and how he is often portrayed in contemporary culture. Carnegie Mellon student speakers, senior English and statistics major Kristine McPherson and junior mechanical engineering major Francisco Santiago, joined him in addressing issues of discrimination and diversity.

After the news of the Haitian earthquake broke last Thursday evening, a call to action sounded across the Carnegie Mellon campus. Initiated by student government, this call took a non-traditional form — an e-mail was sent to all student organizations and an emergency meeting was scheduled for the same evening. “Student government had been working on the textbook flea market, but then Haiti happened, so we had to get moving,” said Student Body President Rotimi Abimbola. “I really thought it was important that it be a united effort — everyone needed to be involved.” Despite the short notice, over 20 student organizations were represented at that evening’s meeting, and Carnegie Mellon’s “Helping Haiti” campaign was quickly created and put into action.
Events and fundraisers resulting from the collaboration among these organizations began this week. “We decided that the most immediate need is funds, so we began the Dollar Campaign,” Abimbola said. The Dollar Campaign was launched with the intention of collecting at least one dollar from every student, staff, and faculty member at the university. If successful, this would mean a collection of more than $16,000. The Dollar Campaign was previously employed after Hurricane Katrina, which resulted in $4000 collected in three days. Funds raised from the Dollar Campaign will go to four different nonprofit organizations: Hospital Albert Schweitzer, Doctors Without Borders, Brother’s Brother Foundation, and Yele Haiti. 
Tuesday became the “Wear Red for Haiti” day, during which members of the campus community were asked to wear red in support of Haiti. Faculty members were also encouraged to hold a five-minute classroom teach-in about the people, history, and culture of Haiti. On Tuesday, an afternoon prayer service was held in the University Center chapel.
Thursday night offered students and staff the opportunity to join a candlelight vigil at the Fence. The Originals, a student vocal group, began the meeting in song. Following the performance, students were invited to share their own stories and feelings concerning the disaster. “I didn’t know much about Haiti,” first-year business administration major Rekha Toshok said, “but I received an e-mail from my RA about the vigil. I think it’s really important to come to things like this. It’s important to take time out and show respect.” The event was sponsored by Amnesty International, Facilitating Opportunities for Refugee Growth (FORGE), and OM, a spiritual organization for Hindus, Jains and Sikhs — a detail which spoke to the unity and collaboration of student organizations. “For the first time, organizations are connected. Helping Haiti is bringing us together and uniting us for a cause,” said Alex Blair, president of FORGE. 
“I think it’s really cool how involved the whole campus is. It’s hard to stay immersed in the world when you’re at school,” first-year Gabbi Rueda said. “This sort of thing takes you out of yourself and helps you realize what’s important. It gives you a better perspective of the world.”
Student government continues to coordinate with other student organizations to expand their efforts. “We aren’t trying to take away [the Hatians’] dignity. We don’t need to belittle them. But we are people who share the same world. It is our responsibility to act for them,” Abimbola said.
Upcoming events included in the “Helping Haiti” campaign will be posted on the Carnegie Mellon news blog site or on the Helping Haiti Facebook group. All students are encouraged to get involved by donating hygiene items to the current supply drive, or by contributing to the Dollar Campaign.

At approximately 12:30 p.m. on Friday, University Police began evacuating Wean Hall, citing an unconfirmed security threat. As a precaution, students and faculty were evacuated from Wean, Doherty, and Hamerschlag halls. Campus police, in cooperation with Pittsburgh Police and other local law enforcement agencies, continued their sweep of Wean Hall, in addition to Doherty and Hamerschlag halls, as a precautionary measure. The sweep of the building was completed at 2:30 p.m. Wean, Doherty, and Hamerschlag halls were reopened soon after.

In recognition of the Open Learning Initiative’s dedication to educational opportunities, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Lumina Foundation for Education, and the Hewlett Foundation awarded the OLI with $4 million in grants to expand upon its work.
The Open Learning Initiative began at Carnegie Mellon in 2002 with the goal of creating online courses based on cognitive science. “We bring together teams of faculty experts — in statistics, engineering, and chemistry, for example — with software engineers, with learning science researchers, and human-computer interactions scientists and we develop web-based learning environments: OLIs,” said Candace Thille, the director of the OLI.
The ideal purpose was for a student not attending Carnegie Mellon to be able to take the course with the same level of success as a traditional student. “The goal was that a learner new to the subject could go online and receive the complete performance of instruction for the course — they could learn what the courses were designed to teach using just the OLI course,” said Joel Smith, Carnegie Mellon’s vice provost and chief information officer.
Faculty, cognitive scientists, and human-computer interaction experts worked together to set up this program that not only provided valuable courses but also feedback to its creators. By studying the effects of online courses in and out of the classroom, researchers at both Carnegie Mellon and the Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center can determine if the courses increase learning. Several online courses are used in Carnegie Mellon classrooms today. For example, in the online courses, students can even mix chemical reactions as if in a real laboratory and receive feedback throughout the process.
“After careful design, assessment, and redesign, the evidence shows that OLI course materials, particularly when they are used as part of [a] ‘mixed mode’ of instruction that uses OLI materials but also in-person instruction, do improve learning outcomes,” Smith said.
Early in the experiment, students at Carnegie Mellon were invited to take Statistical Reasoning (36-201) as part of an accelerated learning course. Their results showed that course time could be reduced from the traditional 15 weeks with three lectures a week to eight weeks with two lectures a week. To eliminate outside variables, the experiment was repeated in 2006 and 2009. “The learning gains of the students who used the online course were at least as good, and usually better, than those who attended the traditional course,” said Oded Meyer, director of undergraduate studies in the statistics department.
The OLI at Carnegie Mellon is currently working with community college faculty across the country to implement online courses. Closer to campus, there will be experiments with Computing at Carnegie Mellon as part of an OLI program in summer 2010.
“This could only have happened at Carnegie Mellon because of the history of working across departments and bringing together experts across traditional college boundaries,” Thille said.

For much of the country, economic turmoil can be seen in the way that many universities have been forced to adjust academic curricula in response to the changing job market. Decreased enrollment in certain programs and a lack of funds have forced institutions such as the University of Louisiana and Michigan State University to eliminate majors such as philosophy, American studies, and classics, while focusing on those majors that lead directly to a job. However, despite these national trends, Carnegie Mellon has proven to be an exception by keeping its broad academic program mostly intact and helping students to find careers in a wide variety of areas.
Although  many universities have seen a shift in student interest toward more technical fields that recently have had a better job market, Carnegie Mellon has seen high application volumes and enrollments in all of its colleges. According to Michael Steidel, the director of admission at Carnegie Mellon, application increases for this year range from 11 percent to 19 percent, with the largest increases seen in the Mellon College of Science and the Carnegie Institute of Technology (19 percent and 17 percent, respectively).
Part of the reason Carnegie Mellon has been able to retain a wide spectrum of programs is due to its funding sources. According to Indira Nair, the vice provost of education at Carnegie Mellon, about half of the university’s operating expenses are drawn from tuition payments while grants and monetary awards received by faculty make up another significant portion of the university’s funding. Only a very small portion of the operating budget, approximately 4.6 percent, according to Nair, is drawn from endowment funds — the funding area which has seen the largest drop in recent years.
In addition, the university’s decentralized nature allows individual academic departments to choose how they would like to cut expenses. According to Nair, in most cases, these changes do not result in the elimination of entire programs, but rather result in the removal of several elective courses. However, programs such as anthropology and political science, which already had small departments and relied on adjunct faculty members, have seen significant reductions to the point where it is now difficult to complete a major in these areas.
Although, for the most part Carnegie Mellon has managed to avoid cuts, it has still been subject to the increased pressure from students and concerned parents to deliver an education which will help graduates find a job. However, Nair stresses that in order to find the perfect career, it is not necessary for students to focus on a specific major — regardless of how tough the job market may be. 
“If you can find things you like and skills you are good with, it may lead you in a brand new direction,” she said. Nair advises students to explore new areas that may spark additional interests and allow for the development of new skill sets. She stated that the contribution of these experiences can allow students to discover “what kind of thinker and writer they are and what visions they have. These are some of the skills which employers want.”
Gina Casalegno, assistant dean and interim director at the Carnegie Mellon Career Center, agreed with Nair in that these skills may help students stand out. “Getting involved in student organizations, participating in community service opportunities, being part of an athletic team, and engaging beyond the curriculum all provide real-world experiences that enhance [the student’s] candidacy for any prospective employer,” Casalegno said.
While universities have been forced to adjust curricula in response to the job market, students at Carnegie Mellon will be pleased to learn that the university has been able to retain the majority of its offerings. By keeping options open, expanding one’s focus, and taking advantage of the programs that Carnegie Mellon has to offer, it may be possible to find that dream job yet — even in an unsteady economy.

As a new semester begins, the city of Pittsburgh continues to search for a way to fill its budget void. Mayor Luke Ravenstahl announced Dec. 21 the end of the city’s pursuit of the “fair-share” tuition tax on Pittsburgh’s college students, leaving a $15 million budget hole unresolved. The state has proposed a new solution through a statewide property tax and service fee for all nonprofit organizations, including all of Pennsylvania’s colleges. Like the tuition tax, this proposal has already been met with criticism from Pittsburgh colleges.
The original proposed “fair-share tax” would have added a 1 percent tax on tuition from each of Pittsburgh’s colleges, or about $400 to Carnegie Mellon’s annual tuition. It was proposed in order to fill a void in the city budget for pensions and the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh system. If enacted, it would have been the first tax on college tuition in any city in the nation.
Students were relieved to hear that the tax was officially off the table.
“I’m glad that we prevailed, and I’m very grateful that the city council stood up to [the mayor],” said Natalie Morris, a sophomore physics and computer science major, as well as a Student Senator.
Another Student Senator and sophomore business administration major, Toro Adeyemi, spoke of her surprise that the tax was dropped.
“Even though I and student government and other individuals fought so hard so that the tuition tax would not take place, ultimately I was surprised the tax was dropped,” Adeyemi said.
In their efforts to oppose the tax, students started websites, submitted petitions, made phone calls, attended city council hearings, and joined with Pittsburgh’s other colleges to make their views known.
According to the Carnegie Mellon Student Senate, there were over 1000 petition signatures at Carnegie Mellon alone, and over 10,000 signatures at all the Pittsburgh schools combined. Students were a constant presence at city council meetings. At the public hearing on the tax, the Pittsburgh colleges sent over 40 student speakers, along with additional supporters, and the room had standing room only.
“When I was at the city council meeting, none of the members wanted to punish students or thought this was the best option. Actually, they thought that it was closer to their only option,” said Corrine Walters, a junior computer science and HCI double major. “It just required some induced creativity and a bit of backlash for the mayor to drop it.”
In a Dec. 21 e-mail to the Carnegie Mellon community announcing the end of the proposed tax, Carnegie Mellon President Jared L. Cohon expressed his interest in working with the city to help it address the budget void.
“With this bad tax idea behind us, we look forward to working with the city to address its fiscal problems and to restore Pittsburgh’s forward momentum,” Cohon stated.
With the tax pursuit officially over, the state has now stepped in. Senate Bill 1175 would institute a tax on nonprofit organizations based on their amount of property, as well as an essential services fee. A hearing on the proposed bill was held last Tuesday with the Pennsylvania Senate Democratic Policy Committee.
The Pittsburgh Council of Higher Education (PCHE) immediately spoke out against the bill. Carnegie Mellon is in line with this position. Cohon and Pittsburgh Theological Seminary President William Carl put out a press release on behalf of the PCHE on Jan. 12 expressing their views.
“The legislation is grounded in two false perceptions,” they stated. “The first false perception is that colleges and universities drain services while providing no return to the city.... The second false perception is that expanding universities are converting tax-bearing property to tax-exempt status, eroding Pennsylvania’s tax base.”
The press release cited legislation supporting the tax-exempt status of nonprofit organizations. It mentioned legislation dating back to the Commonwealth’s  constitution, adopted in 1874, as well as the more recent Pennsylvania Act 55 of 1997.
“While we acknowledge that our government leaders need to find a way to stabilize our city’s finances, taxing colleges and universities is not a good way,” said Teresa Thomas, assistant vice president for media relations at Carnegie Mellon.
Thomas, Carnegie Mellon, and the PCHE remain committed to the opposition of the tax.

Every time someone mentions the word “Google” on campus, ears visibly perk up. At a school known for having a large population of computer science majors, any news concerning the Internet goliath presents many possibilities: new gadgets to supply any techie’s cravings, jobs for recent graduates, or just the chance that something potentially decade-defining is about to happen.
Yet the news of late is more bittersweet than usual. After four years of unprecedented partnership with Carnegie Mellon, Apple, Intel, and other big names in technology, Google is moving out of the campus’ Collaborative Innovation Center (CIC) into its own building in Pittsburgh.
Beginning in December 2005, Google and former Carnegie Mellon computer science faculty member Andrew Moore have been working together to initiate a Pittsburgh branch of the company. It seemed only fitting to establish offices in the CIC, a space built especially for the purpose of bringing together the great computer science minds at Carnegie Mellon and the technology leaders of today.
Despite Google’s departure from campus property, the corperation still wishes to advance cooperation with the university, its faculty, and its students. Just this past September, Google purchased a Carnegie Mellon-based company, reCAPTCHA. reCAPTCHA assigns a new, dual use to CAPTCHAs, the distorted-letter tests found at the bottom of registration forms on many sites including Yahoo, Hotmail, PayPal, and Wikipedia. CAPTCHA, an acronym for “Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart,” distinguishes between human computer users and malevolent computer programs designed by spammers to obtain free email accounts. The tests require users to type the distorted letters they see.
“But there’s a twist — the words in many of the CAPTCHAs provided by reCAPTCHA come from scanned archival newspapers and old books. Computers find it hard to recognize these words because the ink and paper have degraded over time, but by typing them in as a CAPTCHA, crowds teach computers to read the scanned text,” Luis von Ahn, co-founder of reCAPTCHA, and Will Cathcart, Google product manager, stated in a Google Blog announcing the purchase. reCAPTCHA will continue to develop as both companies move into the new Pittsburgh headquarters.
Google is moving to an East Liberty location, Bakery Square, where they will claim a 40,000-square-foot space in the building formerly used as a Nabisco plant. With the expanded space, Google will be able to offer even more jobs than before, mostly in the field of engineering and software development. A recent Post-Gazette article reported that Google is “aggressively hiring” to fill up the extra space and that, “about one-half of the office’s current employees were educated at schools in the region — places like CMU, the University of Pittsburgh, Penn State University, and Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland — and Google plans to maintain a similar ratio as it expands.” With these statistics in mind, most students are not concerned about losing future opportunities. “Honestly, to the extent of my knowledge, I’m not sure it will make a difference,” said Andrey Grinshpun, a junior math and computer science major.
With the start of a new year, and a chance for new beginnings, Google’s move to East Liberty signals a new turn for both the university and the city of Pittsburgh. In a recent letter to the Carnegie Mellon community, President Jared Cohon called the move a “wonderful success story — for Google, for Carnegie Mellon, and for Pittsburgh.”
Moving to its own independent branch, Google has expressed the success of the alliance with a university, the growing potential of the CIC, the rising eminence of Pittsburgh as a technology hub, and the bright futures in store for students and graduates of Carnegie Mellon that rely on corporate success.

Barth wins research award
Alison Barth, associate professor of biological sciences, has received a Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel Research Award. The award is presented by Germany’s Alexander von Humboldt Foundation. The award is given to internationally renowned scientists and scholars who completed their doctorates within the last 12 years. Applicants are expected to continue to produce cutting-edge achievements that will have a seminal influence on their discipline beyond their immediate field of work.
The Bessel Research Award will allow Barth to spend seven months in Germany working on research projects with Michael Brecht at the Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience in Berlin.
While at the Bernstein Center, Barth will share techniques currently used in her lab to isolate neural responses from individual, live cells. This will allow her to learn about whole-cell recordings obtained from neurons in the intact brain. Brecht uses this method extensively, and it allows researchers to measure currents across ion channels in the cellular membrane. 
Barth studies plasticity in neurons, specifically how experience transforms the properties of neurons to encode memory. She developed and patented the first tool to locate and characterize neurons activated by experience in a living animal.
Schmidt appointed as the vice-chair of the President’s Critical Infrastructure Protection Board
Howard Schmidt, a distinguished adjunct fellow with Carnegie Mellon CyLab, has been chosen to serve as national cybersecurity coordinator by President Barack Obama. During the Bush administration, Schmidt was appointed as the vice-chair of the President’s Critical Infrastructure Protection Board and as the special adviser for cyberspace security for the White House in December 2001. Schmidt became chair of the board in January 2003 and served until his retirement in May 2003.
Now serving the Obama administration, Schmidt will be a member of the National Security Council and will report to the national security adviser. He will be responsible for coordinating federal government cybersecurity policy for both military and civilian agencies. Schmidt will serve as a member of the President’s security staff.
Schmidt is president of the Information Security Forum, a nonprofit consortium of 300 large corporations and public sector organizations working on cybersecurity issues. He recently served as chief security strategist for the U.S. CERT Partners Program for the National Cyber Security Division in the Department of Homeland Security.

Also, Hedges will comment on how we tend to occupy ourselves with “squalid pseudo-events of celebrity breakdowns, gossip, and trivia.” With experience working as a foreign correspondent in Central America, the Middle East, Africa, and the Balkans, as well as teaching at Columbia, New York University, and Princeton, Hedges has a worldly perspective on what humans see and unknowingly fall victim to.
University Lecture Series Journeys Lecture: David Lewis- Now and Then
Monday, Jan. 25
4:30 p.m., Gregg Hall (Porter Hall 100)
Born in 1922, David Lewis served in the Navy in World War II. An architect and urban designer, Lewis came to the Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1963 as the Andrew Mellon professor of architecture and urban design, where he started an educational program in urban design where students worked hands-on with elected officials, agency representatives, and citizens in communities in the Pittsburgh metropolitan region.
From 1968 to 1974, he taught at Yale, where he was the William Henry Bishop professor of urban design and formed the Yale Urban Design Workshop. In 1988–89, he was the Hyde professor at the University of Nebraska. In 1990, he returned to Carnegie Mellon and started the Urban Laboratory, which still exists today. 
In the late ’60s and early ’70s, he was a core member of the American Institute of Architects’ (AIA) Regional/Urban Design Assistance Teams (R/UDATs), and was chairman of the AIA’s National Urban Design Committee in 1976–77. In 1976, he was a founding member of the International Institute of Urban Design.
Lewis is the founder of Urban Design Associates (UDA), a renowned urban design firm that practices in the spirit of participatory design.

Our still newly selected dean of student affairs, Karen Boyd, has resigned.
After her selection in an involved search that seemed to persist throughout all of last spring, her departure just six months later is shocking, saddening, and infuriating to the university community. 
We could focus on asking harder questions, expecting more answers — better answers — from the administration on why we are again without a dean of student affairs, but we know that no answer is going to be acceptable. Her decision was made and accepted by our administration, with Michael Murphy now serving as interim dean for the remainder of the year.
What we ask is: What plan exists to find strong, consistent leadership for the Division of Student Affairs?
Over the past two years, we have had four deans, whether permanent or interim. It now seems likely that a fifth will start this fall. When that happens, he or she will have a whirlwind of predecessors to clean up after, each with a unique vision, different goals, and varied projects and promises that may have been abandoned, forgotten, overwritten, or ignored.
We do not mean to downplay the effort that Dick Tucker, Boyd, and Michael Murphy have put and continue to put into their work; however, the Division of Student Affairs seems to have become a revolving door of administrative entrances and exits over the past two years.
We have to question the long-term effects that the numerous changes in leadership will have. For example, the current class of juniors will not have had a dean of student affairs who lasted longer than a year during its entire tenure at Carnegie Mellon. What have these students lost?
The dean of student affairs must be a champion for the students, an innovator, a listener, a trusted source in the administration to be sure the student voice is heard.
There is a vacancy at the heart of this campus. So for now, this spring, we are again left to search for a dean of students who will be a true match for Carnegie Mellon, a dean who will start next fall with a new class of students and might just be present to see them graduate.

“I’m sorry. We could have stopped catastrophic climate change... we didn’t.” —Future President Obama.
A digitally aged future President Obama was joined by several future leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, and others, in a series of Greenpeace ads to coincide with COP15, or the more properly named 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference. In the ads, our current leaders apologize for failing to take action to stop the then-“catastrophic” climate change. Greenpeace has become more and more bold and extremist in its advertising; if we can still remember the spectacle that was the G-20 here in Pittsburgh, we might also recall the Greenpeace activists that dangled along with a climate change banner off our own West End Bridge, so these ads should come as no surprise.
Of course, we should assume Greenpeace is simply being fanatical, and that these apologetic ads are already outdated due to the far-reaching, environment-protecting, carbon-footprint-lowering resolutions agreed to in the harmonious COP15 meetings.
Except, oh wait, the conference was a failure. It didn’t work. No agreement was reached. No reductions in carbon emissions were agreed to. No successor to the Kyoto Protocol was created, signed, or ratified. The meeting went precisely as the Greenpeace ads suggested that a world looking back in 2020 would perceive.
On Dec. 7, the day the conference began, an exceptional declaration was sounded by 56 newspapers, each publishing the same editorial. Yes, in a journalistic world where one’s opinion is meant to distinguish your columnist, your editor, your paper from its competitors, newspapers across 45 countries together spoke with a singular voice. A voice that called for action, for steps to limit emissions, and for political bickering to be put aside. An editorial that was factual, terse, and, more importantly, a call to focus not on nationalistic pride, but on the future of humanity. There was still a hope that these politicians could come together, not to vie for their own country’s interests, but to act as representatives of the planet as a whole.
But we know this didn’t happen, and the aftermath is more telling than the meetings, as each country seems to have found another to blame. Did Denmark fail in its role as host, running secret, more exclusive meetings? Did the United States refuse to accept that as the largest carbon-emitter it needed to make the deepest cuts? Did China’s approach to negotiation destroy any hope for an open deliberation? Or, most obviously, did every government leader fail, as no agreement was reached?
The cautiously hopeful, tellingly worried voice of newspapers across the globe may not now clear their collective throat and applaud the leaders who met in Copenhagen for their progress, but must retreat into the corner, ashamed. The collective editorial must now wait until the end of this year, when the leaders come back together, for COP16 in Mexico, where they can hopefully put to paper words that can unite all of the countries present. They must create an agreement that will save a graying Obama from ever being forced to apologize to a decimated world.

After giving in to China’s demands for four years, Google has finally taken an extreme step — it has decided to stop censoring its search results in China.
Tired of the country’s required censorship of the Internet, Google has decided that it may be best to close its operations in China. The decision was made after the company suspected the Chinese government of hacking into the Gmail user accounts of Chinese human rights activists. 
According to a New York Times article, Google has said that it will try to negotiate with the Chinese authorities regarding censorship and surveillance issues before taking the drastic step of shutting down google.cn. However, considering the reputation of the Chinese government, a successful negotiation seems highly unlikely.
As journalists, we at The Tartan certainly promote freedom of speech and commend Google’s efforts to do the same. With sites such as YouTube frequently blocked and search engines heavily censored, China had already severely restricted the freedom of its citizens, but by infiltrating private user accounts, the Chinese government went too far.
Even with such a serious attack on users’ security, Google’s decision is unexpected after years of complacency. 
A company should adapt its policies to the laws of the country where it is situated, but not to the extent of giving up its core values. Google is a trusted name in the world, and by standing up to China’s excessive censorship of information, Google has established that it will not undermine that trust by compromising its values.
The Chinese government, as expected, is censoring news of its dispute with Google. It is ironic that while the entire world knows of Google’s decision, many Chinese remain oblivious. Without Google, China will truly be cut off from the rest of the world. While it is too much to hope for a complete reform in the attitude of the Chinese government, we can at least hope that other companies will follow Google and not give up their values. We applaud Google’s stand against censorship and hope China eases its restrictions on its people.

As your student body president and vice president, Timi and I would like to welcome everyone back to another exciting semester at Carnegie Mellon. As you continue your studies here, we hope you realize that your student government representatives will continue to fight hard for you and provide programs and initiatives, such as the Tartan Rewards Program, that greatly improve the Carnegie Mellon experience and encourage all students to explore all that the university has to offer.
Last week the student government Executive Branch teamed up with the Greek community to hold the first semiannual Textbook Flea Market, which gave students the chance to sell their books at prices they designated. A great success, the Textbook Flea Market is an initiative that Timi and I expect to continue at the end of the spring semester, and we hope that it will continue in the future under new leadership. With revenue of over $7000, the aim of this initiative was for students to help themselves, help other students, and most of all give to charity.
In that vein, the university community has come together to help Haitians in need as a result of the recent earthquake. In this trying time, Carnegie Mellon’s Division of Student Affairs, student government, and student organizations across campus are calling for a unified effort from the community to support the people of Haiti.
We have kicked off a “Helping Haiti Dollar Campaign” to raise money for much-needed relief efforts. The Dollar Campaign’s goal is to collect at least one dollar from every student, staff, and faculty member at the university, which potentially could yield more than $16,000.
All the contributions to the “Helping Haiti Dollar Campaign” will go to the following organizations:
Hôpital Albert Schweitzer 
Doctors without Borders 
Brother’s Brother Foundation 
YELE
We appreciate and embrace your generosity in our efforts to support the people of Haiti. College students can often get stuck in their own bubbles, and raising awareness for this heart-wrenching event is a moral obligation of this campus’s student leaders. As President Obama has said, “It’s in times like these that we must show the kind of compassion and humanity that has defined the best of our national character for generations.” I can assure you that our combined efforts will go a long way.

Terrorists will strike again.
They will slip through our intelligence networks, walk through the gauntlet of full-body scanners and puffer machines and metal detector wands and bomb-sniffing dogs, take a seat in row 16, and kill more innocent people.
Or maybe they will find lost nuclear material from Pakistan or the former Soviet Union, make a bomb with the help of Iranian or American scientists and engineers, take a yacht into Boston Harbor, and attack.
Or maybe they will buy a stolen assault rifle in an American city and walk into an elementary school.
The reality is that we cannot stop every attack any more than we can kill every terrorist. The more surveillance we add, the less freedom we retain. No security camera or wiretapping technology can be perfect, but it can be abused. When full-body scanners exist not just in every airport, but also in sports stadiums and high schools, we will not have “defeated terrorism,” but we will have lost that which we aim to protect.
This Orwellian scenario seems a bit extreme, but it is not so unlikely as it appears. Because our notion of defense against terrorism consists of looking at what terrorists attack and then stopping them from doing it again, so far we have focused almost exclusively on airport security. The theory seems to be that if we make flying inconvenient enough for terrorists, they will give up. This is true for the average American traveler, who views walking through a modern-day airport with the same excitement as going to the dentist, but a sufficiently determined terrorist will still find a way around new security measures. Humans have invented too many ways to destroy each other; we can never be completely secure.
I am not arguing that we remove security checkpoints from airports and allow handguns on flights. Reasonable security is both effective and necessary to stop malicious individuals and discourage terrorist organizations. 
However, full-body scanners are one of those “magic” surveillance technologies for which the costs outweigh the benefits. If they become widely used in airports, they are a step, albeit an expensive one, away from other locations. If there is a bombing at the Super Bowl or the Olympics or a school, experts will always argue that the incident could have been detected.
Technologies like full-body scanners are worrisome for a number of reasons. The most discussed of these is privacy. Many Americans do not like the idea of nameless TSA officers seeing under their clothes. This seems to me like the least-concerning effect of the scanners. At least judging by sample images posted online, the results of the scan will hardly be identifiable. The majority of Americans seem to share this lack of concern, as 78 percent of respondents in a USA Today poll supported full-body scanners.
The more concerning consequence of advanced surveillance devices is that once sophisticated scanners begin to be used in airports, they will start becoming accepted by the public. We would not be outraged to have to walk through a metal detector at the Super Bowl. In time, with more attacks and threats of attacks, this could easily be extended to full-body scanners.
The difference between metal detectors, which are not uncommon in public venues, and full-body scanners, which are still controversial, is the type of data they produce. Metal detectors give a basic result: Either something metallic is detected or it is not. On the other hand, a detailed scan gives information that would be extremely valuable to intelligence officers, not to mention advertisers. A full-body scan matched with an identity would be more useful than a passport photo or fingerprint. If a government can listen in on its citizens’ conversations without their knowledge, it should not be trusted to resist the temptation of linking their images with other data.
Successfully maintaining security and preventing terrorist attacks is often a matter of gathering and analyzing information. In government reports, including the one on the Christmas Day attack, there is a tendency to assign blame to one of these two categories — in the most recent case, it was analysis and “connecting the dots.” 
However obvious a successful terrorist plot may seem in retrospect, the reality is that it still happened, and it will happen again. We should not expect to be perfect, nor should we make quick and reckless choices when our perfection fails. We should look at terrorism and security in a larger context, one in which the benefits of freedom and privacy often outweigh the costs of absolute security.

Earlier this month, the tallest building in the world opened in Dubai to a sparkling ceremony of pomp and circumstance in the Middle Eastern emirate — and to skepticism from the rest of the world. The Jan. 4 opening was no small affair: The Burj Khalifa was opened to 6000 guests and framed by 10,000 fireworks (but presumably no cocktails). But behind this pomp and circumstance was little more than a desperate plea to keep Dubai thriving.
The Burj Khalifa, formerly termed the Burj Dubai or the Dubai tower, was recently renamed in honor of Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the president of the United Arab Emirates and emir of Abu Dhabi, one of the seven emirates. This name change follows a $10 billion bailout by Abu Dhabi on the part of Dubai in December, when it became clear to the country — and to the world — that even this supposedly booming center of real estate growth was not immune to the global economic downturn.
Safely surpassing the former tallest building in the world, the financial center called the Taipei 101 in Taiwan, the Burj Khalifa stands 2717 feet tall, features views of up to 60 miles away (of the desert, sure), and cost $1.5 billion to build. When the construction of the soaring structure began in 2004, parcels were quickly sold to groups from all around the Middle East, Eastern Asia, and the United States — although many of those are still for sale.
They say that if you build it, they will come. But with this global economic climate, in which citizens around the world are seemingly making a permanent change in their spending and travel habits, bragging rights about having the tallest building in the world might not travel far.
And nor should it: The Burj Khalifa is simply a symbol of being a symbol, much like Dubai itself.
That is, the building is no more than a symbol of “merely the Emirates’ once-deep pockets,” as Witold Rybczynski wrote in a Jan. 13 article on www.slate.com titled “Dubai Debt: What the Burj Kahlifa — the tallest building in the world — owes to Frank Lloyd Wright.”
There is an increasingly persistent argument in the media that says that even as the recession recedes, consumers’ spending habits may be permanently altered. There are predictions that we really have become less wasteful, less inclined to throw down large sums on money on fleeting, flashy goods. This is a good thing — but certainly not for Dubai.
Dubai has branded itself as a better — read: hotter — Las Vegas. But while Las Vegas has somewhat bounced back from the worst part of the beginning of the recession, it’s done so largely because of its residents. There is no income tax in the city, and residents are largely working in service industries — but they are indeed employed, and are usually American citizens. 
In Dubai, a huge proportion of the population of the emirate is that of migrant workers. Stories of the horrendous conditions in which these largely South Asian migrant workers live and work — and were injured and killed during the construction of the Burj Khalifa — certainly dampen the image of the supposedly luxurious urban center.
Moreover, the cultural and social differences between Dubai and Las Vegas mean the former cannot necessarily mimic the success of the latter — nor should it. The disregard for environmental sustainability — or for the physical environment at all — is one element that the two regions have in common. However, that is nothing to be proud of. 
Las Vegas still exists as the by-product of an earlier age in which environmental degradation flew under the radar — no longer is this disregard acceptable in burgeoning urban environments.
Additionally, will a rocket ship-shaped building designed by a Chicago-based architectural firm, and with what some call strong inspirations from the skyscraper work of the American architect Frank Lloyd Wright, strengthen the culture of the Middle Eastern city? 
To have staying power, a city or region must have some cultural element that is all its own that makes it shine. Simply being a conglomeration of Western and worldwide consumption habits — reflecting what has been done elsewhere already, and emerging first as an airport stopover point — might not be enough to make Dubai last.
As Nick Maclean of the real estate firm CB Richard Ellis in Dubai told The New York Times, the Burj Khalifa “is a unique building and symbolically important but it is not going to stimulate demand.”
The tallest doesn’t necessarily signal an epicenter of cultural, economic, or political power anymore. It just signals the most likely to fall.

In light of recent global events such as the earthquake and subsequent crisis in Haiti, people should be able to depend on news and media for consistent updates and first-hand accounts of what is truly going on. However, while many popular culture-centric citizens may still be concerned with what color see-through tank top Miley Cyrus wore out to dinner with her boyfriend last night, there are those of us that would prefer to see that genre of celebrity commentary take a back seat. This week, the seemingly constant media coverage of NBC’s late-night debacle has proven to follow a similar pattern, and I am not amused.
Although I cannot fairly refer to myself as an avid late-night talk show fan, I have been forced to follow the NBC chaos through consistent broadcast updates on multiple news networks. For example, while many publications have chosen to print stories on the subject, CNN’s constant text-message updates to my iPhone are the most annoying.
The story is as follows: Last week, NBC announced that it would be canceling Jay Leno’s prime-time show and returning the comedian to his previous late-night block. This new lineup would move host Conan O’Brien and his program, “The Tonight Show with Conan O’Brien,” back to a 12:05 a.m. slot, appropriately and amusingly earning it a new nickname, “The Next Morning Show.” The changes, which seem to honor Leno completely at the expense of O’Brien, have caused the eruption of a bit of a skirmish.
Even more recently, TV personalities like David Letterman, Jimmy Fallon, and Jimmy Kimmel have chosen to get involved in the debacle. On Thursday night, Kimmel joined Leno on his show to discuss the NBC affair. Kimmel, on a live video cast, ripped Leno apart, openly vying for Conan with comments like, “Listen, Jay, Conan and I have children — all you have to take care of is cars.” Meanwhile, O’Brien announced that he would be choosing not to take the 12:05 a.m. time slot on NBC, and instead would be looking to possibly work with other networks.
While the back-and-forth aspect of this story certainly is entertaining, its constant coverage in the media has only revitalized my disdain for the relationship between the global newscast and the American entertainment business. This is not to suggest that in the face of a crisis people should drop everything to immerse themselves in the pain and sorrow of catastrophe, but rather that the institutions of American broadcast should get their priorities in order. While it is certainly acceptable to report on the toils of the entertainment business, I just hope that stories of true global consequence are given precedence.
