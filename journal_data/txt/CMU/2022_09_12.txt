Champions League Matchday 1 Recap
Dinamo Zagreb vs. Chelsea
Chelsea were by far the favorites going into their match against Dinamo Zagreb and, from a statistical point of view, they performed as such, dominating possession making over double the amount of shots that Zagreb did. The final scoreline, however, fell in favor of the Croatians. A Chelsea effort scarcely 10 minutes after the starting whistle fell to the feet of Robert Ljubičić who played it long to Bruno Petković. Petković headed it on to Mislav Oršić who sprinted past Wesley Fofana to challenge the visitors’ goal. Kepa Arrizabalaga came off his line to meet Oršić, but Oršić lobbed the ball over him and into the back of the net. With Zagreb leading 1-0 with 12 minutes on the clock, Chelsea increased the pressure but the hosts matched their intensity. The Blues were ultimately unable to capitalize on any chances and the match ended in favor of the home side. With A.C. Milan and Salzburg (the other members of Group E) tying in their head-to-head, Dinamo Zagreb currently sits at the top of the Group E table, sending the English side to the very bottom.
Borussia Dortmund vs. Copenhagen
The match between Borussia Dortmund and Copenhagen played out the way one would expect. Although the Danish side put up a good effort, they were far outmatched by their German hosts. A beautiful bit of teamwork following a counterattack saw Dortmund captain Marco Reus open the scoring in the 35th minute. Seven minutes later, the hosts doubled their advantage after some back-and-forth between Giovanni Reyna and Raphaël Guerreiro lured Mathew Ryan off his line, leaving an empty net for Guerreiro to slot the ball home into. Dortmund kept up the pressure and extended their lead to 3-0 in the 83rd minute when Guerreiro crossed the ball into the box to an unmarked Jude Bellingham who calmly put the ball into the back of the net. Dortmund currently sit in second place in the Group G table under Manchester City while Copenhagen sit in third, just above Sevilla.
Benfica vs. Maccabi Haifa
Returning to the group stage of the Champions League after over a decade, Israeli team Maccabi Haifa held their own against Portuguese powerhouse Benfica in the first half. Although the visitors were unable to make much headway against Benfica, they did well to prevent the hosts from scoring any goals of their own. Benfica finally broke through in the 49th minute when Álex Grimaldo’s cross into the box found Rafa Silva, whose well-timed first touch put the ball past Josh Cohen into the back of the net. The Portuguese side then doubled their lead in the 54th minute when a powerful strike by Grimaldo from 35 yards out sailed into the Israeli goal, making the final scoreline 2-0. Benfica currently sit at the top of Group H, ahead of PSG on goal difference, while Maccabi Haifa sit at the bottom of the table, just below Juventus on goal difference.
Sevilla vs. Manchester City
A glance at the statistics of this match tells the whole story. Not only did Manchester City dominate possession, but they recorded 24 shots in comparison to Sevilla’s 6, with 10 of City’s shots being on target versus Sevilla’s one. Still, the Spanish side held its own relatively well in the first half, conceding only once when Erling Haaland got on the end of Kevin De Bruyne’s cross to put City up 1-0 in the 20th minute. The second half, however, belonged solely to the English side. Phil Foden doubled his side’s lead in the 58th minute with a beautiful bit of footwork and a clinical finish. Then, in the 67th minute, an effort by Foden was pushed away by Yassine Bounou but found Haaland, who slotted the ball home to complete his brace. A low cross by João Cancelo in the second minute of stoppage time was converted by Rúben Dias, making it 4-0 to City. With this goal difference, City now sits at the top of Group G, ahead of Dortmund, while Sevilla sits under Copenhagen at the bottom of the table.
Salzburg vs. A.C. Milan
Despite A.C. Milan dominating possession against Salzburg, the two sides recorded similar statistics in terms of shots taken (14 and 16, respectively) and shots on target (3 and 4, respectively). Salzburg opened the scoring in the 28th minute when Noah Okafor dribbled past his defender and slotted the ball past Mike Maignan. Milan was not about to go down without a fight, however, and equalized in the 40th minute when Rafael Leão made an impressive run into the box and passed to Alexis Saelemaekers, who coolly converted. Both teams launched offensive plays in the second half of the match, but neither were able to make any headway. With the final scoreline reading 1-1, Milan and Salzburg sit second and third in the Group E table, respectively.
Celtic vs. Real Madrid
Although the final scoreline of this match ended up as one would expect, Celtic did relatively well in creating chances for themselves, recording 10 shots (four on target) versus Real Madrid’s 12 (six on target) despite Real having the lion’s share of possession. However, unlike the Spanish side, the Scots failed to capitalize on these opportunities. The first half ended scoreless, but a well-timed run by Vinícius Júnior in the 56th minute put him on the end of a long cross by Federico Valverde, which Vini Jr. slotted past Joe Hart into the back of the net. Celtic then found themselves outnumbered at the back in the 60th minute and Luka Modrić beat two defenders and Hart to double Real’s lead. A phenomenal cross by Toni Kroos found Dani Carvajal in the box. Carvajal then found Eden Hazard, who found the back of the net to make the final score 3-0 to the visitors. Real now sit second in the Group F table, just below Shakhtar Donetsk, while Celtic are at the bottom of the table under Leipzig.
Leipzig vs. Shakhtar Donetsk
The match between Leipzig and Shakhtar Donetsk began rather unfavorably for the hosts. A rather comedical mistake by Péter Gulácsi saw Marian Shved take the ball off him and score on an empty net, putting the Ukrainian side up 1-0 with 16 minutes on the clock. It seems like things were turning around for the hosts in the 57th minute when Dominik Szoboszlai found an unmarked Mohamed Simakan in the corner of the box, the latter proceeding to flick the ball into the top corner of the Shakhtar net to equalize. However, any optimism was quickly dashed when Shakhtar pulled ahead again just a minute later when Shved’s shot deflected into the Leipzig goal to make the score 2-1 to the visitors. A speedy counterattack in the 76th minute then saw Shakhtar double their advantage as Mykhaylo Mudryk put a third ball past Gulácsi. Mudryk then found Lassina Traoré ahead of his defender in the 85th minute and Traoré scored to make the final score line 4-1 in favor of the visitors. Shakhtar now sit at the top of Group F, sending Leipzig to the bottom of the table.
PSG vs. Juventus
The match started well for PSG, with Kylian Mbappé opening the scoring for the hosts with five minutes on the clock after some solid teamwork with Neymar. Mbappé quickly completed a brace in the 22nd minute after some well-practiced back-and-forth with Achraf Hakimi, making the scoreline 2-0 in favor of the French side. Juventus seemed like they were set to launch a comeback when Weston McKennie headed one past Gianluigi Donnarumma, but the Italian side failed to capitalize on any other opportunities, and the final score read 2-1 in favor of the hosts. PSG sit second in the Group H table, just under Benfica, while Juventus sit in third place ahead of Maccabi Haifa.
Ajax vs. Rangers
The match between Ajax and Rangers went about as the odds would have suggested. The Dutch side dominated statistically, both in terms of possession and in shots taken, and the final scoreline reflected it. Ajax opened the scoring in the 17th minute when Edson Álvarez got on the end of a corner and headed the ball past Jon McLaughlin. The hosts doubled their lead in the 32nd minute when a shot by Steven Berghuis deflected off James Sands and rolled into the net past an off-balance McLaughlin. The visitors then conceded a third goal just a minute later following a fantastic run by Mohammed Kudus, who finished it off clinically. Much to the chagrin of the Rangers, a poorly placed back pass by Ryan Jack in the 80th minute found Steven Bergwijn, who put it into the back of the net to make it 4-0 to Ajax. Ajax now sit at the top of the Group A table, ahead of Napoli, while Rangers sit at the bottom, under Liverpool.
Eintracht Frankfurt vs. Sporting
Despite Eintracht Frankfurt having the edge in number of shots, 11 against Sporting’s eight, Sporting had the advantage in terms of shots on target, recording five against Frankfurt’s two, and this reflected in the final scoreline. The first half went goalless for both sides, but Sporting opened up the scoring in the 65th minute when Hidemasa Morita’s pass found an unmarked Marcus Edwards in the box, who slotted it home to make it 1-0 to the visitors. Edwards then made a fantastic run two minutes later before passing it to Francisco Trincão, who put the ball into the back of the net to double the Portuguese side’s lead. The visitors continued to push and, in the 82nd minute, Pedro Porro made a phenomenal run past two defenders before making a beautiful long pass to Nuno Santos, who slotted it past Kevin Trapp to make it 3-0 to Sporting. This puts Sporting at the top of Group D, ahead of Tottenham Hotspur, while Eintracht Frankfurt slips to the bottom of the table, below Marseille.
Inter Milan vs. Bayern Munich
This was another match which went about as one would expect. Despite having home field advantage, Inter Milan were thoroughly outclassed by Bayern Munich, holding their own in terms of possession, but falling far behind in number of shots (nine versus Bayern’s 21) and shots on target (two versus Bayern’s 11). The visitors opened the scoring in the 25th minute when Joshua Kimmich played a fantastic long pass to Leroy Sané, who routed André Onana to put the German side up 1-0. Inter made an effort to push back, but they were unable to make any headway. Sané sent another effort across the face of the Inter goal in the 66th minute, which fell to Danilo D'Ambrosio, who bungled it into the back of his own net, putting Bayern ahead 2-0. The visitors now sit second in the Group C table, just under Barcelona, while Inter Milan sits third, ahead of Viktoria Plzeň.
Barcelona vs. Viktoria Plzeň
Much like the other Group C head-to-head, the match between Barcelona and Viktoria Plzeň played out as the odds would have had one believe. The visitors were completely outmatched, as reflected by a 23% possession rate, eight shots on target (versus Barça’s 2), and just a single shot on target (versus Barça’s 11). A well-taken corner by Ousmane Dembélé found Jules Koundé, who headed it on to Franck Kessié, who headed the ball into the back of the net, making it 1-0 to Barcelona with 13 minutes on the clock. Barça then doubled their lead in the 34th minute when Robert Lewandowski found the back of the net with a powerful strike from the edge of the box. Viktoria Plzeň pulled one back in the 44th minute when Václav Jemelka crossed into the box to Jan Sýkora, who headed it past Marc-André ter Stegen to make the scoreline 2-1. Barça responded in force, however, with Lewandowski getting his brace in the third minute of stoppage time ahead of halftime, before completing a hat-trick in the 67th minute, putting the hosts up 4-1. Ferran Torres capped it off for the Catalan side, with the final scoreline reading 5-1. Barça sits at the top of Group C, ahead of Bayern Munich, while Viktoria Plzeň is firmly at the bottom of the table, under Inter Milan.
Napoli vs. Liverpool
In perhaps the biggest upset of Matchday 1, Napoli overcame English giants Liverpool. The match did not start well for the visitors, who conceded a coolly taken penalty by Piotr Zieliński in the fifth minute. The English side nearly conceded a second penalty if not for the efforts of Alisson Becker. Becker could do nothing in the 31st minute, however, when André-Frank Zambo Anguissa slipped past the Reds’ defense to put the home side 2-0 up. Then, in the 44th minute, Trent Alexander-Arnold failed to take the ball off Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, who crossed to a barely marked Giovanni Simeone, who converted to make the score 3-0 to Napoli. Zieliński proceeded to make it 4-0 in the 47th minute, lobbing the ball home after his initial shot came off Alisson. Luis Díaz pulled one back for the visitors with a well-placed shot in the 49th minute, but it was too little, too late. With a final scoreline of 4-1, Napoli sits second in Group A under Ajax, while Liverpool sits in third place, above Rangers.
Atlético Madrid vs Porto
The match between Atlético Madrid and Porto was, relatively speaking, among the most evenly matched head-to-heads of Matchday 1, and perhaps the most unexpected, with all of its scoring having occurred during stoppage time. The first goal came in the first minute of stoppage time, when Mario Hermoso’s effort deflected over the head of Diogo Costa and into the back of the net to make it 1-0 to Atlético. Mateus Uribe then equalized for Porto in the sixth minute of stoppage time after the visitors were awarded a penalty for a handball. Atlético kept attacking, however, and an unmarked Antoine Griezmann got on the end of a corner to make the final scoreline 2-1 to Atleti. The Spanish side sits at the top of Group B, ahead of Club Brugge, while the visitors sit third in the table, ahead of Bayer Leverkusen.
Tottenham vs. Marseille
Despite plenty of fouls and a red card in the first three quarters of the match, neither side was able to score until the 76th minute, when Tottenham opened it up. A well-placed cross by Ivan Perišić found Richarlison, who headed the ball into the top of the visitors’ net to make it 1-0 to Tottenham. The English side extended their lead five minutes later when a long cross by Pierre-Emile Højbjerg found Richarlison again, whose header came off the post and into the back of the net, giving the Brazilian his brace and Tottenham a 2-0 win. Tottenham sit second in Group D under Sporting, while Marseille sit in third ahead of Frankfurt.
Club Brugge vs. Bayer Leverkusen
Although both sides in this head-to-head managed to record three shots on target respectively, the match was decided by a single goal. It came in the 42nd minute when Loubadhe Abakar Sylla got on the end of Andreas Skov Olsen’s corner and headed it towards Lukáš Hrádecký. Hrádecký claimed the ball, but fell backwards into his own net, giving the hosts a 1-0 lead. Despite Bayer Leverkusen’s subsequent efforts, the scoreline persisted to the final whistle. Club Brugge sit second in Group B between Atlético Madrid and Porto, while Leverkusen sits at the bottom of the table.

Women’s Cross Country
The women’s cross country team also opened their season with the Panther Opener on Friday, Sept. 2. Junior Zalewski led the Tartans with a 10th place finish with a time of 19:09.2; not far behind was senior Mona Yuan with a time of 19:13.9, which earned her 11th. The Tartans overall scored 67 points, placing them third overall. They will compete at the Robert Morris Invitational on Friday, Sept. 16 next.
Football
The Tartan football team opened its 2022 season at home this year, facing off against Whitworth University on Friday, Sept. 2. This game also marked the debut of Carnegie Mellon’s new head coach, Ryan Larsen.
Following a scoreless first quarter, the Tartans made their first strike early in the second quarter with a touchdown pass from quarterback Ben Mills, making the score 7-0. Not long after, another touchdown pass from Mills to wide receiver Kris Huges resulted in a 99-yard catch and run touchdown, furthering the Tartan’s lead to 14-0. However, the Pirates would be close to catching up by the end of the half, making the score 14-10.
Early on in the second half, Carnegie Mellon upped their score again with a 12-yard run from running back Tre Vasiliadis, making it 21-10 Tartans. Toward the end of the third quarter, the Pirates snuck in another touchdown to make it 21-17 Tartans, though it would be their last score of the game. In the fourth quarter, the Tartans scored two more touchdowns, including a 43-yard pick 6 from inside linebacker Kevin Cooke. As the clock ran out, the scoreboard recorded the Tartan’s first win of the season, 35-17.
This past Saturday, Sept. 10, the football team traveled to Troy, New York to take on #22 Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). Early in the first quarter, kicker Hayden Hairston put the Tartans up 3-0 with a 23-yard field goal; that would remain the score for the rest of the half. 
In the second half of play, the Tartans blocked an Engineers field goal. Following an interception from outside linebacker Logan Young that put the ball on the RPI one-yard line, Mills completed a pass to give the Tartans a 10-0 lead. With only 1:46 left in the fourth quarter, the Engineers finally made an appearance on the scoreboard with a touchdown, but it was too late to make a comeback. As the clock wound down, the Tartans secured their second victory of the season, 10-7.
The Tartans will return home this Saturday, Sept. 17 when they take on Grove City at 1:00 p.m. EDT.
Men’s Soccer
The men’s soccer team has had a very strong start to the season, earning themselves an undefeated record of 4-0 so far. This past Thursday, the team played their home opener against Westminster. Though the Tartans conceded their first goal of the season, two early goals in the 13th and 22nd minutes of the game from Junior Ethan Vertal meant that the Tartans were able to keep their undefeated record by a scoreline of 2-1.
The team was back on the road again on Saturday to take on #16 John Carroll University. For most of the game, the scoreboard read 0-0. That is, until first-year Brendan Schonwetter knocked one in during the 89th minute following a corner kick from senior Josh Baugh and an assist from senior Mason Shockley. This lone goal of the game gave the Tartans the victory, 1-0, and placed them at 4-0 for the season.
The team will be returning home on Tuesday, Sept. 13 to take on Washington and Jefferson at 7:00 p.m. EDT.
Women’s Soccer
This past week, the women’s soccer team — who are currently ranked #15 — rebounded from their loss in the first game of the season, winning both their games. The team traveled to Franciscian University on Wednesday, Sept. 7 and had an impressive showing. Two early goals in the third and seventh minutes of the game were all the Tartans needed to win, but they didn’t stop there. Despite a goal in the 31st minute from Franciscan, the Tartans continued to strike, making it 6-1 by the end of the game. This allowed the Tartans to improve their record to 1-1 for the season.
The women’s team kept up the momentum in their next game when they returned home to play Whittenberg in their home opener. The Tartans were all over the Tigers during the game, keeping them shotless and scoreless. The first goal of the game was scored by first-year Jenna Hallbeck in the 16th minute, and that was all Carnegie Mellon needed to secure victory. This advanced the team to 2-1 on the season.
On Sunday, Sept. 11, the Tartans continued their home campaign when they took on #9 Johns Hopkins University. While the Tartans opened the scoring during the 18th minute, Johns Hopkins would not let up, answering less than two minutes later and making it a 1-1 game. Though the Tartans once again took the lead in the 51st minute, the Blue Jays answered in the 57th minute, making it a tie game once more. Neither team was able to get one over on the other for the rest of the game, ending in a 2-2 tie. The women’s soccer team record is now 2-1-1.
The team will continue their campaign at home this week when they take on Grove City on Wednesday at 7:00 p.m. EDT.

As the summer comes to a fruitful close, many Carnegie Mellon students return with a twinge of sadness from the start of classes and upcoming Pittsburgh winter, among other things. But for NFL fans, the happiest time of the year is only now just getting started, with this year’s season on the brink after the Super Bowl way back in February. Of course, part of what makes the NFL America’s biggest sports league is its uncertainty: seemingly every year, an unsung late-round pick rises to stardom, a rookie coach outclasses his peers, and a wild card underdog makes a deep playoff run. For this reason, predicting the way even a single team’s journey is going to unfold, much less the league as a whole, is a near-impossible task. But it wouldn’t be a true NFL season without wild attempts to look back on and laugh at when the season comes to its faithful close. So with that, here's my attempt at forecasting half of the league, specifically each division winner in the NFC for the 2022-23 NFL season: 
NFC East:
Predicted Winner: Philadelphia Eagles
For virtually every year in the past decade, the NFC East seems to be mired in a swamp of mediocrity, typically sending just one team to the postseason. This year feels no different, but it's the high-flying team out in Philly that jumps out to me as the favorite for the upcoming season. Led by up-and-coming offensive studs in Jalen Hurts and DeVonta Smith, the Eagles made a slew of strong offseason moves that has them poised to improve on their playoff season from last year. 
NFC West:
Predicted Winner: Los Angeles Rams
When you’re the previous season’s Super Bowl winner, there is always going to be ample pressure on you to succeed again the following season. Fortunately for the Rams, they return with a squad that is primed to not only win their division but also make another deep playoff run. Matthew Stafford seems to have found a comfortable home in Los Angeles, finally having the roster pieces to make his elite play meaningful, especially when he’s got Cooper Kupp to throw to. On the defensive side, Aaron Donald remains a force on a starting 11 that is among the most athletic in the league. 
NFC North
Predicted Winner: Detroit Lions
Ever since the legendary quarterback Brett Frave first donned a yellow and green helmet, it feels like the NFC North has been run by the Green Bay Packers. This season, many have them following that track atop the north, but I have a dark horse candidate in mind to take the throne this year: the Detroit Lions. Number two overall pick from Michigan Aiden Hutchinson is likely to be a star in the league on the defensive end and 12th overall pick Jameson Williams is an athletic wide receiver from Alabama who is poised to make an immediate splash. Ultimately, the Lions’ chances at making a return to the postseason will likely rest on quarterback Jared Goff’s shoulders, but with all of the pieces this team has made, the amount of work Goff himself has to do has lessened considerably since last fall. 
NFC South
Predicted Winner: Tampa Bay Buccaneers
For a brief period last fall, every NFC South team save the Buccaneers were seemingly counting their blessings as legendary quarterback Tom Brady had announced his retirement. This, of course, was short lived, with Brady reversing his decision shortly after, putting the Buccaneers back in a prime position to not only secure the South, but also go far in January. On the offensive side, there is no question it’s one of the most talented squads the league has to offer, with skilled players like Leonard Fournette, Mike Evans, and Chris Godwin, all at the aid of Brady. Defensively, it's a solid group that has a penchant for forcing turnovers and limiting big plays, with star Shaquil Barrett at the forefront of that effort. Barring injuries or age finally dragging Tom Brady down to mediocrity, I expect the Buccaneers to run the division with little resistance.

Welcome back to a new school year! For newcomers, SciTech Roundup is a weekly collection of headlines related to science and technology, some being specific to Carnegie Mellon, and others being national news. 
CMU RESEARCH
Study identifies new autism genes
Researchers discovered over 100 genes related to autism, with many being new variants. Some seem to be related to other developmental disabilities and schizophrenia. Kathryn Roeder, UPMC Professor of Statistics and Life Sciences in Carnegie Mellon's Department of Statistics and Data Science, was a co-author of the paper along with several professors from the University of Pittsburgh, MIT, Harvard, and the University of California San Francisco. The researchers analyzed 150,000 genomes using cloud computing and worked to tease apart genes related to autism versus other developmental disabilities. Roeder determined that genes involved in developmental delay were more active in early neuronal development, while autism-related genes were more active in mature neurons.
Genes from the origins of marine life
Saoirse Foley, a researcher in Carnegie Mellon's Hinman lab, and other researchers authored a paper that identified 14 genes across three different species of echinoderms that could provide insight into the origins of marine life. The other researchers, a team from Barcelona, created a family tree that linked genes in purple urchins, an echinoderm, to those of other species.
Controlling magnetic states with spin currents
Scientists are already able to switch magnetic states by passing an electric current over a material, with a magnetic field applied horizontally. However, Carnegie Mellon doctoral candidates I-Hsuan Kao and Ryan Muzzio have found that a magnetic field isn't needed: by creating a material made of stacked atomically-thin layers, the electrical current can switch the magnetic state on its own. This could save energy for data storage, such as magnetoresistive random-access memory.
NATIONAL NEWS
Apple is going to add more ads to iPhone
Apple has long touted and been touted for its security and privacy standards. Its app store is known for having a stricter review process than that of its main competitor, the Google Play Store. The App Store website advertises "Privacy and security. Built into everything we do.” In 2017, Apple added an Intelligent Tracking Prevention feature to Safari to block websites that send personally identifiable data to advertisers, though bugs in the update did temporarily cause new security vulnerabilities. On the opposite end, companies like Google and Facebook have long been criticized for privacy concerns. In particular, their business models are built upon advertising, tracking individuals' data and effectively selling digital footprints that companies can use to create customized ads. 
This makes sense from a financial standpoint — Google and Facebook's biggest products are, at a surface-level, "free to use." But they must generate revenue somehow, and advertising is their method of offering a free product at the cost of user privacy. On the other hand, Apple has never marketed its products as free or even cheap — users are expected to pay a premium price for a premium product, and with that, premium privacy.
However, Bloomberg reports that Apple could be expanding into the advertising industry, which could provoke more privacy concerns. Apple does already have ads in apps like the News, Stocks, and the App Store. Now, Apple's advertising division has recently started reporting more directly to higher-ups, and is interested in getting their $4 billion advertising business up to the double-digits. Mark Gurman, who reports for Bloomberg on Apple-related and other technology news, predicts that Apple will eventually show ads on Apple Maps, Apple Books, and Apple Podcasts or add advertising tiers to TV+ as many other streaming companies currently do.
Apple does want its advertising model to be different from its competitors, however. For one, it's likely not going to put ads in apps not produced by Apple — it tried a similar endeavor in 2010 with iAd, which was discontinued six years later. Apple also claims to want to avoid giving out personally identifiable information and avoid cross-app tracking, so ads through their platform would be tailored to groups of people, not individuals.
Apple also already has a feature called App Tracking Transparency (ATT), which gives users a pop-up when an app on their iPhone wants to track them across non-Apple apps. ATT only operates on certain conditions, however: apps that only collect data within the app do not need consent from users. Apple's ads also use data collected from Apple accounts and other Apple services. 
But not all apps stop tracking you, even if you tell them to. Tracking users really does help create individualized ads that pull in customers, so some companies flout the rules until they're caught. Companies that do follow Apple's ATT rules lose significant amounts of money, though larger ones like Facebook have fared better than small businesses. It invites suspicion that one of Apple's intentions with ATT is to pull revenue away from its competitors.
There's no telling whether Apple's proposed ad model will truly protect privacy in the long term — companies like DuckDuckGo have tried to topple advertising-heavy businesses like Google with little success. And after so much exposure to advertising, users are desensitized and don't always care about giving up their personal data in order to use cheap and efficient products. As technology continues to integrate into our lives, perhaps we can find better ways to protect user privacy, or maybe we will just have to make peace with our increasingly attention-based economy.

Following the start of COVID-19 pandemic, schools across the country began implementing new strategies to prevent online cheating, accelerating a trend that already existed across all levels of education. Carnegie Mellon was no exception, using Respondus LockDown Browser, which, according to the Eberly Center, is “a custom browser intended to provide secure testing” by preventing unwanted site access during exams. Such policies have continued even after the impacts of coronavirus have faded, with many educational institutions continuing to use proctoring software implemented during the pandemic.
But alongside this widespread use comes a host of privacy concerns. Sean Lawson, a cybersecurity researcher and teacher, writes about some of these alarming trends for Forbes. Lawson notes that these types of software often combine use of the “student’s webcam, microphone, screen, and browser,” or even use facial recognition and eye tracking to identify students and monitor for cheating. This includes making students show their entire room with the camera, or collecting excess data, like their browsing and search histories or keystrokes. 
Such features, Lawson notes, border on “spyware” when viewed in the context of cybersecurity. 
This level of invasiveness, when it comes to test-taking software, has multiple risks, both in the technology itself and how the perception of loss of privacy can impact students. 
The technology itself leaves risky openings. In an interview with the Stuyvesant Spectator, Dr. Sean Lawson of the University of Utah explains that “more intrusive forms of proctoring software are similar to malware in terms of the amount of personal information to which they potentially give access,” which becomes problematic when that data is then stored by companies. Interviewer Maddy Anderson notes that there have been multiple cases of hacks and records stolen from test proctoring services. 
Beyond data stored by companies, the software itself can pose problems to the host computer. Darcy Chalifoux, a spokesperson for a new lockdown browser service, calls out some of the harms of their predecessors, including the lack of transparency with the software code and auto-updating that can change access capabilities of the device without informing the device owner first, a harmful opening for malware.
But even presented with bug-free software, students still experience a unique stress from this form of proctoring. To look at the direct student impact, David Balash and his team from The George Washington University and Georgetown University published a paper onstudent’s perceptions of privacy when faced with such proctoring technology. They found that a large percentage of students had concerns with sharing information with proctoring companies, the amount of information collected, and the downloading of software to personal devices. While 63 percent of students expressed belief that monitoring software made them less likely to cheat, many students thought monitoring went too far, considering the software unnecessary and invasive when it came to monitoring mouse movement, eye movement, browser history, and microphone.
Balash and his team further reported that students felt that such uncomfortable monitoring created a stressful environment, where they feared innocent movements would get them flagged, preventing them from performing to the best of their abilities. 
Such lockdown systems were created as a way to level the playing field, so that students wouldn’t gain unfair advantages by cheating, particularly during the pandemic. And although the overall success at preventing cheating can be challenged, using technology that limits access to the screen and monitors student progress does achieve that goal, at least to an extent.
The success of the technology isn’t the question here — it’s whether users are fully aware of the risks of using it. The current education system doesn’t take time to weigh these risks in the classroom. Instead, students are told to download the lockdown browser so they can take the test, no questions asked. Transparency on potential issues is important, or else, as Lawson continues, “the real issues of privacy, security, accessibility, and equity facing students” will fall through the cracks.

While people were worrying about “murder” hornets last year, another invasive species was also making its home in the United States: the Spotted Lanternfly. The Spotted Lanternfly is an invasive insect that has made its way across the ocean from China and was first reported in Pennsylvania in September 2014. Spotted Lanternflies feast on the sap of various plants and trees, especially farm crops like grapes, hops, and fruit trees. Additionally, the maple syrup and Christmas tree industries have felt the effects of the Spotted Lanternfly.
In 2019, an economic impact study estimated that if the Spotted Lanternfly population continued to grow uncontrolled, this insect alone would cause more than $324 million annually, along with costing more than 2,800 jobs.
Spotted Lanternflies are also known to excrete a sugary waste called honeydew. Honeydew attracts bees, wasps, and other insects and builds up on any surface that Spotted Lanternflies rest on. The build-up of honeydew has also been linked to the growth of sooty mold and black-colored fungi, both of which could decrease the quality of life of residents in impacted areas. 
Any effort to stop the spread of the Spotted Lanternfly is helpful; this includes killing them on sight and destroying their egg masses. Mature Spotted Lanternflies are a beige color with black spots on the wings. Their hindwings (which aren’t normally visible) are a bright red color. Spotted Lanternfly egg masses typically look like dried mud spots. 
Sightings of Spotted Lanternflies are supposed to be reported through an online portal or to 1-888-4BAD-FLY (1-888-422-3359). While no action will directly be taken from the report, it will help government organizations keep track of which areas are being affected by Spotted Lanternflies, especially if they are outside the current quarantine zone. 
In Pennsylvania alone, 34 counties — including Allegheny County — have been placed under a state-imposed quarantine for Spotted Lanternflies. They can also be found in New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Connecticut, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, and West Virginia. Residents moving in and out of quarantine zones are highly encouraged to check their belongings for Spotted Lanternflies and their eggs.
Though not common in an urban setting like Pittsburgh, Tree-of-Heavens serve as one of the main hosts of this pest. Removal of these trees help contribute to controlling their population. Some pesticides have also been known to help kill off Spotted Lanternflies, but all residents of affected areas are highly encouraged to kill them on sight.

Hey Pillboxians, welcome back!
We’ve got our first PILLBOX of the year — or maybe the eleventh, depending on how you count it. To start this new school year we’ve decided to innovate more in PILLBOX. We’ve got two new ongoing series for you to read! “The Muppet Corner” is our section for all things Muppets, and is currently working through the original Muppet Show Album. We’ve also got “Letter for Maggie,” an epistolary serial written by Anna Cappella, that we will be publishing weekly. Catch it now before you have to pay $22.50 to buy it from Random House. Cole Skuse drops a glowing recommendation of the Two Door Cinema Club. Most cinemas I go to have at least four doors, to account for safety regulation. Haha. We get a soon to be classic poem from Rose Condrey, very deep. We are gifted with an extreme rarity, two negative reviews of albums written by Anna, usually the music enjoyer. If you want to know what could have caused this shift in positivity, you’ll have to read on. As always, we get a riveting review of a classic Tarantino by Haley Williams (no, the other one.) And a Nordic edda-style retelling of the tumultuous release of “Don’t Worry Darling” comes from Holly Wang.
Welcome to the clown show,
Your PILLBOX editors

Two really important things happened while we were all taking a little break from school this summer: Lizzo dropped an album and Beyoncé dropped an album within weeks of each other. I know you’re all very eager to hear what I have to say about this historical moment, so please don’t let this mediocre introductory paragraph stand in your way any longer. I present:
Special, Lizzo 2022
Guys, I’m not going to lie to you. I think this album is weird. Apparently every album review I wrote last year was overwhelmingly positive, so I guess this one is going to balance all of those out.
“Special”–pop icon Lizzo’s newest album release from this past summer–is simply not special. It’s clunky and it’s basic and honestly, it’s just not Lizzo. Or it is, but there’s something just a little off about it. Embedded inside of it, though, seems to be a sort of explanation for it. 
Lizzo’s been through some sh*t in the past year or two, as she announces on “The Sign” the first track of her newest album “Special,” quote: “Dealin' with him put me through some sh*t.” She never elaborates further than that, but many of the tracks, especially “2 Be Loved (Am I Ready)” reference how the time in Lizzo’s life directly preceding the writing of “Special” involved a lot of hard lessons. I like the content of some of the album that seems to spawn from that, but a listener can certainly feel the grittiness of that process, and it’s not always easy. Which, I guess, is the point.
To me though, it just seems like almost every song on the album was meant to be a hit single. Some achieve this by targeting Lizzo’s new popular persona, which has been developing since the release of her last album “Cuz I Love You.” “Special” and “I Love You Bitch” and “Naked” are so aggressively thick with parts of Lizzo that social media has been highlighting in recent years that they feel inauthentic. Songs like “Grrls” sound like Lizzo dug into her voice memos from when she was 12. I know her and her team can write better than “Grrls.” That’s all I have to say about that one.
    On a writing note, I’d really like to know more about “Everybody’s Gay,” particularly because it sounds eerily similar to Micheal Jackson’s “Thriller.” Like, very similar. All of the instrumentals are directly derivative from it, no question. Some of the melodies and lyrics — compare the choruses and instrumental breaks — are so closely reminiscent that I went to look for Jackson in the credits. I did not find him. I absolutely love the creative intention, but the fact that nobody’s talking about the similarities between the songs gives me a bad feeling about the whole thing. Lizzo knows too much about music to have done this by accident, and I think a little hat tip to “Thriller” might smooth it out as an endeavor.
    One reason I know this is because of “Break Up Twice,” which obviously uses melody and lyric from Ms. Lauryn Hill’s “Doo Wop (That Thing),” does credit the original artist, as does “Coldplay,” which does the same thing with their “Yellow.” I’m unsure as to why Lizzo chose to include so much borrowed content in this album, when she has so clearly demonstrated that she can write her own “Yellow”s. 
    Though the references to masks and costumes in “Everybody’s Gay” were clearly not intended to be a Halloween reference, the song’s kinship with “Thriller” makes me feel like Lizzo knew it would be playing alongside “Monster Mash” come October, the same way “Birthday Girl” will become the best song ever on many Gen Z girls’ 21st birthdays. “Birthday Girl” feels like a project Lizzo used to cross “write birthday song that won’t stop playing for the next 78 years” off of her to-do list. Also, she uses the word “emosh” (pronounced as the first two and a half syllables of “emotional”), which is interesting.
Others awkwardly reference popular culture, as seen in “Coldplay” or “The Sign,” which pulls from the popular Tik Tok trend that goes something like “if you see this, this is your sign to _______.” It’s uplifting, yes, but a little too kitschy if you ask me. “If You Love Me” randomly pulls from The Lion King. Couldn’t explain that one.
The pop culture references are well and creatively intentioned, but the combined disjunction and un-subtlety of them makes them awkward — and very unexpected from Lizzo. 
The problem, mostly, is that the album is not what I expected. Her teaser single, “About Damn Time” was simply so good in comparison to the rest of the album. It feels genuinely Lizzo — the way she uses the word “Balenci-ussy” rings so much right-er than “emosh.” It’s fun and cool and the only song that even came close to matching it was “To Be Loved (I Am Ready),” a euphoric little piece about healing that comes through much better than “The Sign” ever could. 
I wish I could say more good things about this album. The truth is it grooves quite a bit. I just couldn't get behind the writing, and much of that is most likely not Lizzo’s fault. I guess I’ll just have to wait for her next drop.
RENAISSANCE, Beyoncé 2022
In contrast to “Special,” the teaser for “RENAISSANCE,” “BREAK MY SOUL” was absolutely horrible. I don’t think I could get through even half of it. It set my expectations for the album extremely low, where, strangely, they were exceeded. 
    I would say that I felt like a lot of the album was similarly uncharacteristic for Beyoncé, but I think she gets a little bit of an out since a lot of the style I’m comparing to is from almost 20 years ago now. Beyoncé has been evolving since “Lemonade,” and I think I can accept that some of the newer sounding things on “RENAISSANCE” are a result of that. Even the all-caps format.
    I’m going to keep this review relatively short, both because I exhausted myself talking negatively about Lizzo, and also because a decent amount of the tracks on this album are too similar or unremarkable to talk about. Much of it is what I would call “vogue music” as in “music that is good for voguing,” especially “PURE/HONEY,” “MOVE,” and “SUMMER RENAISSANCE.” The lyricism throughout is consistently hip-hop confidence-boosting: “only the radio can play me” from “HEATED” or all of “COZY.” Again, I want to say that Beyoncé can do better than this. It’s fun but not super interesting, especially when it’s repeated in every song on the album. Even “AMERICA HAS A PROBLEM” just talks about how sexy Beyoncé is, which apparently was meant to be a metaphoric attempt at addressing the drug problem in the U.S. Not sure about that one.
Pieces like “HEATED,” “ALIEN SUPERSTAR,” and “VIRGO’S GROOVE” stuck out to me as being particularly good and groovy. In general, the album was sufficient to be a success for Beyonce, though, again, I wish I had more good things to say about it.

Ladies and gentlemen, it’s the Muppet Show (album)! - Kermit the Frog
The Muppet Show album, entitled “The Muppet Show,” is a Grammy Award-winning, two-sided, soundtrack album produced by Jack Burns. Presented by Kermit the Frog and released between the airings of the first and second seasons of the eponymous TV show, the album stars a wide array of Muppets, many of whom are now condemned to obscurity. You’ve of course got Kermit, Gonzo, Fozzie Bear, Sam the Eagle, Rowlf – all popular entertainers in their own right. Some of the less well-known – yet still fan favorite – Muppets also appear here, such as the members of Electric Mayhem, Miss Piggy, Robin, Scooter, and Bunsen Honeydew (interestingly without Beaker, as he only joined the Muppet Show for the second season onwards). We are gifted with wonderful little interludes starring perpetual curmudgeons Waldorf and Statler. And some truly terrible Muppets like Nigel and Hilda are also here. 
The opening track, titled “The Muppet Show Theme,” is exactly what one would expect, complete with a classic Fozzie Bear joke. In the section of the song reserved in normal introductions for the introduction of the human guest star, Kermit instead introduces “The First Original Genuine No Money-back Guaranteed Muppet Show Cast Album.” The Muppet Show opening is one of those classic unskippable TV intros, and I know that when I do my semi-annual rewatches, I have never skipped it once. There aren’t any other noticeable changes between the season 1 show version and this album version, however that is to be expected as “The Muppet Show” is a collection of acts from the first season of “The Muppet Show” show. The advent of Youtube, Disney+, and other more illicit ways of acquiring these acts has made the production of this type of compilation album nearly irrelevant, but adults and children alike can still find joy in material like it. For example, as a small child, I was literally – no joke – an avid listener of “The Sesame Street Book & Record,” the 1970 compilation of “Sesame Street” songs. And no, I didn’t even watch “Sesame Street,” as I’ve always been more of a “Muppet Show” man. I literally — still not joking — owned stuffed animals of the members of Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem.
The second track is “a little Muppet Show music from Mississippi”, “Mississippi Mud” performed by The Gogolala Jubilee JugBand. You haven’t heard of this muppet jug band because they were just a collection of barely named Whatnots that disbanded before the second season, reportedly due to a serious dispute over the correct amount of holes to put in a washtub. It’s a shame, because their cover of “Mississippi Mud” has an exciting dynamism that feels really “muppety.” Here we also get our first Dialogue between Statler and Waldorf. I write Dialogue with a capital D as I wish to invite comparison with Plato’s Dialogues. I’d even say that S&W surpass Plato’s. Instead of mere morality tales, we get comedic insights into the art of musical theater criticism, and the afterglow of a performance. Statler and Waldorf begin with high praise for the preceding act, but as they continue to dwell on it, their previous appraisal has been reevaluated many times. Thirteen seconds after they began expressing their thoughts, they began booing, casting down the act the same way Rolling Stone cast Steve Earle out of their 500 Greatest Albums of All-Time list after 2012. 
We then get another brief interlude in which Miss Piggy insults Kermit. I’ve been a fan of the Permit pairing for as long as I can remember, but you can tell throughout this album that the relationship between the swine and the frog is not as steady as it would later become.
We then get “Mahna Mahna.” What is there to write about “Mahna Mahna” that hasn’t already been written. The mondo film deep cut turned radio hit, this performance by Mahna Mahna and the Snowths is classic, yet feels uninspired. A classic song turns underwhelming when heard and not seen.
Next, we have another segment straight from episode 101, the Great Gonzo eating a tire set to “Flight of the Bumblebee.” A classic Gonzo stunt turns rotten when you can’t see his excellent munching, and Kermit calling it “One of the most original and unusual acts you’ll ever see, particularly on a record album” just comes off as an all too obvious joke; Why would I want to listen to this, when I could be seeing it for myself instead?
We next get “Mr. Bassman,” performed by the most excellent duo of Scooter and Floyd Pepper, with a strong backing by Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem. It only makes sense to put Floyd “the bass player” Pepper on Mr. Bassman. Floyd shows his strong vocal control with the bassy depths he lowers his voice too, which Scooter complements with a peppy upbeat song. This is a real joyful song, and redresses the ship after the two middling earlier segments, steering us straight towards the magnificent songs that make up the rest of side one.
The next comedic interlude is between Kermit and Fozzie Bear. Fozzie does some hat tricks that “somehow [don’t] quite make it on our record,” as Kermit explains. Fozzie bear is one of my comedic idols, which gives this segment a soft spot in my heart that would have been cast out had I been a purely objective reviewer. 
Track six is “Cottleston Pie,” performed by Rowlf the dog. Rowlf the dog is my favorite muppet, and “Cottleston Pie” was one of Jim Henson’s favorite songs. During my research for this article, I stumbled upon recordings from Jim Henson’s “St. John’s Memorial.” During this memorial, Frank Oz, Jerry Nelson, Dave Goelz, Richard Hunt, Steve Whitmire, and Kevin Clash sang Jim Henson’s favorite Muppet songs as the muppets. It is very moving, and it gets my heart crying every time I watch it. Frank Oz, one of Henson’s closest friends, sings the song, as Henson had previously voiced Rowlf. In the album being reviewed here, Rowlf explains the song’s dynamics and key changes, ever the musician. During the memorial, he doesn’t need to.
Next, Marvin Suggs and his Muppaphone play “Lady of Spain,” with the muppaphone’s Ows serving as the sole lyrics. The muppets frequently experimented with form for the sake of comedy. In fact, the whole format of the show as a seemingly Vaudevillian skit show with behind the scenes drama was pretty influential, even without the non-human aspects. As with the other songs on this record, the focus is on the muppet, and not the cover. This commitment is what can make characters like Marvin Suggs feel realized, even when they are simple Whatnots.
The penultimate track of side one is “Lydia the Tattooed Lady,” performed here by Kermit the Frog, and in the memorial by Kevin Clash channeling Elmo. I’m too old for Elmo. Kermit performs with an exuberance you don’t usually see from him, as he is usually confined to more straight man type roles. Ever the consummate showman, he uses this opportunity to sing his heart out, his voice cracking with excitement. This track is strong enough that I rarely skip it, even though the next track is…
“Halfway Down the Stairs” is purely powerful. Introduced by Kermit as his favorite of their more obscure songs, this is once again a favorite of Jim Henson. This is an adaptation of a classic nursery rhyme by A. A. Milne, sung here by Robin, Kermit’s nephew. I cannot credit the muppets for the lines full of meaning, but I can credit them for their restraint. In an album full of bombastic and gimmicky adaptations, here Robin knows to take it slow and contemplative. It’s impressive that a muppet can extract this much sentimentality in a song devoid of the usual muppet tropes. I understand how it can feel to be halfway down the stairs, where “It isn’t really anywhere, it’s somewhere else instead.”
This concludes side 1 of “The Muppet Show.” You should now listen to the album, findable on amazon.com for $104.99, and youtube.com for $0.00. Come back next week for Muppet Corner, where we’ll be tackling the second side of this album.

Dear Cassandra,
When I woke up this morning, I was not tired; I was simply missing Lou so much that I couldn’t stand to be awake. I had a dream that he wrote a poem for me on the back of an ABP receipt and I found it and I cried. But I couldn’t find him. It’s silly too, because he doesn’t even go here, but he seems so central to this experience for me. I don’t know how much longer I will last.
    You, on the other hand, must be having a blast right now. I know you’ve been waiting for the start of classes so you can see Wendy again. I can’t wait to hear about all the things you’re going to paint this semester. Can I come sit in studio with you sometime? I’m getting sick of Baker.
    Have you ever noticed how we take our backpacks everywhere here? I don’t think there’s anywhere I go without my backpack. I took my backpack to Fifth Clyde last night. Sasha from that annoying physics class I had to take last year asked me to come over and help her put furniture together. I think she still remembers how much help I asked for on the homeworks. Anyways, I wanted to tell you about it because something super weird happened when I got home, but I need to give you all the context - and also I met some really interesting people. Sasha’s roommate’s name is Kandace; she’s a CS major and really quiet. We didn’t talk that much, but while Sasha and I were screwing the legs onto this shelf thing she was making, she overheard us talking about Lilly, who was also in our physics class. Lilly is supposed to be away on semester abroad right now — I think in Spain — but Kandace insisted that she had seen her while she was walking to class today. Sasha and I literally pulled up the picture from her instagram of her in Spain, but Kandace insisted on what she’d seen. She said that she’d spoken to her and Lilly said she was living in Gardens this year, which I said was impossible because I was living in Gardens and I hadn’t seen her. I didn’t feel like arguing with her, and then we were interrupted anyway.
    There are a couple of guys living in the apartment across the hall from Sasha, and one of them, Heron I think, came over to ask for tape, so we asked him what it was for and he told us he was hanging this enormous poster and did we want to come over and see it. Obviously we walked across the hall and then there was just this enormous poster with a picture of Farnam on it and he couldn’t put it up on his own, so we took Sasha’s tape and we helped him put it up. His roommate Henry came in at some point to say hi.
    When I left, it was really late, and I was doing one of those classic trudges across campus at midnight, except that now I was walking across Fifth and the little WQED parking lot. I guess that’s growing up. I still had music blaring in my headphones while I walked, though. Some things never change.
    I scanned into Gardens and headed upstairs, and as I was walking to my room, I saw a figure ahead of me. It was Lilly. I said her name, but she kept going, bringing me on a wild chase down the incredibly windy hallways. I was close enough behind her that I could see her stepping into one of the rooms, but by the time I got there, saying her name once more, the door closed in my face. On the door, there were two name plates shaped like frogs. One said George, and the other said Lincoln.
It was so strange but I was so tired again, so I just turned around and went back to my room. Sometimes that’s all I can do here. I am writing this because going to bed feels too anticlimactic. I hope I will not dream again.
Love, 
    Maggie

Quentin Tarantino’s 2009 movie “Inglourious Basterds.” Holy shit, where do I start? Anyone who knows me or has even spoken to me for more than about twelve seconds knows that I am just utterly obsessed with this movie. I watched it for the first time over winter break in my freshman year of high school, and I swear to God I have not been the same person since. “Inglourious Basterds” takes place in Nazi-occupied France and tells the story of Operation Kino, an Allied Forces plot to sabotage a big Nazi Party event and take out several members of the German high command all at once. The main agents of this plan are Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) and his band of Jewish-American soldiers (the titular Basterds, including such icons as B.J. Novak and Eli Roth), collaborating with the German movie star and British spy Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger) and British Lt. Archie Hicox (played by Michael Fassbender). Throughout it all, S.S. Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) is one step behind them, right up until he isn’t.
I have loved this movie so much and for so long, it is astoundingly difficult for me to organize my thoughts into something comprehensible to put on this page. I’ll start with the plot. This story is so ridiculously satisfying. Some people get off easier than they should, some people die that maybe didn’t deserve it, but so many people get just exactly what was coming to them. I don’t want to spoil anything, because I need every single person to watch this movie, but the way this story unfolds is genuinely one of the most entertaining things I have ever encountered. This movie has a runtime of about 2.5 hours, but it doesn’t feel like it. That could be my personal flaw of having no internal clock, but it is more likely that this masterpiece is so enthralling that you don’t notice the time passing by. Every single twist and reveal makes me want to jump up and down and run around the room, even after having seen this movie a ridiculous number of times. Seriously, I’d estimate that it’s in the triple digits. That’s how much I love this movie, and how rewatchable it is. 
I think one of the objectively best parts of this movie is the cast and their magnificent portrayals of their characters. The Basterds are all so ridiculously likable, you just have to root for them. Brad Pitt is phenomenal as Aldo Raine. He’s funny, he’s genuine, I’m in love with him, he’s very aware of himself, I want him to be happy. Diane Kruger is so perfect in her role as von Hammersmark. She’s a movie star in real life so she’s got experience, but she’s just so charming. She is a girlboss to the ultimate degree. I love that she takes charge and is not overshadowed or bossed around by all the soldiers she’s dealing with. Her presence is so commanding, she is just amazing. The obvious standout of this movie, and the performance you’re most likely to have heard about is that of Christoph Waltz. Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit. If I ever met this man in the real world I would pass out, then wake up and cry, and then piss my pants before I could even attempt to work up the courage to talk to him. Waltz as Landa makes this movie. It would NOT be the masterpiece it is without him. If you watch any interviews with Tarantino about this movie, he always brings up that he thought for a long time that he had written an unplayable character, but OH MY GOD does Christoph Waltz play him. Landa is so perfectly sinister and calculating and manipulative, but so ridiculously charming. This man is so obviously exceptionally good at his job as a Nazi colonel, and yet Waltz makes you want to like him! You find yourself smiling at his antics as he finds out about fun English phrases before you remember, “What the hell, this is a villain, this is a NAZI, what is wrong with me?” I swear there is nothing wrong with you! Christoph Waltz is just simply a god on Earth and a super force on screen, not to mention the fact that he’s fluent in English, French, and German (and shows off his skills many many times in this movie). Literally check any list ever about the best film villains of all time, I promise you that Hans Landa is on there. This whole entire cast makes me go feral. I am genuinely obsessed.
As always, you know I have to mention the score. I voraciously love this soundtrack. It heavily features Ennio Morricone, with some David Bowie and Billy Preston thrown in there. Every single part of this film is ramped up to 10, and then the score just comes in and snaps the knob right off. I want to exist in free fall while this soundtrack blasts in my ears. I want to put this soundtrack in my mouth and chew it up. I want to roll around in this soundtrack like a pig in mud. My absolute favorite scene in this movie comes towards the beginning, just after the Basterds are introduced. Aldo Raine is interrogating a Nazi sergeant, trying to make him reveal important information about troops along the road ahead. As he stubbornly and solemnly refuses, Raine calls out to Donny Donowitz (my most favorite character). He’s off screen, in the back of a dark tunnel, and as we hear him slowly approaching to execute the sergeant, Morricone’s “La Resa” comes in. It builds and builds as Donny’s bat smacking against the walls of the tunnel gets louder and louder, and right as he emerges there’s this huge(!!!) trombone entrance, and I swear to God this is the most glorious film score moment ever. It is so terrifically grand you can feel it in your chest. Every single time I watch this movie, this scene makes me want to get out of my seat and spin around the room tearing it apart like the Tasmanian devil. The music continues as Donny and the sergeant exchange a few brief words and some intense eye contact, and right as Donny’s bat connects for the first time it abruptly cuts out. I want to scream and shout and implant this scene into my chest where my heart belongs, and I am 110% sure that the score has everything to do with it.
My most beloved aspect of this movie is the gore. I am such a little freak for just ridiculously murderous and gorey movies, and boy howdy does “Inglourious Basterds” hit the spot. This is very much a Tarantino staple – absurd amounts of blood gushing everywhere, so much that you can’t possibly believe it’s real, but it’s just so much fun. I’m a real sucker for practical effects, and my boy Quentin always comes through for me. There is an astounding amount of violence and murder in this movie, so if that’s not your thing, I don’t recommend it. But, if you’re like me and you can’t get enough, I could never recommend this movie highly enough.
All in all, this movie is perfect in my eyes. I literally do not have a single complaint. About 70% of this movie is in French, German, or Italian, and I don’t need the subtitles to recite exactly what they’re saying. I can act out all 153 minutes of this film from memory. I have favorite shots, favorite sound moments, favorite trivia facts that I love to share any time I con another one of my friends into watching. Ever since this movie entered my life in 2017, I have not gone more than a month without watching it again. There are times when I’ll watch it twice in a row because it is just so magnificent. On the iconic Haley Movie Good Time - Bad Time Scale, this movie is a solid “Literally had the time of my life watching it and will never ever stop going back to it.”

The U.S. hot hit “Don’t Worry Darling” premiered at the Venice Film Festival last Tuesday, starring Harry Styles, Florence Pugh, Olivia Wilde, Chris Pine, Nick Kroll, and Gemma Chan, and directed by Olivia Wilde. The movie is a psychological thriller set in a utopian American society, Victory Town, in the 1950s. While Alice (Pugh) is living her best dream, happily married to Jack (Styles), she begins to discover and question the truth behind the town, similar to every other utopian film and piece of literature in history. 
Not to our surprise, neither the plot nor the movie are anyone’s main focus, as the production and casting captured everyone’s eye. In August of 2020, the male lead actor Shia LeBeouf announced his departure from the project, citing a “scheduling conflict.” Wilde later announced on Instagram that Harry Styles would be joining the cast as the male lead, later tweeting that “The cast is B A N A N A S.” One Direction fans and Styles stans ran to the comment section, and suddenly fan art was flying in the air. Later, during an interview with Variety on Aug. 24, Wilde commented that she fired Shia because “he was making the set environment uncomfortable.” Shia LeBeouf proceeded to email Variety both email and video receipts of Wilde begging him to stay. He said that the reason he quit was that neither he nor the other cast members could find time to rehearse. In Wilde’s video response to LeBeouf, she mentioned that this “might be a wake-up call for Miss Flo,” hinting towards some tension between LeBeouf and Pugh. 
Another thing that One Direction fans care about is Styles and Wilde’s flourishing relationship. As with many of Wilde’s brethren, she too is driven by the undeniable and uncontrollable lust for young blood. In Jan. 2021, Page Six published photos of Styles and Wilde holding hands, placing their relationship in the public eye. Their work romance was so intense that Pugh reportedly had to take on the role of directing some of the scenes in “Don’t Worry Darling.” In Matthew Belloni’s newsletter, he wrote that Pugh was unhappy with how Styles and Wilde would disappear together; three staff members also mentioned something similar. They were probably doing some late-night talking.
During the promotional events for “Don’t Worry Darling,” so many things went down, it wasn’t even funny anymore. While Wilde was promoting the movie at CinemaCon, she was served custody papers on stage. We all obviously have no clue who she’s with, or where she could be, to the point where her partner’s lawyer can’t even locate her in private. 
Wilde told Vogue that she promotes sex scenes in the movie, where Styles performs oral sex (see “Watermelon Sugar”) on Pugh. Wilde then proceeds to comment that she intends to be able to show female hunger in mainstream media, where the majority of the heterosexual scenes are focused on male pleasure. Pugh later commented that “This is not why I am in the industry.” 
During the movie’s premiere at the Venice Film Festival, Pugh only appeared on the red carpet and explained her absence by stating that she is busy on set for “Dune 2.” However, other protagonist Timothée Shablagoo was busy being backless at the Venice Film Festival. To make the audience more comfortable, the PR team strategically placed everyone while the cast was walking through the red carpet such that there was always someone between Wilde, Styles, and Pugh. Fans are questioning the relationship between the three, as it was clear that the placement of the cast members was purely because of the intensive and avoidant relationship between Styles and Chris Pine, and the internalized homophobia embedded in Styles and Nick Kroll’s hearts. After all, Styles did supposedly spit on Pine while kissing Kroll on the mouth. 
Another defining piece of evidence that there is some type of beef between Styles and Pine is seen during the Fred Insider interview, when Styles was so enraged that he did not even know how to form comprehensible sentences. During the interview, Styles expressed that he thinks “the most amazing part of the film is that it was not intended to be entertaining, but it ended up to be an entertaining film” and that his favorite part of the movie was that “the movie feels like a movie.” 
Even though the only interesting part of this movie is everything that is not the movie, there are still some aspects of the movie that I quite admire and agree with. I admire Wilde’s attempts to emphasize female pleasure, her views on sexual freedom, and other feminist theories that branched out during the third wave of feminism.

When I started really listening to music in early high school, one of the first songs I listened to on my freshly purchased Spotify Premium plan was “What You Know” by Two Door Cinema Club. Though they’ve gone on and off of my radar over the years, their songs would always manage to pop back up on a Daily Mix every now and then, and as a result, I would have to give “Tourist History” another listen. 
With their new single “Wonderful Life,” which dropped on June 16, Two Door Cinema Club signed the upcoming release of the band’s fifth album, “Keep on Smiling.” This announcement, paired with an upcoming tour with one of my favorite artists — Day Wave — led to my exploration of some of their older work, and definitely got me excited for “Keep on Smiling.” Of course, I stayed up until midnight on the release date to give it a listen. If Taylor Swift fans do it for her, then why shouldn’t I for one of my favorites?
“Messenger AD (intro)”: 8.5/10
Unlike their previous albums, “Keep on Smiling” includes a nice little intro that makes me go “oooo this is going to be good.” It feels like it’s the opening to something big — like an epic sci-fi film is about to commence. Despite its lack of lyrics, I think it delivers a very clear message of what is about to grace the ears for the next 40 minutes.
“Blue Light”: 8.9/10
“Blue Light” is one of those songs that I listen to the first time and go, “I’m not a huge fan, but this will definitely grow on me.” I was exactly right, as “Blue Light” has since grown to be one of my favorite songs on the album. It has vibes somewhere between techno and disco with a hint of rock and feels like it draws its vibes from “Gameshow” while still making its own feel. Overall, consider me a fan.
“Everybody’s Cool”: 8.7/10
This song delivers a laid back vibe that feels somewhere between “Gameshow” and “False Alarm.” While I do very much like the song, I prefer the front half of the song to the back half. The lyrics flow really well together, but the switch into the deeper then lighter feeling toward the end of the song feels a little out of place to me, which isn’t to say it’s bad. It’s probably something that will grow on me with time. I still very much enjoy the entire track.
“Lucky” 9.2/10
“Lucky” was one of the two tracks released prior to the album, along with a snippet of “Everybody’s Cool.” “Lucky” is another one of those songs that grew on me over time. The buildup to the first chorus hits, which leads into a banger of a song. It helps that the overall song is very catchy. While I didn’t love the change in tone of “Everybody’s Cool,” I am a fan of the entirety of “Lucky.” If you’re going to give the album a listen, “Lucky” is one of the songs that feels like the face of the album.
“Little Piggy”: 7.7/10
“Little Piggy” gives me mixed feelings. On one hand, it has a good beat and vocals, but on the other hand, I feel like I’m not really processing the song. In some sense, it feels like a confusing song, but I like that about it. To me, there’s not really a definitive shape to this song, nor to the album itself. At the same time, it still feels like it has its own comfortable place among the other songs in the album. Unlike the other songs I wasn’t initially a huge fan of, I’m not sure “Little Piggy” will grow much on me. I still enjoy it, but not as much as the other songs on the album. 
“Millionaire”: 7.9/10
While I might be a sucker for songs that incorporate spoken lines from outside media into them, “Millionaire” doesn’t really scratch that section of my brain. I feel like it takes a little bit too long to establish itself, but once it does, the song is really good. It feels like a more traditional Two Door Cinema Club song when it gets going, but when it returns to the spoken bits, the song feels like it loses its identity again. Regardless, I still enjoyed “Millionaire.”
“High”: 9.4/10
I don’t think “High” was the kind of song I was expecting in this album, but I am very thankful for it existing. The first time I listened to “High,” I immediately added it to some of my playlists. There’s something about the song that just clicked with me, and it’s definitely one of my favorites from the albums. It’s a song that feels like you’re reflecting on the high point of your life, but that it’s behind you and you’re wondering what went wrong, but everything about the song just feels right.
“Wonderful Life”: 9.4/10
It’s so hard for me to decide if “High” or “Wonderful Life” is my favorite song from the album. Both make Keep On Smiling for different reasons; “High” embodies keeping on smiling through the pain of life, but “Wonderful Life” says to keep on smiling because of everything good that is happening around you. “Wonderful Life” is a very catchy song that I think demonstrates the spirit of what Two Door Cinema Club really is: fun and not afraid to try something different. This song, to me, demonstrates the new flavor of Two Door Cinema club that wasn’t present in their previous albums.
“Feeling Strange”: 8.2/10
While I enjoy “Feeling Strange,” I don’t think there’s much that’s special about it. It feels fresh, but also something that late 2010s Two Door Cinema Club would have produced. Overall, it’s certainly an enjoyable song, but I don’t think it brings much new to the feel of “Keep on Smiling.”
“Won’t Do Nothing”: 8.3/10
“Won’t Do Nothing” is similar to “Feeling Strange” in that I enjoy it, but I also don’t feel like it’s anything special. I can’t help saying “lights out” when the lyric comes up, but I’m also not a huge fan of the synthetic voice filter that’s used in it. It’s a song I like, but I’m also far from loving it.
“Messenger HD”: 7.3/10
What “Messenger AD (intro)” does well, I think “Messenger HD” falls a little bit short on. It doesn’t feel like a proper conclusion to the album, but it’s still got a nice vibe to it. One note though, is that “Messenger HD” isn’t the conclusion of the album, which doesn’t feel right to me given “Messenger AD (intro)” is the opening. But I digress, it’s still a good little short song.
“Disappearer”: 8.0/10
To finish out the album “Disappearer” delivers a solid performance. While I’m not exactly thrilled about the use of synthetic voice, I still like the song quite a bit. It has some really good rhythms, and it just hits. It’s a good finish to a great album. 
Overall impression: 8.9/10
I really liked this album and it definitely met my expectations. I won’t call any particular song a weak point, but I would definitely say the back-to-back combination of “High” and “Wonderful Life” is its high point. I would highly recommend a listen through of Keep on Smiling, you won’t regret it.

As students returned to campus, Carnegie Mellon students received an update from COVID-19 Coordinator Stan Waddell regarding the current campus posture. The Carnegie Mellon community is still in its “Transitional Services” phase. This means in-person instruction is predominant with limited remote instruction. 
It is important to note that all community members are required to be up to date on vaccination and boosters unless an exception has been granted. On campus, vending machines that contain free KN95 masks and rapid tests are still available. However, testing and masking are both optional at this time. Tartan Testing is also still available by appointment. Despite the encouraged Tartan Testing for community members, it has seen little usage compared to last year. 
Last August and September, students returning to campus were required to complete two baseline asymptomatic tests. This resulted in 35,958 Tartan Tests being completed during those months. The Carnegie Mellon dashboard reports that this year, when no such testing was required, only 43 Tartan Tests were completed during the month of August. However, this number is not accurate. Looking at the public dataset shows that a total of 798 Tartan Tests were completed during the month of August, with 37 of them testing positive — a 4.64 percent positivity rate, which is the second highest so far after April 2022. 
According to the dashboard, 231 Tartan Tests were completed between Aug. 30 and Sept. 1. Of the 231, 14 of those tests were positive — a 6.06 percent positivity rate. 
As of Sept. 11, the information on the COVID-19 dashboard that appears to have been updated in the last 24 hours is the number of hospital admissions month to date (0) and vaccination rates, which was updated the previous night. The number of cases on and off campus hadn’t been updated since almost a week ago on Sept. 5, and Tartan Testing numbers had not been updated since Sept. 1 — a 10 day gap. 
However, the public dataset that is linked on the dashboard gives information that is not reflected in the dashboard. Between Sept. 6 and Sept. 9, 61 students on campus reported testing positive, 114 students off campus reported testing positive, 17 faculty and staff on campus reported testing positive, and 17 faculty and staff off campus reported testing positive. On Sept. 6, 125 positive cases alone were reported, including those reported over Labor Day weekend. 
As testing on campus is no longer required, it is expected that those who test positive report their result to Community Health and Well-Being. They are supposed to complete a Google Form describing when they tested positive, when they were last on campus, and their plans for isolating. Those who test positive or are likely to test positive are expected to isolate for at least seven days.
In a change from last semester, the University is no longer providing isolation housing for the people who test positive or those who live with them. According to the communication on the University webpage,, “Consistent with current CDC guidance for colleges and universities, residential students who test positive will be instructed to isolate in place in their currently assigned rooms, suites or apartments.” Roommates of those who test positive are expected to continue living with them because, “given the highly transmissible nature of the current variants and the fact that most people who test positive were contagious two days before symptoms appeared, it is likely that roommates have already been exposed to the virus.”

First-year students swarmed into four groups on the Cut, their energy zapped after a week of Orientation. “It had been a long day, so nobody was really thinking or worried about” the design, said fine arts first-year Kate Myers. When Carnegie Mellon’s official Instagram page posted the image on August 24, students were surprised to see they had spelled “work,” a heart replacing the “o.”
Myers thought it was funny. The designers thought it was powerful. Clarise Liu, a second-year computer science major, thought it was tone-deaf. Reactions to the post included perspectives from students enrolled, suspended, and on probation; recent alumni; and Carnegie Mellon parents. Most comments were negative, contrary to organizers’ expectations.
Michelle Zhang, a senior computer science major, saw the class photo as a timeless moment of community. Eesha Nagpal, a third-year architecture student, agreed. Zhang and Nagpal orchestrated much of the planning for the design, which alluded to the University’s motto. Orientation staff hoped the photo would encourage students to engage their passion “so it doesn’t feel like work, because you’re doing what you love,” Nagpal explained. 
“I know they were trying to go for the slogan ‘My Heart is in the Work,’ but they literally just spelled out ‘work’ as if they’re, like, Britney Spears,” said sophomore mechanical engineering and biomedical engineering double-major Jillian Haguisan. “There’s already an internal pressure to work yourself until you can’t, so we don’t need any more external pressure,” she said of the photo design.
Debates about the post resembled a broader discussion of intent versus impact. Many of the students The Tartan spoke with identified two definitions of the motto. One encourages them to love their work; the other steals their hearts to work. 
“As students who go here, we also get it,” Nagpal said of the negative connotations associated with the motto. “We as students can redefine that tradition.”
In principle, Reneé Nikolov interprets Carnegie Mellon’s maxim as a “drive to pursue what we want to do in life.” In practice, she remembers more work than heart during her undergraduate experience. “When I was studying in a space shared with other CMU students, there would be nights when I could clearly hear one of them sobbing and crying in distress,” Nikolov told The Tartan. On those nights, she knew the student did not want to talk about it. She also knew there would be nights when she was “the same way.” It was the price of putting her heart in the Carnegie Mellon “grind culture,” Nikolov said. She graduated last spring with degrees in Behavioral Economics and International Relations and Politics. 
One comment that stood out to Nikolov read, “Work from your heart, don’t put your heart in the work.” It was written by Sulaiyman Fauzi, a junior studying information systems at the Qatar campus. Zhang and Nagpal also referenced that comment, and hope it is central to the way students redefine the motto. 
“I wish that the heart meant empathy. I wish that the heart meant care for other people,” said Carnegie Mellon alum Darya Kharabi. “But the work that we’re proud of doesn’t mean anything if it’s hurting people. All of this brain power, these hard working students, it doesn’t create a net positive in the world if all of these incredible resources are being put toward creating better ways to kill and maim and oppress people,” they said of Carnegie Mellon’s pipeline to the Department of Defense. 
Kharabi graduated in December 2020 with a history degree and “longstanding complexes around work,” they said in an interview with The Tartan. They arrived at the history department after stints with fine arts, STEM, and professors who made it difficult for them to access their disability accommodations. While Kharabi enjoyed their time majoring in social and political history, they felt that humanities were often left by the wayside at Carnegie Mellon. “Overachieving wasn’t enough unless it was a specific kind of overachieving” that advanced the computer science field, they said.
The departmental hierarchy at Carnegie Mellon does not go unnoticed by humanities students, Nikolov said. “The ‘split kingdoms’ metaphor is crucial to understanding why experiences are so varied across schools within the university as well as why coordinating policy efforts among schools is so difficult,” she explained. 
In schools at the top of the food chain, some students find the academic pressures insurmountable. This is especially true when their course load is compounded by disabilities or work-study responsibilities. 
After becoming fully financially responsible for herself last spring, Clarise Liu found it difficult to keep up with her schedule as a computer science major. Her grades reflected that she was working 50 hours a week on top of classes, but she felt that the message she received from the University was: “You’re not really worth our investment. There’s nothing we can do here,” she told The Tartan. Liu was put on academic probation for the fall, suspending her financial aid. Paying full-tuition was not an option for Liu, and as she worked with Orientation staff in August, she told her friends and coworkers there was a possibility she would not be enrolling this semester. Liu was awarded aid before classes started, but said she is “still dealing with the consequences” of the uncertainty about her enrollment. 
“For a lot of students here, work-study isn’t … something they can drop,” Liu told The Tartan. “It’s a necessity to attend and to secure housing and prevent food insecurity.” She said she does not have the resources to be a “student first” and takes offense when people suggest she re-evaluate her priorities. 
Myers said the Orientation team did a good job of introducing students to the resources available to them. “There was a whole day about stress, health, and academic help,” she said. “They addressed mental health well. It was a tiring week so I don't know if I absorbed everything,” but she said she feels comfortable asking someone if she wants to learn more about student resources. 
Some students worry Carnegie Mellon does not invest enough into its student resources. “I took advantage of all of it: disabilities accommodations, academic development, the Course Center,” Kharabi recalled. “I did all the things. It didn’t make the academic rigor any less difficult.”
Chloe Cohen was put in touch with the Student Academic Success Center (SASC), which accommodated her with assistive technology for her disability. She now takes notes with an electronic pen that can record lectures, “so I don’t have to choose between taking notes and actively listening.” The pen was accompanied by access to bionic reading, which presents one word at a time. “You can’t convince yourself you didn’t pay attention and go back; it forces you to continue reading,” Cohen explained in an interview with The Tartan.
Both accommodations have made a striking difference for Cohen. But she has only been able to test them out at the Community College of Allegheny County (CCAC), where she is taking classes during her year of academic suspension. She was only connected with assistive technology when she got notice last spring that, if her Incompletes did not meet certain grade minimums by the end of the summer, she would be suspended for a year. 
When she returns to campus next fall for her junior year, Cohen said she can tell the accommodations will have an even bigger impact than do now (“CCAC lectures are easy.”). Yet she also wishes the pen and bionic reading had been offered to her before her grades became irredeemable. The School of Drama is “too intense to work from your heart,” Cohen said. When she returns, though, she wants to live by Fauzi’s rewrite: “Work from your heart, don’t put your heart in the work.”
According to Zhang and Nagpal, Associate Dean for First-Year Orientation Julie Schulz introduced the class photo design years ago. “For me, the motto speaks to our passionate CMU community,” Schulz wrote in an email to The Tartan. “One of our most important goals in the First-Year Orientation program is to help new students explore and develop their passions” academically, professionally, and socially, Schulz explained. 
Orientation staff hoped the generic design could be used broadly for promotional material, Zhang explained. She and Nagpal were proud of the design. As for the negative feedback: “I hope people take action about the things they want to change, instead of just [posting] performative comments,” Nagpal said. “Those are things I care about too.”

On Feb. 24, 2022, the might of the Russian military began marching into Ukrainian territory. To the Russian high command, the operation was calculated as [short and straightforward.]Within 48 hours, sympathetic Ukrainians stationed in the East would refuse to fight and Russians would stroll into Kyiv without firing a single bullet, shooting one tank shell, or dropping a bomb. Unfortunately for those Russian officials, they miscalculated the fervor and nationalism of the Ukrainian defense and leadership, who were there ready to fight off their invaders. What was supposed to be a few days has, on August 24, turned into a 6 month stay. 
While Ukrainians have some time to celebrate their defenses, the war which is ravaging their population seemingly has no end in sight. While many battles and offensives have begun and ended since February, multiple skirmishes are ongoing within the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions of Eastern Ukraine. Foreign aid in support of Ukraine is continuing at massive scales with the United States and United Kingdom giving $3 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, just in time for the six-month anniversary. Furthermore, the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, continues to appeal to the rest of the world for its support as they predict a long conflict. Most importantly, both the World War II-scale refugee crisis and civilian casualty numbers continue to increase in size.
Possibly the most pressing development as the seasons change is the shift in strategy in the Southeast: a Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kherson and Kharkiv. Beginning August 29, the Ukrainian army is attempting to take back Russian occupied territory in the South, specifically Kherson. Following a string of defeats for the Ukrainian army in the past few months, a stable front and important breaks in the Russian high command in the South has allowed the Ukrainian army to advance. Within just one week of the Kherson counteroffensive beginning, multiple villages have been taken back by Ukrainian forces, including a ceremonial lift of the Ukrainian flag in the center of Vysokopillya on Sept. 6. A secondary offensive North of Kherson, specifically Kharkiv, has just recently begun alongside the Kherson offensive on the same day Vysokopillya was won back. As of Sept. 7, Balakliya has been confirmed encircled by the Ukrainians, and Western intelligence predicts Verbivka, which is two miles northwest, has been fully retaken. On the Kharkiv counteroffensive, Pentagon official Colin Kahl said, “I certainly think things are going better on the Ukrainian side right now in the south than is true on the Russian side.”
Ukrainian officials, as tradition would tell, are a tad more cautious than Western intelligence. According to Oleksiy Arestovych, an aid to President Zelensky, the counteroffensives will be lengthy operations: “Of course, many would like a large-scale offensive with news about the capture by our military of a settlement in an hour, but we don’t fight like that…funds are limited.”  While these initial victories in Kherson and Kharkiv boost morale and take back lost territory, it is only the beginning of a costly operation that could last months.

On the morning of Thursday, Sept. 8, news broke on Twitter that Queen Elizabeth II was on her deathbed. Dr Uju Anya, a faculty member in the Department of Modern Languages at Carnegie Mellon, tweeted the following message to her thousands of followers: “I heard the chief monarch of a thieving raping genocidal empire is finally dying. May her pain be excruciating.” The tweet went viral and led to controversy on Twitter. Anya followed up the tweet by explaining that her family were survivors of the Biafran genocide in which Britain was a crucial actor. It was quote-tweeted by Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, which led the tweet to reach even more people: “This is someone supposedly working to make the world better? I don’t think so. Wow.” Hours later, Carnegie Mellon posted a message on Twitter saying, “We do not condone the offensive and objectionable messages posted by Uju Anya today on her personal social media account. Free expression is core to the mission of higher education, however, the views she shared absolutely do not represent the values of the institution, nor the standards of discourse we seek to foster.”
“Academic freedom” is perhaps one of the most discussed terms in the Carnegie Mellon community in recent years. In an email announcing the launch of the Commission on Academic Freedom and Freedom of Expression in December 2020, President Jahanian explained, “academic freedom catalyzed the knowledge creation enterprise, protecting faculty and other community members from retribution for exploring the limits of human understanding through research, teaching and service.” The discourse surrounding academic freedom and free speech in higher education is perennial, but starting in 2020, after the controversial Trump-era former Acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell was appointed as a senior fellow at the Institute of Politics and Strategy at Carnegie Mellon, it reached a fever-pitch. 
Grenell was particularly vocal about his anti-mask beliefs at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic was at its peak and Carnegie Mellon itself was enforcing strict masking and social distancing rules for those on campus. Of course, he also couldn’t resist branding the COVID-19 virus as the “Chinese Virus”, using the racist and xenophobic dogwhistle in a tweet. Grenell’s Twitter was overall a source of controversery where he spread misinformation about the 2020 election and had a history of engaging in anti-semitic rhetoric.
It was not as if there wasn’t any pushback about his appointment and his subsequent behavior from the community - several faculty members and students signed letters and petitions, held discussions with members of the university administration. Once again — just for the emphasis — all of Grenell’s activities and statements, including the hate speech and election misinformation, were on his Twitter page for anyone to see. Not unsurprisingly, they did drum up multiple storms of controversies online during his one year as senior fellow. Still, Carnegie Mellon defended his appointment on grounds of intellectual diversity and academic freedom. When Grenell’s activities directly endangered the very cornerstone of American democracy — integrity of elections — Carnegie Mellon came out to defend his right to free speech. 
In a letter addressed to the community in November 2020, President Jahanian wrote: “the times when the nature of our debate is most controversial is precisely when our defense of free speech is most needed”, “I believe that the long-term reputational damage to CMU is potentially far greater if we are perceived as an institution of higher learning that is intolerant of other viewpoints”, and “I still maintain that, in order to protect the free and open society we all cherish, we must lean into our democratic values to respond to these tensions — as uncomfortable as that sometimes feels. Healing the divisiveness that is the root cause of these issues requires building bridges to others, not putting up barriers or excluding people.”
These are powerful words indeed, capturing a sentiment that is crucial to furthering academic growth and fostering a spirit of intellectual courage. Academic freedom at Carnegie Mellon has been a cornerstone in the success of this institution. It has enabled us to debate and ideate - it has given thousands of students, faculty, staff and alumni the courage to think differently and put in the hard work to solve some of the world's most pressing problems. Faculty members should be empowered by the administration, and students should be empowered by faculty and the administration, to speak up and engage in a healthy discourse to develop ideas that make our world a better place to live in.
However, the statement put out in social media by the Carnegie Mellon Media Relations team on Dr Uju Anya’s tweet falls very short of the ideals noted in President Jahanian’s original defense of academic freedom. Especially when considering that Carnegie Mellon was fully committed to weathering out the storm that was Grenell’s time as senior fellow when he was doing his best in attempting to undermine American democracy while offering a whimper of a condemnation, there is no justification for the cowardly statement put out by media relations that simply notes “free expression is core to the mission of higher education” while going on to offer condemnation by explicitly distancing the institution from Dr. Anya’s opinion. Her statements were her personal opinions and may have been distasteful to some, but her subsequent tweet still offers more context on a personal level and a scholarly understanding to Queen Elizabeth’s less discussed legacy as head of a colonial empire in the 1960s.
Contrastly, Carnegie Mellon did not hesitate in giving out the following statement when Grenell was actively tweeting and giving interviews spreading misinformation about election fraud: “Like all members of our faculty and staff, Mr. Grenell is free to engage in political activity on his own time. Carnegie Mellon does not engage in partisan political activities and has no further comment.” It is both hypocritical and disingenuous that while academic freedom, free expression, and intellectual diversity were excuses to give Grenell the benefit of the doubt in actions and statements that caused tangible harm, all context was separated from Dr. Anya’s statements and the University did not even come up with a whimper of the magnitude of defense offered to Grenell. 
The fact that the statement came out after one of the richest and most powerful men in the world, Jeff Bezos (a man who has gotten to his position on the back of rampant exploitation), criticized Dr. Anya in a tweet is concerning. While Amazon has donated millions of dollars to the university when he was CEO of the company, she has vocally and publicly supported the unionization efforts of Amazon workers in recent tweets. It’s frustrating that the administration often took several days or weeks to respond to tireless advocacy from the community on the Grenell issue, but took mere hours to craft and push out this statement after Bezos’ tweet. Perhaps the motive wasn’t only to reassure donors like Bezos and was instead to placate the growing mob, but still the statement’s lack of reinforcing the importance of academic freedom among other issues is a poignant example of a short-term decision that compromises supposedly deep-rooted, foundational values. 
That there has been an outpouring of support to Dr. Anya from within the Carnegie Mellon community is a testament to our strength of commitment to free expression. It is not enough to form committees and host speaker series on this issue. We deserve to see concrete actions that communicate to those at Carnegie Mellon that this institution will stand by to support its scholars and their rights respectively. 
Commitment to academic freedom and intellectual diversity cannot be half-hearted and withdrawn when convenient. There are many scholars in this university engaged in studies that are highly contentious as they challenge longstanding systems and thought-processes. Carnegie Mellon needs to show that it is committed to supporting such scholars who will inevitably face backlash from those who benefit from such systems or are uncomfortable with change. There are people in this university whose lives and experiences diverge from their association to this institution and actively inform their valuable work — these experiences may carry deep pain and generational trauma, especially for those from marginalized communities around the world. Paulo Freire highlights the personal and political nature of education in his book “Pedagogy of the Oppressed” by writing, “There's no such thing as neutral education. Education either functions as an instrument to bring about conformity or freedom.” Academic freedom should be used to protect the voices of those who were long marginalized and are making strides in academia to provide their much-needed perspectives.

We, the undersigned Carnegie Mellon students of past and present, are writing in solidarity with Dr. Uju Anya. We recognize her immensely impactful role on campus and believe firmly in her right to free speech and safety. Carnegie Mellon’s public condemnation of her tweet provides no institutional protection from violence and places her in a precarious position, ignoring a long history of institutional racism and colonialism. Rejecting calls for “civility” that are frequently leveraged against the marginalized to silence dissent, we express our solidarity with Dr. Anya and reject the tone-policing of those with legitimate grievances.
Colonized people and their descendants do not owe their colonizers decorum or well wishes, and many will most certainly not rue their demise. Our ancestors and contemporaries alike faced the violence of colonization and those now passed did not get the chance to do so peacefully on their own lands. Despite reigning over the last years of Britain’s colonial hold over the world, Queen Elizabeth II represents the worst of the white supremacist power that continues to plague Africa and beyond. It is clear that in her 70 years as monarch, little was done to rectify the immense damage caused by colonization and the horrendous crimes against humanity that occurred in many colonies during colonial rule. Rather, through campaigns like Operation Legacy, Britain and its monarchy have escaped culpability by whitewashing and rewriting their sordid history.
We have seen the brief statement distancing the school from Dr. Anya’s tweets, claiming she does not represent the school’s values. We agree. Dr. Anya certainly does not represent the values of Carnegie Mellon. A university with unceded First Nations land and only nine Black tenured professors out of 477 cannot possibly share the same values as an African-Caribbean Black woman who is also an intersectional feminist, can it? Given Carnegie Mellon’s statement, one has to wonder, is the silencing of people of African and Caribbean descent in line with Carnegie Mellon values? Is the right to the full expression of emotions and speech reserved for Americans of a specific hue?
We note that in the official Carnegie Mellon response to a student letter on November 18, 2020, which voiced concerns about tweets by Richard Grenell, Carnegie Mellon told the community: “The very essence of the free speech principle is defending the right of others to express their views. Indeed, the times when the nature of our debate is most controversial is precisely when our defense of free speech is most needed.” Carnegie Mellon also said: “I know many in our community are concerned that the way in which Mr. Grenell is expressing himself is reflecting negatively on the university and its reputation; however, I believe that the long-term reputational damage to CMU is potentially far greater if we are perceived as an institution of higher learning that is intolerant of other viewpoints.” If the University felt no need to distance itself from the false and racist tweets of Mr. Grenell that were under question, what criteria does Dr. Anya’s tweet fail to meet that demands such a response? Is frank speech convenient only when it upholds colonialism and white supremacy? Is her Blackness the distinguishing factor? We also ask: what does it mean for Carnegie Mellon’s attitude toward diversity, equity, and inclusion when the school fails to denounce a white supremacist professor’s speech but goes out of its way to disavow a decolonial Black female faculty member’s thoughts?
Situated historically, the tenor of Dr. Anya’s comments pale in comparison to the systemic violence the British monarchy and its collaborators have inflicted on the globe. Moreover, to condemn Dr. Anya’s comments without recognizing a decolonial perspective is to condone white supremacy and the white supremacist harassment she has already received. We shall no longer continue the colonial project of muting ourselves. But, like Dr. Anya, we do not need Carnegie Mellon’s approval to rejoice over the death of Queen Elizabeth, who reigned over what Professor Anya observed is “a thieving, raping, genocidal empire.”
In conclusion to this letter, we hereby ask that Carnegie Mellon students continue to sign our petition as an expression of solidarity with Professor Anya and request that Carnegie Mellon preserve and protect Professor Anya’s position within the University. At the same time, we are cognizant that some students may not feel comfortable signing this letter out of fear of retaliation from the University and/or other institutional and non-institutional actors.

Last year was interesting for Scobell. Newly furnished with air conditioning units in every room, it was ready for the eighty-something freshmen that entered its four stories in late August. These freshies — “Scobros” as they are often called — were almost all thrust into this new dorm against  their volition, victims of a cruel housing system that simply cannot accommodate demand. These Scobros would make their dorm their home, and grow to live with its peculiarities. When a faucet was stolen from the bathroom whilst the Scobros were at a big game, there was amusement, but not shock. 
Afterall, the bathrooms were grimy and puddly, one with a large traffic cone propping the door and a drain right next to it, the floor slightly slanted so that the gray water could theoretically evacuate the premises. The men of Scobell were blessed with open urinals, a gift for the members of the last all-male dorm. And they would never forget their showers three, blocked from the world with nothing but a measly yellow plastic curtain. The first could fit a whole snowman, but had the water pressure of a withered old man. The second had a blackish mold-like substance that hovered above all who showered under it. And the third was cold and dank. Beyond the white tiles laid the grayish-greenish-brownish floor, slick and reflective. Many days one could find bare footprints printing an aquatic trail towards somebody's room. 
And what a sight these rooms were — cramped and furnished in the way only male dorms could be, yet basking in an AC hard fought for by previous Scobros. It’s no wonder that these men would congregate in their lounges, if they happened to have one. The basement lounge was large, with frequently unplugged vending machines and measly washers and dryers and a kitchen island. Bottom dwellers and bottom-dwellers alike would meet here, watching “Breaking Bad” or playing Monopoly until sunrise. A pitiful first floor lounge existed, covered with tables for frequent congregation and a large whiteboard counting down the days until the school year’s end. There would be a lone gamer struggling at Elden Ring, eyes glued to the large television as one left to the Egg Shoppe and still glued when midnight snack came and went. Or a Super Bowl group watching, with pizza. The second floor lounge was a former office space, barely renovated. With shades down, shady groups hid behind, perhaps plotting, perhaps simply existing in all their qualities. Outside stood a water fountain with some of the best water on campus, maybe even the best. An investigative reporter tasked himself to find out, and we may soon publish the results. The third floor lounge held meetings, isolated from the other floors. Deliberations over dining location, infrequent movies, infrequent-er board games, hyper-common work sessions. Tight-knit as a shawl.
As the school year groaned to an end, so too did Scobell, as if knowing its renovation was arriving. The couches grew dirty, covered in the type of history unfit for the written word. The board games, purchased with the $60 Scobell game budget, descended downwards through the floors. The basement oven caught fire. Scobell was a broken phoenix, waiting to be reborn. One week before the semester’s end, the middle urinal of the third floor bathroom began to flush. And somehow, someway, it didn’t stop. Behind the exam all-nighters, the final dorm dinners, and the tearless goodbyes, the urinal could be heard in its perpetual flush, crying the tears that stoic Scobros would not. As the last male residents left for the final time, the urinal was still flushing itself away.
Miraculous how Scobell could reinvent itself in one summer, when Old Skibo still wails in the early morning for months on end.
Summer break gone, Scobell reopened. This time, for the “Scobelles.” Yet some things never change. When asked why she chose Scobell, freshman Ava Notarangelo explained: “It was not on my list. I don’t think it was on anybody's list.”
But as things stay the same, so do they change. At least for some, the Stockholm Syndromic nature of a Scobell residency has been replaced with pleasant first impressions: “I think I’m glad I got it instead of the other ones I put down. At first my roommate and I wanted Rez, [but] we’re definitely glad we don’t have to do that walk every time we want to go anywhere. It’s also super nice having the AC and new bathrooms and kitchens.”
The residents of the final single gender dorm on campus have been gifted with new carpeting covering the aforementioned slick floor, revamped lounges that offer a degree of privacy, and wonderful new bathrooms. Obviously gone are the urinals, and here to stay are new covered doors, increasing privacy for anyone who wants to shower or use the toilet. A center peninsula of sinks has sprung up, and people seem content. Who knows what the future holds for this old building. More people are accepted to Carnegie Mellon every year, and even with the new dorms opening up, there may come a time where there is not enough demand, or housing cannot manage, to have a single gender dorm. Just as the men lost Hamerschlag and Scobell, perhaps the women having lost Boss and McGill will lose Scobell too soon. What then will the future hold for the best campus dorm?

For years, the warning alarms raised by teachers across the nation were ignored. Now waking up from a pandemic-induced frenzy, we have to face the consequences. 
The pandemic forced millions of students and teachers to suddenly pivot to online instruction, disrupting the already fractured American education system. Young children lost the opportunity to develop key social skills and effectively learn foundational subjects, while teachers were spread thin, struggling to convey information and maintain engagement in a virtual setting. 
Now that schools are mostly back in person, the gaps are very evident. According to a July report by NWEA — a nonprofit organization that evaluates schools — elementary school students may need at least three years to catch up to where they would have been had the pandemic not happened, and middle school students may need five years or more. 
Right now, more than ever, we need quality teachers to help children recover from months of education. Yet, reports of alarming staffing gaps have emerged across the country.
We are experiencing the worst teacher shortage in years. In January, the Illinois Association of Regional School Superintendents found that 88 percent of school districts statewide were having “problems with teacher shortages,” with 77 percent of school districts reporting that the shortages were getting worse. The Nevada State Education Association estimated about 2,700 vacant teaching positions across the state. Texas’ largest five districts each reported vacancies, ranging from 200 - 800 positions each.        
This teacher shortage couldn’t have happened at a worse time for students. But, why is this shortage happening? Teachers cite burnout from teaching during the pandemic, low pay, little respect from politicians and parents, as well as increasing restrictions on what they are allowed to say about history, race, gender, and other topics. When you pile on expanding class sizes and a general lack of supplies and support, the cracks in the education system are apparent.      
In an attempt to remedy the situation, the federal government has budgeted $122 billion to help students recover, the largest single investment in American schools. Schools accepting this money must designate at least 20 percent of the funds to academic catch-up. While this is a step in the right direction, this cannot be the sole solution to the circumstances. Given the difficulty that some schools are facing in hiring teachers, it seems unlikely that the money is all we need to close the gap. 
In effect, schools are trying everything. Wealthier districts offer wage increases and relocation bonuses, while those that can’t afford to do so are incentivizing teachers with a four-day school week and lower credential requirements. In doing so, schools that cannot compete with the lucrative packages of wealthier, suburban schools face the brunt of the shortages. Thus, unsurprisingly, the schools which serve students from low-income families suffer even more, worsening the drastic inequities that are already too-present in America.
However, this isn’t new. Lower socioeconomic communities often face the worst of teacher shortages. Increased supplies, staff, and salaries have consistently been requested by teacher unions over the past several years. Teacher burnout isn’t new either. 
The most frustrating part of this shortage is that most of this seems like it could have been prevented. States are coming up with funding and school districts are doing everything in their power to incentivize teachers. Imagine if they started putting in place support structures to help teachers decades ago. If they did, perhaps the structural integrity of the education system wouldn’t have been as disrupted when the pandemic hit. 
When professionals in essential industries in our country warn us of problems, we need to listen. How many times have we seen this happen during the pandemic? The medical system has always had staffing, supply, and insurance problems. Despite them being brought up via nurse strikes and warnings from experts, nothing was proactively done until the pandemic brought it down. 
We need to stop treating the vital parts of our society like assignments that we can procrastinate on till the last minute. This cautionary tale only shows us that it is crucial to unite and  be proactive about handling problems when warning signs appear, rather than when it’s already too late.

When I first heard the term “quiet quitting,” I assumed that people were quitting simply by not showing up to work. That’s the quietest way to quit, right? In actuality, quiet quitting doesn’t actually involve quitting your job at all; it ranges anywhere from solely doing what you’re expected to do at work (and nothing extra) to reevaluating your relationship with your job and focusing more on work-life balance.
Though we haven’t quite escaped the grasp of COVID yet, people are reflecting on the past two years to see how they should move forward with their careers. To me, the fact that the term “quiet quitting” describes simply doing your job and nothing else is quite absurd. Don’t get me wrong, I completely understand going above and beyond for your job if it’s something you enjoy, but employees shouldn’t be expected to do that on a regular basis. Quitting has negative connotations, and doing the work you’re assigned and nothing more is completely valid.
It’s easy to feel in the campus environment that “quiet quitting” is a foreign concept to many students. For the past two years, I was in a similar position. I was driving myself to do as many classes and activities as possible, to the point of almost burning myself out completely. After all, isn’t that the Carnegie Mellon Experience™? 
In the end, the atmosphere at Carnegie Mellon will stick with students for years to come. While many workplaces post-college aren’t competitive, I can’t help but feel based on my time here so far that no matter where I end up, I will constantly have to be learning more and working to find success. I don’t want to spend the rest of my life doing nothing but work, even if I find it fulfilling. I want to take the time to relax and do things I enjoy (a.k.a. actually living my life) without having to worry that I’m constantly falling behind, but at times, I feel like I’ve never achieved that.
There is absolutely no reason why students should feel like constantly being on the grind is what you have to do to succeed at this school. Once I realized that spending every living moment on the grind of classes and activities is not sustainable, doing something analogous to quiet quitting where I considered just doing what I actually needed to do to graduate was very helpful. 
However, I don’t believe quiet quitting is a good term for what people should do. The term simply doesn’t describe it. What we should be doing is reevaluating our work-life balance and focusing on what we truly enjoy and trying to avoid doing work we simply don’t enjoy. 
If I just stuck by quiet quitting standards, then I would be doing the minimal coursework that I needed to do to graduate and that was it. But to me, that’s not fulfilling; I’m lucky and found other activities — like working on a newspaper — that I enjoy alongside my studies.
While it’s important to balance time between work and studies, it’s important to not forego the things you’re passionate about as well. When I eventually enter the workforce in some capacity, my opinion may change, but that’s not where I am right now. It’s important to remember we’re still students. Students shouldn’t be expected to dedicate all their time to studies, even though they’re technically our “jobs.” 
While quiet quitting suggests we should do only what we need to complete our degree, fulfillment for some means going above and beyond, and that’s perfectly fine. If people enjoy the constant grind cycle that hangs over the heads of Carnegie Mellon students, good for them; I know it’s not for me, and that’s perfectly fine. Finding what is best for you is important, and finding what that was for me is one of the most important things I learned recently.
Regardless of what stage of life you’re at, enjoyment and fun are important and the moment we forgo that, then what is the point of what we’re doing? While constantly being on the grind is a means to an end, there are other ways to go about our lives. If we don’t learn to prioritize enjoying what we’re doing now, then when will we ever learn to?

Promptly after Carnegie Mellon Professor Dr. Uju Anya posted a stark tweet on her personal account wishing Queen Elizabeth an “excruciating” death, major public figures like Jeff Bezos and Piers Morgan turned to social media to share their contempt for the comment. Carnegie Mellon issued a statement on Friday condemning Anya’s actions stating that “the views she shared absolutely do not represent the values of the institution.” However Anya has no intention of apologizing — “I stand by what I said” — and Carnegie Mellon’s students stand with her. 
Many have taken to social media to defend the professor, standing by her statement and expressing frustration at the institution for its response, calling it a means to protect Carnegie Mellon’s image. A student who has chosen to remain anonymous, Class of ’26, shared her belief that CMU wouldn’t have felt the need to respond if not for Bezos’ backlash, and the growing press surrounding the statement. 
Senior Sarah Niklaus drew parallels to a similar incident at Carnegie Mellon in 2020 regarding Richard Grenell and statements made on his personal Twitter account and other social media platforms that drew student and faculty concerns about his hiring. The statement Carnegie Mellon issued read: 
“Regarding Mr.Grenell’s tweets on social media and in general, given that they are an expression of personal opinion outside of his work at CMU, they are protected under the First Amendment of the Constitution… it would set a dangerous precedent for the university to take punitive action based on the way in which a member of our community is exercising their first amendment rights, even if we disagree with them.”
With this in mind, according to the standards that Carnegie Mellon set for Grenell, Anya was exercising her first amendment rights as a member of the Carnegie Mellon community. “You can really see the double standard,” said Niklaus. Carnegie Mellon seems to be making the distinction on when to condemn the actions of their community members, based on when it is in the University’s best interests externally. 
Internally, the response was a failure to open up a larger, much-needed conversation surrounding racism at Carnegie Mellon. A student who asked to remain anonymous, Class of ’23, found the response “really weird … CMU is riddled with racist professors who have actively caused harm to students with zero repercussions.” Senior Ethan Fusilero understands Anya’s positionality on a personal level, as he is Filipino and finds it “very easy to see how damaging imperialism and colonization are to a nation. Imagine if a person who ruled a country that oppressed your nation and watched your people starve was being praised for their lifetime achievements.” Fusilero sees England and the United Kingdom as a whole as the epitome of colonial power and anti-liberal ideals; thus, they find it ironic that American liberals even support the crown in the first place. As one student in the Class of ’24 stated, “It is fascinating to see how objections of colonizers are seen as more offensive than the actual colonizers themselves.”
While on campus many students stand with Anya, one student who wished to remain anonymous fears the repercussions of Anya’s tweet may further harm students of color on campus. “I think it was irresponsible of her because tweets like that will obviously draw a lot of white supremacists and incels to target CMU and specifically Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) campaigns and students of color.” However, Carnegie Mellon’s response fails to also address this crucial element of the discussion and stands with our community’s students of color. 
During this time, it is the responsibility of Carnegie Mellon faculty, students, and staff to ensure that our first priority on campus is ensuring the safety of our students of color and that we are ultimately working towards an open discourse surrounding anti-racist and anti-colonialist practices on campus.
