With an NBA “nuclear winter” looming over us and a real threat of the season being cancelled, a miracle saved everything. After almost five months of negotiations, the NBA owners and the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) finally reached an agreement.
On Friday, Nov. 25, the communal NBA fan base let out a monstrous sigh of relief when reports were released that said the two sides had reached a handshake agreement. Barring a surprise in the official voting on the deal, the lockout is finally over. So while the NBA season was not officially salvaged, everybody read between the lines. We have an NBA season.
The 66-game season starts on Christmas Day, with five marquee matchups that include an NBA Finals rematch between the Miami Heat and Dallas Mavericks and a battle between the Los Angeles Lakers and Chicago Bulls.
So I think I speak for everyone when I say, “Hallelujah.” In less than a month, NBA games will resume and we can put this chaos behind us.
Fans should thank Major League Baseball for the resolution of this lockout. With the MLB agreeing on a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) a year in advance of its expiration date, NBA Commissioner David Stern and the league would look particularly bad if the NBA were unable to salvage the season. The NFL resolving its lockout before the scheduled start of the season was probably influential on this deal being made as well.
The issues of revenue sharing, luxury tax, free agency, and different contract exceptions all caused rifts between the owners and NBPA. But none was more controversial than basketball related income (BRI). After months of deliberations, an agreement was finally made such that the players receive 51.15 percent of BRI for the first year, and 49–51 percent in the later seasons. As anyone would have predicted, the owners had the upper hand and subsequently won this battle with the players.
But I’m done with lockout and CBA discussion — let’s talk playing ball. I long for the first NBA breaking news story that isn’t about the lockout. Let’s delve into free agency and potential blockbuster trades.
The biggest free agents in the 2011 class are Tyson Chandler, Jamal Crawford, Nene Hilario, David West, Marc Gasol, DeAndre Jordan, Greg Oden, and Tayshaun Prince. The only news in the early part of the 2011–12 offseason is regarding the starting center of the 2011 NBA champion Mavericks, Chandler. It was reported that he expected not to return to the championship squad next season.
It has been rumored that the Heat are interested in the  perennially injured No. 1 pick, Oden. While a huge risk, Oden could be the piece to get Miami an NBA Title, having lacked size in their Finals run last season.
There is more talk, at this time, regarding potential blockbuster trades. There are two players who could make or break a team’s championship hopes for this upcoming season: Orlando Magic center Dwight Howard and New Orleans Hornets point guard Chris Paul, who have both often been discussed in trade talks.
Howard, the reigning two-time defensive player of the year, wants out of Orlando because he does not feel the organization is heading in a championship direction. The common opinion among experts is that Howard wants to go to Tinseltown to play with the Lakers. After seeing first-hand how great of an organization the Lakers were when they lost in the 2009 NBA Finals in five games to Kobe’s squad, it is tough to find flaws in his desires.
Paul has made it explicitly clear that he wants to be traded to the New York Knicks to team up with Amare Stoudemire and Carmelo Anthony. This would form another “Big Three,” similar to that of the Miami Heat, making New York a championship contender for the first time since the Patrick Ewing era.
Both Howard and Paul can do nothing but speculate and persuade, as their respective organizations won’t give them up for nothing, and it will take big players to get them traded.
In the midst of the storm of transaction rumors, I feel refreshed. The heavy burden of the lockout and the threat of losing the season have sailed, and the NBA can get back to its forte: playing ball.

In the final stretch of the NFL season, headlines are typically dominated by playoff and divisional races, with teams fighting for their right to play in the Super Bowl for the coveted Vince Lombardi Trophy. However, the Week 12 headlines were speared by a couple of players solidifying their reputations as “stupid.”
The Detroit Lions’ Ndamukong Suh, one of the best young defensive tackles in the game, shoved Packers guard Evan Dietrich-Smith’s helmet into the grass and subsequently stomped on his arm after a play brought them both to the ground. Suh was then rightfully ejected from the Thanksgiving game. On Sunday, Buffalo Bills wide receiver Stevie Johnson mocked Jets wide receiver Plaxico Burress in his touchdown dance, pretending to shoot himself in the leg in the end zone. Both Suh and Johnson were fiscally penalized for their stupidity, and Suh has now been suspended for two games.
I’ll start off with Suh. He is considered one of the best players in the game and has been regarded highly ever since he was a top-five pick in the NFL draft. However, since he entered the league, he has gained a reputation as one of the dirtiest players in the NFL. He has already been fined over $100,000 multiple times, with this being his first suspension. Following his actions on Thanksgiving Day, Suh has started to hurt not only his wallet, but also the reputation and success of his team.
Funny thing is, Suh proved to all of us that he hadn’t learned a thing from being kicked out of the game. During his postgame press conference, Suh repeatedly claimed that he stomped down with his foot in order to “free himself from the situation,” implying that he actually meant no harm by his actions. This is absurd. Suh clearly hasn’t learned anything, and his belated apology to the commissioner and his feeble attempt to defuse the situation later on Facebook are laughable.
Next up is Bills wide receiver Johnson, who thought it would be a great idea to make fun of Plaxico Burress’s gun-carrying mistake that occured just a few years ago. Johnson, who is known for his elaborate touchdown celebrations even with today’s strict NFL celebration rules, went a step further by referencing something that put another player in jail. As if that wasn’t enough for him, he proceeded to fly like a Jet and then stumbled to the ground in order to enact a “plane crash.” Johnson was then penalized 15 yards, leading to an easy Jets touchdown the next drive, benefitting from great field position. To make matters worse, Johnson eventually dropped two wide-open touchdown passes when the Bills needed a touchdown to win the game. 
Like Suh, Johnson’s reaction after the game told us all we need to know. When asked about the dance, Johnson blew it off, saying he was disappointed that it cost the Bills the game but did not think the dance was in bad taste, and, at the time, he did not apologize to Burress.
Although this is not the norm in the NFL, it’s disappointing to see professional football players endangering other players (Suh) or mocking other players’ misfortunes (Johnson). The worst part is that it is usually the same players getting fined or suspended. 
I know that the league will never be perfect, but it’s guys like Suh who give the league an unwarranted “bad boy” image. Given that Suh is young and has already had many transgressions, the NFL should look into suspending him for much longer depending on what he does next. I’m not one for suspensions, but some just won’t learn until you really punish them, and justifiably so, Suh has been suspended for the next two games.

After a three-game win streak, the Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team has lost two straight. In the last four, the men have gone 2–2, playing two very contrasting modes of basketball.
In the two victories, senior John Duhring led the offense to at least 40 percent shooting from the field. The two losses saw the Tartans shoot sub-40 percent and Duhring average three points.
When Duhring was hot, his teammates also shot well. In the first of these four games, the Tartans picked up their success from the previous game against Penn State Behrend to win their second straight game at the expense of the Allegheny College Gators.
Duhring poured in 19 points, followed by sophomore Rashaun Riley’s 16 points, converting on a sizzling four of five attempts from three-point territory. Duhring hit two clutch free throws and dished out five assists as the orchestrator in this 67–64 victory.
On Saturday, Nov. 26, the Tartans hosted their annual DoubleTree Carnegie Mellon tournament. In the opening game against Otterbein University, the Tartans collectively put together their most impressive offensive performance of the season as all five starters scored in double figures. This led to a 77–70 victory.
Duhring led the squad with 14 points, sophomore Christian Manoli added 13, senior John Kromka had 12, sophomore Sean Brophy had 11, and Riley poured in 10 points. The squad shot 56 percent from the field.
In the championship of the DoubleTree tournament, the Lebanon Valley College Dutchmen blew out the Tartans, 78–58. Duhring struggled, scoring just four points. Kromka and Riley led the team in this bout with 18 and 15 points, respectively. But shooting just 38.5 percent from the field and allowing the Dutchmen to shoot 49.3 percent led to the Tartans’ undoing. Additionally, the Tartans were out-rebounded by 10, 48–38.
Wednesday, Nov. 30,  was an even worse performance for the Tartans. Again, Duhring couldn’t find the hot hand he had in the games against Allegheny College and Otterbein University, and was only able to hit one field goal against Catholic University. Sophomore Asad Meghani had a good game off the bench with 11 points, and Manoli and Riley had 12 each. However, their 30.5 percent field goal percentage led to just 50 points on the night, and the Tartans lost by 12 to the Cardinals. The Tartans’ defense also gave up a minus 15-rebound differential and allowed the Cardinals to shoot 44 percent from the field.
On Tuesday, the Tartans will face the Bethany College Bison on the road. The Tartans did not play the Bison last season.

Last week, the Carnegie Mellon women’s basketball team dropped to 2–4 on the year after losing a close game to Baldwin-Wallace College on Wednesday. This non-conference matchup was the first of a four-game homestand leading up to the semester break.
In the contest, Carnegie Mellon jumped out to an early lead against the Yellow Jackets and maintained that advantage through the first half, taking a 25–23 lead into the break. The score remained close through the second half, as both teams struggled to find a rhythm on the offensive end, and turnovers were contagious on both ends of the court. The Tartans’ defense allowed them to hold the Yellow Jackets to an impressive 50 points, but that was all Baldwin-Wallace needed to pick up the road win by a three-point margin.
The Tartans were led by junior forward Emily Peel, who scored a game-high 20 points. After earning an All-UAA honorable mention last year, Peel has picked up right where she left off in the 2010–11 season. She currently leads the team in scoring and rebounding with 18.7 points and 9.7 rebounds per game.
Under the leadership of Peel and her fellow upperclassmen, the team is looking to build up some momentum heading into conference action. Last year the Tartans struggled in conference play, but Peel said that this team is not the same as it was last year and has a new resolve to go with its new look.
“Our team has improved tremendously since last year,” she said. “We have seven returning players who have all experienced the tough competition we will face, and we have five very talented freshmen that add a lot to our team.”
Two of those first-years, guards Gabrielle West and MacKenzie Boyd, started making a difference early on in the season. Both players have proved to be potent offensive threats, especially from behind the arc.
Combining the young talent with veteran experience, the Tartans hope to make a statement in the UAA that they are back, ready to compete, and determined to win. According to Peel, her teammates are ready to make that statement. “We are hard workers, dedicated, and will never give up,” she said.
The women’s basketball team finishes up its home stand this week with games against Oberlin College and Point Park University on Friday and Saturday.
Yesterday, the Tartans defeated Penn State Altoona, 94–46. Peel led the way with 32 points.

The Carnegie Mellon swimming and diving team traveled to Kenyon, Ohio this past Thursday through Saturday to compete in the Total Performance Invitational. The Tartans were greeted by teams from the University of Pennsylvania, Kenyon College, Davidson College, Grove City College, Bowling Green State University, and the University of Findlay. Both Bowling Green and Findlay only presented women’s teams for the competition.
After the first day of swimming, the men held their ground in fourth place with a score of 54. They picked up the intensity during the second day of competition, earning a total of 303 points and jumping up to third place. With strong closing efforts, they added 208 more points for a total of 511 points, putting them in fourth place at the end of day three. The solid finish topped Grove City College, which placed fifth with 319 points.
The men’s team is showing signs of improvement, as the swimmers continue breaking individual career records. Among them are first-year Andrew Yee, who finished the 1,650-yard freestyle in fifth place with a career-best time of 16:10.96.
Junior Dan Glaser-Garbrick finished third in the 400-yard individual medley with a time of 4:00.74 and third in the 200-yard butterfly with a time of 1:51.06. In 2011, Glaser-Garbrick was an All-American and UAA Champion in the 200-yard butterfly and on the All-UAA Second Team for the 400-yard individual medley.
In the 200-yard breaststroke, sophomore Austin Bohn finished in third place in 2:05.68, cutting about 10 seconds off his personal record.
First-year Anton Razanav, senior Matt Stanton, Bohn, and Glaser-Garbrick swam the 400-yard medley relay in a record time of 3:27.55, finishing fifth. This beat the time of 3:35.83 set during a UAA meet on Oct. 29.
The women picked up 44 points after the first day of the invitational, putting them in fourth place to start off. After the second day of competition, the women scored a total of 197 points, putting them in fifth place. Their additional 135 points on day three proved not enough to overcome Grove City College, which finished with 369 points. The women finished with a total of 332 points, in sixth place overall.
Some swimmers reached career highs in relays. First-year Kelley Sheehan, sophomore Soleil Phan, sophomore Megan Garvey, and senior Victoria Adams swam into 10th place with a time of 7:45.51. Adams, Garvey, and Phan achieved  an All-America honorable mention for this relay in 2011, as well as All-UAA Second Team honors.
The Tartans will follow up this performance on Jan. 21 in New Wilmington, Pa. They will be competing against Westminister College and SUNY Geneseo at 1 p.m.

During the winter break, the NFL playoff season suddenly became more exciting.
The Pittsburgh Steelers got “Tebowed” in overtime of the Wild Card Round at the AFC playoffs. The defending champion and 15-1 Green Bay Packers lost in a not-so-surprising upset at the hands of the New York Giants. New passing yards record-holder quarterback Drew Brees and the New Orleans Saints lost to the upstart San Francisco 49ers.
The remaining teams are the New England Patriots, the Baltimore Ravens, the Giants, and the 49ers. The drama is palpable among these four teams.
Think back to 2007, when the 18-0 Patriots went into the Super Bowl against the surprise NFC Wild Card Giants. The Patriots were favored by 12.5 points, and there were even shirts being made that commended their undefeated season.
As many probably remember, wide receiver David Tyree of the Giants made “the catch,” where he caught quarterback Eli Manning's pass on the final drive by clamping the ball against his helmet as he hit the ground. This helped the Giants pull off one of the biggest upsets in Super Bowl history.
If these two teams meet again in the Super Bowl this season, the media hype would be insurmountable. The Patriots would have a chance at redemption and the Giants a chance to put quarterback Tom Brady to shame again.
However, this isn’t the only intriguing potential Super Bowl matchup. How about the battle between coaching brothers, Jim and John Harbaugh? Jim, who coaches the 49ers, is a rookie head coach who has turned the previously laughable team into a potential winner. John, whose coaching tenure is much longer than his brother's, is going for his first ever Super Bowl appearance with the Ravens. 
Coincidentally, both teams are built in a similar fashion. The Ravens and the 49ers are built around a great defense, most notably their star linebackers. The Ravens have arguably the most famous linebacker of all time in Ray Lewis, who is not only a defensive leader, but also a spiritual leader in the locker room. He is well known for his introductory dances and pre-game speeches that fire up his teammates.
On the other side of the ball is the 49ers' young linebacker Patrick Willis, who may be the most under-the-radar star in the league. Willis is a physical beast, and in my opinion, the best linebacker in the game right now.
That isn’t the only similarity, though. Both teams have quarterbacks who have been heavily criticized by the media, and even by their own teammates. Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco was recently called out by teammate and respected leader, cornerback Ed Reed, saying that he needed to get rid of the ball faster and be more decisive. 
On the other hand, 49ers quarterback Alex Smith didn’t even have a job before this season, but was signed on to compete for the starting job. If these two teams were to play, one quarterback would have his name etched in NFL history, whether or not he deserves it.
We know that the NFL playoffs are always entertaining to watch. But this season may be one of the most intriguing due to the similarities and histories between the competing teams. Not to mention, few predicted this final four before the season started. Although we don't know who will win the Super Bowl and the coveted Vince Lombardi Trophy, we do know one thing — the ride to the top will be exciting.

Snacking in the workplace is a common ritual, and many employees may be concerned with making the right choice when it comes to their waistlines and overall health. A group of Carnegie Mellon researchers are trying to determine the best way to encourage people to make healthier snack choices.
Researchers in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute recently developed a system that helps people make self-beneficial snacking decisions in the workplace based on theories of behavioral economics, which differs from traditional economics by assuming that people do not make the most rational decisions all the time. The research was recently published in Proceedings of the 2011 Annual Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems.
“Obesity is a growing problem worldwide,” said Jodi Forlizzi, one of the study’s authors and a professor in the departments of design, human-computer interaction, and computer science. “In our university labs and office buildings, people work long hours, often substituting snacks for meals. Having the option to choose a healthy snack is a small step towards ameliorating these problems.”
In a study involving 61 participants, the researchers first examined participants’ tendency to favor a “default option” in which a snack choice was made for them, and they could receive an alternative option only if they specifically asked. These results were compared to participants’ tendencies to rationally weigh pros and cons of a snack choice if they were asked to plan ahead.
For two consecutive days, experimenters delivered apples or cookies to participants’ offices in the afternoon. On the first day, everyone was asked to choose between apples and cookies. One group, labeled the “default group,” was told they would have apples the next day unless they specified they wanted cookies, and a “planning group” was asked to choose a snack they would like for the next day.
About half of the participants in the default and planning groups chose an apple on the first day, but this percentage increased on the second day as nearly two-thirds chose apples. More participants made the switch in the planning group than the default group, implying that the planning strategy may have had a larger effect. Researchers also asked the participants to rate their snacks and found that both groups indicated less enjoyment than a control group that was presented with the same snack choices as the first day. Possibly, the researchers thought, people felt an implicit pressure to have a healthy snack or simply didn’t like planning ahead.
In a second experiment, the researchers observed the effects of using a robot to deliver snacks to the participants. In one delivery method, apples and cookies were evenly laid out on a tray, making both choices equally accessible to participants. In another method, apples were delivered on a tray while the cookies were placed in a bag underneath the tray, making the cookies slightly less convenient to participants. 
The researchers found that making the apples slightly more accessible was effective in influencing people to make the healthier choice. Furthermore, people’s enjoyment level was generally unaffected by this robot delivery method versus being asked if they wanted a different snack than the default option. The researchers reasoned that this might be due to the lack of social pressure in the robot experiment.
A last experiment revealed that information such as calorie counts presented to participants had little effect on their snack choices, and in many cases, the information caused participants with a healthy diet to choose unhealthy snacks. The researchers proposed the possibility that since a candy bar has fewer calories than participants may have thought, they allowed themselves to indulge in junk food.
The research is just one illustration of how simple changes in user interfaces can have significant impact on people’s choices. It implies that there is great potential for behavioral economics to benefit human health.

Energy, power, climate change, atomic explosions — what scientific concepts should any future president of the United States be familiar with? One course at Carnegie Mellon aims to address exactly that.
Markus Deserno, a professor in the department of physics, teamed up with department head Gregg Franklin to teach a course titled “Physics for Future Presidents,” in which students learn science fundamentals pertaining to global scientific issues that hold social and political importance. For example, to learn about nuclear energy, students studied the basics of atoms, chain reactions, and energy. An intelligent conversation about global warming calls for a few basics on radiation and light.
“There’s a lot of stuff out there which you can’t really have a sound opinion on if you completely lack the science,” Deserno said. “So what you instead do is just listen to the sound bites of people telling you stuff. And it’s not really that hard to have an opinion on this stuff once you know a couple of basics.”
The class, which was offered for the first time in the fall 2009 semester, is open to all students and majors. There are no prerequisites, and the professors like it this way. “I think that we just want to enable our students to become more educated citizens — it doesn’t necessarily have to be for the next future president, but any voting citizen should know a couple of these things,” Deserno said.
The course had its beginnings just over 10 years ago at University of California, Berkeley. A physics professor named Richard Muller was asked to teach a qualitative physics course that covered a very wide range of topics as effectively as possible. His vision was to create a course that taught scientific fundamentals that addressed some of the most important global issues while avoiding some technical aspects such as calculus that might confuse students. Thus, Physics for Future Presidents was born.
“Can real physics be taught without math? Yes! Math is a tool for computation, but it is not the essence of physics,” Muller explained in a 2010 newsletter for the Forum on Physics and Society. “So many people in our government have a poor grasp of science, and yet if they misjudge the science, they can make a wrong decision.” After a few years of teaching the course, Muller published the textbook Physics for Future Presidents: The Science Behind the Headlines. Similar courses have spread to other universities, including Carnegie Mellon.
Franklin, who teaches the course with Deserno, believes the students are gaining a lot from the course. In one instance, the students viewed a three-minute video clip of a politician speaking to Congress about carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. “When [Deserno] was showing that three-minute clip, one of the students shouted out, ‘Where is she getting her numbers?’ That’s a successful class!” Franklin said.
The course has received positive reviews from students as well. “The professors have done an excellent job of finding realistic ways to clearly present the basic physical phenomena we all should understand,” Tyler Rice, a sophomore English major, said in an email. “This is important for students who are in fields which don’t require the in-depth study and rigorous mathematics of your typical physics class at CMU, but who still want to learn about the big picture.”
In the end, making judgments on the credibility of scientific decisions and statements is up to the students, and Deserno and Franklin hope the students have gained some tools to help them make good assessments based on scientific fundamentals.
“In recitation, [the students] were asking, ‘How do we find out the truth on some issue?’ ” Franklin said. “That’s the best but hardest question. But the fact that they’re asking that is good.”

Tiny particles, some 100,000 times smaller than the thickness of a sheet of paper, are playing an increasingly important role in our lives. Nanoparticles, as they’re called, can be found in eyeglasses, tires, and even sunscreen. Recently, Carnegie Mellon researchers have been discussing nanoparticles’ prevalence in the natural world and their potential to greatly alter the way we live.
As part of a larger consortium of faculty members from universities known as the Center for Environmental Implications of NanoTechnology (CEINT), professor Greg Lowry in the department of civil and environmental engineering recently teamed up with professor Elizabeth Casman in the department of engineering and public policy to discuss the prevalence of nanoparticles in nature and their implications in the environment. Their recent study, published last month, focuses on the prevalence, dynamic qualities, and environmental effects of nano particles.
Nanoparticles are microscopic molecules that are the building blocks for many engineered products and are typically 100 nanometers in size, although some are even as small as one nanometer. Nanoparticles have been engineered by scientists for years, but their presence and effects in nature had remained a mystery.
Cue James Hutchison. Hutchison, of the University of Oregon, experimented with the interaction between silver nanoparticles under a variety of conditions. He found that silver nanoparticles reacted differently under various environmental conditions, and arrived at the idea that nanoparticles are abundant in nature. 
Casman explained, “When these silver nanoparticles were placed in water, there was a production of more nanoparticles. The results indicated the idea that nanoparticles are ubiquitous in the natural world.”
This information stirred some curiosity within CEINT. As Casman noted, “This revelation inspired us to discuss, ‘What do we know about how nanoparticles can be formed in nature?’ ” The researchers mapped out what they already knew, including the idea that many nanoparticles that are found in nature are nearly identical to those engineered, and that nanoparticles played significant roles in natural processes.
The dynamic nature of nanoparticles was also an important topic of discussion. When introduced to the environment, their incredibly high surface area relative to their volume makes them prime candidates for dynamic changes in nature. “We realized that nanoparticles out of the jar, when they interact ... they don’t stay that way,” Casman said.
The new influx of information also spurred the researchers to consider the toxicity and environmental effects that come with nanoparticles, specifically with nanophases. 
“Nanophases” are as small or smaller than nanoparticles and display completely different properties than their larger counterparts. For example, some nanophases of metals can be more than five times harder than their respective metal nanoparticles. 
Casman and Lowry stress that nanophases must be accounted for when discussing the impact of humans producing nanomaterials, as ignoring them could lead to an underestimation of environmental risk, among other things. In an email, Lowry stated, “The potential effects of these materials on the environment and human health are unknown and must be determined prior to their widespread use in commerce.”
Despite all of this newfound information, there is still plenty that is not known about nanoparticles. “There is a lot of interesting chemistry that has yet to be worked out,” Casman noted.
More information on nanoparticles will help scientists understand how to assess toxicity, environmental impact, and environmental risks that occur when humans produce nanoparticles. Furthermore, nanotechnology may play an integral role in the future. As Lowry said, “Nanotechnology will impact areas such as nanomedicine, [and] it can help make the transportation industry more fuel efficient.” Lowry also mentioned  that nanotechnology can help water treatment. The possibilities seem endless. 
Indeed, nanotechnology may someday affect nearly everything we interact with. For now, however, scientists must continue to try to understand more about these enigmatic materials.

Many seemingly mundane objects can emit visible light if exposed to the right conditions. Tonic water, $20 bills, jellyfish, teeth whiteners, laundry detergents — all  of these items can manifest the power of fluorescence. 
All light consists of photons, which are constantly moving and thus have varying amounts of energy. The undergraduate introductory physics textbook used by Carnegie Mellon, Matter & Interactions, states that only photons within a certain range of energy can be seen by the human eye and are therefore called visible light. Photons with energy levels outside of this range, such as infrared or ultraviolet light, are invisible to the human eye.
Fluorescence is generated when a material absorbs high-energy photons and then emits photons of lower energy. The Optical Microscopy Division of the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory at Florida State University explains that when a fluorescent material absorbs a photon, the excess energy is lost as heat that is subsequently absorbed by neighboring molecules in the material. As a result, photons are re-emitted at lower energies that are now within the range visible to the human eye, making the material appear to glow. Therefore, in order for fluorescent materials to fluoresce, they normally need to be exposed to higher energy light, such as ultraviolet light.
The phenomenon may be easier to understand by looking at a more microscopic picture of what happens to an atom in a fluorescent molecule during light exposure. In an atom, electrons surround a nucleus at various distances. When ultraviolet light shines on a fluorescent material, an electron gets pushed to a higher energy state as it gains energy from the photons. However, electrons have low stability at high energy states, so they almost immediately go back to their original position and re-emit the energy in the form of visible light.
Different types of materials lose different amounts of energy in this process, resulting in different materials fluorescing many different colors. For example, under ultraviolet light $20 bills glow bright green while laundry detergents glow blue. 
One of the most familiar applications of fluorescence is the fluorescent light bulb. Inside a common fluorescent light bulb there is a partial vacuum and a small amount of mercury that helps provide the ultraviolet light to initiate fluorescence. The tube is coated with a fluorescent material that absorbs ultraviolet and re-emits visible light. Almost all of the energy in fluorescent lighting goes toward producing light, while the energy in an incandescent bulb goes toward light and heat, so the latter bulb is not as efficient at producing light. A fluorescent bulb can produce between three and seven times more light than an incandescent light bulb.
In many countries, legal banknotes have fluorescent symbols on them that only show under ultraviolet light. The same security features can be applied to identification cards. According to the National Park Service, ultraviolet light can be used to confirm the validity of oil paintings since natural resin varnish layers are fluorescent. People have applied fluorescence to a wide range of fields and will continue tapping its great potential to discover more ways to utilize it in the future.

Names proposed for newest elements
The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) has proposed two names for heavy elements 114 and 116, the most recent two additions to the periodic table of elements. The two proposed names are flerovium (with atomic symbol Fl) and livermorium (with atomic symbol Lv) for elements 114 and 116, respectively. The names must go through a five-month public approval period before becoming official. In the past 250 years, new elements have been added to the periodic table about once every two and a half years, according to Carnegie Mellon professor of chemistry Paul Karol, who chairs the IUPAC committee that recognizes new elements.

Texting is so easy, a lion can do it
The research company Ground Lab has developed new collars for tracking the locations of lions in Kenya. The collars can send the GPS locations of lions to a central server which processes these locations and texts local herders whenever a lion gets too close to their livestock. The collars incorporate a GPS receiver and a cellular modem capable of making calls, sending an SMS message, or even accessing a mobile data network. The process of tracking animals normally utilizes satellite linkage technology, but the company claims the cell phone route is less expensive. They have only been used on 10 lions so far, though plans to expand the program are in place.

World’s heaviest insect found
Researcher and adventurer Mark Moffet claimed last week to have discovered the heaviest known specimen of the giant weta, the largest insectsin the world, after a two-day search in the forests of Little Barrier Island, New Zealand. At 71 grams, the insect is heavier than three adult mice. Known as the wetapunga to the local Maori natives, the giant weta has been driven nearly to the brink of extinction by recently introduced rats and other mammals that feed on the insects, and can now only be spotted in the “little” islands of the country, like Little Barrier Island.

Violent video games affect brain
Researchers from Indiana University have linked extended exposure to violent video games to changes in some brain regions associated with emotional control. The study observed less activation in the frontal regions of the brain in MRI scans of young men who played violent video games over the course of one week than in other participants who did not. “The affected brain regions are important for controlling emotion and aggressive behavior,” said Yang Wang of the IU department of radiology. Similar studies of this nature have been conducted before, but this is the first time scientists have found a direct correlation between playing violent video games and emotional controlling brain function.

Mayans never said 2012 was ‘the end’
Experts on Mayan civilization are increasing their efforts to dispel the popular belief that the Mayans predicted that the end of the world would occur next year. A panel met at the archaeological site of Palenque in southern Mexico last week to emphasize that the so-called end day of Dec. 21, 2012 on the Mayan calendar is actually just the start of another long 5,125 year counting period (similar to the transition between Dec. 31 and Jan. 1 for our 365-day counting period). “We have to be clear about this. There is no prophecy for 2012,” said Erik Velasquez, a Mayan etchings expert at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. “It’s a marketing fallacy.”

Mars-bound rover to explore life
Curiosity, a car-sized rover developed by NASA, was propelled toward Mars by an unmanned rocket with a goal of analyzing the red planet. Launched just over a week ago, Curiosity is expected to touch down in August 2012, and its main mission will be to discover whether Mars currently has life or was ever capable of supporting it. The probe is equipped with 17 cameras and 10 different instruments that can analyze the Martian soil and identify elements in samples dug up by its drill-tipped arm. The rover, powered by a small nuclear generator, cost $2.5 billion to make.

Finally, after 10 months of anxiously waiting (nearly recovering from the debacle that was the Hathaway-Franco hosting gig), the 2012 Oscar season is here. Although the Academy Awards aren’t until Feb. 26 of next year, the just-as-tense pre-awards nomination race is in full swing. Following is a bit of a cross-section of this year’s best films in an effort to familiarize you with this year’s slew of Oscar hopefuls and make a few predictions and parallels. These are mostly speculated from personal movie viewings as well as in response to pre-Oscar movie festival turn-outs and movie release reviews and grosses.
There are already forerunners in a few of the major categories: Viola Davis (The Help) and Meryl Streep (for the prescreened The Iron Lady) are probably leading the Best Actress nominations; Michael Fassbender (Shame) and George Clooney (The Descendants) are in a toss-up for the Best Actor win; and Martin Scorsese (Hugo) and Steven Spielberg (for the not-yet-released but already-popularized War Horse) are among the favorites for Best Director.
The heated Best Picture race has been under the spotlight since the academy changed the nomination pool from a strict 10 films to somewhere between five and 10 films earlier this year. Listed below are films that will likely be top contenders for the award, including films that have been released and films that have yet to be released but have already been lauded by eager movie critics:
The Descendants: This dramatic comedy, a story about a father re-examining his life after the accidental death of his wife, has earned critical appraisal for its warm tone and performances. Although the film itself is likely to be nominated, most critics doubt that it will persuade the likes of academy voters and come out victorious. Acclaimed performances by Clooney and newcomer Shailene Woodley (from ABC Family’s tween sensation The Secret Life of the American Teenager) are more likely to take home the Oscars.
Hugo: This Martin Scorsese-directed magical film has already earned a wide array of critical acclaim, including the award for Best Film of 2011 by the National Board of Review. Perhaps the academy will reward this whimsical film despite its straying away from the traditional Best Picture precedent.
The Help: Based on Kathryn Stockett’s bestselling novel, this film was widely acclaimed for its performances and screenplay following its August premiere. Although many critics were inspired by its warm message of friendship and sisterhood, some criticized the movie for not taking enough risks. Given that the majority of critics thought it was fantastic, however, it still has nomination potential.
The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo: Directed by David Fincher (who also directed The Social Network), this film, set to release Dec. 21, has been heavily anticipated by critics and moviegoers for months now. Extended trailers and promotions have increased its popularity, and many are beginning to foresee an Oscar nomination for this edgy offering.
Midnight in Paris: One of the only comedies on the contenders list, this movie has garnered numerous high approval ratings for its performances and directing. It’s said to be Woody Allen’s best film in a while.
Moneyball: A long-standing hit with fans and critics after its late-September release, Moneyball, starring Brad Pitt (in what has been applauded as his best performance yet), is a true story with deep life morals. If Oscar voters understand the elevation of this movie from a normal sports classic, it has a solid chance to be among the nominees.
Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close: This movie is adapted from Jonathan Safron Foer’s renowned novel about a boy coping with his father’s death on 9/11. Although it does not arrive in theaters until Dec. 25, many critics have high hopes for the literary classic because of the book’s success and the movie’s extraordinary casting (Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock, to name just two).
The academy usually nominates films from a wide spectrum and hands the victory to either the Hollywood blockbuster or the low-budget, more independent film. The Artist, a movie centered on the Hollywood silent film era, attracted rave reviews after its late November release for its brilliant acting and evocation of the era. A larger budget film, War Horse, directed by Steven Spielberg, releases later this month and has been painted as an instant epic classic for its cinematography and plot (shown to be tried and true by its previous versions as a book and play). These two films have the highest probability to take home the golden statue based on what the academy tends to go for.
So who will win? Will it be one of these predictions or none of the above? Maybe it’s time for the Harry Potter franchise to receive academy acknowledgment for its final film or for the ambivalently-reviewed Terrence Malick film The Tree of Life to obtain a nomination, even though it seemed to baffle many critics.

A blood-lusting vampire, a rebellious son, and a bigoted father were among the characters that took the stage Friday night in the School of Drama’s production of Caryl Churchill’s Mad Forest. Set in the years surrounding the 1989 Romanian Revolution, the play explores life in Romania under the dictatorship of communist leader Nicolae Ceaucescu, the violent uprising that overthrew him, and the ensuing period of insecurity. Infused with documentary-like elements and magic realism, Mad Forest draws attention to human drama during a little-known revolution and tests boundaries between theater and film, fact and fiction.
The play follows the experiences of two families, the Vladus and the Antonescus. At the play’s opening, both families experience hardships under Ceaucescu’s regime. The Vladu family suffers public scrutiny as a result of the engagement of their daughter Lucia, played by senior drama student Ava DeLuca-Verley, to an American. Meanwhile, young Radu Antonescu (senior drama student Noah Plomgren) finds his own revolutionary sentiments growing despite his parents’ influence, as well as his infatuation with Lucia’s sister Florina (senior drama student Lilli Passero). Over the course of the play, these characters face difficulties not only leading up to the revolution, but also in its chaotic wake.
The set was minimal, with tall gray beams that evoked the cold industrialism that is typically associated with communist Eastern Europe. Despite the bareness of the set, however, the stage was brought to life by the vibrant and skilled actors. Even on opening night, the entire play ran without a visible hitch.
A lengthy series of mock television interviews was an unexpected but powerful conclusion to the first half of the play. Actors portrayed witnesses to the revolutionary violence, offering their testimonies in a televised setting. These interviews were pre-recorded and projected onto the set, rather than acted out on stage. This departure from on-stage acting blurred boundaries between theater and film; though on-stage actors occasionally supplemented the recorded interviews, there was very little live activity while the recordings played.
In addition to testing boundaries of theater and film, the interviews also crossed certain lines between fact and fiction. Though the interviewees on screen were actors, the setup evoked certain documentary-like elements, giving the audience a false sense of factuality. At the same time, however, the interviews were a powerful reminder that the events portrayed in the play, though told by fictional characters, were very violent realities to those who witnessed the revolution firsthand.
Another unexpected element of the play was the presence of vampires, angels, ghosts, and other supernatural figures. Though this magical aspect added an interesting dimension to the play, these elements seemed somewhat out of place; it was difficult to see how the supernatural dimension helped to further develop or add to the play.
Despite some eccentric elements, Mad Forest is overall a fascinating experience, offering a look into the rarely discussed Romanian Revolution through compelling characters and techniques that deviate from mainstream theater production.
Mad Forest continues through Dec. 10. Tickets, show times, and other information can be found online.

When you push open the glass doors of the Carnegie Museum of Art’s latest exhibit, Teenie Harris, Photogapher: An American Story, you’re greeted by a floor-to-ceiling portrait of Harris and lilting jazz music from the 1930s. The multi-faceted exhibit is expansive enough to encompass Harris’ rich life work.
Charles “Teenie” Harris (1908–1998) was born in Pittsburgh’s Hill District. He photographed a wide variety of subjects in his studio and in the streets of Pittsburgh, amassing over 80,000 negatives in the course of his lifetime. Ten years ago, the Carnegie Museum of Art acquired nearly all 80,000 of those negatives and has been building and researching the archive ever since.
The result is a massively impressive, interactive exhibit featuring 987 of Harris’ images on a variety of themes. An advisory committee of prominent scholars, educators, and opinion makers helped select the images.
One of the uniting and unique aspects of the gallery is the original seven-track score that plays throughout the exhibit. Composed by MCG Jazz specifically for the occasion, the music is synchronized with the slideshow presentation of the images in one part of the gallery. The music makes reference to Pittsburgh’s evolving landscape from the 1930s to the 1970s, when Harris lived and worked.
The most arresting part of the exhibit may be the floor-to-ceiling projections of the 987 images, divided by theme. The wall display smoothly rotates among images in groupings titled “Rise and Fall of Crawford Grill,” “Urban Landscapes,” “Gatherings,” “Words and Signs,” “At Home,” “Crossroads,” and “Style.” These headings give the viewer a sense of the broad scope of Harris’ work.
With ample benches provided, one can get lost in the projections, staring at the faces and scenes of Pittsburgh from decades ago. Harris was especially adept at capturing a wide variety of people, not just African Americans. The projections show former President Dwight Eisenhower; a smiling, nameless waitress; the famous African-American singer, Sarah Vaughn; and the Westinghouse High School boys’ basketball team, all in one rotation.
The projected images are without caption, but the next room contains all 987 images in chronological order. Neatly arranged along the perimeter of the room, the photographs are in a more manageable five-by-seven-inch format. The museum provides free audio guides, a cell phone tour, and a directory, which lists the caption and history of every single photograph.
Additionally, more than 20 computers are lined up in the middle of this large gallery, allowing viewers to interactively access the images, videos, and other information from the online archive. Many of the images were taken for the Pittsburgh Courier, the nationally-circulated black newsweekly of the time.
The final section of the gallery contains 12 images that Harris printed himself, some of which were selected by Carnegie Mellon’s own Linda Benedict-Jones, an adjunct history professor; Charlee Brodsky, a design professor; and Joe W. Trotter, a history professor. The images are accompanied by a brief written explanation of why the image was selected and an exploration of the composition.
Overall, the exhibition is beautifully done. With multiple entry points, via the online archive or the digital projections, there’s a chance for viewers of all ages and experience levels to access the material on more than one level. Harris’ work offers the chance to go back in time, to examine the vibrant black community of Pittsburgh through Jim Crow laws and the civil rights era.
The exhibit is on display from now until April 7, 2012. The Carnegie Museum of Art offers free admission with a Carnegie Mellon student ID.

“Grief ain’t good” is sloppily spray painted against a yellow background, a reference to the iconic black and yellow polo shirt Charlie Brown is so famously associated with. This cleverly-constructed set design and spray painted message set the tone for the play before the production of Dog Sees God: Confessions of a Teenage Blockhead began this past Saturday.
Dog Sees God was first presented by Sorrel Tomlinson in 2004 and was adapted at Carnegie Mellon by Scotch’n’Soda Theatre this past weekend by first-year international relations and politics major Raz Golden in McConomy Auditorium. The story follows some of the beloved Peanuts characters as teenagers and the complicated lives that each of them has developed.
“There are lots of shows that try to take on the life of the teenager. We all know those shows, like the ones on ABC Family,” said Golden. “This show gives a view in the transition period that teenagers experience, pointing out that it is bittersweet. I tried to stay true to the story and script.” Regarding his directing debut at Carnegie Mellon with Scotch’n’Soda, Golden said, “The process of directing was scary but worthwhile, especially as a freshman. But we are freshmen; we are not like little children. We have as much to say as anyone else on campus.”
The play serves as an enormous juxtaposition with the image that the audiences have concerning the Peanuts characters. Most of those familiar with the cartoon and comic strip think of them as adorable, innocent, and lovable third graders. However, in this play, none of them is as adorable. None of them is as innocent (or innocent at all, really). And none of them is as lovable.
The ensemble held a strong dynamic throughout the production, as the actors seemed to work very well with one another. This was especially evident in one of the most memorable scenes where the muddled CB (first-year chemical engineering major Evan Starkweather) visits Van’s Sister (sophomore mechanical engineering major Christy St. John), who has been institutionalized for setting a red-headed girl’s hair on fire.
First-year computer science major David Allen said, “I thought the play was cool. I had seen the play before so I knew what to expect. It was still great to see how this production put it together.”
After the production St. John said, “I like being able to play around with my scene partners. I would put the scene in a smaller venue, though. I want to be able to touch the audience if I wanted to.”
The publicity for this show seemed to be less widespread compared to Scotch’n’Soda’s last production, Urinetown. For example, the Facebook event for this production was created Nov. 28 — only four days before the show’s opening performance — and had a little over 260 people attending and over 1,200 invited. Urinetown’s event group was created Oct. 19 when the show premiered on Oct. 27 and had over 450 people attending and over 2,100 invited.
Dog Sees God may have not have been as well-advertised as it could have been, but a talented group of students made the production enjoyable, although the play did feature many traumatic events. Ultimately, this raised the question of whether or not all the melodramatic details were really integral to the production. The production forced the audience to consider how these characters and their distressing stories are relevant to the world we live in.

The final installment of the creative writing student reading series took place last Thursday in the Gladys Schmitt Creative Writing Center, featuring senior creative writing majors Madeleine Barnes, Samantha Frank, Yulin Kuang, Caroline Roper, and Jesse Leung.
The theme of the evening was “Ugly Sweater,” in honor of the upcoming holiday season. The venue was a little too small for the number of people in attendance, but instead of making it cramped and uncomfortable, it gave the space a cozy, coffee-house (unfortunately sans coffee) environment.
While each of the readers had a unique voice and had interesting work to read, Barnes and Kuang stole the show. Kuang, who is majoring in creative writing and minoring in film and media studies, read a personal essay she had written on going through life with an unusual name. Her essay was humorous and had a conversational feel to it; despite the fact that it was her first time reading at one of these events, she seemed very comfortable presenting her work.
Barnes, a BHA student in creative writing and art, closed the night, reading intimate poems about daily occurrences, feelings, and dreams. Her poems were deeply introspective and easy to connect with. “It’s kind of scary, but super fun,” Barnes said of reading her work for an audience.
After the five students had read, there was a raffle and an ugly sweater contest, keeping with the theme of the night. Many readers and attendees stayed around afterward, chatting and commenting on the work that was presented. There seemed to be a strong sense of community among the creative writing majors, and that sense of community made the event a success.
Most of the attendees were other English majors; some were there to support friends, others to fulfill class requirements. Creative writing professor Jim Daniels also made an appearance at the event. “It’s a funny mix, which just makes it all the more fun,” said Kyle Rood, a fifth-year senior double major in architecture and creative writing who organized the event with senior creative writing major Caroline Kessler.
Those uninvolved in the planning of the event seemed to enjoy it just as much. “This is the first student reading I’ve been to, and I really enjoyed the different voices from the different writers,” said sophomore creative writing major Amanda Yuan.
On organizing the student reading events throughout the semester, Rood said, “It’s been a lot of fun. It’s really cool to introduce our students, since they’re also our friends, and listen to them share their work.” Barnes and senior creative writing majors Ines Pujos and Ila Foley will organize and run the series next semester.

Everyone finds inspiration at different times in different places, but inside a bathroom stall may not be the first place most would expect. Many Carnegie Mellon women may have noticed “Share and Support” walls in women’s bathrooms in Hunt Library, Margaret Morrison, Baker Hall, Porter Hall, or even off campus at Kiva Han. These walls were created anonymously as a project to observe how women interact and how they support each other.
The temporary walls are made up of small folded cards or slips of paper that say “Problem:” on the front, and “Solution:” on the inside. There were also little boxes on the bottom of some of the cards where women could place an ‘X’ if they found the solutions helpful.
The project has its own Tumblr page, shareandsupportwall.tumblr.com, where photos of all the cards with the problems and solutions have been posted by date and location. The website also has a graph representing the problems and solutions that were obtained; it showed that most of the problems posted had to do with stress or love, and most of the responses either gave encouragement or suggested a course of action.
There are mixed feelings among women at Carnegie Mellon about the walls. Jessika Louissaint, a junior double majoring in biology and policy and management, said, “The content was very interesting in that people get a chance to talk about their feelings but with some privacy. However, I feel that people may not take it seriously, or may judge people.”
Junior policy and management major Jenn Brown said, “I think it’s a cute idea. I feel like some people are rude in the responses, which is kind of disappointing. If I were to write a question, I would want a real response.” Both said they hadn’t written a problem, but Brown said she has written at least one response. She even crossed off some of the negative comments that she saw.
Other women agreed that the wall was a good idea, but that there were some responses that were not very edifying. Ruthie Neely, an employee at Kiva Han, said, “The idea was cool, but I don’t know why it was only for women. I didn’t understand why it was a gendered idea.”
All of the problems appeared to be genuine, and most have received multiple suggested solutions. A few responses were either negative or disconcerting, but most were encouraging and sympathetic.

Dear Patrick,
I just got the complete series of The Wire and I really want to start watching it. But finals are coming up, and I know if I start watching I won’t stop until I finish every episode. Is there any way I can have my cake and eat it too?
Thanks,
Barely Attentive but Diligently Learning, Yet Shows Temptation. Uncertainly Deciding: Yes, I Need Guidance
Dear BADLY STUDYING,
At least you have good taste in TV shows. If this were Two and Half Men we were talking about, I’d tell you to burn it and get back to studying. But with The Wire we have a real dilemma. On the one hand, you don’t want to flunk out of school. On the other, it’s a really good show. Watching what goes on in the Baltimore war on drugs is so much more riveting than calculus. 
Now, there’s a very simple solution that may even help your studying. People tend to procrastinate because they lose a sense of the rewards for their work. Instead of doing this, use it as a reward. You can watch one episode after you’ve made a review sheet, and another after you’ve taken a practice test, but only if you scored above an 80.
**Or just have a marathon and get straight Cs,
Patrick Hoskins **
Dear Patrick,
I’ve been protesting the Wall Street industrial complex for years. But now these Occupy dudes come along and they’re all about how Wall Street is bad and banks need to go. Give me a break — they’re just doing it to pick up chicks. And now that everyone’s doing it, it’s harder for me to pick up chicks. How can I raise my street cred?
Thanks,
Picking Up Hipsters, Liberals, Environmentalists, and the Socially Engaged
Dear PUH-LEASE,
I hear you, man. It used to be that you could just complain about how Congress was bought and paid for, and everyone would think you were insightful and knew about politics. Now they just give you a dumb look. It’s become a lot harder to seem like you care without doing any actual work.
There’s a simple fix, though, that will have hippie girls crawling all over you, with just an afternoon’s work. Go to one of those Occupy protests right before the police move in, and then make sure you get maced and/or beaten. If there’s anything girls like, it’s baton-sized bruises.
Chicks dig rap sheets,
Patrick Hoskins

As the fall 2011 semester at Carnegie Mellon draws to a close, Faculty Course Evaluations (FCEs) are made available to students to evaluate courses and professors. Students’ responses will be reviewed by the university, which uses them to make decisions regarding course curricula and faculty promotion.
In an email, University Registrar John R. Papinchak explained the significance of FCEs and the importance of students’ feedback. 
“Faculty Course Evaluations  are a major source of teaching feedback to instructors,” he said. “An overwhelming majority of instructors read and seriously take to heart what students report on the evaluations. Your feedback can lead faculty to revise teaching methods, change textbooks, revise assignments and make other changes to help you learn.”
Papinchak also spoke about FCEs’ repercussions for Carnegie Mellon faculty. “Department heads and deans also review the course evaluations and use this information as one measure of teaching that contributes to decisions concerning faculty promotions.”
FCEs allow students to rate courses and professors in nine core areas, in which they assign a rating of one to five — one is the poorest rating, while five is the most superior rating. 
On the Carnegie Mellon website for Faculty Course Evaluations, there is specific information regarding the FCE process, including a “Frequently Asked Questions” (FAQ) section. Among other things, the site addresses student privacy. The site assures students that FCE results are published anonymously once students complete the survey. 
Faculty members, such as professors and advisers, also have a vested interest in the FCE process: tenure and promotion decisions are, in part, dependent upon students’ course ratings. Jared Day, adjunct professor and research associate in the department of history, voiced support for the FCE surveys, but also expressed concern about their implementation. Day said in an email, “I think they are essential benchmarking tools in modern academics and at Carnegie Mellon, especially.”
He added, however, that “students are not required to fill them out. Thus, they are often magnets for the most disgruntled students in any given class. If I were going to reform one thing about the system, I would say students should be required to fill them out in order to get their grades at the end of the semester. At least then you have a full picture.” 
According to past FCE results, the college with the highest rate of FCE return in spring 2011 was CIT, where 63 percent of possible FCEs were filled out. The college with the lowest rate of return was CFA, with 41 percent.
Joe Selinger, a junior chemical engineering major, agreed that FCEs can be misleading. “I don’t really think it’s a good measure, because professors’ quality can vary a lot. It would be good if [the evaluations] were unanimously awful, but that’s it. Professors are just hard, so they get negative reviews because of that.” Selinger said that he rarely takes FCEs seriously unless he especially likes or dislikes a professor.
He also said that he is not convinced of the usefulness of FCEs. “I think there’s a fair amount of belief that they don’t really have much value, especially with older professors who, if you give them negative feedback, still don’t really change their habits,” Selinger said.
Others cited different problems with FCEs. Danny Davis, a sophomore double majoring in linguistics and chemistry, believes that FCE surveys for new courses must be created sooner, and the results disseminated more quickly. 
He said via an online questionnaire, “I find them very useful, but I find it kind of inconvenient that the results aren’t posted for such a long time. Half my classes are either new enough or have a new enough professor so that they don’t have any evaluations at all.”

A portrait of Mahatma Gandhi alongside a commemorative plaque was installed in the Andy’s Eatery area of the University Center basement last Wednesday. A brief ceremony dedicating the portrait and plaque was held.
“An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind,” one of Gandhi’s most well-known sayings, is printed at the bottom of the portrait. Gandhi was the political and spiritual leader who helped lead a peaceful Indian revolt against British colonial rule.
Blue and yellow streamers were hung across the portrait before being cut by the president of Carnegie Mellon’s Indian spirituality organization OM, Archit Kumar, a junior double majoring in information systems and decision science. A small group gathered to watch the unveiling, while other students went about their business working or opening packages.
“After Gandhi Jayanti in October we worked with the dean of Student Affairs [and] with Marcia [Gerwig] and the University Center crew to get a picture of Mahatma Gandhi up somewhere in the University Center,” Kumar said. “[It’s] a reminder of everything that Gandhi-jhi has done.”
The portrait can be found next to the Giving Wall in between the package pickup window and the FedEx and PNC Bank branches. The space has a television as well as tables and seating. Kumar said that the area was chosen because “[it] is really for the students, this entire area.... It’s a place where students have freedom of expression ... where they have full expression of themselves.” 
As he gave a brief address to those gathered to watch the commemoration, Kumar emphasized a lesser-known Gandhi quote: “In a gentle way, you can shake the world.” 
While the portrait is not on the same scale as a hunger strike or other forms of civil disobedience, Kumar expressed hope that the picture would serve both as a reminder of Gandhi’s work and as inspiration for others to emulate.
Professor Kunal Ghosh, OM’s faculty adviser and assistant head for undergraduate affairs in the physics department, said that in addition to being proud of the permanent mark OM has left on the university, he hopes that students will take the portrait’s message to heart. “Retaliation is not the way, that’s not how to change the world,” he said.
After the ceremony, however, few students seemed to notice the portrait and no one was interested in giving a comment on the installation.  While not a controversial figure, only a small number of students had an opinion of the portrait, and even fewer had seen it.
Yet, for those involved with the Indian community on campus, the portrait has become a source of pride. “It’s a really great gesture to have Gandhi-jhi’s portrait in the University Center,” said Anisha Vyas, a junior mechanical engineering major and president of MayurSASA, “especially where everybody walks by and remind everybody of what he did in some small way.”

Carnegie Mellon’s Online Gaming Society (OGS) held a late night LAN party in the University Center on Saturday night. A dozen students gathered to play games like Starcraft, League of Legends, and Super Smash Bros. Melee; eat chips and soda; and hang out.
“It’s just kind of a way for people to meet, hang out, and make new friends,” said senior math major Mark Magsino, the president of OGS. Magsino said that, despite the name of the club, most of their events involve offline games.
Attendees of the event said that they go to OGS events to socialize, and not necessarily to play games.
“The people are really nice to talk to, which is the primary reason to go to events,” said Michael Chan, a junior biology major. “Most games that we play are for two people at most, so there’s no need to meet up.”
OGS Treasurer Kyle Magsino, a sophomore mechanical engineering major and brother of the group’s president, agreed. “For some games, like Starcraft and League of Legends, it’s a lot more fun when you have the people there who you’re playing with. Like, you can laugh when you beat them.”
In addition to playing games, attendees watched online videos, caught up with friends, and traded advice on gameplay. According to the younger Magsino, OGS also raffled off several prizes, including two gaming keyboards and a copy of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.
The elder Magsino said OGS welcomes everyone to its events. “Our club is open to everyone, even if you’re just a casual gamer. Everything’s more fun with other people around.”

Gates, Hillman buildings awarded LEED certification
The Gates Hillman Complex was awarded gold-level LEED certification last Friday. Established by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), the LEED certification awards recognize buildings that incorporate a variety of sustainable strategies under strict standards for energy use, lighting, and water and material use.
“The Gates and Hillman centers’ LEED certification demonstrates tremendous green building leadership,” said Rick Fedrizzi, president and CEO of USGBC, in a university press release. “The urgency of USGBC’s mission has challenged the industry to move faster and reach further than ever before, and the Gates and Hillman project serves as a prime example with just how much we can accomplish.”
The buildings include systems for collecting about half a million gallons of rainwater and snowmelt each year. Using this water to flush toilets, and installing low-flow lavatories and low-flush urinals, the designers and contractors were able to cut potable water usage in half.
The Gates Hillman Complex’s construction doubled the amount of green space in the area around campus. All surface parking was replaced by a 150-space underground garage. The complex also features a winter garden. Landscaping was designed by Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates of Brooklyn, N.Y., and Cambridge, Mass.
Building Virtual Worlds ’11 chooses new show venue
The annual Building Virtual Worlds Show (BVW) will move off campus for the first time this year. It will be hosted at the Carnegie Music Hall in Homestead this Wednesday.
Admission is free and the doors at the hall, located at 510 East 10th Ave. in Munhall, will open at 3:15 p.m. with pre-show activities. The show will officially begin at 4 p.m.
BVW 2011 will give students in the Building Virtual Worlds class at the university’s Entertainment Technology Center (ETC) the opportunity to showcase their latest ideas and projects in interactive digital technology. 
The student teams, consisting of both technically and artistically minded members, have created projects that use digital technology to tell stories, explore the interactive medium, and play games.
Mk Haley, associate executive producer of the ETC, is proud to be a part of the BVW show.
“BVW gives us a chance to show off the work of our talented students to an audience that will include entertainment industry executives,” she said in a Carnegie Mellon press release. “It’s always been hard to accommodate everybody who wants to see the show, but moving it to this large hall in Homestead will give the general public a great opportunity to join in the fun.”

Many of you have probably gone to a Panera Bread in Pittsburgh — and why not? It has plenty of delicious and relatively inexpensive options for food. If you pay attention to the girls waiting on you at the registers, though, you might notice some trends: first, they’re all girls between the ages of 16 and 24. Second, with rare exception, they’re all white.
Unfortunately, this isn’t some sort of odd coincidence. The Covelli franchise, which owns almost 30 Panera Bread locations in western Pennsylvania alone, only hires “pretty young girls” to work at the cash registers — or so says a recent lawsuit by Scott Donatelli, a former manager at a Panera location in Mt. Lebanon.
“First of all, when [Donatelli] hired an African-American employee, they said, ‘What is that?’ and, ‘if the owner comes around, make sure he’s in the back, because he’ll have a fit,’ ” Donatelli’s lawyer, Sam Cordes, told WTAE Pittsburgh. According to the lawsuit, the district manager repeatedly chastised Donatelli for letting an African-American man work on the registers, saying, “It’s what Sam [Covelli] wants, and what our customers want. They would rather see pretty young girls.”
This isn’t the first time the Covelli franchise has been sued for its racist practices: Back in 2003, a former manager at the Panera Bread on Forbes Avenue sued the Covelli franchise, claiming that he had been repeatedly told not to assign African-Americans to work on the cash registers, and was eventually fired for refusing to comply.
As a former Panera employee (full disclosure: I quit a few weeks ago), I can attest to how true these policies are. I’ve seen an African-American coworker — an excellent employee who has worked at Panera Bread longer than any of the managers currently running the store — sent home when Mr. Covelli was coming to visit the store. I’ve had the assistant manager tell me that she can’t hire African-Americans.
This would be bad enough if it was just one store with these policies, or one manager. But layers and layers of management have either said nothing or have actively helped to enforce these prejudicial policies. These sorts of prejudices should never have been tolerated, let alone implemented in the first place. Not only that, but the district manager’s comment that customers “would rather see pretty young girls” is insulting to Panera’s patrons. Does the Covelli franchise really think so little of its customers (or of its products) that it believes Panera Bread needs some sort of sex appeal in order to get business?
Luckily, we as the Carnegie Mellon community have a very simple way of showing that we will not tolerate this racism: Stop eating there. If you’re in Oakland and are craving a sandwich, head over to Eat Unique on Craig Street instead — it has similar kinds of food for about the same price. If you’re in Shadyside and need some comfort food, go to Boston Market. I know the Carnegie Mellon administration places plenty of catering orders at Panera Bread — start ordering your salads from somewhere else. The administration should also seriously reconsider its connections to the company; currently, Panera Bread is a corporate partner of Carnegie Mellon’s Athletic Department. Giving this kind of support to a company that continues to profess and act on racist and sexist ideals is unacceptable. Severing ties with the company would effectively send a message that we will not tolerate its practices.
We as a campus community have a very clear and easy opportunity to make a statement against these obvious racist and sexist practices. Please, take a stand and take your business elsewhere.

The student government executives, Student Senate, Graduate Student Assembly, and various associated committees that form student government have had almost five months — half of their term — to work on projects and improve the student experience at Carnegie Mellon. In this time, these student leaders have achieved some of their goals, but overall we continue to see a disappointing lack of leadership in student government.
The Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) has been the most functional body of student government again this semester. With representation organized at the department rather than the college level, GSA members have been able to keep up to date with issues their specific constituencies care about. They can — and do — effectively address issues facing the graduate student community. GSA has also continued its success at organizing popular events, including the beer-tasting event held at Phipps Conservatory last week.
Student Senate, on the other hand, has suffered from a lack of focus. Part of this is due to the fact that  members are elected at the level of entire colleges instead of close-knit departments. Senators for the Dietrich College of Humanities & Social Sciences, for example, cannot be expected to represent the interests of creative writing majors, information systems majors, and economics majors simultaneously. The goals that Senate has achieved have been lackluster and small in scope. 
For many students, especially those in student organizations, Senate’s main purpose is providing special allocations for unplanned expenses. To better connect with its constituents and represent the diverse undergraduate student body, Senate should reconsider its election procedures to be more specific than overall colleges. In doing so, we hope that it will generate more interest in its non-financial activities.
The student government executive branch is another large component of student government. It has  gone on relatively unnoticed since its members were elected last year. The executive branch is led by Student Body President Jake Flittner and Student Body Vice President Sangita Sharma; although Flittner and Sharma have been in office all semester, we have seen no accomplishments and no attempts at communication, despite several opportunities.
We have no idea what Flittner and Sharma are doing with their $10,000 budget, or what happened to the promised “Friday Frenzies” that the candidates said would be their first action upon taking office. The executive branch should be providing leadership for the rest of student government and the entire student body. Halfway through this administration’s tenure, the signs of  leadership are conspicuously absent.
The student government executive branch and Senate need to reform their leadership and make this new direction more apparent to students. The letter from Senate at the bottom right corner of this page highlights various initiatives, but they have not had enough of an effect on the student body as a whole. Greater initiatives need to be taken before smaller accomplishments are praised.
Taking measures to inform the campus community of student government initiatives would help create a greater level of communication between student government and the students they represent. By utilizing campus media, holding office hours, or just maintaining a dialogue with students, student government may truly improve the student experience at Carnegie Mellon.

We had a very busy and productive semester in Student Senate. We’ve completed several initiatives thus far and have many more projects underway. Senate has thus far allocated approximately $42,000 to 21 groups. Our funding has helped our Quidditch team go to the World Cup and has helped EMS update their equipment to better serve campus. We’ve also funded many campus events, including Bhangra in the Burgh, 12/2/11, the Asian Student Leadership Conference, and the AB Carnival Concert.
Senate Week, held in the first week of October, raised awareness of Senate, gave free food to the campus, and collected a significant amount of feedback, which we have been addressing this semester. We worked with Housing and Dining to improve lighting in upperclassmen apartments and placed magazines in the UC’s Kirr Commons for students to read. We helped implement a pilot for a new academic adviser scheduling system, which has been receiving positive feedback. We have also accomplished many small-scale changes, such as getting the water fountain in Skibo Gym repaired.
There are many ongoing projects. We are trying to expand the selection of textbooks on reserve in the library. We have a task force looking at biking issues on campus and are close to making it so first-years in all colleges can choose their Interpretation and Argument topic. We’re working to improve communication between the career center and advisers to help them work more effectively with one another and make sure our students are meeting employers’ demands.
To better communicate with campus we are launching the website cmusenate.org. This site will be catered to students and provide quick updates about our meetings and initiatives in a blog format as well as let students get to know their Senators better. The site will be launched at the start of next semester. During the winter, we are going to hand out hot chocolate and collect feedback on Fridays. Beginning next semester we will also be rolling out a new logo and distributing flyers with updates and feedback forms.
We have been working hard this semester and are in a good place to complete the initiatives that we have outlined here, along with more I didn’t have space to mention. As your representatives, we want to serve you as best as we possibly can and we appreciate your feedback. If you want more information about our initiatives or how to get involved, please email me at student-senate@andrew.cmu.edu.

Police forces moved to evict Occupy protesters in Los Angeles and Philadelphia over the last week. In both cases, these raids took place after midnight — when the possibility of public outcry and media coverage was minimal — with the police force decked out in full riot gear. Protesters, denied their fundamental right to peaceful protest, were thrown in jail by the hundreds and held for the maximum possible time without charge — 48 hours — before being released. Apparently our government only supports democracy when it involves another country’s people fighting for their rights. When it comes to flaws in the democratic process in our own country, many state and government officials have so far been content to look the other way.
To riot police and to those who command them, here’s a quick tip: If you’re conducting an operation in the dead of night and keeping journalists from covering the story, you’re doing something wrong. These forces knew that they were engaging in something dirty, secretive, and even a little unconstitutional; and yet they still went through with the plans handed down to them. Despite the fact that Occupy is a non-violent movement, these same police have been given orders to evict protesters by any means necessary. 
Rubber bullets and tear gas grenades were used to clear demonstrators in Oakland, Calif., resulting in substantial injuries to an Iraq War veteran; at the University of California at Davis, police doused protesters with military-grade pepper spray at a close range in such an ardent manner that a couple of students, one of whom was coughing up blood, had to be taken to a hospital. When our nation’s children, students, elderly women, professors, and veterans are being brutally clubbed or pepper-sprayed for their involvement in non-violent protests, something has got to stop. The police response to Occupy has never worked, and it never will.
This doesn’t even account for the cost we’re paying for mayors across the country to evict their citizens and, in many cases, our peers: According to Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa of Los Angeles, the cleanup and removal of the Occupy movement in that city cost approximately $1 million in taxpayer dollars. At a time when all of California is suffering from an enormous financial crisis, Villaraigosa chose instead to spend much-needed money on paying police officers to break down a peaceful camp long after business hours were over. 
The fiscal decision making involved here is truly mind-boggling.
As students and Americans, we must hold our government accountable for the repeated crimes it has committed against men and women who are supporting a cause they believe in. To stand by and say nothing is to support the removal of those rights. Regardless of whether or not we support the Occupy movement, we have a fundamental obligation to protect and defend our own rights from being taken away. 
With enough eyes on them, those in charge of this widespread brutality may finally begin to take notice.

With the recent failure of the Congressional “supercommittee” tasked with making progress toward solving our deficit problem, many Americans are getting frustrated with Congress’ seeming inability to do anything productive. Republicans won’t consider tax increases of any kind on any group, especially when taxes are already legislated to rise across the board in a year, and Democrats won’t consider structural reforms to entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare. As our nation approaches an important crossroads where the two warring factions have very different visions about a future America, politicians are looking more and more toward the 2012 election to see which future Americans will choose.
I believe that this divisiveness could be solved by delegating more powers to the states, so that more geographically centered majorities who are national minorities can have the power to legislate for themselves without affecting or being affected by the will of people with exceptionally different sets of values.
According to realclearpolitics.com, 73.5 percent of Americans think that the country is “headed in the wrong direction.” Congressional approval ratings are even lower, with 81.7 percent of the U.S. disapproving of Congress. 
Yet though the country seems to agree that something needs to change, polling results show that we are nearly evenly divided when it comes to how that change is to take place. Nearly 50 percent of Americans are going to vote Democratic, and 50 percent will vote Republican. Though this may change as the election draws near and the GOP’s presidential candidate becomes clearer, returning federal powers to the states will result in a satisfactory compromise for both parties.
Right now, Democrats envision a country that offers lots of benefits to its citizens but totes high, redistributive taxes. On the other hand, Republicans want low, flatter taxes, but are willing to live without the governmental benefits. Right now, we’re trying to get the best of both worlds: lower taxes with high benefits. This leaves us with lots of deficit spending, which is an unsustainable course of action. Yet these parties are fairly locally concentrated, with the North and West being largely Democratic and the South and Midwest being largely Republican. 
Instead of having the federal government force some unsatisfactory compromise on the entire electorate, by removing some of its power, we can let local majorities who are national minorities make decisions for themselves.
This also allows states to compete in the sense that they can act as a marketplace for governing ideas without detriment to the country as a whole. More and more states can adopt successful measures until they become de facto federal laws. Though not all federal powers would  be delegated to the states, the electorate would be more satisfied with our government if states had significantly more control over policy. 
Others suggest that this system would break down our government because the states and the people within them already depend on the federal government so much. I believe that if the shift were to take place gradually and incrementally, taxes could be phased out of the federal level and into the state level while services would do the same. As long as the process is gradual, people will become accustomed to the new system without much detriment.
Another counterargument is that this system would increase factions within the U.S., creating a more divisive and unproductive federal government. I disagree with this point because federal officials are already elected state-by-state. Taking power from the federal government wouldn’t change existing partisanship, but it would give a more diverse body of officials less divisive issues to worry about, and it would increase  the government’s productivity.

I was disappointed when NBC announced that Community will be going on an extended hiatus during the midseason. However, as much as I love Community, I can understand why NBC is having doubts about the show and why Community has thus far had a pretty low viewership.
Community is one of those shows that I enjoy more the second time I watch it. Episodes are too crazy for me to swallow in one viewing. It’s only when I re-watch the episode that I can appreciate all the humor and subtle character moments.
Community tends to put its funniest and most poignant scenes right in the middle of its most absurd scenarios, but these moments truly are gems when you reach them. Scenes like the anime sequence in last week’s “Foosball and Nocturnal Vigilantism” are not only hilarious but also surprisingly organic, and they show how the craziness furthers the story and character development.
I love the craziness for the sake of craziness, but I’m pretty sure that’s just me being weird. Most viewers just want humor and character moments from a sitcom, and while some craziness can add a little spice, it shouldn’t make the show too difficult to swallow in a single serving.
For the typical once-a-week sitcom viewer, episodes like “Masonic Myths and Ancient Peoples” might seem weird on the first viewing —  then next week, the show will have moved on to another crazy episode. There’s no chance for a second viewing, and the viewer might wonder whether watching Community is his most efficient use of this time slot.
Relative to Community, sitcoms like Glee or Big Bang Theory are predictable and clichéd, but that predictability has its charm. I can watch an episode of Glee and get into the music, laugh at the clever writing, and appreciate the emotional moments all in one sitting, because I’m not always worried that something crazy is going to happen.
The third season of Community is trying to tone down the absurdity while still keeping the humor and emotion. This is a step in the right direction, but the show still has a long way to go. For starters, the surreal second season has given Community a reputation for craziness that will be pretty hard to shake off. But even last week’s “Foosball and Nocturnal Vigilantism,” which held off on the wacky anime sequence until the very end, still required a second viewing for me to see how the entire episode had been building up to this sequence and then how the anime brought the episode to a satisfying and touching resolution.
Hopefully the show’s hiatus will serve as a short time out to learn how not to use parodies of Charlie Kauffman in “Masonic Myths and Ancient Peoples” to explore a character’s psyche. And hopefully, the hiatus will be just be that: a short time out.

On Nov. 9, 2011, Pennsylvania State University terminated Joe Paterno’s 46-year career as head coach of its football program for neglecting to report child molestation and sexual assault allegations against former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky to the police. While the media lauded the Board of Trustees’ decision, I believe it only served to use Paterno as a scapegoat.
Although Paterno did not report the allegations to the police directly, he did report them to the authorities of the university, as was required by his job and by the law — specifically to Tim Curley, the athletic director, and Gary Schultz, the administrator in charge of the University Police. It was then Curley, Schultz, and Graham Spanier, the president of Penn State, who proceeded to conceal the accusations. By reporting to Schultz, Paterno actually fulfilled his legal obligations and thus in no way attempted to cover up Sandusky’s crimes. He just did nothing when the Penn State administration concealed them.
Of course, Paterno’s inaction was also morally wrong, but those who readily threw him under the bus because of his lack of action hold him to an unrealistic moral standard. Consider this: Paterno has known Sandusky for 31 years and, despite that, reported him to authorities who should have notified the police, but did not. Although he should have pursued the allegations until they reached the right people, that is an exceedingly difficult thing to do — especially when the immediate responsibility no longer fell on Paterno’s shoulders.
Moreover, the scandal was the direct result of the Penn State administration putting its image and prestige over what is right. It reinforced this fact by firing Paterno over the phone after he already publicly declared he would retire at the end of the year. Attorney Ben Andreozzi summed it up nicely by saying, “the school ... elected to do what it felt was in its best interest at the time” which was “what put the school in this position in the first place.”
What makes matters worse is the fact that the media has enabled all of this to occur. The media has gotten the entire nation to focus on Joe Paterno. Not Sandusky. Not Curley, Schultz, or Spanier. Not even the victims. The media has relentlessly pursued Joe Paterno, a high-profile figure who had limited involvement. In fact, the media has vilified Paterno to such an extent that football Hall of Famer Franco Harris was fired from his publicity job simply for expressing support for Paterno. Likewise, the media’s obsessive focus on Paterno obscured the administration’s involvement in the scandal, allowing them to publicly crucify the coach.
Paterno ultimately became a victim of the same system that caused the scandal to occur in the first place — a system that values the prestige of a football program over doing what is right. Last week, a USA Today poll revealed that only 38 percent of Pennsylvanians believed that Paterno should not have been fired while 61 percent still view Penn State with a favorable opinion. In the end, it seems, the only one who did not lose in this scandal was Penn State’s administration.

Christmas is my favorite holiday; I start to feel like Buddy the Elf as soon as the tryptophan from Thanksgiving wears off. Yet upon coming back to campus after break, I noticed an inherent lack of festivity. While snow can’t be summoned on a whim (yet), there are plenty of other ways to signal the coming of the holiday season. Students and the administration should do more to celebrate this festive time of year.
The logistics of trying to establish more of a holiday atmosphere on campus may be difficult to overcome. There is the issue of trying to balance the incorporation of a variety of different backgrounds and traditions that students bring to Carnegie Mellon. One could also claim that students are too preoccupied with impending finals to worry about the absence of the holiday spirit on campus; students just want to be done with the semester so they can be festive at home. Carnegie Mellon is where we come to work and set the foundations for a successful life, but back at home is where we can relax and truly revel in the charms that the winter season brings.
However, I don’t see a deep merit behind these explanations. In an attempt to be politically correct, Carnegie Mellon shouldn’t refrain from all holiday cheer. Regardless of creed or race, it is part of human nature to hold times of celebration.
The university can do more to promote the festive spirit, even in a purely secular form. Better yet, celebrating all of the traditions that students bring to campus would best manifest the true spirit of the season. Religious or secular, the holidays on campus should further serve to establish Carnegie Mellon as the melting pot it is.
So I implore everyone to make the most of this holiday season at Carnegie Mellon in whatever way they see fit. Have a Secret Santa among your circle of friends. Get dreidel games going late into the night. Use your under-utilized printing fees and make a ton of paper snowflakes. Regardless of what you celebrate this holiday season, spend this time with people that make you happy, doing things that you enjoy. If everyone does this, you don’t have to see Christmas lights strewn from Doherty, Wean entirely covered in wrapping paper, or “Walking to the Sky” straightened and becoming an epic Festivus pole. The spirit of the season will be evident enough in the fraternity among those in the Carnegie Mellon community.
