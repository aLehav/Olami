Football
This past Saturday, Oct. 29, the #18 Carnegie Mellon football team hosted the Saint Vincent Bearcats for their homecoming game.
The Tartans took to the board early after a 30-yard field goal from graduate student Cole Hanna, making it 3-0 Tartans. Not long after the start of Saint Vincent’s next possession, an interception by sophomore Nolan Pitsenberger gave the ball back to the Tartans. This led to a 20-yard touchdown pass from junior Ben Mills to senior Kris Hughes, making it 10-0. Before the end of the first quarter, the Tartans scored another touchdown, making it 17-0.
The Bearcats finally made their way onto the board in the second quarter after a touchdown. However, the point after attempt was blocked, making the scoreline 17-6 Tartans.
With less than two minutes remaining in the second quarter, Hanna put another one through the goal posts for the Tartans, giving the Tartans a 20-6 lead at the half. Hanna would also later record the only scoring of the third quarter with a field goal almost six minutes into the half.
The Tartans weren’t ready to call it quits yet — a two-year run by first-year Joey McGinnis finished the Tartans scoring for the day with a late touchdown from the Bearcats making the final score 30-12 Carnegie Mellon after a failed two-point conversion.
Junior Adrian Williams recorded three interceptions on the day, which ties the school record for most interceptions in a single game. Hughes’ 25 touchdown receptions in his career tied him for the school record for career touchdown receptions.
With this victory, the Tartans have a 16 game winning streak — the longest in the NCAA across all divisions. Carnegie Mellon’s 20 interceptions on the season also ranks them in the top of Division III play. Their 9-0 start is the fifth time in program history that the team has started the season with nine straight wins.
The Tartans will be taking this week off and will be returning to play for their last regular season game when they travel to Case Western for the 36th Academic Bowl on Saturday, Nov. 12.
Men’s Cross Country
The men’s cross country team made their way to Hampton, Ga. this past Saturday to compete in the University Athletic Association (UAA) Championships hosted by Emory University. The Tartans placed second in the meet with 64 points, just behind Emory, who had 48 points.
Sophomore Colin McLaughlin finished first for the Tartans and sixth place overall with a time of 24:55.4. Senior Elijah Sech followed just behind with a time of 24:55.7. Both earned All-UAA First Team Recognition.
Just over 20 seconds behind was sophomore Matthew Coyle, who finished the race in 25:16.2, earning him 13th overall. For this, Coyle was awarded All-UAA Second Team Recognition. Junior Jacob Hsu took 18th place with a time of 25:23.5 and junior Alex Ivanoc finished 20th with a final time of 25:27.1.
First-year Ryan Podnar was named the UAA Men’s Rookie of the Year as the top first-year finished with a time of 25:31.3, earning him 23rd place.
Members of the men’s cross country will next compete in the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) Mid-Atlantic Regional on Saturday, Nov. 12 in Loch Haven, Pa.
Women’s Cross Country
The women’s cross country team traveled to Hampton, Ga. to compete in the UAA Cross Country Championships on Saturday, which was hosted by Emory University.
The first Tartan to finish was graduate student Kristen Seballos with a time of 22:58.4, earning her 23rd place. Senior Mona Yuan was 11 places behind her with a time of 23:23.8. Junior Megan Baker finished less than 15 seconds later in 41st place. Sophomore Alyssa Hoffman and junior Sophia Zalewski also finished in the 40s, earning 46th and 48th, respectively. The team placed sixth out of eight competing teams. 
Members of the women’s cross country team will also be heading to Loch Haven, Pa. on Saturday, Nov. 12 for the NCAA Mid-Atlantic Regional.
Men’s Soccer
The men’s soccer team took on Emory University at home on Friday, Oct. 28.
Sophomore Jack Kavan scored the game’s first goal in the 40th minute after an assist from junior William Rabon. 15 minutes later, the Eagles struck back with a goal of their own. No more goals were scored until the 80th minute of the game when sophomore Billy Boucuvalas put one in the net after a pass from senior Kiran Sarvepalli. This gave the Tartans the victory on the day, moving them to 10-3-1 for the season and 2-3 in UAA play.
Women’s Soccer
The #9 women’s soccer team played #15 Emory University at home this past Friday, Oct. 28.
The Eagles were the first on the board after a goal in the 11th minute. However, junior Cecelia Dieterich quickly fired back less than a minute later with a goal of her own, making it a tie game. It wouldn’t stay that way for long — first-year Jenna Hallbeck recorded another Tartan goal in the 14th minute after sophomore Maria Askounis passed the ball to her, giving the Tartans a 2-1 lead over the Eagles. The scoreboard wouldn’t change again until the 80th minute, when the Tartans added one more to their total thanks to a goal from sophomore Genma Jefferson. The 3-1 victory over Emory put the Tartans at 11-1-2 overall and 4-0-1 in UAA play.
Men’s Swimming and Diving
The Carnegie Mellon men’s swimming and diving team opened up their season this past week on Saturday, Oct. 29 at a home meet against Case Western Reserve University.
In the 200-yard freestyle, junior Santiago Gomez was the first to finish with a time of 1:44.28. Sophomore Christian Lanuza finished first in the 100-yard breaststroke, touching the wall in 56.98. First-year DJ Lloyd placed first both the 50-yard and 100-yard freestyles with times of 21.17 and 46.65, respectively.
Sophomore Sammy Telanoff was the first to finish in the 200-yard breaststroke with a time of 2:07.32. First-year Kevin Zhou led the times in the 100-yard butterfly, finishing in 50.99. Senior Aleksander Tarczynski was the winner of the 200-yard individual medley with a time of 1:53.05. The Tartans also had teams take first in the 200-yard medley and 200-yard freestyle relays.
Graduate student Jud Kyle earned two NCAA regional qualifying scores on the one-meter and three-meter boards, earning two victories with scores of 301.50 and 332.75, respectively. Senior Matthew Wagner also earned two NCAA regional qualifying scores, placing right behind Kyle on both the one-meter and three-meter boards with scores of 296.25 and 278.65, respectively.
The combined efforts of the Tartans earned them a 195-103 victory over Case Western. The team will next be traveling to Gettysburg College on Saturday for a 1:00 p.m. start.
Women’s Swimming and Diving
The Carnegie Mellon women’s swimming and diving team also opened their season this past Saturday when they took on Case Western Reserve University at home.
First-year Savannah Xu finished first in three separate events and set pool records in all of them. She took first in the 100-year backstroke, 200-yard backstroke, and 200-yard individual medley with times of 56.21, 2:00.73, and 2:05.13, respectively. First-year Annie Wang touched the wall first in both the 500-yard and 1,000-yard freestyle with times of 5:13.55 and 10:41.29, respectively.
First-year Mia Li took first in the 200-yard freestyle with a time of 1:56.25. First-year Audrey Lambert also picked up two victories for the Tartans in the 100-yard and 200-yard breaststroke races with times of 1:05.77 and 2:24.55, respectively. First-year Audrey Soetanto also earned a victory in the 200-yard butterfly with a time of 2:08.92. In the freestyle events, first-year Grace Malinger took first in the 50-yard by finishing in 24.29, while first-year Eliana Szabo won the 100-yard by touching the wall in 53.38. Malinger also took first in the 100-yard butterfly with a time of 59.06.
Tartan teams in the 200-yard medley and 200-yard freestyle relays also earned points for their first place finishes.
Junior Kelli Kuramoto earned herself two NCAA regional qualifying scores with victories on the one-meter and three-meter board with scores of 265.80 and 271.50, respectively.
Thanks in part to the efforts of the Tartan first-years, the team was able to best Case Western Reserve with a bottom line of 228.5-71.5. Their next competition will be next Saturday, when they will be traveling to Gettysburg College for a 1:00 p.m. start.

Group A
Italian side Napoli currently sits at the top of the Group A table. They are undefeated so far in the group stage, with 15 points to their name. On Matchday 3, the Serie A leaders put an astonishing six goals — in the 18th, 33rd, 45th, 47th, 63rd, and 81st minutes — past a lackluster Ajax in a 6-1 away victory. On Matchday 4, Napoli faced Ajax again, this time at home, and came away with another convincing victory, 4-2, scoring in the 4th, 16th, 62nd, and 89th minutes. The table-toppers continued to gain momentum through Matchday 5, putting three past and shutting out Rangers, scoring in the 11th, 16th, and 80th minutes to make the final scoreline 3-0. With a picture-perfect group stage record, Napoli have guaranteed themselves a place in the round of 16, regardless of their result against Liverpool on Matchday 6.
Just under Napoli sits English side Liverpool, who have not dropped points in the group stage save for their 4-1 loss to Napoli back on Matchday 1. Since then, however, the Reds have come back in full force. Matchday 3 saw the English side put up a solid 2-0 victory over Rangers at home, with goals coming in the 7th and 53rd minutes. Liverpool then doubled down on that victory, beating Rangers away on Matchday 4, 7-1, scoring in the 24th, 55th, 66th, 75th, 80th, 81st, and 87th minutes. Like Napoli, the Reds kept their momentum going through Matchday 5, coming out 3-0 on top of Ajax, with three near-consecutive second-half goals coming in the 42nd, 49th, and 52nd minutes. With a near-perfect group stage record, Liverpool have also guaranteed themselves a place in the round of 16, regardless of their result against Napoli on Matchday 6.
Unfortunately for Ajax, their Champions League group stage has gone less than ideal. Having just three points to their name, courtesy of a 4-0 victory over Rangers back on Matchday 1, it has been loss upon loss for the Dutch side — first falling to Napoli at home 6-1 on Matchday 3, then to Napoli again on the road 4-2 on Matchday 4, and finally losing to Liverpool 3-0 on Matchday 5. Unsurprisingly, Ajax is completely out of the European top flight at this point. The silver lining, however, is that unless the Dutch side loses by a five-goal margin to Rangers on Matchday 6, they will at least move on to play in the Europa league.
Rangers sit at rock bottom of the Group A table, without a single point to their name. The Scottish side have been consistently outclassed in their group stage matches, and the last three matchdays have gone no differently than the first two — the Rangers lost 2-0 to Liverpool on Matchday 3 away, then 7-1 to Liverpool on Matchday 4 at home, then 3-0 to Napoli on Matchday 5. It comes as no surprise that the Scottish side have had any hope of continuing to play in this year’s Champions League completely dashed and, unless they are able to pull off a miraculous win against Ajax with a five-goal difference on Matchday 6, Rangers will be out of Europe completely by Nov. 1.
Group B
Group B features, arguably, the most unexpected ranking among the groups. Topping the table is Belgian side Club Brugge who, with 10 points, have guaranteed their spot in the knockout stage for the first time in club history. With a 2-0 win at home against Atlético Madrid on Matchday 3, with goals coming in the 36th and 62nd minutes, followed by a 0-0 draw away upon their next meeting on Matchday 4, the Belgian side ensured their presence in the round of 16. Despite dropping points in a 4-0 loss to Porto on Matchday 5 (and an ironic one, at that, considering Porto fell to Club Brugge by the same scoreline back on Matchday 2), Club Brugge have already made history, and will continue their run in the European top flight regardless of their result against Leverkusen.
Just under Club Brugge sits Portuguese side Porto, with nine points to their name. Despite a rocky start to the group stage, losing 2-1 to Atlético Madrid on Matchday 1 then losing 4-0 to Club Brugge on Matchday 2, Porto have rallied nicely, winning on each of the ensuing matchdays to claw their way up from the bottom of the table to second place. Porto initiated their comeback with a 2-0 win against Leverkusen on Matchday 3, in which the Portuguese side scored in the 69th and 86th minutes. On Matchday 4, Porto doubled down, beating Leverkusen again on the road, 3-0, with goals coming in the 6th, 53rd, and 64th minutes. On Matchday 5, a formidable 4-0 victory against Club Brugge — an ironic revenge, perhaps, for their Matchday 2 loss — saw the Portuguese visitors score in the 33rd, 57th, 60th, and 70th minutes to put themselves within a single point of the table-toppers. Although the final standings for Group B are still up in the air, Porto have guaranteed a spot in the round of 16 regardless of their result against Atlético Madrid on Matchday 6.
Atlético Madrid sits in a precarious third position, holding themselves above the bottom of the table by a single point. Despite their Champions League campaign starting smoothly, with a 2-1 win against Porto on Matchday 1, it’s been all downhill from there for the Spanish side. Two losses on Matchdays 2 and 3 to Leverkusen (2-0) and Club Brugge (2-0), followed by two draws to Club Brugge (0-0) and Leverkusen (2-2) on Matchdays 4 and 5, respectively, means that Atlético Madrid have dropped points every matchday since the first. With a total of five points, the Spanish side will have to fight tooth and nail just to stay in Europe. Should Leverkusen outperform Atlético Madrid on Matchday 6, Atleti will find themselves out of Europe until next year.
At the bottom of the Group B table sits Leverkusen, with a total of four points to their name. Their Champions League campaign has been rocky to say the least. Despite one win and one loss in the first two matchdays, the German side has not been able to win since, fielding 2-0 loss to Porto away on Matchday 3, then another loss — this time 3-0 at home — to Porto on Matchday 4, before dropping points in a 2-2 tie with Atlético Madrid on Matchday 5. Like Atlético Madrid, there is no way for Leverkusen to qualify for the knockout stage of this year’s Champions League. However, if Atlético Madrid end up dropping points on Matchday 6 against Porto — a likely scenario — Leverkusen still has a shot at qualifying for the Europa League if they put up a win or a draw (the latter only being enough should Atleti lose).
Group C
The only other club aside from Napoli to maintain a perfect group stage score thus far, Bayern Munich currently sit comfortably at the top of the Group C table with 15 points. For the German side, the last three matchdays have been smooth sailing. Having recorded solid victories against Inter Milan and Barcelona on Matchdays 1 and 2, respectively, Bayern continued their momentum, routing Viktoria Plzen in a 5-0 showing at home on Matchday 3, scoring in the 7th, 13th, 21st, 50th, and 59th minutes. Matchday 4 saw the German side facing Viktoria Plzen again — this time on the road — and despite a late effort from the Czech side, the four first-half goals scored in the 10th, 14th, 25th, and 35th minutes were enough to see Bayern through to a 4-2 victory. Bayern then traveled to face Barcelona on Matchday 5 and, in a 3-0 shutout that saw the German side score in the 10th and 31st minutes, as well as the first minute of stoppage time, effectively knocked the hosts out of the European top flight. With a perfect Champions League group stage record, Bayern have guaranteed themselves a spot in the round of 16, regardless of their result against Inter Milan.
Inter Milan sits below Bayern, having garnered 10 total points across the duration of the group stage. Since losing to Bayern on Matchday 1, Inter Milan have done well and have not recorded another loss since then. On Matchday 3, Inter took the lead from Barça after a goal two minutes into the first half’s stoppage time put them ahead. They played well the rest of the match, shutting out Barça to take home all three points and a scoreline of 1-0. On Matchday 4, they faced Barça again, away, and held them two a 3-3 draw. Then, on Matchday 5, Inter bettered their total score by beating Viktoria Plzen 4-0, scoring in the 35th, 42nd, 66th, and 87th minutes, taking home all three points. Inter Milan is in a rather ironic situation, in that with 10 points to their name, they are 5 points away from both the team preceding and succeeding them, means that regardless of the result of their head-to-head with Bayern on Matchday 6, they will remain in second place and qualify for the knockout stage.
In the most unexpected turn of events, Barcelona sits third in the Group C table with four points altogether. Despite starting out the group stage strong and putting up a formidable 5-1 performance against Viktoria Plzen on Matchday 1, it’s been nothing but disappointment for Barça since. After losing 2-0 to Bayern on Matchday 2, Barça proceeded to lose 1-0 to Inter on the road on Matchday 3, before holding the Italian side to a 3-3 draw on Matchday 4. Barça then faced Bayern at home, where they lost 3-0, taking themselves out of knockout contention. The silver lining is that with four points, Barça is at least guaranteed Europa League qualification.
Speaking of being knocked out of Europe in the group stage, there can be little said or done by Viktoria Plzen regarding their performances. Having lost every single one of their matches, most recently experiencing a 5-0 thrashing by Bayern on Matchday 3, then again against Bayern on Matchday 4 in a game that ended 4-2, before losing 4-0 to Inter Milan on Matchday 5. With this completely lackluster performance, Viktoria Plzen will be homebound after the group stage, ousted from Europe.
Group D
Group D has the most contentious ranking among all of the groups, with just me with two points separating first and last place in the table. For now, Tottenham sits at the top of the table, with eight points. After a win on Matchday 1 and a loss on Matchday 2, Tottenham’s group stage record has continued to be spotty. A 0-0 tie on Matchday 3 forced the Spurs to share the points, but a 3-2 victory against Eintracht Frankfurt on Matchday 4 put the Spurs back. On Matchday 5, Tottenham was forced to share the points again putting up a 1-1 tie with a late 80th minute goal keeping the Tartan from dropping all three points. Despite their position now, it is completely possible that Tottenham will lose on Matchday 6 while other teams outperform them to take the qualification spots. To keep their position, Tottenham must beat Marseille on Matchday 6.
Likewise, Sporting, sitting second in the Group D table, has both the chance to climb to the top spot and risk not qualifying for either the Champions League or the Europa League, period. Sporting’s Champions League campaign began phenomenally, with victories on both Matchday 1 and Matchday 2, but they have been winless since. Sporting lost to Marseille twice, once in a 4-1 away head-to-head on Matchday 3, and once in a 2-0 bout at home. However, Sporting has broken their losing streak by putting up a 1-1 draw against Tottenham. Like the other Group D, Sporting will need to fight hard if they want to stay in not only the European top flight, but Europe in general. To qualify for the Champions League round of 16, Sporting will have to win their match against Eintracht Frankfurt on Nov. 1.
Eintracht Frankfurt’s record has been spotty at best, but they currently sit third in the table. After a loss on Matchday 1 and a victory on Matchday 2, Frankfurt proceeded to tie with Tottenham at home 0-0 on Matchday 3, before losing to the Spurs 3-2 away on Matchday 4. However, Frankfurt was undeterred, and put up a 2-1 win against Marseille on Matchday 5. To qualify for the Champions League round of 16, Frankfurt will have to win their match against Sporting on Nov. 1.
Although Marseille’s Champions League campaign started less than ideal, with two losses on Matchdays 1 and 2, the French side returned in force to beat Sporting twice — 4-1 at home on Matchday 3 and 2-0 on the road on Matchday 4. However, with Marseille’s 2-1 loss against Frankfurt on Matchday 5, the French side sits at the bottom of the Group D table with six points. However, all is not lost, and if Marseille beats Tottenham on Matchday 6, they will have a shot at the round of 16.
Group E
Group E has, possibly, the least unexpected ranking. Chelsea started out rocky, losing on Matchday 1 and tying on Matchday 2, but has won all three of their matches since — beginning with a 3-0 win against AC Milan at home on Matchday 3, with goals being scored in the 24th, 56th, and 62nd minutes, then doubling down against Milan on Matchday 4 away, scoring in the 21st and 34th minutes to win 2-0. The English side kept their winning streak up through Matchday 5, overcoming Salzburg 2-1 by scoring in the 23rd and 64th minutes. This recent success sees Chelsea topping the Group E table with 10 points, guaranteed a spot in the round of 16.
AC Milan sits under Chelsea with 7 points. Their two losses to Chelsea on Matchdays 3 and 4 — falling 3-0 on the road and 2-0 at home — saw the Italian side slide down the table, but a solid 4-0 win against Dinamo Zagreb on Matchday 5, with goals scored (quite curiously) in the 39th, 49th, 59th, and 69th minutes, saw AC Milan climb back to second in Group E. However, their qualification spot is far from being safe, and Milan will have to win or tie against Salzburg on Matchday 6 to make it to the round of 16.
Despite only having one win to their name, Salzburg is not in a terrible position. Having tied on Matchdays 1 and 2 before winning against Dinamo Zagreb away on Matchday 3 1-0 thanks to a penalty scored in the 71st minute, Salzburg’s Matchday 4 ties against Zagreb at home and subsequent 2-1 loss to Chelsea means that they have six points total, just one shy of AC Milan. There is still a chance for Salzburg to make it to the knockout stage if they manage to beat Milan on Matchday 6, but either a tie or a Zagreb loss would see Salzburg staying in Europe to play in the Europa League.
Dinamo Zagreb started their Champions League group stage well, winning their first game, but it has been all downhill from there. Losses on Matchdays 2 and 3 against Milan and Salzburg away saw the Croatian side slide down the table, but a tie against Salzburg at home on Matchday 4 secured another point for Zagreb. A 4-0 loss to AC Milan on Matchday 5 means that Zagreb now sits at the bottom of the Group E table with 4 points, but if Zagreb manages to beat Chelsea and AC Milan beats Salzburg, the Croatian side will be the one to qualify for the Europa League in Salzburg’s stead.
Group F
Group F’s standings are also rather unsurprising. Having won on Matchdays 1 and 2, Real Madrid brought that momentum into Matchday 3, overcoming Shakhtar Donetsk at home 2-1 by scoring in the 13th and 28th minutes. However, their next head-to-head did not go so smoothly for Real, and the Spanish side was forced to a 1-1 draw against their Ukrainian hosts. This, followed by a surprise 3-2 loss to Leipzig on Matchday 5, means that although they are still topping Group F, Real Madrid only has 10 points. While 10 points is not enough to guarantee Real winning the group, it is enough to guarantee them a place in the round of 16, regardless of the result of their match against Celtic on Matchday 6.
Having lost on both Matchdays 1 and 2, Leipzig was at the bottom of the Group F table. However, with a series of wins, the German side now sits in second, just under Real Madrid. Leipzig turned it around on Matchday 3 with a 3-1 win against Celtic at home, scoring in the 27th, 62th, and 77th minutes. This was followed up by a 2-0 win against Celtic away, with goals coming in the 75th and 84th minutes. Leipzig then pulled off a surprise upset against Real Madrid on Matchday 5, winning 3-2 with goals scored in the 13th, 18th, and 81st minutes. With nine points to their name, the German side are now poised to qualify for the round of 16, as long as they do not lose to Shakhtar Donetsk on Matchday 6.
Shakhtar Donetsk’s luck has run similarly to group leaders Real Madrid. Despite winning their first group stage match, Shakhtar has not won since. With their 2-1 loss against Real away on Matchday 3, their 1-1 draw against Real at home on Matchday 4, and yet another 1-1 with Celtic on Matchday 5, Shakhtar Donetsk has slipped to third in the table, with a total of 6 points. Shakhtar Donetsk is guaranteed to continue their European campaign, likely in the Europa League, but if they actually manage to beat Leipzig on Matchday 6, the Ukrainian side will move on to the knockout stage of the Champions League.
Unluckily for Celtic, their Champions League run has been completely lackluster. Without a single win to their name, the Scottish side sits rock bottom in the Group F table with 2 points to their name. Having lost to Leipzig on both Matchday 3 away and Matchday 4 at home before tying with Celtic on Matchday 5, Celtic’s prospects are bleak. Regardless of their result against Real Madrid on Matchday 6, Celtic’s European campaign will end.
Group G
Also rather unsurprisingly, Manchester City tops the Group G table with 11 points. While their performance has not been perfect, the English side has not lost in the group stage thus far. Their victories on Matchdays 1 and 2 were followed up by another huge 5-0 win on Matchday 3 against Copenhagen at home, with goals being scored in the 7th, 32nd, 39th, 55th, and 76th minutes. Their subsequent matches have gone less ideal, however, with City tying with Copenhagen 0-0 away, then tying with Dortmund 0-0. Still, City is guaranteed to appear in the round of 16 regardless of their result against Sevilla on Matchday 6.
Dortmund sits just under Man City in Group G. Like City, the German side has won on Matchday 3 against Sevilla 4-1 away, with goals scored in the 6th, 41st, 43rd, and 75th minutes, but has not won since, tying with Sevilla at home 1-1 on Matchday 4, before tying with City 0-0 on Matchday 5. Still, the eight points which Dortmund has garnered will be enough to see them through to the round of 16, regardless of their result against Copenhagen on Matchday 6.
Sevilla is third in the Group G table with five points to their name. Having struggled on Matchdays 1 and 2, Sevilla continued to struggle, losing to Dortmund at home 4-1 on Matchday 3 and tying with Dortmund away 1-1 on Matchday 4. They won their first group stage game on Matchday 5, putting up a score of 3-0 against Copenhagen, but it is all too little, too late for the Spanish side, who will not be advancing to the knockout stage, but will still continue their European campaign in the Europa League.
Like Celtic in Group F, Copenhagen has been unable to hold their own against the other teams in their group. Losing on Matchday 1 and drawing on Matchday 2, Copenhagen continued the pattern, losing on Matchday 3 to City 5-0, tying on Matchday 4 with City 0-0, and losing on Matchday 5 to Sevilla 3-0. Regardless of their result on Matchday 6, Copenhagen are out of Europe.
Group H
Ironically enough, the leaders of Group H, PSG and Benfica, are equal in points, wins, and draws, with the last two being equal even in the order that they occurred in. Both teams fielded wins on Matchdays 1 and 2, before facing each other and tying on Matchdays 3 and 4. Matchday 3 saw Benfica host PSG and the teams tie 1-1, while Matchday 4 saw PSG host Benfica and the teams tie 1-1 yet again. Both teams then went on to win their Matchday 5 head-to-heads. PSG beat Maccabi Haifa 7-2, with goals scored in the 19th, 32nd, 35th, 44th, 64th, 67th, and 84th minutes; and Benfica overcame Juventus 4-3, scoring in the 17th, 28th, 35th, and 50th minutes. PSG currently tops the table on goal difference, but both PSG and Benfica, with 11 points, will make it through to the knockout stage regardless of their results against Juventus and Maccabi Haifa, respectively, on Matchday 6.
Juventus and Maccabi Haifa are also equal in points, having three each, and equal in wins and losses. Neither team won either of their Matchday 1 or 2 head-to-heads and, when they faced each other, Juventus beat Maccabi Haifa 3-1 at home, scoring in the 35th, 50th, and 83rd minutes, and Maccabi Haifa subsequently beat Juventus 2-0 at home, scoring in the 7th and 42nd minutes. As it stands, neither team will be continuing onwards to the knockout stage, but Juventus is poised to continue playing in the Europa League. However, if Maccabi Haifa puts on a better performance than Juventus on Matchday 6, they will be able to position themselves in the Europa League qualifying spot and bump Juventus out of Europe.

Buggy is a Carnegie Mellon tradition which has existed since 1920. The sport, which is practiced throughout the academic year, culminates in an annual series of relay races held on each year’s Raceday during Spring Carnival, in which teams vie for the title of “Champion.” The Buggy Rolls Report column reports on the buggies and roll counts for all of the teams which attend the freeroll practices (“rolls”) each weekend organized by the Carnegie Mellon Sweepstakes Committee. All of the information reported in the column is provided by the Carnegie Mellon Sweepstakes Committee.
After two whole weekends without rolls, buggy was back in (almost) full-force last weekend. The weather remained clear for both Saturday and Sunday morning, but due to quorum not being reached, there rolls were only held on Saturday.
In total, seven teams rolled on Saturday, Oct. 29. In roll order, they were: SigNu (Sigma Nu), CIA (The Carnegie Involvement Association), SAE (Sigma Alpha Epsilon), Apex, SigEp (Sigma Phi Epsilon), SDC (The Carnegie Mellon Student Dormitory Council), and SPIRIT.
SigNu rolled one buggy, Jager, which got three rolls in.
CIA rolled three buggies: Roadrunner, Tempest, and Kingfisher. Each buggy got three rolls in, with Roadrunner and Kingfisher’s roll counts being split between two drivers.
SAE rolled one buggy, Eileen, which got two rolls in.
Apex rolled three buggies: Phoenix, Firefly, and Solaris. Each buggy got three rolls in.
SigEp rolled two buggies: Kraken and Barracuda. Kraken got three rolls in, while Barracuda got one roll in.
SDC rolled two buggies: Avarice and Inferno. Each buggy got two rolls in.
SPIRIT rolled two buggies: Kingpin II and Mapambazuko. Each buggy got two rolls in.
There were no rolls held on Sunday, Oct. 30, due to quorum not being reached.

Anyone who’s taken high school chemistry might remember the concept of LD50 when it comes to measuring toxicity – the concept that for any substance, there is a specific dose that would kill half of test animals. While this concept is usually used in terms of toxic substances with fairly low LD50 numbers, meaning even a small amount can kill you, using this analysis can tell us exactly how much of a “good thing” we would need to consume before it kills us. 
Water
Hazing culture and reports of people dying from chugging beverages as a part of dares makes the fact that drinking too much water can kill you a bit less surprising than some of the other things on this list. Indeed, Erin Baldwin of Business Insider explains research done into the LD50 of water, which found that only six liters of water is enough to kill 50 percent of people. 
The reason? Hyponatremia, or water intoxication, which is an excess of water in and around our cells that causes them to puff up like balloons. Water intoxication in mild cases leads to nausea and vomiting, often seen in athletes, but in its most potent form can lead to neurological damage like confusion, seizures, and yes… death. 
Indeed, the news source Mirror reports that research has found that at least 14 people have died from drinking too much water while doing sports. That count doesn’t even acknowledge the countless examples of people dying from “challenges” to drink a certain amount of liquid, or deaths that happen in a less public setting.
Coffee
While college students do end up in a love-hate relationship with coffee and other types of caffeine, going back and forth between the desire to get a caffeine boost to survive classes and the knowledge that caffeine isn’t good for your health, very rarely do we consider that too much caffeine can literally kill you.
Luckily, that’s a little hard to do. Baldwin explains that research has found that it would take 120 cups of coffee to reach the LD50 point where half of people die, mainly due to the caffeine. When in high concentrations, caffeine can cause a whole host of problems including insomnia, dizziness, vomiting, headaches, and heart problems.
The risk of death comes less from the coffee form of caffeine and more from its pure powder form, which people have a tendency to overdose with when making their own caffeinated drinks, or when taking caffeine tablets as a dietary supplement. Katherine Marengo of Medical News Today explains that the risk often comes when people combine the supplements with traditionally caffeinated beverages, and that a mere teaspoon of caffeine powder can be equivalent to 28 cups of coffee. Seems like that 120 threshold is much closer now, doesn’t it?
For that reason, Marengo cites a 2018 study that has identified 92 reported deaths from caffeine overdose. 
Apples
Perhaps a bit of a random addition, but the reason for apples’ deadly nature was spooky enough it had to be included for this week’s Halloween issue. 
The threshold for death by apple is simultaneously low and high depending on your ability to sit and chew for extended periods of time. Baldwin explains that for half of people to die of apple consumption, you’d have to eat around 22 whole apples in one sitting. 
However, there’s no need to worry about death by apple for most people, because you have to eat the entire apple to be impacted. Baldwin explains that the risk of apple consumption comes from their seeds, which contain trace amounts of a sugar-cyanide compound that turns into the toxin cyanide while being processed in the body. Using the metrics of death by cyanide, which is roughly 1.5 milligrams of cyanide per kilogram of body weight, you’d have to chew and eat half a cup of apple seeds, or, you guessed it, around 22 apples. 
Despite that lovely explanation of how apples can kill you, the only example of a person actually dying from apple consumption wasn’t in fact from sitting and eating 22 apples in one sitting. He died instead from the wax from apple peels being stored in strange manners in crystals across his pulmonary immune cells, lymph nodes, and other parts of the body. 
Halloween Candy
Ending things in a more spirited fashion, the last thing (in this article) that will kill you if taken in overabundance is Halloween candy. Ilana Keller of USA Today examines past studies that look at the LD50 value for sugar, and then translates that into its Halloween candy equivalent. Their findings? That you would need to eat roughly 13.5 grams of sugar for every pound you weigh, and eat it all in one sitting.
Thus, an average 180-pound American would need to eat 5.4 pounds of sugar to have a 50/50 shot of a lethal overdose, putting us at a whopping 262 pieces of “Fun Size” candy bars or 1,627 pieces of candy corn (which is around 20,000 calories) to hit the sugar minimum for LD50. 
It’s unlikely that a person will sit and eat enough Halloween candy to kill them. But sugar is killing people in other ways, with Laura Donovan of Salon reporting that sugary drinks alone have been linked to 184,000 deaths each year worldwide, due to the linkage of sugary drinks to conditions like type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.

Elon Musk closes deal to buy Twitter for $44 billion
This past Thursday, Oct. 26, Elon Musk closed the deal to buy Twitter for $44 billion. This deal follows an agreement from April 25 for Musk to purchase Twitter; Musk’s purchase will make Twitter a private company once again. Musk tweeted a video of him walking into Twitter headquarters carrying a sink with the caption, “Entering Twitter HQ – let that sink in!” on the day before the deal was completed, Oct. 26.
On Oct. 27, Musk tweeted a message to Twitter advertisers explaining his motivation for purchasing Twitter. “The reason I acquired Twitter is because it is important to the future of civilization to have a common digital town square, where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner, without resorting to violence,” Musk wrote. He also discussed his discontentment from polarized extremes. A Tweet later that day from Musk read “the bird is freed.”
The following day, Musk announced that a “content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints" will be formed at Twitter. According to Musk, no major content decisions or account reinstatements will happen before that council convenes. Previously, Musk stated that he wanted to reverse former President Donald Trump’s Twitter ban. Musk later clarified that day that no changes have been made to Twitter’s content moderation policies.
As part of Musk’s takeover, layoffs have occurred, and are expected to continue. According to Ross Gerber, the chief executive of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, he was told by the head of Musk’s family office that he should expect somewhere around 50 percent of Twitter’s employees to be laid off. 
Musk also terminated a number of Twitter executives “for cause,” which implies that Musk alleges that he had justification for terminating their positions. This includes former chief executive Parag Agrawal, former chief financial officer Ned Segal, former general counsel Sean Edgett, and former top policy and legal executive Vijaya Gadde. 
Musk’s Twitter bio now reads “Chief Twit” and his location is set to “Twitter HQ.”
Kanye West plans to acquire Parler
Parler, a social media company that is self-described as being “built upon a foundation of respect for privacy and personal data, free speech, free markets, and ethical, transparent corporate policy” is set to be bought by Kanye West (who now goes by Ye), who has recently been under fire for making antisemitic comments.
Parlement Technologies, the parent company of Parler, made the announcement that an agreement in principle to sell Parler to Ye has been made. According to Parler’s press release, “Under the terms of their agreement in principle, the parties intend to enter into a definitive purchase agreement and expect to close during the fourth quarter of 2022. The terms of the proposed transaction would include ongoing technical support from Parlement and the use of private cloud services via Parlement’s private cloud and data center infrastructure.” The cost of the agreement has not yet been revealed. 
According to Ye, “In a world where conservative opinions are considered to be controversial we have to make sure we have the right to freely express ourselves.” Parler has previously received criticism for its practices and was offline for a month in early 2021 when Amazon cut cloud support to the network. West was recently locked out of Twitter and Instagram following a series of antisemitic posts on both platforms.
Meta’s valuation sinks by $700 billion
This past Thursday, Meta stock prices sank 24 percent to their lowest level in nearly four years following their earning reports. While the entire tech industry is struggling, Meta’s decline has outpaced the rest of the tech sector, with its shares being down 67 percent year-to-date, compared to the 31 percent of tech-heavy Nasdaq index. 
Last October, Facebook changed its name to Meta Platforms to signal its focus on the “metaverse.” A year later, the company has seen $9.4 billion in losses because of the metaverse. While Chief Executive Officer of Meta Mark Zuckerberg is “pretty confident this is going in a good direction,” investors don’t feel the same way. Horizon Worlds, which is Meta’s new virtual space, changed its monthly active users goal from 500,000 to 280,000. However, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal, the platform attracts less than 200,000 active monthly users. 
Facebook is also seeing slower growth compared to previous years. While Facebook saw a three percent increase in users compared to this time last year, it is small compared to previous platform growth. This comes after Facebook reported it had lost users for the first time in history in February. 
Meta has also been experiencing a drop in advertising revenue; the company saw a 3.7 percent decrease in advertising revenue this last quarter. The primary advertising platforms owned by Meta include Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. This comes from the recent economic slowdown — this means advertisers are cutting spending — and Apple’s recent privacy changes that allows consumers to ask apps not to track them. Facebook has said that this will cost it $10 billion in revenue this year.

It’s been a really, really messed up week. Seven days of torture, seven days of dedication to producing the same quality content you know and trust from our fine publication. Seven days of giving our all to learning everything we could about Lenny Bruce — you’ll notice a plethora of work this week about him and Ronnie Marmo’s play about him, “I’m Not a Comedian… I’m Lenny Bruce!” You can find esteemed theater writer Pria Dahiya’s interview of Ronnie Marmo on pages 8 through 13, with a review of the play by review junkie and Pillbox editor Anna Cappella on page 6.
You might notice an imbalance of content from Anna, who decided to use her fall break to pump out three pieces. In addition to the review of Marmo’s play, you can find Anna’s take on the new Taylor Swift album, Midnights, on page 4 and the newest edition of her serial “Love, Maggie” on page 16. 
There’s another album review by junior staffwriter Gursimran Singh on page 18 - this one covers Lil Baby’s new album, "It’s Only Me." 
Finally, you’ll find an interview of bass baritone and resident artist at the Pittsburgh Opera by junior staffwriter Alison Zheng on page 14.
And as present as ever, our weekly playlist is on page 19.
We are, as always, dedicated to the art and science of writing about theater and music. And we are, as always, dedicated to you, our readers.

Taylor, I’m tired. Just freaking exhausted. I can barely keep up with my own deep-rooted dramatic ramblings, my own creative ideations. To keep up with yours is starting to become somewhat of a burden, and even though I was excited for the release of your new album, Midnights, I was also a little stressed out by it.
Maybe it’s because I listened to the album for the first time at eight in the morning instead of at midnight like was intended. Maybe it’s because I was honestly hoping Swift would finish up her “Taylor’s Version” project before moving on to new material. Maybe I’m just only writing negative reviews this semester.
In the interest of full disclosure, I didn’t like this album when I listened to it the first time. While I could hear the lavender color coming through in Swift’s instrumental choices, I felt like so much of it was melodically uninteresting, or at least too similar to the random indie songs that serve as my playlist filler. I thought to myself, “Sure, I could listen to this album several hundreds of times until the melodies become something I can hold in my hand,” but at this point in her career, I think Swift can be held responsible for making music that pulls you in on its first play.
I was right that it got better the second time around, though. I will not concede the point that some the melodies are uninteresting, and the more I listened, the closer they sounded to old Swift songs or other popular pieces (“You’re on Your Own, Kid” and “Castle on the Hill”, “Lavender Haze” and “False God”, “High Infidelity” and “ivy”). But, because I am as deep and interesting and complicated as Swift herself, I can say that I really like "Midnights" now, even though I really did not initially.
What sold this album to me was the lyricism, which incidentally is also what sets the album apart from Swift's previous works. She says weird and cringey things, like “sexy baby” or “cat eye sharp enough to kill a man.” She talks about how much she hates herself and also how pretty she is and how she thinks everyone is out to get her, in a way that is less honest than it is blatant. You listen to “Bejeweled” and it just hits you in the face. “I polish up real nice.” It’s all sort of predictable — like the way that you see “Vigilante Shit” and “Karma” and you know it's going to sound like all of Reputation (and it totally does). 
I want to take a moment to talk about personal symbologies. They are my favorite thing in this entire world; I like them even more than banana yogurt or 16-minute-long songs. And Taylor Swift has created a library of personal symbology like no other artist has ever done as successfully. She kind of has to — it would be absurd for an artist to have such a large collection of work with no interconnection. It’s one of the reasons I like her as much as I do. I want people to read the things I write and think, “Oh that’s interesting, I remember when she referenced that person or thing or idea 4 years ago in that one bonus track — it’s all connected.”
That’s great. However, it is not an excuse for bad music. This does not apply to the entire album by any means, but I do think Swift relied a little too heavily on her fans’ anticipation of her next “Taylor’s Version” album and references to past music and stories this time around. It’s just really easy, because we all know the stories now. All of the secrets have been told. Swift knows that all the Gen-Z/Millennials — whose brains are used to consuming massive amounts of media and connecting storyline dots that are sometimes miles apart — will eat her storylines up (I am no exception to this, I just generally prioritize sound over lore.) Her creative vision and process are on more evident display than ever before in Midnights to cater to this fan expectation. 
They are so on display that I kind of squint one of my eyes and purse my lips. The 3 a.m. version Swift released three hours after the original album with seven whole extra songs … Taylor, that's not creative process. That’s just showing off. At the very least, she could have waited a week, let us all appreciate the symbolically quantized 13 songs for a little while. Especially considering that most people are streaming Midnights prior to purchasing a hard copy, there is literally no point. Publishing creative process means that there is just even more creative process we’re not seeing. It no longer feels authentic; it feels questionable.
Conceptually, I really liked the idea of "Midnights": songs written in the dead of night, while you’re lying awake thinking about everything that’s ever happened to you. It's raw and real and very very lore. The ideas and the images are all there, and there are even some tracks (“Labyrinth,” “High Infidelity,” “Dear Reader”) that are just plain good. There are some lyrical gems (“No one sees when you lose when you’re playing solitaire,” “Did you hear my covert narcissism I might disguise as altruism like some kind of congressman,” “I’ll be getting over you my whole life”). What remains falls a little flat though, especially when compared to Swift’s better/best work. We’re not going to talk about “Snow on the Beach.”
I can appreciate it for what it is though, and Swift for the true artist she has become. Merging a flourishing creative persona into a career which previously catered primarily to popular interest can’t be easy, and maybe Midnights is evidence of that. Maybe I just don’t get it, and that’s okay. I have always posited that Swift is so popular with our age group because she has essentially grown up alongside us and subsequently writes about things that are generally easy for us to relate to. I will take the awkward growth and self-redefinition of this album as an omen of my own journey, and I will probably listen to it on repeat until I love each and every song.

Pria Dahiya: So when I was doing research into your show, Lenny Bruce, a big controversial figure known for these obscenity trials, known for shocking the audience, I was listening to some of his standup on the bus this morning and I even got shocked. But for people my age and in our twenties, we're all raised online. We might not be as easily shocked as people were in the past. So I'm wondering, especially for the young audience that's going to be reading your newspaper, what do you think we'll be able to get from the show?
Ronnie Marmo: Oh, wow. That's a big question. You know, it depends on who the student is and and how they were raised, if I'm being honest, because there seems to be three versions of the people showing up at the show in terms of this age demographic. There's the 20 somethings who were raised with cool hipster parents. Lenny, exactly who he was and how important he was, whether they agree with free speech or cancel culture, whatever that looks like, they understand and appreciate what he did for society. Right. There's those people and then there's the kids who are screaming about, ‘you can say whatever you want.’ You can do whatever you want. Right. And so those kids, I still like them to come to have the experience of that. They can make an informed decision on who Lenny was. On the surface, it's interesting because Lenny Bruce was a shock comic, but really today it's so tame what he was doing. I think the sticking point is, if you like David Chappelle, if you like Sarah Silverman, all these people, then you have Lenny to thank. I think it's really important for this generation to understand that Lenny did not believe that you could say whatever you want without consequence. So he would say, I can say whatever I want, but then also my boss is allowed to fire me for that. You know, everybody has that. The people think he was just like, “oh, free speech and screw you.” But that wasn't the truth. It was like, Yes, I can say what I want, but you also can fire me if you'd like to. So, um, I don't know. It's an interesting time in this society right now. I think "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel" put Lenny back on the map for this new generation, giving them a little taste of how Lenny was. But that's just simply an introduction to who he really was, you know?
PD: I was reading that you first did a play about Lenny Bruce before you wrote this play yourself. I was wondering what motivated you to start adapting the script and what you feel, what the personal connection you have to this material?
RM: Well, when I first did this other play, it was called "LENNY BRUCE IS BACK (AND BOY IS HE PISSED)." And the title was funny and the show was good. I grew up on like George Carlin, Richard Pryor, and those guys so I knew of Lenny, but once I did a deep dove into Lenny, you know who he was, I fell in love with the guy because I thought, you know, as an actor, it's very rare to get to jump in the shoes of somebody who you identify so much with on so many levels. And I realized how important he was. So the reason I wrote my own was I found that over time I did a six month run and went really well. Great reviews. I put it down for five years. Then I wanted to revisit the material. I did another six month run. During that second six months around, I started to realize that we didn't do his actual material. We talked about the material. It just felt like a safer version of what I wanted to say. And I think once I understood that on a guttural level, that like Lenny was more than this, what I'm presenting. I felt an obligation to tell the entire truth, warts and all, whether it be pretty or not. I wanted to tell the whole truth, so I set off to write my own and tell the whole story in 90 minutes, if that's possible. And  it took me five years to write it because I'm not a typical writer in that way. I really took my time. And so that why I wrote it, because I felt like there was still a lot left on the table, that if I was going to tell this main story, I want to kind of pick up the battalion or the microphone, as it were, and continue to tell the story that his life got cut short, you know?
PD: What do you feel like you have in common? And also, in what ways you feel like you and Lenny Bruce differ?
RM: That’s really interesting. So in terms of in common, you know, there's so much. But what comes to mind first is his love for his daughter, my love for my daughters, his love for his mom. I love how he had a very special connection with his mom on a level that, you know, wasn't inappropriate. I'm not implying that. But I was like, wow, they're pretty, pretty damn close. These two, you know, as I was with my mom, my special connection when she died young and what else? Mom, I would say I've been clean and sober for 32 years and I never even have a single drink. And so we both struggled with addiction. I was very young and I was lucky enough to find recovery as a kid, and he never did. So I identify with having that gorilla on your back. Again, I was very lucky, early to shake it, you know, his passion, his enthusiasm to talk about things that matter to him, his desire for people to take a look at themselves for change, for holding a mirror up to ourselves and society. I just identify with all of that. Like that was what Lenny was really about, holding a mirror up to society, going, “Well, you may think I'm taking a stand on this issue, but really I'm just examining it. I'm willing to talk about it easily.” And so that's what's dangerous about our culture today. If people don't like what you say, they quickly want to throw you away. And I think it's really dangerous because how do we learn and grow if we're not willing to look at stuff? And see and maybe stay open enough where you don't fall into mob mentality. Maybe, just maybe, you open your own heart, your own mind and see something in a way that maybe you didn't anticipate. So that's important. That's what Lenny represented. And I'm proud to be able to do that as well.
PD: And then do you feel like there are any distinct differences between you two? And if so, how have you been able to rehearse and workshop in practice to resolve those two? Like the differences between you as a person and the character you're portraying? 
RM: You know, five years ago, I could have answered that a lot easier. My heart doesn't know that I'm acting Lenny. I have become, I don't want to say one, but we certainly have come together on a lot of issues that maybe five years ago I disagree with. The only obvious one that I'll speak on for Ronnie as a human. And you have to put things in context. I mean, 60 years ago we just lived in a different world. So yeah. What he was attempting then would not work.
PD: I think I know the bit that you're going to make a reference to the N-word.
RM: I took it out. Did you hear Lenny do it?
PD: I mean, I've heard his stand up, so I've heard that piece before. I was wondering if you were going to comment on it, but I don't have to put it in my article if you're worried that it might be too controversial.
RM: Well, I mean, I'm not worried about anything. You know, I mean we'll talk about that later. But I will comment on it now because we're talking about it. You know, the reality is that I don't think white people should use that word. So I'm not a fan of using that word, but I do understand what Lenny was trying to do sixty years ago. So that's I think that's a really good example of me not believing in the word on its face today, 60 years after Lenny was trying to do something with it, which was all good intention of taking the power out of the word, that was his idea. Absolutely right. Whether it was in other words, whether it didn't. I don't know. I mean, I can give you examples on both sides of that argument. It made me terribly uncomfortable. I couldn't sleep at night doing the bit, but I did it because I thought, well, I'm going to tell the Lenny story, then I'll tell it. And it was always hard to do, I promise you. It was awful. And then when George Floyd happened, I just no longer could do it. I just felt like I couldn't. You know, it's an interesting balance between being absolutely honest and truthful as an artist and telling Lenny's story and also being tone deaf to the world we're living in. I can't be tone deaf. So therein lies where maybe I'm slightly less of a cool artist because I do care how people feel, you know? And I don't want to be stuck on that two minute bit when I'm giving them a 90 minute presentation of this incredible human, you know?
PD: That's such a beautiful way of answering it. And I'm sure that was a challenge in adapting his material. Thank you so much. This is a one-man show. You've done it for years. Something I thought was interesting that you've mentioned in some other interviews is your collaboration with your director. And I'm really wondering, like it must be hard to see this show from an outside perspective after having done it so many times. So what was the process of collaborating with him? You get feedback and workshop the show when you're the creator, the performer, the everything.
RM: So [Joe Mantegna] won a Tony Award for Glengarry on Broadway. Mhm. There he was in The Godfather. He's been on Criminal Minds for the last dozen years or so. Yeah. Huge star and I really, really admire him. So I say all that. I brag about him for a second just to tell you, like I came into the process with him from that point of view, not even starring. I'm a fanboy that he's so talented and so smart and I just look at his abilities. And so the reason I asked Joe to direct this is it's exactly what you said. It's like I needed to be guided by a gentle hand who I trust and admire. Friends were like, Hey, let's do this show because I know 100,000 directors and they're like, You know, maybe I wouldn't have felt the need to be so overly prepared in the rehearsal to leave my guts on the stage from day one. Maybe I wouldn't have done that if it wasn't somebody I looked up to so much. And so the reason Joe was perfect for me is because I just felt like there were only two or three things in the whole process that I fought for. I was like, I trust him. I completely trust him. You're watching it. I can't watch and perform at the same time. And so it was a really big honor and a blessing. And he cares so much. He cares as much as I do. I mean, last Saturday was my 400th performance.
PD: Congratulations.
RM: Thank you. I appreciate it. It’s insane. To do a 90-minute monologue 400 times. So like the directors usually are done after opening late here and he's been there, so he's cared about it as much as me. He's one of the smartest, most talented people I know. I mean, he's texting me right now. Obviously, there's other people that I reached out to. One is a huge star that wanted to do it. I'll leave his name out of it just for the sake of it. But I'm so glad it didn't work out because Joe was who I wanted to do it and I was just waiting for him to get back to me. And I'm so grateful because he just was the guy. He was the guy with the plan to lead this process.
PD: I think that's fantastic. You wrote all this material, obviously drawing a lot from research and you got the rights to Lenny's material. But were there any playwrights or one man shows that you also drew on for help in writing and in structure and things like that?
RM: In fact, I'm going to give Joe some more credit. When I had read the play for him to see if he wanted to do it. I just read it for him and I would say it was like 90% there. And Joe had a few ideas like, why don't we move this here? Why don't we move that back there? And he helped me a little bit with the structure at the end. And then after I wrote my show, there were a few one-man shows that I liked and saw, but this was such a unique experience. I didn't draw from any other shows. I just kind of wrote from my heart and Joe helped me shape it a little bit at the end. But you know, I like "Fleabag." I saw her show and that was cool. So there were a couple of cool shows I liked.
PD: Interesting. Was there anything super unexpected that you ended up learning about Lenny Bruce when you were doing all this research? Anything totally out of left field? I mean, he's already a super fascinating character who did so many crazy things. 
RM: I went into it like everyone else going, Oh, Lenny Bruce, the foulmouthed comic. And then I learned about his heart and his love and his passion and his desire to help with change and hold a mirror up to society. And I learned so much more because I think a lot of people, what I've been told and this is what I would really encourage students at your school, what I've been told is that if you research Lenny Bruce on your own, there's a chance you could miss it. You can miss his magic because a lot of his bits are dated. They might not hold up in terms of references, cultural references and this and that. He also was trying to find his voice. So a lot of times he was just trying to find his voice on stage in front of an audience. So there's a chance you'll listen to some of it and miss it. People say that if you find Lenny through my show and then go research it after seeing my show, you'll get an understanding and a picture of just who he was and how important he was. So, I encourage that. Like the reason we're talking to you is because I told the press people that my dream is that all the students see this issue because I think there's a conversation to be had. And you know what I mean? This might be controversial and you may want to keep it or not keep it. I'll let you decide. But here's the reality. The reality is that the very people that Lenny was fighting for, the brown and black people, the people on the left, people he was fighting for sixty years ago, are the same people today that I have to explain to. And in other words, the people on the right yelling, “screw cancel culture, screw free speech, I can say what I want, right?” So suddenly some of those people think I'm doing the show for that. But that's not who Lenny was representing back then. He was representing the students, the kids who were like, I want to find my voice. I want to do what I want to do, you know? So it's really a bizarre turn of events that 60 years later I'm saying to a lot of young millennials, hey, you know, you might want to really open your heart, your mind and check this out, because it wasn't long ago Lenny was fighting for you and putting you in a position that you're in right now.
PD: Yes. There's some really fascinating stuff. I saw his discussions of police brutality and also Lenny Bruce very famously was Jewish. And we have a big Jewish population here in Pittsburgh, at least in the area I'm living in, Squirrel Hill.
RM: Well, that's amazing. Absolutely. You know, when I first wrote the play, I thought I was writing it for little old Jewish people who saw Lenny. Maybe that's why I thought I wrote it for him. And then "Maisel" came on TV and our audience of young people started to come to the show. “No, wait a minute, I love this. Who's Lenny Bruce?” You know, that's gone long enough where maybe their parents aren't talking about it, you know? But all of a sudden, I look at my audience now and there's tons and tons of 20 year olds. And I'm loving every parent who brings like a 15 year old. My daughter will be 15 and she's seen the play a few times. So I want her to be open to everything. And she also is very much like the youth of today yelling and screaming like, dad, you can't do that, you know? So she still gets on my case about stuff. But in terms of Lenny, I think she really gets it. And the mob mentality is dangerous. And I know that specifically in schools and colleges, my dream is to bring the show to colleges. I want to perform at every college in this country. That's my old goal. Because I think people just need education. Nothing is one way or the other. Things are complicated. People are complicated.
PD: Totally. And I also just think a lot of people don't know that there was work this transgressive happening so long ago.
RM: You're so right. People are so triggered by words now. And rightfully so in some cases. Like, I don't think Lenny was ever mean spirited. I think that's the difference. I'll stand behind Lenny saying he didn't say anything to be mean spirited. He was exploring and trying to flip things on their side and talk about things. You know, that's why I don't think he would say the N-word today. I think he was just too smart for that.
PD: It's a brilliant way of saying it.
RM: I think back then it was acceptable because he was trying to do something extreme so people would listen. You know, it's equivalent in some ways. And I'm not drawing the comparison, but I just want to say it out loud. It's like when Quarterback Colin Kaepernick kneeled against police brutality, everybody was up in arms, right? A couple of years later, everybody got the memo. Suddenly, nobody's apologizing for the guy. He was trying to do something at that time. Just, you know. So I guess what I'm saying is that the first time someone does something out of the box, they usually pay the price. A lot of people benefit from Lenny's willingness to do. He was always up against police brutality and all that. So I would just say people have to look past some of the words. And, you know, one of Lenny's greatest quotes is there are no dirty words, only dirty minds.
PD: Yeah.
RM: You know, I love that. It's like, why is this a dirty word? I do a bit. I don't know if you can curse in your article, but I'll tell you anyway, in the show. And it's basically a bit about using the word ‘fuck you’. It's very funny in the show. But he says, you know, if we actually wanted to hurt somebody, we shouldn’t say fuck you, because fucking is really nice. You know, and it's very funny at the moment in the show. But think about the concept. So, Lenny thinks the word fuck you is nice because that's a nice thing. So he says we shouldn’t say fuck you if you don't like somebody. You know what I mean? It's not a word. It doesn't mean anything. No, they're just that we give words meaning. So it's interesting. I wonder what it's like over there for you guys. Do you think we’ll get a lot of pushback or do you think people will embrace it or a combination.
PD: I mean, I think it depends on the individual, you know, going to drama school. You would hope, you know, there's obviously some pushing of boundaries. I love my school. I hope you get to see a show at CMU drama when you're here because it's a really good place. And I'll definitely try to get people to see your show. But there's still a lot of things that aren't said and a pretty limited palette of material. And it's getting more intense.
RM: You know, I remember I did the N-word bit in New York when I was doing it in the show there. I remember one night there were about a dozen teenagers from this inner city who had never been to a play, and they were largely African-American and Hispanic. And I knew the camp, I knew the counselor very well. And I said, Let me leave you these tickets. I want them to have this experience. So I do the bit I do after the show and I have a little Q&A with this group and I say to the kids, I said, So what do you think? And they all said, Listen, we got it. We got Lenny. We love Lenny. We got it. And then I said, What would you think of the N-word? And this one young girl, she's 16. She was brilliant. She said, you know, it's not good. I didn't get it. It's just I don't want to share that word with white people. That's our anger. And we've earned that word. Yeah. And I don't want Jerry and I and a light bulb went off and I said, “Absolutely, that's brilliant. But isn't it interesting that you were willing to sit through it. Did you always think about that?” She's like, “No, I came up with that here tonight.” And that's what art is. That's what theater is. But you have to be willing to sit through the conversation. And she was brilliant. I was like, You're so smart. That's amazing, you know? But she would have made that connection had she not seen the show.
PD: Completely. Yeah. Fascinating.
RM: And you know, colleges are tough sometimes. I mean, Jerry Seinfeld got booed off stage. He's the cleanest frigging comic we have.
PD: Yeah, it's tough. I'm a big fan of comedy as well. But certainly you've got to keep finding new and inventive ways of relating to modern times. And I think it's fascinating how this show takes a historical figure. But it clearly is still going to have great relevance to audiences now. My last question is, is Pittsburgh specific? I was wondering, why are you bringing the show to Pittsburgh? Are you excited to come to Pittsburgh?
RM: Yeah. So here's my thinking on all that. I grew up a humongous Steeler fan. I grew up in New York, New Jersey, and I was the only Steelers fan. I am a psycho Steelers fan. I've got three Steelers towels, literally. I'm staring at them right now. So I am beyond excited. But on the 15th, I'm doing a performance in Great Barrington, Mass. Then I get off stage at 10 p.m.. I'm driving 9 hours overnight because I want to get to the game on the 16th because you guys aren't playing on the weekend. I'm there for eight days just so I could see the Steelers game. So I am excited. I'm beyond excited. So there's that, right? I love Pittsburgh and I've been there a few times and I just love the whole blue collar mentality. I mean, that's my whole life. I feel like I'm a Pittsburgh person. And something really massive happened in Pittsburgh that I do in the show. Lenny got into a horrible car accident in Pittsburgh. And he and his wife, Honey Harlow, flew out of the car and she got run over twice.
PD: Did she live?
RM: Don't look this up. Yes. So you can have the experience. But I put it in the show and it's really important in the show. It's in the middle of the second act, and it's a huge scene. And so he had a history with Pittsburgh. And I'm excited to come here. And I'm excited when anybody calls and says, “We'd like you to do the show here because we see value in it because of the content.” And I always admire any presenters or venues who are willing to have it, you know, because I think it's so important and it's a controversial show. But I think I think it's cool.

It is Saturday night and I am by far the youngest person in the Byham theater. It’s a little disconcerting actually — I begin to worry about the fact that I do not actually know what this show is going to be about and now about the fact that I do not have a program to tell me. While I might be the only person in a 50-foot radius who knows how to use an iPhone, I am probably also the only person in the same area who does not know who Lenny Bruce was.
Ronnie Marmo is very forgiving of this unfortunate fact. The show he has written to honor the memory of the great 50s comic Lenny Bruce makes me feel like my mother is telling me that, no you have heard of him before. "Remember when we watched that old talk show together on Christmas when you were in the second grade?" "Oh yeah mom, I remember now."
I think one-man shows generally get a pretty bad rep. It was obvious that lighting and sound design were significant considerations in this show, compensating for the sparsity of voices. The choice of jazz for the musical background was really appropriate and set the mood. Prop usage, too, was clever and intentional, especially when it came to the microphone. As a stand-up comedian, Bruce was emotionally close with his microphone, and Marmo embodied that familiarity wonderfully. I would actually argue that this was a two-man show: Bruce and his microphone.
I honestly can’t imagine this show being done in any other format than one-man though; as a person, Lenny Bruce was on his own journey for most of his life. He was his own one-man show. Furthermore, the selected format allowed Marmo to do two really important things that I’ll write about here:
First, Marmo wrote these incredibly smooth transitions into real-life stand up comedy, making the audience feel, almost out of nowhere, like we were sitting in a comedy club in the 50’s. This was an incredibly effective tool especially in setting up Bruce’s character for the remainder of the story, I would say. Marmo, as Bruce, didn’t need to tell us about his comedy career; he showed us, even roaming around off stage. It was a testament to Marmo’s talent too, that he was able to riff off of the audience in an authentic way while remaining in character. It felt almost as if a wall was broken between a telling of the story and a living of its reality. These stand-up scenes served, surprisingly, as comic relief, something I did not think would be necessary but really was.
This brings me to my second point: Marmo’s use of the significant (and female) relationships in Bruce’s life to tell his story. There was something incredibly unique about hearing about Bruce’s relationships from the one-man perspective as opposed to watching other actors portray Bruce’s mother, wife, and daughter. It was more important to the story, and more beautiful, to know how Bruce felt about these people rather than what they were actually like.
Some of the best moments of the show indeed were the painstakingly well-chosen excerpts of speech and writing from Bruce that Marmo included in reference to these people, as well as to Bruce’s particular political opinions and personal values. The writing was poetic and tragic and deeply moving and brought me face to face with Bruce’s most important goals and values. Moments like the comparison of shooting heroin to “kissing God” or the reflection that he has become “every man I hate” after praying to God to save his dying wife were made glowing by the inclusion of deeply true and obviously authentic quotations. My personal favorite was a description of Bruce’s wife Honey: “[...]my every combination of everything […] my mistress, my high priestess.” 
I mean, come on.
The writing was truly what kept me engaged during the entire performance, what made magic out of a man on a stage in a suit. I felt like I was in Bruce’s mind, and I suspect that Marmo felt the same way. During a Q&A after the performance (and in his interview for Pillbox, see page PAGE NUMBER) he discussed the depth of his experience with performing as Bruce, which spans over 10 years and 2 different show runs. The show I watched was his 406th performance of “I’m Not A Comedian… I’m Lenny Bruce!” An audience member asked about his portrayal of Bruce’s mannerisms, and though I cannot speak to a personal knowledge of Bruce, I was certainly persuaded by Marmo’s delicious Long Island accent and his physical motions and his embodiment of such a complex personality. A man who would be arrested and imprisoned for obscenity, who would divorce the stripper he had married, who would talk for hours about his Jewish mother and sex and the great injustices of American society — this is a man who could only be played by someone with enormous talent and experience, and maybe something more.
Marmo spoke to the audience about his relationship with Bruce’s daughter, Kitty, who according to him, believes that there are greater forces at play in Marmo’s similarities to Bruce. I don’t know about you, but I’m a sucker for that fate stuff, and Marmo’s performance was convincing enough so as to have me believing it, too. 
In the end, Bruce dies of a drug overdose and Marmo rearranges himself into his “tastefully” nude position atop a toilet that has been sitting on the side of the stage for the length of the play, quietly reminding us that he is dust, and unto dust he shall return. Beginning and ending with Bruce’s death was the perfect simple circular plotline to hold all the very complicated details in the center, but Marmo kept it interesting enough that it didn’t feel cliché. It felt as epically tragic as it really was, with police officers arranging a needle back into his dead arm. It felt like Lenny Bruce was not a comedian, as the title “I’m Not A Comedian, I’m Lenny Bruce” suggests. He was an activist, a father, a son. He was just a man.

After a dynamic start to the 22-23 season with "Rusalka," the Pittsburgh Opera is set to perform "The Marriage of Figaro", one of Mozart’s most well-known pieces, from Nov. 5 to Nov. 13, 2022. This past week, I sat down with Evan Lazdowski, a bass-baritone Resident Artist at Pittsburgh Opera. This season, he will be performing the roles of Antonio and Figaro (in the student matinee). With Carnegie Mellon’s reputation as both a school strong in STEM, but also well-versed in the dramatic arts, I decided to ask questions regarding both the technical side of opera, as well as questions for the burgeoning opera-lover! Below are excerpts of our conversation.
Q: Tell me a bit about yourself!
A: I just started the Pittsburgh Opera resident artist program this year and I’m a first-year resident artist. All of us are actually in our first year in the program. A lot of these programs, people are in them for two or three years. It’s often a good mixture—but since we’re all first-years, we all have that in common—we’re all new to this and we’re in it together. Basically, as resident artists we’re responsible, in addition to singing roles and covering roles, performing at different events in the city of Pittsburgh when we’re not busy or rehearsing a show. We do performances at Market Square during the farmer’s market, we do things like singing during background concerts in the Cultural District. There are popup concerts we do as well.
*Successful alumni of the Pittsburgh Opera’s Resident Artist Program include Kevin Short and Jonathan Beyer
Q: For first-time opera go-ers, what should they expect from "The Marriage of Figaro"?
A: I think what’s important to expect is a sense of fun. I feel like because of what a lot of people associate with the operatic art form, they expect things to be kind of straight-laced, strict, and clean. Especially with a show like Marriage of Figaro, there’s a sense of fun. People feel that in the audience, including people who have been going to the opera for years. They’re not there to be fancy, everyone is there to have a good time. It is not straight-laced, anyone can come and relax and enjoy themselves. It’s a lot of great fun!
Q: Given that the Marriage of Figaro is such a loved classic, what do you think separates the Pittsburgh Opera’s production of it from the rest?
A: It’s interesting, what usually happens now at most companies when they perform something like this—they kind of put a modern spin on it. The Met Opera has done a production for a few years now where its set in the 1930s. This production is different that its set in the time period, we have period costumes, the wigs, the makeup, the long stockings, things like that. You go back to the operatic history like 30 or 40 years ago. There were a lot more period pieces. The Mozart pieces were done in the period—it wasn’t set in a casino, which the Met has done. This is a case of the inverse, most of these classics have a modern spin on it, but we’re going against the grain.
Q: Do you have any favorite moments from the show as either Antonio or Figaro?
A: I have to say, it helps for me that in I’ve done the role of Figaro in the past. That means that I’ve learned the music before, so things are less stressful in that way. Usually when people are doing it for the first time, they make a big deal of the Act II finale because there’s so much going on. I feel lucky that I’ve done that before, so now because I’ve rehearsed those two scenes, I can have a fun time. There’s so much humor, so much fun that’s going on. There are so many story beats in quick succession. My two favorite opera scenes of all time have become the two in the show.
Q: What made you decide to pursue opera, or music in general, as a career?
A: I think what started it for me was doing all the high school musicals when I was younger. I played a character where I had to — I find this is a common story that a lot of singers have — they have to mimic the operatic sound that they’ve heard in commercials, in TV shows. I had to do that in a show once, and there was a voice teacher in the audience that heard me that knew I was pretending, but heard something “real” to build off of. It took some convincing, but after a while I started to become more interested and what did that for me was watching Amadeus for the first time. Watching the opera scenes, I do remember that being the moment where I thought “Wow, opera is really cool.” I got on board with my teacher at the time because of that. The ball kept rolling from there, it’s gotten to the point where I’ve done this for a decade. I just love what I do!
Q: How has working with the Pittsburgh Opera as a Resident Artist been like thus far?
A: Depending on the events the company has coming up, they have all kinds of celebrations and events they do here throughout the city. Kind of make ourselves known and give the gift of music to the people of Pittsburgh. We work around 6 days a week — if we’re not doing a show, we’ll maybe have two or three coachings a day where we work on our own repertoire or rehearse the music we want to do. Sometimes we do these concerts at the Pittsburgh Opera building in the Strip District. They’re called brown bag concerts, one-hour programs that happen once every few weeks or so. The last one we did, we did a condensed one hour version of Figaro with selected scenes. We have another one coming up with operatic repertoire and musical theatre that is themed around Thanksgiving. There’s one for Christmas, one for Valentine’s Day. Our coachings are often based around the repertoire we have for those programs. For Figaro, we often have days where we’re working from 11 AM to 10 PM. There’s a good long break for lunch, a good long break for dinner. I’ve had multiple days this week where it’s been hours of staging, review. We put this show together really quickly—basically a week and a half. It’s been really amazing, and an educational opportunity for me. When we’re doing a show 11 AM – 2 PM, 3 PM - 5 PM , 7 PM – 10 PM, sometimes it can be a lot of hours but it helps us to put the shows together in a really efficient way.
Q: What advice do you have for any budding opera singers at CMU?
A: This resonates with me recently because of all the auditions I’ve been doing. Last year, when I was finishing up graduate school, what I was told, which I think has helped me, is that ultimately teachers will tell you “you need to sing what’s healthy, what’s comfortable”, which is very important, but it is important to find at least one piece in your audition packet that you love. The piece of advice I was given multiple times was to sing what you love. Of course, you’re told to sing beautifully, have great understanding of foreign language, great diction—but when you sing what you love, and it’s something you listen to over and over and that you enjoy—all those extra details will take care of themselves because you love it so much that all those details work themselves out. Those details will have your back. Yes, find your package that is varied and healthy, but also include something you love.
Q: If there was one role in any show you could perform at any venue, who and where would it be, and why?
A: Because I have this great theatrical background and I love Shakespeare, where I lived, I did a production with a Shakespeare company. I would love to sing as Nick Bottom in Benjamin Britten’s interpretation of "A Midsummer’s Night Dream."
Student tickets are available at a discounted price at the Pittsburgh Opera! Grab a friend and enjoy the upcoming performances of "The Marriage of Figaro" on November 5, 8, 11, and 13.

Cassandra, it’s funny how things run in circles. 
It has been a year since things really started to happen for us here, since we learned where Sorrell’s library is, since I met Miles. There are some things you just never get over, and I think Miles is one of those things. He keeps on running in circles. 
Just like I keep ending up at the same tables, in the same spots where important things happened last year. I keep on making the same mistakes, eating the same meals, going for the same walks when I feel like I need to clear my head.
I’m not complaining, I’m just saying that nothing is different. Maybe I’m glad for it, I don’t know. I didn’t really want to have to move forward after how perfect last year was. I learned a lot, sure, and changed a lot, but that doesn’t mean anything has to be different this year. 
One valuable thing I learned that I think other people should know, for the record, is that meeting somebody at a frat party is not the same thing as fate.
Anyways, I think I have more perspective now, after what happened last night. I know you already heard it, but I need to write it out again. I was just going home after class, it wasn’t even particularly late. It was around 9 p.m.; I had that late writing lab for science fiction. At first I thought it was a residual figment of that class. Lou sitting inside my locked room when I opened my door, lounging casually in my desk chair clearly in companionship with someone across the room. I looked comically over towards my bed to see none other than Wendy, sitting criss-cross applesauce on my bed. They were both looking at their phones, not speaking.
My first thought, if you can imagine it, was how the hell there were two people sitting in my ID-padlocked single dorm, one of whom was supposed to be across the country in California. 
I dropped my water bottle to the floor, where it landed with a thud. Neither of them turned to look at me.
“Lou?” I prompted.
Still no reaction. I walked further into the room, stood in between them. It was too quiet, I couldn’t be in there with them, they didn’t seem real or even like humans. I sputtered and walked out the door, into the hallway. It was still too quiet. I walked to my suitemate's door and knocked aggressively. No answer. I walked further, to the door of some girls I’d met while moving in. 
Their door was slightly ajar, so that when I knocked, it fell open. I called out, but there was nobody inside. I went to the next door. It was also ajar, and the dorm behind it equally empty. This pattern was repeated at every door I went to. At the last one, 42, there were voices behind the ajar door, but no people. Every dorm on the floor appeared to be empty.
When I got back to my room, it was empty too, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that Lou and Wendy were not gone. Evidently I was all alone on the floor, and maybe even in the building, but there were ghosts all around me, I could feel it. 
I am surrounded by ghosts.
Margaret.

A mere night before Carnegie Mellon University’s highly anticipated and much needed Fall Break, Dominique Armani Jones, more commonly known as the rapper Lil Baby, finally released his highly anticipated album “It’s Only Me” after a nearly three-year hiatus. Following his last album “My Turn,” which topped the charts for five weeks and was one of the best performing albums of 2020, it would be an understatement to say that Lil Baby was under pressure to maintain his position at the top of the rap game. In “It’s Only Me,” Mr. Jones delivered a whopping 23-song project featuring some well established names in the rap community. However, it seems that this album didn’t fully represent the Atlanta rapper’s real potential.
In his six year career, Lil Baby has undoubtedly enjoyed explosive success as fans followed his “up-and-coming” persona and “hungry” attitude. One of Jones’ greatest appeals, compared to established rappers and other artists trying to make it in the industry, has been his willingness to fight to secure his place at the top and refusing to wait for success to find him. However, on this album, we find Lil Baby leaning heavily on just a limited number of his strengths — almost retreating deep into his comfort zone, leaving little opportunity for himself to experiment with new beats, sounds, or flows. The obvious explanation for this is a reluctance to meddle with a tried and true strategy, but coupled with the length of the project, the album sounds monotonous and generally uninspired as his beats and flows sound similar from song to song. This is not to say that the songs are bad or even mediocre, but considering what we know he is capable of and demonstrated in “My Turn,” the new album undeniably could have been better. 
One of Lil Baby’s greatest strengths is his ability (in a completely, seemingly-effortless way) to manipulate language, making otherwise generic and borderline forgettable lines into catchy, memorable lyrics. Additionally, he’s historically been able to rap, honestly and interestingly, about what is currently happening in his life. Many artists in rap often fall back on old stories of their pasts or generic clichés about fame and riches. In this latest album, we begin to see hints of this in lyrics such as the one on "From Now On" about buying too many houses, or gloating in the intro about dinner with Kris Jenner, or talking about blowing a bag on new veneers on "Everything." With that being said, we can clearly see glimpses of Lil Baby’s greatness on “It’s Only Me.” On songs like “Real Spill,” “Forever,” and “Double Down,” his lyricism is authentic and soulful, providing something fresh amidst the plethora of tracks. 
In a word, this album was… slightly above mid. Given the potential Lil Baby has demonstrated in the past, especially with “My Turn” and his unprecedented run on features immediately following that album, his project sounds repetitive and mildly lackluster. Overall, I’d call it a missed opportunity for one of the biggest rappers of this generation to show off all the areas where he’s strongest or experiment with something new (or both, given how long the album is). However, the constant jabs at DJ Akademiks littered throughout the album are a funny detail that enhance the project as a whole. The next challenge Lil Baby faces is with his next album, which will determine if he is still on top or is on the road to the fall off. Can Lil Baby put together a classic project with no skips?

Effective November 7, Carnegie Mellon will be implementing a new student minimum wage of $10 per hour campus-wide. This is an increase of $1.75 per hour on the current student minimum wage of $8.25 per hour. On this day, all hourly student worker positions earning less than $10 an hour will be transitioned to the new minimum wage.
This new minimum wage will affect students who are classified as hourly student workers. These are undergraduate and graduate students who are paid hourly by a hiring department that are not associated with the student worker academic program; it also does not include Ph.D. or Master’s students who serve as teaching assistants or research assistants as a part of their program in exchange for a stipend. 
The last Carnegie Mellon minimum wage increase was August 21, 2017, when the minimum wage was increased to $8.25 per hour from $7.75. Prior to that, there was an increase from $7.25 to $7.75 on October 17, 2016. No changes to the Carnegie Mellon minimum wage have been made since. 
As of March 1, there are 4,211 hourly student workers. 1,504 graduate student hourly workers made an average of $16.63 per hour while 2,707 undergraduate hourly student workers made an average of $12.69 an hour. Currently, positions that earn $8.25 per hour make up three percent of the student hourly worker population. This includes the positions of desk attendant, events assistant, and some teaching assistants. 61 percent of hourly student positions earn above $13 per hour, and 42 percent earn above $15 per hour (84 percent of graduate hourly positions earn above $15 an hour).
The increase to $10 an hour has achieved the goal of a Fall 2015 student-led proposal. Following this proposal, a working group was established that consisted of members from student affairs, human resources, academic units, and students. The above wage increases were the result of that working group. 
In Fall 2021, the Undergraduate Student Senate Committee on Business Affairs released a white paper regarding the “CMU Student Labor Situation.” This white paper included about 150 survey responses from hourly student workers that asked about students’ knowledge and past experience at Carnegie Mellon. This sample size represented about three percent of the hourly student workers with strong representation of teaching assistants. The white paper made three recommendations: wage and contract transparency with recruiting and hiring consistencies, a minimum wage raise to $11 per hour over five years, and a focus on workplace culture. 
In Spring 2022, another working group composed of Carnegie Mellon staff and students was formed to make recommendations regarding student employment. Five recommendations were advanced to University Leadership this past summer. 
The first was regarding consistency and transparency in hourly student recruitment and hiring practices. One aspect of this recommendation is to create new job profiles for the Teaching Assistant position that provide Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 descriptions with appropriate pay ranges and best practices.
In this new setup, graders would be classified as Level 1, course assistants would be classified as Level 2, and teaching assistants would be classified as Level 3. Graders are solely responsible for grading, while course assistants are additionally responsible for student contact, office hours, and recitations. Full teaching assistants would have the similar responsibilities as a course assistant, but also be responsible for teaching. Minimum wages for Level 1 will be $11 for undergraduates and $13 for graduates; Level 2 will be $13 for undergraduates and $15 for graduates; Level 3 will be $15 for undergraduates and $17 for graduates. As of Nov. 7, the Level 1 minimum wage will be rolled out to all current teaching assistant positions. Phase 2 will be implemented Jan. 3, 2023 and includes building out teaching assistant job profiles and the rollout of Level 2 and Level 3 minimum wages. 
Currently, the average minimum wage at peer universities is $11.75 per hour. This ranges from $15.95 per hour at Stanford to $7.25 at many peer institutions. However, when adjusted to Pittsburgh by Cost of Labor Differential, the average becomes $10.63 per hour, and when adjusted to Pittsburgh by Cost of Living Differential, the average becomes $9.45 per hour. Carnegie Mellon’s new minimum wage will be between these two averages. The projected average student worker rate is $14.44 per hour, which is 153 percent higher than the equivalent cost of living minimum wage and 136 percent higher than the equivalent cost of labor minimum wage. 
The Federal Work Study Program currently has maximum hourly wages of $12 per hour for undergraduates and $16 per hour for graduate students. However, based upon spring 2022 data, 61.4 percent of campus hourly student positions pay above this maximum. As such, Carnegie Mellon Enrollment Services will be increasing the limit from $12 per hour to $13 per hour for undergraduates and $16 per hour to $17 per hour for graduate students, effective immediately.

On Oct. 20, British Prime Minister (PM) Liz Truss announced her resignation. Truss had been appointed only 45 days earlier, making her by far the shortest-ever serving prime minister.
By Oct. 25, Rishi Sunak was appointed in her place, making him the U.K.’s third prime minister in just seven weeks. Truss’ tenure was remarkable from start to finish, with unusual circumstances marking both its start and end. Truss’s predecessor, Boris Johnson, was pushed out of government by his own party after his numerous scandals finally caught up with him, and Truss was failed by her own undercooked economic plan. This revolving door of Conservative leaders is taking place during an increasingly dire cost-of-living crisis.
The crisis, which began in 2021, is spreading across all sectors of the economy. Energy costs are skyrocketing, the National Health Service is overwhelmed, and inflation is at its highest in decades. As a result, twice the number of U.K. households are now living with little or no discretionary income (personal income minus taxes). According to Asda Income Tracker data, the percentage grew from 20 to 40 in just nine months. Unsurprisingly, this crisis is hitting lower-income Brits the hardest. In August, the average household’s disposable income fell by 129 pounds ($149) per month, while the highest-income quintile actually saw their disposable income increase.
Back in 2019, the Conservatives enjoyed a landslide victory when Johnson was elected to the head office, but voter confidence in the party has been plummeting over the three years since. Many Conservative voters’ Brexit-fueled enthusiasm is long gone, tempered by Johnson’s string of controversy and the party’s apparent inability to improve economic conditions.
When a U.K. prime minister leaves office mid-term, their party (the dominant party in Parliament) must appoint someone new. After Johnson’s resignation, the two Conservative frontrunners for PM were Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak. Truss was seen as the “Johnson legacy” candidate — someone who would continue his policy plans (hopefully with less controversy). Sunak’s campaign was relatively moderate, at least by Conservative standards, and the deviation from Johnson led some Conservatives to see him as a "traitor". When the vote went to the public, party members selected Truss by 18 points, or 20,000 votes, though Conservatives expected an even wider margin. 
Truss is the third woman prime minister following Margaret Thatcher and Theresa May, both of whom were also Conservatives. Notably, many of Truss’s stated goals were reminiscent of Thatcher’s signature neoliberal policies back in the 1980s. During the bitter campaign against Sunak, Truss promised a “bold plan” to boost the economy by cutting taxes. 
Truss enjoyed strong public approval upon coming to office, but it quickly diminished — wilted, even. As The Economist said, her longevity equated to “roughly the shelf-life of a lettuce.”
Once in office, Truss wasted little time implementing her proposed policies. In fact, she went even further than what she promised in her campaign.
While Truss’s tax plan lived up to her “bold” promise, it quickly became clear that when she promised “tax cuts,” she did not mean for the working class. Instead, the cut was to the top rate of income tax, and briefings said that the government may announce even more. As NPR put it, “they were doubling down. They were really going for it.”
Unfortunately for the U.K., the aggressive cuts had the opposite of their intended effect, and it was revealed that they were not fully thought out before implementation. Truss had failed to submit the plan to the Independent Budget Office, meant to advise on economic policy, and “there was not really a plan for how to pay for any of [the tax cuts or spending].” In addition to the cuts, Truss had proposed government spending that would give money to people and businesses, which is the opposite of what is usually advised to fight inflation. Before the policies were even implemented, economists questioned their efficacy.
So once the policies rolled out, panic ensued everywhere from global investors to British members of parliament. Gary Gibbon, political editor for the U.K.’s Channel 4 News, remarked on “how many MPs I came across who were looking at their phones and looking at graph lines. And they were the graph lines that showed you the pound sliding against the dollar, the graph lines that showed you the cost of government borrowing going up.” Trussonomics had failed.
The parallels between Truss and Thatcher don’t end at their campaign promises — back in July, inflation rose above 10% for the first time in 40 years, and in September the British pound reached its lowest value against the U.S. dollar since 1985. Both records were previously set amid Thatcher’s three consecutive terms from 1979-90. Unfortunately for Truss, though, she will not go down in history with the reverence afforded to Thatcher. Instead of being remembered on par with The Iron Lady, she has already been dubbed “The Iceberg Lady” (an apparent reference to her wilting popularity).
As the economy tanked, the finance minister announced that the country would abandon the tax plan, but even that was not enough to save Truss. Almost as soon as she arrived, she had resigned, admitting that she could not deliver what she had promised — though she believed in her economic strategy until the bitter end. In her resignation speech, Truss pointed to Putin’s war in Ukraine and the U.K.’s long-term “low economic growth.” Instead of admitting any fault in the underlying strategy or even the failed rollout of her plan, Truss cited the nebulous “situation” as the problem: “I recognize that though, given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party.”
As Truss stepped down, the process for selecting another prime minister began. In order to progress to the next round of the PM race, any candidate nominated by the majority party must receive at least 100 votes from that party’s members of Parliament. If more than one candidate reaches 100 votes, the party will first cast “indicative” votes to see if there is a clear leader, and if the results are inconclusive, the winner is selected by an online vote of party members.
All this leads to the current prime minister: Rishi Sunak. Sunak seemed to be the obvious choice after being the previous runner-up, but his path to office was almost blocked by a surprising opponent: Boris Johnson. That’s right — the disgraced prime minister who had not even been out of office for two months. In a move similar to Donald Trump’s 2024 presidential run, Johnson decided to run again. He campaigned briefly before dropping out two days ahead of Sunak’s appointment.
Sunak previously served as minister of finance under Johnson until July of this year, when he resigned amid the “Partygate” scandal. Some Conservatives now consider Sunak a traitor against Johnson and the party, because his resignation seemed to mark the beginning of the end for Johnson’s tenure.
The third opponent in the Conservative Party race was Penny Mordaunt, a cabinet minister looking to take her political career to the next level. Mordaunt’s colleagues encouraged her to run as a “fresh start” for the U.K., while some viewed her as a compromise candidate for those who did not want to vote for Sunak or Johnson. Mordaunt’s poll numbers were low throughout the race, and she dropped out before the required deadline, leaving Sunak as the only candidate.
Sunak became the first person of South Asian descent, the first Hindu, and the youngest person to ever hold the office. Another notable first — Sunak’s appointment marks the first time that the prime minister’s net worth is greater than that of the crown.
Some see Sunak as out of touch with the average working-class Briton. Sunak is one of the U.K.’s wealthiest politicians, with an impressive (and expensive) education. He previously worked at Goldman Sachs, and is married to a tech heiress. Together, their net worth is estimated to be $827 million. During his summer campaign, his history became an obstacle when a video clip from a 2007 BBC documentary resurfaced in which Sunak suggested that he does not have any “working-class friends,” in addition to his wife, Akshata Murty’s, alleged tax evasion. Basically, he became the latest poster boy for out-of-touch Conservative politicians. Although since the prime ministerial race is in the hands of his own party, this controversy did not significantly harm his chances.
In the eyes of his supporters, Sunak is a reliable economic influence. Partly because of his strong background in finance, and largely bolstered by his correct predictions that Truss’s “fairy tale” economics would backfire.
While in many ways Sunak aligns with the usual Conservative agenda, he has made some notable waves. After George Floyd’s murder in 2020, then-PM Johnson said that he does not believe the U.K. is a racist country, but Sunak responded on Twitter by sharing the hardships his family faced as immigrants to Britain, saying: “As a British Asian of course I know that racism exists in this country.” Sunak has also publicized his Hindu faith, and swore in to the office of PM on the Bhagavad Gita, a revered Hindu text.
Seeing as Sunak was only appointed this week, we will all have to wait and see how his term plays out. He is admittedly in quite a tough situation — if Johnson left an economic garbage fire in his wake, Truss has poured gasoline on it. Will Sunak last, or will he spoil like fresh produce? Only time will tell.

Iran has been the victim of yet another cyberattack targeting their nuclear energy sector, heralding back to the Stuxnet attack that first targeted Iranian nuclear systems back in 2010. This time, email servers were the target, with activist group Black Reward accessing email servers belonging to Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization at the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant. 
Simon Sharwood of The Register explains that the group claims to have pulled information from over 324 inboxes, leading to a total haul of over 100,000 messages and 50 gigabytes of files. 
The hack occurred in the midst of heavy civil unrest in Iran, sparked by recent actions by Iran’s police in enforcing their Hijab policies. Apurva Venkat of CSO explains that despite claims by the Iranian government that the attack was an effort by other countries to gain information on their nuclear program, Iran-based hacking group Black Reward has come out and not only claimed responsibility, but also stated that the hack was in support of the ongoing protests in Iran. 
Such protests have become widespread after the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman who was taken into custody by Iran’s morality police for allegedly not following the conservative dress code and died after being detained. This follows a long timeline of other women being arrested or beaten in the streets if the Iranian morality police don’t believe they are adhering to national policies. Mahsa Amini’s death seems to be the breaking point for Iran, as the country has been racked with violence as massive protests against such restrictive policies and inhumane treatment have been met with police backlash. Many protestors have also been arrested by Iran’s police force as a result of such backlash.
Venkat furthers that Black Reward tried to use their recent hack as a way to pressure the government, threatening to “release hacked information in 24 hours unless the authorities released political prisoners and people arrested during the recent unrest.” Iran did not comply, and statements from the Bushehr plant call the hack an act of desperation to attract public attention. 
As a result, Black Reward posted a downloadable link of around 85,000 cleaned emails that they claim is “perfect for researchers and journalists.” Venkat furthers that initial reports of the information claim that it contains management and operational schedules, visa and passport information of Iranian and Russian nuclear experts, and information on finances and company agreements. 
For Iran, this is only the most recent attack in a long line of cyberattacks targeting their nuclear energy system. The international community largely views Iran’s nuclear energy system as a stepping stone for their broader plans to obtain nuclear weapons, which is a key goal for a government that is trying to expand their influence abroad and prove they are a key power player. As a result, the program is often attacked by those who want to prevent nuclear weapons development or to simply target the Iranian state. 
Such attacks started in 2010 with the Stuxnet virus, which Paulius Ilevicius of NordVPN says targeted the centrifuges of Iran’s nuclear enrichment facilities by taking advantage of zero-day vulnerabilities (i.e., unplugged holes in software) in the Windows system, which severely crippled Iran’s nuclear program at the time. This project is widely considered to be a joint US-Israel cyberattack meant to achieve their political goals. In recent years though, attacks on the system have more been used as warnings to show that outside actors exist. For example, Rich McCormick of the Verge explains one such occasion where hackers hijacked the computers in Iranian nuclear facilities to play Thunderstruck by AC/DC. At full volume. In the middle of the night. 
The release of such information to the public only opens up the Iran nuclear program to more attacks, with Venkat describing it as potentially paving the way for another Stuxnet. It also increases international scrutiny on the program to ensure it is solely for nuclear energy development and not nuclear weapons, with the emails giving researchers a novel pathway for analysis. 
The true goals of this hack don’t lie in the national security implications for the information, but in what the hack stood for. The Iranian people are rising up against the policies and enforcement mechanisms of the Iran government, and they have hackers on their side.

The Undergraduate Student Senate held their weekly meeting this past week on Thursday, Oct. 27. Many of the presented topics dealt with honorariums, the Joint Funding Committee (JFC), and finances.
The first order of business from the Committee on Student Organizations (CoSO) to amend bylaws regarding honorariums. To receive an honorarium as a member of CoSO under the proposed amendment, members must attend two-thirds of the weekly meetings. 
The proposed amounts are $500 per member per year for new members and $750 per member per year for returning members. CoSO committee directors will also receive an additional honorarium. Current honorariums are $500 for committee directors and $250 for members. The vote on this proposed amendment will occur at the next Senate meeting. 
The Student Senate handled two Special Allocations requests this week. Mayar - South Asian Student Association (SASA) requested $1,000 to cover an unexpected higher cost of food for their annual Diwali celebration. Mayar - SASA is a “South Asian social, cultural, and philanthropic organization at CMU.” The motion was approved.
The second request was made by the Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers (SASE). SASE is a “National collegiate society aiming to increase diversity in workplaces, help people of Asian heritage succeed professionally.” SASE asked for $4,096.75 to help cover the cost of a conference registration and hotel rooms for the SASE national conference. The motion was approved. 
The Senate also voted to approve a Senate Budget Amendation. The proposed budget change would take $1,450 from the Senate Executive Committee (Excomm) Initiative fund and put it toward a salary for a new Chief of Staff. The purpose of this role is to keep the Senate website up to date, make room reservations, maintain the Senate Google Calendar, and create and maintain a wiki with Senate institutional knowledge and best practices. The reason for this position is due to the work put into Senate, the frequent turnover in Excomm and General Body membership, and the potential for administrative consolidation in Fiscal Year 2024 (FY24). The amendment was approved.
The next proposed change was on Senate fiscal policy. This proposed change involves expediting Special Allocations requests. The change in Senate policy would make it so requests under $2,500 (instead of $750) could receive an Expedited Recommendation. This means that smaller allocations would no longer receive a full presentation at Senate General Body meetings. 
The Senate Finance Committee would also only need a two-thirds majority rather than a unanimous vote to make an Expedited Recommendation. This proposed change will be voted on at the next Senate meeting. 
The FY24 slate for the Joint Funding Committee was also presented to the Senate to be approved. There are slated to be 27 JFC members — 22 undergraduate and five graduate students. Nine are from Tepper School of Business, eight are from Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, five are from Carnegie Institute of Technology, three are from School of Computer Science, and there is one each from Mellon College of Science and Heinz College of Information and Public Policy; there is no representative from College of Fine Arts. 
The Senate’s next meeting will be Nov. 3. The JFC Bylaw amendment presentation that was originally scheduled for the Oct. 27 meeting will happen at this meeting.

Last Friday, a male intruder broke into Nancy and Paul Pelosi’s San Francisco home searching for Nancy, and assaulted her husband with a hammer.
Jamie Gangel of CNN describes the incident, where the assailant broke into the Pelosi home and went upstairs to their bedroom where Paul was asleep. She furthers that the intruder brought zip ties, duct tape, and a hammer to the household in what is being considered an intentional entry specifically targeting the Pelosis, and proceeded to try to tie Paul up.
Luckily, Richard Winton of L.A. Times explains, Paul was able to call 911 while in the bathroom and left the line open, allowing the police to hear conversation between Paul and the assailant and dispatch forces to the scene, who arrived in only two minutes. In released information pertaining to the call, it appears that Paul gave coded statements to the police on how he was waiting for his wife and was with his “friend” David, which the 911 operator was able to decipher as a potentially dangerous situation and dispatch forces with a higher priority. 
Winton notes that when the police arrived, Paul and his assailant were both trying to gain control of a single hammer, and upon police instruction to back off, the assailant “‘immediately’ pulled the tool from Pelosi and ‘violently attacked him with the hammer.” As he attacked Paul, the assailant was said to be shouting “Where is Nancy?” repeatedly.
Police were able to tackle the assailant to get him off Paul Pelosi, but not before Paul sustained multiple blows to the head, arms, and hands.
Jamie Gangel of CNN reports that the assailant has been identified as David DePape, a 42-year-old man with no prior connection to the Pelosis. 
Alyssa Goard of NBC Bay Area explains that DePape was active online, and from posts that were dug up from sites he appeared to operate, he seemed to believe heavily in conspiracy theories and would “at times have contradictory views.” While most of his websites and posts have been taken down, the remaining website he authored includes rants about the 2020 election results and COVID-19 among other topics, and there was heavy anti-semitism and far-right extremism throughout his writing. Winton further analyzes his personal blog and highlights posts titled “Manipulation of History” and “It’s OK to be white,” as well as mentioning far-right message board 4chan and many conspiracy theories about COVID-19, the war in Ukraine, and QAnon. 
Anders Hagstrom of Fox News also notes DePape’s history of mental illness with an ex-partner he raised two kids with. Both that partner and his estranged family in Canada offered commentary on the events. 
Winton furthers that DePape now faces multiple felony charges, including: “suspicion of attempted murder, first-degree burglary, assault with a deadly weapon, threatening a family member of a public official, elder abuse, battery with serious bodily injury, dissuading a witness and injuring a wireless device.”
Luckily, Paul Pelosi seems to be making an active recovery. Julia Shapero of The Hill reports that Paul underwent surgery on Friday to repair a skull fracture and injuries on his right arm and hands, and is expected to make a full recovery from the attack. 
This attack has led to a wave of politicians denouncing violence and offering sympathy to the Pelosi family. Julia Shapiro of The Hill explains that notable Democrat and Republican leaders have addressed the recent attack. Notable Republican politicians who have denounced the attack include Mitch McConnell, Mike Pence, Ted Cruz, and Lindsay Graham, while others like former President Trump and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy have stayed silent, prompting backlash from Democrats like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. 
Democrats including President Biden have rallied behind Pelosi, offering their support and denouncing violence in politics. Democratic supporters have also called out Republican politicians who have used the attack to support their own political agenda or sweep it under the rug. 
Amy Wang of the Washington Post explains how the attack has also led to lawmakers pressing for better security measures for prominent political figures, noting that while top House and Senate leaders have protective details, their families do not — hence why Paul Pelosi was unprotected in California while his wife was working in D.C. 
Wang furthers that an important consideration when looking at new legislation is the fact that threats aren’t just limited to political leaders, but also seen throughout Congress. Senator Amy Klobuchar believes that not only should security be re-evaluated, but social media proliferation of hate speech and falsehoods, as well as the prevalence of violence-promotion in politics as a whole need to be addressed.
As for the Paul Pelosi incident, justice is in the process of being served, as the arraignment for DePape occurs this Tuesday.

Workers for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette have been striking since Thursday, Oct. 6. The striking unions include the Communications Workers of America Locals 14842 and 14827, Teamsters Local 205/211 and Pressmen’s Union Local 24M/9N. According to workers in those unions, they have been working without a collective bargaining agreement since March 2017, and have not gotten a pay raise in the past 16 years. They also believe that management has refused to bargain in good faith and made unilateral changes to members’ health care plan. 
The Post-Gazette strike is backed by the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh, which includes Post-Gazette reporters. The vote for newsroom workers to strike was close, reporting at 38 to 36. The union represents a total of 101 newsroom employees, but a number of employees have since resigned from the Guild and stayed working through the strike. 
Workers at the Post-Gazette had their health insurance terminated Oct. 1; union officials stated that if BCI had paid an additional $19 per employee per week, this coverage could have been maintained. However, with the provided coverage, workers were paying more than eight percent of wages toward insurance premiums. A proposal from BCI to unions that was rejected included a nine percent wage increase and enrollment in their company health care plan. 
A group that stated that they represented a large portion of the Post-Gazette employees who continue to work said the Guild “commenced with a strike with fewer than 40 percent of its members voting in favor of the move,” and, “[the strike vote] was taken under the pressure of the Communications Workers of America.” The Guild is part of NewsGuild, which is part of the Communications Workers of America. According to this group, Communications Workers of America “threatened to unilaterally impose a strike on the local and remove its leadership if the vote did not conform to its wishes.” 
The journalists were not the first division of the Post-Gazette to go on strike — pressmen and drivers were on strike before journalists joined them.
As we did in 2019, The Tartan Editorial Board stands with the striking workers of the Post-Gazette. The paper’s management under the Block Brothers has been subpar at best, and this strike has been a long time coming. However, a strike like this should solely be due to the workers’ wants — not because a large entity pressured workers to strike. 
Local journalism is important on all levels — from a college newspaper like The Tartan to a city paper like the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Since the Block Communications, Inc., (BCI) taking ownership of the paper, it has turned from a daily publication into two physical newspapers a week with a daily digital edition. This is a common story for local newspapers; however, the job of journalism is still necessary and will continue to be. These striking workers are fighting for better working terms for a necessary publication. 
Despite the strike, the Post-Gazette has still been printing through the Butler Eagle, who The Tartan also uses to print our weekly newspaper. The president and publisher of the Butler Eagle defended the company’s decision, stating his belief that the Post-Gazette would cease to exist if a third party was not printing the paper. The Tartan will continue to print with the Butler Eagle, but we do not agree with their decision to print the Post-Gazette. We believe that it should be BCI’s responsibility to reach a deal with the striking workers rather than outsource their work to a third party printer. 
As we continue into an era where companies are seemingly monetizing everything, journalism is no exception. But without local journalism, we, as readers, will feel lost and unaware in our communities. From The Tartan to the Post-Gazette and everything bigger, smaller, and in-between, we must fight for journalism and local news. These workers deserve reasonable working conditions and compensation, and The Tartan supports their fight.

Novel-tea is The Tartan’s literary and language opinion column, so if you like hot takes and reading about cool ideas in the literary community then this is the place for you!! If you have your own hot take to add to this column, do not hesitate to contact us.
In the literary world, there is a phenomenon which I like to call “the random spooky ending” in which an author decides suddenly that their novel should be supernatural and chooses to just shove that magic little something in randomly at the end. I simultaneously love this and absolutely despise it as it has the potential to bring out so much creativity but sadly often feels like a cop-out. Enter one of my recent reads: “Mona” by Pola Oloixarac. 
“Mona” takes place at a snobby literary conference in Sweden which will announce the Basske-Wortz, described as “the most important literary award in Europe.” Ostensibly, the novel focuses on its titular character, Mona, a physically and emotionally traumatized Peruvian writer nominated for the award, and her struggle with problems of identity, substance abuse, self-destruction, general mental health, and manipulation. 
This novel had such potential for a nuanced take on various facets of the literary world focused on a cast of deceptive and unlikable characters who reflect a variety of truths. Writer Rob Doyle put it best: “It’s a shame that Mona is not both more fleshed out and tightly focused. In a literary culture swamped by clenched, worthy fiction and the writer as activist, her satirist’s misanthropy and taste for provocation are a tonic.”
While this novel begins to unpack the lit-community, it takes on a lot within just 192 pages. Still, while reading it, I had faith. I loved Mona’s biting critiques of her peers and slowly uncovering her traumatic past with each page turn. So, when I reached the end of the novel, I expected something, anything, that would make a final statement on Mona’s character or even on the future of the lit-world. Instead, I was met with a sudden and out-of-place ending which appealed to Nordic mythology by conjuring a monster from a neighboring body of water that destroys the entire world. Every. Single. Character. Gone.
Now, I did not hate this ending. Looking back, it is a fascinating take on what weight stories and people truly have as life is so volatile. However, because it is just thrown in at the end and feels so jarring to read after spending most of the novel on a more realistic plane, it misses the mark. 
This is the problem I have with “the random spooky ending”: Often, these endings have the potential to do so much — to say something fascinating about the world of the novel they inhabit (something I would like to believe the author intends to communicate), but because of the shift in tone and in the reality, the reader gets too confused and caught up in the change to actually grasp it. It took a while after I read “Mona” to truly appreciate and understand the ending, and it made me frustrated because I really did enjoy reading this book. 
There is certainly a place for surprise magic and “the random spooky ending,” and I am sure there are books out there that utilize the technique beautifully. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. I love supernatural elements in novels and the idea of crossing and blurring genre lines — which is why I want to love “the random spooky ending.” However, I think the key to making this a technique which more readers, like myself, can appreciate is to not just leave the reader hanging. You can surprise us, but don’t expect shock to do the work of communicating what it is you want to say about the world. It is an author’s duty to work to communicate, and when “the random spooky ending” leaves the reader to do the heavy lifting, the novel ends up falling short.

After coming to the United States for the eighth time, I thought the feeling of displacement would be minimal. However, I was still unnerved by the new form of reality that persisted after the pandemic.
From my parents to my friends’ parents, everyone who knew that I was going to university in the States kept “educating” me on the importance of safety and how I should try to minimize time of going out by myself and to always stay alert on the streets — words that I rarely heard even when I left home to go to a boarding school in another city in China. I wanted to say that their understanding of life in the U.S. was only a misconception, but I could not seem to find the courage to convince them as even I was further dissuaded from coming. 
When you scroll through Chinese social media, there are increasingly more negative comments about the West, especially targeting America. We see not only comments and criticism about America’s diplomacy but more importantly, the increasing number of reports of mass shootings, violent crime, and anti-Asian hate crimes. Needless to say, some of the content was published under the influence of the post-pandemic world. But as the number of the incidents grew, more reports were issued in both the Western media and later in the Chinese media. As a result, the Chinese public started to respond more vigorously and negatively to such incidents. When all this information is pieced together, this image of America as an incubator of bloodbath emerges, infiltrating our minds and constructing an unrealistic reality that is worshiped by a number of the Chinese public.
Being someone who grew up in a culture and country that doesn’t promote or protect the right of self-armament, such reality was received with horror and disbelief, stoking much fear amongst the Chinese students traveling to study in the States. We are unaccustomed to such forms of reality, visibly seeing people carry arms even if it was for the purpose of self-defense (I remember the shock I experienced when someone recommended buying a taser off Amazon so I could be less worried when walking the streets after dark). We don’t know how to react to the news of other incidents like those on the New York City Subway. In our eyes, we feel that such incidents are much closer to us than we expected, however far away they might really be. 
More importantly, perhaps, we don’t know how to assess the information. As most international students have not lived in the States, we face great information asymmetry when we see these reports especially in Western media. From easily misleading statistics to attention-grabbing (possibly inflammatory) titles such as “Anti-Asian hate crimes increased 339 percent nationwide last year, report says”, our understanding of the world in the West and the States have been distracted from the reality. 
We assume that we will experience stronger feelings of othering and stares of more pairs of hostile, judgmental eyes because we are the targeted. The news stories call for us to unite against this new prevailing discrimination when in actuality we are further discouraged from discussing this with others in our position, because we don’t want to hold onto our identity of the “othered.” 
In our time where media often profits from and preys upon our fears and insecurities, what can we use as our looking glass to see the truth of the society?

(Disclaimer: Spoilers, naturally.)  
As autumn-time breaks, leaves fall, and the chill turns our ears and cheeks red, there is a shift in our true nature. The dark grows longer, the sun sleeps earlier, the clouds hang lower, snuffing out the blue sky. It is about now that time slips us into a state of obsession for the ominous and the bizarre — the petrifying and the macabre. Perhaps it is the dismal and melancholy death of the trees — symbolic providers of our life’s breath — that begin our descent into an obsession with art that spotlights blood-curdling screams and stalking killers silhouetted in moonlit forests of fog. We devour this art, but is it right to do so?
It must come into everyone's mind at least once whether the ethics of what we are consuming should be questioned, and that goes for all art. We should consider the way any content effects us, and it would be wrong to suggest that there are none. Horror is no different, and conceivably, we should use this time as a chance to learn about ourselves and perhaps, even more, examine our relationship with the people who develop horror.
There is a reason why our parents never wanted us to watch modern horror movies (beyond the fact that they can be terrifying); it is because of the belief that this art impacts people. It is no secret that violent imagery and horror tropes can change moods and emotions, which in turn can ultimately affect how people act. Although it may be our wish to watch horror in spite of our seniors, there is some reasoning that we should at least consider.
It shouldn’t be too far-fetched to say that horror, and more specifically, its brutality and intense violence, does have consequences on its viewers. This is not a referendum on anyone who falls into watching bloodbath-heavy films, or listens to “death-heavy screaming metal music.” All I ask is that people question the duality of such subjects with the rest of our lives. It’s not a sick or disturbed person who watches horror films, considering that tens of millions of people who live relatively normal lives enjoy these entertainments, but there is a desensitizing effect that I believe we should question within the context of our society.
The horror genre throughout history, even beyond film, is an interesting topic, as it tells us about ourselves. Horror, in whatever contemporary era that it was conceived, typically demonstrates what that current society feared. Books like Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein” and Robert Louis Stevenson’s “The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,” took the public by storm, warning that unethical and overwhelming technological innovations could devastate society or poison humanity by violating the traditional ideas of morality.
The 1940s was a decade filled with radioactive giant monsters and foreign invaders from space, the products of fresh wounds from the World Wars, with films like “Them!” or “It Came From Outer Space” telling how humanity was in jeopardy by the possibility of total nuclear annihilation, or figurative “aliens” coming into our Earth and embedding a rottenness into our culture, clearly based on the spheres of influence wars we had with the Eastern bloc.
Up until the 1990s, seemingly all horror could be chalked up to either foreign forces, the supernatural, an impossible-to-understand brute, or a combination of these. That’s why perhaps the most influential film of the genre, even still today, was Wes Craven’s “Scream” (1996). “Scream” was the first major horror film to make the killers not some stalking force in the woods, but kids in high school, going around murdering other kids. They don’t do it for any motive greater than their own pleasure. It is a fear of the elders to see their children revolt into people who see life expendable — as nothing more than a game without rules or responsibility — and even willing to devolve into psychologically broken people. It is terrifying to think that the dangers of death are not things that bump in the dark or lurk outside your home, but instead are sleeping within your own walls, under your own roof, and are the products of a corrupt world that you have no idea how to control.
In 2022, we are in another era of fears. We see it in our horror movies, with cyber technology and commodities being used against people. It makes us think about how long we have until we are no longer individuals but puppets or a meaningless number in an algorithm, fearing if any of our ideas are really our own. Horror is not a bad genre, by any means. Its existence is very appealing to our primal and animalistic tendencies. It is, however, not free from criticism. Perhaps its biggest criticism is its earned reputation with exploitation.
As a method through which to tell a story, horror earns its validity by commenting on society. Often, horror demonstrates the darkness that exists within ourselves. Just as often however — and this is probably the impression that many people get from the genre as a whole — it is an exploitative and disgustingly juvenile form of obscenity which uses cheap gimmicks and immoral titillation to sucker in viewers. Horror is the cheapest, the most violent, one of the most swear heavy, and the most nudity-showing genres of film. With such facts one begins to hold skepticism of horror as a whole, and rightly so.
I’ve come to the conclusion that we must deal with this duality of interests with a certain mindset. It is the mindset that we should see these artworks from the perspective of the person who is making them, and interrogate what they want to show us. If a creator who is making anything brutal — horror or not — is doing so without malice, we should try to listen what the creator has to say 
A probable interjection to this principle might be that one should see the art itself and only examine the qualities of its message. The reason I disagree with this principle is that even if a piece of art has a “good” message, the creator may still be creating the art with evil intent. Some fine examples of this are two horror films which I’ve come to absolutely abhor with every fiber of my being: Wes Craven’s “The Last House on the Left” (1972) and Meir Zarchi’s “I Spit on Your Grave” (1978). Both of these films sing a similar tune, centering around the topic of people who have been wronged by the world getting revenge on those who commit disgusting acts, a topic which is tried-and-true, and often leads to some greater understanding of emotions and justice.
These films, however, execute this topic so terribly, it makes one sick. “The Last House on the Left” has a disgustingly long assault scene against a 17-year-old girl by a group of terrible people, intercut with slapstick comedy that tries to draw some titillation from the audience. It’s clear that the average viewer of this film does not go to see a revenge story but sees it because they want to see this poor woman suffer, despite what the end consequence of it all is. “I Spit On Your Grave” has a similar scene, a ceaseless perversion of a woman by a group of men, which doesn’t cut away or give a chance to the audience to breathe, but wishes to disgust and pervert all normal rules of decency. Both of these films are, by all ways films can be, obscenity to the highest degree. No matter what message these films and those similar to them leave us with, they are inexcusable with what they contain. These are films created with malice in mind, and seek only to mentally maneuver the audience with all senses they can manipulate. Good-hearted films do not do this to people. It is from this which we should learn to discern what is made with a good heart and what is not.
Ultimately, I cannot tell you what explicitly makes a film have a good heart. It is not something which is checked off a list, but is embedded into the fabric from which the film is cut. It should be a lesson for everyone to be wary of where the hearts of these filmmakers lie, and to be careful not to lose yourself in the malicious. Some might find their boundaries for what is good-intentioned to be much tighter than others, but it is ultimately something which one should have, no matter where it lies. Look within yourselves to find it, and have a wonderful Halloween.

Call me a pessimist, but when I walked by the Cohon University Center on Monday, the sight of that "autonomous vehicle" display made me weep for the future. At that moment, I had no greater desire than to have had the foresight to put a sledgehammer in my bag that morning so I could cause several thousand dollars worth of property damage to those cars. It filled me with incalculable fury. 
Now I know it might be poor form to position myself as being smarter than everyone reading this, but the truth is, I actually am. You Elon Musk-stans and aspiring autonomous vehicle developers might think you're clever and innovative, but you're falling for the same lie that our boomer grandparents fell for. Cars are not the future; they have always been a regressive and horribly inefficient mode of transportation. To accept car-dependency as just "the ways things are” is a symptom of egregious lack of imagination. Do you know what the future really should be? Compact, walkable cities built around pedestrians, cyclists, and light rail. Not only does this mode of design have a dramatically lower carbon footprint, reduce the cost of maintaining infrastructure, and reduce the energy needed to heat homes, but it also creates an urban environment that doesn't crush your soul. Autonomous vehicles are a desperate bid by a doomed industry to wring every last cent of profit out of a population trapped by highways and strip malls before climate change forces us to adapt.
Now I can already hear you saying, "but I'm from a small town" or "I'm from the suburbs", probably followed by some ridiculous retort like "not everywhere is within walking distance!!" First of all, please pipe down, this is not your time to speak. Second, it actually used to be pretty common for small towns to have a single streetcar line to enhance mobility across their main commercial district. Brainerd, Minnesota, a town of 14,000, used to have one, as did my home town of 40,000. Los Angeles, known for its insufferable traffic, used to have a streetcar network, as did Pittsburgh. But we decided to rip out these high-volume public transit networks because we believed that everyone should have a car. The modern pattern of urban development is nothing more than an experiment, which took deliberate efforts by policymakers to make. We have the power to change it back.
Now perhaps I'm being unfair. Autonomous vehicles will have their place, even in my commie utopia of greenspaces and protected bike lanes. A car can offer legitimate freedom, and in sparsely populated areas it's a necessity. But I believe people should also have the freedom not to need a car. All I want is for autonomous vehicles to occupy less space in our vision of the future.

A new Taylor Swift album has just dropped, and so returns Taylor Swift talk. The college student, only behind the former gifted kid-millennial in Swiftian adoration (mostly of Taylor, not Gulliver), has found it satisfactory at a minimum, but it has not — as of yet — inspired my involvement in bus arguments with drunk Pitties like the release of “Red (Taylor’s Version)” did last year. Interestingly, there does seem to be a contingent of hate for this “Midnights.” More specifically, hate for one Jack Antonoff. Antonoff is a pop sensation who went from performing in the band Fun, to producing a large quantity of primarily female pop stars’ albums. If you liked Lorde’s “Melodrama,” Lana del Ray’s “Norman Fucking Rockwell,” or Taylor Swift’s “Lover,” he was there for you. He’s also a singer-songwriter in his own right, and may also be in the Anthony Weiner Society of Humans that Indirectly Elected Trump through his former long term relationship with actress Lena Dunham. 
McKinsey & Company, more commonly referred to as simply McKinsey, is a 96-year-old management consulting firm founded by the eponymous James McKinsey. As their website says, among other things, they “partner with clients to help them innovate more sustainably, achieve lasting gains in performance, and build workforces that will thrive for this generation and the next.” In simple, non-buzzwordy terms, they offer solutions to their clients. Similar to Antonoff, they provide advice and means to action for those seeking it.
McKinsey is the Jack Antonoff of management. The company has a yearly revenue of over $10 billion, and worked with such prestigious clients as Enron, Purdue Pharma, and ICE, among other clients of varying levels of extreme evil. They reportedly helped the Saudi government identify dissidents, encouraged banks to securitize mortgage assets in the lead-up to the 2008 financial crisis, and nearly bankrupted SwissAir. Obviously, this is a firm that does not mess around.  
But what cause do I have to invite comparison between them and a simple music producer? Well, some will read up to here and think, indignantly, “How dare he compare such an evil firm to a simple musician?” And others, disturbed, “How dare he compare such an evil man to such a competent consulting firm?” Cribbing a strategy used by the best of the New York Post, Washington Post, Daily Mail, and other tabloids, I will be supplementing this article with a few cherry picked tweets to demonstrate this supposed anti-Antonoff animosity, and you’ll just have to believe me.
Jill Krajewski writes “Jack Antonoff dulls the edges of every pop star he produces and must be stopped.”
Nina Corcoran writes “Please, artists, I'm begging you to hire anyone but Jack Antonoff to produce your album.” Some news publications of various levels of credibility even got in on the fun, from the real news media source The Atlantic, to the once great Vice News, to the Gawker offshoot’s offshoot Defector. All articles about the senseless hate poor Antonoff faces, and the two lesser media articles about Caleb Gamman’s video showcasing that he is “...able to instantly detect if Jack Antonoff worked on a song due to a visceral hatred of his production style.” Hell, I’m sure some people find it entertaining.
The chief complaints seem to be that he “homogenizes” the pop girls’ sound, and that he’s the reason Lorde’s “Solar Power” sucked, “Lover” sucked, “Midnights” sucked, etc… Obviously, this is completely ridiculous. It’s not like he’s Phil Spector, the production demon that homogenized everyone's sound and imprisoned his wife and threatened to hire a hitman to kill her and literally killed Lana Clarkson in real life. Antonoff is just a great guy that likes making music with his friends, and by all accounts works with them to preserve their vision, acting as a shield against criticism. In the same way, McKinsey is just a consulting firm that often works with terrible groups, giving them legitimacy for whatever harebrained evil schemes they want to do, and serving as some sort of weaponry deflecting against criticism. Let’s be completely honest here, banks were doing, and were going to continue to do, extremely shady things in the mortgage business with or without the involvement of McKinsey. These types of companies, in the long run, end up with high people in high-level positions that have previous relationships with McKinsey (being founded by a former McKinsey-ite in Enron’s case), and are under no obligation to do what McKinsey recommends. Acting on the often incredibly obvious advice that the firm gives is purely the company's choice.
Similarly, the artists which consult with Antonoff also have a choice and choose to incorporate his vision into their own. I would be remiss not to mention the only positive article to have been and ever will be written on Antonoff, The New Yorker’s Andrew Marantz’s “Jack Antonoff’s Gift for Pop-Music Collaboration.” Here we actually learn how, and why, Jacky A. does what he does. To force those interested to read the article, I won’t spoon feed quotes to regurgitate to the metaphorical baby birds that make up my audience. Just know that Antonoff is a really nice guy and great producer, according to all who have worked with him. The article explores this with interviews, biography, and a professional writing tone.
It may sound like that article is sooo good. But unlike mine, the New Yorker article doesn’t tortuously compare a pop producer with a consulting firm, and then highlight the absurdity of this comparison as if it makes the article more sensical. Antonoff, like McKinsey, is loved and hated by many. Companies still seek McKinsey’s advice, just as the pop stars of today do for Antonoff. So who is truly the Mastermind?

In the Oct. 3, 2022 issue of The Tartan, Forum published an article by Andrew Salzman titled “Giorgia Meloni and the Media,” which discussed Giorgia Meloni’s recent electoral victory in Italy and its subsequent media portrayal. Salzman claims that Giorgia Meloni is not a facsist. He argues the media has unfairly characterized Meloni by using “malapropisms” such as “fascist,” “far-right,” and “extremist” (confusingly, the context of Salzman’s argument suggests purposeful usage of such words by the media, but this is not the definition of a malapropism whatsoever). He accuses mainstream media outlets, who he labels as “left-wing,” of purposefully ignoring context and evidence to promote a political agenda. 
According to Salzman, the “evidence supports that Meloni does not fit the bill [for fascism],” instead claiming she has “traditional values,” espouses moderate views, and mostly promotes center-right policies. But Salzman provides neither evidence nor much of that context he yearns for. So I took the liberty of finding the evidence and providing the context for him.
Let us begin at the most obvious: Meloni’s direct roots with fascism. It is an undeniable fact that Meloni and her party descend from a fascist lineage. In 1946, remnants of Mussolini’s Republican Fascist Party formed the Italian Social Movement (MSI), becoming Mussolini’s de facto successor. After MSI came the National Alliance (NA), where Meloni’s political career began as a youth activist before forming the Brothers of Italy (FdI) in 2012. 
Meloni has created distance from this history by marketing herself as conservative, not fascist. But contrary to her statements, Meloni has continued to cling to this fascist legacy. She has publicly praised Benito Mussolini and celebrates her fascist past by bearing MSI’s old logo, known as the tri-color flame, as FdI’s emblem. Salzman insists comparisons to Mussolini for Meloni’s use of “God, Homeland, and Family” as her slogan are outrageous. But Meloni is in fact reviving Mussolini’s own slogan and critics point to what this callback signals to people.
Salzman does not explore this context; instead, he acknowledges and then sweeps her fascist connections under the rug, implying their irrelevance by suggesting Italy’s complex political history is something Americans faintly understand. However, it is a reach to suppose that these things are unrelated or coincidence, that Meloni’s adoption of fascist aesthetics occurs irrespective of her politics. Furthermore, evidence of Meloni’s fascism extends beyond her adherence to her fascist legacy. 
Giorgia Meloni’s political messaging, her policies, and the underlying political ideology all reveal her fascism. Central to Giorgia Meloni’s platform is what she describes as “the defense of national Italian identity.” She positions this identity as under threat from an ill-defined enemy who seeks to “destroy everything that defines [Italians].” For Meloni, what defines Italians refers to the “Christian values” core to this identity: the centrality of the heteronormative nuclear family made up of man, woman, and child; typical sexual practices including heterosexuality; patriarchal gender norms; etc. Meloni does not really define these terms, but their meaning is already a given for her conservative base. Her rhetoric is intended to address Italy’s privileged classes discreetly, conveying her message without any explicit mention of beliefs or policies that might incite opposition. We commonly refer to such a rhetorical technique as a dog-whistle.
So, by “national Italian identity” and “Christian values,” Meloni actually means an ethno-nationalist identity that privileges Italy’s already dominant group to the exclusion of all others and a system of values historically favored by the powerful.
Perhaps some of this sounds familiar to you. If you recall your history lessons, you might recognize Meloni is employing fascist techniques. As Yale Professor Jason Stanley, who specializes in rhetoric and propaganda, explains, “In the past, fascist politics would focus on the dominant cultural group. The goal is to make them feel like victims, to make them feel like they’ve lost something and that [it] has been taken from them by a specific enemy, usually some minority out-group or some opposing nation.” Meloni operates exactly as Stanley describes, and her politics subsequently revolves around protecting this ethno-nationalist identity from cultural extermination by an external enemy.
Meloni’s particular brand of enemy is who she describes as the globalist left: a coalition of international powers orchestrating “a project of ethnic substitution” against Italians in cooperation with non-white immigrants, minority groups, and any other external groups. 
Her “ethnic substitution” theory believes in a plan to gain power by replacing white Italians through immigration and eroding (white) Italian culture.
Shockingly (or, rather, not really), this narrative has roots in neo-fascist ideas and white supremacist conspiracy theories. Meloni has built her political career rallying against these so-called “globalists” and “financial speculators” but her rhetoric draws links to the New World Order theory — the idea that a secret cabal of global elites are trying to enslave humanity through covert control of the world. 
She explicitly uses the terms globalist and financial speculators, antisemitic terms associated with the theory She also frequently refers to George Soros, a Jewish-American financier, as a globalist; in conspiracy circles, Soros is famous as a secret global mastermind. She is quoted elsewhere saying, “when you've no roots you’re a slave, and when you're a slave, you serve Soros' interests,” alluding to the theory’s idea of global enslavement. Likewise, Meloni’s “ethnic substitution” theme draws directly from The Great Replacement conspiracy theory, which posits that native white populations are being replaced to seize power and spark a “white genocide.” The theory is strongly linked to many of the most violent and terrible acts of white nationalist terrorism recently, including the Pittsburgh Tree of Life shooting and Unite the Right rally. Conservatives have increasingly mainstreamed the theory, but the ties to far-right extremism and fascism remain undeniable. 
Thus, Giorgia Meloni’s “ethnic substitution” message is a fascist narrative derived from racist, xenophobic, and antisemitic ideas that find their origin in conspiracy theories crafted by far-right ultranationalist white supremacists — a.k.a. fascists. So when Salzman refers to her “strict” policies against so-called “illegal immigrants,” policies such as denying immigrant children birthright citizenship and prioritizing Italians over immigrants for social services, he is referring to an anti-immigrant position informed by fascist ideas. That is the context. 
To further understand the deeply rooted fascism of Meloni’s politics, we can look to the rest of her policy platform. For example, a major theme in Meloni and her party’s politics is the emphasis on and essentializing of motherhood. Even in Meloni’s political persona, she specifically centers her motherhood rather than her womanhood. 
Her party also promotes that a major function of government is to raise the birth rate so as to prevent the “extermination of Italians” (more ethnic substitution). Likewise, the party has advocated for welfare spending linked solely to motherhood and child care while also rejecting a minimum wage or welfare benefits for those seeking employment, to the detriment of women living in precarity. On abortion, legal in Italy since 1978, the FdI have again prioritized motherhood over women’s bodily autonomy, restricting access to abortion services, financing anti-abortion efforts with public funds, and has even required those seeking an abortion to first consult with anti-abortion groups. Importantly, this obsession parallels Benito Mussolini’s own obsession with birth rate and motherhood in his Battle of Births program, which restricted reproductive healthcare, offered financial incentives, and enforced traditional gender norms to prevent the decline of the white race.
Meloni’s other policy positions include her strong opposition to the so-called “LGBT lobby,” which involves banning gay adoption (on the basis that “what is best [for a child] is having a father and a mother,” despite herself being raised without a father and asserting she was raised well), opposing gay marriage, and has also calling for a ban on sex education. 
Yet, conservatives still claim that criticisms against Meloni, especially her positions on women’s rights, are actually sexist. Unfortunately, all this really does is reveal, at best, the utterly pitiful understanding of feminism by conservatives or, at worst, their willful misunderstanding for political ends. These critiques are based on her ideology, not her gender, and to insist she is feminist given her policies is laughable. Meloni’s conflation of motherhood with the advancement of women’s rights merely asserts that being free means being a mother — the total opposite of liberation from gender roles. At the barest minimum, you can not lay claim to the identity of feminism when your actual policies and rhetoric diminish the economic, bodily, social, and cultural autonomy of women — such actions are anathema to feminist principles. 
You might be noticing the pattern, but these policies and positions also parallel fascist history. Fascist Italy, too, condemned and criminalized homosexuality, pornography, birth control, contraceptives, and prostitution (although enforcement was sporadic). Nazi Germany was much the same, for instance, criminalizing the abortion of pure “Aryan” babies, exalting motherhood, and being strong proponents of draconian gay conversion therapy.
Meloni and earlier fascists built policies with the goal of preserving their traditional values. But why the obsession with traditional values? According to Meloni, these traditional Christian values “founded our civilization.” Meloni sees her beliefs as justified because she views her values as the ideological foundation of civilization. Alright everyone, time to check your bingo cards because, once again, Meloni is engaging in another defining feature of fascism: the making of an origin story, “the myth of decadence and rebirth.” 
Recall, fascists gain power by convincing supporters they have lost something and in fascist mythology, the past is lost. The mythology’s function is two-fold: First, fascist use the history of “Western Civilization” as evidence of their racial and cultural supremacy, constructing a moral justification for seizing power. Both the construction of fascism’s ethnonationalist identity and system of values is based in this historical narrative. Secondly, this idealized past is contrasted with the declining modern age such that modern problems are explained as a divergence from this past. The proffered solution then is to reclaim the past by preserving traditional culture and its values against fascism’s enemy. 
Fascist ideology is built on this mythology: a narrative that aggrandizes a lost past and calls for its reclamation from the jaws of modernity. But this mythology is based on a Eurocentric and racialized conception of history that is totally inaccurate. The Western civilization theory and derivative fascist myths are built on such a biased and selective retelling of history as to be total fiction. It completely disregards how human civilizations flourished beyond Europe and Western norms, while completely omitting how political, economic, cultural, and intellectual exchange between these civilizations occurred for a millennium. Thus, fascist political ideology has no leg to stand on and, by extension, Meloni’s ideology is untenable. 
We should acknowledge that all of this boils down to power. The Western civilization narrative was invented by eighteenth and nineteenth century thinkers intent on protecting existing power structures — ones built atop the exploitation and oppression of peoples considered “different” from the ruling classes. Fascism, likewise, is an ideology that favors the privileged by leveraging these very same mechanisms and power structures. Salzman insists Meloni is a moderate conservative who simply supports traditional values, but these values are derived from a historical fascist narratives intended to privilege the powerful. That is the context Salzman sought. 
Salzman claimed the evidence redeems Meloni, but it actually reveals the deeply rooted connections between Meloni’s politics and fascist ideology. Meloni claims she is not fascist, and Salzman treats this as evidence enough that she really is not. But I am not interested in listening to Salzman’s suggestion that we should simply take her at her word. Meloni’s own words and actions consistently contradict any disavowal of fascism. She has continuously participated in fascist circles, promoted fascist ideas, used fascist techniques, evoked fascist conspiracy theories, and built her politics on fascist ideology. She has followed the fascist playbook point by point. In light of this evidence, it begs the question when exactly does the title fascist become acceptable? I’m inclined to say she deserves the title — she is a fascist.
Salzman argues a parliamentary coalition will reign her in, forcing her to moderate her views (despite claiming she is not an extremist…). This is naively optimistic. At most, it will moderate her policies, but the FdI has a strong advantage given Meloni’s allies performed poorly. Meloni may adopt a moderate policy approach as part of an electability strategy, but she might not necessarily have to given her current electoral success. Plus, do not forget fascists already have precedent for taking political power democratically and moderate coalitions failed to restrict them but rather aided them. Personally, I have no interest in waiting to find out whether Meloni will faithfully respect democratic processes before deciding on the fascist label.
It also poses no surprise when moderate conservatives line up to defend Meloni given American and European conservatives have been trafficking fascist ideas for a while, emboldening the far-right’s most violent and militant elements. In truth, our political center is careening towards the far-right even if this goes against the majority’s political beliefs. This is why I find it hard to take serious conservatives’ cries about media bias or tech censorship. They are simply indulging in a victim fantasy and desiring freedom from social consequences for bigotry. That ostensibly center-right conservatives resonate with Meloni’s messaging and policy does less to discredit accusations against her and more to indict mainstream conservative politics. When the basis of your argument amounts to “She can’t be fascist because I agree with her points and I’m not a fascist,” it is time to do some serious self-reflection. 
Honestly, at the end of the day, I don’t really care about this argument on whether Giorgia Meloni is fascist or not. While the evidence, in my opinion, pretty clearly points to Meloni operating like a fascist, what I actually care about is Meloni and her politics’s significance. 
Meloni, like Mussolini and Hitler, is a fear-monger who plays into the peoples’ anxieties and worries, seizing on their fear as a vehicle for political power. She stokes public discontent into animosity and directs it, like a tightly-drawn arrow, at the most vulnerable: the poor, immigrants, minority communities, the Jewish people, and many others. She facilitates the continued normalization of fascism, which increases the chances of Europe violently descending into terror again. Her policies are violent, harmful, and ultimately will not help Italy. Regardless of label, Giorgia Meloni is morally bankrupt and a danger to Italy, Europe, and the world-at-large.
That is what actually matters.
