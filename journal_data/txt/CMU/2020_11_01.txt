On October 15, Big Hit Entertainment raised 963 billion won ($843 million) in South Korea’s largest IPO since 2017. Their stock price opened at 270,000 won ($236), more than double their IPO price of 135,000 won ($118) and closed at 258,000 won ($225). Their day-one market cap sat at a hefty $7.6 billion, making founder Bang Si-hyuk South Korea’s newest billionaire.
Interestingly enough, even after the pre-listing hype eased and with the steady decline of the stock price, Big Hit’s stock price has never dipped below the IPO price of 135,000 won. As of October 30, the stock is valued at 142,000 won, with analysts saying this price is “more reasonable and based on the fundamentals of a company which relies heavily on” one group for revenue.
Indeed, Big Hit’s success can be mainly attributed to K-pop superstars BTS and their enormous fanbase, officially termed the BTS A.R.M.Y. Since their debut in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment, BTS has performed sold-out shows around the world and broken numerous Billboard chart records. With their Love Yourself: Tear album in 2018, they became the first Korean group to top the Billboard 200. They repeated the feat with Love Yourself: Answer and Map of the Soul: Persona, which was the best-selling Korean album of all time until BTS beat their own record with 2020’s Map of the Soul: 7. Similarly, on October 12, BTS’s remix of “Savage Love (Laxed -- Siren Beat)” has even beaten out their own recent all-English single, “Dynamite”, for the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100.
In 2019, BTS sold 6.21 million albums, while SEVENTEEN, the next most popular group under Big Hit, sold 1.45 million. In 2020, BTS sold 4.26 million copies of Map of the Soul: 7, while SEVENTEEN sold 1.2 million copies of their seventh mini album. It comes as no surprise, then, that BTS accounted for 87.7 percent of Big Hit’s revenue for the first half of 2020, and 97.4 percent of Big Hit’s 2019 revenue.
According to a September regulatory filing, the seven members of popular boy band BTS received 478,695 shares in the company in August 2020 “to strengthen long-term partnership with major artists and boost morale”; indeed, now that the members of BTS are shareholders, Big Hit has essentially eliminated any uncertainty regarding future contract negotiations with the group. With the IPO, BTS has earned $15.4 million. In the music industry, this is actually a rarity -- never have industry giants like Universal, Sony, or Warner given stocks to their artists. This transfer of equity is almost exclusively reserved for the likes of early startups, like Kobalt or Elektra, and it could very well change the industry paradigm.
A looming issue for the group, however, is South Korea’s mandatory 18-month military service for men: the oldest member of the group (at 27 years old) must report for duty by the end of next year, and none of the other members have completed their military service, either.  Some have speculated that Big Hit will “either set up units with the remaining members or pursue solo acts while they serve in the military.” Others are confident in the fan base: collaborations with LINE FRIENDS, Samsung, Hyundai, and Starbucks, for example, have already generated enormous economic value for the company.
Presumably to reduce their dependence on BTS, Big Hit has been working steadily to vertically integrate the most profitable services, like online concert platforms. They have recently hired 100 IT personnel from companies like Naver and Kakao, and they have recruited IT veterans to the executive level. They are still recruiting in fields such as app development and management and game development. Already, they have been quite successful with their “Weverse” e-commerce and social media platform, which has allowed Big Hit to expand beyond music management. Sales of digital content have already more than made up for BTS’s cancelled sold-out world tour through the 22 billion won raised from ticket sales for Big Hit’s self-produced concert in June 2020.

While October is typically filled with Halloween costume sales, decorations, and parties, this year one of the world’s scariest monsters has transcended his costume form and attacked the real world. His name? COVID-19. Halloween is one of the most beloved and widely celebrated holidays, across the United States and even internationally. Kids love dressing up to trick-or-treat, while older teenagers and adults often showcase their favorite costumes at Halloween parties. Amid a worldwide pandemic, however, it remains unlikely that children will be able to go door-to-door picking up candy, and even more unlikely that any form of Halloween partying will be allowed. Therefore, the question remains: What is the fate of a mid-pandemic Halloween?
Should You Celebrate Halloween This Year?
According to the official CDC website, the answer is a strong no. The National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases explains, “any traditional Halloween activities can be high-risk for spreading viruses… If you may have COVID-19 or you may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, you should not participate in in-person Halloween festivities and should not give out candy to trick-or-treaters.” As colleges across the United States opened up with social distancing measures this August, the media is looking specifically to college students to see whether or not partying will occur. Halloween’s notorious reputation for attracting partying could yield serious problems for the spread of coronavirus. Instead, the CDC notes, “there are several safer, alternative ways to participate in Halloween.”
How To Celebrate Safely
The traditional door-to-door candy grabbing will likely not happen in any part of the United States this year. According to an annual survey by the National Retail Federation, “Over 148 million U.S. adults intend to take part in Halloween-related activities this year... That's down from the 172 million in the 2019 survey. And those planning to celebrate by trick or treating this year dropped to 23% from 29% in 2019.” While the numbers of in-person celebrators have declined, Americans are still looking for ways to celebrate the holiday. Celebrating on Zoom, doing virtual Instagram challenges, wearing masks to social distance with friends, and watching Halloween movies are all great ways to celebrate during these unprecedented times. 
What are CMU’s Plans for A Safe and Fun Halloween?
Whether you’re an in-person student living on campus or a remote student living at home, Carnegie Mellon is dedicated to creating a Halloween experience for its students. Student organizations such as the Dietrich First Year Council are hosting Halloween Instagram challenges. Hunt Library even has spooky-themed books available for students to pick up or read online.
There are many ways to have a fun Halloween despite the COVID-19 pandemic. While you may not be able to trick-or-treat, you can still find something good to eat. So remember to come as you aren’t, beware of the scares, and let the ghoul times roll.

As the campus community lurches past the midway mark of the semester, the university is poised to keep to its COVID-19 plans and protocols. With the exception of the recently announced delayed start of the Spring semester, the university is sticking with their previously laid plans to close campus after Thanksgiving break, transition to all remote classes, use asymptomatic sample testing, and maintain the current grading system.
Instead of letting students back on campus after an expected period of Thanksgiving-related risk, the university announced in June that classes will switch to all-remote teaching after Nov. 25. On-campus research is permitted and those living on-campus will be able to continue to do so, but the hybrid teaching model is set to end for the semester with the start of Thanksgiving break. According to a statement sent to The Tartan by Carnegie Mellon spokesperson Jason Maderer, the university has “been preparing for this transition all semester.” The Eberly Center has provided resources for instructors throughout the semester, Maderer said, including teaching consultation services and a collection of online learning guidelines and tools. 
For students dealing with the transition, Maderer stated that “any student needing financial support or resources should contact their HUB liaisons,” referring to the HUB assistant directors that assist in student enrollment and financial aid matters. Maderer added that for tech needs, students should refer to Computing Services, and that “the Student Academic Success Center can also assist students as they prepare for the transition to fully remote learning through academic coaching and workshop resources.”
The university’s asymptomatic COVID-19 sample testing, a process designed to monitor spread of the virus among the campus community, is now seven weeks underway. In that time, there have been a total of five positive test results out of 2473 tests from Sept. 15 - Oct. 26. Asymptomatic testing has gone “very well” thus far, according to Maderer. “Students have been responsive and engaged in the process,” he said.
Fluctuations in the number tested each week can be seen on the university’s COVID dashboard. 
Maderer says this fluctuation can be chalked up to the fact that some people are choosing to not participate in on-campus activities, leading to them not making a test appointment once selected for testing, and that some community members, citing commitments, request to be tested at a future date. Still, “a majority of those invited are making appointments to be tested.”
According to an Aug. statement to The Tartan from Gina Casalegno, Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students, the university had initially secured “enough test kits to conduct approximately 1000 asymptomatic student tests per week following the completion of our arrival testing.” Instead of testing 1000 students weekly, the university has adopted a different strategy of testing five to 10 percent of students engaging in on-campus activity, as written on the old version of the Ongoing Asymptomatic Testing page of the COVID dashboard. Newer versions of the site omit the percentage of students that the university seeks to test. According to Maderer, the university “initially considered testing approximately 1000 students per week,” but he wrote, “that number was reduced because our positivity rates were low.” He added that the university is “planning for more frequent testing of the broader community,” noting that “updates will be provided once we are prepared to expand.”
Given the foreboding transition to all-remote learning amid a deadly pandemic, some students have pushed for pass/fail grading for this semester, like what was implemented last spring. Students shouldn’t expect such a grading scheme again. 
“With the opportunity faculty and students had to prepare for the upcoming semester, including additional support and resources to enable student and faculty success, we elected not to continue the pass/fail option for all courses,” Maderer stated. “We understand the pandemic has impacted each of us differently, and any student facing personal hardship or challenge is encouraged to talk with their academic advisor and/or associate dean so we can identify appropriate adjustments or accommodations and support.”

“President Trump sends his best to Carnegie Mellon,” was how National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien opened an on-the-record webinar with the Institute for Politics and Strategy (IPS) on Oct. 27. The Zoom event, held one week before the 2020 general election, was co-hosted by IPS Director Kiron Skinner and IPS Senior Fellow Richard Grenell. Seated in the White House Situation Room, O’Brien shared the President’s greetings to Skinner and Grenell, both of whom have held top diplomatic positions within the Trump Administration. 
Speaking to over a hundred virtual attendees from the Carnegie Mellon community, Ambassador O’Brien defended the foreign policy record of the vulnerable incumbent President Trump. O’Brien contrasted the President’s “peace through strength” doctrine with the “era of strategic patience” that preceded Trump’s first term in the White House. “Strategic patience” often refers to the Obama administration’s policy of gradually increasing sanctions on North Korea until it agreed to negotiations regarding its nuclear weapons program. 
In his year-long tenure at the White House, O’Brien has proven a staunch ally to Trump, even on his most controversial decisions. In December 2019, he defended the President’s decision to pardon Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher, who was charged with stabbing an injured 17-year-old ISIS prisoner to death and shooting at least two unarmed Iraqi civilians without provocation. Back in January, O’Brien claimed without evidence, that Iranian General Qassem Soleimani was conspiring to stage an attack on Americans before he was killed by an airstrike that President Trump ordered. Later, the White House released a memo that contradicted that message, stating the assassination was to “deter Iran from conducting or supporting...attacks” on the United States rather than to prevent an imminent threat.  
Throughout the webinar, Grenell and O’Brien hyped each other up about their diplomatic achievements. Grenell credited O’Brien for his work as the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs. O’Brien praised Grenell’s contribution to the establishment of normal economic relations between Kosovo and Serbia. He also noted President Trump’s close bond with Grenell, saying, “other than Ivanka [Trump], there’s no one the President more enjoys spending time with than Ric [Grenell].” In August, Grenell was tapped as LGBT adviser for the Republican National Convention and has since followed the Trump campaign at indoor ‘Trump Pride’ events in battleground states across the country. 
Grenell and O’Brien’s most recent collaboration was not discussed in the event. Under authorization from O’Brien, Grenell recently met with top Venezuelan official Jorge Rodriguez, according to sources that spoke anonymously with Bloomberg News. During this encounter outside Mexico City, Grenell allegedly sought to negotiate Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro’s swift exit from power prior to the U.S. elections. Neither Secretary of State Mike Pompeo nor the State Department Envoy to Venezuela were alerted about the trip until after its occurrence. Grenell did not immediately reply to a request for comment on that story. 
Throughout the question and answer session following O’Brien’s initial statement, Grenell, Skinner, and O’Brien extolled President Trump’s foreign policy. Both IPS faculty members claimed that the President’s policies abroad appeal to people across the political spectrum. Justifying that Trump has “left-wing” bona fides, Grenell cited Trump’s summit with Kim Jong-Un and Skinner brought up the Israeli-UAE normalization agreement. O’Brien dismissed claims that America is a declining power, boldly predicting that “this is gonna be an American century” due to our “strong military” and rising GDP. The U.S. is projected to spend around $934 billion on the military in 2020-2021, while high GDP numbers mask a devastating eviction crisis and the millions of U.S. taxpayers without health insurance who face a pandemic infecting 89,000 Americans daily. O’Brien serves on the White House Coronavirus Task Force and himself contracted the virus in July. 
Grenell recently published a piece in IPS’s Center for International Relations and Politics (CIRP) journal, entitled “The Trump Turn: Shaping the Next Decade of American Foreign Policy.” In it, he argues that the future of diplomacy lies in “remaking” the world order to “reflect U.S. national interests.” Arguing for a “balance of power” reminiscent of the Cold War era, Grenell asserts that the Trump administration has sought “to reshape a more stable and favorable global system” by embracing competition and rejecting broad international cooperation. Grenell’s views complement those of Skinner, the head of IPS who once described U.S.-China relations as a “fight with a really different civilization” while serving as Policy Planning Director at the State Department. Their nationalistic perspectives represent the core of Trump’s “America First” foreign policy.

This upcoming Tuesday marks the end of a campaign season that began long before this tumultuous year. It may have slipped your mind that there is anything on the ballot other than the presidential race this year, but there certainly is. For those students registered in Pittsburgh who haven’t voted early this year, no fear: The Tartan has a guide for what contested races you might see on your ballot besides the presidential election. 
This year, Carnegie Mellon’s Wiegand Gym is open as a polling location for those who have registered with their on-campus SMC address. You can also visit Votes PA to find your polling location. The following information is compiled from the voting guides of the League of Women Voters and The Incline, whose guides we encourage you to check out as well. 
Pennsylvania House District 23: 
Dan Frankel, Democratic Party
https://votedanfrankel.com/
Top issues: Gun reform, protecting abortion rights, regulating gas companies, protections for LGBTQ people in the workplace. (Issues page)

Positions: Jay Ting Walker is challenging the longtime incumbent Frankel by running to his left on issues important to young voters, advocating for free state and community college tuition and a ban on fracking. 
U.S. House District 18: 
Mike Doyle, Democratic Party 
https://www.mikedoyleforcongress.com/biography/
Top issues: Protecting Obamacare, Medicare-for-All, universal background checks and banning assault weapons, “100% clean energy by the year 2050.” (Issues page)

Attorney General:
Josh Shapiro, Democratic Party
https://www.joshshapiro.org/
Top issues: “We must continue battling the heroin and opioid crisis that is taking 12 Pennsylvanians’ lives each day. Our efforts must focus on a multi-pronged approach of prosecuting high-level drug dealers, holding pharmaceutical companies accountable and making treatment more accessible and affordable. We must stand up for consumers against predatory lending companies, scammers, and others trying to take advantage of Pennsylvanians. That includes ensuring Pennsylvanians have access to affordable, quality health care. We must keep our communities safe, by collaborating effectively across law enforcement, reforming our criminal justice system to ensure equal enforcement, taking crime guns off our streets, and much more.” (League of Women Voters)
Positions: As Attorney General, Shapiro has investigated sexual abuse in the Catholic Church, investigated pharmaceutical manufacturers and secured injunctions for no-cost access to contraception. 
Heather Heidelbaugh, Republican Party
http://heatherheidelbaugh.com/about/
Top Issues: “1. Keep PA Safe-The Commonwealth Attorneys Act states one of the main roles of the AG is criminal prosecutions. This would be my top priority. The AG works with local DAs and law enforcement to keep PA residents safe, including a strong commitment to addressing drug trafficking and the opioid crisis. 2. Put People Before Politics-Restore the AG’s Office to following mandates set forth in the Commonwealth Attorneys Act and perform lawyering for the people of PA versus using the office for political gain. 3. Protect the Mentally Ill - Establish a Blue Ribbon Panel of experts from PA to examine the treatment of the mentally ill, address the current state of mental illness, and more. The panel would issue a Report suggesting structural changes.” (League of Women Voters)
Positions: Heidelbaugh has criticized Shapiro for what she sees as a national political focus for his time in office. She has proposed suing China due to the coronavirus. 
Daniel Wassmer, Libertarian Party
http://wassmer4pa.com/
Top issues: “-Major Criminal Justice Police Reform. -Decriminalize Marijuana (and other drugs) shifting to a medical treatment options (someone with a state authorized ‘license’ can sell drugs reaping a huge profit but a person selling a nickel bag of marijuana is charged with a crime - shouldn’t be!) -Stopping the threat of Anti-Trust litigation by BOTH old parties which is used simply as a ploy to leverage ‘campaign contributions’ as a form of legalized extortion against our competitive big tech firms and permitting a real ‘free market’ to pick winners and losers (Note: This is the only time in modern history where companies delivering ‘convenience’ and ‘lower prices for consumers’ have been shaken down allegedly to protect consumers [what nonsense]”  (League of Women Voters)
Positions: Wassmer has staked a firmly anti-antitrust stance, calling it a means to “shake down giant corporations.” 
Richard L. Weiss, Green Party
https://www.greenslate2020.org/attorney_general
Top issues: “1. Save the taxpayers’ money. Reduce prison population by 50%, by not seeking cash bail, not bringing charges merely for drug possession or consensual relations between adults. Only those who are actually a threat to the community should be incarcerated. Others should be diverted from the prison system to programs designed to help them pay their debt to society and reintegrate into the community. Prosecutorial resources can then be directed to addressing violent crime, combating corruption and consumer protection. 2. Reformation of the system of policing. Citizen Review Boards are only a start. Community and police must establish standards of conduct and need special prosecutors for police misconduct. 3. Promote Restorative Justice.” (League of Women Voters)
Positions: As Green Party candidate for Attorney General, Weiss sees the position as primarily concerning “public safety, with the goal of attaining peace characterized by a community that is inclusive and harmonious.”  (League of Women Voters)
Auditor General: 
Nina Ahmad, Democratic Party
https://www.ninaforpa.com/
Top Issues: “Healthcare, Education and Jobs: To reduce healthcare costs I will find efficiencies in reimbursements to pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), 3rd -party administrators of prescription drug programs. I will lead the design of an audit to assess pandemic preparedness incorporating the lessons learned from the current COVID-19 pandemic on all fronts including healthcare, education, and the economy. Developing data-driven analyses to identify funding gaps in education, I will advocate for equitable funding, universal pre-K, and affordable post-secondary education. I will harness science and technology to create family sustaining jobs of the future and will advocate for workforce development dollars to be invested in this sector.” (League of Women Voters)
Positions: Ahmad plans on using the power of the audit to cut healthcare costs by “taking on big pharma and insurers with entrenched interests.” 
Timothy DeFoor, Republican Party
https://www.defoor4pa.com/
Top Issues:  “My ﬁrst priority as Auditor General is to make sure those funds were allocated to those individuals and businesses for who they were intended. 2) Work to have a more transparent government. For example, I will work to end political loopholes like the “honor system” that allows state agencies to keep high-dollar, taxpayer funded contracts hidden from the public. 3) Bring in subject matter experts to audit the progress and performance of any new and expensive initiatives and projects to determine how and if taxpayer dollars are being spent wisely.” (League of Women Voters)
Positions: DeFoor advocates strongly for a more transparent and accountable government, working to end fraudulent activities in both the public and private sectors.
Olivia Faison, Green Party
https://www.greenslate2020.org/auditor_general
Top Issues: “1) There is a desperate need for a third party. I welcome the values that the Green Party Pillars describe - Grassroots Democracy, Ecological Wisdom, Social Justice, and Peace. (I would like to throw in Honesty and Respect). 2) Racist Laws like the Supreme Court’s Dred Scott Decision show how deep racism is ingrained in our society. Unfair laws and practices like voter suppression, purging voters off lists, and long voting lines must end. 3) Quality Education & Climate Change - Growing up, I remember the fog being so thick, you could not see down the street. Upon my return, no one can recall the last time they have seen fog hit the streets of Philly. We have lost a very important regular occurring weather pattern without anyone noticing!” (League of Women Voters)
Positions: Faison plans to use the office of the auditor general to raise awareness of climate change and support grassroots organizations.
Jennifer Moore, Libertarian Party
https://lppa.org/civicrm/profile/view/
Top Issues: “1. Transparency: How many times have you heard a fellow Pennsylvanian joke about the “temporary” Johnsontown ﬂood tax that we have been paying since 1936? How about the gas tax, or turnpike tolls that are consistently repurposed for other projects? Taxpayers deserve to know where their money is going. Funds should be spent on what they were appropriated for. 2. Covid-19 has signiﬁcantly impacted our state. Areas like education, healthcare, small business and unemployment have all been affected. It will be very important to audit the performance of related programs as well as ensuring that funds were properly allocated. 3. Combat government waste and inefﬁciency. I will work to ensure effective use of taxpayer dollars.” (League of Women Voters)
Positions: Moore plans on looking for irregularities in finances by drawing on her time in healthcare finance. 
State Treasurer:
Joseph Torsella, Democratic Party
joetorsella.com/
Top Issues: “From Day One, my most important duty has been restoring integrity to an ofﬁce too often marred by scandal: 3 of the last 5 elected Treasurers have been indicted. Upon taking ofﬁce, I immediately banned the use of middlemen to win investment contracts and introduced Treasury’s ﬁrst conﬂict-of-interest policy and Chief Integrity Ofﬁcer. My top priority now is building solutions to help Pennsylvanians recover from COVID-19 on solid ﬁnancial ground. We created the Keystone Scholars program, which gives at-birth college and career savings accounts to every child born or adopted in Pennsylvania, and we ﬁght to hold Wall Street accountable to taxpayers, as trustees for our public pension systems and through legal action when necessary.” (League of Women Voters)
Positions: Torsella's plans include automatic bank accounts for college and retirement savings in PA, as well as investing in Open Data. 
Stacy Garrity, Republican Party
https://www.garrityforpa.com/
Top Issues: Transparency for the office of the treasurer, returning unclaimed property, eliminating fees in taxpayer-funded pension systems, 529 accounts for college expenses. Issues page
Positions: Garrity has been endorsed by Trump in her run against the incumbent, Torsella. 
Timothy Runkle, Green Party
https://www.greenslate2020.org/state_treasurer
Top Issues:  "I intend to use my ofﬁce to push forward an agenda that is future focused and serves the people of Pennsylvania. Every monetary decision I make will consider how we can 1) prepare the State for a Green New Deal by investing in sustainable jobs and eliminating dirty industry handouts, 2) restructure our outdated tax code by closing corporate tax evasion loopholes and providing for equitable taxation, and 3) reform the criminal justice system by ending cash bail and reducing incarceration and recidivism.” (League of Women Voters)
Positions: Runkle looks to implement changes that increase transparency, specifically around the use of tax money. He also wants to prepare for a more sustainable future by restructuring the nation’s industry.
Joseph Soloski, Libertarian Party
https://joesoloski.com/
Top Issues:  “I will be working to influence the Governor and the Legislature to minimize taxes, and cut the costs of government wherever possible. The budget of the Commonwealth has exploded over the past 20 years and the Republicans and Democrats, who have been in power for more than 150 years, are doing little to curb the runaway growth of state government and advocate for the taxpayers of Pennsylvania.” (League of Women Voters) 
Positions: In office, Soloski plans to cut wages for legislators and push to lower corporate net income tax. 
Police review question
Voters will be asked whether or not police officers should be required to cooperate with Independent Police Review Board investigations. This measure would require police leadership to hear the board’s recommendations before making a decision on disciplinary action and allow the board to conduct performance audits. It also would give the mayor power to remove people from the board, with the potential for city council to override. This measure was unanimously supported by the members of the Pittsburgh City Council.

While the school continues to change its policies to reflect a slow, but present progress away from COVID-19, some would prefer they re-integrate early-pandemic grading policies. While the well-being of every student must be prioritized, we have to recognize that alternative grading policies are no longer feasible, or in most cases, necessary at all. Such proposals are no longer grounded by the clear and present chaos of the school’s sudden shift to online learning, and the trauma associated with the early pandemic. 
The school primarily adopted a temporary pass/fail-like grading system so students and teachers could adjust to learning that was both completely remote and completely new. To call Zoom University an uncertain and problem-ridden environment wouldn’t do it justice. As such, a pass/fail system was used to ease everyone’s sudden transitions to online instruction. Now, however, nearly all students have had at least half a year to accommodate their schoolwork, schedules, and technology to adjust to circumstances that really shouldn’t be too new or shocking to anyone at this point. 
Many schools also introduced their options for pass/fail grades to ease the shock and panic that came with being sent home during the first few months of the pandemic. Nobody could have foreseen being sent home, so the easing of worries regarding grades helped to absorb some early shocks. Now, if all classes were to switch to online-only tomorrow, most would be both familiar with and accustomed to online-instruction since the majority of classes already take place online. The hybrid model ensures all students are familiar with online learning, so a sudden transition to remote-only learning shouldn’t be shocking enough to lower grading standards for anyone who isn’t dealing with other extenuating circumstances.
The desire of many to maintain pass/fail options reflects the larger problems of dealing with the pandemic. We can either put everything on hold or accept that this is going to be the new normal, and we must move forward as though it is. When many schools first closed, they presented their closures as a sort of spring break. If nobody thought ahead and looked at the possibility that COVID-19 could be with us for years, we would not have adapted to the new normal by resuming learning, and the whole pandemic would be treated as one big spring break with everything canceled accordingly. Similarly, stores could have just closed and laid-off workers until further notice. Instead, they recognized the long-term nature of the pandemic and chose to adapt in ways that would allow them to reopen with new safety measures. As a school, we can either treat this pandemic like a temporary break, or we can accept that this is the new normal. Regardless of whether the school eventually opts to universally alter its grading policies, it’s important to remember that large-scale changes will not really harm the academic reputation of the school and that the well-being of those who cannot adjust to the pandemic must always be prioritized.
There is little sense in regressing to a policy that was temporarily implemented for the very start of the pandemic. We entered the semester with the understanding that grading standards would mostly be those from before the pandemic. While I agree that our mental health must be prioritized, those who have not adjusted to the new normal or who are experiencing their own traumas need and deserve as much individual help and attention from the school as possible. 
As most have adjusted to the circumstances and nature of the pandemic, we have to face the reality that, unless everyone is sent home, the school is not going to lower its grading standards. If you feel that you do not fit into this generalization of the student body, I encourage you to reach out and seek help from professors, academic advisers, or any other resource for help on campus. The school made it very clear that their lowering of standards was temporary, so I’d be very surprised to see them revert to their spring grading system.

Generally speaking, discussion of the mixed race experience seems to be mainly driven by the difficulty of “fitting in” or having a sense of “racial imposter syndrome.” The struggles of racial imposter syndrome coming from being mixed race definitely resonate with me as a half-Asian person, and the emotional turmoil that comes from trying to belong is a valid concern. However, we need to talk about how the predominant view of mixed-race people centers on whiteness and how this narrow-minded perception of mixed-race people hurts everyone.
From Zendaya to Phillipa Soo, the media sets the mainstream standard of a mixed-race person as someone who is half-white or white-passing. We see this in how Emma Stone was chosen to play a multiracial character in Aloha and how the most visible mixed-race actors in Hollywood are half-white. By having the default for multiracial representation be “half-white,” society perpetuates the myth that mixed-race individuals are “whitened” versions of an ethnic background. This perception of multiracial people not only erases non-white mixed-race identities, but also reinforces the standard of measuring the desirability of POC by proximity to whiteness. I see this effect clearly in how others discuss my physical appearance as a half-white Asian.
My first boyfriend at Carnegie Mellon used to trace the features of my face and try to distinguish the “Asian” features from the “European” features. We would lie on the bed, side by side, and his fingers would feel up my face. His index finger streaked down the bridge of my “European” nose, while he debated over whether my almond-shaped eyes were “more Asian” or the double eyelids made them look “more European.” He concluded that my lips were “kind of Asian” after comparing the fullness of my lips to his. I would hear him call my hair “Asian” as his fingers combed through the thin, dark strands.
I looked back on this memory as a weird quirk of an ex-lover. Until I told my friends about this strange memory, I didn’t think there was anything wrong with my ex’s obsession with deconstructing my physical appearance in this manner. This was normal to me. I was used to Chinese aunties, family friends, and of course random strangers making unsolicited remarks about my racially ambiguous appearance. However, only by listening to how my monoracial friends struggled with self-hatred from Eurocentric beauty standards did I realize that people’s fascination with my racially ambiguous appearance was significantly problematic. Being called the “pretty Asian” meant that I was only pretty because I was mixed with white. When people commented on the beauty of my “exotic appearance,” they implicitly snubbed the beauty of non-white Asian women.
For my fellow part-white people of color, the takeaway is not that you don’t deserve to feel beautiful or talk about your mixed-race problems. Rather, my purpose in writing this piece is to offer a perspective of how we benefit from whiteness and the importance of shifting away from conversations about multiracial identity that emphasize whiteness. If we truly want to belong in spaces of color, we need to recognize how our whiteness affects others and learn to leave space for non-white multiracial individuals to discuss their mixed-race experience.
