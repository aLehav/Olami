A new year, a new team, a new field.
Last week, the university opened a new soccer field in place of the old intramural (IM) field. Carnegie Mellon had been hoping to build another field, for the purpose of hosting soccer, track, or intramural events, for the past four years. These ideas began to float around as early as 2006, shortly after the installation of new turf at Gesling Stadium. The turf helped tremendously in the logistics of organizing intercollegiate, intramural, and club events, but another field was deemed necessary.
In 2008, the university’s athletic department took another large step toward the construction of a soccer field by forming an advisory board that began to review such an idea. The board consisted of experienced athletic department heads from several universities who were appointed as consultants, as well as Carnegie Mellon alumni and locals. 
Some of the ideas included building a facility in Schenley Park and other locations around the area that would serve the university and local high schools. According to Carnegie Mellon athletics director Susan Bassett, a few of the points that the board members strongly considered were mostly focused around the track team and where the team would be able to hold its throwing events.
After the hiring of current men’s soccer coach Arron Lujan, the project gained further momentum. Bassett explained that she and Lujan examined the IM field a few years ago and thought it possible to squeeze a regulation-sized soccer field in the area, as well as make room for the throwers of the track team.
The track team did not get the facilities it had hoped for, but its members’ concerns center on where they will practice given the little space allotted to them. As one track team senior, Morgan Faer, stated, “When we host track meets — and this goes for practices as well — I’m wondering how we are going to fit all the throwing events on that one patch of grass. Maybe you would be able to have shot put going on at the same time as other events, but hammer, discus,and javelin would have to all go at different times.” 
Bassett addressed these concerns by explaining that the current plan is for the javelin throwers to throw from the turf into a triangular patch of grass while the hammer, discus, and shot put throwers use their respective circles on the other side to throw into the same area. However, this plan may not allow certain throwing events to be held simultaneously.
“In the past we’ve hosted meets like the Western Pennsylvania Championships, where there are a lot of athletes,” Faer said. “How are we expected to fit in these three events before the meet is over...? Sending an event offsite could cause athletes to miss other events.”
Even with conflicting agendas, major credit for this project must be given to Bassett, as it was not clear last March that this project was going to happen. Lujan and Bassett’s efforts promptly got the project going, and now the field is ready for the fall soccer seasons. Bleachers should be in place later this week on the Margaret Morrison Avenue side of the field. Bassett said, “We’re thrilled with the project and excited with the way it will benefit intercollegiate, club, and intramural sports.”

The actual misquoted line that Ilsa Lund uttered at the start of Casablanca was, “Play it once, Sam. For old times’ sake.”
Play it once, indeed.
Maybe it’s just a bad year, but as Mets announcer Ron Darling so bluntly pointed out, this year has featured some of the worst umpiring I’ve ever seen. Aside from replay-aided home run calls, which have still been potentially wrong at least once, TV replays have shown fans innumerable missed calls on judgments that prove to be both trivial and important.
Perhaps none was more important, or fueled more debate, than the call umpire Jim Joyce missed on June 2 this year in Detroit. Joyce, a 24-year veteran, called Cleveland’s Jason Donald safe on a close play at first that would have otherwise completed a perfect game for the Tigers’ Armando Galarraga. Replays, as well as most naked-eye views, showed that the call should have been out. Galarraga got imperfection, Joyce got infamy, and the debate about expanding replay grew from a small fire to an inferno.
In 2007, the Mets’ David Wright had a double overturned to a home run after the scoreboard showed a replay for all to see. After a plethora of missed home run calls found the spotlight in 2008, Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig announced that after much deliberation and planning, the use of replay would be instituted for any close home run call, whether the debate be fair or foul, over the fence or in play (or interference). Cameras were installed at “strategic” locations throughout every ballpark in baseball and by September that year, the Yankees’ Alex Rodriguez was awarded the first official replay-assisted home run call in baseball history.
The introduction of replay for home run calls was shunned by some but welcomed by most. As a longtime follower of baseball and a fan of the human element of the game, I warily approved of the move based solely on the principle that close home run calls would be the only instances in which replay would be used. The slew of missed home run calls that year had been too much to overlook, and minimal use of replay seemed to be a rather unobtrusive solution.
It was. Momentarily.
With “the imperfect game” leading the way, the charge for a more extensive use of replay has baseball fans screaming from both sides of the debate. Those in favor have a rather large pool of evidence in their favor, as archives of almost every game can show any missed call from decades of baseball past. With no missed calls, the yeasayers yell, the game will be rid of much frustration and many what-ifs.
But what of the pacing of the game? That is one of the main arguments on the anti side. Currently, similar to the guidelines set by the NFL, any manager can ask that a home run be reviewed via replay if he believes the umpire got the call wrong. A typical video review takes around two minutes, though some have taken almost 10. With extended replay usage, some say, a manager could use that right to challenge any somewhat close call and potentially delay a game far more than necessary.
Such a situation could rarely happen, though. Any manager who can see a close call is correct from the naked eye wouldn’t argue for the sake of arguing. Moreover, according to a survey conducted by ESPN’s Outside the Lines earlier this year, a close call happens about 1.3 times per game — hardly enough to make a significant dent in a game’s timing.
More importantly, the survey revealed that in the 184 games included in the survey — every MLB game played from June 29 to July 11 — umpires called 66 percent of the 230 close calls correctly. Furthermore, 14 percent of said calls could have gone either way, and umpires got 20 percent of the calls wrong. What wasn’t included was how many of those 230 calls, and more specifically how many of the incorrect ones,  pivotal plays in the game were, like Joyce’s.
That could be the exception to the rule. What if only game-changing calls like Joyce’s could be reviewed? It would potentially keep replay in the wings unless absolutely necessary, perhaps pleasing both sides of the debate.
But any call can be potentially game-changing.  Factors like how many outs there are and how many runners are on base change both the pitcher’s and the batter’s approach; they change a manager’s approach and a baserunner’s approach. In short, there are too many things that could determine whether a call is game-changing or not.
Frankly, what the debate boils down to is how much people value the human element of baseball. Growing up, missed calls were always a part of the game. They always have been. My grandfather loves to talk about how at Ebbets Field, the home of the Brooklyn Dodgers, “Three Blind Mice” used to be played as the umpires were being introduced. “Kill the ump!” has been a favorite cry of baseball fans throughout the world and throughout history. Love them or hate them, umpires have always been there to try to get the call right.
As far as I’m concerned — and as far as history is concerned — missed calls have only become a hot-button issue in the past few years. Before the griping really began, missed calls were just accepted as a part of baseball, and for many, a part of what made baseball great. I agree with what Hall of Famer Harmon Killebrew said when interviewed by Outside the Lines: “To me it’s the human element part of the game, and I think it should stay that way. Maybe I’m from the old school, but I think that is the way it ought to be played.”
So here’s looking at you, umps. Call ’em like you see ’em. Play it once — in real time — and let baseball be baseball.

With the fall season just around the corner, the Carnegie Mellon athletics department welcomes back some returning members and congratulates five new full-time members: Jeff Simmons, an assistant football coach for the running backs; Mike Belmonte, the assistant men’s and women’s tennis coach; and Jessica Pope, Lisa Andrews, and Adam Hindes on the sports medicine staff.
Simmons returns for his fifth year on the football staff as an assistant for the running backs, promoted from part-time last year. Before joining the Tartans, Simmons coached high school teams and helped run summer football camps with his grandfather. He also played as a quarterback for Slippery Rock University for three years during his college days. In 2006, Simmons was named among Carnegie Mellon’s University Athletic Association Coaching Staff of the Year.
The tennis teams welcome back Belmonte, who in addition to being assistant coach was also hired as the assistant intramurals director. “I put myself in this position to learn more and surround myself with like-minded people,” Belmonte said of his new title. Now that Belmonte is full-time instead of part-time, he said, “I hope to have a better understanding of college varsity recruiting and coaching and the little things that I wasn’t able to see from exposure on a part-time basis.” Belmonte has coached both the men’s and women’s tennis teams for the past two years, and he won the ITA Atlantic South Regional and National Assistant Coach of the Year awards for 2008–09.
“I am happy to be part of the department full-time,” Belmonte said. “I feel I have lots to offer and I am anxious to see how much of a difference I can make.”
Pope received a master of science degree in health and human performance and joins the Tartan staff after a one-year stint at St. Mary’s College as an athletic trainer.
Hindes is also anxious for the season to begin. “I would like to develop a strong performance team and utilize all our resources in sports medicine, strength and conditioning, nutrition, and counseling so that our athletes will have the best chance of competing on the field.” As a new trainer and sports medicine organizer, he is most looking forward to building relationships and working with the athletic staffs and the athletes. 
Hindes added, “If we all work as a cohesive unit, our strengths will [complement] each other, aid in preventing injuries, and [help] the return of our injured athletes to the field.”
These new faces will help the Tartans bring home the Ws and pull off another successful season of fall sports.

As the 2010 PGA Tour season reaches its conclusion, the news headlines do not center around the four different winners of the four major tournaments, or the upcoming Ryder Cup event. Instead, the reporters are still focused on a golfer who has not even won a tournament this year. He’s also currently the No. 1 golfer on tour. He also had a sex scandal. Yes, it’s Tiger Woods.
In November, Woods was involved in a low-speed car crash near his Florida home. As more details came out about that accident, Woods’ private life spiraled out of control. Every day, another mistress came out and spoke to the media as Woods lost fans, sponsors, and soon his wife, Elin Nordegren. The consensus from the sports media was that if Woods continued to play like Woods, people would forget about his past transgressions and learn to forgive him. After all, it worked for many athletes, such as the Dallas Cowboys’ Hall of Fame receiver Michael Irvin with his arrests for cocaine possession in 1993 and the Los Angeles Lakers’ guard Kobe Bryant with his rape allegations in Colorado in 2004. In both cases, the athletes performed on the field, and their off-the-field problems were rarely mentioned.
It seems like an easy task for a determined and stone-cold competitor like Woods. In fact, he has dominated the courses of the Masters, the U.S. Open, and the British Open. However, Woods has not been playing like himself and has been a non-factor during this season. 
Other golfers, those who crumbled under the cold stares of Woods and the circus of fans who followed him hole-to-hole, are no longer intimidated by the world’s No. 1. He fired his swing coach and changed putters before the British Open. Both changes yielded no tournament victories, and he is only a tournament away from losing his No. 1 ranking to Phil Mickelson. Did we just experience the end of Woods’ reign over the golf world? 
If Woods’ golf game continues to decline, the story will be bigger than Woods himself. The question about Woods’ career was: When will he break Jack Nichlaus’ record of 19 major victories? Now the question is: Will he even get close to getting those 19 major victories? 
This downfall will be one of sport’s biggest disappointments in recent years. It will certainly be comparable to the 2007 New England Patriots’ near-perfect season or even USC’s failure to capture a second consecutive national championship in the 2005 Rose Bowl Game against the University of Texas. Woods’ career will be viewed in history as a story of not one golfer, but two golfers: the pre-scandal Woods and the post-scandal Woods. Sports historians and analysts will debate what will be a very popular what-if question: What if The National Enquirer never wrote about Rachel Uchitel, and that accident never happened in the wee hours of Thanksgiving 2009?
The sport of golf needs Woods’ dominance. As any older member of the PGA Tour will admit, Woods is the reason for the additional sponsorships to tournaments as well as the higher tournament winnings. During Woods’ lost season in 2008, when he was recovering from reconstructive knee surgery, ratings for golf tournaments plummeted and the PGA Tour lost a lot of revenue. Without the superority of Woods to look forward to at a typical tournament, the ratings and sponsorships will surely go down. It will be golf’s worst nightmare, as there are few golfers whose talent can be compared to Tiger’s.
All that is just speculation, as only one year has passed, and even athletes like Woods have an off year or two. His journey back to the top of the pack will be rougher than the average athlete’s, as Woods does not have a team to lean on. 
Golf is an individual sport, which requires the mental and physical strength that Woods has shown he possessed in previous years.
If he can get his life back in order, he can focus on his golf game and continue his rigorous practice procedures that helped him win 12 major tournaments. If he can get his game back, Woods can save golf as a prominent and popular sport in America. Woods’ career may be a great comeback story, and many people will learn to forgive him for his mistakes. But for now, those are just big ifs.

Cleaning up the largest marine oil spill in history is no easy task, and the public is still uncertain as to whether the ongoing cleanup has been successful. However, one thing is for certain: The cleanup would not have been feasible without the help of advances in oil spill technology.
Assessing the problem was a challenge, but researchers came up with an inventive way to measure the rate of oil gushing from the sea floor. According to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, the most precise multibeam sonar was used to measure the size and shape of the oil plume, thereby establishing an upper bound on the leak rate of oil. Multibeam sonars are usually used in imaging the sea floor and studying hydrothermal vents. Hydrothermal vents are openings on the Earth’s surface from which heated water escapes, much like the way the oil was escaping; it only required a leap of ingenuity to realize it was the perfect tool for the job.
Other measurement techniques, according to an article from The Christian Science Monitor, included satellite imaging to measure the size of the oil slick on the surface and high-resolution video to determine the flow rate of the oil plume. In a laboratory, high-resolution video measures the speed of individual particles by tracking the distance the particles travel between successive frames of film, but this was impossible for the oil plume because of its opacity. Scientists found a solution to this problem by measuring the distance traveled by oil plume billows, rather than individual particles. Measuring may be important, but cleaning up is the only way to remove the spill from the environment. The easiest but most time-consuming method would be to let Mother Nature take care of the spill. Water currents and storms act to disperse the oil, causing the amount of oil in water to reach a low enough level for nature to biodegrade it from the water. To speed up this process, chemical dispersants have been used. While dispersants are toxic to the environment, they are less toxic than the oil; however, some scientists are still concerned about their environmental impact. Some fear they may affect the environment and wildlife just as badly as the oil itself.
According to www.cnn.com, dispersants work by bonding to oil molecules, preventing the oil from binding together. Aircrafts can be used to spread the dispersant on the oil slick. Researchers have also considered spreading dispersants underwater so the oil will break up before it reaches the surface, but they are unsure of the effectiveness of this approach as it has never been done before.
Skimming the oil from the surface of the water will help reduce the size of the oil spill, but skimmers are time-consuming, cannot travel very fast, and are unable to perform in rough weather conditions  where wave sizes exceed 1.5 meters, according to an article from www.popularmechanics.com. This is an issue because skimming is the only way to directly remove the oil from the environment.
Another method of oil cleaning is known as in situ burning. In low concentrations, oil cannot burn when it is mixed with water. However, ships can gather oil into a concentrated location until it becomes thick enough to be able to burn while still in the water. Once the oil burns, it becomes a substance resembling tar that can be removed from the water. However, a test burn in a small area revealed that ocean winds and currents would not allow effective in situ burning.
Because of the difficulty of the task at hand and current technological restrictions, researchers are developing newer technologies that will make oil cleanups easier in the future. These include faster skimmers that can work in rough weather conditions and the development of a new substance known as aerogel that will be able to  soak up oil. Aerogel is the least dense man-made solid created and already has many uses as an insulator, but it is being developed to soak up oil like a sponge while also repelling water. The oil can then be removed from the aerogel and recycled, and the aerogel can be reused for more cleanup.
The recent BP oil spill has shown that, even with our best efforts, the power of nature can be uncontrollable. However, necessity is the mother of invention; it has also  spurred a creativity in technological achievement that will help us clean our oceans, as well as maintain and protect the environment from future disasters.

The ancient Chinese believed that an energy, called “qi,” flows through the body and maintains health. The energy moves through pathways in the body called meridians. If this flow were disrupted, it would result in ill health or disease. To restore the correct flow of energy, the Chinese would insert needles at certain points along these pathways, a technique known as acupuncture. As explained in an article on www.MayoClinic.com, acupuncture originated more than 2,000 years ago in China and over the past 30 years has become a popular medical tool.
Today, acupuncture involves inserting thin metal needles at various points throughout the patient’s body. Although the theory of qi and meridians, still believed by traditional Chinese practitioners, is not widely accepted among Westerners, studies have shown that acupuncture is useful for a variety of medical conditions. Acupuncture has been known to help patients with osteoarthritis and to ease the feeling of nausea after chemotherapy. It also can act as a painkiller for several conditions including headaches, migraines, pain after dental surgeries, and even labor pain.
Although the exact mechanism by which acupuncture works is still unknown, certain theories have been made. According to an article on www.MedicineNet.com, scientists believe that the needles might stimulate certain sensory nerves and cause a series of effects. One possible effect of this nerve stimulation is the release of opioids produced in the body. Opioids are a class of chemicals that act as painkillers; one of the more well-known members of the group is morphine. The human body produces certain endogenous opioids or endorphins, which bind to receptors in the brain and help reduce the feeling of pain. Studies have shown that if chemicals that counteract the effects of opioids are administered during acupuncture, the acupuncture treatment has no effect.
Another theory that has been proposed is that acupuncture helps stimulate the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland regulates the release of a variety of hormones that travel through the body. Hence, stimulation of this gland could cause a multitude of different effects on many parts of the body.
Acupuncture has also been known to alter the regulation of blood flow in the body.
Although there is some concrete evidence proving the effectiveness of acupuncture and the science behind it, some people still believe that acupuncture has no real effects on the body. According to a study published online this month in the Arthritis Care & Research journal, patients who received traditional Chinese acupuncture treatment and those in the control group, who had “sham” acupuncture treatment, reported similar after-effects of the treatment. The “sham” acupuncture treatment consists of inserting needles at random points throughout the body that are not the correct centers for stimulation.
Although this study suggests that traditional acupuncture treatment has no effect on the body, many scientists doubt the effectiveness of sham acupuncture as a control. Traditional acupuncture practitioners place needles at points specified by the ancient Chinese. The scientific basis for such placement is still unknown. In sham acupuncture, the needles are placed at points not specified by the ancient Chinese. However, since there is such little understanding of the importance of the specific needle placement points, scientists believe that placing the needles at any point could cause positive results. Therefore, for studies concerning the effectiveness of acupuncture to be more accurate, a better control needs to be designed.

On average, Americans produce 1,600 pounds of garbage every year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The amount of trash produced in America annually can fill up enough garbage trucks, lined up end to end, to reach the moon. Luckily, landfills have been created and designed specifically to contain and process waste material. Without these indispensable filling grounds, America would quickly turn into a wasteland.
According to reports by the EPA, 55 percent of trash is found in landfills, while 28 percent is recycled and 22 percent is incinerated.
Landfill sites are picked where the natural setting will contribute to the needs of the landfill. Man-made structures are built to keep wastes from escaping, but the structure of the soil under the landfill is also important. According to www.ejnet.org, the ground should be watertight, and if any leakage occurs, it should be easy to predict where the leakage will collect so it can be removed.
Landfills are often seen as places where trash is dumped and ignored, but many more processes are involved in waste disposal. According to www.scdhec.gov, a landfill has different parts with specific functions. The bottom liner system keeps the waste isolated from the environment and is composed of layers of clay, sand, and plastic. Cells are the site of trash compaction. In order to prevent rainwater from touching trash, a storm water drainage system channels water away to a collection pond. However, water that has come into contact with waste must be collected by the leachate collection system and treated to remove contaminants. Finally, the decomposition of trash produces flammable gases that must be collected by the methane collection system to prevent combustion of the waste.
There are potential problems with the layers in a landfill. Clay liners can be fractured, and chemicals can diffuse, or seep, through layers of clay. In addition, some chemicals can degrade the clay liners. 
Plastic liners can also be degraded easily by common household chemicals, including vinegar and mothballs. Leachate collection systems can clog for various reasons, including mud buildup, microorganisms, collection of minerals, and chemical degradation.
In a landfill, trash that is dumped does not decompose readily. Oxygen and moisture are necessary for decomposition, and these requirements are rare under millions of pounds of compacted trash. Likewise, the Air and Waste Management Association explains that plastics thrown away in landfills, even if marked as biodegradable, usually cannot decompose because they are hidden under layers of trash. The degradation process requires sunlight to occur. According to www.howstuffworks.com, landfills are meant to store trash, not decompose it, as is done with a compost pile. When landfills reach their capacity and close, the trash is buried, but the site is still monitored for decades. In fact, the John F. Kennedy and La Guardia airports in New York City were constructed over closed landfills.
Landfills are an essential part of the waste management system, but even with current technology they use large amounts of space. To become more efficient, some landfills work with recycling plants, while others turn methane gas and other byproducts of the decomposition of waste into energy that nearby residents can use. While trash may always be present in our lives, the amount we create can be reduced through simple means like recycling, reusing old containers, and using organic wastes as compost to help fertilize lawns.

Facebook unveils location feature
Facebook released its new “Places” feature last Wednesday, entering the growing arena of location-based social networking services. Facebook Places joins existing services like Foursquare and Gowalla, which allow users to “check in” from any location. Places includes features that let friends check others in and show the people checked into a given location at any time. This allows groups of friends to see who might be in the same location — a feature targeted at college students.
As with most new Facebook and location-based features, Places has been closely scrutinized for its privacy implications. Privacy watchdogs like the Electronic Frontier Foundation have been generally satisfied with the privacy controls for Facebook Places. Opting out of the service is straightforward, and location information is not available to non-friends by default.

Muscular dystrophy cause revealed
In a paper published by Science last Thursday, researchers identified the mechanism that causes facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). This mechanism is a gene on chromosome 4 that was previously thought to be inactive — what is known as “junk” DNA. According to the researchers, two conditions directly cause a person to have FSHD. The first is the presence of 10 or fewer copies of this gene, and the second is a DNA section called a poly (A) sequence. If both of these conditions are met, an individual will have FSHD.
Understanding how a gene that is thought to be dead can cause a disease has consequences beyond research into causes of muscular dystrophy. Knowing the physical origin of a disease can help scientists target medications. It also gives new insights to researchers studying other disorders that may be linked to junk DNA.

Concussions, Lou Gehrig’s disease linked
Researchers at Boston University have proposed a connection between brain damage from concussions and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), better known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. In studying the brains of three pro athletes — two football players and a boxer — the researchers identified the TDP-43 protein in the brain and spinal cord. This protein has been linked to motor neuron diseases.
The Boston University study is only the most recent in a series of investigations into the long-term effects of head injuries on athletes and soldiers. Gehrig was known for playing while injured, and he suffered multiple concussions during his career. While the scientists have not yet done enough research to firmly link concussions with neural diseases like ALS, the studies do give further scientific evidence of the negative consequences of repeated brain injuries.

Pittsburgh — or Shitsburgh, reportedly Sienna Miller’s loving moniker for the town — doesn’t always get the best rap as a fun city for young people. But fear not, because there is much more to the city than you might expect. This upcoming fall season is shaping up to have plenty of opportunities for big, exciting city living.
Music
The Books with special guest Lohio 
Rangos Hall, Aug. 26, 8 p.m.
With all the great programming right here on campus, you might not even have to leave Carnegie Mellon to find entertainment. AB (Activities Board) Coffeehouse wastes no time and is hosting a concert the very first week of classes. Come to Rangos Hall in the UC on Thursday and see the first of many concerts this semester that are sponsored by your student activities fee. Tickets are free with your student ID and can be picked up at the information desk on the first floor of the University Center.
Lady Gaga 
Consol Energy Center, Sept. 5, 8 p.m.
Lady Gaga comes to the ’Burgh early next month as part of her Monster Ball tour. And while rumors swirled that the tickets to her show sold out in a minute, you might still be in luck using sites like StubHub. Tickets start at over $100, but reviewers rave that it’s certainly worth the cost. Be warned, though; it’s probably not the type of event you want to take your little brother to — and you should probably start planning your outfit now.
Broken Social Scene 
Byham Theater, Sept. 8, 8 p.m.
Broken Social Scene will be stopping in town as part of the tour for their newest album, Forgiveness Rock Record, released in May of this year. Even if you’re not into indie rock, you might recognize the band as the fall concert headliner at Carnegie Mellon in 2007. Tickets to see them again — not for free this time — can be purchased through the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust.
The National with Owen Pallett 
Carnegie Library Music Hall of Homestead, 
Sept. 25, 8 p.m.
The National continue their rise to popularity with their recent release, High Violet, and a headlining tour that lands them in Homestead, Pa., at the end of September. Their opening act, composer Owen Pallett, rose to popularity under the name Final Fantasy and has worked with a huge number of artists from Arcade Fire to Mika. Tickets are $38.50 and can be purchased through www.carnegieconcerts.com.

Movies
Love and Other Drugs
This romance/comedy was shot here in Pittsburgh and stars Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal. It won’t be out until Thanksgiving, though. Even if you don’t recognize the Pittsburgh scenery at all, the movies stars aren’t so bad to look at.
The Next Three Days
Also shot in Pittsburgh, The Next Three Days stars Liam Neeson, Russell Crowe, and Olivia Wilde in a crime thriller about a prison break. If the trailer is a good representation of the movie at all, it should be action-packed and fun to watch, and it promises lots of opportunities to yell, “Ooh, I’ve been there!”
Abduction
And for the Twilight-obsessed: Taylor Lautner. Every 16-year-old’s favorite werewolf has been filming Abduction in Pittsburgh this summer. Likely caused by Lautner’s stardom alone, the casting call brought 900 people to our own Rangos Hall. And while the film doesn’t yet have a release date (filming should conclude at the end of September), we believe a film with Lautner realizing that his parents are not his parents just can’t fail.
Shows
The Phantom of the Opera
Benedum Center, Aug. 25–Sept. 19
One of Broadway’s most celebrated musicals is coming to Pittsburgh this fall. The Phantom of the Opera will be showing downtown for just over four weeks. Carnegie Mellon often sponsors tickets, so be on the lookout for possible discounts through your RA or the Info Desk.
The World of Jewtopia 
Byham Theater, Sept. 25–26
This self-promoted “brand new multimedia extravaganza” is a one-act comedy show based on the bestselling book JEWTOPIA: The Chosen Book for the Chosen People. While the show is only playing in Pittsburgh for one weekend, we expect it will find an audience here that finds the show both hilarious and uncannily accurate.
He Who Gets Slapped 
Philip Chosky Theater, Sept. 30–Oct. 9
The Carnegie Mellon School of Drama kicks off its 2010–11 season with He Who Gets Slapped. While this show may not be one you’re familiar with, the School of Drama always produces incredibly professional plays and offers you the chance to see students from your class perform. The complete schedule and information on getting tickets can be found on the School of Drama website, www.cmu.edu/cfa/drama.
Outdoors
Pittsburgh Pirates
While famed Pittsburgh sports usually involve football championships and a strong hockey team, the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team also offers cheap tickets and a beautiful view of the city. So even though the Pirates might not win that many games, the money you save on tickets lets you buy a fun opportunity to hang with your friends at a lower price than you would find at a Steelers or Penguins game.
The Great Race
The Great Race is an annual 10K or 5K run and 5K walk through Pittsburgh. The 5K course is mostly downhill, so don’t be intimidated. If you are up for a challenge, there is the 10K course, although it is also predominately downhill. You must register for the event by Sept. 3 for the discounted rate, or Sept. 21 at the latest to participate. Portions of the proceeds will be donated to the Richard S. Caliguiri Amyloidosis Fund, in honor of the race’s founder and the city’s late mayor. The Great Race is a great opportunity to see the city and be fit!
Pittsburgh Renaissance Festival
Want a break from the pressures of modern life? Go back in time and visit the Pittsburgh Renaissance Festival, full of lords, ladies, food, and shows. The Renaissance Festival is in West Newton (about an hour drive from campus), and it is open every weekend through the end of September. The festival has all the attractions you would expect at a Renaissance fair, from medieval crafts to blacksmiths — and, of course, a jousting arena. Visit www.pgh-renfest.com for tickets and more information.
No matter what you’re trying to find this semester, don’t think that just because you’re in Pittsburgh you’re out of luck. Try checking out The Tartan’s weekly calendar of events, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette’s calendar, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust’s website (www.pgharts.org), or updates on AB’s Facebook page for even more ideas.

Hong Kong surprised me with its beauty.
When I first learned I would be spending two months of my summer doing an internship in Hong Kong, I imagined a grimy city akin to Shanghai. Don’t get me wrong; I love Shanghai. But I would never associate the word “scenic” with it. 
However, Hong Kong had a combination of mountains, skyscrapers, and sea that took my breath away as soon as I stepped out of the airport. Looking out of my office building from the 47th floor, I could glimpse a fantastic view of the picturesque harbor, the steel and glass of downtown Hong Kong, and hilly islands in the distance floating on the blue South China Sea.
The city is a great place to be young. My weekends were packed with nights out at the numerous bars and clubs in Lan Kwai Fong, shopping trips to everything from Louis Vuitton stores to cheap-as-dirt-but-need-to-bargain shops in Mongkok, and customary visits to popular tourist spots around the city. Lan Kwai Fong, or LKF as it is more commonly called, is the most popular nighttime hangout spot. Spanning just a few streets, the area is closed to traffic at night, allowing people to walk around freely among the various clubs and pubs. I loved the atmosphere in LKF at night — everyone was dressed up in their bling best, intoxicated, and having a good time. Mongkok — with its popular Ladies’ Market — proved to be my favorite shopping destination. Everything from cheap tops to jewelry to accessories was on sale — and thankfully I had a native Hong Kong friend to bargain for me in Cantonese.  
Hong Kong is all about the views. You can go up Hong Kong Island’s tallest mountain, Victoria Peak, in a tram and catch a glimpse of the glittering buildings at night. Take a ferry across to Kowloon Island and walk along Star Avenue for a view of the skyline up close and lit up in a daily light show. Take a trip to Lantau Island and see the spectacular Big Buddha statue perched on top of a hill from a cable car. And while there are many, each view never fails to disappoint.
Hong Kong is also perfectly situated for further exploring Southeast Asia. During my time there, I made two trips to the glitzy casino city of Macau. If Hong Kong is the Eastern New York City, Macau is the Las Vegas. With its own Wynn, Venetian, and Sands casinos, Macau proves to be the ultimate gambling destination of the East. I’m not much of a gambler, but I still enjoyed the glamour of the casinos. Beyond the casinos, the city’s Portuguese architecture is also worth a look.
Hong Kong culture comes off as strongly cosmopolitan, with the high foreign population and abundance of Western brands everywhere. But if you dig deep — and make some helpful Hong Konger friends — it’s hard to overlook the distinct Chinese culture. Make sure you get a taste of both worlds, because their coexistence is exactly what makes Hong Kong so unique.
One of my favorite parts of traveling is tasting the local fare. My food adventures let me sample a wide range of cuisines: delicious Hong Kong staples like wonton noodle soup and egg tarts in tiny street shops, tasty dim sum lunches at a quiet tea house and a bustling family-style restaurant, and Taiwanese dumplings and Korean barbecue. Hong Kong’s international culture also expanded my restaurant choices. Italian, Thai, Vietnamese, and Mediterranean food all graced my plate while dining at fancy restaurants in the culturally diverse area of SoHo. 
Life in Hong Kong proved to be perfect for a 20-something working and living alone. It was fast-paced, with the right amount of adventure and excitement balanced by lazy Sunday mornings. I fell in love with the city the moment I saw it, and after two months there, I can’t wait to plan my trip back.

Over the summer, there were a handful of songs that received a lot of radio airplay. One such song was newbie Mike Posner’s single, “Cooler Than Me.” The overnight hit — a clever mix of techno, hip-hop, and pop — is an accurate slice of what the rest of his debut album, 31 Minutes to Takeoff, sounds like.
The leadoff track is a 53-second intro, sounding like the soundtrack is falling through the sky and clouds. Following that, “Bow Chicka Wow Wow” is about — well, you can probably assume from the title. A sensual electric guitar, paired up with Posner’s silky vocals, creates a great candlelight anthem.
Next off, “Please Don’t Go” crescendos from solely vocals to being backed by a strong bass drumbeat, and it finally gets topped off with a beat that sounds like it came from La Roux. For sure, Posner isn’t one to have a monotonous repertoire.
With clever lyrics about a girl who’s just too cool for school (and too cool for him, apparently), “Cooler Than Me” draws inspiration from a fellow classmate who wouldn’t give Posner the time of day. He writes, “I got you all figured out; you need everyone’s eyes just to feel seen.” Isn’t revenge sweet, especially when it sounds so good?
The next track, “Déjà Vu,” features Boyz II Men on background vocals, so you automatically know it’s a soulful jam. “Do U Wanna?” starts off sounding like something straight out of ’90s Brooklyn, and continues with Posner asking rather bluntly, “Do you wanna be my baby? Do you wanna be my girl?”
“Cheated” is about an unfaithful relationship, but not what you might expect. He talks about a couple’s times together, but retrospectively thinks, “I should’ve cheated on you. I was everything you wanted and more.” But the best part of the song is when he names the girl the song is about: “Caroline Stevens, this song is for you.” Posner isn’t one to spend his nights at home crying over heartbreak.
Toning it down, “Gone In September” starts off with a beat of snapping fingers. This song is Posner’s take on a ballad, dealing with leaving a lady-friend — whom we’re not sure he really has feelings for — after the summer months. He croons, “Now it’s breaking my heart to break yours,” but later asks, “I said I loved you in the summer, but will I love you in the fall?” Juxtaposed with the sad lyrics is the optimistic music, which leaves listeners feeling like they’ve heard a new style of music.
“Save Your Goodbye” starts off, again, sounding like a ballad, but the chorus comes in with a very strong beat and seems to slow down time. Next up, “Synthesizer” — an instrument Posner uses liberally in his music — follows the calmed-down previous tracks and is the only track over four minutes. It echoes the atmosphere of the leadoff 53-second track and, if you can believe it, he uses a synthesizer in the chorus!
“Delta 1406” is easily forgettable, with its unchanging beat and Posner’s lack of vocal range, but still serves as a “chill-out song.” The closing track, “Falling,” returns to the sound of the skies. Throughout the song, Posner delivers endless and wordy verses, but they flow so well and complement the rhythm that it’s almost like he’s reciting a poem of fear and angst. “Every word that you say keeps on bouncing around in my head / And all my illusions of grandeur are turning to bad dreams instead / You’ll be there pointing and laughing to prove you were wiser than I / ’Cause I’m just pretending perfection / I’m flying uncomfortably high.”
The musicality of the opener and the closer are almost identical; we know we were taken on a journey of sound, but we’re still falling through the clouds.
Posner, at the ripe age of 22, can put his sociology and business degree from Duke aside for now. (He just graduated this past spring!) After all, following one of the summer’s most-played songs is going to take up quite a bit of time, but he shouldn’t have any trouble.
Listen Up: “Cooler Than Me,” “Cheated,” “Save Your Goodbye,” “Falling”
The Verdict: Definitely check this guy out! He’s fresh, he’s now, he’s good, and he’s not going anywhere.

Although the weather seems to be holding steady at “too hot,” my version of summer draws to a close today as the fall semester begins. So with that, here’s a recap of some of the bound-paper artifacts that I have stumbled upon throughout the sunny season.
The House of Tomorrow — Peter Bognanni 
Growing up in the tourist spectacle that is a geodesic dome, under the tutelage of one’s grandmother, an original devotee of R. Buckminster Fuller, leads to a life that would never be mistaken for normal. Through his grandmother’s stroke, the protagonist is opened to a new world of punk music, cigarettes, girls, and a friend with a transplanted heart. A light summer read, built on the foundation of one of America’s quirkier intellects.
Reality Hunger — David Shields 
I can’t heap enough praise on the palimpsest of lies that is David Shield’s Reality Hunger. His “manifesto,” which is just a list of stolen fragments rearranged to describe how both fiction and non-fiction are simply no longer sufficient for our digitally enhanced future, is a mind-warping trip that you will want to take more than once. Keep an eye on Shields.
Deathbird Stories — Harlan Ellison 
Summer is always a time to return to a classic, and with Ellison as one of the original imaginative writers, his Deathbird Stories are a clever, modern (cough: 1975) rethinking of gods, mythology, and the human condition. Stories such as “Basilisk” and the namesake “The Deathbird” remain as interesting as I believe they must have been 35 years ago.
Designing Obama — Scott Thomas 
This Kickstarter project is a worthy attempt from the design director of the Obama campaign, Scott Thomas, to catalog and bind the design evolution and artistic response to the brand that became America’s 44th president. This coffee table-style book shows, once again, that Kickstarter works, print isn’t dead, and Obama galvanized the artistic community possibly more than any other group in the breadth of support he received.
The Invisible Bridge — Julie Orringer 
Orringer’s sprawling epic about a young Jewish Hungarian architecture student living in Paris in the 1930s (guess what happens), is a beautifully detailed, romantic study of the era and an achievement completely disparate from her more surreal short story collection How To Breathe Underwater. While not receiving as much praise or media hype as David Mitchell’s The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet or Jonathan Franzen’s Freedom (see page A9), Orringer’s first novel is just as deserving.
The Imperfectionists — Tom Rachman 
My favorite novel told in short stories of the summer, The Imperfectionists recounts events in the intertwined lives of several staff members of an international newspaper on the decline. A study on the modern “decline” of journalism, the real lives behind the printed word, and how an empire is constructed, the tales are told with both humor and levity. Rachman’s debut novel is one of a string of successes that has helped elevate the book’s editor, Susan Kamil, to become publisher of the Random House and Dial Press imprints.
And if you have an insatiable hunger for literature, here are a few more: 
China Mieville’s The City & The City
Paul Harding’s Tinkers
Geoff Dyer’s Out of Sheer Rage
Stieg Larsson’s Millenium trilogy
Victor LaValle’s Big Machine

College students spend a considerable amount of money on tuition, so when it comes time to eat, many opt for meals that consist of ramen noodles and overly caffeinated drinks. Luckily, there is an alternative in Oakland. If you are willing to stay up a little later than usual — and let’s face it, you’re probably going to be up anyway — you can get a full meal at half the price! Whether you’re in the mood for Mexican or Indian food, Oakland’s half-price probably has something for you and your budget.  At other times of the day, the neighborhood also has plentiful offerings of breakfasts and desserts.
Thinking you want Italian? Then head over to Joe Mama’s for a diner-style Italian meal. This large eating establishment features an upstairs dining room that looks like something out of Grandma’s Sicilian kitchen, complete with red checkerboard tablecloths. The menu has pizza, pasta, and everything in between. During the months of September through April, select menu items are half price as long as you show up between 11 p.m. and midnight. Craving a pizza? They are half the price from 4 to 5 p.m. daily!
If you are looking for a more red, white, and blue menu, then Fuel & Fuddle is the place for you. The menu features items such as chicken wings and burgers alongside sandwiches and wraps. For those of you that are of age, Fuel & Fuddle also offers a selection of beers that changes daily. Remember that the half-price menu after 11 p.m. excludes steak and seafood dishes.
Want to be more diverse? India Garden will fulfill any desire that you have to be adventurous. The menu is as large as your “Welcome to Carnegie Mellon” packet, guaranteeing that there will be at least one thing you’re willing to eat. You can pick the desired spice level for your meal on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being as spicy as they can make it. (The restaurant’s slogan is “Only as spicy as you are.”) While you wait for your food, you can enjoy Indian music videos playing on the large TVs in the restaurant. As always, it wouldn’t be a complete Indian meal without the naan, and India Garden’s is delicious and fresh. Dinner is half price from 5 to 6 p.m. and 9 to 11 p.m.
Craving a Mexican meal but tired of the tiny menu offered at Chipotle? Then Mad Mex is your place. The menu has all of the Mexican classics: Fajitas, burritos, enchiladas, quesadillas, chimichangas, tacos... if you can name it, they probably have it. If you have your student ID with you, enjoy your meal at half the price between the hours of 2 and 4 p.m. After 11 p.m., most of the menu is half price, regardless of your educational status. Discounts don’t include the chimichangas, fajitas, and tacos, so keep that in mind when ordering.
Pamela’s Diner, featuring six locations in Pittsburgh, is home to some of the most delicious breakfast foods available. Each diner is different from the others. Venture over to the Oakland location and you will find the walls covered in board games from your childhood. The one in Shadyside chose to cover its walls with pictures of customers and neighborhood artwork. Every Pamela’s menu has classics like eggs and bacon, but the crowning glories are the specialty hotcakes. The crepe-like hotcakes can either be served alone or with fresh fruit, chocolate chips, and whipped cream. One can easily spend under $10 and still leave satisfied.
After all of the wonderful meals offered at low prices in Oakland, all that is missing is dessert. While most of the establishments mentioned above feature a dessert menu, you should consider visiting the other popular dessert destinations in the area. Dave and Andy’s, in the heart of Oakland, is home to fresh waffle cones and homemade ice cream. During the early fall and late spring, the lines are often out the door; the walls inside, covered in newspaper clippings, attest to the shop’s popularity. Flavors are made fresh and vary daily. If you don’t like waffle cones, don’t worry; there is always the option of getting your ice cream in a cup or as a shake. 
Finally, you can stop by the newly relocated Dozen Bake Shop on Craig Street when in need of some light and delicious baked goods. Cupcakes make a great on-the-go dessert.

In order to stay healthy at Carnegie Mellon, students need to go beyond the food served on campus. There are a few good places near campus that, with proper planning and care, can help students take a break and enjoy some good food.
Kohli’s Indian Imports
Kohli’s is one of the closest utility stores. Aside from Indian specialties, you can get eggs, milk, and vegetables for your last-minute needs. More about Kohli’s is at www.thetartan.org/2010/4/5/pillbox/food.
Location: On South Craig Street, between Forbes Avenue and Fifth Avenue.
Seoul Mart
Seoul Mart answers all your Asian food needs and is the closest Asian supermarket. Seoul Mart carries a good variety of products, from Asian barbecue-quality beef to vegetables, Asian sauces, and Korean instant noodles. 
On Saturday morning, Seoul Mart has gimbap, a kind of Korean sushi, along with other ready-to-eat dishes. At under $3, gimbap is a steal. If the weather is good, it will be sold out by 2 p.m., so make sure you get there early. 
Location: Corner of Fifth Avenue and South Neville Street.
Tokyo Japanese Food Store
Located in Shadyside, Tokyo offers a variety of Japanese snacks and ready-to-eat meals. If you have ever dreamed about making a Japanese creation, this is the place to get your ingredients.
Location: Corner of Ellsworth Avenue and College Street, in Shadyside.
**Giant Eagle
Giant Eagle, nicknamed “Geagle,” is the staple grocery store for every Carnegie Mellon student.  Next time you visit the Giant Eagle Market District in Shadyside, try their in-house bread for your sandwich; it’s quite delicious.
Squirrel Hill Location: Murray Avenue, three blocks down from Forbes Avenue.
Shadyside Location: On Centre Avenue just off South Negley Avenue.
Whole Foods
Steak from Whole Foods is a must for steak lovers, although it comes with quite a price tag. Even the cuts on sale will never disappoint. On a fancy day, try their dry-aged beef. You will get restaurant-quality meat at half the price.
Location: On Centre Avenue at Penn Circle South.
Strip District
With Wholey’s, Lotus, Penzeys, Mon Aimee, the Pennsylvania Macaroni Co., and many more, Penn Avenue in the Strip District is a whole street of food vendors and there’s nothing you can’t find. Yes, it is a little hard to get there, but making friends with someone who has a car is a good way to solve that problem. 
Location: On Penn Avenue from 17th Street to 25th Street.
Trader Joe’s
Some people call Trader Joe’s an economical Whole Foods, a place where great food and good prices meet. However, it does take an extra effort to get there from the Carnegie Mellon neighborhood.
Location: 6343 Penn Ave., a short walk off Penn Circle.

Hey scumbuckets!
My name is Juan Fernandez, the general manager of WRCT, Carnegie Mellon’s student-run community freeform radio station. It rules.
I assume that you’re tired of getting in your car, turning the radio dial for five minutes, and finding nothing but bland jazz, cheesy country, and mind-numbing top 40-hits, right? Well, joining WRCT is your chance to change the radio landscape in Pittsburgh. Don’t just sit around and complain about how atrocious radio is nowadays — get off your rump and help us pump out some great radio!
Jazz, breakbeat, Balkans music, J-pop, doom metal, experimental jazz, drum and bass, swing, cumbia, chiptunes, grindcore, hardcore rap, indie pop — when we play music, it’s serious business.
I’m guessing everyone on campus is competing for your attention, so I’ll try not to bombard you with too much information. Just know that you’ve got a place with us here at WRCT Pittsburgh: The community at the station is stupendous, and the station culture is a nurturing one.
If you want to chat us up and learn more about what we do, we’ll be out on the Cut playing music for the first two weeks of classes. Stop by and introduce yourselves. We’d love to meet you and take you in as part of the radio family.
The official WRCT Fall Orientation will be on Saturday, Sept. 11 at 7 p.m. in Rangos Hall, so save the date!
Have any questions? Send them to the training director at training@wrct.org.
Bisous for now,
Juan Fernandez

While the early previews for Scott Pilgrim vs. the World looked absurd, it was hard to decide whether it would be absurdly bad or absurdly brilliant. After a first viewing, it certainly lands squarely in the land of absurdly brilliant... when reviewed by two Carnegie Mellon computer science geeks.
The first sight: a pixelated Universal Studios Earth. The first sound: the studio’s theme recomposed into the only eight bits it ever needed. It is this digitally reduced beginning that sets the stage for a movie that is willing to take leaps where leaps are not necessary, to go beyond what is expected, and to push just a little further into a realm that deviates from popular culture into that of the video game, the comic book, and the awkward post-teenage lifestyle. Scott Pilgrim’s influences range from Mortal Kombat to The Legend of Zelda to School of Rock. 
The central plot of Scott Pilgrim revolves around our hero Scott’s efforts to start and maintain a relationship with the neon-haired New Yorker Ramona Flowers. In order to do so, he must defeat her seven “evil exes” and in that process come to terms with his own past. Deep. But again, while not exactly an unexplored premise, the plot is not what makes Scott Pilgrim one of the most entertaining movies of the year. The overlay of Scott’s “real” world with video game scenarios, comic book action, and rocky-punk garage band music is unique. When he defeats an evil ex, he gets a coin payout as if he had hit an arcade jackpot. There was the occasional somewhat awkward moment, like when a “1UP” sprite drops from the ceiling while Scott tells his band that he is going to “get a life.” However, most of the surreal additions to the film felt genuinely inspired and kept the audience laughing.
In the end, the people who will get the most out of Scott Pilgrim are those who can empathize with one of the three main roles: Scott, the awkward, lost 20-something with no self-esteem; Ramona, the cynic who is trying to run away from her past; and Knives Chau, Scott’s innocent and obsessive high school (ex-)girlfriend. Few of the supporting characters are developed beyond a name and a stereotype, though Kieran Culkin does an excellent job as Wallace Wells, Scott’s gay roommate. 
Even after a somewhat expected disappointing debut at the box office, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World seems destined to become the kind of film that Carnegie Mellon types everywhere will transform into the cult classic it deserves to be. The film’s tagline, “an epic of epic epicness,” is one that will be repeated in chants through the halls of Gates this fall. So, if for some reason you haven’t yet, go and witness the epicness that is the best video game movie yet... and stuff.

The Ghost Writer
7:30 10 12:30
This 2010 thriller directed by Roman Polanski has a strong cast and enough suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat for the duration of the flick. In the movie, Ewan McGregor plays a successful British ghostwriter who agrees to complete the memoirs of a former British prime minister played by Pierce Brosnan. All is not as it seems, however, as McGregor is soon ensnared in a tangled web of lies he could never have expected. Based on the 2007 novel titled The Ghost, The Ghost Writer is sure to leave you wanting more. Fun fact: Polanski was arrested and put under house arrest during a large portion of production.
Shutter Island
7:30 10 12:30
Shutter Island is a drama set in 1954 starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo, and Ben Kingsley. DiCaprio and Ruffalo are U.S. marshals who travel to a mysterious hospital on Shutter Island for criminally insane patients — or are they? It is believed that they are investigating a missing patient who took the lives of her three children and who also happened to vanish into thin air. The film is a solid thriller that will keep you guessing until the very end. Fun fact: This flick is director Martin Scorsese’s fourth collaboration with DiCaprio and is also Scorsese’s highest grossing film.
The Graduate 
8 10 12
Benjamin Braddock (played by Dustin Hoffman) is just like your everyday normal recent college graduate — no real goals set in his life, no job, and, oh yeah, in love with a girl while sleeping with her mother, who also happens to be his father’s business partner’s wife. Got all that? Indeed, sexual energy is all over this flick, which grasps the free-swingin’ ’60s movement very well. Fun fact: Robert Redford was basically deemed too lucky with women by the director to get Hoffman’s role.
Fight Club 
7:30 10 12:30
Based on Chuck Palahniuk’s novel of the same name, Fight Club is an Oscar-nominated film starring Brad Pitt and Edward Norton in some of the most bad-ass roles of their careers. Norton plays a man who is living a very quiet life until he meets soap salesman extraordinaire Tyler Durden, played by Pitt. The two men move in together soon after meeting and begin starting up fight clubs all across the United States. These clubs promote violence toward any and all authority. The film’s surprise ending is one of the best movie endings I’ve ever seen, set to a song by The Pixies. Fun fact: If you have never seen this movie, I challenge you to a fight.

A mysterious box among the advertisements in this issue has a border of sevens and simply states “Revelation is Coming!” Now this could mean anything, but I would put safe money on the idea that the printer rebelled against the real ad signaling the start of the robo-pocalypse.

Past Orientations apparently tended to be a lot more violent, as a photo shows first-years smashing an old car with a sledgehammer as part of a “traditional, crowd-drawing event.” No word on why it’s no longer a tradition, but I’m going to guess it was very bloody.

Dear Hoskins Brothers,
I’m a new first-year and I’m really excited to be here... I just wish my girlfriend back home felt the same. How do I get her to cool off and stop worrying about “us” so much?
Advice would be nice, 
—Longing in distance
Dear LID,
Here’s the deal: Most long-distance relationships don’t work out. “But we’re special! We really love each other! Blah blah blah!” No, you’re not special; that doesn’t help you stay in love with her, and the rest of that was just gibberish. The fact of the matter is that four years is a long time, and during these four years both of you will be changing a lot. Unless you’re one of the lucky few, it’s going to end.
Here’s how to put that end off as long as possible. First, call her a lot. Second, IM each other. It’s a good way to keep in contact since you’ll both be spending a lot of time on the computer. Third, and most importantly, trust her. The two of you will be going months without seeing one another, and trust is the only way to deal with that. There’s no way you can know what your partner is doing at all times, so you have to trust that she’s not running off with some oiled-up crew team member, and she has to trust that you’re not grinding on some drunk chick at a party. If you really care for each other, you need to trust each other.
Here’s hoping it doesn’t blow up in your face, 
—Brian Hoskins
Dear Hoskins Brothers,
I’m an incoming H&SS student and I think my OC is one of the sweetest guys I’ve ever met. How do I get him to ask me out and, most importantly, will he ever drop the “big brother” mindset enough to be interested?
Please help, 
—Artist in love
Dear AIL,
A “big brother mindset”? Seriously? You don’t know a lot about OCs. They’re not your brothers; they’re your friends. And like all your friends, some of them want to go out with you. Yes, there are a few OCs who use the honored, cherished position of Orientation counselor to hit on incoming first-years. I know, shocking. However, this is good news for you. A guy counselor on a girls’ floor? He’s probably looking for a cute first-year lady.
Now, there are a few easy ways you can continue this relationship. You probably have his number, so send him a text asking him for help buying books or showing you the best places to eat on campus. Remember, you’re new here — use that to your advantage. 
Hopefully he’ll be able to give you a real orientation to college life, 
­—Patrick Hoskins

Spend this semester shut in the Gates Hillman Complex working on one of the Millennium Prize problems. You won’t solve it, but you will avoid some other unpleasantness.
Lectures are boring; don’t go to them. Homework is hard; don’t do it. Exams are stressful; don’t study. You should be able to coast right through this semester, as long as you don’t mind failing.
This week, your ruling aspect is sloth. Next week, your ruling aspect will be pride. Revel in your newly sinful nature.
Your week will go surprisingly well, except for an incident with a 2x4 and a cuttlefish.
Your best friend from home will call and ask to borrow a shirt and pair of pants. Turn him or her down. If you don’t, it will end up involving arson and jail time.
After a relaxing summer, you return to find out that you left the gas on in your apartment. No fire started, but it will take weeks to get the smell out of your clothes.
Don’t let Jared Cohon and his goons fool you — hunting vermin with your bare hands is much better than signing up for a campus meal plan.
This year, instead of finding a date based on mutual attraction, simply select potential dates based on your ability to knock them out and then prop them in a seated position for your candlelight dinner.
When this semester’s workload gets you down (which it will, deeply and often), just think: “Only (on average) 50 more years until I won’t care because I will be relegated to a box in the ground by my ungrateful children.”
Start this semester off with a whimper, not a bang. Either adopt a puppy or sink slowly into an ever-deepening depression where the only thing you can do is eat Cheetos and build elaborate toothpick structures.
Find a Capricorn who has opted to build toothpick structures and assist them by inventing a structurally reinforced toothpick and a better adhesive.
You will develop a crippling case of insomnia, the only cure for which is to go on dates with every Scorpio you can find.

As students arrived at Carnegie Mellon last week, about 90 first-years moved into a new dorm, the Residence on Fifth, located at 4700 Fifth Ave. The latest addition to the Oakland community, the Residence has been favorably received for its “spaciousness, newness, and welcoming atmosphere,” according to Dawn Wang, the community advisor for the Residence. Nicknames such as “the Res” and “the Ritz” have already surfaced to pay homage to the relative grandeur of the dorm. 
As a part of the first-year community, the 90 students in the Residence have begun to bond over Orientation activities and event planning. For example, during the first week of classes, the Res will host a “Year One Week One” event on Tuesday night. The theme will be “Taste of Craig Street,” certain to attract more first-years to experience the new building for themselves. 
“It’s definitely a desire that our residents take ownership of exploring different communities that we have the opportunity to be a part of, and we can see that there have been steps taken in that direction already,” said Harold Kim, a resident assistant for the Residence.
Besides the novelty of the new dormitory, there are many features for first-years to enjoy. The Res is five stories tall and has air-conditioning and functioning fireplaces; most students are currently living in triple rooms. The building has complete access to wireless Internet. Inside, there is a round-the-clock service desk and the offices of several Housing and Dining members. 
“There are several lounges,” said John Hannon, the current housefellow for the Residence on Fifth, “including a piano lounge, exercise room, and club room.”
Perhaps the most intriguing amenity to students is the movie theater in the mezzanine level of the building that is equipped with theater-style reclining chairs with cup-holders and a flat-screen television. A sit-down dining area offered by CulinArt is anticipated for the spring semester — the first Carnegie Mellon dining location in Oakland, as well as a technology and collaborative learning center. These features are expected to prove useful to the entire Oakland community.
In regards to reported concerns over the lack of furniture due to a factory delay, all rooms were equipped last Monday with beds, dressers, and appliances. By last Wednesday, the desks, filing cabinets, and dining room tables had arrived. The phone lines have also been removed from rooms so that students will be encouraged to speak on cell phones and community phones.
Formerly the Forbes Hospice, the Residence on Fifth building was purchased by Carnegie Mellon for $7.5 million in May from the West Penn Allegheny Health System. Most of the 42 residents who were housed in the hospice are being temporarily placed in the Western Pennsylvania Hospital in Bloomfield. The hospice had been approved for 71 residents. The sale of the building also resulted in the loss of 47 full and part-time workers, reported by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
Carnegie Mellon is seeking to eventually use more of the apartment space offered by the building through possible re-zoning, providing more opportunities for first-years to experience being part of both Carnegie Mellon and the greater Oakland community.
Correction: Information regarding dining in the Residence on Fifth ("New students find home at Residence on Fifth", News, Aug. 23) was incorrect. Dining space is part of the Residence and does add to the community space and services of the building. However, under the current zoning, classification a dining location is not permitted. Therefore the statement regarding CulinArt operating a dining venue in the building was not correct.

President Barack Obama came to Carnegie Mellon on June 2 as the most recent in a series of notable political visitors, including Michelle Obama, John McCain, and Chelsea Clinton. Announced only four days in advance, the purpose of the president’s visit was to give a speech that centered on the economy, energy, education, and innovation.
In his speech, Obama was quick to declare that the steps his administration has taken have “succeeded in breaking the freefall of the economy,” pointing to increasing jobs over the last five months, recovered costs from supporting the automotive and financial industries, and those companies once again producing profit. However, with a recovering yet “fragile” economy, Obama spent the majority of his speech discussing how we can invest in the future of the country.
He made several references to improving America’s higher education system by making it more accessible to all students. “To achieve my goal of ensuring America once more has the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 2020, we passed a law that will make college more affordable by ending the unnecessary taxpayer subsidies that go to financial institutions for student loans,” he said. “It’s a bill that will also revitalize our community colleges, which are a career pathway to the children of so many working families.”
While the government works to create more college graduates and strengthen community colleges, Carnegie Mellon President Jared Cohon emphasized that Carnegie Mellon would not fit either of these two categories. “We are not going to grow in size. We won’t be graduating more students.... However, there’s a way that we are already helping,” Cohon said, referring to Obama’s mention of “educational software that’s as effective and engaging as a personal tutor.”
“We have already created what everybody acknowledges to be the best class of that force,” Cohon said. “We have already created OLI [Open Learning Initiative], which comes out of path-breaking research from our faculty, and this has received a lot of attention from the Obama administration, and they have been very supportive and will support us more to develop and migrate courses to community colleges.”
In terms of energy, Obama referenced the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico as a reason to push for the future of clean energy. “We also have to acknowledge that an America run solely on fossil fuels should not be the vision we have for our children and our grandchildren,” he said.
Lee Branstetter, an associate professor of economics and public policy, emphasized what Obama’s push for clean energy could mean for the U.S. economy. “Trying to make the political case for transition to [a] cleaner economy, it makes sense to emphasize job creation. The installation of windmills, solar power facilities, development of nuclear power plants, development of natural gas plants — all of this installation and construction is fairly labor-constructive. If you have a policy in place that leads to rapid introduction of these technologies, then yes, you will create these jobs.”
However, while Branstetter spoke in praise of a price on carbon emissions — “As an economist, I was pleased to see the emphasis the president placed on that policy,” he said — he believes there is still work to be done in bringing this message to the populace. “As the public is taking stock of the oil spill, this is a moment where [the] average American may be prompted to reconsider reliance on fossil fuel as a national energy strategy,” he said. “I also think it’s true that most voters do not understand what it means to put a price on carbon; what they hear is you are going to put a price on my import that makes it more expensive. There hasn’t been an effort to reach out to voters and educate them on the issue using language they can understand.”
In his focus on innovation as the route to change in economy, education, and energy, Obama aligned his message with the spirit of Pittsburgh. “And when that [steel] industry shrank and so many jobs were lost, who could have guessed that Pittsburgh would fare better than many other Rust Belt cities and re-emerge as a center for technology and green jobs, health care, and education?” he said. As with the G-20 summit held here in September 2009, Pittsburgh continues to serve as an example of success through the recent recession. Cohon is aware of the attention this brings to the university. “As the president said, Pittsburgh is a leading example of an industrial city that has transformed itself economically, and I think the administration recognizes that Carnegie Mellon is a major actor in that ongoing transformation,” Cohon said.
And while most reacted positively to the president’s appearance on campus, others were disappointed in the small size of the event and it being “invitation only.” Negative sentiment was also expressed by individuals outside of the campus community. Alex Lotorto, an East Liberty resident and Industrial Workers of the World member, held a large sign reading “FREE GAZA” outside the event. Lotorto hoped to express his discontent at the president’s visit and the policies that he has implemented.
The government’s response to Lotorto’s expression was not what he had hoped. “The state police and Secret Service showed up at my house to question my mom. I was upset and angry because it stressed her out and it is unfair that they would do something like that, and I’m looking into violation of my civil rights,” Lotorto said.
Regardless of the potential unfairness of Lotorto’s situation, the community was forced to deal with serious security surrounding the event, as well as an entire day of closed campus services in the University Center. These measures were deemed necessary, though, as the administration chose to host President Obama, positioning Carnegie Mellon as a center of innovation as it plans for the future of the country and the remainder of Obama’s term and beyond.

Carnegie Mellon’s incoming first-year students were quickly acclimated to the university’s strong environmental sustainability movement last Tuesday when a No Waste Dinner was held in Wiegand Gym during Orientation week. 
The meal, prepared and served by CulinArt, was sponsored by the Steinbrenner Institute, Carnegie Mellon’s Eco-Reps, and Carnegie Mellon Green Practices.
At Tuesday’s buffet-style dinner, which served over 1,500 first-years of the Class of 2014+ and hundreds of additional Orientation staff, students were asked to “take only as much food as they could eat.” Biodegradable plates, napkins, and cutlery made from Spudware were provided to reduce and eliminate post-consumer waste. There were several compost receptacles located around the gym, each attended by students and staff who facilitated the compost process. After students filled large green bags of compostables, they were taken to the composting areas outside the University Center.
“We hope we can get people more involved around campus, making sure our dorms and eateries are more sustainable,” said Eleanor Erney, a senior in business administration and co-coordinator of the Eco-Reps.
The group, whose priority is to promote environmental sustainability in residence halls, hosts informative and fun events for students every month. “We are doing little things that make a big difference,” Erney said.
Another group that was highly involved in the planning and execution of the Orientation No Waste Dinner was the graduate student organization Net Impact. Members of Net Impact represented Carnegie Mellon as delegates to the December 2009 Copenhagen environmental conference. Among those students was Justin Parisi, an MBA student also in the civil and environmental engineering master’s program. “We thought that this would be a great venue to showcase CMU’s capability and commitment to environmental responsibility for all of the incoming freshmen,” Parisi said. Barb Kviz, Carnegie Mellon’s environmental coordinator, agreed, saying, “Actions speak volumes.”
While the No Waste Dinner proved to be a successful promotion of Carnegie Mellon’s green practices, it was by no means the only environmental sustainability awareness campaign during Orientation. Along with publicized events held at the Solar Decathalon House in the Donner ditch, there were also several behind-the-scenes steps taken to make Orientation 2010 more environmentally friendly. Instead of bottled water, large jugs of water with biodegradable cups were provided during move-in and at all meals, and students were encouraged to use their refillable, customized Orientation 2010 water bottles. In total, Orientation 2010 used at least 5,000 fewer water bottles compared to past orientations. Food packaging was also minimized as much as possible throughout the week.
Currently, there are two prevalent pre-consumer compost collection sites on Carnegie Mellon’s campus: one located by the UC loading docks and one in the Resnik loading dock in Donner ditch. The compostable materials are collected from these sites by a company called AgRecycle, which takes them to be locally composted. For now, however, Carnegie Mellon students lack large-scale post-consumer compost opportunities on campus. Such facilities would require major expansion and improvement of the current composting system.
Shernell Smith, coordinator for Student Development and Eco-Reps adviser, pointed out that large-scale environmental sustainability programming will by no means end with Orientation. Citing the cooperation between the Office of Orientation and Housing and Dining to “green” last week’s first-year experience, Smith explained that there is a great potential for similar No Waste events to come, as long as there are students passionate about the cause.
“There’s an element of green in being plaid,” Smith said.

After encountering maintenance issues and difficulty hiring staff members in the Squirrel Hill area, a branch of the Dozen Bake Shop has opened on South Craig Street in Oakland.
“Most of our customers were from Carnegie Mellon University or the University of Pittsburgh, so moving to Oakland allowed us to centralize and better serve our customers,” said Kelly Marie McKenna, manager of the new Oakland store.
Dozen caters and delivers to a wide customer base in Squirrel Hill and Oakland, and with the new location, the bakery shop can deliver all of its goodies to students in their dorms.
The old location prevented the store from offering the same variety of goods that are sold at its other three branches. The Oakland store is now able to offer sandwiches, a larger variety of cookies, granola, a greater vegan selection, pot pies, macaroni salad, quiche, and more.
The wood paneling, clean interior design, and large display area of the new branch are reminiscent of an old-fashioned candy store. Big-bulb Christmas lights surround shelves of jars filled with sprinkles, cookies, and granola, as well as birthday boxes for individual or even a dozen Dozen cupcakes.
The refrigerated display showcases the macaroni salad, sandwich, and pot pie choices.
Dozen Bake Shop also offers coffee, tea, and other beverages — providing both 2 percent and soy milk upon request.
This new location has been so popular, “we actually ran out of cupcakes yesterday,” John Karlovic, a Dozen staff member, said. “All of our cupcakes are baked at the Lawrenceville location, then shipped to the branch stores.”
The Lawrenceville Dozen Bake Shop offers seating, free Wi-Fi, Sunday brunch, and a kitchen where customers can watch the bakers make and frost each cupcake.
“All of our goods are made without chemical preservatives, so we encourage our customers to enjoy them the same day they are purchased,” McKenna said. “We also use the freshest and finest local ingredients available to us.”
The fair trade coffee served is Commonplace Coffee from Indiana, Pa., and most of the milk, eggs, and other dairy products come from Turner Dairy Farms in Penn Hills.
While some customers may appreciate the effort to support local farms and businesses as well as the natural quality of the food, others are simply concerned with the taste.
“As long as it doesn’t cause any harm to my health and it tastes good, I think it’s all good.” Bahati Mutisya, a senior business management major in the Tepper School of Business said. “I feel that the move was very smart. I think Dozen addicts will be very excited.”
The store has recently been giving out free samples to attract customers to more than just the cupcakes. “I’ve only eaten the free cookies; they were amazing,” said Brandon Tyson, a senior information systems major.
The cupcakes are sold for $2.50 each, and the store offers a menu detailing what varieties of cupcakes are available on certain days.
“I’ve never been there, but I hear lots of good things about it. So I’m going to try it sometime in the future.” sophomore economics major Elise Lim said.

One-year extension granted to Cohon’s, Kamlet’s terms
Last Tuesday, the Board of Trustees unanimously voted to extend President Jared Cohon’s term for an additional year until June 2013. Mark Kamlet, the university’s executive vice president and provost, has also agreed to a one-year extension to his term, also bringing his term to a close in June 2013 as well.
“When the idea of staying on another year as president was presented to me, I was pleased to consider the proposal and to say yes to the opportunity. After 16 years as president, I will step down on June 30, 2013, knowing the innovations and accomplishments of this university are a source of pride for all of us,” Cohon said in a university press release. “I’m also pleased that my esteemed colleague Mark Kamlet has agreed to continue as executive vice president and provost, keeping our superb administrative team intact.”
Cohon and Kamlet have already made a considerable impact on the university. Cohon’s emphasis on global awareness, ethics, environmental studies, and innovation have substantially impacted the Carnegie Mellon curriculum. During their term, Carnegie Mellon has risen among the ranks to be considered one of the top-ranking universities in the world. Carnegie Mellon has also been able to extend its borders, opening up a sister campus in Doha, Qatar, as well as offering degree programs in Australia, Europe, and Latin America.
Dean of Student Affairs vacancy filled by Casalegno
After conducting an extensive search to fill the recently vacated position of dean of Student Affairs, the administration has successfully found a replacement in Gina Casalegno. 
Casalegno, who has been a university employee for the past eight years, was until recently serving as the interim director of the Career and Professional Development Center and assistant dean of Student Affairs. 
Casalegno also previously held the position of coordinator and director of the Office of Student Activities and was a housefellow for London Terrace and Shirley Apartments.
Casalegno’s candidacy was announced late in the search, and she was the only internal candidate considered.
“In leading the Division of Student Affairs, Gina’s deep and abiding commitment to our students will continue to impact the whole of our community,” said Michael Murphy, vice president for Campus Affairs, in a Carnegie Mellon press release. “She firmly believes in our mission and in the reality that the intensive academic life of the institution is entirely consistent with an engaged and active life outside the classroom, lab, studio, or stage.”
Editor's Note: Gina Casalegno served as the adviser for The Tartan until fall 2009.

Each year, Carnegie Mellon welcomes a new class of students to campus. This year’s first-year class, the class of 2014+, is not only the largest class to arrive onto campus—it is also one of the most unique. Upperclassmen may know that the class of 2014+ faced some of the toughest odds for acceptance yet, but here are a few facts that may be a surprise:
Expected incoming class size: 1,470
The number of incoming students named Michael (the most common first name): 33
The number of letters in the longest name of an incoming student: 17
The number of applicants who submitted over nine teacher recommendations: 32
The number of incoming students who had straight As all through high school: 397

With the Deepwater Horizon oil well capped and the headlines thinning out, it looks as though things may be reaching a more constant, if not necessarily normal, state in the United States Gulf Coast region. But as the discussions subside about the Deepwater Horizon oil rig spill in the Gulf, it is important not to forget what we can learn from this disaster. Lessons learned with this most recent spill need to be remembered and applied to oil rigs around the world.
On April 20, there was an explosion on Transocean’s Deepwater Horizon rig, which was licensed to BP. Within two days, the $560 million rig sank to the bottom of the ocean. People began to realize how serious a problem the well was becoming as oil continued to gush. The well was capped by mid-July, but after over 100 days of leaking oil, the U.S. government estimates 4.9 billion barrels of oil were released.
So now it’s only a matter of making sure this never happens again, right?
While this of course seems like a simple enough concept, it is much harder in practice. In fact, 30 years ago, the IXTOC rig, also located on the Gulf Coast — although in much shallower waters — exploded, causing millions of barrels of oil to leak into the ocean. Sound familiar?
The fact of the matter is that we aren’t going to stop drilling. Our economy runs on energy and, for now, a lot of that power comes from oil. But the huge demand for power shouldn’t stop regulation and a strong focus on safety. Because the Deepwater Horizon spill lasted so long, it is easy to forget about what happened when it all started: Safety lapses caused the death of 11 people, as well as lasting damage to the Gulf. Without a strong commitment to research, regulation, and safety, it might not be that long until a disaster like the one this summer is repeated.

Google is no longer the antithesis of evil. Instead, Google has matured into a proper American company — one whose shareholders hold more sway than inner morality.
The company once heralded for its mantra of “Don’t be evil” recently tossed itself headfirst into the net neutrality war. A framework proposal written jointly with Verizon (an ultimate evil when it comes to net neutrality) was released on Aug. 9 and has caused a firestorm among net neutrality activists. Why? Google has turned evil; that’s why.
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is on the precipice of defining Internet service providers (ISPs) as telecommunication rather than information companies. This action would give the FCC much more power to regulate the actions of these ISPs. However, the FCC has lacked a clear framework to base regulations upon. Verizon and Google want to shape such a framework.
The idea behind net neutrality is to prevent ISPs from routing specific information based on price. An example of this routing would be Comcast signing a deal with Facebook to allow Facebook.com to load very quickly. As a part of the deal, Comcast would also purposefully delay NBC and YouTube to a slow crawl. The consumer would be choked by the big-money websites, leaving nonprofits and blogs to die from incredibly slow load times.
No longer is Google determined to fight for consumer rights. This is a company whose GMail allowed a gigabyte of storage before competitors offered 10 megabytes. This is a company that allows employees to devote 20 percent of their time to whatever they desire. For years, Google has fought for net neutrality regulations. Now it has chosen to support corporate greed.
The Google-Verizon framework states that a company would be “prohibited from engaging in undue discrimination against any lawful Internet content.” However, when it comes to wireless service — where standard Internet is heading in the very near future — this framework asserts that “[its] unique technical and operational characteristics” exempt wireless Internet providers from adhering to net neutrality regulations.
Get ready to pay for premium content on the Internet. This unfortunate proposal allows “additional or differentiated services” to be hawked by ISPs. Rather than allowing the Internet to regulate its own content that can be sent, providers want to be able to charge consumers for the privilege of accessing currently free content.
Google’s framework would create a non-governmental body to oversee lawful adherence by the service providers — effectively giving the corporations the power to regulate themselves. The maximum penalty the FCC could charge a service provider would be $2 million — chump change for these companies.
Google has a new motto: Be relatively evil.

The Web is dead. Or at least Chris Anderson, the editor-in-chief of Wired magazine, has stated that the Web is dead. And by the Web, he doesn’t mean the Internet, he means HTML. And actually he only means the free parts of HTML. And actually just the free parts that are also indexed by Google. That is the Web that is dying. Oh, right, and dying just means being eclipsed by other digital transmissions. Got it? That is Wired’s cover story: The reason this matters is because this imminent death of the Web is a loss of freedom; it is the end of the creation-based, anyone-can-contribute, non-corporate-controlled part of the Internet.
It has been covered at length, online, how the Web is not dead. Sarcastic tweets about the dying Web were propagated by the hundreds; blogs shouted their complaints about the hyperbole, bringing commenters’ sagacious wisdom into the fight. In short, the Web erupted in lively response before subscribers even received the magazine.
Wired’s September 2010 edition with its toxic orange-red cover and stark black Helvetica text (“The Web is dead.”) arrived on my doorstep days after the digital response calmed. The cover story itself is broken into two halves: Anderson’s, on white, explaining that the Web is dying, and freelance journalist Michael Wolff’s, set in parallel on red, explaining why this is supposedly happening. The format is nearly identical to the Web version, though online readers don’t have to locate page 118 to read the article and then complete a 38-page jump to finish it. (The conclusions of both stories are set as solid blocks of text across from ads for air-purifiers and digital scales.)
But the pain and delay of reading this story in print is hardly worth it — the real value is in Tim O’Reilly and John Battelle’s published debates and the discussion in the dreaded (and presently heaving its last death throes) blogosphere are the real value. The cover is a gimmick and an incredibly successful conversation starter.
And so could be another cover this month. Time magazine, that venerable American institution, put author Jonathan Franzen on the cover of the Aug. 23 issue. If his name doesn’t immediately bring you to tears and Forum tirades, it is probably because, like I mentioned, he is an author. A writer of words. A filler of paper books. He is also, as Time has reminded us, the first writer to grace their cover in a decade, the last being Stephen King in March 2000.
Franzen is accompanied by, as popular book blog The Millions put it, “the Franzen headline: ‘Great American Novelist’ — a pretty transparent bit of attention-mongering.” 
Now it is certainly unclear if Time is the arbiter of great novelists in this country, but Franzen’s The Corrections won the National Book Award and was a New York Times Best Book of The Year, a Pulitzer finalist, and so nearly an Oprah Book Club pick (he declined) that maybe he deserves the title. But however these choices are made, Time has decided to support Franzen, because beyond their declining circulation numbers, they are aware people do not need to read the magazine to see the cover. The cover is free; the cover is viewable on newsstands; the cover is copied and pasted across the Internet. And whether it was a slow news week or they thought Franzen would be good competition against the flag-covered Newsweek, Time is supporting real literature — simply ushering Americans to notice that Franzen’s new novel Freedom comes out in just over a week, and we should be ready to promote it to the top of our autumn reading lists.
That is, if we even have reading lists anymore, because while Wired didn’t mention it this month, print is also dead. In fact very many things are dead: Literature is certainly dead, but Apple also died over a decade ago; Silicon Valley is dead; Microsoft is clearly dying; Google Wave is actually dead; dozens of smartphones have killed dozens of other smartphones and all of them have killed the iPhone; Facebook is dead; privacy is dead because of Facebook; and journalism is dead. And these journalists and editors who continue to practice their dead or dying art (including us) continue to lament the death of things which have never really died at all.
Time, decried by many as a dying magazine, has decided to use its cover to highlight, for whatever reasons, a reasonably good American author. Hopefully, some of us will actually go pick up his upcoming novel — I certainly will. Wired has decided to use its cover to start a firestorm, backing its argument up with some particularly strange semantics but regardless receiving a lot of attention. And in both cases, apart from seemingly every institution we know in society being dead, two media organizations have proven the magazine cover is still alive.

One of the most talked-about stories of the summer was the resignation of General Stanley McChrystal, formerly head of the NATO-led mission to Afghanistan. An article published in Rolling Stone magazine, written by Michael Hastings, uncovered that McChrystal and his staff did not think too highly of Vice President Joe Biden and other higher-ups in the Obama administration.
The article and its revelations kicked up a political maelstrom, and after a much-hyped meeting with the president, McChrystal resigned from his post. But this also resulted in a nationwide debate about the ethics of journalism and whether Hastings took undue advantage of McChrystal by publishing potentially off-the-record comments. Journalists supported their colleague, arguing that the rule regarding such statements is ambiguous and should not stop someone from breaking a story. But I am not completely convinced.
The army is fighting a war in one of the world’s harshest environments. Resources are limited and public opinion is unfavorable. In short, it’s not going so well. In this mess, journalists and reporters are scavenging for stories and trying to make a career for themselves. The amount of negativity that spews out of Afghanistan is disheartening, and despite all its efforts the army has had a lot of difficulty in putting a positive spin on the information.
To counter this, the army tries to reach out to journalists like Hastings, who was given an opportunity to work closely with McChrystal and his staff. This led to inevitable informal interaction between the parties, and this is where the problem began. The army (naively, some might say) assumed that anything said after a few beers would be secret, while the opportunistic journalists were busy writing everything down. While journalists have a right to go after the truth, this was just a standard war report spiced up with internal office politics. I am sure Hastings has problems with his boss as well.
It’s not like McChrystal admitted to weapons trafficking or war profiteering. He and his staff expressed their private opinions about individuals that they interact with, in a forum where they felt safe. Instead of using the information to formulate a better picture of the attitude of the army, Hastings published a dramatic article titled “The Runaway General.” The fact that he used these scraps of information to ruin McChrystal’s career speaks more of his desperation than his journalistic skill. None of this excuses the fact that McChrystal should have been more careful, but to expect our leaders to be perfect is a ridiculous demand.
I hope that the army gives a cold shoulder to journalists who are concerned solely with their own growth. After he broke the story, Hastings was mentioned in places from Fox News to Al-Jazeera, securing his 15 minutes of fame. Maybe he will be better off writing for People magazine.

This article first appeared on The Tartan Online on Monday, June 7.
A relatively small group of Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh leaders watched as President Barack Obama delivered an address in Wiegand Gym on Wednesday, June 2. Though I, like most students, was not in Pittsburgh for the event (and would not have received an invitation anyway), reading the transcript of the president’s remarks impressed upon me a disappointing fact: The candidate who spoke of the audacity of hope has, as president, adopted too many of the worst aspects of Washington politics.
As I read Obama’s address, I was dismayed by the overwhelmingly partisan rhetoric he used, particularly in the first half. While a post-partisan society is likely impossible and at the very least many years away, candidate Obama seemed able to focus more on a hopeful future than a disappointing present. Despite the ostensible theme of Wednesday’s speech being on building a foundation for the future, I saw mostly a series of attacks on the Republican Party.
Of course, it might have been hard to tell that Obama was criticizing the Republicans, since he refused to utter their name for almost the entirety of his 40-minute address. While there are over 20 references to “the other party” or “they” (pointedly referring to said other party), there are a grand total of two times that the word “Republican” was said. Mr. President, I know who the other party is, and I know you do, too. Not saying their name won’t make them go away. I’m sorry. The same holds true for “the previous administration.” This may be a common trick used by speechwriters, but Obama should set a higher standard.
The president’s hide-and-seek game with the word “Republican” unfortunately was not the only embarrassingly partisan occasion in his speech. Toward the middle of the address, Obama said, “But to be fair, a good deal of the other party’s opposition to our agenda has also been rooted in their sincere and fundamental belief about the role of government.... It’s [a belief] that basically offers two answers to every problem we face: more tax breaks for the wealthy and fewer rules for corporations.” I think the White House speechwriters have a different dictionary than I. Last time I checked, none of the definitions of “fair” is equivalent to oversimplifying one’s opponents’ position to absurdity.
Partisan rhetoric did not comprise all of Wednesday’s address. Yet even when Obama discussed his accomplishments and plans for the future, the ideas seemed stale and weak. This was a defensive speech couched as forward-looking. At this stage, almost nobody believes that fossil fuels are a long-term energy solution. Cap-and-trade legislation — one way of taxing carbon emissions — has been part of the president’s platform for years. After torturous debate, health care reform has been passed, yet it formed a significant section of Obama’s address. Perhaps he was playing to the UPMC representatives in the audience, or maybe he became so used to talking about it that he doesn’t remember how to stop.
At Carnegie Mellon, a center of innovation and research, the president should have renewed his vision and inspiration for the future instead of giving what was ultimately a cliched and political speech. Obama has faced political setbacks and a series of crises since he took office, but he should continue to look forward.
Michael Kahn (mkahn@) is Forum editor and wonders if he can get credit on exams for writing ambiguous answers and claiming they are rhetorically superior.

We published an editorial on April 12, 2010 that asked if anonymity, epitomized by Wikileaks, was the future of journalism. We argued that the organization deserves “the respect of people everywhere who believe information should be free.” Yet in the months since we first supported the publication of the now-infamous “Collateral Murder” video, Wikileaks has gone from a minor inconvenience to a serious concern of governments around the world. The most controversial of its recent actions was — in concert with The New York Times, The Guardian, and Der Spiegel — publishing 77,000 classified reports from Afghanistan.
We do not oppose the release of these documents simply because the American government decided they should be classified. We do not oppose the release because it could be embarrassing to the United States, to Afghanistan, or to any other political, corporate, or social entity. We do, however, oppose the seeming lack of concern Wikileaks and its leaders — founder Julian Assange in particular — have for the unintended consequences of their actions. 
One would think that someone who named a video “Collateral Murder” would realize that actions can have collateral damage. By releasing tens of thousands of documents without thoroughly cleaning them of the names of Afghan translators and contacts, Assange and his organization are responsible, albeit indirectly, for any reprisals taken against them and their families.
Respected journalistic organizations follow a set of ethical guidelines that protect sources and weigh the value of a story against its capacity for harm. They have a structure of editorial responsibility that ensures anything that goes to print is reviewed by multiple people. If Wikileaks has such a structure, it is hidden within its secret organizational system. Wikileaks has no accountability except public disapproval. 
As long as Assange, and by extension Wikileaks, continues to take actions without fully appreciating their consequences and ethical implications, he will remain only an information broker, not a journalist.

While others at The Tartan, the White House, and the Pentagon may claim that Wikileaks has acted irresponsibly, I disagree. I believe Wikileaks could hardly have acted more responsibly in releasing this information. They worked with three well-regarded news organizations, giving them weeks of access for thorough research — and which of those offered to help them cleanse the logs? Wikileaks (albeit indirectly) contacted the U.S. government to ask for assistance; the fact that the organization even asked was vehemently denied and later admitted, and the government still has not agreed to assist.
Wikileaks has only a handful of volunteers. They could have spent years and would still have been faulted for not catching every name. We are now nearly a month out, and name the group that has actually helped redact names in the remaining documents.

Welcome back, Tartans! It’s been refreshing to see so many familiar and new faces on campus.
Thanks to the hard work of the Orientation and Student Life staffs, the first-year students’ first week at Carnegie Mellon went exceptionally well. Not only were Orientation events well-attended — first-years were out on campus playing pickup ultimate Frisbee and soccer with upperclassmen and attending impromptu barbecues — but also, it is already apparent that the new students are learning from seasoned upperclassmen exactly what it means to be a Tartan.
Orientation week always reminds me why I’m proud to be a Tartan. It is impossible to walk around campus during Orientation and not feel the excitement radiating from both students and staff. Coming back to campus was like finding a $20 bill in the pocket of a pair of jeans you haven’t worn in a while. You might know the feeling I’m talking about — when you remember how good it feels to leave class after acing a test, to pause and catch up with an old friend on the Cut, and to discover that Skibo has your favorite fro-yo flavor... all at the same time. After that Wonder Years-like flashback, you’re left with the feeling that you couldn’t think of anywhere in the world you would rather be than right where you are.
Part of the reason Jarrett and I ran for student body president and student body vice president last year was to make these warm and fuzzy feelings about Carnegie Mellon more common for both the incoming and current classes at the university. This fall, student government will be working on a variety of initiatives that will be primarily concerned with improving campus and the overall student experience.
I am especially looking forward to the revamped Tartan Rewards Program and the launching of the Great Ideas campaign. A complete calendar of Tartan Rewards events will be announced in the upcoming weeks. We will also be working to improve undergraduate-graduate student cohesion, continuing to promote the improvement of Carnegie Mellon facilities, and encouraging students to step out into the Pittsburgh community.
I encourage everyone to check the student government Executive Branch website at stugov.andrew.cmu.edu to stay up to date with our initiatives and programs.
Jarrett Adams, SBP
Kate Smith, SBVP

We begin the year with a strike against one of our editorial board’s most beloved topics: university communication — more specifically, the failings of our university and its administration to communicate with its faculty, staff, and students. While we wish we could call this pre-emptive, we have an unresolved issue to deal with from the past summer.
New students may notice a stunning green Astroturf soccer field awaiting them through the fences at the corner of Forbes Avenue and Margaret Morrison Street. However, the Carnegie Mellon denizens who remained in Pittsburgh over the summer witnessed machinery come in and tear up the previous grass field with no advance warning. They saw a field transformed into a wasteland of dirt and gravel hills. They saw large trees torn from the ground. They questioned what was coming — was the administration putting up a new building, fixing a water main break, or just mutilating the ground for sport?
When the Gates Hillman Complex construction began, giant printed canvases were affixed to fences around the whole perimeter announcing this future landmark in computer science, and while those at times seemed a bit more self-congratulatory than necessary, a single sign, a rendering, or an announcement that a new field was being installed would be appreciated. On the fence surrounding Warner Hall, there are a few small signs explaining why the plaza is being renovated. This is an improvement over the mystery surrounding the IM field, but the university should aim higher.
While we certainly appreciate the continued efforts to improve our campus landscape and facilities, we hope that Carnegie Mellon’s administration can work to inform those who might question a bulldozer tearing up the earth or the sudden appearance of an improved sports field when returning from summer break.
