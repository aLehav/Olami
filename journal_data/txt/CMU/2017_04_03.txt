Men’s Tennis
The seventh-ranked Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team traveled to Kenyon College to face 24th-ranked Kenyon and 26th-ranked Lewis & Clark College. The Tartans earned two victories, 5–0 versus Lewis & Clark and 5–4 versus Kenyon, to improve to 13–7 on the year.
Against Lewis & Clark, the Tartans led 3–0 after doubles play with sophomores Daniel Levine and Vayum Arora, earning the first point at first doubles with an 8–1 win. Junior Jeffrey Chen and sophomore Chaz Downing won 8–5 at second doubles while senior Kenny Zheng and first-year Mark Prettyman won 8–3 at third doubles.
With the match being played on four indoor courts and to decision, the Tartans earned wins at second and fourth singles to end the match by a 5–0 score. Earning the victories was Downing at second singles, 6–4, 6–3, and senior Kiril Kirkov at fourth singles, 6–1, 6–3.
Against Kenyon, the Tartans rallied from down one to hold a 2–1 advantage after doubles play, earning wins at second and third doubles. The second doubles team of Chen and Downing forced a tiebreaker which they won 7–4 to earn what was a pivotal point for the team. Levine’s match at first singles was first to finish, as he won 6–1, 6–0 to give the Tartans a 3–1 lead.
Kenyon tied the score at three-all with wins at second and fourth singles and took a 4–3 lead with a victory at third singles. Kirkov closed out his sixth singles match with a 6–2, 6–2 win before Arora earned match point with a 7–5, 7–6 (7–3) win at fifth singles. Arora trailed 5–1 in the first set before winning six straight games.
The Tartans will next face the no. 16 University of Mary Washington on Saturday, April 8 and no. 20 Johns Hopkins University on Sunday, April 9. Both matches will be played at home in Pittsburgh.

**Men’s Golf **
The Carnegie Mellon men’s golf team carded a final round of 298 at the Wynlakes Intercollegiate in Montgomery, AL, on Tuesday, March 28, and finished third with a 36-hole score of 589 (291–298). The field of 13 teams, including five teams ranked in the top seven nationally, was won by the host Huntingdon College, ranked first nationally, with a score of 567 (280–287). The University of Texas at Tyler, ranked second nationally, placed second with a score of 578 (296–282). The 36-hole event was played at the par 72, 6,979-yard Wynlakes Golf & Country Club.
Senior George Qian continued his school record performance on Tuesday, as he carded a two-under par 70 for a 36-hole score of seven-under par 137 (67–70). The senior finished second on the individual leaderboard, as Huntingdon’s Addison Lambeth carded a 10-under par 134 to win individual medalist honors. Qian’s two-round score of 137 breaks the school record score of 139 set by junior Adrian Del Bosque in 2015 at the Edward Jones Shootout at The Links at Spring Church.
Junior Nikhil Mohan finished eighth individually in the field of 80 golfer with a one-over par 145 (70–75). Senior Brad Jennette carded back-to-back rounds of 76 to finish the tournament at 152. Del Bosque ended play carding a 155 (78–77) while sophomore Patrick Tan recorded a 36-hole score of 158 (78–80). The Tartans had one individual enter the invitational, as sophomore Adrian Berger shot a 158 (81–77).
On Thursday, the Tartans placed first at the annual Carnegie Mellon Spring Invitational for the second consecutive season after carding a 304. The 18-hole event was held at the par 70 Longue Vue Club in Verona, PA. Top individual medalist honors went to Mohan who fired a four-over par 74. The win marked Mohan’s first collegiate individual medalist honor. Qian and Jennette tied for second individually in a field of 54 golfers, as both entered the clubhouse with a 76. Berger placed fifth after carding a 78 on Thursday while Del Bosque finished with an 82.
The Tartans had three individuals play in the invitational with senior Alex Woodward leading the trio with a score of 82. Senior Alexander Pomerantz fired an 83 and sophomore Nicholas Moreno carded an 86.

As April begins, the NFL’s free agency period, which started at the beginning of the new league year on Thursday, March 9, has long since blown past the frenzy that sees established players negotiate new contracts for either new teams or their old one. The period is built on the premise that teams can potentially find a centerpiece in establishing a new identity or acquire the last piece of the puzzle for a Super Bowl run.
While free agency has more often than not ended up letting down the lofty aspirations teams and their fan bases have, huge signings like the Green Bay Packers’ 1993 acquisition of defensive end Reggie White, the New Orleans Saints’ 2006 decision to bring on quarterback Drew Brees, and the Denver Broncos’ 2012 victory in the bidding for quarterback Peyton Manning have been able to effect substantial changes for the teams that best utilize the opportunity for growth.
With the frenzy of the first days and weeks now in the rear view mirror, it’s time to see what acquisitions ahead of the annual draft may help or hurt their teams in the upcoming year.
Carolina Panthers sign OT Matt Kalil
Drafted fourth overall by the Minnesota Vikings in 2012, offensive tackle Matt Kalil was expected to be a solid force on the team’s offensive line. During his rookie year, it sure seemed like that would be the case, as Kalil earned his way to the Pro Bowl that year.
Unfortunately for the Vikings, his play has become inconsistent in recent years, and an injury that forced him to undergo season-ending surgery last September gave the team an easy reason to let him walk.
Despite the downward trend of Kalil’s performance, the Carolina Panthers decided to pay him big, offering a 5-year, $55.5 million deal. Certainly, the Panthers are in need of help.
A year removed from taking on the Broncos in Super Bowl 50, the Panthers went 6–10 in 2016, and quarterback Cam Newton certainly regressed, throwing 16 fewer touchdowns and four more interceptions compared to the prior year.
“He’s going to have to rebuild his confidence. I mean, he was shook. Let’s be honest. I’m not going to lie about that,” Panthers head coach Ron Rivera said. “The young man went through a tough time, and we went through a tough time. [The struggles go] back to ‘you’ve got to protect your quarterback and put playmakers around him.’ We’ve got to do that. I’d like to believe that we’re doing those things right now that we need to do in the offseason.”
While many commentators questioned giving Kalil a payday that puts him among the highest paid offensive tackles in the league, it is entirely possible that Kalil can fit in the Panthers’ scheme and provide the shoring up for a solid offensive line that can give Newton better protection. After all, Panthers center Ryan Kalil has certainly performed at a high level for the team. Good chemistry could work wonders for the Panthers looking to turn things around. 
Cleveland Browns sign G Kevin Zeitler
Oh, Cleveland. You’re so laughably terrible that your actual team left your city in 1996, became the Baltimore Ravens, and went on to earn two Super Bowl victories. That certainly doesn’t stop the NFL and the Browns’ fanbase from pretending that the team merely suspended operations for a few years before returning to compete in 1999. With only two winning seasons in 2002 and 2007, the current Cleveland Browns are in as laughably terrible a position as they have been for most of the past 18 years. Still, if the 0–16 Detroit Lions of 2008 managed to turn themselves into a mildly respectable football team, it stands to reason that the Browns might one day be able to do the same.
Known for having 26 different starting quarterbacks in the past 18 seasons, stability at the position is something the current Browns have never had. With no true star waiting to take the reins, it is clear that the Browns need a different foundation in their efforts to become relevant. In a year where offensive tackles seem to be high in demand without many top options perceived in the draft, former Cincinnati Bengals guard Kevin Zeitler took home a 5-year, $60 million contract that puts him at the highest paid guard in NFL history. While the contract is rich for a player considered good but not the best, it seems like whoever steps into Cleveland’s quarterback situation will find themselves with a more than adequate offensive line. It just might be something that finally helps the Browns climb out of the AFC North cellar. Or not.
Jacksonville Jaguars sign CB A.J. Bouye, DE Calais Campbell, S Barry Church
While certainly not Browns/2008 Lions levels of terrible, the Jacksonville Jaguars have struggled to compete in recent years. Quarterback Blake Bortles has shown signs of potential brilliance, but the team ended up 3–13 last year.
The Jaguars seemed to emphasize defense this free agency period, snatching up former Houston Texans cornerback A.J. Bouye, former Arizona Cardinals defensive end Calais Campbell, and former Dallas Cowboys safety Barry Church. Campbell’s 4-year, $60 million contract may be high for a 31-year old, but pass rushers have been known to get plenty higher, as evidenced by the 4-year $62 million contract the New York Giants gave to defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul, whose performance has fallen off since a 2015 fireworks injury. Combined with Bouye and Church, the Jaguars look poised to challenge a weak AFC South.
Chicago Bears sign QB Mike Glennon
With quarterback Jay Cutler released and now enjoying his time off perhaps a bit too much, the Chicago Bears need to look for their future quarterback.
Former Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Mike Glennon is not likely to be that guy. Though his 3-year $45 million deal gives him what seems like a high $15 million a year average, this would put him around the 20-25th highest quarterback salaries in 2017. Glennon was once thought up as a potential star in Tampa Bay, but a 2,608-yard performance with 19 touchdowns and nine interceptions during his rookie season led the team to bring in quarterback Josh McCown as a competitor before quarterback Jameis Winston was drafted first overall in the 2015 NFL Draft.
Glennon’s inconsistency cost him his job in Tampa Bay, but this may still be redemption for him in Chicago. Buccaneers head coach Dirk Koetter continues to say positive things about Glennon, and Bears head coach John Fox certainly believes in him enough to hand him the starting role. The talent surrounding Glennon in the offensive line and the receiving corps is questionable, and it certainly seems like they will be his undoing. Still, it is possible that Glennon could resurrect his career in the Windy City.

Hae Young Noh, a Carnegie Mellon civil and environmental engineering assistant professor, recently won the NSF CAREER Grant for her research on “Structures as Sensors.” Her research uses small cylindrical sensors located at strategic positions to measure vibrations generated by human activity, then extrapolates information about their quality of life. 
She states that each person’s gait is distinct enough to be used as identifiers. “Each step,” she explains, “is like a mini earthquake with its own epicenter.” The gait of a person can be characterized by various parameters such as balance, stability, strength, and speed. The vibrations created by steps hold more information such as location, identity, level of activity, health status, and even mood. Although she is still fine-tuning the data related to mood, Noh argues that mood is very certainly reflected in one’s gait. “A depressed person walks very differently from one that isn’t,” she remarked. 
Vibrations are also generated by machines and other household objects. For example, when someone turns on a tap, the water running through the pipes generates a characteristic vibration. Thus, these sensors receive a lot of information about many different actions occurring within a building. Processing this data is, in Noh’s opinion, one of the most challenging aspects of the project. She said, “The challenge lies in the data analysis and the signal processing. It is a very convoluted signal, giving us information about people, about structures and about the environment. Now that we have all this data, how do we take what we want? That is something I’m working on.” 
Noh explained that, at a very basic level, the data works like an identification match. One can look for a “gait match” in a database, and if the match doesn’t exist then the person is unauthorized in the building. This has several different targeted applications such as security. Another application would be in the retail industry where it could be used for customer behavior analysis. Furthermore, it could give information about road traffic and the climate. Another application for this technology would be to get data about various structures. For instance, when installed in railway structures it could be used to get data about the faults in the tracks as the vibrations change. 
This technology has been developed keeping the specific needs of nursing homes for the elderly in mind. Noh works with the Vincentian Nursing Home and the Baptist Nursing Homes in Pittsburgh, so she explained, “there is someone whose gait suggests that the quality of their walk is deteriorating and they should probably slow down and take rest. In that case, the system would alert a caretaker who could handle the situation. Thus, the person in question doesn’t have to completely be confined to a wheelchair to prevent falls in case there aren’t enough caretakers to shadow them all the time.” 
Noh’s research is particularly advantageous because of its noninvasive nature. Cameras and microphones record very personal and sensitive data by nature, which causes several people to reject them as a method of information gathering. Secondly, wearables such as smartwatches require people to place a device on themselves, which could be seen as an effort on the wearers’ part. Noh reflects that this sensing system requires minimum interaction from the users with the system itself. Regarding this project, Noh predicts that the commercialization of this technology would take five to six years, and the technology for advanced mood-based and medical analysis would take a little longer. 
Noh said, “It is such a convenient way of discovering so much. It is seemingly impossible in the beginning, when one sees all the information and the noise stored in one signal. But, then it all comes together and makes so much sense.” While reflecting on this technology in improving quality of life, Noh explained, “this research has so much of a human-aspect to it. It is very rewarding to work with people in such a tangible and direct manner.”

A team of researchers from the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) and Carnegie Mellon used a new mathematical theorem to show that Pennsylvania’s congressional districts are gerrymandered. 
Gerrymandering was described by President Obama in his 2016 State of the Union address as when “politicians pick their voters, and not the other way around.” It is the biased process of re-drawing political districts to ensure that one party gets a majority of votes, and it is often used by the majority party in state legislatures to ensure re-election. 
Two Carnegie Mellon researchers Alan Frieze, professor of mathematical sciences, and Wesley Pegden, assistant professor of mathematical sciences, worked with Maria Chikina of Pitt. They proved a new mathematical theorem that determines whether a given sample is nonrandom, and therefore biased. 
The theorem depends on Markov chains, algorithms that can be used to develop models of randomness. A Markov chain begins with a fixed object and evolves it through a step-by-step process, making small, random changes to the object at each step. Markov chains are frequently used to model random processes in fields like thermodynamics, statistics, and genetics. They also form the basis of Google’s algorithm for ordering search results. 
The researchers applied their Markov chain research to Pennsylvania’s congressional districts. If the congressional districts were unbiased, they would resemble the map produced by the algorithm. This process was not intended to create optimal districting, but to provide a reliable test for bias within the current districts. To ensure accurate results, the researchers gave their algorithm constraints that congressional redistricting should ideally abide by — each district must be contiguous, contain roughly the same number of people and maintain a reasonable ratio of perimeter to area. 
In each step of the algorithm, one precinct was chosen at random to be changed over to another district, as long as the change would still adhere to the imposed constraints. Starting with the current congressional district map, the researchers applied the algorithm for over a trillion steps. 
The map randomly generated by the algorithm was significantly different from the real map. “There is no way that this map could have been produced by an unbiased process,” Pegden said of the current districts. 
These results confirm mathematically what political scientists have been arguing for years — districting has become a biased system allowing those in power to remain in power. Though gerrymandering is present in almost all states, Pennsylvania has been one of the worst offenders since its last redistricting in 2010; the state’s seventh district appeared on the Washington Post’s list of the country’s top ten most gerrymandered congressional districts. Gerrymandering has caused drastic bias in Pennsylvania’s state legislature. 
The Democratic and Republican parties both received close to 50 percent of votes in the 2012 and 2014 elections, but the gerrymandered districts (decided by a Republican state legislature) gave 72 percent of Pennsylvania’s congressional seats to Republicans. 
Efforts to reform congressional districting are usually faced with partisan groups working to maintain or increase the impact of gerrymandering. Analysis and investigation like the research above constitute an important component of the fight for honesty in state legislature. Former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger started a campaign against gerrymandering
The research was published online in February in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

A study by Carnegie Mellon researchers has shown what many presumed: we forge our own realities. George Loewenstein, professor of economics and psychology, Russel Golman, assistant professor of social and decision sciences, and David Hagmann, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Social and Decision Sciences, published their work in the Journal of Economic Literature. The study showed that people avoid information that disagrees with their world view, but accept information that supports it. 
People even interpret contradictory information in ways that support their views. For example, many considered the U.S. Congress’ acquittal of Hillary Clinton for a use of a private email server as evidence that Congress is corrupt.
Information avoidance can be detrimental. It can manifest as a reason why people do not go for medical screenings, why they reject scientific information, or why they accept unfounded facts. The inability to address contradicting views leads to poor decision-making, which is why economists are interested in researching it. Loewenstein elaborated, saying, “People often avoid information that could help them to make better decisions if they think the information might be painful to receive.” 
The study suggests that people create their own realities to live the way they wish. “Those who do not take a genetic test can enjoy their life until their illness can’t be ignored, an inflated sense of our own abilities can help us to pursue big and worthwhile goals, and not looking at our financial investments when markets are down may keep us from selling in a panic,” said Golman on people’s motivations. 
Advertisers take advantage of this by making people think they are happy, especially as a result of a specific product. Two of the most infamous examples of information denial in science are the rejection of climate change and the acceptance of a relationship between vaccines and autism. While the former has been confirmed time and time again, the latter has been completely disproved; yet, people choose to ignore scientific fact in favor of their own beliefs. 
This affects not only them, but the health and security of future generations and people in their communities. Creating warped realities may be an inherently human trait, which would have wide implications. We may do it to avoid stress. 
A possible solution to information avoidance trend is less clear. It is up to individuals to challenge their beliefs, an action that exercises a lazy mind and is regular among the best decision makers.

Samsung announces the new, sleek S8
After a year riddled with exploding S7 phones and horrendous public relations, Samsung has announced its next phone — the S8 and the S8+. Samsung hopes the new phone will restore customer trust and boost their sales and stock prices. The technology giant has ensured that this phone does not catch fire like its predecessor. The phone will be released on April 21, 2017 and starts at $720. 
The S8 comes with a fingerprint sensor, an AI assistant, and an iris recognition security feature. The display screen is incredibly large, boasting a 18.5:9 ratio with curved edges. However, many aspects of the S8, including battery life, camera quality, and RAM are not significantly different from the S7. The S8 thus seems more like a revamped S7 than an entirely new release. 
Samsung’s new attempt is sleek, safe, and equipped with an amazing display. Although many customers turned away from Samsung, the S8 could turn things around.

NASA switched off one of its satellites
Earth Observing-1 (EO-1), one of NASA’s most enduring satellites, has been switched off. It was originally built to last a year and launched more as a test, but surpassed everyone’s expectations, operating functionally for 17 years. 
EO-1 observed dozens of natural disasters as well as changes to the Earth’s surface and atmosphere. It contributed to NASA’s understanding of satellite formation flight and AI technology with respect to space observation. 
The veteran satellite was switched off due to a lack of enough fuel to operate it. It is impossible to refuel the satellite because of the nature of its orbit, which is very low. Other satellites like the Hubble telescope are periodically serviced to ensure they remain at the correct altitude and continue to function. The fuel onboard the satellite is used to power motors for adjusting attitude. 
EO-1 will orbit in a dead state for 40 more years, until it burns up in the atmosphere.

SpaceX landed a used Falcon rocket
SpaceX has made history by landing a rocket it sent into space. The Falcon 9 rocket took off from Cape Canaveral in Florida, placing a communications satellite in orbit. The Falcon later landed on a SpaceX drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean. Although SpaceX has landed rockets before, this is the first time in history a space rocket has launched for the second time. 
Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, commented on the feat. “It means you can fly and re-fly an orbital class booster, which is the most expensive part of the rocket. This is going to be, ultimately, a huge revolution in spaceflight,” he said. The conventional rocket disposes of the orbital booster once it has escaped the atmosphere, leaving it to burn on re-entry. 
The cost of space flight could be greatly diminished if SpaceX achieves this feat regularly. Space flight is now similar to other means of transport, in which the vehicle is not disposed of at the destination.

Cosmologists have known for almost a century that our universe isn’t static. In 1919, Edwin Hubble gazed up at the universe through his powerful telescope and made two ground-breaking observations: there exist galaxies outside our own, and those galaxies are flying away from us. 
It is the second observation that revealed the true, expanding nature of our universe. Hubble arrived at this realization after he witnessed a strange phenomenon — all distant galaxies are red-shifted. 
A red-shift occurs when an object is traveling away from an observer at speeds comparable to the speed of light. To the observer, it seems as though light waves emitted from the object are stretched out, increasing their wavelength. This makes the object appear red (red light has the longest wavelength). Hubble also noticed that the red-shift effect was stronger the further out he looked. 
In every direction scientists looked, they saw galaxies zooming away from the Earth and one another. Naturally, theoretical physicists like Stephen Hawking wondered what would happen if we ran the clock backwards. The galaxies would come closer together! In fact, if we go back far enough in time, all the galaxies would be at the same point in space. 
This large amount of mass at a single point creates something called singularity, a point in space with so much mass and gravity that it distorts space tremendously. When all the mass in the universe is compressed at a point, the resulting singularity wraps all space in on itself. 
This is how the big bang theory was developed. At the beginning of the universe, 13 billion years ago, all matter was at a single point, then began to expand apart. Scientists are still unsure of what initially caused the expansion, however. The cosmic background radiation gives them a glimpse into the early universe. 
Today, the universe is still expanding and at an accelerating rate. Space expands at 74 kilometers per second per megaparsec (one megaparsec is about three million light years). It is important to note that this expansion only occurs at large scales, such as in the space between galaxies; it cannot be observed here on Earth. 
Understanding the nature of the universe’s expansion informs us about the future fate of our universe. 
If the rate of expansion continues to accelerate, galaxies will continue to fly apart at such a high velocity that their light will not be able to reach us anymore, never to be seen again. When the stars in our galaxy die, the nighttime sky will be completely dark. This is know as the big freeze. 
Another possibility is that there is just enough mass in the universe to halt the expansion. The universe will simply remain in a stationary state, neither expanding nor contracting. 
The final probability is that the mass in the universe is just enough to reverse expansion. The universe will begin to contract, eventually returning it to its singularity state. This is known as the big crunch. Such a universe oscillates between states of singularity and expansion for eternity. All our current data suggests that the big freeze is the most likely future, because there simply isn’t enough mass in our universe to slow down its accelerating expansion. 
As sad as this seems, it’s very, very far in the future. For dozens of billions of years, we can still enjoy the view of our neighboring galaxies — that is, if we’re still around.

Throughout the year, 17 of Carnegie Mellon’s fraternities and sororities competed against each other to raise the most money for Pittsburgh’s chapter of Camp Kesem, a charity program that “operates free summer camps for children who have been touched by a parent's cancer,” and to put on a 13-minute musical performance.  Greek Sing has partnered with Camp Kesem for two years to help raise $150,000, and started off towards their goal incredibly strong with a new Greek Sing record of $100,522.53 raised in the first year.
After Greek Sing chairs and emcees of the night, Alpha Chi Omega senior drama major Stephanie Kane and information systems major and Sigma Chi brother Gus Henry, gave their opening remarks, the organizations showcased their various skits and acts. Throughout the night, sorority and fraternity pairs competed in the doubles category, performing intricate, condensed versions of full-length musicals.
The show kicked off with Kappa Alpha Theta and Alpha Sigma Phi’s performance of Peter Pan.  While the group did not place, their creativity and the youthful energy of the original show shone through every part of their performance, from their inventive “high-flying” choreography (people in black body suits carrying the cast around the stage) to their costumes. First year Dietrich College student Jamie Slomka stood out as Peter Pan, leading the performance and the whole of Greek Sing off to an amazing start.
Following Peter Pan was Delta Delta Delta and Sigma Chi’s performance of Hercules, filled with show-stopping vocals from the five Muses and Megara. Delta Delta Delta and Sigma Chi's performance was the fan favorite of the night, mixing in humor and a classic Disney vibe with talent and nostalgia of the original movie. Alpha Chi Omega and Alpha Tau’s performance of The Little Mermaid brought Ariel’s world to life in its set pieces and energy, and showcased the voice of music and English major Sydney Roslin, who played Ariel, in the best way possible.
However, the performance that blew me away was the first act closer and first place performance of Kappa Kappa Gamma and Sigma Phi Epsilon’s rendition of the new Disney classic Moana. The performance stayed true to the film’s original message of discovering who you are, featured vocals that raised the energy of the room, showcased incredible sets with a giant puppet of Te Ka, and presented amazing choreography that truly utilized the human element of the story, with junior neuroscience major Sarah Deluty, who played Moana throughout the performance, seamlessly climbing on top of her fellow performers to reach up to twelve feet above the ground in the performance’s final number. More importantly, it was a great image of the fraternity and sorority involved working together to create something magical for others, encompassing what Greek Sing is all about.
Starting off the second act, and placing third overall, was Alpha Phi and Pi Kappa Alpha’s performance of Little Shop of Horrors. The spectacular thing about this set was that every soloist had a flawless voice, truly bringing the musical to life. Coming from someone who hadn't watched Little Shop of Horrors before Greek Sing, Alpha Phi and Pi Kappa Alpha retold the story in a great way that flowed well and made me want to check out the original. Additionally, the set pieces, such as Audrey II, helped to bring Skid Row to life throughout the performance.
Second place winners alpha Kappa Delta Phi and Phi Delta Theta performed Once on this Island next, truly bringing out the heart of the show’s setting and bringing the energy and essence of the show to their performance. The choreography of the show helped to bring that energy out into the audience, and carried out throughout the performance thanks to the ensemble and the soloists. In particular, the soloist as Papa Ge stood out, truly becoming his character and commanding over the performance.
Delta Gamma and Delta Tau Delta performed second-to-last in their rendition of The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee, taking the audience back to a time before college with their fun choreography, crazy costumes, and quirky energy. They brought the crazy energy of the original show to their performance and adapted the musical in a clever way.
Three fraternities competed in the singles category. In this category, the fraternities instead composed original skits featuring familiar melodies with new lyrics. Third place winners Kappa Sigma opened singles with their performance of El Dorado, taking Dora into a new direction by bringing her, Boots, and Diego to Carnegie Mellon as first-years in search of bananas. The craziness and hilarity of the number was an amazing addition to the event and kicked off the singles performances on a high note.
In the first act, Sigma Alpha Epsilon also performed their original musical Rata-tool-y, a story set in a Lowe's Department Store about a young power drill stuck on a shelf filled with screwdrivers who seeks to find his true parentage. Adapting songs like Beauty and the Beast’s “Belle” into their performance, Sigma Alpha Epsilon's creativity with their script, featuring breaking the fourth wall and meta jokes, earned them second place.
The final singles performance was from Alpha Epsilon Pi with their Jewish take on the Tony Award-winning The Book of Mormon called The Book of Moses. The brothers spectacularly adapted the hit musical and its hilarious vibe into a great performance, most notably by turning the title song “Hello” into “Shalom,” that helped carry Alpha Epsilon Pi to first place.
Greek Sing was a truly memorable night that celebrated philanthropy in the best way. It featured the greek community coming together as a whole to make a difference and put on another amazing show, blowing away the Carnegie Mellon community with their talent, creativity, and motivation and desire to contribute to help make an impact.

For most people, hearing about another person’s dreams can be boring and tedious. However, super-spy Sterling Archer, who has spent a fictional lifetime flouting every rule imaginable is, not surprisingly, an exception to this rule. 
The seventh season of Archer ended with him shot, floating face down in a pool and the new season, dubbed Archer: Dreamland, extends the cliffhanger. Archer is in a coma in a hospital bed and the season takes audiences into Archer’s imaginative subconscious. Creator Adam Reed continues to provide the raunchy, ridiculous humor and crisp, photorealistic animation the show is known for while adding a stimulating all-new setting, a gripping plot, and a thought-provoking duality for Sterling Archer. 
In Archer’s fantasy, the cast has been transported back to 1947 and each character assumes a new role. Archer is now a private detective searching for the murderer of his partner, Woodhouse, who in the regular Archer universe is his loyal, but heroin-addicted butler. In his hunt for answers, Archer crosses paths with a mob boss by the name of Mother — who is his actual mother Malory — and decides to do her a favor in return for help in his investigation. While on the job for Mother, he stumbles upon Cyril and Pam, now corrupt cops who are helping rival mobster Len Trexler (a rival spy in real life) smuggle prostitutes into the country. Some things haven’t changed, however: Archer is still lusting for Lana Kane, although now she is a sultry jazz singer. 
The plot has no real bearing on the actual lives on any of the characters, but it is a captivating story nonetheless. Reed has done an excellent job of keeping the audience wondering what might happen next, with twists and turns keeping the audience on their toes. Furthermore, a wacky plot line has Cheryl — now the heiress to a vast publishing fortune, but no less insane than before — enlisting Archer to help her flee her family via a faked suicide, and leaves the viewer in constant anticipation of what crazy stunt she’ll pull next. Each episode also ends with a cliffhanger, helping viewers become even more invested in the development of the story. 
The plot is bolstered by the addition of a new, deeper, more serious side to Sterling Archer — he is haunted by Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) from World War II, suffering from graphic flashbacks during action scenes. While Archer has always come off as cocky and incapable of true emotion, instead focusing his energy on exotic cars, alcohol, and women, there have been brief glimpses of Archer’s vulnerability. Evidence of Malory’s psychological abuse occasionally cropped up in the show and in Season 7,  when Archer encounters a former prep school bully he still stammers and shakes in the bully’s presence. The PTSD Archer experiences from WWII might be acting as a metaphor for nightmarish flashbacks Archer has to his difficult childhood, revealing perhaps why he feels he has to constantly assert himself and torment his co-workers. Reed also introduces a surprising duality for quirky mad scientist Krieger, which hints that his Dreamland character may have honest intentions.
But don’t worry, Archer hasn’t gotten serious. While the first episode takes time setting up this new world inside Archer’s mind, there is still plenty of inventive, bizarre, and crude humor. Many of the funniest moments come from several running jokes that Reed employs throughout. For example, during scenes inside “Dreamland,” the club owned by Mother where Ray Gillette is now the bandleader, after any sexual innuendo the drummer plays a rimshot in the background, which is followed by Ray yelling at him in frustration. Aside from sexual comedy, Reed has an impressive ability to turn odd, cringe-worthy situations into laughable moments—like one morbid scene where Cyril is found cutting off a corpse’s finger to use as proof he has a hostage (something Archer and Cheryl were also about to do). While this grotesque moment shouldn’t be funny, the sharp-talking and sarcastic dialogue somehow makes it amusing. Of course, this being Archer, many of the the funniest lines are unprintable and the rest involve a convoluted set-up that would take half a page just to do them justice.
Archer is full of pop culture references, and many of the subtler jokes in Dreamland are parodies of the noir films and novels of the 1930s and 1940s. In one scene, Archer narrates his thought process aloud as he drives, mimicking the deadpan style of storytelling found in noir, before the shot pans to a scruffy dog seated next to him and Archer admits not knowing why he’s talking to a dog. In another episode, there is an explicit reference to the greenhouse scene between General Sternwood and Philip Marlowe, played by Humphrey Bogart, from The Big Sleep. 
Of course it wouldn’t be Archer without stunning animation. The vivid colors and intricate details of the Dreamland landscape create visuals so realistic that they begin to feel fantastical. The clean, flowing lines of the art-deco architecture and majestic vintage cars work perfectly with Archer’s crisp animation style, and the outdoor scenes in particular leave viewers in awe. The show also takes advantage of the endless opportunities that animation provides—with ice cubes dropping into a drink seen from the bottom of the glass or a seamless transition from a spinning vault lock to the speeding wire hubcaps of an antique car.
Despite the triviality of this season’s plot, as it lives solely in Archer’s head, the absurd storylines, constant cliffhangers, and development of Sterling Archer’s character leaves viewers yearning for the next episode.
Archer: Dreamland premieres Wednesday, April 5 at 10 p.m. on FXX.

Pittsburgh is a beautiful city, full of history and culture — art, technology, sports, and of course, food. If I were to use a restaurant to epitomize my experience in Pittsburgh and at Carnegie Mellon so far, it would be The Yard. It is what I have come to expect from the city. 
The Yard has three locations: Market Square, PPG Paints Arena, and — the one I went to and the one closest to campus — Shadyside. Located right off Walnut Street on Bellefonte, The Yard is a nice walk (or short bus ride) away from campus. 
I went to the The Yard on a rainy Sunday night, to celebrate a friend’s birthday. It was past 9 p.m., and since this is Pittsburgh, the restaurant was mostly empty. The lower level of the restaurant has a larger space, with a nice bar, and the upper level, where our party of ten was quickly seated, is smaller, but also holds an ever-necessary bar. The place has a rustic feel — all wood and brick — that allowed us to relax and simply enjoy our food.
The Yard is known for its creative grilled cheese sandwiches, with names like “The Big Che-Bowski,” "Buffy the Mac Attack Slayer," “Hail, Caesar!” and “Mother of Dragons.” The menu also includes a requisite salad section, with what my friend called a "quality average" Caprese salad. The variety of appetizers includes soft pretzel, buffalo chicken dip and chips, and wings, the latter of which another friend commented "left a little to be desired." The star of The Yard’s show, however, are the grilled cheeses.
Each grilled cheese entrée comes with a small bowl of tomato soup, and potato chips, which you can change to fries, sweet potato fries, or tater tots for an extra fee. The wait was short, and soon our whole table was desperately trying to hold our sandwiches with our hands only to give up when everything fell out and resort to using forks. 
Because we couldn’t decide what to order for ourselves, a friend and I each decided to order a different sandwich and then share. I ordered “Pierogies N’At,” a cheddar and gouda grilled cheese with fried pierogies topped with caramelized onions, sauerkraut, and kielbasa. The idea of putting pierogies inside a sandwich is like Primanti’s putting fries in their sandwiches — so very odd, but so very right for Pittsburgh. The grilled cheese is rich and tasty, with all the flavors complementing each other. The pierogies themselves are wonderful, with a thick and chewy dough and a smooth and creamy potato filling. With my order, I added tater tots with parmesan, which were easily the best tater tots I’ve ever had. They were fresh and crispy, and went well with the standard tomato soup.
My friend ordered the popular “Mac Attack,” (which is proudly displayed on the homepage of The Yard’s website) a cheddar grilled cheese sandwich absolutely stuffed with mac ‘n cheese, with a sprinkle of bacon lardons. When it came, the mac ‘n cheese was spilling over the bread onto the tray, and we had to use our forks to eat it. The mac ‘n cheese is great, a level above your normal boxed mac ‘n cheese. For her order, my friend chose sweet potato fries, which all our friends deemed the best side The Yard offers. They are delicious, especially with the buttery cinnamon dip they come with.
The service was simple and fast, which allowed us all to talk and catch up with one another. The Yard’s atmosphere is very, for lack of a better word, chill. It's a place a group of friends can easily walk into on a whim and enjoy a good meal. It is your quintessential Pittsburgh restaurant and bar that offers great, unique, quality food.

Dear Ruth,
Honestly, dude. I’m so screwed. Two nights ago I threw a pretty LIT banger at my house for my friend’s 21st surprise birthday party — which, by the way, was a huge success. But there was one minor mishap. Someone spilled a college student classic of Smirnoff and Sprite on my bedroom carpet. Yikes, I know. Thankfully, both vodka and sprite are clear and didn't leave a stain on my carpet. The real horror is the army of ants that swarmed the crime scene that I got to wake up to. I frantically jumped out of bed and tried to kill them all, and for that day I thought I was safe. 
So I went to bed last night, thinking I was in the clear and that I had taken the necessary precaution to avoid an infestation. So this morning, after I got to work and took out my laptop, I soon realized that leaving my laptop on the ground overnight was the single greatest mistake I have made in my entire  life to date. Ants began crawling out of my laptop in amounts I have never before seen. I didn't know if it would stop. I couldn't use my usual ant killing methods of stomping on them because, well, it was my laptop. All I could do was shake it violently and hope that they'd fall out (please don't tell the rest of the staff that I dumped out an entire extended family of ants onto the floor of the office). As the day progresses, I find more and more ants on me and my belongings — just a moment ago I had to shake some ants out of my sleeves. Yuck.
So what do I do? Clearly my home is infested, and now I'm pretty sure I'm going to need a new backpack. Do those ant traps really work? Should I check out one of those weird Pinterest at-home remedies for bugs? Please help, before I'm eaten alive!
Send help,
Not Okay. Ants Need To Stop
Dear NO ANTS,
Run.
No, seriously, run. Drop out of school, change your name, leave the country. Any and all of the above. Tell your parents that you love them, your roommates that they can have your stuff, and your friend who spilled vodka on your floor that you're not mad, just disappointed, and also leaving forever and never coming back. This is your life now. 
It's not going to be easy. By the time your soon-to-be short life ends, you will be hardened, grizzled, and filled with the weary loneliness that can only come from a life on the run. You'll spend everyday thinking fondly of your family, friends, and bed until they start to fade from your mind like a distant memory. Some days, you'll wonder why you ever ran in the first place, but then you'll remember — ants. And then, you'll start scratching.
They will always be following you. They will never stop. Humanity famously beatout apex predators by walking behind them, using our stamina and two-legged physique to outlast them. We're known for being the best followers and the best pursuers, but that's all a lie. It was ants the whole time. Once they find you, they will never leave you alone. They'll crawl across the world just to crawl all over your skin with their creepy creepy feet. 
Every time you feel an itch, you'll wonder — was that them? Are they still on you? Have they caught up? (They have. It was always too late. Running was a distant hope, but the only one you had left. I'm sorry.)
(You deserved better than this.)
Keep running,
Ruth

Iris van Herpen: Transforming Fashion, the current fashion exhibit at the Carnegie Museum of Art captures themes that are very familiar to us. Throughout the city of Pittsburgh, we often encounter sights that combine technology with art. The unique culture of the city is what makes Pittsburgh one of the best places to display this Dutch designer’s collection. From the outfits with textures imitating those of wildlife and natural forces to the ones with 3D printed accessories, the ideas in van Herpen’s pieces are those that we can easily relate to. 
When you first walk into the exhibit, it’ll feel like you’re on a runway, with dimmed lighting and models posing on your left and right. All three rooms that housed the various pieces from fifteen of van Herpen’s collections have the same principle setup: mannequin models lined up standing on long white platforms, surrounded by dark purple walls for a chic feel. The clothes are what add the diversity, fascination, and curiosity to the viewer’s experience. 
In the first room, the first selection of van Herpen collections you’ll find are "Refinery Smoke" and "Mummification." The "Refinery Smoke" pieces were a personal favorite because all the dresses gave off illusions of smoke, which covered parts of the mannequins’ bodies. The exhibit described van Herpen’s interpretations of smoke as “sinister, alive, and toxic,” and that by wearing it, one can have more control over such a dark and mysterious entity. The "Mummification" collection held this theme of wrapping, where most of the dresses were tightly fitted and some outfits were wrapped around more parts of the body than others. Its pieces also had a dark theme, represented by the dark colors of various dresses and the exhibit describing the whole concept as “macabre.” 
As you continue exploring more collections, you’ll find dresses made in innovative ways from some of the most unique materials; dresses made from children’s umbrellas, glass, and 3D prints are just a few examples. Several of the materials were put on sample display for visitors to experience and touch.
Dresses in the "Wilderness Embodied" collection depicted “wild forces,” where the fabric from some dresses were made to look like actual leaves. The "Capriole" collection (capriole meaning “leap in the air” in French) was a unique one that presented the experience of free-falling. One of the dresses in this collection was crafted to look like the skeleton of a human, and it was supposed to represent the overwhelming feeling of terror before parachuting out of a plane. All the dresses from the different collections were captivating, however one from van Herpen’s "Crystallization" collection was particularly special in that it was the first 3D printed dress to ever walk down a runway. I’d advise you to visit the exhibit to find the dress and see it for yourself.
Van Herpen does her best to incorporate all the relevant themes and ideas we encounter in the world today. She tackles complex concepts which might be difficult for the viewer to wrap their head around,  such as the behaviors of natural forces or the effects of technology on society, and presents her interpretations by crafting dresses in manners that make her focuses obvious. It makes sense that her pieces have attracted people from all over the world, including well known designers and celebrities like Beyoncé and Lady Gaga. Van Herpen has shown others how fashion can evolve at the same pace and in the same manner as culture and technology around the world. There’s a lot to learn from viewing her collections, and they’ll only be at the Carnegie Museum of Art until May 1, so be sure to check it out before then!

After a week of soul searching, I decided it still wasn’t too late for Ariel to face retribution for her vicious slight against me a few weeks back, so this week I headed off to Southside with my own replacement. He was in a fancy mood so we decided to go to Acacia, a prohibition themed bar on East Carson.
The location: The only issue with Southside is that the trip can be quite lengthy. The 54 will get you there from Craig in about 20 minutes, so it’s not the worst thing, but it’s not as easy as some of the places in Shadyside and Squirrel Hill if you live near campus. Aside from that, Southside is an ideal space for a bar, with everything you could possibly want in a one block radius. Post-bar grub is available ranging from pizza at the Pie Bar to cheesesteaks at the Groove. There are other bars to hop to if you want to switch up the vibe, and there are even necessities such as check cashing and tattoos nearby, should that come up.
The drinks: The drinks took a while, and I didn’t have a large enough sample to tell if this indicated that the bartenders were busy or that they were behind the bar working on their sublime mixology. I ordered a drink, the Nori by Nature, which I can only describe as an alcoholic sushi beverage. Basically, it was a mix of seaweed, finger, lime, and alcohol. It would take a real food critic who knows what words like “soporific” mean to break down the drink into words that convey such complex flavors. A mere occasional bar patron like myself can only offer that it was pretty dope … and surprisingly strong. My temporary bar buddy ordered La Revuelta, which seemed like a misnomer since there wasn’t anything quite as revolutionary as seaweed tincture, but it was a damned good drink in its own way. The drinks, unsurprisingly, are not cheap. A cocktail might run you all the way up to $15 after tax and tip, which is on the pricey side even for Southside.
The vibe: The speakeasy theme informs the décor. To enter Acacia, you walk in through boarded up windows and a covered door. This is sort of cool aesthetically, but it obscures the step down when exiting. Don’t be like me and trip on your way out. The interior is dimly lit even for a bar, especially since the streetlights can’t flood in. This gives the bar a bit of a secret and low-key feel to it that makes it a fun place to spend a couple hours.
This bar is not the place to take a bunch of people; there just isn’t a ton of space. There is a bar and several booths that provide some seating, but it’s more of a place to go hang out with a couple friends than a group. This is magnified by the fact that the bar is fairly quiet compared to others. This could just have been that night, but it was very easy to sit and have a conversation.
Lit or nah: I’m definitely going to go with lit. This certainly isn’t a regular jaunt. It’s too expensive for that. However, the series of novel ingredients in the drinks and the atmosphere that make it easy to hang out with a few friends makes this a fun centerpiece for a trip to Southside.

The Pittsburgh Center for the Arts, a bus ride away from campus, is one of the homes of the flourishing arts culture in Pittsburgh. Arts education, exhibition space, residencies, and arts advocacy are the main focus of this organization, making it a useful resource for artists in the area. On Friday, the Center hosted an opening of the 2017 Solo and Collaborative exhibitions. In a large, canary yellow house, the space is inviting and well lit, offering rooms to wander through in the beautiful house. This particular show featured nine different exhibitions, with a total of thirteen Pittsburgh-based artists including Nikki Brugnoli, Jiyon Hong, Laurel Wilcox, and Carnegie Mellon professor of art Devan Shimoyama. 
Walking the space is certainly an interesting experience, as the architectural features of the house make the space feel vastly different from what you expect from a traditional gallery. Each exhibition space feels more contained and the flow from exhibition to exhibition feels more casual, allowing viewers to explore the space more freely. In a sampler sort of format, the show gives a sense of the themes that run through the Pittsburgh art scene. These works covered a variety of topics, dealing with memory, race, and narrative. This show is defined by a myriad of interesting and expertly contrasted textures, colors, and media. Hong’s delicate wire map of Pittsburgh and the contrast of clay, wood, and rope in Interdependent by Jonathan Shwartz and Angela Biederman are notable examples. The diversity of the materiality and subject matter in this show was exciting and full of potential, and it makes walking through such a large group exhibition more engaging.
In a show like this, where there are so many different exhibitions and no grounding theme, good curation is crucial. Part of our job as viewers is trying to untangle the intention of the artist and the context of the work, but the curators must also guide us along. Although a lot of art is intended to stand alone and be easily understood, all art requires a basis of knowledge to understand. In shows like this where there is no theme, the artists’ background are not well known, and the diversity of work is collected in an intimate space, the curation of individual exhibitions requires more thought. Each artist and collaborative team approached the explanation of their work differently, bringing us to the question of how one effectively use an artist statement.
The artist statement is presented to give the viewer context and hints at where to look to decipher meaning in work. There is a necessary balance between giving enough information for the audience to connect with with the work, but leaving enough out for the audience to be motivated to explore and ask questions. At times, the artist statements and curation in these exhibitions made it challenging to connect with the work. Ambiguity in art is beautiful and important, but vague art jargon and broad concepts without specificity to the work will lessen the viewer’s ability to be invested. Each of the exhibitions were clearly working toward interesting ideas and had expert command over medium, but connecting with the work was challenging because some of the artist statements were poorly considered. Art needs to reach both experts and non-experts, and without either clear cues in the work or well crafted curation this cannot happen.
One exhibition that successfully considered the art and presentation was Oblivion by Misty Morrison. Walking through a narrow hallway to reach a series of large-scale paintings with haunting portraits and domestic scenes, the viewer is transported into the world Morrison creates. Her work has an undeniably cinematic quality, the lighting and compositions are almost like stills from a film noir movie. The portraits are intimate, but there is also sense of anxious anticipation. The figures are larger than life, and the language they use is familiar enough that the initial connection the viewer makes with the work is immediate and effortless. This gives space to explore the overall narrative, to connect with the characters and bring your own stories to the setup. Thus, with enough information present in the paintings, the lack of artist statement worked. I am excited to see more of her work, as being in the space made me crave more of these styles of narrative to explore and peel apart. 
The work of Carnegie Mellon professor Shimoyama and Danny Ferrell in He’s American contrast in many ways with the work of Morrison as they tackle portraiture and curation differently. Shimoyama and Ferrell are both faculty here at Carnegie Mellon’s School of Art, and their expertise in curation and painting is clear. The natural flow of the viewer through the series of paintings and sculptural installations could have you land at the artist statement last. The installations and the quality of the paintings are opulent and beautiful, the vivid colors and the bejeweled installations add to the allusions to religious paintings. The presence of gradients and the graphic colors place these works, though surreal and magical, specifically in our time. 
Their collaboration is seamless, the art plays off of each other and explores the lived experiences of race and queerness with nuance and softness. In their short artist statement they write about the American dream, the invisibility of intimacy and vulnerability in the gay male experience. Their work talks about America and luxury, and who this dream is for — a topic which is relevant more than ever in this political environment. In this case, the artist statement is important but, a testament to their work, it does not make or break the exhibition. Rather, the artist statement adds depth to the exploration of the art. It allows the viewer to step into the shoes of the characters the artist paint, and see American society through the eyes of those whose identities have been reduced to political props.
With the recent defunding of the National Education Association and the continuing reduction in funding for arts education, artist and curators have to be especially mindful of the role art is taking in society. Going to a show with a group of such inspiring and talented artist and focusing on the idea of artist statements may be nit picky. But care and attention paid to contextualizing work makes art impactful. As an arts columnist, I have the incredible opportunity to talk to artists about their intentions for their work — their passion for their subject matter and practice is contagious, and it makes it easy to match their investment in their work. The artist statement is for those who don’t get to have that conversation. It is the artist’s direct communication with the audience and should not be taken for granted. This show was beautiful, diverse, and exciting in many ways. It displays incredible expertise and it is exciting to see what local artist are pursuing. But go in with the benefit of doubt, and leave yourself open to the questions that the art will undoubtedly pose for better or for worse.

Local boy scouts recently visited Carnegie Mellon University to learn important and potentially life-saving first aid skills. In a demonstration, one scout showed the technique he learned to apply multiple chest compressions to a training doll, while two other scouts prepared an Automated External Defibrillator machine and pretended to call for help.
Every year, Carnegie Mellon University partners with Merit Badge University (MBU) to allow over 200 Pittsburgh boy scouts to utilize the campus in order to learn important skills such as public speaking, chemistry, aviation, and engineering. The annual two-day event, hosted by Carnegie Mellon’s Alpha Phi Omega Kappa chapter, offers over 15 of the necessary courses the boy scouts need to take in order to earn their merit badges. Successfully completing these courses helps the scouts fulfill some of the 21 required merit badges they need to be promoted to Eagle Scouts.
This year, local Pittsburgh Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT) volunteered to teach the scouts’ first aid course. This partnership with Pittsburgh EMTs means that not only do the scouts get to learn from the officials who have to be prepared to perform these skills everyday, but the EMTs also get to teach more people these important skills which benefits them as well.
According to Mark Pinchalk, it is helpful if public bystanders are trained in performing CPR so that they are able to apply these skills while the EMTs are traveling to the area. “Any kind of CPR, it doesn’t have to be perfect, has been shown to improve survival,” Pinchalk said.
The scouts were also trained in recognizing signs of a heart attack, stroke, and hypothermia. They also learned how to stop a person from bleeding.
Scoutmaster Scott Schrecongost states that this training can prepare the scouts to be prepared to be of help in a variety of situations, such as when going camping, when playing with other kids, or even being at home.
Beth McKinstry, the scouts’ troop leader, has seen how these skills can be applied in the most unlikely of situations. While her son was a 16 year-old Eagle Scout, he was able to help a woman who was going into shock from a car accident. When he came home, he told his mom that he was only able to help the woman because of the skills he learned as a boy scout.
McKinstry says her favorite part about being a troop leader is seeing the young boy scouts transform into men.
Akindele Davies, the Head MBU Chair of Alpha Phi Omega, Kappa chapter, along with Karen Kim and Lillian Sheng, his co-chairs, was responsible for organizing MBU’s visit to Carnegie Mellon. This included recruiting counselors, ordering supplies, and setting up an event schedule. “Organizing MBU has taught me a lot about event/project planning, dealing with adversity, and the importance of teamwork,” says Davies.
Most of all, he is glad that Alpha Phi Omega is able to allow the scouts to get the opportunity to work on their merit badges, since they contact Carnegie Mellon professors to volunteer as counselors for the scouts for subjects they need to have knowledge on to earn their merit badges.
Chemistry is one of the most popular subjects for the scouts, according to McKinstry. This is taught by Gizelle Sherwood, the Merit Badge Counselor for chemistry, as well as an assistant professor for chemistry at Carnegie Mellon. The appeal? “They get to blow things up,” said McKinstry.
Davies adds that “the cool thing about this class is that scouts not only get to learn about chemistry straight from a university chemistry professor, but they also get to do so in a university chemistry lab.”
Alphi Phi Omega would like to thank "Adrienne Borkowski from the SLICE office, representatives from the local BSA district Tom Strong and Ron Buckner; our chapter advisors John Papinchak and Conrad Zapanta; all of our Merit Badge Counselors: Bruce Pollock, Carl Bolton, Gary Mosher, Jeffrey Hansen, Giselle Sherwood, Robert Warner, John Buzzie, Dave Hochendoner, William Klimek, Scott Schrengost, Jo Starr, Ida Chow, Patricia Kelly, and Femi Olukoya. Last but not least, we'd like to thank all the Kappa Chapter brother who volunteered to help out the day of the event. Without all of these people MBU would not have been possible."
Information regarding Merit Badge University’s next visit to Carnegie Mellon will be out later this year.

Organized and led by 16 Carnegie Mellon students, the second annual TEDxCMU: Pivot was held on April 1. The team of students brought nine speakers and two performance groups to the six-hour event, including professors, students at Carnegie Mellon, and guest speakers recommended by sponsors.
Carnegie Mellon president Subra Suresh opened the event with a speech about the modern Fourth Industrial Revolution. He noted that technological innovations such as the internet, data science, artificial intelligence, and automated systems have revolutionized human life in the past decades. He also urged the audience to look at the humanities aspect of technology. After illustrating the importance of studying the ethics of science and technologies from a historical perspective, he noted that the advancement of technology must be made in the context of human beings in order to benefit human life.
Other guests included Michael Senatore, who discussed the meaning of “going viral.” Senatore became an internet sensation in his senior year of high school because of a video of him flipping a water bottle at his high school talent show, which received over 70 million views on YouTube. He claimed that the viral effect on the internet has allowed “unqualified people to do amazing things.”
Molly Steenson, an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon’s School of Design, talked about design and how visualization could bring inspirations to the research and development of artificial intelligence.
Steven Chase, an assistant professor of biomedical engineering at Carnegie Mellon and a faculty expert at BrainHub, showed his research in developing a brain-computer interface, and demonstrated how measuring and simulating human neural activities could benefit disabled or paralyzed patients. He also discussed the challenges of building such an interface from the historical perspective and the development of artificial intelligence over the past 60 years.
Amy Blankson, a co-founder of Goodthink and an expert of positive psychology, broadly discussed the upsides and downsides of innovations in mobile technologies.
Rebecca Nugent, a teaching professor at Carnegie Mellon’s department of statistics, raised the underestimated issue of being “innumerate” and discussed how the concept is perceived in western culture. She noted that, while illiteracy is often regarded as the more obvious problem to solve, people’s attitude towards the subject of mathematics, statistics, and data science are often steered by the Western culture that labels mathematics as a “cold, hard, masculine,” and intimidating subjects.
Charlie White, the head of Carnegie Mellon’s School of Art, traced the history of photography to the early 20th century, and noted various trends within the photographs that reflected the societal changes over the century.
Dr. Jeff Schneider, the current engineering head of machine learning at Uber Advanced Technologies Group  and a former research professor at Carnegie Mellon University, discussed the history and technology behind driverless vehicles. Not only did he outline the technology and challenges of artificial intelligence involved in this project, he also showed the benefits of driverless cars. He claimed that driverless technology can decrease automobile-related accidents, fully utilize cars, save parking spaces, and decrease the amount of time people “waste” nowadays on commuting.
Eric Cyphers, a renowned cellist and sophomore student studying neuroscience at Carnegie Mellon, was the only student selected to speak at TEDxCMU this year. Cyphers shared his experience of combining his academic interest in neuroscience and music. Prior to coming to Carnegie Mellon, Cyphers studied at Curtis Institute of Music and toured extensively around North America and Europe, working with musicians such as Yo-Yo Ma, Itzhak Perlman, and Lang Lang. His interdisciplinary interest in music and science had enriched his life and creativity. Two student groups also performed at TEDxCMU including the Exploded Ensemble, an electro-acoustic ensemble at Carnegie Mellon, and the K-Pop Dance Group.
“I consider this event as a huge success,” noted Yash Maheshwari, co-founder of TEDxCMU and a junior majoring in statistics and machine learning.
Around 400 students and guests attended the event, quadrupling the number of attendees from last year. 
The team of 16 Carnegie Mellon students have been preparing for this event since October, and was entirely supported by sponsors without drawing funds from Joint Funding Committee at Carnegie Mellon. Due to successful marketing and the improved quality of speakers, all 450 tickets were sold out one week before the event.
This year’s theme, Pivot, was chosen to represent the idea that TEDxCMU is building upon the foundation of last year’s event. In response to a question about the future of TEDxCMU, Maheshwari said that it “should be an event that people on campus are looking forward to, like Tartan Hacks and Carnival.”

Of all the colleges in the United States, 99.8 percent of them define race with the same five categories in their application process. When applying for health care, taking a standardized test, sending a child to day care, the same five boxes are presented allowing the participant to check as many as apply to them. It is no mere coincidence that all Americans have become accustomed to the categories of Native American, Asian, Black, White, and Native Pacific Islander in generalizing the abstract concept of race. These categories exist and have existed since 1997, when they were introduced by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to standardize the way we talk about race.
On Wednesday, March 29, Quayshawn Spencer, assistant professor of philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania, gave a lecture about race talk to members of the Carnegie Mellon University community in Baker Hall.
The event was co-sponsored by Carnegie Mellon University’s Victor M. Bearg Science and Humanities Scholars Speaker Series and the University Lecture Series. The title of the lecture, “A Radical Solution to the Race Problem,” shares the same name as a paper written by Spencer in 2014 on the same topic. Though Spencer is a philosopher, his concentration is within the philosophy of science, which provides him with some background in biology. His radical solution to the race problem attempts to explain how we define race currently in America, as well as implications of these definitions in medical, social, and political contexts.
One strange nuance that may come to mind when one thinks critically about the number of times they’ve filled out a form identifying themselves using OMB race talk is the separation between Hispanic and Latino and the five categories of race. This is because the OMB does not consider Hispanic and Latino to be races, but in an attempt to be inclusive, allows one to mention it as an ethnicity.
Why do we define Hispanic and Latino as an ethnicity and not a race? Spencer argues that this is because race is greatly defined by one’s ancestral continental origin. The OMB couldn’t allow such a wide spanning cross-continental group to be defined as a race because it would cause serious issues in a medical context. Spencer showed that statistically, where you’re from in the world can act as a predictor for what your race is. This is important in a medical context as it’s easier to know what diseases you are likely to be more susceptible to based on the origin of your genome.
Given his philosophical background, Spencer’s argument combined a strong statistical argument with sociological considerations. Spencer made his argument accessible to those with little to no background in philosophy or statistics while still including the intellectual complexities of his evidence in a meaningful way for the more familiar members of the audience.
The unambiguous nature of his dialogue was strengthened by the continued consideration and mention of fellow philosophers in the discussion of race talk. Spencer even included some objections brought forward by students who’d attended the lecture during this series at other universities, encouraging the audience to bring forward their own insightful questions for a chance to be featured in future lectures.
At the core of Spencer’s argument is a differentiation between monism and his radical solution of pluralism. Monism, in the context of OMB race talk, is the belief that OMB race talk is the one true definition of race and that there are no exceptions to this definition. Pluralism recognizes the many nuances in human identity. Depending on context, one definition of race might be more correct than another. Pluralism is the belief that multiple definitions can coexist even if at points they contradict each other.
Following Spencer’s prepared presentation, much of the audience remained, eager to ask questions about his conception of race. During this session, some parameters were defined that had not been completely clear initially.
The theory Spencer presented was not answering the question of how should we talk about race in the American context, but instead attempted to correctly define the way we currently talk about race.
Many questions followed concerning how we should talk about race, which Spencer answered broadly since it is the topic of his next book. Spencer also made clear that this concept of pluralism does not apply internationally. In some countries, you are defined by a single race which is printed on your ID card. Spencer pointed out that it would be hard for Americans to imagine carrying a driver’s license that listed one of four race categories which encompass the diversity of our population.

As part of this year’s program of Energy Week at Carnegie Mellon, which consisted of activities related to the energy sector and energy issues facing society, Carnegie Mellon students and members of the community had the chance to attend various lectures given by distinguished professors and scientists working in energy-related fields. Marcia McNutt, who last year became the president of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and who was previously the first female editor-in-chief of the journal Science and led the United States Geological Survey, gave one of the lectures.
The lecture began with Dr. Jared Cohon, the director of Scott Institute and former president of Carnegie Mellon, giving a welcome address and thanking the many sponsors of Energy Week. He introduced the role of Scott Institute in addressing today’s energy issues and recognized the attendees who had played a major role in the institute. Next, Provost Farnam Jahanian introduced McNutt with a statement on how science is a core part of America’s national identity while also recognizing Cohon for the work he has done for the university, even after stepping down as university president.
McNutt’s lecture primarily introduced different reports that the NAS has compiled over the years on energy-sector related subjects. First, she briefly described the history of the NAS, which was created by President Lincoln and chartered by Congress for the purpose of advising the legislative body. The NAS puts out around 200 reports a year on widely varying scientific disciplines, but McNutt emphasized that many of them match the themes of Energy Week: policy, research, education, and looking toward the future. Through her lecture, McNutt aimed to showcase how useful these reports can be.
The first report she introduced was a 2016 study, titled “Analytic Research Foundations for the Next Generation Electric Grid,” which described the characteristics that a modernized energy grid should have in order to meet society’s future needs — for example, the need for alternative energy sources for electric cars. The characteristics they found necessary include customer participation, integration of generation and storage options, new markets and operations, high quality of power, operation efficiency and asset optimization, and resiliency against attacks and disasters.
She also emphasized the importance of the grid being able to handle and analyze large amounts of data in real-time in optimizing the performance. As an example of modernizing the grid, McNutt mentioned that her home in California is a home that produces as much energy as it uses via solar panels.
Another significant report was one regarding the potential of using algae and cyanobacteria as sources of future biofuels. Using algae as a biofuel source has several advantages — energy security, no net greenhouse gas emissions, high biomass productivity, and the fact that it doesn’t compete with food, unlike other crops that are grown for biofuels, such as corn. However, the NAS report concluded that more research is still needed to make algal biofuels sustainable in the long run.
McNutt also mentioned a rare two-nation study that was commissioned by both the U.S. and China. Because the U.S. and China are the two top energy consumers of the world, the nations agreed to jointly research areas of renewable energy development which would be ripe for cooperation rather than competition. The collaborative areas identified were basic and pre-commercial research, the proper mapping of production sites, operations and management, recycling materials, and setting standards
Another study that tied together policy and energy identified the impacts of U.S. tax policy on greenhouse gas emissions. The report assesses different facets of U.S. energy-related tax policies — fuel taxes, renewable energy production credits, depletion allowances for oil and gas, home efficiency improvement credits, nuclear decommissioning tax preference, and aviation fuel taxes — on the levels of greenhouse gas emissions. The report concluded that while fuel taxes, production credits, and efficiency improvement credits helped lower greenhouse gases, the depletion allowances and nuclear decommissioning tax preference did not have a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions.
McNutt highlighted one study that she thought was particularly important which discussed the hidden costs of energy sources such as coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear, wind, solar, and biofuels. The report concluded that the biggest quantifiable hidden costs were greenhouse gas emissions and pollution. It stated that developing tar sands would worsen both costs while using renewable energy sources would lower them.
McNutt mentioned an array of other studies, on topics from the impact of the Helium Privatization Act to the prospects of LED lighting. She concluded the lecture by thanking several people from Carnegie Mellon who contributed significantly to the reports she presented.
At a post-lecture interview, McNutt was asked about her views on the upcoming March on Science, which will be held in cities nationwide on Earth Day, April 22.
“It is their civic duty to show their support for science, [and] to show that science matters,” she said in response.
She voices her concern whenever she hears people denying well-established climate science, and takes to Twitter to point people in the right direction on the subject. However, she expressed a note of caution to people interested in participating in the march. “I think it’s important that they march for science — that they not march against anything else. I would be concerned if they marched against the budget, or they marched against the administration,” she argued.
Citing her familiarity with the budget process as the former director of the U.S. Geological Survey, she advised that people should not jump to conclusions about policies too early since it generally takes a long time for anything to become law. Her primary concern was that scientists would come across as a special interest group, further politicizing what should be a neutral, fact-based subject. But despite these concerns, she says that voicing support of science is something people “should be doing as citizens.”

New coding method allows computer systems to better identify faces in crowds
Deva Ramanan, associate professor of robotics at Carnegie Mellon, and Peiyun Hu, a Ph.D. candidate in robotics, have made significant progress to allow computer vision systems to be able to detect tiny faces. This is due to an improved coding method that allows this system to look for larger things associated with tiny objects. 
Of the faces analyzed using Ramanan and Hu’s method, 81 percent proved to be actual faces. This is compared to the 29 to 64 percent found using prior methods.
Ramanan describes this accuracy as being similar to spotting a toothpick in someone's hand. “The toothpick is easier to see when you have hints that someone might be using a toothpick," said Ramanan in a university press release. "For that, the orientation of the fingers and the motion and position of the hand are major clues.”
Similarly, to find a face that may be only a few pixels in size, it helps to first look for a body within the larger image, or to realize that an image also contains a crowd of people.
Ramanan and Hu's method uses "foveal descriptors" which allow them to encode context similar to how human vision is structured. The center of the human field of vision is focused on the retina’s fovea, where visual acuity is highest. The foveal descriptor provides sharp detail for a small patch of the image, while blurring the peripheral image to understand the patch shown in high focus while not overwhelming the computer. 
The researchers will present their findings at the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition conference from July 21-26 in Honolulu. 
**Carnegie Mellon students compete in this year’s Three Minute Thesis competition **
Thus far, nine students have been identified as finalists for Carnegie Mellon's Three Minute Thesis competition which challenges Ph.D. students to present a compelling and easily understood presentation of their thesis and its significance in just three minutes.
This is Carnegie Mellon University's fourth year hosting the event, which started at the University of Queensland in 2008. Keith Webster, Dean of University Libraries, brought the concept to Carnegie Mellon and now hosts the competition.
"Our students are doing such interesting, innovative, and complex work," Webster said in a university press release. "It's a joy to learn more about their research and see how they approach the challenge of conveying it to a non-specialist audience."
This year, 78 graduate students participated in 10 rounds of preliminary competitions, which has been the university's highest number of participants in the competition. 
Michael Craig, a doctoral student in the College of Engineering, will be participating in the program for his third time this year. His talk for this year is titled "Grid-scale electricity storage: A help or hindrance for mitigating climate change?" 
"Last year I got too involved in the details," Craig said in a university press release. "But it's such a good experience. More people should participate."
Ania Jaroszewicz, who is pursuing a doctoral degree in behavioral decision research in Dietrich College's Department of Social and Decision Sciences, is competing this year for the first time. She says that Three Minute Thesis has given her an opportunity to think about how she communicates her work to people who might use it to help shape policy or nonprofit programming.
A panel of judges will select the overall winner and runner-up for the competition.

Here’s a candid confession: student government isn’t always sexy. Being in student government means spending days waiting for replies to emails. It means setting meeting dates two to three weeks in advance, not only because the department head you’re meeting with has a busy schedule, but also because your own calendar is packed full. It means redefining your dreams over and over again to satisfy a large administration and complicated student body or trying to find the line between dreaming big and dreaming up something affordable and realistic. For me, it’s been marked with learning that my dream school, despite having exceeded all my expectations in academia and opportunity, still has work to be done to ensure that all students feel empowered on campus.
It means filling notebooks with brainstorming sessions and resources for change. It means learning how to dig deep into the place you’ve called home and realize you can make a change, and it might even only take a few emails — which is how I got Carnegie Mellon to switch from Blue Books to its sustainable counterpart, Green Books! It means surrounding yourself with a network of intelligent, passionate people through the Graduate Student Assembly, Senate, or Cabinet and setting up a game plan for how you are going to bring your project to success. It means meeting incredible administrators who guide you and inspire you with their dedication to this university.
Actually, thinking about it again, if you’re someone who loves to see and be a part of positive, sustainable change, maybe student government is still a little sexy.
Now, let’s bring it back around to student elections. The people in these positions matter. When I think about my time in Cabinet, and the opportunities we’ve all been granted to leave a mark on campus, I get so excited to see what will come next from the next wave of student government representatives. How will they continue to push for the protection of our undocumented students? How will they ensure that the student body and administration learn how to empathize with and protect sexual assault survivors, first-generation students, students with disabilities or financial insecurity, and historically marginalized groups? There are so many opportunities to grow kindness on campus, and I look forward to not only seeing those actions happen, but also being able to express who I believe will best represent these groups through my vote.
These are the reasons why I’m voting in these student government elections. What are yours?

ecently, the drafts of six White House executive orders that outline plans to heavily crack down on the immigrant population in the U.S. have been leaked to Vox. Two of these drafts have already been introduced as executive orders on immigration at the border wall. Another draft has been introduced as the “Muslim ban” that temporarily banned entry from seven countries. The remaining three plans move to end programs that allow immigrants to come and work in the U.S. While the orders have not been confirmed, they align with President Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric.
The first of these unreleased orders moves to rescind President Barack Obama’s Deferred Action Childhood Arrivals (DACA). The DACA protects undocumented people coming to the U.S. who are under 16, are in school, and have no felonies from immediate deportation. While permits issued under DACA are set to begin expiring without renewal, Trump plans not only to make them expire sooner than anticipated, but also to ensure that new permits are not issued. This could cause a mass exodus of young immigrants who have done nothing wrong. It would also force children to pay for a decision they did not even make.
This executive order also aims to put an end to Obama’s attempt to extend the DACA to cover more immigrants. Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA) sought to protect the parents of U.S. born children. While DAPA has already been blocked in court, Trump’s executive order would also eliminate the DACA on which it was based, making further efforts to protect immigrant parents even harder to move forward.
The executive order plans to make the metrics for legal immigration even harder to meet. One of the ways legal immigration will be made more difficult is through the reversal of the Optional Practical Training work visa (OPT)xtension added by the Department of Homeland Security. OPT is a time period that allows full time undergraduate and graduate students who have finished or have been pursuing a degree for nine months to work for a year on a student visa to gain practical training in their field. This allows international students to pursue internships and other work experiences related to their field.
The reversal of OPT is something that heavily impacts the Carnegie Mellon community, especially when most companies are only looking to hire full time employees who have internship experience. The purpose of OPT is to enhance international students’ learning experiences by allowing them to also pursue jobs in their fields. Without this aspect their U.S. education is incomplete, with international students being given a back seat to the experience of American students. Limiting international students’ access to internships with U.S. companies almost eliminates their chances at full time careers with these companies. While the executive order states that its purpose is to prioritize “the interests of American workers and — to the maximum degree possible — the jobs, wages, and well-being of those workers,” it also refuses to reward a large portion of the college population that works just as hard, if not harder than American students for their degree.
This order also moves to reverse Obama’s decision to allow spouses of H-1B visa holders access to work visas. The H-1B visa is what allows U.S. employers to temporarily hire foreign employees. By denying spouses access to work visas, it limits a household of at least two people to a single income, making it that much harder for immigrants to achieve the “American Dream.” It’s another barrier that forces the tired, poor, huddled masses yearning to be free to be prisoner to an unfair immigration system.
Another provision in this order plans to get rid of the relief Obama granted for those eligible for green cards, but who are unable to apply because of the three and ten year bars. When an immigrant has been in the U.S. illegally for more than 180 days, they are barred from entering the country for three years and if they are unlawfully here for more than a year, they are barred from the country for ten years. This makes it impossible for those who want to receive citizenship to do so without risking deportation.
As if the aforementioned wasn’t enough for a single executive order, the last big impact that this order would have is to allow the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to conduct site visits at places that employ L-1 visa workers. The goal is for the site visits to eventually expand to all employment-based visa programs. L-1 visas allow foreign workers with specialized knowledge to continue employment in the U.S. with the same employer. It’s clear that the common theme in this executive order is to make the process for immigrants to secure work in the U.S. as hard as possible. 
The leaked final executive order also tackles a number of issues. The order specifically uses the term “alien” to refer to both illegal and legal immigrants. The first provision it puts forward is to ensure that sponsors of immigrants reimburse the government for the cost of welfare benefits provided to their immigrants. This is something that will eliminate the incentive for companies and sponsors to endorse immigrants.
The provision also calls for the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney, “to compile a report detailing how the federal government will save $100 billion by ensuring that aliens receive only the public benefits that they are eligible to receive.” This report seems to be just another instance of Trump throwing out large numbers to convince Americans that immigrants cost us more than they benefit, despite how much immigrants stimulate our economy and job force.
Another provision outlined by this executive order allows the DHS and State Department to decide on new standards and regulations for immigrants requiring public assistance. The rest of this executive order outlines various reports that would be compiled about the impact of immigrants in the U.S. Though we have not seen what a report of this nature would look like, The Tartan’s guess is that it would not paint immigrants in a flattering light just based on the president’s attitude towards them.
If these executive orders go into effect, which seems likely based on the status of the first three, it could entirely reshape the immigrant population in our country. Trump has brainwashed some Americans into thinking the reason that they aren’t getting jobs is because immigrants are stealing them. He’s failing to acknowledge all the work that immigrants do for Americans, sometimes jobs that American entitlement stops us from pursuing ourselves.
These orders could also make the employment for international students at Carnegie Mellon a lot harder. They come here to receive one of the best educations in the world, and Trump wants to make it even harder for them to use that knowledge in the American workforce. Immigrants are the backbone of this country and without their knowledge, creativity, passion, and ingenuity, America would not advance. What Trump needs to realize is that these orders not only hurt immigrants, but they hurt Americans, too.

Last week, I called my mother who lives in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, to speak to her about the electronics travel ban. The ban had been implemented by the U.S. government and restricts electronic devices larger than a smart phone on non-stop flights from 10 airports across eight Muslim-majority countries to the United States. When I told her about the ban, her response was, “well, you’re flying Emirates, so you can manage without your laptop for a couple of hours, right? You can’t possibly be that bored without your laptop.”
The electronics ban — to many people that I’ve tried to engage in this conversation with, including my mother — seems like a minor inconvenience. It seems to them something that is necessary to adhere to because “one can surely give up their laptop for a few hours for increased security.” However, to me it isn’t about the ban itself. It isn’t about the ‘inconvenience’ that passengers will face and it definitely isn’t about how to spend 20 hours on a plane. It’s about the mindset that implemented the ban — what the ban is supposed to do. It is the (perhaps subtle?) discriminatory undertones of the ban that I won’t be able to forget when I pack my bags in Dubai to come back to the U.S., thinking about the country that I will be returning to that hurt me on a personal level.
“We have reason to be concerned about attempts by terrorist groups to circumvent aviation security and terrorist groups continue to target aviation interests,” U.S. officials said in a statement to Al Jazeera, a Doha-based news broadcaster. In my opinion, these possible “attempts by terrorist groups” are not reason enough to justify an on-board electronics ban. The question here is, what makes these Middle-Eastern and North-African countries more susceptible to potential terrorist activities? Many airports in the banned list have very stringent security measures and Abu Dhabi International Airport even has passengers pass through a pre-check approved by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Sure, some news agencies report that the ban is in place because of an incident on a Somali plane in February of 2016 or because of intelligence reports on Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula which has increased activity targeting aircrafts. The fact still stands that it is hurtful to target only very specific countries based on their religious preferences, without a clear, nuanced reason that explains the ban, if it is that necessary to keep it in place.
The lack of a specific reason not only shows on the lack of thought process that went in implementing the ban, but also seems to be just a placebo to soothe those concerned by “terrorists from Muslim countries,” considering that the ban doesn’t affect carriers from airports like Paris and Brussels that have only recently been hit by devastating terrorist attacks. In that case, the fact that a placebo security measure had to be used, instead of an actual statement, is all the more alarming regarding the competence of the government in making the public trust it. Even if they do have information regarding threats to security, the security measures that they have put in place, i.e., the electronics ban, are by no means an effective way to stop a determined malicious attack — especially given that the possible electronic threat is still on board, if not in the passenger deck, then still in the cargo hold. Furthermore, this also compromises passengers’ potentially sensitive data since checked-in luggage is a liability, prone to theft, damage and loss.
An article in the Washington Post claims that these measures are to ensure the weakening of the U.S.-based airlines’ competitors, which often receive subsidies from the states that they are based in; for example, Emirates, Etihad Airways, and Qatar Airways. Should that be the reason, then the ban and the statements accompanying the ban are hypocritical and misleading. National security is not an excuse that should be used for an ulterior motive by any trustworthy and self-respecting government.
Again, the problem to me is not that much of an inconvenience. I would now have to either check my laptop in, or take a flight to the U.S. via Europe. It scares me that I feel unsafe in the place I come from because of all the conditioning that I have subconsciously absorbed in the U.S., and that I feel unsafe in the U.S. because of the place that I come from. But, it still hurts that I have to think about my identity, about the specific country that I come from every single time I have to step into the U.S.

In an age in which political issues are reduced to gossip fodder, it is hardly a surprise that Tomi Lahren’s firing from the conservative news network The Blaze has captivated the eager fascination of American political consumerism as though it were a celebrity pregnancy or breakup.
For those “special snowflakes” who haven’t been caught up on the drama surrounding the conservative right’s sweetheart, Tomi Lahren is a bitingly sarcastic, fast-talking, spitfire political commentator who routinely attacks liberal stances on the many controversial issues that plague our nation today. Or at least she did, until this past month, when her pro-choice comments earned her an abrupt dismissal from The Blaze.
Like unwilling viewers of a dreadful reality show, Americans reacted with a plethora of vehement opinions, from betrayed conservative anger to liberal disgust for her hypocrisy to reluctant sympathy from pro-choice supporters.
The true issue at conflict here, however, is not about Tomi Lahren, The Blaze, or even the abortion debate — it is about the fatally divisive hypocrisy that afflicts both ends of America’s political spectrum.
In one of her many irate, incendiary rants, Lahren criticized the political left for “preach[ing] tolerance and understanding, but only for those people and issues they believe in.” This type of opinion statement won Lahern widespread approval among conservatives. How ironic, then, that when she gives an opinion that her bosses don’t agree with, all her opinions are subsequently silenced.
Vilifying the opposition for their commitment to fundamental beliefs, while refusing to budge from your own principles, is hypocritical and detrimental to this already sickly political climate. Invalidating every opposing argument by citing it as intolerant is also fatal to the function of a democracy such as ours, the advancement of which depends upon conflicting viewpoints and compromise.
The Blaze is a network that caters to a very conservative audience; it is unsurprising that they would fire even their most powerful, recognized speaker for her rejection of a value so sacred, so inviolable to most conservatives. However, Lahren is also a nationally recognized pundit, and her dismissal makes an enormous statement regarding the image that The Blaze, as a representative of conservative views, projects to the world — complete rejection of any alternate belief. In the spirit of its own professed tolerance, The Blaze should have retained Lahren as a commentator whose beliefs are not wholly restricted by political party, thus forcing honest discussion and respectful, open-minded debate.
The difficulty with tolerance, though, is that people are only tolerant until a fundamental principle is challenged — when something is no longer a mere opinion, but an inviolable belief, such as racial equality or the sacredness of life. In fact, this sort of belief-level intolerance is essential to one’s moral character, and has historically been the fuel that keeps morality alive in this country. Intolerance of racial discrimination forced the passage of the landmark Civil Rights legislation in the 1960s and drove thousands of Americans to protest in Black Lives Matter protests, just as intolerance of bigotry inspired the Women’s March in Washington.
It is a very narrow path, therefore, that Americans are now forced to walk in this new political wilderness. One must tolerate others’ rights to hold their own beliefs, without wavering in the defense of one’s own principles. The Blaze, therefore, should have kept Tomi Lahren without sacrificing its own pro-life values, but rather respecting her right to hold an independent belief. Perhaps this, coupled with other groups’ efforts to tolerate and defend, would raise the standard in politics from rejection and repetition to actual conversation. It is the only way to escape the unproductive political rut that we’re stuck in now.

Last week, outcry broke out on Overheard at Carnegie Mellon when a Medium post by a Carnegie Mellon graduate was shared, titled “Empowering my Rapist and Revictimizing Me." While controversy brewed about the authenticity of the events described in the article, it created a surge in attention on the matter and caused people to raise a number of questions about the transparency of sexual assault cases at Carnegie Mellon and college campuses in general.
Based on the email sent out by Vice President of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno in response to the Overheard at Carnegie Mellon post, it is clear that the university does not take these matters lightly and understands the importance of providing educational and support programs to ensure that sexual assault is prevented and handled properly. As a witness in a stalking case, it was clear that the people I worked with in the university cared greatly about handling such cases in a proper manner and bringing justice and safety to victims.
However, a national policy that works to protect the guilty more than the victim sets legal precedents that can be destructive to college campus communities and potentially endangering to students.
In the comments section of this post, one student wrote, “Why don’t students receive crime alerts when a student sexually assaults another?” The answer comes from a law created in 1974 that was not even intended to deal with sexual assault. The Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) was written to protect the privacy of students’ academic transcripts.
However, its vague wording has caused it to be used in far more scenarios than intended by primary author, Senator James L. Buckley. Frank LoMonte, executive director of the Student Press Law Center, even goes as far to say that its unintended interpretations from being a law meant to protect academic transcripts to one silencing rape cases have transformed it into the “Federal Rapists Protection Act.” FERPA is commonly used by universities to prevent sexual assault case results from being published and shared with members of the community against their best interests.
According to The New York Times reporter Jon Krakauer, “When universities want to deny public access to information that might blemish their reputations, they routinely claim that FERPA prevents them from disclosing such information — even when disclosure is plainly warranted. In many instances, the suppressed records concern sexual assault complaints.”
He then goes on to describe a case he was investigating of a University of Montana football player who was found guilty of rape but was then not expelled after a far-from-transparent repeal process. The University of Montana attempted to use FERPA to shield any information on the case from the reporter and was almost successful due to the flexibility of its interpretations.
According to the National Women’s Law Center, FERPA allows “the final results of any college disciplinary proceeding for a violent crime or sex offense that concludes the accused broke a school rule or policy to a third party” to be released to witnesses, student groups, and reporters. However, colleges like the University of Montana have clearly overstepped their boundaries and put their interests before their communities’ interests in their interpretations of FERPA.
In the case of the Overheard at Carnegie Mellon Medium post, the accused student was found not guilty and, therefore, had the right to privacy. This is understandable because if there is even a chance that the accusation is false, the tarnishing of this student’s reputation and future could affect him for a lifetime. According to Slate, eight percent of rape accusations are reported by police to be “unfounded,” so false accusations are a reality and should be properly handled. While people have the right to be angry about such cases, we must remember that America is a country built on the foundation of innocence until proven guilty.
In the case of a guilty verdict or a false accusation beyond a reasonable doubt, students and members of the campus community should be given the right to access such information, and cases like the University of Montana one described in The New York Times article above must cease using FERPA as a gag order to hide information that could be crucial for their students’ safety. In order to ensure that such cases do not happen, FERPA must be rewritten in a way that preserves the privacy of students but is worded in a way that prevents universities from hiding information from the public that members of the community should be entitled to know.
After reviewing Carnegie Mellon’s 2015 Sexual Assault and Relationship Violence Study,it is clear that college campuses across America are facing a sexual assault epidemic. Out of those surveyed, 38.3% of undergraduate females at Carnegie Mellon University reported experiencing an attempted sexual assault. Even more frightening is the fact that 26% of them have actually experienced a completed sexual assault. According to Carnegie Mellon, this finding is no outlier and is “similar to what has been reported in the media for undergraduate women.”
Despite large numbers, “less than five percent of each type of attempted or completed sexual assault type is reported to [Carnegie Mellon].” 23.3% of unreported cases were not reported because the victim did not believe Carnegie Mellon had the authority to handle such cases, and 9.8% of cases were not reported because the person did not know how to do so. Clearly, there are places where Carnegie Mellon can work to improve, but the lack of transparency caused by FERPA is counterproductive to making students aware of the dangers present in their community and prevents things that could be productive to the community, such as the proposed sexual assault crime alert, from being materialized.
As a witness who went through the paperwork and non-disclosure agreements of a Title IX case, I can say with certainty that this is an issue of national policy. Whether with good intentions to comply with the law or bad intentions to shield their own flaws, the various interpretations of FERPA have caused universities to bar information on cases of sexual assault that are crucial to protecting the community. Why should a rape committed by a college football star be made any less public than one committed by any other rapist on the street? Cases like these should be handled with the same consequences, rigor, and transparency as ones outside of the university, and FERPA must be rewritten in a way that warrants universities to do so.

The 2016 election season, with Donald Trump’s discussion of walls and bans, brought immigration issues into public consciousness. His more recent executive order attempts at a Muslim ban have held them there. Although this is a debate about immigrants, immigrants and their families are largely not given a voice in it. This week, I sat down with three different first-generation Carnegie Mellon students to discuss the representation of immigrants and the children of immigrants in the media.
A common theme of these conversations was about how American immigrants are an especially hardworking group of people. Jai Ghose, a junior math major with parents from India, said that while growing up his parents especially emphasized the importance of working hard because they were immigrants: “for a lot of [immigrants], they’re like, ‘We have to work this much harder to get this.’ They didn’t have the same support structures [as other Americans].” Ghose strikes on an important point — a new immigrant coming to America has to entirely start over in a country where they probably don’t know many people and may not even know the language but have to assimilate to American culture and find a way to support their families anyway.
Another student points out that an immigrant’s ability to be happy and successful in America largely depends on their ability to remain connected to the culture of their native country. He says that his Colombian mother remains in constant contact with her sisters in Colombia and they visit each other often. The student’s father, on the other hand, is from Cuba and has had far less opportunity to remain connected to his homeland. Because of America’s complicated relationship with Cuba his father could not return to Cuba for visits, which was especially difficult when his mother died and he was unable to attend her funeral. Even calling Cuba was not usually an option as the Cuban government has  driven up the prices of incoming phone calls from the U.S.
The student says that while his mother is overwhelmingly glad she came to America and now fully considers it her home, his father’s feelings about having come to America have been much more complicated. The student relates his father’s experience of being cut off from his homeland to the experience of being cut off from one’s mother: “It’s like, oh, you can no longer speak to your mother. She’s there theoretically, somewhere faraway, but you can’t just talk to her. You have no communication with her. That’s a hard thing to do... and with the aspect of culture, it can be kind of shocking... foods and things you’ve grown accustomed to for your whole lifetime suddenly change.”
Despite all the challenges that immigrating to America necessarily entails, immigrants overwhelmingly succeed. As Madeline Kim, a Tepper first-year with Korean parents, notes, “[Immigrants] are more likely to attend college... and they actually add economic prosperity to America. They bring more jobs — they might start a new company or might otherwise open up new opportunities.”
Ghose’s and Kim’s parents came to America for education while the third student’s parents came to America to work. These cases are fairly typical, as most immigrants (both documented and undocumented) come here to get jobs and support their families, yet the news media routinely portrays immigrants as entitled and criminal. These negative portrayals have severely negative effects on politics and worsen subconscious biases against immigrants and refugees.
The students expressed that the rampancy of two-dimensional stereotypes has pervaded their everyday lives. Ghose and Kim both grapple with the effects of the stereotype that Asian people are smarter. This seemingly positive stereotype has, nevertheless, distinctly negative consequences in real life. Ghose commented that people always assume he’s good at math and will randomly ask him to help them with their math homework, but he wishes that people would see him as more of a complete human being. “A lot of people are hardwired [to stereotype me], so I have to always make a good first impression to show that I’m more well-rounded as an individual,” he said.
Similarly, Kim told me about a teacher she had once who would constantly talk about how her Asian students were so smart and then would grade them more harshly than other students. Growing up Korean in a small, predominantly white town in Alabama, Kim encountered many people making false assumptions about her, most with the implication that she was somehow different or foreign because she was Asian. For one thing, people would assume that she didn’t speak English or didn’t speak it well, even though she has lived in America her entire life. Or, despite the fact that she got an almost perfect score on her driver’s test, people would assume she was a bad driver before even getting in the car with her. These stereotypes are seemingly little things, but when they are taken as reality and repeated frequently, it can have a dehumanizing effect. Like Ghose, Kim wishes that people would see her as more of an equal human being to them: “As cliché as it is, we’re not all that different,” she stated.
As a Hispanic person, the third student has to deal with stereotypes of a very different nature — Latino men are often stereotyped as criminals. He told me a story about how one time he was buying mayonnaise at Giant Eagle but didn’t know which kind to buy, so, as any other college student would, he called his mother. Because he speaks to his mother in Spanish, he said that many people in the grocery store gave him weird looks like they were assuming that he was conducting gang activity. It’s ironic that even such an innocent conversation could be perceived as malicious simply because of stereotypes surrounding the Spanish language.
These stereotypes don’t come out of nowhere: they are drilled into people’s heads over decades through movies, television, and skewed news stories. Asians are portrayed as a model minority while Hispanics are demonized. The students I spoke to all agreed that a more holistic representation of immigrants in the media is needed. They seemed to feel that the biggest issue with current media narratives is that they don’t capture the full range of experiences and personalities. Negative or stereotypical portrayals are acceptable as long as positive portrayals and well-rounded characters also exist. More recently, however, good media representations of immigrants and first-generation Americans have started to crop up. The students listed Master Of None, Fresh Off the Boat, and recent episodes of Law and Order: Special Victims Unit as examples of media that portray immigrants as complex human beings with both strengths and weaknesses, expose microaggressions, and highlight characters’ cultures without making their cultures be their defining character traits. Notably, two of these shows were made by first-generation Americans.
As the student of Colombian and Cuban heritage said, “Immigrants are actual human beings who are trying to make a living, who are trying to feed their children... [to not have accurate media representation of them] is dumb, because we’re a country built on immigrants.” Immigrants founded this nation and have made it the country it is today, the least we can do in return is recognize them in our American media and give them credit for their work.

Even before Donald Trump officially became the 45th President, he had shaken up America with his list of things he wanted to complete within his first hundred days in office. One critical task on his agenda was to repeal and replace Obamacare. The original plan was to replace the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as Obamacare, with the American Health Care Act (AHCA). Despite the handful of executive orders and promises he has made in the first months of his presidency, he has found himself tangled in healthcare and expressed this debacle when he said "nobody knew health care could be so complicated."
It is not news that the ACA, or healthcare in general, is complicated or misconstrued in one way or another. Although Trump had consistently condemned Obamacare over the years, he has also consistently praised universal coverage. Despite Obamacare being a failure, “everybody’s got to be covered” and “the government’s gonna pay for it.” Perhaps the part Trump so greatly detests about the ACA is the colloquial name — Obamacare.
This is where the AHCA comes into play.
The AHCA planned to eliminate the funding of the Prevention and Public Health Fund and instead invest more in the funding for community health centers. Ultimately, this could jeopardize services such as the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Healthcare would become even more inaccessible. Currently, Congress estimates 22 million people today benefit from the ACA; if the ACA were to be repealed and replaced with the AHCA, approximately 30 million people in America would go without health insurance.
This is not the first time that Trump’s desires have contradicted those of traditional conservative values. He has proposed regulations to trade and potentially placed the First Amendment in jeopardy. Perhaps the repeal and replacement of the ACA divided the White House more than Trump’s other controversial stances.
Opponents of the AHCA were not and are not exclusively Democrats; many Republicans had shown criticism of the plan to “repeal and replace” Obamacare. The bill required a simple majority of 216 votes, meaning no more than 21 Republicans could vote against if the American Health Care Act (AHCA) were to be passed. 33 Republicans explicitly showed their discontent with the AHCA by voting no; 45 were undecided or otherwise ambiguous; nine expressed concerns or were leaning towards voting no.
Furthermore, conservatives in the House were not alone in standing up against the AHCA. The Koch brothers, the nation’s second wealthiest family widely known for their monetary political contributions, especially in the 2016 presidential election, showed their great discontent with Trump’s plan to combat the ACA by giving monetary incentive to Republicans opposing the bill. The Freedom Partners, a nonprofit conservative news source partially funded by the Koch brothers, denounced the AHCA as "Obamacare 2.0".
There is a myriad of reasons conservatives went against this bill. Some Republicans had echoed similar sentiments as the Freedom Partners. Representatives such as Rep. Thomas Massie (R–KY) and Rep. Mo Brooks (R–AL) did not find the AHCA to truly kick out the ACA. Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R–WA) did not see the AHCA lowering premiums, taxes, or expenses.
With all the division it has caused, the ACA has yet to be replaced, and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan stated that "we're going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future". However, people benefiting from the ACA cannot get too complacent just yet. Ryan is still determined to repeal the ACA, Republicans are trying to compromise to create a replacement for the ACA they can all agree on, and Trump still has that list of items he wishes to cross off his agenda. As far as how the replacement for the ACA pans out has yet to be determined.
