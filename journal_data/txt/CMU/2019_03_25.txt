The first week of March Madness just passed, and if you’re the typical Carnegie Mellon student, you probably did not get to watch much of what happened. Here’s everything you need to know regarding the NCAA tournament.
First, there were quite a few upsets to go around, though perhaps none as shocking as last year when 16th seed University of Maryland Baltimore County defeated the first seed University of Virginia (UVA) in the first round. This year, the largest seed differences in an upset happened between Murray State vs. Marquette, Liberty vs. Mississippi State, Ohio State vs. Iowa State, UC Irvine vs. Kansas State, and Oregon vs. Wisconsin, the highest seeded winner being a 13th seed. Both UVA and Duke nearly suffered upsets again as both their opponents managed to stay ahead in the first half, but were dominated nonetheless in the second. 
Second, several standout performances have garnered quite a bit of attention. Ja Morant’s performance fueled Murray State’s upset over Marquette, despite a subsequent loss to Florida State. During that loss to Florida St., he put up a triple-double and another 28 points. Morant’s performance almost certainly raised his draft stock, an unlikely story for someone who was barely recruited. Fletcher Magee of Wofford led his team to a first-round win over Seton Hall by draining seven three-pointers. During the game, he broke the NCAA Division I record for the most career three-pointers made. However, he gained perhaps just as much attention for the next game against the University of Kentucky when he went 0-12 from the three-point line in a loss, which is the record for most missed threes in a game. 
Third, Duke games are always matchups to look out for. Especially next game, they will be playing the University of Central Florida and their seven foot, six-inch tall Tacko Fall, who has been a defensive stalwart. Whether he can hold up against Duke’s Zion Williamson will be highly anticipated.
The second round will be wrapping up and the Sweet 16 round will also be happening this week. There will certainly be more action and drama that we’ll be staying on top of here at The Tartan, and hopefully so will you!

It’s a transitional point in the sports seasons. Winter sports are wrapping up, and the spring sports are just beginning. The end of the winter season means various sports have held their championships in recent weeks, like the Division I Wrestling Championships held at PPG Paints Arena. Carnegie Mellon obviously did not have attendees at the event, but the winner stayed in-state, with Penn State taking home the team title due to winning performances from three of their wrestlers (there are only eight weight classes).   
A little bit closer to home, however, the Division III Swimming and Diving Championships took place at the end of the last week, and the men’s team placed 16th at the competition, while the women’s team placed 30th. Individually, the teams had a few swimmers and divers earn times that garnered All-American Honorable Mentions. On the women’s team, the two members who attended were sophomore Jessica Chau and junior Emma Nicklas-Morris; both placed in the top sixteen of their respective events, which earned both of them honorable mentions. For the men, first-year Richard Dauksher, first-year Judson Kyle, and sophomore Justin Britton also all placed in the top 16. Additionally, the 400-yard medley team of Britton, first-year Colin Daniel, junior Sam Hawke, and sophomore Max Gonzalez set a new Tartan record with a time of 3:18.89. 
The other Carnegie Mellon team to make an NCAA appearance was the Indoor Track and Field team. 21 men and six women earned all-region honors at the championship, and three men competed in the finals of the event. Junior Evan Yukevich placed ninth in the mile run; senior Will Mitchell placed 12th in the 3,000m run; first-year Justin Kiefel finished 14th in the triple jump. Transitioning to their new spring season, the team moved outdoors over the break, when they traveled to Lexington, VA for the Washington and Lee Track and Field Carnival. There, first-year Lindy Cornwall broke a Tartan record for discus and placed third overall in the event. A few other runners, jumpers, and throwers earned first in their respective events at the meet. Just this weekend, however, the men’s team earned first in their home invitational; the women’s team placed second. 
Since spring sports are in full swing, the golf team was able to travel to Georgia over the break. The men’s and women’s golf team traveled to their first invitational of the spring season at Indian Mounds Golf Club and Pine Lakes Golf Course in Jekyll Island, GA. Out of 30 teams at the Jekyll Island Invitational, the men placed seventh and the women placed first. The women’s team broke a 54-hole, three-round record over the weekend by a total of 26 strokes, and they beat out eight of the top 25 ranked teams in Division III. And this past weekend, the Tartans hosted an invitational at Longue Vue Club in Verona. 10 members of the men’s team competed as individuals, the top three shot a 76, six over par, for a tied position in third place. Only one woman, first-year May Wang, competed for the Tartans, but she won the individual medal with a 79, seven over par.  
After a flurry of events for the men’s and women’s tennis team at the beginning of spring break, they are on a mid-semester break until their events begin again at the beginning of April. Including a few matches from the fall, the men’s team is 5–6 on the season, and the women’s team is 9–5. The matches beginning at the start of April are part of a wind-up to the UAA championships and NCAA championships. Most of the women’s matches are home matches, including a crosstown rivalry against Duquesne on April 6. Men’s tennis ends their season on a road trip to Ohio to face off against Kenyon University and Denison College on April 20 and 21.
Finally, the newest addition to the pantheon of sports at Carnegie Mellon — the softball team — began their first season in Orlando, FL. Across nine games, the team won four and lost five: an impressive start to a first season. They’ve also won three of their last four games, including a no-hitter against Eastern Connecticut St. (ECSU) thrown by first-year Scotty McGee. On the last two days of their Spring Break trip, the team beat SUNY Potsdam twice, and ECSU once, only losing to Haverford. First-years Audrey Pederson and Piper Johnson provided most of the offense on the last day, providing three home runs and 10 RBI’s across the games.

This winter, a new club powerlifting team was founded, with sophomore Sean D. Jin coaching and leading the team. Jin is from Bergen County, NJ, and is studying statistics and machine learning at Carnegie Mellon, where he’s an active member of a business fraternity — Alpha Kappa Psi — and Korean Central Church in Pittsburgh. 
The organized sport of powerlifting has its origins in ancient Greece, as do most games of athletic prowess, but contemporary organized powerlifting began in its current state during the 1960s when the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) started organizing world championship events for powerlifting. Since then, a slew of different organizations have created various leagues for powerlifting with different rules that allow or disallow doping, use equipped or unequipped setups, and recently, charging entrance fees for competitors. 
The club team at Carnegie Mellon competes within USA Powerlifting, or USAPL, guidelines. That means there are three categorized events — deadlift, squat, and bench — that collegiate lifters all perform at a competition. They mostly compete within the “Teen” and “Junior” age groups, as they are 18 and 19-year-olds and 20 to 23-year-olds, respectively. Recently, Jin attended the Pennsylvania State competition of the overarching USAPL organization, and he said, “I won first within my age class and weight group, and there were about a total of 140 lifters in my class. I tried to break the state record but failed to do that. I just didn’t finish my squat.” Jin was competing in the Junior age group at the 83kg category, and he also won Best Lifter within the Junior age group, which is a metric scored on an equation using age, weight, and weight lifted. None of the other lifters on the Carnegie Mellon club team attended the competition.
Jin talked about his experience at the meet as well, saying that he was in the gym where the competition was held from 12 to 8 p.m., and he neglected to eat the proper amount before his lift: “Making weight is really hard. If you’re cutting a lot of weight and miss by a couple of grams, you’ll get screwed over for the weight class you wanted.” For the uninitiated, cutting weight for any weight class divided event can be a herculean task. I’ve seen friends who wrestled in high school walk around school all day spitting into empty water bottles, sitting in a sauna for hours at a time, and eating nothing but lettuce or celery before an event. One of Jin’s friends cut 17 pounds before an event, and then put it all back on within an hour or two after his lift.
Jin’s favorite experience at the meet, however, was the social aspect. Meeting other powerlifters with the same intensity as Jin is a rare occurrence, and would only happen at a competition, like the one he attended. Jin said, “I came to the meet by myself, and I ended up talking to like 15 different people. I got their Instagrams, and will hit them up whenever there’s a competition, which is super dope.” Downtime is a large part of an eight-hour experience where you only compete for a handful of minutes, but Jin said, “It was a genuinely fun experience. You get to meet people you’ve never met before.”
As for the powerlifting team, it’s still a work in progress. Meetings for the group only started in January, and they’ve struggled to find the right times and places to meet; they haven’t been allowed to use the training room in Skibo, as it’s reserved for varsity athletes, and working around personal schedules on the team and the schedules of those working out in the gym in the Cohon University Center is difficult. It’s currently impossible for the powerlifting team to reserve a space for themselves in the way many other club sports are able to do with the turf fields around campus. Beyond powerlifting goals of making it to USAPL Nationals, Jin wants to make sure that the team is actually able to compete in a meet sometime, and for a team that just started with little infrastructural help from the college, there’s a positive outlook for the growth of powerlifting at Carnegie Mellon.

I’m in the newsroom with the 2019 NCAA Men’s Basketball Championship Tournament, and they’re on the phone with last year’s tournament. Here’s a short accounting of their conversation.
The 2019 tournament says, “Dad, I’m lost. I’m nowhere near as exciting as you! I only have upset by a 13 seed, and you had the first 16 seed upset. I could never live up to that.”
The 2018 tournament says, like a disappointed dad, “It’s ok, son. We aren’t all meant to be fun and exciting, but that doesn’t mean you’re not mad, right? You’ve got the name, the forty-eight games in four days, and a couple of upsets! It’s not like you’re the college football playoff…”
“But what’s my purpose, dad?”
“Some of us are meant to be boring. Otherwise, years like me wouldn’t be as much fun.”
Well, 2019 tournament, we thank you for your service. I’m sure we all understand the pain of a disappointed dad who doesn’t really understand how to console another human being, so I’d like to let you know, even though you put Wofford up against Kentucky way too early, I’ll spend an absurd amount of money on that merchandise you try selling for the winning team immediately after the game ends. Maybe I’ll even buy a team championship ring just so it has your name on it. I’ll even ignore the deep misgivings I have about the NCAA making a profit on that merchandise while student-athletes have empty refrigerators and coaches are unable to help them out due to some inane rule. Just for you. 
Back to reality, I understand that I may be one of, like, two people who hold the opinion that this year has been boring. There’s been really fun first round performances from Murray State, UC Irvine, Liberty, and Yale. And still, I’m finding myself falling asleep. Maybe it’s the lack of sleep I’m getting as a college student, or maybe it’s the spiders in my apartment that keep trying to crawl into my personal space. I guess they don’t understand the whole “thirty-three feet” rule for spiders within my personal space. It could also be the constant comparisons to the UMBC team of yesteryear when a 16 seed defeating a 1 seed was literally unprecedented. For the sake of returning the tournament to some semblance of realistic expectations, I’m going to make like a disappointed dad and say that we needed this boring tournament. Otherwise, where’s the fun? I mean, we all can’t have golden retrievers as our mascot and beat a number 1 seed in the first round, but maybe we could have an anteater and a 4 seed upset. Get’em next time, 2019 tournament.

In Oct. 2018, the crash of Lion Air Flight 610 took the lives of all 189 passengers and crew. The plane in question was a Boeing 737 MAX 8, the successor to the widely produced Boeing 737. 
An investigation following the crash uncovered a potential design flaw within the MAX 8 line. A system meant to bring the nose of a plane down to prevent stalling, known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), was found to be receiving numerous false positives from flight sensors, forcing the nose of the plane down. No matter how often the pilots tried to correct their trajectory, the system would override and reset itself, ending in a fatal crash.
Then, only five months after the first incident, a second MAX 8 crashed under similar circumstances. Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed on March 10, with satellite tracking data revealing that the plane had followed the same up-and-down trajectory as the Lion Air flight. In response, there has been a worldwide grounding of the MAX 8 planes, pending an investigation into the flaw that appears to be causing these fatal crashes.
These incidents have incited concern over the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)’s reliance on the very companies they’re meant to police. According to an article in The Washington Post, the FAA has delegated the safety assessments, which determine whether or not a plane is safe to fly, to Boeing engineers — a clear case of conflict of interest, but what many believe is a necessary compromise for an underfunded federal organization. 
Still, as reported by The Seattle Times, the trust may have been misplaced: the safety assessment Boeing submitted was supposedly filled with errors, a mistake that might have resulted in the two recent crashes.
But why would a company risk the combined cost of a multi-million-dollar plane, hundreds of lives, and their reputation? The answer lies in a single word: competition. In 2010, Airbus (a competing airplane manufacturer) announced a new, more fuel-efficient, more cost-effective plane that threatened the virtual monopoly held by the Boeing 737. 
In an effort to stay on top, Boeing launched the MAX series in 2011, but did not receive an FAA certification until March 2017. Here is where things get complicated: in order to cut costs on pilot retraining, Boeing decided to make the new series virtually identical to its predecessor. This allowed pilots to fly the planes with no more than a 13-page guide to aid them in this transition.
Still, some features were updated without the pilots’ knowledge. One such feature was the problematic MCAS, which was not mentioned in that how-to guide. This, not the lack of training, is what has left many pilots with feelings of distrust. They feel that just knowing about the feature would have given them the knowledge they needed to work around its flaws.
Instead, the pilots of these two incidents were left to fight a losing battle with a faulty system, not knowing what was happening as their planes flew into the ground. Although silently patching and updating software is not unusual in many industries, transparency and communication with the crew of a 45-ton airplane should be paramount.
The Senate will convene a hearing on the FAA’s certification of the 737 MAX 8 on March 27, where Boeing executives are expected to testify and explain the actions Boeing has taken. Additionally, the FAA has released a statement indicating that they will be monitoring a follow-up software patch intended to correct the MCAS flaw, but there is no timetable for the 737 MAX 8 to take flight once again.

Earth goes through periodic ice ages — years or decades when global temperatures become frigid, resulting in ice sheets and glaciers covering continents far beyond the planet’s polar caps. In fact, Earth has been through three major ice ages in the last 540 million years. Scientists have long wondered what triggers these chilling times, and a joint study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of California at Santa Barbara, and the University of California at Berkeley may provide the answer.
The study, published in the journal Science, finds that the last three major ice ages were prefaced by tropical "arc-continent collisions." In these "tectonic pileups" near the equator, oceanic plates drive over continent plates, burying the regular tropical crust and subjecting large swaths of oceanic rock to a tropical environment. According to the paper, this drastic and sudden change triggers a chemical reaction between the oceanic crust and the atmosphere, a weathering process where calcium and magnesium in the oceanic plates react with atmospheric carbon dioxide, producing carbonates such as limestone and reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide content. Over thousands of square kilometers, the phenomenon cuts enough carbon dioxide from the air to decrease global temperatures and trigger an ice age.
"We think that arc-continent collisions at low latitudes are the trigger for global cooling," said Oliver Jagoutz, an associate professor in MIT's Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, in an interview with MIT News. "This could occur over one to five million square kilometers, which sounds like a lot. But in reality, it's a very thin strip of Earth, sitting in the right location, that can change the global climate.”
A byproduct of arc-continent collisions is usually mountain ranges created at the point of the tectonic pileup. Mountain ranges such as the Himalayas contain sutures, the fault zones where the oceanic and continental plates collide, that have slowly shifted over thousands of years.
In order to study arc-continent collisions more closely, the research team tracked the movements of two sutures that comprise the Himalayas, both originating from the collision of the same tectonic plates. A supercontinent called Gondwana migrated north eighty million years ago, crushing against Eurasia and exposing a tremendously long line of oceanic rock to the atmosphere and forming part of the Himalayas we know today. Thirty million years later, the two supercontinents collided again, creating the second suture in the region.
Jagoutz and his colleagues found that both collisions occurred near Earth’s equator, in tropical zones where the weathering process that removes carbon dioxide from the air can have a serious effect on global temperatures. Indeed, both Himalayan collisions were followed by major atmospheric cooling events within several million years — a blink of an eye on a geological timescale. A subsequent investigation into the chemical reactions that most likely occurred in the Himalayan sutures found that they certainly collected enough carbon dioxide to trigger the ice ages that followed.
Of course, the next logical question is: how do ice ages end? The study posits a theory for this as well, explaining how the crust of the oceanic plate in an arc-continent collision is eventually eroded by the same weathering process that draws carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The newly produced rock does not sequester nearly as much carbon dioxide, allowing Earth’s temperatures to gradually rise to a normal level.
"We showed that this process can start and end glaciation," Jagoutz said. But his team was not ready to stop there. "Then we wondered, how often does that work? If our hypothesis is correct, we should find that for every time there's a cooling event, there are a lot of sutures in the tropics.”
The researchers wanted to confirm their theories by studying even older ice ages, looking for signs of preceding arc-continent collisions. They compiled the locations of all major suture zones on present-day Earth, then simulated the plate tectonics at the time and their movement patterns to trace the migration of sutures at continental and oceanic plates through several millennia. They identified three ice ages and the corresponding periods in which sutures of approximately ten thousand kilometers in length emerged in the tropics. Over the last 540 million years, the trigger of all three ice ages fit the researchers’ theory.
"We found that every time there was a peak in the suture zone in the tropics, there was a glaciation event," Jagoutz explained. "So every time you get, say, 10,000 kilometers of sutures in the tropics, you get an ice age.”
Looking ahead, Jagoutz observed that a major suture zone is still active in Indonesia today, which is likely responsible for the formation of extensive ice sheets near the polar ice caps and Earth’s upcoming glacial period. Given this finding about how oceanic rock at the suture is consuming carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to cool global temperatures and the alarming rate of human carbon dioxide emissions, some scientists have proposed churning through the oceanic rock at the Indonesian suture and spreading it throughout the equatorial belt to accelerate the atmospheric cooling process.
Jagoutz, however, has his doubts. He thinks the machinery required to grind oceanic rock would produce excessive carbon dioxide emissions in itself, and redistributing the minerals obtained might only have a negligible effect on man-made climate change. "It's a challenge to make this process work on human timescales. The Earth does this in a slow, geological process that has nothing to do with what we do to the Earth today," he said, "And it will neither harm us, nor save us."

Point one finger, and you’ll have three pointed right back at you.
Jordan Peele’s latest film, titled Us, is a wildly inventive horror film that premiered last Friday, March 22. Raking in $29.06 million on opening day, Us set a record for a single-day gross for a live action original movie, and was only $300,000 shy from beating the 2018 Halloween’s $7.7 million record during previews. I got the chance to see it at the Dolby Cinema at AMC, and it was every bit as mind-blowing as Peele’s first film, Get Out (2017). So — major spoiler alert!
Us is a surprisingly funny home invasion-centric horror film starring Lupita Nyong’o and Winston Duke as the parents in a family plagued by identical doubles called “Shadows.” The Shadows, determined to kill their doubles, tortuously follow the family, leaving the audience wondering who each character really is, and why they are motivated to do the things they do. This may sound like a typical film experience — after all, audiences should be taking a closer look at character motivations, no matter the movie — but in Us, it’s something deeper than that. As the Shadow, Red — Adelaide’s (Nyong’o) double — leads the rest of the Shadows in a sort of revolution, Peele raises questions about the value and transferability of souls and about the struggles of the lower class.
Thought to be “soulless,” the Shadows lived in nondescript tunnels, abandoned after the U.S. government enacted a series of cloning experiments. By creating doubles of humans, they could theoretically control them; however, what they ended up creating was an emptier shell then they intended. Between the human and their clone double was one soul, shared by their two bodies, resulting in erratic almost-human Shadows. However, when one Shadow makes it to the world above, they develop into a functioning human being with a soul. Which raises the question — is a soul something you are born with, or something you develop via environmental influences?
Peele invokes the age-old nature versus nurture debate in this film, but laser focuses the debate on the very qualities that make us human. Do the Shadows not have souls because they were never given the freedom of choice to develop one? Or do they not have souls because souls can’t be cloned? This realization alone sends chills down my spine — are souls simply luxuries because of our freedom of choice? Are they just parts of ourselves that we develop over time, much like a sense of humor or personality trait — not, as commonly believed, an inherent part of human nature? It is this very question that makes the Shadows sympathetic characters — denied freedom and denied choice, they were also denied a fulfilling life. It is difficult to completely hate them or separate yourself from them because of the traumatic and horrific past they’ve endured. It is this question that also shows Peele’s genius — his ability to navigate such existential and philosophical material and his ability to craft an excitingly horrifying film was on an impressive display in Us. And yes, the Shadows were the aggressors in this film. But whether or not they were actually villains remains to be interpreted.
The film also makes a significant social commentary on the class system and the system of blame. Red says it best — when asked what they were, she simply replied, “We’re Americans.” Not only are these Shadows more than just horrifying beings, but they were also people who suffered because of the government and because of capitalism. Many fans believe that the Shadows represent the lower class of America — trodden down by the government, a whole population was forced to fight back as a means of survival. Adelaide and Gabe’s (Duke) family represents the middle class, who fights only when they’re challenged, who ignore the plights of the lower class until they’re forced to acknowledge them. Adelaide and Gabe’s friends, Kitty and Josh, are the upper class: posh, comfortable, and constantly drunk, they completely ignore their own privilege in favor of luxuriating with a glass of rosé.
Digging into this metaphor for a harmful class system, Us becomes a clear picture of the erasure of marginalized peoples. The only thing separating Adelaide and her family from the Shadows is privilege — the only thing separating us from the marginalized is privilege. Humans continually point fingers at each other, placing blame for their troubles on others while ignoring the very real problems of those at the bottom of the ladder. Humans, Americans, us — we are the problem in this metaphor. Peele successfully takes the horror genre and interweaves a conversation set on erasure within it, creating horror within the world of the film, and within the real world as well.
Due to his masterful command of language and a camera, multiple media outlets have been hailing Peele as the new Kubrick or M. Night Shyamalan. This is true — to an extent. Peele’s intense attention to detail and his compelling plot twists have justified these comparisons, but we would be remiss to ignore his own originality and genius. Just take a look at the top 50 Friday night films — Peele’s is the only film not based on an adaptation, comic, remake, sequel, or existing franchise/story. In just his second film, Peele is one of the few directors and writers crafting a brand-new literature for the horror genre, re-inventing the home invasion movie and breathing fresh air into the clone trope for this film. No saw-bearing, ski-mask-wearing, no children-singing-lullabies-in-a-minor-key: Us instead creates new tropes for horror, and dynamic, powerful roles for actors of color.
The movie also received high praise for its casting of dark-skinned actors of color. In an industry that shows little regard for actors of color, particularly dark-skinned actors of color, Us is a tour-de-force of quality representation. Seeing a dark-skinned family on screen as the main characters in a genre with little visibility for actors of color was powerful for the diversity in casting movement. And it proved to Hollywood yet again the incredible talent of artists of color. In addition to the representation, the cast was absolutely fantastic: Lupita Nyong’o’s performance in this movie is nothing short of Oscar-worthy, and Winston Duke is incredibly charming as a goofy soccer dad. Watching the family on screen, particularly Nyong’o, I found myself forgetting that the actors played both the family members and the unnerving Shadows. Nyong’o was sweet, terrifying, assertive, and motherly, shining as the clear star of this film. If anything, I’d encourage you to see this movie simply to see her incredible performance.
The design of this film was also beautiful — morphing hip hop tracks into horror themes, comedically timing songs like “Fuck Tha Police” by N.W.A. to bloody scenes took the horror of Us to the next level. Creating such a rich environment with perfectly timed lighting or key changes developed such an intense build-up of suspense that placed you right in the film — wondering what you would do if your double suddenly appeared. Seeing this film was only made better in the Dolby Cinema, as the moving audio and vibrating seats boosted the effectively creepy sound design. The seats were comfortable so that you could focus entirely on the movie, without having to fuss about leg space or uncomfortable back rests. Best of all was the “Dolby Vision” — since the image was so much clearer, the film was rendered with a greater sense of depth and shadow. Which, in a film all about shadows, only highlighted the eerie lighting within the movie. For those of you who enjoy an intense movie-viewing experience (for either horror or high-speed action), the Dolby Cinema at AMC might be right up your alley.
Now as for me, I’ll be spending the next few days digging on Reddit and Twitter for fan theories and interpretations. I’ll probably be watching Us a second and a third time; one viewing simply isn’t enough to peel apart everything that makes this movie as fantastic as it is. Whether or not horror is your hypnotizing cup of tea, Peele is certainly refocusing the genre in a fresh, wholly original direction. Us is most certainly worth seeing.

Young, vibrant, and lively Tel Aviv. Old, heavy, and traditional Jerusalem. Practical, humble, and industrial Haifa. Our tour guide, Amir, told us every city has its unique characteristics. He stood on the hilltop of Tel Aviv, overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, and traced out the map of our ten-day Israel adventure. During this spring break, we, 25 Carnegie Mellon students from all backgrounds, sang and clapped in Jeeps trembling through the muddy ground of Golan Heights, navigating the roads between minefields marked by yellow signs; floated on the Dead Sea, covering our faces with mud and sharing laughter under the warm sunbeams of spring; woke up early to race the sun, to see how it unraveled over the striking beauty of Masada, an ancient fortification set majestically on the hilltop; wandered into the desert, connected with the stars above us, and looked inward to hear our true voices.
But apart from being tourists, our main mission was to learn, to find facts, and get closer to the truth. In the context of media distortion of Israeli and Palestinian conflicts, we flew across half the globe to understand the mechanism of the Israeli conflicts by experiencing them with all senses. We were lucky to have access to a variety of speakers, both Israeli and Palestinian. For the first few days, we listened to Israelis tell us the formation of Israel and its current day situation, and the Israelis’ constant battle against their Palestinian neighbors. Listening to our tour guide Amir’s provocative talk about the terrorist attacks organized by the Palestinian terrorist group, Hamas, and the importance of Israel for the Jewish population who, after centuries of struggle, can finally unpack their belongings and connect to a land, I ached for them. On the night before visiting Temple Mount in Jerusalem, we received a notice that Temple Mount was temporarily closed down because someone had thrown a Molotov cocktail, putting one security guard’s life in critical condition. Hearing the news at the dinner table while carefully cutting my dessert into delicate pieces, I was dumbstruck by how close I was to life and death. The airplane from the U.S. to Israel didn’t only pierce through thousands of miles of wind, but also through every kind of bubble closing us off from the cruel reality of life. I sympathized with the Israelis and accused the Palestinians for inflicting misery on the innocent citizens.
But the event took a turn on the fifth day of our trip, when we arrived at the wall that physically blocked off Palestinian refugees from the Israeli population. On the 26-foot tall cement wall that stretched to the end of my field of vision were Banksy’s paintings, along with messages for peace and shouts for freedom. “Make hummus not war,” Banksy urged. Make hummus not war. Our bus took us beyond the wall to the other side, through the gate with a giant copper key set on top, locking up the freedom of the Palestinian people. The twilight wind was merciless, tangling our hair and scraping the grey walls full of bullet holes on one side of the street. Our tour guide pointed to the wall and said, “Behind that is a kindergarten.” Then we saw three Palestinian cars drive past us — or at least tried to — but the cramped alleys in the refugee camp only allowed one car to grovel through, so the three opposing cars took almost ten minutes to move past a street corner.
“All our natural resources are controlled by Israelis,” the Palestinians said.
“They bombed our schools,” the Palestinians said.
“They took away our land and forced us into extreme poverty,” the Palestinians said.
So the Palestinians chose to take up arms. So the Israelis chose to take up arms.
So I, holding my camera in front of me, trying to create an illusory physical defense, trying to frame my intangible feelings into concrete presentations, stood powerless and crushed by the magnifying intricacy of this world that knitted causes and consequences into an inescapable web compressing all human hearts. It would be too arrogant for me to form an opinion or choose a side. So I sympathized with both sides. Cried for both sides’ sufferings, and in the glittering reflection of teardrops, I rediscovered the magnificent strength and beauty in humanity.
Our Israeli tour guide talked about hope, and with loving eyes he imagined a wonderful future for his daughter, Gaya. A Palestinian pedestrian talked about hope, in an adamant voice he assured us the conflict would end one day, that it would all get better.
It was a rollercoaster ride up and down the extremes of humanity and I left Israel with a heart beating faster than ever, stronger than ever. My feeling was shared by another Carnegie Mellon student, Manu Gopakumar, who used the word “sublime” to describe the trip. He elaborated on the word choice: “The beauty of nature, the beauty of historical religious site, the beauty of people living through these harsh conditions… all that at once inspired great awe and admiration.”

This week, Bohemian Rhapsody will be screening in McConomy. This film was also reviewed in a previous issue.
This was one of the most disappointing films of 2018. As a fan of Queen, the film was an opportunity to explore the complex life of an extraordinary man. But the film plays out as a greatest hits reel instead, with several inaccuracies written in for the sake of making the story more boring and generic. In fact, boring and generic are the two best words to describe the film. No one really has character in this film. There are no real stakes to the story or any reason to care about Queen apart from the fact that they’re a famous band. The editing was atrocious. It’s a joke at this point that the editing won an Oscar, but there was no flow to any of the cuts. It’s cut together like a hyperactive music video but with no real sense or purpose. This lack of sense or purpose applies to the entire film overall too. There are only two reasons to see this film: Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury is a revelation, and the Live Aid concert scene was absolutely magnificent. As a fan of Queen, you can check this out, but if you have no prior investment in the band, then there is zero reason to see this. Even for fans of the band, you may be very disappointed by the end product.

This past weekend, the Pittsburgh Humanities Festival took over the Cultural District. Hosted by the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust and Carnegie Mellon’s very own Humanities Center, the three-day celebration of the humanities, according to their website, “brings together internationally-renowned academics, artists, and intellectual innovators… to talk about stuff that matters.”
The first night, the festival hosted an interview and Q&A with Kevin Kwan, author of the bestselling novel Crazy Rich Asians, the movie adaptation starring Constance Wu that took theaters by storm last summer, spurring a change for Asians in Hollywood. Throughout the night, Kwan discussed his life story, the inspiration for his novels, and what it meant to him to be a part of such a huge movement.
Until he was 11, Kwan lived in Singapore, an international crossroads housing both tradition and innovation. Being uprooted and moved to Texas with his family was somewhat of a culture shock, and yet not at the same time. Kwan explained how the diversity of Singapore’s population and culture actually made him “colorblind” when he moved to the States, and he did not feel like an outsider. His parents were traditional in many ways, and they were not even aware that Kwan’s brother enrolled him into eighth grade upon coming to the U.S. — his brother believed him to be too smart for sixth — and he was fortunate in his ability to go to college, first for journalism, and then design.
While he pursues fictional narratives now, with the Crazy Rich Asians trilogy under his belt and several upcoming television shows in the works, Kwan holds fast to the fact that he is a journalist at heart. Stating, “I don’t have an imagination,” Kwan builds his stories around real events. Although many of the antics in Crazy Rich Asians were built upon stories he had heard from distant relatives and friends in those circles back in Singapore, believability was a major issue he faced while writing, since many of the extravagant and sometimes outlandish occurrences did not seem feasible to outsiders like his editor.
However, the fact is that Kwan never anticipated becoming a published author. He knew it was something he wanted to do eventually, but he did not recognize the “urgency of time” until his father’s passing, which was when he realized he might not have the chance if he waited until he was old to pursue it. Upon his father’s death, he inherited an album of old family photos, and the need to understand his rich family history and those special stories inspired his famous literary debut. In fact, some of the old photos displayed in the Young family mansion in the Crazy Rich Asians movie were actually pulled from Kwan’s family album. They did not tell Kwan this until he himself saw it, and he was extremely moved to have his initial inspiration play a part in the movie.
In addition to talking about his inspiration and life, Kwan also shed some light on Hollywood and the difficulties of making it in the movie industry. He explained how Hollywood became “fear-based” rather than “vision-based” after major conglomerates started buying out movie studios, to the point where they would just reproduce what they knew would sell. Instead of Hollywood picking out no names and making stars out of them like it used to, they started playing it safe and relied on the same casts to fill roles in repetitive stories. Not only did this make it harder for minority actors to be cast in roles, but they became an underrepresented group in the process and the industry as a whole. Kwan explained that this is because immigrants have given up a lot for their children and have expectations for them to pursue practical careers, but it is starting to shift now that families have been here for more generations and the options are widening for these descendants to enter more creative fields.
Kwan  is very excited about the prospects for the industry, as many television networks have picked up plotlines centered around Asians, and more roles, both on and offscreen, have opened up for Asians and Asian-Americans, including on-screen roles not specifically requiring Asian casting.
Kwan himself hopes to “strike while the iron’s hot” and explore a wide variety of genres and narrative formats while people are still interested in what he has to say. For now, he is developing the upcoming sitcom The Emperor of Malibu, which is loosely based on his own experiences as an immigrant “but with money,” as well as several other television projects.
As someone who teared up merely at the sight of being represented by an all-Asian cast on the big screen last summer, I am thrilled to hear that there is a shift in the industry toward more diverse casting and more Asian storytellers, and I loved hearing about Kwan’s experiences, inspiration, and insights.  He was a brilliant and witty speaker, frequently eliciting laughter and applause from the audience. Getting the chance to hear him speak and actually meet him after to tell him how much his work meant to me was a surreal experience that I am extremely grateful for.
As a side note to all those stressed college students, Kwan’s advice to his 20-year-old self may be of use: have more fun, and “relax, it’s hopefully going to be fine.”

The Pittsburgh Theater’s latest show, A Doll’s House, Part 2, is an excellent play dealing with the themes of choice, consequence, and responsibility. Written by Lucas Hnath and directed by Ted Pappas, it is a sequel to Henrik Ibsen’s well-known 1879 play A Doll’s House, and follows the protagonist Nora (Lisa Velten Smith), who has returned to the home she left 15 years ago to finalize the divorce with her husband that she thought took place but never did.
For a play that only contains four major characters and is just 90 minutes of dialogue, it was actually fairly intense because so much unfolds. There are surprising revelations, and even the revelation of the main plot point came as a bit of a surprise because of how much build up and anticipation there was. The writing is sharp and funny, with quite a bit of edge to the humor. There is such a natural flow to the dialogue, and when characters had arguments, it felt like they were actually arguing. It also refused to rely on clichés, instead staying true to the characters and not letting them make dumb decisions.
I always love watching theater acting. It is such a different experience compared to film acting, from the oral posturing to the way emotions are conveyed. Each character had so much personality and every performance is infused with many layers. It’s refreshing to see characters acting like they are real human beings and adults with real flaws.
Helena Ruoti, who plays Anna Marie, delivers the funniest lines of the whole play while balancing a level of sadness, and she walks the line perfectly. Marielle Young plays Emmy with a balance of innocence and mischief. However, it is Lisa Velten Smith and Daniel Krell, as Torvald and Nora, respectively, who comprise the heart and soul of the play. Their arguments and conflict drive home the main theme and ask tough questions about whether either character was in the right for the decisions they made throughout the play.
If I had any quibbles with the play, it’s that it does take a little too long to get going. But it’s difficult to cut anything out of this play. Ultimately, it all pays off very nicely with an ambiguous ending that pays homage to the ending of the original play with an intentionally messy thematic resolution. It forces you to think about it afterward, and that is the biggest compliment I can give to any play. If you’re a fan of good theater, see this at the O’Reilly Theater when you get a chance. It runs until April 7.

On rare occasions, you watch a film that is so unique and different from everything else you’ve seen, that even if you don’t know what to think, it sticks with you, festering in your brain, settling somewhere between understanding and curiosity.
Border (Gräns) is one of these types of films. A mix between fantasy drama, supernatural horror, magical realism, and crime noir, Border is an anomaly that dares to be different while telling a straightforward good and evil story.
Sweden’s entry for this year’s Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film (it was ultimately nominated for Best Makeup and Hairstyling), Border was the opening film of the Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival on Thursday, March 21. The theme of this year’s festival (which runs until April 7), is “Faces of WO/MEN,” focusing on identity and the freedom to define oneself. Border is a perfect example of this theme, as the story follows the protagonist, Tina, and her journey to learn who she is.
Tina (Eva Melander) is a customs agent at the border, and she is very good at her job. She has facial deformities that give her a neanderthal-like appearance, with blotchy skin, crooked teeth, mussy hair, and a crooked nose. But her competence as a customs agent has earned her respect amongst her colleagues, who look to her to sniff out contraband, literally — she possesses an ability to smell evil. From the first scene of the film when we see her in action, we know that Border is not normal, and is not about the normal world.
Outside of her job, Tina lives a relatively isolated life in her home in the woods. She lives with dog-trainer Roland, who is technically her boyfriend but more like a roommate, while her elderly father lives in a nursing home. She is friendly with her neighbors but is simply existing. Then, everything is thrown into a slow, tense tailspin when she encounters Vore, a mysterious man who looks just like her but can’t be anything but trouble.
It’s hard to divulge too much of the plot without revealing essential spoilers, but I will say that director Ali Abbasi translates John Ajvide Lindqvist’s short story of the same name to the screen with precision and care, toeing the line between multiple genres to create a fantastical story. At customs, Tina finds a man with a memory card filled with child pornography, which involves her in a larger criminal case. The noir subplot runs parallel to a romance between Tina and Vore, while the supernatural lore side of the story rears its head with old Scandinavian folk tales featuring babies and murder. It's very much a modernized fairy tale dropped inside a genre film, which reaps interesting results.
All these contrasting genres and story threads come at different times during the film, and it is a bit disorienting at the start, especially as the fantasy element of the story is still coming into focus. But Abbasi juggles everything quite seamlessly, making the initial confusion at the beginning of the film work by the end. The title itself obviously refers to Tina's occupation as a customs agent, but also to the borders between who she is, how she views herself, and how others view her, between her world and the world of those around her.
As Tina, Melander is stunning, working wonders through what must be hours and hours of prosthetic work in a makeup chair. She is completely unrecognizable but conveys all of Tina’s loneliness, pain, anger, disgust, and hope in her eyes. When she is in the forest, running through the trees with unadulterated joy under the sun, Melander makes us feel for her and care about her, and makes us invested in her story.
I will say that Border may not be for everyone. It’s a slow burn, and it isn’t until the halfway through the film that Tina and the audience learn more about her and the main mystery behind her past. Some of the supernatural and mystical elements may also be distractingly disturbing, though they work for the tone of the story. Border also contains the weirdest sex scene I’ve ever seen — probably the weirdest scene period. But by the end of Tina’s journey, I couldn’t help but connect with her as a person living her life, simply trying to figure out who she is. I can’t imagine anyone who can't relate to that.

Carnegie Mellon University has announced a $72 million, five-year cooperative agreement with the Combat Capabilities Development Army Research Laboratory (ARL), the “corporate laboratory that provides world-class research for the [U.S.] Army,” according to a university press release. The agreement will support “fundamental (publishable) AI research, which aims to collect, synthesize, and annotate…sensor data and information…and to deploy autonomous systems,” with the stated goal of helping human analysts sift through the massive amounts of data generated by the U.S. military’s various engagements worldwide. 
This announcement comes on the heels of several other prominent military partnerships with Carnegie Mellon, such as the Army AI Task Force in Feb. 2019, that, according to Carnegie Mellon President Farnam Jahanian, will allow the university to “leverage its distinct strengths in artificial intelligence to assist the Army in building a vibrant AI innovation network with industry and university partners from across the nation,” and “builds upon the university's long history of collaboration with the Department of Defense and industry partners.” 
Additionally, Carnegie Mellon entered into a five-year “Education Partnership” in Aug 2018 with the U.S. Navy, for which a primary focus is to “[provide] unique opportunities for CMU students to become aware of, and collaborate in, the many disciplines associated with all aspects of AI,” according to Navy press release on the subject. The research that will result from these programs, while public, published research, is inherently directed towards military aims, and will lay fundamental groundwork for future operations by the U.S. military. 
In this context, an AI system's decisions may be hard to understand. According to an article in the MIT Technology Review, the AI systems underlying technologies like self-driving cars are “so complicated that even the engineers who designed it may struggle to isolate the reason for any single action…and there is no obvious way to design such a system so that it could always explain why it did what it did.” The military seeks to use AI technology for “accelerating and optimizing decision-making,” according to a Carnegie Mellon press release, in order to help with decisions related to “health care, maintenance, logistics, acquisition, intelligence, and operations.”  
The use of this technology in a military context may also create situations where it is difficult to maintain accountability if and when failures occur. Professor David Danks, the head of the philosophy department who co-hosted a ”public listening session” with the Defense Innovation Board over spring break titled "The Ethical and Responsible Use of Artificial Intelligence for the Department of Defense” said, in a Carnegie Mellon press release, "While other people are thinking about killer robots, I'm thinking more about the human who makes the decision to drop a bomb on a building that turns out to be a hospital because the classification algorithm misclassified it. Killer robots are a long way away. Bombs getting dropped due to a misclassification? I'd be shocked if it hasn't happened already."
Researchers and workers have been recently pushing back against developing AI technology for military use. In 2018, thousands of AI researchers and more than 150 organizations signed a pledge that “they will not participate in the development or manufacture of robots that can identify and attack people without human oversight,” according to an article in The Guardian. The pledge states that the researchers “agree that by removing the risk, attributability, and difficulty of taking human lives, lethal autonomous weapons could become powerful instruments of violence and oppression, especially when linked to surveillance and data systems.”
In addition to these researchers, workers at Google and Amazon have resisted AI projects under development at their companies. Google workers protested the company’s involvement with Project Maven, a Department of Defense (DoD) AI project seeking to improve battlefield drone strikes, leading Google to a ban AI development at the company with possible military applications. 
The workers at Amazon were speaking against Amazon’s sale of facial recognition technology to government agencies like Immigration Control and Enforcement (ICE), stating in a letter to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos that the technology “will be another powerful tool for the surveillance state, and ultimately serve to harm the most marginalized.” 
It’s unclear what specific research will result from this partnership, but the young and growing field of AI seems to be experiencing increasing ethical scrutiny from many fronts. With Carnegie Mellon “eager to partner with ARL and with universities across the nation to leverage the power of artificial intelligence and better serve the Army mission in the 21st century," researchers here will likely have to grapple with this debate in the near future.

Every spring, the Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival brings new films from around the world to Pittsburgh, creating a space for everyone — whether they are film aficionados or students simply walking past an event at McConomy Auditorium — to come and enjoy international films with different perspectives and participate in meaningful discussion.
This year, the festival kicked off on Thursday, March 21, with an opening night showing of the Academy Award-nominated Border, a Swedish fantasy film. The showing also introduced the festival’s theme this year, “Faces of WO/MEN,” which aims to present a collection of films that tackle identity, gender, and everything in between. The festival will run until April 7 across locations around Pittsburgh in locations including McConomy Auditorium, the Carnegie Science Center, Regent Square Theater, and the Kelly-Strayhorn Theater.
“We're a festival that aims to open up avenues of discussion to tackle these topics that are global and human overall,” said Delena Obermaier, Head of Programming, Writer, and Director’s Assistant. “Our themes are something that is part of the human experience.”
Obermaier, who graduated from the University of Pittsburgh last year and is in her second year with the festival, and Film Festival Director Jolanta Lion considered many different themes for this year’s festival. There has never been a theme specifically focused on gender, but if the festival was simply “Faces of Women,” that would imply a binary, and that only specific types of voices and perspectives are worth sharing.
“[It’s] everything, every interaction between people in general and how they're telling stories,” said Peter Geyer, Head Student Coordinator, Head of Development, and Director’s Assistant. “It's more than just a label, and that slash kind of goes into…everything in between, and everything that makes up who we are.”
One unique aspect of the festival is that it is mainly student-run. Obermaier joined when she was a senior at Pitt, and Geyer, who is now a senior studying Business and Film, joined the festival as an intern his sophomore year. The festival’s staff is made up of undergraduate and graduate students from around the Pittsburgh area, with fields ranging from engineering to drama to business to design. Due to the student nature of the festival, the staff changes significantly every year.
“We always have different experiences and skills and connections, so that definitely affects the way the festival appears that year, or what aspects we have,” said Obermeier. “In the past, we [didn’t] really have animation, but this year we have some people who are very passionate about animation, so we have two films that include animation. The student aspect makes it a different and exciting festival every year while still keeping the same basic structure.”
The festival is international, and Obermeier, Geyer, and their colleagues make an intended effort to include a wide range of films and avoid including diversity for diversity’s sake. Not only do they want to represent the eclectic nature of Carnegie Mellon’s student body, but they also simply wanted to have different types of films that tell vastly different stories.
Another thing Obermeier is proud of is that of the festival’s slate of 17 films, 11 of them are directed by women. There was not an active effort to include several films by women, it was something they noticed after the fact, Obermeier stated.
“It just happened because we just chose good films, and oh, look at that, a lot of them happen to be by women. It's not hard to come across great films directed by women, and I think that that's a myth that's pushed around the film world a lot.”
While many of the films are focused on female protagonists, some films, such as Italy’s Dogman, is solely concerned with masculinity, and they are both looking forward to the discussion the film will instigate about toxic masculinity and society. Another film being shown is Mexico’s The Chambermaid, noted for its similarities to another recent film, Roma, but from completely divergent perspectives.
Ultimately, the festival aims to present timely, powerful, and global films but also to start a discussion about things that are relevant to everyone in the audience.
“Film for me has just an unmatched power to affect people emotionally and help people who have no experience with what a character's going through to maybe get a hint of that or any type of experience is like,” Geyer said. “People then want to talk about why they felt that way, why they felt uncomfortable, why they felt happy. The festival [provides] that medium…this culmination of exposing people to things they've never seen before and getting a conversation that wouldn't have happened before.”

On the night of Feb. 28, student members of the Korean Student Association (KSA) were preparing to host their biggest event of the year. March 1 marks the 100th anniversary of the March First Movement, an independence movement that spread across Korea in 1919 in protest against Japanese colonial rule, which lasted from 1910 to 1945. In collaboration with Liberty in North Korea (LINK), KSA was planning to commemorate the day by painting the fence and tabling in the University Center with snacks and cards that informed students about the history of the event. But that night, something dampened their spirits.
The day before, Feb. 28, University Libraries hosted filmmaker Craig Baldwin at their Library Speaker Series. A poster used to advertise the lecture was very similar to the flag of the Japanese military flown during occupation rule of Korea, known as the Rising Sun Flag.
The flag is viewed by some people in Korea and other East Asian countries formerly occupied by Japan as a symbol of Japanese imperialism. It serves as a reminder of an excruciating past in which Japan committed numerous war crimes and atrocities. In Korea alone, many people were forced into labor camps, 200,000 women were trafficked as sex slaves, and an unknown number of civilians were killed in horrific experimentations. “To us, the flag is like a Swastika,” said Eun Soo Koh, a board member of KSA.
The poster was included in a weekly newsletter sent to all international students from the Office of International Education (OIE). The insensitive poster was supplied by Craig Baldwin, who has used it for lectures going back to April 2017.
When some students saw the Craig Baldwin poster the night before March 1, they found it hard to believe it was a coincidence. The only difference between the poster and the Rising Sun flag are the color scheme and overlaying text. News of the poster spread among Korean and Korean American students on March 1, causing outrage and pain. KSA’s commemoration of March 1 went on as planned, but some participants were confused and unenthusiastic.
“It is still too raw,” said Eun Soo. She continued, “I’ve personally met and worked with former victims of sex trafficking. Many of them suffer from agoraphobia and face hardships post social integration. There are only twenty-five registered victims left. March 1st is and always will be a day I remember their stories.”
International students from countries formerly occupied by the Japanese Empire — Mainland China, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore, and Myanmar — comprise 24 percent of the student population, according to data released by the Office of International Education. 264 are from Korea, making up nearly 5 percent of the student body. Almost 39 percent of Carnegie Mellon University’s student body is comprised of International students.
KSA attempted to raise concern about the incident in a Feb. 28 post on the Carnegie Mellon Overheard Facebook page. The post was removed the next day.
The organization sent a letter to President Jahanian on March 2 addressing the incident. They asked that President Jahanian inform the entire Carnegie Mellon Community of the insensitive poster and reiterate Carnegie Mellon’s stance against acts of hate and bigotry, as he did on Nov. 29, 2018  after a book defaced with anti-Semitic symbols was discovered in Hunt Library. The letter was signed by the KSA, LINK, Korean Graduate Student Association, Multicultural Greek Council, Korean American Student Alliance, as well as professors Kyu Ha Shim and Tae Wan Kim.
President Jahanian responded via email on March 3, reaffirming that “cultivating a diverse and inclusive community is one of [his] top priorities.” He asked Vice President Gina Casalegno and Dean Keith Webster to investigate the incident.
In response to the incident, Hunt Library has modified its policies. They will now only use posters produced or commissioned by Carnegie Mellon. This was made clear to Eun Soo in two meetings with Jen Gilbride-Brown, the Assistant Vice Provost for Student Success and Equity, Linda Gentile, the Director of the Office International Education, and Shannon Riffe, the Director of Marketing & Communications for CMU Libraries.
Eun Soo told The Tartan that while she appreciates the effort that representatives of Carnegie Mellon’s “diversity-related departments” have put forward, she can’t help but feel frustrated. She says she has been told repeatedly by representatives of Carnegie Mellon that their “circumference of influence” does not grant them the ability to promise an official letter from the school.
“I have always felt proud to be part of this community that endorses diversity. I felt safe here, almost like a second home,” said Eun Soo. “Now I wonder whether that feeling had been mutual.”

Automation is one of the most pertinent technological and economic topics of the 21st century.  Central to the issue are concerns of job loss and mass displacement, especially within the transportation and marketing sectors.
In the political realm, the European Parliament, not without controversy, rejected a proposal to tax robots (well, businesses that own robots) and re-train the displaced human workers.  In America, U.S. representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has recently embraced a prospective robot and automation tax.  
Meanwhile, 2020 U.S. presidential candidate Andrew Yang has built his campaign largely around automation — proposing a universal basic income as one solution to projected job losses — claiming that “we’re in the third inning of the greatest economic transformation of industry in the world,” and that “our politicians don’t understand it all.”
Considering how the delivery robot market alone is expected to grow from the present $11.9 million to $34 million by 2024, with the transition from human drivers to autonomous delivery robots shrinking current last-mile delivery costs from $1.60 to $0.06, automation will continue to be discussed.
Carnegie Mellon University research, from the College of Engineering to the School of Computer Science to Heinz College, is focusing on one of the more positive aspects of delivery automation: energy-saving and consequent environmental friendliness. The U.S. Department of Energy has provided Carnegie Mellon with $2.5 million for research on energy efficiency and mobility intelligence for drones, autonomous vehicles, and robots.
Carnegie Mellon associate professor in Civil & Environmental Engineering and 2019 ASCE Pittsburgh professor of the year, Costa Samaras, is one of the leaders in the project, and discussed the implications of this ongoing research in an interview with The Tartan.
Primarily, his team is trying to figure out how much energy automated delivery robots and their complementing networks could save in the goods transportation market. Samaras estimates at least a 20 percent energy savings.
According to Samaras, “the transportation sector is now the largest contributor to climate change in the U.S. and is overwhelmingly powered by oil products: gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel,” and that “by electrifying as much transportation as possible, we can power transportation with cleaner sources like solar, wind, hydro, and nuclear. Automation can help by optimizing driving patterns and reducing battery sizes, which can save energy." 
Samaras considers the research a beneficial environmental initiative, claiming that “by reducing energy use and switching from an oil-powered freight system to an electric-powered freight system, there can be big reductions in energy use, as well as in greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.”
When asked about Carnegie Mellon’s greater role in automation, Samaras said that “CMU invented the modern autonomous vehicle, and the Robotics Institute has been a pioneer in advancing automated technology,” adding that “CMU has a long history in interdisciplinary energy analyses, and the many researchers and students affiliated with our Wilton E. Scott Institute for Energy Innovation make the university a competitive place to do cutting edge energy research.”
“A project like this that brings together engineers, roboticists, and social scientists is a natural fit for Carnegie Mellon. We're comfortable working across colleges and disciplines to solve hard challenges,” he emphasized.
While automation — especially in the context of transportation and delivery — has been and will continue to be a hot-button issue, Samaras finds it important to note that “one misunderstanding about automation is the idea that automation is either going to be all good or all bad for society. We humans have a vote to decide to maximize the benefits and minimize the consequences.”

Over spring break, a year and a half after Hurricane Maria, a group of 13 undergraduate and graduate students from Carnegie Mellon led by Tiffany Taulton, a masters student in Heinz majoring in public policy, visited Puerto Rico on an "alternative spring break" trip. Prior to the trip, the students had raised over $4,000 in donations to help the island in its ongoing recovery efforts. As summarized in several posts from Taulton on the CMU in Puerto Rico Facebook page, the students on the trip had the chance to learn from and work with various groups and people working on environmental-protection initiatives on the island. For fun, they went sightseeing (in Ponce and Old San Juan) and ziplining.
The group spent their first full day on the island in the city of Caguas visiting a local nonprofit collective called Urbe Apie, whose mission is, according to Taulton, "to develop the cultural and economic wealth of the community through compassion." The group spent the day learning about their work as well as touring the city of Caguas itself. 
Urbe Apie does a variety of charity work, including needle exchanges and clinical testing to prevent the spread of HIV and hepatitis, opening soup kitchens, providing free or cheap clothing for those in need, providing temporary housing, teaching art and yoga classes, and operating a community garden. Over a breakfast of vegetable omelets, bread, and fried Vienna sausages, the students got a lesson in the economic history of Puerto Rico from members of the organization. They also did volunteer work in Urbe Apie’s community garden and learned about the benefits of the plants being grown there.
Another organization the students visited was Casa Pueblo in Adjuntas. "We had the great honor to be received by the founder, Alexis Massol, who won the Goldman Prize (the equivalent of the Nobel Peace Prize for the environment) in 2002," Taulton said.
Casa Pueblo specializes in environmental advocacy, including blocking the development of mines in the area, protesting the construction of an oil pipeline, and working toward the goal of making the community 50 percent solar powered by 2020. In addition, "Casa Pueblo cultivates [science, culture, and community] through their work, arts programs, and collaborations with schools."
The students also volunteered with Coalición Restauración de Ecosistemas Santurcinos (CRES) based in the Santurce area of San Juan, which "is dedicated to protecting the sand dunes of Santurce and restoring the marine ecosystem." CRES was founded on a mission to save the coral reefs around Santurce, but the founders gradually realized that saving the coral was impossible without also protecting the land, because land-based pollution would flow into the oceans during storms and destroy the coral. Thus, they started working to collect trash and create green spaces in the city, including a community garden.
"CRES is now working hard to provide permanent protection to the area by buying land where they can and increasing public appreciation for green space where they can’t," Taulton said. From the founders of CRES, the students learned how to create in-ground compost beds, transplant trees, and make a rainwater collection cistern.
The Carnegie Mellon students had the chance for the second year in a row to meet with students and faculty from the University of Puerto Rico in Mayaguez (UPRM). They learned about the challenges of implementing community-scale microgrids — ranging from the difficulties of building local partnerships to the software and other technical components used to implement, monitor and analyze the grids, to the legal and political issues facing the implementation process — before visiting three communities the UPRM students and faculty were working with.
The first community they visited was Anasco Playa, which has frequently been on the frontlines of environmental and social policy battles. These include leatherback turtle egg poaching, the building of cell phone towers on Anasco Playa’s town-center beaches, sand mining, and the reopening of the community school. "It is now fighting pharmaceutical companies from dumping biowaste in the river that leads to ocean, and developers that want to get rid of the local population to build high-rise beachfront condos that will erode the sand dunes that protect the town from being flooded and serve as the nesting ground for the endangered turtles," Taulton wrote.
The second community was Anasco Corcovada, which is notable for remaining on its independent water system that arose back in the 1950s when the central government of Puerto Rico was not able to provide running water to everyone, while most other cities connected themselves to the central supply when the central government built up its water system. The solar-powered independent water system in the community enabled the town to turn on running water for itself and surrounding communities just two days after Hurricane Maria hit, while municipalities relying on government water were not able to get clean water for months. In addition to having an independent water system, Anasco Corcovada wants to become energy-independent and more resilient in the face of future storms through solar energy panels installed on homes.
The third community the students visited was La Salud, which was still visibly recovering from Hurricane Maria. The historical roots of La Salud spring from a 1950's U.S. initiative to industrialize Puerto Rico, which uprooted many farmers from their rural homes to work in newly-established textile factories. However, these workers didn’t have proper housing, so they built homes on land around the factories — and never formally put their names on the land titles. This became a major issue after Hurricane Maria when residents tried to claim FEMA assistance but did not have legal land ownership of the family homes that they had lived in for generations. Although nonprofit organizations have stepped in for some of the most vulnerable residents in La Salud, "judging from the number of damaged homes we saw...[there] is still a lot of need for help," Taulton wrote.
For Taulton and the other students in the group, this spring break trip was an opportunity to learn from those on the frontlines of shaping Puerto Rico’s future, and help with the ongoing recovery efforts where they could.

On Friday, March 22, Michael Rosfeld was acquitted for the murder of Antwon Rose II, adding another to the long list of cases where white police officers escape accountability for the murders of unarmed black men. The jury acquitted Rosfeld of all possible charges in less than four hours on Friday, and protests broke out almost immediately that night. Local marchers were joined by members of Pittsburgh City Council and even state representatives. 
For those unfamiliar with the case, Antwon Rose II was pulled over in a car that had been allegedly involved in a drive-by shooting on June 19, 2018 by Rosfeld and another officer. Rosfeld had been sworn in as an officer earlier that same day. Rose attempted to flee the scene, but Rosfeld shot him three times in the back as he was running away. He was unarmed, and investigators found he had not fired a weapon during the initial drive-by shooting. 
The use of lethal force by the police in the United States has plagued the nation for a very long time. The U.S. kills more citizens in days than most other countries do in several years. Even accounting for the fact that police have to deal with more armed suspects in the U.S., they still kill far more unarmed citizens than any other developed nation. In terms of major nations, this is a uniquely American problem, and it disproportionately affects minorities, specifically black people. It’s a problem directly impacting the Pittsburgh community, the community that we live in and should feel responsible for. 
The police in the U.S. have far too much power, and departments have been increasingly militarized. Between 1997 and 2014, the Department of Defense has spent $4.3 billion to transfer military equipment to local law enforcement agencies. One town in New Hampshire even purchased an armored personnel vehicle from Homeland Security. The town, Keene, New Hampshire, has had just two murders since 1999. There is no reason for them to have a vehicle that is the equivalent of a light tank. Police departments also have the right to seize property if they assume it is being used for a crime with civil forfeiture laws. But the most significant way in which the police have too much power is the lack of accountability for their murders. 
Police accountability is non-existent in the U.S. Cases of police brutality are often met with acquittals, and the resulting protests take place without effecting change. Even as police departments across the country introduce training that seeks to alleviate the issue, police brutality and the lack of accountability still pervades the American conversation on law enforcement. 
The lack of accountability creates a system in which preexisting biases and practices by the police are allowed to be acceptable. The phrases “not all cops” and “a few bad apples”  are applied to these situations, both ways of shrugging off a problem that disproportionately impacts overpoliced, minority-dominated communities throughout the country. This sentiment ignores how policies ranging from the war on drugs to modern gentrification have intrinsically contributed to the way the police operate in the United States on a systemic level. 
In Pittsburgh, gentrification has forced black people out of neighborhoods like East Liberty into less central areas like East Pittsburgh. The average median income in East Pittsburgh is just over $23,500 a year based on a census estimate from 2013 to 2017. Communities like East Pittsburgh are heavily policed. Statistically-speaking, poorer communities tend to have higher arrest rates. However, that is not, and should not be, an invitation for the police to abuse their power. 
By refusing to hold police accountable for their actions, the criminal justice system presents police as infallible. Even if the suspect is unarmed, the life of the officer is always considered more important than the suspect’s. There is an inherent bias in favor of someone who enforces the law over the suspect, and for juries, why wouldn’t there be? Police are glorified throughout American culture, ranging from our TV shows to our early education system, all depicting the police as heroes guarding us from vile criminals.
Even if we consider the fact that the police are only allowed to shoot fleeing suspects if they pose a credible threat to their safety, Rose wasn’t a threat. So why was Rosfeld acquitted? It’s just another case of a jury clearly biased towards the police and failing to examine the situation dispassionately. 
Of course, instead of examining the deep structural flaws in Pittsburgh policing, there has instead been an effort to help the police at our university. Carnegie Mellon research in predictive policing has gone to help the Pittsburgh police decide when and where to crack down, software that has been shown to be biased against black people.
Of course, the problems with predictive policing are obvious. It has the potential to increase the existing biases within the police department and contribute even further to the over-policing of neighborhoods like East Pittsburgh. The error of the computer would only serve to compound the human error. It’s repulsive that the university is helping strengthen the power of the police department with potentially flawed technology, despite having its own private police force. 
At Carnegie Mellon, we live in an environment where we are not policed as heavily as the general public. We need to understand the privilege of having our actions as college students treated with less hostility and suspicion. We need to think about black students at Carnegie Mellon, who might be othered and held to different standards. We need to think about the members of the Pittsburgh community who are stopped by CMUPD and labeled “suspicious males” in The Tartan’s own Crime and Incident section. We need to think about the ethical ramifications of our research assisting police, and not just shove it under the umbrella of ‘smart cities’ research. 
The police’s job is to serve and protect the people, not act as judge, jury, and executioner, or to intimidate for the sake of it. Under our current system, the police have been given too much freedom to run wild with their power. Reforming the system can’t work with changing individual department policies only; as with any systemic failure, improvements begin from the top down. The problem extends far beyond individuals, and will only change if we can keep the cops in check.

On March 22, the University of Pittsburgh Innovation Institute hosted its first annual “Hacking for Humanity” event, a 24 hour hackathon open to all university students in the area. Event organizers described this as a way for students to find interdisciplinary solutions to complex problems. This year, the event was focused on finding prototypes which can be used to track and prosecute perpetrators of human trafficking. 
Sex Workers Outreach Project (SWOP) and SWOP Behind Bars, along with the Thomas Merton Center, the PA Student Power Network, Students for a Democratic Society, Pitt Progressives, Pittsburgh Coalition of the International Women’s Strike, BiPgh, Trans Youniting, TransPride Pittsburgh, Hot Metal Hardware, and Fair Moans all participated in coalition to oppose this event for two main reasons: the criminalization of consensual sex workers and the belief that law enforcement is a solution to these issues. An alternative keynote speaker was organized by the coalition, which took place on Friday, March 22, just two flights of stairs above the Hackathon for Good’s actual keynote speaker. Students from Carnegie Mellon and Pitt helped to organize a walkout from the hackathon at the time of the keynote speaker, succeeding in bringing a few of the hackers along with them. The alternative keynote speaker event concluded with a productive discussion of different coding projects that would increase safety without relying on law enforcement. 
While forced labor and workplace violence may seem like uncontroversial issues, some local community coalitions and organizations oppose this event and others like it. Recently, the Pittsburgh chapter of the Sex Workers’ Outreach Project posted an open letter on its Facebook page asking Pitt to cancel the event. One of SWOP Pittsburgh’s main objections is to the use of “predictive policing” software in the quest to end human trafficking. In their letter, they wrote:
“Regardless of good intentions, such software will be used for the surveillance and prosecution of consensual sex work and will result in the increased abuse, harm, and prosecution of trafficked women. Because most victims of sex trafficking are arrested and deported for crimes related to sex trafficking, they will not be protected, but rather targeted by increased police surveillance. Female, trans, and nonbinary immigrants, and sex workers will be unfairly targeted by this collection of data.”
Laws and initiatives which target human trafficking often conflate sex trafficking with consensual sex work. A recent example is the “Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act,” otherwise known as FOSTA-SESTA. This bill, touted as a tool against trafficking,  holds websites criminally liable when users post materials “that unlawfully promote and facilitate prostitution.” This terminology lumps consensual sex work and sex trafficking together under the umbrella of “prostitution.” The result of this conflation is that consensual sex workers can no longer post ads, screen clients, or share the names of violent or dangerous clients. Many sex workers have been forced off of the internet and back to the streets, where work is far more unpredictable and dangerous. Gabrielle Monroe of SWOP Behind Bars reflected on this change: 
“[Since FOSTA] I’ve had friends join the houseless population. I’ve had friends physically assaulted. I’ve had friends sexually assaulted. I’ve had friends extorted, stalked and threatened. I’ve had friends evicted...I have friends who are hungry and don’t know where dinner is coming from tonight. Many on this list I have also experienced. It’s exhausting constantly being in survival mode.”
While human trafficking is a serious problem in need of serious solutions, law enforcement is not necessarily the answer. Studies consistently show that criminalization harms sex workers and does little to nothing to make an impact on sex trafficking. Sex workers report being sexually assaulted by police, sometimes during condoned sting operations in which officers “legally” have sex to completion multiple times with sex workers. These sting operations often result in few or no trafficking arrests. In many cases the only arrests made are of sex workers, trafficking victims, or customers, not “traffickers.”
Criminalization of sex work harms everyone in the industry. Moriah Ella Mason of SWOP-Pittsburgh gave us this example: 
“The criminalization of prostitution makes it easier for employers within the legal parts of the sex industry to manipulate and abuse employees... When I was working as a stripper I was raped by a customer in a private lap-dance booth. I was too scared to report it to management. I had been warned by other dancers that if you complained to the managers they would call the police on you and claim you were soliciting sex. I have no doubt that the police would take their word over mine.”
There are many alternatives to criminalization. Studies continue to prove that programs to reduce poverty and gender inequality are much more effective in the fight against sex trafficking. Decriminalization also means that individuals engaging in consensual sex work are not punished, victimized, and labelled as criminals with permanent records in the name of “abolition.” As Ine Vanwesenbeeck wrote in Archives of Sexual Behavior, “sex work criminalization is barking up the wrong tree because it is fighting sex instead of crime…” Ultimately, the people best suited to craft safe, effective anti-trafficking policies are sex workers themselves. Sex workers are closest to the problem, have the deepest insight into the nuanced working conditions of the sex industry, and, like those in any profession, desire to work safely and unobstructed while also preventing forced labor or workplace abuses. Many individuals engaged in consensual sex work are survivors of trafficking themselves and can provide valuable information related to these experiences. Until lawmakers and nonprofits include the voices of sex workers in the planning and implementation of policy, their actions will continue to cause harm and fail to meaningfully combat sex trafficking.
The anti-trafficking hackathon was a well-intentioned initiative, but in actuality only served to harm those it purports to help.

Like many other social media users, I experienced an explosion of articles about the college admission scandal over the past few weeks. William Rick Singer, the counselor who served as the ringleader of the $25 million scandal, aided over 750 families in cheating and bribing their way into several top colleges, including the children of celebrities like actresses Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman. To increase their children's chances of being matriculated to top universities like the University of Southern California or Ivy League schools, the parents of these high schoolers had others hired to take college entrance exams, bribing admissions workers, or abusing disability services. While many are rightfully outraged that college admissions that countless people could only dream of receiving were handed to unqualified applicants whose parents just so happened to have money, another facet of the admissions scandal goes quietly unspoken: the implications for academic accommodations.
I began college in Aug. 2016. However, it took until Jan. 2018 for me to finally reach out to Carnegie Mellon's student disability office to discuss accommodations. Although I had friends, family, and even medical professionals suggest that I consider seeking accommodations, it took over a year for me to accept that my chronic illnesses — no matter how invisible — was inhibiting me from being able to accurately demonstrate my abilities. My exam scores during this time period did not reflect how much information I retained from the course; it demonstrated the extent to which multiple clinical disorders could impede academic performance. Even then, I was in denial. I couldn't get myself to admit that I had a disability. Even with all these external forces pushing me into finally seeking help, imposter syndrome successfully discouraged me from doing so. I cannot imagine how someone without disabilities could fake a disability and still sleep at night.
Although I won the lottery this time around by having professionals who help me cope with living with disabilities and landing in an institution packed with people who want to work with me to help me get the most out of my undergraduate education, I realize that this is a privilege that many do not have, and one that I may lose the second I step foot off of this campus. Although the U.S. has anti-discrimination policies such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, there are too many instances in which disclosing a disability can impede a qualified applicant's job prospects. Statistics for those with disabilities are grim, putting them at higher risk of poverty, unemployment, and alcoholism. 
Even the act of writing and publishing this article leaves me with a massive pit in my stomach. It's easy for me today to say that an employer who is closed-minded against people with disabilities is not one I would wish to work for if given the option, but the truth is, that option may not exist. This is the reality of being a student and having disabilities; no amount of hard work or accolades can safeguard from discrimination.
As frustrated and angered I am that I have to write that the abuse of accommodations make resources that are absolutely critical to thousands of students appear to be a luxury that gives them an unfair advantage, part of me is envious of those who are able to abuse disability services. For them, disabilities are a cop-out, an excuse to get an unfair advantage. While thousands cannot seek these services for whatever reason, these people can exaggerate or even make up symptoms to get a note from a doctor that allows them to get some extra time for an exam. But for them, their disability disappears the second the exam proctor calls "time!" and they can go about their day.
For individuals with disabilities, these conditions are chronic, lasting years or even a lifetime. Whether we are inside or outside of the classroom or exam center, we have to carry our illnesses. As much as many of us would love to be able to enjoy our college years by going out or socializing outside of the classroom, many of us struggle to even get out of bed without feeling physically ill. Services meant to help us, such as academic accommodations and service animals, are adopted by those who want just a few extra minutes for their exams or a little purse puppy to tote around. It may be easy to dismiss the acts of those individuals as just that — individual acts that have no effect on others — but they make having disabilities appear trendy or fad-like. Unfortunately, having a diagnosable disability may be considered today's fad or trend, but once that fades and people move on to the next thing, people living with disabilities are still here trying to scrape by.

Just this past week, President Donald Trump called for an executive order that would mandate universities to support "free inquiry" in order to qualify for federal funding. Conservative ideals are seemingly under attack in higher institutions. OneClass content manager and blogger Jerry Zheng took to Fox Nation to share his study suggesting less than half of college conservatives feel welcome or even safe on campus. News stories regarding controversial right-wing speakers such as Ben Shapiro and Ann Coulter being met with wild protests from university students have caught national attention, sparking a debate on university censorship.
Although I do agree that universities should allow controversial speakers and encourage members of the community to respond with non-violence and discourse, I remain skeptical of the executive order. The First Amendment currently does mandate universities to abide by it, so this executive order would simply be redundant. Also, Trump has not had the most positive record with the First Amendment. Since announcing himself as a presidential candidate, he built his brand around cozying up with white supremicists and fighting "fake news." Within one year of his inauguration, he swore to "totally destroy" the Johnson Amendment, which would threaten the separation of church and state. During the Brett Kavanaugh hearings in 2018, he insinuated that the people should not have the right to protest. He continues to condemn news stories that do not portray him in the most favorable light, claiming that they are "fake news" or part of some "witch hunt." The list of examples of him not being in favor of the First Amendment continues.
Like far too many, Trump seems to accept freedom of speech... until it works against him. He supports it when it means he can say offensive or shocking comments that later can be used to tout him as a man who "speaks his mind." However, the second that the First Amendment allows anyone (including Fox News) to criticize Trump in even the slightest, it's suddenly an attack that should be extinguished. Seeing how enthusiastic Trump is in protecting the First Amendment in this context, I'm a bit wary as to how this executive order will be enacted.
Mandating controversial speakers sounds like a fair enough concept in theory. However, actually putting it into practice and enforcing it is where this executive order can falter. Presumably, Trump wants to enforce it because he believes that college campuses unfairly favor liberal voices over conservative voices. Although it is no secret that college students tend to lean more liberal, campus censorship is not a partisan issue. The Georgetown Free Speech Project (FSP) suggests that in terms of the number of speakers prevented from speaking on campus, liberals get the short end of the stick. Conservative and right-wing speakers who get the media attention, such as Milo Yiannopoulos and Ann Coulter, tend to be barred multiple times and rack up publicity. If this was flipped — meaning, a select few liberal speakers were getting national attention for being barred from college campuses and many conservative speakers were silently being rejected — I don't know if an executive order would be pushed. For a more holistic view of college campus censorship, we need to discuss how free speech is preached by many across the political spectrum but not protected with such zeal or enthusiasm when it involves ideologies differing from their own. Instead of banning voices, we should encourage students to host debates and nonviolent protests to counter these voices.
There are, of course, limitations to freedom of speech. There comes a point in which speech turns to extremism or encourages violence. However, these types of speech are unconstitutional and should not be (and are not) protected. What I do call for are more proactive measures of political discourse and a protection of democracy. The First Amendment does not have an asterisk that leads to a footnote reading "Terms and conditions may apply based on ideology." Although mandating "free inquiry" sounds good on paper, I hope that it is equally protected across the board.
