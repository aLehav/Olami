For many of us European soccer fans, the international break always comes at the worst possible time. Regardless of what team you personally support, the two-week hiatus from club football seems to always either break your team’s rhythm or result in key players lost to injury.
For the more prominent clubs, the break restarts and recycles transfer rumors and gossip over the players and their lives. For the smaller clubs, it brings about extreme boredom resulting from the lack of football activity. However, one thing all fans, regardless of club, can agree on is that we’re counting down the days until the break is over. To keep us distracted from the incessant drama or the boredom of watching Singapore take on Mongolia in a friendly, let’s discuss some prominent teams’ seasons thus far.
We will start by examining the two most important teams in the Bundesliga. First, we have last season’s champions FC Bayern, who started the season well under new manager Niko Kova, but are winless in the last four matches. It will be interesting to see how they cope with mounting pressure on their aging squad and their young, inexperienced coach. Second, we have Borussia Dortmund, last season’s fourth place holders, who also have a new coach. BVB started the season with a few unimpressive draws but have since grown accustomed to a new playing style, scoring three goals or more in each of their last three matches. We shall see whether they can keep this attacking flair as they face tougher opponents in the coming weeks, such as the solidly defensive team like Atlético Madrid.
Spanish club Atlético Madrid started their season perfectly with a win in the UEFA Super Cup against city rivals Real Madrid. They went on to stutter in their domestic La Liga with some draws, losses, and extremely narrow wins. Recently, they have done better, holding last season’s Champions League winners Real Madrid to a nil-nil draw in the Madrid derby and beating a well-organized Real Betis side. Then you have the two Spanish European giants FC Barcelona and Real Madrid. Both teams started their domestic seasons with straight wins followed by draws, a good return considering the significant rebuilding both teams underwent this summer. Then, however, came disappointing results. Real Madrid, with new coach Julen Lopetegui and in the absence of Cristiano Ronaldo, are winless in four games. FC Barcelona, after a summer of multiple signings, have one win in the past five matches. Over the coming weeks, it will be interesting for fans to see how both teams deal with mounting pressure.
Over in the French league, we have a high-flying Paris Saint Germain team with young superstars Kylian Mbappe and Neymar Jr. playing great attacking soccer. Despite the disappointing loss to Liverpool in the first week of this season’s Champions League and the appointment of a new coach, PSG are already top of their domestic league and are the favorites to win the Champions League. Then, we have one of the favorites to win this season’s Champions League, Italian giants Juventus. Their recent acquisition of Ronaldo and some young Italian talents have propelled the club to an undefeated start to their domestic and international season.
Another favorite to win this season’s Champions League is Manchester City, the 2017-2018 Premier League champions. Under coach Pep Guardiola, Manchester City has played some of the best soccer the world has seen. They are currently top of their domestic league and are favorites to win all their current competitions.
On the other hand, there is Manchester City’s main rivals Manchester United. The team has struggled to adopt coach Jose Mourinho’s defensive tactics during their last seasons. With one of their worst starts to the domestic season and an elimination from the Football League Cup, rumors were swirling that a new manager would be appointed. However, the team’s recent comeback win against Newcastle United dispelled the rumors for now. Then there is Liverpool, the young and exciting team considered by many as the only team able to challenge Manchester City for the league title. In spite of the disappointing start to the season by last year’s Liverpool star Mohammed Salah, the team has played well and is currently joint  leader at the top of the league.
English team Chelsea has also done well so far this season. New coach Maurizio Sarri’s tactics have improved the team and made them joint leaders of the league in points, with season highlights including wins against Premier League competitors Liverpool and Arsenal.
Finally, we have the two London clubs Arsenal and Tottenham. Arsenal started this season with two straight losses but have since bounced back and put together a string of consecutive wins. Their eternal rivals, a young Tottenham squad, started their season with no new transfers, but a series of wins. Recent losses, however, have dispelled some of the excitement that surrounded the team at the start of the season.
With all of this, we have covered the first quarter of the 2018-2019 European soccer season. The international break gives clubs a chance to regroup, but in the past it has also proven to be detrimental to hot teams. We’ll just have to see how everyone fares.
Despite it being obvious that soccer, and sports in general, is a matter of highs and lows throughout a season, we can all agree that there are few highs that match the excitement of watching your team play, and for this, we will just have to wait until next weekend when club football play resumes.

The Carnegie Mellon University football team hosted Bethany College Bison at Gesling Stadium on Saturday, Oct. 13. It was the 7th Annual Cindy Lackner Memorial Game, and was a tough back and forth matchup that was decided in a thrilling finish. The Tartans came out on top on Scotty Saturday, pulling off the win, 17–14. They now move to 3–3 overall and 2–3 in Presidents’ Athletic Conference (PAC) play.
The game started out slow, with both teams going three-and-out and punting the ball away. The quarter belonged to the defensive side of the ball.
After the first quarter finished scoreless, the Tartans put together a 10-play 51-yard drive to the get the first points on the board. On 3rd down & 2 yards from the Carnegie Mellon 41-yard line, senior quarterback Alex Cline threw to first-year wide receiver Kris Hughes, who caught the ball at midfield and crossed into Bethany territory to the 35-yard line. The Tartans made it to the 16-yard line but stalled, resulting in a 33-yard field goal by Brandon Nguyen, which opened scoring 3–0.
Bethany’s following drive ended with an interception by sophomore linebacker Darian Cohen after the ball was tipped by junior safety Thomas Polutchko. The ball went back to the offense, who marched down to the Bethany 8-yard line. However, the Tartans came away with no points after a sack resulted in a loss of eight yards, and a field goal attempt was blocked and recovered by Bethany and returned at mid-field. The Bison took advantage of the turnover and scored a touchdown, making the score 7–3.
With 1:10 left to play in the first half, the Tartan offense returned to the field. In the fast-tempo style, all plays were pass attempts. But like their last drive, the Tartans scored no points after a strip sack of Cline by the aggressive Bethany defense. The Tartans defense held the Bison for the remaining 21 seconds of the first half.
Like the first quarter, the third quarter began slowly, the first points of the second half coming in the final seconds of the quarter. After three drives ending in punts, the Tartans retook the lead with 1-yard rush from senior running back Rory Hubbard.
The score now 10–7, the Bison got the ball back with five seconds left in the third quarter. Transitioning into the fourth quarter, the Bison were unable to respond, and punted the ball back to the Tartans after a three-and-out.
In two players, the Tartans pulled away from the Bison. First was a 23-yard pass from Cline to senior halfback Karl Kumm along the right sideline to the Bethany 45-yard line. A false start penalty pushed the offense back to midfield. On 1st & 15, Cline connected with Hughes, who ran the ball in for the touchdown. With the extra point, the Tartans extended their lead to 17–7.
Later in the quarter, the Bison cut the score to 17–14 with a 11-play 75-yard drive that ended with a touchdown. With 2:47 left to play and a chance to come back in the game, the Bison attempted an onside kick, which was recovered by the Tartans. Nursing a three-point lead with less than three minutes to play, the Tartans turned to the running game to eat up the clock. On 3rd & 1, the offense decided to go to the air, but the 12-yard reception to Kumm ended with another turnover, a fumble recovered by the Bison.
The Bison had 2:23 left for one final chance to tie or take the lead. The Tartans defense, made one final stand. On their own 43-yard line, the Bison failed to convert on 3rd & 14, when senior defensive end Long Tran broke through the offensive line and blocked the pass away. On 4th & 14, a quarterback scramble threatened to change the momentum of the game, but the attempt fell just a yard short, turning the ball over on downs with 1:06. The Tartans took a knee in victory formation to close out the game.
Despite comparable numbers on paper, the real difference in the game was the Tartans’ ability to finish drives. The final line had the Tartans with 391 yards from scrimmage and the Bison with 337, and the Bison with more offensive plays (73 to 69) and time of possession (31:39 to 28:21).
Cline went 16-for-29 for 268 yards and threw a touchdown. With his 268, Cline became Carnegie Mellon’s all-time passing leader, surpassing the previous mark of 5,519 with his 5,746 career yards. Kumm recorded the first 100-yard receiving game after catching six receptions for 111 yards. Hughes wasn’t far behind with 89 yards on just three receptions and a touchdown. Hubbard led the running game 84 yards on 22 carries and a touchdown, adding 33 yards through the air.
After the game, Cline spoke with The Tartan about the victory, which came after two losses to Grove City and Waynesburg.
“It was an ugly win, but we pulled it out,” Cline said. “I think we can use this game as a steeping story for the rest of the season [and] can carry this momentum and focus on our next game.”
For his new passing record, Cline highlighted his team, and how every part of the team contributed to his 5,746 yards (and counting).
“Nothing gets rolling without the line blocking well and the receivers catching the ball,” he said. “It’s a great honor but there are a lot of unmentioned guys that went into it as well.”

As this week’s loser, your resident Photo Editor is here to pick up the recap. Bear with me as I try to navigate the Tartan Fantasy’s results for the first time. Despite my unexpected loss, it looks like I’m holding fast to my third place ranking.
Last Manning Standing over TARTAN FANTASY, 83.54 to 71.80
It was a sore loss this week for my team TARTAN FANTASY, defeated by Publisher Caleb Miller, who team, Last Manning Standing, has a solid 4-1 record, bumping him to the top of the rankings. Meanwhile, TARTAN FANTASY had a rough week, finishing dead last in the rankings, with Chicago Bears running back Jordan Howard letting me down hard with zero points. Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott disappointed by failing to beat projections, scoring only 8.40 points for TARTAN FANTASY. Last Manning Standing’s team has had a strong showing this season, with his starters raking in wins.
futbol over Gin and Bear It, 94.08 to 86.94
This week, Visual Editor Tracy Le’s team futbol took down our perpetually unlucky Sports Editor, Marika Yang, so let’s all enjoy the irony as Yang continues to sit in last place in the rankings. It’s hard to believe our resident sports enthusiast is the underdog of the season with a record of 1-4, but as they say, “it really do be like that sometimes.” Le’s team is sitting at fourth place in the rankings, but things are looking up for futbol, as it took a 15.00 lead on Thursday to speed ahead of Gin and Bear It. With Arizona Cardinals running back David Johnson’s two touchdowns bringing in 19.10 points and Cincinnati Bengals running back Joe Mixon finishing with a solid 17.50 points, team futbol managed to compensate well for the disappointing 0.00 points Greg Olsen pulled in.
Team Gin and Bear It’s loss can be chalked up to the underwhelming 4.10 points scored by Oakland Raiders running back Marshawn Lynch — a fraction of the 12.45 points he had been projected to score — giving Yang a slim but disappointing loss.
mmichelle123 over Slugs, 128.82 to 92.68
Pillbox Editor Michelle Madlansacay’s team mmichelle123 crushed Operations Manager Adam Tunnard’s team, Slugs, with the third highest score this season: 128.82 points. Madlansacay beat expectations, getting 38.3 percent more points than the projected 93.12 her team was expected to achieve. This lucky turn of events has brought up Madlansacay two spots to fifth in the rankings, a fortunate save considering she was hovering near the bottom, at 7th, just a week ago. Slugs met expectations, but a solid 92.68 was still not enough to prevent his descent into sixth place.
GOAT But Ironically over newz 129.24 to 84.02
This week Assistant Pillbox Editor Izzy Sio’s team (newly renamed) GOAT But Ironically got the last word by destroying News Editor Nora Mattson’s team newz in the second-highest scoring win of the season. GOAT But Ironically was carried to victory by Los Angeles Rams running back Todd Gurley, New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, and Indianapolis Colts tight end Eric Ebron, who collectively scored 79.34 points for Sio. Brady lives up to his name by hitting his highest point total so far with 27.54 points, and Gurley came in strong as well with the second-highest point total of the league. This strong performance put GOAT But Ironically at an advantage with the second-largest point gap win of the Tartan Fantasy League. Unfortunately, this win was not enough to bring Sio up in the rankings, leaving her sitting at 7th. Mattson’s team newz scored a mediocre 84.02 points, dropping to second place. Her strongest scorer was New York Giants running back Saquon Barkley, who scored 24.90 points.
Next week in Week 6, the Tartan Fantasy League matchups feature league-leading Miller’s team Last Manning Standing facing off against last-place team, Yang’s team Gin and Bear It, while my team TARTAN FANTASY will take on Tunnard’s team Slugs. Le’s team futbol will meet Mattson’s team newz, while it’s a battle for Pillbox when Sio’s team challenges Madlansacay’s team mmichelle123.

It’s already been an extraordinarily eventful October for baseball. There’s been the first ever postseason cycle, a position player pitched in a 16–1 blowout, Aaron Boone telling his players the wrong start time for a game, and that’s all just in the series of the eternal rivalry between the Yankees and Red Sox. The big news outside of the games has been the threat of legal trouble for the Dodgers because of their involvement in the trafficking of players from Cuba to the States to play baseball; but, there is little else at the moment, as the investigation is ongoing. The games are news enough, for now.
In the first National League Division Series between the Milwaukee Brewers and Wild Card Winner Colorado Rockies, the Brewers were able to sweep the Rockies by scores of 3–2, 4–0, and 6–0. Led by strong pitching, the Brewers gave up only two runs in the series, with both coming in a single ninth inning. There’s no way the Rockies could have won the series if 27 of 28 total innings were scoreless. The star of the series was 38-year-old journeyman catcher Erik Kratz. Kratz is the oldest player to start in a postseason debut since 1905, and he went 5-for-8, with one run and two runs batted in, in the second half of the series. With the help of the Brewers pitching and Kratz, they were able to advance to the National League Championship series, where they face the Los Angeles Dodgers.
The Dodgers, who made it to the NLCS by way of a four-game series with the Atlanta Braves, have won their third NLDS in as many years. In all three Dodger wins this series, they handedly took down the Braves by at least three runs. Dodgers pitchers Hyun-Jin Ryu and the standout Walker Buehler began the series strong with two quality starts and no earned runs allowed. However, the one Braves win in the series did demonstrate the future potential of their young team. Rookie Ronald Acuña Jr. showed off his talent for long home runs in the Braves’ 6–5 win by accounting for 4 of the 6 runs with a grand slam, becoming the youngest player to hit one in the postseason. But the Dodgers easily beat the Braves back in Game 4. The NLCS began Friday, Oct. 12 between the Dodgers and the Brewers.
In the American League, the Houston Astros faced off against the Cleveland Indians, who finished the regular season just over .500. Coming into the series, baseball journalists were writing about the lack of credentials for the Indians — they barely won the worst division in baseball this year, the AL Central. Three games later, it was clear that every critic was right. In the Astros-Indians series, the home-run hitting talent of the Astros  was on display and the Indians’ lack of talent showed almost everywhere on the field. Game 3 featured 11 Astros runs to three for the Indians, and in the seventh inning, the Astros capitalized on two errors by Cleveland pitching for three runs. The unfortunate part for the winner of this series is that they will be facing the momentum-driven winners of a Yankees-Red Sox Division Series.
Both the Yankees and Red Sox had 100-win records coming into the postseason, and for the first time in 14 years, the storied rivalry was renewed in October. It can only be good for baseball if the most intense rivalry in sports is rejuvenated. Baseball was buzzing for Yankees-Sox games, much to the ire of the Astros organization who lost primetime spots throughout the regular season and postseason so far to the rivalry. But we just love to watch two teams play great baseball with an intense hatred for the opponents.
Through the first two games, everybody got what they wanted in close games, great baseball, and a 1–1 split for the series. The third game was building up to be a classic. It was, in a way, classic. The Red Sox put up sixteen runs to a single one by the Yankees, and Brock Holt completed the first postseason cycle in history off a two-run home run in the ninth inning at the hands of position player-turned-pitcher, Andrew Romine. Game 4 was a close game, but not too close, until two Yankee runs crossed the plate in the ninth inning. However, it wasn’t enough as the Red Sox carried the momentum from their massive win back to Fenway, where they controlled all but one inning of the final game. Now, the Red Sox move on to face the reigning World Series champion Astros in the ALCS, which began on Saturday, Oct. 13.

Women’s Soccer
Over the weekend, the 21st-ranked Carnegie Mellon University women’s soccer team competed in two games, on Friday, Oct. 12 and Sunday, Oct. 14, in doubleheaders alongside  the men’s team.
The Tartans hosted 13th-ranked University of Chicago on Friday in a University Athletic Association (UAA) contest. Chicago rallied from a goal down to top the Tartans, 2–1.
In the 40th minute, the Tartans earned a free kick that sophomore Kristen Chong stepped up to take. The sophomore fired the shot from the center of the field, 25 yards out, into the upper right corner for her first goal of the year.
An unfortunate handball by the Tartans inside the box in the 47th minute led to a penalty kick goal, which evened the score at 1–1. Chicago continued to put pressure on the Tartans with shots on goal in the 54th and 57th minutes.
The Tartans had some chances in the second half, but failed to convert. Chicago scored the go-ahead goal in the 85th minute with a shot from the left side to the far post.
Senior Kaily Bruch had an opportunity to tie the game a minute later but was denied the shot.
Men’s Soccer
On the men’s side, the 13th-ranked squad took on the No. 1 ranked University of Chicago on Friday. The Maroons fought back from an early goal by the Tartans to stay unbeaten with a 2–1 victory. The Tartans are now 8–2–2 overall and 1–2 in the UAA.
To start the scoring, Senior Anthony Gulli picked off inside the 18-yard box and put a shot in the net at the far post for the 1–0 Carnegie Mellon lead.Chicago knotted the score at one in the 17th minute with a play into the box. Less than three minutes later the Maroons served a ball for a header which Tartan keeper Alec Lam swatted away, making him unable to defend a rebound header for the go-ahead goal.
On Sunday, the Tartans hosted 23rd-ranked Washington University in St. Louis, with the Bears earning a 2–1 double-overtime victory. The Tartans are now 8–3–1 overall and 1–3 in UAA play.
Junior Elliot Cohen put the Tartans ahead 1–0 in the 14th minute after he headed in a long pass from Junior defender Jacob Moskowitz. In the 35th minute, the Bears put a shot by Lam, firing a shot from two yards out and over Lam who attempted to cut the angle.
In the second half, Cohen’s low-driving shot in the 71st minute was stopped while Lam continuously came off his line to punch service attempts clear of the net.
Washington had three scoring opportunities in the first overtime but all three were wide of the net. In the first minute of the second session, the Bears got forward and scored off a rebounded shot.
Volleyball
The Carnegie Mellon University volleyball team hosted the UAA Round Robin #2 over the weekend.
On Saturday, the Tartans split their matches, falling 3–2 to Washington University in St. Louis (WashU) and defeating Brandeis University in straight sets. They are now 15–6 for the year and 4–1 in UAA play.
In the five-set thriller with WashU, the Tartans  dropped the first set 25–19 before the second set went in favor of the Bears, 28–26. The third set also took extra points, as the Tartans picked up a 27–25 win. After a fourth set win by the Tartans, 25–21, the match went to the deciding fifth set. The Bears pulled out to a 9–5 lead and finished off the match with a 15–10 win.
Against Brandeis, Jurgens led the offensive attack with eight kills while Mueller and sophomore Jordan Allen each had five kills. Foose picked up another three block assists and Yew led the defense with 11 digs.
On Sunday, the Tartans welcomed Case Western Reserve University. The Tartans won three sets to one, 25–18, 25–19, 19–25, 25–18. Mueller led the team with 20 kills, closely followed by Jurgens with 16. Yew recorded 23 digs, while So-Holloway had a team-high 54 assists.
Next week, the Tartans will be back at home hosting the Carnegie Mellon Tournament. Their first match is set for Friday, Oct. 19 against Alma College.

You know what they say: another year, another contribution to the preponderance of scientific evidence that humans had a lot of sex with Neanderthals. 
A new study by David Enard, assistant professor at the University of Arizona Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department, and Dmitri Petrov, the Michelle and Kevin Douglas Professor of Biology at Stanford University, suggests that this interaction may have played a key role in humans not dying from a Neanderthal cold back in the day.
Enard and Petrov looked at the parts of the human genome that have to do with defense against pathogens, and compared these stretches with that of the Neanderthal genome. They found that there was a similarity, suggesting that Neanderthal DNA plays a part in our modern genetic foundation for immunity.
The close contact between Neanderthals and humans at at least two points in history, Enard and Petrov claim, meant that Neanderthals and humans passed between them their species-specific viruses. Luckily for us, human and Neanderthal genetic interaction in the form of procreation also probably passed along the alleles needed for better immunity. The protection, and the evolutionary positive selection that that affords, also answers the question of why humans may have retained some Neanderthal DNA into the modern era.
Neanderthals and humans diverged genetically around 500,000 to 800,000 years ago. Human contact with Neanderthals around B.C. 70,000 in Eurasia left genetic evidence of Neanderthal DNA in most humans not of African descent. This study adds a building block to the ways that this DNA might affect human development to this day. 
Viruses are more important in shaping genetics than you might think. These Neanderthal viruses, and whether or not people had immunity passed on from the Neanderthals, decided which humans that came in contact with Neanderthals and their pathogens would survive to pass on their genes through positive selection.
The "poison-antidote" theory, or the theory that Neanderthals and humans were able to survive exposure to new pathogen exposure through intermingling had been theorized, but this study provides "preliminary evidence" that this theory might have indeed transpired. The authors suggest that 32 percent of Asians and 25 percent of Europeans might have been genetically affected by this positive selection.
Enard, in and interview with Science Daily, marveled at the discoveries that can be made by delving into DNA. "You can think of these genetic adaptations like footprints from long-extinct dinosaurs preserved in fossilized mud."

On Aug. 31, the California state legislature passed Senate Bill 822, which creates regulations to preserve free and equal access to the internet. On Sept. 30, Governor Jerry Brown signed the bill into law.
Mere hours later, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a suit with the state of California, claiming that the bill attempted to impose regulations outside the state's jurisdiction. On Oct. 3, telecommunications industry groups — The American Cable Association, the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (a group representing the wireless industry), the National Cable Television Association, and USTelecom (representing the broadband association) — jointly filed their own suit in California's federal district court.
“Under the Constitution, states do not regulate interstate commerce — the federal government does," said U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions in a statement. The telecommunications groups back up the federal stance: “As the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has repeatedly recognized, due to the inherently interstate nature of Internet service, it is impossible or impracticable for an Internet service provider... to distinguish traffic that moves only within California from traffic that crosses state borders.”
Supporters of the law argue that it institutes basic consumer protection for residents of California. "Big telecom companies hate the California net neutrality bill because it prevents them from screwing over their customers more than they already do,” said Evan Greer, deputy director of activist group Fight for the Future, in a statement.
In Dec. 2017, the FCC's five commissioners voted 3-2 to repeal the federal net neutrality protections that had been in place since 2015. The rules prohibited various practices considered unfair — charging more for faster internet service, for instance, or charging different prices for visiting different sites — and the vote to repeal them was widely decried by consumers, legislators, and advocacy groups. "This decision puts the Federal Communications Commission on the wrong side of history, the wrong side of the law, and the wrong side of the American public," wrote Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, one of the two who voted against the measure, in her dissent.
California is not the first state to enact its own net neutrality rules — nine other states have taken action either through legislation or gubernatorial executive order — but, as the U.S.'s most populous state and home to the headquarters of many leaders in the tech industry, a net neutrality victory could set a precedent for standards in other states.
The net neutrality provisions in SB 822 are also some of the nation's strictest. The bill largely mirrors the recently abolished federal protections, but enhances them by banning the use of "zero-rating" by internet providers to restrict access to services other than their own — for example, allowing users to view the provider's own video streaming service for free, but charging for viewing Netflix, Hulu, and other external streaming services.
“The fight for social change and progressive values is directly tied to a free and open internet,” said Assemblyman Miguel Santiago (D-Los Angeles) to the LA Times after the bill was signed. “This measure ensures that we, in California, will maintain a free and open internet that doesn’t discriminate or price users or content differently.” Santiago, who initially attempted to scale back SB 822 but faced pressured from his constituents, is a co-author of the final bill. 
Industry groups claim the law will not protect consumers and will achieve nothing but wasting the time of internet service providers and the government as they work to ensure compliance.
"Once again the California legislature has enacted an extreme and illegal state law attempting to frustrate federal policy," said Sessions. "The Justice Department should not have to spend valuable time and resources to file this suit today, but we have a duty to defend the prerogatives of the federal government and protect our Constitutional order. We will do so with vigor. We are confident that we will prevail in this case — because the facts are on our side.”
California lawmakers, however, are prepared to hold their own. "Unlike [Chairman Ajit] Pai's FCC, California isn't run by the big telecom and cable companies," said California State Senator Scott Wiener, original author of SB 822. "Pai can take whatever potshots at California he wants. The reality is that California is the world's innovation capital, and unlike the crony capitalism promoted by the Trump administration, California understands exactly what it takes to foster an open innovation economy with a level playing field."

There’s a quite a bit of excitement surrounding the JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) Hyabusa2 project, and rightly so — launched in Dec. 2014, the mothership and its hopping probes have not only reached the Ryugu asteroid, but have also sent back stunning images of the asteroid’s surface, giving us a close view of these flying chunks of space rock. However, JAXA will have to wait a little longer to get physical samples from the asteroid: the mothership's landing on Ryugu has been delayed until January.
The Hyabusa2 project consists of three separate phases. First, after the mothership arrived in Ryugu’s orbit, two solar powered hoppers named MINERVA-II 1A and MINERVA-II 1B were sent to scour the surface, taking a different approach to traditional wheeled rovers by leveraging the weak gravity to literally jump from point to point. Following this came MASCOT, a smaller, more short-lived lander tasked with collecting some more preliminary data about the asteroid, which was then sent back to the Hyabusa2 mothership, as reported by SPACE.com.
The last phase of the project involves landing the mothership onto the asteroid itself to collect physical samples. These samples would then be returned to Earth some time around Dec. 2020. However, JAXA recently announced that this phase of the mission, originally scheduled for late October, will be delayed until early January of next year, as reported by Gadgets 360.
The problem is fairly simple: there's no surface on the asteroid flat enough to stage a good landing. After analyzing the data collected by the hoppers, the project team concluded that Ryugu’s surface is far more uneven than originally anticipated, making it very difficult to land the mothership without potentially damaging the craft in a hard landing. And, when you’re dealing with a piece of highly specialized spacefaring hardware that cost $260 million to build, the last thing you’d want to do is knock a few screws loose. So, for now, the mothership is maintaining its orbit while the team back on Earth uses the gathered data to find a suitable landing location.
While the current conditions may worry some, the team is confident that the mission will succeed, basing their optimism on the success of the first Hyabusa mission, which achieved its goals despite numerous setbacks and was lauded as a scientific triumph.
Though no one can say for sure whether Hyabusa2 will return to Earth with the promised samples, late is better than never, and scientists are hopeful that with this new data, we can make greater strides towards answering some of the most interesting questions about our place in the universe.

A new study from the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri suggests that even light drinking four or more times per week can increase the risk of premature death by about 20 percent. The study, titled “Daily drinking is associated with increased mortality” and published in Alcoholism: Clinical & Experimental Research on Oct. 3, evaluated data from more than 400,000 participants with ages ranging from 18 to 35, aiming to analyze the risks specifically for light drinkers, unlike previous studies that have looked at alcohol consumption in a broader scope.
First author and assistant professor of psychiatry Sarah M. Hartz (M.D., Ph.D.) thinks people should be wary of past research suggesting that mild to moderate drinking can have health benefits. “It used to seem like having one or two drinks per day was no big deal, and there even have been some studies suggesting it can improve health,” she told ScienceDaily. “But now we know that even the lightest daily drinkers have an increased mortality risk.”
Indeed, prior work has shown some cardiovascular benefits of, for example, a daily glass of wine, but the new study finds that the increased cancer risk from alcohol consumption drives up the mortality risk enough to negate any positive effects. 
“Consuming one or two drinks about four days per week seemed to protect against cardiovascular disease, but drinking every day eliminated those benefits,” said Hartz. “With regard to cancer risk, any drinking at all was detrimental.”
The federally-funded study through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had two groups of focus: 340,668 National Health Interview Survey participants (ages 18 to 85), and 93,653 individuals (ages 40 to 60) who visited Veterans Administration clinics as outpatients. According to Hartz, although a 20 percent increase in mortality risk among individuals in their 20s and 30s may not be very significant since the overall chance of death remains low, the same increase for people over age 75 can be astounding, especially for individuals with a family history of cancer.
It is possible that over time, the personalization of medicine will allow doctors to recommend an amount of alcohol consumption that is safe for an individual based on their susceptibility to certain conditions. For example, someone at high risk for heart disease might find that occasional light drinking (three or less times per week) is helpful to reduce the chance of cardiovascular issues, while someone prone to cancer might want to abstain.
The Washington University study comes not long after a review article of more than 700- studies in 195 countries published in The Lancet found that “the safest level of drinking is none.” Hartz agrees, “Overall, I do think people should no longer consider a glass of wine a day to somehow be healthy.”

He said, she said; she remembers, he claims he doesn’t.
But the conversation no one is having openly is about sex and sexuality. We’ve heard about sex, sure, accompanied by the frequent: “Don’t have it.” They preach abstinence. But Maria Falzone, who I recently had the opportunity to talk with, says otherwise.
“Education needs to start in the home,” she explains, “at infancy.”
Maria Falzone, comedian and real talk pioneer, has traveled across America, reaching thousands of college students with her performance, “Sex Rules.” She invites open--and hilarious--discourse regarding our bodies, sexual health, and consent.
“It’s only sex,” she asserts. “And it’s only weird and awkward because parents make it weird and awkward.”
But knowledge about sex is power, and guardians are not only nurturers but educators. She recalls changing her daughter’s diaper, narrating, “Mommy’s touching your vulva.”
Falzone encourages exploration and discourse that ultimately leave “the lights on, sheets off, and communication about why, when, and how you want it.” Such conversations are nonexclusive to those offering support to Ford or to those backing Kavanaugh. Sex is bipartisan; sex is universal. But conversations about sex--and consent--aren’t going to be generated in the White House.
A couple months ago, Falzone was diagnosed with cancer and shared that she had, at best, four to six months left to live. What’s left for us to do now is to “take on, full force, the stigmas of sex and sexuality.”
Stigmas--those of being LGBTQ, of being female, of being people of color, of being “captain of the football team, of having big breasts, of having small breasts”--plague our conceptions. The general assumption is that sex occurs between two individuals who love each other, but even that, Falzone comments, isn’t necessarily true. And then there are “conservative Christians who make assumptions about those sexually active outside of wedlock, and liberals who judge decisions to abstain.”
As Kavanaugh takes his seat in the Supreme Court and Falzone shares her last utterances of “Sex Rules,” we must listen. Hear not that rapists can be Supreme Court justices, but rather, that kids need to be familiarized with their bodies and with this concept of sex. Healthy, consensual, communicative sex.
“Raise bad girls and bad boys,” Falzone proclaims. Because bad girls and bad boys know how and when to say “NO,” and in their lack of complacence, people need to start listening. I hope Kavanaugh is and if not, well, catch you at midterms.

Pittsburgh Public Theater’s rendition of Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, (adapted by Kate Hamill) is incredibly entertaining. Directed by Desdemona Chiang, this show captivates its audience with a humor-filled, in-the-round, love story.
Possibly the most thought-provoking directorial choice is that of the casting. As this story is typically seen through a traditional lens, it is refreshing to witness a new take on gender. The plot explores the ideals and norms that both women and men had in nineteenth century England. However, in this version of the play, many of the actors are responsible for multiple characters, regardless of what gender they identify with personally. This concept that gender does not serve as a primary factor in the casting highlights a more modern observation and critique of society.
When asked about his experience playing multiple characters, Andrew Smith, Assistant Professor of Acting for Carnegie Mellon’s School of Drama, noted that the development of the individual characters has to do with how that character helps progress the plot of other characters, instead of focusing on gender. Additionally, there had to be an “establishment of a new neutral” with each characters’ body positioning and how they carry themselves rather than the idea of “how to play a female/male.” While watching the show, it is fascinating to notice how, despite some men played women and vice versa, the characterization choices were so deliberate that it never felt as though the actors were forcing gender as the primary characterization. Andrew also commented that his objective in exploring the role of Mary was to focus more on the relationship her character had with others, as opposed to simply “playing a woman.” His portrayal of Mary was incredibly raw, emotive, and genuine.
Not only were the characters extremely fleshed out and well developed, but the production also felt collaborative. Andrew noted that there were some sections of the play that were planned out in terms of comedic timing, however the majority were created on the spot. As an audience member, this was enjoyable. The language and story is very much comedic, it was entertaining to watch how each moment of comedy did not feel forced or planned. This is what made the production brilliant. There was a sense of structure shaped by directorial choices, however, many of the decisions were left up to the actors in regard to the reactions and silent actions performed. There were many beautiful moments of the production with this idea in mind. One enjoyable aspect was the relationship between Mary and each of her sisters. There is a beautiful sense of fluidity that Andrew possesses to seamlessly transition from one character to another.
Equally as exceptional are the scene changes made throughout the play. The play is set “in the round,” where the audience sits around the stage, so the director has to be methodical in how each scene is set up. The scenes in a production like this have to play to each section of the room. The majority of the items used for the show are on the stage at all times. This makes for a more fluid and easy transition between scenes. Not only do these set pieces have to be carefully placed, but so do the actors.
When speaking about working “in the round,” Andrew mentioned that scenes needed to be reworked constantly in order to make sure that the movements being done were justifiable yet also played to every person in the audience. He noted that despite having the unique experience of working and performing in the audience, each actor had to figure out “how to share focus across a large space,” as this stage is not a typical proscenium style. The actors are free to move about the audience, as some of the set pieces are staged in sections of the seating. This directorial choice was done with the intention of fully enveloping the audience into the story. The production overall is incredibly well executed and fun to watch. It is engaging and true to the story, yet memorable with modern twists. It is highly recommended to watch, as it takes its audience on a fun-filled adventure through the world of Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice.

This article contains mild spoilers for The Way Out West.
The School of Drama kicked off their 2018/19 production season with the play The Way Out West. This was a newly commissioned piece for the Philip Chosky Theater written by Carnegie Mellon alumni Liza Birkenmeier, and also marked the university's directorial debut for the newly appointed John Wells Professor of Directing, Kim Weild. Set during World War II, the play follows the lives of characters at a government test site, as they grapple with the secret development of the atomic bomb. 
From the opening minutes, it was clear that this wasn't going to be a very traditional play. Throughout the show, the set was mostly bare with very few set changes. There’s no straight plot either, rather the point is to watch the play's characters grow and develop over the course of 90 minutes. This can make for a challenging watch, but it’s incredibly rewarding and will stay with you long after. It's one of those stories that requires a lot of time to think about it before understanding its true meaning. The play was also presented without an intermission, which seems like a deliberate choice in hindsight and one that works very well. The intermission would ruin the pace at which the character development unfolds. 
Despite the simple production design, it was incredibly effective and everything there was very convincing. There was a clear sense of space and time despite the barebones set presented. This may seem like a backhanded compliment, but it only makes sense when you see the play for yourself and see nearly nothing on stage. The sound design was also incredibly effective, with great use of music and sound effects. There was one particular sequence in the program where it flashes forward to 1990, and the music used to transition to the new time period was incredibly effective. 
The actors also deserve praise for pulling off this difficult material. The play rests squarely on their ability to pull of their written characters really well and with nuance, and every cast member pulls off their roles. Special shoutouts go to senior Drama students Leaf Rickard as Irene and Brenna Power as Leona. Their onstage chemistry was an absolute treat to watch, and their dynamics and development were highlights of the play. 
However, the play’s main star was the script. The main conflict of the story revolved around the secrecy of the atomic bomb’s development and its implication, but for the first 40 to 45 minutes, the story seemed to be going nowhere. All the elements and relationships were established and fleshed out early on and while they were all compelling, it left you wondering for so long what the point was to everything. But after a few significant turning points, the first 40 minutes suddenly fell into place. The play was never about the bomb itself, rather about how something as morally ambiguous as the atomic bomb can strain relationships, since people had disagreements over its meaning and how to use it. Both sides of this debate had valid arguments: there is merit to those who support a quick and swift end to a war, and there is also merit in the argument that the usage of the atomic bomb is cruel and lacks the foresight of its long term consequences. It is juxtaposed against modern political discourse over drone warfare and even against Hindu mythology. It’s a very timely parallel to modern politics where families, friendships, and relationships have become more tumultuous in an era of divisive rhetoric. 
Having thought about it for several days, the play has really come to grow on me and on many others who have watched it. The Way Out West is a thought-provoking triumph, and major props should be given to everyone for pulling off a play like this with such precision and skill. The School of Drama is off to a great start so far with its 2018/19 season, and if the later selections in their schedule are any indication, they seem to have a great season lined up for everyone to enjoy.

On Friday, Oct. 12, CMU OM and Mayur SASA put together a wonderful evening to celebrate Diwali, the Indian festival of lights. The event ran from 6-12 p.m. at Rangos Ballroom and showcased musical and dance performances alongside traditional activities such as painting diyas (candles), and applying mehndi. Falling on family weekend, the event also saw many parents attend to watch their children perform, giving the celebration less of a party vibe until the Bollywood music started later in the night. 
Diwali has several backstories depending on the region the festival is celebrated in. North India celebrates the festival as the return of King Rama to Ayodhya, while South India celebrates the festival as the day of the defeat of the demon Narakasura by Lord Krishna. Diwali is specifically known as the festival of lights, as on this day, families light diyas (candles) around their houses to symbolize the light vanquishing the dark, or good defeating evil. Where I come from, families also celebrate the festival by setting off fireworks throughout the night and creating patterns called rangoli in front of their homes.
The evening kicked off with people on the dance floor as bhangra music blasted over the speakers. Almost everyone was wearing their finest Indian attire for the night. Several people, myself included, picked up the dandiya sticks to form small circles and dance. Tables lined the perimeter of Rangos, with a mehndi station, a photography station that had a constant stream of people, a candle painting station that almost ruined my white outfit, and ‘Lassi Pong’, a twist on the traditional beer pong without the latter’s ‘side-effects’. After I’d finished painting a little diya, taking several pictures, and trying (but failing) at dandiya dancing, the bhangra music came to an end and the performances for the evening began. 
The performances began with two a cappella groups, CMU Saans and Deewane a cappella. Both groups were absolutely amazing, although their mics could have been placed a bit better. Following them were performances from three dance groups: CMU Bhangra, Raasta, and Sahara. All three received enthusiastic applause from its audience, and their energy was captivating to say the least. During the performances, people also enjoyed the Indian buffet that had been laid out, which was covered as part of the admission ticket cost. 
After the night’s performances came to an end, the parents in the room drifted off to their hotel rooms as the Bollywood music began to play over the speakers. Maybe it was because it was a Friday night and it was a long week after midterms, but the room filled with unleashed energy that literally had the floors vibrating. As a Tamilian, I was a bit miffed that the night’s playlist mainly consisted of Hindi songs but those small complaints faded to mist as the night progressed. Everyone was excited, everyone let loose and the enthusiasm was hard not to be a part of. The evening ended on a high note that had people tired and drained, with huge smiles lighting up their faces.

Vertigo, the highly anticipated fall a cappella concert, returned to Rangos Ballroom this past Saturday, Oct. 13. Hosted by Carnegie Mellon’s renowned a capella group, The Originals, the event showcased the talents of five collegiate a cappella groups: The Nor’easters from Northeastern University, the Boston University Treblemakers, the GW Vibes from George Washington University, Gestalt from the University of Florida, and of course, the Originals from Carnegie Mellon University.
After the success of Vertigo last year, it was no surprise that the show sold out by early afternoon. Starting at 7, I was fortunate enough to know to come early to get a good seat, as there was already a line forming outside the ballroom half an hour before the show started.
Once everyone was settled in, the Originals kicked off the show with “Judas” by Lady Gaga. The lead singer commanded the stage and the rest of the all-male group followed his lead. The soloist’s voice was perfect for the song, managing to hit all the notes and incorporating strong personality into everything he did. However, the energy fizzled out a bit when it got to the duet between the vocal percussionists. Not that the beat-boxing was bad by any means, but there was not much variety in their performance. 
Next up was University of Florida’s co-ed Gestalt, hoping to "break the mold of contemporary a cappella." They started strong with a haunting and ethereal harmony that led into Calvin Harris’ “Pray to God” featuring Haim. The lead vocalist had a powerful and unique voice, but when trying to share the spotlight with the other female singers, it became overwhelming, and not in a good way. While they all were extremely talented, they did not always have good control of their volume and they ended up singing over each other several times. They proceeded with “Mother” by Florence + the Machine. The male lead had a very deep, soothing voice, but for the most part, they allowed the female singers to take center stage again. Although there were a few times where I felt the vocals overlapped again, it was still a strong performance and they continued to excel with well-structured choreography. Gestalt continued with three more songs: “Selah” by Emeli Sandé, which showed their incredible vocal range and more successfully balanced the light and heavy moments; “Trainwreck” by Banks, which they do not normally perform live but displayed their widest vocal ranges; and “Feel” by Bombay Bicycle Club, which had a nice echo effect and continued their theme of rather haunting-sounding vocals. The last of these was probably their best vocal performance of the night, but definitely had the most obscure choreography. Overall though, Gestalt proved they had talent despite being a group only formed two years ago.
Following Gestalt was GW Vibes from George Washington University. Starting with Michael Jackson’s iconic “Rock with You,” I could instantly tell the group was having a good time as the lead vocalist bopped around on the stage. While her singing wasn’t the greatest, she definitely was upbeat and kept the mood light and fun before the following performance that took on more serious tones. The group tackled themes of mental health and depression in a melancholy but beautiful mashup of Jon Bellion’s “Guillotine” and Logic’s “1-800-273-8255.” After this, they closed with a solid performance of Brayton Bowman’s “FEEL YOU.”
After a brief intermission, Northeastern University’s Nor’easters brought the audience back into the show with an accurate arrangement of Dua Lipa’s hit song, “New Rules.” Then they debuted their arrangement of Troye Sivan’s “Plum,” which I controversially enjoyed a bit more than the original despite being a fan of Sivan’s music. It seemed more natural an approach for the lyrics compared to Sivan’s more upbeat version. Next was Rosie Lowe’s “Who’s That Girl?” that included superb synchronized choreography, and interesting clapping and breathing patterns that added a unique effect to the whole vibe of the song. The females took over for this song, but there was a good vocal balance so that they complemented each other instead of overpowering one another. Last was a poignant and mesmerizing rendition of MUNA’s “I Got a Place.”
The penultimate group that took the stage was Boston University’s Treblemakers. Starting strong, they began with “How Long” by Charlie Puth. Arranged as a duet rather than a solo, it really amplified the emotions of the piece, although the two vocalists were better when their parts were separate rather than harmonizing. Their next two songs, Sam Smith’s “Him” and Jorja Smith’s “So Lonely,” were equally emotional and pure, with strong vocals from their respective leads. Closing with “Keeping Your Head Up” by Birdy, they ended formidably with a vocalist that could hit all the notes, even when they went extremely high or when she had to compete with her loud groupmates’ backing vocals.
To finish the night, the Originals took the stage once more. Unfortunately, they had a problem with one of the mics in the first set, but, per the audience’s approval, they were granted another chance to perform “Judas.” This second run did not disappoint. The lead once again commanded the stage, but was even more energetic and added even more dramatic flair than before with his dance moves. They definitely took the extra opportunity and ran with it. Not only was the singing and backing vocals stronger, but the group overall was more energetic and was visually enjoying themselves more. To top it off, there was an extreme difference in the additional mic during the duet, the effects much more diverse and dynamic.
After their redo of “Judas,” they performed Daniel Caesar’s “Won’t Live Here,” which continued all the groups’ trends of having at least one song with gorgeously haunting vocals. In addition to the emotional and raw singing though, the Originals stepped up their game when it came to choreography as well. I honestly felt like I was being hypnotized, even when they were doing something as simple as swaying on stage.
Last, but certainly not least, the Originals took on a challenge with Panic! At the Disco’s “Death of a Bachelor.” With the strongest choreography and posing of the night from the very start of the song, I was excited to see what they had in store for the finale. While I thought the lead was a bit pitchy during the chorus, overall he took on Brendon Urie’s vocals with grace and poise.
In the end, Vertigo was a massive success once more, bringing together a cappella groups from across the country to thrill audiences.

Jeremy Zucker was not your average college student. While pursuing a pre-med track and studying molecular and cellular biology at Colorado College, he also began his music career.
It doesn't take long to get sucked into Zucker's smooth voice and groovy beats. Tossing playful lyrics and merging indie electronica with notes of hip-hop, he creates tunes that many people can enjoy and relate to. Listening to his music is not only a pleasant auditory experience, but it gives the comfort of being with a longtime best friend whom you share all your life experiences with.
Coincidentally, singer-songwriter Mat Musso, known professionally as Blackbear, was what brought both Zucker and me towards Zucker's music. In his high school years, Zucker heard Blackbear's track, " 'Hotel Andrea', [which] he says grabbed his heart and revealed an array of feelings to him that he didn’t previously know were there." he said in an interview. Like Blackbear, Zucker's music is mellow and influenced by hip-hop. Zucker's music also echoes the music of other artists he looked up to such as Bon Iver and Twenty One Pilots.
In an interview with Billboard earlier this month, he reported his favorite album is currently Macadelic by Mac Miller. "[Miller] was looked at as the super happy... frat rapper, and I think I relate to people looking at you that way because my early music was really happy," he reflects, claiming Macadelic "changed the way [he] listened to music".
This change in music tastes is shown in perhaps his most striking song, "all the kids are depressed". In the introduction of the video, Zucker explains that before he began the actual video production, Zucker put out a casting call for the music video, "asking friends and strangers to share their experiences with depression." In three weeks, he received hundreds of emails from people all around the world. He closes off the introduction by hoping that his video gives others a voice. In the music video, he shared six testimonies, one of which was his own. Each gave a unique perspective on how depression impacts different people. For some, their experience stems from events pertaining to their parents. Others share them coping with depression on a daily basis. Zucker ends the music video with his own. "[This song was] something I wrote the other day and it reminded me why I make music," he puts at the end of the music video before he closes it with a list of mental health resources.
Mental health has definitely been made more aware in the public eye over the past years. Although the world has moved past trephination, there is still significantly more work to be done in regards to removing the stigma surrounding mental health and making mental health resources more accessible. On lyrics website Genius, Zucker explains that "a lot of people refuse to legitimize depression in real life and on social media. The reality is that everyone has some sort of relationship with depression and that no two people experience it in the same way. I really think that kids these days are the first generation to address mental illness in a constructive manner. Listen to the kids, bro."
In the span of three years, Zucker managed to rack up over 180,000 subscribers on YouTube and over five million monthly listeners on Spotify. Now that he has graduated from college, he expects to be able to invest more in his music career. While juggling school, he managed to write and produce music; he even managed to collaborate with Blackbear in his song "talk is overrated." If his success up until now landed him on Billboard's "You Should Know," I cannot wait to see what lies ahead for this indie artist in the future.

Dear Taylor Swift,
It feels like just yesterday when “Teardrops On My Guitar” was blasting from my desktop computer while I did math homework, when I listened to “White Horse” while thinking about my fourth grade crush, when I listened to “22” while daydreaming of being older and cooler, and when I listened to “You Belong With Me” while sleeping through a long road trip. For a chunk of my childhood, your music was the background noise in my life — even if I didn’t exactly show off my secret love of early 2000s country.
It also feels like just yesterday when I was fourteen, phone in hand, scrolling through articles and writing pieces about culture, social justice, and civic action. The obvious issues with our country were suddenly very apparent to me, and I chose to act in a way only a fourteen-year-old could: tweet, retweet, share, like, and tell friends. I was a freshman in high school and a passionate feminist, taking glares and snarky comments from boys and girls alike. I persisted nonetheless, because standing up for what I believed in mattered a tiny bit more than my reputation.
At the same time of this dynamic moment in my life, 1989 came out. Was I mad that the country sound was completely gone? A little. However, you soon announced your feminism and spoke of 1989 as a women’s anthem: “Blank Space” embraced a woman’s revenge on an ex-lover and her “serial-dating,” while “Bad Blood” exemplified the girl group “squad goals” ideal. I remember thinking, "Hell yeah," because my childhood idol was growing and learning with me — and it felt amazing! 
Flash forward a few months, and you are on my Twitter timeline for other reasons. First, most evidently, hordes of people hated you for having “so many” failed relationships — which was really wrong and honestly gross. Second, a smaller population of people began to call you out for “white feminism.” I was confused. Were they being stereotypical by labeling you, a white woman, as a white feminist? But then I realized what it meant: it meant you were a feminist that fought for cisgender, mostly white, straight, and able-bodied women.
Evidently, that confused me and I disagreed with the sentiment immediately. Yet with the release of the “Shake It Off” and “Wildest Dreams” music videos, I began to feel wary. “Shake It Off,” while a somewhat catchy song, was sour with racial appropriation and the objectification of black women. And who even knows what the “Wildest Dreams” music video was, and why it was that way! Nowhere in the song’s lyrics do I hear “Africa as a backdrop,” “1950s Hollywood,” “colonial-era aesthetics for no apparent reason,” or “specifically choosing to not share any African storyline, let alone cast any African person.” I realize the profits of the video were donated to an African Wildlife Conservation organization, but still. Why did the video have to be about…that? 
Finally, to top off the cake that was 2014-to-2015 you, you dismissed Nicki Minaj’s valid sentiments about the disadvantages of being a black woman in the industry when she lost the Video Music Award for Best Music Video of the Year as “pitting women against each other.” Why couldn’t you just let her say what she had to? You did win the award in the end.
So, I chose to ignore you completely. I figured there was no point in actively calling you out, but there was absolutely no benefit in promoting you either. I focused my energy into other things, and eventually 2016 rolled around. Anger, frustration, and disappointment plagued me — and over half of the nation — when our current president was elected. But I was not surprised when I heard your silence. I heard your silence on the issues that were affecting black Americans, Latin Americans, immigrants, refugees, the LGBTQ community, and anyone who wasn’t white. When I realized the art of your selective activism, I felt betrayed by someone I once looked up to. And, I knew that even if you were to speak up, I would still see you as someone who ultimately chose her own reputation over standing up for what’s right, or let alone standing up for anything.  
It feels like just yesterday when my Twitter, Instagram feed, Facebook, and Snapchat feeds were overloaded with the headline, “Taylor Swift Finally Ends Her Political Silence.” 
Wait. That was just yesterday. And honestly, I wish it wasn’t.
Lots of Love,
A Former Fan

This past Saturday, I decided to take some time for myself and go out to brunch. While some people may think that eating alone can be a bit sad, I think it can be quite comforting. If you like people-watching, you can surely do a lot of that and also give yourself time to just think (and eat!). For this brunch outing, I decided to go to The Porch. 
The location: The Porch is pretty close to campus, which makes it a very convenient spot to eat. What I appreciate most about its location, Schenley Plaza, is that it feels and looks as if you're in a completely different area of Pittsburgh, even though it's only a 15-minute walk from campus. The grass, trees, and outdoor seating of the whole area always give me good vibes, and I love seeing families and students leisurely walking around and enjoying themselves. 
The food: In the past I went to The Porch only at night, specifically for their amazing weekday half-off pizza deals! I've always loved their pizzas and unique toppings, but I've also wanted to try mixing it up and order different things on their menus. Going for brunch at The Porch definitely gave me the opportunity to do that. I didn't order anything extravagant, but something rather simple and balanced in flavors: crispy taters and warm biscuits. I was really craving the salty and sweet combination, and the meal surely did not disappoint. The three biscuits they served were crunchy on the outside and very fluffy and buttery on the inside. The biscuits came with apple butter, jam, and regular butter, so I could have some flavor variety in each bite. The crispy taters were crunchy and salty, and they were served with a delicious (and mildly spicy) curried ketchup on the side. Overall, I found my meal to be pretty satisfying and tasty! 
The vibe: Because it was family weekend, there were lots of families eating at The Porch. It gave off such wonderful vibes and feelings to be around people who were happy to be there together. In general, The Porch is a popular eating location for families and elders, so I think the familial and relaxed atmosphere is something you can always expect to have. 
Lit or Nah: I wouldn't describe The Porch as lit. I've always seen it as a very family-friendly place to eat at, where it's possible for you to feel even just a little bit at home. And that's obviously not a bad thing! Everything at The Porch is simply feel-good, and it's important to visit places like that every once in a while.

Dear Izzy,
I'm super stressed because I'm super sick!! Fall in Pittsburgh is great and all (I could do without all the rain, though), but the fact that Pittsburgh can't decide whether to be sunny or torrentially down-pouring has been frustrating for me and my health. Now, I'm left as a sniffling mess with midterms on the horizon, and I can't seem to conquer it — or worse, I'll get better and then immediately get sick again. Please help!
Sincerely shivering,
Feeling Low, Ugh
Dear FLU,
Ah yes, autumn. The leaves are changing, Starbucks is rolling out their Pumpkin Spice Lattes, and Mother Nature warns us of winter by sending down gusts of wind and buckets of rain in Pittsburgh. As someone who was sick for the entirety of her first semester at Carnegie Mellon, let me impart you some wisdom from the wise.
Take care of your body, obviously. Eat healthy, and stay away from fried food and things with lots of sugar. Tea should be one of your closest pals. Try to drink decaffeinated tea, because although caffeine will keep you up during class it can mess with your system a bit more than usual. Tea is also incredibly calming in general — for your systems, for your mind — so you can never go wrong with drinking tea! 
Listen to your body. If your body is telling you that it's tired, or if you're up late at night and falling asleep while doing work, honestly just go to sleep. You'll be thankful in the morning, and no assignment is worth pulling an all-nighter for while you're sick and suffering. You'll have a clearer mind to finish it, and if you email your teacher about your situation they will usually understand.
Most importantly, relax. If you're sick, put yourself first. Relax your mind — watch something on Netflix, read a book, take a nap, and feel free to take a break from work if you need to. Your focus should be to get better, so that you can walk into class well-rested and with a clear mind. Your teachers want you to prioritize getting better too, so if you can't do work, listen to your needs and take the time to fulfill them.
Happy flu season,
Izzy

In anticipation of his upcoming inauguration, The Tartan sat down with President Farnam Jahanian to hear his thoughts on the key challenges facing Carnegie Mellon University students. Below is a transcript of the conversation, lightly edited for clarity and length.
The Tartan: Could you talk about what your vision for the university is and what you want it to become over the next few years?
President Jahanian: Absolutely. This is truly an extraordinary time in the life of Carnegie Mellon. We're at the center of a societal and economic transformation that is catalyzed by digitization of information, unprecedented access to data, automation, and artificial intelligence. And the acceleration in the scale, scope, and ubiquity of these advances in technology are unprecedented. These advances of course are transforming every sector of our economy, from healthcare to transportation to finance to energy, not to mention education. And as these transformations are taking place, I look at Carnegie Mellon and the future of Carnegie Mellon, and if we don't do anything differently, we're going to continue to be a great institution. But if we are very intentional, and unapologetically bold as I say, about the role of Carnegie Mellon in shaping the next century, there are tremendous opportunities for Carnegie Mellon in leading education and research in the world, and that is my vision for Carnegie Mellon.
Now what's remarkable about Carnegie Mellon, is that we work at what I refer to as this nexus of technology and society. And the work that we do, all the way from wonderful research and education from engineering [and] computer science, to social science and humanities and the arts and the business school and so on, somehow connects this nexus of technology and society. What I think is most compelling about Carnegie Mellon University is the way we intertwine engineering, and technology and sciences, with business, policy, the arts and humanities. There are very few institutions in the world who are able to actually intertwine and connect these disciplines so seamlessly.
So where do I see the university going? I hope that in the coming years, we will be seen as the place known for advancing human knowledge, improving [the] human condition, and solving complex problems for society that require interdisciplinary skills. We're also known for inventing the future where we have broad impacts on society. And probably the most important part of our mission is preparing a new generation of leaders who imagine broadly, think critically, and work collaboratively. Stepping back, I see really two missions [for] the university: we have a research mission and an education mission, and these two missions are so deeply integrated and tied together.
The Tartan: Another topic I want to talk about is preparing students for the workforce.
President Jahanian: Oh, I love that topic!
The Tartan: In particular, I think that there's no doubt that Carnegie Mellon students will graduate with incredible technical skills and other kinds of skills and will be able to succeed in that sense, but one thing I'm more concerned about is whether Carnegie Mellon students are prepared to handle the ethical challenges of the workplace. I'll bring up a couple examples. A lot of tech companies that Carnegie Mellon students tend to go on to work at have a lot of controversies that they are coming under fire for. So there's issues of censorship, of whether these companies are monopolies, there's the extreme example of whether Facebook was contributing to ethnic cleansing in Myanmar, and there's all sorts of reasons to question whether these companies are forces for good. My question for you is: do you think Carnegie Mellon University prepares students for the ethical challenges that they're going to face in the workplace? And do you feel that it has an obligation to do so?
President Jahanian: I think ethics and integrity, to be candid, are central, indispensable, and defining attributes of higher education institutions. There's no question that we give a great education to our students, regardless of their disciplinary interest. So I think it's an enormous responsibility for the university to make sure that not only we give students disciplinary expertise, but we develop the whole person. And developing the whole person means giving them the skills that go beyond disciplinary expertise, including communication skills, collaboration skills, skills that allow them to be great citizens. So ethics is an important component of that.
You mentioned ethics but the examples you gave also involve privacy, so let me tie that back to technology. I think that this is one of the issues that we face. As we see society develop, as we see these advances in technology that are becoming so pervasive and impacting every aspect of our lives, what we're also seeing is that the potential impact of technology could be negative. So there are ethical, privacy, and policy ramifications of technology that have to be considered. So preparing our students not only to be inventors, but also be able to address the policy and ethical and other implications of what we invent is extremely important, and that has to be part of the education.
We have a number of courses on campus that address this, and there's an undergraduate major in Ethics, History, and Public Policy which is an interdepartmental program offered through history and philosophy.
The Tartan: I know that the courses exist, the research is happening, the major exists, but I feel like the issue there is that if you're someone who is going to choose to take these courses, you might already not be the person who needs it the most, and I'm wondering how a typical Carnegie Mellon student who isn't especially concerned or aware of these issues is going to be prepared for these ethical challenges.
President Jahanian: We also ask all of our students to commit to a set of standards to be a member of our community, and that happens in your freshman year in orientation. When you start here, we say that we have a set of community standards that we expect our students to live by. But you're actually highlighting something that's really important. The question is, in addition to the courses that are available that the students can take, can we integrate components of ethics and related topics into other courses that students take for their major? And the answer is absolutely yes and we should be doing more of that, there's no question in my mind. I would actually say that when I talk about collaboration skills or communication skills, these are the skills that we need to integrate deeply into our curriculum, not just as separate courses that students can have access to, but we should think of these as components of courses that are integrated into some of the major courses that students take as part of their education.
The Tartan: You may be aware that at the Technical Opportunities Conference, there were protests about the defense contractors that were recruiting there, and a group called the Students for a Democratic Society were trying to do these demonstrations to discourage students from applying to these companies, and they don't like that these companies, which they view as being forces for evil in the world, are recruiting at Carnegie Mellon.
President Jahanian: First of all, Carnegie Mellon has always supported students' decisions to add their voices to any debate. We seek, we value, cultivate, and support students who want to make a positive impact on society and participate in civil discourse. So the fact that there are students on campus who feel strongly about this, I think it's important for their voice to be heard, and it's important for them to have the opportunity to express their opinion. Free speech is so core to the foundation of our democracy.
Having said that, we should respect the fact that students who graduate from here have the choice of taking positions in companies that they find exciting, and we need to respect their decision, we need to respect their desires, and as long as we nurture and support civil discourse on our campus, and support individuals' rights to express their opinions in a positive, constructive way, I think we're going to end up in a better place. That's really how I feel about this.
I think your question was also getting at the issue of defense contracting. I don't want to sidestep that, I'm happy to address that. An important core value and philosophy of higher education in this country and for Carnegie Mellon is academic freedom. Faculty and students have the choice to decide whether they want to do research and work in areas that are of interest to the Department of Defense or the defense industry. We need to respect their decision, and support their academic freedom. That's really my position on that. I hope that's clear.
The Tartan: That's clear. I understand your stance on the freedom aspect of this, but even if you have a totally open view that on its face doesn't favor one type of company over another, that just through the finances of it, that leads to certain biases. So you might say that Carnegie Mellon University has no policy that favors whether a technology for social good company is recruiting versus a defense contractor. But the fact is that which companies can afford to reserve a spot at the TOC or can afford to spare staff members to go recruit at the front of Gates and greet students and give out free food there, there are going to be certain biases there. Do you worry about that?
President Jahanian: What I worry about is to ensure that companies have access to our students, and I want to make sure that companies whether they are small, medium, or large, and regardless of what sector of the economy they operate in, that they have access to our students and provide opportunities for our students. I think that's extremely important. In ways that we can facilitate that, we will do everything that we can at Carnegie Mellon whether through our colleges or central recruiting, to make sure that happens.
Beyond that, I don't think that we want to be in a position of dictating what companies should or should not recruit on campus. I think it's really important for students to be able to add their voice to any kind of discussion or debate around this topic, and we should support that without any question, but at the same time, we need to create an environment such that various companies have the ability to come and recruit our students. And that our students have the opportunity to look at various companies and various opportunities.
And we have a terrific set of programs in our Heinz College School of Public Policy as well as in our Engineering and Public Policy program that focus on policy-related issues. That actually happens in Dietrich and in our business school as well. When it comes to that, we have a large number of students who actually want to work in the public sector, and they want to work in non-profit environments. The question is: how can we facilitate that? How can we support that? So let me give you an example.
Richard Scheines, our Dean of the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences  was experimenting with an internship program this last year which I think has been quite successful. I think it's really important to highlight this. We know that many of our students who are studying in certain areas having to do with science, engineering, technology, and business and so on may have an easier time getting paid internships by companies that are recruiting on campus. 
On the other hand, we have a lot of students on campus who may actually be studying technical areas or maybe students in the social science and humanities college, or our college of fine arts, or our engineering college or our science college who want to go work for a non-profit, or who want to work for an enterprise that doesn't necessarily have the capacity to support them. It might be a non-profit or a startup that's doing something socially valuable, and is of interest to students. 
Our Dietrich colleagues came up with the idea of supporting students during a summer, so they can go and work in non-profit and other entities that potentially nurture their interest and support them. We've started experimenting with it this past semester, and it's been enormously successful, so that's the kind of stuff that we do to create more opportunities for students.
Studies have shown that having an internship is one of the most important factors for students getting jobs after graduation. So to the extent that we can facilitate that for students who want to go work for a non-profit enterprise or be involved in community service, I think that's a healthy thing for the university and our students.
The Tartan: When I was asking people what they want me to ask you about, something that came up a lot was the question of stress culture and mental health issues. I talked to someone who said that when Carnegie Mellon is talking about what it's going to do to address these issues, a lot of the time it's focused on something like hiring more therapists or expanding access to mental health resources, but fewer efforts to address the root cause and make Carnegie Mellon a healthier and less stressful place. But obviously there's a tradeoff there because we still want to maintain academic rigor. So how do you think about that?
President Jahanian: As you know, we launched a task force on the CMU experience almost three years ago. That task force was motivated by the observation that we know that we offer our students a great education, but we also have the responsibility of developing the whole person. What that means is offering them opportunities outside the classroom as part of their education.
There is no question that Carnegie Mellon as one of the top schools in the country is an academically rigorous environment. And I admit that our expectation of excellence leads to amazing things that come out of this campus, [such as] students that educate and research. But sometimes [this] also fosters a culture of stress among our students and faculty. And you have to be very vigilant about it. You have to tackle the problem constantly and part of the reason we launched the Task Force on the CMU Experience was really to look at the stress culture on the campus and find ways that we can mitigate that issue. In fact, over the past 2-3 years, and as you can see we post on the website all the things that we do as part of the task force, not only have we doubled our resources for mental health and for student advising, but we also started investing in various services on campus to support our students.
While you may not make a direct link between the investment we make on campus, many of our students have been asking for collaboration spaces, they want space on campus where they can essentially study with their friends. So what we did with the Wean library. Every new building that we are building has collaboration spaces and study spaces as you see in the Tepper Quad. But fundamentally it's also about connecting the advising that we do academically to mental health and the support that we provide our students.
So we're investing heavily in this. Part of it is also getting our more senior students to be mentors for our freshman and sophomore students. The stress culture is reinforced by the experiences that one may have on campus. So it's really important not only to have advisors and counselors and teachers to talk to our students about us, but to also rely on our juniors and seniors to provide mentorship and support for our students, that they don't need to add unnecessary pressure on themselves.
I must tell you, we had 24,000 applications to our freshman class this year. There was a 19 percent increase in our applications this year over last year. So more and more students want to come to Carnegie Mellon. Something quite exciting is happening on this campus. And people outside are recognizing that we offer great education, we offer a great environment for students. Which means we are a very selective place. Some of the most gifted, brightest students in the world come to our campus to study. So what we need to do is to remind them that they are also, every student that comes in, why they may have come from the top 10 percent of their high school, they're surrounded by very bright students on this campus. It's a very competitive place to get to Carnegie Mellon University, but at the same time, Carnegie Mellon is a very nurturing place, the students tend to be very supportive of each other, and it's a very collegial place. So we need to constantly remind ourselves and reinforce that culture.

On Friday, Oct. 5, students exited class to find a strange sight on The Cut: a group of figures, cloaked in white hazmat suits, standing across from The Fence. As students drew closer they could see blue paint splattered over each of the figures. There were five of them, and they were not sculptures but people, students who the viewers might recognize. They were standing motionless with their eyes closed and hands at their side. Suddenly, it became clear to onlookers: this is performance art.
It was a human Likert scale. A large sign stood adjacent to the performances, held up by two large paint cans, and instructed viewers to apply paint to the person who best represents their stance on the following statement: “Carnegie Mellon creates a manageable workload for its students.” In front of each performer lay a sign, a can of blue paint, and a few brushes. In all caps, the signs read Strongly Agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, and Strongly Disagree.
A blue frown emoticon was painted across the performer for Disagree. Blue hearts were painted on the chests of the performers for both Strongly Agree and Strongly Disagree.
As classes got out at 11:50 a.m. a mass of students flooded The Cut, and many walked over to see what was going on. A crowd formed. Many students understood this as a criticism of Carnegie Mellon’s rigor, and the lack of discourse surrounding it. Others did not think it addressed Carnegie Mellon’s workload well. Some weren't sure it was art, and many walked right on by.
Quan Wyndeer, a sophomore acting major, was surprised to see that anyone had painted on the section for Strongly Agree. “I think that a lot of people struggle with workload but don't really know how to bring it up…” Matthew Kirshner, also a sophomore acting major, chimed in, “and they feel a responsibility to just shut up and deal with it.” Wyndeer continued, “if you say something about it, you might be perceived as weak.”
Jessa Westheimer, the artist, calls the artwork “Human Likert: A Manageable Workload.” She explained that in the preceding week she was working constantly and hadn’t slept more than two hours a night, “and I wasn't even the busiest person I know.” Through this performance, she sought to “just make it very obvious what everyone was thinking,” and show students that they are not alone in struggling with the workload here.
A group of three students stood near the Agree performer, discussing the work’s flaws as a data visualization. “There’s no set amount of paint that people can use, [so] you can't really tell how many people painted on each person,” Yael Canoan, a first-year architecture student, commented. Perry Nasech, a first year in the school of art, also mentioned that people probably weren't concerned with how much paint they were applying.
“Human Likert: A Manageable Workload” successfully captured the attention of many students, despite some of their criticisms. Emily Schneider, a sophomore biochem major, said “I came out of Doherty and immediately saw this and was like ‘What's going on, I need to investigate.’” She thought the work was interesting and found the message clear. Yugyeong Lee, a senior architecture student, said that “it made me want to participate because it's different from other surveys they do at school.”
After around 45 minutes, the performers took a short break, opening their eyes and chatting with one another. For the first session, they had been instructed to “Stand here, eyes closed, no talking, no moving.” For the second session they could be more relaxed, and stood with their eyes open, occasionally talking to the viewers. One of the performers, Kendra Adegbesan, a sophomore neurobiology major, said that she liked overhearing discussions: “I feel like when our eyes were closed they didn't think we were people, so they would talk very openly, saying ‘YEAH I REALLY DISAGREE I HATE THIS SCHOOL!’” She continued, “I've had a lot of people paint aggressively on me today.”
Ashley Burbano, the performer for Agree, criticized how students often complain about the workload without addressing it. “I feel like on college campuses you have to be sort of self-advocating to get what you want, or else nothing will change.”
Not all, however, felt that the performance had to be used solely to  solumnly contemplate the workload at Carnegie Mellon. Jin Lee, a senior statistics major, was excited by the opportunity to paint all over his friend, even though she represented the opinion he disagreed with. Jin exuberantly picked up a brush and painted a blue arrow over the forehead of the actor for Strongly Agree, referencing Aang from Avatar the Last Airbender. As Lee said, “I figured that since everyone else has been drawn on more, it's fine, figuratively speaking.”

On Thursday night, a panel of Carnegie Mellon professors and alumni gathered before an audience of 30 people in Baker Hall’s Adamson wing to speak about the number one most widely-read book in English-speaking educational institutions: Mary Shelly’s Frankenstein. The event, titled Frankenstein@200, is a celebration of the book’s bicentennial anniversary, and this year’s installment of the Carol Brown Lecture Series.
The Carol Brown Series is a series of annual lectures endowed by its namesake, the former CEO of Pittsburgh Cultural Trust and a Life Emeritus member of Carnegie Mellon's Board of Trustees. “The focus of these lectures,” said associate professor of English Richard Purcell, who organized the panel, “is on getting undergraduate students excited about studying English.”
Undergraduate English is a small world at Carnegie Mellon, comprising just five percent of all the students in Dietrich college. At a school well-known for its technical opportunities, it can be hard to attract students to literary programs. Of the 30 audience members, only 12 were undergrads. The panel was selected to touch a broad range of topics, extending beyond the traditional realm of English.
“The novel ties into so many fields and interests beyond literature,” Dr. Purcell said. “I thought it would be a good idea to bring people from diverse disciplines and fields here.”
Of the four panelists, two were English professors. Dr. Marian Aguiar, whose research is focused on culture and globalization, presented a recent modern adaption of the story, in which she spoke about themes of waste, recycling, and material byproducts of globalization, and how the body of Frankenstein’s monster is a metaphor for these themes. Dr. Jon Klancher, also from the English department, spoke about the original Frankenstein texts – there were four editions of the book during Shelley’s lifetime, each slightly different from the next. He then focused on the engravings and images that accompanied each edition, drawing connections to the political climate of 19th-century Europe.
The other two panelists gave very different reads. Carnegie Mellon alumna Tami Dixon, co-founder and principal creative at Bricolage Production company, spoke about her experience adapting the story for a November radio performance: Midnight Radio’s Frankenstein. She spoke about upended expectations, having never read the original book until starting the project, and how flawed the characters are: “Actors dream of sinking their teeth into a role like this,” she said, speaking about Dr. Frankenstein himself. Also presenting was robotics professor Dr. Illah Nourbakhsh, whose work most closely mimics that of the novel’s wayward protagonist. In his talk he brought up ethical issues within robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), and uncertainty.
The subject of uncertainty (and its opposite – predictability) was brought up again during questions. Mediator Wendy Arons, a professor at the School of Drama, pointed out that there is always an element of uncertainty in the effect a creative work can have on the world.
Uncertainty is a hot topic at Carnegie Mellon – there are numerous courses across campus devoted to understanding it. For many technologists, Dr. Nourbakhsh pointed out, uncertainty is a bad thing: “What if one day, your toaster decides it doesn’t want to toast your bread this morning?” For artists such as Ms. Dixon, however, it’s what gives her work: “The search for predictability is terrifying to me,” she said.
The dialogue, and the different points of view, all contributed to a broader understanding of the old book. These panelists, had they all gone to undergrad at Carnegie Mellon, may never have crossed paths. By bringing them together, the event was supposed to have appealed to a larger group of students. With a sparse undergraduate showing, however, the panel fell short of this goal.

Amidst the anger, outcry, and protest leading up to Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the United States Supreme Court, acclaimed actress and singer Bette Midler sent out a tweet quoting a controversial lyric from a John Lennon and Yoko Ono song. That tweet and a follow-up defending and attempting to explain her initial tweet, both of which have since been deleted, were met with intense backlash and led to a conversation on a continuing issue about the intersection of gender, race, and advocacy.
“‘Women, are the n-word of the world,’” Midler tweeted. “Raped, beaten, enslaved, married off, worked like dumb animals; denied education and inheritance; enduring the pain and danger of childbirth and life IN SILENCE for THOUSANDS of years[.]”
Criticism came immediately from The Atlantic reporter Jemele Hill and other Twitter users who responded that Midler had no right to use the offensive word.
Midler later apologized for her words, writing, “Angrily I tweeted w/o thinking my choice of words would be enraging to black women who doubly suffer, both by being women and by being black. I am an ally and stand with you; always have. And I apologize.”
But Midler’s comments point to a greater issue. Other than her use of the racial slur, she wrote of the afflictions of women: of rape, violence, forced marriages, servitude, and lack of opportunity. While all these are true, we must consider the context in which she wrote them. Admittedly, she wrote in anger in the midst of Kavanaugh’s nomination and impending confirmation. She wrote them about how women’s experiences are disregarded, but she also wrote without thinking about how her words would be viewed by women of color. She wrote from the perspective of white feminism.
White feminism is a difficult concept to describe. It isn’t singularly defined or finite. It is a continuous and constantly changing idea about gender and race. It encompasses the idea that white women do not and cannot have the sexist experiences of women of color, and do not consider that these differences exist. A white woman is a white feminist if she does not believe or understand her privilege.
There are many signs indicating a white feminist, but the greatest may be a white woman who does not understand that she, like all white people, benefit from a white-led society. White feminists are those so privileged that they are able to ignore systematic racism, bigotry, — and yes, some types of sexism — just because it does not apply to them.
The idea of white privilege makes white people uncomfortable; even for people who are advocates for equality, diversity, and representation, the idea of one’s own privilege is daunting, but it is so ingrained in society that it cannot be ignored.
Why has this become a conversation about race? Some may question why everything has to be about race or why we can’t just talk about sexism. But that’s the problem. Oppression and marginalization is intersectional. Race and gender — as well as class, nationality, disability, age, and sexuality — are interconnected and interdependent. You cannot talk about one without considering the other. White women will never understand the struggles of being a woman of color, but they can be an ally, they can give women of color a seat at the table that their privilege inherently provides. They can help women of color have a voice in these conversations.
To have this discourse, however, we must think before we speak and not spew our words in anger. Twitter, social media platforms, and the internet itself have given us avenues to do this like never before. It has given the voiceless voices, but it has also given people the liberty to say whatever they see fit. Unlike Midler, most Twitter users are not high-profile celebrities. Most will not be criticized for tone-deaf comments or white feminist tweets.
Most of the time, we don’t really consider the impact of our words, and what they mean to people who we don’t directly interact with, but we should. Midler's apology acknowledges this and the implication of her words. Hopefully, she will learn from this. Hopefully, we will learn from this. The only way to combat sexism and racism and all intersectional systems of marginalization is to do it together. We as a society can do better.

The world of academia just got exposed, and it isn’t pretty.
As reported by The Atlantic, three humanities scholars have spent the past 12 months writing 20 papers boasting ridiculous claims, attempting to get them published within reputable journals in areas such as gender studies and queer studies. Despite how ludicrous their submissions were (one paper suggested physically abusing privileged students as a form of historical reparation), their success rate is even more stupefying: seven were published, seven were still under review, and only six had been outright rejected.
This hoax has been termed “Sokal Squared” in honor of the original experiment conducted by Alan Sokal, a professor of Physics at New York University in the 1990s. The original Sokal hoax did much the same thing, but Sokal Squared is of far greater scope (hence the name).
The issue with targeting academia is that no matter what you find, you’re going to upset someone, especially in our politically charged atmosphere. Sokal Squared proved that to a T; as information about the study was revealed, conservative media had a field day. With a significant portion of the right comprised of climate change deniers and individuals with staunch anti-science views, conservatives didn’t lose any time in using Sokal Squared to discredit anything and everything contrary to their beliefs. Meanwhile, the left tried their best to defend their favorite liberal outlets, attempting to justify the error by saying that some areas of study are “morally” justified and that the mistakes shouldn’t be extrapolated indiscriminately.
Both sides are wrong, trying to frame the facts in their own self-serving contexts. But more than anything, Sokal Squared proves absolutely nothing - aside from the fact that even academics like to pull pranks.
Anyone who’s even remotely open-minded and rational understands that because research and peer-review are done by humans, things are bound to go wrong. It’s unfair to hold science to an unrealistic standard of perfection, and just flat out wrong to do it for selfish, ideological goals.
If you think about it, the peer-review process for distinguished journals in all fields of inquiry acts like a sieve to separate the legitimate contributions from the general riff-raff, giving the spotlight to the work that’s most deserving. That’s not to say, of course, that incorrect data or unsubstantiated papers never make it through. Whenever that happens, though,  those who see science and intellectual progression as a threat—rather than a boon—to their way of life seize upon it, using extreme induction to claim that everything else is wrong. It’s the equivalent of saying that getting one question wrong on a 100 question test results in a score of zero.
Peer-review and research are imperfect processes, and even more so when you try to game the system. The problem with the premise of Sokal Squared is that if you intentionally send out a concentrated blast of junk, proportionally more of it is going to make it through the net. What’s more, given the volume of articles peer reviewers must go through, it’s impossible to maintain the same level of scrutiny for every one of the innumerable papers that they come across. So yes, a large portion of the 20 papers that were put out did make it into the review process, but all that proves is that the flaws that have been long-suspected of existing are there.
The more concerning question is what will come of Sokal Squared. Despite having contributed nothing, the hoax helped stir the pot, galvanizing those who try their hardest to defeat science (as stupid as that sounds). It’s ironic when those who decry scientific inquiry nevertheless benefit from resulting innovations, they complain noticeably less, and with an administration dependent on such individuals as a voter base, the future seems increasingly uncertain. One can only hope that as the younger generation becomes more cemented in society, we can change the status quo from the top down.
Right now, it’s not possible to ensure perfection for every research project, so that’s not an option. Rather, so long as we focus on our pursuits and avoid stooping to their level, we can lead by example, working towards a brighter future for all and making sure that big topics in science — space exploration, climate change, and renewable energy — remain at the forefront of the national conversation.
Together, as a community of scholars and citizens, we must do our part to stifle ignorance with intellect.

Earlier this week, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (UN IPCC) published their report Global Warming of 1.5°C. In short, the report tells us that we have twelve years to enact planet-saving measures that keep global warming below the critical mark of 1.5 degrees. That might not sound like much, but the earth has already warmed by one degree since the beginning of the industrial period. Letting warming slip to two degrees could, according to the report, significantly increase the risk of more extreme weather and the resultant social problems — including food shortages. And that’s before we bring up the serious geopolitical problems that would be introduced when whole regions of the world find their natural resources depleted.
And yet, the bigger news story of the week was Kanye West’s rambling, roundabout rant in the White House. 
It probably comes as no surprise that our president — who has famously described global warming as a Chinese-invented hoax and has used winter snow as evidence that climate change isn’t happening — has been largely silent on the IPCC’s findings. In an attempt to reassure concerned Americans, President Trump said, “I want to look at who drew it… Because I can give you reports that are fabulous, and I can give you reports that aren’t so good. But I will be looking at it, absolutely.” That was Tuesday; he’s said nothing since then. But I don’t want this to just be a rant about Trump. We’ve all had plenty of those, and if a group of UN scientists and experts can’t convince the man that global warming is a serious and genuine threat to the country and the world, I don’t stand a chance. The problem, really, is the general apathy toward climate change from politicians across both sides of the aisle. 
If it is true that we only have twelve years to seriously correct our course when it comes to climate change, transitioning to a more environmentally sustainable country should be the number one issue in the upcoming elections. But it doesn’t seem that way. The party currently in control of Congress can’t decide if climate change is actually real, and is perfectly happy continuing to act in the interest of numerous polluting corporations. As a result, the bar is set low when it comes to American environmental policy - and it shows. 
The Democrats — supposedly an opposition party — acknowledge the existence of climate change, which is a good start, but not much about their stance towards the environment suggests any sense of urgency about the consequences of unchecked climate change. In June of this year, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer went after President Trump, calling on the President to do something to lower the price of gasoline. Because as the earth warms, in large part thanks to the effects of greenhouse gases, the solution is to make them cheaper to burn? And in August, the Democratic party reneged on a promise they made just two months earlier to stop taking donations from the fossil fuel industry. Neither Democratic party leader — not Chuck Schumer in the Senate nor Nancy Pelosi in the House of Representatives — have made any message on social media regarding the IPCC report. Quite simply, they’re not doing enough. Yes, they’re worlds better than the alternative - but now is truly the time that we need to demand more from our government when it comes to climate. That means that we can’t settle for anything less than a true rethink of the way we produce and use energy in this country. 
Our generation has shown before that we are willing to make our voices heard on the issues that matter to us. Crucially, it is our generation that will have to live with the ramifications of today’s inaction. The IPCC report tells us that it is still possible to keep global warming below the 1.5-degree threshold and stave off the most serious environmental, social, and geopolitical problems that climate change would bring. But politicians have made it clear that they need persuading in order to enact policy that looks after the earth rather than oil executives, and it is going to be our job to make the case that the future of the planet is something that matters.

One year after the movement started in America, following the revelations of sexual assault by Harvey Weinstein published in The New Yorker, #MeToo has finally arrived in India. 
It started in Bollywood, one of the biggest film industries in the world, with actress Tanushree Dutta accusing fellow actor-activist Nana Patekar of sexual harassment on the sets of a film they were co-starring in in 2009. On Oct. 4, writer Mahima Kukreja tweeted that popular standup comedian Utsav Chakraborty had sent her unsolicited photos of his private parts. 
Then the dam burst open with female journalists leading the way. Several male journalists and popular editors were named and shamed. Journalists Ghazala Wahab, Shutapa Paul, and CNN scribe Majlie de Puy Camp have accused MJ Akbar, the current Minister of State External Affairs of the Indian Government of sexual harassment and molestation during his time as the editor of some national newspapers.
Directors and actors were revealed to have been seeking sexual favors and harassing actresses and their other female coworkers on set. Chetan Bhagat, one of the most popular authors of fiction novels in India, was also accused of harassing a female journalist who’d once interviewed him. Women in the music industry too came out with their stories of harassment. 
Throughout the last month, as #MeToo gained more momentum, the movement remained free of political involvement, with no major political party coming up to try to claim the movement. And that is the uniqueness of the movement as it takes place in India. Women like journalist Sandhya Menon, social news writer Sonia Mariam Thomas, and popular singer Chinmayee Sripada, have led the movement, calling out men in their respective professions for harassing women and tweeting the DMs that they receive from women who wish to share their experiences anonymously. In this way,  #MeToo has become the very symbol of sisterhood, the age-old culture of women supporting and helping each other in times of difficulty.
And these are times of difficulty. The #MeToo movement has irrevocably changed the very cultural, socioeconomic and political structures of India, challenging the hierarchies that shield men of power from justice. 
It is the culmination of all the events of violence against women, a number that has increased since the horrific gang rape of Nirbhaya in 2012, following the broken promise of the current government of safety for women, one of the reasons why they’d come to power in 2014; the horrific rape and murder of an eight-year-old child in Kathua, politicized to the anger and frustration of the people; the Unnao rape victim’s father’s murder by the goons of a politician belonging to the same party as the one she’d accused of raping her, and the numerous victims of acid-attacks by men whose advances they’d spurned. 
This is an expression of rage and frustration of women in India, but there are other classes of women in India who #MeToo cannot provide a platform to speak up for: women belonging to the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum have access to neither the technology nor the power, to speak up. Especially for women who were forced into the Jogini or Devadasi system, in which girls as young as 7 are “dedicated” to the god and then are raped by men of power in the village or locality. The Devadasi practice had been outlawed in India in 1988 but still continues to illegally exist in several pockets of the country. Women belonging to “lower” castes in India and Dalit women also face violence — physical, sexual, verbal — meted upon them by upper caste men or by men belonging to their own caste. Girls are also forced into the Human Trafficking market for sexual exploitation or bonded labor, which, although illegal, continues to be a significant problem.
These women have internalized this violence, accepted it as their fate. They do not have access to better opportunities beyond what education offers, and access to proper pedagogical resources, too, is nearly impossible for them.
Even as conversations on the #MeToo platform continue to encourage other women who have the access to technology and the internet to speak out and provide support for each other, a parallel conversation should also be conducted on how to empower women who do not have this access. The goal of #MeToo will be left incomplete without the inclusion of all these women, because every woman left behind in this conversation, without the knowledge that a system of support exists for them, is a failure of the society’s duty to provide safe spaces for people who have experienced violence of all kinds. 
This celebration of sisterhood, of feminism, in these times of societal and personal difficulties, as we come face-to-face with revelations made by several women and men of the violence that they faced in their lives, should continue, along with reaching out to other marginalized women too.

Before beginning this, I would like to confirm a few things. First, I am not saying Columbus is not a good person at all. Second, I am also not saying that genocide did not occur in the New World, because it most certainly did. The argument here is to consider whether or not Columbus himself was a perpetrator of genocide, as many people make it out to be. The definition of genocide, paraphrasing the United Nation's definition, is a series of acts “committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”. The key word is intent, which would be looking at if Columbus had any intention of destroying the native population prior to when he got there, or during his time as governor of Hispaniola. 
Before looking at whether or not Columbus committed genocide, there are a few other misconceptions that need to be cleared up. First, Columbus knew he wasn’t in India. He thought he was somewhere off the coast of Japan. This wasn’t because he miscalculated the distance, but rather because no one really knew how large Asia was, where Japan really was, or whether or not the new land was connected to Asia. Second, Columbus was only the governor of Hispaniola until 1500, when he was removed for mismanagement - a point to be discussed later. Third, around 90 percent of the native population was killed by disease, and many of them died before any European even set foot in the New World. This was an unintended consequence, as the natives had no natural immunity built up to European diseases and disease could spread faster than Europeans can travel. 
To determine intent, we have to look at Columbus’ words and actions. This is difficult, as both are often taken out of context. For example, take his journal entries. Many people cite the fact that he wanted to enslave the natives as soon as he got there, but there are a few problems with this. One, his journals are all transcriptions of the original journals that no longer exist. Two, there are multiple translations and they all differ, with some of the English translations a lot more biased than others. Three, many of those quotes get taken out of context. There are two big things people say his journals reveal. To paraphrase, one thing he says is that he wanted to enslave them and the second thing he says is that he could take 50 men and conquer and govern the natives as he wanted to. These are both misleading. 
For starters, using a translation found in Readings in Latin American Civilization (thank you, Global Histories), he states that he thinks the people are “ingenious,” could be good servants, and could “readily become Christians.” He also goes on further to say that he wants to bring six of the natives back to Europe so that they can learn the language. Often, the only part of the quote shown is the part where Columbus says they could be “good servants.” But when put in context, that doesn’t mean he wanted to enslave them. The term "servant" could mean servant of God, or just a general servant. As for the other quote, that could hint at an intent to commit violence against the native population. However, this is the part where the different translations can say different things. In many English translations, that quote appears, but in the old Spanish transcription by Bartolome de las Casas, found in The Diario of Christopher Columbus’s First Voyage to America, there is no mention of Columbus wanting to conquer the natives. He does say that with 50 men, all the natives could be held in “subjection.” But to put that in full context, he’s also asking the king and queen what to do about new settlements, and he’s telling them that 50 men could hold the island if needed. This is corroborated by another translation from an  American Journeys Collection document, document AJ-062. Looking at both quotes in full context, we can see that he didn’t come to Hispaniola with the intent to enslave and brutalize the native population. 
The second aspect that needs to be considered is his time as governor of Hispaniola. He was removed in 1500 by the monarch because he was mistreating the Spanish colonists under his rule and was put in jail for six weeks. He most certainly mistreated the natives, and there is no doubt about that. But there is a letter he wrote while in jail where he says a few key things. The translation comes from another American Journeys Collection document, document AJ-067. He basically is complaining about native girls as young as nine or ten being sold into sexual slavery (another quote that is often taken out of context), and that there were many colonists who “did not deserve water in the sight of God and of the world.” He also states before that he could have taken advantage of his position, but “the maintenance of justice and the extension of the dominion of Her Highness has hitherto kept me down.” It does seem that his regime in Hispaniola was brutal, but a lot of the violence inflicted against the natives was done by the colonists themselves and not a direct result of Columbus’s orders. Based on this letter, Columbus was even against a lot of that violence and tried punishing the colonists for it. Columbus clearly isn’t a good person, but as of now, we are in the peak periods of his life where his actions and words can be interpreted as having the intention of commit genocide, and nothing really indicates that. 
Genocide is a long process. People don’t just wake up one day and then decide to kill off an entire group of people for fun. It’s violence against a group being normalized until it becomes systematic and targeted killings. Based on this, genocide definitely occurred in the new world, but Columbus wasn’t the main perpetrator and didn’t really have the intent to commit genocide. It was later governors of Hispaniola, like Nicolas de Ovando, and later conquistadors, such as Hernan Cortes, who had clear intent to commit genocide, and many individual colonists were part of the process. It’s misleading to attribute such a long span of awful history on just one man, but that’s what seems to have happened. History is much more complicated than that.

“Pulling a Taylor Swift” is a term/phrase I’ve affectionately coined throughout casual discussion with my friends and in my podcast, AP Marvel. It means to problematically abstain or remain neutral as a business tactic. Similar to how Iron Man 2 embodied Disney’s neutral stance on American warfare and the military industrial complex, Taylor Swift remained silent during the 2016 presidential selection in order to prevent alienating a political side of her fanbase.
In the wake of Taylor Swift’s endorsement of Tennessee Senator Phil Bresdesen and Representative Jim Cooper via Instagram, it seems like “pulling a Taylor Swift” is no longer a relevant phrase I can use. Or is it? Let’s analyze the post that sparked “65,000 registrations in a single 24-hour period," as stated by Kamari Guthrie, director of communications for Vote.org, to Buzzfeed News.
In her first paragraph, Swift clearly states her beliefs in order to dispel those who used her as a white supremacist figurehead. Previously, Swift’s political silence, distinctly American lifestyle – i.e. all of her friends were white, and cultural insensitivities prompted white supremacists to cite her as an “Aryan goddess”, according to NPR. Swift then admits her reluctance to speak out politically and how she “feel[s] very differently about that now,” yet remains true to her own values, stating that “I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country.” 
“Human rights” is a loaded word she throws into her post, using the broad definition before going into her specific views on LGBTQ rights, discrimination, and racism – the former of which felt like a given, the latter two carrying more of a personal tie to her career due to the whitewashing and appropriation incidents stemming from her music videos, “Wildest Dreams” and “Shake It Off.” Each sentence is firm, clear-cut, and succinct, yet is written in a calculated way that still carries the weight of her own opinion. Her views are still her own, and it will be extremely hard for anyone to get Swift to change her mind. 
The second paragraph of her post is the longest, where Swift chooses to go into more detail about Tennessee Senate candidates Marsha Blackburn and Phil Bredesen and Tennessee House candidate Jim Cooper. She acknowledges her own regrets of not being able to fully support having more women in office before offering a detailed history (for an Instagram post) about Blackburn’s political voting record. However, her case and political appeals would have been stronger if she had also mentioned Bredesen and Cooper’s own political beliefs, pushing forward a problematic black & white mentality of politics and support. 
Within her first sentence, Swift pushes forward this stark black & white, or “burn it all down” mentality that is a horrifyingly large problem in politics today. It is a “you’re with us or you’re against us” mindset that became more widespread after the 2016 presidential election, leading to relationships, communities, and families torn apart by political beliefs. It also spreads within news coverage, with Democrats and Republicans painted as firmly good or evil. This mentality is not new, but the political divide has become much deeper and wider since 2016. Swift’s neglect to discuss more about Bredesen and Cooper’s beliefs in her post prevents the young voters she’s inspiring an opportunity from “educat[ing] yourself on the candidates running in your state,” adding an unnecessary crack in the already-colossally deep political divide.
There’s only one key element in her third paragraph to analyze, and that is the date she advertises: Oct. 9, the last day to register to vote in Tennessee. Swift made this post on Oct. 8, which raises the question: why not earlier?
This is a question that plagues Taylor Swift’s entire history with political activism. Why didn’t she speak out about the 2016 presidential election? Why didn’t she speak at or about women’s marches? Why didn’t she speak out during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings, especially since sexual assault was such an important issue to a former victim like herself that she would sue a radio host for a dollar over it just to make a point?
The world has finally cornered Taylor Swift into a place where taking a political stance was not just the only move she could make, but the best move she could make. Swift met with not just media attention, but also relieved reactions from the fans who questioned her silence. Fans talk about how Taylor Swift is reclaiming her political narrative from the white supremacists who painted her as their American sweetheart.
Quite honestly, I have little doubt that the beliefs that Swift posted about on Instagram are her true ones. It is simply convenient that her beliefs fall in line with the Democratic beliefs of Hollywood and a slightly more substantial portion of her fans. In the grand scheme of things, Taylor Swift’s political beliefs don’t matter. In a survey about celebrity opinion conducted by The Hollywood Reporter, 58 percent of individuals across the United States were not interested in the political and social opinions of celebrities, with only nine percent of respondents strongly interested in what celebrities have to say. In fact, it is more impactful for celebrities to voice their opinions on “universal issues with bipartisan appeal.”
What we should really be asking is “why.” Why is she supporting Phil Bredesen and Jim Cooper? Why is she choosing to voice this opinion to her fans? Swift urges us to “vote based on who most closely represents your values”, and we as a public have had little context to what these values are and why they matter to her, making us question why what she says should matter.
In the last sentence of Swift’s second paragraph, she states that “For a lot of us, we may never find a candidate or party with whom we agree 100% on every issue, but we have to vote anyway.” Swift also suffers from this same ordeal. While Swift doesn’t want to entirely voice her political beliefs, she must speak anyway. Unfortunately, as much as she tries to hide it, she is not speaking for the right reasons.

The Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) demonstration at the Technical Opportunities Conference (TOC) misses the point.
Shortly after the TOC (which I couldn't attend), I read a Tartan article reporting on this action. I felt the Carnegie Mellon SDS's actions were debatable, and their reasons as reported by The Tartan simplistic. On the action themselves, this action is unlikely to have any effect on the four companies targeted (why those four and not include Boeing, for instance?). At best, they may decide to go recruit elsewhere, but this is not going to impact their behavior and profits in any way. This is not going to have the sort of impact as the Stanford April 3rd movement. 
On the other side, it may have some negative consequences on the image of Carnegie Mellon and its alumni, as this protest will be associated with Carnegie Mellon's image. Student outreach and fostering a debate on other opportunities could have been as appropriate without publicly involving the school. But regardless of the actual action, I have been unable to get any further information on the reason and the objective of Carnegie Mellon's new SDS movement apart from The Tartan reporting and the previous SDS article. Saying that corporations that work for the U.S. military (usually with close cooperation with the federal government) are "bad for humanity" is quite naïve and imprecise, and Lockheed Martin profits come basically from the federal government (either federal contract or exportation obtained by the US diplomacy). Those profits from selling weapons are, and the use of said weapons are, as much the federal government responsibility as from the company. Also, like Ukraine, the South China Sea, South Ossetia, and many others can testify, some geopolitics actors are keen to use force and military might in order to achieve their end, meaning that democracies cannot get rid of their armed forces, and consequently there will be an industrial base to produce the said weapon. That said there are indeed several actual problems with the military-industrial complex in the United States, which require precision.
The term "military-industrial complex" was coined by President Eisenhower in his final address, where the WWII general warned the USA to guard against its military-industrial complex. His point was not that there should be no industry dedicated to fulfilling the need of the armed forces, but that the people and its representative should not let the military industrial unchecked and exert oversight and control over the military. And today, sadly, the representatives of the United States citizens has failed to keep this complex in check. The modern United States tends to have a big respect for its soldiers and veterans but fails to make the criticism it badly needs. The Vietnam war was followed by actual criticism of the decision taken and changes. The last military operation that was a strategic victory is 91 the First Gulf War. Several unsuccessful military operations later, no criticism of them is in sight. While all the other budget is reduced and federal investment in infrastructure, healthcare is usually opposed by part of the public opinion. It is worth mentioning that the biggest federal infrastructure investment since the end of the war — with the interstate network built by the same Eisenhower — managed to pass it on the defense budget. This issue will not be solved by protesting the companies but by getting involved in politics and holding your representative accountable.
The selling of weapons to dictators and their use against civilians is the responsibility of the government that approved this exportation (of which the U.S. is far from being the only one guilty). This is also the point where I’d like to remind people that a lot of military technologies have dual purposes and that without the military industrial complex a lot of technologies would simply not exist. The internet was made possible by the involvement of DARPA. GPS was a military network, and even more so, satellites are still launched over derivative of ICBMs. (Who would have bet that Nazi V2 would lead to such a vital technology?). Less well known, the Silicon Valley ecosystem emerged because of the military industrial complex research on radars during the cold war.
Military research has its ethical issues, but precise cases need to be invoked. Who denigrates Einstein, Oppenheimer, Fermi for their involvement in the Manhattan project and in the two atomic detonations over Japan? They served their country in a time of war, and the decision was made by the president of the United States. Today, the ethical issue over armed drones, the use of neural networks for target acquisition are actual real things that deserve to be debated. For instance, my home country has decided against having armed drones, and drone pilots are projected to the theatre and instead of operating from the metropole and going back home after a day job of shooting people like U.S. drones operator do. Autonomous vehicles, targeting without humans in the loop, are subject that need to be debated and on which we may decide on the red-lines that we refuse to cross (similar to the ones making obvious that no one at Carnegie Mellon is ever going to work on offensive chemical or biological weapons).
And yet, as the latest issue of The Tartan mentions, the DARPA Urban challenge is one of the things that made possible the self-driving vehicle ecosystem that has hired many from Carnegie Mellon (Uber, Waymo and others).
To sum up, military industrial complex involvement at Carnegie Mellon is not a "bad" thing, by itself, but individual research project ethical issue should not be overlooked. The SDS should strive to tackle specific issues along with participating in a broader movement to hold accountable the government. And as the issues of the military complex are mainly political, for you readers that are U.S. citizen, it is also precisely time to express yourself in the coming midterms (the elections, but good luck everyone for the midterm exams too).
The author is a current Masters student who wishes to be anonymous but consents to be directly contacted with SDS if requested.

Madeline Kim’s article, “The fallacy of the mainstream #BelieveWomen tag,” intelligently parses the relationship between the #BelieveWomen tag and some statistics of sexual assault, but she gets her lesson fundamentally wrong. The “fallacy” of the #BelieveWomen tag, she claims, is that it doesn’t represent other (male or otherwise) voices of sexual assault, and furthermore that “the message #BelieveWomen can easily be perverted into becoming an environment where male victims fear that their voices…won’t be heard.” This is simply a return to the same rationale volleyed against the #BlackLivesMatter tag. #BlackLivesMatter does not mean, imply, or attempt to bring about a world in which white lives don’t matter. Neither does #BelieveWomen mean, imply, or attempt to bring about a world in which men aren’t believed. The point is that men are believed and women aren’t, just as the point is that white lives do matter, and black lives don’t in our society. The tag is simply one in the long history of women attempting to gain their legitimate and justified authority, not an attempt to gain authority over others.
