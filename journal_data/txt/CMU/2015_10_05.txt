She may only be halfway through her college career, but sophomore midfielder Morgan Kontor believes she is becoming a quiet leader on her team. She exemplifies how to be a clutch player for her team when the time comes.
The materials science & engineering and biomedical engineering double major from Annapolis, Md. most recently scored an incredible game-tying goal in the waning seconds of a game against Capital on Sunday, Sept. 27. She headed a beautiful pass from her teammate, sophomore midfielder Haili Adams, into the top of the goal, forcing the game into overtime and ultimately securing her team the win. The victory continued their impressive undefeated streak.
Kontor did not get to this moment of success without a lifetime of commitment to the game. She first stepped foot onto the pitch in a neighborhood recreational league at the age of five and never looked back.
She eventually moved on to playing for her high school and the Maryland United FC before making her journey to Carnegie Mellon. Kontor knew she had to step her game up when she came into the collegiate atmosphere. “Everyone is good, the game is always faster and the teams play better together”, Kontor said of the transition to collegiate athletics. However, with her sophomore class constituting a large chunk of the team, she feels that her team is as cohesive as ever and sees even better opportunities for success emerging in the future for her team. When she came to the school, her favorite part of joining the soccer program was the friends she immediately made through her teammates, creating a truly “authentic family” within the team, which is clearly reflected in their outstanding undefeated record this season.
But not every game has been an easy victory, and her game-tying goal against Capital is the epitome of Kontor’s success so far at Carnegie Mellon. Kontor recalls the moment vividly: As the final minute of the game ticked away, she remembers thinking, “There’s no way we’ll make it through this with a win,” her team being down a goal and no immediate solution in sight. The seconds continued to tick away, and Kontor’s teammate Haili Adams miraculously dribbled through four defenders and got a beautiful pass off in Kontor’s direction. The next few seconds became a blur of movement and adrenaline for Kontor. “I just got something on it,” she said, “I can’t recall whether it was my head or my shoulder but I got a touch and I knew it went in.” The team erupted in celebration, but the happiness quickly reverted to business because the game was not over — the goal had only been enough to tie the game for the Tartans.
Kontor saw things differently. “We had to win at that point. That was only way it could happen after that goal,” she said. And she was right. The Tartans managed to score an overtime goal and take the victory to continue their undefeated season on the wings of Kontor’s game-tying goal.
Kontor remains humble about the game, though. “I was just doing what I needed to, being in the right place at the right time” she said, and she knows it was a collective effort of her teammates to make that goal happen. She said her teammates trust each other, and she was impressed “by the amount of resilience my team showed in staying in that game.” But Kontor, along with the rest of the Tartan women, are looking forward. The ultimate goal is to make it far into the NCAA tournament and possibly win, she says, but the team isn’t focused on that right now. Kontor says the first goal is to win the next game, and after that to win the UAA conference.
If they take their goals step by step, she says, the ultimate goal will come easily.
Success for a Carnegie Mellon athlete, however, must come in both academic and athletic forms. When asked about how she balances schoolwork and athletics, Kontor said she resorts to simple time management strategies, and emphasized that she gets enough sleep at all times. She also sees her sport as a stress relief mechanism, allowing her to get her mind off school when perhaps the thought might be too overwhelming. Kontor is still figuring out what she wants to do when she graduates, but says she would like to become a coach of her own soccer team one day. But for now, her team will look to continue running the table, and with great team synergy and trust among everyone, it looks as if the Tartan women are on track for a perfect season.
Kontor knows she’s the clutch player, and wants to be along for that ride.

A leader on the Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team, senior Abishek Alla feels that playing for the tennis team gives him an outlet for competition outside of the class. The civil and environmental engineering major from Hyderabad, India has showcased dominant play over the last couple years, competed as the Tartan’s number one singles player for the past two seasons, and been named an All-American in singles both years.
When discussing his choice to participate with the team, he called attention to the break tennis provides from a day full of academic activities. Alla embraces his participation in tennis for the sheer enjoyment of being on top of the sport’s competition.
“I’m playing more seriously only because that’s a release from academics and it’s more to fun to be on the court than to be somewhere else,” said Alla.
In high school, Alla competed at a sports academy where athletics was a focus. Coming to Carnegie Mellon was a big change, but luckily he made the adjustment successfully.
“I came in prepared for [school] to be harder and then I guess it started going off well the first few weeks, and then it just kept going that way.”
Entering school at Carnegie Mellon poses challenges for many first-year students unfamiliar with the workload, and Alla noted that this makes it especially difficult for athletes at the university to balance their time well.
Late in the season, he pointed out, there is importance in “staying on top of all the academics so it doesn’t affect the playing in UAAs [the University Athletics Association Conference Championships]”.
However, he also observed that the impact of sports can be a great positive force on the athletes in season. When in season, athletes learn to do work efficiently for their classes, using time outside of practice better while operating under the added time pressure.
“I couldn’t see myself not playing. If I wasn’t playing tennis I feel like I’d have a lot of free time,” Alla said. Alla explained that since tennis teaches the players about “unconsciously finishing work,” when they aren’t playing; there is a lot of free time.
This makes a good lesson for the younger athletes, since, Alla said, the younger members of the team are still learning to manage the different academic load and find balance with other activities. Alla sees losing sleep as the big pitfall to a student athlete looking to succeed in school and in tennis.
He advises that “if you’re spending too much time on a problem you should just go to the TA [teaching assistant] and ask for help or just email someone instead of staying up for 12 hours doing it on your own.”
Successfully adjusting to the academic workload will be key for the tennis team this season, with a strong first-year presence on the team that’s sure to be large part of the winning formula.
Alla explains that a strong work ethic from the first-years on the team this season is making up for the loss of three of last years seniors from the varsity team and giving the team a chance to “make history.”
Alla views this weekend’s upcoming ITA regional tournament in Fredericksburg Virginia as a good test of how both he and the team stack up competitively against the competition. In the singles tournament, he expects strong competition, both with rival tennis players, like a strong player from John’s Hopkins University who Alla believes is likely to take the top seed in the draw, and with teammates. He anticipates many of the tough matches to come against other strong Carnegie Mellon tennis players who will also play in the tournament.
In addition to being able to cope with added academic responsibility, Alla explains the significance of the coaching staff in allowing the tennis players from both the men’s and women’s teams to train efficiently through the season. The tennis coaching staff must deal with limited court openings throughout the day, needing to organize times for all athletes on both tennis teams to take advantage of the courts closed to public use during the day.
On the whole, Alla’s experience handling tennis along with a typical student workload helps him succeed both on and off the court.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team has gotten off to an incredible 7–2–1 start. Senior goalkeeper Eric Bykowsky has been a critical part of the effort, having led the defense to five shutouts this season.
The business administration major from Columbia, SC hasn’t always been a goalie. “My parents got me into soccer when I was four, and I kept playing all the way up through high school,” Bykowsky said, recalling the twisting path he took to get to this point. “I started off as an attacker, but they figured out I wasn’t fast enough.”
As the speed of the game got faster, Bykowsky needed to make a switch in position. “When I was midfielder, I had the endurance, but they figured out I didn’t have the foot skills. They moved me to defender, where I didn’t even have enough skills for that.” Despite the constant shifting out of roles, Bykowsky remained optimistic about staying on the team and playing. “Coach put me in goalie for a game, and I ended up starting.”
Though Bykowsky played for the school team during his years in elementary, middle, and high schools, he considered club soccer the true competition where he was forged in fire. “I had a coach who really pushed me, and the hard work I put into it really prepared me for success in college.”
The time he put into soccer helped him utilize his time outside the sport efficiently. Undoubtedly, his investment into the sport would pay off. “We won the regional championship my senior year, and we beat a couple of top teams in nationals before we lost to Michigan.”
Bykowsky believed that coming to Carnegie Mellon would be a great opportunity. “I knew I wanted to go into business, and I wanted to play soccer in college. I figured since Carnegie Mellon was top 10 in business that I’d be a perfect fit here,” said Bykowsky. Though Bykowsky became quickly introduced to the challenge of balancing his course load and his time with the team, he thrived under these constraints.
“The interesting thing about fall sports is that you’re coming in at the most stressful time for you. The time commitment for soccer is like adding three extra classes to your schedule. What it did for me was make me keep a schedule and get work done ahead of time. I actually did better in fall than spring academically. Try to explore as many opportunities as possible, don’t be afraid of a full schedule because it can keep you disciplined.”
Bykowsky has managed to maintain a strong commitment to academics and a strong commitment to the team. Though many aspects of the team have changed over the years, he believes that the team can go far.
“High level stuff changed about the club. We just had a new coach come in last year, and that was by far the biggest change we’ve seen in the program. We’ve got a fresh set of tactics and are playing cleaner soccer. There’s been a lot more discipline in the team, and we’re more accountable on and off the field. This year, we’re right where we need to be in the coaching transition, and our freshman class is the strongest we’ve had in the past four years. I’m very optimistic for this year.”
The Tartans’ great start has certainly seen just how well the changes have resonated with the team. The first game of the season against Muskingum University was the first chance to show their competition what the new team was made of, and the resounding 8-0 victory kicked off the season with a bang.
The Tartans have been able to thrive against strong competition, including a 4-3 victory against the then-number three ranked Messiah College. Though the road ahead will continue to provide challenges for the team, the performances so far given by Bykowsky and the team indicate that they are ready to take on anyone.
The final season for the senior goalkeeper will certainly be one to remember.

In the spring, Carnegie Mellon Ph.D. and junior faculty member Sam Ventura took a consulting job with the Pittsburgh Penguins. His path there is exemplary as a Carnegie Mellon success story. He started as a hockey fan and eventually, through working with former Carnegie Mellon statistics professor Andrew Thomas, turned that interest into being employed at the highest level of the sport.
Ventura’s rise to the Penguins began with hockey statistics site War-on-ice, a site he created with Thomas. “Andrew and I first started talking about hockey when he taught [a] sports statistics class,” said Ventura, referring to a mini course offered by Thomas in Ventura’s senior year.
Sports statistics have a long history, but until recently, as Ventura pointed out, many methods are not sufficient to tell the story of what occurs on the ice. “We were talking about how existing methods to rate players offensively and especially defensively were lacking.”
From those conversations emerged War-on-ice, which became the most well-known and comprehensive database for hockey statistics on the web.
Ventura and Thomas started by downloading the NHL’s play-by-play files and logging not just goals and assists but also things like takeaways, blocked shots, and the location of the puck during each of the events.
Through all of the information, the two created “a set of metrics that would provide a statistical rating for players offensively and defensively,” according to Ventura. That statistical rating became what many believe is hockey’s most powerful tool for evaluating players.
The metric measures the change in a team’s goal scoring rate when a player is on the ice for offensive rating. For defensive rating, it measures the rate of goals conceded by a player’s team when that player is on the ice. It controls for factors like “score state… and also which players they’re on the ice with…and which players they are playing against.” The paper describing the method was published in The Annals of Applied Statistics.
The site’s expansion began when Thomas organized a hockey analytics panel at the Joint Statistical Meetings in 2014. Michael Schuckers, Brian McDonald, Kevin Mongeon, and Mike Lopez — some of the foremost minds in hockey analytics — joined Ventura, and Thomas discussed hockey analytics on the panel. “There was a lot of question and answer from the audience and the question that eventually came up was, ‘If what you’re doing is so great… then why does nobody use it?’ … and we realized we weren’t doing a very good job of marketing what we had done,” Ventura said.
At the same time — maybe even the same day, according to Ventura’s memory — the person who ran the leading hockey analytics website, Extra Skater, was hired for a consulting job. “Basically in a weekend,” War-on-ice was born. Since most of the work was done in R, it could be easily put onto the web.
The site blew up fast. “We got a thousand Twitter followers without having sent a tweet out yet,” Ventura said.
The site was also interactive with the community. They responded quickly to people’s requests, kept the site up to date, and even posted metrics that followers may have thought up. “That sort of got us a lot of trust within the online community, which I think played a big role in popularizing the website,” he said.
Ventura and Thomas built the website to survive after they had moved on. War-on-ice is still being run despite both statisticians now working as consultants for teams, making the website a conflict of interest.
Ventura also acts as the faculty advisor for Tartan Sports Analytics, a club on campus for students with an interest in sports analytics. “They all have great ways of thinking about the different sports and they’re all pretty talented from the statistics perspective as well, which is hard to combine,” Ventura said about the articles the club publishes.
Ventura is currently an assistant coach for the club ice hockey team, and he is trying to recreate War-on-ice for their league. However, getting a consulting job for a professional hockey team is a strong affirmation of how important Ventura’s thoughts have been to the world of hockey analytics.

This past week was my strongest win to date.
My team put up 84 points for the week, while Team Leandro, who probably auto-drafted and then never edited his lineup, mustered a whopping 28 points.
I finally had a strong set of running backs to start — Le’Veon Bell came back from suspension, and LeGarrette Blount actually scored points. He really broke my heart in week two when he only rushed for four yards in his first appearance of the season, putting up a goose egg on the fantasy scoreboards. Unfortunately, my other running back, dead-to-me Jerick McKinnon, also rushed fewer than 10 yards.
But week three was a completely different story. Even though the Steelers struggled to score against the Ravens, Bell still showed why he was ranked the best overall draft pick of this season, rushing for 62 yards and scoring Pittsburgh’s only touchdown of the night. In the end, he still put 19 points on my board. I expect him to be my saving grace this season.
Blount’s week three fantasy success can be attributed mostly to the absolute failure of the Jaguars. He scored three touchdowns and rushed for 78 yards, coming to a grand total of 26 points for the week. The Patriots have their bye this week, so I’ll have to wait a little while to judge whether or not this was an absolute fluke, but my instincts say yes.
Because I can’t play Blount for week four, I’ll have to bring McKinnon back as a starter, as much as it pains me. Since I’m in a 20-player league, there are simply no quality running backs to be found on waivers. And since my team is basically a combination of stars and losers, I’m not comfortable letting anyone go in a trade.
Despite my perpetual running back woes, I’m still projected to come out on top this week against the St. Pete Seminoles. Although it’s possible that he has yet to even think about week four because he’s still starting two players with bye weeks. If that’s the case, I’m praying he sleeps past 1 p.m. on Sunday.
I definitely have him beat in terms of quarterbacking. Russell Wilson has been my most consistent player so far this season, and I’m confident that he’ll come through. St. Pete, however, is starting Andrew Luck, who will warm the bench this week because of a shoulder injury. Too bad he didn’t check, because Luck’s backup on the bench is Jameis Winston, who will face off against the Panthers this weekend. The Panthers are proving to be a force to be reckoned with this season, and I’m not sure the Buccaneers will stand a chance. That could have meant big points for St. Pete, but I’m not complaining.
At running back, I expect absolutely nothing from McKinnon, but I’m okay with that for now. Le’Veon Bell had a great performance Thursday night against Baltimore, even though the Steelers eventually suffered that painful defeat in overtime (looking at you Josh Scobee). Bell scored 20 points, which is realistically enough to make up for McKinnon and beat out both of St. Pete’s consistently single-digit-scoring running backs.
I’m starting Pierre Garcon and Nate Washington at wide receiver this week, who have both been consistently putting up between five and 10 points each week. St. Pete has Julio Jones, and, assuming he plays, I don’t expect either of my WRs to outscore him. I just need them to keep the gap as tight as possible. I also have wide receiver Eric Decker as my flex. He started the season strong but then suffered a knee injury in week two and sat on the bench week three. I’m cautious about his return, but hopeful that he’ll get back to where he was.
After week two I finally dropped wide receiver Nick Toon. As hilarious as his name is, he hasn’t scored a single point all season. In his place, I picked up Ladarius Green, who then got a pretty bad concussion. And now I’m back to where I started, with Jared Cook. He’s really just okay. But for this week I’ll survive because St. Pete is starting Eric Ebron, who is alright but no Gronk.
The Jets D/ST has had a pretty good season so far, and even though they slumped in week three, it isn’t enough to convince me to start my bench D/ST, the Giants. I still expect my Jets to be competitive against his Seahawks, so the defensive match-up should be interesting.
And finally, I have a confusing soft spot for kicker Brian McManus. Ever since his 18 point performance in week one, I’ve just kind of fallen in love. He isn’t even that much better than Nick Folk, who I’ve kept on my bench all season, but he’s my star and I’ll keep starting him unless he gives me a reason not to. Ian Tanaya also recently explained to me that it’s unusual for a team to keep two kickers, so I’m considering dropping Folk in order to fill a gap somewhere else.
After I win this week — which I will — I’ll increase my streak to two wins and stay tied for first place in my league. I’m still pretty confident that as I work out the kinks in my team and my own fantasy understanding, I’ll be a champion.

The NFL just recorded its first arrest-free month during the season for the first time in over a decade. Since the players aren’t getting themselves into trouble, maybe now would be a good time to change our focus to the shortcomings of the league itself.
Recently the NFL has been on the lobbying trail, preemptively fighting legislation that may come in reaction to Concussion, the Will Smith movie set to be released in November.
The movie is set to revolve around chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative brain condition. The Department of Veterans Affairs and Boston University jointly conducted a study of 91 deceased NFL players that found 96 percent of their brains showed evidence of CTE.
Player safety has been a mounting concern for the NFL in recent years, and a big-budget movie could bring the controversy to a head. The NFL has been taking shots from Congress and many others recently, from the controversial name of the NFL franchise in Washington D.C., the Redskins, to repeated instances of domestic violence perpetrated by players followed by wholly inadequate responses from the league.The league will be in very deep trouble, however, if lawmakers decide to go after the game the NFL plays.
The NFL’s response to concussions has basically been to try and eliminate the scariest moments on the field: when a player goes down after a huge hit and doesn’t get back up. Those moments are incredibly uncomfortable to watch on TV and are obvious reminders of the dangers of football. For both reasons, the NFL has incentive to reduce their frequency.
However, research says brain injuries in football — especially CTE — are not all-at-once events, usually coming as the result of a lifetime of blows to the head. The helmet-to-helmet hit bans and bans against hitting a defenseless receiver in football do not prevent this buildup of small moments of trauma.
If Congress takes notice of the NFL’s failed response to head injuries, two things can happen: The first is that Congress can try to legislate meaningful reforms into football. This means shorter and fewer practices, possibly the elimination of the kickoff and punt, and other things Congress can try to think up.
Secondly, Congress can target the NFL’s wallet. Congress has serious sway over the finances of the NFL. Two legal distinctions of the NFL — its not-for-profit status and the antitrust exemption that allows its franchises to work in lockstep — are what make the NFL a multi-billion-dollar corporation. Being treated as a for-profit or having its franchises broken up so that the financial rules are different for each team could seriously damage the NFL’s brand and, more importantly, its wallet.
The NFL knows that this fight is coming and has prepared accordingly. The league has a full time lobbying apparatus on the ground in Washington already at work. They’re spitting out all the old “this is all sensationalism and the media is a bunch of liars, and we’re angels” sound bytes we always hear every time someone tries to brush an epidemic of degenerative brain disease among employees under the rug.
With Will Smith and his movie shining extra light on the struggles of former NFL players, the NFL better find a way to stop the bleeding. This bit of good news, that no players have committed crimes for a calendar month, is legitimately good news. It’s somewhat hard to find 1700 people who go an entire month committing a total of zero crimes. However, while we give the players a gold star, it is best not to remember the “F” we have to give the league under the stewardship of commissioner Roger Goodell.
If concussions continue to be a problem and the league just says it cannot find any possible solution, a blockbuster movie-driven Congress might not stop at practice schedules. Without its nonprofit distinction, the NFL will be fine. It relinquished its tax-exempt status in April in what many people believe was an attempt to be more secretive about executive pay.
However, if it loses its antitrust exemption, the large amount of money in football means that the competitive balance in the league could be uniformly damaged if the financial rules become lopsided, leading to the destruction of football as we currently know it.

My personal favorite was Breaking Bad. The storyline was great, the acting was phenomenal, and did you see that ending? Fantastic.
I’m talking about my favorite television show, and, for those of you who aren’t laptop Netflix junkies, the television provides the outlet through which we watch these shows. Beginning in 1897, when J.J. Thompson was able to experimentally deflect cathode rays, the television has had a long and storied history. All-color electronic televisions were first standardized in 1953, but it wasn’t until 1990 that the modern version of digital television became possible.
The first type of television to become industrially popular was the analog television. The analog television contains a cathode ray tube (CRT), which is a vacuum containing an electron gun, a positively charged anode, and a negatively charged cathode. The electrons emitted from the electron gun are negative, so they flow from the cathode to the anode. The electron beam is then concentrated through a device called a focusing anode, after which it hits a phosphor screen on the opposite end of the CRT that glows when struck by high-energy electrons. 
In order to scatter the electrons across the screen and produce a full image, a copper wire coil is placed in the CRT. This coil creates a magnetic field when an electron beam is passed through it, and this magnetic field pushes the electrons in varying directions, causing them to scatter across the screen. It is this interaction of electrons and phosphor on the screen that produces a glowing image.
So the CRT creates the image on the screen, but how does a television know what image to produce? An analog television receives two kinds of signals, sounds and pictures, which are typically received either through an antenna, a cable set, or a satellite dish. The picture signal is transmitted over AM signals, and the sound over FM signals, much like AM and FM radio signals. Inside the television, a demodulator receives the FM signal and converts it into a sound signal, which is then converted to sound through the television’s speakers. As for the video signal, a receiver in the CRT takes the AM signal and transmits it as an amplification signal in the electron gun. This signal then modifies the intensity of the electron beam, producing the contrast of images that appear on the screen.
Although this type of television was popular for the majority of the twentieth century, and explains why the television is sometimes called “the tube,” CRT televisions are considered outdated by today’s technological standards. Today’s televisions run on a variety of different technologies, such as the popular liquid-crystal display (LCD). LCD televisions operate in a similar fashion to analog televisions, only instead of using a CRT to beam electrons at a screen it uses cold cathode florescent lamps to beam white light. In order to modify the light’s brightness, LCD shutters are placed in the television. These shutters open and close to transmit a certain intensity of light over an area of the screen. In order to distill out the desired color of the light, each shutter is paired with a color filter to pull out all but the desired color of the light beam.
Television is a relatively modern invention that has advanced from low-resolution, black-and white images to high-resolution, richly colored displays. Televisions rely on a signal input as well as some sort of conversion process to translate the signal into the images that we see on our screens. Even newer forms of technology are developing to create a 3-D television, which takes into account depth perception to simulate a three-dimensional feel on a two-dimensional screen. Now that’s televisionary.

Medicine is going through an incredible transformation and evolution as scientists uncover new and advanced ways to manipulate biology in the hope of improving human lives. Kathryn Whitehead, an assistant professor of chemical engineering at Carnegie Mellon, has made incredible contributions to this advancement through her extensive research on nanoparticles that target specific areas of the body in order to curb the threat of disease. Her research and accomplishments have recently earned her the honor of being featured on Popular Science’s Brilliant Top 10 List in 2015.
Whitehead completed her undergraduate degree in chemical engineering, but wasn’t particularly interested in applying her knowledge to oil refineries. As she began her graduate studies, chemical engineers were just beginning to extend their field into the scope of biomedical applications. Whitehead felt that using techniques “to help people and their problems” was a particularly rewarding use of her education.
Whitehead explained that chemical engineers developing techniques to modernize medicine generally have two goals. The first goal is to take drugs that are currently available in a non-friendly format, such as injections, and develop a friendlier system of delivery. For example, diabetics normally take insulin injections to control their blood sugar level, but researchers hope to bypass the injections by using a pill or a patch system to introduce a protein therapeutic into the body. The second goal is to take drugs that currently don’t have FDA approved methods of delivery and develop mechanisms for an efficient delivery system. These drugs, for example, can include modern genetic based mechanisms that manipulate the underlying biochemistry inside cells by altering DNA and protein expression.
Whitehead and her team of researchers have been working in the lab over the past five years on identifying useful chemical make-ups for nanoparticles using high throughput screening, a scientific method that uses robotics, data processing software, and various detectors to quickly run millions of chemical, genetic, or pharmaceutical tests. Throughout this process, Whitehead’s team has identified a subset of chemical compositions that are beneficial for turning the nanoparticles into useful tools for drug delivery. “We now have the technology, and our goal is to apply it to a variety of diseases,” Whitehead said.
The nanoparticles are carefully designed to distinguish between healthy and non-healthy cells using both active targeting and more subtle approaches. These methods can be extremely useful in cancer treatment. Current cancer treatment methods involve exposing the body to toxins in hope that the toxins kill the cancerous cells, but have a lower impact on the rest of the body. Unfortunately, many patients suffer from the toxins and experience grief and pain from their treatment. Nanoparticle drug delivery methods could improve cancer treatments by making the treatment more targeted. Cancerous cells have a unique biological make-up, which includes a different expression of protein ligands on the outside of their cells. Nanoparticles are able to target this unique external structure by using a lock and key mechanism. In this mechanism, when the nanoparticles travel through the bloodstream, they lock on to the proteins of interest on cancerous cells due to structural similarities between the two. Alternatively, a non-direct, but more complicated, approach involves detecting cells that over or under express certain proteins that cause the cell to develop a disease phenotype. In this method, once locked on the cell, the nanoparticle can deliver a toxin directly to the cell.
“Cancer therapy is so difficult for patients, in large part, because of the toxic side effects of chemotherapy,” Whitehead said in a university press release. “In contrast, our targeted nanoparticles deliver drugs only to cancerous tissue, sparing healthy cells. We expect these targeted treatments to extend the lives of cancer patients while increasing their quality of life through a reduction in side effects.” In a clinical setting, “these methods will not replace current treatments, but could be used in coordination to have a stronger, more targeted impact,” Whitehead said in an interview with The Tartan. Patients can be exposed to the nanoparticles during chemotherapy treatment to have a dual-faced attack and, hopefully, reduce the number of times a patient has to endure the chemotherapy toxins. Currently the research team is applying the nanoparticles to a variety of diseases ranging from cancer to chronic illnesses.
While Whitehead has worked very hard, she gives a lot of credit to her collaborators and research teams. A major aspect of her research involves working with clinicians at various hospitals, whose input is valuable as it reveals the practical impact these new techniques can have on patients. Whitehead also notes the importance of the students working in her labs. While she is proud of her ability to develop tangible products that could improve people’s lives, she sees the students she trains as another valuable product of her hard work. She wants them to develop the same intuition and passion she carries herself so that they will continue to develop great things in their own careers.
Whitehead has been able to find success early in her scientific career and make significant contributions to the scientific community. She believes the key to her success is that “she just keeps going, persevering towards a goal.”
“Science is very hard,” Whitehead said, “and being smart only gets you so far. Almost nothing works the first time you try it, but if you keep your eyes on the prize ... you could change the world.”

In the ongoing effort to understand the structure of the universe, the recent federal approval of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) has ensured a promising next step. According to DESI’s website, DESI “will measure the effect of dark energy on the expansion of the universe and obtain optical spectra for tens of millions of galaxies and quasars, constructing a 3-dimensional map spanning the nearby universe to 10 billion light years.” The receipt of Critical Decision-2 funding from the Department of Energy has secured funding of the project for the next ten years, allowing scientists to gather information about the nature of dark matter, dark energy, and the expansion of the universe.
Shirley Ho, Assistant Professor of Physics and a member of Carnegie Mellon’s McWilliams Center for Cosmology, is the co-chair of the project’s Galaxy and Quasar Clustering Working Group. In this capacity, Ho leads the preparation and analysis of data received from the telescope. Over two hundred researchers from around the world will work alongside Ho.
“DESI will push science further than we have ever gone before,” Ho said. “We will get a map of the universe from when the universe was very young, about one-seventh of its current age. This will help us to better understand dark matter, dark energy and other mysterious things in our universe.” Among other questions, Ho and her colleagues hope to gain a better understanding of the accelerating expansion of the universe, an observation not in line with Einstein’s theory of gravity. 
Beyond mapping the universe, DESI will provide valuable information that will allow researchers to envision baryon acoustic oscillations, which are density fluctuations in the early universe. DESI will also provide insight into the standard model of particle physics by focusing on the total mass of neutrinos in the universe.
DESI is set to be mounted on the Mayall Telescope, which is operated by the National Optical Astronomy Observatory and is located in Tucson, Arizona. In order to meet DESI’s operational requirements, the Mayall telescope will be augmented with new, intricate glass lenses that will help focus light onto DESI’s focal plane. 5,000 robotic arms will position optical fibres so that they capture light from a specific point of interest, such as a galaxy or quasar. With this sophisticated tool, researchers aim to measure spectra of over 30 million galaxies and quasars. The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, DESI’s predecessor, was only able to measure approximately one tenth as many objects.
With funding in place, the first measurements from the Mayall 4-meter telescope in Tucson, Arizona are expected to begin in 2018. Dark matter and energy are enigmatic quantities that continue to evade the understanding of modern science, but DESI is set to begin a decade of unprecedented exploration, which could hopefully lead to answers to some of our questions.

The Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation has announced that Krzysztof Matyjaszewski, J. C. Warner University Professor of Natural Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University, has won the 2015 Dreyfus Prize in the Chemical Sciences. According to  www.dreyfus.org, the Dreyfus Prize is awarded biennially and “recognizes an individual for exceptional and original research in a selected area of chemistry that has advanced the field in a major way.” This year’s topic was Making Molecules and Materials. 
While presenting the award, Henry C. Walter, President of the Dreyfus Foundation, said, “Krzysztof Matyjaszewski’s work in polymer chemistry follows in the tradition of Camille and Henry Dreyfus, who were major innovators in the field of material engineering in their day. We are proud to recognize his immense accomplishments with the Dreyfus Prize.” Since the award is presented at the winner’s institution, Matyjaszewski gave an enlightening lecture about his research during the award ceremony last Wednesday in the Mellon Institute Auditorium.
Matyjaszewski’s greatest achievements lie in the development of the Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (ATRP) process, defined by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) as “controlled reversible-deactivation radical polymerization.” In this process, the deactivation of radicals, or highly reactive molecules, involves reversible atom transfer or reversible group transfer catalyzed usually, though not exclusively, by transition-metal complexes. Matyjaszewski explained ATRP to the public as a method that uses macromolecular engineering to tame free, monomer radicals. 
Monomers are molecules that can bind together to form a polymer. Though radicals are useful in forming polymers, they are generally too reactive and short-lived to form the correct shape of polymer that researchers and industries want. The ATRP process uses specific catalysts to set active monomers into dormant states and uses a reducing agent to let the dormant radical go back to the active stage. In this way, monomers can switch between their active and dormant states and, therefore, have an extended life span.
When they were invented in 1995, ATRP methods were expensive and not nearly as efficient as they are now. Several activator regeneration ATRP methods involving different reducing agents were developed afterwards, including photoinduced ATRP. Matyjaszewski and his team contributed the most towards extending metal-free ATRP into the polymerization of acrylonitrile, which successfully advanced polymer synthesis and macromolecular engineering.
According to www.dreyfus.org, in addition to the development of ATRP, Matyjaszewski also helped transfer the ATRP process to industry, where it has “applications that include automotive coatings, adhesives, cosmetics, inkjet printing, smart and electronic materials, and many others, with an estimated commercial value exceeding $20 billion.”
In his lecture, Matyjaszewski mentioned several of his research projects, including those involving bottlebrush-structured polymers that have exactly the same topology, or geometric structure, as a regular bottlebrush, a type of shrub with cylindrical flowers. The polymers, which assist in lubricating joints, are made by creating a backbone and then attaching side chains to it.
Matyjaszewski also discussed super-soft elastomers that were made from these bottlebrushes. In order to make the material super-soft, it must be gel-like, but approximately 99 percent of water molecules that are usually contained in the gels don’t hold on to each other tightly enough. To combat this issue, the research group replaced the water molecules with polymers. They found that when they dropped an egg from a three story building onto a piece of elastomer material, the egg did not break. Matyjaszewski also mentioned one of his student’s ideas about using polymer escorted passenger-SiRNA to treat heterotopic ossification through preventative clinical therapy.
Matyjaszewski described his experience as a researcher in polymers by explaining that his research benefitted from the incorporation of his work with his imagination.
“I feel very honored and flattered to receive the Dreyfus Prize for making molecules and materials,” Matyjaszewski said in a university press release. “This recognition addresses not only contributions of my students and collaborators, but also all polymer chemists working in the area of macromolecular materials with controlled architecture and functionality for targeted applications.”

Large polymer additive makes fuel less explosive
Researchers at the California Institute of Technology have engineered a “mega-supramolecule” that can be added to flammable fuels such as gasoline or kerosene to ward off explosions in the event of an impact. During a vehicular accident, fuel droplets tend to form clouds, which linger in the air and create violent explosions when ignited. The new additive consists of a large polymer that interacts with fuel molecules. This interaction produces much larger droplets which do not linger, effectively negating the extremely dangerous fuel clouds made by smaller molecules. The new additve also breaks apart under pressure, which ensures that the additive will not clog fuel pumps.

Porous portabella mushrooms preserve cellphone batteries
It’s the marriage of the century: fungi and electronics. Researchers at the University of California, Riverside Bourns College of Engineering have turned to portabella mushrooms to present a low-cost and environmentally friendly alternative for graphite anodes in rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. The mushrooms are porous, meaning they feature a lot of small spaces through which liquid and air can pass. When applied to batteries, this structure creates more space for energy to be transferred and stored. In addition, using the mushrooms in anode fabrication could allow batteries to increase in capacity with use, rather than decrease, due to their high potassium content, which allows activation of certain dead-end pores during the battery’s use.

Baby booty bacteria found to predict asthma
Researchers working on the C.H.I.L.D. study examined stool and urine samples from over 300 babies at three months old and then again at one year. They also acquired their health information at one, three, and five years old. Upon inspection, they discovered a correlation between low or undetectable levels of four certain bacteria at three months and the development of asthma at one year old. This discovery could help speed up asthma diagnosis, but could also help identify the cause of and prevent asthma all together. This research created statistically significant results that provide clout to the hypothesis that the microbiome — the ecosystem of bacteria within our bodies — has significant effects on our health.

Placebo predicts effectiveness of real drug
Researchers at the University of Michigan’s Medical School have long been pioneers in studying the brain’s “painkilling” mu-opioid system and its response to placebo drugs. In a recent study, they showed that participants with depression who reported symptom improvement after taking a placebo showed the strongest mu-opioid response in brain regions involved in emotion and depression. These individuals were also more likely to show signs of improvement when taking the real drug than those whom the placebo did not affect. These findings are the first to show that the brain’s opiod system is involved in the body’s response to antidepressants and placebos, and could be used to develop better, faster-acting antidepressants.

Researchers search for the formula for happiness
Christian Bayer, from the Hausdorff Center for Mathematics at the University of Bonn, has established a connection between long-term increases in income and personal happiness and satisfaction. This research has shown that just having more money does not make one more content; only long-term income increases affect happiness. The findings also identified that individuals who consistently have more work are less happy. This contradicts the idea that people are more happy with any job than none at all, suggesting that it is not the lack of work, but the lack of income from which people suffer. Bayer says that “the formula for greater satisfaction in life seems to be: persistently more money while working the same number of hours.”

Researchers map reactions in muscle during exercise
Research completed at the University of Sydney’s Charles Perkins Centre provides a comprehensive blueprint of the 1,000 molecular reactions that occur in skeletal muscles during exercise. This was done by analyzing skeletal muscle from untrained, healthy males ten minutes after intense exercise. This breakthrough will allow researchers to focus their efforts and develop drugs which target not a single chemical, but multiple molecules and perhaps even entire pathways. This discovery establishes a basis for the development of drugs which can mimic the beneficial effects of exercise for patients who need the effects of exercise, but cannot exercise themselves.

How To Get Away with Murder — product of the ShondaLand powerhouse — is one of the most buzzed-about shows on television right now, and for good reason. A week before HTGAWM launched its second season on ABC, lead Viola Davis became the first black woman ever to take home the primetime Emmy for Outstanding Actress in a Drama. She took the opportunity to give a truly inspirational speech about mainstream TV's diversity problem: she quoted Harriet Tubman, acknowledged other black TV actresses who have helped pave the road forward, and drew tears from many in the audience.
There's no doubt in my mind that HTGAWM is one of the most diverse shows out there, comparable with Orange is the New Black and Sense8. To be honest, that's the main reason why I clicked on the first episode after the Emmys aired. I had no real idea what the show was about, but I'm one of those people who, upon hearing the word "diversity" applied to anything, comes running. I wasn't disappointed. In the core cast of Davis's Annalise Keating and her five law student interns, there's only one white, straight man. Interracial and queer relationships abound; the healthiest couple on the show is undoubtedly Connor and Oliver: a white, gay man and his Asian, HIV-positive boyfriend. As a matter of fact, Oliver is currently TV's only HIV-positive character.
Most other primetime shows would've hit their minority "quota" at half of HTGAWM's people of color and queer characters and patted themselves on the back. It's incredibly refreshing to watch a show that responds to accusations of playing the "political correctness game" with even more diversity. Not only are Annalise's main clients for season two an Asian and black brother-sister duo, but a scene midway through the very first episode HTGAWM casually establishes the main character as bisexual — Annalise is almost alone in this status, with the exception of Clarke from the CW's The 100. There's no warning, no fanfare, no nothing — except the sudden appearance of an ex-girlfriend, played by Famke Janssen, a.k.a. Jean Gray from X-Men. All hail Shonda Rhimes and the writing team of this show for being so blasé about media representation. Even if HTGAWM hasn't checked off every box, this show has proven that it doesn't take a spectacle to bring real-world diversity to the screen.
So, this show is diverse — but is it good? It's certainly mastered the art of pulling you in with suspense and drama. Just ask my sleep schedule two weeks ago, during which I watched the entire 15-episode first season in two sittings. After I'd depleted Netflix's supply of episodes, a brief Google search told me that the second season was starting literally the next day, so escape was more or less futile.
HTGAWM is a cross between Legally Blonde and Law & Order, plus murder. Annalise Keating is a cut-throat criminal defense attorney and law professor with a team of student interns: the "puppy" underdog Wes (Alfie Enoch, Harry Potter's Dean Thomas), master seducer Connor (Jack Falahee), yuppie legacy Asher (Matt McGorry), uptight princess Michaela (Aja Naomi King), and "the quiet one" Laurel (Karla Souza). While each episode features a "case of the week," the underlying mystery for the watcher in the first season — fleshed out by a few flashbacks or flash-forwards per episode — is how and why the interns are going to murder Annalise's cheating husband Sam.
The pacing is so tight and the acting so compelling that I found myself wondering how the show was going to continue past the first season. But when the finale killed off another important character, I realized that I'd been tricked. HTGAWM is that kind of show: the type of nail-biting, plot twist heavy, "drama for drama's sake" show that I always try to avoid because I get too invested and it hurts me.
Well, it's too late now; I'm invested. I've already streamed the first two episodes of the second season, which apply the same flashback structure to a new murder-related mystery. With How to Get Away with Murder, I came for the diversity and stayed for the drama. And I'm on a mission to drag everyone else down with me.

Last week, The Daily Show returned after a two-month hiatus to continue the “war on bullshit.” New host Trevor Noah, replacing longtime captain Jon Stewart who departed the show in August after sixteen years, acknowledged out front that he had big shoes to fill. “I can only assume this is as strange for you as it is for me,” said the South Africa native. “Jon Stewart was more than just a late-night host. He was often our voice, our refuge, and in many ways our political dad. And it’s weird, because Dad’s left, and there’s a new stepdad. And he’s black. Which is not ideal.” 
Many small details about the show have changed, including the logo and graphics, but much of it also remains the same. The format, structure, and theme song remain, as well as some familiar correspondents including Jordan Klepper and Hasan Minhaj, and the always-fantastic “Moment of Zen” to close the show. The segments are still hilarious puns, and the targetboard is familiar. The structure of the script is so similar you can almost hear Stewart doing the show in your head.
There’s no doubt, however, that this is a different show, and that’s felt in Noah. 
He’s got an incredibly charming smile that stretches from ear to ear, and it combined with his demeanor presents an image of a boy shoved into the spotlight; he wouldn’t want to be anywhere else, but at the same time can’t wait for it to be over. There’s a certain sense of discomfort in the first few episodes, and Noah handles some elements of the show as if he’s not quite comfortable in his surroundings. 
For example, his interview with New Jersey Governor Chris Christie on last Wednesday’s episode felt too much like a stump for the Republican presidential candidate to shout from, compared to what fans expect from The Daily Show. The topic focused on Christie’s plan to implement a thumbprint system to document and control immigration, and where Stewart would’ve certainly had a few opinions of his own on the issue, Noah stood back, smiled politely, and asked questions that gave Christie control. Hopefully Noah grows comfortable enough in his new role to treat his guests with a little bit less than perfect hospitality. 
With Jon Stewart’s departure and Stephen Colbert’s recent move as David Letterman’s replacement on The Late Show, it appears that Comedy Central’s late night programming has entered a new era. Stewart and Colbert established themselves as the smart alecks throwing spitballs in the back of the room, an intelligent alternative to the big network late night shows that vanilla up their jokes to appeal to a wide audience (an establishment Colbert has now joined). Now, The Daily Show with Trevor Noah and its timeslot chaser The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore, essentially have to start over again. Hopefully as the writing staff grows more familiar with their new host, Noah will stop feeling like a replacement stepdad and become more like the dad Stewart was. Because the war on bullshit must continue, or else we’ll become lost in a sea of fear-mongering and politicians will go without hilarious nicknames. We can’t have that.
The Daily Show airs weeknights on Comedy Central at 11 p.m. Episodes are posted on cc.com the next day for free.

Marvel President Kevin Feige comments on superhero films
Marvel President Kevin Feige is a special kind of movie producer. Producers know how to talk to the press, what to say, what not to say, and when to say it. They know which actors to talk to, who their agents are, how much to pay them, how long to pay them for, what the costume should look like and where the story should go. So what makes Feige different? Most producers are not recognized by name. Marvel fans know who Kevin Feige is and understand the Marvel Cinematic Universe was born and raised inside his head. We're now twelve films deep in the Marvel Comic Universe (MCU), and Feige is still revealing his thoughts in spectacular fashion.
In an interview with IGN, Feige spoke to comments made about superhero films (that they would soon go by the way of the Western) and the future of the MCU. Feige said: " ... the Western lasted 40-50 years, and they still pop up occasionally. It's been, what, eight years since Iron Man 1, if we count that, which I do, as the beginning of our MCU? Maybe [the superhero genre] will only last another 42 years."
He added: " ... I still believe the same thing, which is as long as the ones that we can control are as good as they can be, that's all that I care about. I think we've been doing pretty well. I'm very confident in the films we've announced that we have coming forward that they're going to be surprising and different and unique. I've said a lot: I don't believe in the comic book genre. I don't believe in the superhero genre. I believe that each of our films can be very different."
Feige's comments make perfect sense when we take a look back into history. For example, Feige hired director James Gunn to spearhead 2014's summer hit Guardians of the Galaxy. Gunn had previously directed two feature films: Slither and Super. Feige has repeated how his decision to hire Gunn was obvious. He continuously looks for the best storytellers, regardless of the "superhero" stereotype. He looks for unique ways to best tell these stories and has been, on the whole, a success.
Is Vin Diesel directing Furious 8?
Vin Diesel is, without question, one of the busiest actors in the game right now. With The Last Witch Hunter getting its release soon, Diesel is also lined up for xXx: The Return of Xander Cage, director Ang Lee's Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk, Guardians of the Galaxy 2, and, of course, Furious 8. Furious 7's director James Wan is busy with The Conjuring 2: The Enfield Poltergeist, and Fast and Furious 3-6 director Justin Lin is busy with Star Trek Beyond, so the Fast and Furious franchise is, once again, attempting to bring the family back together. Diesel and Lin have been meeting with Universal Studios discussing directors and Rob Cohen (The Fast and the Furious) has been mentioned in a number of reports, though other reports count him out. 
What other name has been mentioned? Diesel himself. He took to his Facebook page to make some interesting comments: "I will share something crazy that my mother said six months ago after the studio had me announce the date for 8 to the world … 'Either you direct 8 yourself … or don’t do it.' Some of you vinbook pioneers are all too familiar with my mother’s wisdom, as I have posted her sayings in the past on Our page … but I wrote it off as just a mother’s love and belief in me, though she has seen first hand what I’ve done to make these movies defy expectations and become increasingly successful, even when the studio thought I was crazy."
Diesel has a deep emotional — and professional — interest in the franchise, and has been fighting to keep it alive and kicking. A producer on each film since the fourth installment, Diesel is rightfully involved in all director talks and understands the franchise more than virtually anyone. Whether or not he holds the other essential tools of a director isn't clear, but his passion for the success of Furious 8 and beyond makes him an obvious consideration to sit in the chair.
Kingsman sequel could hit a speed bump 
Kingsman: The Secret Service was a success on a variety of levels, but one in particular could put the inevitable sequel in trouble: the blastoff of Taron Egerton's career. Since starring as Eggsy, the actor was snatched up to star in Lionsgate's Robin Hood: Origins. With Lionsgate putting the film on the fast track, Egerton's two-film contract for Kingsman may put his role in jeopardy. Both films are set for an early 2016 production schedule and Egerton's role in Kingsman could knock him off Robin Hood: Origins. I'd obviously love to see him back as Eggsy, but Robin Hood: Origins seems like it could be interesting as well. Hopefully Hollywood throws the young actor a bone, and he can find his role in both films.
Egerton can be seen as Teddy Smith in the upcoming gangster-drama Legend starring Tom Hardy and Emily Browning.

Hi, Josh!
My parents don't love me any more. I'm from Arizona, but I have been living out here in Pittsburgh since I started college (I'm a sophomore, by the way). I went home this week to surprise my parents for their anniversary, and when I got to my house, I found that nobody was home and all of the locks had been changed, so I waited outside for my parents to get home. When a car pulled into the driveway, I ran up to greet my parents, but the people who stepped out of the car weren't them. They were an older couple. I explained that this was my house, and they just laughed and told me that they were renting from my parents. They let me in to see the house, and the couple told me that my parents had turned my bedroom into a sewing room and clutter repository. Long story short, my parents are living in Vermont during the fall and renting the house out until I come home for Christmas, and they didn't tell me, and they messed up my room, and they hid all of my stuff in the basement under a pile of old quilts, and they're acting like what we had in that house didn't mean anything to them. Those walls have seen some stuff, Josh. 
The Rodriguezes don't know the history; they don't know about the time I wrote emotional song lyrics above my bed with permanent marker when I was going through my scene phase. They just sew their charity blankets for the under-privileged elderly in ignorance.
Tl;dr, how do I get my parents to let me into their lives and tell me things and love me again?
Signed,
Sorely Alienated Daughter,
Staunchly Anti-Change Kid
Dear SAD SACK,
I'm sorry your parents didn't tell you that they were renting out the house, but maybe they didn't tell you because they thought you'd be upset. The fact that they come back for Christmas is evidence of their love for you (and the bone-chilling, icy horror characteristic of New England winters). It's not that they don't love you, but maybe that they're free to relocate for a few months while you're busy at school. I'm sure that your parents didn't mean any harm in keeping the Rodriguezes' existence from you. I've also struggled with the change of my old room into a guest room, but that's just the natural progression of life after a kid goes off to college. In my opinion, you should call your parents and talk through this with them — I'm sure that will settle the issue and put your mind at ease.
Sincerely, 
Joshua Brown.

For a sci-fi movie about a lone survivor on a desert planet, The Martian is a decidedly atypical movie for director Ridley Scott. One of the original sci-fi auteurs, Scott’s greatest works, such as Alien and Blade Runner are bleak, dystopian meditations on the fragility of humanity against the uncertain backdrop of the future. With The Martian, Scott swings the opposite way — this is utopian storytelling. The Martian is a celebration of human ingenuity and unwavering determination in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.
In the near future, a manned mission to Mars is prematurely terminated when a massive dust storm hits the mission base. In the confusion of the moment, one of the crew, Mark Watney (played by Matt Damon) is injured and presumed dead. Watney awakes, stranded on desolate Mars all by himself, after the rest of his crew have blasted off into space on their return voyage. He must figure out how to make contact with NASA, and how to make his supplies, meant to last weeks, last him years. As Watney remarks, he needs to "science the shit out of this" if he has any hope of surviving.
For a movie with a theme best described as "Robinson Crusoe meets Apollo 13," The Martian is unexpectedly upbeat. Scott never lets his audience lose track of the gravity of the situation; yet he infuses his settings with subtle humor at just the right moments that present Watney not as a tortured soul, but as someone in on the wry joke of just how much trouble he’s in. Watney is an idealized symbol of perseverance and ingenuity: He refuses to give in, and somehow, by hook or crook, always manages to find a way. He recycles his own waste to fertilize potatoes, burns rocket fuel to create water, and in general manages to get by until the next inevitable disaster (Martian frost, chemical explosions) upends his plans.
Matt Damon as Watney is nigh perfect. He carries the entire first half of the film by himself. Giving his best performance since Scorses’s The Departed, Damon loses himself in Mark Watney, fluidly switching from fear to anguish, from loneliness to determination, and eventually joy. He makes Watney's emotional highs and lows relatable in a scenario that none of us have ever been in. The rest of the cast — an A-list cast if there ever was one — including Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Sean Bean, and Kate Mara — work well together as a foil to Damon’s solitude. Besides Damon, Jessica Chastain deserves special mention for the poignancy she brings as the mission commander who makes the difficult decision to leave Mark Watney behind and must live with the decision when she learns that he is still alive.
Most interestingly, The Martian works as a paean to NASA and space exploration. This is particularly ironic when one considers that the movie is about a mission in space gone horribly wrong. The guys at NASA on Earth, and Watney on Mars react exemplarily — innovative and bold, they bend technology and nature to their will to get Watney back. The scenes on Earth could so easily have devolved into a bunch of brains spouting pseudo-scientific jargon without any soul, or into heavy handed Armageddon-style trite heroics that cater to the lowest common denominator audience. 
Instead, they manage to straddle a fine line between seeming scientifically accurate and asking really big human questions of the cast and the audience. How much should the returning crew know about Watney’s condition? On the one hand, they deserve to know that he is alive; on the other, the last thing a crew needs is the emotional distress of knowing that they inadvertently marooned one of their own — especially since they still have to get back to Earth, in a situation where the smallest mistake can cost everyone their lives. Should the head of NASA, played by Jeff Daniels, authorize an emergency mission with a low probability of success to return to Mars in an attempt to save Watney?
The Martian isn't perfect, but it is undoubtedly a triumph. The story is a bit too linear, everyone is a bit too well-intentioned, and the optimism and constant wisecracking is a bit too unrealistic considering the circumstances. And yet, from the sound design to the visuals to watching the problem-solving unfold, everything just seems to work. Every soaring aerial shot of the desolate Martian landscape is complemented by the intimate landscape of a face. The movie manages to strike this incredibly delicate balance between cold hard logic and raw emotion — kind of like space exploration itself, right?

Sure, barbecues are fun and snow cones are delicious, but the best season for food is definitely autumn. It's easy to feel a little down when the days become cold and rainy, and when every time you come home you have to throw your socks in the dryer, but a bad day can quickly become a good one with delicious food. Here are a few easy recipes to include in a warm meal filled with comfort food, fit for a miserable, homework-filled day.
I love soup more than I love people. Most of the time. Soup is often easy to make and it can last you a while. I fell in love with this soup after eating a variation of it at Eat Unique once last fall. While the first few times were only okay, I eventually mastered this recipe and now make it as often as I can. 
Pumpkin Pear Bisque
2 leeks, sliced
1 sweet onion, chopped
2 tbsp butter
3 tbsp flour
4 c chicken broth
15 oz. pumpkin (in can)
2 tsp vanilla extract
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper
1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
3 canned pear halves
1 c pear syrup, from can
1/2 c light cream
Lula's additions: 2 fresh pears, 3/4 c sugar, 1 qt apple cider
I originally found this recipe on Food.com, but I do make some alterations to the ingredients above. I'm a little more generous with salt and pepper, and I'm more conservative with the nutmeg — especially after a nutmeg overload, which was not delicious. I also use fresh pears, because I feel like they'd be tastier. I try to buy them as ripe as I can find. While this leads to no pear syrup, I poach the pears in apple cider to give them a bit of an extra fall flair. Then I use a little apple cider, a half cup or so, as the "pear syrup." 
First, melt the butter with the leeks and onions in a big saucepan. When they are nearly cooked, add the flour for just a minute or so, and then add all the chicken broth. Cook on medium heat for a while, until the broth begins to boil. Add in the pumpkin, vanilla, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. When the soup begins to boil again, turn down the heat and cover for about 20 minutes. While it is simmering, poach the pears. This means dissolving the sugar into the apple cider in the pan, adding the pears — I do three to four halves — and then cooking at a low boil for about 20 minutes as well. Since this is the same amount of time as the soup itself, it is good to already have the sugar and apple cider heating on a back burner. 
When the pears are tender, transfer them to the soup. I also add about half a cup of the apple cider. It is easiest to blend the soup if you own a hand blender, but you can also put it in a food processor or blender in four different batches. After it is blended to a smooth consistency, add the cream and a little more vanilla, as well as more salt and pepper if desired.
Enjoy your soup! This recipe can feed generous portions to around four people, so invite your friends over and feel less alone.
Fall is also apple season, one of the best fruits to grace the earth. While this dessert tastes best after you make it after a long day of apple picking, you can also make it using store bought apples. Apple crumble is one of the best things to make, because it is really, really difficult to mess up. Crumble of any consistency tastes great, and the more butter used, the tastier it seems. So while I give measurements here, most of the time I just mush it around until it feels right, and I have yet to be disappointed.
Apple Crumble
5-7 apples, depending on apple size
1 1/4 c oatmeal
1 c flour
8 tbsp butter
1 1/2 tsp cinnamon
1 lemon, juice
1/2 c packed brown sugar
1/4 c white sugar
2 tbsp flour (additional)
pinch of salt
(modified from foodnetwork.com)
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. The first task after that is the most boring: peeling and chopping the apples. Try to have a vegetable peeler on hand; it is so much easier than a knife. Put the apples in 9x13 baking dish; Pyrex is by far the best. Toss the apples with the white sugar, 1/2 teaspoon of the cinnamon, the juice from the lemon, and the flour. Put the wonderful smelling apple compote aside.
In another bowl, mix the butter, one cup flour, oatmeal, brown sugar, one teaspoon cinnamon, and pinch of salt. It is most effective if the butter is thoroughly thawed, and if you use your fingers. When the mixture is the consistency you desire — reminder: it will be delicious regardless — sprinkle or spread it on top of the apple mixture. Pop the tray in the oven for about 45 minutes, or until it is bubbly and sweet-smelling. Serve with vanilla ice cream if you so desire.
With these two recipes, hopefully you can improve a chilly fall day. Other fun recipes to join your soup and apple dessert might be gooey homemade mac & cheese, kale and white bean ragout, and maybe freshly baked banana bread.

When I turned nine years old, I made my first bucket list. I proudly told my mom, rattling off the random assortment of places I would inevitably visit: Africa, Italy, Spain, and that big waterfall in Canada. At that point, I don’t think she realized she was raising a daughter who would save every paycheck for future trips. Now, she uses the anecdote to justify my absences during winter and summer break when I should be at home and am instead “gallivanting around the globe” — her words, not mine. 
The summer after my sophomore year of high school, my best friend, and I made a summer bucket list filled with exciting adventures for 15 year olds. We checked off activities like 3 a.m. trips to donut shops, beach bonfires, and sleeping under the stars. If you know me, you know I like lists. I make to-do lists, grocery lists, lists that categorize how and what I need to study when preparing for exams. I’ve always considered bucket lists a great way to establish my goals and capitalize on the opportunities presented to me. They can help turn potentially mundane summer days into a memorable day at the beach, for all my fellow Californians out there.
Before leaving for my semester abroad in Chile almost three months ago, I obviously made a pre-departure bucket list. It included a random assortment of things:
After dinner one night at my host family’s house, I had a long conversation with my host dad. He listened to me stumble my way through a conversation in Spanish about family dynamic, travel, and recent political history of Chile; I told him about my life and about my recent adventures. At the end of the conversation, he told me “estás buscando algo” meaning “you are looking for something.” I think he is right. More than looking for experiences to check off a bucket list, I’m looking for answers to big questions. I’m looking to be challenged. I’m looking for international experience that will inevitably change the way I think about and approach situations.
I realize how so incredibly lucky I am to have the opportunity to travel as much as I do. I come from a financially stable background and have the distinct privilege of being able to dedicate a majority of the money I make to my travel fund. Additionally, my amazing mother supports and encourages me each time I tell her about volunteering in Central America or visiting Europe instead of spending Christmas at home. To anyone who has the opportunity and is considering study abroad: Do it. Travel. Explore. Leave your bubble. Push the limits of your comfort zone. You don’t have to leave Pittsburgh to experience something new that challenges the way you think, but I truly believe that there is something so unique to being in a foreign, unknown place for an extended period of time as a young person. For me, Chile was the perfect place to spend my study abroad. I want conversations that address shortcomings of political figures and about how the world reacts to human rights abuses. I want to be surrounded by politically active young people who speak out, go on strike, and question authority. 
Despite being one of those obnoxious list-lovers, it goes without saying that the moments that are completely unplanned and unexpected can be some of the best. Yesterday, I met up with a few friends for ice cream — at one of the world’s top 25 ice cream parlors. If that isn’t enough of a reason to visit Chile, what is? We sat in a plaza in silence; eating our ice cream and watching people pass by. A group of young travelers suddenly started playing in a giant drum circle and drew in a crowd. People were dancing and tapping their feet along to the beat. It was the epitome of Valparaíso in front of me: a city of music, passion, travel, accompanied by public buses and skateboarders in the background. On the way home that evening, I took a public bus, which quickly filled up with people. With loud music overhead, the bus driver took turns alarmingly fast, sending me careening into those around me. As I stood, squished in the aisle between an older man and some teenage boys, I looked down at the peaceful young family in front of me. The little baby boy was asleep in his dad’s arms, and his mom was drifting in and out of sleep, leaning on her partner’s shoulder. In this crazy world, they found peace. As the bus climbed Valparaíso’s hills, I stood there with a goofy smile on my face, happy that I chose to study in this country, during this semester, and happened to get on this bus.

I’m of the firm belief that a solid offering of snacks has the potential to elevate an awkward red Solo cup “rager” to a nice cozy evening with friends. That’s why when I throw a party, I like to put out some noms. It shows friends that you care about their experience in your home, and it’s always good to put food in the tummies of the people who hold the fate of your furniture in their hands.
An assortment of dips is a really great way to feed guests. It’s more effort than simply putting out a few bags of chips, but it’s way more delicious. A simple Pinterest search is enough to show you the mouth-watering range of dips out there, from savory to sweet, from a simple three-ingredient delight to a complicated layered delicacy, depending on your budget and time constraints. 
But with these three dips that I made for my birthday party, I didn’t have to spend that much money and I pulled them all together in the hour before the party began. They were super delicious and very easy! I opted for all savory because that’s what I like to eat, and it was my party. It was also great that all of them were served with tortilla chips, so that made life simple. 
The first is an avocado dip that’s actually not guacamole. It’s a creamier spin on the universally adored classic. By adding cream cheese and sour cream, it fluffs up the dip and gives it a deeper flavor. Plus that’s volume that doesn’t come from avocados, and that equals money saved! Unfortunately the avocados that I bought were horrifically underripe, so I have faith that this recipe will yield something better than what I made.
Avocado Party Dip
8 ounces of cream cheese
8 ounces of sour cream
½ teaspoon of garlic salt
1 ripe large avocado or 2 small ones, pitted and peeled
¼ cup of chopped red onion
1 tablespoon of lemon or lime juice
This recipe is much easier if you have an electric mixer, which I do thanks to my beautiful grandmother. If you don’t, I’m so sorry because the first step, creaming the cream cheese, requires serious shoulder and tricep muscles to do by hand. Follow that up by mixing in the sour cream and garlic powder and don’t stop until it’s fluffy. Then beat in the avocado until it’s combined with the creamy love pillow. Finally, hand stir the onions and lime juice. I personally chose to stir in a couple teaspoons of salt, too, but you can do that to taste.
Cheesy Beer Dip
12 ounces of beer
8 ounces of cream cheese
1 cup of shredded cheddar
Buzzfeed recommended using Corona, but I happened to already have some really high quality month old Keystone Light on hand. The dip still turned out delicious in spite of it. Start by bringing the beer to a simmer over medium heat in a small sauce pan. It will get really fun and foamy, and that’s how you know it’s time to add the cream cheese. The best way to go about this is to soften the cream cheese beforehand, and cut it up into chunks so that it melts smoothly. Once that’s melted and mixed up, pour in the cheddar and stir until it’s a dip. If you’re feeling fancy, which I was not, a sprinkling of chopped green onions would be a delicious finishing touch.
The only small issue with this one is that it’s not ideal for leaving out on a table all night. It’s so delicious hot, but so weird and congealed after two hours. Either serve it immediately, serve it in a crock pot, or periodically microwave it.
Best for last… Fiesta Ranch Dip
1 packet of Hidden Valley ranch seasoning mix
16 ounces of sour cream
10 ounce can of Rotel original (tomatoes and green chiles)
11 ounce can of corn (I used a can that had a mix of yellow and sweet corn)
¾ cup of shredded cheese
Pour everything in a bowl and stir! It’s literally as easy as that, adding to my sincere love for this dip. It was also the first one to completely disappear, much to my despair. I need to add that I could truly eat this for breakfast, lunch, mid-afternoon snack, dinner, and late-night snack until my digestive system fails. It was to die for in every way. The mixture of the ranch seasoning with the acidity of the tomatoes, the sweetness of the corn and general perfection of cheddar hit all my sweet spots. The only thing that could have made it better was maybe some ground beef, which I will likely try as early as tonight because the craving is overwhelming.
I also ended up adding a box of Oreos to the mix, just in case any guests came with a sweet tooth. The whole spread made the evening so much nicer than it could have been without, and everyone who came did express their appreciation. Seeing friends leave happy is a beautiful birthday gift in itself.

Named after Andrew Carnegie — or Andy Warhol, or both, it’s never been made quite clear — Andy’s Wine Bar in downtown Pittsburgh is a bar with a modern, cosmopolitan aesthetic, located in the lobby of the Fairmont Pittsburgh on Market Street.
Featuring dark countertops with gold shavings, retro lounge chairs, and window-side two-tops with tall royal blue swivel seats, Andy’s radiates “swank” in every inch of its decor. Wednesday to Saturday nights, a live jazz band performs in the bar, for an extra touch of class. “Jazz at Andy’s” is open to the public and free of charge, and features local jazz performers such as Dane Vannatter, Tania Grubbs, and Trudy Holler. The band is right there in the lobby at ground level, and you can literally sit right beside the performers as they are performing. The intimate setting is ideal for anyone who is a fan of jazz, and the lobby of the hotel offers wonderful acoustics for pleasurable listening. However, if you are completely uncultured like me and know next to nothing about jazz, the bar also offers other treats as well, namely lots of alcohol.
Despite being marketed as a wine bar, wine is hardly the main selling point at Andy’s; the wine menu is relatively limited and what is available seems somewhat overpriced. However, the bar does offer a mix of interesting cocktails which start at $9 and up, and includes some interesting items such as the Thai Vesper, which is a Beefeater 24 gin with coconut Lilette Blanc, the Bacon Shrub, a bacon infused Maker's Mark, and a seasonal warm spiced wine, a cinnamon and orange cabarnet with butternut puree. 
I got the Peach Ancho Mojito made with Mount Gay rum, while my friend ordered the Meal Undone, a Belvedere vodka infused with ginger. The cocktails are flavorful and punchy, and the menu seems to change up often, so there should be some new concoctions to try within a few weeks or so. What’s more, each order of drink comes with a colorful little Warhol-style coaster that has the face of Andrew Carnegie on one side. The quest to collect free stuff with Andrew Carnegie’s face on it is never complete.
The food menu also contains some interesting items. It includes small appetizers and desserts such as pierogies, cheeses, and espresso ice cream, as well as some burgers, sliders, and salads. I ordered some very nice lamb sliders, which came with feta cheese, beets, and Tahini sauce. However, in general the appetizers and desserts seem to be somewhat more inventive and exciting than the entrees, so I would stick with those. The food service was also pretty slow; I waited over 25 minutes for my sliders at a time when the bar was only about half full.
Unfortunately, the offerings at Andy’s do run a bit pricey, especially for a broke college student. It’s perhaps for this reason, and the fact that it is located downtown, that the crowd at Andy’s seems to be mostly over 30. During the early evening, there are a number of working professionals in suits and ties leaving work to get a drink, and those are about the youngest people you will find there throughout the night. It can be charming to see a couple or two waltzing around in an open space while the jazz band plays in the background every now and then, but the sheer number of the older patrons after 10 p.m. or so can make a 20-something feel rather out of place.
Still, if you don’t mind hanging around with people who may be your parent’s age, or if you’re a fan of jazz or fine cocktails, Andy’s is a nice place to relax after a long week, especially before the bar becomes too full. It has a wonderful, classy ambiance and is located in a beautiful area of downtown with many good restaurants nearby, such as Meat & Potatoes and Primanti Brothers. Also, if the cocktails run a bit expensive, there are also a selection of beers that can go for around $2 during Happy Hour times. Their October Performance Schedule is posted on their website, for anyone interested in seeing local performers.

On Thursday, The Tartan was given a behind-the-scenes tour of the Jared L. Cohon University Center expansion construction site. Set to open in May of 2016, the new portion of the building will include a state-of-the-art performance theater, a high-security athletic facility, and perhaps most notable of all, a focal point for the Forbes entrance to the university.
The base project, costing about $22 million, is a result of years of careful planning, fundraising, and an effort to expand the athletics program at Carnegie Mellon, according to Adam Homer, the campus design and facility development project manager for the CUC expansion, who led portions of the tour. The tour was focused on the athletic facilities, the theater, the campus entry point, and the third floor space.
Athletic Facilities
Assistant Director of Athletics, Recreational Programming Sara Gauntner was also present during the tour, and emphasized how long-awaited the improved athletic facilities are. “We’ve tried to plan out a one-stop-shop for athletic needs on campus,” she said, acknowledging that between Skibo Gymnasium and the CUC weight rooms, the current facilities are not meeting the existing needs.
The Forbes-facing portion of the first floor will offer strength training with heavy weights, similar to the weight room in Skibo Gym. One side of the room will cater to heavy lifters, while the other will allow for lighter, less strenuous weightlifting. Paneled by glass walls and six skylights, the first floor will fully utilize natural light for the convenience of the users. Further back, students will have access to 180 new rental lockers, two unisex family changing rooms, spacious male and female locker rooms, and private showers. On the second floor, there are four multipurpose rooms designated for various fitness classes, in addition to a cycling room, and, overlooking the weight room, a cardio-machine space that has a wall of windows looking out to Forbes. Swimmers will also have larger team rooms and physical education instructors will now have classrooms in which to teach.
Director of Student Activities Liz Vaughan said that the flexibility of the spaces was a priority during the expansion planning process. “With more spaces, we can offer more classes. [Students] will be able to find the class that they want to take at a time that is convenient for them.”
The spine of the athletic center will run from the reception desk to the back wall of the building. For security purposes, access to all facilities will require students to swipe their Carnegie Mellon ID, similar to the turnstiles near the pool and current locker rooms.
The CUC expansion is part of a three-phase plan to re-imagine athletics and recreation at Carnegie Mellon, Gauntner said. “I’ve been lucky to be around for two of the three phases during my time here.” The next part, she said, involves slowly shutting down Skibo Gymnasium and repurposing the space.
Performance Theater
The first floor’s key attraction is the studio theater. The theater was built to serve the needs of the many student groups on campus, and as such, has a variety of specifications that will allow it to suit these needs. The floor of the theater will be fitted with heavy-sprung padding to protect the dancers who will use it, from Bhangra to Dancer’s Symposium. The wall of mirrors on one side of the theater is also geared toward making rehearsals easier for such groups.
The acoustic properties of the theater will make it ideal for musical groups, such as the All University Orchestra or the Kiltie Band, to practice. The walls are insulated with six inches of foam for maximum noise canceling, as well as multiple layers of thicker drywall and space between the layers that will make the room virtually soundproof, according to Homer.
The theater offers many options for the staging and direction of productions, so that sets can be positioned in virtually any way. Telescopic seating for 140 can be pulled out from the wall as far as the groups need it to be, or groups will also be able to take chairs from the roomy storage areas surrounding the theater to create an in-the-round theater experience, said Vaughan.
A balcony with extension cables allows performance technology to be set up from any angle, and sets that are constructed in the theater can be stored in the rooms on the other side of the walls. A green room will serve as a changing area for dancers or performers, which Vaughan says will make performing in this theater easier than performing in the current CUC facilities and eliminate the need for performers and patrons  to share bathrooms.
Campus entry point
According to Mandi Semple, director of marketing for student affairs operations, the main entrance to the CUC expansion will face Forbes, and finally offer a real “front” of campus. The CUC expansion project and the new Tepper Quadrangle will both play into the idea of changing the way that the university interacts with Forbes Avenue, according to Vaughan, as well as acting as a stronger entry point for visitors. “We all saw people walk out of the old parking garage and looking around and getting lost because it was so unclear where they were supposed to go. Now, they will walk down a sidewalk and walk right into the new expansion.”
Once inside, visitors will be greeted by a large lobby meant to function similarly to the CUC’s current black chairs common space. An alumni-donated Dale Chihuly sculpture will hang overhead against a large, two-floor mural behind the main staircase. The designers have planned to create rain gardens outside, which will complement the 62,000 square feet of the building’s glass and zinc exterior and will also serve to separate the building from the noise and traffic on Forbes Avenue.
Third floor
As many community members will remember, the design of the CUC yielded an extra 4,559 square feet of space that was dubbed the “shell space” last year. Purchased by the Undergraduate Student Senate and the Graduate Student Assembly (GSA), the space is divided and designated into 3,025 square feet and 1,534 square feet zones for each group, respectively. The rooms will serve as collaborative space for both bodies of students. According to Vaughan, the rooms will have plenty of power outlets, whiteboards, and tables. 
This Wednesday, Oct. 7, examples of the tentative furniture selections for both these spaces and the lobby will be available for students to try and talk about in the Kirr Commons in the CUC. The design team and the Carnegie Mellon project coordinators would like to hear furnishing options and design details that best cater to the student body.
The CUC expansion is just one part of a larger effort on behalf of the Carnegie Mellon administration to face-lift the campus and meet the ever-changing demand of students. According to Vaughan, tours of the facility will continue to be offered to a variety of groups over the next few months, particularly the groups of students who have the greatest stake in the new facilities.

Carnegie Mellon University President Subra Suresh took center stage last Wednesday at a town hall event to address questions and concerns from the Carnegie Mellon community. A crowd of mostly faculty and administrative staff gathered in McConomy Auditorium to hear Suresh’s ideas about the future of the university, its costs, academics, and culture.
Carnegie Mellon’s Vice President of Communications and Marketing Steve Kloehn guided the discussion, and select faculty, staff, and students were asked to share their questions. Kloehn also included questions which had been previously submitted online.
M. Shernell Smith, the assistant director of student affairs, posed the first question: “How do you see staff engagement as a part of the transformative CMU experience? And what do you say to those staff members who don’t always feel like they are at the table for some of those particular dialogues?” she asked.
Suresh named his strategic plan initiative, town hall meetings, email solicitations, and more as ways that his administration has engaged the Carnegie Mellon community. Suresh said he’s been pleased with the community’s “unprecedented strategic planning,” and suggested that he wants his strategic plan to be a thoroughly dynamic and collaborative project.
When a computer science student asked online whether there was a downside to the Computer Science department’s growing number of corporate partnerships, Suresh responded reassuringly. For Suresh, companies like Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft want to have close relationships with the School of Computer Science because of the student and faculty’s work. He cited Tata Consultancy Service’s recent $35 million donation to Carnegie Mellon as an example of this support for student’s work.
Since the Computer Science student’s question was concerned with how certain partnerships could alienate competing companies, Suresh gave a prime example of Carnegie Mellon’s more neutral positioning. “We don’t take sides,” he explained. “We even work with UPMC and Highmark. If you can do that, you can do anything...  There is nothing in these partnerships that conveys exclusivity.”
Sophomore international relations and politics and policy and management double major and Dietrich College senator Michael Gormley said that he felt “disassociated” from Carnegie Mellon’s smaller campuses in Qatar and Rwanda. Suresh noted that since the Pittsburgh campus is vastly larger than its international campuses, the size disparity challenges the process of building bridges between the communities.
Suresh did mention the University’s IMPAQT program, which connects Pittsburgh students to Qatar students with annual trips to the different campuses. Student groups like Project Rwanda also reach out and engage with the other campuses, he said.
On a heavier note, one submitted question addressed the campus sexual assault crisis. Suresh applauded the work of Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno as well as the Sexual Violence Prevention Program enacted last year in combating this issue faced by campuses nationwide.
Suresh acknowledged that campus sexual assault is a “complex, national issue we need to address as a community. Everyone in the community has a role to play, including bystanders.” He mentioned that upcoming roundtables and new programs this year will continue to address the pressing matter.
Ömer Akin, professor of architecture, questioned whether the university truly sustains its commitment to creativity. Akin expressed concern for flagging support of the College of Fine Arts and Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, two colleges which Akin believes to be centers of creativity on campus.
Suresh confirmed that his strategic plan will foster and support creativity on campus. He mentioned that both schools were recently awarded $1 million “challenge grants” last year. “Use this to support your faculty and we would like to see how you can grow this,” he told the schools. “I’ll be coming back to see how they’ve grown it before too long.” Suresh also believes that the Digital Humanities program should also promote Dietrich.
Suresh still believes that both schools need to provide a clearer idea of what they will add to the Forbes Corridor, which he hopes will be the premier hub of creativity and innovation between Silicon Valley and the East Coast. “Is it backed by reality? Is it backed by data? Yes,” he affirmed.
An undergraduate student posed a question concerning race, asking how can Carnegie Mellon better embrace the evolving definition of diversity. President Suresh promised dedication to this challenge. “We will do everything possible to attract a diversity of student and faculty cohorts,” he said.
He used this year’s undergraduate freshman class as an example of increasing diversity. Although Western Pennsylvania is not known for attracting the most diverse of people, he feels confident that Carnegie Mellon has the resources to attract people of all backgrounds.
Again concerning Carnegie Mellon’s diverse student body, a graduate student expressed frustration over the complicated visa process that international graduate students face in the U.S. Suresh, who was once an international graduate student himself, felt that Carnegie Mellon needs to find sustainable ways to support international students who must deal with visa policies, family issues, and homesickness.
In the past, Suresh has advocated in front of Congress for an easier visa application process. Although Carnegie Mellon has little influence with the State Department regarding visas, the school has helped in cases regarding Ph.D. candidates.
Kloehn then announced that they had received numerous questions online regarding tuition costs. President Suresh framed the dire state of rising tuition costs as “the cost of education versus the investment in education.” He compared Carnegie Mellon’s slower rates of rising tuition to those of other colleges.
Since May 2014, Carnegie Mellon’s endowment has grown significantly. While Carnegie Mellon’s endowment barely stacks up to peer institutions’ endowments, he said, the school still manages to compete on a high level. However, he still stressed the need to establish a “permanent mechanism to continue to help our students.”
Lastly, Suresh discussed how technology will impact higher education in the years to come. He does believe that online learning will disrupt universities’ financial models, yet still sees students wanting and needing to be physically present on campuses.
Suresh will host his next town hall in the spring.

Jane Austen has been part of the literary canon for centuries. Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, Emma, and Persuasion, to name a few, are novels that lived long past their production in the 1800s and continue to garner a widespread fan base that still reads and glorifies these novels to this very day. 
“Janeites”, as her more devoted fans are called, can be found in many parts of the world, reading, analyzing, and imagining the works of Ms. Austen.
Last Thursday, Associate Professor of English at the University of Texas at Austin Janine Barchas, a Janeite herself, gave a talk as part of the CAS Speaker Series on her use of modern technology that allows users to travel back to 1813 and take a step into the life of Jane Austen.
“What Jane Saw” is an online digital gallery that allows viewers to observe a room-by-room deconstruction of Sir Joshua Reynolds’ paintings that Austen visited on May 24, 1813 at 52 Pall Mall in London. Barchas began her talk by providing some background on her fascination with this particular moment in the life of Jane Austen.
Janine Barchas is the author of Matters of Fact in Jane Austen, a novel that focuses on the celebrity culture of Ms. Austen. During her research, she came across a letter Austen wrote to her sister, Cassandra, about the museum exhibitions she visited on May 24, 1813. 
The letters describe her quest to search for portrait representations of her Pride and Prejudice characters in Sir Reynolds’ paintings. In the letter, she describes her success at finding a painting that looked like Mrs. Bingley but her inability to hunt down one that resembled Mrs. Darcy.
“This was my smoke and gun.… She’s looking for Mrs. Darcy and Mrs. Bingley,” Barchas said, reliving the feeling of excitement she had felt upon finding this tidbit of information. Austen was born into modest beginnings and did not interact with the social elite of her time. Reynolds’ paintings represented these same elite celebrities, and Austen, through examining his works, was able to immerse herself in British celebrity culture.
And so the task to recreate the exhibit began. Barchas, with help from her programming, art, and design students at the University of Texas at Austin, underwent the task of turning her ideas into reality — well, virtual reality. 
They underwent the meticulous task of determining the exact layout of the pictures, finding the perfect layer of colors that would help date the images, and figuring out the perfect lighting. The website was created with the use of Google SketchUp.
Barchas talks about other similar digital heritage projects that were also released around the same time as “What Jane Saw.” One of these was the Chicago Art Institute’s celebration of the 100 year anniversary of Jane Austen’s attendance to the Armory Show which incorporated black and white photographs of the walls from that particular show. 
“If Jane Austen had done what I wish she had, which was to take out her iPhone and shoot me some photographs, I would’ve had that too,” Barchas said. Barchas created a website that allows us to travel back in time and view the amazing art works that Austen got to experience so many years ago.
Not only did Barchas set out to digitally reconstruct the highly acclaimed paintings of Sir Jonathan Reynolds — something that in itself would be a great achievement — but she wanted to view them specifically through the lens of Jane Austen. Over time, her initial slideshow of ideas blossomed into a fully formed website that has been viewed by more than 150,000 people around the world.
Viewers are able to click on the image of each individual portrait and learn about the history of the paintings and the people represented in them, but also how each picture connects back to Jane Austen. 
Some of the people in the paintings include King Lear, Louis Phillipe Joseph, Captain John Hamilton, and Emma Hamilton, who was, according to Barchas, “the Marilyn Monroe of Jane Austen’s time.”
The website has become an overwhelming success, even deemed as a first in the digital humanities. Carnegie Mellon Professor Jamie Smith, who is currently teaching “Pride and Prejudice and Popularity” said, “Barchas’s work is brilliant in that it combines immersive entertainment (like you might experience when watching a Jane Austen film) with detailed historical accuracy and scholarship. Projects like these highlight the value of digital humanities and can provoke new ideas in fields like cultural studies and performance theory.”
What’s next for Janine Barchas? Currently, “What Jane Saw” is in the works of becoming a 3D interactive visual tool for viewers to be able to simulate the experience of embodying Jane Austen as she walks through the museum. Barchas will also be co-curating the “Will and Jane: Shakespeare, Austen, and the Cult of Celebrity” exhibit at the Folger Shakespeare Library with Carnegie Mellon’s Professor of English Kristina Straub.

Boeing creates aerospace data lab at CMU
Chicago-based aeronautics and space engineering company Boeing has teamed up with Carnegie Mellon to create a new lab on campus. Officially called the Boeing/Carnegie Mellon Aerospace Analytics Lab, the lab is meant to expand Carnegie Mellon’s research in aerospace, language — and a subject quite relevant on Carnegie Mellon’s campus, —  machine learning.
Having several contracts with the federal government, Boeing teamed up with Carnegie Mellon to utilize the school’s expertise in these areas. Professor of Computer Science and Director of the Language Technologies Institute Jaime Carbonell leads the team of Carnegie Mellon researchers.
Boeing is no stranger to Carnegie Mellon, nor to its Pittsburgh campus. In fact, one of the company’s former employees, John Vu, is now a professor in language technologies and computational biology. Vu now plays an extensive role in coordinating the relationship between the school and the company.
University President Subra Suresh has expressed excitement in the role the new lab will play. “Researchers from Carnegie Mellon and Boeing have enjoyed a collaborative relationship for more than 30 years and we’re proud of the fact that hundreds of our graduates are working at Boeing,” Suresh said in a university press release.
Chief Information Officer at Boeing Ted Colbert also expressed excitement for the project. Describing the lab as a one-of-a-kind research center, Colbert hoped to see it benefit Boeing’s corporate endeavors in the near future. “We’re aiming to push the technology envelope,” Colbert said in the University press release. 
“We have the best and the brightest faculty at a leading institution focused on how we can innovate and solve business challenges for today and into the future.”
CMU engineers add optic sensors to bots
A new type of robotic hand made its way into the world of robotics through the efforts of Carnegie Mellon engineers: a hand with optic sensors. The hand has fingers just as a human hand does, with 14 separate optic sensors, each acting to sense the hand’s position relative to its surroundings — that is, anything touching the sensors with a force of a tenth of a newton or greater. 
“If you want robots to work autonomously and to react safely to unexpected forces in everyday environments, you need robotic hands that have more sensors than is typical today,” assistant professor of robotics Yong-Lae Park said in a university press release. These hands also need to mimic the human hand. “Human skin contains thousands of tactile sensory units only in the fingertip and a spider has hundreds of mechanoreceptors on each leg, but even a state-of-the-art humanoid such as NASA’s Robonaut has only 42 sensors in its hand and wrist,” Park added.
Carnegie Mellon researchers are excited about this new capability, and presented it at the 2015 IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) in Hamburg, Germany on Oct. 1.

When you walk into a classroom today, you are just as likely to find students engaged in a class discussion or group project as listening to a lecture — if not more so. With increased emphasis on “collaborative learning” and “flipped classrooms,” many schools today are praised for being more dynamic, interesting, and educationally beneficial than traditional schools. Even at colleges, seminars are rapidly becoming more popular than traditional lecture-style classes.
But some shyer, more introverted students suffer perpetually over participation grades, and sometimes no amount of pleading and punishment can encourage them to speak up. Perhaps educators need to step back and examine the reason behind these students’ lack of contribution.
It is true that some students thrive in social situations, learning best when discussing their ideas out loud with others. However, there are some students who process information most efficiently on their own, and even those whose fear of speaking aloud can have a crippling effect on their education. The true danger of this “one size fits all” model for education is that some students’ needs will be continually overlooked in favor of the majority. 
The primary argument for collaborative learning at the expense of introverts' comfort is that all students, even the quiet ones, need to be prepared for “real world” situations that will arise in their professional lives. This argument may well be grounded. Even if the students manage to find a job where they don’t have to interact with others, it is almost guaranteed that they will be forced to speak up during the interview process.
Rather than punishing students for their fears, there must be a gentler way to ease them into feeling comfortable with sharing their opinions out loud. Maybe instructors can start out by having students speak in small groups before they graduate to larger full class discussions. Maybe discussion questions can be given to the class in advance so that students will have time to plan their answers more thoroughly.
Also, teachers and schools should keep in mind that there are many other ways these students might participate. Maybe a student takes careful notes throughout a discussion so they can think about the ideas on their own. Maybe the student thrives during one-on-one discussions, or turns in well-written responses to prompts based on the material.
In other words, just because a student is silent doesn’t mean they are not actively engaging in the learning process. Educators shouldn’t be so quick to write off quiet students as lazy or uninterested.
By definition, introverts need quiet time to process information and recharge — something being constantly stimulated by group activity will not grant them. In the context of group discussions, some introverts may contribute as much as any extroverted student; the underlying difference is that this is not the best way for them to learn.
While American schools are increasing emphasis on "collective" learning, other cultures continue to emphasize individual, instruction-based learning. International students at universities may therefore be at a disadvantage.
All students are different, and as such, they respond in different ways to various teaching methods. Some students are frightened by group discussions, some are drained by one-on-one interaction in smaller groups, and others may be easily distracted or have difficulty focusing during independent reading or studying time.
Formal education should meet in the middle of all these students’ needs. There is a fine line that educators must walk between genuinely preparing students for the future and making them afraid to come to class.

A general rule of thumb is that if Google cares enough to feature a special doodle for a specific event, something big is happening. On Sept. 29, users around the globe were pleasantly surprised with a new Google doodle celebrating the official discovery of water on Mars. 
NASA’s analyses of the planet have proven that enigmatic streaks on Mars' slopes are made from salty, liquid water. This water may have the capacity to support the chemical reactions necessary for life. While we could now hope to fulfill our childhood ET dreams, this could more realistically signal the possibility of sending the first manned spacecraft to Mars. Since scientists now know more about the planet, they will be better equipped to engineer a spacecraft suitable for such a trip.
With greater knowledge of the mysterious planet has come an emergence of related projects. These include Mars One, a non-profit organization with the objective of establishing a permanent human colony on Mars. One-way journeys are scheduled to depart starting in 2026, and from a pool of 200,000 applicants from 35 countries, 100 crew members have been selected. After the discovery of water on Mars, the possibilities are endless.  
Certainly, this recent discovery has successfully reached mainstream media. It has been covered by many major news sources alongside Google. However, interest in astronomy is rare in this modern technological age. Many continue to question the importance of astronomy in a world apparently operated and dominated by technology. Congress continues to cut NASA's federal funding. This year, NASA's budget totaled 0.50 percent of the federal budget ($17 M), in stark contrast to the height of the space race in the 1960s, when NASA was allotted 4.41 percent of the federal budget ($43 M). 
Although the discovery of water in Mars is exciting in itself, the uncommon feat of space-related news making national headlines is also an exciting prospect for many citizens who believe more attention should be given to astronomy.

In last week’s article, “CMU’s visiting policymakers are all talk, not enough action,” Satvika Neti gets it right: we need to advocate for change and educate ourselves to create it. But there are smart ways to advocate for what you want. 
The Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) regularly advocates on behalf of Carnegie Mellon’s graduate population. Recently, we had students in Washington D.C. meet with Senator Bob Casey (D—PA)’s and Representative Michael F. Doyle (D—PA)’s offices to discuss graduate student issues. Our agenda included student visa reform, graduate education funding, open access, open educational resources, and graduate student debt.
These meetings went well, and they were interested in our causes. The GSA has found that giving the right kind of information is how you get policymakers to care. We’re working to become a go-to source of information for these Pennsylvania political offices by sharing graduate student stories, backing our proposals with facts, and generally building working relationship with them.
We were there to make graduate students' experiences vivid for the policy makers. We shared stories of students stuck out of the country because of single-entry visa issues and students who almost had to put the start of their American dream on hold because of graduate student loans. By sharing these experiences, we got them interested in what we had to say.
With their interest piqued, we moved on to providing evidence to support our claims and proposals. As the first people in Casey’s office to support open access, or unrestricted online access to research, we were able to counter publishing industry myths and share how open access policies actually work. Due to that evidence, the staff seemed more receptive in supporting our goals.
The GSA went to D.C. to build relationships with politicians so that we can serve as representatives for graduate student issues. Part of this means that we thanked politicians for supporting our causes, like Casey did when he extended the Perkins Loan program or Doyle does by supporting open access. It also means that we make return trips biannually and maintain communication in the time between our visits. 
To make a difference with politicians, you must build relationships based on information sharing. That’s what policymakers want, and that’s what you need to do to create change.

Congress has reached mythic levels of non-productivity in the past few years. The 112th Congress was the most unproductive in history, at least until the 113th showed up. Things were looking a bit brighter for this year, but with Speaker John Boehner (R-OH)’s announcement that he is resigning from the speakership and his seat in the House of Representatives — effective Oct. 30, according to USA Today — the future is looking stormy. 
Boehner's resignation is a victory for right-wing conservatives, signaling the continued radicalization of the Republican Party. This radicalization is a threat to Congress’s ability to function, both in its practical role as the United States' legislative branch of government and its ideological role as a representative body. 
The straw that broke Boehner’s back on Friday was the imminent government shutdown. Yes, another shutdown. This time, extremist Republicans wanted to use the spending bill that would keep the government funded for the rest of the year to make a stand against abortion. This powerful minority would not vote for any bill that contained funding for Planned Parenthood, even if it meant shutting the government down. This is a classic example of the Tea Party’s "take no prisoners" strategy. They want to hold the government hostage until their political demands are met.
Boehner was a huge roadblock to this no-compromise strategy. He was well known as a dealmaker who searched for ways to reach across the aisle and keep things moving. While hardly a bipartisan force, he is an establishment Republican who knows how the political machine works. Tea Partiers, by contrast, are purists. They have been laying siege to Boehner for most of his five-year run as Speaker because they wanted him to use the Republican majority to force their positions through the House. In the process, they completely ignored a filibuster-bound Senate and a Democratic president with veto power looming like a final boss over every law. 
Any no-compromise strategy should worry everyone, even people who are politically aligned with conservatives. On the surface, a purist politician seems great. A politician who is straightforward about their beliefs, willing to fight hard, and unwilling to play political games sounds like breath of fresh air. In actuality, such an individual is dedicated to the destruction of democracy. 
The House Freedom Caucus, the most recent embodiment of the “hell no” branch of the Republican Party, has approximately thirty members, according to National Review. A group of thirty people holding an economic and political gun to the government in the form of a shutdown is not democracy — it is political terrorism. No one, from the Freedom Caucus to the American Communist Party, should be able to force their minority views on an unwilling country. Boehner’s resignation is a sign of how powerful this faction is becoming, and a warning to people who want a functioning democratic government. 
Currently, it looks like the speakership will stay in the hands of establishment Republicans. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) is the expected successor. He is definitely of the establishment, known for being friendly with both Tea Party conservatives and moderates. However, many people are concerned that McCarthy is not a strong enough force, personally or politically, to bind the party together. He is known for hosting movie nights and playing pranks on fellow Congressmen, not for making tough political decisions and inspiring loyalty, as explained by The Washington Post.
People vote based on a politician's political platform. Does a candidate share your views on the economy, civil rights, privacy, abortion, and a plethora of other issues? While ideological questions are important, it might be time for people to start looking a little more closely at how candidates work within the practical political machinery of Washington. With Boehner’s resignation, the no-compromise politicians we’ve been sending to Congress have managed to tear apart a system of House leadership that has been in place since the Civil War. If we want to preserve America’s unique democracy, it’s time we start taking care of it.

After a week with the iPhone 6s, I'm convinced that Apple has once again managed to create a great mobile experience. The "S" series of iPhones has long been known to feature more incremental updates than revolutionary ones, but despite the fact that the iPhone 6s is not a base model, it stands to impress with many of its new features. It is not a completely new experience, but one that takes an already good experience and makes it even better.
The largest noticeable difference between the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s is speed. The newly improved TouchID is so fast that unlocking your phone feels nearly instantaneous. In addition, waiting for apps to load is a thing of the past. This is a result of the new A9 processor which Apple touts as offering 70 percent faster CPU performance and 90 percent faster GPU performance than its predecessor. 
To make the experience even better, Apple has added 3D touch feature of its Apple watch to its lineup of phones. 3D Touch adds depth to multi-touch and allows the user to select additional options by applying force to the screen. It makes many every day tasks easy, such as creating a new reminder, by simply allowing the user to select additional options. "Peek and Pop" gives the user the ability to see a quick preview of webpages, emails, and other items, with the ability to "pop" these items by applying a bit more pressure. In addition, 3D touch now transforms the keyboard into a trackpad. 
Through features like these, 3D Touch offers many useful tweaks that offer great improvements to iOS overall. 3D Touch is combined with Apple’s Taptic Engine to provide instant feedback to the user when force is applied to the screen. When one applies pressure to the screen, a response is given back to the user in the form of a tap. This is the same technology that powers the feedback of Force Touch on the Apple Watch and the new trackpads on this year’s lineup of MacBooks. It is extremely precise and gives the user the feeling that the phone has directly responded to the amount of pressure applied.
In addition to the speed bumps and new interaction methods provided by 3D Touch, the entire iPhone is tougher than ever. The enclosure is made up of the same durable 7000-series aluminum, used in the Watch Sport as well as by the aerospace industry. In addition, Apple has added new, stronger ion glass that it claims is the strongest in the industry. 
Even more amazing is the fact that Apple has nearly waterproofed the iPhone 6s, a feature that they did not advertise at all. According to Engadget, “Apple packed in a new gasket around the sides of the phone, and it encased every cable connector on the phone’s logic board with a waterproofing material.” This contrasts with the method of protecting external ports used by most companies, resulting in more effective water resistance. It is highly effective and will most likely result in far fewer customers at the Genius Bar after dropping their phones in the toilet.
In addition to adding more functionality and durability, the iPhone 6s has received a major boost in camera specs. The new camera now shoots at 12 MP and is capable of recording 4K video. A new image signal processor, along with other hardware and software enhancements, have also been added to make images even better. After taking some photos, I could easily observe the increased sharpness and quality.
Despite the fact that the iPhone 6s is not a base model, it holds many new features that will greatly enhance the way consumers use their iPhones. 3D Touch offers the biggest user interaction update since multi-touch itself. Enhancements in hardware offer a faster device than ever. New materials and design make the iPhone 6s the most durable iPhone yet. The iPhone 6s can be summarized with the lyrics of a popular Daft Punk song: harder, better, faster, stronger.

Each year, Carnegie Mellon releases the Security and Fire Safety Report. The university is required to publish the report by state and federal law because of the 1990 Jeanne Clery Act, which mandates that all institutions of higher education that take federal money disclose information about crime on and near campus. 
In 2012, there were 17 cases of forcible sex offenses, including offenses off campus property, on campus property, in campus residential buildings, and on public property. In 2013, there were 16. This year, the Department of Education replaces the broadly defined “sex offenses, forcible,” with more granular categories, including rape, fondling, incest, and statutory rape. In 2014, there were six incidences of rape and three of fondling. There were also 27 incidences of stalking — more than double the 13 that occurred in 2013 — as well as two instances of domestic violence and five instances of dating violence. 
The university has put measures into place to combat sexual assault, in response to an investigation by the Department of Education for misconduct in handling cases of sexual assault and relationship violence. While Carnegie Mellon has taken significant steps forward by establishing the Office of Title IX Initiatives and beginning to revamp its Sexual Assault Policy, it hasn’t been enough. Although there are fewer forcible sex offenses this year, the number of offenses related to stalking, dating violence, and domestic violence is shocking. 
Carnegie Mellon is moving in the right direction, but it needs to continue putting new measures in place for preventing sexual assault and relationship violence. The university must be transparent when it handles such cases; for many, this report is the only sign of a serious problem. Although Carnegie Mellon meets the minimum requirements of crime reporting as laid out by the Clery Act, they must go above and beyond and actively campaign to keep students informed.

Mayor Bill Peduto launched a new initiative this month to help Pittsburgh's veterans rejoin the workforce and transition to civilian life. The initiative combines Homefront Pittsburgh and the Veterans in Economic Communities Initiative (VECI). The VECI selected Pittsburgh, which has one of the highest veteran populations in the United States, as one of 50 cities involved in building economic bridges between veterans and the organizations eager to work with them. 
“The greatest barriers returning veterans face are translating their skills, establishing their professional credentials, and finding quality work — jobs that honor their service and put their military experience to good use. By leveraging national resources to advance local goals, Pittsburgh can be a model city for transitioning veterans and military families,” Peduto stated in the official press release announcing the program. 
The Tartan is pleased to see Mayor Peduto and Pittsburgh taking a stand for veterans, one of the most important but also most neglected and mistreated factions of the population. It's absurd how difficult it can be for many veterans to get hired after ending their service. Military service provides people with unique skills and experiences that should translate to civilian jobs rather than keep veterans from them. 
While Homefront Pittsburgh and VECI could have easily stuck to positive rhetoric and grown stagnant when it came to real action, the program seems extensive and well-planned. It began encouragingly this week with a free monthlong professional writing course through the Bakery Square Google offices' Learning Hub. Learning how to communicate effectively is a skill vital to the job search, especially in regard to writing resumes and cover letters. This professional writing course will likely greatly assist veterans in finding good jobs and performing well in the workplace.
The Tartan hopes Homefront Pittsburgh will continue to take measures to improve the lives of this city's veterans. They served our country, and now we should serve them.

Representatives from The Tartan and The Thistle were taken on a tour of the Jared L. Cohon University Center expansion construction site last Thursday,. The tour was led by Director of Student Activities Liz Vaughan, Assistant Director of Athletics and Recreational Programming Sara Gauntner, Director of Marketing for Student Affairs Operations Mandi Semple, and Campus Design & Facility Development Project Manager Adam Homer. 
Lasting about an hour and covering all of the major selling points of the expansion, the tour took us from the new athletic facilities, to behind-the-scenes of the performance theater, to the once-controversial shell space turned student work center, and finally to the new, state-of-the-art lobby that will be the new focal point for university visitors entering campus from Forbes Ave. The project is incredibly expansive, and the progress that has been made so far is exciting. Even our tour guides, who may not be on-site daily, were surprised by how fast the project changes every time they travel behind the chain-link fence that has kept the project shrouded in mystery for so long.
The tour was the first of many that will be offered to students across campus. These tours will be focused on the demographics that are most invested in the new facility: the dance performance groups, the members of student government who made the acquisition of the shell space possible, and the "Ambassadors": the Proud to Be Plaid Committee, the Highland Ambassadors, and the Andrew Ambassadors. Tours will also be offered to alumni and visitors during six already booked times over Cèilidh Weekend.
The Tartan is excited by the progress that has been made and by how much student input has gone into the massive project. The university has shown that the $26 million investment will go toward improving campus life with the students in mind, which is a refreshing development in the midst of so many not-student-focused donations. This upcoming week, the university will ask for student input on the furniture that will occupy the new space.
The onus is now on the students to take advantage of the opportunities to express their desires and concerns with campus projects. Taking an active role in helping to guide these projects shows that you care about the experience of the future student body. As the university sets their sights on tomorrow's students, it is important that we do the same.
