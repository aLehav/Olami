Over spring break, the women’s tennis team competed in the annual ITA Indoor Nationals, located at Gustavus Adolphus College in Minnesota. The Tartans have historically been very successful at Indoor Nationals, and this year was not a disappointment as the Tartans placed fourth overall against some of the best teams in the country.
Carnegie Mellon started off the tournament against the host school, Gustavus Adolphus, a rematch from last year’s Indoor Nationals.
Looking to avenge their disappointing result last year, the Tartans came out strong, sweeping all three doubles points. The No. 2 team of senior Jennifer Chui and sophomore Alex Tapak grinded out a tough match, winning by one break by a score of 9–7. Just a few minutes later, the No. 3 team of senior Ashley Herrick and junior Cze-Ja Tam won in a close match by the score of 9–8, and 8–6 in the tiebreaker. With a 3–0 lead in hand, the Tartans finished off Gustavus with decisive wins at Nos. 1, 4, and 5 singles. The final score was 7–2, and the win set up a tough match with a fellow UAA opponent, the Emory Eagles.
Against Emory, the Tartans came out flat, only taking one of the three doubles points. The No. 1 team of juniors Laura Chen and Courtney Chin was able to get Carnegie Mellon on the scoreboard, winning the match 8–4. 
However, Emory dominated singles play, as they took the first five matches, giving them a win and sending them to the finals. The lone singles win was notched by first-year Madison Rabson, who played a tough match, eventually winning 7–5, 6–4. This loss set up a third place match the next day against No. 5 ranked Denison University.
Once again, the Tartans went down 2–1 after doubles play. The team of Chui and Tapak captured the only doubles victory by the score of 8–5. 
After putting themselves in a hole, the Tartans almost fought back, and they briefly took a 3–2 lead in the match with wins by Chen and Tapak at No. 1 and No. 3 singles, respectively. After Denison took No. 2 and No. 5 singles, the Tartans fought back once again as No. 4 singles player Cze-Ja Tam won in a three set battle. Unfortunately, the deciding match did not go in Carnegie Mellon’s favor, as Rabson lost in a three setter to send the Tartans home with a fourth place finish.
The Tartans resume their schedule next week as they travel to Atlanta, Ga. to play the University of Mary Washington and the University of the South in two matches.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team defeated Ohio’s Walsh University 7–2 last Saturday during its first home outdoors match of the semester. Especially noteworthy was sophomore Duke Miller, who defeated his opponent 6–1, 6–0 at No. 2 singles. The Tartans move to 8–5 for the year.
The Tartans came out swinging against the Walsh Cavaliers and soon took the lead 2–1 after doubles play. The first doubles team to record a win was the No. 3 pair of sophomore Jooho Yu and first-year Mason Radford, who only dropped three games to win 8–3. The second doubles team of senior Alex Nemerov and junior Jeremy King did not have the same luck, and lost its match 8–3. Rounding out doubles play was the No. 1 duo of senior Bobby MacTaggart and sophomore Duke Miller, who recorded a solid win 8–4. 
In singles play, first off the court was No. 1 Nemerov, who lost only four games (6–3, 6–1) on his way to victory. Miller finished second, followed by King at No. 5 singles, who notched in the third win for the Tartans with a 6–4, 6–2 success. MacTaggart pulled out a win at No. 4 singles, 6–4, 4–6, 10–8. Last but not least, Yu battled for the seventh victory at No. 6 singles, 6–2, 6–1. 
The Tartans topped Mercyhurst yesterday 8–1. The Denison Big Red will travel to Pittsburgh next Friday for the Tartans’ next home match, with a start time slated for 4 p.m.

The Carnegie Mellon golf team took a trip down to Florida for spring break this year, but not for any rest or relaxation. The team traveled to Sorrento, Fla. to compete in the University Athletic Association (UAA) Championships at the Red Tail Golf Course.
The Tartans improved over last year’s fourth place finish by taking third in this year’s championship with a score of 626, edging out New York University by merely seven strokes.
Led by junior Terrence Einhorn, the Tartans found themselves in fourth place after the preliminaries, with their score of 317 just one stroke behind NYU.
Einhorn shot 77 on the 72-par course in the preliminaries, good enough for ninth individually, while junior Michael Cheng’s 78 was tied for 11th. First years Ian Bangor and Grant Strimel shot 80 and 82, respectively, and senior Brent Driscoll rounded out the Tartans’ individual performances with an 87. Einhorn improved in the finals round of the championships to once again lead the way for the Tartans, but it was the improvement from the rest of his teammates as well that allowed the team to leapfrog over NYU in the standings. Einhorn improved two strokes to a 75 to keep his ninth place finish from the previous day. 
Both Cheng and Bangor improved to each shoot 77 on the course, finishing with individual standings of 12th and 14th, respectively. Driscoll and Strimer each finished with a two-day total of 167, as Driscoll improved seven strokes to shoot 80 in the finals while Strimer stroked an 85.
The golf team competed at the Jekyll Island Invitational in Jekyll Island, Ga. this past weekend. Results will be posted online.

A friend of mine came up to me the other day and asked an extremely tough question.
He asked, “Which weekend in sports is better: The first weekend of March Madness or the NFL Divisional Playoffs?” 
After a few minutes of thinking, my answer was the NFL Divisional Playoffs, although it definitely was not an easy choice for me.
March Madness captures the attention of almost everyone in America, as people check their brackets hourly to see which picks they’ve gotten right and where they stand in their annual March Madness pools.
Upsets happen almost every day, and it’s almost like there is at least one close game for every four games.
Going into the tournament, I once again had high hopes for my ability to pick the correct upsets and finally be able to win a bracket challenge.
However, this year has already been filled with upsets, some that people expected and others that have shocked much of the country’s population.
Unfortunately, I am part of that population, and my bracket is currently one of the worst in the nation.
Although my bracket may not be doing well, March Madness has still given me a sport to watch every hour of every day.
I find myself so focused on the game that I can’t hold conversations or pay attention to anything else.
The first round of this year’s tournament definitely did not disappoint, as 11 first round games were decided by five points or less.
In the first set of games, the No. 4 seed and heavily favored Louisville Cardinals took on the relatively unknown Morehead State, which was a No. 13 seed. 
This was supposed to be an automatic win for the Cardinals, as they play in the best conference and have a veteran coach who has had success in the tournament.
However, the pesky Morehead State players consistently hit big shots throughout the game, and none bigger than the game-winning three-pointer by point guard Demonte Harper with about three seconds left on the clock.
This put Morehead State up by one, and a last attempt by Louisville to win the game was blocked, sending a team that no one knew about to the round of 32 in a huge upset.
The first day also featured a buzzer-beating layup by the eighth-seeded and defending champion Butler Bulldogs and a last possession win by the seventh-seeded Temple Owls.
With a ton of highly contested games in the first round, I would have been happy with the tournament as a whole even if it ended yesterday. But of course, March Madness does not end there.
A match-up between the No. 4 team in the country, the Pittsburgh Panthers, and the previously mentioned Butler Bulldogs may go down as the craziest game in NCAA history.
For the first thirty-nine minutes, the Bulldogs and the Panthers went back and forth, trading baskets to set the game up for a wild finish.
Down by one point with the ball and about ten seconds left on the clock, Butler brought up the ball and with promptly hit a potentially game-winning layup with 2.2 seconds left on the clock.
With no timeouts, it looked like Pittsburgh was on its way to another heartbreaking loss in the NCAA tournament, which seems to happen every year.
However, on the inbounds play, Butler guard Shelvin Mack inexplicably fouled Pittsburgh guard Gilbert Brown, which put Brown on the line with a chance to win the game by shooting free throws.
After making the first free throw, Brown missed the second, and it looked like this already exciting game was going to go into overtime.
That was until Pittsburgh’s Nasir Robinson fouled Butler’s Matt Howard on a full-court shot, which could go down as the worst foul in NCAA Tournament history. Howard promptly made one of two free throws to seal Pittsburgh’s fate, and will now move on to the Sweet 16 to play fourth-seeded Wisconsin.
It is games like these that define the beauty of March Madness, where any team can beat another on a given day.
This marks the second year in a row that a No. 1 seed has gone down in the round of 32, as Kansas lost last year to relatively unknown Northern Iowa.
In any other sport, the best teams often take care of business to move on to the semi-finals and finals of tournaments because of the way the playoffs are set up.
In March Madness, one game decides everything, which allows small schools that come out and play flawless games to knock off a team that would beat them nine out of 10 times otherwise.
Looking at today’s matchups, I wouldn’t be surprised if all eight games came down to the wire.
Knowing me, I’ll probably be on the losing side of every one of those games as well. But that is life.

First-year Jacqueline Guevel became a track and field celebrity this week for the Tartans. She managed a sixth- place finish in the 55-meter hurdles at the 2011 NCAA Division III Indoor Track and Field Championships on Saturday, March 12.
Jacqueline was invited to the indoor track and field championships after winning the University Athletic Association’s (UAA) 55-meter hurdle competition on Saturday, March 5. She finished the UAA competition race with a time of 8.33 seconds.
Partnered with a UAA title in the 55-meter dash, Guevel brought home the most outstanding performer title in running events and women’s rookie of the year title in the UAA.
At NCAAs, preliminaries for the 55-meter hurdles were on Friday, March 11, with the finals the following day. In the preliminary rounds, Guevel set a new school record of 8.23 seconds, beating her previous school record. That was the second-fastest time in her heat, behind Jamie Thompson of Rowan University, who ran the race in 8.13 seconds. Guevel’s finish was enough to advance her to the finals the following day.
On the day of the championships, Guevel became an All-American. Guevel ran the 55-meter hurdles with a time of 8.29 seconds to claim sixth place. This was the 25th All-American award given to runners under the tutelage of coach Dario Donatelli.
Her teammates have the utmost respect and admiration for the first-year. As sophomore sprinter for the men’s track and field team Noel Titus said, “Jacqueline’s finish was huge.... We are really happy for her.”
When sophomore hurdler Leila Bouabdellaoui was asked about her teammate Guevel, all she could say was, “She’s amazing. She’s a superstar.”

Last night, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted its 2011 class. This year’s class included performers Neil Diamond, Dr. John, Tom Waits, Darlene Love, and Alice Cooper. 
Although I am a fan of Neil Diamond and think Dr. John and Darlene Love had some good tunes, the term “Hall of Fame”  —  and the fact that the above five have been grouped together at the same level, regardless of actual talent or ability — seems a little suspect.
Some years it seems that the “Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum,” should just be called the “Rock and Roll Museum” with the random assortment of performers it inducts each year; one needs to look no further than the 2006 class of inducted performers, which included Black Sabbath, Blondie, Miles Davis, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and the Sex Pistols. You know what? On second thought, let’s just go with the “Music Museum,” because as much as Miles Davis was an excellent musician and a musical genius, he neither rocked nor rolled; that’s why we called it “jazz.”
According to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum website’s Induction Process page, “Criteria include the influence and significance of the artists’ contributions to rock and roll.” Though I’m already doubtful that the “five to seven performers” that have been inducted every year for the past 25 years have all contributed to the development and perpetuation of the genre and its subgenres, these criteria sound strikingly similar to the criteria for an artist to get his or her work into an art museum — and you don’t see the Metropolitan amending its title to the “Metropolitan Hall of Fame and Museum of Art.”
The biggest reason that it seems like anyone who’s recorded a Top 40 single will get inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is explained on the museum’s website. “Ballots are then sent to an international voting body of more than 500 rock experts,” the site reads. “Those performers who receive the highest number of votes — and more than 50 percent of the vote — are inducted.”
In order to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, a player must receive at least 75 percent support on the ballots cast. This has proven a very stringent process, as unlike with the music museum, there are some baseball greats whom many believe belong in the Hall that still have not found their way to Cooperstown. On the other hand, 50 percent on more than 500 ballots leaves an awful lot of opportunity to get inducted, which is why I expect that in 25 years, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame class of performers will include Smashmouth, Toby Keith, Green Day, Taylor Swift, Slipknot, Nas, and the cast of Glee.
That said, music has long been an integral part of baseball. Whether it’s a bugle getting the fans to cheer “CHARGE!” or a player’s trademark walk-up tune, music is constantly heard at baseball games. The most significant marriage between baseball and music, of course, happens during the seventh-inning stretch of every game, when fans of all teams unite to sing “Take Me Out to the Ballgame.”
Most stadiums nowadays have their own musical traditions as well that play an even greater part in showing fans’ true spirit in support of the home team. At Citi Field, as soon as “Take Me Out to the Ballgame” is over, Mets fans join together in singing along to Lou Monte’s “Lazy Mary.” Yankee Stadium is known for playing the Village People’s “YMCA” as the groundskeepers sweep the infield dirt — and for the Bleacher Creatures’ blue-altered lyrics to the song. But without a doubt, the most well-known and powerful musical tradition among fans is at Fenway Park in Boston, thanks to 2011 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee Neil Diamond.
Diamond has had many hit singles of his own, and has even written a few hits for others, including “I’m A Believer” for The Monkees. But it is Diamond’s “Sweet Caroline” that joins Red Sox fans together in a rousing chorus in Fenway Park’s intimate atmosphere that seems to echo all throughout New England. Even if, for some reason, a fan doesn’t know the written lyrics to the song, he can still join in on the unwritten lyrics — the intermittent belting of “oh, oh, oh!” during the chorus of the song. With fans so tightly united, both in song and in support of the Sox, it feels as if there is a greater force pushing the home team to victory, even when the cards are stacked completely against them.
While there are some members of the music museum whose tunes I’d prefer not to see incorporated into the game, musical traditions will continue to make the games that much more fun and entertaining — even the fan karaoke at PNC Park.
That said, Pirates, you really need to stop playing The Police’s “I Can’t Stand Losing” after the Pirates lose — you know that song’s about suicide, right?

Senior John Briguglio is completing his fourth and final season on the track and field team.
Briguglio decided to attend Carnegie Mellon because of the academics and the fact that he could compete athletically as well. “Pittsburgh is a great place too,” Briguglio said. 
Briguglio, a physics major, is looking to attend graduate school and earn his Ph.D. “There are a few schools in the mix currently,” he said.
Other than that, he has not planned anything beyond his graduate school decision at this point.
Briguglio’s favorite part of being on the track team is the lifestyle that comes with it.
“Track has a say in everything, from the way you eat and your weekend plans to the people you spend most of your time with. It keeps me healthy, fit, and — for better or for worse — busy.”
The most memorable moment of the season for him was the deep-dish pizza after the indoor conference championship. “It was fantastically good,” Briguglio explained.
He is looking forward to even more memorable times that he hopes will take place throughout his final outdoor track season.
When reflecting back on his career, Briguglio decided that his last race of the indoor season topped all others.
He ran his most recent 800-meter race of the indoor season in 1:59.3.
The performance secured him second place during Mount Union’s Last Chance Meet. “Pretty good place to be going into outdoor,” said Briguglio. 
Heading into the spring season, Briguglio will be with the track and field team competing against Washington and Lee University this Friday in Lexington, Va.

What is wisdom? Is it maturity, or intelligence, or a combination of different traits? What makes a person wise? People associate wisdom with various characteristics, and in general someone who is wise is regarded as a role model to others — someone people can go to for answers. Although the definition of wisdom is unclear, many people strive for it despite not knowing exactly what  it  is. Is there a magical formula for wisdom so we may all become wise someday? Recently, journalist and author Stephen Hall, who studies the intersection of science, culture, technology, and politics, visited Carnegie Mellon to share what he had learned thus far about the science of wisdom.
As part of the 2011 University Lecture Series, Hall gave a talk titled “Science of Wisdom,” which mainly focused on his journey to uncover the neurological and psychological basis of wisdom. Hall began this project in 2006, when he received the assignment from his New York Times Magazine  editor.
“The science of wisdom sounds a little bit like an oxymoron. Wisdom is an immense topic, obviously — it’s something people have talked about and argued about for literally millennia, and it’s difficult to talk or write about because it means so many different things with different people,” Hall explained, noting that it was initially difficult to start researching a topic that was not clearly defined.
Despite the ambiguity of how wisdom was defined, Hall was able to find commonalities between different schools of thought regarding wisdom. Many scientists related it to how people dealt with uncertainty, change, and unexpected “curveballs” that life can throw at them. Other common traits that Hall kept observing among different studies were being even-keeled emotionally, understanding the viewpoint of others, having the ability to frame problems so as to expose many alternative solutions, and having a sense of moral and social justice.
From these commonalities, Hall formulated what he refers to as the “Eight Pillars of Wisdom.” According to his book published last year,  Wisdom: From Philosophy to Neuroscience, these eight “pillars” are emotion regulation, compassion, moral judgment, humility, altruism, patience, sound judgment, and dealing with uncertainty.
“Being emotionally even-keeled affects the decisions you make. Compassion is not merely a feeling for someone else but also understanding the point of view of another person, which, in turn, forms the kinds of decisions you make,” Hall explained, indicating that these eight pillars do not have strict borders between them and may overlap and affect each other.
Not all agree with Hall’s pursuit to gain definition about wisdom. According to  The New York Times Book Review two weeks ago of Hall’s Wisdom: From Philosophy to Neuroscience, “By the modern era, however, philosophers had largely abandoned such inquiries. Hall seems unaware of this.... It is not that philosophers are daunted or bored by wisdom. Rather, they have concluded that there is no single right balance of elements that constitutes ‘the good life for man,’ and hence no unitary value that wisdom can help us maximize.”
One interesting study that Hall encountered was pivotal in the intersection of wisdom and neuroscience. Scientists at the University of Wisconsin-Madison measured the brain activity of a Buddhist monk during meditation. They did so by attaching a device to the monk’s head that collected electroencephalogram data; this essentially recorded the electrical activity produced by the brain in real time. Brain activity was recorded during various intensities of meditation.
The results, which were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, showed that the brain activity correlated well with the various levels of meditation performed by the Buddhist monk, suggesting that mental training involves significant changes in neural activity. The results also showed promise for future work to be performed regarding which mental activity using “mental experts” such as Buddhist monks as a model system of high-order cognitive processes. 
However, gaining a more accurate measure of a person’s “wisdom” is called into question in the Times review. “Subjective judgments of wisdom, by contrast, are notoriously unreliable.... If you think you’re wise, you’re probably a fool.”
Hall noted that in thinking about wisdom, the various research groups that have spent years studying the science behind it have helped push and advance the knowledge on human memory; if one considers what was known about memory a few years ago and compares that to today’s understanding, the change is immense. Hall argued that these things might have never been learned if we had not started exploring the science of wisdom. 
Hall also stressed the importance of stopping and thinking about various curiosities such as wisdom. In regard to the current “connected” state of society, in which most people are constantly surfing the Internet and receiving massive amounts of information, Hall posed the rhetorical question, “Is there a place for wisdom in our modern world, and if [not], how do we make room for it?”

Following their success last year,  Director of Software Engineering Todd Sedano and Venture Capitalist Scott Russell (SCS 1982) at Carnegie Mellon's Silicon Valley campus are again offering 96-800, Real World Software Engineering for Entrepreneurs, this summer.
“The feedback from the students was that they loved it,” Sedano said. “Several of the teams are still working on their projects and are planning to start businesses when they graduate.”
The course 96-800 is unique because it is the only course where students are required to launch a software company and are graded based on that company’s success. “Last year, 22 people divided into seven teams took the class Real World Software Engineering for Entrepreneurs. Over the summer, all of the teams successfully developed and launched a mobile application, learned how to market their product to real customers and how to pitch their start up to venture capitalists,” said Russell, who is a venture capitalist himself.
While the experience is marked with many obstacles and sometimes failures, course alumni describe it as one of their most valuable learning experiences. “Prior to taking it [96-800], I had no idea of what kind of stuff you have to consider in making an app that you hope to profit from,” senior computer science and mathematical sciences double major Dustin Haffner said. “The instructors ... are both quite knowledgeable about the software industry. So, too, were the other students in the class. Much of the lessons I learned came from Scott sharing his experience as a venture capitalist.”
“[96-800] was like boot-strapping a start-up within a semester,” remarked master’s student Swamy Srikantappa, who has also taken the course. “It gave us a taste of the start-up culture in Silicon Valley.” Srikantappa and her team developed “AlertHey,” an application that helps caregivers, medical professionals, and other users monitor vital signs from Bluetooth sensors. 
“We built cloud components to archive, interface with health vaults, and generate alerts when patient vital signs crossed preset thresholds,” Srikantappa said.
A critical aspect of the course is the mentoring program. “In Silicon Valley there are a lot of successful alumni. From the start, we paired each team with an alumni entrepreneur who gave the individual coaching on the challenges of starting a software business,” Russel commented. “This type of mentoring from experienced, successful alumni is priceless.”
The main challenge students run into during the course seems to be selling the product. “Being able to program an app isn’t enough,” Haffner noted. “Selling is quite a useful skill.”
The course description also reads, “For most of our talented engineering teams this was the FIRST TIME they had ever tried to ‘sell’ a real piece of software. This is the first time they had ‘cold called’ a stranger. Every team learned how hard it is to sell their applications. Most didn’t like selling. They preferred to develop! We’re here to help you with this hard transition in become more entrepreneurial.”
Because of the success the pair had with their course, they decided to offer 96-800 again this summer. “We decided to offer the course again this summer because feedback from the first class was positive and demand from students who want to learn more about how to start a business is high.” Sedano added, “We enjoyed the projects that the students did last year, and we can’t wait to see what people are thinking about for this year.”
This year, Sedano and Russell are also open to software and Web projects. “Last summer every team developed a mobile application. This summer we hope to have more variety. We encourage teams to pursue their own ideas, but in addition to mobile applications, we’d also like to see team develop applications for the Web,” Russell said.
Sedano and Russell stress that the course is open to all interested students, both undergraduate and graduate. “If you think you want to be an entrepreneur, then this course will give you an incredible experience to see what it is really like. It’s rewarding and fun work because it is challenging. If you have a software business idea and you have free time this summer, then get some friends together, find your way to Silicon Valley, and apply for the course,” Sedano added.
Further information about this course is available at: http://96800.sv.cmu.edu.

If medical technology continues to progress at a rapid rate, there exists the possibility that we will be able to “order” what bones we want and receive stem cell implants that can actually grow into our bones. According to Carnegie Mellon Emergency Medical Services, one of the most common injuries on our campus is hurting an ankle. So what happens when the injury to one’s ankle or foot is so bad that it needs surgery, particularly a bone graft?
Bone grafts are surgical procedures in which a missing bone is replaced with other bone material. Typically, the bone is taken from another part of the patient’s body, often the hip. Bone grafts are successful because bone, unlike most tissue, has the ability to regenerate completely, so as native bone grows, the new cells will almost completely replace the graft cells. The advantage to grafting bone from the patient, rather than a donor, is that the risk of rejection is low, although blood loss or infections may occur. 
However, one issue with bone grafts is that some people who have had the procedure tend to suffer from pain up to five years later. Bone grafts are seen every day in the shape of dental implants. According to eMedicine.com, more than 500,000 U.S. and 2.2 million worldwide bone graft procedures are performed each year. Now surgeons are using methods that include using replacements for bone that can be taken right “off the shelf.” In a press release on March 11, Glenn Weinraub, president of the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons (ACFAS), said, “Harvesting a patient’s own bone has always been considered the gold standard, but nowadays I think the concept should be thought of as the historical standard. 
The quality of the material that is available in a prepackaged format has been shown to be just as effective for bone healing and may yield fewer complications for the patient.”
The material mentioned in a “prepackaged format” is stem cells. Stem cells are special cells found in multicellular organisms that have the potential to morph into any type of cell. These stem cells can be cultured and then injected into a human at a particular location for the cells to grow a specific type of tissue. Advances in science have led to the ability for surgeons to use stem cells to assist the body in mending bone. When placed in the location of a missing bone, the stem cells proliferate and “become” the bone cells, effectively replacing the bone.
But do the stem cells have to come from the patient themselves, or can they be donated? Like bone graft material, stem cells can come from the patients or from a lab that harvests and makes billions of copies from the bone cells of donors. Unlike with bone grafts, the fear of rejection of the stem cells by the body is low.
But having lab-harvested stem cells is akin to having a packaged super-cell thatcan change into any type of cell when placed in the body, therefore giving the added advantage that the step of acquiring the material from the patient can be skipped entirely. Weinraub commented, “We are putting the cells right there on the defect, and because they are in a bone environment, these cells may direct and partake in the process of bone formation.”
So the next time you need ankle surgery, you might find yourself in a situation where surgeons are opening a box of stem cells and placing them in your foot. Now, the question is, how long before stem cells find themselves on the shelves of your favorite convenience store?

For years now, nuclear power plants have been a popular alternative energy source. In light of the recent Japanese nuclear scares, the safety of these plants has also come into question. According to Ukrainian professor and nuclear power expert Borys Ledoshchuk, in a presentation for the World Health Organization Collaborating Center University of Pittsburgh, “The United States produces the most nuclear energy, with nuclear power providing 19 percent of the electricity it consumes.” Beginning in 1942 with the Manhattan Project, the United States began developing atomic bombs, two of which would ultimately be dropped on Japan in 1945. Fast-forward to March 2011; the Japanese are facing yet another challenge with nuclear energy. This time, however, the source of the problem is closer to home. When the recent 9.0-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami brought disaster to the Japanese, one of the most publicized problems was the reactor explosions, which indicated a bigger problem at hand: the failure of the cooling system at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear complex in northeastern Japan.
The tsunami was the true source of the problem, starting a chain of events that would cause the fuel rods to overheat. The tsunami destroyed the diesel generators that would normally keep the plant running and cool water circulating over the spent fuel rods and through the reactor, according to an article on  www.npr.org. This forced the backup power to kick in and run the pumps, but the measure was only temporary. Without power to keep the temperature of the fuel rods low, their casing can melt and become oxidized, exposing the rods’ toxic radioactive material. When the protective covering surrounding the rods became too hot, a large amount of hydrogen was produced. This hydrogen, along with generated steam, was vented into in the reactor building, causing it to explode.
Determining which radioactive isotopes have been released into the atmosphere will help determine the severity of the radioactivity the Japanese are being exposed to. According to ABC News, however, most of the skepticism surrounding radiation poisoning is due to a misinformed public. Fear is the major motive driving people to hoard potassium iodine pills, but they may end up having more negative than positive effects on the body. According to Dr. Richard Besser, chief health and medical expert for ABC News, there are “side effects and dangers to taking these pills” without proper medical direction. Additionally, most experts agree that there is no immediate threat to most of Japan’s population.
The world learned many lessons from the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 that will help containment efforts should a widespread radiation release occur. For example, one effect of the Chernobyl disaster was that children developed thyroid cancer years after the tragedy occurred. This happened because they were indirectly exposed. The link has been traced back to radioactive substances contaminating the milk the children drank. Radioactive iodine dispersed onto the grass that cows ate, and the cows’ milk became contaminated as a result.
In Japan, more immediate concern lies with the well-being of the workers trying to contain the problem. Bradley Blackburn, a reporter for ABC, claimed, “The workers are certainly facing extreme risks, particularly if the situation at the plant becomes even worse.” The 180 employees and emergency workers voluntarily working on the nuclear reactors have not yet been exposed to the 1000 millisieverts of radiation necessary to induce acute radiation sickness, but “the Japanese government has upped the limit on total exposure for workers to an annual dose as high as 250 millisieverts” according to an ABC article.
According to President Obama, there is no need for Americans to worry. If any detectable amount of radiation reaches Alaska, Hawaii, or the West Coast, there are sensors in place to identify it. As of last weekend, no abnormal levels of radiation have been detected. In a USA Today/Gallup Poll taken on March 17, about 70 percent of people surveyed said they are more apprehensive about the safety of nuclear energy since Japan’s crisis began, in contrast to two weeks ago when 57 percent of the population said they supported building more plants.

Pornographic content gets own Internet suffix
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers approved a top-level domain suffix for pornographic content last Friday. The suffix “.xxx” is the result of a decade-long debate to determine how red-light content is compartmentalized in cyberspace. Backed by ICM Registry, this voluntary domain registration would help prevent users from getting computer viruses and provide filters for child pornography and other offensive material. The domain suffix is expected to launch in June or July of this year.

Nintendo launches 3-D DS handheld system
Nintendo, the Japan-based video game powerhouse, has announced the launch of the world’s first 3-D handheld gaming device, named the Nintendo 3DS, which will be available in two weeks. This device, with a button to lessen or amplify the 3-D effects, will mimic the effects one sees when watching 3-D movies, but without the glasses. The system also includes built-in upgrades from Nintendo’s previous handheld device — an SD card slot, a larger screen, and a joystick control. The American Optometric Association has gone so far as to say this device could provide therapeutic results for young children with lazy eye.

Former Goldman Sachs programmer arrested for theft
Sergey Aleynikov, a former computer programmer at Goldman Sachs, was charged last Friday with stealing several hundred thousand lines of code (‘trade secrets’) from the financial firm. In 2009, Aleynikov allegedly stole the code before heading off to an interview with Teza Technologies, who would have paid him triple the amount of his $400,000 salary. According to prosecutors, Aleynikov stole around 32 of Goldman Sach’s 1224 megabytes of code of the company’s advanced trading software, which helps generate the firm millions of dollars each year. He has been sentenced to eight years in prison.

Japan discovers contamination in food supply
In wake of the 9.0-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami that devastated Japan’s eastern coast last week, Japanese authorities have discovered high trace levels of radiation in vegetables and other food staples. The government has stopped all supply from food vendors near the leaking nuclear power plant. Officials have also reported elevated levels of iodine and cesium in the rain and water sources. The government has also ordered the distribution of potassium iodine pills to citizens; the pills should help prevent the absorption of radiation into the body.

Scientists find breakthrough with gene therapy
Scientists have found optimistic results regarding Parkinson’s disease, a degenerative disease that affects the brain, with a recent gene therapy clinical trial. Patients who received doses of glutamic acid decarboxylas, a virus which creates a neurotransmitter that regulates dopamine levels, were shown to have a 23.1 percent increase in motion control compared to patients in the control group. Scientists hope this can become a long-term solution for treating the disease.

**NASA satellite Messenger begins orbiting Mercury **
After six-and-a-half years and 4.9 billion miles, NASA’s Messenger has successfully begun orbiting the planet Mercury. The $446 billion project aims to gather pictures of the planet’s surface and confirm many scientists’ hypothesis that water exists there. Mercury is the closest planet to the sun in the solar system, and it has surface temperatures that range from 800°F to –300°F. The desk-sized Messenger should start transmitting pictures and readings next month.

To get chosen to be one of the 14 top finalists for an international Korean pop (K-pop) competition is remarkable, but to be one of the opening acts for top K-pop singer G.NA? That’s epic. Chris Hong, a first-year biomedical engineering and chemical engineering major, received the opportunity of a lifetime from K-pop record label Cube Entertainment: an opportunity to showcase his talent in front of a large audience and perform as an opening act for G.NA, a Canadian-born K-pop singer.
Despite what Hong’s Korean pop successes might suggest, his interest in the genre started relatively late in his life. Hong grew up in New York and had only ever been to Korea for two months, but he studied in a Korean school and became fluent in Korean. Until middle school, Hong listened to Simple Plan, Korn, Linkin Park, Bon Jovi, and other American bands. It wasn’t until high school that he was introduced to K-pop by one of his Korean friends. Hong stated in an e-mail, “Almost instantly I was hooked. I found the rhythm and the beats to be extremely catchy.”
But landing a place in the Top 14 didn’t come easily to Hong. Since he wasn’t raised performing K-pop, he joined International Freestylers at Carnegie Mellon to learn breakdancing ­— as Hong explained, “Not only does a K-pop idol have to be trained to sing, but they have to be trained to dance and act as well.” He soon picked up other performance-based techniques, like audio recording and rapping, in order to get ready to submit an audition tape. He also had to take out time to rehearse effectively. “I practiced singing or rapping music by continuously listening to a particular song and by getting familiar with its beat and rhythm. From there on, I would record myself and upload the video onto my YouTube channel in order to receive feedback from other YouTube users,” Hong said.
Before trying out for Cube Entertainment, Hong auditioned for Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation’s “The Birth of a Great Star,” a Korean televised singing competition. He uploaded a YouTube video of himself singing a K-pop track as his audition tape, but was disappointed when he was not selected for the contest.
He then decided to practice harder for an upcoming audition with a big K-pop label called JYP. However, through YouTube, he learned of Koreaboo: Cube Auditions 2011, an audition with Cube Entertainment, which supports Korean pop stars such as B2ST, G.NA, and 4Minute, that was sponsored by the English K-pop website Koreaboo. “I’ve always wanted to audition for Cube Entertainment because I wanted to be in a group [similar to] B2ST, but until now, most auditions were held only in South Korea,” Hong said.
Hong sent his audition to Cube Entertainment in December and waited to hear back from the selectors. Hong explained, “The whole audition consisted of three rounds. First, Cube notified you that you passed the first round via e-mail and then you had to send in another video for the second round. You would then get a call from Korea if you had passed onto the final round, where the top 14 finalists would perform live in Vancouver, Canada, for a chance to get a contract with Cube Entertainment.”
Hong’s optimistic streak was noticeable even while he waited to hear back from Cube Entertainment. During the two-month wait, Hong wrote lyrics to a song called “DreamMaker,” which was his remix version of “Just a Dream” by Nelly, expressing how he “won’t ever give up trying to become a Korean pop artist.”
Finally, when Hong did hear back in February, he was congratulated on being one of the 14 finalists in the competition. Chosen from over 3,000 auditioners, he was told that he would be performing in Vancouver along with the other finalists, with the whole competition being broadcast on Canadian news.
The competition took place at the Bell Performing Arts Centre in Vancouver on Feb. 27. Although the winner of the competition was a dancer named Edo, also known as “Blackmamba,” Hong has no regrets. “I’m so glad I went for the competition because the experience was amazing,” he said. “I met extremely talented people, got a chance to meet G.NA — the first K-pop idol I’ve ever met — and most importantly, had the chance to live my dream.”
Even though the competition has ended, the experience has continued to influence Hong’s life. Hong said, “The other finalists and I got really close due to the competition, and I almost feel like we’re one big family. We’re still in touch and maintain contact with each other via Facebook and have set up a new YouTube channel where we are uploading collaborations with one another.”
And the best part about participating in the competition? “Honestly, this was the first time I’ve ever sang or rapped in front of a large audience. On my way to the performance in the cab with two other finalists, I was very nervous, but during rehearsal I felt comfortable and excited to perform. So, undoubtedly, the best part about the whole journey for me was performing on stage and getting to know the other finalists.”
Hong’s love for K-pop hasn’t come before his love for American music. He still listens to and thoroughly enjoys American artists such as Daughtry, Jason Derulo, Nelly, Eminem, and Ne-yo. Hong said, “I guess you could say that I now listen to a broad range of music, ranging from rock to heavy metal to rap to K-pop.” One might feel that American pop is very different from K-pop, but Hong claimed, “Besides the language, Korean and American pop songs are very similar. Just the way Korean pop artists are ‘developed’ is different. In America, one can just sign a contract and start making albums and start performing on stage like Justin Bieber. But in Korea, one must first go through years of hard training before debuting on stage.... There are so many trainees in each Korean music industry, but only a few get elected to be debuted, and most of the times trainees quit their training because of the ‘slave-like’ environment and the hard, tiring years of training.”
Despite the similarities between Korean and American pop, Hong remains skeptical about America’s acceptance and response to K-pop. Although K-pop is gaining popularity worldwide, few American artists have recognized this fact. Hong feels that “Korean pop music has been popular worldwide, and American artists such as American music producer and rapper will.i.am have recognized how popular K-pop has been. In fact, he is currently working with 2NE1 [another popular K-pop group] to release an English album, but not many artists have followed suit as of yet. Other popular K-pop artists such as BoA, Wondergirls, and Rain(Bi) have come to America to release their music with successful results.” 
The United States doesn’t have a very large audience for Korean pop when compared with countries such as Japan and Taiwan. Hong believes the existing audience for K-pop in America is mostly because of the Internet. He said, “Because YouTube provides free access to music around the world, uploading K-pop music videos onto YouTube has made it even more popular here in [the] U.S.”
And what about at Carnegie Mellon? Most of Hong’s friends don’t listen to K-pop, but occasionally one comes across students who enjoy listening to it, regardless of whether they speak and understand Korean, something Hong finds encouraging. Hong stated, “I don’t think Carnegie Mellon has a large Korean pop scene when compared to other colleges such as Rutgers University, which had a winter festival for K-pop and brought really popular Korean artists such as Jay Park [to its campus] for performances.” Now that Carnegie Mellon has a Korean pop singing sensation on campus, though, perhaps its music scene will grow.

For college students across the globe, caffeine has become essential for getting through the day. In any given location on campus, there is at least one readily available source of coffee. Carnegie Mellon offers eleven main facilities for ordering coffee: Tazza D’Oro, Maggie Murph Café, Zebra Lounge, The Exchange, Ginger’s Express, La Prima Espresso, Skibo Café, Carnegie Mellon Café, the Underground, Stephanie’s, and Entropy+.
Each of these facilities offers a range of choices, from espressos to mocha lattes to cappuccinos. A majority of the facilities’ beverages are provided by CulinArt, which uses Starbucks products. 
Carnegie Mellon Café and Maggie Murph Café, as well as The Exchange and Ginger’s Express, which are owned by Mike Clarkson and Kevin Huber, are the most popular coffee locations. They offer the widest range of Starbucks products, often mirroring the full Starbucks menu. This is convenient for students who need their Starbucks fix but may not have time to go to the Craig Street location for their coffee. 
However, other venues give coffee on campus some variety if students don’t like Starbucks products.
The Underground in Morewood, Skibo Café in the University Center, and Zebra Lounge in the College of Fine Arts building are all managed by Gullifty’s Restaurant. All of these campus locations sell fair-trade and organic coffees. The Underground and Skibo Café are primarily used by students for food, while Zebra Lounge is primarily a beverage vendor.
Tazza D’Oro at the R-Bar Café in the Gates Center is managed by the company Tazza D’Oro, which has another café location in Highland Park. The company currently roasts Verve coffees. It offers a different specialty brew every day, each with its own flavor and geographic origin. According to its website, “We love coffee, we love bicycles and we love creating community all centered around a carefully prepared cup of coffee or espresso.” Tazza D’Oro uses ingredients from local and independent farms and vendors for all its beverages and food, encouraging growth among smaller businesses. 
“The key to good coffee is good beans. On campus, the best beans can be found at La Prima and Tazza,” said Christopher Palmer, a sophomore electrical engineering major. “I personally prefer getting drip from Prima and cappuccinos from Tazza. Both places are reasonably priced and have decent coffee. If you like making your own coffee in your apartment or dorm, Tazza is the only place to buy coffee beans, which you can have them grind for you or grind yourself.”
“I’m going to say La Prima and Seattle’s Best [from the University Center] are my favorites. Seattle’s Best, just because I used to drink it at home all the time,” said Shilpa Balaji, a sophomore computer science major. “Tazza [D’Oro] is probably the strongest, so that could be the best option depending on what you’re looking for, but it’s sometimes a little too thick for my taste. The Guatemalan blend at Skibo is generally extremely watered down, which makes me not generally opt for it.”
La Prima Espresso is an outside company that operates its own cart on the fifth floor of Wean Hall. According to its website, it only sells fair trade coffee. La Prima offers students a “coffee of the month” at its cart, allowing for even more variety. “I generally go to either La Prima or Tazza D’Oro. On taste alone, I slightly prefer Tazza D’Oro, but they’re both good,” said Lucas Ray, a sophomore computer science major.
Not a fan of coffee? There are plenty of alternative beverage options on campus that still pack a punch of caffeine to help you stay awake and alert in classes. All of these dining facilities offer a wide selection of teas, hot water canisters, and various energy drinks in addition to their coffee options.
Unfortunately, a majority of these facilities are closed throughout the weekend, a time when students may need caffeine the most. Only a few are open every day of the week: Maggie Murph Café, Skibo Café, Carnegie Mellon Café, the Underground, and Entropy+. This severely cuts down on the options available to students, which may force them to seek a location off campus for their coffee needs.
Students should be economical in where they go for coffee on campus; they should look for the locations that offer the most coffee for the lowest cost. La Prima Espresso, for example, only has 16 oz. as its largest size, and any coffee in that size costs about $4. Comparatively, Maggie Murph Café offers a large size of 20 oz. for a similar price. Wait time can also factor into a student’s preferred coffee location: More popular places on campus can take up to 15 minutes just to order a plain coffee, depending on the time of day. This can severely bite into students’ time between classes and affect their busy schedules.
Striking a balance between wait time and price can be tricky. “You can usually go to La Prima right after a class ends and get your drink with a few minutes to spare before your next class,” said Ray. “Tazza D’Oro, on the other hand, usually has at least a 10 minute wait or more right after classes let out, probably since they also serve meals. However, Tazza D’Oro is considerably cheaper than La Prima, so the wait is sometimes worth it.”
Overall, when it comes to buying coffee on campus, students should weigh several factors before settling upon their favorite coffee location, those factors mainly being price, wait time, availability, and, of course, taste.

Few professors can claim to have been a major influence in the work of four generations of students. Samuel Rosenberg, however, is one such professor. It is his incredible influence as a Carnegie Tech professor that is the focus of the American Jewish Museum’s current exhibit, A Painter’s Legacy: The Students of Samuel Rosenberg.
“Even though there are a lot of art professors in Pittsburgh, and we have such great [art] institutions ... Samuel Rosenberg leaves a very distinctive legacy that four generations of artists point back to as being the major influence in their work, as well as in their lives,” said Melissa Hiller, the director of the American Jewish Museum and curator of the exhibit. Rosenberg’s teaching career spanned four decades, during which he served as a professor at the Carnegie Institute of Technology and founded art departments at both the Irene Kaufmann Settlement, a private philanthropic agency, and the Isaac Seder Educational Center at the Young Men and Women’s Hebrew Association (YM&WHA), until his retirement in 1964. Some of his most famous students included Philip Pearlstein, a colleague of Andy Warhol; Mel Bochner, an accomplished conceptual artist; and Carnegie Mellon’s most famous art student, Andy Warhol himself.
Although his famous pupils are impressive, equally impressive is the sheer number of his students and how loyal they still remain to Rosenberg. “The kind of person he was, as well as the kind of professor he was, in addition to the number of artists not only in Pittsburgh but really all throughout the United States, and their continual loyalty to him made [creating the exhibit] a pretty easy process for me to take up,” Hiller said. “People who studied with Samuel Rosenberg completely understand and are honored by the historical approaches and curatorial projects that people like me have, so all I really had to do was introduce myself and discuss the [exhibit] ... people were so generous because they still have such a love for Rosenberg.”
The exhibit is made up of 76 works of art from over 50 of his students, with only one of Rosenberg’s paintings. “The concept [of the exhibit] is to show his teaching style and what he taught the students who were in his class, so it’s an exhibition that’s a balance of showing him as a teacher, but showing the artwork by the students, both from Carnegie Mellon University as well as [the YM&WHA],” Hiller explained.
Even the sole painting by Rosenberg in the exhibit still focuses on his role as a teacher: The unfinished painting features Rosenberg’s son sitting at a blank easel, depicted from the perspective of looking over his son’s shoulder. Even in his art, Rosenberg was still aware of his role as a teacher, peering over his students’ shoulders to guide their progress.
Despite the range of artistic genres represented in the exhibit, Rosenberg’s influence still shines through every work of art. “I got dozens of comments about how powerful it is for a group of people to have a source of influence that is that strong,” Hiller said. The exhibit serves as a powerful testimonial to Rosenberg’s legacy and to the influence a single teacher can have. 
A Painter’s Legacy will be on display in Fine Perlow Weis Gallery and Berger Gallery through April 30.

A cappella is one of Carnegie Mellon’s not-so-hidden gems. No Instruments Aloud was a showcase of not one, not two, but seven talented groups of a cappella singers, including a special guest appearance from Case Western Reserve University’s Solstice. The showcase, which took place last Saturday, was an evening full of claps, snaps, and plenty of laughter.
The show kicked off with The Originals covering Rob Thomas’ “Streetcorner Symphony.” For the next song, the all-male group slowed things down a bit with Coldplay’s “Fix You.” The lead, sophomore electrical and computer engineering major Ryan Salvo, channeled Coldplay singer Chris Martin’s cool, high notes, while the rest once again chimed with imitated instrumentation, led this time by vocal percussionist and junior computer science major Duncan Boehle. The Originals finished off their set with a humorous rendition of Cee-Low’s “F*CK You” led by junior architecture major Richman Neumann.
The Christian a cappella group Joyful Noise came on stage next, and stated that the group’s first song, Superchick’s “Stand in The Rain,” was about how God is always supporting us. The lyrics assured that “one day what’s lost can be found.” Before beginning the third song of the Joyful Noise set, a member of the group explained that the song was a dialog between two people as well as a mashup of two songs, in this case Red Jumpsuit Apparatus’ “Your Guardian Angel” and Paramore’s “My Heart.” The song featured beat-boxing and solos from a large number of the singers.
Soundbytes were next up on stage, and the group was quick to change the pace with a powerful rendition of Rihanna’s “Rudeboy,” led by junior humanities and arts student Liz Martindale and backed by skillful beat-boxing. Next in its set was Paramore’s “That’s What You Get,” which featured more direct instrumental imitations as well as more harmonized background vocals.
Only half of Case Western Reserve’s Solstice was able to make it to Carnegie Mellon on Saturday, but the group members assured the audience that they had nothing to worry about. Solstice started off with Kate Nash’s “Pumpkin Soup,” and after singing “I just want your kiss,” the lead singer paused to jokingly address the audience, “I’m sick but I’m not contagious, so don’t worry ‘bout it” before diving back into the song. The next song, Yael Naim’s “New Soul,” proved that even with only half its members, the ensemble still had plenty of energy and range with its harmonizations.
Deewane started up after intermission with a mashup that helped to bring the audience “back to spring break” by mashing up Shaggy’s “Angel” with a tropical tune “Dil Kya Kare.” Its imitation of Rayvon’s rapping style was particularly well received.
The Treblemakers, the newest a cappella group on campus, started off with a cover of Kanye West’s “Heartless” before warming things up with a lovable ’90s throwback, Eagle Eye Cherry’s “Save Tonight,” which was led by a charming two-person harmony. The final song was an emotional rendition of Bruno Mars’ popular song “Grenade.”
Counterpoint started its set off with VV Brown’s “Shark in the Water,” which allowed the group to showcase its members’ vocal range. Ellene Mobbs, a senior English major, helped to lighten things up by leading the group through an airy rendition of Train’s “Hey, Soul Sister.”
The Originals reappeared with a change into formal attire and plenty of choreography, which helped to end the night with a laugh. In addition to Katy Perry’s “Teenage Dream” and the encore, Grand Funk Railroad’s “Some Kind of Wonderful,” the all-male group got the audience on its feet with a sidesplitting rendition of Lady Gaga’s “Paparazzi.”
Overall, the evening provided a diverse mix of songs and proved that one doesn’t need instruments to make great music.

When thinking of Noah and the Whale, the words “chipper” and “optimistic” don’t exactly come to mind — the group’s previous album, The First Days of Spring, was an epic break-up album, where vocalist Charlie Fink lamented love lost and heartbreak, as inspired by his breakup with ex-band member Laura Marling. However, its recent release, Last Night on Earth, is the exact opposite. Gone are the melancholy tunes and somber words. Instead, the beats are a little more happy-go-lucky and the lyrics are infused with a sense of hopefulness. Clearly Fink and the band have moved on from Marling’s departure.
Last Night on Earth immediately starts out upbeat and happy with “Life is Life,” whose message is about changing your life for the better and living to the fullest. This positive outlook manages to stay throughout the whole album, ironically enough, considering the ominous title of the album. The song is grand — filled with synthetic sounds, piano chords, and a gospel choir.
The second track, “Tonight’s the Kind of Night,” is equally hopeful, as Fink tells the story of a boy leaving his hometown behind for bigger and better things, thinking that “tonight’s the kind of night/that everything could change.” 
Single “L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N.” is cutesy, with a strong beat and fast lyrics. Fink paints a vivid picture of possibility, preaching the idea that whatever happens happens and life goes on: “On my last night on earth/I won’t look to the sky/just breathe in the air/and blink in the light,” sings Fink. 
“Give It All Back” starts off with a happy little melody from a xylophone and progresses into a first-person story, one of three on the album, about the carefree days of growing up and starting a band.
There is more storytelling on this album and fewer instrumental interludes, the only such interlude being “Paradise Stars.” The songs on Last Night on Earth are mostly narrated in third person, as if Fink was a camera capturing moments of other people’s lives, but this technique allows Fink to stay one step short of getting too personal. Instead, Last Night comes across as being a little forced, as if Fink is trying to prove to the world that he’s moved on before he really has. 
Noah and the Whale has many worthwhile qualities, but the most mesmerizing is its ability to be honest and pour its souls into its songs, a quality that gets a little lost in this album. That’s not to say that Last Night on Earth isn’t a good album, or that a band needs to go through a heart-wrenching break-up to get personal. The album is a great album, but it’s a little too generic — any other band could have written a similar album with similar messages. Perhaps fans are expecting a little too much out of the band as First Days raised the standards, but it’s hard not to feel a little disappointed that Noah and the Whale went from being extraordinary to just ordinary.

One can hear the wailing of bagpipes from blocks away, even above the din of Pittsburgh traffic. Last Friday night, the sounds of bagpipes echoed off the steps of the Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall, enticing passersby to come in and attend the Carnegie Mellon School of Music’s Collage Concert.
The Collage Concert is an annual event that showcases performances from Carnegie Mellon’s major music ensembles, as well as solo performances by Carnegie Mellon’s students and faculty, with 21 performances in total. Before the concert on Friday began, Noel Zabler, the head of the School of Music, spoke to the audience and requested that they hold their applause until the very end of the concert. As he stepped off stage, the Kiltie Pipe Band began to march down the aisles of the hall, bagpipes blaring and drum mallets twirling. They lined up at the front of the hall and stood there to perform, all of the bagpipes playing perfectly in sync, before processing out of the hall.
As the concert continued, the audience members quickly realized why Zabler had requested they hold their applause until the end of the concert: The moment one musical group finished playing its piece, the spotlights would flash onto a different part of the stage, where a different group of performers would immediately begin playing. Despite Zabler’s request, there were several performances for which the audience seemed unable to hold back a burst of applause. One such performance was junior violinist Emma Steele’s performance of “Variations on an Original Theme,” by Henryk Wieniawski. Steele’s performance showcased both her incredible technical prowess and her artistic range, as her playing styles ranged from powerful to playful to sentimental.
Other highlights from the concert included “Parvis” by Bernard Andres, a harp duet performed by Natalie Severson and Vanessa Young (a sophomore music major and master’s candidate, respectively). Although most might associate harps solely with soothing, heavenly-sounding music, this piece proved that harps can play more than angelic arpeggios; the duet was quirky and mysterious and showcased the skills of both harpists. Similarly, the Carnegie Mellon Guitar Ensemble proved that there is more to the guitar than the chords one hears in pop songs with its performance of Leo Brouwer’s “Toccata.”
Some of the soloists’ song selections did not best showcase their talent; for example, William Caballero, an associate teaching professor of horn, is a talented player who has been the principal horn player in the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra for over 20 years. However, his piece, “Dance Fool Dance” by Paul Bassler, didn’t sufficiently showcase his skill. The piece, a contemporary composition, featured a backing track that sounded like a synthesized orchestra, which overwhelmed and distracted from Caballero’s performance.
The concert ended with “Promise of Living from The Tender Land” by Aaron Copland, performed by the Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic and Choirs. The piece was uplifting and sweet, evoking images of sunrises and rolling plains, and served as the perfect, heartwarming ending to an evening of spectacular talent.

An overseas experience is highly valued in our increasingly globalized community today. That is one of the many reasons why I pursue opportunities to go abroad. I understand that many students find it difficult to plan for a semester abroad, especially if their majors require on-campus core courses every semester. However, there are other opportunities. Last summer, for example, I had an overseas internship in Indonesia through the Freeman Indonesia Non-Profit Internship Program from the International Institute of Education. I worked with a non-profit organization in economic development and education.
Having gained a lot of invaluable experience from my first trip abroad, I continued to look for other opportunities to go overseas. A few weeks before spring break, I decided to participate in the Mechanical Engineering International Service Learning Experience to Jamaica. I had never been to Jamaica before and I did not know the conditions there at all, but that’s all part of the fun of going overseas: the excitement of exploring the unknown.
Along with a professor and a graduate student, 17 undergraduate students participated in this trip. When we first met in the Pittsburgh airport on the Wednesday night before spring break, we hardly knew each other. Yes, we might have seen each other around on campus or in class, but we had not had the chance to talk to one another. However, after spending 10 days together replacing a church’s rooftop and teaching young children about engineering, we became really close friends. Spending time overseas allows you to learn more about yourself and about the people you work with. In this way, the trip served as a platform for students to build their network among their peers.
In Jamaica, we worked in a small town called Dallas. According to the locals, it was established by the father of one of men who founded Dallas, Texas a few decades after. We are all students of Carnegie Mellon University, and we are used to working on a strict schedule — most of us have our entire days scheduled down to the hour. But in Jamaica, the locals prefer to go with the flow rather than working on a schedule. Our guide there told us a joke: “One day, a pilot called the control tower of an airport asking what time it was. The airport asked what airplane he was flying, and the pilot was confused why it would matter at all. The control tower answered: ‘If you are flying American Airlines, it is 3 p.m. If you are flying Austrian Airways it is 15:00. If you are flying Air Jamaica, it is Tuesday.’ ” It was freeing to realize that we did not have to follow a certain schedule, but we soon realized that if we did not get started on our work, we would never be able to finish our project.
Working on our project was also another challenge. Our group’s project was to replace a church roof that had been destroyed by a hurricane a few years ago. The project site was high up in the mountains, and we did not have enough tools for everyone to work effectively. We had limited electricity most of the time, so we only had limited access to power tools, like drills and circular saws. We had to do a lot of tasks manually, especially on top of the roof. To do so, we had to improvise and used our engineering knowledge to complete our projects. It was difficult to accomplish at first, but when everyone contributed different ideas, we could usually come up with a way that was relatively effective and safe to use. The locals were really eager to help — they would not think twice before climbing to the rooftop to help us. However, communication issues arose between us and misunderstandings often happened; finding a way to successfully work with the locals was therefore one of the unexpected challenges we faced.
Although English is the main language in Jamaica, the locals had a really unique accent that we found difficult to understand. What’s surprising is that it seems they did not have any problem understanding our English. The small children in the village spoke a dialect called Patois. It actually resembles a sort of Jamaican English, with a lot of slang and with the words mashed together. For instance, “move from here!” sounds more like “mofaya!” Although we had difficulties communicating with the children, it did not bother them at all; we managed to understand each other through our body language and we got along really well. It was heartbreaking to say goodbye on our last day, and we did not know what to say exactly when they asked when we would be back in Jamaica. We all knew that we might not see any of them again, but we just could not bring ourselves to say it.
The locals were often really grateful for simple things like being able to spend time with us, watching us perform in our talent show, or attending church services on Sundays. It struck me that while we were frantically chasing our dreams of success at Carnegie Mellon, they lived a “happier” life by being satisfied with what they had. I believe that this is the most important lesson that I learned from them. Even when we are busy challenging new heights in our daily lives, we should stop and reflect for a while about what we have achieved so far and be grateful for those achievements.

Greenberg
Thursday, March 24
10 12
Ben Stiller stars in this film as one of the most unlikeable characters of his career. That’s not to say, however, that Roger Greenberg is a man without charm. Stiller as Greenberg is a stern, often humorous, mentally ill man who tends to treat people, especially those whom he cares about most, like crap. When he moves from New York City to Los Angeles to house-sit for his brother and sort out his life, he almost immediately falls in love with his brother’s assistant, played by the brilliant Greta Gerwig — a woman with just as many neuroses as him.
Tron: Legacy
Friday, March 25
10 12:30
Praised for its elaborate Daft Punk soundtrack, Tron: Legacy transports audiences into an eye-catching virtual landscape. Sam Flynn, played by the young Garrett Hedlund, is the 27-year-old son of Kevin Flynn, a man who was once regarded as one of the world’s leading video game developers before his sudden and mysterious disappearance. While investigating his father’s disappearance, Sam finds himself sucked into the digital world where his father has been trapped for the past 20 years. With the help of Quorra, a digital warrior played by the always-gorgeous Olivia Wilde, father and son have to work together to defeat a world more advanced and villainous than its creator could ever have anticipated.
A Beautiful Mind
Saturday, March 26

This showing of A Beautiful Mind is being co-hosted with Psi Chi, the international honor society in psychology. The movie, directed by Ron Howard, tells the story of famed mathematician (and Carnegie Mellon alumnus) John Nash, played by Russell Crowe, and his struggles with mental health. As a professor at MIT, Nash begins to lose grip of reality and is eventually diagnosed with schizophrenia. This film’s greatest achievement is making the mind of the mentally compromised accessible to all audiences, and Crowe’s performance as Nash is undeniably one of the actor’s greatest. Admission to A Beautiful Mind is free.

100 YEARS AGO
March 22, 1911
The lead article trumpets the annual “home concert” of the school’s combined music clubs. “It is the hope of the management,” opines the stuffy prose, “that every student will make an effort to be present on this occasion.” The point is soundly made — most of The Tartan’s 16-page issue is devoted to the event.
50 YEARS AGO
March 15, 1961
The men of Alpha Tau Omega and the women of Delta Delta Delta appear in front-page photos as the winners of this year’s Greek Sing. Tri Delta performed music by Holst and a piece called “Les Charpentiers du Roi.” ATO countered with highbrow favorites “Roll on Monongahela” and “The Legend of Mike Fink.”

March 11, 1961
Scotland Yard — a student-run, non-alcoholic pub — announces expanded menu options and a new way of paying for them. The payment method, suggested by Carnegie Mellon’s President Cyert, is to label student tabs with their owners’ Social Security numbers, conveniently already printed on student IDs. We may need a few beers before we trust that security.

In exchange for “camera technology” used during the Super Bowl, CBS gives Carnegie Mellon two free 30-second commercial slots. The commercials, which aired this week, feature high school actors instead of real Carnegie Mellon students. The reason? CFA students were too busy.

March 27, 2006
The Public Art Committee reveals plans for the installation of “Walking to the Sky” on the Cut in front of Warner Hall, instead of on the Mall near Baker Hall as previously decided. Amid the controversy surrounding the 100-foot sculpture, School of Design head Dan Boyarski said, “Once you’ve gotten used to it, you’ll pass by it.”
ONE YEAR AGO
March 22, 2010
A smaller controversy brews — or perhaps fizzes — this week over Pittsburgh mayor Luke Ravenstahl’s proposal of a tax on sugar-sweetened drinks. The tax would have increased the cost of a two-liter bottle of Coke by $1.35.

In recent years, post-rock has been losing the innovative spark that had been its driving force. Though first rebelling against the vocally dominated, verse-chorus-verse song structure of rock, post-rock bands have now adapted the very sameness they hated. Every band I find seems to adhere to the same tired formula of constant intensity, wailing guitars, and an emotional need that rivals the cheesiest emo band. Instead of trying to recreate the canon, newer bands should focus on replicating the creativity of their predecessors.
Look at Godspeed You! Black Emperor. When you first hear their album Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven, it’s impossible not to cringe. The album has four songs that are divided into movements with names like “She Dreamt She Was a Bulldozer, She Dreamt She Was Alone in an Empty Field” and “Edgyswingsetacid.” There are multiple guitarists, bassists, drummers, and horn players plus a violinist and a cellist. You can’t help but expect the level of bombast that killed bands like Genesis and Yes.
But that fear never comes true. Like most post-rock bands, Godspeed You! Black Emperor focuses on aesthetic. But instead of the emotional hammer-over-the-head that much of post-rock has turned to, it opts for a more minimal approach. It is easy to forget that this is a nine-piece band, since few instruments play simultaneously. They proselytize with a restraint that is almost non-existent in post-rock, yet beneath the sparseness lies a frantic tension that festers and at times explodes with a force made even more astounding by its suddenness. It disappears as soon as it arrives, letting your mind try to figure out what you just listened to.
I’m not saying that all post-rock bands should become a nine-piece minimalist influenced musical leviathan. But post-rock needs to stop relying so much on the motifs that originally propelled it to the fringes of the mainstream. In order to establish a future, post-rock bands must look toward the past to shed their current shackles of conformity.

Dear Hoskins Brothers,
I have to pick my major soon and I still feel lost. I have interests in a few things, but I think that one of the things holding me back is that my potential major (something in H&SS) doesn’t get much respect at Carnegie Mellon or in the real world. How do I make my choice about my major while at the same time not letting the “H and less stress” stigma get to me?
Sincerely,
H&SS
Dear H&SS,
The other day, I was sitting at my desk, minding my own business, when I received an e-mail from my lovely editor. Inside was a question — a REAL question! My first real question! As the first person to actually come to me for advice, you will receive the grand prize: advice!
First of all, don’t make the mistake of confusing Carnegie Mellon and the real world. Outside, the world is run by liberal arts majors (cue the collective shudder from engineers). When choosing a major, you need to find something you’re interested in, something that inspires you — otherwise you’ll spend the rest of your life hating it. Talk to your advisor for ideas about majors. Every college has its own career counselor in the Career and Professional Development Center. Talk to yours for job advice.
At least you’re not in CFA,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Hoskins Brothers,
As a gay guy, I’m constantly getting girls running up to me begging me to be their gay best friend. It’s really annoying, but when I tell them to go away they just think I’m being sassy and keep bugging me. How can I get them to leave me alone?
Thanks,
Seriously Angry at Stupid Sisters
Dear SASS,
Ever since Sex and the City first introduced us to the gay best friend (or was it Will and Grace?), women everywhere have wanted one of their own. Apparently you are now an accessory. Congratulations.
First, try hanging out with a lot of straight guys. Nothing repels women more than straight Carnegie Mellon guys. If a girl manages to breach that first line of defense, you might have to hang out with her. She will unquestionably accept your fashion advice. Use this to your advantage. Dress her in ridiculous outfits, from jeggings all the way up to chicken suits. When she finally catches sight of a mirror, you’ll be kicked to the curb quicker than you can say “fabulous.”
Try to pass off some of those girls to your straight friends,
Brian Hoskins

In Japan, a record 9.0 magnitude earthquake hit the northeast coastal region followed by a tsunami that devastated areas such as the Miyagi and Fukushima Prefectures on March 11. This earthquake was the most devastating natural disaster to hit Japan since the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake.
As Japan’s government and local and international aid efforts work to bring food and supplies to survivors, the death toll has climbed to at least 7,197 with at least 18,000 missing, according to the BBC network and NHK World News. 
Over 400,000 citizens are living in relief centers while many face freezing temperatures, snow, and limited food and heat. 
International rescue teams from over 10 countries traveled to Japan, and over 70 countries offered aid.
One of the remaining fears is the state of damaged nuclear reactors, particularly the six at the Fukushima Daiichi plant 250 miles from Tokyo. Last Saturday morning, firefighters resumed pouring seawater into the third reactor, which was further damaged by a hydrogen explosion last Monday. 
The hope was to pour at least 1,260 tons of water into the reactor in seven hours, according to NHK World. The workers must also lower rising temperatures in the fifth and sixth reactors.
Efforts have been made to connect the reactors to a power line to restore cooling ability to the reactors and avert a potential nuclear meltdown. A mandatory evacuation zone of 20 kilometers was enforced by the Japanese government, with about 200 people experiencing radiation exposure. 
Japan’s Metropolis English Language Magazine reported a normal level of .176 microsieverts of radiation in Tokyo. However, as a cautionary measure, the United States embassy encouraged a voluntary evacuation of an 80 kilometer radius of the Fukushima plant and encouraged flights out of Japan for U.S. citizens last Friday.
The reactions of the country and Japanese people have been orderly in the face of crisis as a result of both culture and preparedness. Even in the hardest hit areas, lines for relief supplies were calm. Although residents of Tokyo purchased water and nonperishable foods, most citizens have returned to normal routines. The organized atmosphere and lack of looting are reflective of Japan’s social tradition, as expressed by Thomas Lifson in The American Thinker. Citizens are also cooperating with rolling blackouts by the Tokyo Electric Company that will continue into April.
“I think that the Japanese are generally well prepared for earthquakes, but this time the tsunamis were much more destructive than they had anticipated,” commented Yasufumi Iwasaki, an assistant teaching professor of Japanese at Carnegie Mellon.
Stephanie Guerdan, a junior Japanese major studying in Temple University’s Japan campus in Tokyo, noted the city’s atmosphere. “I’ve seen the lines outside grocery stores — stood in them, in fact — and people are all very courteous about waiting their turn.... The Japanese as a whole are very conscious about not inconveniencing others, so it would be unconscionable to storm grocery stores or riot,” Guerdan said. “The level of destruction [the disasters] caused in Miyagi and the surrounding prefectures is astounding and saddening.”
According to Temple University’s Japan campus website last Friday, the study abroad program has been suspended, and students are advised to return to the United States.
At the Carnegie Mellon campus in Pittsburgh, student organizations have initiated efforts to raise funds and awareness for Japan’s relief. In particular, graduate students from the Tepper School of Business and the Heinz College, and undergraduate students from the Japanese Student Association and the Pre-Law Society, held fundraisers in addition to other efforts. 
Keiji Matsunaga, a second-year graduate MBA student in Tepper, described current efforts as well as the reaction of the Carnegie Mellon community. “I was again reminded of the strength of our community, with so many students volunteering and asking for updates relating to this terrible tragedy. Other students have also contributed not only donations, but their time and efforts in folding origami cranes and bookmarks. So far, we have successfully gathered $2,700 at CMU,” Matsunaga said. 
Events will include a discussion today at 5:20 p.m. in Posner 151 hosted by Tepper MBA students, as well as live interaction with Tepper alumni in Japan. Donations will be accepted at the Gates Hilman Complex and Baker Hall on April 2 by the Japanese Student Association and at the International Film Festival by the Tepper School of Business.
Aki Iijima, a second-year student in the master of science for public policy and management program in the Heinz College, helped organize the Heinz graduate students’ participation in fundraising efforts. “I was frightened thinking I might lose my family, friends, and many loved ones, whose existences I took for granted,” Iijima said. “Even after they were fine, I was depressed since I could not do anything for them ... so I decided to launch a fundraising campaign with other Japanese friends in the Heinz School.”
Miki Bentz and Daiji Kano of the Japanese Student Association also expressed their initial reactions. They further described ongoing undergraduate fundraising efforts. 
Kano, a senior biological sciences major and the community liaison for the Japanese Student Association, expressed that “a combination of fear and worry started taking over me as I was unable to reach my relatives back home but was relieved to hear back from them a couple of hours later.” 
Bentz, a junior information systems and Japanese studies major, described some of the association’s fundraising efforts. “[The Japanese Student Association] actually already had a fundraiser planned for this week for St. Patrick’s Day, but on the day of the initial earthquake and tsunami, the board unanimously decided to continue the fundraiser, but donate all of the proceeds to earthquake relief.... The generosity of so many people over these past few days has been so touching.”
As the Japanese people continue their recovery and containment efforts, they draw upon a history of determination and unity in the face of hardship that will aid them in this difficult time.
Matsunaga summarized, “In Japan, there is a popular saying that pronounces ‘endurance and continuous efforts make you stronger.’ As we continue to increase our efforts in supporting the victims of Japan, in my heart, I truly know that we can all make a difference in overcoming this tragic disaster in the coming months, and arise an even stronger, closer global community for the future.”

The U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means granted an extension last Thursday on consideration of H.R. 3, a bill titled the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act. This is a hot-button issue that could permanently prohibit the public funding of abortion in the United States. 
According to the Guttmacher Institute, women aged 18–24 account for 44 percent of all abortions in the United States. The discourse on abortion among Carnegie Mellon students is especially dynamic. On Wednesday, March 2, the Carnegie Mellon Life Matters club hosted Serrin Foster, president of Feminists for Life of America (FFL). At the event, Foster presented her argument, “The Feminist Case Against Abortion.”
Foster, who stated that her goal was to “free women from abortion,” began her speech by defining feminism as a “two-century old tradition.” She argued that the now-revered feminists of the 19th century actually condemned abortion, in contrast to popular feminist groups today, such as the National Organization for Women (NOW), which heralded the Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade as “the emancipation of women.”
Foster cited the writings of early American feminists to portray her opinion of the true feminist movement’s stance on abortion. She explained that Susan B. Anthony’s newsletter, The Revolution, described abortion as “ ‘child murder,’ ‘infanticide,’ and ‘foeticide.’ ” Foster also quoted Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who wrote: “When you consider that women have been treated as property, it is degrading to women that we should treat our children as property to be disposed of as we see fit.” 
Foster further quoted American suffragette Alice Paul, who claimed: “Abortion is exploitation.”
“Anti-abortion laws enacted in the latter half of the 19th century were a result of advocacy efforts by feminists who worked in an uneasy alliance with the male-dominated medical profession and the mainstream media,” Foster said. “The early feminists understood that, much like today, women resorted to abortion because they were abandoned or pressured by boyfriends, husbands, and parents and lacked financial resources to have a baby on their own.”
Foster later arrived at the crux of her speech: describing the FFL’s efforts to support pregnant women. “Feminists for Life of America recognizes that abortion is a symptom of, not a solution to, the continuing struggles women face in the workplace, at home, and in society.... We can’t say we’re pro-life and not be pro-woman.” She talked about the FFL’s College Outreach Program, which offers assistance for college-aged women who are pregnant.
Of approximately 30 people in attendance at the lecture, many appeared to be members of the Life Matters Club. One member, Agnes Marszalik, a sophomore dual civil and environmental engineering and social and decision sciences major, said that she learned a lot from the talk. “We need to focus on women’s health issues a lot more. It doesn’t matter if you are pro-life or pro-choice. These resources are lacking in our school, in other schools, and to get these resources we need to work together ... so that if people want to choose life, they don’t have to think they have to drop out.”
Marszalik is one of the students planning a Pregnancy Resource Forum to take place at Carnegie Mellon this spring. Life Matters has asked Crisis Pregnancy Centers, Housing Services, and Health Services to provide resources at the upcoming forum.
Former President of Carnegie Mellon Life Matters Aimee Bedoy organized the discussion with Foster. Bedoy is a senior ethics, history, and public policy major. She described feminism as “the support of all human rights” and said she used to have a hard time being a feminist while simultaneously being pro-life. “In high school when I found out about Feminists for Life, from that moment on it was no longer a dichotomy. They were things that could work together. You can be for women’s rights and also for the rights of the unborn child. It is not mutually exclusive.
“So often women feel so pressured into abortion. Speaking from friends’ experiences and from my own personal experience, there have been people in my life who have been pressured to have an abortion — because of school, because of a career, because of the man in their life,” Bedoy said. “I’m really fed up with that. I really feel like abortion is often used as an exploitation of women. So there need to be structures in place so that women don’t feel that pressure, so that they can face whatever man or whatever society is telling them, ‘You can’t have a child right now,’ and say, ‘Look. There are resources for me. You can’t force me to have an abortion.’ ”
Jessica Dickinson Goodman, a fifth-year scholar studying ethics, history, and public policy, also attended the talk. She volunteers as an escort for Planned Parenthood of Western Pennsylvania, and has been doing so since she was a first-year. Her views of feminism opposed those of Foster and the FFL.
“The standard — and in my opinion the correct interpretation of every generation of feminists including Mary Wollstonecraft [and] Susan B. Anthony — is that you cannot make a feminist argument while simultaneously devaluing women,” said Goodman. “[It lowers] the value of women to that of a baby carriage.”
“The fundamental flaw in Feminists for Life, from my perspective ... is that any woman in her fertility cycle ... for those forty or so years of life, whether she is having sex consensually or is assaulted, can become pregnant at any time, and she may not have any choice about it,” Goodman said. “[It’s] the idea that you look a woman in the face who cannot take care of a child ... and say to her, ‘You are required to give your body over to the hormones and the weight gain, the violent contractions of birth, and the surgeries and the tearing part of it.’ Even if you have a pleasant birth, it’s still an overwhelming experience.... But the position that, at any point, at any time, any woman who is fertile can be required by the state to give her body over [to pregnancy] just ... boggles the mind — the limits on women’s potential.”
Bedoy interpreted the pro-choice stance: “There are two sides of this coin. There’s the ‘women don’t have resources’ aspect, which is something that we can fix. Then there’s also the more calloused view that ‘my career is more important than my child regardless of whether or not I have the resources to carry a child.’ So that’s something we can’t really speak to with more resources. It’s trying to help people realize that human life is present and valuable. That’s what Life Matters is all about: valuing all human life.”
Goodman said that, although their views differ, she has high respect for Foster and the work that she does with advocacy for women.
“I think it’s a great idea to empower women who are pregnant. One of [Foster]’s great points is that you don’t see pregnant women around campus,” Goodman said. “Well, all of us came from pregnant women; I don’t see how this is a shameful thing anymore in this day and age. Shaming a pregnancy is really bizarre and an anti-women stance.... I love the idea of women being around and being pregnant because pregnancy is so joyful when it’s chosen.”
Carnegie Mellon Life Matters will host an event titled “Perspectives of a Former Abortionist: A Dialogue on Reproductive Rights” tonight at 6:30 p.m. in Porter Hall 125C, with guest speaker Dr. John Bruchalski, M.D.

With a flash of their ID cards, Carnegie Mellon students can gain access to a multitude of museums in the Pittsburgh area for free, courtesy of the Carnegie Mellon Arts Pass program. However, the program — which has played a role in Carnegie Mellon’s academic and cultural life for the past 10 years — is currently in need of funding.
Any student can sign in and show his or her ID to enter the museums. The university, however, pays monthly fees based on the number of students using the program. Initially, Student Senate, Student Dormitory Council (SDC), Graduate Student Assembly, the College of Fine Arts (CFA), and the Division of Student Affairs all equally contributed $5,000 to the program, creating a yearly budget of $25,000. However, as more students began to utilize the program, the costs began to steadily increase. Currently, the price tag of the program is $60,000 per year, with the Division of Student Affairs picking up the additional $35,000 in costs.
The Division of Student Affairs is currently looking for different funding sources and evaluating new ways to cover the cost of admission. Sohini Roy, a sophomore materials science and engineering major, is an active member of both Student Senate and SDC. As a result, she is keenly aware of the budget realities. “I really hope we can keep the program alive, despite the many adversities,” Roy said. “I am passionate about its ability to give students a unique college experience and enlightenment.”
Sarah Horner, a first-year chemistry major, is a member of SDC and a Pittsburgh native. Having the opportunity to utilize the Arts Pass program has given her the freedom to explore the history and culture of Pittsburgh. “Having free access to the museums has definitely opened my eyes to all of the history that Pittsburgh has to offer,” Horner said.
Initially created by CFA to allow its students to gain access to the Pittsburgh museums for academic reasons, the Arts Pass program was soon opened to the entire Carnegie Mellon student body.
Eileen Angulo, who took over administration for the program in 2008, explained, “CFA decided to open access to the entire student body because it believed that access to museums is a part of a student’s education — maybe not the same as a problem set, but another important part of the learning experience.”
However, she added, “As the program gained more popularity, covering the cost of admission has become an ongoing problem.”
Currently, the Division of Student Affairs is considering multiple options to cover the price tag for admission.
There was not much data on who was utilizing the Arts Pass program until 2009, when students were required to sign in with both their college and expected year of graduation when they entered museums. 
Since then, data tracking has shown that there is a diverse group of students using the museums. In light of this data, the Division of Student Affairs is considering approaching other colleges within Carnegie Mellon to see if they would be interested in contributing to the program’s budget.
“If, say, it was the same 200 students from CFA going 20 times per year, the fact that CFA is the only college currently covering the cost would make sense. However, the data has shown that CIT has a similar [level] of use,” Angulo said.
A second option being considered is adding a media fee to students’ tuition in order to help pay for continued use of the program.
The future of the Arts Pass program is currently up in the air. “Depending on who you talk to, you will get a different opinion on where it’s going,” Angulo said. 
However, she personally believes that students attending museums should not pay at the door. “Whatever solution ends up working for the upcoming year is what we do five years from now. I don’t want students to become frustrated with the program if it changes year to year.”
Angulo encourages students to speak up if they find this program valuable. “They should speak with their professors and at general body meetings of SDC and make this topic a reoccurring conversation. The more conversation happens, the more people will take note, and that could encourage more contributions to [the Arts Pass program].”

Amy Kao, a junior business administration major, was one of five college undergraduates across the nation to win $10,000 from the Liberty Mutual Responsible Scholars program.
“I just got home, and all of a sudden the phone rings, and it’s Liberty Mutual,” Kao said. “I was really shocked and surprised, because I never expected this.”
The annual Liberty Mutual Responsible Scholars program awards five college undergraduates $10,000 scholarships applicable to the next academic year. According to the program’s website, “People get opportunities to do responsible things everyday. And when a small act grows into a big result, it deserves recognition.”
Kao was recognized in particular for founding the Carnegie Mellon chapter of People to People International (PPI), a non-profit organization that promotes international understanding through volunteer activities and international travel. 
Since the chapter’s start in 2008, the student organization has engaged in a variety of service activities, including setting up benefit concerts, tutoring elementary school students, and holding leadership workshops for victims of domestic violence.
“Being responsible and doing the right thing often takes extra effort,” said Maura Quinn, University Relations Program Manager for Liberty Mutual Group. “Every day thousands of students make the extra effort to reach beyond themselves to make a difference in someone else’s life. This scholarship recognizes and rewards students like Amy for working hard to do the right thing.”
But for Kao, there is nothing “extra” about her effort. “You don’t have to be ambitious. You just have to be determined,” she said. “If you have the right attitude when approaching a problem, that attitude and passion will carry you through the entire process.”
This philosophy was ingrained in Kao as a child by her mother, who taught Amy how to play the piano. 
“Playing a 25-page piece when you’re five years old trained a lot of my persistence and determination in life,” explained Kao, who played in Carnegie Hall at age 8. “Sometimes you don’t want to do it ... but you develop this flow that carries you through, and this flow has really helped me throughout life.”
Kao describes her philanthropic efforts as her own little twist on this flow, although she adds that she was taught how music and community service work hand in hand.
“My mom realized halfway through her college [that] it’s not healthy to always concentrate on bettering yourself for the next performance when you could share your love for music with others. That’s when she changed majors from music performance to music education,” explained Kao. “At a very young age, my mom ingrained in me this idea of helping others as a way of life.”
With this natural flow and goals of philanthropy, Kao sees her scholarship more as a means for further good than an end in of itself. “I’m glad that I’ve been recognized ... but I want this to be more of a celebration of what’s to come in the future,” she said. “Right now, I see Liberty Mutual making a positive investment in me ... and in the future, I hope to return this investment.”

University seeks to expand research programs into N.Y.
Carnegie Mellon has developed partnerships with New York University, the University of Toronto, City University of New York, and IBM. The partnerships have resulted in preliminary steps toward creating research and education programs in New York City.
New York’s mayor, Michael Bloomberg, is especially interested in establishing stronger ties with Carnegie Mellon and other research universities across the nation. 
Carnegie Mellon’s interests are in two areas: a digital media program and a “Smart City” program that will be led by New York University. 
The proposed media program will be aimed at building upon entertainment technologies while the “Smart City” program, though led by New York University, will be strengthened by Carnegie Mellon’s research in intelligent transportation systems as well as smart infrastructure.
Carnegie Mellon officials expect that if a concrete decision is made after this preliminary process, the activity in New York might lead to enhanced research funding for its faculty. 
Moreover, they hope the partnership will ultimately increase opportunities to attract companies to Pittsburgh.
Officials commented that the university is only in an exploration phase and any decision concerning expansion to New York is months away.
ChangeCar project team to unveil new electric vehicle
Researchers at Carnegie Mellon plan to unveil a solely electric-powered 2002 Honda Civic, a prototype for their ChargeCar Electric Vehicle Conversion Project. 
People who want to purchase their own converted vehicle can attend an open house from 3 to 6 p.m. on March 25 at the Electric Garage, located in Oakland.
The ChargeCar project is part of the university’s Robotics Institute’s CREATE Lab. Researchers are working with local mechanics to develop methods and the necessary components for converting cars into electric-powered, commuting vehicles. Initial efforts have focused on 2001–05 models of Honda Civics.
“For now, you can electrify any car you want — as long as it’s a Honda Civic,” said Illah Nourbakhsh, associate research professor of robotics and head of the CREATE Lab, in a press release. 
He further commented that other models and car brands will be converted as the project progresses and grows. In addition to Nourbakhsh, the co-directors of ChargeCar are Ben Brown and Gregg Podnar, technical staff members of the Robotics Institute.
The open house will provide an opportunity for people to test-ride the newly converted vehicles and talk to the research team, as well as the project’s mechanics.

St. Patrick’s Day was last Thursday. People everywhere sported articles of green clothing. Traditional Irish food, such as soda bread, corned beef, and cabbage were in abundance. Originally a religious holiday to honor Saint Patrick, who introduced Christianity to Ireland in the fifth century, St. Patrick’s Day has evolved into a celebration for all things Irish. Here are some facts about the holiday:
250,000: number of marchers in the 2011 New York St. Patrick's Day parade
13: average number in millions of pints of Guinness consumed on St. Patrick’s Day
390: the year Saint Patrick was born
1737: the year that St. Patrick's Day customs first came to America

This past week, we were dismayed to see the Fence painted with University of Pittsburgh colors and statements such as “Go Panthers” and “CMU sucks.” Traditionally, the act of painting the Fence in the dead of night and then guarding it during the day has united the campus and allowed different student organizations to advertise for worthy causes and student events. The Fence has served as the giver of good news, exclaiming marriage proposals and birthday wishes. In addition, it has served as a solemn campus-wide reminder of the more serious aspects of life, mourning those who died too early and calling the community to action in the wake of national and international crises. In light of the significant messages written on the Fence over the years, we feel that anyone — Carnegie Mellon student, Pitt student, or others — must know and respect the traditions surrounding the Fence.
Initially, we were angered that one of Carnegie Mellon’s long-standing traditions was defaced in this way. However, the more we lingered on the topic, the more we realized that this act, whether it was done as a light-hearted prank or out of anger, clearly shows the lack of respect that some Carnegie Mellon and Pitt students have for one another. It is not uncommon for different campuses, especially those situated side by side, to develop rivalries with and stereotypes about each other. One would not have to look hard on our campus to find a perpetuation of these degrading stereotypes. Carnegie Mellon students and professors frequently joke about the lack of intelligence on the Pitt campus, or lament that all the attractive kids go to Pitt and get to start drinking during the middle of the week. This automatic labeling of Pitt students as stupid and lazy, or Carnegie Mellon students as anti-social and geeky, needs to stop.
As long as we continue to think this way and try to fit a whole campus into a tiny, stereotype-wrought box, instances like the defamation of the Fence will continue as well. If our campus and Pitt’s decide to put aside stereotypes and instead establish a relationship, the possibilities are endless. How many community service projects and fundraisers would be more effective and reach a greater number of people if our two universities worked together?
City wide service opportunities like Carnegie Mellon’s yearly 1000plus could be an opportunity for collaboration between our university and Pitt. Student and Greek organizations from both campuses could sign up together to participate in service projects that relate to their interests. 
In this way the two campuses could strengthen their relationship and make an impact on the Pittsburgh community. Neither school can control how the other acts, but for our part, we as a student body can strive to break down stereotypes between Carnegie Mellon and Pitt and build a mutual respect that will serve both campuses well in the future.

The recent series of disasters that has plagued Japan — an earthquake, then a tsunami, then a nuclear power plant crisis — has fostered international compassion for the victims. The global community has shown its dedication to help the country on a similar scale to the relief provided to Haiti after the devastating earthquake that hit it last January.
Aside from global dedication to relief efforts in regard to Haiti, we saw local action toward relief efforts right here at Carnegie Mellon. Within a week of the earthquake, Carnegie Mellon had put together a Dollar Campaign (where each student was asked to donate just one dollar to the campaign), participated in a Wear Red for Haiti Day, held a prayer service for the victims of the earthquake, and held a candlelight vigil in addition to the relief efforts hosted by individual student organizations.
In contrast, Carnegie Mellon’s response to the current crisis in Japan has been minimal at best. After a single newsletter from President Cohon and some concentrated efforts by Carnegie Mellon’s Silicon Valley campus, not much has been done on an administrative or student level to raise relief for Japan.
In the past week, we have seen many citizens putting forth a concerted effort to aid the Japanese in recovering from the disasters. Some citizens are driving the donation effort to the Red Cross and other charitable groups; similarly, the United States military was quick to offer its military bases in Japan as relief centers. Even some corporations are doing their part by offering special services, like AT&T’s offer of free calls and texting from the U.S. to Japan.
Over a week has passed since the 9.0-magnitude earthquake and the tsunami hit Japan, yet the campus response has remained weak with only one or two student organizations selling baked goods and the like in an effort to raise relief funds. Another Dollar Campaign for Japan and other large scale relief fundraisers would not be remiss. We know the campus is capable of great compassion because it a little over a year since Haiti’s crisis. We hope that Carnegie Mellon and its students can step up to the plate again and show the world our desire to help and our capacity to give.

With thousands of lives lost during the March 11 earthquake and tsunami disaster in Japan, onlookers abroad as well as citizens of the island nation are still trying to get a grasp on what dangers lie ahead. As of Saturday morning, the official number of dead or missing victims was around 18,000, and with several disputed opinions regarding the true threat of the damaged nuclear power plants along the nation’s coast, it is still unclear as to whether more lives will be compromised. 
Many proponents of nuclear energy both in the United States and all over the world have publicly stated that the threats of radiation exposure and possible explosion surrounding the Japanese power plants have been highly and wrongly publicized, arguing instead that the risks are in actuality much less than reported. That being said, many journalists and professionals have argued the exact opposite. All in all, it seems as if the reports of those investigating the dangers surrounding the power plants have been, whether intentionally or not, highly influenced by personal politics: Given several mixed reports, those attempting to get a grasp of the reality of the situation in Japan have so far been unable to do so.
Here in the United States, those politicians and executives in favor of a gradual nationwide transition to nuclear energy have wasted no time defending the risk surrounding the nuclear plants and process. Executives from Southern Co., the U.S. group at the head of the national push for nuclear energy, have been scrambling all week to cut political damage and limit the plummet of stocks. When asked about the Atlanta-based company’s intention to break ground on its first batch of a new generation of nuclear reactors, Southern Co. spokesman Todd Terrell said, “We do not anticipate that events in Japan will impact our construction schedule or our ability to stay on budget.” Several proponents of nuclear energy have made claims about making the process safer, like writer Kevin Bullis of Technology Review who pointed out that Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi plant is a “Generation II” plant, which means it requires the circulation of water to cool the reactors — a convention that newer generation models do not require. Several journalists and politicians in favor of nuclear energy have continued to make arguments that, in their ignorance, have only hurt the pro-nuclear energy argument. The editors of The Wall Street Journal, for example, made the argument that all human endeavors are “fraught with risk,” so this one incident of catastrophe is no reason to unfairly enforce “artificial obstacles and delay.”
Whatever your politics, there is no denying that green energy advocates in the U.S. have an incomparable opportunity ahead of them. With fossil fuel sources quickly depleting, our nation has been urgently searching for a energy alternative, and those in favor of a gradual (and noticeably more expensive) transition into clean energy have the responsibility to use the most recent events in Japan to their favor. That’s not to say that green energy enthusiasts have not yet made their opinions about nuclear energy known through their comments regarding Japan. “It’s another example of what we have been saying,” said Stephen Smith, executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. “Nuclear power is not inherently unsafe, but it is inherently unforgiving.”
This, however, doesn’t seem to be enough. Several other countries have taken recent events in Japan as a sign to postpone nuclear expansion. Switzerland announced a freeze on any plants in the process of being constructed or updated, while Germany delayed its decision to refurbish the nation’s nuclear facilities by three months.
President Obama has repeatedly supported nuclear energy, an opinion that has put him in direct opposition with the majority of Democratic candidates. His home state of Illinois has more nuclear plants than any other state in the U.S., as it is the headquarters of Exelon, which operates the country’s largest collection of nuclear power plants. Obama has always campaigned for nuclear energy — in his State of the Union speech this year, Obama presented a goal of generating 80 percent of the country’s electricity from clean energy sources by 2035. Nuclear energy already accounts for 20 percent of the nation’s energy; however, in his budget Obama allocated a $36 billion government loan to guarantee that new plants be built. Furthermore, CNN reported that with their new design these new plants would be able to withstand at most a 7.0-magnitude earthquake — which barely compares to the 9.0-magnitude earthquake that hit Japan.
Green energy advocates have the responsibility to ensure that proponents of nuclear energy do not cast this disaster off as an unfortunate but atypical incident. By learning from the truly disheartening events in Japan, we can ensure that the United States either seriously heightens security and safety measures within nuclear plants or begins its transitional investment in other green energy sources.

University faculty members have a fine line to walk. In general, they must satisfy the dual roles of researcher and instructor, maintaining respect both from their fellow professors and from the students they teach. Even when professors are not in an academic setting, their activities can reflect upon the university. It might be hard to see one’s physics professor in quite the same light after seeing her at Panther Hollow Inn. Consider, then, seeing that professor in a burlesque show. According to John F. Kennedy University in Pleasant Hill, Calif., that is crossing the line.
Sheila Addison was a professor at JFK University who also performed as a dancer in a burlesque show. After the university’s administration discovered this, they fired Addison for bringing “public disrespect, contempt and ridicule to the university,” according to a complaint Addison filed in federal district court. Addison went on to claim that a male professor who performed in a similar show faced no disciplinary action. We see this termination as unjust interference by the university in Addison’s personal life, and we are dismayed by the alleged gender discrimination. We have one main problem with Addison’s termination. Her outside activities were not affecting her pedagogical work. 
She did not advertise about her burlesque performances on campus and kept them strictly separated from her academic life, according to court documents as reported by Inside Higher Ed. The university administrators even seem to recognize this, since their cause for Addison’s termination did not mention teaching or research, but was based on citations of public disrespect and ridicule. Even if Addison herself were the subject of contempt for her performances, no reasonable person could transfer that blame to the university for an activity that was clearly outside her role there.
At Carnegie Mellon, the faculty and administration have established standards of conduct both in academic and non-academic settings. These standards, found in the official university policies and in the Faculty Handbook, make it clear that faculty members can be terminated only if they have substantially neglected their duties, demonstrated incompetence or moral turpitude, or otherwise committed some egregious offense. The handbook advises faculty members to “participate like other citizens in community affairs,” provided they clearly identify themselves as individuals separate from the university. This is a sensible guideline, and one that simultaneously upholds the university’s ideals while protecting the freedom of faculty members. 
While we are disturbed by Addison’s case in California, we are confident that Carnegie Mellon’s commitment to free speech and free action on the part of students and faculty would prevent such an injustice from happening here.

An unprecedented event has taken place — the University of the South (Sewanee), a liberal arts college in rural Tennessee, has decided to cut tuition for next semester by a staggering 10 percent. The school’s president, John McCardell, said that this was a move to counter the fact that higher education is on the verge of pricing itself beyond the reach of American families. In a world where colleges routinely increase tuition year by year without much regard for students’ expenses and financial burdens, this seems like a very heartening decision. But dig deeper and one finds that cutting college tuition is only beginning to scratch at the surface of the problem.
First, cutting tuition will mean that Sewanee has less money to fund its aid and scholarship programs. Cutting tuition by 10 percent has almost no impact on the 30 percent or so of students whose parents will just buy that new boat or maybe renovate a kitchen. Yes, average middle-class students are helped, but a short-term publicity stunt like this will only aid them for a year or two. In contrast, it would make more sense to let the rich keep paying the same price and use that money to fund lower-income students. Has Sewanee really thought about what happens when they are forced to increase tuition 8 percent for the next three years to make up for their short-sightedness? Who pays then?
Second, simply cutting the price of college does not reduce the costs. Sewanee is not cutting salaries or streamlining programs — it is simply trying to increase awareness and applications (demand) by reducing the price at which its product is up for sale. The “problem” with the education system is not that the price of college is too much — the costs are too high. Too many professors have tenure or too much money is spent on research. Cutting prices does not solve the root of the problem.
Third and lastly, colleges should not adjust prices based on economic downturns and upturns. The education that a college provides, at least in theory, should not depend on when you are learning it. When I started college in fall 2007, I knew it would cost me about $220,000. I knew this because in my freshman year I paid about $51,000 and the admission letter said I should expect fees to grow by about 5 percent each year. 
Now imagine that the price of college depended on how the economy was doing: Anyone who went to school between 2003 and 2007 would have ended up paying over $500,000 because the market was doing so well. Then as soon as they graduated, and after spending all this money, they would be left penniless because of the sub-prime mortgage crisis. Similarly, students graduating in 2013 are going to be better off than those graduating in 2009 simply because of the state of the economy, not because of their abilities or their education and certainly not because of how much they paid for college.
Finally, this brings us to Carnegie Mellon. Last month, Carnegie Mellon’s Board of Trustees agreed to increase tuition for incoming first-years by 3.97 percent. The annual tuition now stands at the grotesquely large $43,160. In isolation, this number provokes anger and despair — why do we pay so much money?
But this was one of the smallest percentage increases in tuition in years. The goal is long-term stability in prices, not short-term spikes in order to secure publicity. Yes, Carnegie Mellon consistently ranks in the top 20 most expensive colleges in the country, but that does not mean that the Board of Trustees should go crazy and start cutting tuition. 
Whatever its approach, it should start by looking at costs and not aimlessly cutting prices.

For the international news media, the last couple months have been fantastic. Among unrest in the Middle East, revolution in North Africa, the continuing disaster coverage in Japan, and NATO military intervention in Libya, the stream of breaking news has been unending. Large, bold headlines have continuously dominated the CNN and New York Times homepages. As a result of these high-profile international stories, a story has flown under the radar: the announcement of the New York Times’ web billing plan. Readers and observers have been anticipating the announcement for months, since the Times is a standard that many other publications are likely to follow. 
Despite my reluctance to pay for access to a product that is currently free to everyone, I am convinced that the new business model is the right decision for the Times, for the journalism industry, and for the public as a whole.
Simply put, the Times’ paywall will restrict non-subscribers to 20 articles per month while subscriptions will range from $15 to $35 per month, depending on the other packaged products, such as a smartphone app. This business model is similar to the one used successfully by the Financial Times.
There has, of course, been an outcry against the introduction of a fee system. Why, critics ask, should readers bother to pay for Times articles when there are plenty of bloggers and journalists posting their thoughts for free?
That question is precisely the reason why the Times should be charging for its product, no matter the medium. Would one rather read an ill-written and likely erroneous blog, or a well-written, clear and concise article from a reliable source?
The answer seems obvious: editorial expertise and reliable sources are worth paying for. The world-changing events of the last month underscore the need for a strong revenue stream. When there is revolution in Africa, the public needs the Times and its fellow professional publications to have the money to deploy experienced reporters and photographers. No solitary blogger in the United States can have the same resources of depth of knowledge as a news outlet with bureaus around the world.
It might be easy on a slow news day to wonder what justifies paying for a New York Times subscription every month. But when the world is in chaos, professional and well-funded journalists help us to sort it out. 
That is a service worth paying for.

When Alexandra Wallace, the now infamous UCLA student responsible for the “Asians in the Library” YouTube rant, posted her racist tirade and it blew up overnight, my brothers’ reactions were largely jubilant. After all, stupidity is hilarious, and there are some quality Auto-Tune remixes floating around. Plus, the nation’s sweeping yet immediate recognition of her words as out of line feels like something of a victory for an Asian-interest group like Lambda Phi Epsilon. “Ohhh! Ching chong ling long” is no longer socially acceptable, and we should be proud of that.
But while Asians across the Internet and here at home responded almost entirely with humor, I couldn’t help but sense a real anger in many of the response videos. Some people were just plain mean. And no one admitted that Wallace might possibly have a point with library rudeness. 
Why so serious? I wondered, theorizing that perhaps it was just the tsunami comment that did her in. Then, charter brother Lex Su offered this personal insight: “I think every subgroup in our country has a deep, underlying insecurity. For me, as an Asian-American, it’s the feeling that no matter what I do, I will always be a foreigner, a temporary American whose allegiance is to his ancestral homeland. That I was born in the United States (Brooklyn), that I speak perfect English, that I attended American public schools all cannot wash away the perception that I do not belong. Reminders abound: a friend asking whether I’m cheering for the U.S. or the Chinese Olympic team; an elderly lady politely asking me where I’m ‘really from’; an elderly man lauding my people for ‘working hard and showing Americans how it’s done.’ Excuse me, sir, but I’m American. Sorry ma’am, I’m really from Brooklyn.” 
This girl is not a racist because she’s annoyed by family visits or cell phone usage. Do we not reserve our funniest burns and most honest criticism for those with whom we share mutual respect? Minorities cannot expect to be treated as equals in society if they stigmatize jokes and critique, and the Asian community’s problem with this girl stems not from the fact that she is critical of her fellow classmates. Wallace erred by crossing the line into jerk territory, incorporating willful ignorance and condescension into her grievances. Her tsunami comment is so mindblowing that it merits its own article. And, come on, “Ting tong”? That’s what’s racist here, not her call-out of inconsiderate Asians. She doesn’t say it, but her tone practically shouts out, “Even if you address these issues, you still aren’t my peers.” That’s why she hit a nerve with the Asian community. As a white kid with cultural privilege, a majority member, I hadn’t quite understood. But I get it now. I get why so many Asian students felt the need to respond. It’s about wanting to belong.
For reasons perhaps not fully justified but certainly understandable, Wallace’s life as she knew it is over — good luck getting hired, kid. What’s worse, she won’t even get the one reasonable concession she wanted in the first place. Who could possibly see her walk into a library and keep his or her mouth shut?

A recent study indicated a 5 percent increase in abstinence among young adults. Do students at CMU think abstinence is realistic?
