The NBA Finals wrapped up last Sunday, and King James reclaimed his throne as he took home his fourth championship trophy and fourth Finals MVP trophy at an astounding age of 35, proving all of the critics who proclaimed him “washed up” wrong. The blowout win in Game 6 brought the Lakers their 17th all-time title, tying the Celtics for the most of any franchise (but not really, since some of those titles were under the previous Minnesota Lakers team, before becoming the LA Lakers). LeBron had a triple-double in the final game, further cementing his unanimous Finals MVP award. He didn’t do it all on his own, though — one must not discredit fellow teammate and stud Anthony Davis who played phenomenally for most of the series and the entire playoffs, averaging 27.7 points and 9.7 rebounds in the postseason this year. It’s hard to believe he’s only 27, with so many years in the league and undoubtedly many more to come. 
One must also not discount the Miami Heat, especially Jimmy Butler. Butler's game score was the third-highest of a non-Finals-MVP player ever, behind only LeBron in 2017 and 2018. He averaged 22.2 points per game in the postseason, not far from his 22.5 point average in the Finals, where he played nearly every minute. As if I need to say more, Butler became the second player in history to lead his team in every major statistic in the Finals, sharing the achievement again with LeBron, and the second player to record multiple 30-point triple-doubles in the Finals, sharing the record again with Lebron.
Butler’s amazing playoff performance reflects that of the entire team. The underdog Heat made an incredible run, knocking out the number 1 seed with ease, pushing past the Celtics with pure grit, and giving the Lakers a solid series. The young talent on this team is extremely promising, and the Heat are going to be contenders for the foreseeable future. 
The Lakers routed the Heat in the first game, and everyone was ready to confirm what they had suspected — the Heat were tough, but they would be no match for this Lakers team. James neared a triple-double, and Davis put up 34 points. Combined with the Heat missing critical players in center, such as Bam Adebayo (shoulder) and veteran guard Goran Dragic (foot), they stood no chance.
The Game 2 Laker victory, although closer, was further proof of the Heat’s ineffectuality against the Lakers. The Heat were missing Adebayo on defense, allowing the Lakers to shoot 33-50 on two-pointers and amass 68 points by halftime, and they missed Dragic on offense, too, with the team struggling to get in a flow. Despite this, Butler was almost able to put up a triple-double, but it wasn’t enough to overcome LeBron and Davis’ 65 combined points.
The Heat were enough in Game 3, however, when Butler played possibly the best game of his career. With a line of 40-13-11, he became just the third player in history to have a 40 point triple-double in the Finals, playing without Adebayo and Dragic too. The performance drew praise from Lebron, who called him “one of the best competitors we have in this game.”
The Lakers took back control in Game 4 with help from Davis’ lockdown defense on Butler in the fourth quarter and a clutch late-game string of points from veteran Kentavious Caldwell Pope. Despite the defense, Butler still pulled off an almost triple-double, but he didn’t have enough help to beat out LeBron, who was also close to a triple-double.
Butler came through again in Game 5, playing 46 of the 48 total minutes and putting up a massive 35-12-11 game while shooting perfect from the line and scoring 9 of the Heat’s last 11 points. Despite this, the Lakers were close, with the game coming down to a potentially series-winning three-pointer from Danny Green which missed, leaving the Heat with a 110-108 win and a real series on their hands. 
Unfortunately, the series basically ended after Game 5. Game 6 was over before it started. Behind yet another triple-double from LeBron, the Lakers led from start to finish, steamrolling to a 106-93 victory and a 17th franchise championship.
Although this may not have been the most thrilling finals ever, the entire playoffs tell us something exciting about the league: it can belong to any team. Unlike the majority of the last 5 years, the NBA now has a multitude of promising teams and players that will make basketball very fun to watch for the foreseeable future.

I’m not here today to restart the Greatest-of-All-Time (GOAT) argument between LeBron James and Michael Jordan. Even though LeBron has won four titles, he is still nowhere near Jordan’s six. Plus, Jordan is perfect with no NBA Finals losses compared to LeBron’s six.  
While James may not necessarily win the GOAT debate against Jordan, James earns more of my admiration than Jordan. Why? Actually, it’s quite simple: perseverance. Throughout their careers, both players have been dealt their fair share of bad hands; however, LeBron has done more with his bad hands. 
When drafted by the Chicago Bulls in 1984, Jordan went to a terrible team, but a great city with plenty of exposure and zeal to attract other players. While people knew him from his college days at Chapel Hill, Jordan faced less pressure as the players drafted before him, like Rockets’ center Hakeem Olajuwon, garnered much more attention. Meanwhile, when LeBron was taken first in 2003 by Cleveland, he went to not only a terrible team but a small city with less of a chance to attract free agents. In addition, LeBron was under pressure as he was already all over Sports Illustrated and was expected to be the “Hometown Savior” for his Cavs at the age of 18. 
Early in their careers, both players took the league by storm. In the playoffs, the stars were no different on the stat sheet. However, LeBron started winning earlier than Jordan. While both players had terrible supporting casts around them, LeBron found a way to take his team to the NBA Finals by 2007. Meanwhile, Jordan couldn’t win a playoff series without Scottie Pippen. Even once Pippen arrived, Jordan and the Bulls still struggled as they were constantly unable to beat the “Bad Boys” Detroit Pistons to get their ticket to the NBA Finals until Scottie Pippen could hold back the physical strength of the Pistons’ defense in 1991, seven years after Jordan was drafted.
After making their first finals, Jordan and James got different responses from management. The Chicago Bulls fully committed to Jordan, getting him the necessary piece to build a dynasty. In the meantime, LeBron faced a Cavs’ management that constantly seemed to undermine him as they tried to save money instead of winning titles. This poor leadership style forced LeBron to leave for Miami in 2010 as it became impossible for him to win a title in his hometown.
Moving to Miami in 2011, LeBron got a competent management team and two other stars in Dwanye Wade and Chris Bosh, but at the same time, he earned the ire of the NBA public. Overnight, he had to deal with being the villain of the league. In addition, the expectation was title or bust immediately for a mostly new team. Jordan, on the other hand, had consistency with a Hall-of-Fame coach in Phil Jackson versus the instability of James’ coaches. 
When both players won titles, the public treated each player differently. When Jordan and the Bulls beat an aged Lakers team in 1991, he was given mass admiration and joy from the fans. On the contrary, when James and the Heat beat a superstar Thunder team in 2011 with three future Hall of Famers, most of his fans were still critical, arguing he should have won the title earlier. 
In addition, as each player pursued titles, both had very different challenges in the NBA Finals. LeBron has been forced to face a dynasty thrice (the Spurs) and a superteam four times (the Warriors). Oftentimes, the other roster has been better coached and better equipped than LeBron’s. Yet, he has found a way to win four times. Even when he has come up short, he has forced great teams to the brink. Meanwhile, Jordan has never had to face a superteam or dynasty. Rather, he has faced teams with one star player (Magic and the Lakers, Drexler and Trail Blazers, Barkley and the Suns, etc.) who were often not quite as good as Jordan. 
Finally, the greatest difference between Jordan and James is their off-court action. Outside of his playing ability, Jordan has a poor reputation, getting caught gambling and drinking profusely. Meanwhile, LeBron built greatness for those in his community. For instance, he built the IPromise school in Akron, Ohio. In addition, he has used his platform to advocate for Black lives everywhere, calling for change constantly where Jordan is famously apolitical. While Jordan may be the GOAT on the court, LeBron has proven to be the GOAT off the court and the more admirable player. 
When the book closes on LeBron’s career, the impact he’ll leave on the game of basketball will be greater than that of Jordan.

In December 2018, the Delhi Capitals were born from their rather unsuccessful parent, the Delhi Daredevils. Having bagged the wooden spoon four consecutive times, they needed to turn their game around. In 2018, they looked towards a superstitious name change, a brand new logo, and a completely different team composition. Ahead of the following season, they released close to ten players, the most by any team. Teams like the Kings XI Punjab need that reset now, but few have the courage to take that plunge and start afresh. But Capitals co-owner Parth Jindal was audacious. He wanted the Capitals’ name to symbolize the center of action: a ruling force paralleling Delhi’s powerful influence in the Indian government.
The Delhi Capitals’ journey has spanned over a decade. In their inaugural season back in 2008, they were led by a fiery Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir, who were in blistering form. With the legendary Glenn McGrath, Mahroof, and the underrated Amit Mishra all on fire with the ball, you would think the team had everything going for them, and rightly so — they reached their first ever semi-final that year. Against the Rajasthan Royals, the Capitals started off poorly, conceding over 190 runs. We need to keep the time period in mind while analyzing this statistic: despite how batsmen-friendly cricket has become, with pitches that feel like roads, kits carrying bats with thicker edges, and shorter boundaries being adopted almost everywhere, 180+ is still a mammoth score to chase down even to this day. In short, this was a disaster, but there was the potential that it could be overcome by the batting greats they had. Maybe, just maybe, Gambhir and Sehwag could start strong, and they could chase it down. That was hogwash. They were repeatedly confused by Warne’s wrist spin and fell to Watson’s variation of pace, completely outdone by the scoreboard pressure they mounted on themselves. That was the end of the inaugural season, but there seemed to have been enough groundwork laid for a stronger subsequent season. 
In 2009, the Delhi Capitals, then the Delhi Daredevils, finished as the table-toppers at the end of the league stage, and they were poised for a fabulous title with the quality of their line-up. An in-form Dilshan and a young, talented A. B. Devilliers sent the scores soaring, and Vettori picked up the crucial wickets to bring the game home. In the semi-final, they were up against a very convincing Deccan Chargers, who had made many errors early on. The Chargers had to chase down a relatively average score of 153 that could have gone both ways, but Gilchrist played the innings of his life, scoring the fastest ever IPL 50 in just 17 balls. He went on to score a looming 85, so even after they quietly celebrated his wicket, it was child’s play for the Chargers. Whether it was a question of holding their nerve with legendary bowlers to back them up or the number of golden ducks in their batting, we will never know. But, it was a pole position from the league stage that was wasted on the Daredevils.
2010 and 2011 were pretty dull years for the team. They sparked with tenacious performances but had no real magic to set it blazing. In those years, they finished fifth and last respectively. This downward slope hinted they had to take serious measures before they were out of the points table completely — Sehwag was the only man really pulling the strings for them. But 2012 was a breath of fresh air. They probably drew inspiration from CSK and tried to execute tested combinations of all-stars. They packed their squad with Jayawardene, Pietersen (yes, he was playing at that time), experienced strokeplayer Ross Taylor, and muscle-man Russell. Surprisingly, despite their all-star powerhouse, a more controlled and underrated Morne Morkel was the pick of the lot for me, with express bowler Umesh Yadav assisting him well in his spells. They were consistent, steady, and despite some slips in the league stage against a talented KKR side and a dynamic, batting-heavy RCB, they looked poised for a championship win. Alas, it was not to be. KKR actually had no intention of winning the game till the 16th over. The last four overs’ dynamics boosted their confidence to a great extent and got them to a dominant position as they quickly chipped away at the Daredevils’ batting order. The Daredevils actually dropped Morkel, the magic-bearer of the Purple Cap, who was instrumental to the Daredevils’ success, and instead, brought in a sub-par all-arounder to boost their batting half. This bizarre decision ended their elusive dream of an IPL title.
The years between 2013 and 2017 were another dry patch where the Daredevils toggled between the last three places in the league pretty well. Apart from the 2017 season, where they clocked four wins from their last five games, but the points they bagged making no difference to their playoff chances, there is no point in harping on these lost moments as many have done in the past. The team’s composition was just not setting well. Be it, stocking up all-rounders like Duminy and Corey Anderson, a dulled New Zealand cricketer who scored the fastest hundred ever, or layering their batting with a largely inconsistent Sanju Samson and an ageing Murali Vijay, the Daredevils were not seeing the light of day. 
The 2018 season was probably the nail in the coffin for Chairman Parth Jindal. They were picking star performers from past seasons, Ranjis, the Indian National Team, and the entire cricket world, but they were not getting the finer details right. The practicality of these choices kept them away from the title and the playoffs in general (they didn't make the cut for five consecutive years). “If it's the title we want, our title we shall change,'' ended up the solution. Thus, “Daredevils” was lofted into the stands, never to be found again, and “Capitals” was up with the new ball. 
2019 came, and the newly-named Capitals vaulted to the top of the points table. Contemporary stars Shreyas Iyer and Dhawan were sensational with the bat, and Rabada shut down chases in the death overs. Against a languishing RCB team, fantastic fielding coupled with power hitting, good death bowling summed up to a comprehensive performance that the Capitals could be proud of. In Qualifier 2, CSK proved to be a side that built on their glorious past, gifted with a fantastic error-correcting authority in the form of Fleming. It was thoughtful planning and a mindful captain that led an average side of consistent performers over the line. They were magically precise in their execution. The Capitals seemed like a bunch of newbies: there was a child-like magic to their gameplay with firepower and flying fielders. But Dhoni the sorcerer showed them that magic evolves from tested formulas and variations. The spinner trio, Harbhabjan Singh, Imran Tahir, and Jadeja, capitalized on the slow surface to pick up quick wickets for the team. A paltry total of 147 was not enough against a top-heavy CSK side, with Du Plessis and Watson getting CSK to a blitzy start. It was a comfortable win for CSK and a shattering end to the Capitals’ campaign. Despite not getting past the second-to-last hurdle, their performance promised a resurgence and showed that they were hungry for more.
The current season has been an incredible one for the Capitals. The pace-duo Rabada and Nortje have been bolting 150 kph deliveries at the batsmen, giving their opponents little breathing room. Their top order has performed outstandingly every game this season, and Stoinis has given them an explosive finish. They have registered wins with big margins, and they are at the top of the table with more exciting games to come. As I chart their growth through the season, the transformation that we have witnessed up to now has given us a lot to hope for. To win a maiden title would be the finishing touch to their showcase of dominance, talent, and T20 blitz. From the dry patches to dry pitches in Feroz Shah Kotla, the thundering Delhi Capitals may have found their ultimate spot in deserted stadiums for a quiet win.

While October is typically filled with Halloween costume sales, decorations, and parties, this year one of the world’s scariest monsters has transcended his costume form and attacked the real world. His name? COVID-19. Halloween is one of the most beloved and widely celebrated holidays across the United States and even internationally. Kids love dressing up to trick-or-treat, while older teenagers and adults often showcase their favorite costumes at Halloween parties. Amid a worldwide pandemic, however, it remains unlikely that children will be able to go door-to-door picking up candy, and even more unlikely that any form of Halloween partying will be allowed. Therefore, the question remains: What is the fate of a mid-pandemic Halloween?
Should You Celebrate Halloween This Year?
According to the official CDC website, the answer is a strong no. The National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases explains, “any traditional Halloween activities can be high-risk for spreading viruses… If you may have COVID-19 or you may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, you should not participate in in-person Halloween festivities and should not give out candy to trick-or-treaters.” As colleges across the United States opened up with social distancing measures this August, the media is looking specifically to college students to see whether or not partying will occur. Halloween’s notorious reputation for attracting partying could yield serious problems for the spread of coronavirus. Instead, the CDC notes, “there are several safer, alternative ways to participate in Halloween.”
How To Celebrate Safely
The traditional door-to-door candy grabbing will likely not happen in any part of the United States this year. According to an annual survey by the National Retail Federation, “Over 148 million U.S. adults intend to take part in Halloween-related activities this year... That's down from the 172 million in the 2019 survey. And those planning to celebrate by trick or treating this year dropped to 23% from 29% in 2019.” While the numbers of in-person celebrators have declined, Americans are still looking for ways to celebrate the holiday. Celebrating on Zoom, doing virtual Instagram challenges, wearing masks to social distance with friends, and watching Halloween movies are all great ways to celebrate during these unprecedented times. 
What are CMU’s Plans for A Safe and Fun Halloween?
Whether you’re an in-person student living on campus or a remote student living at home, Carnegie Mellon is dedicated to creating a Halloween experience for its students. Student organizations such as the Dietrich First Year Council are hosting Halloween Instagram challenges. Hunt Library even has spooky themed books available for students to pick up or read online.
There are many ways to have a fun Halloween despite the COVID-19 pandemic. While you may not be able to trick-or-treat, you can still find something good to eat. So remember to come as you aren’t, beware the scares, and let the ghoul times roll.

The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) at Carnegie Mellon is now at the helm of a new national AI initiative funded by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) to “advance the discipline of artificial intelligence (AI) engineering for defense and national security,” as written in the Oct. 14 announcement. The initiative seeks to develop an AI engineering framework that can be applied to anyone working toward the goals of the Department of Defense. 
The SEI is a federally funded research and development center (FFRDC), and it is one of three research and development FFRDC laboratories for the Department of Defense. This new ODNI initiative centers the SEI as a hub for AI engineering nationally.
Matt Gaston, director of the SEI’s Emerging Technology Center, told The Tartan in an interview that there is a commonly held belief that the development of new AI technologies is a “craft.” He said, “there are amazing experts that are building these [new technologies] all over the world. But the repeatability of that process, or the scalability of that process, is difficult, and the best practices are not captured or not shared. Moving the discipline from a craft to an actual engineering practice stands to benefit everyone.” This task of moving AI from a craft to a structured engineering practice is the one main goal of the initiative.
The difference between this initiative and others, Gaston explained, is that “most AI projects are focused on AI capabilities specifically,” like the actual implementation of a particular AI technology, or what some call “mission capability.” This new initiative is more about fleshing out the processes by which AI systems are developed, “so that they can be reliable, operate the way that they're expected to operate, and be maintained and evolved over time and in a responsible and methodical way,” Gaston said. 
When asked about how this initiative compares to something like the Carnegie Mellon-housed Army AI Task Force, Gaston said that though the “scope, and grand vision” of this initiative may be larger, “the initial funding is, as far as I know, definitely not larger” than the task force.  
No additional information on the initial ODNI investment, or expected investment over time, has been released at the present. Richard Lynch, spokesperson for the SEI, told The Tartan, “we don't ever release details like that, unless the sponsor of the work has approved that information to be released. And in doing this release with the ODNI, they didn't choose to share that information.”
Gaston said that the ultimate goals of the initiative will evolve over time, given the fast rate of evolution in AI technology. “For some period of time, we'll see incremental progress into getting to better practices, more repeatable practices, dealing with topics like robustness, or how to implement ethical principles,” Gaston explained, noting that “the end state is hard to envision, right? Who knows if it's textbooks or courses or tools, it's probably all of that, and those will continue to evolve with technology.”
As for what's happening right now, Gaston said of this new initiative, “it's very early days,” adding that the organizational work is just getting started. Currently, the SEI is seeking partnerships with other organizations to begin scaling this work up. 
Gaston says that the SEI is viewing this project as a “community initiative,” hoping to gain partnerships across the intelligence and academic communities. “We really view it as a movement, more than anything else,” Gaston stated. “Our expectation, and experience over the years, is that [partners] will bring their own resources to this, because they see the value of advancing this AI engineering discipline.”
In the past, students and faculty have raised concerns regarding other AI programs like the Army AI Task Force, and they have protested the university’s hosting of Palantir, a company that sells technology to ICE. Gaston declined to comment on the potential for community pushback against initiatives like this one, saying instead, “AI is a collection of technologies that, I think, can have a very positive impact on lots of different parts of our economy, and our world. [The] desire to create an engineering discipline around how to do that as well as it can be done [has the potential] to benefit a large portion of society.”

November’s election will be unlike any we’ve seen before. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic,  more people than ever are expected to vote by mail or absentee. Because election officials may  not even begin opening ballot envelopes until election day, Pennsylvania will not likely know the results of our elections until after election day. While it’s different from what we’re used to, it’s crucial in every election that every vote is counted.  
To ensure every vote is counted, we must lessen the burden on our elected officials by making  a plan to vote early this year, either in-person, absentee, or by mail! 
Once you receive your ballot, carefully fill it out, place it first in the provided blank secrecy envelope, then the provided return envelope, and finally sign the outside envelope where indicated. You return your ballot by mailing it in, though we recommend dropping your ballot off if it is 10 days or less before Election day. You can also drop your absentee ballot off in-person at your County Election Office. If you are registered in Allegheny County, that specific office is located at 542 Forbes Ave Ste 601, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213-2913. If you plan to drop off your ballot in-person, the ballot must be received by 8 pm on election day.  
Use the website vote.org to register to vote and to check that your registration is up to date. To request your absentee ballot today, you can use this ballot request form.
Amid this health crisis, nearing a critical election, we must protect our right vote. Now is the time to act – we can all do our part by making a plan to cast our ballot early this year.

I was watching the Buccaneers and Bears game on the 8th of October (shout out to Tom Brady on his spectacular loss), and an ad that appeared in the middle of the third quarter resonated with me just as much as the 20-19 Bears over Bucs final score did. It was an ad with a former football player, Herschel Walker I believe, discussing how he, as a former Obama voter, believed Black people should not be ashamed to vote for President Donald Trump. Citing some (now outdated) numbers on African American job growth and some information on opportunity zones (which have gone on to benefit richer whiter corporations instead of minorities), he claimed that African Americans should be supportive of the President. Now I am not here to spew political philosophy over which candidate is better. However I am here to discuss the unequivocal truth: the Black Vote is fundamentally misunderstood, the consequences of which are wide-ranging, deleteriously affecting the entire framing of U.S. political thought.
We all know the old maxim that the Black vote is a monolithic one. Key and Peele even rag on this in their excellent series on Black Republicans. From the polling numbers that axiom seems to be correct. In the previous 4 elections, Black people supported the Democratic candidate by a landslide, almost monsoon level margins, 77% in 2004, 91% in 2008, 87% in 2012, and 80% in 2016.  Yet this surface-level analysis fails to capture the complexities and nuances inherent in voting when Black. 
For one thing, just as important as voter margin is voter turnout, and between the years 2012 and 2016, the Black voter turnout took a precipitous fall, dropping from 66.6% of registered Black voters, a record for any ethnicity in that election, to around 59% in the subsequent election. This loss of millions of Black voters is the reason that states like Florida, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania flipped, and why states like North Carolina continued to elude Democrats. Black voters are swing voters too, just not necessarily between parties, but between voting and not. Engaging in increasing Black turnout is key for any party who wishes to have any form of success.
Another thing that clearly gets left out is the fact that Black people, and thus Black voters, are an extremely diverse set of people. Black people can come from places like the West Indies (like myself) and Africa and have completely different life experiences than a Black voter born in the deep south, who would also have a substantially different experience than a Black person who grew up in Oakland would have. Black experiences are context-dependent; Black votes are as well. Speaking in large generalities about how Black voters feel and think can be myopic without the requisite contextualization.
Another short-sighted characteristic that many outside pundits ascribe to Black voters is the erroneous belief that Black voters share a monolithic set of policy beliefs and desired prescriptions. Many Black people according to Pew, self describe themselves as moderate or even conservative. Yet, they do not vote for Republicans in general. Does that imply that they are on some sort of “plantation” as many Black Conservative activists (and unfortunately some white ones) seem to imply? Of course not! FiveThirtyEight noted that many Black people are Democrats due to a variety of influences. The ideological split that seems to exist in the Black vote may also not exist, as FiveThirtyEight, in another piece, noted that Black people tend to loosely use “Liberal” and “Conservative” to describe themselves and others, with around 30% each describing Romney as Liberal and Obama as Conservative.  
That doesn't mean that Black people, even if they self-identify as liberal or conservative, do not share some clear commonalities in policy. FiveThirtyEight noted that Black people overall support initiatives like a Federal Jobs Guarantee and national jobs program, while opposing limiting police funding. There is a split on welfare expansion and  affirmative action, illustrating a wide range of political philosophies. So with all that in mind, one may ask, why do Black people vote so monolithically, and the answer is that there is a linked fate that African Americans share on a national level, due to the prevalence of structural racism which affects everybody Black person regardless of class, identity, or nationality. Joe Biden got so many Black voters in the primary because he was seen as the pragmatic choice that moderate white voters would happily vote for. Black people must vote pragmatically instead of selfishly because the lives of millions of other Black people must be considered, even if those souls are never met by the prospective voter. 
So whenever a candidate says that not voting for him “ain’t black,” or another candidate attempts to utilize Cambridge Analytica to target African American votes for suppression,  note that the foolish myth of the Black voter monolith clouds both of their judgments. This inability to see a minority group for who they are transcends races, as Hispanic voters, Asian voters, and Indigenous voters, and even LGBTQ+ voters, do not get the level of analysis and nuance that their groups deserve. That is unfortunately what happens when a socio-political cultural system venerates a white group as pure and sees the rest as colored stains that do not belong on a mosaic.

As California continues to be on fire and the Trump administration caused a scare by briefly denying disaster relief, a depressing thought has crossed the minds of some in the state: is it time to move somewhere else?
The climate crisis and the ensuing migration crisis have been knocking on America’s door for the last few decades; in the past few years, they've been outpacing us. The same can be said for the rest of the world. The Point of No Return — the point at which it will be too late to mitigate carbon emissions and meet the Paris Climate Agreement’s 2 degrees Celsius limit for rising global temperatures — is set to arrive in 2035. If we were to set our standards to the 1.5 degree Celsius limit, we’ve already passed the Point of No Return.
These arbitrary goals and limits are not something most people can truly process. But record fires, heatwaves, floods, and storms are tangible. The smoke from the wildfires in the West had traveled all the way to the far end of the East coast earlier last month, so even those not directly affected by the fires could see the consequences of the dire situation.
We are going to have to grapple with the fact that thousands, perhaps millions, of Americans over the next several years are likely to be displaced by climate change. It’s not just Californians who will be displaced by the wildfires. Southern coastal states like Louisiana are being battered by increasingly strong hurricanes. Heatwaves are becoming more intense and persistent in the Southwest U.S. A lot of coastal areas like Miami may very well be underwater in the next few decades. Areas near rivers are flooding, and the Great Lakes shorelines are rising too. One study projects that one in 12 Americans living in the Southern half of the country will move. In another, an estimated 13 million living on coast lines are going to have to migrate. Half of the country is going to experience a decline in their quality of life due to environmental decay. Low-income and minority communities, in particular, will bear the brunt of this, particularly in coastal areas like Louisiana.
Climate change presents an abstract, existential threat, which is much harder to articulate or even see. As a result of this, the calls to address this threat were, and still are, frequently met with skepticism or dismissal. I would be remiss if I didn’t acknowledge the mass disinformation campaigns from the fossil fuel industry and right-wingers trying to “debunk” scientific evidence of climate change. With all this combined, we tabled the issue and thought we could cross the bridge when we got there. The problem is that we have taken several wrong turns, and now that we have found the bridge, it's already collapsing.
Insurance policies are clear evidence of this philosophy. The risk of climate change was not something many insurers were prepared for, and short term property value took precedence over any future risks. Development rapidly expanded in areas across the country that are now being ravaged by wildfires, floods, or storms. Insurance companies and states are already having trouble keeping up with the payouts, and insurance costs are only going to increase exponentially. There is a very real danger that these companies may resort to telling people “why did you buy a property here in the first place?” if they are unable to make all the payouts.
It’s more troubling to see how current public policy and the current EPA don’t care about the future valuation of the climate crisis. Current public policy, particularly environmental ones, uses monetary values to represent a single human life. The EPA uses the value of a statistical life (VSL) to calculate how much we would be willing to pay for a mortality risk reduction, which is used to calculate the benefits of a policy. The policy is also divided by a discount rate over each year it’s implemented to determine its present value.
There are a couple of problems with this framework. First, the current EPA uses fairly high discount rates, doing their analyses at three and seven percent, where the Obama-era EPA used discount rates of 2.5% and 5%. Higher discount rates put much less weight on the future, which is the opposite of what is needed for climate change policy. For any sensible action to be passed and to reflect the growing cost of the climate crisis, we should be considering discount rates between 1.5% and 2% at most.
Second, and this is a drawback of cost-benefit analysis as a whole, is that losing lives should be enough for us to want to implement policies that make sure it won’t happen. This is especially true for the climate crisis, where the benefits of implementing environmental policies are so vast that the costs are negligible. It’s easy to get stuck on the sheer accounting and logistics of it all, but we should be the type of country that values the lives and futures of our citizens above all else, especially when we have the means to do so.
That’s what makes the 2020 election discourse about the climate crisis so frustrating. Let’s take a single issue like fracking. Fracking is absolutely destructive, polluting water supplies and the air we breathe. Gas and oil are also some of the largest contributors to carbon emissions. Trump has been attempting to cause an uproar in rural communities in post-industrial states like Pennsylvania by saying Biden is anti-fracking and will take jobs away. Biden defends himself by saying he isn’t.
Pennsylvanians don’t care that much about fracking. There’s been a shift in public opinion over the years against it, and it’s mainly rural communities that have drilling contracts that are against a fracking ban. There are about 26,000 oil and gas jobs in Pennsylvania, and the industry is declining. On the other hand, renewables provide about 97,000 jobs, and it is the fastest-growing job sector in the state.
Yet, the optics of the issue are focused on the cost of short term job loss, which shouldn’t be a zero-sum game. But it is in politics and the eyes of Americans, and it could very well cost Biden in the general election. It doesn’t help that both parties have monetary support from the fossil fuel industry, who are doing what they can to keep themselves alive and profitable at the cost of everyone’s well-being, even lying about how many jobs are actually in the industry.
Far more needs to be done. We need a carbon fee and dividend, which would implement a carbon tax on corporations, distributing revenues back to American families. The Green New Deal, while not perfect, offers retraining programs and federal jobs programs needed while transitioning to renewable energy. We should aim to be carbon neutral by 2035. There needs to be efficient and free public transit and emissions-free vehicles, which the Green New Deal also covers.
The time for comprehensive environmental reform is long overdue. We all deserve a better future. Even if we over-exaggerate the consequences of climate change — which we most certainly aren’t — I’d rather we overreact to the problem than underreact to it.

The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette staff is currently awaiting confirmation to organize a strike. Their owners at Block Communications, Inc. (BCI) are systematically destroying the paper through stressful working conditions, a hostile work environment, and callous leadership. The staff of the paper again must defend their livelihoods, their journalistic ethics, and an integral news source for the region.
The Post-Gazette has struggled in the last few decades, and a large part of the cause is the woeful leadership of BCI. They have continued cutting the newspaper down by pushing out and firing staff, docking pay, and shifting their coverage from daily to only three days a week. Even as they were cutting the paper down, they decided in 2015 to move The Post-Gazette from their historic location in Downtown to an expensive property on the North Shore. 
The hostile work environment of The Post-Gazette only worsens the deal. Keith Burris, who was VP/Editorial Director for Block Newspapers, was inserted as executive editor at The Post-Gazette in 2019. His new power has notably shifted The Post-Gazette’s journalism and editorial stances. The hostility in the editorial room is a large part of BCI’s abuse of their staff, and it is undermining the important work of a vital local institution. In 2018, cartoonist Rob Rogers was fired for his stances critical of conservative positions and President Trump. Earlier this year, Alexis Johnson was stopped from reporting on the Black Lives Matter protests because she was a Black woman who would be “biased.” 
The Tartan Editorial Board stands in solidarity with the staff of The Post-Gazette and supports their strike. The onus of saving journalistic integrity should not be on the working staff of the paper. Yet, the staff at The Post-Gazette is fighting for their paper, their community, and their livelihoods. We feel we need to do what’s in our power to help protect a vital institution.
The current reality of The Post-Gazette is one that regional and local newspapers across the country have been facing for a long time. As local papers cut their staff and circulate less frequently, important local coverage gets missed. Citizens become less informed, corrupt forces are able to hide their corruption more easily, and the news becomes less responsive to the needs of the people. 
Today, papers are forced into competition with Facebook and Google, as they compete for ad space and news distribution. The result is an online environment that rewards clickbait and native advertising, while newspapers are forced to game Facebook and Google’s advertising algorithms to keep themselves afloat. Facebook is now a hub for opinionated journalism and fringe editorializing, and large swathes of the public grow more wary of media and journalism. Newspapers catch the flack as they’re forced to take on these strategies to maintain their revenue stream.
This is not the fault of the staff but rather their owners, many of whom are private equity firms and holding companies whose main objective is the bottom line. Extreme profit-driven maniacs like the Blocks, or money-grubbing vultures like Alden Global Capital, are content with enriching themselves at the expense of their workers and the communities that newspapers serve. Journalistic integrity is only an obstacle for their obscene, capitalist hunger for profit maximization. As newspapers are continually forced to game online algorithms to take in revenue, the equity firms and holding companies that own them are content with abusing and firing their staff to keep that revenue for themselves. 
The staff at The Post-Gazette, despite these odds, have done what they can to maintain journalistic ethics and integrity, but in desperate times, strong measures and action need to be taken to defend a key pillar of our community. The Blocks are bad-faith actors and the staff at The Post-Gazette have tried to reason with them. It’s clear that the Blocks are blinded with power and money, forcing the staff to take extreme measures during a pandemic. 
Just like the staff of The Post-Gazette, The Tartan also recognizes our responsibility to the community, and we will continue to fulfill it to the best of our abilities. In the age of widespread disinformation, journalism is more important than ever. Local and regional newspapers are integral at every level, and The Post-Gazette is integral to Pittsburgh. It is our obligation to stand with the staff and protect a vital institution in our city.
