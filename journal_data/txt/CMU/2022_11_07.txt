Men’s Soccer
On Saturday, Nov. 5, the men’s soccer team traveled to Case Western Reserve University to face the 24th-ranked team in their final regular season game. 
In the sixth minute of the game, junior Diederik Schlingemann the Tartans on the board. His first goal of the season was thanks to a throw-in into the box from sophomore Billy Boucuvalas. Neither team would manage to score again until late into the first half when the Spartans got one in the net, tying the game.
Case Western managed to keep up the momentum into the second half with goals during the 64th and 68th minutes, giving the Spartans a 3-1 lead. In a late comeback effort that ultimately left the Tartans a goal short, sophomore Alejandro Fernandez put a shot on goal during the 87th minute that was followed by sophomore Eli Kampine’s goal a minute later. The final score was 3-2 in favor of Case Western. 
The Tartans’ final record of the season, 11-4-1 overall, saw them finish fourth in the University Athletic Association (UAA), their highest finish since 2016. Their season may not be over yet, though; the team will learn if they will compete in the 2022 NCAA Division III Men’s Soccer Championship on Monday, Nov. 7 at 1:30 p.m.
Women’s Soccer
The #7 Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team took on #4 Case Western Reserve University on Saturday, Nov. 5 in Cleveland for their last regular game of the season. The two teams were competing for the UAA Championship as well, as both were 5-0-1 in UAA play prior to their meeting. 
The Spartans took an early lead over the Tartans in the sixth minute thanks to a free kick opportunity. Despite the Tartans having eight shots on goal in the second half, they weren’t able to get one in the net, leading to a 1-0 loss against Case Western. 
As a result, the Tartans finished the regular season 12-2-2 overall and 5-1-1 in UAA play. They placed second the UAA standings, their highest finish since 2016. Their season may not be over yet, though; the Tartans may compete in the 2022 NCAA Division III Women’s Soccer Championship based on a decision that will take place on Monday, Nov. 7 at 2:00 p.m.
Men’s Swimming and Diving
The men’s swimming and diving team faced Gettysburg College this past Saturday, Nov. 5 on the road.

Group A
Liverpool and Napoli faced off last Tuesday, with both teams playing well. The hosts recorded a slight statistical advantage, but the visitors held them off. In the dying minutes of the match, it looked as if the teams would be splitting the points, but a late goal in the 85th minute by Mohamed Salah tipped the scale in the favor of the Reds. Darwin Núñez scored a second goal in the eighth minute of stoppage time, making the final scoreline 2-0 to Liverpool. Despite their Matchday 6 victory,  Liverpool’s 4-1 loss to Napoli back on Matchday 1 means that both teams will be ending the group stage with 15 points. Napoli remains at the top of the Group A table, while Liverpool stays in second. Both will be moving on to the round of 16.
The match between Ajax and Rangers went as expected, with the visitors opening the scoring in the fourth minute with a goal from Steven Berghuis. They doubled their advantage when Mohammed Kudus scored in the 29th minute to make it 2-0. The hosts pulled one back in the 87th minute via a James Tavernier penalty, but the visitors fired back, with Francisco Conceição scoring in the 89th minute to make the final scoreline 3-1 Ajax. As anticipated, Ajax, finishing third in the group, will not play in the knockout stage of the Champions League but will continue their European campaign in the Europa League. The Rangers, on the other hand, are out of Europe.
Group B
From a scoring standpoint, Porto dominated in their match against Atlético Madrid last Tuesday. Mehdi Taremi opened the scoring in the fifth minute and Stephen Eustáquio doubled the hosts’ advantage in the 24th minute. Despite the visitors’ best efforts, Atleti failed to capitalize on any of their five shots on target, only getting on the scoreboard when Iván Marcano scored a goal in the fifth minute of stoppage time. With the final scoreline reading 2-1 to Porto, and with Club Brugge and Leverkusen later splitting their points, Porto concluded their Champions League group stage sitting at the top of Group B with 12 points. They are poised to take on the knockout stage, while Atlético Madrid falls to the bottom of the table and out of Europe completely.
The match between Leverkusen and Club Brugge ended in a scoreless 0-0, though not for lack of trying on either team’s part. The hosts recorded 13 shots, four of which were on target, while the visitors recorded eight shots with one on target. However, neither side found the back of the net and the points ended up split between the two. Club Brugge falls from the top of the Group B table to a respectable second place, still qualifying for the round of 16, while Leverkusen finds themselves elevated into third place, ahead of Atlético Madrid, and will continue their European campaign in the Europa League.
Group C
Group C table-toppers Bayern Munich put up a solid performance against Inter Milan to stay at the top of the table. Benjamin Pavard put the hosts in front in the 32nd minute and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting doubled their advantage in the 72nd minute. Faced with double their own shots on target and over triple their number of shots, the visitors were thoroughly outmatched. Bayern’s 2-0 victory also means that they are the only team in this year’s Champions League to win every one of their group stage matches, finishing undefeated with 18 points to their name and qualifying for the round of 16. Despite their loss, Inter still remain second in the Group C table and will qualify for the round of 16 alongside Bayern.
The head-to-head between Viktoria Plzeň and Barcelona was one of the most contentious matches of Matchday 6. Marcos Alonso opened the scoring for the visitors in the sixth minute and Ferran Torres doubled Barça's lead just ahead of halftime with a goal in the 44th minute. The hosts pulled one back in the 51st minute when Tomáš Chorý’s penalty made it 2-1, but Torres completed a brace in the 54th minute to reinstate the visitors’ two-goal margin. Chorý fired back, completing a brace of his own in the 63rd minute to put the hosts again within one of equalizing. But it was not to be, and Pablo Torre scored a fourth goal for Barcelona in the 75th minute, making the final scoreline 4-2. Perhaps unfortunately for both teams, however, the result of this match does little to change their standings. Viktoria Plzeň, sitting rock bottom in Group C, is out of Europe and Barcelona, despite their victory, still sit in third, relegated from Champions League into Europa League competition.
Group D
In the match between Marseille and Tottenham, it was the hosts who opened the scoring in the third minute of injury time before halftime through Chancel Mbemba Mangulu. For a moment, it looked like Tottenham’s round of 16 qualification was in jeopardy, but the visitors recovered quickly, with Clément Lenglet equalizing in the 54th minute. Despite efforts from both sides, it was the visitors who would emerge victorious, with Pierre-Emile Højbjerg’s goal in the fifth minute of stoppage time making the final scoreline 2-1 Tottenham. With all three points in hand, Tottenham can breathe a sigh of relief, finishing at the top of the Group D table and qualifying for the knockout stage. For Marseille, however, the result means that they sit at the bottom of the table, relegated from European competition.
Quite ironically, the match between Sporting and Frankfurt almost mirrored the match between their Group D counterparts. Once again, it was the hosts who opened the scoring late in the first half, when Arthur Gomes’ 39th minute effort found the back of the net. However, the visitors staged a comeback, with Daichi Kamada’s 62nd minute penalty leveling the score and Randal Kolo Muani’s 72nd minute effort putting Frankfurt in front. With the game finishing 2-1 in Frankfurt’s favor, the visitors find themselves elevated to second in the Group D table, and will continue onwards to the knockout stage. Sporting, however, slips to third, and will be relegated to Europa League competition.
Group E
The match between AC Milan and Salzburg was completely dominated by the hosts. Olivier Giroud opened the scoring for the hosts in the 14th minute, Rade Krunić doubled their lead in the 46th minute, Giroud completed his brace in the 57th minute, and Junior Messias topped it off with a fourth goal in the first minute of stoppage time. With a 4-0 shutout, AC Milan retained their second-place position in Group E and guaranteed their qualification for the round of 16. Salzburg, sitting in third place after Dinamo Zagreb failed to overcome Chelsea, is out of the Champions League, but will continue their European campaign in the Europa League.
The bulk of the action in the match between Chelsea and Dinamo Zagreb occurred in the first half of the game. Bruno Petković opened the scoring for the visitors in the seventh minute, but his effort was quickly equalized by Raheem Sterling’s goal in the 18th minute. Denis Zakaria then put the hosts ahead in the 30th minute, and despite further efforts from both sides, no other goals were scored for the remainder of the match. With a 2-1 victory, Chelsea remains at the top of Group E, ready to take on the knockout stage, while Dinamo Zagreb stays rock bottom, falling out of Europe.
Group F
Both of Group F’s matches on Matchday 6 featured enormous margins. Real Madrid faced off against Celtic at home, and the visitors found themselves thoroughly overwhelmed. Real opened the scoring when Luka Modrić converted a penalty in the sixth minute and quickly doubled their lead with another penalty converted by Rodrygo in the 21st minute. Marco Asensio then got on the scoreboard with his effort in the 51st minute, Vinícius Júnior made it 4-0 in the 61st minute, and Federico Valverde topped it off with a fifth goal in the 71st minute. Jota put one in the net for Celtic in the 84th minute, but it was far too little, far too late, and Real Madrid emerged victorious, 5-1. With this win, Real has now solidified their place at the top of the Group F table and in the round of 16, while Celtic remains at the bottom of the table, relegated out of Europe.
Leipzig also put up a four-goal margin in their head-to-head against Shakhtar Donetsk. Christopher Nkunku opened the scoring for the hosts in the 10th minute, André Silva made it 2-0 in the 50th minute, and Dominik Szoboszlai extended the margin to three goals in the 62nd minute. Things got worse for the visitors when Valeriy Bondar scored an own goal in the 68th minute, making the final scoreline 4-0 to Leipzig. With this win, Leipzig solidified their second-place position in the group, guaranteeing their qualification for the round of 16, while Shakhtar Donetsk remain in third, and will continue their European campaign in the Europa League.
Group G
The match between Manchester City and Sevilla started out in the visitors’ favor with Rafa Mir opening the scoring in the 31st minute. The second half, however, was all Man City’s. Rico Lewis equalized in the 52nd minute, Julián Álvarez doubled City’s lead in the 73rd minute, and Riyad Mahrez made the final scoreline 3-1 City in the 83rd minute. City sits at the top of Group G, comfortably qualifying for the knockout stage, while Sevilla retains their third-place position, and will be playing in Europa League competition.
Despite both sides’ efforts, the match between Copenhagen and Dortmund ended in a deadlock, with Thorgan Hazard having opened the scoring for the visitors in the 23rd minute and Hákon Arnar Haraldsson having equalized in the 41st minute. With the final scoreline reading 1-1 and the points being split, Dortmund remains second in the table as Copenhagen stays rock bottom, with the former qualifying for the round of 16 and the latter falling out of Europe.
Group H
The match between Maccabi Haifa and Benfica featured the largest margin of any match on Matchday 6. Gonçalo Ramos opened the scoring for the visitors in the 20th minute, but this was quickly equalized by Tjaronn Chery’s penalty in the 26th minute. The second half, however, saw Benfica completely overrun the hosts. Peter Musa put the visitors in front again in the 59th minute before Álex Grimaldo doubled their lead in the 69th minute. Rafa Silva then put himself on the scoreboard in the 73rd minute, Henrique Araújo scored in the 88th minute, and João Mário finished it off with yet another goal in the second minute of stoppage time. With this massive 6-1 victory, Benfica overtakes PSG to sit at the top of the Group H table on goal difference, poised to take on the round of 16. Unfortunately for Maccabi Haifa, their position at the bottom of the table means that they are out of Europe.
The head-to-head between Juventus and PSG began in the visitors’ favor when Kylian Mbappé scored in the 13th minute to put PSG ahead. The old lady struck back, however, and Leonardo Bonucci equalized for the hosts in the 39th minute. It would be PSG who would go home with all three points, however, with Nuno Mendes scoring in the 69th minute to make the final scoreline 2-1 to the visitors. Despite this victory, PSG slides down to second in the Group H table, though they still comfortably qualify for the knockout stage. Juventus, after a dismal group stage, is out of the Champions League, and will only continue their European campaign in the Europa League thanks to their goal difference over Maccabi Haifa.

Buggy is a Carnegie Mellon tradition which has existed since 1920. The sport, which is practiced throughout the academic year, culminates in an annual series of relay races held on each year’s Raceday during Spring Carnival, in which teams vie for the title of “Champion.” The Buggy Rolls Report column reports on the buggies and roll counts for all of the teams which attend the freeroll practices (“rolls”) each weekend organized by the Carnegie Mellon Sweepstakes Committee. All of the information reported in the column is provided by the Carnegie Mellon Sweepstakes Committee.
CMU Buggy’s Mini Raceday was held last weekend, with buggy alumni and members of the CMU Buggy Alumni Association (BAA) flying in from across the country to spectate and assist. With the support of the BAA, teams were able to officially time their rolls — receiving an overall time, along with times for each of the hills, as well as the freeroll — for the first time this season.
In total, eight teams rolled on Saturday, Nov. 5. In roll order, they were: SDC (The Carnegie Mellon Student Dormitory Council), SPIRIT, SigNu (Sigma Nu), PiKA (Pi Kappa Alpha), Fringe, CIA (The Carnegie Involvement Association), Apex, and SigEp (Sigma Phi Epsilon).
SDC rolled three buggies: Vanity, Avarice, and Inferno. Vanity got one roll in, while Avarice and Inferno got two rolls in.
SPIRIT rolled three buggies: Kingpin II, Seraph, and Mapambazuko. Each buggy got two rolls in.
SigNu rolled one buggy, Jager, which got two rolls in.
PiKA rolled two buggies: Banshee and Raptor. Each buggy got two rolls in.
Fringe rolled one buggy, Burnout, which got two rolls in.
CIA rolled four buggies: Roadrunner, Tempest, Emperor, and Kingfisher. Each buggy got two rolls in. 
Apex rolled three buggies: Molotov, Phoenix, and Solaris. Each buggy got two rolls in.
SigEp rolled two buggies: Kraken and Barracuda. Each buggy got two rolls in.
There were no rolls on Sunday, Nov. 6, due to anticipation of rain.

Argo AI, a Pittsburgh-based autonomous vehicle startup that has hosted many Carnegie Mellon students as interns and employees, is shutting down. On Wednesday Oct. 26, the company announced that based on a mutual decision with its shareholders, it would be closing its doors.
The decision comes after two of Argo’s largest backers, Ford and Volkswagen, pulled their investments. Jay Ramey of Autoweek explained that the decision is being seen as a combination of uncertainty on the timeline of commercial self-driving vehicles amidst growing losses by the backing companies.
Indeed, Kirsten Korosec of TechCrunch reports that according to Ford, Argo AI had a net loss of $827 million in the third quarter, with issues seeming to come from the inability to attract new investors. Instead, they report that Ford has decided to shift its resources to developing “advanced driver assistance systems, not autonomous vehicle technology,” indicating that when the technology is closer to fruition, Ford believes they can just purchase it instead of developing it in-house.
Koresec also notes that Volkswagen is similarly backing out, but instead of pivoting to only driver assistance technology, they are continuing the development of both in tandem with their software unit Cariad and other potential partners further down the road. 
Such losses in the field of autonomous vehicles aren’t uncommon. Korosec explains that “promises around commercializing AV technology have proven more difficult than expected,” manifesting in startup closures and consolidations across the board. 
Kris Mamula of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette explains that many experts see this as industry thinning, and not indicative of overall failure of the autonomous vehicle industry, especially when considering applications outside the realm of cars and in areas like trucking. Indeed, many other autonomous vehicle companies are focusing on cars, like Tesla, Waymo, and Nvidia, and others like Pittsburgh-based Locomation are driving the focus on the trucking industry.
However, there are some that argue that the shutdown of Argo AI is a bad sign for the industry as a whole. Kea Wilson of StreetsBlogUSA explains that not only was Argo considered “among the best positioned” to effectively develop this technology, but that they also had one of the most responsible approaches. Rather than claiming their autonomous vehicles could work in all environments, Argo focused on “limited roadway scenarios — also known as ‘Level Four’ AVs.” 
Indeed, Wilson explains that trends in the wider AV industry are making it clear that even if the technology succeeds, the economics for car manufacturers might not be there. With the large overhead costs associated with sensors and most practical uses limited to specific roadway situations, it can be argued that the best use of the current technology would actually be for public transportation. And the costs to move to the next level (Level Five, which encompasses autonomous use in all situations) might be more than car companies are willing to pay. 
Luckily, this isn’t the end for Argo AI employees. 
Mamula characterizes the “Argonauts” (the Greek-mythology-inspired nickname for Argo AI’s employees) as “highly trained engineers who are expected to be snapped up fast by recruiters.”
Indeed, some of Argo’s employees aren’t looking far for work. Koresec notes that around 300 Argo employees are either being reabsorbed into Volkswagen or offered new jobs there. Ford reported that “several hundred” of the 2,000 former Argo employees will be offered jobs to continue work with them.
On top of that, Korosec furthers that the severance packages themselves are also particularly generous, including all employees receiving an annual bonus and a transaction bonus upon the deal with Ford and Volkswagen being finalized, and employees not brought on by Ford and Volkswagen additionally receiving “termination and severance pay, including health insurance.”
And despite the Argo AI shutdown, robotics in Pittsburgh remains a strong industry. 
Itiya Irvin-Mitchell of Technically explains that the robotics and autonomous systems industry in Pittsburgh consists of over 100 companies and 40 supporting organizations, which is over 7,000 direct industry jobs. Despite the loss of Argo AI, Pittsburgh is resilient and has countless other companies helping lead the autonomous systems industry. 
Pittsburgh also has strong universities pushing this growth, with Mamula further reporting that Carnegie Mellon’s Argo AI Center for Autonomous Vehicle Research will continue conducting research “while other sources of support are found.”  
The loss of Argo AI is a blow to the Pittsburgh tech community, especially considering its strong ties to Carnegie Mellon. But that is the nature of start-ups, and overall, Pittsburgh (and Carnegie Mellon University) are continuing to innovate and advance the fields of robotics and autonomous systems, regardless of whether their applications are seen in cars.

Sony announces PlayStation VR2 pre-orders, PS5 sales top 25 million
In a PlayStation blog post, Sony Vice President for Brand, Hardware and Peripherals Isabelle Tomatis announced that the PlayStation (PS) VR2 will be officially launching on Feb. 22, 2023 and preorders will be opening later this month. The PS VR2 is the next generation of PlayStation’s virtual reality console; however, it is not standalone. It will need a PS5 console to work.
The PS VR2 has a recommended retail price of $549.99 and the base set will include the PS VR2 headset, PS VR2 Sense controllers, and stereo headphones. A PS VR2 Horizon Call of the Mountain Bundle will also be available for $599.99 and include a voucher for “Horizon Call of the Mountain.” A PS VR2 Sense controller charging station can also be purchased for $49.99 — this means users will not have to connect the controllers directly to a PS5 console to charge them.
Buyers in eligible countries can register for PS VR2 pre-orders through the PS website.
Additionally, Sony sold a total of 3.3 million PS5 units between the period of July 1 to Sept. 30. This matches the number of PS5 units shipped during the same time last year. A total of 62.5 million units of PS4/5 software was also sold during this time, which is down 13.9 million compared to the same period last year. 
‘God of War Ragnarök’ review embargo lifted, scoring many "perfects"
The follow-up to the 2018 Game of the Year, “God of War Ragnarök” will be released this Wednesday, Nov. 9, for PS4/5. The review embargo lifted this week to overwhelmingly positive reviews.
On review aggregators OpenCritic and Metacritic, the game has an average review score of 94 out of 100, with 98 percent of critics recommending this game. This places it at the number two game of the year on both websites, with “Elden Ring” taking first on both. 
Kojima rejects several acquisition offers, opts to stay independent
In the most recent episode of his podcast, "Brain Structure", Kojima Productions owner Hideo Kojima stated that he had been approached by several companies who wanted to purchase the video game development studio. Kojima denied the offers, but said that some of the offers were “ridiculously high.” The company was founded after Kojima left Konami and has since developed “Death Stranding,” which debuted in 2019 for PS4. The company is currently at least working on a sequel for “Death Stranding” and an exclusive game for Xbox.
‘Slay the Spire’ to get a board game
On Nov. 1, a Kickstarter campaign for a “Slay the Spire” board game opened up. The monetary goal for the project was $50,000; the project was fully funded within six minutes of its opening. As of Nov. 6, over $2.3 million has been pledged to the project from over 17,000 people. The project will be open until 3:00 p.m. EST on Friday, Nov. 18.

TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, has been hiring former U.S. Intelligence from the CIA, NSA, FBI, U.S. Cyber Command, and State Department. 
Such officials have made the career swap in both the public and private eye. Sasha Ingber of Newsy explained that government websites have confirmed that an NSA target analyst recently took at job at TikTok, and past analysis has included at least three former CIA officers and three former FBI officers, including “a crisis management unit chief and supervisory special agents,” have also taken jobs with TikTok. 
TikTok isn’t alone in hiring former government employees — it’s actually a fairly common business practice. Al Mayadeen of MintPress explains that after analyzing employment and recruitment websites, Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and other sites hire “ex-spies.” This analysis puts the number of individuals who made the jump from government to tech in the dozens.
Twitter is a similarly interesting example. Mayadeen notes that Twitter specifically tends to recruit from the FBI, with both the current Director of Corporate Security & Risk and the Director of Corporate Resilience at Twitter having spent 20+ years at the FBI. However, he furthers that Twitter has also hired former NATO and CIA personnel, and also employs active army officers. Similar analysis can be made of Facebook, which entered a partnership with the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensics Research Lab, and whose head of intelligence is a former NATO Press Secretary. 
Across the board, most of these hires are in areas related to their government experience. Dana Sanchez of Moguldom Nation explains that often the employees entering these technology and social media companies are former high-level directors, legal counselors, and analysts. She furthers that the positions they hold are often in security, trust, safety, and content. Similarly, Ingber explains that for TikTok’s specific acquisitions, the officials often work in “TikTok investigations, threat analysis, and law enforcement outreach.”
There is division over what this means for the industry. 
Mayadeen notes that there is backlash against such hires because of the belief that it undermines the neutrality of social media sites and their ability to check the power of the government. He furthers there is a striking similarity in the ways that companies like Twitter handle controversies and global topics and the ways that U.S. organizations like the FBI view them, citing disinformation campaigns as their example. A striking example is the cautionary messages added to tweets from Russia, China, Iran, and Cuba, but the absence of such warning for the U.S., E.U., or other allies. 
Further controversy for TikTok specifically comes from the connections between TikTok’s owners, ByteDance, and the Chinese government. Ingber notes that because of blurred lines between the government and private businesses, there is questions over whether these hires can reveal information about the U.S. intelligence agencies through monitoring of the former U.S. government employees actions and how they do their jobs, or whether these officials will end up unknowingly aiding China’s intelligence services. While TikTok rejects such claims, Ingber notes at the very least this could be a public relations move to downplay the controversies concerning the Chinese ownership of TikTok and widespread use by U.S. citizens. 
Yet, others note that this seems to be standard for the industry. Ingber reported the views of Lindsay Gorman, former senior advisor for technology strategy at the White House, who sees these hires as “giving TikTok a stamp of legitimacy.” They are following along the path of large social media companies before them, and hiring talent with lots of experience. Gorman furthers that “this is a normal reaction to the growth of a company,” and that when hiring threat intelligence analysts to handle this growth, former law enforcement and intelligence officials are a “popular talent pool.”
Indeed, national security lawyers did tell Ingber that just taking jobs at these social media companies after working for the government intelligence community isn’t illegal, despite what some critics may worry about.
At the end of the day, what intelligence officials do after their government jobs is their business. But now that TikTok has officially hopped on the trend of hiring former government workers, the likelihood that those officials end up working for “the clock app” looks pretty decent.

For the last year and change, I've been scouring the Carnegie Mellon archives while researching for a top-secret project. Hopefully in the not-so-distant future, this research will come to fruition, and I will drop a bombshell report in this very publication. But alas, my research remains pitifully unfinished. For now, I’ll let the suspense linger while I share with you the odd stories, interesting characters, and strange discoveries I find while digging through the archives. If the Pillbox gods are satisfied with this pilot article, you can expect this to become a recurring column in the future. 
This week, I'm kicking things off with a light story. For various undisclosable reasons, I was reading the very oldest editions of The Thistle, the school yearbook, through our digital archives. On page 62 of the 1908 yearbook, I stumbled upon a series of short stories written as letters from the perspective of a female student named Margaret, titled the "Maggy Murphy Manuscripts." After having a strongly-worded conversation with our resident plagiarist Anna Cappella about her clear theft of this idea, I began to read so that I could learn how students of yore felt about school life. The fourth letter, dated to Dec. 15, 1907, starts out, "You remember how Sampson, the strong man, was captured last year, and a banquet spoiled, well would you believe it, the Plebes fell into the same trap." This grabbed my attention, but I didn't want to jump to any conclusions. To be clear, Maggy is fictional — the real author of these stories is Walter Gray, the first-year Class Historian — so perhaps this is a fictional event. But the event is described in such great detail that I felt it necessary to dig deeper. 
In the letter, Maggy describes how the juniors kidnapped the plebe (freshmen) class president Martin — a "bird of a fellow" according to her — and "stowed him in the boiler room of Mechanical [Hamerschlag] Hall." I will also clarify that "juniors'' here refers to second-year students, as the Carnegie Technical Schools only offered three-year programs. The plebe class, who were having their "plebe banquet" that evening, came out in force to recapture their leader. The juniors tried to spirit Martin out through a back entrance of Hamerschlag, but were unable to escape before the plebes descended on them. In the ensuing fight on the muddy slopes of Junction Hollow, the plebes got their president back and took him to a doctor's office. However, a group of crafty juniors tracked them down and "once more took Martin in charge, boarded a streetcar, and made off with him." 
Here's where the story really gets interesting. Word got out that Martin was being hidden in "Urling's House." My best guess is that this is referring to the residence of Walter C. Urling, a student who appears to have been on both the football and track teams. He's not listed as a senior in 1908, and I find no mention of Urling in later yearbooks, so I can't say for certain if he even graduated. And this is just a best guess. Gray assumes you know these key details, so he doesn't spell out where exactly this is. Well it just so happens that our Maggy is neighbors to the Urlings, and when the mob of plebes came prowling around, she got so frightened by this band of hooligans and mischief-makers that she phoned the police. 
Now how much truth is in this? To my surprise, pretty much all of it, apparently. On page 82, we get a history of the plebe class from one Lowell "Nick" Nicols, who claims to have been present at the "Siege of Urling's." The story matches up extremely closely, minus the detail about Martin being taken to a doctor's office. Instead, Lowell tells us that the "most reliable reports" speak of a scuffle for possession of Martin's horse-drawn carriage following the fight at Junction Hollow, during which the juniors ultimately prevailed, and boarded a streetcar with Martin. And of course, Lowell makes no mention of our fictitious Maggy phoning the police, but instead it was the unnamed neighbors of Urling's. Though search parties resumed the following day, it seems the plebes never recaptured their president. It's left as an exercise to the reader to figure out how and when Martin returned. Presumably the juniors got bored, but Lowell felt this to be too obvious to even mention.
In conclusion, Carnegie Tech students used to go pretty hard.

Dear Cass,
There is no right or wrong way to do this thing. I keep thinking that if I just figure out how to balance everything, how to study right, organize my tasks, find faster routes to class, I can somehow escape what it really is. I keep forgetting that what it really is is already pure joy. There is no best QPA to have gotten, no best set of activities to have done. There is only what you are doing right now. The rest may or may not come. As it turns out, it kind of doesn’t matter.
Kosbie tried to give me an AIV this week, apparently my code for the last homework set off some flags for plagiarism in Autolab. When I went to meet with him though, he showed me the code I had apparently plagiarized, and I had literally never seen it before. Of course he didn’t believe me when I told him that, but it was genuinely pure coincidence that I had written something so similar. After we talked, he said he believed me and would let me off the hook since it was my first time. It ended up being inconsequential. Things like this come and go, and I can only trust that my instincts are leading me the way I should be going. 
I know that there is nothing wrong in Gardens anymore. I cannot tell you how I know this, but it is very clear to me that everything is okay now. There are no more ghosts. People are walking around and going to their rooms and sitting in the lounge just as they’re supposed to.
I don’t know the cause of what happened last week, obviously, but now that I have stepped back from it, it seems more symbolic to me than anything. I’ve been haunted by Lou since we got back here, why shouldn’t he show up in my room? As for the mysterious disappearances of everyone — maybe it was a coincidence. Maybe there are just some things I am meant to handle on my own. Maybe they were all kidnapped. 
My resolve to move on from it all is being disturbed by only one thing, or rather, one person. I decided to tell Henry about what happened. We’ve been seeing each other every week now, and it was one of those things. I had already told him how my day was, how my week was, and how I was doing, etc. If I didn’t mention The Incident, I would have had nothing else to talk to him about. 
He seemed oddly understanding about the whole thing, even though it is quite obviously very abnormal and not necessarily a great omen for my sanity as a whole. He seemed more interested in understanding my history with Lou than anything else, which I guess is probably how I would act if he had told me that his ex-girlfriend showed up in his dorm one day. 
I told him the whole story, how we were together in high school and a little bit in college, how he was my best friend and now he is in California and things are very different. He just listened and didn’t say much of anything about it. He remarked that it must have been nice to see him after so long. I said it was.
Anyways, I’ve been talking about myself for long enough, as if you don’t also have something very interesting and important going on in your life right now. I know you’ve already told me about the first few long nights with Wendy, but I want to know more. Have you talked about relationship stuff yet? Are you going to? You really don’t need to, but it’s just curious since you sort of just got together without talking about it at all. I really love your vibe together; I have the feeling it’s going to last for a long time. Tell me more.
Love,
Maggie

Dedicated to Carlyle Najarian. 
Seldom does one ever see a film which is as venerated and idolized by the current generation as Disney Channel’s “Lemonade Mouth” (2011). It is a sensation which has touched many people born near the turn of the second millennia. They worship it to such an extent that it is necessary to be cautious when choosing the words to describe this movie. Any sentence detected as having an ounce of contempt or ridicule for this film will be seen as an imposition on the culture and childhood of millions of adults today. 
This film, along with many of its sister films devised by Disney, forged the children born before internet hit the mainstream (1999 - 2004), culminated in a generation of singing and dancing kids who were glued to their television screens and consumed every piece of Disney media that was fabricated. Those who look at this time with disdain or adoration can both admit that it was a time unlike any before or since.
These Disney Channel Original Movies (DCOMs) are revered by our generation because they were life changing for many. With approximately one DCOM released per month during the early 2000s, these films touched upon every topic, interest, hobby and pastime that could interest a growing child of that time, and managed to squeeze any and all of them into 90 minute packages of entertainment, leaving no child bored. “Right On Track” (2003) is about girls coming out on top in the male-dominated sport of car racing, a very real struggle for many girls growing up. “Go Figure” (2005) is about a girl contending for worldwide acclaim in the figure skating world and her willingness to make sacrifices to achieve her dreams. 
These movies were the true equalizers of cliques in schools and managed to bring all of us together, teaching many of the important lessons necessary to our society. To many, these Disney Channel movies were modern versions of Aesop's Fables and gave lessons about mature topics we didn’t have anyone else to give us. “Color of Friendship” (2000) deals with racism and shows how friendships can transcend superficial things like skin color and be a cure to racial assumptions and prejudices. “Tru Confessions” (2002) shows us a girl living with a brother who has autism and how delicate such a situation is. These topics, racial prejudice and neurodivergencies, are dealt with by some children growing up, but not all. That is why it’s imperative to bring up such subjects in a mannerly and cultivated fashion. Luckily, these Disney movies do just that. 
The importance of these films cannot be overstated for the generation currently transitioning into full-fledged adulthood. The most beloved of these DCOMs may be “Lemonade Mouth,” a story about a group of kids in detention forming a rock band to fight back against the systematic favoritism of a parochial school principal. 
The movie serves as a time capsule of early 2010s entertainment, when every villain was a one-dimensional churl and every main protagonist had this strange, often tense and never ideal relationship with their parents. It seems that the purpose of these pictures — to teach children a moral or ethical lesson — and the lack of progenitors within Disney films is directly related. Disney is attempting to be a storyteller to children who relate to the struggle of a single-parent household or a quiet and unconnected relationship to parents, and fills that gap in teaching for the betterment of children.
Just like many of the others, "Lemonade Mouth" presents five high schoolers with non-ideal households, with problems such as getting a new stepmother, an imprisoned father, not wanting to pursue the dreams your parents have for you, not being able to relate with them, or just being a rebel against them. While this sentiment was and still is real for many children, it is at times acted out in strange ways throughout the film. 
For example, the most outlying character in the entire film is the main character Stella (Hayley Kiyoko), who is seemingly radically against everything to a borderline comical degree. She gives no second thought to the consequences of her actions, considering that she had just moved to a new school and immediately became a public disruptor. Her only positive attribute is that she is the only character who attempts to keep her band together. The rest of the band continuously considers giving up at the slightest mishap, which does get to the point of annoyance for the audience. 
The general idea of these social rejects getting together to form something greater than themselves is relatable for some kids, but plays out in fashion that forces musical numbers at times when they feel inappropriate. When the band members are all sharing their domestic problems with one another, and Olivia (Bridgit Mendler) begins to break down in tears, Stella just breaks out into song. This brings us a number that is wonderful — make no mistake — but the scene comes off as flawed. 
Another negative quality of the film is the bad use of Automated Dialogue Replacement during the musical numbers. There are entire sections in which you can visibly see the characters’ lips not move, yet hear lyrics being sung. This isn’t new to musicals, as “My Fair Lady” (1964) is infamously known for having Audrey Hepburn butcher the great play, with post production editing having to use shots of her mouth looking away from the camera to even function as a motion picture. That was the 1960s, so the technological setbacks were a reasonable excuse for that sort of thing. "Lemonade Mouth" was made 11 years ago, and with a practically infinite budget (considering The Walt Disney Company is producing the project), there is no excuse for it, especially when singing is the main focus of the film.
Apart from these issues, "Lemonade Mouth" is not such a bad picture. It is what one expects from a campy, no-substance entertainment children’s picture. It has charms and character, like the cast, some of whom went on to become famous stars, and one went on to become a convicted armed robber. Overall, the plot is not as sappy and childish as DCOMs are often thought to be, and can be respected for attempting to speak on the topics that children maturing into young adults have to deal with. It is a picture which will be revisited by our generation repeatedly. Whether or not it is worthy of the great attention which it garners is up for debate. It’s a fairly well-made film, and it's soundtrack is well-mixed and has a few fantastic standalone tracks worthy of being regular plays. I’m glad to have finally seen it, as it stands as a cornerstone of the childhoods of many. They will be passed down so that their message may live on ad infinitum. 
Thank you for initiating me, Carly. 7/10 film.

Last weekend, Scotch'n'Soda put on four fine performances of "Something Rotten!," a musical-comedy about two aspiring playwrights as they go to increasingly ridiculous lengths to outmatch the popularity of their contemporary, William Shakespeare. I performed in the pit band (yes, that was a real live band you heard), a 12-piece ensemble of the most talented and dashingly handsome musicians ever assembled in Carnegie Mellon. Located in the Connan Room (on account of not being able to fit in McConomy), we were connected to the auditorium by a rat's nest of audio wires roughly as thick as the transatlantic fiber optic cable. By some combination of ingenuity and divine luck, the sound crew gave us four shows without any technical hiccups. Nice work, sound crew. 
After four grueling days of rehearsal lasting 'til 1 a.m., followed by a two-show Friday and two-show Saturday, I was excited to hear how the thoughtful and intelligent media critics at Pillbox would review our performance. How shocked I was to find that there was no plan to put a review in last week's issue. I would have written this last Sunday, but you'll have to forgive me for being too exhausted to assemble coherent sentences. After resting up, I decided that if nobody else would write the review, it was up to me. Because if The Tartan doesn't write about it, did it even really happen?
The musical follows two brothers, Nick and Nigel Bottom, as they struggle to write a hit play that will launch them out of poverty into stardom. The elder, Nick, harbors deep resentment toward Shakespeare, who resides at an untouchably high level of celebrity ("God I Hate Shakespeare"). He consults Thomas Nostradamus, a soothsayer, from whom he learns that the next big thing in theater will be musicals ("A Musical"). After struggling to figure out what a musical should be about, he asks Nostradamus what Shakespeare's greatest hit will be, who erroneously tells him it will be a play called "Omelette" (Hamlet). The Bottom brothers do their best to interpret Nostradamus' glimpses of the future, and they put together a horrendous motley show consisting of mismatched plot details of famous Broadway hits ("Something Rotten!/Make an Omelette"). Shakespeare exposes their treachery and has them sent to trial, which results in the brothers being banished to the New World ("Welcome to America"). Then they bow ("Bows") and everyone gets to leave ("Exit Music"). The show is a love letter to Broadway, littered with musical motifs and references to famous shows, most of which I wasn't smart enough to pick up on. But I'm sure one of you out there got them all.
You may have noticed the occasional disconnect between the singing and the music — perhaps a missed entrance, or a vamp went a bit too long. Oddly enough, every single one of those errors was actually the fault of the actors, not the pit. Strange.
Jokes aside, the cast did a phenomenal job. Having chatted with one of the actors and taken a piss next to another, I can confidently say that they were all a fine group of talented and charismatic thespians. Our leading man Joshua Malley played Nick Bottom, a flawed but sympathetic protagonist who goes to morally dubious lengths so that his wife, brother, and future son can live a better life. Wallis Lucas, playing Nick's wife Bea, gave us an impressive vocal performance during her number, "Right Hand Man," plus moments of well-timed comic relief sprinkled throughout the show. Steven Tao made us fall in love with Nigel Bottom, the archetypical artsy softboy. Matthew Blankley gave us a Mick Jagger and Freddie Mercury–inspired Will Shakespeare, a renaissance rockstar with a fragile ego trapped by his own success ("Hard to be the Bard.") Lance Miller played the gruff-voiced, haughty Puritan preacher Brother Jeremiah, who just can't seem to help but make homoerotic double-entendres (threatening at one point to tie Nick to a post and "give him the rod.") Considering the original role on Broadway was cast as a male, Lillian McDermott's performance of Thomas Nostradamus was especially impressive, hitting several low notes during their performance of "A Musical.'' There was also Portia (Abby Glass), who falls in love with Nigel through their shared interest of poetry; the high-strung and anxious Lord Clapham (Trey DuBose), the theater-obsessed moneylender Shylock (Ashley Offman), plus an ensemble of performers eight-strong. 
And of course, the cast was backed by the inimitable and indomitable pit band, led by our fearless Musical Director Liam Mulligan, who not only played the Keyboard 1 book, conducted the show, and did the voiceover during Shakespeare's rock number ("Will Power"), but also drank no less than one gallon of Turner's Unsweetened Iced Tea during our Friday marathon. I would also be remiss not to shout out Etan Cohn, our other Musical Director who was ever the reliable percussionist — he found the downbeat when I could not. Yours truly played the book for Keyboard 2, for which our incomparable Assistant Music Director Chris Renaud spent 10 hours of his valuable time writing the MainStage program (so if you heard a church organ during the show that was probably me). It was a privilege and an honor to work with such a talented group of musicians, and I'm grateful for the experience. 
I can't speak to the lighting, choreography, mixing, or any of the other things that defined the in-house experience of the audience. I watched the show through our sound engineer's laptop webcam which was streaming video through PhotoBooth, the quality of which was only good enough for us to tell whether the stage lights were on or not. I'm sure there must have been a visual gag about a sign with a black dog on it, and apparently there were tap dancing eggs at some point, but you'd have to ask somebody who actually saw the show. But I have no doubt the production team did a stand-up job.
All in all, it was a pretty good time. If you missed it, have somebody explain it to you in great detail, and make sure you keep an eye out for Scotch'n'Soda's next performance. Word around town says they're doing "Clue" this December, so you better not miss it.

As you go home for holidays,
Knapsack packed to go,
Make sure to leave some kindling
For the Morewood Fire Man
He’s lonely without people
To bother wake and scare
The last of the vanguard
For whom the alarms blare
He lights his fires nightly,
Then snuffs them ‘fore 
firemen come
For he’s a simple Fire Man
Won’t rest ‘till his deed done
He’ll interrupt your studying
Reveal the sneaky links
Clog the stairs A, B, C, D
Don’t even try the ‘vators
He’s why you fall asleep in Math
He’s why your crush won’t text you back
He’s why you’re out there in the cold
looking like a fucking idiot
It just doesn’t seem
to make any sense.
Why do they let him light his fires
When my smoke alarm won’t even
let me vape inside?

If there was ever an excited crowd at an opera, it would be the one at the opening night of the Pittsburgh Opera’s “Marriage of Figaro” this 22-23 season. Arguably the best written by the famed composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, “The Marriage of Figaro” has long been a fan-favorite of both opera lovers and singers alike. Especially given the cast’s extensive history with the show (soprano Natasha Te Rupe Wilson has played the leading role of Susanna before in San Francisco and Evan Lazdowski as Antonio has been Figaro in another production), there were already high expectations for this year’s performance. As the lights dimmed, I looked around the theatre. The older crowd waited expectantly in their seats while a cohort of international students clutched pamphlets in different languages on the background of the show. From the get-go, tensions were high. 
I am very confident in saying that the Pittsburgh Opera’s “Marriage of Figaro” exceeded all my expectations. From the casting to the set design, I felt that every element was implemented perfectly and executed in a way in which even Mozart would’ve been proud of. Although there were a few dissenting opinions from members I briefly talked to in the donor’s club during intermission, I chalk that up to a “back in my day” mindset (the last the time “The Marriage of Figaro” was performed in Pittsburgh was in 2017). The period-accurate interpretation of the show, which is somewhat out of norm these days, enhanced the viewer’s experience. The Pittsburgh Opera’s “Marriage of Figaro” is what people think when they hear the word: opera. 
I will say I try not to research the singers’ profiles beforehand as to come in and let their art do most of the talking. Those who are so caught up in prestige and fame always tend to exaggerate the truth, in my opinion. However, when I say that each and every cast member came in with strength and poise, I truly do mean it. It felt like every member was made for their role. Natasha Te Rupe Wilson’s Susanna in particular was exactly how I envisioned the character—cunning, playful, and headstrong. Michael Sumuel’s titular Figaro completed a perfect pair. They played off each other just how an affectionate and semi-sadistic couple like Figaro and Susanna should. Particularly in scenes where the two would take turns “punishing” the other for being mistrustful, the audience was alive with laughter. One felt so deeply immersed in their relationship after just the first aria.
On the other hand, the Count and Countess, played by Jarrett Ott and Nicole Cabell, excelled as reflections of Figaro and Susanna. Together, they truly became dysfunctional aristocrats, horrible in all their ways yet so, so redeemable even then. Cabell’s performance in particular shocked me the most. While it is usually Susanna who receives the most attention in performances, I felt that Cabell captured the spotlight for her own. She was especially stunning in the period gowns, white-powdered wig and all. In her confrontation scene with the Count in her bedroom, I felt as if I was watching a reality TV show akin to "Keeping Up with the Kardashians" as opposed to a 236-year-old performance. I was truly rooting for her as if I were watching a boxing match by the end of the show. 
Perhaps the most impressive spotlight stealer of all was the Pittsburgh Opera’s own resident artist, Jazmine Olwalia as Cherubino. I wish I had the words to accurately describe the feelings I had while watching her performance. Pain, anger, laughter, confusion, disgust? They were all there, and that, I believe, is a true sign of craftsmanship. Never had I ever been so conflicted about a character in an opera in my life. Olwalia perfected the manners of a young boy struck by cupid’s arrow (hence Mozart’s pun in the name). When dressed in drag, Olwalia used physical gags as a way to engage the audience. Even when unprompted, Olwalia stole the audience’s gaze and made the scene much more fascinating than it would’ve previously been. Sumuel’s Figaro was the same, although I found that his Figaro acted sort of like a mentor — perhaps, a slightly more mature version of what Cherubino was. 
With costume design, I really think this was a step up from the season opener, “Rusalka.” Many of the gripes I had with “Rusalka” were gone here, thanks to what I believe is probably familiarity with the time period and a bigger budget for a more well-known show. I loved the subtle cueing in the outfits of the three smaller antagonists, the Marcellina, Don Basilio, and Dr. Bartolo. As opposed to the working staff’s plain and simple outfits, the three of them don exaggerated frills and uniquely embroidered linings. This works to differentiate them from our protagonists, while also hinting at their lust for revenge and greedy nature. 
Of course, the set design was also beautiful. Highly simplistic, yet highly effective. The use of a stained ivory color to paint the walls was exactly how I envisioned the Count’s mansion. I also loved the ways in which the set was rotated, being used in a multitude of ways that I never even thought possible. The enlarged family tree décor was eventually transformed into the final oak wood garden. I thought that was quite intuitive (special shoutout to set designer, Leslie Travers!). 
“The Marriage of Figaro” is simply a must-see. Even for those who have never once thought about setting foot in an opera house, I can assure you, “The Marriage of Figaro” will transform any preconceived notions you’ve ever held on the art form. As I discussed in my interview with Evan Lazdowski in last week’s edition of The Tartan, I think this truly is the perfect first show for anyone of any background. The comedic nature of the show which differs from many of the famous tragedies that make up a lot of opera companies’ repertoire really allows for a casual viewing. Instead of worrying about formal dress code or using sophisticated vocabulary, I urge everyone to buy a discounted student ticket and just enjoy the show!
Through Nov. 5, at the Pittsburgh Opera. “The Marriage of Figaro” continues with further dates on the 8th, 11th, and 13th. Student matinee is on the 10th.

Dear Readers,
Something something PILLBOX, something something brand new wonderful week...
No More Non-descript Somethings, in this issue we have been dedicated to give you specific Things.
Our operatic correspondent Alison Zheng returns on page 4 with a review of the opera whose musician she interviewed last week! Even if you don’t watch the opera, you can read it here!
William Curvan, rapidly proving himself a strong member of the PILLBOX bullpen, gives us a historiography of Carnegie Mellon University old and new (but mostly old)  on page 6, and his take on Scotch and Soda’s production of “Something Rotten” on page 12. Needless to say, we’re excited to hear what he thinks.
Anna Cappella is still writing her serial on page 8, so you’d better keep reading.
Of course, when the great Jennette McCurdy came by our humble campus, our favorite Ire Alarape took some immense photos, which we proudly display on page 10.
H. F. Chacon Jr. drops another coool retrospective on page 14, this time on an obscure early 2010s Disney Comedy, “Lemonade Mouth.” Sick.
The always effervescent Cole Skuse, renowned editor-in-chief, comes through in our time of desperate need with another enthralling article about the head spinning tie-ins to a hit event of Marvel past on page 16.
Then poem, playlist, the end.
We cannot know much for sure in this ever-changing world, but we can at least promise you a big paper with big ideas and big endings. A new era is upon us.
Best,
your PILLBOX editors

This article contains spoilers for Hickman’s “Avengers” (2012 - 2015), “New Avengers” (2013 - 2015), “Secret Wars” (2015), along with various “Secret Wars”-affiliated stories
Time runs out. Everything ends. That is what “Secret Wars” is all about.
“Secret Wars” is the follow up to writer Johnathan Hickman’s “Avengers” and “New Avengers” series, both of which I very much enjoyed. After the end of the multiverse in the two intertwined series, what exactly is left? The answer is Battleworld! Battleworld is made up of 41 unique regions that were pulled together by Earth-616’s Doctor Victor von Doom, who serves as God Emperor of the patchwork planet. Travel by normal citizens of the domains is strictly forbidden, so the stories are relatively contained to their own space.
While one could just read “Secret Wars” and nothing else, you’d be missing out on a ton of world-building and genuinely good stories that came out of the unique scenario of Battleworld. All 41 regions are unique in their own way and demonstrate the imagination of the Marvel multiverse. (I’ve been using the Marvel Guides “Secret Wars” reading order and the guides on the Marvel Unlimited app.) I’ve slowly been working through the various “Secret Wars”-affiliated stories, and here are some of my thoughts so far. 
Last Days (as a whole)
The Last Days series of comics was fulfilling and filled out the last days of some of Earth-616’s before its collision with Earth-1610, which I really liked. Some of the stories I genuinely liked, while others I didn’t especially care for. “Last Days of Captain America and the Mighty Avengers” didn’t feel like it added anything that the ending of “Avengers” didn’t, “Last Days of Silver Surfer” was okay but nothing more, and I don’t know enough about Silk to really care for “Last Days of Silk.” 
“Last Days of Loki: Agent of Asgard,” on the other hand, was a really good read! It showed a lot about Loki’s craftiness and character that made for a unique side story. “Last Days of The Punisher” built on not just The Punisher as a character, but other characters as well as the end of the world was about to happen. 
Overall, Last Days was a good addition to the end of Earth-616, and I’d suggest at least giving the Black Widow, Loki, Ms. Marvel, and The Punisher stories a shot. 
'Secret Wars Journal'
“Secret Wars Journal” is a really good intro point for anyone that wants to get a taste of what Battleworld is like. Each issue collects two stories from a different part of Battleworld. My favorite story of the collection is “Hell’s Kitchen,” which is in Issue 2. The story takes place in the Bar Sinister domain where Matt Murdock (Daredevil in Earth-616) is the head chef known as “Fare-devil” in the kitchen of Mr. Sinister, the baron of Bar Sinister.
His lover, Collektra, is trapped under the influence of Baron Sinister. Murdock has been trying to have Collektra secretly build an immunity to a certain poison by slowly adding it to her food every night. One night, in a desperate attempt to free him and Collektra from the Baron’s clutches, he poisons all the food to kill his master. However, Murdock learns that Collektra has not built up an immunity, but has been dying and cloned by Sinister every night. Murdock also learns the poison has no effect on the Baron, as he is immortal — a perfectly tragic ending. 
I think this story perfectly captures the potential of Battleworld in a quick and straightforward way. If you don’t want to get a full gist of the world but are still interested, “Secret Wars Journal” is the place to begin. 
'Master of Kung Fu'
“Master of Kung Fu” was a pretty fun story that follows Shang-Chi in the domain of K’un Lun. Shang-Chi has left his father’s house and is now a drunkard on the street. Despite his drunkenness, he still knows how to put up a fight. After some villagers help him escape and some additional conflict, Shang-Chi teaches those in the lowest caste how to fight, thus becoming the master of a house and eligible to take on his father for the throne.
The story is a fun take on Shang-Chi, and I liked the brief cameos of other superheroes in this domain like Iron Fist and Moon Knight. It’s a good and fun story that is definitely driven by character development.
'1872'
In “1872,” we go to the domain of The Valley of Doom, where everything is like the Old West. Kingpin rules over the town of Timely as governor, and sheriff Steve Rodgers stands up to his rule. It’s a classic “good guy stands up to evil guy,” story, but the characterization of many classic Marvel characters makes it a really good read. 
'Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows'
“Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows” seems like a “what could have been” story to me, and I really liked it. This story takes place in Regency, the domain ruled by Regent where most superheroes have been killed and their powers taken by Regent. That is, except for Peter Parker (Spider-man), who ended up killing Eddie Brock (Venom) to save his family. Peter and his family remain in hiding until a larger crackdown on superheroes forces him to take action. 
Overall, I found it a little questionable that Spider-man was the superhero that Regent wanted the powers of the most. Surely having the powers of so many X-men and Avengers would make up for it? I thought Spider-man killing Venom was a beautiful illustration of a Spider-man who is willing to cross lines to protect his family, and the story is very well paced. Highly recommend it! 
'Captain Marvel & the Carol Corps'
“Captain Marvel & the Carol Corps” was a very “eh” story for me. I think part of it is because I simply don’t care for Captain Marvel as a character, and the premise was pretty boring. Essentially, Captain Marvel starts to question the orders she is getting from the Baron of the domain (Hala Field). She is ordered to destroy a ship that has Ultrons on it (spoilers: It doesn’t), and saves the captain Jim Rhodes, who is from the domain of Limbo. Captain Marvel questions authority, etc., etc., her squad overcomes the Baron, etc., etc. Not that exciting of a story, and it ends on a "cliffhanger." 
'Inferno'
I would be lying if I said I enjoyed “Inferno.” It was okay and nothing more. The premise is that in this domain, Limbo, demons have spawned in New York City and taken over Manhattan. A forcefield is put up around Manhattan that keeps all the demons trapped there, but Colossus' sister has become Hellchild, the ruler of the demons of Manhattan. There wasn’t much about the story that held my interest, but it had some okay battle sequences, and Nightcrawler getting turned into a giant monster was pretty cool.

With the Supreme Court's current conservative supermajority, the court is continuously overturning previously held precedents, the latest being affirmative action.
On Oct. 31, the Supreme Court heard two cases concerning affirmative action and race-conscious admissions: one against Harvard and the other against the University of North Carolina (UNC), both filed by Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA). The six conservative justices all seemed to express doubt that race should be considered in admissions processes to promote diversity, suggesting that the court may overturn precedent to rule affirmative action as unconstitutional.
During the hearing, conservative Justices Thomas and Alito expressed skepticism of considering diversity and underrepresented minorities, both adding that they felt the terms had little concrete definition. Liberal Justice Sotomayor argued that race impacted the quality of students' prior educational experiences as an applicant which must be considered, and Justice Brown Jackson argued that if admission boards could consider parental, veteran, or disabled status, it is strange to not be able to consider racial identity. Justice Brown Jackson has recused herself from the Harvard case, as she formerly served on one of Harvard's governing bodies.
An added complication to the admissions cases is the status of Asian Americans, who make up most of SFFA. Despite making up seven percent of the U.S. population, Asian Americans make up about 30 percent of Harvard, with similar statistics at peer institutions. While the public is not privy to how Harvard and peer institutions conduct admissions, most believe that including race in admissions will lower the proportion of Asian Americans in universities in order to promote the proportions of underrepresented minorities such as the Black, Latino, and indigenous populations. SFFA advances that the use of race in admissions is hurtful to the Asian American population, and that race should therefore not be considered in applications. SFFA, as well as Justice Alito, often describe admissions as a zero-sum game in which promoting any one racial demographic would hurt others.
Asian Americans are often called the "model minority," which is the myth that the success of Asian Americans illustrates that other minority groups can achieve similar success, despite other minority groups having a different history of racism in the U.S. While Asian Americans comprise most of SFFA, its president Edward Blum is a white conservative.
The question of affirmative action only really applies to more selective higher education institutions: most colleges accept almost all the students who apply, which means that purposefully creating diversity is not as much of an issue for them. The general U.S. population is approximately 13.6 percent Black, while Yale’s student body is only 6.4 percent Black, and Carnegie Mellon’s is only 2.8 percent Black, while nearby Point Park University’s student body is 14 percent Black, and that of the Community College of Allegheny County is 14.5 percent.
The phrase "affirmative action" is sometimes used incorrectly. The Cornell Legal Information Institute defines affirmative action as "a set of procedures designed to eliminate unlawful discrimination among applicants, remedy the results of such prior discrimination, and prevent such discrimination in the future."
Affirmative action is sometimes conflated with racial quotas, which were ruled unconstitutional for public universities and government organizations in the case Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, but were ruled constitutional for private organizations in United Steelworkers v. Weber. Racial quotas is an informal term referring to the practice of setting a numerical target for how many applicants of a certain demographic to admit. 
Affirmative action was initially promoted to remedy the centuries of racism that still entrench minorities today. Now, the argument has shifted to promoting diversity, and that diversity provides benefits to an educational environment. Both sides of the cases cite Brown v. Board of Education, the hallmark case that decided segregation in schools was unconstitutional. But the two sides disagree on the interpretation: the pro-affirmative-action side argues that Brown indicates the importance of educational diversity, while the anti-affirmative-action side argues that Brown indicates the importance of not considering what they frame as racial preferences.
Other precedents to the cases include Grutter v. Bollinger and Fisher v. University of Texas, which affirmed that race could be considered in undergraduate admissions if the affirmative action policy was "precisely tailored" to achieve diversity when there was no comparable race-neutral alternative. In both cases, SFFA says that UNC and Harvard have not adequately considered race-neutral alternatives to the admissions process. SFFA is also generally calling for Grutter to be overturned and that race should not be used at all in admissions.
In the majority opinion of Grutter in 2003, Justice O'Conner wrote, "The Court expects that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today."
During the hearing, conservative justices echoed a similar sentiment to this sentence in Justice O'Connor's opinion in 2003, expressing that it may be time to stop considering race in admissions. The three liberal justices are firmly against such a decision, but beyond Justice Roberts — who may temper the conservative opinion a bit — it seems unlikely they will have a strong sway over the conservative supermajority. Political pundits expect the court's ruling to take longer than average and to be issued in June.

In a momentous election for Brazilian voters, former leftist president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva ousted the far-right incumbent President Jair Bolsonaro, cementing a historic comeback for one of Brazil’s most popular leaders after his arrest in 2018.
Da Silva, affectionately known as Lula, campaigned on defending democracy and pushing back against '*Bolsonarismo*' (Bolsonarism), positioning the election as a referendum on Bolsonaro’s far-right movement. His victory marks the end to a volatile four years under Bolsonaro’s controversial administration, which saw massive deforestation of the Amazon rainforest, a pandemic with the second-highest number of deaths after the U.S., and a serious challenge to Brazil’s institutions.
Voters sealed Lula’s victory last Sunday, returning to the polls for a second round of voting after neither candidate secured the necessary 50 percent of the first-round vote on Oct. 2. Exceeding expectations, Bolsonaro secured 43.2 percent versus Lula’s 48.4 percent in the first round, triggering a runoff election on October 30. And on Sunday night Lula was declared victor at 50.9 percent and Bolsonaro trailing closely behind at 49.1. 
The tightest election since Brazil regained its democracy in 1988, Bolsonaro’s defeat also represents the first time a sitting President has lost re-election. 
Despite fomenting suspicion about the election for months, many of Bolsonaro’s political allies were quick to certify the results, while Bolsonaro himself remained quiet. International leaders also quickly spoke up, congratulating Lula and hailing the moment as a return to democracy in Brazil. 
President Biden issued a statement congratulating Lula on his victory “following fair, free, and credible elections,” stating he looked forward to cooperating. Other countries -- including France, Spain, and Canada -- offered similar congratulations to Lula, affirming thr election’s legitimacy. 
Latin American leaders likewise quickly flocked to Lula. Argentina’s President, Alberto Fernandez, called it a “new era in Latin American history. A time of hope and future that starts right now.” 
Gustavo Petro, Colombia’s first leftist president, tweeted, “Long live Lula,” and Bolivian President Luis Acre declared that Lula’s victory “strengthens democracy and integration in Latin America.” 
Brazil’s shift to the left also fits a broader pattern: the resurgence of left-wing governments in the region. With Lula’s election, six of the seven largest countries in the region are now left-leaning, signifying a new “pink tide” sweeping over Latin America. The resurgence is significant in a region where leftist governments are historically victim to regime change and foreign interventions, particularly by the United States. 
Lula officially enters office on Jan. 1. 
“It’s Over”
On Tuesday, Bolsonaro broke his nearly two-day silence since the election declaring, “As president and as a citizen I will continue to follow all the commandments of our constitution.” While not explicitly conceding, Bolsonaro reportedly told judges at the Supreme Court afterwards: “It’s over.” 
Bolsonaro’s brief silence earlier this week stoked anxiety that he would attempt to overturn the results after years questioning Brazil’s election integrity. Bolsonaro, an ex-military officer, is an ardent supporter of and apologist for Brazil’s former military dictatorship — which emerged after the U.S.-backed anti-communist coup in 1964 — and has defended the dictatorship's killings and use of torture. His affinity for the military dictatorship is clearly shown: He stocked his cabinet with military personnel, once brought tanks to Congress’ steps, and has said, “It’s the armed forces that decide whether people live in a democracy or a dictatorship.”
Bolsonaro has a consistent track record of anti-democratic and anti-communist principles and spewing violent rhetoric. His violent anti-democratic stance has been a hallmark of his far-right political career for years, with him quoted in 1999 as saying, “Voting won't change anything in this country. Nothing! Things will only change, unfortunately, after starting a civil war here, and doing the work the dictatorship didn’t do. Killing some thirty thousand people, and starting with [social democratic President Fernando Henrique Cardoso]. If some innocents die, that’s just fine.” 
Throughout his presidency, he persistently attacked Brazil’s democratic institutions. In the past, Bolsonaro has spread disinformation about Brazil’s electronic voting machines, considered some of the world’s safest, claimed the last election was fraudulent, and attempted to alter electoral procedures according to these unfounded fraud claims. He attacked and intimidated the judiciary, threatening Supreme Court judges, who were investigating him on misconduct and corruption charges as well as his disinformation operations, that he would act “not within the bounds of the Constitution.” Attacks against the media, academia, healthcare workers, political dissidents, the country’s democratic institutions, and the vilification of the Brazilian left — all defined his presidency.  
Political violence also characterized Bolsonaro’s campaign. Prior to the election, Bolsonaro suggested he might not accept the election results, claiming he could only lose due to fraud. 
His supporters expressed willingness to take to the streets at his command, and some have even acted on their violence. In September, a Bolsonaro supporter hacked a man who expressed support for Lula to death with a machete. The incident is one in a string of such political attacks. In another incident on Oct. 29, the day before the election, conservative congresswoman Carla Zambelli chased down a man in São Paulo while brandishing a gun. It is illegal to carry a gun in the days leading up to an election, but Zambelli said she did not recognize the Court’s legitimacy on this ruling. 
Reports on election day alleged the erection of illegal roadblocks, concentrated in leftist strongholds in the northeast, by the Federal Highway Police. Silvinei Vasques, chief of the highway police, posted on Instagram the day before urging people to vote for Bolsonaro before deleting it. Although the Supreme Court intervened and voters were only delayed, the incidents stoked fear of voter suppression and intimidation.
Many of Bolsonaro’s supporters believe strongly in his words and unfounded claims, voicing their own cries of fraud both before and after the election. Since the results were announced, many have either been unwilling to accept the outcome or have turned to the military as their last hope, in eerie reminiscence of the military dictatorship. 
After the election, truckers, who benefited from cheaper diesel under Bolsonaro, barricaded major roads in protest. Seeking to break up the blockade, the Supreme Court threatened Chief Vasques with arrest should he fail to comply. A video circulated on Twitter Wednesday showing a crowd of Bolsonaro supporters at one such blockade. Draped in the national flag or dressed in the iconic national team jersey as the national anthem played, the crowd performed what appears to be the Nazi salute while displaying signs which read: “Military is our only savior!” or “Intervention, Now!” The demonstration is now under investigation for "Nazi incitement," a crime under Brazilian law. Bolsonaro has spoken out against the demonstrations, imploring his supporters to cease holding the country. He has simultaneously empathized with the demonstrators and encouraged them to continue protesting peacefully. 
So far, Bolsonaro has toed a careful line between the expectations for Brazil’s democracy and the expectations of his supporters. By refusing to publicly concede and voicing sympathy for his supporters’ feelings of being wronged, Bolsonaro may be construed as pouring fuel on the fire.
Bolsonaro has appeared to back down, but it remains to be seen how the coming months will unfold as the transition of power gets underway in this deeply divided country.
Revival Amidst Turmoil
Lula, the steelworker-turned-union leader born and raised in poverty, served two terms as president in the 2000s, during which time he cemented himself as an international figure and possibly Brazil’s most lauded politician. After elevating both Brazil’s people and its international presence, Lula left office in 2010 with an almost 90 percent approval rating. 
But in 2018, Lula was convicted on corruption charges after becoming embroiled in a sweeping investigation about corruption in the government known as Operation Car Wash — or Lava Jato, in Portuguese. 
Lava Jato centered on Brazil’s state-run oil company, Petrobras, where bribes were funneled to politicians through contracts with the company. The investigation reached far: It implicated 16 companies, involved nearly every major party — accusing at least 50 congresspeople and placing four former presidents under investigation — and dealt with roughly five billion dollars in bribes. 
Lava Jato rocked Brazil, making the judge who presided over the investigation and federal prosecutors national heroes while vilifying Lula’s Workers’ Party, leading to President Dilma Rouseff’s impeachment and denying Lula’s presidential bid. 
But Lava Jato would create its own scandal when evidence revealed the investigation had become complicated by politically motivated bias and misconduct. Reporting revealed open animosity against political opponents with investigators directing attention towards people considered hostile and away from political and business allies. Leaked conversations also suggested Rouseff’s impeachment was partly an attempted intervention into Lava Jato by opposition leaders who would later be implicated. 
Prosecutors were found colluding with Judge Moro as well as collaborating, possibly illegally, with U.S. prosecutors. Moro also fast-tracked Lula’s sentencing to block his candidacy, effectively helping Bolsonaro win the 2018 election. Moro later joined Bolsonaro’s cabinet as his justice minister. 
Evidence also suggested Lula’s conviction, centering on a beachfront property allegedly gifted to him, was built on poor evidence. 
In 2019 the Brazilian Supreme Court ruled that Lula’s incarceration as he sought appeal was unconstitutional, ordering his release after 580 days in prison. A subsequent ruling in 2021 found Judge Moro biased and that Lula’s case had been tried in the wrong court. The Supreme Court threw out Lula’s convictions, making him eligible for the 2022 election. These pivotal rulings lead us to today — the completion of Lula’s political rebirth. 
Crowds welcomed Lula’s return with cheers of joy. Those crowds returned Sunday when millions took to the street, predominantly dressed in red, to celebrate Lula’s historic victory. 
The Difficult Road Ahead
Lula is entering into a political arena dramatically different from the one he exited in 2010. Lula campaigned on the promise of bringing normalcy and  prosperity back to Brazil once again. 
His presidency portends good news for the environment, which suffered massively from Bolsonaro gutting protection agencies and promoting extractive industries, thereby accelerating deforestation. Lula wants to roll back these policies, eradicating illegal mining and logging while promoting agricultural conservation practices. Economically, Lula has pledged to raise the minimum wage, increase social welfare, and bolster programs to feed and house people — which he will fund by uncapping public spending and taxing the rich. He has also revived an idea to create a new Latin American currency, called the Sur, to break away from dependency on the U.S. financial system.
But Lula will find himself facing greater opposition than before as he contends with Bolsonaro's lasting legacy: a deeply polarized and unequal Brazil. Pursuing his political agenda will face serious hurdles since many of Bolsonaro’s allies won key elections; Lula will step into office with conservatives in control of both Congress and Brazil’s most powerful states. Lula may even face difficulties from his own broad coalition, ranging from centrists to leftists, who banded together against Bolsonaro but will likely reveal their ideological conflicts once in power. 
To see his ideas realized, to return to a state of "civility," to lift his people out of poverty again, Lula will have to navigate a hostile and treacherous political landscape. But hope and optimism about what Lula’s victory signals for the country’s future still persists in Brazil. 
Upon his arrest, Lula had this to say at his final speech in São Paulo: “The powers that be might kill one, two or three roses, but they will never be able to stop the spring from coming. And our struggle is a quest for the spring.”
And in his victory speech Sunday, Lula proclaimed, “They tried to bury me alive. And I am here.”
For Lula’s supporters, the arrival of spring may be upon them.

A week after Elon Musk completed his acquisition of Twitter, the company laid off approximately half of its workforce. About 3,700 employees lost their jobs on Friday, many of whom found out before they even received an official notice when they lost access to their work laptops, emails, and Slack channels.
Musk expressed his intent to buy Twitter in 2017 and again in January 2022, repeating his desire of privatizing it earlier this year in April by paying $54.20 per share. He was already the company’s largest shareholder with a nine percent stake. By July, however, he tried to back out of the deal, citing a report that alleged that five percent of Twitter’s user base is made up of bots. This was a breach of the legally-binding agreement Musk made to acquire Twitter, which led to Twitter suing Musk in the Delaware Court of Chancery. Musk purchased Twitter on Oct. 27 at the same price he had originally offered back in April. Within a day of the takeover Musk fired some of the Twitter's top executives, including CEO Parag Agarwal, CFO Ned Segal, and Head of Legal Policy Vijaya Gadde. Musk had also previously tweeted his criticism of Vijaya Gadde, who spearheaded Twitter’s content moderation policies during the takeover attempt. According to Musk, because the platform loses $4 million every day he had to cut jobs. Analysts speculated that Musk overpaid by $20 billion and would have to make significant cuts, which would result in at least 30 to 50 percent of the staff being laid off. 
Twitter employees were notified that layoffs would begin on Friday, and that they should not go to the office until cuts were completed. Tweeps, as Twitter employees call themselves, started posting a “salute” emoji on their Twitter pages and internal Slack channels. Some reports indicated that earlier in the week, Musk brought in engineers from his other company Tesla, and asked them to review code written by Twitter employees, who were then alleged to have been laid off on the basis of the number of lines of code they had written. The official notice, which was sent to the employees who were laid off, did not carry the name or signature of Musk, their employer. 
Large swathes of content moderation and ethical AI teams were all laid off during the cuts on Friday, including the Twitter META (Machine learning Ethics, Transparency and Accountability) team — led by notable researcher Rumman Chowdhary — and the Curation team, which helped contextualize information in the “Moments” tab and helped fight misinformation. Other teams like the Human Rights team, which protected users (including journalists and activists) from human rights violations in areas of ongoing  conflict, and Accessibility Centre of Excellence team — which improved site accessibility for its disabled users — were disbanded. Several on-call and site reliability engineers were laid off, as was half the Public Policy team and a significant chunk of the Communications team. Yoel Roth, the head of Safety and Integrity at Twitter, said that 15 percent of its trust and safety staff were let go during the layoffs, but the core moderation capabilities are still intact. 
Chief Consumer Officer Sarah Personette, who also served as head of ad sales (Twitter’s main source of revenue), resigned on Tuesday. With market uncertainty on the direction in which Twitter is headed, several companies including Volkswagen and General Mills have paused ad spending on the company. Musk tweeted unverified claims that Twitter had a massive drop in revenue because of pressure on advertisers from activist groups. In response, one of the marketers, who claimed to have met with Musk the day before the tweet, explained that the concern of advertisers is “content moderation and its impact on brand safety/suitability” and that even though Musk claimed to be committed to content moderation, he had laid off 75 percent of the moderation staff. Musk then blocked the marketer but later unblocked him.
With advertising currently a shaky source of revenue for Twitter, and Musk needing to pay over $1 billion in interest for the loans he had to take to buy the company, he has been actively looking for other sources of revenue with the help of his advisors like the angel investor Jason Calacanis. One of Musk’s first initiatives as the new owner of Twitter has been to release a new feature to Twitter Blue subscribers, which would enable its users to receive a blue checkmark on their profiles for a fee of eight dollars per month. For long, the blue check has been a symbol that denotes a verified user who is usually a celebrity, journalist, activist, media figure or some other notable public figure. Twitter introduced a verification system in 2009 to sort out authentic accounts from impersonators, increasing integrity of user experience on the site, after high-profile cases in which some celebrities were impersonated by fake accounts which had duped other users. But some others, like Musk, criticize the system, as they believe it was imposing a class system where verified users are at the head of the totem pole of the site. Twitter Blue was launched this year with a price of about five dollars a month, providing exclusive features to its subscribers like the ability to edit tweets after posting them and to bookmark folders. Musk initially set Twitter Blue at $20 a month and announced that, starting Monday, Nov. 7, only users who are subscribed to Twitter Blue will be verified users. This drew criticism from prominent users like writer Stephen King and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Musk reduced the price to $8 a month for American users. 
There was also criticism from civil rights groups and other users that the move to release the new verification feature the day before the midterm elections in the United States would cause a significant increase in the spread of misinformation and confusion on the platform, which many users see as a reliable source of news. Twitter employees working on this feature were told by their managers that they are expected to work 12-hour shifts seven days a week, with the implication that this would make or break their careers at the company. After widespread criticism on the timing of this release, and glitches in the feature’s debut to existing Blue subscribers, Musk has pushed the date of the debut to after the midterm elections. 
Musk has continued to tweet his ideas for improving Twitter, including the ability to add long-form text to tweets and to improve the search feature. The ability to tweet long-form texts is already a feature that was being developed by the Twitter Write team, which was laid off on Friday. Jason Calacanis, along with Musk’s other advisors, has been soliciting ideas from Twitter users and said that TweetDeck is high on the priority list of features to develop. However, a former Twitter employee revealed that most of the TweetDeck team had been let go during the layoffs.
Meanwhile, reports say that Twitter management has reached out to at least a dozen former employees it had laid off to bring them back into the company, as it believes they were laid off by mistake or before it realized that their skills and experience are required to build the features that Musk wants to introduce on the platform.

North Korea is once again testing missiles, marking their 30th day launching missiles this year.
This recent round of tests is due to military drills between the U.S. and South Korea in the region. Gawon Bae of CNN noted that the joint exercises between the two countries are named “Vigilant Storm,” and started last Monday with the intended end date of last Friday. The exercise included 240 aircraft and thousands of service members, which led to North Korea issuing multiple objections throughout the week before starting weapons tests last Wednesday and Thursday.
This round of tests was notable for a couple reasons for North Korea. 
Yoonjung Seo of CNN explained that the round of missiles tested on Wednesday was the highest number of short-range missiles launched in a day, leading to the Japanese Prime Minister, Fumio Kishida, to categorize the launches as at an “unprecedentedly high frequency.” This included 23 missiles of different types launched across both sides of the peninsula, including some surface-to-air missile tests into the waters off the coast. Seo furthers that such tests have pushed the boundaries of international waters, which North Korea does not recognize, including at least one ballistic missile that fell into the sea outside Japan’s Exclusive Economic Zone and others that fell on the South Korean side of territorial waters.
Such tests were seen as a provocation and encroachment onto territory by the South Korean officials. Seo explains that South Korea had an immediate response, launching “three air-to-surface missiles from F-15K and KF-16 fighter jets.” The missiles were launched northward of the NLL (the maritime barrier between North Korea and South Korea waters), at an equal distance to the earlier encroachment by North Korea. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff explain that the intent of the strike was to show their ability to efficiently and accurately respond to any North Korean provocation. 
This response did not dissuade North Korea, as missile tests continued into Thursday.
Notably, these tests included a failed launch of one of North Korea’s most powerful intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). Bae explains that the missile, suspected to be a Hwasong-17, the most advanced ICBM owned by North Korea that was only first successfully tested in March of this year, was launched at 7:39 a.m. local time into the sea east of the Korean Peninsula. Despite the potential for record-breaking launches, as was the case with the March testing of the Hwasong-17, this missile appears to have experienced failure halfway through. Indeed, Bae explains that South Korean officials believe that the missile only succeeded in separating at the second stage before failing and falling into the sea. Information from Japan’s Defense Ministry seems to corroborate this, as the launch had a maximum altitude of 1,242 miles, less than a third of the March test’s maximum altitude. 
This prompted further responses from the U.S. and South Korea. Bae furthers that the Vigilant Storm exercises were extended without a definite end date, as a way to show unity in the face of North Korea missile tests. This was followed by more North Korea missile tests Thursday afternoon. 
BBC notes that accelerated testing is also seen with a similar expansion in the distances the missiles that are being tested can reach. The Hwasong-17 is not just North Korea’s first ICBM, but one that can reach all of the continental U.S. and potentially carry three to four warheads with it rather than one, making it a larger threat. This is within the larger threat that North Korea will resume nuclear warheads, with BBC noting this could include their new smaller nuclear warhead technology that can fit on weapons of various ranges. North Korea resuming nuclear warhead testing has been predicted for a long time, but recent advancements in missile testing makes it appear closer than ever. 
In the meantime, it is likely that missile tests and escalation in the region continue, especially while the Vigilant Storm exercises are ongoing.

The Office of Community Standards and Integrity (OCSI) gave a presentation this past week regarding academic integrity standards in the Carnegie Mellon community. The current Academic Disciplinary Actions (ADA) process was set in Fall 2019. For a first violation, there is action on the course level. For a second violation, there is a review by the Academic Review Board. In 2019, the process for graduate students was made to be in line with the process for undergraduate students.
Last fall, there were a total of 284 Academic Integrity Violations (AIVs). In Spring 2022, there were 218. A total of 36 cases were brought to the Academic Review Board in the Fall 2021 as well. Many of the AIV cases had common themes: reusing work from previous semesters, using online resources and technology to collaborate (such as text, messaging, chats, etc.), and group violations. 
The OCSI is creating a working group for the 2022-2023 academic year that will be made up of faculty, staff, and students to review current procedures and make recommendations for changes/updates to current policy that will go into effect for the Fall 2023 semester.
The Committee on Student Organizations’ (CoSO) proposed bylaw change was also revisited this past week. There was unanimous consent by Senate members to change the language of the proposed bylaw amendment to clarify language regarding Undergraduate Senate or Graduate Student Association members that serve on CoSO. After further discussion, a motion was made to table the rest of the discussion to a further date.
The Joint Funding Committee (JFC) Bylaw Amendments Presentation that was scheduled for last week’s meeting was also presented during this meeting. Proposed changes included adding additional requirements to receive an honorarium, introducing a new subcommittee structure, raising the threshold for Joint Ratification budget appeals to ⅔ supermajority instead of ½ simple majority, and removing old and obsolete language. The motion was approved 22-0-2.
The Senate Fiscal Policy Amendments Vote from last week was also revisited. The motion was approved with ⅔ supermajority, 16-5-1. 
Senate resolution S.R.02.2022 was also presented and was endorsed unanimously by members of the Senate. The resolution states the Senate’s endorsement of “establishing a university-wide day of service holiday with no classes on federal, state and local government election days on which CMU students have the opportunity to participate.”

In the interest of honesty and journalistic transparency, I will admit that I have a Twitter account. No, I will not give it to you. I follow an assortment of various funny internet lefties, most of whom I found through YouTube, plus a smattering of funny apolitical accounts. I have a love-hate relationship with the platform. Since deleting the app from my phone, I've been trimming down my time on Twitter, but somehow, I still gravitate back to my feed at the end of every day. Like how one might unwind by smoking a cigarette or watching trashy reality TV, I retreat into my internet hole every night to reduce my cognitive activity to a warm steady hum. It's dessert for my brain. I know I shouldn't, yet I do. My point is, I understand the impulse to gravitate towards political echo chambers. 
It's the same impulse that leads one to click on a compilation of Ben Shapiro dunking on blue-haired feminists at Swarthmore University, or watch a late-night host make stale jokes about Trump being orange — not that those groups are equivalent, of course. I'm not gonna "both sides" feminists and Donald Trump, and hopefully you've caught enough of my political tendencies to understand why. The reason I draw the comparison is that both forms of media thrive on people's desire to watch talented public speakers make a fool out of those you dislike.
Now, I did just point out two examples of unhelpful political discourse that are not from Twitter, so you might be asking, "Isn't this working against your point?" Once again, I want to emphasize that it's not your turn to speak, so please don't interrupt me. Obviously, echo-chamber discourse based around lazy superficial clapbacks can happen everywhere (except, of course, the fine publication in your hands). But I think Twitter is unique among media platforms because of how strongly it encourages and relies on such discourse. The character limit disincentives nuance, and the culture that has formed around the site's mechanics is frustrating and toxic. As fun as it is to see your favorite internet microcelebrity ratio some goon from PragerU, the only purpose of that content is to give you a small hit of dopamine so you continue to keep your eyes glued to the site. 
If you'll allow me (not that I need your permission) to make this article even more meandering, I'll concede that maybe a quippy clapback can, in some cases, be useful. Recently, Canadian twitch-streamer and trans activist Keffals (Clara Sorrenti) was catapulted into nuclear-hot Twitter stardom, and used her fame to ratio some pretty big names, including J.K. Rowling, Ben Shapiro, Jair Bolsonaro, and even current head Twit Elon Musk. For the uninitiated, a ratio refers to a reply or quote tweet that gets more likes than the original tweet — the "ratio" of likes is in your favor. For trans youth, a lot of whom have no places to safely express their identity in real life, online communities may be their only haven. So, perhaps seeing a famous trans streamer knock some transphobes down a few pegs makes them feel a little less alone, or gives them hope that things could get better. But, I still believe the vast majority of clap-back content is derivative, uninspired garbage that serves no utility other than filling the echo chamber. 
Now let's talk about John Fetterman. In the interest of journalistic integrity and transparency, I will tell you I fully intend to vote for him. I agree with many of his policies, although he's far from ideal. His pro-fracking position doesn't sit well with me, nor does his 2013 shotgun incident, in which he held Chris Miyares, a Black man, at gunpoint on false suspicion of being involved in a shooting. In recent months, he's become somewhat of a Twitter celebrity after many of his anti-Oz tweets went viral. 
I am not a fan of this. 
Twitter elevates spiteful and reductive commentary because it gives people the emotional satisfaction of seeing their opponent humiliated without deepening your understanding of anything. Nearly all of Fetterman's most viral tweets are superficial dunks on Oz, but fail to engage with the substance of Oz's platform or his fitness for office. There is so much to hate about Oz; I wrote a whole damned article about that if you're curious. And there's definitely an argument to be made that Dr. Oz is a carpetbagger. But, I don't know how many memes about Oz being from New Jersey I can read and still find it to be a fresh take. There is also something quite, how do you say — cringe — about a 53-year-old man posting a TikTok that features an audio mashup of "Glimpse of Us" by Joji and "All-Star" by Smash Mouth. There is absolutely no shot John has heard of either of those artists. Some 17-year-old intern probably found that meme, and the tweet proceeded to get two million views.
Nevertheless, we are stuck with the wasp's nest that is Twitter in the vehicle-careening-off-a-precipice that is our body politic. Social media has become an inalienable facet of our lives now, and I guess I'd rather that Fetterman be good at using it than Oz. Sucks to suck.

As they competed for an Illinois Senate seat in 1858, Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas, two of the most significant leaders of the late antebellum period, engaged in a series of debates on slavery. Long-term, the Lincoln-Douglas debates stifled Douglas’s political career while simultaneously elevating Lincoln into the national forefront and heralding the 1860 Presidential Election.
Long ago, political debates were more strictly confined to policy and delved a bit more deeply into candidates’ various positions and other serious topics.
But now, in an age where soundbites and tweets are about the maximum digestible amounts of messaging that people can absorb, debates are merely political theater. It is an amalgamation of entertainment, it’s personality-driven, and in general, modern debates are mostly reaffirmations for each candidate’s respective supporters.
I see too often that viewers value the wrong things in debates.
In Pennsylvania’s recent Senate debates, Democratic candidate John Fetterman was widely quoted, “I do support fracking, and I don’t, I don’t — I support fracking, and I stand, and I do support fracking.” This statement was the biggest takeaway for many people. Yes, that is an incoherent statement from Fetterman, but are those 20 seconds all that people got out of the debate — nothing about policy?
Fetterman had a stroke in May and stumbled on his words a few times during the debate. He is working on remedying the effects of his stroke-induced auditory processing disability as he recovers. Because of that, he has trouble parsing sounds in a high-stress environment like a debate. But that does not mean he is unfit to be a senator.
It is difficult to tell whether or not undecided voters are getting enough out of these debates. On the other side of the spectrum, the left still called upon the talking point that Mehmet Oz is not a Pennsylvania resident and, therefore, not a true Pennsylvanian. Why is it we repeatedly hear the same rhetoric about candidates after debates? Part of it is due to the polarized environment that leaves voters feeling particularly intransigent where party loyalty may outweigh the pressing issues, or in many cases, where voters have become aligned with one prevailing issue.
For many, the answer may lie in the fact that candidates often make promises during campaign season — and in debates — that they are never going to keep. Sometimes they are paying lip service; other times, they lack the mandate to follow through. It is rare for a candidate to legitimately connect with the sentiments of the voting public, a power which can truly galvanize a movement. Obama had it; Trump had it. Who is breaking through in that manner in this election, let alone for either party’s prospects in 2024?
Voters are not “issue calculators.” While issues are obviously important, that is not how people decide. It really is a decision many make on vibes.
The Pennsylvania Senate race has been more “vibe-heavy” than perhaps any other significant election in the nation. According to an Oct. 24 AdImpact report, more than $167 million has been spent on advertisements, with 25 percent being based on the personalities of candidates. The Pennsylvania U.S Senate race has been a contest dominated by memes and characterized by personal attacks.
The aforementioned transcendent candidates truly espoused their convictions, regardless of what one may feel about their politics. Obama and Trump used their magnetic approaches to attract voters who were able to then connect to their positions on key issues. These candidates were able to forge strong support, beyond typical rhetoric, in their debates. Here is to hoping more candidates take similar approaches in the future.
In the nation’s four key battleground states, the recent debates ahead of Election Day may not have done much to convince people to switch their allegiances. Hopefully, voters (especially here in Pennsylvania) can see past the style points and return to the quaint mindset that the issues and candidates’ respective positions are what matters most, so we can get past the ping-pong politics of partisanship that have put a stranglehold on our country.

On Oct. 29, tragedy struck the Itaewon neighborhood of Seoul, South Korea, leaving 156 people were killed and 150 injured as part of a crowd crush that had gathered to celebrate Halloween. This disaster is of the largest scale since the Sewol Ferry Incident in 2014 that saw more than 300 people lose their lives. 
101 women and 55 men lost their lives in the incident. There were victims from all over the world, including Norway, Australia, Japan, Uzbekistan, Thailand, and the U.S. A large portion of victims were in their 20s, with some being in their late teens as well.
Itaewon is not a typical neighborhood in Seoul. It is one that may be the most influenced by foreign cultures; this is mainly due to the U.S. army base nearby (that existed until 2018) as well as the neighboring embassies. It is a popular venue for foreigners and young people due its unique foreign restaurants, hip bars, and bustling nightlife. It would make the most sense that the center of Halloween celebrations would be focused here. 
The Halloween celebrations in Itaewon are not planned by any organization, but rather something that came about as people realized for one day a year, they could dress however they wanted — something that may be seen as strange by Korean society any other day. I have not personally taken part in the festival, but drove past it last year; my car was blocked by a swarm of people dressed in costumes. It had an atmosphere where honking at the crowd would make you seem like miserable old fossil who couldn’t read the mood. 
This was last year, when COVID restrictions such as gathering limits and masking were still in place. With most restrictions now relaxed, it makes sense that many people would be excited to enjoy their first proper Halloween party in the last three years. This was very much the case, with 130,131 people having commuted to and from the Itaewon subway station, over double than the day before. 
The crush occurred due to these massive numbers. Video footage shows people crammed in the narrow alleys like sardines. A witness from the event describes it as “not moving, kind-of packed”. With so many people, it would have been incredibly hard to breathe, and many were said to have slowly suffocated to death.  
The aftermath of the disaster is grim. As news spreads over the world and people learn more about the incident, fingers are inevitably being pointed. Some blame the police for lack of preparation and crowd control, while others blame the government and even the president. The police chief has already formally apologized for “inadequate” emergency responses, and investigations are underway. But who is really to blame? 
Personally I agree that the relevant authorities could have prepared better crowd control measures. The huge turnout was predictable to some degree, as it was the first Halloween festival in three years, and it became clear from the early hours of the evening that emergency calls were being made. However, I don’t think that any one party has total responsibility for this incident. A complex variable of factors — lackluster planning, slow response times, and a perfect setting to attract huge crowds — all contributed in some form. In the sense that there is no specific man-made root cause of the incident, I think it can be compared to a really unfortunate natural disaster. 
There have been obvious calls to discontinue future Halloween festivals, as the nation went through a mourning period. Many retailers and companies have canceled their Halloween-themed promotions and events, with street cheering for the upcoming World Cup also canceled as a sign of respect. Needless to say, it is not the most exciting time to be a Korean. May all the necessary steps be taken to ensure something like this never happens again.

According to the hit song from one of my favorite Disney movies “Tangled,” "Mother Knows Best." Sorry Disney, but that’s simply not true. You know who really knows what’s best for you? The wonderful buses of Pittsburgh.
I know too many people who lack proper guidance in their life, and that’s exactly what Pittsburgh Regional Transit is for. Ever been waiting at a bus stop, and the bus just passes right by you? The bus knew that you really didn’t want to go to class that day, so you should just go back home and get some more sleep. Is the bus really crowded, and you’re awkwardly pushed against two people? It’s the bus telling you to make some new friends. 
Pittsburgh Regional Transit’s most recent makeover was part of its glow-up to be the ultimate moral compass. Who on earth would trust someone named “Port Authority”? Certainly not me! The name “Pittsburgh Regional Transit” inspires trust and a deep sense of morality.
Have you wondered why the buses always seem to be so full nowadays? It’s because people from far and wide seek the wonderful wisdom imparted by our gentle guardians. They know what is best for us humble Tartans; that’s why everyone is always rushing to get onto the bus. 
But, I’m really not a fan of how difficult it is to use the buses this semester. Waiting an hour to actually get on a bus because people rush to get on (as it’s hard to know if there will be room for you) or because they just pass by the stop because they’re already filled, sucks. Thus, the true moral compass of the Pittsburgh bus system is the riders. 
I think the Dungeons and Dragons alignment chart does a fantastic job of categorizing the people (or creatures) of the mystical Pittsburgh buses:
Lawful good: People who go all the way to the back of the bus regardless of how full it is. They also make a point of thanking the bus driver when they exit. 
Neutral good: People who automatically sit in the window seat and put their bag on their lap so they don’t take up space.
Chaotic good: People who stand by the back doors to make more space for people to stand, but are in the way of everyone trying to get off through the back doors. 
Lawful neutral: The people who sit in the bendy part of the bus when no one wants to.
True neutral: The people who sit in the middle of the very last row of the bus. 
Chaotic neutral: The people who stand at the front of the bus despite there being plenty of seats available. 
Lawful evil: The person who says “Back door!” at every single stop.
Neutral evil: People who are standing with a backpack on who happen to have no spatial awareness. (I can’t count how many times someone’s bag has hit me in the head…)
Chaotic evil: The people who shout to seemingly no one and make me wish I wasn’t on the bus. Bonus if they steal someone’s food!
I’m not asking everyone to be the epitome of a good bus rider! Like, I will take anyone lawful evil or higher! I know the bus system is just a means to get from point A to point B and I shouldn’t complain, but is it really so wrong to want a good experience? Plus, if you take off your backpack and move to the back, more people can get on the bus! I’m not asking very much, I just want to get home. Thanks in advance!

Novel-tea is The Tartan’s literary and language opinion column, so if you like hot takes and reading about cool ideas in the literary community then this is the place for you!! If you have your own hot take to add to this column, do not hesitate to contact us.
As an English major, Tartan editor, and overall nerd, I quite literally live and breathe writing. I churn out essays like there’s no tomorrow, spend multiple hours contemplating punctuation, and surprisingly enjoy writing bibliographies completely by hand. I truly do love it, but somewhere along the way I got lost in academia. I began to see writing as merely a means to an end — a career skill, a midterm grade, a cover letter — rather than something I actually enjoyed doing. 
That was until a couple nerds and I decided to write a poem a day, everyday, this summer. The perfectionist in me was forced to take a backseat, and I was just writing for the fun of it. It became something I eagerly looked forward to: spending a chunk of time everyday actively experiencing my thoughts but also just relishing in silly creativity. I wrote some decent poems and some really horrible ones, but for once it was just for the sake of doing it.
The reason writing can be so cathartic, especially in the modern era, is that it forces you to be alone with your thoughts. Just you and a blank page. I, like many people, seek out escapism, often filling my little spare time with TikToks, movies, and music. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it makes my life feel claustrophobic.
This semester, once I plunged back into classes, I forgot everything I learned this summer. I write all the time, yet somehow feel more distanced from myself. It became a means again, rather than a place for me to just exist. 
So, last week, when one of my friends brought up “NaNoWriMo” or National Novel Writing Month, I was ecstatic. The concept is simple: write an average of 1667 words every day of November (30 days) and by the end of the month you will have a book of at least 50,000 words. While it is daunting, and I don’t expect to complete it (especially given the fact that I have only completed one day’s worth of writing), the month reminds me that writing is more than a means. 
In a way that few others have been able to, writing challenges like “NaNoWriMo” encourage me to be more intentional with my time and my brain. Allowing myself to let my thoughts be, rather than become constantly consumed by media or homework. 
My hope is that by reminding myself that I have the power to choose what I spend my time on, I will choose myself for once.

From “Blade Runner” to “Cyberpunk 2077,” the cyberpunk genre has carved out its own little place in our society. Typically set in near-future dystopias, the science fiction genre’s portrayal of collapse and destitution contrasted with futuristic technology has fascinated us for decades. Cyberpunk has a pretty interesting history and has inspired a lot, including many online aesthetic movements and even popular fashion movements such as tech wear. 
At its core, cyberpunk is ultimately a moral tale — a scathing criticism of our current society and a warning of the techno-fascist future awaiting us should we continue on our present-day trajectory of limitless capitalist accumulation above all else. Worryingly, we largely pay no heed to these warnings, instead choosing to indulge in the cyberpunk fantasy while spiraling towards that very same bleak future. 
The most depressing part of all? Every day, with every new "brilliant" idea, we creep closer towards possibly the shittiest cyberpunk future ever conceived. It really is a testament to human creativity that cyberpunk’s masterminds craft some of the most destitute and depressing forecasts of human civilization imaginable and yet real-life civilization succeeds at exceeding these in spectacularly morbid fashion. 
Take, for instance, the latest installment in our Shittiest Cyberpunk: Sky-Ads.
In New York City this week, advertisers showcased a new project in the night sky. The demonstration consisted of a mess of lights formed by a swarm of small, unmanned aerial drones flying through the sky. How the project works is rather straight-forward: It is essentially gigantic pixel art. Each drone operates like a free-flying pixel, capable of emitting light and changing the color. When the drones coordinate to build formations, according to pre-programmed maneuvers, each individual "pixel" combines to form an image or even create an animation. The drone technology has existed for some time and has been used elsewhere in interesting applications, such as part of marvelous light shows. 
So, what was the showcase in New York using the drones for? To project giant advertisements into the night sky. The demonstration is part of an emerging technology used to turn the sky into the planet’s largest digital screen and thus, effectively, the world’s largest billboard. 
You heard it right, folks. Corporations and the rich have decided it is finally time to venture out into new and bolder frontiers — it is time to colonize the sky! For too long have our desires been tethered to the Earth! For too long have those avian miscreants flaunted their freedom unabashed, gloating in their skyward haughtiness! Enough is enough. Today, we demonstrate our technological superiority and assert our aerial supremacy! Tonight, we paint the sky in our colors! 
But, in all seriousness, this is royally fucked up. Suffice it to say, I have no positive words or emotions for this newest technological marvel. The technology itself is undeniably interesting, but its application only reveals how pathetic the cyberpunk dystopia unfolding before our eyes is. Forget holographic gravure idols soliciting you in some grimy, neon-tinged red light district, or a cacophony of artificial reality pop-ups beamed directly into your cornea from your Google Glasses as you stroll down the street. The future is looking up into the night sky to gaze upon the stars… and the stars remarkably resemble Mario, or Charizard, or Hyundai’s new Genesis G80 luxury sports car. Honestly, setting the sky ablaze with swarms of glorified lightning bugs is not exactly my idea of cyberpunk. 
But it is a fitting depiction of the cyberpunk future billionaires imagine. These sky ads are a very rude reminder of the bottomless greed of corporations and their capitalist owners, who seek to monopolize every second of our attention in pursuit of further wealth. 
This whole ordeal strikes me as nothing more than a gimmicky stunt, and New Yorkers seem to agree. But to these corporations, advertisers, and their investors, as their language seems to indicate, they see this as a real opportunity. With the sky seemingly in their reach, they see a new real estate market opening up before them. 
This is a reality most of us should be well aware of by now. It is common knowledge at this point that we as people have become both consumers and products. Our time, attention, and data has become commodified and sold to companies always seeking out new consumers. Our use of services, and even goods, is increasingly connected to a complex and convoluted system of rent extraction. Even Pantone is now demanding you pay a subscription to use their colors in digital media, literally paying money for a pixel’s RGB value under their license. Anything and everything that can be commodified is commodified. 
Corporations are finding ways of monetizing the sky, selling parcels of airspace like broadcast time on the radio or an ad-slot for the most horrendous Republican attack ad imaginable on YouTube. Although we are accustomed to this reality, this latest gimmick reaffirms our reality, providing another look into the perverse way in which the wealthy capitalist class conceives of our world. Presented with the awe-inspiring wonder of the night sky, a sky already tainted by the city’s light pollution, they reduce such a beautiful expanse down to the question of: “Can I make money off of that?”
It bears repeating that this is exactly what cyberpunk warns about: unrestrained corporate consolidation, concentrating wealth in fewer and fewer hands, and extending market logic into every conceivable facet of life are not good omens for our future. 
The most remarkable and oh-so-richly-ironic part, the super-wealthy, a central antagonist of the genre, have deliberately molded themselves into pioneers of a cyberpunk future. It honestly should come as no surprise that these billionaires, so bereft of critical thinking — an apparent prerequisite to being admitted into the ranks of the unethical super-rich — seeing in cyberpunk stories not an admonishment or criticism of a society they have built, but rather a blueprint for the future. 
Presented with the option of either working to avert a possible dystopian future or willfully ignoring the warnings the genre offers in favor of self-enrichment, billionaires have chosen a miraculous third option: deliberately and eagerly rushing headlong into a cyberpunk hellscape. 
Yet billionaires are proving, like they always do, to be absolute trash at ushering in this nightmarish future. Instead, these billionaires have set us on our current course towards the multiverse’s shittiest cyberpunk. Their brilliance has produced for us marvels of the pre-cyberpunk age: from a virtual reality "Metaverse" equivalent to Nintendo releasing "Wii Sports" in 3D, to a defective, polygonal excuse for a car named the Cybertruck of all things. How have we come so far as a civilization that the architecture for our future digital reality has been placed into the hands of a person incapable of relating to a human being on a macro-level? How did Marty McFly screw up so bad that the richest man on the fucking planet is a dude whose marketing strategy was advertising his steel-coffin-on-wheels as “briefly able to be a boat?" 
Future historians, if those end up existing, will look back and see how we entrusted our future to a self-destructive billionaire currently demonstrating his scientific genius and business acumen by nose-diving the internet’s favorite bird-watching app into the Atlantic like one of his rockets (minus the self-landing feature).
In case you haven’t noticed, I have no love for these billionaires and their fetishization of cyberpunk. And no, I will not be fielding opinions from the tech-bro-wannabes in the Swartz Center for Entrepreneurship. But, despite my morbid outlook as of now, I do not think we are resigned to some atrocious dystopian fate. There is hope for the future. But it will not come from the billionaires, as they have always proven themselves incapable of working for the interests of the people. 
From trucks literally designed for a dystopian future to turning the sky into a billboard, the greed of a few is pushing us towards a reality I have no interest in partaking in. We might enjoy exploring the dystopian possibilities and futuristic aesthetics of cyberpunk worlds, but we should always remember the futures they represent are ones of collapse and impoverishment. We will not be the billionaires or trillionaires living luxurious lives in their penthouses in neo-Japan. We will become the victims of a catastrophic future we did not engineer, unless we push back against such outrageous ideas as the drone-based monopolization of the sky. 
The most dreaded part? The ad was for "Candy Crush." What the fuck.
