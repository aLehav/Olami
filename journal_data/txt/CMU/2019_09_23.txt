The Tartan football team won their first home game of the season this past Saturday against the 12th-ranked Washington & Jefferson Presidents.
The Tartans are undefeated so far, having won against MIT and Geneva College at their respective campuses the past two weekends. This win against the Presidents is the team's first against a highly ranked opponent since 2003, according to a university press release. 
The Tartans pulled ahead with a field goal in the first quarter coming from placekicker Brandon Nguyen. Nguyen brought the Tartan's total to six with another field goal at the end of the second quarter. Nguyen, a sophomore in business administration, has made all of his field goals and extra point attempts so far this season.
Since the game is the Tartan's first this season at Gesling Stadium, half-time featured the first performance this year from the Kiltie Band, who brought their signature levity to fans of the Tartans already in a good mood from the early lead. 
Some onlookers watched from the UPMC-sponsored tailgate on top of the garage, choosing to watch the game while eating and playing corn hole. Still others, including many Presidents fans, spilled out of Resnik's Tartans Pavilion, choosing the shady locale over the stadium seats at the temperature climbed into the high 80s. 
The Presidents rallied in the high-scoring third quarter, netting two touchdowns to the Tartan's one. The Presidents cleared 94 yards in seven seconds for the second touchdown.  However, they never pulled ahead, and the quarter ended with a score of 13-13.
The Tartans brought the game to a close with a final touchdown in the last six minutes, with another throw from quarterback JD Daytruff, finishing the game with a score of 20-13. 
The Tartans are set to play Saint Vincent College's Bearcats this Saturday on their campus in Latrobe, PA.

It’s nearly Oct., which means the Major League Baseball (MLB) playoffs are fast approaching. The MLB season is the longest of the big four sports leagues in the United States, spanning 162 games, compared to 82 games in the National Hockey League and National Basketball Association, and just 16 in the National Football League. The lengthy duration of the MLB season means that as Sept. draws to a close, players are getting worn down and becoming more injury-prone. Several big names have succumbed to injuries recently, threatening playoff chances for teams across the MLB.
One of the biggest superstars to get injured was the Milwaukee Brewers’ Christian Yelich, who fouled a ball off his right knee on Sept. 10, breaking his kneecap. The reigning National League Most Valuable Player will miss the rest of the season as a result, and the Brewers, who currently occupy the second Wild Card spot with eight games left, will certainly miss his .329 batting average, .429 on-base percentage, and his power. Yelich is ending the year with 44 home runs. Not only have the Brewers lost Yelich, but the team’s other two starting outfielders are battling injuries of their own. Ryan Braun is fighting lower back problems, while Lorenzo Cain is plagued with issues in his left knee and ankle. While Braun and Cain will play as much as their bodies will allow them, a hurting outfield and the loss of Yelich puts the Brewers at risk of losing the Wild Card spot to the Chicago Cubs or the streaking New York Mets.
The Cubs, meanwhile, lost their speedy shortstop Javier Baez back on Sept. 1, when he fractured his thumb sliding into second base. Baez, hitting .281 with 29 homers, was originally thought to be out for the remainder of the season, but has been recently cleared for light baseball activity, meaning he will be available to pinch run. The Cubs also got a scare on Sept. 15, when slugger Anthony Rizzo, who has 27 home runs and a .926 on-base-plus-slugging percentage (OPS), sprained his ankle. The first baseman was initially expected to spend a week wearing a boot before being reevaluated, but returned to the lineup just four days later, hitting a home run in his second at-bat. Nonetheless, Rizzo playing while injured runs the risk of exacerbating the injury, which could hinder the Cubs if they manage to capture the second Wild Card spot. 
Elsewhere in the NL Central, Kolten Wong of the St. Louis Cardinals strained his left hamstring on Sept. 19. Wong, who is hitting .285 and has a .361 OBP, underwent an MRI the following day, but his status is unconfirmed for the rest of the year. The Cardinals are in first in the division, but the Brewers are just three games behind and 8-2 in their last ten games; losing their productive second baseman could be a big blow to the Cardinals when the playoffs begin. 
In the American League, the Cleveland Indians are in a three-way fight for the Wild Card with the Oakland A’s and Tampa Bay Rays, but lost their long-time second baseman Jason Kipnis on Sept. 15. Kipnis, who is 32, broke the hamate bone in his right wrist, which will require season-ending surgery, and likely his time in Cleveland. While he has been struggling this season, hitting just .245 with a .304 OBP, his veteran presence could have been helpful in the clubhouse if the Indians manage to secure a playoff position.
The Los Angeles Angels are not in the postseason picture, 32 games behind the Houston Astros in the AL West, but the loss of baseball god Mike Trout to injury is still big news. Trout last played on Sept. 7, but will not return after the Angels announced that he will undergo surgery on his right foot as the result of Morton’s neuroma, which leads to pain in the ball of the foot. Trout was a likely candidate for the American League MVP award, which he has won twice before, thanks to his .291 batting average, league-leading OPS at 1.083, 45 home runs, and MLB-leading OBP of .438. However, he won’t be able to improve his statistics over the rest of the season, giving the Astros’ Alex Bregman and Xander Bogaerts of the Boston Red Sox a chance to swipe the crown.

The 2019 World Para Swimming Championships ended as breathtakingly as it started, with nine new world records being set on the last day alone. The final medal count saw Italy at the top of the medal table with a whopping 50 medals, 20 of them gold. 
The Italian team boasted a strong mixture of young contenders, such as Carlotta Gilli and Antonio Fantin, and seasoned veterans, such as Arjola Trimi and Efrem Morelli. Among these talented athletes was 19-year-old sensation Simone Barlaam, who not only won every individual race he was put in and helped his team to excel in the relays, but also broke four world records in the process. 
Barlaam dominated his first race, the men’s 100m freestyle S9. Taking the lead from the very beginning, he opened up a gap between himself and the rest of the field that only widened as the race progressed. Finishing with a time of 54.10 — over a body-length in front of the second place finisher in a race that only spanned two lengths of the pool — Barlaam not only won his first gold medal of the competition, but also broke the decade-old world record set by para swimming legend Matthew John Cowdrey by over a second. 
The second race of Barlaam’s championship campaign was the men’s 100m backstroke S9. He had qualified in 4th position that morning, and it seemed like his chances of winning were slim. However, the race progressed much like his first, and he finished in gold medal position with a time of 1:01.22, breaking another world record set by Cowdrey, again by just over a second. In a post-race interview with Paralympic.org, Barlaam says, “I wasn’t sure I could even make the podium, and then breaking the world record of a legend such as Matt Cowdrey — it’s an honor.” 
The most spectacular of Barlaam’s races — and perhaps one of the most remarkable races of the competition — was the men’s 100m butterfly S9. From the start, it seemed that he was once again dominating the competition, and he had a sizable lead at the turn. A late comeback and an extra kick in the last 10 meters from Barlaam’s childhood hero and fellow countryman, Federico Morlacchi, however, had the two Italians’ finishes inseparable. So inseparable, in fact, that the timer showed identical times of 1:00.36, and the two men were both awarded gold medals in the event. When this extraordinary moment was mentioned in a later interview with SwimSwam, Barlaam stated that, “It was just unbelievable. I was speechless! I was over the moon!” 
Barlaam’s final individual event was the men’s 50m freestyle S9. Per his previous races, he led the pack from the starting blocks, breaking his own world record on the way to a 4th gold medal with a time of 0:24.00. 
Barlaam was also an integral part of both of Italy’s men’s relays. Swimming in the first leg of the 4×100 medley relay and as the anchor in the 4×100 freestyle relay, he helped his team to a silver medal in the former race, and to a world record breaking gold medal in the latter. 
In another post-race interview with Paralympic.org, Barlaam addressed his exceptional triumphs. “[The preliminary races] made me realize that I could do better,” he said, “so that’s what I’ve done.” 
It is obvious that he has done more than just simply “better”: Simone Barlaam has accomplished what many athletes can only dream of doing, and he has done so four times in a single competition. 
Born with coxa vara and congenital hypoplasia in his right femur, Barlaam has overcome all the odds. Now, he has set his sights on the 2020 Paralympic Games in Tokyo, and hopes someday to compete in swimming at the Olympics. 
There is no doubt that Barlaam is a swimmer to watch for in the future, and there is no question that he will continue being a critical part of the Italian national para swimming team.

Team USA's adventure at the FIBA Basketball World Cup in China was the story of a young team.
It started as any good young team starts: with a group of rejects and good players who aren't quite good enough to play at the next level, or at NBA all-star level. Some of the best American players, like Anthony Davis, James Harden, and Damian Lillard, decided not to join Team USA, so the team lacked superstars.
The Americans started as a humble squad in contrast to the usual powerhouse. They struggled at first, and they lost an exhibition to Australia before the World Cup. However, the youthful team started to rally, and they won all their other exhibition games before the tournament. Even though they had a target on their backs, Team USA had enough NBA talent to be the favorites for the tournament.
Of course, the players on Team USA were getting ahead of themselves.
The warning signs started in the group stage where the Americans narrowly escaped Turkey, a team whose best players were career NBA backups Cedi Osman and Ersan Ilyasova. Team USA entered the final seconds of the fourth quarter down by two points. It only took a three-point foul by Osman on Team USA's Jayson Tatum and an overtime period in which Turkey missed four free throws for Team USA to win.
Team USA, disappointed with their efforts, were satisfied by bullying Japan and a couple other teams on their way to the quarterfinals. There they met France, and it was unclear whether they would step up against tougher competition.
The Americans could not keep up with a team with more NBA talent, and they lost in the quarterfinal by a score of 89-79. France humiliated Team USA and broke their 58-game winning streak in FIBA and Olympic competition. To make the loss worse, backup New York Knicks guard Frank Ntilikina outscored American star Donovan Mitchell in the fourth quarter.
The Americans then sulked to their consolation game against Serbia, and it showed when Serbia raced to a 25-point lead in the first quarter. Team USA could not come back, and Serbia guaranteed the worst ever American finish in tournament appearances. They then capped off their adventure in China with a win over Poland to secure seventh place.
Team USA's experience in China is one that most of the players will want to forget. By the standards of the teams before them, Team USA in 2019 was too young to bear the expectations of USA basketball. 
It will be easier when their players grow up.

In a timely study conducted by researchers at the University of Cambridge, 743 men and women from the U.S. were given a series of tests to determine a relationship between partisanship and cognitive function. The study found that extremely partisan individuals tended to have lower levels of cognitive flexibility. To elaborate on what this means, the ability to switch between various concepts and tasks is correlated with how much people identify with a certain ideology. 
The study had two parts. The researchers gave the participants standard cognitive tests such as a word association test, a card sorting test, and an exercise where participants had two minutes to come up with uses for everyday objects. The purpose of these tests, according to the researchers, was to use well-established metrics assessing the ability and flexibility of individuals to process different concepts. The participants were also asked to rate their feelings on several issues such as abortion, as a way to judge the degree to which an individual’s identity overlaps with partisan politics.
Based on these tests, the finding was that self-prescribed independents generally displayed more cognitive flexibility than self-prescribed Democrats and Republicans, and the degree of partisan extremity was a predictor for “mental rigidity” in the three cognitive tests that were conducted. People with less cognitive flexibility are also more likely to endorse political violence and sacrificing their lives for an ideology, and they also have more extreme attitudes regarding religiosity and nationalism. 
The study makes some key distinctions. The researchers state that the study is looking at how individual minds process different concepts and ideas rather than assessing the animosity towards different ideas. The research is also meant to show how people come to hold extreme views and ideologies, and not to show that various ideologies are all inherently similar. 
This study confirms what a lot of political scientists have qualitatively analyzed. Looking at different decision-making processes, political parties are very convenient for voters. They allow people to consolidate their viewpoints into a set of ideas rather than try to develop their viewpoints. This is confirmed by the University of Cambridge study, where the researchers elaborate on this idea by saying that people with lower cognitive flexibility see the world in more black-and-white terms. 
In addition, these individuals also are more “susceptible to the clarity, certainty, and safety frequently offered by a strong loyalty to collective ideologies,” said Leor Zmigrod, Cambridge Gates Scholar and lead author of this study in a press release. Often, these individuals tend to not have the time or resources to properly educate themselves on the issues to make informed decisions, which the study confirms is the solution to building more cognitive flexibility, increasing tolerance, and diminishing radicalization.
Zmigrod noted that “past studies have shown that it is possible to cultivate cognitive flexibility through training and education. Our findings raise the question of whether heightening our cognitive flexibility might help build more tolerant societies, and even develop antidotes to radicalization.” Being able to quantify the drivers of extreme thought and intolerance is key to developing strategies to educate individuals and perhaps create more political unity.

Every year, an estimated 785,000 heart attacks occur in the United States. However, there is no known treatment for the damage that follows a heart attack, including the development of scar tissue in the heart, which hinders muscle function and can lead to heart failure.
This month, a company spun out of The University of California, San Diego named Ventrix has conducted a first-in-human FDA-approved Phase 1 study to prove the safety of an injectable hydrogel to repair damaged heart tissue. It aims to restore cardiac muscle function in patients who have experienced a heart attack.
Ventrix’s hydrogel is the first of its kind to be tested in treating damaged cardiac tissue. It is composed of the natural scaffolding of cardiac muscle tissue, also known as extracellular matrix (ECM). ECM hydrogel products have shown to be useful in treating poor blood circulation due to artery disease in other preclinical studies, but never before for heart conditions. Ventrix’s VentriGel can be injected via catheter into patients 2 to 36 months after they have suffered a heart attack.
Researchers from Ventrix published the results of their study in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology: Basic to Translational Science. Karen Christman, professor of bioengineering in the Jacobs School of Engineering and the Institute of Engineering in Medicine at UC San Diego, said in a press release, “Although the study was designed to evaluate safety and feasibility and not designed to show whether VentriGel effectively helps improve heart function, we observed some improvements in patients.” Christman, who is also the paper’s senior author, continued, “For example, patients could walk longer distances. We also observed signs of improving heart function in patients who experienced a heart attack more than one year prior to treatment.”
Upon injection, VentriGel attaches to cardiac tissue and constructs a scaffold for repairs, allowing healthy cells to move into the region and overwhelm scar tissue, thus improving cardiac function. The ECM scaffold originates from pigs, but heart muscle cells from the animal are completely removed before the connective tissue is freeze-dried and processed into a powder. The liquified powder can be injected without surgery and turns into a porous gel upon contact tissue at body temperature.
The FDA-approved study, successfully conducted by Ventrix, monitored the hydrogel’s effects on 15 patients who each received up to 18 injections via catheter into a particular region of the left ventricle chamber of the heart over the course of six months. All of the participants were suffering from some form of heart failure after a recent heart attack, and half had experienced a heart attack in the previous year.
A six-minute walking test and health questionnaire were administered at three-month intervals through the study in addition to MRI scans on the same schedule. VentriGel had minimal side effects and did mitigate symptoms for many participants. However, in order to fully explore the effectiveness of the treatment, Ventrix is preparing to conduct a Phase 2 clinical trial on a much larger scale. If it pans out, VentriGel may make the dangerous aftereffects of heart attacks a thing of the past.

What started out as a passion project has quickly become a campus sensation. Darren Mok, the creator of CMU Lookbook (@cmu.lookbook on Instagram), sat down with me again this week to talk to me about what’s changed and what’s coming for Lookbook.
When I met with Mok last semester, his account had about 600 followers. However, it tripled in size by the end of the last semester, having amassed about a thousand new followers. He attributes a lot of his success to the fact that it started on a college campus, since it provided him with an “interactive fanbase.” People wanted to be featured and got excited when their friends were featured, gaining traction not only with students but also organizations. The Tartan, as well as the Life at CMU and official Carnegie Mellon Instagram accounts, featured Mok’s work on their respective platforms.
However, in addition to his support from the community, his dedication to CMU Lookbook and his consistent work cannot go unnoticed. Although his vision for the page has shifted and he has not maintained the daily posting schedule he once had, a lot of big things are happening behind the scenes for Mok and Lookbook. He did not want to spoil it for us, but these “big picture plans” include expanding — he hopes to get more people involved by recruiting photographers, bloggers, and other creatives to his team — and rebranding the account, as well as collaborating with more of the Carnegie Mellon community.
In the last few months, Mok has worked with the likes of White Porcelain Apparel, a clothing brand created by business administration senior Charles Y. Wang, as well as Lunar Gala, the SPIRIT Fashion Show, and Carnegie Mellon-based music duo AWFBEAT.
Mok has come a long way since the beginning of CMU Lookbook. In the beginning, most of his time taking photos was spent explaining to people what it was, but now that his account is pretty well known, he actually gets to spend his time engaging with the people he works with in more meaningful ways. The account has become more deliberate, and the background work he puts in “can’t be seen concretely,” but he hopes that his effort will show through when he relaunches the account after the “incubation period” is over and the rebranding takes place.
Although in some ways he feels weird being the man behind the camera, as he is often known by his account but not his name, he really appreciates the connections he’s made and the creative community he’s become a part of at Carnegie Mellon and in the surrounding Pittsburgh area. He acknowledged that even though everyone has their own thing, the community has been extremely supportive of each other, “thinking of ways to grow as our own entity” while also “bringing each other up.”
He argued that it’s a “big enough platform” for anyone to succeed, provided that you’re willing to put the time and commitment into whatever project you’re passionate about. “If you really want it to happen and you care about it enough, there’s definitely enough tools and [people] willing to work with you.” He knew nothing about the “creative space” going into it last year, but his passion and drive made everything possible for him.

On the surface, it’s very easy to dismiss Hustlers as some kind of chick flick meant to capture female moviegoers. With a cast like Jennifer Lopez, Constance Wu, Lili Reinhart, Keke Palmer, Cardi B, and Lizzo, it sounded like every young millennial or old Gen-Zer girl’s past and present would collide. Where else would you find a movie with True Jackson and Betty Cooper acting alongside two of the hottest new female artists from the past two years?
Loosely based on New York magazine’s 2015 article “The Hustlers at Scores” by Jessica Pressler, Hustlers follows Dorothy (Constance Wu), known by her stage name Destiny, as she works to make ends meet as a stripper in 2007 New York. Early on in her career, she meets veteran stripper Ramona Vega (Jennifer Lopez), who takes Destiny under her wing and eventually ropes her into a Robin Hood-like scheme to steal money from their wealthy Wall Street clients after the 2008 financial crisis.
I think everyone has a moment where they instantly connect with Hustlers. It’s a moment where every component of the movie seems to fall into place: writer-director Lorene Scafaria’s brilliant screenwriting and storytelling methods, the provoking cinematography, the incredible performances of every actress and actor in the movie, the Great Recession-era atmosphere that Scafaria perfectly recaptures.
For me, it’s the moments when Elizabeth (Julia Stiles), a journalist meant to represent Pressler writing about Ramona, probes into Destiny’s family history and discovers her inner mindset — of Destiny waking up alone in the backseat of a moving car, with no one at the driver seat, climbing over to drive and stop the car. It’s Destiny’s flashbacks to a childhood with distant parents, who left her at her grandmother’s doorstep at a young age, never coming back, that kicked off an entire life of feeling alone and self-dependent. Not only are these scenes stellar examples of exposition alongside blatant narration, but they make Destiny’s thoughts and feelings come alive; audiences can see and understand how she is feeling. The writing is poignant, moving, and speaks to a larger human necessity: a desire for human connection, kinship, and lifelong bonds with one another.
The emotional bedrock of Hustlers — Destiny’s conflict between her own morality and loyalty — helps this connection feel universal. It’s impossible to even try to dismiss the sisterhood and family that Destiny, Ramona, and their crew have formed. Even as it inevitably falls apart, you can’t help but crave, appreciate, and long for the bond between this criminal group. Their squad feels like what you want your group of best friends to still be five, 10 years into the future: still hanging out for Christmas with each other’s growing families, giving each other gifts, drinking too much wine, and remembering the good old days. It’s this strong bond that keeps Destiny in the game for so long: she’s found connections and family that she doesn’t want to let go of, even at the cost of her life.
Constance Wu is the perfect choice to play Destiny. She carries the audience through Hustlers with incredible wit and grace. In portraying Destiny’s inner conflict, Wu creates a balancing act between a calm, cool, and collected leader and a struggling woman trying to get by in every single aspect of life, reaching unexpected and heartbreaking layers of emotional depth. Wu also has amazing chemistry with Jennifer Lopez, who deserves all the praise the media is giving her. Her show-stopping entrance perfectly sets up Lopez’s presence, characterization, and performance throughout the entire movie. Ramona is a perfect foil to Destiny; while Destiny approaches things with caution, Ramona charges into battle. While Destiny hesitates, Ramona refuses to give up. Ramona is constantly taking initiative, “always in control” as Destiny says in the movie — and it shows. Every time Lopez is on screen, she commands it. It’s impossible to look away, and it’s so easy to be mesmerized by her.
In Hustlers, Scafaria uses each of these cinematic components and pieces to tell the story, rather than just letting them be backdrops or meaningless additions. Every little choice — from cameos to costumes — is intentional, making Hustlers a period piece of the Great Recession. Every actor and actress in this movie lets Scafaria’s incredible writing truly shine. Every storyline wraps up in its own meaningful way, each with its own message and story to share. Every bit of humor is perfectly placed, and is later balanced with an emotional weight that further pulls you in. Amid all the glitter, glamour, and money, every component of Hustlers makes for an incredible story and movie with heart and human connection.

At the last concert I went to before attending this one, I left the venue with my hearing impaired for two hours, completely exhausted from the last three hours of moshing to death metal. That’s why it was a nice change of pace that both openers at the Lucy Dacus show, Taylor Janzen and Quinn Christopherson, didn’t even have drums or bass in their set. For both sets, it was just two people on stage playing clean guitar or keyboard and singing their hearts out. Dacus and her band then took over after, and what followed was an hour and a half of melancholic catharsis and incredible music. 
The show took place at the Mr. Smalls Theatre, a small church that has been converted into a concert venue that commonly hosts smaller and more independent artists. Dacus is easily one of the best artists working today. While her songs are not incredibly technical, the composition is some of the best in the growing indie rock genre, and her lyricism offers a lot to think about. For every artist fake music critics cite as evidence for “the death of modern music,'' Dacus is one of several artists working today whom I point towards as evidence that music is alive and well. 
There is something charming about watching concerts at a small venue. At larger venues, you’ll hear the sound come out from massive speakers and if there are instruments, they connect to the speaker systems via Bluetooth. But here, you can see the small Fender tube amps the artists use, with visible cables connecting their guitars, pedals, and amplifiers together. When Dacus’s bassist jumps around while rocking out, the cable flings around with him. These details seem inconsequential, but there is something different about seeing artists play with a technical setup similar to what you’d see at a live high school or college performance. In a weird way, it lessens the disconnect between the audience member and the artist, especially for audience members who play music. The artist’s personality also comes out in a different way. It’s a much more intimate experience, and I feel like I got to know not only Dacus, but Janzen and Christopherson really well. 
The sound mixing at this also sounds much different. In larger venues, the sound can get overwhelming at points as the massive speakers and amplifier walls dominate the experience. But in a small venue, every detail of the soundscape is much more controlled and balanced. You can hear each individual band member so clearly. Dacus’s vocals blend really well with her band, and hearing that mix live was an absolute treat. 
This concert cements Lucy Dacus as one of my favorite artists playing today. This was easily one of my favorite concert experiences, and I’m going to be on the lookout for more of her concerts. If you haven’t listened to her music yet, I highly recommend listening to both of her albums.

It should have come as no surprise that Forever 21 was planning on filing for bankruptcy. In fact, one wonders why it had not reached its death knell sooner.
Founded back in the 1980s, Forever 21 gained success off of its fast fashion model, providing trendy clothes at low costs. Over the years, this model has fizzled, as Forever 21 has not been able to adapt to increased competition from other fast fashion outlets like Zara and H&M, that offer better quality garments at slightly higher prices than Forever 21. Additionally, with online companies like Fashion Nova on the rise, Forever 21 is no longer the fastest, cheapest, or trendiest. 
This significant shift away from Forever 21 can be attributed to the changing ways in which people shop. In 2016, Forever 21 continued opening new stores and expanding existing ones, an ill-advised move given reports that about 60 percent of millennials make their purchases online and prefer online shopping. Other competitors adapted to what some call “the retail apocalypse,” but Forever 21 has been slow to downsize their presence in malls.
In 2016, the U.S. Labor Department investigated Forever 21 for unethical business practices occurring here in the United States. The Los Angeles Times reported that garment factories in Southern California paid workers a little less than $4 an hour, and $7 an hour on average. This was $3 less than the minimum wage in California. Forever 21 was one of the many retailers embroiled in this wage theft scandal, and was responsible for some of the worst offenses. 
Fast fashion itself is beyond problematic, because it relies on unethical business practices. Fast fashion retailers contract out to garment factories, distancing themselves from what occurs on factory floors. Because most fast fashion retailers do not directly employ the workers making their clothing, they are able to shield themselves from legal responsibilities for poor practices. The retailers set the price and order the manufacturers to make a garment for a specific, very low cost, to the detriment of the underpaid workers. Fast fashion encourages this type of behavior, and when retailers get caught, they do not have to face the consequences.
Fast fashion is sustained by the sweatshops where the clothes are produced. In fact, without sweatshops, fast fashion would likely not survive because it relies on manufacturers underpaying their employees. Most retailers work with factories in developing nations because it is easier to take advantage of the workers due to a lack of labor laws. Some factories even rely on the work of small children. Many factories encourage unsafe practices that retailers choose to ignore because, in their world, profits are more important than upholding human rights.
The 2013 Rana Plaza collapse in Bangladesh was a tragic incident that helped bring attention to the dark secrets of the fast fashion industry.  More than a thousand people died and thousands more were injured after an 8-story building known as Rana Plaza collapsed, in the deadliest garment factory disaster in history.Forbes reported that Zara, one of Forever 21’s competitors, was one of the many clothing chains that were housed in Rana Plaza. Despite this tragedy, it seems that fast fashion retailers have not made any major steps towards improvement and consumers continue to shop at such retailers.
The potential of Forever 21 filing for bankruptcy should be celebrated as a victory, as it could be an indicator that the fast fashion model is not sustainable. However, despite Forever 21’s collapse, many other retailers pursue the fast fashion model and work with unethical manufacturers. Ultimately, it will take a shift in consumer behavior to ensure the end of this business model.
New retailers have taken note of these human rights violations and have built their businesses off of ethical or clean standards. These retailers tend to be pricier, but some consumers are more willing to splurge when they know that a retailer is cruelty-free. Everlane, a retailer founded in 2010, has built its marketing strategy off of its ethical values for manufacturing. Thus far, Everlane has been successful. It is not a fast fashion retailer, but its success may be a signal that a new dawn is coming to the retail business. One can only hope that ethical business practices will become the new norm for retail and that consumers will come to value clothes that were ethically made.
Forever 21, Zara, and H&M may be affordable but can cause the violation of human rights. The fall of the fast fashion industry is not something that should be mourned. In fact, it signals progress. But, bankruptcy is not necessarily the end for these fast fashion companies. Forever 21 could bounce back, but doing so will require adapting to new consumer practices and improving the quality of styles they release. Additionally, they should strive to commit to ethical practices and as consumers, we should demand nothing less.

Her hands surround the bowl of pouring rain,
Her lips and words of pure disdain,
Throws the drops of pennies with a clang on the tv screen:
Full of colour, but not really.
His beard is clanged onto his face,
Hides his tattoos and ties the lace,
Grabs hold of the rope and lets it go:
Sees colour, but not really.
He walks down the streets,
Only to sit down on his feet,
Remove the cup, replace it with a new one:
Feels the colour change, but not really.
She grabs the pen,
Holding out all her dreams under these fingers ready to paint her amazing canvases then,
Now she holds the same pen to drown all her dreams:
They tell her to see the colours, but not really.
There is colour within us all,
Hear the cheer,
Plaster your ear to the wall,
And you will see,
All of us see colours,
But not really.

It may come as a surprise that, even in this day and age, books are still being challenged and banned across the United States.
Kathleen Newman, associate professor of English at Carnegie Mellon, spoke at the University of Pittsburgh on the topic of banned books and how this practice still persists today, despite the alleged freedom of information. I had the opportunity to interview her after her talk, and she explained not only the history of banned books but the persistence of the issue.
Professor Newman told me the story of a banned books case in 1975 that went all the way to the Supreme Court. Members of a school board attended a conservative group conference and were handed a pamphlet with 33 objectionable books. Nine of these books were found in the local libraries, and the board members took the books out of the library, deeming them inappropriate for the students to read. In retaliation and in defense of their freedom to access information, a group of high school students sued the school district. The Supreme Court ruled in the students’ favor, stating students should not have to sacrifice their First Amendment rights when they walk through school doors. This decision, along with the American Library Association’s Library Bill of Rights, formed a foundation for librarians to protect books, in a struggle that continues to this day. 
Despite the Supreme Court’s decision, Professor Newman stated that many groups continue to challenge people’s access to books. Most notably, these books are “either about diverse people or by authors with materials that challenge the mainstream society.” She estimates that there are more than 10,000 challenges to different books and other media each year. The process for banning books goes as such: after a book is challenged, a committee is assembled to review the book and make a decision. While most books that are challenged are not taken out, a few extreme cases have passed. One notable example is the removal of the Harry Potter series from a Tennessee Catholic school in Sept. 2019. The school priest decided the spells in the books were real and could allow readers to conjure evil spirits, citing exorcists from the United States and Rome.
Newman said the history of banned books cannot be discussed without mentioning Judith Krug, the forerunner in challenging book banning and the founder of Banned Books Week. At the 1982 American Bookseller Association Book Expo, Krug presented a display of banned books in large, padlocked metal cage. Krug’s exhibition sparked the initiative known as Banned Books Week, with the joint efforts of Krug, the American Bookseller Association, and the National Association of College Stores bringing awareness to banned books. The 1980s saw a huge spike in challenges to books after the election of Ronald Reagan, with conservative groups mobilizing in the 60s and 70s to circulate banned books lists.
I asked her about what she believes to be the most important takeaway from Banned Books Week. Professor Newman expressed her desire for everyone to understand that the culture of banning books continues to exist. “Most people would say, ‘books aren’t banned anymore.’ On one hand, we’re better off in this country than maybe some others… But if you live in a small town and someone challenges a book, you might not have access to that information.”
Banning books remains a powerful attempt to take an idea out of circulation, and it would be a “mistake to think it is a problem of the past.” Thus, Banned Books Week is a way to remember its prominence and to prevent the problem from getting worse. While Carnegie Mellon provides students with the freedom to access all books, it is crucial for students to remember that not everyone has the same privileges as us.

Tim Bergling, known professionally as Avicii, died last year on April 20. The 28-year-old’s sudden death in Muscat, Oman came as a shock to many. The cause of death was not immediately released, but many fans had at least an inkling of an idea. Avicii: True Stories, a documentary released in 2017, showcased his struggles with anxiety and depression behind the scenes. His lifestyle, mixed with his alcohol dependence and mental illnesses, created a dangerous concoction that would lead to the artist’s 2016 retirement from his DJ career.
Within a week of Bergling’s death, an open letter from Bergling’s parents, Klas Bergling and Anki Lidén, stated that Bergling “really struggled with thoughts about Meaning, Life, Happiness. He could not go on any longer. He wanted to find peace.” Without using the word “suicide,” the letter answered fans’ suspicions. In April 2019, father Klas Bergling told The New York Times that he doesn’t believe his son’s death was planned. Bergling’s death was like “an accident to the motor road” with “several cars.” Bergling’s seemingly improving mental state and the lack of a letter led the father to believe “nothing points in the direction that he was planning it.”
One year has passed since Bergling left this world, but he continues to shape the EDM community. In his final weeks, Bergling was working on his third studio album, Tim, released summer 2019. Through Tim, he gives insight into his world of anxiety, existential fear, and finding joy through the midst of it all. “SOS,” a track in collaboration with Aloe Blacc (remember “Wake Me Up” and “Hey Brother”?) was the first to be released from the album, dropping 10 days before the one-year anniversary of Bergling’s death.
Almost a year after the death of the EDM musician, Bergling’s parents established the Tim Bergling Foundation. It “advocate[s] for the recognition of suicide as a global health emergency and promote[s] removing the stigma attached to the discussion of mental health issues” and “support[s] science-based organizations that engage in research into the causes and prevention of suicide, particularly for young people.” The foundation also aspires to be involved in different issues that Bergling felt passionate about such as “climate change, preservation of endangered species, [and] global hunger.” Thus far, the foundation is in its early stages and does not accept donations, but until then, Klas Bergling asks fans to spread the same love and compassion that his son did.
The Friends Arena in Stockholm will host a tribute concert for Avicii on Dec. 5. Live performers — some of whom had worked with Bergling in the past such as Aloe Blacc and Joe Janiak — and well-known DJs are playing to pay tribute to an EDM pioneer and raise mental health awareness. Tickets went on sale Sept. 5, and already, the show is sold out.
It’s hard to say goodbye to an artist I’ve followed since 2012. Like most other fans, I started off with “Levels,” but I observed Bergling develop his sound. He experimented with various genres (who knew EDM could fuse with country prior to “Wake Me Up”?) and became more vulnerable with his audience. In his lifetime, he was passionate about causes such as AIDS care, world hunger, and the LGBTQ+ community. Through his music videos, he included themes of inclusivity and positivity. I’m sad that Tim is the last that the world will hear from Bergling, but just as he said when he retired from touring, he finished off his music career “with a bang.” Now, his legacy leaves behind a message of compassion, living life to the fullest, and continuing the dialogue of mental health.

“Do you think I should wear a dress today at the lab?” My housemate had been repeating that question ever since she started working at one of the Robotics labs on campus this summer. Her main concern had been, “I feel like I’m the dumbest person in the lab every time I wear a dress.” I didn't need further explanation before encouraging her to wear whatever she wanted, and she — who probably made her decision before expressing her frustrations — would go to her lab in a cute summer dress.
Recent graduate Chie Wach said that one of the main reasons that she didn’t interact much with the majority-male peers in MCS throughout her education was that she “felt academically inadequate compared to some of them, which was directly proportional to my appearance. So the nicer I looked, the dumber I felt, and the less likely I was to interact with them.” For Wach, dressing neatly is a form of lifestyle organization, similar to keeping her room well-decorated and clean.
I also like to dress nicely. For me, it’s a self-care practice, a refusal to compromise that 10-minute “me” time in the morning to the demands of being a Carnegie Mellon student. It is also the first decision that I make for the day — so as a decision science student, I strive to make a good one that can minimize my regret. In my first year, when my subconscious was still independent of the Carnegie Mellon norm, people would always guess that I was an art student judging by the way I dressed. I didn’t realize the repercussions of this image of mine until recently, when I decided to switch my additional major from creative writing to statistics and machine learning. 
Before accidentally stumbling upon machine learning in my internship this past summer, I never thought that I would be competent enough to understand the algorithms behind the various machine learning models. Yet, given a chance, I was not only able to comprehend them, but I also developed a strong interest in a field that my peers repeatedly discouraged me from — “It’s a lot of math. You don’t look like you would be interested. It’s not for you,” and, “I struggled hard in that class. Why would you even try to put yourself through it?” Almost all the people with whom I held daily conversations, observational exchanges or conceptual debates suddenly presumed a lower degree of intelligence for me when it came to a STEM-related area (I hate to point out that they were mostly male). I was convinced for two years, until I started taking math classes for machine learning and realized in anger how wrong their assumptions were.
But still, I doubted myself. Can I merely blame my cute summer dresses or my female identity for this situation? Maybe this false image was a necessary sacrifice in exchange for nonconformity and individuality. A Medium article by my friend and Tartan staffwriter Atahan Kiliccote, titled "On Fashion," answered my doubts. 
Kiliccote documented people’s reaction after he changed his appearance by shaving his head: “People look at me differently, they don’t like to look me in the eye. They smile less… people also act with more respect, maybe more fear. They get out of my way. People apologize to me more.” He agreed that “fashion and changed appearances have a predictable but ultimately uncontrollable effect on one’s perception.” Yet he took a completely different stand, claiming that “fashionable clothing is wasteful and the time of plenty is ending.” His disobedience from the norm was a direct contrast from me and my girls. While we strive to bring more aesthetic expressions onto our outer shell, Kiliccote demonstrated his ascetic beliefs by shaving his head. Both were acts of nonconformity, yet while our choices impaired our ability to achieve higher, his choices earned instant respect. 
During my conversation with Wach, we arrived at a theory that tied back to the traditional gender roles of men being smart and women being pretty. Smart and pretty, these two separate adjectives that otherwise would never have opposing nature, are now juxtaposed as projections of the traditional rigid gender dichotomy. Pursuing femininity is colored through stereotypes as the opposite of intellect, therefore discouraged at Carnegie Mellon, an environment that heavily values the latter. This is nothing new. In 1999, a study on stereotype susceptibility discovered that when Asian American women were asked to fill out their gender identity as the first question of a math test, they performed worse on the test, but when asked to fill out their ethnic identity, they performed better, compared with a control group where neither identities were asked. 20 years later, we are still subconsciously falling into the fallacious negative association between appearance and intellect.
Now, I’m wearing a denim dress writing this, thinking, what’s the call to action? I guess I’m not the best activist to write out a slogan for change. I feel small and helpless in front of this systematic error. Getting wrong beliefs out of our subconsciousness might be the most I could do. Although I still hope that it could be a sparkle bright enough to start a fire.

This is an ongoing series featuring short interviews from CMU students, some of whom choose anonymity, on their experiences at Carnegie Mellon.
“I really overcommitted with multiple clubs. Where I was reps for a couple of clubs, I was head for another club. I also joined a lot of clubs as sort of like a compensation for this imposter syndrome where people generally feel out-of-place at [Carnegie Mellon]. Imposter syndrome is real and you have to actively battle so you won’t slip into it, and the second semester was the semester when people started panicking, and that’s when I started panicking too but that’s all grades and stuff. If you take a step back, take a breath, and do what you’re supposed to do, it’s really not an impossible task. We just have to manage the stress and the panic. We’ve done a lot of things in high school. That’s why we’re IN Carnegie Mellon. Hoping that we can pull the same thing off in college is a different story. I committed to a lot of clubs and that took a lot of time from my hands. Just knowing that it’s okay to drop out of these clubs is something that I think [first-years] should know. We’re all busy with time and we need to understand when we should prioritize academics. Grades are not going to come out pretty. Just keep working. You’ll be fine. And don’t panic.”

In the last several months, international students at Carnegie Mellon University have been targeted by telephone scams attempting to extract personal and financial information. They have been called “sophisticated” scams by University Police Chief Thomas Ogden for their methods and attention to detail.
While the specifics of each scam vary case by case, they have several commonalities. In all cases reported to University Police, the victims were Chinese international students.
“Asian students [are] being contacted by what appears to be the Chinese government,” said Chief of Police Thomas Odgen in an interview with The Tartan. Scammers “typically say that they’re from the Chinese Embassy in New York, that they’re sending American police to arrest [them],” Odgen says.
In some cases, the calls appear to come from the Chinese Embassy, while in another, the caller claimed to be from a Chinese law enforcement agency. Victims are told that to prevent arrest or deportation, they must transfer a specific amount of money into an international bank account.
“They are very professional criminals, and keep students on the line for hours,” said Lieutenant Joseph Meyers.
In each case, University Police have contacted Homeland Security or the local FBI bureau. University Police used official communications in Jan. to report the first case of this nature to students. They informed students that “this is not an isolated incident. We’ve learned that calls pretending to come from the Chinese Embassy or U.S. government agencies are occurring nationwide.”
The most recent case was reported on reported on Sept. 11, after a student received a call from a person claiming to be from the Chinese consulate who demanded money. Because the victim was instructed to transfer funds into the international bank account via wire transfer, University Police hopes Homeland Security and Chinese law officials can do something to track the funds.
University Police cannot confirm whether the cases all come from the same source, but they believe that they all originate in China. They say students and the elderly are the most vulnerable to these scams.
There are several reasons why international students might be targeted. As students away from their home country and family, they need to have access to funds for emergencies, and scam criminals are aware of this. Also, because the U.S. is not their home country, they may not be completely familiar with particular laws or methods of law enforcement.
Due to the high volume of international students at Carnegie Mellon, University Police hopes to get the message out to as many students on campus as possible. Organizations such as the Office of International Education (OIE) and the Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) have sent out multiple informative notifications since the scams began occurring.
“We have been made aware that graduate students were targeted by these scams,” said GSA President Dacen Waters. “There was an increased volume of these scams around the beginning of the academic year. The timing makes me think that it is something targeted, trying to take advantage of students who have just arrived.”
Students are not the only individuals vulnerable to these attacks. Mei-Yu Wang, a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Physics, has received calls claiming to be from the Chinese Embassy.
“I’ve [received] tons of calls every few days from the China Embassy,” said Wang. The calls were “to pick up a package. I just hung up immediately because I’m not from China, I’m from Taiwan,” Wang mentions. Since she identified the call as a scam right away, she did not report the incident.
While these sophisticated scams have become more common, students may also be subject to other types of scams. Wang received a phone call telling her she owed money to her credit card company. She began to worry and stayed on the phone, but when the caller could not identify which credit card with enough specificity, she grew suspicious and hung up. She spoke with her husband about their credit card company and determined that it had been a scam.
“For the general issue of phishing scams, the best defense is awareness. This is why, in my opinion, incoming students were targeted so strongly,” said Waters. “The GSA is actively working together with [Graduate Education Office, OIE] and other offices to improve the flow of information and resources to incoming graduate students, particularly international students.”
“We want to get the word out that governments will not call you. The only people that would call you are bill collectors,” said Chief Ogden, explaining that government agencies communicate through physical formal documents with a formal letterhead. “We’re not typical police, we’re your police. If [students] aren’t comfortable with police, go to student affairs.”

On Wednesday, Senator Amy Klobuchar, a candidate running for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 Presidential election, spoke at Stack’d Oakland, a popular hamburger restaurant and bar right near the University of Pittsburgh campus.
Over 500 people attended Klobuchar’s event on Wednesday, according to Klobuchar’s campaign. The venue reached maximum capacity and a large crowd spilled onto Oakland Avenue.
Some attendees were big fans of Klobuchar, while others were there to see what she’s all about. 2020 will be the first election that Delany Hernich, a freshman at the University of Pittsburgh, votes in. Henrich said that she wants “to be as informed as [she] can about different candidates.”
Klobuchar arrived in a black SUV, waving to the crowd, and then walked over to shake a few hands. “I have to greet the people!” she said.
Senator Klobuchar is running as a moderate. While she is aligned with most Democratic candidates on issues of immigration, abortion and LGBTQ+ rights, she is trying to cast herself as more realistic than other candidates, which is appealing to her supporters.
“I just like that she’s so bipartisan, like she’s going for the moderate vote,” said Serena Fisher, a senior at Fox Chapel Academy. Fisher was at Wednesday’s event with her friend, Suparna Agrawal, who also likes Klobuchar, despite the fact that she won’t be able to vote. “I know a ton of people are running progressive... but also they’re not necessarily going to get things done in government,” said Agrawal.
Klobuchar plans to address the problem of student debt by allowing students to refinance their loans and making Pell grants more available. She opposes free 4-year college for all, an idea also being pushed by candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. “If I was a magic genie and could give that to everyone and afford it, I would,” Klobuchar said in a televised CNN town hall in February.
She wants to expand Medicare to include Americans aged 55 and older and favors universal healthcare coverage. Klobuchar has expressed opposition to eliminating private health insurance under Medicare for All. In a Democratic debate, she touted, “I don’t think that’s a bold idea, I think that’s a bad idea.”
“She’s a moderate progressive and I think that’s what we need now,” said Beth McCracken, a Pittsburgh resident, on Wednesday. McCracken has wanted Klobuchar to run for office since she was elected to the Senate in 2006. “I think she’s a brilliant woman. I think she would really represent the majority of the country.”
Klobuchar’s stop in Pittsburgh was part of her “Blue Wave” campaign tour, in which she campaigned in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, three states which voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 election.
Senator Klobuchar says that they are states that Democrats should have won, as they voted for Democrats in the four elections that preceded 2016. Trump won in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin by a small margin, but they played decisive roles in his victory.
Galen Druke, a host of FiveThirtyEight’s political podcast,  described Pennsylvania as “the state that could very well decide the 2020 Presidential election.” In a July episode of the podcast, Druke said, “If the race is close, Pennsylvania will be key.”
Klobuchar believes that they will play a key role in 2020. “We’re building this blue wall, and we’re gonna make Donald Trump pay for it,” said Klobuchar in her speech.

Last Wednesday, in celebration of this past Tuesday’s Constitution Day, University of Pittsburgh Professor of Law William M. Carter, Jr. gave a lecture in the Tepper Quadrangle’s Citrone Conference Center. Carter’s lecture discussed the U.S. Constitution and its historical implications on slavery and the Civil War.
Carnegie Mellon has presented these lectures since 2005, covering topics like gerrymandering and immigration executive orders. Event organizer Andy Prisbylla told The Tartan that Professor Carter was highly recommended as a speaker by several members of Carnegie Mellon faculty. Prisbylla added that all colleges receiving federal funding are required to incorporate Constitution Day activities into their programming.
Carter set the tone for his lecture, saying, “When I learned constitutional law as a child, I got a very rosy picture of our constitutional regime and democracy, and I learned that progress is upwards. I became more cynical after becoming a law professor and rejected the idea that the Constitution is a shining beam of hope. Though I am of the view that the Constitution is neither infallible or irredeemable.”
To put American slavery into perspective, Carter reminded his audience, “The legal status of slavery existed in this country significantly longer than the status of freedom. Slavery has been abolished for just over 150 years, but it has existed for over 250.” He also pointed out that the final slave shipment to the Americas was in 1860, which was surprisingly recent to his audience. “There is a distinct difference in American slavery; unlike other slave systems, it became a perpetual, inheritable, race-based status,” Carter added.
He went on to discuss the nuanced relationship between constitutional provisions and slavery. Though things like the Three-Fifths Clause and the Slave Trade Clause are obvious examples, Carter spent more time discussing how elements of the Electoral College and the 5th Amendment’s Due Process Clause have, in unexpected ways, influenced slavery.
Carter introduced the perspective that without the Electoral College, slave states would have been at a disadvantage due to their large populations of non-voting slaves. the Due Process Clause, as Carter pointed out, had been a means by which slaveowners could protect their property; scholars have interpreted that property protection applied to slaves themselves.
Though Carter said he wasn’t in full agreement with all of the theories on the U.S. Constitution and its relationship with slavery, Carter was sure to state that “the Constitution contains a variety of provisions, that, at minimum, were at compromise with the institution of slavery.”
Carter spent much of the lecture discussing the post-13th Amendment timeline. He explained that the Civil Rights Act of 1866 came just one year after the 13th Amendment, in response to the Southern states’ attempts to re-establish slavery, as well as how there had to be multiple Civil Rights Acts in response to the Ku Klux Klan and Supreme Court defiance. The timeline he presented ended in 1877, the de facto end to the Reconstruction Era, which followed the withdrawal of federal troops from the South.
“I don’t know which Supreme Court Justice said it, but I like the quote: ‘A constitution can make us no better than we are.’ Courts tend to move not far beyond the consensus in American society and using the law to enact social change hardly works. It’s not a very heartening conclusion for Constitution Day, but I’d rather have it straight, no chaser,” Carter concluded.
Prisbylla told The Tartan, “Professor Carter’s scholarship on the Civil War Amendments felt incredibly relevant to us in our current social and political situation where our country seems more divided than ever before. What’s past is prologue, and it benefits us all to be aware of the atrocities perpetrated to those in history, as well as the legal and constitutional statutes that allowed these cruel acts to transpire.“
“As the university takes more steps to address diversity and inclusion on campus, such as the recent formation of the Student Center for Diversity and Inclusion and the Campus Climate Task Force, it’s important for us at the Libraries to ensure our programming reflects the diversity of our community,” Prisbylla added. 
“We were thrilled to host Professor Carter’s talk and hope to present more socially and culturally engaging programming in the future,” he said.

The Ethics for Technologists lecture series is back for another year, bringing speakers to discuss the intersections between technology and its impact on the world. Maggie Oates, a Ph.D. student in Societal Computing at Carnegie Mellon and one of the head organizers of the lecture series, told The Tartan that her agenda for the lecture series is to “better equip students in identifying and thinking about moral issues in their life as it relates to tech.”
Oates’ own motivation to begin the lecture series, which she organizes along with Human and Computer Interaction Ph.D. student Kristin Williams and Societal Computing Ph.D. Tom Magelinski, came when she took a class on “AI and Social Good.” Oates mentioned, “On the first day of class we spent a good 40 minutes doing the classic ‘What is artificial intelligence really?’ [but] in the last few minutes of class, the professor said, jokingly, ‘well now is the part where we should define social good’… And that was really the last time that we directly addressed that concept in the class.”
She feels that “CMU students in general, but computer science students in particular, don’t have a lot of exposure to ideas outside of their technical curriculum,” and she hopes to change that with this lecture series.
The first installment in the series was titled “TL;DR Ethics: One Hour, One Chalkboard, and a Comprehensive Structure of Ethical Theories for Computer Scientists” and was presented by Professor Alex John London, the Clara L. West Professor of Ethics and Philosophy, and the Director of the Center for Ethics and Policy at Carnegie Mellon.
The lecture took place on Sept. 9 in Gates 4405, and around 50 people, mostly graduate students in the School of Computer Science (SCS) were in attendance. The lecture was essentially an hour-long distillation of a 5-week class, and dealt with a wide range of ethical frameworks, from egoism’s maximization of personal good to consequentialism’s maximization of universal good.
London used a flowchart to divide various ethical ideas, with questions like “Is the good a foundation concept?”, “Is the good one thing?” and “How do we choose?” lined up on a whiteboard. According to London, these questions form the basis of every ethical theory, and how one answers them decides the baselines of, say, whether a self-driving car crashes into a group of pedestrians, or swerves and potentially hurts its occupants.
The second lecture was presented by Os Keyes, a Ph.D. student at the University of Washington studying Human-Centered Design and Engineering, titled “Technology and Tactics: A manifesto for sociotechnical liberation,” was centered on the questions of “How does technology shape the way we live our lives?” and “How can we use/destroy tech to improve our lives?”
Keyes delivered a wide-ranged talk, from discussing Carnegie Mellon professors being “complicit in war and bloody murder,” for their work on on image-recognition algorithms used in drone strikes, to military-funded facial recognition technology, and some of the methods of pushing back against potentially destructive technologies. They juxtaposed the failures of OpenOversight, a crowd-sourced database that aimed to provide police oversight in Chicago, and the successes of Tech4Society, a group focused on creating “sustainable and sustained infrastructures” in society.
Keyes drew a sharp contrast between the efforts of these two projects. Where OpenOversight thought the “solution to a bad algorithm was a good one, and the solution to a societal problem is a technical one,” Tech4Society instead directed their work around the question, “What expertise do people actually need?” and were more effective as a result. Keyes laid out three main guidelines to working as technologists: work should be a part of and accountable to existing struggles, work should operate with the consent of the most vulnerable, and that compromises should make a more radical future possible.
A third talk in the lecture series is yet to be scheduled, but Oates hopes to stage a “point-counterpoint style discussion between someone from the Army AI Task Force and someone at Carnegie Mellon who disagrees with it,” but so far has found it “hard to put together.”
She gives a few reasons for the difficulty: mainly that faculty at Carnegie Mellon can be “pretty guarded about their opinions that might cause conflict,” and that “people on the Task Force don’t have much to gain from going public.” Despite these difficulties, there are plans for more talks in the series. Future details can be found on the lecture series website.

Emily Doe from Stanford University shed her alias and revealed her name: Chanel Miller. Her case took on national attention after the perpetrator, Brock Turner, received a sentence of only three months. In response, her memoir, Know My Name, will be released this week. Her testimony in 2015 foreshadowed the #MeToo movement, one that encouraged thousands to share their experiences and started important discussions about sexual assault.
More recently, a piece in The New York Times by Deborah Ramirez added weight to the allegations made against her former classmate, Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh, that he "drunkenly exposed his penis to an unwilling Yale classmate, who ended up touching it while trying to avoid him." 
These revelations about years-old campus sexual assault cases both came out in the last month, showing the ongoing relevance and lasting effects of instances of campus sexual assault. In The New York Times piece, Ramirez talks about the ways in which the sexual misconduct felt for her like a confirmation that her classmates did not respect her. The assault, said Ramirez, served to "make it clear [she was] not smart."
In the case of Ramirez, these conversations are happening almost a quarter of a century after the initial assault. At Carnegie Mellon, we have the opportunity to normalize conversations about sexual assault and help support survivors who may be feeling those same feelings of exclusion now. 
We must not be complacent with our current discussion on sexual assault here at Carnegie Mellon. Cutesy videos likening consent to tea and mandating that students take brief online courses on consent are all fine and dandy, but those efforts alone are not enough. Students can walk away from viewing three-minute clips or short interactive classes with faulty notions of consent fully intact. Sexual assault is not a topic that’s fun to discuss or as exciting as other parts of first-year orientation, but it’s still important that students understand consent. Unlike a random lecture for the boring yet mandated gen-ed that you’re trudging through, understanding consent is valuable knowledge that is critical to carry throughout your life.
Sexual assault also doesn't stop being an issue after the first year of college. Though teaching new Carnegie Mellon students about healthy relationships and consent is vital, students of all ages continue to face these issues. The Carnegie Mellon student convicted this May of sexually assaulting a Pitt student was a junior at the time of the assault.
Last year's mandated sexual assault reports put the 2015-2017 number of reported rapes occurring at Carnegie Mellon ahead of other Pittsburgh universities, including much larger universities. In a statement given to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, university spokesman Jason Maderer attributed these numbers to more students reporting sexual assaults. Either way, the solution is to increase efforts to make this campus a safe place for people to talk about their experiences if they so choose, and to try and combat a culture permissive of sexual assault.  
The process for reporting sexual assault and harassment isn’t widely discussed on campus, making the knowledge or process possibly inaccessible to students. If a student isn’t even aware that they are a victim of sexual harassment, let alone the process for reporting the incident, how can we truthfully say that we have taken strides to combat sexual assault on campus? Additionally, students may find the process of reporting traumatic, lengthy, or unhelpful. Victims may find that they are put in uncomfortable or unsafe situations with their abuser, only to find that administration can do nothing other than suggesting the victim find ways to avoid their abuser.
As students who make up a college community and people in a larger society, we have a responsibility to hold ourselves accountable. We must educate ourselves on what enthusiastic consent looks like. We must be cognizant of resources for sexual assault victims so that we can help ourselves and others. We must learn to recognize signs of abuse and assault and act accordingly in these situations. Although we cannot stop the problem of sexual assault as lone individuals, we can take steps to help prevent it and create safe spaces for survivors within our own communities.

Despite their differences, nearly every Democrat in America can agree on their disdain for President Donald Trump. However, as recent polls show, the person who they believe should succeed Trump is less clear. According to the most recent ABC News poll, former Vice President Joe Biden holds a moderate lead over Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who are polling nearly equally. These three candidates highlight an ideological divide amongst Democrats, with just under five months until polls open in the Iowa caucus.
Biden is considered by many the most electable candidate of the three. He is a moderate Democrat who, throughout his career, has prided himself on his ability to work across the aisle. Sanders finds himself on quite the opposite end of the spectrum. A career politician, like Biden, Sanders has dedicated his life to the advancement of socialism in American government. As a result, Sanders has been a polarizing figure throughout his career. Despite this, following unforeseen success in the 2016 Democratic primary, he has found a much more comfortable place in mainstream politics.
The core decision primary voters will have to make as they head to the polls in 2020 is what is more important to them: the ability to beat Trump in the general election or nominating the candidate who best represents their beliefs. The movement of the Democratic party in the direction of greater progressivism has moved at a rapid rate, so much so that some argue that Biden no longer represents what the democratic party stands for. These skeptics contend that he is a 76-year-old man who, as recently as late June, spoke with pride on his ability to work with segregationist senators in his time in the Senate. It would seem few people believe Biden to be racist, but his obliviousness to how his comments would be perceived lends support to the argument that he is old, out-of-touch, and not the best choice for a party clamoring for a generational passing of the torch.
In contrast, Senator Sanders has spent his political career fighting for ideas that are core values of the increasingly popular progressive liberal movement. It takes just a few clicks on his campaign's website to find policies like "Medicare for All", the cancellation of student debt, or The Green New Deal. These are topics that enthrall the younger, more progressive section of the Democratic base. As much positive response as these issues get from progressive Democrats, there seems to be an equally hesitant response from older, "establishment" Democrats. These are Americans who have moved through adulthood with the moderate Democratic party of the 70s, 80s, and 90s. To them, many of the 2020 candidates are running on ideas that are remarkably liberal.
As the 2020 primaries inch closer, the looming choice for Democrats becomes increasingly apparent. As a party, they must decide how determined they are to prevent Trump from winning reelection and what concessions they are willing to make in choosing their nominee. A balance of progressive ideas and electability will be crucial for the eventual challenger. It is up to Democrats to determine which candidate can find the increasingly rare middle ground.

In a daring move, described as “India’s Kashmir checkmate,” the president of India, Ram Nath Kovind, issued a new constitutional order abrogating Article 370 and Article 35A of the Indian constitution on Aug. 5, 2019. In doing so, he overrode the 1954 constitutional order that solidified their status in the constitution.
Essentially, Article 370 granted semi-autonomy to the disputed region of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) in most legislative affairs barring defense, foreign affairs, finance, and communication; Article 35A restricted private property rights, preventing Indian citizens who aren’t permanent residents of J&K from buying or owning land. Before the abrogation of the articles, thousands of Indian soldiers were deployed to the region, tourists were ordered to leave, and a communication blackout ensued, as J&K was put on lockdown, which has continued for the last month.
The government’s decision comes at a key flashpoint in India-Pakistan relations. Earlier in February, Jaish-e-Mohammad, a Pakistani-based militant group that has been carrying out terrorist attacks in Kashmir since 2000, killed 44 soldiers in a car bomb attack, the deadliest attack on Indian forces since 1989. This prompted India to carry out their first airstrike since the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, the first time either country carried out aerial attacks that crossed the Line of Control (LOC), the formerly agreed upon de-facto border and ceasefire line in Kashmir that has been in existence since 1972. The bombing and subsequent strong military reactions all occurred just a few months before the Indian election, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi was up for re-election. Since the revocation of Article 370, Pakistan has downgraded diplomatic relations, calling back their top diplomatic official to India, and suspending trade with India.
In 1947, when the British decided to partition India and Pakistan, they asked the princely states, states still ruled by regional leaders in an alliance with the British Empire, to join either India or Pakistan. Maharaja Hari Singh was the Hindu king of the princely state of J&K at that point, which was and still is a Muslim majority area. The reasoning behind the partition was that the All India Muslim League wanted a separate Muslim state. Pakistan thought Singh would cede the Muslim majority J&K to India, leading them to attack him. Ironically, this ended up causing Singh to cede J&K to India, which ended up being the catalyst for the first Indo-Pakistani War in 1947, the first of four wars between the two countries. The Indian government then created Article 370 in 1949, which was then ratified with the rest of the Indian constitution in 1950. By 1952, the Kashmiri monarchy was abolished, and by 1954, a constitutional order was issued that further reinforced Article 370 and supplemented it by passing Article 35A, which created the general framework about Indian policy on J&K. That is, until the new constitutional order issued earlier in August. The articles were always intended to be temporary provisions, and Hindu nationalists have fought for the revocation since the 1950s. These nationalists are now represented by Modi’s party. 
Article 370 and Article 35A have had major consequences for the region. Because it is semi-autonomous, the region has failed to enjoy the same level of economic development as the rest of India because the restricted private property rights prevented non-J&K Indians from opening new businesses there, and the central government couldn't do much to develop the region. As a result, J&K became isolated from India and the rest of the world. This has made corruption and nepotism endemic to the region’s economic system, which has only accelerated the destitution of the citizens of J&K. This is on top of the region being constantly plagued with insurgency and sectarian violence, which further hinders any economic process. Frankly, some strong action needed to be taken in the region to alleviate its issues. 
It’s also important to acknowledge that the articles are an Indian issue, and not an international issue like Pakistan claims. The LOC was there as an agreed-upon line of ceasefire over a region that had two players trying to exert dominance over it, and that line was only relevant when the region had semi-autonomy. But at the core, the decision to give J&K semi-autonomy was a unilateral decision by India, and the decision to remove J&K’s semi-autonomy is also unilateral on India’s part. Pakistan has mostly no leg to stand on. They have famously not only backed insurgents in J&K, but also backed the Taliban and the mujahideen, and the founder of their nuclear program sold the designs to Iran and North Korea. India shouldn’t keep having to appease Pakistan with J&K. 
However, while appeasement should not be Indian strategy, backing Pakistan into a corner should also not be a strategy. Since the decision to revoke Article 370, Pakistan has threatened nuclear action, and India is several steps closer to another war with Pakistan. Based on history, the probability of war is significant, and Pakistan’s response is incredibly unpredictable. 
Pakistan is taking matters to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). While it would seem that taking matters to the UNSC would be a win for India, the main issue is China. China has a stake in a region called Ladakh, a Buddhist majority region of Kashmir located close to Tibet. The Chinese government has also made claims to the region, which Pakistan has recognized since 1963, but India hasn’t recognized it. China has already criticized India for its decision and joined Pakistan in agreement about the violation of international sovereignty. In addition, China has also increased diplomatic relations with Pakistan over the last several years economically and militarily, and India has been a rival to China since the 1962 Sino-Indian War. There is always the threat of China vetoing UNSC resolutions, or worse, China backing Pakistan if a military conflict breaks out. 
More importantly, J&K will become extremely unstable in the short term without a proper plan in place. While Modi’s government, which is run by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the dominant Hindu nationalist party of India, has had the abrogation of 370 on their agenda for a long time, the recent decision is a very clear opportunistic political move. The Indian economy has been showing signs of stagnation, but the recent inflammation of tensions was perfect for Modi’s campaign and turned the primary focus of his campaign and his second term in office towards J&K. 
So far there is no clear plan for what to do with the region afterward. Aside from a bill reorganizing J&K into an official union territory and also splitting Ladakh into another territory, there is no real plan for redeveloping the region or dealing with rising insurgent sympathies. The Indian government’s lockdown is only set to exacerbate issues further, as there have been reports of mass arrests and allegations of torture by the Indian military. The uncertainty of how unstable the region will become and how long the instability will last will create severe problems for any plans to redevelop the region, and there is a major chance the destitution of J&K will only increase. 
Looking at the constitution, the wording of the articles, and precedents, there was a lot the Indian government could have done that was less aggressive and antagonizing. Jawaharlal Nehru talked about the “gradual erosion” of Article 370, and there were legal ways to follow that through constitutional orders and amendments. Instead of removing semi-autonomy entirely, the Indian government could have only removed Article 35A, which would have ended the private property restriction and allow non-J&K Indians to start investing in the region. Before abrogating Article 370, Parliament changed the notification clause, which required that the central government had to inform a J&K Constituent Assembly about any legislative decision. The problem is that the Constituent Assembly dissolved in 1956, so Parliament just changed the clause so that they could proceed to abrogate the article. Instead of doing that, Parliament could have instead amended the article to slowly expand how much of the Indian constitution applies to J&K while maintaining the semi-autonomy of the region. Promoting regional economic development while allowing J&K to maintain its identity would have been an effective way to build back stability in the region and gradually begin to integrate the territory into India. There is already precedent for this, as the Indian government had used economic development as a means to quell instability in regions with Maoist rebel sympathizers. It would be counterfactual to determine which options would be better, but the point is that the Indian government had less aggressive and stronger diplomatic options available. 
In the end, the only thing the world can hope is that any cynical or negative speculation about the abrogation of Article 370 will turn out to be wrong. There is a lot of uncertainty about what actions India, Pakistan, China, and the rest of the world will take regarding this issue. The decision has been made by the Indian government, and only time and hindsight will tell if the decision was the right one.

No matter how you look at it, life can be framed in terms of investments, whether in material possessions, intangible benefits, or other people. Our lives revolve around the idea of investing, even if it doesn’t seem like it: we invest our time into problem sets and studying for exams to get good grades, we invest our energy in indulging our passions and cultivating our interests, and we invest our attention in other people in hopes of receiving recognition and camaraderie. And, as with all investments, we expect returns, even if we don’t explicitly say it.
The same idea applies when investing money, but there seems to be a disconnect when we jump from lofty ideas of social exchange to dollar signs and decimal places. Questions like “how and where do we invest money?” and “how much should I invest?” and “when should I start investing?” are daunting and difficult to answer, which ultimately deters a lot of people.
There are a lot of places to invest your money, from real estate and foreign currency to start-ups and hedge funds. Last time, we looked specifically at high-yield savings accounts and timed savings accounts, which can also be considered an investment. While it’s worthwhile to consider these different options, moving forward, we’re mainly going to focus on what it means to invest in the stock market and how to go about doing it. But before we start delving into the world of stocks and bonds and funds, it’s important to lay out some guiding principles.
First, under no circumstances should you ever invest more than you can afford to lose. Every investment carries a risk, and this is especially true when you’re dealing with a volatile stock market that swings up and down from day to day, dictated by the whims of neurotic investors who watch the charts second by second. So, while the stock market has great potential for rewards and returns, you can also incur heavy losses. For that reason, you should only consider investing money that, if you were to lose, would not be the end of the world.
Second, realize that to accumulate wealth, time in the market is more important than timing the market. Historically the stock market has always seen rebounds, even from catastrophes like the Great Depression and the 2008 housing crash. While in the short term, the stock market fluctuates up and down, in the long term, market projections tend to be positive. It may be tempting to remove your money when things get rough but understand that no one knows when the market will really rebound, though some can make pretty educated guesses. If you make it a habit of withdrawing your funds whenever things get dicey, then you increase your risk of missing out on upswings and the profits that come with them. Investing your money and leaving your portfolio alone will help reduce the temptation to micromanage, and you’ll see better returns over the long term.
Third, you should always know exactly what your money is going towards. Don’t invest in a stock because some online market guru tells you to. At the end of the day, it is your money that you are managing, so invest in things that you either have expertise in or have done your homework about. While online articles about the “hottest stock picks for 2019” can be a good springboard for your own research, it’s important for you to examine the fundamentals of any investment before putting money down. We’ll discuss how to examine investments later in the series.
Fourth, you want to invest consistently, through good times and bad. This is because of the idea of the dollar cost averaging, where if you continuously invest in the market, you help reduce volatility since your dollar investments when the market is down averages out with your investments when the market is up. Admittedly, continuous investing is not going to make you rich overnight, but the goal here is not to become rich overnight.
Fifth, be realistic about your risk appetite. Are you willing to go for high-risk high-reward investments? Or do you want something that’s steadier and promises continuous growth? Use your personal values to inform your decisions on what you want to invest in, as forcing yourself to take on excessive risk can just lead to stress and irrational management of your money.
Lastly, invest early. The younger you are, the more aggressively you should invest due to the principle of compounding. The stock market, on average, has an annual return of nine percent, and if you consider that nine percent continuously being reinvested year after year, then it’s easy to see that your money will grow quickly. The more years you have to invest in the stock market, the better you can harness this powerful effect to your benefit. So, don’t wait until the “right time” to invest, because there is no right time. Rather, pick investments that you believe in and stick with them through thick and thin.
Everyone has a different investment philosophy that works best for them, so use these as touchstones to find yours. And, just in case I wasn’t clear enough before, let me repeat myself: under no circumstances should you ever invest more than you can afford to lose. This is the most important thing to keep in mind, and ignorance in this respect has led more than a few people to ruin.
Next time, we’ll begin to examine the different investments on the stock market and how they compare to each other.

At the start of each semester, in addition to the usual volunteering, multicultural, or academic clubs at The Fair, there are also philanthropic groups with the aim of sending students around the world on alternative spring break trips. Instead of students going home or vacationing with friends for a week, these groups ensure that they spend time in contributing to the greater good. There are multiple options at Carnegie Mellon, including Carnegie Mellon in Puerto Rico, Carnegie Mellon in Haiti, Habitat for Humanity, Global Public Health Brigades, Global Medical Brigades, Outreach360, and more. 
In recent years, however, there has been a growing debate about the true value of alternative spring breaks. Who is it helping? Why do people go? Are these trips really helping communities in the grand scheme of things? Out of this debate came the term voluntourism, which means exactly what it says: turning a trip abroad into a chance to volunteer and give back. Voluntourism is a booming travel option, and can involve building schools, helping orphanages, or even teaching English in nations or cities deemed less fortunate. In some cases, organizations with these aims are explicitly branded as useful résumé boosters, which calls the intentions of undergraduate students interested in alternative spring breaks into the conversation. 
The first name that comes to mind when discussing volunteer intentions is the Global Medical Brigades (GMB). Unlike the Public Health Brigades, this group specifically goes to developing nations — for Carnegie Mellon's chapter, some of these countries include Nicaragua, Honduras, and Panama — to “help communities in all fronts such that these communities will one day be able to sustain a higher quality of life without external assistance.” According to Carnegie Mellon GMB’s website, members run a free medical clinic, work alongside professionals to provide medical care, and even build hygiene stations and lay concrete floors during their week stay. While these accomplishments are admirable and thoughtful, how is the big-picture goal–a higher quality of life without assistance–achieved? 
As long as you get your photo with cute kids, make them smile, help families, and get another experience to write under the "volunteer" heading of your résumé, everything is fine, right? Not exactly. For example, Lauren Kasack, a former brigade member, wrote in an op-ed for the Pacific Standard that after three trips to Ghana, local people were not purchasing health insurance since they could expect the foreign health care and medications to be available every few months. And, while communities often request for GMBs (meaning no volunteer steps foot in a nation or city where they are not welcome), there is a dependency relationship that festers as a consequence. The involvement of the Global Medical Brigades in numerous African and Latin American countries, unfortunately, tends to maintain the status quo rather than fix problems, because the systemic and historical aspects of these problems are often not acknowledged. With the format of the brigades as annual, week-long events that are often not consistently in one nation, I cannot help but wonder if these organizations are simply sticking a band-aid on a deeply historically rooted issue–especially when concerning Central American countries.
U.S. involvement in Central America has been credited time and time again for creating and fueling the hostile situations in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, the latter of which Carnegie Mellon's GMB could not travel to last year due to the high rates of violence and crime. For example, at the peak of the Cold War, the U.S. illegally supported right-wing and military coups and funded harmful regimes, notably in Nicaragua. More recently, under the Obama Administration, Honduras’s reformist president was seized by an opposing military party in 2009, and we, simply put, did nothing. In the bigger historical picture, European colonialism and early 20th-century U.S. involvement in Central America created the dire situations that so many American college students to want to help. But what is the point, when students often do not recognize the turbulent history and cultural differences between the U.S. and Central America? Is giving out glasses and wearing scrubs once a year the solution? There is a stark difference between helping others in the short-term versus the long-term, and that is where many alternative spring break organizations fail.
On the other end of the spectrum in the discussion of intentions behind volunteering are organizations such as Outreach360. According to its website, Outreach360 volunteers partner with community leaders in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua to “host neighborhood camps where students can join for interactive and fun lessons relating to English, Spanish literacy, science, and math.” This a seemingly very innocent, ambitious goal, especially with its claim that one in five Latin American students drop out of school. Carnegie Mellon's chapter of OutReach360 is slightly similar, yet focuses on a trip to the Dominican Republic during spring break. While Spanish fluency is not needed to join OutReach360, they aim to “educate students and provide them with the skills to advance their chances for better opportunities in the future” by teaching them English during a week-long camp program. The academic year, therefore, is spent bonding with other volunteers and fundraising for the big trip in March.
However, behind the videos of laughter and tropical sunsets, is the looming background idea that English fluency is the way out of poverty. Again, because of irreversible history and modern globalization, we are stuck in this moment in time where English is perceived as key to social and economic capital. There are true benefits, such as when English is used as a tool in political protests, or when English mastery increases one’s chance to go to university in the United States. Despite this inevitability, I cannot help but criticize the wording choice of Outreach360 at Carnegie Mellon: how is a week-long trip influencing a child’s “opportunities in the future” when barriers actually keeping them from achieving more are so deeply rooted in U.S. and Latin American relations and history? 
More difficult to digest is Carnegie Mellon's Outreach360’s big pitch: “We don't bring in money and tangible supplies to help the communities -- we serve the kids as human beings with skills that we readily have and would love to share.”  What level of narcissism and blatant neocolonial mindsets is needed to read that and be fine with it? Teaching English is not going to remove brown children from gang violence, crime, and poverty. If anything, GMB provides physical support to struggling communities; here, the “commodity” is English, and that simply does not sit well with me.  
With that said, I would like to make it clear that I am not defacing the entire industry of teaching English to non-native speakers. Like myself, those who are certified in Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) urge those interested in teaching English abroad to understand the bigger picture. One teacher shared on their blog the importance of understanding the past interactions that the nation in which they will teach has had with the English language, especially in the context of China, where regional languages may risk dying out. Another begs us to challenge the perceived superiority of native speakers as teachers over non-native speakers who achieved fluency. She argues, in short, that a classroom would actually be a safer place when students are allowed to use their native language from time to time. This suggestion is a total 180 from Carnegie Mellon's chapter of OutReach360, which emphasizes that no Spanish language knowledge is required. Therefore, not only do student volunteers lack historical and cultural understanding, but also any general knowledge of the native language. 
Before I end, I would like to make a couple of disclaimers. First, I have great respect for anyone who is inherently interested in helping people and working towards a better world. I admire those who see how the U.S. government has neglected Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria, and are representing our university by going and thoughtfully interacting with another culture. I admire those who build homes for others in need, especially considering the focus on the Greater Pittsburgh community. I admire good people with good hearts. Second, I myself have never been on an alternative spring break trip, and have no plans of doing so. Third, the voluntourism industry is showing no signs of stopping; therefore, rather than proposing a total abolition of organizations full of students with the best intentions, it should be modified. Writing for Newsweek, Maya Websey suggests providing parents, professionals, and local leaders with the resources and knowledge to care for their people, rather than focusing on short-term fixes. Like the TEFL teachers mentioned before, I would also recommend training in history, culture, and native language before trying to teach English abroad; and, in the Carnegie Mellon context, I hope Outreach360 chooses to change the language used to recruit new members. 
I know this one article in this one student newspaper will not singlehandedly dismantle the neocolonial roots of the white (or, in the Carnegie Mellon perspective, rich) savior dynamix, teaching English for “better opportunities,” and helping the disadvantaged without much thought of the culture of the place being “helped.” I hope, however, that anyone who participates in these groups is aware of the power dynamics and history associated with alternative spring breaks, especially when traveling to developing nations. These trips are not your chance for a photo-op with brown and black kids; they are powerful, and mean something to everyone involved.

“Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?” At the Sept. Democratic presidential debate, Julián Castro made what was seen as a thinly veiled attack on Joe Biden’s age. During a verbal spat over healthcare proposals, the former Secretary for Housing and Urban Development claimed that Biden contradicted himself over the issue from earlier in the debate, questioning whether the former Vice President remembered the policy he articulated minutes ago.
While other candidates rebuked what they described as “demeaning” and “not cool” behavior from Castro, Biden’s mental ability should be a concern for Democrats whose main goal is to defeat Donald Trump in 2020.
A candidate’s mental ability is obviously vital to being a good nominee and president. The Presidency is a strenuous and demanding office to hold, and it should be held by someone who can handle its pressure. On the campaign trail, it is safe to say that a candidate who is coherent, with a good mental capacity, has a better chance of winning the general election. Democrats should want to nominate someone with the ability to perform both as the nominee and as president.
Joe Biden might not be that person. So far this election cycle, Biden has thanked his “longfriend timefriend", has mistakenly referred to two other candidates as “the President”, seemingly forgot Barack Obama’s name, and told people to “make sure to have the record player on at night” as he struggled to explain how children should hear more words during early development. He’s mistakenly stated that he met with Parkland shooting victims while still in office, and misstated that his public option healthcare proposal would “make sure it’s not quality; we’ll only make sure it’s affordable”. There's also an ever-growing compilation of moments Biden has had trouble articulating himself.
The primaries should filter out candidates who don’t have the cognitive ability to serve as the presidential nominee. Democrats want to nominate the best potential candidate to defeat Trump, so the candidates and campaigns need to be willing to speak out on all of Biden’s concerning moments and confront him about it. This nomination process should be treating candidates critically as a means of vetting potentially problematic candidates to deter them from winning. If Democrats want to make sure they’re choosing the strongest candidates, they should confront Biden on his possible mental decline; if he can address it, that would make him a stronger candidate and if he can’t, then he might not be the type of nominee they’re looking for.
Even so, many Democrats have treated scrutiny of candidates like they are self-inflicted wounds, and that any criticism of the eventual nominee only gives Republicans more ways to attack during the general election. This thinking is counterproductive for issues like a candidate’s mental abilities, especially when there are 18 other potential nominees running. 
Republican talking points are not dependent on how the Democrats talk about whoever becomes their nominee. The Republican National Committee and the Trump Campaign don’t rely on Democrats to come up with arguments to use against the Democratic candidate during the general election, so Democrats would benefit by scrutinizing their candidates beforehand to weed out the ones who wouldn’t have been able to hold up in the inevitable onslaught from July to November.
There is some general wisdom and research backing the idea that divisive primaries are bad for the eventual nominees, but it would be wrong to universalize it, especially in a situation regarding Biden’s mental decline. Looking back at past Democratic presidential primaries, there’s good evidence that primary challenges are more manifestations of existing party divisions than the cause of those very divisions. Because these intraparty divisions are based on preexisting ideological and belief-based divisions, the concerns about weakening the overall party with questions around Biden’s mental stamina should not apply here. Biden’s mental capacity isn’t a position of ideological debate within a political party. His mental capacity is a matter of his ability to perform in office and on the campaign. If Joe Biden does have a declining mind, it will be present and in view throughout the general election, regardless of whether this was brought up during the primary. 
If this is not addressed among friends during the primary, there is no doubt that Biden would have to show during the general why his memory and ability to speak should not be up for debate. At that point, however, it might be too late. 
Democrats can’t assume Biden is just “the electable candidate”. We aren’t very good at predicting how “electable” someone is, and the general election polls done this far from the election are terrible indicators of who would actually win. Instead of guessing what other people want, support the candidate you think will be the best president.
