The men’s and women’s swimming and diving teams hosted their second home dual meet of the season.
This week, they faced a non-conference rival, Grove City College, which competes in the Presidents’ Athletic Conference.
Both Tartan teams were victorious, with the men winning 191–97 and the women winning 178–119.
The men’s swimming and diving team added another victory to its so far undefeated season, winning this one by a large margin. The Tartan powerhouse was led by sophomores Anton Razanav and Cole Um, as well as junior Edward Sears, as they each placed first in two events of their respective specialty stroke.
The Tartans also saw strong, first-place freestyle finishes from first-years Steven Geier in the 1,000-yard freestyle, Martin Smith in the 500-yard freestyle, and Christopher Wysocki in the 100-yard freestyle.
Razanav won the 100-yard and 200-yard backstrokes with times of 53.78 and 1:57.44, respectively. Um was the first to finish in the 100-yard breaststroke, with a time of 1:00.32, and in the 200-yard breaststroke with a time of 2:11.57. Sears finished the 50-yard and 100-yard freestyle with season bests of 21.79 and 48.07, respectively.
After a loss against Clarion University, the women’s swimming and diving bounced back by defeating Grove City.
“Now that we’re getting into the swing of our dual meet season, we keep getting better and better and I think that wide range of talents and specialties on our team is one of our greatest strengths,” first-year Corrine Bacigal said.
Standout junior Soliel Phan won three events in this weekend’s meet. Phan placed first in the 200-yard freestyle with a time of 1:55.59, and the 100-yard freestyle with a time of 54.05. Phan proved her all-around strength by placing first in the 200-yard relay medley with a time of 2:12.40.
Men’s and women’s swimming and diving teams will jump back into competition hosting their annual quad meet.
The diving team will compete Friday at 6 p.m., while the swim team will compete Saturday at 11:30 a.m.
The Tartans will face Washington & Lee University, Allegheny College, and the University of Rochester at the annual quad meet.

As the National Hockey League (NHL) lockout approaches its second month, the casualties mount: 326 games and the Winter Classic have been cancelled. But the negative effects on both the league and the sport are more than just lost games and paychecks. The tide of public opinion is quickly turning from disdain to apathy, and with it go the hopes of the NHL coming out of this debacle unscathed.
Talks between the players’ union and the owners recently passed a milestone when they met for three consecutive days for the second time. But the fact that it was a notable achievement for the two parties to simply negotiate is a testament to the futility of these talks. The owners have been attempting to stiff-arm the players into accepting their terms while completely dismissing their attempts at compromise.
The owners’ main complaint is the distribution of revenue between players and owners. Under the old agreement, players received 57 percent of the revenues. This was dictated by the salary cap and the minimum total player salaries each team was required to have. The owners now want a larger share of the revenues, pushing for a 50–50 split.
While the players have accepted this as inevitable and have conceded to the split, there is still the problem of how current contracts, signed under the previous revenue-sharing agreement, will be handled in the future. The players want to hold the owners to their agreements and have the revenue-sharing slowly scale down from 57 percent with new contracts being signed under the new 50–50 policy.
The owners want a system that starts at 50 percent sharing immediately and fulfills the players’ extra payment by having several years of under 50 percent on the backend. The players have obviously balked at this offer because it essentially translates to the players paying back players, as opposed to the owners being consistent with prior years’ contracts.
Aside from this major sticking point, the owners are trying to reign back many of the concessions they made during the last collective bargaining agreement (CBA) during the 2004–05 lockout that erased an entire season. During that last CBA, there was no firm contract limit, allowing some teams to sign players to ridiculously long contracts, like the matching 13-year deals signed by players Zach Parise and Ryan Suter with the Minnesota Wild. The point of these contracts is to spread the money of the deals over more years than the player will actually be valuable to the team, thus decreasing the cap hit for each individual season.
The Wild’s owner, Craig Leipold, did not do the owners any favors by commenting in the Star Tribune after he signed the top two free agents for $98 million each: “We’re not making money, and that’s one reason we need to fix our system. We need to fix how much we’re spending right now.”
Many Eastern European and Russian-born players have moved over to play in the Kontinental Hockey League, which is based mainly in Russia, while many of the American and Canadian born players have begun playing for Western European and minor American-based leagues.
With the say of public opinion firmly against them and the players finding plenty of opportunities to work, the owners’ hardline strategy is failing. Thankfully, the owners are starting to realize this, and are now negotiating with the players, but the parties still are not close to a solution.

Carnegie Mellon’s Club Baseball team took on St. Francis University in a double-header this weekend, with both games resulting in victories for the Tartans.
The final score of the first game was 6–3 due to strong defense and outstanding pitching. First-year pitcher Darren Kerfoot pitched a gem on the mound with eight strikeouts, contributing to his great first season.
Senior shortstop Wade Brogdon scored twice, while sophomore outfielder Brian Saravia sparked the offense in the fifth inning when he brought in two runs off a double. Junior outfielder Alex Golemb scored his first two hits and made an impressive catch on the run in the right field before leaving the game due to a hamstring injury.
The second game that the Tartans played against St. Francis also ended in a Carnegie Mellon victory, 3–0. Junior pitcher Brendan MacNabb pitched an almost perfect game — he allowed just one hit. MacNabb also helped save a run: A St. Francis batter hit a line drive with a man on third base in the second inning, and MacNabb snagged it out of the air.
Kerfoot also singled and scored the only necessary run for the Tartans in the second inning, while two runs were scored in the bottom of the sixth on hits by sophomore catcher Darryl Tan and senior third baseman Adam Gruber.
“This was the best series of the season. A total team effort against a quality opponent with exceptional pitching from Darren and Brendan,” Brogdon said. “It was a great note to end on and will be an outstanding segue into the spring.”
With this weekend being the conclusion of his Tartan baseball career, Brogdon went out with stellar play. He hit the ball hard all day and completed many athletic putouts at shortstop, including converting three  6–4–3 double plays with senior second baseman Joe Barbish.
“When I was a freshman, Wade always went out of his way to make sure I was doing okay. He is one of the best teammates I’ve ever played with: a great player and an even better person,” MacNabb said.
At the end of the season, Barbish led the team in batting average, and Gruber was the team leader in runs batted in and home runs. Brogdon led the team in runs, and Tan led in steals with seven.
Kerfoot and MacNabb finished the season leading all pitching categories. Kerfoot was best in wins and strikeouts, while MacNabb led the team in earned run average and wins plus hits divided by innings pitched.
Brogdon’s career numbers of .462 BA, .524 on-base percentage, and .687 slugging percentage are among the best at Carnegie Mellon.
“This weekend’s win was bittersweet, a great game and quality win, but it meant my career has ended here at CMU,” Brogdon said. “CMU’s baseball program is a phenomenal organization and I can’t thank coach Claudio [Reilsono] and coach Rege [Kiliany] along with my teammates over the past four years enough for an amazing experience.”

Senior soccer player Alex Abedian has been one of the most flexible and focused contributors to the Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team.
The team currently sits at a 13–4 record at the top of the University Athletic Association (UAA) conference. The players’ stellar performance this season earned them a bid in the NCAA Division III National Tournament.
For Abedian, these results exceed any expectations he had. “I honestly had no idea what to expect coming into the season. After a bit of a rough year last year, I kept my hopes modest,” Abedian said. “But from the start of preseason, I could tell that there was a change of heart, and I knew it was going to be a great year.”
This change of heart proved to be worthwhile, as the team recently had five of its players honored by the University Athletic Association  conference.
Head coach Arron Lujan and assistant coach Mike Piranian were named University Athletic Association Coaching Staff of the Year for leading the team to a No. 6 national ranking, a first-place finish in the UAA, and a return trip to the NCAA tournament.
“I think our biggest accomplishment was receiving the NCAA bid,” Abedian said. “It just showed that everything we worked for finally paid off.”
On Saturday, the Tartans faced off against Morrisville State College and won 3–0 in a shutout.
Abedian was a key player in the game: When Chernor Barrie of Morrisville looked as though he was about to score a goal, Abedian ran him down and deflected the ball before Barrie could take a shot off the goal box.
Originally, Abedian thought he would be playing forward, but he was switched to defender this year.
“Alex is truly the quintessential soccer player,” said teammate and senior midfielder Moni Sallan. “He was always willing to step up and try something new. His ability to play any position truly proves his physicality and flexibility.”
Abedian has grown from playing in five games his first year to playing in all of them. This season, he scored eight points as one of the team’s leading defenders.
“I hadn’t been a consistent starter during my time here,” he said.
“I think that being able to start and really contribute to the team has been my biggest accomplishment this season.”
His teammates agree. “Alex really contributed to the team this year. Not only with his numerous corner kicks, but with his focused attitude and driven athleticism,” Sallan said.
Abedian is no outsider to the world of soccer, having played since he was four years old. “Soccer is such dynamic game,” he said. “I just the love the competitiveness of it.”
Even though the team is internally competitive, Abedian said he loves the camaraderie of Carnegie Mellon’s team.
“I have loved playing for CMU because we are able to have a great Division-III program while going to an academically excellent school,” Abedian said.
When not on the soccer field, he is pursuing a mechanical engineering degree. He hopes to continue on to graduate school, but remains flexible. “I’ll just see where I go,” he said.
Before the second round match against Ohio Northern, Abedian sets his goals high.
“I want to do everything I can to help us go as far as possible in the NCAA tournament,” he said. “I want us to be champions.”

The Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team made history on Saturday when it won its first NCAA tournament game at home. The Tartans scored a huge victory against Cabrini College in a 5–0 shutout and will advance to the second round.
Senior Brianna Magill had a standout game, scoring twice to contribute to the win. The first came in the seventh minute, when she made a shot toward the center of the goal box, which gave the Tartans a 1–0 lead. In the 17th minute, Magill scored again, marking her seventh goal of this season.
Sophomore forward Sav-ina Reid, junior forward Cecilia Zischkau, and junior forward Alex Venegas each had goals that propelled the Tartans to victory.
Reid’s goal was marked by a stellar header in the 15th minute, assisted by junior defender Rachel Contopoulos. This was Reid’s ninth goal of the season.
After a 3–0 start during the game’s first half, the Tartans extended their strong performance into the second half. They made nine shots at the goal during the first seven minutes, including a close one by senior defender Mitra Ebrahimi.
Venegas gave Carnegie Mellon a 4–0 lead with a shot in the 59th minute, and Zischkau added a goal during the final minute. These were the players’ fourth and third goals of the season, respectively.
“This game confirmed that we deserve to be in the NCAA tournament. We played with heart and determination,” Magill said.
Junior goalkeepers Anna Albi and Julie Rekant combined performances to lead the team to its ninth shutout out of 18 games in the 2012 season.
For the team, the game “truly showcased all the hard work we put into this season. Not only did we work hard offensively, scoring five goals, but likewise had a great defensive mentality, not allowing any shots on goal,” Ebrahimi said. “This game gives us tremendous momentum heading into the rest of the tournament in continue to make Tartan history.”
“It was a great day to be a Tartan,” said sophomore goalkeeper Julia Harmison.

The men’s soccer team began post-season play in the first round of the NCAA Tournament on Friday against Morrisville State College. The Tartans defeated the Morrisville Mustangs with a final score of 3–0.
The first half of the game was fortuitous for the Tartans with 10 attempted shots; however, they weren’t able to connect with the goal until the second half. Shots were taken by senior defender Ben Bryant, junior midfielder Matt Sarett, senior midfielder John Crawshaw, junior forward Scott Gerfen, junior midfielder Mike Ferraco, and junior forward Max Tassano. 
The Mustangs were only able to attempt two shots — both of which were saved by Carnegie Mellon junior keeper Christopher Madden.
The second half proved to be the moment of opportunity for the Tartans to put some goals on the scoreboard. Within the first minute and 57 seconds of the second half, Gerfen assisted junior midfielder Chris Wysocki for the first goal of the night into an open net. 
Just less than three minutes later, Crawshaw scored his fourth goal of the season off an assist from Ferraco from the left sideline.
Within the next 21 minutes of play, Morrisville State was able to get off one unsuccessful shot before first-year midfielder Connor Webb took a square shot to assist sophomore defender Brandon Peck in his first goal of the season, and the final one of the game. Morrisville State only took a total of three shots in the second half of the game due to the Tartans’ strong defense.
In the second round of the NCAA Tournament on Sunday, the Tartans were defeated by the Ohio Northern Polar Bears, 3–1. 
Carnegie Mellon started the first half off strong with three attempted shots by Crawshaw, Tassano, and Bryant before Wysocki scored the Tartans’ first and only goal of the night off an assist from Sarett. Just seven minutes later, the Polar Bears answered with their first goal of the night and the final goal of the half.
In the remainder of the first half, Carnegie Mellon continued to take one more shot, while Ohio Northern took five.
Within the first 11 minutes of the second half, the Polar Bears scored their second goal. No more than two minutes later, they headed in another goal off a corner kick. 
Madden had two of his four overall saves in the second half, which kept Ohio Northern from scoring again. The Tartans continued to take four more shots, but were unsuccessful in every attempt.
“Although we lost today in the second round of the NCAA tournament, I’m extremely proud as a captain of this team,” Bryant said. “We had a very successful season, and unfortunately things just didn’t go our way tonight.”
The Tartans finished their season with a record of 13–4–1, while Ohio Northern continues on in the NCAA Tournament to play Susquehanna University.
“As a team, we are returning all but two players next year, so there are only greater things to come of this team. The focus is now on fall of 2013,” Bryant said.

In the final regular season game of the season last Saturday, the Tartans football team fell to Case Western Reserve University in the Academic Bowl, 36–24. Despite the disappointment, junior wide receiver Tim Kikta set the Carnegie Mellon single-season record for receiving yards with 63 in the game. Kikta needed 32 yards to break the record.
With the loss, the Tartans end the season 6–4, with a 1–2 record in conference play. The Case Western Reserve Spartans are also 6–4, finishing 2–1 in conference play.
After leading 24–16 at the end of the first half, the Spartans’ defense shut down the Tartans’ offense, preventing a second-half score from Carnegie Mellon.
But the first half featured some excellent Tartan offense. Senior cornerback Sam Thompson returned a punt 53 yards for a touchdown in the second quarter, his second punt return for a touchdown on the season.
Kikta led the receiving game with 63 receiving yards and a touchdown. Junior quarterback Rob Kalkstein completed 16 of 32 passes for 173 yards with a touchdown and an interception.
The Spartans stifled the Tartans’ running game, holding them to just 47 yards on the ground. Senior fullback Jared Delello scored a touchdown running the ball and finished the game with five rushes for 14 yards.
The Spartans were able to win this game with an effective running game. They found the end zone four times on the ground and ran for a total of 242 yards as a team.
“It’s never a good feeling to lose the final game of the season,” said senior running back Patrick Blanks. “However, everyone played with great passion and effort.”
With the end of the season finally here, the Tartans say goodbye to some seniors who have been key contributors to the football team over their college careers.
Blanks and fellow senior running back Jake Nardone, Thompson, senior outside linebackers Nick Karabin and Owen Parker, senior safety Anthony Lorubbio, and Delello are just a few of the seniors who said goodbye to college football last Saturday.
“I have such a close bond with all of the other seniors on the team,” Blanks said. “It’s going to be tough going forward without football, but we will always have the great memories.”

According to the Kenya Medical Research Institute, malaria is the leading cause of death in Kenya, as well as in many other East African countries. Luckily, a new technique that uses cell phone data to track the movement of a population has made a breakthrough in medical research, and the new method will be able to assist in the fight against this deadly disease.
Amy Wesolowski, a Carnegie Mellon Ph.D. student in engineering and public policy, is a co-author of the paper “Quantifying the Impact of Human Mobility on Malaria,” which was published in the journal Science. The study followed the movement of 15 million Kenyans over a year.
Understanding human mobility and the mosquito-transmitted disease’s hot spots is critical to disease intervention. When a disease-carrying mosquito takes blood, its saliva often leaves behind the malaria parasite. But just as a mosquito can give the disease to humans, it is equally important to understand the implications of an infected human transmitting the disease to a healthy mosquito.
It’s a deadly cycle, and because humans travel much farther than the one-kilometer radius to which a mosquito usually keeps, humanity’s role in carrying and spreading the disease is more far-reaching than the insect’s.
But while mosquito populations and a region’s malaria density might be well-known factors in the disease transmission equation, the human factor is not. Out of the copious past studies on malaria, very few have gathered information on the topic.
Caroline Buckee, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard University and the paper’s senior author, told CNN, “This is the first time that such a massive amount of cell phone data — from millions of individuals over the course of a year — has been used, together with detailed infectious disease data, to measure human mobility and understand how a disease is spreading.”
This big data allowed the research team to create a high-resolution vector map of human motion throughout the East African country. A vector includes both quantity and direction, and can visually describe the journey between malaria “source” settlements (malaria-infested regions) and “sink” settlements (regions where the disease is less prevalent).
These vectors reveal that, as expected, the highest percentage of human travel is to and from the capital, Nairobi. But this travel network did not overlap that of the parasites, indicating that the city-to-countryside travel has a minimal role in spreading the disease. Instead, the overlap of human movement and parasite movement vectors occurred mostly within the high-risk regions themselves.
The team found that the highest-risk areas are around Lake Victoria and coastal regions; the rural and humid environment supports more mosquitoes than do the mega-city’s streets.
This isn’t to say that large cities are safe from disease; the problem of disease prevention is complicated. “Governments and other organizations have often concentrated malaria control efforts in low-infection regions [like cities],” Wesolowski explained in a university press release. “Those initiatives cost less and provide sense of accomplishment, but ultimately may not be successful because, in those areas, there are many travelers from high-infection areas.” 
The research revealed that the root of spreading malaria is not where there is the most human-to-human interaction, but where there is the largest mosquito-to-human interaction. Focusing control practices in these regions and providing cautionary advice and education to those who travel between them the most could reduce the disease spread by the mobile human population.
According to the researchers, doing so would decrease malaria prevalence in a more permanent and meaningful way than current methods can accomplish.
Beyond malaria prevention efforts, this new method of research can be applied to any situation where human mobility is a factor. But while this type of cell phone tracking research answers many questions about the spread of disease, it also raises many questions about the future of privacy.
In a comment to ABC News, William Schaffner, professor and chairman of the department of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University, said, “I suspect that some people will get antsy about Big Brother following you. I’m more excited about the possibilities to prevent serious disease.”

String theory is an idea in particle physics that endeavors to reconcile quantum mechanics and general relativity. It uses the concept that elementary particles, such as quarks and electrons, are not dimensionless points, but rather one-dimensional oscillating “strings.” String theory could be a physicist’s dream — a unified theory of everything — but it requires extra dimensions. So, how many dimensions are there?
Rob Bryanton’s book and video, both called Imagining the Tenth Dimension, explore a way of looking at space and time to include extra dimensions.
To illustrate this point, imagine a dot on a piece of paper. This is the zeroth dimension.
The first dimension is a line connecting any two points. It has no width or depth — only length. We create the second dimension when we draw a second line that branches off from or crosses the first. The second dimension has both length and width.
Imagine a world that only has two dimensions. Now imagine two-dimensional creatures like those on a playing card; we will call them Flatlanders, a term originally coined by author Edwin Abbott. When Flatlanders look at three-dimensional objects, they perceive them as two-dimensional cross sections of these objects. A ball, for example, would look like a circle.
The third dimension is the one in which we live. A three-dimensional object has length, width, and height. The third dimension is what we fold through to get from one point to another in the second dimension.
To illustrate the concept of folding, Bryanton describes a Flatlander that is walking on the edge of a piece of paper. If the piece of paper is rolled into a cylinder, the edge that the Flatlander was on touches the opposite edge of the paper, teleporting the Flatlander to the other side of paper if it were to be unfolded again.
The fourth dimension is time. In other words, the line drawn from the event of your birth to the event of you reading this article would be a line in the fourth dimension. If you were to imagine your body in the fourth dimension, you would see multiple versions of yourself, starting from you as a baby to you as an adolescent to you as you currently exist. However, just like how the Flatlanders perceive three-dimensional objects as their two dimensional cross sections, we only see one version of ourselves because we live in the third dimension.
The fifth dimension includes not only the line from your birth to your present self, but also the infinite lines branching from your birth to all possible versions of your present self. Remember how the two-dimensional piece of paper was folded so the Flatlander could travel from one point to another? If you fold the fourth dimension through the fifth, you can travel back in time.
There are two ways to get to a different point in the fifth dimension, or an alternate version of yourself: One way is to travel back in time and trigger the events and decisions that lead to that reality; the other way is to fold the fifth dimension through the sixth dimension (using Bryanton’s rolled paper analogy again) to travel from one point to another in the fifth dimension.
As we enter the seventh dimension, we must imagine a line that treats the entire sixth dimension as if it were a mere point. In other words, we take the beginning of our universe and extend from it branches that represent all possible timelines and all possible endings for the universe — in essence, the concept of infinity — and treat this all as one point.
If we changed the initial conditions of the universe and used this different universe as the starting point, and if we extended from it different branches for all possible timelines that could have resulted from this universe and treat that as a single point, we now have a second infinity point that we can draw a line to. To draw a line in the seventh dimension, we then connect these two infinity points.
If we branch off this line and draw a line to yet another infinity, we are now in the eighth dimension. Once again, to travel from one point to another in the eight dimension, one must fold it through the ninth dimension.
Finally, the 10th dimension is a single point that represents all the possible branches of every possible timeline of all the potential universes. But what other point can we then connect this to? According to Bryanton, it appears that there is nothing left.
To recall string theory, superstrings vibrating in the 10th dimension are what create the subatomic particles that make up not only our universe, but all universes. This is why string theory is a candidate “theory of everything”: all possibilities are contained in the 10th dimension.

Engineered fabric may help prevent fashion fraud
A new type of thread with properties invisible to the naked eye may be used to end designer knockoffs. Christian Müller at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden, made a semitransparent thread that has certain optical properties, allowing only particular polarizations to pass through. When the threads are woven together, they create a fabric that looks purple to the naked eye, but reveals purple and pink patterns under polarized light.
Müller believes the thread could be used to create logos  to place on items to thwart knockoff attempts. He is also hoping to develop threads for electronically enhanced textiles that would allow clothes to change color via electric charge.

Compound in red wine could fight prostate cancer
Resveratrol, a compound found in grape skins and red wine, may make prostate cancer cells more susceptible to radiation treatment. When Michael Nicholl, an assistant professor of surgical oncology at the University of Missouri School of Medicine, introduced resveratrol to prostate cancer cells, it increased the activity of two proteins that work together to kill cancer cells. Following radiation treatment, up to 97 percent of the cancer cells had been killed, which is a much higher percentage than usual.
A glass of red wine won’t kill cancer, though — the dosage of resveratrol necessary to yield these results is so large, current attempts to ingest that much resveratrol would result in uncomfortable side effects. Nicholl said a more effective delivery method will need to be developed.

Farming reaches new heights with vertical farms
The sky is the limit with the opening of Singapore’s first commercial vertical farm. Entrepreneur Jack Ng has already sold half a ton of his Sky Greens bok choy and Chinese cabbage, which grow indoors inside 120 slender, 30-foot towers. The aluminum towers are in the shape of an A-frame, with trays of vegetables stacked inside them; a belt rotates the trays so that all the vegetables are able to receive equal amounts of sunlight, airflow, and irrigation.
Advocates of vertical farming say that it is an efficient, economical way to grow fresh produce in urban environments. Some agricultural scientists argue, however, that the limited amount of sunlight the plants receive will make them grow more slowly, offsetting any other advantages in efficiency that vertical farming might offer.

ADHD medicine affects the brain’s reward system
Scientists at the University of Copenhagen have been studying the way the brain processes risk versus reward. The research, based on a new mathematical model of the part of the brain that registers reward and punishment, indicates that ADHD drugs lessen the signals regarding expected punishment or consequence.
Drugs like Ritalin contain dopamine, a chemical found in the brain that scientists believe motivates us to repeat actions that have previously been associated with reward. The researchers were able to calculate the effects that different dosages of Ritalin would have on the brain’s reward system.

You could blink and miss the Three Rivers Film Festival. It blows through Pittsburgh just as a flash of creativity strikes the mind, illuminating the city with the glow of celluloid off a screen. Operating out of three independent theaters, Pittsburgh Filmmakers and Dollar Bank sponsor two weeks of nirvana for film fans of all stripes.
Casual viewers can expand their boundaries with new foreign releases, and veterans can find dated rarities, resurrected for the weekend. Children can be introduced to the magic of silent comedy with live musical accompaniment. As they say, there’s something for everyone.
But most of all, there’s a lot for college students. With a few bucks for discount tickets, students have access to film history. The newest releases — successes and failures alike — are set against their predecessors. So many moviegoers bemoan the recent Hollywood surge of sequels, knock-offs, and gimmicks; the Three Rivers Film Festival is the remedy, featuring gems from the shifting world of cinema.
The festival opened Nov. 2 with an enthusiastic burst by showing three of the year’s most celebrated releases: Silver Linings Playbook, Rust and Bone, and Beware of Mr. Baker. Playbook is the newest release from director David O. Russell (The Fighter) and features an Oscar-worthy performance from Jennifer Lawrence, famed for her role as Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games. Rust and Bone as a whole works as a stylish twist on human melodrama, and Marion Cotillard’s performance is sure to compete with Lawrence’s come awards season.
Two highlights of the first week came as a Tuesday double-bill: Neighboring Sounds, a quiet Brazilian epic, and Compliance, an unspeakably disastrous American indie. 
These two pictures couldn’t have been more different. Neighboring Sounds is a sprawling story, vaguely connecting the lives of a dozen inhabitants of a middle-class Brazilian city block. Compliance retells the famous, true tale of the sexual assault of a McDonalds employee when a prank caller claims to be a police officer. While Sounds explores the relationship between architectural space and psychological space, Compliance only chases cheap, based-on-a-true-story chills.
But both of these films directly address what a good film festival can do. Neighboring Sounds, the first film from director Kleber Mendonça Filho, features actors that are not recognizable to an American audience, even one with some film literacy. It may never even be released on DVD in the U.S.
There is a certain thrill to knowing that we may never see something again. Neighboring Sounds allows us to see into every corner of its character’s lives — even their dreams. We spend more than two hours wondering if a dog is dead, watching awkward condominium meetings, experiencing a mother’s crushing boredom — and then one of the 10 best films of the year is gone. This feeling — that the images will bounce off the screen and vanish forever — is one that escapes this generation. But something like the Three Rivers Film Festival is capable of addressing that urgency.
Compliance, on the other hand, represents all that can go wrong with indie filmmaking. It begins with a loud font announcing that the events of the movie really happened. Instead of using the true story as a way to explore nuance and character psychology, director Craig Zobel hides behind the banner of realism.
The film asks the viewer if they would stop sexual assault if they saw it, or if they would blindly follow authority all the way to committing a felony. It’s a great conundrum that is played beautifully by the cast, but it’s cheapened by a script with an incredibly embarrassing disdain for working-class intelligence. All of it hides behind that giant font, screaming “based on a true story.” None of this takes into account the disastrous structural decision to reveal the prank caller halfway through the film, destroying the movie’s solid point of view. 
Despite Compliance being a less-than-enjoyable movie, the Three Rivers Film Festival allows audiences to see uncommon releases on actual projected film. The world of cinema is changing. In most contemporary film festivals, less than half of the exhibitions are shown on celluloid. Hearing the chugging rhythm of the projector and seeing weird jumps and objects on the screen is a small price to pay for the crisp, thick technicolor of film stock. We’re lucky to still have a few venues in Pittsburgh that are willing to show works with film stock.
The last week of the festival is dense with exciting, rare opportunities. On Monday, Carl Theodor Dreyer’s horror masterpiece Vampyr will be screened at 8 p.m. at the Regent Square Theater (only a short 61A or B ride away). Vampyr is a touchstone of fringe, avant-garde filmmaking, seemingly immune to age. Not only is this a chance to see a great film rarely available for projection, but it will be accompanied live by English musician Steven Severin of Souxsie and the Banshees, playing a new score he composed specifically for the movie.
Wednesday marks one of the most exciting screenings in the entire festival. Leos Carax’s Holy Motors will have its Pittsburgh premiere at 7:30 p.m. at the Harris Theater in Downtown. Holy Motors has been almost unanimously hailed as a genius achievement,  charming festival audiences around the world.
The movie stars French favorite Denis Lavant, as well as Kylie Minogue and Eva Mendes. From the bits and pieces released online, it’s clear that Holy Motors is energized by the electricity of insanity. Halls full of accordion players, movies inside of movies, and charismatic schizophrenics line the edges of the film, obviously so steeped in vitriol and disdain that this hatred becomes charming.
The festival finishes next weekend with a few big events. The Competitive Shorts Program takes place at 7 p.m. Friday night in the Melwood Screening Room. Eleven short films representing a diverse range of filmmaking styles and regions will be presented in competition and awards will be distributed.
On Saturday, the brilliant Alloy Orchestra — famed for its specialty in accompanying silent films — will play for a series of Buster Keaton shorts in the afternoon. Keaton was a bombshell of the silent era, the ultimate stunt man. That evening, Alloy will accompany a screening of The Overcoat, a realization of the literary masterwork by 19th-century Russian writer Nikolai Gogol.
You can blink and miss the festival, or you can keep your eyes open and catch a wealth of international releases that would otherwise be impossible to see.

As the audience filled the seats of Heinz Hall last Thursday, the only thing onstage to greet the show-goers was an empty black chair, lit by a single spotlight, with a hat perched on the back. 
When the house lights dimmed, a company member strode out, placed the hat on her head, and announced, “Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. You are about to see a story of murder, greed, corruption, violence, exploitation, adultery, and treachery — all those things we hold near and dear to our hearts.”
The minimal setting and tongue-in-cheek welcome set the tone for Broadway Across America’s production of Chicago, a dark, satirical musical about show business and Chicago during the roaring ’20s.
In Chicago, housewife and wannabe vaudeville star Roxie Hart (Tracy Shayne) kills her lover when he says he’s leaving her. Roxie is arrested and taken to prison, where she meets Velma Kelly (Terra C. MacLeod), a small-time vaudeville performer who has become famous for the double murder she is accused of. The two women become bitter rivals as they fight for the attention of their attorney, smooth-talking Billy Flynn (Brian O’Brien), and the Chicago press.
Although most people are familiar with the 2002 film adaptation that stars Renée Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones, the musical is actually quite different from the movie. It’s structured like a vaudeville show, skipping from one musical number to the next with a company member dramatically announcing each song. There is very little action or dialogue between musical numbers — only enough to maintain the structure of the show and keep the plot moving.
The set of the show matched the minimal nature of the plot. The musicians’ bandstand took up the majority of the stage, and for most of the show, props were limited to black chairs and ladders running up either side of the stage. Similarly, most of the characters donned simple black dance outfits, and the choreography was constrained to simple, sultry movements.
What the production lacked in flashy production elements, however, it made up for in talent and sex appeal. The company members all flaunted their dance skills, with moves that set the tone for the adultery promised in the introduction. 
The dancing wasn’t the only element that highlighted the performers’ talent: The vocals of Matron “Mama” Morton (Kecia Lewis-Evans) in particular stole the show. Lewis-Evans only sang in two musical numbers — “When You’re Good to Mama” and “Class” — but her impressive range and vocal control left the audience yearning for more.
Ron Orcbach won over the audience’s heart as Amos Hart, Roxie’s bumbling but doting husband. His affectionate-but-clueless characterization endeared him to the viewer, earning Amos vocal affirmations of sympathy from the audience at several points throughout the show. 
In juxtaposition with Amos’ awkward sweetness was O’Brien, playing the charismatic attorney whose talents lay in manipulating the press and the jury. He created a powerful presence onstage, charming the audience even as he openly advocated lying to the courts in order to win his clients’ cases.
Surprisingly, the least impressive part of the show was the performances of the two lead actresses, MacLeod and Shayne. Neither of their performances was particularly arresting, and often the dance company members were more engaging than were the leads in musical numbers. Granted, Roxie and Velma portrayed aspiring vaudeville performers with merely mediocre abilities, so it makes sense that their vocals would lack the power of, say, Lewis-Evans’.
This problem is one that any musical about mediocre performers must tackle: Should you stay true to the character and make the performance subpar? Or, should you just focus on putting on a good show for the audience? 
Roxie and Velma’s big closing duet, “Hot Honey Rag,” indicated that this performance leaned toward the former: The sloppy dance moves seemed like an artistic choice meant to highlight the irony of the two murderesses making it big. However, while their lack of star quality added to the dark comedic edge of the show, it didn’t add to the audience’s enjoyment of the performance.
Despite this weakness, Chicago kept its promise to put on a vaudeville performance with “corruption, violence, exploitation, adultery,” and all that jazz — and did it with smoldering musical numbers and enough talent to keep the audience entertained.

What happens when an elementary school Spanish teacher and a hardcore guitarist decide to form a musical duo? In this case, Sleigh Bells was born.
On Saturday night, the duo performed at Carnegie Mellon with an accompanying guitarist, delivering a show complete with loud music, energy, and a spectacular lights show. While the concert was high quality and enjoyable to a wide audience, Sleigh Bells’ music is definitely catered to a specific taste.
The band’s genre is most often described as noise pop and is particularly difficult to describe to anyone who has never heard it before. It’s a good thing, then, that the duo came to Carnegie Mellon and performed with opener AraabMuzik, exposing those who had never heard of Sleigh Bells’ music to something completely new.
If one word could be used to describe Sleigh Bells in concert, it would be loud. Noise pop is in fact the perfect way to describe what the musical duo performed, with what vocalist Alexis Krauss described in an interview with Australian music magazine Inpress as a mixture of “distortion and volume, poppy vocals mixed with harsh, over-driven, blown-out beats.” Consisting of Krauss, previously a teacher, and guitarist Derek Miller, formerly of the band Poison the Well, Sleigh Bells combines “guitar rock and electric music” for a unique sound, according to Miller in an interview with Pitchfork.
AraabMuzik, whose real name is Abraham Orellana, began the show with loud, fast-paced, rhythmic beats, better suited for dancing than Sleigh Bells’ set. His style revolves around a diverse sampling of music such as trance music and dubstep; he then uses the MPC drum machine to cut up the samples and incorporate rapid drum patterns. His performance was entertaining, and the music was catchy and well received by the audience, even more so for those who enjoy the genres incorporated into his music. As with any concert, the crowd got a little crazy after a few songs, especially those who were closer to the stage. There was a circle of students running into each other, and at one point, it felt as if the audience was pushing on itself from every direction. 
The gap between AraabMuzik’s performance and Sleigh Bells’ was a long one, and people began to feel impatient, inspiring a few to start chanting, “Sleigh Bells! Sleigh Bells!” When Krauss and Miller eventually emerged on the stage, the crowd went wild again, excited for the concert they had come to watch. Krauss jumped around onstage and held hands with members of the audience, and both Krauss and Miller dove into the crowd at one point. As a result, the audience gained the energy it had lost during the wait between sets. To someone unacquainted with Sleigh Bells, the vocals consisted of Krauss almost shouting at the audience, combined with an electric guitar and elements of electronic music in the background.
Overall, the concert was enjoyable and high in quality, even if the music style did not fit everyone’s palate. Sleigh Bells seems to enjoy playing with different elements, combining sounds that appear cacophonous at first, but work together to create a unique sound. For people that enjoy this music style, or are interested in trying something new, they can look forward to Sleigh Bells’ newest album, scheduled for release in 2013. In the meantime, they can listen to the band’s album Reign of Terror, released in February.

Intriguing souvenirs and relics well worn by the sands of time send visitors hurtling back to the past in Inventing the Modern World: Decorative Arts at the World’s Fairs, 1851–1939 at the Carnegie Museum of Art.
The exhibition, which opened Oct. 13 in the Heinz Gallery, is more than a simple collection of artifacts from eras gone by: It’s a veritable time travel portal. Opening with a rich collection of beautiful wood furniture, elaborate vases, and intricate jewelry from the mid-19th century, the exhibition advances chronologically through the world’s fairs spanning into the late ’30s.
The exhibit looks like a behind-the-scenes tour of a strange movie that’s a combination of Indiana Jones, The Great Gatsby, The Phantom of the Opera, and a live-action version of The Jetsons. It gives off the feeling of walking through a time traveler’s bazaar, weaving a cohesive and elegant thread through a medley of artifacts that are otherwise startlingly incoherent.
Besides taking its audience on a fascinating trip into the golden days of the past, the exhibition inspires viewers to reflect on the place of art and craftsmanship in modern society. Everyday objects in the exhibition, from puff boxes to bookcases and arm chairs, are transformed from mundane to magnificent solely for decoration. 
Have we as a society lost that appreciation for flowery detail and unnecessary embellishment, or is there still a vibrant culture that supports an artistic, innovative spirit? The exhibition subtly asks these questions of the viewers from behind the beautiful display.
It’s impossible not to wish you were seeing all of these items for the first time at the world’s fairs. A collection of early Tiffany & Co. jewelry shines brightly under the lights of the display case, and the Art Deco-era radio broadcast panel from KDKA’s first broadcast is on display. The bookcases look as if they’re straight out of Hogwarts; the chairs range from absurdly futuristic to old and indescribably detailed; and the vases and teapots from all over the world make Paul Revere’s silver teapot look like a toy.
The exhibition is appropriately — fulfilling, yet not overwhelming. It takes viewers back in time for a stroll through the world’s ever-changing aesthetic tastes while also prompting them to think about the relationship between the arts and the world. This blending of themes was certainly no easy task. 
As is always the case at the Carnegie Museum of Art, the exhibition is well researched, informative, and interesting. It’s quite apparent that the exhibit planners paid great attention to detail, resulting in a satisfyingly rich color scheme and minute details, such as a draped curtain on the door between rooms. All of these elements come together to create a fascinating exhibit that blends history and art.
Whether you’re interested in ogling Tiffany & Co. bracelets and necklaces or discovering the trendiest way to style a chair in 1918, this exhibition will satisfy both your historical hankering and your artistic craving.
Inventing the Modern World: Decorative Arts at the World’s Fairs, 1851–1939 will run at the Carnegie Museum of Art through Feb. 24.

“What happens when the arcade closes?” Disney’s newest effort, Wreck-It Ralph, creatively answers this question through the story of a bad-guy-turned-hero. Wreck-It Ralph is an original film that explores an imaginary world of living, breathing video game characters: When the arcade closes at the end of the business day, the characters are free to shed their programmed roles, and (for the movie-watching audience) the real entertainment begins.
Unlike most movies, our protagonist in Wreck-It Ralph is the so-called villain. Ralph, voiced by John C. Reilly, is programmed to fulfill his role as the hot-tempered, destructive giant of the game Fix-It Felix, Jr. Even though Ralph is labeled as a “bad guy” from the onset, the audience views him as anything but. Rather than a menacing giant, the Ralph the audience meets at the beginning of the film is a pitiful character, neglected by his fellow video game characters and relegated to a rotten existence in the dump.
Although he stands at a hulking nine feet tall, with each hand about twice the size of his head — perfect for smashing buildings — Ralph’s tendency to pulverize everything he touches (when not in his video-game mode) is the result of innocent clumsiness rather than violence or malice. In a group therapy session with other video game villains like Bowser and Dr. Robotnik, Ralph reveals a deeply sensitive side and a lifetime of hurt as he questions his role in the video game world.
Ralph’s discontent reaches a boiling point within the first few minutes of the film. With the 30th anniversary of their game at hand, the good people of Fix-It Felix, Jr. are celebrating in the penthouse with cake. As an integral part of the game, Ralph believes he should be invited to join the fun — but even among his colleagues, he is rejected as the “bad guy.” Ralph receives a challenge from the other characters: If he wins a medal — an honor reserved for good guys only — he can move out of his pitiful home in the dump and into the penthouse.
Therefore, in spite of his bad guy title, the audience instantly sides with Ralph in the events that follow.  Finally fed up with his circumstances, Ralph begins to “game jump”; navigating through the arcade’s Game Control Center, he tries to participate in games he wasn’t programmed into. But a serious problem arises when Ralph fails to return to his own game and Fix-It Felix, Jr. gets scheduled to be unplugged — a virtual death sentence for any game in the arcade. 
The real magic of the film is the unlikely yet ultimately unbreakable friendship that forms between Ralph and Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman), a go-kart racer in the candy-coated game Sugar Rush. Both characters are outcasts in their own games. The two characters couldn’t be more different, but somehow, united by their misfit status and mutual desire for acceptance, the pair makes for a great team. The two must team up to get Ralph his medal and enable Vanellope to finally achieve her dream of racing with the other characters.
Despite the humor that often characterizes their relationship, it is clear to the viewers that, over time, the two develop a profound bond that transcends mere friendship — to the point of self-sacrifice. Between their hilarious exchanges and obvious devotion to one another, the friendship between Ralph and Vanellope — two mismatched, entertaining, and incredibly devoted heroes — elevates the movie from a series of video game references to a film that anyone can enjoy.
Wreck-It Ralph is a funny movie that manages to incorporate many elements of video game history, while still retaining the heart of a Disney film. Between an original premise and a set of lovable, amusing characters, Wreck-It Ralph is a cinematic success.

If you’re looking for a restaurant with lounge music, an older crowd, and expensive food, Spoon is a good place to start.
Located at 134 South Highland Ave., Spoon is approximately 30 minutes from campus by foot and six minutes by car. The price of its appetizers ranges from $7 to $14, and the price of entrées goes from $14 to $38.
A tip for eating at any restaurant: If the bread is good, the napkins are towels, and the placemats are fancy, then the food will likely be delicious but expensive. Spoon is dimly lit to create a romantic atmosphere and has a beige curtain going across half the room, so you could reserve the space behind the curtain for a formal event. Spoon also has a fireplace surrounded by couches for those waiting to be seated. Each door has a long, intricate spoon for a handle.
This meal consisted of the $9 roasted kabocha squash soup appetizer, the $25 pork three-ways entrée, the $5 roasted fingerling potatoes side, and $6 Sangria. If you want something to drink other than wine, Spoon may not be ideal: The restaurant mostly shelves wines, but it did have Wigle whiskey and some beers.
The staff served three different breads with the meal: cream cheese bread with chives, corn and dill bread, and fresh homemade baguettes. Sometimes the cream cheese bread had a mild dash of the topping that spiked the flavor of the soft bun; other times, it was layered on thickly.
The kabocha squash soup would be better suited as a bread dip. It has a very thick consistency and a mustard-like flavor, with pockets of meat and sour cream. Dipping the corn and dill bread in it is a bad idea, but if you dip the cream cheese bread in it, the flavors explode in your mouth.
The pork three-ways entrée has a wide range of flavor, but only displays two ways of cooking pork, as opposed to the advertised three. The first sample of pork was a marinated tenderloin sliced into thin strips with gravy drizzling, all on a bed of sauerkraut and green beans. The bedding had a distinct lemon flavor to contrast with the peppered pork.
The second sample was called a pork belly “haluski.” The meat was soft on the inside and faintly crunchy on the outside. Resting on a bed of noodles and bacon, it tasted like savory chicken with a bit of oil, and resembled lamb. Between the two meats lay a caramelized fig, which can be a nasty surprise if one  expects another piece of meat.
Overall, the restaurant staff presents its food in a loving and appetizing manner, accenting the finer parts of a dish by laying them on top of the other food. Each piece contributed to the flavor as a whole, and if one part was unappealing, there was always another part to turn to.
Although the food is impeccable, the service at Spoon is less so. At least twice, waiters and waitress dropped dishes in the background. The bar service, however, was pleasant and attentive. One of the bartenders was cheery, although she kept dropping dishes.
Spoon is expensive and relatively far from campus, but it serves food that is diverse in flavor; it’s best for formal events or special nights out. Overall, it rates four out of five spoons.

“It feels like the world is a dystopia where victims don’t get justice and corruption prevails,” Crystal Castles singer Alice Glass reflected in an interview with online music blog Pretty Much Amazing. This statement characterizes the atmosphere of the band’s newest album, (III), which is currently available for streaming and will be released Monday.
While the distorted, low-fidelity electronics are reminiscent of Crystal Castles’ 2008 and 2010 albums — (I) and (II), respectively — (III) possesses significantly darker undercurrents. The majority of the tracks seem to channel Glass’ above statement, using deep synth sounds, eerie vocals, and fragmented white noise to allow the listener to experience the lead singer’s personal misery.
The raw, distorted sounds that permeate the tracks add to (III)’s deliberate ugliness. In its effort to capture what Glass and producer Ethan Kath perceive to be a very bleak reality, the record matures the abrasive electronic experiments that typified (I) and (II). The Canadian duo deliberately chose to abandon computers and digital equipment in its production, creating a unique analog quality that manifests itself through unrefined beats and obscure vocals. There are no samples, no covers, and no guest singers. Gone are the catchy, punk anti-melodies of the songs “Courtship Dating” and “Doe Deer”; here, the lyrics shroud themselves in sheets of feedback and pulsing drones.
Glass’ vocals — too quiet in some songs — may be the most distinctive feature of the album. Her mangled language flits through the song “Kerosene,” whispers within mechanical whirrings in “Mercenary,” and soars above melancholy refrains in “Child I Will Hurt You.” “Wrath of God” is arguably the best song in the album, clearly illustrating Glass’ ability to inextricably weave her dark vocals into the fabric of Kath’s compositions — a feature absent from the group’s two previous releases.
Also notable is the album’s use of drums. The rhythms of “Pale Flesh” and “Affection” evoke the hip-hop and stop-timed beats prevalent in the witch house genre. Coupled with elements from genres like noise, drone, and shoegaze, the fusion of chopped and screwed techniques undoubtedly reflects larger musical trends; however, (III)’s intense instrumentation sets it apart from its contemporary electronic counterparts.
Crystal Castles’ latest chapter is a radical departure from its previous releases, eliciting emotion that appropriately responds to our harrowing and uncertain world. Even (III)’s cover art indicates deep horror: A veiled Yemeni woman cradles her injured, naked son. Huge and luminous, the image has been stripped of its context, glowing blacklight purple against a shrouded void.
We must consider the implication that, as we lose ourselves in Glass’ voice from the comfort of our headphones, unimaginable terrors roil elsewhere. Even the track names — “Plague,” “Kerosene,” and “Violent Youth” — allude to real human atrocities. (III) is unique in its illustration of relevant political and social themes, a feature that distinguishes it from any other record release this month.

Dear Patrick,
I’m turning 22 this week, and no one seems excited. Everyone went crazy last year, and no one seems to care now. Are birthdays not important anymore? Did my birthday celebrations peak at 21, when I threw up in the middle of the South Side?
Say it ain’t so,
Barely Invigorated Regarding The Hullabaloo, Daunting Age Yet Buoyantly Optimistic Yearly
Dear BIRTHDAY BOY,
I’m sorry, but you’re old now. Twenty-one is the last birthday that’s fun. What do you have to look forward to with your next birthdays? Nothing but old age. You’re officially in your early 20s. It’s all downhill from here. But since you’re over 21, you can drown your existential sorrow in alcohol! Welcome to adulthood.
There’s nothing inherently exciting about your birthday anymore — all the big ones now are just markers on your road to death — but that doesn’t mean they can’t be fun! Your friends aren’t excited? Remind them of all the fun things you did for their birthdays so they’re guilted into doing something for yours. Nothing holds off the existential dread of old age better than a chocolate cake you guilted your friends into baking.
Every second brings you closer to death,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
Why doesn’t my roommate catcall me any more? In the past, whenever I’d take my clothes off before taking a shower, he’d hoot and whistle. I used to roll my eyes, but now I miss it. What happened to our spark? Is there anything I can do to liven up our roommate relationship?
Thanks,
Originally Lustful Declarations Miffed, After Removal Regret Ignoring Erstwhile Declarations, Can Old Utterances Please Linger Everlastingly
Dear OLD MARRIED COUPLE,
Let me guess: You guys have been living together for over a year now, right? That’s about the time when things become routine. He’s just too used to the sight of you walking to and from the shower in your underwear to even muster a half-hearted whistle.
You need to reinvigorate your relationship. Take your roommate out for drinks and catch up. Spark things up with some fancy underwear the next time you get ready for the shower. Just because you’ve been living together for a while doesn’t mean you can’t still have fun.
Try returning the favor every once in a while,
Patrick Hoskins

There comes a time in every boy’s life when he becomes a man. For some, it is when they lose their virginity. For others, it is their first drink or their first fight. For others still (hint: Carnegie Mellon students), it is running their first program. For me, however, it was when I first heard Foals.
Foals is an indie rock band from England. The core members of the band started their musical careers in a small math rock group based in Oxford, but they disbanded and created the band Foals in 2005. Moving away from hard math rock, a very rhythmically complex genre, and into a more math-inspired indie rock feel, the band released its first album in 2008, titled Antidotes. It was this album that turned me into a man.
I don’t remember exactly how I came upon the album, but it was good enough that I actually went out and bought a physical copy. Never before had I found something that challenged me musically and intrigued me as much as Foals did. So when its second album, Total Life Forever, was announced in 2010, I had to preorder it. Total Life Forever continued with the band’s departure from math rock into a much more indie (some would say accessible) sound, but it remained uniquely identifiable as Foals.
The band’s new single, “Inhaler,” dropped last Monday. Once again, Foals moves even further away from math rock and Antidotes. Put simply, “Inhaler” is less math, more muscle. The album, called Holy Fire, comes out in February, and you can bet your plaid pantaloons that I’ll be preordering it as well. Foals isn’t just the funkiest, most fun-loving band out there. Foals has the musical genius that bands strive for years to emulate, and it does something that very few other bands can do: hange its sound, and remain just as good as it was in the first place — if not better.

Batman Begins
7 10 1
Here we go. Strap in for Christopher Nolan’s reboot of the movies that got fanboys to issue death threats to critics who didn’t like them. This is serious business for a lot of folks, and they’re very serious movies. Why so serious, you ask? Batman Begins explains the genesis of Christian Bale’s reconstruction of Bruce Wayne. The film was released in 2005 and plays off public fear of biological warfare and weapons of mass destruction. Remember those?
The Dark Knight
7 10 1
Christopher Nolan’s strained seriousness continues with The Dark Knight, which will come to be known as a major turning point in the relationship between the box office and superhero franchises. The film gives up the pseudo-sociology of its predecessor in favor of one fear to conquer them all: chaos. Batman must save Gotham from the nihilism of Heath Ledger’s Joker, who is presented with so much fury and skillful panache that it is distracting. Whether he’s walking on screen to intimidate some henchmen or to blow up a boat, his virtuosity overwhelms the picture.
The Dark Knight Rises
7 10 1
All good things must come to an end, right? This one just takes three hours and six endings. The Joker’s ghost hovers over this final chapter, in which Bane attempts to destroy Gotham once and for all. Christopher Nolan’s social consciousness also reaches new, strange heights as he tries to address the Occupy movement and economic inequality. Ultimately, the movie presents a bizarre rightist argument after two hours of exposition, but it will certainly tickle your inner Pittsburgher with some noticeable impressions of the city where it was filmed. It’s loud, it’s big, and it’s Batman.
TBA
8 10 12
AB Films continues its semesterly tradition along the lines of this week’s Batman theme. Be sure to bring identification (other than your Carnegie Mellon ID) proving that you are 18 or older, and enjoy this departure from Dollar Movie’s usual content.

A record-breaking number of Carnegie Mellon students showed up at the polls this year. Students cast 1,445 votes at polling locations on Carnegie Mellon’s campus, a leap from the 1,140 votes cast in the 2008 election.
This increase in voter turnout did not necessarily mean greater enthusiasm for the election, but was due in part to the increased number of voters on campus. In 2008, there were 2,153 registered voters at Carnegie Mellon; this year, there were 3,269.
Thus, the percentage of voter turnout actually decreased from 52.5 percent in 2008 to 44.2 percent in 2012, according to the Allegheny County Pennsylvania Election Detail District Report.
According to that same report, 1,724 Carnegie Mellon students voted for President Barack Obama, 368 voted for Republican candidate Mitt Romney, 57 voted for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, and 18 voted for Green Party candidate Jill Stein.
Compared to the 2008 elections, Obama did not have as great of a lead among Carnegie Mellon students in this election. In 2008, Obama accrued 83.41 percent of the Carnegie Mellon vote, leaving Senator John McCain with 13.28 percent of the vote for those who did not vote a straight party ticket.
This year, Obama received 78.69 percent of the campus vote, and Romney received 17.23 percent. The percentages for those who voted straight party remained similar.
Students emerging from the voting booths expressed their enthusiasm in voting for their respective candidates.
“I voted for Obama because Mitt Romney seems like the king of contradictions, and Obama clearly has a good track record in terms of recovering the economy, in terms of social issues for gay rights and women. When he spoke on campus [last summer], he said he would take the gloves off and not be as compromising as he was in the first two years,” said Michael Hadida, a fifth-year architecture major.
Students who voted for Romney based on his economic plan were disappointed with Obama’s re-election. First-year undeclared Dietrich College student Laurnie Wilson said, “I mostly voted for Romney because I didn’t like how the current economic state has evolved under the Obama administration. I’m disappointed that Romney lost, but I wasn’t necessarily surprised.”
Reid Sherard, senior decision science and Chinese double major, said, “I voted for Romney to vote against Obama, because I didn’t like his economic plans. I think adding $4 trillion to the national deficit is a sign of mismanagement despite how the rest of the economy is doing. I liked Romney’s rhetoric on cutting the national debt because I think we can’t be spending $4 trillion of my children’s money; it’s only going to lead to a bigger economic problem than what we have now.”
Some students, however, made their decisions based on Obama’s social views, and were excited for another four years of his presidency.
Michelle Couste, a sophomore civil and environmental engineering major, said, “I know that the economy is improving, and I think Obama is doing a decent job. I agree with him on more of the social issues than Romney. Despite being a Catholic, I’m pro-gay marriage, and I support his other social issues. I wasn’t positive that Obama would win because it was definitely close, but I’m happy that he won.”
Students showed up to support both Obama and Romney at an election results viewing event co-hosted by the student body president and vice president and Activities Board Political Speakers in Rangos Hall last Tuesday.
Student Body Vice President Meela Dudley, a senior professional writing and creative writing double major who identified herself as a right-leaning centrist, predicted that the election would come down to the swing states of Florida and Ohio.
Dudley said that she voted on the basis of social, not fiscal issues. “I tend to believe that I prioritize the social issues.... After the second debate, it became clear that neither candidate had a solid [economic] plan. Each kept on saying ‘I’m going to fix it, I’m going to fix it,’ so that’s become less important to me, and I’ve been focusing more on social issues,” she said.
Luke Sampson, a first-year biology and economics double major, and Taylor Maggiacomo, a first-year chemistry major, both wore matching red “Keep calm and vote for Romney” shirts to the viewing party. Sampson referenced Romney’s economic policies as the reason he chose to vote Republican. “His economic policy I agree with more than Obama’s; it seems the reason I really stayed Republican was that I just tend to agree with the Republican point of view more than the Democratic point of view,” he said.
Kevin Apolo, a first-year mechanical engineering major wearing a button supporting Obama, cited the President’s policies toward college students as a reason for voting for him. “I probably wouldn’t be in college because of the loans that I had to pay later on if it wasn’t for some of the things he implemented,” Apolo said.
Despite clashing ideologies, students who attended the event shared a common desire for future hope. First-year mechanical engineering major Connor Livingston summed up the attitude of the event when he said that no matter who won, “America will win.”

Undergraduate students have voted in favor of recommending an increase in their student activities fee, while graduate students have voted against the proposition. The fee increase for undergraduates will be brought to the Board of Trustees for consideration.
Voting 64.02 percent in favor and 35.88 percent against (681 and 382 votes, respectively), undergraduates have supported student government’s recommendation to suggest an increase in the undergraduate student activities fee by 25 percent.
Graduate students rejected the recommendation to raise the graduate student activities fee, voting 16.51 percent in favor with 157 votes, and 83.39 percent against with 789 votes.
Voting ran between last Thursday and Saturday evening and was conducted through the student government website.
Upon visiting the website, the voter was first shown a message from Jon Mark, the Student Body Vice President for Finance. The message included links to an activities fee data sheet and presentation.
Students, depending on their status as undergraduate or graduate students, were presented with the opportunity to vote on whether there should be a recommended increase in their student activities fee.
Above the voting box was a paragraph explaining what the activities fee is intended to do and examples of organizations that benefit from this money. The explanation concluded with a justification for the proposed increase and the numerical increases that would be recommended by a “yes” vote.
Voter turnout for the election was markedly low, with only 18.11 percent (1,053 out of 5,816) of undergraduates voting, and 16.83 percent (945 out of 5,614) of graduate students voting. This resulted in a total voter turnout of 1,998 out of 11,430, or 17.48 percent of students.
Mark, a senior lighting design major, said that the voting percentages do not add up to 100 percent because some students logged in and hit the vote button without selecting an option.
Gina Casalegno, the dean of student affairs, said in an email, “I am pleased to see the results have generated decisive input on the wishes of the undergraduate and graduate student populations. Voter turnout was on par with totals we have seen in past general student government elections, which is impressive for a special election.”
In the spring 2012 general student government elections, 27.61 percent of undergraduates voted, and 4.98 percent of graduate students voted. In the 2011 general elections, 25.45 percent of undergraduates and 6.99 percent of graduate students voted.
Casalegno continued, “I applaud Jon Mark and those who supported his efforts to gather and present relevant data and information to the student population describing the strains faced by Senate, the Joint Funding Committee, and many student organizations and projects. Carnegie Mellon University has a long tradition of student governance, and I am pleased the election yielded clear input to guide student government’s final recommendation to the Board of Trustees for their approval of next year’s activities fees.”
Mark was also happy with the results. “I was pretty convinced the undergraduate measure would pass, and figured the graduate referendum wouldn’t pass,” he said.
He praised the Graduate Student Assembly (GSA), saying, “GSA did a lot of work getting people informed.” He noted the higher graduate student voter turnout as compared to the previous student body election.
Andrew Schwartz, a sophomore information systems major, served as a researcher on the fiscal data for student government, and was pleased with the result. “I think it’s a phenomenal step,” he said.
Schwartz described how a number of student organizations had solicited JFC for money, but were unable to receive it. “Now that there’s more money in the system, we know exactly where to put it,” he said.
Dylan Mori, a senior chemistry major and president of the Kiltie Band, was pleased with the vote. “I know a lot of organizations got hit hard last year with JFC cuts, our organization included,” Mori said.
“I expect that you’ll see more activities on campus, and less brownie sales,” Schwartz said.

A former Carnegie Mellon trustee has been charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering. Marco Delgado (HNZ ’90), a lawyer who lives in El Paso, Texas, was arrested by U.S. Department of Homeland Security agents in Texas last Friday, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
According to court documents, a grand jury indicted Delgado for laundering money associated with drug dealing in Texas and outside the U.S. from July 2007 to December 2008. The Post-Gazette reported that he allegedly helped the Mexican Milenio drug cartel, also known as Cartel de los Valencia, launder approximately $600 million. Delgado endowed a scholarship in Heinz College for Hispanic graduate students in public policy and management in 2002; in 2005, the Carnegie Mellon Alumni Association granted him an Alumni Service Award, which recognizes those who have been active in alumni or university affairs. According to the Post-Gazette, Delgado was appointed to Carnegie Mellon’s Board of Trustees in 2006. He was listed as a board member for this year, but left the board this summer.
This is not the first time that a university affiliate has faced charges of money laundering. In 2009, the general partners of Westridge Capital Management, Inc., in which Carnegie Mellon was an investor, were brought up on charges of money laundering, fraud, and conspiracy. According to Bloomberg, the partners used investment money to buy “homes, cars, horses, and collectible teddy bears.” Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh, which was also an investor, sued.

CMU team takes first place in programming contest
Senior computer science major Nathaniel Barshay, computer science Ph.D. student Yan Gu, and senior computer science and mathematics double major Jonathan Paulson took first place in this year’s regional competition for the Association for Computing Machinery’s International Collegiate Programming Contest (ACM-ICPC). Five teams from Carnegie Mellon competed.
“The performance of our teams was tremendous,” said head coach Danny Sleator, professor of computer science, in a university press release. 
“Four of the top six teams were from CMU,” he added.
Barshay, Gu, and Paulson solved all nine programming problems presented by the competition in four hours. As the regional first-place team, they are guaranteed a spot in the international ACM-ICPC finals this summer.
The competition was held at Youngstown State University this year.
There were numerous competitors from Carnegie Mellon also participating in the competition, with the other four teams placing fourth, fifth, sixth, and 23rd out of 131 teams.
CMU-Q sponsors stand-up comedy showdown
Carnegie Mellon’s Qatar campus hosted Stand Up Comedy Qatar (SUCQ)’s Comedy Showdown, in which alumnus Mohammed Fahad Kamal competed for laughs on a team of Qataris against a team of expatriates, last Tuesday.
Kamal is the first Qatari stand-up comedian. Kamal explained, in a university press release, “It feels wonderful, I cannot wait to go on stage and perform for the community that I love so dearly. I just hope that my professors can understand that I used my business degree from CMU to become a successful comedian.”
The showdown aimed to bring together Qatar’s different communities by uniting both nationals and expatriates through comedy and laughter. SUCQ is a coalition of stand-up comedians living in Qatar who promote comedy in the region by supporting rising comedians and hosting regular events and tours.
SUCQ’s long-term goal is to establish a successful and well-recognized yearly regional comedy festival.

Over the years, Carnegie Mellon students have been perceived as being apathetic about political issues. But students defied that stereotype this election season with a great on-campus voter turnout and active engagement in the elections.
Not only did many students and members of student government get involved during the campaign season by tabling and helping fellow classmates register to vote, but students also actively engaged in voting on campus at the University Center’s Alumni Lounge. Many students also attended the Elections Result Watch Party hosted by Student Body President Will Weiner, Vice President Meela Dudley, and Activities Board Political Speakers.
According to Allegheny County's Elections Division, the Alumni Lounge polling place on campus (Pittsburgh Ward 14, District 7) had 3,269 registered voters, with 44.2 percent of those voters casting ballots. 
After the Oakland-Soho and Lower Hills districts, Carnegie Mellon had the third-highest number of registered voters in Allegheny County, and that’s not including students who live off campus and voted off campus.
We were heartened to see students take the time out of their day to cast their votes in this presidential election.
After votes were cast, students continued to follow the election through the Elections Result Watch Party. Rangos Hall was fairly packed throughout the night, with students congregating around tables, trying to do homework while anxiously watching election news coverage. 
Although there were some technical difficulties near the beginning of the event, the party helped foster a deeper sense of community among students and actively engaged them through political trivia and prize giveaways.
The gathering made the elections a community event.
When presented with the opportunity, students showed a willingness to come together despite homework, tests, and projects to participate in this nationwide display of democracy. This election season has made us proud to be Carnegie Mellon students.

Remember, remember, the fifth of Movember... Wait, that’s not how the rhyme goes. It seems that few people have heard of the cause being championed by many men this month, but luckily, it’s starting to catch on. 
The premise is pretty basic: Begin clean-shaven on Nov. 1, and grow out your mustache in order to raise awareness for men’s health issues, such as pancreatic and testicular cancer. No other facial hair besides the mustache is acceptable.
This is in stark contrast to the more popular “No Shave November,” wherein guys compete to see who can grow out the most hobo-like beard in a shameless, albeit good-humored, display of laziness.
So is Movember an effective campaign? It’s hard to put aside the fact that awareness months of all types have come under fire in recent years for doing more to tell us what we already know, instead of actually offering tangible and constructive solutions. Even as a participant in Movember, I had not even heard of it until a week before it began this year.
I used to have a passable beard, but now whenever people see me, I inevitably hear, “Hey, isn’t it No Shave November?” I calmly explain that there’s also this thing called Movember; it’s for men’s health issues, and comedian and Parks and Recreation star Nick Offerman has an informative video about it.
I suppose, in a sense, that I am raising awareness for — if not necessarily prostate and testicular cancer — an event centered on the diseases. 
But I’ll admit that I could probably be doing more than simply growing out a mustache for a month to raise awareness for men’s health. I just have no clue what that is. Frankly, when December rolls around, I’ll likely go back to rocking the full beard in order to keep my face warm during the winter, even if it means looking like Zach Galifianakis.
I really have no response to those who call for me to take action rather than merely spread the word. Except, in this instance, I think people clearly are unaware that men’s health issues demand just as much concern as women’s do. 
This may seem slightly off-putting — even sexist at first — but equality works both ways. I know men have always had it easier than women throughout history, but nowadays it seems like you can’t even talk about how something might affect men negatively without raising all kinds of ire.
While guys can certainly man up and wear pink in October for Breast Cancer Awareness Month, it’s a slightly taller order for most women to sport a mustache in November — although false ones could be appropriate substitutes.
Ultimately, I’m happy with my decision to go the Movember route instead of No Shave. It piques people’s interest and gets them thinking, which is better than leaving them ignorant — a surefire way to get nowhere. The novelty alone is enough to make an impression.
At the end of the day, if nothing else, you can grow out your mustache — or wear a falsie if you’re one of the many people who just can’t — in order to stand in support of a family member, friend, classmate, or the countless strangers who have struggled with and fought against cancer and other diseases.
Who knows, maybe a little facial hair will go (or grow) a long way.

Cutting to the heart the of matter, The Onion makes me cry.
In the wake of Hurricane Sandy, which ravaged a large part of the Northeast with particularly bad damage in New Jersey and my coastal Connecticut hometown, The Onion managed to release a couple of darkly humorous pieces.
The Onion recently ran these two pieces with headlines: “Nation Suddenly Realizes This Just Going To Be A Thing That Happens From Now On” and “Report: Only Way Nation Will Pay Attention To Climate Change Is If Julia Roberts Dies In Hurricane.” While funny as usual, they also managed to be horrifying.
The U.S. has been suffering from a debilitating drought this past year, and has just now weathered a storm that has done unprecedented damage in the areas affected. Parts of New York City were without power for days, and entire neighborhoods were wiped away. Power is still something to be envied throughout much of the region: My neighbors were hosting friends lacking power earlier this week.
We will recover from this storm, much faster and effectively than from Katrina, it seems. But one needs to consider why so many natural disasters are befalling us, and to whom should we turn to answer these questions.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the two organizations of the U.S. government most qualified to speak on the matter, both say that global warming — or climate change, as its now called — is very real, and that the existence of the greenhouse effect is an indisputable fact.
Yet somehow, we won’t listen to scientists on the government payroll, and instead continue our inaction to save not only the world around us, but also ourselves.
Among environmentalists such as Bill McKibben, there’s an attitude that it’s already too late, that these storms are a fact of life now. As fictional people interviewed by The Onion said, we’ll have to get used to seeing American cities flooded and American homes destroyed on a regular basis.
There’s no reason for this. We know the primary cause is greenhouse gases, and nobody is arguing for more dependence on petroleum, but many of us continue to live as though nothing has changed. What will it take to make us realize our continued inaction is in direct opposition to our long-term existence?
Mitt Romney, the recently defeated Republican candidate for the presidency, is on record as a believer of climate change. Politics dictated that he not advertise that fact during his bid for the Oval Office, but you have to see the hypocrisy in claiming to want future generations of Americans to be “unburdened by debt” while at the same time turning one’s head to what threatens to drown them — in a much more literal manner.
I only hope that President Barack Obama, now with another four years, will be willing to take strong measures to combat the causes of climate change, particularly with the influence of the fossil fuel lobbyists.
I am taking the damage done to my hometown and the Northeast as a call to action. I intend to take active measures to reduce my carbon footprint, and to help advocate against the use of fossil fuels. While their use is necessary in some instances, we should do everything in our power to limit their use.
Just remember, the Geological Society of London and other experts in the field of geology are contemplating designating our current time period in geological history as the “anthropocene” since human-driven factors, such as the shift in weather, are the defining aspect of this part of the rock record. Millions of years from now, they will know what we did. Let’s do more to ensure our descendants are able to see the point in history when we started improving things.

Marco Antonio Delgado, former Carnegie Mellon trustee, was arrested last Friday on charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. 
Delgado was accused of aiding a Mexican drug cartel in laundering $600 million. On Thursday, Delgado pleaded not guilty. If convicted, he could serve up to 20 years in prison, according to CNN.
Although Delgado pleads not guilty and the case has yet to go to court, it is troubling that there have been multiple incidents in which notable people associated with Carnegie Mellon have been accused of financial foul play.
In 2009, Carnegie Mellon invested in Westridge Capital Management, Inc., the general partners of whom were charged with money laundering, fraud, and conspiracy, according to Bloomberg. Paul Greenwood and Steven Walsh were accused of using WG Trading Investors to buy homes, cars, horses, and collectible teddy bears.
Tuition at Carnegie Mellon is immensely expensive, and it increases every year. Students voted to raise the activities fee for undergraduate students in order to support student organizations and activities. It often seems that the Carnegie Mellon administration is largely focused on fundraising efforts. With this focus, though, we need the people who handle Carnegie Mellon’s fiscal responsibilities to remain uninvolved in such scandals.
When so much is expected of the students and faculty of Carnegie Mellon, both academically and financially, it is disheartening to see our Board of Trustees facing multiple allegations of possible fiscal malpractice.
Greater efforts must be made by the Board of Trustees to ensure that the future of Carnegie Mellon is in safe hands. In order to continue to excel as an academic institution, we need a guarantee that our finances, and the hands that manage them, are clean.

Tuesday’s election didn’t amount to a rejection of the Republican party, but a rejection of social conservatism. This didn’t play out too strongly in the presidential election, but in state-wide ballot measures and Senate races, social conservatism was almost unilaterally rejected by the American public.
Starting with Senate races, losing Republican candidates Todd Akin of Missouri and Richard Mourdock of Indiana were absolutely decimated by their remarks about rape. Both were running in very winnable Senate races in states that were noncompetitively in Romney’s column. Mourdock was defending the seat of the incredibly popular moderate Republican Dick Lugar, who served for six terms.
Both candidates were ahead in their respective races until they made their respective comments about rape. Akin said, “If it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.” Meanwhile, Mourdock said, “I think that even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen."
Immediately, the polls flipped. The margins Akin and Mourdock shared went to their opponents, and they subsequently lost their races. While being pro-life isn’t a particularly extreme policy position, having a fundamental misunderstanding of female anatomy and saying that rape is the will of God will land you in the nut job category. Voters are okay with pro-life candidates, but they will reject anyone trying to control their bodies.
At the ballot initiative level, gay marriage went three for four, winning in the states of Maine, Maryland, and Washington. I believe that we hit the inflection point on gay marriage sometime within the last few years, and it will soon progress to become the law of the land. Similarly, marijuana legalization went three for three, becoming recreationally legal in Colorado and Washington and medically legal in Massachusetts. I believe we've hit a similar inflection point here, and the federal government will soon get out of the way and let states decide for themselves if marijuana should be legal.
It’s time for the Republican Party to see the writing on the wall. We don’t need two liberal parties. We don’t need varying degrees of Democrats. The message of economic conservatives is still incredibly popular. Especially with the pending implosion of Europe, the message of fiscal restraint is something that voters want to see more of. Similarly, many Republicans prioritize economic issues over social issues. I lament that Republicans couldn't gain control of the Senate because of their social stances, and now we have to live with Obamacare.
Republicans can’t let antiquated social views get in the way of an economic message that could not be timelier.
It’s time not for the Republican party to pander to the left or to the center, but for its Libertarian wing to do so. To Republicans, I say embrace the mantle of limited government. Let social issues go; fiscal balance and restraint need to be priority one. Work with Democrats. Make concessions on social issues. Let us live free. But, please, don’t let anything get in the way of an sharing your economic message.

Cameras caught President Barack Obama’s supporters dancing into the early morning in Chicago, following his re-election. For one night, Obama was no longer the divisive and indecisive leader. He was the hero who was ready for his second act. The cameras failed to record, to the same extent, the bitter Republicans on the other side of a divide that has become increasingly evident. How these two sides come together will have a significant impact on how Obama continues the goals from his first term.
An immediate test of bipartisan dialogue is the “fiscal cliff,” the nearly $700 billion in combined tax increases and spending cuts set to begin next year. Following the election, Republican House Speaker John Boehner voiced his willingness to negotiate with Obama as long as tax rates remain untouched. Obama, however, has campaigned on his desire to raise taxes on the wealthy.
One side has to give. While reforming and simplifying the tax code is necessary, Americans seem to support higher taxes. Tuesday’s exit polls revealed that 60 percent of voters support tax increases.
Obama’s re-election was also a victory for his prized healthcare legislation, the Affordable Care Act, often referred to as Obamacare. Republicans’ hopes of repealing all or parts of Obamacare took a sobering hit with former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney’s defeat and the Democrats retaining the majority in the House of Representatives. 
Thus, 2014 will likely see the introduction of the individual mandate requiring most Americans to purchase health insurance and confirming the expansion of Medicaid.
Since Obama’s second-term economic policy will require significant patience to implement, I see him tackling social issues in the meantime. With referendums passing gay marriage in Maine, Maryland, and Washington, the movement to legalize same-sex marriage seems to be gaining momentum. 
But even with Obama’s official support for gay marriage, legalizing it nationwide faces long odds. As of now, 31 states, mostly in the South, have constitutional amendments that ban gay marriage.
Another social issue that will challenge Obama lies in immigration reform. During his first term, his failure to introduce an immigration bill was due to the troubling economy and Republican intransigence. This time, he has no excuse. 
Motivated by their lack of support from the Latino and Hispanic community — which voted for Obama over Romney 71 percent to 27 percent, according to CNN — Republicans will be willing to cooperate on immigration. Any bill will likely focus on strengthening borders and offering paths to citizenship for hard-working and educated foreigners.
This brings us to the Republican Party. If this election revealed anything, it was that the demographics of this country and American values are changing. Republicans need to reach out to the growing community of young Americans, women, and Latinos by changing their stance on abortion and gay marriage. This is the 21st century, and Americans’ progressive social morals should be reflected in Republican politics.
When it comes to the presidential election, America made the safe choice. The rate of economic recovery has been underwhelming and serious considerations must be taken into the excessive spending in demanding programs such as Social Security and Medicare. However, the changes presented by Romney and his running mate Paul Ryan were too extreme and too soon.
The ambitious promises Obama made four years ago will not be realized, but that doesn’t mean his policies have failed. The housing market is slowly recovering, and the unemployment rate is at its lowest since he took office in 2008. Ultimately, though, it’ll take great compromise from both sides of the aisle to achieve true progress for the country.

Maddox Derkosh, a two-year-old toddler, passed away at the Pittsburgh Zoo last Sunday after falling into the African painted dogs’ exhibit, where he was mauled while his helpless mother watched from above.
Some people were quick to blame this tragic event on the zoo or Derkosh’s mother; however, neither of those statements are true. One party cannot fully be blamed for this heartbreaking incident because it happened in a matter of seconds and was definitely not intentional.
The open side of the exhibit’s viewing deck has a railing slanted 45 degrees toward the edge of the deck and protective netting about four feet further down to prevent small objects from falling into the exhibit. These structures are meant to balance visitors’ ability to enjoy the exhibit and also ensure their safety.
Within the blink of an eye, Derkosh somehow fell out of his mother’s grip toward the security net, on which he bounced twice before falling into the African painted dogs’ exhibit, according to CBS Pittsburgh.
Even though the zoo successfully completed its five-year review in September, the exhibit’s railing was clearly not sturdy enough, or else Derkosh probably would not have fallen off it. Still, the zoo cannot completely be blamed for this tragic event, as almost every zoo has this type of exhibit set up in order to provide visitors a better view of the animals.
Unfortunately, it is nearly impossible to construct a foolproof exhibit; making zoos especially safe for small children is a difficult goal. But this is the Pittsburgh Zoo’s first instance in which a visitor’s life was lost since it first opened in 1898, showing how rare and unexpected these kind of incidents really are.
Despite many other visitors’ tendencies to lift their young children above the railing, the Derkosh family should not have followed suit and put the child in danger. However, one still cannot truly blame Derkosh’s mother for this accident. This mother, who is already distressed about her youngest son’s unforgettable death, does not need more stress on her shoulders by some members of society accusing her of something for which she solely to blame.
The closest staff member was only 10 feet away from the attack and immediately went into emergency response mode by attempting to lure the dogs away from Derkosh, as it was too dangerous for them to enter the exhibit. Unfortunately, four of these dogs were not easily called away from Derkosh. Instead, a keeper should have thrown real food into the exhibit to give those remaining dogs an extra incentive to leave Derkosh.
Even though the specific details about Derkosh’s fall are unclear, neither the Pittsburgh Zoo nor Derkosh’s mother can individually be blamed for this devastating event. One party alone is not responsible for this tragedy. Multiple factors were at play in this horrible accident, and hopefully the Pittsburgh Zoo and its visitors can make the necessary reforms to ensure such accidents don’t happen again.

Although news about the election has been predominantly focused on the presidential race, there were also a number of historically significant referendums that were passed at the state level across the country.
Last Tuesday was a particularly victorious night for LGBT rights. Wisconsin, Maryland, and Maine all became the first states to approve same-sex marriage by popular vote; a proposed constitutional amendment in Minnesota to ban same-sex marriage was defeated; and Wisconsin Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin became the first openly gay person elected to the U.S. Senate.
The election represents a watershed moment for gay rights in America, and a step forward for human rights. Approving same-sex marriage will give rights to couples who would otherwise be denied them. And Baldwin’s election gives hope that in the not-so-distant future, a person’s sexual orientation will be a non-issue for political candidates running for office.
But there’s unfortunately still plenty of work to be done. There are 32 states that currently ban gay marriage — Pennsylvania doesn’t even recognize domestic partnerships or civil unions, let alone same-sex marriages. Furthermore, Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey voted to amend the U.S. Constitution to ban same-sex marriage. 
By refusing to grant gay couples the same recognition and rights as heterosexual couples, these laws treat gay couples as second-class citizens and make them more susceptible to other kinds of discrimination, such as being prohibited from adopting.
Hopefully, this election will become a historic tipping point in the right direction for gay rights. We hope that the progress in last week’s election will build more positive momentum, so that by 2014, even more states will follow Wisconsin, Maryland, and Maine’s lead.

You’re not a quitter, but there are times when you should stop what you’re doing and change your direction for the sake of your overall well-being.
Take a long look in the mirror, and ask the questions whose answers are not pleasant to hear.
Your strong personality, while key to defining who you are, can be intimidating to others. The next time you interact with someone new, be a bit more mindful of how you come off.
Put some clothes on. It’s cold out, and a sweater with sandals and shorts just looks stupid.
Sorry, you’re wrong.
Is your life extraordinary or extra ordinary? Remember: It’s all a matter of perception. If things are not what you would like them to be, try changing how you see the situation.
Do something crazy this week. Break the routine and let your hair down.
The holidays are coming up soon. Make sure that those whom you love really know how you feel about them. Express your love in a big way, and watch their hearts fill with joy.
You’re losing sight of who you are in the search for who you want to be. Take a step back, get the facts straight, and move ahead.
