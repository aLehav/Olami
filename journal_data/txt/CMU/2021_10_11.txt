Welcome to a new column where every week, we’ll be analyzing the results of the weekend’s college football games and talking about the next week’s before discussing how these tie into the race for bowls and, of course, the College Football Playoff.
This week’s rankings:
After five whole weeks in the backseat, Georgia has finally emerged to claim the #1 spot. They came into the season as the second-best team in the country, and since then, they’ve racked up a string of impressive victories to take the top spot from Alabama. In Week 1, they held #3 Clemson to just a field goal before going on a tear, winning their next four games by a combined 195-20 and shutting out #8 Arkansas. This weekend, they blew out #18 Auburn on the road, erasing any and all doubt that this team is here to play, and here to play well.
Next comes Iowa at #2, jumping a spot in the rankings. Their come-from-behind 23-20 win over Penn State, coming on the shoulders of quarterback Spencer Petras and four interceptions, gave them their first quality win of the season. Undefeated and with a cakewalk schedule from here on out, Iowa is looking like a true contender and could very well make the Big Ten title game undefeated.
Next comes #3 Alabama. Although they came into the season as the top-ranked team, their victories have been less than impressive, and this weekend’s 41-38 loss to unranked Texas A&M was the straw that broke the camel’s back. Alabama should be able to win out if they play their cards right, but a loss like Saturday’s can’t happen again for the Crimson Tide.
After them is #4 Michigan, also at 6-0, who have surprised many onlookers but haven’t been as dominant as they’d hoped. The one-touchdown win against Rutgers still stings them, and this weekend, they needed a last-second turnover to beat unranked Nebraska. Although there are legitimate warning signs for the Wolverines, they deserve better than the low rank that the AP poll gives them. 
One-loss Ohio State follows at #5 after massacring a relatively unimpressive Maryland, their otherwise impeccable record sullied by an early loss to Oregon. #6 Oklahoma is next, with six straight wins but nothing too impressive, with five of their six wins coming by a touchdown or less. Then comes #7 Penn State, who lost to Iowa on the road after losing quarterback Sean Clifford in the second quarter and falling on their own sword with penalties. Rounding out the top ten are #8 Cincinnati, who blew out Temple; #9 Oregon, who had a bye; and #10 Michigan State, who beat Rutgers and kicked BYU out of the top ten after the latter’s loss to Boise State.
Next week:
The games that are slated for this coming week present no real obstacles to any of the aforementioned teams in the top ten, with only #1 Georgia facing a ranked team in Kentucky. Expect the top ten teams to run the board, or close to it, and for the rankings to look much the same after Week 7.

Beşiktaş vs. Sporting
Both teams have fielded losses on Matchdays 1 and 2, and now sit at the bottom of the Group C table, with Beşiktaş ahead on goal difference. Ironically, these two teams have not only been putting up similar performances in the UEFA Champions League (UCL), but domestically as well. I’m leaning towards Beşiktaş coming into this match with the advantage, especially with the Turkish side hosting, but I don’t see either side making significant progress from this match.
Prediction: 1-1 draw
Club Brugge vs. Manchester City
Club Brugge has arguably had a better Champions League run so far compared to Man City, sitting behind table-toppers PSG purely on goal difference, but I expect this to change after this match. Although Club Brugge have been playing well, City will be coming off of what should be a rather low-pressure match against Burnley on the weekend, and will be looking to reclaim a Round of 16 spot.
Prediction: Man City wins 2-1
Shakhtar Donetsk vs. Real Madrid
Shakhtar Donetsk is sitting at the bottom of Group D, and I don’t expect this to change after this match. Despite Shakhtar being the hosts and Real Madrid looking shaky after their shock 2-1 loss to Sheriff, Carlo Ancelotti should have had enough time to turn his team around. Additionally, Shakhtar will be facing Zorya Luhansk on the weekend, and Real will likely arrive at the Olympiyskiy much better rested.
Prediction: Real wins 2-1
PSG vs. Leipzig
After their victory over Manchester City on Matchday 2, PSG will be looking to continue their momentum. With Leipzig having to face Freiburg on the weekend, it seems doubtful that the German side will have the stamina or the prowess to overcome the Group A table-toppers. Though the visitors will certainly be trying their best to climb out of the bottom of the table, they’ve had a dismal away record this season, and will need something special to topple PSG.
Prediction: PSG wins 3-1
Atlético Madrid vs. Liverpool
This is definitely one of the matches to keep an eye on this week. Although Liverpool is sitting solidly on top of Group B, an Atlético victory could see their positions switched. Although the Spanish side dropped points against Porto on Matchday 1, their recent victories over AC Milan on Matchday 2 and Barcelona domestically will lend them momentum going into Matchday 3. In contrast, Liverpool’s domineering 5-1 performance against Porto has been offset by draws against Brentford and Manchester City domestically. While I think the English side comes into this match stronger, Atlético hasn’t lost at home since February. All in all, this match seems too close to call.
Prediction: 2-2 draw
Inter Milan vs. Sheriff
Group D has been Sheriff’s playground these past two matchdays, and I wouldn’t be surprised if they kept that momentum going. While Real Madrid was hardly playing at their best on Matchday 2, there’s no denying that Sheriff is playing well and taking advantage of their opponents’ shortcomings. In fact, if Sheriff win on Matchday 3, they’re pretty much guaranteed at the very least a spot in the Europa League. Even if Sheriff take their first loss in this season’s Champions League group stage, Real Madrid would need to win by a three-goal margin to take the top spot. For now, Sheriff is sitting comfortably, and I’d expect them to stay that way after Matchday 3.
Prediction: Sheriff wins 2-0
Ajax vs. Borussia Dortmund
Neither of these teams have lost in this season’s Champions League so far, with Ajax ahead of Dortmund on goal difference. In terms of recent performance, Ajax definitely has a slight edge in both domestic and European competition. This, coupled with the fact that Erling Haaland’s fitness is still in question for the visitors, tilts the scales in the Dutch side’s favor.
Prediction: Ajax wins 2-1
Porto vs. AC Milan
AC Milan has yet to earn a point in this season’s Champions League, and I don’t see this changing on Matchday 3. Both teams lost to their respective competitors on Matchday 2, and both turned it around on the weekend domestically, but Tiémoué Bakayoko is still a question mark for AC Milan, and Porto will be enjoying home-field advantage. The Rossoneri will likely find themselves up against stiff competition in Porto.
Prediction: Porto wins 1-0
Salzburg vs. Wolfsburg
Salzburg is the only team in Group G that has won a game in this season’s UCL group phase, has won their last five matches, and has not lost since July. Now on a streak of 18 games without a loss, the Austrian side certainly looks capable of taking home all three points. Wolfsburg, on the other hand, seems to be inclined to draw matches this season, having drawn on Matchdays 1 and 2 in the UCL, and drawn in two of their last five domestic head-to-heads. I don’t see Wolfsburg winning this match, but I wouldn’t be surprised if this aforementioned tendency rears its head and salvages a point for the German side.
Prediction: 2-2 draw
Barcelona vs. Dynamo Kyiv
Barcelona is sitting at the bottom of the Group E table after back-to-back 3-0 losses on Matchdays 1 and 2 to Bayern and Benfica, respectively, and will be looking to change that with this match. Despite Barcelona’s dismal recent record, Dynamo Kyiv is still the underdog coming into this match in terms of individual player prowess and resources in general. Still, given how both teams have been performing, I think that Kyiv has a real chance at shutting out Barça. Barcelona does indeed have a very good shot at all three points but will need to make major corrections to get there.
Prediction: Kyiv wins 1-0
Lille vs. Sevilla
While Lille and Sevilla are technically only separated by a single point in the Group G table, Sevilla is definitely the stronger side in this match-up. As a side statistic, a red card has been shown in each of Sevilla’s last three matches, with two of them shown against Los Nervionenses. As a matter of fact, a red card has been shown in both of Sevilla’s UCL group stage matches, and I wouldn’t be surprised if this trend continues.
Prediction: Sevilla wins 2-0 and a red card is shown
Manchester United vs. Atalanta
Manchester United has won just two of their last six matches, and if they drop points to Leicester City on the weekend, they’ll face Atalanta not having won a domestic match in nearly a month. Although Atalanta doesn’t look significantly stronger than the English side, they have been performing much more consistently, and have a real chance at taking home all three points. If United wants to secure a Round of 16 spot, they’ll have to focus on polishing their tactics and doing a better job of integrating and utilizing Ronaldo. Both of United’s UCL group stage matches have ended with scores of 2-1 and I think it would be rather ironic if this one did too.
Prediction: Atalanta wins 2-1
Zenit St. Petersburg vs. Juventus
There’s not a lot to debate on this match: Juventus have been playing consistently. The Old Lady has won her last four matches and hasn’t lost in over a month. Zenit hasn’t been performing poorly this season, but it seems doubtful that they will be able to hold against the Italian side, especially with both Dybala and Morata set to return from injury. This match seems to be firmly in the hands of the I Bianconeri.
Prediction: Juventus wins 4-0
Benfica vs. Bayern
Bayern has been playing exceptionally well in Group E so far, sitting at the top of the table with the highest goal difference of all the group stage table-toppers so far. Although they’ll be away against Benfica, the German side certainly seems capable of taking home all three points. I would expect, however, that Benfica’s attack will take advantage of any breakthroughs they find.
Prediction: Bayern wins 3-2
Chelsea vs. Malmö
Malmö has stood no chance against its fellow Group H competitors, and it’s unlikely that this match-up with Chelsea will change that. Despite losing to Juventus on Matchday 2, Chelsea has been performing relatively well this season, and I would expect them to continue their form against the Swedish side.
Prediction: Chelsea wins 2-0
Young Boys vs. Villareal
Although Villareal sits at the bottom of Group F, this is the Matchday that could change that. Losing 2-1 to Manchester United on Matchday 2 and drawing 2-2 with Atalanta on Matchday 1, Villareal has come very close to fielding their first UCL group stage win. Young Boys is certainly coming in with more momentum, however, and the Spanish side will need to be on their guard and play smart to take home all three points.
Prediction: Villareal wins 1-0

What an Uber trip really costs
Ridesharing apps like Uber and Lyft have taken heat for being pricier than other transportation options. But what about their costs to society? This was the question that members of Carnegie Mellon's Vehicle Electrification Group aimed to address in a paper titled "Air Pollution, Greenhouse Gas, and Traffic Externality Benefits and Costs of Shifting Private Vehicle Travel to Ridesourcing Services." They found that the vehicles of these companies would not have to start the engine as often and also were newer and built to more stringent pollution standards than the average car. However, they also found that because drivers spend so much time driving between passengers and waiting for passengers, fuel consumption is about 20 percent higher than an average personal vehicle. As a result, they found that while an Uber or Lyft trip can reduce air pollution costs by nine to 13 cents per trip, the greenhouse gases, traffic congestion, and noise costs society 45 cents per trip. The team encouraged those taking Uber or Lyft trips to take pooled rides whenever possible to offset the cost.
The benefits of active learning, and how to implement it
Active learning is said to be better than passive or traditional lecture-based learning, but what does active learning really look like? Researchers from Carnegie Mellon's Human Computer Interaction Institute worked with those from other universities to compile their studies on what active learning looks like in a wide range of situations. In the studies, the researchers implemented active learning through physical activity, AI-based applications, "playful learning landscapes," and less structured activities like outings and play. Studies also found that students believed they learned more through traditional learning methods when in fact they learned better with active learning. Another study found that active learning can also reduce the difference in academic performance between students in minority and majority socioeconomic and ethnic groups.
Optimizing treatment for Parkinson's Disease
A team from Carnegie Mellon's Gittis Lab is looking into ways to extend the short-lived benefits of current treatment options for Parkinson's Disease. The treatment method in question is deep brain stimulation (DBS), in which electrodes implanted in the brain send electrical signals to the global pallidus, a part of the brain that controls movement. However, the effects of the treatment, which is control of unwanted movement, disappear immediately after DBS. The researchers looked into targeting specific groups of neurons in the global pallidus with short bursts of electrical stimulation and found that their treatment method seemed to provide benefits that lasted at least four times longer than those of conventional DBS.
Facebook and Instagram crash
Facebook and all its related products (including Instagram, Messenger, Oculus, and WhatsApp) were down for six hours on Monday due to what was supposed to be routine maintenance that disconnected all of Facebook's data centers from the internet. As the servers were unreachable, Facebook employees were unable to access the tools they would typically use to resolve the problem, prolonging the outage. 
Once they were able to reconnect the data centers to the internet, they gradually resumed services in a rollout to prevent crashes that would occur if all services resumed at the same time. During the period that Facebook was down, users turned to Twitter to resume posting on social media.
Facebook whistleblower testifies before Senate, armed with thousands of company documents
Former Facebook data scientist for the Civic Integrity team Frances Haugen, testified before the Senate on Oct. 5, arguing that Facebook did little to stop the harm that it did in misinformation and toxic content. But what makes her testimony more powerful than those who came before is that she amassed thousands of company documents during her time at Facebook that supports her case. Her testimony reveals that Facebook targeted teens, exploited their insecurities, and misstated and misportrayed its software’s harmfulness to its users.
Twitch hacked, with big consequences
Video game and entertainment streaming company Twitch was hacked, with 125 GB of its entire source code, creator payout reports, and other data from properties Twitch owns posted to anonymous comment board 4chan on Oct. 6. The poster said the reason behind the leak was to foster disruption in their belief that the Twitch community was "a disgusting toxic cesspool.” Security experts recommend changing Twitch passwords and turning on two-factor authentication.

If there’s anything that all of social media is talking about right now, it’s “Squid Game.” A nine-episode drama from South Korea, it follows a group of people, the lowest of society, playing dark and twisted versions of childhood games for a winning pool of 45.6 billion won, which is about 38 million U.S. dollars. 
The show follows Seong Gihun, a deadbeat father with an addiction for gambling, and an overall pathetic guy. Alongside him are players Cho Sangwoo, a disgraced businessman who got caught stealing money from his employers, Ali, a kind hearted man who is trying to raise money for his family, Oh Ilnam, a terminally ill old man, and Kang Saebyeok, a North Korean defector trying to raise money to get her mother across the border. 
The show opens up with Seong Gihun — a divorced, unemployed man who lives with his elderly mom. In all shape and form, Seong Gihun represents the bottom feeders of society. He is selfish, cowardly, gullible, and will do nearly anything for loose change. But is he supposed to convey the ways that people fall to ruin, or something larger? 
In the first episode, he competes against a mysterious businessman in ddakji, a Korean game involving two folded paper squares. The goal of the game is to use one square to hit the other square that is on the floor, and hit it hard enough that it flips over onto the alternative side. The businessman offers 100,000 won, roughly 83 dollars in USD, for every time that Gihun is able to beat him. However, if the businessman wins, he will collect the same amount from Gihun. 
Lo and behold, Gihun loses. Why would he not? Up until this point, he has done nothing but lose, so why would it be any different now? But he does not have the money to give. In fact, it would be more absurd at this point if he had anything at all. So the man says that Gihun can pay him back with his body. 
The wording is not unintentional. The way that the apathetic businessman tells Gihun that he can pay him back with everything he has, even his own being, is largely testimonial to an overarching theme in this story. Money is everything. Money owns you, and when you do not have it and you owe others, they own everything you have. Debtors own your life, your reputation, your body, your soul. 
Of course, in the show, “paying back with his body” is portrayed as a mere slap to the face. But it goes on. Gihun keeps losing, and he keeps getting beat down. We see this immaculately put-together man strike down a man we have seen to be nothing but pathetic, over and over again, but there is no catharsis in this. There is no emotional “aha moment” when we see someone who steals from his own mother get hit, over and over again. The reality is, despite being the bottom of the barrel, he is still human. 
He cares for his daughter, and watches almost helplessly as his life crumbles down in front of him. He cares about the other players in the game. But money will make the closest of friends turn on each other. Money will make the depraved even more so. Money will have you craning your head to stare up at a golden piggy bank as it fills with all the potential in the world, all of your debts cleared and your worries freed in the form of 38 million dollars. 
The show is, not very subtly, a stark criticism of the way our humanity is lost to greed and capitalistic leeching. It shows people form relationships, only to break them immediately afterwards. It shows people disregard families, alliances, treaties, and respect for the sake of winning. It shows people sell their bodies and souls to climb out of this pitch-black void of poverty that never lets anyone leave. 
“Squid Game” is captivating in a way that no show has ever been before. Despite language barriers that are often claimed to be the reason that platform users do not venture out of domestic venues, the show has ranked number one in 90 countries across the world. 
The show embodies the pain and desperation felt by the “losers” of society. The show is an extreme symbol for our society, and how we act in a market that is competitive and aggressive. We lose our humanity to succeed. We lose our bodies to succeed. 
The show is harrowing in a way that stands rare amongst entertainment. All forms of media hold some sort of message. Perhaps “Squid Game,” behind the honeycomb dalgona candy and the nostalgic “red-light, green-light” game, is meant to scream at us in a way that forces society to look up from the bottom of the barrel and point their fingers at those who hang money in front of us as a taunt, and at those who entertain and benefit from the cruelty of poverty.

Hello, I’m Zachary Gelman, and these are the top seven little known places on campus.
Starting off our list at number seven, we have the Gates-Hillman fourth-floor soundproof study-coffin. It may seem unassuming, but you might walk by this black box banality on your way to a delicious meal at Hunan Express, the number one Chinese food place on campus. Open 10:30 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and closed from 12 a.m. to 12 a.m. on Sunday, Hunan offers Carnegie Mellon's authentic Asian cuisine concept, featuring an open kitchen environment, customizable rice bowls, and bubble tea. Their menu is lovingly confected to produce the four basic tastes, as well as the mythical fifth one, known to food heads as “umami.” You can call Hunan Express at 412-268-5327 for more information or just take the trek down to GPS coordinates 40°26'36.6"N 79°56'43.9"W yourself.
Here at number six, this hidden locale is located behind Entropy, our own private supermarket. While most students will just be going there to pick up cans of coffee and various types of pre-frozen pizzas, there is actually an incredible treasure trove of food just behind the freezers waiting to be taken by Scotty scavengers in need. When your Dinex runs out, don’t forget to put on your Tartan ski mask and take a trip down the other side of the law. Who knows, maybe you’ll even get the apple juice before it gets taken!
Number five on this list goes to the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, located basically on campus. I’m just saying, if the Mellon Institute counts as being on campus, this might as well too. This library is known for being the “cool version of Hunt Library.” Of course, Hunt works fine when you need to pretend to study, or play a game of hide and seek, but if you want a real book, you gotta head down over to the CLP (as all in the know call it) and grab a copy of anything you’d like (as long as it has no cultural relevance, no copies of “Dune” or anything like that for you posers.)
Number four, what could it be but the top of the Miller ICA, upon where our beloved Scottish Terrier was projected every night during O-Week. He tragically failed his first interpretive dance assignment and got turned into glue, but the spirit of that charming mutt lives on in the hearts of all the drama kids that perform “Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark” up there every Thursday, weather permitting.
For number three, we have the CMU package pickup center. This unpopular area down in the lower level of the CUC sees few students, but after the release of this article, I expect many more will appear. Did you know that packages for students are kept there? Many students never find out, and graduate wondering what kind of donkey would steal all their mail. But fear not! Just go down to the CUC, and wait in a line of a length that I have been assured by reputable sources I may not reveal. Once you get there, don’t forget your photo ID! And don’t worry that there won’t be anyone else there, I mail myself five empty boxes a week to keep the workers on their toes. Once they get used to every package labeled 2824 being comically large and light, maybe I’ll finally order that box filled with novelty bricks I’ve been itching for.
Number two goes to the Jared Cohon Lockup Center, or JCLC for short. Nicknamed the “Amnesty Barn,” students that get called Amnesty upon themselves are quarantined here for their own safety, and then sent to a nice farm upstate where they can be with their childhood pets forever, while a nearly perfect doppelgänger replaces them. Most people won’t notice the difference between the duplicitous duplicate and the innocent original, but the best of friends will notice that their partner in crime no longer drinks boba vodka with the same gusto. 
At number one, we have the wifi cellar. Located at all times at the farthest point from you, here our precious STEMlords get community service hours responding to copyright infringement notices from ISPs and coaxing precious internet juice out of the well-worn modem. Did you know that the first wifi router was created in CMU? Our technological wunderkinds love to let loose by using that historical router sometimes instead. Of course, they don’t announce it beforehand, so never put your term papers to the last second.
Thank you for reading my listicle! If you have any suggestions for places that I missed, don’t forget to pop me a message over at provost@centralmichiganuniversity.edu.

Without fail. Amongst the decrepit old houses and the flickering lights on the street, his house at the end stands out. It’s the only mansion on the whole street full of shanty, run-down, cheap housing. Whereas the other houses are all disgusting shades of brown and gray, his house is a pastel pink, popping out at the end like a cyst in the neighborhood. He’s been there in that cyst longer than I’ve been alive. And every day, he looks out the window at 6 p.m. He stays there for the rest of the night, watching us all until all the lights on the street turn off.
No one knows why. He doesn’t do anything. Some think he’s a predator, staring at the children in the street as they play. Some say he’s just the rich guy of the neighborhood with nothing to do, looking down on the rest of us living in squalor. Some respected him for that. Others didn’t. But a few feel sorry for him. Maybe he’s just lonely and doesn’t know how to talk to people, so he resorts to voyeurism.
I am one of those few.
He came to the window again yesterday evening while my friends and I were playing basketball. As I made the jump behind the three-point line, I looked at the window and we locked eyes. There was something about them that seemed pleading, yet cold. There was no light in them, yet his stare felt inviting, beckoning me to approach him.
Before my shot bounced off the backboard, I was already walking toward his pastel cyst, continuing to maintain eye contact with him.
“Dude where are you going?” “You’re gonna die if you go there.” “He’s gonna kill you.” “Where the hell are you going?”
I’m not listening. His figure stands out in the window, a silhouette shadow with piercing and defined eyes. What is drawing me to this place? I feel sorry for him, sure. But until yesterday, I had never considered going to the cyst.
The light casts my shadow against the outer wall of his house as I get closer. And closer. My friends have followed me, trying to get me to stop but unwilling to inch closer. The old man leaves the window for the first time. The light flicks off for the first time. I can feel my stomach closing in on my esophagus. But my mind is enamored with something unexplainable: a feeling of security and strange desire.
Before I know it, the old man tepidly opens the front door. He locks eyes with me again. They look like shimmering pools. Why are they moving like that? I turn around to find my friends, but they’ve disappeared.
He opens his mouth and inhales, producing a severe inhuman screech.
“What do you want?” I asked.
He beckons me inside. What am I doing? Why am I following him inside? Do I want to do this? It’s something in his eyes. Or maybe it’s the house. The cyst of the neighborhood is still the nicest house on the street. Is this what morbid curiosity does? I don’t know what I’m doing anymore. Yet, the feeling of security is still there.
The interior walls have eyes. They’re the same as the old man’s, hundreds of pairs of shimmering pools lined against the wall, their bulging pupils tracking my stride as I slowly inch down the hallway. The old man turns around and lets out another inhuman screech.
“I don’t know what you’re saying.”
His brittle body shakes, subtly convulsing. He marches forward. The hallway never seems to end. We’ve been walking for either ten minutes or ten hours now. My footsteps turn to lead the further we walk.
Finally, we reach a set of stairs draped in a luxurious red carpet leading to a golden door. The old man screeches again, pointing at the door.
“What’s up there?”
He grabs me by my shoulders and turns me towards the stairs, gently positioning me in front of him. I can feel his heavy breathing on the back of my neck, sending synaptic shockwaves through my body. I have no choice. It’s time to go up those stairs. This can’t be happening.
I twist the doorknob ever so slightly. I look back at the old man, locking eyes with him again. Suddenly, I’m overwhelmed with the same emotion that drove me here. He knows me. He understands me. Yet he doesn’t know me and he doesn’t understand me. It’s a paradox of feelings that have led me to this door. The bulging pupils along the walls are all focused on me.
I enter the room, slowly closing the door behind me. It’s sparsely furnished. On one side, there’s just a bed. There’s an old man lying in it with an IV drip. On the other side of the wall, there’s an amorphous substance, pulsating slowly. Just staring at it would drive anyone mad, but I find it comforting. It speaks to me, but its words pass through me. There’s no comprehension in anything it says. I turn to the old man on the bed.
No. No it can’t be.
It’s the same old man.
I turn around, and the brittle inhuman who led me here is staring blankly at the amorphous substance. I turn back to look at the old man in the bed. He looks even worse than his inhuman doppelgänger. His eyes don’t look like shimmering pools. Actually, they look like mine.
“Boy . . .” the old man croaks. He beckons me over.
I gingerly approach him. He pulls me close.
“Get. Out. Of. Here. Break. The. Cycle.”
He is unable to pronounce a lot of hard syllables properly.
“What?”
“Don’t. Look. At. It.”
The amorphous substance on the wall speaks to me again. I turn around, drawn to it. My body and mind have dissociated, acting independently of each other. My body wants to run. But my mind has glazed over. The substance pulsates more intensely. The brittle inhuman in front continues to stare blankly as the substance emits a light that passes through us and into the old man on the bed.
I hear the old man slowly moan in pain. His moans develop to groans. The groans develop into wails. The wails develop into shrieks, slowly becoming more and more inhuman like the man who led me here. I turn around.
His skin is peeling off, pulling him off the bed and into the air slowly. His shrieks of agony increase in intensity, his skeleton and his skin being held together by strings of muscle and deeper epidermal tissue. The light melts the skin, the particles of blood and flesh slowly making their way towards the amorphous substance. The brittle inhuman behind me also lets out a screech. I turn back to see that its skin and muscle have melted, leaving only its skeleton. The particles of flesh and blood from the old man start attaching themselves to the exposed skeleton, creating a new undefined figure. The figure slowly develops into a bare naked body. Its face forms last as the old man’s eyes, nose, lips, and teeth morph their way onto the new figure’s face. The light from the substance fades away, and I’m able to get a good look at this new figure in front of me.
The figure is me.
It stares at me as I stare at it. I try to run, but it grabs me. I lean away, but it caresses my face. It gives me the look I give to others as I reassure them. It’s eyes are warmer than mine, like shimmering pools. Its face glows in a way mine doesn’t. It leans in, caressing its cheek against me. It opens its mouth, forces my jaw down, and presses its lips against mine. Our teeth scrape against each other for a second before it clamps its teeth into my tongue, slowly pulling it apart as I struggle to break free from it.
I get away, spitting out chunks of my tongue onto the floor, violently coughing in pain. I scramble for the door, but the figure grabs my leg. I’m dragged onto the floor, blood spilling out of my mouth. I scream and beg. I didn’t want this. It can’t end like this. It can’t end like this. It can’t—
I stare out the window, looking at the decrepit neighborhood, every day at 6 p.m. The days turn into weeks. The weeks turn into months. The months turn into years. The years turn into decades. Each day, I stare at the children, their parents, their loved ones, and their families, hoping one of them may look at me one day.
One day, someone finally made eye contact with me. There’s hope as I stare back. I’m watching him approach me, getting closer and closer. When his shadow is cast against the wall of the house, I get a good look at his face.
It’s me.

After another week, Carnegie Mellon’s positive cases among students, staff, and faculty decreased again. The week, starting Sept. 28 and ending Oct. 4, saw two cases among students living on-campus, three among students living off-campus, three among faculty and staff on-campus, and four among faculty and staff off-campus. This was lower than last week’s cases when there were 15 cases among students living on-campus alone. The decrease also reflects the number of cases dropping from the relatively high number of positive cases since the fall semester started. In September, Carnegie Mellon’s positive cases totaled 121, a pandemic-high for recorded cases at the university.
Additionally, 96 percent of the Carnegie Mellon population in Pittsburgh has been vaccinated, with 97 percent of students and 97 percent of faculty fully vaccinated. Carnegie Mellon reported that 1.97 percent of its Pittsburgh population has received vaccine exemptions.
Around Carnegie Mellon, Allegheny County’s COVID-19 caseload remained steady, with about 2,044 cases in the week beginning Sept. 26, compared to 2,093 the week before. The Allegheny County Council recently rejected a mask mandate that would have covered all public indoor gatherings.
Allegheny County Health Department’s September vaccination report estimated that 67 percent of eligible Allegheny County residents are fully vaccinated, and seven percent are partially vaccinated. Allegheny County’s vaccination rate is well above Pennsylvania’s vaccination rate as a whole. About 58 percent of Pennsylvania residents are fully vaccinated, with about six percent only partially vaccinated (Pennsylvania’s data excludes Philadelphia County).
According to the New York Times, Pennsylvania’s seven-day average of new cases per day was 5,253 on Oct. 10, up 15 percent from two weeks ago.

HackCMU was hosted both in-person and remotely last weekend from Oct. 1 through Oct. 3 by Carnegie Mellon’s chapter of Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), featuring prizes, beginner-friendly tech talks, meet-and-greets with sponsors, and lots of free food.
HackCMU is hosted annually during the fall semester, but, like many other hackathons, it went online last year. This year, the team at ACM was happy for the event to be back in person. While COVID-19 restrictions limited in-person attendance to 150 participants, the HackCMU organizers tried to make sure that remote students could participate as well. Registrants past the 150 limit were put onto a “waitlist,” in which they could still submit projects remotely to HackCMU’s Devpost. Organizers also monitored who of the initial 150 were unable to attend, admitting people off the waitlist whenever other participants dropped out.
“Even if you’re on the waitlist, [participants] can still hack virtually, but obviously that’s going to discourage people, so that was definitely a challenge,” said Michelle Zhu, ACM@CMU’s treasurer, webmaster, and one of the main organizers of the event. “Throughout the past few days, I’ve been furiously monitoring the waitlist, and as soon as someone is like, ‘Oh I actually can’t come,’ I try to get people off the waitlist as quickly as possible. We’re just trying to maximize this experience for everyone, but obviously right now with COVID that’s not completely possible.”
HackCMU also presented challenges that would apply to any hackathon, COVID-19 restrictions or not. One challenge was communication, as students in hackathons do not always stay in one place, and they often leave and come back to the main rooms when talks are available. Hackathon organizers tried to keep participants updated by sending regular communication through email and messaging apps like Discord.
HackCMU also struggled with submission rates in the past. Many of the students who register are beginners, and the event is hosted in the middle of the fall, so students have not yet been exposed to all of their content in computer-science related courses. The hackathon offered beginners many tech talks explaining technologies like React.js and Node.js, but it was difficult for them to grasp how to build a full-fledged app or piece of software in the limited time of a hackathon.
“The challenge at the beginning was figuring out how we would want to present it and implement it,” said Maggie Cai, who was part of a team of beginners called Rags to Riches. Cai’s teammate Jesse Ding added, “I definitely want to go out of my comfort zone next time to do something more technical [...] I don’t think it was feasible for us in 24 hours to learn, and actually implement our idea into one of the [popular technologies] like React or Node or stuff like that, so I think that’s something that we want to work on next time probably.”
The hackathon also took place during a midterm week, which took up some hackers’ time. “I was originally going to drop out because it’s midterm season so I want to study for stuff, but I’m glad I came. I really enjoyed it. The tech talks and just talking to people in general is really fun and interesting,” Cai said.
Despite some setbacks, both new and old, the team at ACM was satisfied with how the event went. The winners built applications predicting COVID-19 hotspots at dining locations, finding safer routes to destinations, and creating knowledge maps as an alternative to more linearly-structured documents. HackCMU also received a record proportion of submissions to registrations this year after implementing a new system where those who submitted were entered into a raffle system for prizes such as a giant teddy bear and free merchandise.
“We’re really happy that this year we actually had such great turnout,” Zhu said. “We were pretty surprised because we thought we definitely advertised a little bit later this year. And obviously COVID restriction still applied, and we had a waitlist, [...] but we still got up to almost 300 [registrants] so we were very, very happy that it all came together like this.”

Disclaimer: This article discusses heterosexual relationships.
Despite being labeled superficial by some, TikTok continues to give valuable insight into the dynamics of our current society. Look no further than the song “Breadwinner” by Kacy Musgraves, which gives audiences a peek into the life of a successful woman. The catchy tune, in conjunction with the underlying message, made the song a perfect candidate for a TikTok trend. Yet, beyond the shallow surface of failed lip-syncing videos and attempts to be “relatable,” this trend has revealed some otherwise intriguing facts about the contrast between the world of Musgraves' dreams, and the world we are currently living in.
According to a study done by the Pew Research Center, women are paid approximately 84 percent of what men are paid, making the likelihood of a woman being the breadwinner of her family incredibly low. This was echoed in TikTok, where most of the video content revealed that women are more likely to be supported by their husbands than to be the ones supporting them. Many are stay-at-home moms, and others are students whose partners are paying their way through medical or law school. The irony between the lyrics these women lip-sync to and the reality of their lives makes me wonder how achievable the idea of a female breadwinner is. Could this mean that the heterosexual feminist dream of being richer than her partner and struggling through the problems that arise with a reversed gender dynamic is a façade? Or is the reality that women, such as those whose partners are paying their way through college, see men as a step towards achieving this feminist dream? 
Nonetheless, the song goes much deeper than simply suggesting that a woman can be a breadwinner, and it also muses about the reversed power dynamic that occurs when a woman becomes the primary earner. In Kasey Edward’s article "Why it's Harder For Successful Women to Find Love," she discusses how difficult it is to find a partner who is unintimidated by a woman’s success. This adds legitimacy to Musgrave’s emphasis on the switch from a supporting partner to an insecure one in a relationship. 
It is unfortunate that this is our current reality. However, it is what is to be expected in a society where men are groomed to be the breadwinners while women are expected to be the caretakers. Therefore, on this point, I agree with Musgraves wholeheartedly. Despite believing that he will be able to handle a relationship with a more successful woman, some men are bound to feel insecure when they realize that they hold less power in a relationship because society teaches them that this is against the “natural” order. 
Therein lies the paradox of the family-oriented woman. While she might want to be a successful CEO making over seven figures, she must wrestle with the fact that this could ruin the chance of having the “ideal family” she may have always wanted. In reality, it seems almost impossible for women to have it all, and for now, “Breadwinner” accurately describes what a powerful woman is likely to experience if she enters a relationship with a man arguably less successful than her.
As accurate as Musgraves’ description of a relationship with a female breadwinner is, it is unfortunate that this is the reality that successful women must face. However, given the current progression of society in terms of attitudes towards underrepresented groups, there is some hope that women will be able to have it all without having to traverse the land mine that comes with being the more powerful one in a relationship. I am hopeful that the future will effectively make the situation Musgrave describes a forgotten remnant of the past.

I’m tired of being skeptical.
As someone who cares about journalism and thinks of it as a possible career path, the structure of news media consistently frustrates me. The main purpose of news outlets should be to inform the public and to be the watchdog. Instead of news outlets being on the side of “the people,” modern media bias seems to be inescapable. I think more frustrating than partisanship in the media is the fact that most media outlets are inextricably tied down to their audiences: in other words, who clicks, who pays. Major news outlets might have concurrent goals of watchdog, investigative, or nonpartisan journalism, but at the end of the day, many are for-profit companies who think about what will get people to tune into their channel or click on their articles. So news agencies will tailor and cherry-pick what topics and events to cover, how much they cover them, and what kind of spin they put on it by the news diet makeup of their audience. 
In a 2019 special report, the "Columbia Journalism Review" published an article speaking about media complacency in the face of the climate crisis, how “The brutal demands of ratings and money work against adequate coverage of the biggest story of our time.” Pew Research Center did a study of news media coverage of Biden’s first 100 days and found that people who got news from outlets with right-leaning audiences “were more likely to say they had heard a lot about Biden’s use of executive orders (79 percent),” which was “nearly twice … those who turn only to left-leaning audiences (42 percent).”
To have such a large discrepancy between what gets covered and what information gets disseminated is concerning. There will always be a risk of bias in the media (as journalists are human beings), and all consumers of news should have multiple sources of information no matter the topic. But the fact of the matter is, sometimes there is just not enough time in the day for every American across the U.S. to cross-reference every story that appears before their eyes. To have people reading one news outlet’s news pieces — not op-eds — form a completely different idea of events and political figures seems like a major deficit in our news delivery system. 
It also risks complacency. News burnout has become more prevalent given today’s high-speed modes of delivery, and it is easy to feel overwhelmed and bombarded with news from every corner of the country. Still, it cannot undermine the healthy skepticism one should regard our political figures with. Another finding of the Pew study was that only 16 percent of Americans who only follow left-leaning news sources closely follow news about the Biden administration, making them the group least likely to do so. Meanwhile, those who only follow right-leaning sources were twice as likely at 30 percent. 
It is easy to fall into tunnel vision with today’s media. Especially with social media on the scene, I am concerned we are accelerating towards a larger scale version of TikTok’s “for you page” algorithm: not only does partisan reporting breed partisan readership, but partisan readership also breeds partisan reporting. And if you are not actively questioning the ulterior motives or underlying ideologies of sources, the articles you intake will shape your political beliefs instead of you shaping your beliefs based on events that happen. 
Still, it is tiring to have that skepticism all the time.

Imagine that one day you wake up in a series of survival games that never seem to end, where even one mistake can lead to not only your in-game elimination but also your real death. Where in your fight to survive and return to the real world, you make friends and enemies, experience love and betrayal, and confront death and your fear of it many, many times.
This is essentially the overarching idea of “Squid Game,” a nine-episode Korean Netflix series that blazed across the globe after its release on Sept. 17. But what you may not know is that these are the core themes of a genre popular in the Eastern world called infinite flow.
I'll be honest, I'm more familiar with the infinite flow genre in the context of Chinese novels, and I was fairly surprised when I heard about “Squid Game”; I had no idea that the infinite flow genre could also be found in Korean culture. In any case, most of my commentary will be coming from a more Chinese novel context.
First an explanation of the term: infinite flow is called wu xian liu (无限流) in Chinese. The term also can be translated as infinite stream, unlimited flow, infinite horror, etc. According to Baike Baidu (which is basically Chinese Wikipedia so perhaps not the most trustworthy, but anyways) it was popularized by 2007 novel "无限恐怖," which can be translated as "Infinite Horror" or "Unlimited Terror."
True to its name, infinite flow is characterized by a seemingly never-ending flow of survival games, puzzles, or entire worlds, in which if you survive all of them, you can return to the real world or retrieve a reward that you desire. However, if you fail any one of the games, you are killed. There are also other deadly elements in-game, ranging from traps to guards to monsters. The genre often pits humans against each other and requires a combination of strength, wits, and sometimes even morality and humility to succeed.
It's a fascinating genre that has not really had an exact equivalent in the Western world, or at least not one nearly as popular as “Squid Game.” Sure, it could be argued that this is simply a variation of the survival game genre that would include series like “Hunger Games.” It is also true that many of the terror and horror aspects are quite similar. “Squid Game” creator Hwang Dong-hyuk said in an interview with "Variety" that he was inspired by Japanese manga "Battle Royale" and "Liar Game," which were released years before the aforementioned "Infinite Horror" novel and are similar in nature. However, they tend to also be classified as battle royale and survival games rather than infinite flow, and "Squid Game" could be argued to be the same.
Regardless, what I think makes infinite flow such a compelling genre unique from others is that it naturally brings elements that tend to hook audiences onto a show to the table. For one, it is naturally episodic, as there must be a series of worlds for the protagonist to go through. Because each "world" or game requires a heavy amount of staging and world-building, each episode or arc feels very different. "Squid Game" contains only six games in the course of its nine episodes, but there are definitely novels with many more than six games, such as one called “Card Room,” in which each game, or room, corresponds to each card of a standard deck, leading to at least 52 rooms. There is also a guaranteed overarching plot, as the protagonist has to be able to get to the end of the survival games and return to the real world.
It also brings a host of very interesting characters to the table, as not only do you need a huge number of people in order to play the games, desperate times call for desperate measures, and the prospect of dying brings out the worst in people. While normal survival game media also have similar tropes, infinite flow is also able to force characters into a much wider variety of situations, accentuating different strengths and weaknesses of characters in each situation. For example, in situations where teamwork is allowed, you might find a couple grow closer together, but in the next arc, where it becomes every person for themselves, you might find that the first thing that same couple does is knife each other. You might find that the person who ruthlessly sacrificed people who weren't their teammates is eventually sacrificed by their own teammate who they protected and trusted. 
It's endlessly exciting, with so many forms and variations. Even after reading so many novels in this genre, each novel feels so new and full of the author's perspectives on life, human behavior, and all sorts of commentary on our world. I'm always trying to crack puzzles, analyze the reasons behind each person's behavior, and piece together the bits of clues that signal the true purpose of the games. I'm glad that “Squid Game” has caught on in Western media and throughout the world, and I'm excited to see the new shapes the infinite flow genre will take.

Steven Donziger is an American attorney that has been locked in a legal battle for almost 30 years, fighting for the Ecuadorian people against the company that created unfathomable pollution in the Amazon Basin. He has been under house arrest since Aug. 2019. He has just been sentenced to six months in prison. He has pledged to continue to fight, but despite all the support behind him, he will almost certainly lose. How did this happen?
In the mid-1970s, Texaco began heavy-duty drilling operations in Ecuador. This caused heavy ecological damage, and created what is now known as the “Amazon Chernobyl,” a 1700 square mile disaster zone in the Lago Agrio oil field. Texaco admitted that they deliberately discharged tens of billions of liters of toxic waste and oil into the environment, and told the Indigenous members of the community living there that the oil wastes were medicinal. All this has been shown to have caused numerous health problems, including an estimated thousands of excess cancer deaths. The waste has devastated the ability of the indigenous tribes to live off their land and has killed many animals. The irreparable damage caused in this region is still felt today and continues to kill people. Multiple peer-reviewed studies have found an increased incidence of cancer and other health risks in the area, while a Chevron-funded study denies this claim. 
Steven Donziger, a reputable journalist and lawyer, was asked to help in 1993 and brought a class-action lawsuit to Texaco on behalf of the Indigenous people. This lawsuit was then filed in New York, a decision that made sense at the time but would cause loads of trouble. In 2001, Chevron bought Texaco, and the twists to this story began to appear. Chevron refused to have the trial be held in America and managed to get the case moved to Ecuador, under the condition that they would accept whatever decision the Ecuadorian courts ruled out. Chevron lawyers claimed they wanted this move because in Ecuador courts are “impartial and fair,” a claim that they then proceeded to contradict. Finally, in 2011, after almost 20 years of work, Chevron was found guilty and ordered to pay $18 billion in damages. They were able to appeal this number down to $9.5 billion, but even then this would still be a monumental victory for the Ecuadorian people. However, Chevron refused to pay and moved all their assets out of the country, forcing plaintiffs to appeal to other countries for aid. So far, the plaintiffs have received absolutely none of the money from Chevron, and most likely never will. Chevron seems to have won, but not content with winning, they have attempted to use their resources and influences to crush everyone involved.
Concurrently, Chevron has been working on a new strategy. Since 2009, they have been working on primarily demonizing and discrediting Donziger, as shown in released internal memos. They are trying to destroy him, and with their market cap of $210 billion, they have the funds to pursue this as long as they want. In 2011, Chevron filed a civil suit accusing Donziger of bribing an Ecuadorian judge and faking scientific studies. The judge they claimed Donziger bribed, Alberto Guerra, was being paid a monthly salary of $12,000 by Chevron and later admitted to having completely lied, and that Donziger and his associates never bribed him. This suit would have required a trial by jury, but Chevron changed its demands to allow the case to be tried solely by a judge. Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, a man with investments in Chevron and former tobacco lawyer, was to be that judge.
The case was decided based on Guerra’s testimony. Despite Guerra admitting to having lied about the bribery, Kaplan still insists that he told the truth and that Steven Donziger ghost wrote the judgment from the trial. On the subject, he said that "Guerra on many occasions has acted deceitfully and broken the law […] but that does not necessarily mean that it should be disregarded wholesale." 
When Donziger refused to surrender his computer, cellphone, and passwords to Chevron, Kaplan held him in civil contempt. He then personally filed criminal contempt charges against Donziger. He appointed the private law firm Seward and Kissel to act as government prosecutors against Donziger. Chevron had previously been a client of Seward and Kissel, a fact that neither Kaplan nor Chevron disclosed. Kaplan then personally chose District Judge Loretta Preska to preside over the trial, bypassing local rules in an unprecedented move. 
Donziger was denied his request for a jury trial, denied access to a public trial, and was shown total contempt from Judge Preska while United Nations experts decried his situation as a violation of international human rights law. Unsurprisingly, Donziger was found guilty of six counts of criminal contempt but will appeal the decision. 
This entire case is completely tragic, and I encourage everyone to inform themselves further on the issues. The story goes even deeper than what I have written here. For example, I completely glossed over the fake clean-up operation done by Texaco, as well as the numerous other law and PR firms hired to slander and threaten Ecuadorian workers. This case is a clear example of how our justice system can be exploited by corporations and how the vestiges of American Imperialism still run deep. How can we expect our justice system to work for us in the future when it is so clearly being exploited right now?

It has become a common punchline amongst Dietrich students that Carnegie Mellon is a school that consistently overlooks the humanities. Many on the editorial board here at The Tartan are composed of humanities majors, as are many of the editorial staff and writers. This punchline rang true again when blockchain pioneer Thomas Hoskinson donated $20 million to establish a center for formal mathematics … inside Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences. 
At Carnegie Mellon, there is consistent chatter about the importance of interdisciplinary research. It’s why statistics and information systems reside in the humanities department. According to the press release and Dean Richard Schienes’ statement, the department of philosophy will also play a significant role in the development of the formal mathematics center. 
But for the majority of humanities students, that $20 million will not be relevant for their needs. Instead, it shows that in the pursuit of interdisciplinary skills at Carnegie Mellon, pure humanities is being sidelined. It is the latest action taken by the university that only further cements Carnegie Mellon’s perception of being a STEM-focused institution. 
The modern job market has fundamentally changed. Coding and data skills are valuable to modern firms. The nature of focusing on interdisciplinary skills is to cater to this modern demand. But in this process, the humanities side of the interdisciplinary skills gets overshadowed. The general perception amongst humanities students is if you don’t have those data and coding skills, then you simply won’t get a job. 
It’s unclear whether this cycle is perpetuated by universities like Carnegie Mellon or if it is perpetuated by employers. It is likely both. Clearly, employers come to universities like Carnegie Mellon to find coders, engineers, scientists, mathematicians, and data analysts. Consequently, every job fair that Carnegie Mellon has focuses on this. Additionally, career help for humanities is very limited in comparison to that of STEM students. 
Dietrich students are often left in the dust, forced to adapt to the demands of these job opportunities and help themselves rather than being provided with the resources to succeed. As a result, there are many students forced to pivot away from their humanities base to find work. But perhaps this may just be the reality of the situation that we have to contend with. Finding work is getting more competitive, and the only way to compete is to adapt. 
Not only is this seen on the part of Carnegie Mellon’s monetary focus and the needs of employers, but also among students themselves who worry about the viability of getting a job in the humanities. Carnegie Mellon constantly brags about its high average salary after graduation, but it is an open secret that that is reserved for the computer scientists, engineers, and business people and especially excludes the non-pre-law humanities students. This is exemplified even visually on campus as STEM students frequent newly renovated buildings like Gates and Tepper while humanities students are stuck in the almost-factory environment of Baker and Porter. It is painfully obvious where the money and effort is on the part of the university.
It is saddening as humanities subjects are so incredibly valuable in pretty much everyone’s lives. Understanding concepts like how to communicate, the basis of the media we consume, or our individual and collective histories are fundamental to functioning and progressing forward in our society. It is time that we, not just as a university, but as a society stop overlooking the humanities and work towards a legitimately interdisciplinary educational experience that includes real value being placed upon the study and practice of the humanities.
Yet as much as we want this to be true, the reality of the situation may not provide for that. Perhaps the university can’t do much because they are constrained by a job market demand that caters to STEM skills more than it does to humanities skills. If this is the case, then the interdisciplinary focus is even more critical for humanities students. Regardless, the university must provide more support to their humanities students so that they are not left behind.
