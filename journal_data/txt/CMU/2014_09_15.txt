On Friday, the women’s Carnegie Mellon soccer team hosted Washington & Jefferson College and continued their undefeated season with a 6–2 scoring explosion. The goal outburst began with senior forward Savina Reid scoring her sixth goal through the first five games of the team’s season in the 21st minute on an assist by junior forward Alli McGugan. 
Senior midfielder Jordyn Greenberg quickly put the Tartans up by two with her goal in the 28th minute. Greenberg tipped a header in off of the post and turned the miss by first-year midfielder Tori Iatarola into a goal for Carnegie Mellon. Just before halftime, the Tartans extended the lead once again, this time with first-year midfielder Morgan Kontor finding the back of the net on a shot within the 18, following assists by first-year forward Grant Wilmer and Greenberg.
Coming out of halftime, the Tartans played even hotter than before, scoring two more goals within the first eight minutes coming out of the half. The first goal came in the 49th minute with Reid’s second goal of the game, this time on a header off of a cross by sophomore forward Megan Bartoshuk. Then in the 53rd minute, the Tartans went up by a commanding 5–0 lead on a near perfect reversal of the previous goal, with Bartoshuk scoring off of a cross into the box by Reid.
After managing only one shot on goal through the first half, Washington & Jefferson started pushing back as the Tartans rested their starters and took their foot off the pedal. They scored two goals over a 10-minute span between the 60th and 70th minute as they continually pushed the Carnegie Mellon defense with long balls and aggressive play.
With the lead cut to 5–2, sophomore midfielder and defender Delanely Lam scored the final goal in the 71st minute on a direct free kick into the top center of the net.
The Tartans also played at Capital on Sunday afternoon and continued their streak, winning 1–0.

Two goals on either end of the half pushed Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer to an impressive 3–0 win over Allegheny College on Saturday to pull their record for the season to an even 3–3. 
The score misrepresents a game that felt close throughout, and the shot count was nearly even. Carnegie Mellon was generating far better chances, though, and the Allegheny keeper was consistently working, while Allegheny only managed two shots within the frame.
Carnegie Mellon’s first close call came midway through the second half as junior midfielder Connor Webb put a shot off the goalpost. 
Carnegie Mellon’s pressure on the goal finally paid off as the half drew to a close when sophomore midfielder Devin Keane’s free kick led to some confusion in the box. Though the shot was unsuccessful, the team managed to turn it around to work for them.
Freshman forward Ryan Stinebaugh caused an Alegheny defender to panic and deflect the ball into his own net. The goal capped off a solid half from Carnegie Mellon where Allegheny was unable to generate much pressure on Carnegie Mellon’s net.
The second half started quickly for Carnegie Mellon as Webb’s shot just two minutes into the half was saved but not secured, and Stinebaugh drove home the rebound to open up some breathing room. 
With the half drawing to a close, Webb sealed the game after receiving a ball from senior defenseman Jakob Rohwer and setting himself up for Carnegie Mellon’s third goal of the afternoon. 
The pressure put on by Allegheny in the second half was turned away by two excellent saves from junior goalkeeper Eric Bykowsky to keep a clean sheet in the match. 
None of the 10 shots that were made by the team succeeded.
Overall, the Allegheny team committed 18 fouls on the field, while Carnegie Mellon checked in with only 11.
Carnegie Mellon’s season continues when Washington and Jefferson College comes to Pittsburgh on Wednesday evening. The game will begin at 7:00 p.m.

Women’s Volleyball
The Carnegie Mellon University volleyball team had a busy week, playing three games. They hosted Saint Vincent College on Tuesday and breezed to any easy straight set victory. Carnegie Mellon won the first set 25–21 and dominated the second set 25–14. The Bearcats made it a contest in the third set, keeping it close until the very end when Carnegie Mellon pulled out the 25–22 set win. First-year outside hitter Heather Holton led the Tartans with 10 kills in the match, followed by senior right setter Ali Celentano, who had nine kills.
On Saturday, the Tartans played two matches at the Bethany College Quad. Unfortunately, Carnegie Mellon had an off day and lost their first two matches of the season. The Tartans lost both matches in straight sets 3–0. In the first match against Thomas More College, the team came out slow dropping the first two sets 25–14 and 25–12 before putting up a fight in the third set, only to lose 25–21.
In the second game of the double header against Bethany, the Tartans looked less like the undefeated team they were becoming, losing 25–22 and 25–23 in the first two sets and pushing the third set into tiebreak points before falling 27–25.
Sophomore middle blocker/outside hitter Casey Salandra’s 10 kills were one of the few high points for the Tartans in the second game along with sophomore defensive setter Molly Higgins’s 21 digs.
The Tartans will play again next Wednesday when they travel to Marietta College.
Men’s and Women’s Cross Country
On Friday, the Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s cross country teams competed at the Slippery Rock University Invitational, with each squad placing second.
Senior George Degen led the men with his third place finish in a time of 26:15.03, followed up closely by sophomore Ryan Archer in fourth place, crossing the line at the 26:34.91 minute mark.
The next five runners for the Tartans finished in a bunch among the top 12 with senior Joshua Antonson, first-year Ryan Auld, junior Marc-Daniel Julien, sophomore Curtis Watro, and junior Brian Bollens finishing eighth, ninth, 10th, 11th, and 12th respectively, all of them crossing the line between 26:56.86 and 27:18.17.
On the women’s side, junior Elizabeth Snyder placed second overall with a time of 22:57.88.
In a similar fashion to the men’s team, the next set of runners was clumped together, this time between 13th and 19th place with random Slippery Rock and Mansfield University of Pennsylvania runners caught in the middle. Junior Taylor Maggiacomo, senior Erin Kiekhaefer, junior Priya Patel, senior Hailey Brown, and junior Haley Bryant all finished between 24:26.23 and 24:44.01 in the listed order.
Both Tartan teams race next Saturday at Dickinson College.
Women’s Golf
The inaugural season for the Carnegie Mellon women’s golf team had another first on Tuesday as the team won its first ever tournament as an official NCAA team.
Playing at the Grove City College Women’s Golf Fall Invitational, first-years Summer Kitahara and Robin Tan took first and second overall, shooting 79 and 80, respectively. Fellow first-years Emma Hoskins and Isabelle Tseng rounded out the team, placing sixth and 19th while shooting 86 and 100, respectively.
On Saturday, the Tartans won their second straight tournament, winning the Thiel College Invitational with a combined team score of 341.
Once again Kitahara and Tan took first and second overall, this time with a 77 for Kitahara and another 80 for Tan. Hoskins shot a 88 this time, and first-year Diana Zhou played as part of the team after entering the previous tournament as an individual, shooting a 96.
Carnegie Mellon will next tee off Tuesday at the Saint Vincent Invitational.
Men’s Golf
On Sunday and Monday of last week, the Carnegie Mellon men’s golf team competed in the Hal Hansen Invitational.
The Tartans placed sixth overall on the 72 course, shooting a 298 on the first day and a 309 on the second for a combined 607.
Senior Justin Fischler placed the highest individually, with a seventh place finish and a 148 between the two days. Senior Cameron Low and sophomore Jordan Klodowski tied for 16th with a 151. Sophomore George Qian rounded out the scoring team with a 158 across the two days.
The Tartans started competing on Sunday in the Guy W. Kuhn Invitational, finishing up the two-day tournament on Monday.

Over the past few weeks, the NFL has revealed how truly out of touch the league office is with the world outside of football. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell went on a rampage of four-game PED suspensions, taking a quarter of a season away from around 20 players who may have been trying to gain a physical edge in an extremely physical sport. 2013’s breakout star, Cleveland Browns’ wide receiver Josh Gordon received a full season suspension for failing a marijuana test so narrowly that military guidelines would have let him walk.
Yet, of the 38 players suspended, the shortest suspension somehow belonged to Baltimore Ravens running back, Ray Rice, who was caught on video dragging his then-fiancée’s unconscious body from a casino elevator in Atlantic City.
On Monday, after a new, disturbing video was released on TMZ and subsequently played on an endless loop on ESPN, MSNBC, and other networks who have no problem exploiting this situation for viewers, the NFL suspended Ray Rice indefinitely and his contract with the Baltimore Ravens was terminated. 
However, the league’s delayed drop of the hammer masks a far more disturbing timeline.
The release of the first video was regarded with widespread and justified outrage. The league has a history of protecting domestic abusers on the grounds that they did not have enough evidence to make a decision. 
But this was clear, visible proof that a player had physically assaulted a woman in public. 
The NFL would have to act swiftly and forcefully and send the message that the NFL does not stand for violence against women.
After weeks of waiting on litigation to run its course, the NFL’s initial judgment was that a two-game suspension was appropriate. 
Everyone watching was in shock. Many, including ESPN’s Keith Olbermann, claimed Goodell should resign after the embarrassingly weak response.
A large portion of football’s fan base, on the other hand, had the opposite reaction.
A look at the comments on ESPN articles and online football forums reveal that many in the football community were appalled that the league acted at all. 
A subset of football fans lamented the emasculation of society and wondered what they had left once football was taken away.
Football has always been regarded as something of a violent fantasy land, where super humans in helmets destroy each other and manifest systems of physical dominance, and the heroes are the “manliest,” those who impose themselves with the most force and brutality. 
For football to condemn violence against women, for many fans, was the last bastion of male power and unadulterated aggression finally softening up under the weight of the political correctness movement. Worse, they blamed Rice’s then-fiancée for provoking him and causing him to lose games and, as a result, money.
This mentality is terrifying. As much as people love the old cliché that it’s “just a game,” the NFL is a viewing experience in which we get to see the personal decisions each individual makes and the extreme ramifications that each choice has. 
A momentary lapse or mistake could be worth millions of dollars for a player, or at an emotional level, could make a player feel publicly humiliated. 
The fact that fans brush football off as just a game and desire for players to be given either more or less freedom than any other American citizen reveals a very unsettling culture among football fans. Brian Phillips, a staffwriter for the blog Grantland, wrote an excellent article about that particular point. 
This becomes even scarier when fans want the people around NFL players to suffer as well.
These are real people who do not live in an alternate universe where imposing pain on other humans is a good thing. Rice viciously assaulted his then-fiancée and now, thanks to the TMZ video, everyone has seen the haunting incident with their own eyes. 
A huge portion of the community of fans rallied to defend Rice from his two-game suspension, and the message was loud and clear. NFL: Not For Ladies. 
Many who populate online NFL forums determined that, by being near a football player, a woman was subjecting herself to the violent fantasies of NFL fans and her mere existence in the center of this —which was entirely not her fault or what she wanted — made her an enemy of manliness in American culture, depicted in the boundless violence of the NFL.
This is not even the first time this happened. Decades ago, Cleveland Browns running back Jim Brown, a very charismatic and popular player like Ray Rice, was accused of sexual assault, and later of throwing a woman from a balcony. The NFL defended him, and they have defended employees who have committed violent acts against women ever since. The unsettling precedent shows just how deep this problem runs in the NFL.
As previously mentioned, the more complete and disturbing images of Rice have forced the NFL’s hand. The NFL has instituted a new and somewhat harsher domestic violence policy, but the damage has been done. 
The NFL proved it was only willing to act on domestic violence when it became a major national story. 
A loud subset of fans proved that violence — not athletic prowess — is at the heart of America’s love for football and that such a culture lends itself to bitter misogyny.
Carolina Panthers’ defensive end Greg Hardy was convicted of throwing his girlfriend on a pile of guns while threatening to kill her. San Francisco 49ers’ defensive end Ray McDonald was recently arrested for domestic violence. Hardy is playing while his appeal is reviewed. McDonald is playing until his trial occurs.
This problem is only coming to light now, but it’s clearly not going away any time soon. I’m not sure how much longer I can keep supporting this league’s product.

Quick: How many of the things you interact with daily are connected to the Internet? Probably a smartphone and maybe a smart watch or an activity monitor wristband. 
How about in your home? A computer, TV, game console, or even a coffee maker that can download different recipes for your coffee in the morning.
Chad Jones, an entrepreneur, an angel investor, and an adviser to multiple startups, gave a human-computer interaction seminar lecture last Wednesday in Newell-Simon Hall 1305, titled “Transforming Human Interaction with our World Through the Internet of Things.” 
In the lecture, he addressed the transformation of how we discover, sense, and interact with the physical world through the Internet of Things, the idea that we are moving toward a world where all physical objects will run software that is connected to the Internet.
Jones opened his lecture by calling the Internet of Things “the next great paradigm shift not only in technology, but mankind as well.” He summarized how the evolution of the Internet occurred. Before 2000, about 1.8 billion computers were connected with each other. Then, in the mid 2000s, over 10 billion devices were connected to the Internet, mainly due to the emergence of mobile devices. 
But the next evolution is already happening, where “everything” is connecting to the Internet, with an estimate of 1 trillion connections to the Internet by 2030. 
This growth of Internet-connected devices has led to the Internet of Things, the concept that any device with an On/Off switch connects to the Internet directly, or indirectly through another device.
Jones said that we are already seeing examples of this evolution in different areas, and opportunities are everywhere. It is not a question of “where [we] can apply this, [but] a question [of] where we cannot,” Jones said. He showed examples of where these devices already exist, from a smart thermostat like Nest in the home that knows when you are home and adjusts the temperature automatically based on your preferences, to things like a basketball with a motion sensor that can tell how good your dribble is.
He also shared an example of an everyday object that is all over the world. There are over 1 billion street lamps in the world that today only light up our streets at night. But Jones stated that a “street lamp can become a platform and provide a lot more than just light.” The lamp can serve as a Wi-Fi hotspot, provide announcements, and serve as digital signage that can advertise nearby events or provide directions.
The street lamp is just one of many ways we can make cities smarter where devices connected to the Internet can provide useful information to everyone. For example, Internet-connected parking meters can help drivers find the closest available parking lot. Underground water pipes could alert the city if there are any stresses in the system and prevent a possible leakage from shutting down parts of the city.
So what has led to this evolution and why now? Jones said that this evolution has been the result of trends in technology and business. Electronics such as computer chips, sensors, and batteries are getting smaller and smaller, and can be placed in smaller devices. More devices have sensors and are able to share their data with other devices through cloud computing. 
It is much cheaper to produce the electronics in these devices and the devices themselves, thus allowing them to become “smarter.” Jones stated that though sensors in devices and electronics have existed for decades, it’s “the Internet that has tied everything together.” Having the ability to share the data generated by the sensors in devices is what makes them “smart” and creates the Internet of Things.
A good example of how the Internet of Things can be useful is a problem that a lot of people face during winter storms. Jones shared that, in his hometown of Boston, two days before a major winter storm hits, people using oil tanks to warm their houses call oil companies to fill their tanks, which leads to an increased demand for technicians to go to each house and fill up the tanks, even if the tanks were already 90 percent filled. These oil tanks already have sensors to determine how much the tank is filled. However, these tanks can now be connected to the Internet and have the potential to share the amount of oil left in the tank and how long it takes for the whole tank to be used up, which would allow the oil company to know which houses need the oil first.
Having connected smart devices would improve a lot of aspects of life, from simple things like getting directions from a street lamp to letting an oil company know when to fill up an oil tank. Though useful, the Internet of Things also brings concern about the privacy of the data generated by these devices and how they are shared. Jones said “there is a lot of opt-in” where the user is asked to have their data shared. But he added that it is far “scarier where the government comes in, hijacks [our data], and uses it to monitor us.” 
He also added that businesses have to be more careful in how devices are created. He shared an example of how a baby monitor was hacked and used to wake up a 10-month old baby by yelling “Wake up.” The hacker was able to get that baby monitor’s information from Shodan, a search engine that indexes publicly accessible Internet-connected devices.
Having access to already available data from our world gives us more context and provides more valuable information, which transforms how we as humans discover and interact in the world.

Learning new skills and acquiring knowledge is essential to the growth and development of modern society, but there is still uncertainty regarding the biological mechanisms behind this occurrence. 
Recent findings by researchers at the joint Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC) suggest that it is easier to learn new skills if people can associate them with skills they already have.
The researchers include Carnegie Mellon’s Byron Yu, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering and biomedical engineering; Steven Chase, an assistant professor of biomedical engineering with a courtesy appointment in electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon and researcher at the CNBC; as well as University of Pittsburgh researcher Patrick Sadtler, a bioengineering Ph.D. candidate. 
The team is also comprised of Carnegie Mellon’s Matthew Golub, Stanford University’s Stephen Ryu, and University of Pittsburgh’s Aaron Batista, Elizabeth Tyler-Kabara, and Kristin Quick.
The team used brain computer interfaces (BCIs) to translate neural activity into something more easily defined, Chase explained.
“BCIs take neural activity and map it directly to something else. It’s often a robotic arm, but in this case it was a computer cursor,” Chase said. Animal subjects were trained to move a computer cursor to targets on a screen while the researchers monitored their motor cortex, the section of the brain responsible for voluntary movements.
The movement of the cursor to the target required the subjects to produce specific patterns of neural activity. If the subjects were able to efficiently move the cursor, it signaled that they had produced the correct neural activity pattern.
“We designed mapping between neuron activity and cursor movement that would either take existing patterns in neural activity and use them in new ways to drive the cursor in different directions or generate new patterns of neural activity that had never been used before,” Chase said. “The whole goal of the experiment was to try to make a prediction about what sorts of things are learnable and what sorts of things are not.”
The research showed that certain neural activity patterns were easier than others for subjects to learn. Subjects generally had an easier time learning patterns that were comprised of pre-existing patterns. Patterns consisting of totally new patterns were much harder for subjects to learn.
“You can change existing patterns and map them to cursor movement,” explained Chase. “What you can’t do is generate new patterns — or at least you can’t do it very quickly.”
The possible applications of this research are extensive, including improved motor learning rehabilitation and more efficient, functional BCIs. Chase explained that motor learning is a topic that necessitates further study.
“Motor learning is one of those big open questions in neuroscience research; we really don’t understand what it is and how it occurs,” Chase said. 
“We normally don’t think about motor control very much because we’re extremely good at it, but when it goes wrong it’s devastating.”
Spinal cord injury, stroke, and Parkinson’s disease are all widespread afflictions associated with faulty motor control. “Stroke is an instance where we hope that we will be able to learn to overcome whatever deficits there are. It’s a question of learning, and if we knew the right way to derive the learning, we could help people recover from strokes better,” Chase said.
He further commented on the ability of interdisciplinary collaboration to prompt innovation. “This was a true collaborative project that brought together techniques from a bunch of different fields, including neurobiology, engineering, and machine learning,” Chase said. 
“The end goal of all of this research is to really understand motor learning at a fundamental level and take that information to perform stroke rehabilitation more effectively and design better BCIs for those who can’t communicate.”
The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Burroughs Wellcome Fund. The paper was published in the Aug. 28 issue of Nature.

Elon Musk, chief executive officer of SpaceX, believes he can land humans on Mars by 2026. Mars One, a nonprofit organization, wants to begin establishing a human colony on Mars in 2024. But don’t start planning your vacation to Mars just yet. Despite SpaceX’s goal to have reusable rockets, this feat has not yet been proven outside of tests. Meanwhile, the Mars One mission plans on having the colony’s members live their lives out on Mars. Now that life on Mars appears to be feasible within the coming decades, what are the consequences of sending people on a journey that might be one-way?
A manned mission to Mars has the potential to be extremely beneficial to the progress of science; it would be a litmus test to see how well technology can allow humans to live in harsh conditions and in extreme isolation, far from any immediate help. Unfortunately, we cannot rely on Earth to host humanity forever. Currently, human behavior is forcing Earth into a volatile state. There is also the chance that a meteor or other extraterrestrial disaster could destroy the planet. A manned mission to Mars could lead the way to potential colonization on a more massive scale — Mars could be the new home for humans.
However, the exploration and experimentation comes with a cost, particularly when travelers to Mars are not able to return. Pugwash raised the concern during its weekly meeting that sending humans to Mars could be unethical. For one, scientists and engineers do not know what to expect. Landing and setting up a successful, inhabitable living place on Mars is no small feat, and there is the possibility that a trip to Mars could lead to immediate death. One Pugwash member even said that choosing to live on Mars could be similar to choosing imminent death, almost like euthanasia.
Another concern is whether or not humans should alter the ecosystem on Mars. On Earth, we try to conserve many natural phenomena through the National Park Service. We must consider that our occupation of Mars would alter or destroy natural formations on Mars. We must weigh the importance of preserving nature when planning the missions to Mars.
In the end, a trip to Mars will always be a person’s choice. Yet, Pugwash was concerned about whether or not humans are informed enough to make that decision. It is difficult to create a completely informative and fair consent form. Giving people a choice could lead to corruption including misunderstandings, misinformation, and the potential of forced consent. Some Pugwash members were of the mindset that it would be wrong to deprive a person of travel to Mars if they had the capability of doing so and would otherwise be a prisoner on Earth. Finally, the group considered the possibility of travelers having Martian-born children. Do we subject these children to grow up in such a hazardous atmosphere? Although children are born and raised in poor conditions on Earth without choice, a naturally uninhabitable planet adds a new layer to the discussion.
In 10–20 years, it is likely that the technology to send humans to Mars will exist. Certain people will be asked to make the decision if they would like to inhabit another planet. Living on Mars has its benefits in terms of scientific progress, but we must consider if these unknown living conditions are ones we want to subject humans to.
Student Pugwash is a non-advocacy, educational organization that discusses the implications of science. This article is a summary of last week’s dicussion on one-way trips to Mars.

Apple’s Sept. 9 announcement event has come to a close, and the many features of the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, and Apple Watch are starting to sink in. Although many of the features, such as a new A8 chip and the high resolution of the new phones’ screens, have caused excitement, the inclusion of near field communication (NFC) into the next generation devices has the world abuzz. With Apple’s stamp of approval, many companies are starting to look at greater investments into the payment possibilities NFC holds.
So what exactly is near field communication? As you can probably guess, it involves interactions between devices that are close to each other. Closeness usually means a few centimeters away from another device, although some NFC chips necessitate contact to transfer or receive information.
There are two different types of NFC: active and passive. Active NFC, which is currently used on many Android devices, as well as the new Apple devices, can send and receive data. One major use of NFC is storing and transferring contact or credit card information. With apps such as Google Wallet on Android phones, you can simply tap your device to pay at stores.
Passive NFC, on the other hand, can only send data. However, passive NFC provides an extra benefit: The passive devices can run without power. You can find passive NFC on all sorts of devices that need to communicate with others. For example, our student ID cards use NFC technology. If you tap your card on the bus, your card is passively transferring information through NFC to the bus system’s active card reader, which allows the bus system to realize that you are a Carnegie Mellon student and charge the university for your trip. Billboards and signs can also use NFC. You can usually tap one of these with a phone to get more information about the topic discussed on the board.
NFC has many uses, but how does it work? According to the blog Android Authority, NFC is just another wireless transmission standard. But unlike Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, it is able to send information passively. It does this by using a process called electromagnetic induction. When an active NFC component comes near a passive component, the active component’s electromagnetic field causes small currents to flow through the passive part. The generated power allows the passive NFC to send data whenever the active part is nearby. Close proximities allow for a stronger electromagnetic field to affect the NFC, which is why most devices need to be so close to each other to transfer valuable information.
NFC has its own transmission frequency of 13.56 MHz. It also has a speed of anywhere from 100 to 450 kilobits per second. Although this means that you can’t transfer a full HD movie in a feasible amount of time, it is fast enough to transfer small amounts of data, such as contacts. 
The NFC standard has three different modes that it uses to operate: peer-to-peer, read/write, and card emulation. Peer-to-peer allows for two active tags to write to each other, whereas read/write is directed toward one device. Card emulation, on the other hand, allows a device to function like a passive device, which is how your phone can function as a wallet.
Although people argue for other data transfer methods, NFC provides near-instantaneous connection speeds and allows devices to transmit data passively. In addition, new methods such as Android Beam use NFC for faster transfer times. As NFC becomes more popular, we may even see new uses for it.

Google to make its own quantum processors
Google recently announced its plan to make quantum processors using superconductors. Google is already involved in quantum computer research through the Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab, whose members now run their experiments on a D-Wave Two device, the successor of D-Wave One and the world’s only commercially available quantum computer. 
Compared to traditional computers, quantum computers are believed to be helpful for optimization problems. In digital computers, data are encoded into binary digits (bits), which has two definite states (0 and 1), whereas quantum computation uses qubits that can be in superpositions of states. However, quantum computers haven’t yet proven to be faster than classical computers, partly because they are currently only in prototype stages. Thus, Google is still working with the lab researchers, including scientists from NASA and universities, to seek further improvement.

UN scientists claim that Earth’s protective but fragile ozone layer is gradually recovering, partly due to the reduction of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) use and international collaborations to wean away from CFCs. Since 1974, there have been warnings about ozone depletion, which can be devastating because of the ozone’s ability to shield damaging ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun. Excessive exposure to UV may lead to skin cancer. Interestingly, carbon dioxide, commonly known as a major greenhouse gas, is believed to cool the upper stratosphere, and the cooled air increases the amount of ozone. While this news is encouraging, scientists still warn that the ozone layer is far from being healed. 
The long-lasting, ozone-eating chemicals are still damaging the ozone levels while it is recovering. According to NASA scientist Paul A. Newman, the ozone layer is still approximately 6 percent thinner than it was in 1980.

NASA to give International Space Station 3-D printer
According to a recent plan, NASA will send a 3-D printer to the International Space Station (ISS), which, according to some engineers and researchers at NASA, is a “design revolution.” 
Traditionally, astronauts had to bring tools and parts in order to replace broken parts; but now with this 3-D printer, “if you have 300 different things that could break on your spacecraft, you may not need to carry replacement parts for all 300 of them,” said Dwayne Day, a senior program officer at the National Research Council. Having a 3-D printer may even allow astronauts to invent useful new tools while in space.
The 3-D printer was made to be resistant to drastic temperature change. However, the fact that heat flows differently in microgravity could mean that some parts of the plastic will become too hot or too cool for the printing to work properly. The printer was designed by Made In Space, a Silicon Valley venture.

Research reveals giant dinosaur lived in the water
Scientific detective work spanning 100 years and three continents has revealed the first swimming dinosaur: Spinosaurus aegyptiacus, an African monster that breaks the mold for how a dinosaur predator looked and behaved — it is even nine feet longer than the Tyrannosaurus rex (T. rex). Spinosaurus is known for its water-adapting lifestyle, and it was the only known quadrupedal dinosaur predator, compared to its two-legged counterparts, like T.rex.
Most of the information about Spinosaurus was lost during World War II, when fossils discovered earlier were destroyed in Germany. Recently, some partial skeletons were again found in Morroco, and an accurate reconstruction of Spinosaurus finally evolved. Spinosaurus had “powerful jaws and teeth.… It probably had outsized arms, with flashing scythe-like claws,” said Paul Sereno, one of the scientists who reported the find.

Mystery of missing lithium extends beyond Milky Way
It is universally believed that within three minutes of the Big Bang, the universe was created with mostly hydrogen and helium, with a certain amount of lithium (the first three elements in the periodic table). While the presence of the first two in our universe has been long confirmed, there seems to be only about one-third as much lithium in the old stars as there should be. For many years this problem troubled scientists, causing them to rethink whether the models of the early universe are accurate. Recently, it has been confirmed that this problem is not unique to the Milky Way. Astronomers turned the Very Large Telescope in Chile toward Messier 54 (M54), a distant start cluster that is part of a tiny galaxy. According to the observations published on Sept. 9, the problem of lithium is not just limited to the scope of the Milky Way, but some external galaxies as well. Thus, where the lithium goes remains a problem for current astronomy.

Apple smartwatch is Apple’s most personal device
Though not the first technology company making smartwatches and wearable technology, Apple unveiled its long-anticipated wearable smartwatch on Sept. 9. Apple CEO Tim Cook introduced the device, which is much like a wearable iPhone, but smaller. Cook hailed it as one of the most personal devices Apple has ever created: The Apple Watch can serve as a drawing pad, pulse monitor, music player, and an email receiver, among other things, that is always only an arm’s length away.
Instead of simply shrinking the iPhone screen, Cook claimed that Apple designed a new interface for the smartwatch, using what it calls a digital crown, or a knob on the side of the watch. 
Apple is also working closely with app developers to increase the functionality of its product with new uses.

Microwave cooking is so freshman year. After those two wonderfully naive and shiny semesters, life gets real, and so does the lack of food in your kitchen, if you’re lucky enough to get one on campus or decide to move off campus. You’re one year closer to being a real person, and part of that life is acknowledging that, yes, you too can cook.
So, without further depressing ado about how you probably aren’t on the meal plan anymore, here are some recipes that will make subsisting not only filling, but also delicious.
Summer Splunk, serves 2
This dish is named for the sound that the amazing vegetable stew makes as you plop it on top of a mountain of pasta — splunk. The beauty of this recipe is its variability. In the winter, substitute fresh veggies for frozen ones. They won’t be quite as delicious, but you’ll still be just as satisfied. To that end, if you don’t like one of the ingredients, change it! Trust your gut. It’s growling. Make sure to time your multitasking well — start the pasta when you start the onion. Then you’ll have a chance to drain and cool it before you add it.
1 white onion, chopped
2 cloves of garlic, chopped
2 zucchinis, sliced 
1 container of grape tomatoes, sliced in half
3 spicy Italian sausages, grilled and sliced
3 ears of fresh corn, off the cob
Fresh basil and thyme, to taste
Rosemary, to taste
Olive oil
Salt and pepper, to taste 
½ box of fettuccine, cooked and drained
Parmesan cheese
1) Saute the onion and garlic in the olive oil until the onions are limp and the garlic is browned. You should be able to smell the deliciousness.
2) Add the zucchini, stirring it in with the onion and garlic. Add salt, pepper, and any other spices (except the basil) that you’re using. (Hint: Oregano would be a great substitute.)
3) When the zucchini is cooked down (it’ll shrink as the moisture leaves it), add the tomatoes and corn. These vegetables take less time to cook. Add the basil, then taste your creation so far. If you think it needs more salt or pepper or anything else, add it! You’re in charge here.
4) Toss the sausage in and lower the heat. Let it all stew for a few minutes so the flavors mingle. Flavor mingling is essential.
5) Toss the drained and cooled pasta with olive oil and some salt. Put a generous serving on a plate.
6) Top that with a serving of the veggies, the cheese, and any remaining basil.
Not Your Momma’s Fried Rice, serves 2
Greasy fried rice is the ultimate guilty pleasure when the 2 a.m. munchies strike. The next time your mouth waters at the thought of the sticky rice and the salty sting of soy sauce, close the GrubHub tab on your browser and make your own. The key to a great fried rice is the rice. A sticky white rice makes for a perfectly textured final product. Use leftover rice from last night’s order to make yourself feel better about the fact that you’re eating at 2 a.m. in the first place.
1 cup of white rice, cooked 
1 bag of frozen veggies, defrosted so they won’t be watery and gross
Chicken, cooked (or tofu, or beef, or pork, or nothing if you aren’t feeling very protein-y)
2 eggs
Soy sauce
Sesame oil (if you don’t have it, don’t sweat it)
Lots of vegetable oil
Lots of salt
Red pepper flakes
Paprika
Ginger
1) Start by throwing some vegetable oil in a pan. Make it a big pan, though, because all of this is going in.
2) Cook the veggies in the oil, making sure that they’re not too watery going in. Watery veggies make for sad fried rice. Season them appropriately.
3) When the veggies start to brown and get crispy, add some sesame oil and soy sauce and let them fry in the oils for a bit. This frying is essential for flavoring the fried rice.
4) Add your protein of choice and lightly fry it with the veggies and oils. Add more seasoning if you think it needs it.
5) Add the rice to the pan and stir it around to mix everything in together. Keep stirring so nothing sticks to the pan and burns.
6) Make a hole in the middle and crack the eggs into it. Let them cook just until the whites are turning ... well, white, and then stir them into everything else. Make sure there’s an even coating and don’t forget to stir! Your tongue will thank you later.
7) When the egg-covered mixture of deliciousness is cooked, add a decent amount of soy sauce. I usually keep adding until everything has turned brown, but it depends on what you like! Add more spice here if desired.
8) Let the soy sauce cook into everything for about a minute, then take it off the heat. Consume and let the food coma begin.
Sweet Potato Salad, serves 4 as a side
This recipe is easy. And it’s vegan. It’s v-easy. Even if you love eating animal products, you’ll still fall head-over-heels for this substantial salad. With a nice baguette, this could easily become a cheap but impressive dinner for two. Moreover, it’s embarrassingly easy, super healthy, and pretty darn delicious. You literally cannot lose.
3 or 4 large sweet potatoes (or yams)
1 purple onion, chopped
2 avocados, diced
1 red pepper, diced
2 cans of black beans, drained
1 can of corn, drained
Olive oil, for drizzling
1 bunch of cilantro (unless you’re one of those people who is genetically predisposed to hating cilantro because it tastes like soap)
Salt and pepper to taste
1) The first thing you have to do is preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Don’t panic about the fact that you’re using the oven. It’s just for baking the potatoes. Stay with me.
2) Next, take a large, very sharp knife and slice the sweet potatoes or yams. The slices should be reasonably thick but not thick enough that they don’t cook. I usually eyeball it, but for those of you who need a measurement, I would say around 1/2 inch. But, again, don’t panic if they’re too big or too small. It’ll work out.
3) Toss the slices in some olive oil, then put them in a pan and roast them for about 20 minutes. Check them often to make sure they’re not burning to crisps. When they’re soft enough to be speared by a fork, take them out and set them aside to cool.
4) Chop, dice, and drain everything that needs to be chopped, diced, or drained. Combine all of the chopped, diced, or drained things in a large bowl and set it aside.
5) Now that your potatoes have cooled a little bit, dice them and add them to the bowl. Toss everything around so the colors mix up and it looks fun and festive. Add your salt and pepper until it tastes seasoned to you.
6) Chop some cilantro and sprinkle it on top to make it look fancy, like you know what you’re doing.
7) Set it on the table, admire, and pat yourself on the back for making something that gorgeous. Then make sure you turn the oven off.
Note: This recipe was inspired in part by a recipe found on audreysapron.wordpress.com.
One Last Bite of Wisdom 
There is little feeling more satisfying — or adult-like — than sitting down to a plateful of food that you just brought into existence with your own two hands, a few appliances, and a recipe. Not only did you create something, but now you get to stuff your face and Instagram a picture to make your friends jealous. Chances are, it’s healthier, cheaper, and more aesthetically pleasing than what they’re eating tonight.
Don’t be afraid to change things about recipes to make them taste better for you. You won’t ruin it — you’ll only make something new. Cooking isn’t about being right or wrong. It’s about finding what tastes good to you and sharing it with your friends and family.
Or keeping it for yourself, pigging out, and slipping slowly into a food coma as you realize just how amazing you are at life.

The Fault in Our Stars
8 p.m.
Based on the young adult novel of the same name by author and YouTube personality John Green, The Fault in Our Stars revolves around two teenagers who are smitten with each other after meeting in a cancer support group. Together they experience the phenomenon of falling in love while simultaneously staring death straight in the face. However, the script is written with a degree of levity not expected to be paired with a “cancer movie.” Shailene Woodley stars as Hazel Grace Lancaster, the female half of this ill-fated couple, and Ansel Elgort stars as the witty and charmingly upbeat Augustus Waters. Both actors deliver heart-wrenching and tear-jerking performances that require audience members to bring boxes of tissues. Anyway, acclaimed movie critic and historian Kim Kardashian tweeted, “This movie OMG it’s literally my new Notebook,” so how can you not go and see The Fault in Our Stars?”
Edge Of Tomorrow
8 p.m.
Finally, Tom Cruise in a role in which he doesn’t play someone who is smooth, confident, and an alpha male. Oh wait. Scratch that. Edge of Tomorrow, based on the Japanese novel All You Need Is Kill by Hiroshi Sakurazaka, is set in the near dystopian future where humans are at war with sinewy robotic aliens called Mimics. Although having little to no combat experience, Major William Cage (Tom Cruise) is thrown into battle on what appears to be a D-Day-esque battle. Cage slowly transforms from a meager soldier into a dynamic hero largely due to Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), an exceptional soldier and assassin. But here’s the twist: every time Cage is killed during battle, he wakes up again and appears to have traveled back into the past, giving him the opportunity to right his wrongs á la Groundhog Day. Edge of Tomorrow proves to stand out in the ever-expanding science fiction genre.

The VIA Festival is returning to Pittsburgh on Oct. 1–5, and it’s a pretty big deal. The event, which will be expanding to include events in Chicago this year, is one of the highlights of Pittsburgh’s cultural calendar and touts some of the most celebrated acts in independent music.
Spread out at different venues around the city, VIA is sure to get you hitting many of Pittsburgh’s greatest venues, cinemas, and more — maybe even the one and only Carnegie Mellon. Here are a few key artists and events that will prove that the cost of an all-access pass is totally worth it.
Real Estate
Oct. 1
Location: Altar Bar
As someone who grew up in New Jersey — actually in the next town over from the band members — I can attest that indie-surf band Real Estate sounds exactly like how it feels to grow up in Jersey. The guitars are dreamy and wistful, the rhythm section bounces along calmly and loosely, and the vocals wander off like a chain of thoughts while relaxing in a deck chair on a May afternoon.
Real Estate is an act not to be missed by fans of live indie music. With all confident players, the band’s songs sound as tight as they do on the record. If you’re standing in the crowd, just try closing your eyes and see if you don’t immediately feel transported back to those days when you were a teenager and you’d just gotten your license and you spent the entire afternoon driving around the neighborhood aimlessly only because you could. Real Estate has a way of doing that to people.
If you like Real Estate, other VIA performers to catch include Blue Hawaii, who will perform on Saturday, Oct. 4 at a yet-to-be-announced location, and Ellie Herring, who will be performing on Friday, Oct. 3 at Hot Mass on Penn Avenue. Blue Hawaii is a duo that make dreamy and chilled-out electronic pop, and Ellie Herring is an electronic producer who makes ethereal sounds in a style similar to more popular artists Odesza and Baths.
Diode Milliampere
Oct. 3 & 4
Location: Carnegie Mellon, TBA
Some people — and it must be awful to live inside such a narrow mind — believe that music can only be made with the types of instruments that have been available to humans for thousands of years. There are others, however, that believe that music’s definition doesn’t lie in its means, but rather in something else. Diode Milliampere is a perfect example of the latter.
Using outdated computer equipment and an MS-DOS (the Microsoft precursor to the Windows operating system) application called Adlib Tracker II, Milliampere is one of the rising stars of the chiptune scene. Given his ancient (at least in terms of a technological timeline) and digital methods, Milliampere’s music has a surprising amount of heart. Videos on his YouTube channel — including one of his ambient yet club-happy track “Aquarius” — give a peek into his unique songwriting process.
He will be giving a lecture discussing his work and methodology on Carnegie Mellon’s campus on Friday, Oct. 3 and performing on Saturday, Oct. 4.
If you like Diode Milliampere, other VIA performers to check out include L-Vis 1990 who will perform Saturday, Oct. 4 at a yet-to-be-announced location and Pittsburgh-based hip-hop producer Mr. Owl, who will perform Friday, Oct. 3 at Belvedere’s Ultra Dive on Butler Street. L-Vis 1990 is a London-based club producer that makes the kinds of songs that make you feel like you’re sticking your head out of the top of a stretch-limo while driving through a big city after having a few glasses of free champagne. Mr. Owl employs sinister, slithering bass and bouncing hip-hop drums to create beats that will give you goosebumps.
Cakes Da Killa
Oct. 4
Location: TBA
There are very few musical genres — dance and disco really being the only exceptions — that historically have been welcoming toward the LGBTQ community, and rap is certainly near the top of the list of offenders. That homophobia, thankfully, is beginning to lose its grip, and many of the most talented noisemakers in rap today have come up through the LGBTQ community. Cakes Da Killa, with his fierce personality, is certainly one of the most gripping faces of this emerging community.
Over EDM-inspired beats, Cakes Da Killa (Rashard Bradshaw) spits fast and furious rhymes with a large personality. Recent releases “You Ain’t Kno?” and “Naptime” feature booming 808 trap, while the older (five months) “I Run This Club” has the kind of throbbing bass that would be right at home in a Miami nightclub.
Cakes is very vocal about his sexuality as well, and it’s a welcoming change to hear the usual machismo and bravado in a new dress. 
Known for his wild and energetic performances, Cakes Da Killa is definitely a face at VIA that isn’t to be missed. He will be performing on Saturday, Oct. 4. 
If you like Cakes Da Killa, other VIA performers to check out include TT The Artist, who is performing Wednesday, Oct. 1 at Cattivo on 44th Street and Zebra Katz, who is performing Saturday, Oct. 4 at a yet-to-be-announced location. Both are unique and colorful up-and-coming rappers. TT The Artist also hosts The CW network’s “Keepin' It Real" TV show.
Undervolt & Co.
Oct. 4
Location: TBA
In addition to music, VIA will also feature visual artists. Of the many available, the big pop-up event on Saturday, Oct. 4 will be curated by Undervolt & Co., a label for experimental video artists. There will be a group lecture given at Carnegie Mellon followed by live visuals from Pittsburgh-based Undervolt artists Yoshi Sodeoka, Johnny Woods, MSHR, Sabrina Ratte, and JJ Stratford.
Check out the Undervolt website, undervolt.co, to get a sense of the kind of psychedelic-inspired videos created by the artists on the label.

Think you know the function of everyday objects like dressers, flyswatters, and taxidermy ducks? Think again — or, rather, look again.
The Carnegie Museum of Art’s latest exhibition, Sebastian Errazuriz: Look Again, invites visitors to re-imagine the way they think about the function and construction of objects they interact with daily.
The exhibit, which opened on Sept. 6 and is located in the Forum Gallery near the museum’s entrance and the Hall of Architecture, is an exercise in training the mind to assign new meaning or give multiple uses to items that people usually take for granted. The sole artist of the exhibit, Sebastian Errazuriz, asks visitors to challenge their expectations of the seemingly mundane in an unusual, yet exciting, collection of furniture installations and display pieces:
Magistral cabinet
Upon entering the Forum Gallery, visitors are confronted by a looming form fitted with 80,000 bamboo spikes covering its entire frame. The form, a Magistral cabinet, is not only meant to contain things, but guard them as well, according to the piece’s description. The spikes took six weeks and 12 team members to hammer into the cabinet, which was constructed of bamboo, glass, maple, and plywood in 2011. Through this piece, as well as an accompanying Explosion cabinet, Errazuriz questions how furniture should be constructed and invites visitors to look at them as not simply furniture.
The pieces form eye-catching centerpiece displays that are sure to pull viewers further into the gallery. The Explosion cabinet, completed in 2014, looks as if half of its wooden panels have been blasted into clean-cut pieces, but they are not totally separated from the rest of the cabinet, which remains a pristine rectangular shape. Magistral, on the other hand, has an imposing and intimidating, yet admirable quality about it. While it’s hard to brush aside the feeling that one could be mortally wounded while interacting with the cabinet, it is almost impossible not to want to touch the cabinet’s spikes and get to the drawers hidden behind them.
DIE and MIRACLE flyswatters
Among a shelf of household objects, including watches, a snow globe, and a salt and pepper shaker, stand two flyswatters enclosed in a glass case. One reads "DIE" and is covered completely in mesh to make a fly’s death certain. In contrast, the second flyswatter, called the "MIRACLE" flyswatter, contains an image of a cross. The cross is not covered in mesh, so that, in the event that a person swings at a fly, there is a chance that the fly will move through the void space that makes the cross. According to the piece’s description, the "DIE" flyswatter forces a person to consider the act of killing before they perform the act, while the "MIRACLE" flyswatter gives a fly the chance to live and leaves it up to the user as to whether or not they believe the fly survived by chance or miracle.
The flyswatters, created in 2011 and made of raulí wood, transform not only an everyday object, but also a mindless action into a deeply personal experience. The artist makes the viewer contemplate death and the chance life is given to continue living on Earth. Although the flyswatters are small in comparison to many of the larger installations of Look Again, they create a pair of objects more influential than most others in the exhibit.
El Santo
Next to a desk that forces those working at it to look at their reflection in a thin mirror sits a chair, called El Santo. Above the chair hangs a halo-shaped bulb. The piece, created in 2004 with lacquered wood, a fluorescent tube, and electrical parts, turns those who sit in it into saints. The piece is meant to question the nature of canonization and its possible arbitrariness, according to its description.
This seemingly simple piece is one that, beyond critiquing religion, brings attention to the notion that the titles and honors people give one another are simply titles and honors, while people can make themselves anything they want given the right tools and mindset.
Boat Coffin
Down the hall from the Forum Gallery, in the Hall of Architecture, stand a number of additional pieces of the exhibit. The installations in the hall include a motorcycle, a four-tabletop coffee table containing four nude portraits of the artist, a piano hanging from the ceiling, and the standout of the bunch, Boat Coffin. This piece is exactly what it claims to be: a cross between a boat and a coffin. The coffin is meant to give the owner a choice to face death head on. Owners of boat coffins can take themselves out to sea to die on their own terms, rather than waiting to die a possibly slow and uncomfortable death elsewhere.
The piece’s concept is less hard-hitting than the others in the exhibit, since the notion that humans have the choice to face death when they want has been explored many times. However, the piece stands out because of the alternative method it presents for an individual’s death journey. The coffin boat is a humorous concept, leaving one hard-pressed to find a more ridiculous way to end one’s life. The piece is constructed of a coffin, lacquered wood, leather, steel, nautical hardware, rope, a blanket, gas tank, and flashlight, and was created in 2009.
Other remarkable pieces in the collection include Duck Lamp and Duck Fan, which incorporate taxidermy birds into the frameworks of objects. In Duck Lamp, a taxidermy goose’s head is replaced with a lamp head, while in Duck Fan, a duck is placed in front of a fan to show that “birds fly against the wind every day,” according to the piece’s description. The artist believed Duck Lamp to ring better than Goose Lamp when naming the fan.
There are also shelves created from piano key-like black strips and a cabinet with mirrors forming a kaleidoscope, as well as Occupy Wall Street signs that serve as chairs too, all of which beg viewers to question whether or not they can use an object in a different way than they are told to use it. At the entrance to the exhibit are many of Errazuriz’s initial sketchings of the objects he eventually brought to life, and a magnetic board placed on the wall next to the sketches invites viewers to show off their own sketches.
The exhibit is most certainly one of the Carnegie Museum of Art’s more unusual displays, with striking pieces such as a door with two peep holes, behind which lies a wall and a message that screams “You are not a pirate!! *open the other eye & look again,” among its taxidermy ducks and potentially dangerous furniture. Beyond their shock factor, the exhibit’s pieces — each and every one of them — ask visitors to spend some time with them to understand the meaning behind the zany first impressions they leave. In a world where people are constantly on the move, a collection of work that asks people to spend one more second standing in meditation to discern multiple meanings and uses for an object can do no wrong.
The installation in the Hall of Architecture is on display through Nov. 23, 2014, while the pieces in the Forum Gallery are on display through Jan. 12, 2015. Student admission to the exhibit is free with a Carnegie Mellon ID.

Five artists, all Pittsburgh based, unveiled installations at the Mattress Factory on Friday night at an opening reception for the museum’s ongoing Artists in Residence exhibit. Diaspora by Ryder Henry, damn everything but the circus by Benjamin Sota, Word Balloons by John Peña, and Is Always, What Does It Mean?, Again and Again. by Danny Bracken will all be on display in the main Mattress Factory gallery, with Body Memory Architecture by Kathleen Montgomery on display at the museum’s off-site gallery through May 31, 2015.
There are four installations in the main gallery, each filling an entire room.
Diaspora, by Ryder Henry, is an immensely detailed futuristic city made from cardboard boxes. The city is at once both familiar and alien. Rather than opting for a concrete jungle, Henry creates a grassy suburbia, punctuated by foreign objects, black in color with asymmetric outlines and visually challenging structures. Elements of both dystopian and idealistic science fiction are present. Red colored retro-futuristic rockets and circular skyscrapers pulled out from a Jetsons cartoon reside less than a block away from modern housing developments and heavy industrial machines, which look more like the burned out carcasses of spaceships than a traditional factory. Outside the city are floating islands that represent isolated memories from the creator’s life. From a Chinese restaurant to a school and more, Henry seems devoted to inciting feelings of nostalgia and personal recognition from viewers.
There’s also a larger grid of isolated apartment buildings, each on a small platform rising up from the ground. The isolated buildings are spread across an entire room, giving the viewer a sense of scale and isolation. The manner in which Henry experiments with space was one of my favorite sensations in the museum. 
There exists yet another part of the exhibit, the wildest yet, composed of fantastical rounded circular starships adorned with Arabic symbols and incisions taken straight from a mosque. Afro-futurism is a relatively well-known and interesting art form, but this may be the first time I’ve seen an attempt at Arabic futurism pulled off. The exhibit ends with a model of the starship Enterprise, again adorned with Arabic patterns and surrounded by a web of magazine clippings from Henry’s life, once more demonstrating his willingness to straddle the boundaries between fantastical abstraction and deeply personal expression.
In contrast, Benjamin Sota’s damn everything but the circus, was unfortunately not as engaging. The cleverly-placed turnstile at the installation’s entrance into a room-sized red tent is exciting, but what awaits inside is a rather uninspired simulation of a circus. The first noticeable thing about the tent is the oddly chosen jazz music (does circus music often feature live saxophone?) and shifting lighting. It fluctuates between “daytime” (overly red-orange glow) to bluish nightclub lighting. Finally, the physical exhibits — a trapeze, a wire, and a strongman’s ball — were very uninspired. A little more visual challenge and abstraction could have been used here. 
Word Balloons by John Peña fared a little better. The exhibit consisted of two huge comic word balloons and translates a pop culture icon from a 2-D to a 3-D medium. However, the word balloons themselves distract from the other aspects of the exhibit. The smaller balloon says “Sometimes I just don’t know how to feel in the world”, while the larger one reads “So I talk and talk and work to fill the emptiness.” While the concept of literally using a physical manifestation of speech to fill “emptiness” is an interesting use of the size of the balloons, I found myself to be rather mesmerized by the smooth curves and dimensionality of the speech balloon itself. Instead of feeling the awkwardness of what Pena was trying to convey, I actually found myself being inexplicably calmed by the shape and smoothness of the speech bubble.
Finally, Danny Bracken’s exhibit: Is Always, What Does it Mean?, Again and Again. is actually three different components in one room, tied together by a common atmosphere. This exhibit is the best of the bunch. The light in the room is completely dimmed, save for spotlights illuminating each component. Bracken also uses music effectively to create a serene and calming environment. In seeking to make his viewer contemplate the essence of nature and man-made simulation, Bracken is successful. In the first third of the room, Bracken has two pods, one of actual dirt and grass, and a separate one consisting of a digital projection of dirt and grass on a curved surface. Using the music as an emotional baseline of sorts, Bracken seems to ask whether the projection of grass and dirt can match the emotional response of the real thing. The next component reinforces this idea, a screen showing shifting, rounded, cool blue shapes. Looking at the screen, and the blue patterns moving across it coupled with the ambient music, it is easy to recreate the emotional response from the natural scene it emulates. The final component is a man-made rainbow, a stream of water droplets being sprayed from the ceiling and creating a hoop-shaped double rainbow. More self-contained than a natural rainbow, the final component seems to suggest that simulated, digital art can indeed be more impressive than the real thing. 
In an age where everything is shared and cheaply consumed by anyone with a smartphone, art is becoming more of a people’s medium. If this is where art appreciation is going, I’ll be the first one to ditch my starched suit for a pair of worn jeans and a Where’s Waldo? sweatshirt.

“Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.”
Apparently, that’s the inscription marking the Gates of Hell, deep down in the haunted catacombs of Paris, according to the filmmakers of As Above, So Below. Unfortunately, that should have been the cautionary tagline for this movie and for the poor souls who wasted $10 to watch it.
The film starts when Scarlet, a ruthless alchemy scholar, flips open a video camera to introduce herself and to explain why she is in Iran. Wanting to fulfill her late father’s quest to find the Philosopher’s Stone (yes, the same stone from Harry Potter), Scarlett is in the midst of an overly reckless task to find a cipher key that will help her find the stone, located in Paris. Finding the key entails traveling to underground ruins that will literally blow up in two seconds, yet she decides to go ahead and search for the key, all the while recording everything. She even sees an apparition of her late father in the ruins and, instead of bolting out of this creepy underground cavern, holds the camera up to him as the ruins explode. That’s the first warning for this careless flop of a film.
Despite the obvious hatred of this movie seeping through this review, it is refreshing to see a protagonist who is intelligent and has a genuine motivation to carry out an expedition at any cost. Her determination to find the Philosopher’s Stone is so fixed that she attracted the attention of a documentary filmmaker, providing a flimsy excuse for the found-footage style that has to be endured for the next 90 minutes. She then recruits her sidekick George to help discover the stone and, after recklessly destroying museum artifacts (while filming her act of criminal mischief), partners with a Frenchman named Pap, who promises to guide her through the catacombs beneath the streets of Paris, where she believes the stone is located.
Early into the journey, the group stumbles into trouble as Scarlett wants to go into a forbidden section of the catacombs but Pap resists, warning that those who go in never come out. Fortunately for Scarlett, the catacombs collapse and seal off their escape, trapping them in the only undiscovered section of the catacombs. Scarlett, unfazed by the creepy female satanic cultists and the other highly-visible warning signs of death, encourages the crew to venture further underground, suggesting that the only way out is to go deeper. It’s kind of surprising that the rest of the group actually believes that going deeper underground will lead them back up to the streets of Paris. But, it is a horror movie, and the director probably thought that stupidity is required for such a genre.
As they crawl deeper and deeper into the catacombs, a series of things start to happen. Unfortunately, these “things” are barely enough to give you the creeps, let alone a good, old-fashioned scare. The characters start experiencing apparitions from each of their tormented pasts. Scarlett, again, pays no mind to these apparitions and pushes the group onward. Eventually, as they are about to enter through the Gates of Hell, the group faces a multitude of supernatural forces. Despite this promising plot twist, the rest of the film carries off like a pointless video game, with no real scares or psychological trauma. By this time in the film, the only important objective is to wait for the film to end so this vomit-inducing journey can be over with.
You would think that when a group of people are about to enter the Gates of Hell, their priorities, such as carrying around a heavy film camera for the purpose of making a documentary, would change somewhat. Fortunately, the crew eventually decides to ditch the camera as they finally realize it’s just one big burden and is recording something they most likely won’t want to re-watch on a Friday night with a glass of wine. Smart decision. But, strangely enough, the film continues with the found-footage style .... with no camera. The story continues to be told through the point of view of person holding a camera and, if they stumble or fall, it’s as if the camera falls to the ground and we, the audience, are forced to view the film in the perspective of a nonexistent video camera. What’s the point of such a meaningless medium?
Found footage filmmaking is, for the most part, a nauseating artistic effect. Cameras are meant to be an invisible, yet active spectator. They are a part of the characters’ universe and the journey they take part in, and we are the natural force that accompanies them. A camera can also establish the space of the world and help the audience see what the characters cannot, establishing elements such as tension, suspense, and irony. But, when a director decides to throw in a camera that the characters must tote around, the medium becomes forced and constricted. We are limited to seeing only what the digital camera can see. Instead of advancing the plot, the camera now becomes a burden for the characters at all times, even during situations when they shouldn’t worry about carrying a camera.
As Above, So Below had an interesting premise that could have made for a unique film. Setting the film in Paris and exploring the underground world below had the potential to be a very enjoyable experience. But, while the director thought a found-footage format would make the film stupendous, it just became stupid.

Blistering.
In both lyricism and production, this is the single word that sums up “Never Catch Me” the new song from Flying Lotus featuring verses from Kendrick Lamar, released in anticipation of Flying Lotus’s upcoming album You’re Dead!, out on Oct. 7.
Two prolific artists in their respective mediums — Kendrick Lamar in rap and Flying Lotus in hip-hop beat production — come together on “Never Catch Me” to transcend genre norms.
To the point when Kendrick Lamar, through layered vocals, sings “you’re never gonna catch me, no,” you can tell he’s not trying to make a statement regarding other rappers trying to match his skill. Rather, it’s a statement about his own creative work outliving himself and, in that way, his own mortality will never catch him.

Dear Evan,
My interp teacher just gave me a D on my first essay, and asked me to redo the whole thing, but I dont see the point. Im in business, and its not like Im going to be writing to people any way, as long as I can talk well and do business, Ill be fine. What is event the point of making nonwriting based majors take a writing class? I just dont see the the point.
Cluelessly,
Not Exactly Enthusiastic Doing Script-based Assignments, has No Experience In Teaching Of Rudiments
Dear NEEDS AN EDITOR,
I’m sorry — I couldn’t hear you the first time. Can you see the the sic point of taking Interpretation and Argument? Oh, you can’t? Good to know.
I would put this in terms that you would understand, but frankly, I don’t want to waste time and energy on trying to figure out what you could or couldn’t comprehend. I know, harsh, but eh.
If I were to guess your age based on the quality of your writing, I would say you were an 8-year-old — a lazy, whining 8-year-old. And if you write like an 8-year-old in the job market — any job market — you may as well file for unemployment. This applies to emails, résumés, grant proposals, post-it notes, writings on the walls of restroom stalls: If you can’t get anywhere close to being cogent, clear, and consistent in your writing, and if you can’t make a cohesive argument, then you’re screwed.
The reason why you and many other first-years with similar disabilities (often in STEM disciplines) have to take Interp is to make you realize that fact, and to help you organize an argument. Unfortunately, most Interp professors are so caught up in their respective subjects that they lose sight of this goal, but they can still smell sorry excuses for the English language from miles away.
So, now you know. Your writing sucks. It’s difficult to get better, but work on it. It’ll be good for you.
Or just work a 9-to-5,
Evan

Crepes Parisiennes is looking to provide customers with more than its already-wide range of crepes, waffles, and pastries — it is now applying for a liquor license.
According to documents from the Office of City Clerk, a resolution for a transfer of licenses to the owners of the creperie has passed. Although it is not clear when the license will become effective, the documents state that the restaurant will soon be able to sell liquor. 
The expansion into alcohol sales is the latest evolution of a business that started in 1998 as a cart on the corner of Margaret Morrison and Tech Street. There, co-owner David Handler sold crepes before the spot was given over to students in the Tepper School of Business. It is now used for vending freshly grilled burgers and hot dogs.
In 2000, after two years of selling crepes from a cart, Handler opened Crepes Parisiennes in Shadyside, and four years after that, established a location on S. Craig Street This past August, however, Handler chose to close down his Shadyside location, in favor of promoting the Craig Street site. 
“We did well there, and I took a pay cut,” he explained. “But I wanted to build up business for this great location.” A part of accomplishing this goal will be the inclusion of alcohol on the menu.
Handler, along with co-owner and wife Shannon Handler, is looking to increase the seating available at the Craig Street location. The plan is to erect a sun room in the back, along with patio seating in the interim. 
Handler speculated that, with time, Crepes Parisiennes might offer a wide selection of drinks and cultivate a bar-like atmosphere in the expanded areas. This change would come complete with extended hours two or three nights a week.
Currently though, Handler wants to keep things simple and classic: “What I really would like to do is sell hard cider,” he said. “It’s traditional.” 
His idea corresponds with a practice stemming from the Brittany region of France. The area is known both for its crepes and hard cider, which Handler said pair well together. 
He has not decided on what brand he would like to serve, but he is already considering his options. He says he is contemplating both imports and Arsenal Cider, a local hard cider made in Lawrenceville. Whichever label is chosen, Handler is sure it will match harmoniously with the existing fare.
The changes to Crepes Parisiennes’ menu come in a time of changes for the Craig Street corridor. Over the summer, the Panther Hollow Inn at 4611 Forbes Ave. closed its doors for the last time, and will be replaced in the coming months with a Chipotle Mexican Grill. 
The university is also investing in Craig Street; last year the PNC Bank on the corner of Forbes Avenue and S. Craig Street was replaced by the university’s Integrated Innovation Institute. 
The Carnegie Mellon community seems to be looking forward to the coming developments at the creperie. “I think it’s interesting,” sophomore computer science and mathematics major Aaron Friedlander said. “The thought of crepes and alcohol could be fun.” 
Even Cage Schmidt, who often works at the Creperie in the Jared L. Cohon University Center, a competitor to Crepes Parisiennes, is excited for the coming changes. Schmidt said, “I definitely want to go down there. I’ll take my girlfriend — she can’t drink but I will.”

At the end of the spring semester last academic year, students were invited to apply for housing in a new campus location, Clyde House, located at 624 Clyde St. off Fifth Avenue. 
Since then, students have moved into the newly renovated facility that houses students interested in the global community. 
The Office of the Dean of Student Affairs has dubbed the house a “Global Living Learning House” in which students with intercultural interests can explore their roles as citizens of the world, according to the office’s website.
Renee Camerlengo, Assistant Dean of Student Affairs and Clyde House housefellow, described the house as one in which Pittsburgh Carnegie Mellon students and exchange students live together to gain “an increased sense of cultural competency.”
The house has a capacity of 28 beds, according to Director of Housing Services Thomas Cooley. 
Currently, the facility is home to students in seven doubles and three triples, as well as a community adviser (CA) responsible for Clyde House, Neville Apartments, and Shady Oak Apartments. The CA has a single room on the first floor of Clyde House, according to floor plans on the Office of the Dean of Student Affair’s website. 
Currently, the rooms have both undergraduate and graduate students, according to Camerlengo.
The house contains notable spaces such as an enclosed porch that serves as the house’s entrance and a small fitness area, a kitchen, a parlor common area on the first floor, second and third floor common areas, and a study room on the second floor. 
There is an outdoor porch fitted with colorful porch chairs on the front right side of the facility as well.
“You get the suite-style, apartment-style space.... all coming out into community space,” Cooley said of the building. “So it’s a space that gives you privacy but also is very easy to have some intimate, nice spaces.”
Behind the house, the university has repaved a parking lot and the driveway leading to it, which will serve as a space for university vehicle parking. 
Cooley said he plans to provide outdoor picnic areas for residents in a plot of land next to the lot to grill and relax.
The renovations to the new housing facility cost the university about $1.8 million, according to Cooley. 
Demolition of the building took place in April with a proposed timeline of finishing renovations by Aug. 1. Construction of the new rooms and community spaces began in May, and renovations were completed during Orientation week.
Cooley said that with renovations, Housing Services hoped to capture the nostalgic aesthetics of the previous building, such as a grand staircase leading to the second story, stained glass windows, and multiple fireplaces, while updating the building with a modern look, such as the addition of new wooden floors, overhead lighting fixtures, and bright red back stairwells.
In 2012 Carnegie Mellon purchased a set of properties on Fifth Avenue and Clyde Street from the Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh, including 624 Clyde St., for approximately $5 million. 
The building previously housed the Roselia Center, a nonprofit organization owned by the diocese’s Catholic Charities that helped women and their children find apartments in the area.
Clyde House was established as a new facility where the university can help students to develop as global citizens, a goal that Camerlengo said is a commitment of Carnegie Mellon. 
“The aspiration for Clyde House is that half the residents will be from the Pittsburgh campus and the other half of the residents will be exchange students in Pittsburgh for the semester,” Camerlengo said via email. “With robust discussions and activities in the community and guests who will share a global perspective, it’s hoped that students find this to be a learning environment that they enjoy [and] feel connected to.”
A contributing influence to the house’s establishment this semester was the approximately 20 students from Carnegie Mellon’s Qatar campus who study in Pittsburgh each semester, according to Camerlengo. The house was “intended to be able to provide an optimal living experience for exchange students,” she said.
There are currently exchange students from several countries, including Qatar, living in Clyde House this semester.
The house requires students to fill out an application to live in the building, similar to applications for such housing facilities as Henderson Wellness House and the CMU Sustainability House.

The National Science Foundation (NSF) announced recently that it is giving Carnegie Mellon $5.6 million in grant money through the CyberCorps Scholarship for Service (SFS). The SFS is a federal program that provides full-tuition scholarships for students who show promise in careers strengthening the nation’s cybersecurity infrastructure.
This is not the first time that the NSF has given money to Carnegie Mellon to fund cybersecurity education — the SFS program has been active at the university for over 10 years, handing out a total of over $21.6 million in awards and scholarships. This year’s grant, however, is the largest award to date, according to Dena Haritos Tsamitis, director of the College of Engineering’s Information Networking Institute (INI), in a university news release.
Students who are eligible for the SFS program are U.S. citizens who have been accepted into Carnegie Mellon’s graduate programs in information security or information security policy at the Heinz College or College of Engineering. The SFS program awards students full-tuition scholarships and sometimes stipends; students who receive scholarships through the program commit to a summer internship with a participating federal agency and one year of federal employment for every year they spend earning their degree.
Over the course of the program’s history at Carnegie Mellon, over 157 graduates have gone on to work for the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, and other federal departments.
Allison Boos, a 2014 graduate of the program, is working as an IT specialist in the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice. Boos studied information security at the INI through the SFS program and spent a summer interning at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco as part of the National Incident Response Team.
“The experience of being an SFS student not only provided me with the education and skills inherent in a Carnegie Mellon education but also surrounded me with others with similar interests and goals, establishing a network that is both personally and professionally beneficial,” Boos said in a university news release.
The INI is a graduate school with degree programs in information networking; information security; and information technology mobility, information security, and software management. Since Tsamitis began directing the INI in 2004, it has earned the Center of Academic Excellence (CAE) in information assurance/cyber defense education, information assurance/cyber defense research, and cyber operations. The CAE is a federal recognition established in the wake of President Obama’s National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) and overseen by the National Security Agency.
“Our graduates in information security are sought after by employers and our research activities at CyLab are discussed by leaders and innovators in the areas of threat analysis, software security, cryptography, privacy, risk management and other areas,” said James H. Garrett Jr., dean of the College of Engineering and the Thomas Lord Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering, in a university news release. “The SFS scholarship funds and new collaborative research opportunities are much appreciated by and a great fit for our faculty and students.”
The university is a well-known leader in cybersecurity research. In 2000, then-computer science graduate student Luis von Ahn worked with his adviser, Manuel Blum, to create CAPTCHA, an acronym for Completely Automated Public Turing Test To Tell Computers and Humans Apart. CAPTCHA is used by hundreds of websites to tell the difference between a robot and a human in front of a computer.

In a time in American history when homicide rates are at their lowest in 50 years, it seems inexplicable that anti-gun activism is multiplying at its current rate. For the past two weeks, the Kroger Company has been on the receiving end of a series of unprovoked attacks made by Moms Demand Action (MDA). 
The rapidly growing advocacy group against gun violence is currently engaged in an ad campaign against the supermarket franchise’s open carry rules in their stores. MDA — a still-adolescent organization — is proactively persisting in its offensive toward policy change, having no grounds or context beyond the new American gun-conscious standard. The store in the spotlight is located in Cincinnati, only a 15-minute drive from Kroger’s corporate headquarters.
“We are anti-gun violence,” said Michelle Mueller, a regional representative from MDA, in a statement, “and we’ll do whatever it takes ....  to create a safer environment.” The organization, fully named Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, was formed in December 2012 in reaction to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and has been bold in its efforts since its conception. 
Its most recent victories in the battle against in-store open carry include Target and Starbucks. Both are stores with no history of gun violence. Already, the group claims that 100,000 people have signed its petition to prohibit open carry in Kroger supermarkets.
The inflated ad campaign aimed at Kroger began on Aug. 18 and was revitalized on Sept. 4, now focused not only on stores located in states with laws permitting open carry, but nationwide. The unnecessary MDA ads have been displayed in newspapers and billboards throughout the Cincinnati area, displaying people carrying long guns next to people eating food or skateboarding with the caption “One of Them Isn’t Welcome at Kroger. Guess Which One.” These ads reveal the superficiality in MDA’s grasp of the compromise in public safety caused by the open carrying of firearms.
Despite a wave of media in opposition to Kroger — including the hashtag #GroceriesNotGuns — few spokespeople from the company have commented on MDA’s actions, except by referring to a previously released company statement, asserting that the safety of the customers and associates is possible while not infringing on the rights of citizens who choose to carry. “We know that our customers are passionate on both sides of this issue and we trust them to be responsible in our stores,” the statement reads.
Despite the lack of response from the company under fire, MDA leaders continue to speak out and have deservedly started to land in hot water for it. The aforementioned MDA representative has stated that at least 16 shooting deaths have occurred at or surrounding Kroger locations; however, she has yet to provide any evidence backing this claim. 
The MDA also has no membership revenue, instead funding its political momentum with a $50 million donation from former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. While sound in mission, the organization seems to lack effective leadership and policy, epitomized in the group’s tendency to fudge attendance numbers in their support rallies since April.
Kroger is firm in its position of defending the right of its customers to carry guns in its stores. The push to limit firearms in public places, especially those serving families and children, is understandable in our current gun-reactionary society, but it may not be successful if spearheaded by an organization with leadership like MDA’s. 
Though Moms Demand Action has a great track record for changing the open carry policy of companies with formidable national presences, Kroger may be justified in refusing to compromise with a group that has yet to prove it deserves its growing social and political influence.

With the walls of the Sherman and Joyce Bowie Scott Hall going up and continuous discussion of the soon-to-be Tepper Quadrangle, it is not hard to see that Carnegie Mellon is fast-growing and changing from the local tech school it started as 114 years ago. In that time, we have become a world-class institution with many achievements in the arts, sciences, and engineering disciplines. But as we grow with our recent achievements, we need to remember that the quantity of buildings, or centers, or initiatives that we have does not make us a quality institution. 
The words “global,” “innovation,” and “initiative” seem to have entered Carnegie Mellon’s communications and stuck. It is a surprise when a campus-wide email does not contain one, if not all, of these favorite Carnegie terms. Being innovative is like having power, but as Margret Thatcher once said, “If you have to tell people you are, you aren’t.” This campus is, of course, full of brilliant people with fascinating ideas and amazing achievements. But if we keep shouting at the world about how “innovative” we are then all we are bound to receive is a global eye roll. 
Instead of setting up new “umbrella structures” and vague initiatives, we should focus on breaking down the structures and letting the brilliant individuals of this campus shine. Their light will be far more impressive then any speech about our innovation could ever be.     
The growth of initiatives and schools is surely meant with the best intentions, but none of these things will make us rise in the eyes of our peer institutions. Part of what makes Carnegie Mellon great is our ability to conduct research within a small community. No doubt the school could use a few more students’ tuition payments, or another professor’s grant money, but as a community we must toe this line carefully. Part of our strength comes from being a small but mighty research community in which people’s paths can cross outside of their home departments. 
As we move forward, we must remember the value of integrity and dignity in the way we present ourselves as an institution to the world. Our heart must remain in our work, and we must only modestly and accurately boast of our innovative initiatives when they truly deserve promotion.

This Thursday, Scotland will vote on whether to become an independent country. This is not the first time such a referendum has occurred, but it seems to be the first time that it has a chance of passing.
Recent polls show a near 50–50 split among Scottish voters. If the measure passes, Scotland would separate from the United Kingdom (UK), thus breaking a union with England, Wales, and Northern Ireland that has existed since 1707.
United States media coverage has been scant, but the consequences could be significant either way. An independent Scotland would need to apply to the European Union (EU), and the new United Kingdom would be significantly weaker as an economic power. The Economist warns that this would weaken the EU as a whole, since the UK is already promoting a referendum to leave the EU itself.
If Scotland were to become a sovereign nation, there would be an immediate currency issue since it currently uses the British pound. Most EU countries use the euro, but Scotland would generally have to be approved for EU membership before it could start using the euro. 
Leaders from the “Yes Scotland” campaign say that an independent Scotland would continue using the pound, but foreign investors worry that without support from the UK the Scottish pound would lack financial backing.
In terms of representation, an independent Scotland would have its own governing body. Scotland votes consistently more liberally than the rest of the UK, so it would be able to represent its people with more authority, instead of being confined to a liberal minority of the UK Parliament. Scotland would also make domestic decisions independently. For example, Scots generally oppose nuclear weapons, but the UK stores its nuclear weapons in Scottish lochs. An independent Scotland would likely become an anti-nuclear state.
Even if the referendum falls short, the British will have to revisit their relations with Scotland. Issues such as national defense and economic security will have to be brought into question if the countries remain united, but Scotland will probably get more autonomy within the United Kingdom. 
No matter which way the vote goes, the result of the Scottish referendum will set a precedent for the rest of Europe. Other semi-autonomous regions — the Catalan and Basque regions of Spain, the Flemish regions of Belgium — have unsuccessfully attempted to break away before. If Scotland succeeds now, we may see a new precedent for European independence.

Campaigning takes up a lot of political officials’ time and money. Maybe it takes up too much. The process of re-election appears to be the main focus of political officials to the extent that they will strategically choose to avoid making any major decisions.
On Sept. 6, President Barack Obama announced that he plans to put off action on immigration issues until after the midterm elections, claiming that the decision was the result of this summer’s surge of undocumented children crossing the United States border from Mexico. However, Obama’s decision appears to be more of a response to Democrats in tough Senate races, who were concerned that taking action on immigration would affect their campaigns.
Before Obama’s address, action was expected to take place on immigration by the end of the summer to reduce the number of deportations and possibly to offer work permits to people living in the United States illegally. 
Obama promised that he would act by the end of the summer to address the many problems of the immigration system. Now, White House officials claim that Obama will act by the end of the year. What does this mean for the hundreds of families who fear deportation and the separation of their families?
President Obama broke a promise to immigrants, their families, and their allies. Obama raised the hopes of many when he promised to take up comprehensive immigration reform during his first year in office. Six years later, many families are having to live with the fear of deportation as a result of Obama’s delay until after the November elections. In addition, the administration’s deportation numbers beat all previous records, with Obama deporting more than two million immigrants in his almost eight-year tenure. As a result, advocates for immigration reform have commonly referred to Obama as “deporter-in-chief.”
This is very unfortunate because it shows how difficult it is to take action in the United States’ political system. One flaw of the system is the frequency of elections. Political officials spend more time focusing on getting re-elected than taking action, especially regarding controversial issues. Making major decisions is simply not something political officials will do during campaign season.
Recently, Senate Democrats running in conservative states have not had the best of luck, as GOP opponents use the subject of immigration to attack their campaigns. To activist groups, such as America’s Voice, Obama’s decision to stall action was an obvious political move and a blunder.
Having waited for months for Obama to take action on the issue, disappointed immigrants and their allies are now forced to wait longer. President Obama must stop making false promises and fulfill the hopes he once raised for significant immigration reform.

We, a group of current Carnegie Mellon students and recent alumni, are writing to express our concerns over a recent document that was sent out to the campus community. On Friday afternoon, Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno sent an email titled “Preventing and Responding to Sexual Harassment and Violence.” 
In this email, she outlines the changes and initiatives that Carnegie Mellon has taken since last September to improve its handlings of sexual assault on campus—changes which are necessary, considering that the Office of Civil Rights in the Department of Education is currently investigating Carnegie Mellon for its alleged failure to protect students’ Title IX rights in regard to sexual assault.
Within this email, Casalegno included a link to a publication that the university developed titled “Decisions that Matter,” and touted this publication as an example of the university’s “principle initiatives” in combating sexual violence on campus. 
We find it very troubling, however, that a document about sexual violence called “Decisions that Matter” seems more focused on a victim’s decisions leading up to an assault than it does on telling students to make the decision not to rape someone.
It includes a page on “Risk Reduction of Sexual Assault,” which lists specific actions students should take to avoid being assaulted, including “Taking CMU’s R.A.D. [Rape Aggression Defense] self-defense class,” and “Keeping the doors to your home locked at all times.” These “tips” reinforce the idea that most rapes on college campuses are caused by strangers who attack you on the street or break into your home. 
However, in 75-80 percent of campus rape cases, a woman’s attacker is an acquaintance, classmate, friend, or (ex)boyfriend, according to the White House’s “Not Alone” report. Other tips include “Avoiding making sexual decisions while you are intoxicated,” implying that alcohol-facilitated rape is a “decision” that a victim makes.
These tips come with an asterisked aside that says these tips “cannot eliminate the chance for sexual assault,” but they still are putting the onus on (presumably) women to prevent someone else’s crime. More disturbingly, when you tell a woman that she must restrict her behavior in order to avoid being raped, what you’re really saying is that a woman should ensure that a rapist goes after someone else—and how does that help to make Carnegie Mellon an ultimately safer community?
This document also includes vague “Pathways to Being an Active Bystander,” but that list doesn’t provide advice that is anywhere near as pointed or detailed as the “Risk Reduction” tips. This approach is entirely backward, as bystander intervention — and specifically, calling out men to engage as allies — has been cited by the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault as one of “the most promising prevention strategies.”
It is somewhat mind-boggling that a publication called “Decisions that Matter” that’s about sexual assault doesn’t focus entirely on the importance of getting consent in sexual interactions and on the consequences that will follow when a rapist decides to commit a crime. Even the page that lists Pennsylvania’s legal definition of rape isn’t thorough: It prominently features the phrase “forcible” compulsion, which is a term that carries certain legal connotations that Pennsylvania law has actually evolved beyond.
CMU’s initiatives may be well-intentioned — in fact, its first-year education program Haven, which Casalegno also cites in her email, actually includes information that is far more effective in preventing sexual assault. 
However, Haven was only added to Orientation this year, meaning that the vast majority of the college campus is getting its education through misguided documents like “Decisions that Matter.” We suggest that those who want to learn more about proven methods of reducing sexual assault view resources on notalone.gov; students who want to learn more about their rights under Title IX to an education free of sexual assault or harassment should visit knowyourix.org.

Last week, Apple held its annual iPhone unveiling event in one of its most symbolic venues: the Flint Center for the Performing Arts. This location is where both the original Macintosh and the iMac, which brought forth Apple’s rebirth, were unveiled. As Apple took the stage, many wondered — after nearly three years without Steve Jobs — would its return to this venue mark yet another rebirth or, instead, a decline?
Apple’s event was another successful one, revolving around the new iPhone 6 models and the Apple Watch. With both of these devices, Apple has continued its trend of paying exceptional attention to detail. This attention can be seen everywhere from the way the glass screen of the new iPhone flows into its aluminum chassis to the new user interface controls accompanying the Apple Watch. 
However, while Apple’s attention to design has continued past the death of Jobs, one important thing has changed. Historically recognized as an industry leader, Apple is now becoming more and more of an industry follower.
Apple is very late in entering the industry with near field communications (NFC), smartwatches, and enlarged screens. Google has long offered these features to its users. However, has Apple ever been the first to enter an industry? As was the case in the years of Jobs, Apple is often a latecomer to most of the industries it enters. However, it has almost always managed to choose a slow-growth industry and turn it into something enormous.
Take the smartwatch industry. Smartwatches are not exactly new. The Pebble has been around for over a year. However, in that year, Pebble only managed to sell around 400,000 units since January 2013. Compare this to the nine million iPhone 5S units Apple sold within three days of its launch. It is evident that Apple may sell more watches on its release day than Pebble has during its lifetime. The reason the new Apple Watch will be more popular is not because of its specs, nor because people actually need another screen on their wrist. It is because instead of focusing on bragging about the specs, Apple focuses on people. Half of its keynote emphasized everyday people using its devices to make their lives easier.
The new Apple may not be churning out as many ideas that have never been seen before. In a time of maturing mobile industries, it may be finally admitting defeat and making some decisions that it would have never made before, like the iPhone 6’s enormous five and a half inch screen. However, in many ways, the reborn Apple is still the old Apple.
Only the new Apple would have admitted defeat and enlarged its screens while focusing solely on making it operable with one hand. Only the new Apple would be able to think up something like the digital crown, a new twist on the old device found on every analog watch. 
Only the new Apple would have been able to enter an industry as a follower but come out a leader. While the new Apple has changed greatly, as it stated during the opening of the keynote: “Different is the one thing about us that will always be the same.”

The hashtag WhyIStayed has been trending on Twitter for the past week as a unique and effective tool to subvert the usual conversation surrounding domestic violence. 
Ostensibly, WhyIStayed is a response to the leaked video of former NFL star Ray Rice beating Janay Rice, his then-fiancee and current wife, in a hotel elevator, according to CNN. But the trend also engages with society’s tendency of blaming the victim in discussions of domestic violence. This engagement is a vital step toward alleviating the intense shame often heaped upon victims of domestic violence.
When the video first leaked, questions arose as to why Janay Rice did not choose to leave her partner, as opposed to why Ray Rice beat his partner in the first place. This is typical of domestic violence discussions. Rather than question the motives and behaviors of the abuser, people sometimes question why anyone would allow someone else to hit her. This choice pushes the shame of being abused away from the abuser and onto the victim. 
People who ask questions like “Why didn’t Janay leave Ray?” do not understand the truly corrosive effects of domestic violence, or how much danger women who are abused by a partner are in. According to domesticabuseshelter.org, battering is the single largest cause of injury to women, and around 4,000 women in America die per year due to domestic violence. Approximately 75 percent of those women are killed when they try to leave an abusive relationship or after they had already left it. 
WhyIStayed allows people who have suffered domestic abuse to discuss their experiences and subvert victim-blaming. Beverly Gooden, who created the hashtag, shared some of her own heart-rending experiences, such as “I stayed because I was halfway across the country, isolated from my friends and family. And there was no one to help me,” and “I tried to leave the house once after an abusive episode, and he blocked me. He slept in front of the door that entire night.”
WhyIStayed is an excellent and necessary way to pivot the conversation surrounding domestic violence away from victim-blaming. People who suffer from domestic violence need help and support, and this trend, through raising awareness, is an effective tool for providing that.

The use of hydraulic fracturing to extract natural gas from the Marcellus Shale deposit in Western Pennsylvania has proven to be an extremely controversial issue. This controversy is poised to intensify with the results of a Yale University study concluding that residents living close to Marcellus Shale drilling wells in Washington County, Pa. have more health problems than those living farther away.
Specifically, the study, conducted in 2012, found that out of 492 people living within half a mile of a shale gas site, 39 percent reported upper respiratory symptoms, as opposed to 18 percent living more than a mile away. It should be noted that this study only establishes correlation between geographic location and health outcomes, and does not provide any insight into direct causes of these health problems. 
Regardless, advocacy groups against hydraulic fracturing for natural gas in Western Pennsylvania will likely use this evidence in their case against gas and drilling companies, adding further fuel to a continually fiery debate. While there is a debate surrounding the use of hydraulic fracking to obtain natural gas in the Marcellus Region, there is a need for academic studies to analyze the effects of this practice with as great a degree of certainty as possible. 
This recent Yale study only suggests a correlation between health outcomes and proximity to a fracking well, a relationship that could be attributed to socioeconomic status or other factors. Uncertainty such as this underscores the need for institutions such as Carnegie Mellon to conduct thorough academic analyses of such local issues as hydraulic fracturing. 
Particularly with the creation of the Wilton E. Scott Institute for Energy Innovation, the university should continue to focus on studying important energy and environmentally-related topics such as hydraulic fracturing and their public health impacts. 
As our university continues to expand, creating new institutes and building new buildings, we must also remember that academic research should be one of our foremost priorities and that local issues deserve our attention.
