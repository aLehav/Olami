The Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team played their home opener against Bethany College on Saturday. The Tartans defeated the Bisons 82–74, bringing their record to 2–0.
After starting the game with an exchange of failed drives, Bethany struck first. Sophomore guard Ryan Maha answered with a three-point shot, and the Tartans would never surrender their lead. The Tartans slowly worked up their lead as Bethany tried to keep pace, with the Tartans shooting at 62.5 percent in the first half. Though Tartans were sometimes able to rack up a sizable lead, the Bisons were often able to keep the difference between the teams at five points.
The end of the half saw the Bisons make a 7–0 run, putting momentum on the side of the visiting team, but not for long.
The second half began with Bethany scoring twice, cutting the Tartan lead to 40–37. The Tartans struck back to increase their lead back to the equilibrium five points, but they also quickly picked up five fouls before Bethany’s first of the half. The back-and-forth play continued into the second half, with Carnegie Mellon continuing to maintain the lead but seldom have better or worse than a five point lead. At the final two minutes, the Tartans worked to preserve their 79–72 lead. As Bethany tried to make a last second comeback, junior forward Jack Serbin sealed the Bisons’ fate as he took the ball from Bethany and completed a final layup.
“We’ve started the season well,” Serbin said after the game. “Bethany was a good test. They’re very strong and athletic, but we managed to do well against them.” The Tartans are looking to build off the momentum from last year’s 14–11 finish, their first winning season since the 2008–09 season in which they finished 20–7 and made it to the second round of the NCAA playoffs. “We have returning starters who have played key roles, and we have some really strong freshmen.”
Still, Serbin knows there is plenty of room for improvement. “Today was about not beating ourselves, not turning over the ball.” Though the Tartans had six fewer turnovers than the Bisons, Bethany was better able to capitalize off of the extra possessions with three more points off of turnovers. The myriad of fouls that opened up the second half is also of concern, as future foes could utilize those opportunities to overtake Tartan leads or potentially put a game out of reach.
Nevertheless, the Tartans have plenty of reason to be optimistic about this season. Serbin recorded his second double-double of the season, racking up 24 points and 18 rebounds against Bethany. Maha tied his career-high of 20 points, making five three-pointers and making four assists. First-year forward and center Patrick Ehland had another strong performance with 14 points. Senior guard Jason Sebak and junior center Chris Shkil have also added valuable contributions offensively, with Sebak totaling seven assists and Shkil earning 11 points.
The Tartans will look to continue their two game winning streak when they host Allegheny College on Tuesday, Nov. 24.

The Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team took the field on a chilly morning last Friday, Nov. 20, to face off against the Calvin College Knights in the third round of the NCAA playoffs. The teams were two of the final sixteen teams left in the tournament. The 20th ranked Calvin team managed to defeat the Tartans in overtime by a score of 1–0, advancing them to the sectional semifinal of the tournament.
While the Tartans’ season was cut short, they ended it with an impressive 17–2–1 record, and their success throughout the season cannot be understated.
The entirety of the first half consisted of intense and frequent changes of possession between the teams, and neither squad seemed to be building a sizable pressure advantage. This game largely revolved around defensive play, which was reflected in the low number of shots for each team, with the Tartans putting two shots on goal in the entire first half and the Knights only managing one of their own. It was clear that every shot taken this game would be precious and could not be taken for granted. The shots in the first half came from sophomore midfielders Tori Iatarola and Haili Adams, but neither managed to make it past the goalkeeper and the game transitioned into the 2nd half still with a scoreline of 0–0.
The second half saw the Tartans play more aggressively than they did in the first half, putting a total of 6 shots on goal in the second half compared to the Knights’ two. Calvin was making the most of their shots, but junior Katie Liston defended the Tartan goal well and made a save in the 60th minute to keep the game tied at 0–0. Carnegie Mellon bombarded the Calvin goal with shots throughout the second half. Senior Alli McGugan managed to break away from the Calvin defense in the 70th minute, but the keeper managed to contain her shot from 18 yards out. The Tartans had another chance to score on a free kick by Iatarola, which was also saved by the Calvin goalkeeper. The Knights were hanging on to the game and would not let go. The Tartans had two more shot attempts in the final minutes of the half while the Knights had one of their own.
Each of these shots went high and the game went into overtime still with a score of 0–0, a situation all too familiar for the Tartans.
This overtime period, however, did not go in favor of the Tartans as it usually does. A minute into the period, Calvin played a ball out of the corner, and managed to settle it in the box. A Calvin player put the shot into the lower left corner of the Tartan goal, passing Liston for the game-winning score.
The Tartans’ hopes were shattered, but the women of the Carnegie Mellon soccer team can hold their heads high knowing they played an incredible season and achieved great success. Sometimes things just fall short of expectation, and the only solution is to look ahead to see what can be improved. The Tartans will do just that, and will surely come into the 2016 season prepared to improve on their playoff performance and return to the field as a great team.

Football
The Carnegie Mellon football team took on Bridgewater State University in the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) Legacy Bowl on Sunday. The Tartans won 48–13, dominating the game throughout all four quarters.
The Tartans’ first drive finished with sophomore running back Sam Benger getting the first score of the game on a 2-yard touchdown run. The Bears’ first drive saw an early end as the Tartans’ defense stopped Bridgewater on third and one. Next, senior quarterback Andrew Hearon completed a deep pass to sophomore wide receiver John Prather, but Hearon then threw an interception on third and goal. Bridgewater was able to make a long drive and got a touchdown to tie the game, but senior wide receiver Chris Herrera received excellent blocks on the ensuing kickoff and ran all the way into the endzone.
The second quarter opened with the Tartans stopping the Bears on third down. The Tartans’ next drive opened with a 20-yard run by Benger, and after a few more plays, Hearon completed a deep touchdown pass to Herrera. The Bears then got a very good kickoff return, but the Tartans took over on a fourth down in the redzone. Hearon threw another interception, but the Bears were unable to get any points off of the turnover. Benger then broke off another long run, and he soon reached the endzone again.
The second half opened with Bridgewater getting a quick touchdown, but the Tartans blocked the extra point. The next drive saw Herrera extend himself to grab a long pass from Hearon, and Benger fought on four plays to get into the endzone for the third time. After another defensive stop and a very good punt return, penalties forced the Tartans to punt, but the Tartans forced a three and out and nearly got a safety. Without much distance to travel to the endzone, senior wide receiver Graham Schilling was wide open in the endzone after a fake bubble screen and got the touchdown pass, though the extra point was missed. The Tartans got the ball back and ran a few plays as the quarter closed.
The fourth quarter opened with Hearon unable to convert a fourth down scramble. The Bears made a long drive, but the Tartans stopped them on a fourth and goal trick play. From there, the Tartans decided to take their time, running the clock down on a very long drive capped off by yet another Benger touchdown run. The Tartans made one more stop to close out the game.
Men’s Cross Country
The Carnegie Mellon men’s cross country team competed at the 2015 NCAA Division III Cross Country Championships on Saturday. The Tartans finished 18th out of 32 teams, while the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire won its first-ever title. This was the Tartans’ 21st time competing in the event.
Junior Ryan Archer once again led the Tartans’ effort, finishing in 25:14.6 to take 57th place. Sophomore Ryan Auld finished in 119th place with a time of 25:37.40. Senior Josh Antonson and first-year William Mitchell followed behind. Anstonson grabbed 132nd place in 25:40.50, while Mitchell took 135th place in 25:42.20. Junior Owen Norley finished in 153rd place in 25:47.40, followed by junior Brian Bollens in 25:49.90 for 158th place. Senior Marc-Daniel Julien rounded out the Tartans with a 237th place finish in 26:20.50.

Matt Forte getting injured is the best thing that could have possibly happened to my team.
After week eight, I was basically ready to give up on all of this nonsense. Le’Veon Bell tore his MCL and was deemed unable to play for the rest of the season. My two-week losing streak brought my record to 4–4, and I couldn’t even.
But then the harps played, the angels sang, and Jeremy Langford fell into my lap. The Bears’ new number-one running back had just been sitting on my bench for eight weeks, and it was finally going to pay off. And holy ravioli did it ever. In the past two weeks, Langford has scored more points than Bell did in his last four.
In week nine, the Bears faced the Chargers, who have allowed the most fantasy points per game to opposing running backs.
I already felt good about the match-up, just because the Chargers suck. But my frame of reference for a good running back performance was set relative to Bell. I thought an outstanding week was 20 points, so imagine my school-girl squeals of glee when I checked my phone Tuesday morning to see that Langford raked in 22 points.
My dreamboy rushed for 72 yards on 18 carries, received three passes for 70 yards, and also scored one touchdown.
Then in week 10, I was cautious about raising my expectations too high in order to protect myself from  any further disappointment at the hands of my roster. Also because I didn’t write last week, I didn’t really do any research.
But then something beautiful and amazing happened. The Bears defeated the Rams 37–13, which meant big time action for Langford. My man rushed 73 yards, received for 109, and scored two touchdowns.
So basically he made all my wildest dreams come true. I was pretty confused that he had more receiving yards than rushing because I’m pretty sure wide receivers receive and running backs run, but I’ll take it.
I know Matt Forte is listed as questionable this weekend, and that means Langford is going to have to start sharing the work. Forte won’t be back at 100 percent just yet, and Langford has more than proven his ability to lead the show. The best case scenario for me is either the Bears decide that Langford is amazing and keep giving him more opportunities to be amazing, or Forte re-injures his MCL before it heals, and he doesn’t have a chance to come back.
But realistically, I don’t expect any more 20 point games out of Langford this season. I hope that I’ll still be able to count on him for double digits, but again, fantasy has broken my heart too many times, and I’m too hurt to hope.
On the topic of players I love, let’s talk about Brandon McManus. You may recall that I’ve said some borderline creepy things about my love for McManus. I also recently became keen on the performance of a kicker being fully dependent on the offense giving him opportunities to kick. Well, as luck would have it, the Broncos are not doing that well. They ended a seven-game winning streak with a two-game losing streak, meaning they are not giving McManus as many chances to win my highly conditional love on a weekly basis.
In week nine, McManus did make three extra points and one short range field goal, so he only scored six points. Not terrible, but not what I’ve come to expect from him. Then is week 10, you may have heard that Peyton Manning threw four interceptions and got benched. Then backup quarterback Brock Osweiler helped the Broncos come back with two touchdowns. On the first one, they attempted a two-point conversion and FAILED. On the second they finally wised up and let my hugely consistent McManus kick. He succeeded, but he only scored one fantasy point.
I’m hopeful that the stupid freaking Denver Broncos will get it together and #BringBrandonBack. Get it trending.
Except I don’t want them to succeed that much this week. They’re playing the Bears and I have a large stake in that match-up. Can they tie? Is that allowed? [ed. note: Yes.]
My biggest gripe right now is that I started Pierre Garcon and Nate Washington as wide receiver and flex because my only bench options were Dexter McCluster and Dwayne Harris. Why would I start them? They aren’t very good options. Rotowire told me that McCluster is only an option in deeper PPR formats but otherwise a dangerous start. I don’t know what that first part means, but I know that a dangerous start means “do not start.” They also said something about PPR for Harris, and I’m just too confused to care. So I started my normal starters.
So of course, Washington and Pierre scored a combined four points. The team of Harris/McCluster put up 22 points.
Even though I bested Team Illegal Touching 86–64, 104–64 sounds a lot nicer coming off the tongue.

​What has come to competitive track and field? On Friday Nov. 13, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) suspended the Russian track and field program from future participation in international competition following the discovery of state-sanctioned doping by the athletes.
Arguably the most condemning finding was that a Moscow drug lab in charge of Russian tests destroyed over 1,400 samples days before a regulatory visit by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). After WADA representatives asked that the samples be kept for their visit, the lab went ahead and destroyed all of them as part of a “clean up” of the work area.
The findings have the potential to lead to a widespread exposition of the corruption in international track and field, but for a few reasons this appears unlikely. Even if change is needed, it’s hard to imagine any big changes happening any time soon. The problem starts with internal resistance, where cheating athletes and corrupt higher ups will keep trying to maintain their cheating system.
​Athletes reported being told they needed to get rid of bad results (by paying) or face consequences. In many cases, athletes would make regular payments to the doping agencies to stay “clean.” Russian 800 meter runner Yuliya Stepanova said that Russian athletes would travel under fake identities to avoid random drug testing all track and field athletes are subject to. Many Russian athletes currently stand at risk of losing world championship and Olympic medals because of WADA’s discoveries.
Members of the IAAF were involved in the cover-up as well, with former president Liam Diack stepping down on November 10. Diack allegedly personally accepted bribes on multiple occasions in return for helping out with the doping cover-ups.
But the corruption doesn’t only come from the top level. Another reason a big cleanup isn’t coming soon is because all the most successful countries in track and field are probably involved. And if they’re involved, they won’t sponsor investigations or elect officials to the IAAF who would fix the situation.
Every competitive group is surrounded by questions, with problems ranging from non-compliant doping agencies in Kenya and Ethiopia to labs that don’t test their athletes at all in Jamaica. Jamaica is accused of only giving 1 random drug test over 20 months from 2012 and 2013, which of course included the Olympics.
Even the Americans are culprits, with leading distance runner Galen Rupp accused of abusing steroids and every other performance-enhancing drug in any way he can while staying under the radar. Rupp’s training partner Mo Farah, the top runner in the United Kingdom, brings another country into question.
In every case investigations appear to be ongoing, but no serious punishments have come out. Occasionally, some people resign, like some of the drug testers from Jamaica in 2013. We will never find out if Usain Bolt did anything wrong though. Of course, this isn’t surprising, since representatives from all of these questionable countries play a big role in choosing the IAAF representatives.
​So where does this leave track and field?
Many athletes view the shakeup as progress, but some, like Olympic middle distance runner Nick Willis believes the IAAF has a long way to go. Willis tweeted, “Russian athletes are not the sole perpetrators. Let’s hope they investigate all the major players non-complicit in doping control.”
​Full-scale investigations might not be enough. Willis suggests the corruption continues within the IAAF and that the organization’s new president, Sebastian Coe of the United Kingdom, is arguably no better than Diack. Coe has already drawn criticism for leaving the door open for Russia to participate in the upcoming Olympics and holding off individual bans for Russian athletes. Other athletes anticipated, at minimum, a multi-year ban on the Russian program.
​If this investigation doesn’t turn into the mass investigation that the track and field world needs, then what comes next? Even if organizations like the IAAF don’t take action, the WADA can continue its efforts to expose the cheating groups. Expositions like this one of Russia help show people what problems exist and might help bring other powers into the mix.
One suggestion is that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) take some kind of action against the IAAF. If the IOC opened up the possibility of banning track and field from the Olympics, the IAAF might be forced to fix itself.
​The scandal also helps open up the eyes of the public to the ongoing corruption. A damaged reputation for track and field drives away viewers and hurts sponsorships, which could bring change. It stands to be seen whether corporations like Nike (which sponsors Galen Rupp and his training team) will take action of their own, instead of risking being associated with the dirty players.
​Hopefully, someday everyone can view doping as a piece of history in track and field and have more arguments about whose records should count.

Recently, Disney Research and Carnegie Mellon University teamed up to create an interactive system that 3-D prints customized walking robots. With these new design tools, a user can pick the shape, size, and number of legs of the robot, and the system will ensure that the robot is capable of moving as desired, able to walk forward, sideways, and turn.
“Progress in rapid manufacturing technology is making it easier and easier to build customized robots, but designing a functioning robot remains a difficult challenge that requires an experienced engineer,” said Markus Gross, vice president of research for Disney Research and director of the Disney Research Zürich lab. “Our new design system can bridge this gap and should be of great interest to technology enthusiasts and the maker community at large.”
“We aim to reinvent the way in which personal robotic devices are designed, fabricated, and customized according to the individual needs and preferences of their users,” said Stelian Coros, an assistant professor of robotics at Carnegie Mellon who is a former Disney research scientist.
Bernhard Thomaszewski, a research scientist at Disney Research Zürich, also commented on the goals of the research, saying, “Our ambition is to make the design of compelling robotic creatures as accessible and intuitive as possible. Our tool allows the user to design the structure and motion of a robot while receiving immediate feedback on its expected real-world behavior.”
To use the system, a user uploads a skeletal sketch of the desired robot, and the system creates an initial geometric layout for the robot, complete with motors at each joint location. The design tools feature two viewports: one that allows the user to edit the robot’s structure and motion by adding or removing motors and adjusting their orientation, and another that allows the user to see how those edits actually change the robot’s behavior. The user can also edit the overall motion style of the robot by editing the trajectories for the robot’s legs directly along with the time-dependent position and orientation of the robot’s body, giving each robot a sense of personality and style.
As a part of their system, the researchers have developed an optimization method that relies on an approximate dynamics model to create stable walking motions and patterns for robots with multiple legs in just a few seconds by preserving locomotion stability. After the user completes the design process, the system automatically generates the 3-D geometry of all the parts of the robot, which can then be sent to a 3-D printer.
To test their system, the researchers designed and 3-D printed two four-legged robots, and they found that the robots’ movements were consistent with the predicted model and design.
“It took us minutes to design these creatures, but hours to assemble them and days to produce parts on 3-D printers,” Thomaszewski said. “The fact is that it is both expensive and time-consuming to build a prototype — which underscores the importance of a design system such as ours, which produces a final design without the need for building multiple physical iterations.”
In addition to Gross, Thomaszewski, and Coros, the research team included Vittorio Megaro and Otmar Hilliges of ETH Zürich and Maurizio Nitti of the Disney Research Zürich lab. The research team presented the system at SIGGRAPH Asia 2015, the ACM Conference on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques, in Kobe, Japan.

Two researchers in Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute have developed Explorable Visual Analytics (EVA) to change the way people visualize and find patterns in large data sets, as well as share their findings. 
Saman Amirpour Amraii, a senior system/software engineer in Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute, and Amir Yahyavi, a post-doctoral researcher in Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute, both of the CREATE Lab in Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute, created EVA, an online platform for “visualizing and analyzing large and high-dimensional data that allows users to intuitively navigate terabytes of data consisting of hundreds of dimensions,” Amraii said. “Users can build simple geographical representations or complex, abstract, 5-dimensional projections of the data. They can also bookmark their favorite views and share the entire exploration and discovery process via a simple link.”
Nowadays, our world is facing a big data challenge. We collect data from a multitude of sources — from cell phone screens to aerospace monitors, from demography to the retail industry. In a world crowded with information, people are forced to find a way to organize and analyze this data in a relatively short time period. 
Currently, the most used software for data organization and analysis is Excel, which was designed in a time when datasets were small and easily stored on personal computers. Nowadays, even modern personal computers cannot store large datasets such as those from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program, which takes up millions of rows and approximately hundreds of gigabytes. 
In order to process data of this sort in a traditional manner, users would need a cluster or super computer. Moreover, they would need the programming skills to successfully handle these datasets and a large amount of time to process everything, which is unrealistic and inefficient. The development of EVA, however, attempts to bridge these gaps by providing users with an online platform that allows for a new method of data visualization and analysis that can handle large datasets without these traditional setbacks.
Amraii describes EVA as a powerful tool that makes the analysis of huge datasets as easy as the analysis of small sets using Excel. The main benefit of EVA lies in the fact that it’s a web-based tool, meaning that the bulk of the data can be stored in an external network, with users only downloading the portion of the data that is being analyzed. 
In this way, EVA “give[s] users the illusion they are working with all of a massive dataset while actually sending only a small proportion of the data to the client,” Yahyavi said in a university press release. If data is displayed on a map, for instance, users can zoom in on an area of interest and EVA will only process the data relevant to that particular portion of the map, effectively reducing the large dataset into a smaller, more manipulable set of data. This freedom allows users to “play” with data by quickly adjusting parameters and graphic displays. The researchers noted that speed was the main focus for EVA. 
“The system has to be fast,” Amraii said in a university press release. “If it takes a half hour to get an answer to your query, you may forget why you asked in the first place.”
Another benefit of EVA is that it provides more possibilities for data exploration. Users can easily find underlying correlations by incorporating additional parameters such as yearly income or ethnic group. By setting time constraints from several years ago to current time, users can visualize growing or declining trends.
EVA also promotes collaboration by enabling self-explanatory storytelling. Users are able to record their findings by taking a screenshot of the high resolution visual map of the data they produced. Additionally, the bookmark feature allows a user to share a set of their findings with another collaborator via a URL. The collaborator can then trace all the steps the user took before they came to the final result to see what paths the initial user took.
EVA was developed by Amraii and Yahyavi, along with staff members in the CREATE Lab, and took nearly three years to develop. The online platform has a promising future in many fields such as in business, where EVA can help analyze massive amounts of sales information. EVA will allow users to upload numeric big data sets, analyze them, and tell their unique story to the world. EVA will expand our collective ability to utilize big data by making it easy for everyone, with or without computer science and statistics knowledge, to effectively analyze big data.

The Human-Computer Interaction Institute hosted a talk last Friday, Nov. 20, by Samantha Kleinberg, an associate professor of computer science at the Stevens Institute of Technology, which focused on her current research efforts in medical data collection.
Kleinberg’s research focuses on “observation, not experimentation,” due to the ethical and feasibility concerns inherent in testing diseases and medicine. In her talk, Kleinberg noted that massive amounts of data within public health records, ICU data streams, and other data sets, are not as strong as they could be, which affects the viability of observational research. 
Kleinberg explained that there is a lot of error in experimental data, which comes from a multitude of causes.
For example, data is often omitted from records for various reasons, such as instrument malfunction or human error. Individual diagnoses are also flawed measurements, in a predictive sense, because they are only measurements of when the disease was recognized by a doctor, not a timeline of the actual damage, say, to the heart due to heart disease. Other measurements, such as insurance tags for diseases, are also inaccurate, because the codes are often approximated, featuring only what the insurance company covers, which may or may not be what the patient has.
Kleinberg noted that studying methods of data collection could improve the way researchers use data to determine the cause of diseases. 
“I don’t want to know that smoking causes cancer,” Kleinberg said. “I want to know the timeframe; what effect does smoking for ten years versus five have? What dosage of cigarettes?” 
This very specific way of thinking about data is what guides Kleinberg and her research. Her studies revolve around chronic diseases such as diabetes, where most of the treatment is self-administered, which is why the specificity of data accumulation is so important. Data for these types of diseases is largely only recorded episodically when a patient visits a hospital, but Kleinberg and her team were interested in monitoring patients in a more universal manner, in an effort to optimize self-care processes.
To do this, Kleinberg and her team focused their efforts on one specific scenario and looked at how to collect data about eating. They specifically studied ways to record eating beyond self-report, which introduces a lot of human error. To do this, the team investigated the use of multiple body-worn sensors to track chewing, moving food to the mouth with the hands, swallowing, and many other actions. The set-up was very detailed, consisting of movement sensors on the wrists, the head, a microphone earbud within the aural canal, a scale under the plate of food, alongside video cameras. In this way, they hoped to gain a more universal and less error-prone view of this process.
Kleinberg spoke about the sheer amount of time it took to track all of the data, which involved tasks such as tracking chews and annotating the video alongside sound data. While tedious, the collection of this specific, precise data provides a much more detailed depiction of a situation that, Kleinberg argues, has the potential to be beneficial. While this process may seem trivial to the untrained eye, future researchers might be able to use this highly accurate information in productive ways. 
“The ultimate goal is an artificial pancreas,” Kleinberg said. Kleinberg explained that a patient with an artificial pancreas today needs to do a lot of work to support the device. Highly specific, accurate data could allow researchers to modify current artificial options to eliminate this work on the patient’s side and introduce a sort of automatic treatment.
The prospects of Kleinberg’s project, including triumph in the treatment of chronic illness, are great. Her ideas about data collection offer a novel perspective of how research should be conducted, and how data should be analyzed. 
These suggestions, when put into practice, could reinvent the data collection process and lead to various discoveries, including improved treatment options for those with chronic illness. Until then, however, it’s just a matter of tracking the chews.

What if we could eradicate diseases by permanently modifying mosquitoes? What if we could permanently modify humans to accomplish a similar goal?
Last Thursday, Pugwash discussed “gene drives,” processes that modify the DNA of not just the specific organism targeted, but also all future generations, often with close to 100 percent success rate. The first successful instance was changing the color of fruit flies from brown to blonde. Although this may not seem particularly important, it could pave the way to changing genes that allow mosquitoes to carry malaria or West Nile Virus, among others.
Gene drives aren’t just limited to insects, though. Changing genes permanently, for an organism and all its offspring, is something that could be done to any creature, theoretically, using a similar method. Plants that produce their own pesticides or animals that become poisonous to invasive species could be released into the wild, where the changed genes would quickly propagate throughout natural populations.
The idea is that this population-wide modification could solve population-wide problems. However, this comes with a danger: Is changing an entire population’s genetics a good thing? Can we predict the outcomes well enough to know that we won’t be introducing something even worse than what we already have? Gene drive is easy to spread, but on the flip side, it’s hard to combat if something goes awry.
Gene drives are powerful because they are permanent, and that’s the double-edged sword. Modifying genetics is so complex that there will almost always be complications. Also, there are concerns that unwanted mutations could hitch a ride with the gene drive, making their chances at inheritance close to perfect as well. Before implementing gene drives in the wild, we have to weigh the risks of the unknown outcomes against the known risks of malaria, or whatever else the gene drive is supposed to be combating.
Currently, all organisms modified this way are kept tightly under lock and key, but as far as Pugwash could tell, that’s solely out of the diligence of the researchers. Perhaps there should be some more detailed government oversight, but as with all new technologies, the government usually has trouble keeping up. The lack of regulations and protections does raise some concerns of bio-terrorism via gene drives, but most experts seem to think that there are cheaper, easier, and flashier ways of committing terrorism.
One kind of drive has been proposed that would reverse a previous one. Although unlikely, this has the potential to support the modification of populations’ genes preemptively to stop another modification, or the reversal and re-doing of gene drives, by competing factions.
Finally, one of the major things to consider about gene drives is the possibility of using them on humans. Would it be ethical to send a gene drive through the human population that made people less susceptible to cancer or other diseases with genetic causes? The effects of the gene drive would last for generations, and it would be impossible to receive informed consent from every individual affected, but the potential for eliminating certain diseases is a powerful draw.
And gene drives wouldn’t only have the potential to cure cancer. They could be used for cosmetic improvements, such as skin color or eye color, or any other genetically determined factors. 
One Pugwash member was adamant that these sorts of gene drives should not be available, as they would only increase the distance between the haves and have nots. Those with enough money would buy the better genetic modifications, which would carry down through any children they had, moving that family up the ladder in terms of privileges. Whereas those who can’t afford the improvements — and the future generations of their families — would be stuck with the less-desirable genetic traits.
However, there was some push-back against this. If it’s an available technology, and someone wants to pay for it, shouldn’t they be allowed to? Aren’t gene drives just one more technology in a long history of ways the privileged hold on to their power and the poor merely scrape by? But just because that’s the way it’s always been doesn’t mean it should be the way it always is.
Student Pugwash is a non-advocacy, educational organization that discusses the implications of science. This article is a summary of last week’s discussion on gene drives.

Smell: It’s one of the five senses that you probably took for granted, until you came down with a case of this year’s cold. Unfortunately, when you drink a hot bowl of homemade soup, your severe nasal congestion prevents you from inhaling the delicious aroma. Furthermore, you lament your inability to taste your favorite, cold-weather treat.
So how does smell work? According to howstuffworks.com, smell is a chemical sense. You are able to detect odor when airborne molecules are given off by some source and float into the top of your nasal passage. Once they reach a small patch of thin mucus lining, the odor molecules come into contact with nerve cells called olfactory receptors. On the tip of the olfactory receptors are hair-like projections called cilia, which can bind to the odorants.
The binding event triggers signals that get passed along bundles of small nerve fibers, called axons, which make up the olfactory nerve. The signals are processed once they reach the olfactory bulb, a structure located in the forebrain. Afterwards, the information becomes transmitted to other parts of the brain, activating the sensation of smell. 
The more concentrated the odor, the greater the signals being relayed into the olfactory bulb from the receptors. In humans, there are about 12 million olfactory receptor cells, which possess the ability to detect about 10,000 odors.
Scientists have discovered the mechanism by which the brain differentiates and memorizes the many odors we encounter. 
In 2004, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Richard Axel and Linda Buck, who discovered that each olfactory receptor cell is genetically encoded to respond to a particular set of odors. Furthermore, their research showed that receptors send impulses to particular regions in the olfactory bulbs, known as glomeruli. They claimed that our brain’s interpretation of the activity in the thousands of different glomeruli allows us to sense a variety of odors.
Axel and Buck’s research was challenged, however, by biophysicist Luca Turin. He developed a theory that it was the quantum vibrations of the atoms in the odor molecules, rather than the shape of those molecules, that allow humans to detect an almost endless list of odors.
Regardless of how smell is actually brought about, scientists have been the most fascinated by the way smell is linked to our memories and emotions, which are associated with a  part of the brain called the limbic system. 
A component within the limbic system, the olfactory bulb is linked to areas of the brain responsible for processing emotion as well as for learning. Your brain is responsible for making the link between a smell and an event. Hence, people are able to use smell to jog their memories.
Besides memory, smell has also been found to enhance our sense of taste. 70 to 75 percent of what we taste actually comes from our sense of smell. 
So when you are experiencing nasal congestion, thick mucus linings in your nasal passages are preventing odor molecules from binding with your olfactory receptor cells. In turn, the olfactory bulbs are hampered in their ability to process smell. 
Additionally, smell can play an essential role in our survival. The unpleasant odor of fire or rotten food can prompt us to avoid potential danger.
While our ability to smell is considered to be one of our most primal senses, its complexities and significant role in our well-being is often overlooked.

New software simulates physical sensations
The Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Lab at the Hasso Plattner Institute in Germany recently created a prototype a boxing game called Impacto, which is designed to simulate real-life physical sensations associated with boxing. The technology includes an armband that uses haptic feedback, which provides responses based on the sense of touch, as well as electrodes attached to the user’s bicep to simulate muscle contraction. In order for Impacto to work, the user must wear a special headset that connects to the armband the user wears. 
During the game, when the computer opponent lands a punch, the software in the game sends an electrical impulse to the armband and electrodes. The impulse in the armband delivers a physical tap to the user’s arm, while the impulse in the electrodes simultaneously causes the bicep muscles to contract and swing back. 
The result simulates the action-reaction forces that occur when a boxer is actually hit in the arm. While this technology is limited in its application now, Patrick Baudisch, the head of the HCI Lab at the Hasso Plattner Institute, believes Impacto has laid the groundwork for “a vision for post-wearable technology.”

Laptop designed to search for life in outer space
NASA is currently developing a prototype for a chemical laptop that can be sent into space to analyze samples found by researchers in search of life. Some of the predominant building blocks for life are amino acids and fatty acids, both of which make other molecules in the body such as proteins and cell membranes. Astronauts hope to use this laptop to find potential building blocks of life on planets such as Mars. 
The laptop works by first heating a solid sample into a liquid and then mixing it with a fluorescent dye chemically designed to stick to amino or fatty acids. The sample then flows through a separation channel in which amino and fatty acids can be separated from one another. The sample finally passes through a detection laser that analyzes the sample composition to determine if it contains any fatty or amino acids.
The goal of the project is to make a portable instrument that can be practically used in space exploration. The convenience of the device could lead to better space exploration in search of life.
The laptop was tested at the JPL’s Mars Yard last year and will now be tested in the Atacama Desert in Chile.

NASA makes plan to put astronauts on Mars
NASA seeks to put astronauts on Mars by 2030, and it recently developed a plan of action. While the physical distance between Earth and Mars is a challenge in itself, there are many other complications that arise, such as “budgetary changes, political priorities, new scientific discoveries, [and] technological breakthroughs,” according to William Gerstenmaier, associate administrator for Human Exploration and Operations at NASA. 
To address these issues, NASA has had astronauts continuously cycle through six-month intervals living aboard the International Space Station since 2000. This project is helping astronauts and technical staff understand what kind of architecture and instrumentation they need aboard spacecraft, as well as the health issues associated with prolonged time in space.
By the early 2020s, NASA hopes to start moving into deep-space habitation by sending astronauts into orbit around the moon. By doing so, scientists can test the theories they believe will make prolonged space exploration possible, while also keeping the astronauts relatively close to Earth in the event a serious issue arises.

Researchers find gene patterns in genetic diseases
Every person’s brain is unique, yet researchers at the Allen Institute claim they have identified a small set of molecular patterns in the brain that dominate gene expression. Researchers studied six different brains, focusing on hundreds of distinct brain regions in each. They determined what genes in each brain had the most consistent expression patterns across all six, and then compared the genes to each other and brain functionality to find underlying relationships and similarities.
Researchers found that while the genome contains over 20,000 genes, most of their expression can be characterized in only 32 patterns. They additionally found that the genes that were most consistent across the brains included genes that are linked to genetic diseases such as autism and Alzheimer’s. Understanding the underlying molecular patterns make up these disease genes can lead to developing better therapeutic treatment for attacking them.
The research, which could help develop target therapeutics for various diseases, was published this month in Nature Neuroscience.

Supernova millions of light-years away affects our galaxy
New Scientist recently published an article discussing the explosion of a star into a supernova that occurred millions of light-years away. A supernova is particular kind of aftermath of a star after it collapses into itself due to a disproportionate mass to volume ratio. A supernova causes radiation and mass to be emitted from the star at very high energies. The energy associated with these byproducts allow them to traverse great distances across space, and in the case of this particular supernova one of these products, a nucleus of iron, is reaching our atmosphere.
The ability for these byproducts to travel such great distances at such high speed relies on the energy released from the explosion of a star. Cosmic explosions can occur at temperatures up to 100 million Kelvin, which provides an exorbitant amount of energy to the atomic nuclei propelled from them. 
Additionally, at such high temperatures, atoms within the star collide and fuse together, adding heat and energy to the explosion. It is this total energy input that allows the atomic nuclei ejected from the explosion to reach near-light velocities and enter into our atmosphere.

App designed to help rehabilitate stroke patients
Several months ago, faculty at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, including John Krakauer,a professor of neurology and neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, released a game called Bandit’s Shark Showdown, which is designed to help rebuild muscle coordination for stroke victims. The game uses an electronic sling that syncs the user’s movements with that of a dolphin in the game, who must fend away the attacks of sharks. 
Every creature in the game, though, contains an intricate skeleton system visible to the user whose movements in the game correlate to real musculoskeletal motions. The game teaches those who use it how to make controlled body movements, which can be difficult for someone who has suffered from a stroke. Additionally, the game can track rehabilitation of stroke victims by gauging how they improve in the game over time. 
The developers hope that the game will help stroke victims through rehabilitation while simultaneously making it more interactive. The lab will continue this project and hopes to expand into the 3-D printing of assistive rehabilitation devices.

I don’t like the holiday season. I dread the six-hour drive home for Thanksgiving, I can’t stand snow, and I change the station when a Christmas song comes on the radio. Still, I go to Pittsburgh’s Light Up Night every year.
Last Friday, the city celebrated the beginning of the holiday season with lights, ice sculptures, food trucks, local music, and this year’s headliner, JoJo. I can’t name a single JoJo song off the top of my head, but I appreciate her B-list roles in family classics like RV and Aquamarine, and the nostalgic touch she brings to a night of holiday magic.
I took a bus downtown and arrived around 6 p.m., right as they lit the tree at One Oxford Centre. During Light Up Night, as you might gather from its name, the city lights all of the Christmas trees downtown. The last tree to be lit is the Highmark Unity Tree at 7 p.m., accompanied by rooftop fireworks.
I spent some time wandering through Market Square, which was transformed into a village of pop-up shops and holiday kitsch, and got dinner from one of the food trucks parked on Smithfield Street. There were trucks from Nakama, BRGR, Franktuary, and other like restaurants — all delicious choices — but I ultimately ended up with a burrito from a Mexican food truck, because it had the shortest line.
As I ate my burrito, I caught snatches of local Pittsburgh performers The Stickers, three brothers with Western Pennsylvania flair. I waited in line to see the “Winter Garden” at PPG place, where I harshly critiqued the gingerbread houses built by local schoolchildren and Girl Scout troops, and learned about Christmas traditions across the world.
After putzing around the Winter Garden and Market Square some more, it was time to get in place to see the woman, the myth, the legend: JoJo. JoJo played from a stage in the middle of the Roberto Clemente Bridge, against the dramatic backdrop of the PNC Park and Heinz Field. I didn’t arrive quite early enough, which meant that I saw and heard her from across the bridge, about 300 yards away. Although it’s impressive (and characteristic of Pittsburgh) that the stage is set up on the Clemente Bridge, it’s a bit of a logistical nightmare. The curve of the bridge, for example, made it difficult to see the stage unless you were packed in at the front.
JoJo took a little too long to come out after opener and Mount Lebanon native Daya, who sang her radio hit “Hideaway.” After the crowd shivered (literally, because it was freezing) with anticipation for a while, JoJo took the stage and opened with the 2004 classic “Baby It’s You.”
JoJo also sang the decade-old hits “Leave, Get Out” and “Too Little, Too Late,” which made me realize that maybe I did know a little bit of her music. JoJo looked good, still young at 24 — her 2004 hit singles are all the more impressive when you know that she was only 13 when they were recorded. She also performed her new song “When Love Hurts,” and finished out her brief set with a Christmas song, lending it the emotional weight and holiday cheer that only JoJo could. Her performance could have been a little longer, but I do think she gave a better performance than last year’s show from the now defunct pop-dance band Cobra Starship.
An hour after the performance, there were fireworks launched from the Andy Warhol Bridge. As the temperature dropped — it was now around 9:30 p.m., and below freezing — I found a perfect vantage point on the waterfront by the Point. I want to make one thing clear: I love fireworks. I love them. I don’t know why, but pyrotechnics never fail to put me in an emotionally vulnerable place, so I was particularly excited for this part of the evening.
Light Up Night always features a pretty good fireworks show, and this year’s did not disappoint. I ended the show teary-eyed, imbibing deeply in Pittsburgh’s holiday spirit in spite of myself. Maybe it was because it’s my senior year and my last Light Up Night in Pittsburgh, but this year’s festivities hit a good balance of Pittsburgh charm, holiday magic, and winning performances.

Jane Haskell was a valued member of the Pittsburgh art community before her passing on May 28, 2013. She was an artist, collector, museum donor, and lover of Modernism. This was reflected in all aspects of Jane’s life from her personal work, to her house, to her and husband Ed Haskell’s vast art collection. Even her home was designed to be a work of modern art. The Carnegie Museum of Art is currently housing Jane Haskell’s Modernism, an exhibit that not only showcases her works, but the works of those she loved and by whom she was inspired.
The first works shown upon entering the exhibit are sketches of the Haskell household done by architect Herbert Seigle. I found it interesting that sketches of the home were included, because it showed that the house that she lived in was a work of art itself. Specially designed for the Haskell family, the architecture of the house featured several geometric shapes and lines that were often reflected in Haskell’s own work. In addition to being itself a work of art, Haskell’s home was also filled with works of art, including some of her own. One of the most notable was a work that utilized rope and straight neon lights to create straight lines and geometric shapes. Haskell seemed to have a particular affection for this piece over her other string and neon compositions, as she had this piece displayed in her foyer. As someone who has very little knowledge of modern art, I found something almost familiar and comforting about this piece. Maybe it was the straight lines that formed familiar shapes or the stark contrast of the neon lights against the white background, but there was something about the simplicity of this piece that made it impossible to look away.
Among other works featured was a series of drawings that illustrate fluorescent works done by Dan Flavin. These drawings feature several straight lines and geometric shapes, a theme that by this point in the exhibit seems very familiar and very integral to Haskell’s art collection. These etchings were my favorite thing in the exhibit not created by Haskell herself. Flavin was able to reproduce the amount of depth found in a three-dimensional light fixture in a two dimensional drawing. As a pioneer in light sculpture, Flavin’s work heavily influenced Haskell. One image of his that particularly stuck out to me featured two different views of the same sculpture giving an overall perspective of how the work would be seen depending on where it was viewed from. I appreciated this not only for its comprehensive view, but for how such simple shapes could make a light show come to life off of a piece of paper.
Another one of Haskell’s pieces that was featured was a work entitled Alphabet II, which depicts several oil-painted letters on a canvas. This work was said to be an homage to Jasper Johns, a postwar artist that layered letters and numbers on his paintings in the late 1950s. This piece explored Haskell’s interest to investigating color. Much of Haskell’s art was more about experimentation with different themes rather than evoking an emotion from the viewer. I found this piece rather difficult to look at because my eyes kept jumping all around the canvas. This was much different that her light installations, which featured such clean lines always directing my focus towards one spot. However, this piece showed how vast Haskell’s artistic interests were, ranging from sculpting to painting and almost having no overlap between the two mediums.
Jane Haskell lived a life full of art. Whether it was her home, her creations, or her collection, she saw the world through rose-colored glasses tinted by the Modernism of the art with which she surrounded herself. I’ve never understood modern art, but her light installations didn’t need to be understood. They weren’t secrets waiting to be unlocked, they were just art at face value. Seeing this collection of works that influenced her made it much easier to understand her art. While all of her art wasn’t the most original work, you could see so much of her love for other artists’ work shine through in them. Haskell made the Pittsburgh art community a little brighter through more than just her art, and without her, Pittsburgh has surely lost a little bit of its light.

Rapper and hip-hop MC Daniel Dewan Swell, known by his stage name Danny Brown, performed this past Saturday night in Carnegie Mellon’s annual fall concert, hosted by the Activities Board. Danny Brown is a performer from Detroit, Michigan, and has been on the music scene since 2003. He is best known for popular collaborations with Purity Ring, Schoolboy Q, and Vampire Weekend. He has released several successful EPs, and his debut, XXX, received critical acclaim. It wasn’t until the release of Old, however, that Danny Brown truly entered into the spotlight.
The doors to the concert opened around seven o-clock, and people slowly started to file into the Wiegand Gymnasium. Either the level of excitement in the room was very minimal, or there were just not as many attendees as there seemed to be at previous Carnegie Mellon fall concerts, but something seemed slightly off about the overall vibe within the crowd. Nevertheless, I put all that behind me and looked forward to the concert in high hopes: I was determined to have a good time.
Opening for Danny Brown was Ratking, a punk-rock inspired hip-hop group from New York City. Ratking, whose current touring members are rappers Wiki, Hak, Sporting Life, released their first hip-hop EP, 700 Fill, in 2011. The group has since then been known for several Wu-Tang Clan inspired tracks and a number of concert performances along side popular rapper Earl Sweatshirt.
Ratking kicked off the concert with a lot of strong energy. The crowd bounced along to the music and fed off of each other’s high energy. It seemed as though everyone, whether they had any previous exposure to Ratking’s music or not, was having a great time.
I wish I could say the group kept the audience’s enthusiasm up, but it seemed as though after a while, Ratking lost a lot of steam. The dancing, arm waving, fist-pumping and miscellaneous concert activity died down a great deal, and the general excitement level declined. There was a moment of collective energy loss as everyone waited around for headliner Danny Brown to begin his set. Luckily, the audience wasn’t left waiting for too long. Danny Brown took the stage shortly after the hype had died down, and he successfully managed to reestablish the excitement in the room.
In the days leading up to the concert, I tried to better prepare myself as a Danny Brown concertgoer and learn some of the words to at least his most popular songs. Despite myself — and more than a few others — not knowing the words to the majority of the songs, there was an overall upbeat, positive vibe in the room, which I was pleased to see.
Danny Brown sang “Smokin’ & Drinkin’, ” which significantly increased the crowd’s hype level. This was the first of his singles that he sang and is one of his most popular songs to date. During his set, he sang several songs off of his album Old as well as a couple songs off of his debut album The Hybrid. In the middle of the set, he sang an audience favorite, “25 Bucks.” It was refreshing to hear the crowd chanting and singing along to the lyrics, after the stream of songs that I, among many others, did not know.
After about half an hour, the concert reentered that odd stage of being sort of excited and kind of mellow, due to the fact that not many people knew all of Danny Brown’s songs. His popular song, “Dip,” came just in time, launching the crowd back into a high-energy state — the screaming, singing, and jumping resumed.
To Danny Brown’s credit, he seemed to be aware of the audience for which he was performing, which is always nice to see in a performer. The placement of the songs supported a general flow of excitement throughout the entire concert; the mix of popular hits and throwback songs was well thought-out. Just as the crowd would die down, a popular hit would pull everyone back in and have the crowd bouncing up and down once more, fist-pumping into the air, the floor of Wiegand Gym doing its best to support the collective pounding.
The concert was winding down, and my opinions on the performance at that time were generally positive. Both the crowd and the performers seemed to be having a great time, and everyone was dancing and singing along. Suddenly, Danny Brown shouted the classic “Thank you, Pittsburgh!” and quickly exited the stage. There was hardly a transition between the song-ending to stage-exiting.
Despite the oddity of Danny Brown’s exit, the crowd waited in anticipation for an encore song or two, which we all collectively assumed was soon to come. The audience dissipated slightly, but there was still a respectable amount of onlookers chanting “Danny! Danny! Encore! Encore!” After about ten minutes of a background DJ playing random remixes of popular music, the DJ unplugged his mic and gave an awkward wave to the front row. Was that really it? It seemed odd that there was no encore, but perhaps that just wasn’t Danny Brown’s style. I checked the time on my phone. 9:15. Danny Brown had barely performed for 40 minutes.
Slowly but surely, everyone in the crowd realized that there was not going to be an encore. People left the gym, the majority of them in some sort of awkward, post-concert confusion. It felt like the concert equivalent of a cliffhanger, and it was hard to comprehend how abruptly the performance transitioned from maximum energy to nothing at all.
All in all, Danny Brown gave an exciting performance that had the crowd throwing fists into the air, singing along to popular hits, and literally rocking the floor of Wiegand Gym with intense raving and dancing. Unfortunately, it’s likely the awkwardly curt ending of Danny Brown’s performance will be the thing most of the audience most readily remembers.

Suicide Squad producer comments on upcoming film
The DC Cinematic Universe is just getting started. We’ve seen Man of Steel, which was a great start to opening up the universe, but we’re still in the early stages. We’re still unsure about what this world is going to look like. We’ve seen the Nolan Batman trilogy, and a few trailers, but it is a real flip of the coin as to whether or not audiences will flock to these films the same way they do for Marvel films. The major trailer for Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice has been heralded as one of the best trailers in years, and the film looks like it will be spectacular. DC and Warner Bros. have also released the first trailer for director David Ayer’s (Fury, End of Watch) Suicide Squad. The trailer doesn’t stack up to BvS, but the tone and intertwining story match up brilliantly. Producer Charles Roven sat down with entertainment news website Collider to discuss Suicide Squad and revealed that the film would push the PG-13 rating to the edge
“We really want to make these films tonally consistent so that, as I said because this is a shared universe, at least our current thinking — and again, we’re not dealing in absolutes because while this is business it’s also a creative endeavor, so you want to leave yourself open to changing your mind, doing something different, being inspired. That’s the whole process of filmmaking is, you have to allow for inspiration as well as having a road map for what you’re gonna do. So our plan right now is to make all these films PG-13. In some cases, you know, right there on the edge of PG-13, but still PG-13.”
Roven also spoke about Jared Leto’s Joker and how his methods only enhanced the positive attitudes on set. “Look, you know, it was different, it was fun. The group first wasn’t sure because the AD’s had to call him ‘Mr. J’ to get him to come to the set. And he did in many ways isolate himself from the rest of the group, but that’s really what his character was, the purpose of his character in many ways, other than when he was with Harley or trying to get Harley. It was very entertaining, it was fuel for a lot of good sport and a lot of laughs, and his isolation bonded the squad, and we wanted the squad bonded.”
Suicide Squad stars Jared Leto, Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Joel Kinnaman, Jai Courtney, Cara Delevigne, and Viola Davis, and is scheduled for release on August 5, 2016.
Ant-Man star Michael Douglas talks about a sequel
Ant-Man was not on audiences’ radar screen during the summer blockbuster season. Die hard comic fans know the character and were the first in line to see the film starring Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, and Michael Douglas as Dr. Hank Pym. Since the critical and widespread success of the film, Marvel has announced Ant-Man and the Wasp for a July 6, 2018 release. Douglas spoke to Collider expressing his anticipation to return to the character:
“I just got a call recently — they want to negotiate for a sequel and I thought, ‘That’s great!’ Hopefully, I won’t have to carry quite as much expositional dialogue as the first one, but I had a wonderful time doing it. Just a great, great time. The cast was fantastic. Paul, Evangeline, Michael Peña — I’m sure he’ll be back. If they can scrape Corey Stoll off the wall, I’m sure they’ll want him too — he’s such a good villain. And [director] Peyton (Reed) too. It was a lovely experience, so you know, I welcome it. I chuckle about being involved with a movie that already has a release date in 2018. Ya know, it’s hard to conceive of that, but it’s all good, all the way around, it’s all good.”
Michael Douglas was one of multiple high points of the film, and having him back for the sequel is essential. Dr. Hank Pym created the Ant-Man suit and worked with Howard Stark at the birth of S.H.I.E.L.D. Retaining the world-class talent of Douglas means securing a strong secondary cast to The Avengers and strengthening the backdrop of the story.
Universal Studios develops monster universe with classic creatures
Universal Studios, in the “Golden Age of Hollywood,” was built on the backs of its monsters. Frankenstein, The Mummy, The Creature From the Black Lagoon, and Dracula exist under the same umbrella but have never shared a screen. With studios racking their brains to create shared cinematic universes, like Marvel or DC Comics, Universal has taken a page from the book and, one could say, developed a “monster mash.” They have brought Alex Kurtzman (Transformers) and Chris Morgan (Furious 7) to lead a team of writers and producers to mix the creatures together and modernize the classic films while maintaining the original charm that built the studio giant.
In an interview with Variety, the creative team explained the plan. “This is not a heightened world,” Morgan said. “We’re exploring issues of family identity and questions of, ‘Where do I belong in the world?’”
Donna Langley, chair of Universal Pictures said, “the characters will interact with each other across movies. We’re incubating it at the moment, and we’re taking the time to get it right.”
“We’re creating a mythology, so we’re looking at this canon and thinking, ‘What are the rules?’ ” Kurtzman said. “What can we break and what are the ones that are untouchable?”
The plan is to release a new monster movie every year. The first, based on The Mummy, will begin shooting in early 2016, with productions centered on Dracula, Van Helsing, Bride of Frankenstein and the Wolfman following. Kurtzman and Morgan were heavily inspired by early Universal monster flicks starring Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi, so involving talent that has a nostalgic reaction to the characters they are creating is all good for Universal.

I was an unlikely candidate for the Washington Semester Program, but a set of perfect circumstances and timing allowed me to head for the nation’s capital at the beginning of this semester. I set off from home with starry-eyed visions of the Capitol, the White House, the various monuments, and the history that would surround me. In my mind’s eye, I could see myself purposefully walking around an imposing office building, looking important, just like I had seen in all of the political dramas I had binge-watched over the summer. The realities of Washington did not meet my expectations (I still haven’t seen Olivia Pope or Frank Underwood), but in some respects, they have exceeded them.
I expected that looking nice every day would be fun and easy. In my pre-Washington daydreams, I saw myself as the serious and put-together young professional by day and the smartly dressed tourist by night (and weekend). In reality, I found that dressing up and looking nice every day is hard work. It takes serious commitment to wake up every morning and actually take the time to look nice before leaving the house. Not only is looking tasteful and professional a requirement of the job, but also of the city. Washington is what I like to call a “catalog city.” Walking down the street on any given day, I feel like I am inside a high-end magazine photo shoot. Every person who passes by looks like a model. They all look like they know exactly what is going on, and they are all rushing around, too important to smile at any passing stranger. Although not the friendliest city during rush hour, it’s thrilling to look around and realize that most everyone around you is trying to influence policy and law.
Before arriving, I also expected that my internship would be fast-paced, with a starchy supervisor focused on getting things moved through the bureaucratic chain. The reality is that government is slow, despite the hard work and long hours of federal employees. Everything that is written or produced on behalf of my office’s independent advisory committee must be double, triple, and quadruple checked by other interns, our supervisor, and key committee members before it even goes to the subcommittee. The amount of scrutiny these products go through does help ensure that all interests are represented in the most effective way and that the information put forth accurately portrays those interests, but the time and amount of research done to do the work can be daunting and slow. While my office is not fast-paced, my expectations were far exceeded by the reality of my overall work environment. I work in the imposing, old-style building that I had envisioned. (It is so nice, in fact, that Donald Trump bought the building directly across the street.) Also, people at work are very friendly and welcoming. I have found that most people are very willing to talk, offer insight, and help.
My initial excitement about D.C. was because of the expectation that I would get to be a tourist for almost four whole months. The reality has been much better than that. Not only have I gotten to be an almost-local tourist, I have also been able to do things that I never imagined. I have attended talks and question and answer sessions with Supreme Court Justices, been to a Congressional hearing, heard the Head of Communications for UN High Commissioner for Refugees speak about the Syrian Refugee Crisis, and more. I never would have dreamed of having these opportunities before coming here. There is always so much that can be experienced here at any given moment. It can be overwhelming at times, but it has been incredible to absorb all of these events.
The one place where my expectation met reality is in networking. In the few months that I have spent here, I have probably heard the word “networking” more often than I had in all my previous years. Washington is essentially built on it. At most events and after work, networking is expected. It can feel very artificial at times, but it has exposed me to new ideas and possibilities that I would not have otherwise known of.
While my expectations and the realities of what D.C. had to offer did not meet in the middle, it has still been an incredible experience getting to know the city for what it is. I have enjoyed being a tourist and learning entirely new things. While the Washington Semester Program has not been without its challenges, I am glad that I have had this opportunity to be here.

Lord of the Flies, a stage adaptation of William Golding’s original 1954 namesake classic, finds itself in a unique position. On one side, it has the magnificent material of the original to stand on the shoulders of. The bleakly poetic and exposition-heavy source material lends itself exceptionally well to the stage. On the other hand, it has to deal with the weight of expectation that comes with adapting such a well-worn and widely read classic.
The adaptation presents a very close take on the original story through a compelling new lens. Script-wise, the deviations from the original are few and far between. The underlying allegory of the original is well conveyed, as strong as ever. The creative liberties that are taken are in how the story is presented to the audience, through some highly unusual set and sound design.
Creator Niger Williams and director Caden Manson make the argument that the ‘terrible disease of being human’ of which Golding wrote about in 1954 is even more relevant today. In the age of social media and instant headlines, the extreme attention-grabbing tendencies of violence, chaos and power have taken an even greater centre stage in our collective psyche. This strategy of using classic words to make a new argument is decidedly high risk. On an emotional level, the adaptation is a grisly tour de force of rage and destruction — it works completely. The unbridled, visceral energy of the screenplay consumes the cast and washes over all of Philip Chosky Theater.
A screenplay based on Lord of the Flies is a challenge to live up to, and the cast knocks it out of the park. I cannot possibly overstate how amazing the acting is. The characters and their portrayals are downright inspiring. As a viewer, I have never seen actors so deeply immersed in their characters.
Senior acting major Ryan Avalos plays the twins Sam and Eric. One particular scene has him simultaneously playing both of them guarding a fire while an imaginary dangerous beast lurks around them. Essentially having a conversation with himself, he successfully whips Sam and Eric into a frenzy as they flee the beast. He changes his body language, his mannerisms, and his intonations from line to line as he pretends to be two people at once. Senior musical theatre major Amanda Jerry is perfect as Jack — starting out as brash and forward, and slowly degenerating into an out and out savage. Even more amazing is the emotional range she conveys in the scenes that require it. She looks visibly shattered in the story’s central scene — after the murder of Simon, when her character breaks away from Ralph to form a new tribe. Eventually, when she orders her hordes to hunt Ralph down, you can tell how far her character has devolved when she starts looking for ways to rationalize murder. Senior musical theatre major Michael Leadbetter as Ralph is spectacular, starting out as a frivolous boy looking for popularity, and winding up destroyed by the weight of the horrors he has indirectly played a part in. In the story’s final scene, he breaks down and sobs uncontrollably at the feet of the naval officer who finally rescues the group. He carries that final scene completely on his shoulders.
As brilliant as the acting and screenplay might be, they do sometimes fail to conceal the shortcomings that the rest of the production often suffers from. Manson and Williams take some bold risks with the presentation of the script, and it doesn’t always pay off. One brilliant idea that they do execute involves filming the characters as they act out their parts and relaying it live for the audience on the screen. This creates an intriguing ‘found footage’ setting for the proceedings that ties in with their social media theme. However, all of the cameras abruptly disappear for the second half of the performance. In fact, all traces of the social media theme are gone in the second half. Similarly, building the island from Lord Of The Flies is a massive challenge for any set designer, and it shows. Some innovative ideas are applied — mirrors and walls are extensively used to create a sense of space larger than the stage might allow. However, they often lead to confusion as cast members transition from one part of the stage to another. Some scenes, such as a pig carcass that the boys feast upon, are elaborately put together with incredible attention to detail. Others, such as a fire that Ralph runs away from, are pretty much entirely left to the audience’s imagination. I found myself missing out on key story elements because I often misunderstood what a set was supposed to be.
All in all, I found the success of this stage adaptation of Lord of the Flies to be directly proportional to its closeness to the original literature. On an emotional level, this Lord of the Flies is a revelation. Several scenes had me simultaneously leaning in with fascination and recoiling with disgust. I want to complain about the ever-niggling flaws with the adaptation. On a technical level, things don’t always work. A lot of gambles are taken. Some pay off, and some don’t. Even so, I came out of the Philip Chosky Theater intrigued and inspired. Isn’t great work that which makes its audience think? On that count, Lord of the Flies works wonders.

I settled into my seat — top left, with no one in front of me so I could put my feet up — at the 11:00 a.m. IMAX showing of Mockingjay Part 2. I had my chicken tenders combo meal with curly fries and a large Coke to soothe me. The honey mustard wasn’t very good, but the curly fries were perfection. The theater was mostly filled with old people. I was in a good place.
Minor spoilers ahead; proceed with caution.
Then the movie started. Katniss is in the hospital, as she is for like one third of the Mockingjay movies. The other thirds are her begging to go to war and Coin making her star in propaganda films. Her neck is bruised, reminding us that Peeta tried to strangle her. She can barely talk because of some swelling in her vocal chords. Then they tell her that they’re sending Prim in to see how Peeta reacts to a familiar face. Katniss watches through a one way mirror. At first he’s alright, but as expected, he soon loses it, shouting that Katniss is a manipulative liar and other angry things. He’s so angry that he’s actually drooling. Pan to Katniss’ face looking blank, then the mockingjay symbol appears and we have an opening sequence.
As far as opening scenes go, this one was kind of stark. It was limited in that it had to pick up where the last movie left off, the nature of the two-part finale. It sets up the Peeta-wants-to-kill-Katniss-but-still-loves-her plotline. Thanks, Capitol. But there’s so much more to the movie than their relationship. For the finale of this epic saga of war and love I wanted an introduction with more kapow.
Then finally we get the action I knew we were all craving. Katniss and a bunch of other people fly to District 2, the Capitol’s military stronghold. There’s some place called the Nut, surrounded by mountains, where all the weapons are stored, but it’s teeming with Peacekeepers and loyalists. Rather than try to take it out, Gale devises a plan to set off a bunch of avalanches to block all exits and trap them in. Katniss is outraged of course, so they leave the train tunnel for civilians to surrender. We can see Gale becoming a genius yet ruthless strategist in this scene. Hint: foreshadowing.
When the attack happened, they used the meeting with the surrender train as an excuse to film a “propo” — one of the capitol’s propaganda films. Katniss is supposed to make a speech and inspire everyone because she’s basically a political tool of the resistance. And of course, some guy in the crowd has a gun but looks like he needs help, so she rushed to his side to help him but ends up with a gun at her face. He says “Give me one reason not to shoot you.” This leads into her pretty iconic speech where she just responds with “I can’t.” She jumps into an explanation of why this battle between them is all because of Snow. So she ends it with, “Turn your weapons to the Capitol! Turn your weapons to Snow!” And then she gets shot on film.
So she’s back in the hospital, again. And she’s begging to go to the front lines to fight, again. Instead, she gets to go to Finnick and Annie’s wedding so they can film everyone eating and dancing and having a good time, a show of strength. Of course, as much as Katniss loves these two newlyweds, she’s not much for fanfare. She and Johanna Mason, angry goddess, chat along the wall. Johanna tips Katniss off that there’s a shipment of medical supplies heading to the front lines that night, so of course she escapes.
For those viewers who read the books, this part was a little meh. This was supposed to be where the two train together, become roomies and besties, and then take an exam so they will be allowed to go to war. Katniss passes by suppressing her urge to disobey commands and Johanna fails because she’s afraid of water.
But anyway, now Katniss has just finagled her way to the frontline and thinks she’s so sneaky. Except of course Coin finds out and turns it into an opportunity. She assigns all kinds of super skilled soldiers to her group and then makes them shoot propos miles back from the frontline, on the “battle-scarred streets.” I know this also happened in the book, but it still baffles me that they would rather have all their best fighters not actually fight. And oh yeah, they also bring Peeta along for no reason, but he and Katniss start playing this game where he asks what’s real and not real. It’s kind of cute.
Also, there’s this one scene where Katniss is “sleeping” but she hears every word of Gale and Peeta talking about who will get to win her once this is all over. It was strangely reminiscent of the scene in Twilight: Eclipse where Jacob is keeping Bella warm in the tent before the battle. Like come on, let a girl live. Vary up your romantic sagas.
From this point on, all they do is run into pods, or evil motion triggered weapons that Snow has planted at every other step. And for a solid hour straight I’m so anxious I can’t get my shoulders lower than my ears. Peeta tries to kill Katniss, they lose four people, then they go underground, they lose like four more people. Snow sent in some highly disturbing mutts that were described in the book as lizard people, but in the movie they were slimy gray people with huge teeth. The stuff of nightmares. They literally tear Finnick to shreds, and I’ve lost all sense of good in the world.
I’ll stop with the spoilers now and just say that I loved the movie. I really did. It was the perfect catharsis for this series that we have all been so invested in for years. And I know splitting the final book into two movies is getting sort of old (Harry Potter and Twilight with Divergent on the way), but I feel like it’s the best way to give the fans what they crave — to live in this fantasy world a little bit longer. We get to admire Katniss’ strength, Peeta’s sweetness, Haymitch’s bluntness, and Gale’s face for just another two and a half hours. And to wrap it all up, we get a letter from Annie with updates on everyone else in the Capitol, plus a picture of the baby she and Finnick made before his death. Then finally, the sweet epilogue ending comes, and my sense of good is restored.
Was it a cinematic masterpiece, fast tracked to the Criterion Collection? No. Was it completely awesome? Yes.

Heyo!
I'll keep this short and sweet: I can't handle the cold. Ever since the first day of class, everyone has been saying how it's going to snow tens of thousands of feet, and I don't think I can handle that. My friend Helvetica has been telling me to buy one of those puffy, fluffy, ugly marshmallow coats and some crazy huge boots, because apparently, Pittsburgh becomes the North Pole, complete with Santa and elves in the winter. I'm from Florida, the Sunshine State; Coral Springs, born and raised. I'm used to heat and humidity and sunlight, and ever since coming to Pittsburgh, I've been surprised at the whimsical weather patterns. I've never seen snow before, so I'm not sure what to expect, and I'm kind of worried. I've been anticipating snow and everything, and like not being able to feel my face, or whatever below-freezing temperatures do. I know it's probably going to be fine, but what if it's not? What if it's a winter-wonderland-turned-apocalypse, and I freeze to death because I am unprepared? I'm going full-on doomsday prep here, but I regret nothing. So I guess my question boils down to: What should I expect with winter? Is it going to be a grand-scale cataclysm or a dainty powdering?
Signed,
Frightened Resident Overly Salty during this Time of Year
Dear FROSTY,
Winter is not that bad! I mean, sure there's the whole black ice thing and the car crash thing, and the frostbite, and the slipping and dislocating of hips, but that's just the tip of the iceberg! There's also hot chocolate and blankets and fireplaces and friendly, platonic cuddles. I realize that's all indoor stuff, but that's alright. Winter isn't something to fear; it's simply something to overcome. There's a lot of beauty in the ice and the snow, at least in the beginning, so as long as you're living here and exposed to it, you might as well find the beauty in the season. I do agree with your friend, however, that you will need a coat. Myself, I usually have three layers, a shirt, a sweater, and a coat, as well as gloves and a scarf, depending on how cold it is. As long as you budget your clothes accordingly, it'll all be fine, no cataclysm. There's plenty of powder, but as for the dainty part, that's only the early stages, when snow is still something that people enjoy seeing. In my mind, you have two options: Push through the winter, experience snow, live the Pittsburgh life, or hibernate for a few months, fail out of school, and become a bum come spring. Good luck!
Sincerely,
Joshua Brown.

On Friday, Netflix’s new series, Marvel’s Jessica Jones, was made available for streaming. This series is a gritty noir that will surely please fans of its sibling series Daredevil. The show places a premium on interesting character and solid performances to deliver a product that will appeal to a wide audience, not simply Marvel comic book nerds.
Played by Don’t Trust the B in Apartment 23 star Krysten Ritter, Jones is a former superhero who now finds herself scraping the muck of New York City’s Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood as a private investigator. While she possesses superhuman strength and the ability to fly, she rarely uses them. She’s your classic noir P.I. with a dirty, dimly lit office, a sardonic wit and a penchant for eye-rolling and drinking too much booze. When two crying parents arrive from the Midwest and task Jessica with finding their missing daughter, the case reveals a frightening truth: Jones’s old enemy Kilgrave, played by David Tennant (Doctor Who) is behind it. The psychopath has the ability to control people’s thoughts and actions when they simply look at him. Kilgrave and Jones had a horribly abusive relationship in the past that Jones ended by breaking free and attempting to kill Kilgrave, whom she left for dead. Jessica still suffers from PTSD because of it, and the show’s sturdy emotional core is its exploration of Jessica’s damaged consciousness.
The world of Marvel’s Jessica Jones is a perpetually dark one, in which everyone is hurting and fighting to make a living. Creator and show-runner Melissa Rosenberg, who previously worked on the The O.C. and Dexter and wrote the Twilight film series, avoids the trappings of the comic book genre and delivers a show that values character more than action. Jessica is a character that is driven by both an arresting fear of her past and the determination to return to it and vanquish her demons once and for all. Ritter is given plenty of inner turmoil to sink her teeth into, and her performance walks the line between damaged heroine and hard-boiled detective.
Supporting characters are as equally lost, with Carrie Anne Moss (The Matrix) as an ice-cold, high-powered attorney who occasionally retains Jessica’s services when she’s not cheating on her wife and Mike Colter as lonely bartender Luke Cage who catches Jessica’s eye. The structure employs a traditional procedural format — Jessica as a private eye is given a “case of the week” that pushes the story along — as a vehicle to explore the rich story world.
The show borrows a lot from its sibling series Daredevil, from the gritty noir feel and New York City Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood to raising the super hero genre a cut above the rest by giving the characters rounded dimensions and interesting pasts. Fans of the hero will not be disappointed, and fans of good television will find a lot to appreciate as well. Grab some of that leftover turkey this Thanksgiving and have a good marathon of Marvel’s Jessica Jones while avoiding having to answer what your plans are after graduation for the fifth time.
Marvel’s Jessica Jones is available now in its entirety on the Netflix streaming platform.

On par with the current renovations taking place at the Jared L. Cohon University Center (CC), the Carnegie Mellon community will also be able to enjoy a new dining space in the building starting May 2016. Au Bon Pain (ABP) has been selected, from a series of proposals by local and national vendors, as the new concept that will occupy the space that is currently Skibo Café. The announcement was made by Carnegie Mellon’s Dining Services; the decision considered evaluations from several student representatives as well as other university stakeholders.
The involvement of students, the main users of the space, has been a great concern for the Dining Services team. Last Wednesday, a Dining Student Advisory Committee meeting was held in an effort to gather input on the space’s design and how it should look. Those present raised concerns regarding the seating areas and the necessity to preserve soft seating in the new Au Bon Pain Café, as well as adequate furniture for studying, in order to preserve and improve the space’s multi-functionality as an area of work, but also of leisure.
Director of Dining Services Pascal Petter mentioned during an interview with The Tartan that one of the main goals of the renovation was to increase sitting space, which is an issue in the CC. Additionally, Dining Services, in partnership with the campus design team, will also be shifting the layout of the space in order to make it more inviting in hopes of improving the flow of people. “We’re trying to come up with a final rendering that best represents the needs of our community,” Petter said about the plans for the Au Bon Pain space, which will later be shared with students in order to get more feedback. Natural materials, such as wood or felt, will be used in decorations to highlight the key message associated with the Café.
ABP has a long history of success in serving higher education institutions, with café locations in over 30 of the most notable colleges and universities in the country. The vendor will offer a diverse menu, appealing to a broad range of customers, and will have several cashier areas in order to avoid waiting lines during heavy traffic hours such as lunch time. Founded in 1978, “the place of good bread” has grown internationally and is now recognized as a leader in the fast-casual restaurant category. The chain’s signature items — at Carnegie Mellon they will serve 12 soups of the day, salads made to order, as well as a variety of baked goods and fresh bread—are served in a welcoming environment focusing on quick service and hospitality. The brand has received Health magazine’s distinction as one of America’s Top 5 Healthiest Restaurant Chains over the past three years and one of America’s Healthiest Restaurant Chains by Grellin.
As for students’ views on the recent change, the relationship between students and the current café gets called into question. In regard to the departure of Skibo from the Cohon Center, junior machine learning major Quinton Laurencio says that “it was time for a change.” He added that one concern is the potential ceasing of late night, but that the “consensus overall is that this is an upgrade.”
Construction of the new space will start in January 2016, and the Au Bon Pain Café is expected to open in May 2016.
The Carnegie Mellon community will also be able to enhance their dining experience through two new apps: GET funds and GET foods. The first allows students, faculty, and staff to add DineXtra funds to their dining account with ease. In any case, the biggest improvement point noticed so far is the non-expiration of funds for faculty and staff. GET food, on the other hand, will allow students to order food online in advance, a model adopted in many restaurants nowadays. Additionally, the Dining Services website has also been remodeled to become more user friendly, reducing the redundancy of processes and allowing students and all that look at the platform to access up to date working hours, nutritional information and location information.

Last Monday marked the end of Carnegie Mellon University’s 22nd annual Food Drive, an event that aims to help eliminate hunger in the Pittsburgh community. 
For the past two weeks, students and faculty members were prompted to donate their time, money, canned goods, and non-perishable foods to the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank. In an email to the Tartan, staff councilwoman and university Gift Officer Carole Panno remarked on the tremendous success of this year’s drive. 
“While we won’t have final totals until next week, the drive will — once again — be one of our most successful ever, if not THE most successful ever” Panno wrote. 
Having played an integral role in the annual food drive, joining only two years after its inception, Panno has witnessed first-hand the evolving success of Carnegie Mellon’s efforts towards putting an end to hunger in the Pittsburgh area. Since the food drive’s inception in 1993, more than $32,000 has been raised to fight this cause. This year alone, the fundraising website Crowdrise shows that the goal of raising $2,000 was surpassed, and is currently approaching $3,000.
While the monetary donations made to the food drive have been rapidly increasing, it is the sight of the interactive events put together by the Staff Council that really motivates the Carnegie Mellon community to get involved in such a life-altering cause. 
Snack Bag for Kids gathered together Staff Council representatives and other Carnegie staff members to package portable snack bags, which were donated to the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank, specifically designated towards starving children in need of something to eat. 
“Our Snack Bags for Kids event — only in its second official year — nearly doubled the number of bags assembled for the Food Bank” Panno said, who additionally wanted to mention the Carnegie Mellon chapter of Alpha Phi Omega for doing a Snack Bags project. One Day, One Can was held on Nov. 4, an event focused on collecting non-perishable, canned donations. 
The final event, Cans Across the Cut, was a more fun, competition style event where groups across campus competed to see who could gather the most cans and non-perishables. This “provided a nice visual of the impact of our efforts” said Panno, who also noted that the Civil Engineering Department was the reigning victor at the event yet again.
Overall, these efforts raised over 127,000 (more than 63 tons) of non-perishable foods. While the drive may be over, it is still possible to donate to this cause through the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank. 
With the success of the Stop Hunger Now’s meal packaging lineup earlier this month, it is evident that the efforts towards decreasing hunger across the world have been rallying in size. “It really ‘takes a village’ — as they say — and all academic and administrative units come together to support this initiative. The support of our community is astounding!” Panno wrote. The increased manpower that gets put into projects such as these provides greater hope in fulfilling their mission of eradicating hunger in our communities.
During this time of year, with Thanksgiving fast approaching, efforts such as Carnegie Mellon’s food drive are extremely vital. Thanks to the outstanding efforts of the drive, many mouths will now be fed, and that is something to be thankful for.

The week before last, the Tor Group, the non-profit organization behind Tor, a network of servers that provides internet anonymity, accused Carnegie Mellon's Software Engineering Institute (SEI) of selling research to the government that allowed the FBI to unmask — and in some cases, indict — Tor users.
In an interview with Wired two weeks ago, a member of the SEI’s public relations team Ed Desautels said, “I’m not aware of any payment,” declining to comment further. 
The FBI similarly denied the claims in response to Ars Technica, telling Ars, “The allegation that we paid [Carnegie Mellon University] $1 million to hack into Tor is inaccurate.”
Last week, the university responded formally to the allegations with a media statement, which reads: “One of the missions of the SEI’s CERT division is to research and identify vulnerabilities in software and computing networks so that they may be corrected. 
In the course of its work, the university from time to time is served with subpoenas requesting information about research it has performed. The university abides by the rule of law, complies with lawfully issued subpoenas and receives no funding for its compliance.”
Although the statement denies receiving payment from the FBI for the research that allowed them to break through Tor’s guarantee of anonymity, it implies that the university gave up the research under subpoena. The original $1 million figure quoted by Tor Group President Roger Dingledine came, he said, from “friends in the security community.”
The university first fell under suspicion when it pulled a presentation of the research in question from the Black Hat Conference, a conference for information security professionals. Soon afterwards, the FBI and Interpol launched Operation Onymous, designed to unmask users of Tor on the “dark web,” a part of the internet frequented by drug, weapon, and other illicit trafficking. Recently, court documents in the trial of drug dealer Brian Farrell made reference to “a university-based research institution” that caused many to draw a connection to Carnegie Mellon.
Dingledine criticizes Carnegie Mellon for its alleged involvement with the FBI; he wrote on Tor’s blog, “This attack also sets a troubling precedent: Civil liberties are under attack if law enforcement believes it can circumvent the rules of evidence by outsourcing police work to universities. If academia uses ‘research’ as a stalking horse for privacy invasion, the entire enterprise of security research will fall into disrepute.”
The Tor Project responded to the university’s statement with more questions. Tor Project spokesperson Kate Krauss wrote to Wired that it still has “many questions about [Carnegie Mellon’s] new statement,” including how the FBI knew what to subpoena from the Carnegie Mellon and whether the research on Tor was approved by the university’s Institutional Review Board.

Andres Webster Henestrosa (HNZ ’97), the Cultural Attaché and Consul of Mexico in Los Angeles, visited Carnegie Mellon to talk about his model, which is based on how much a culture contributes to the local GDP, and his plan to support the community and enhance diplomacy through culture and education.
During the speech, Henestrosa asked his audience why people should care about culture. Most audience members talked about how culture promotes a good quality of life. Also, students remarked on the preservation of endangered cultures, the interpersonal connections that culture creates, and how culture factors into education and the economy.
But cultural policy is not just about preservation and artistic education. What Henestrosa offered is a new approach that emphasizes the potential of culture to boost economic and social development, and the potential of culture in diplomacy.
Henestrosa led the discussion and asked the audience to think about culture’s relationship to development. 
He introduced his belief that culture is an anchor for development. He clarified how culture could boost economy with examples of Spanish culture and French cultural tourism. 
According to Henestrosa, in the year of 2007 alone, 82 million tourists went to France, 48 percent of them for a cultural visit.
Henestrosa graduated from Heinz College with a master of arts management in and a master of science in public policy and management in 1997 before going back to Mexico. In Mexico, he worked as an analyst in the Economic and Social Studies Department of Banamex, one of the most important financial groups in Mexico, which is now held by Citigroup. Shortly after that, Henestrosa was named the Deputy Secretary of Culture of the State of Oaxaca, becoming Secretary of Culture later in 2007. Henestrosa introduced his Oaxacan Model to the audience, which was based on these extensive experiences with Mexican culture.
In terms of linguistic diversity, Mexico ranks eighth as a country with its 62 indigenous languages. Among those many languages, Oaxaca alone enjoys 15 indigenous languages. Moreover, Oaxaca is a place with abundant cultural resources. 
Henestrosa said Oaxaca has 3580 registered archaeological sites, 672 cataloged cultured properties, 263 artistic landmarks, and about 300,000 active artists and artisans.
With so many cultural resources to manage, Oaxaca seems to be a favorable place to develop an effective cultural policy. 
Henestrosa’s model starts from a diagnostic step and works out a way for people to participate. Henestrosa said his model began with an awareness of the need for “a public policy model to manage the cultural diversity and heritage.” The next step, Henestrosa said, involved “strategic planning and participation.” All these steps would lead to a sustainable development that features economic, environmental and social development. Under this model, Oaxaca performed well in making culture work for its local GDP, receiving 6.5 percent of the GDP and 7.8 percent of employment from the cultural sector.
But to use the Oaxaca model in a greater scope, the word “strategic” should be well defined. Henestrosa said “strategic” was supported by three pillars: protection of the cultural heritage, protection and dissemination of the cultural diversity, and arts and cultural education, a three-part system that would eventually lead to a culturally sustainable development.
To put this model into work, cultural legislation is needed. Henestrosa said that the cultural development would go through the Council of Citizen Participation for the Cultural Development of the State, and that it would get funded from local projects. 
Henestrosa said the Oaxaca Model was characterized with a clear definition of strategy that would be helpful in the phase of implementation and a legal form.
Henestrosa also talked about cultural diplomacy that, according to him, was connected to soft power and service to the community. Henestrosa said the strategies he is currently pursuing with the Consulate General of Mexico in L.A. was to support community and enhance diplomacy through culture and education, strategies that involved center for creative industries, business centers, a center for the preservation of Mexico visual arts, and the center for Spanish and Mexican studies.
“The culture of Mexico is everywhere,” Henestrosa said. According to him, the population of people originating from Mexico constitutes 10.3 percent of the entire population of the US. He also stated that in California, the population of people originating from Mexico constitutes 30.7 percent of the population of the state, and in Los Angeles, that number is 35.8 percent. Despite such a large population, children of Mexican origins lose their Spanish because the schools they attend only spoke English. Henestrosa said schools should “offer Hispanic classes” and offer free SAT classes to Mexican communities to encourage Mexican students to go to college and to add cultural diversity where it is lacking.

China and CMU to provide scholarships
Last Friday, Nov. 20, Carnegie Mellon President Subra Suresh met with members of the China Scholarship Council to approve new fellowships which seek to provide support for Carnegie Mellon graduate students of Chinese origin. 
These fellowships, added to funding and federal grants from the university, creates a sum total of $32 million in financial support that will span across the next five years. These fellowships will allow more Chinese students to study at the university without the burden of the large price tag attached to this institution.
As part of this program, the China Scholarship Council will provide full tuition and a two-year stipend to as many as 20 Carnegie Mellon doctoral students and four master’s degree students. The university will provide its usual financial support after this time has ended.
These fellowships will provide support for doctoral students in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields as well as students in the social sciences, humanities, design, and architecture. Additionally, these fellowships will support students pursuing a master’s degree in the arts, drama, and music.
This agreement, overseen by China Scholarship Council Secretary-General Jinghui Liu, adds to the longstanding history of collaboration between Carnegie Mellon and China.
Alumna organizes LATINY conference
2012 Carnegie Institute of Technology alumnus Luza Jaramillo has organized the first ever LATINY technology conference.
Jaramillo is of Colombian decent. With recent numbers from Google Inc. showing the company’s Hispanic workforce in the single digit percentages, Jaramillo thought it prudent to host a technology conference focused on Hispanic diversity in the tech industry. 
As a student, Jaramillo attended the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing in 2010, sponsored by Carnegie Mellon’s Information Networking Institute (INI). 
INI Director Dena Haritos Tsamitis has long supported conferences and initiatives that promote diversity in the technological workplace. “Sponsoring students to attend Grace Hopper and similar minority-serving conferences is just one facet of the INI’s commitment to diversifying the field,” said Tsamitis. “However, it is not simply about attracting more women to the field. Our focus is on removing barriers and enacting a culture shift that embraces all individuals, no matter their gender, ethnicity or background.”
Jaramillo became involved in the Latinas in Computing organization through these many events sponsored by INI. 
Now, in 2015, Jaramillo has worked to organize LATINY, a conference poised to be held in South American cities which provides a platform similar to the Grace Hopper Celebration conferences.
LATINY debuted on November 9 in Santiago, Chile. The conference hopes to broaden interest in the technological industry among diverse students.

The world has always been a scary place, but in this era of instant communication and constant access to social media, we are bombarded day-in and day-out with tragedy. Open up our laptop, and the first thing that pops up is a news story about death threats on college campuses. Turn on the TV and see live footage of the terrorist attacks on Paris from a cell phone video. Open the newspaper and every headline convinces us that circumstances are dire, and the future looks bleak. Today looks bad, and tomorrow looks worse.
This message is discouraging and upsetting. It is being shoved down our throats every waking moment. I'm not saying we should ignore the problems of the world or that we must fix them all. But we must have hope for a brighter tomorrow. This is not easy. In fact, it is probably one of the hardest things to do, but a brighter future will not exist until we start believing in one.
The day after the Paris attacks, I saw a terrific quote by Pittsburgh’s own Fred Rogers: “When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me ‘Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.’” This mother's inspiring and undeniably true message, intended quell the fears of a scared little boy, is one that we all should take to heart.
In times of tragedy, we simultaneously see the best and worst of humanity. On the night of the attacks, amid chaos and panic, many French citizens opened their homes to provide refuge to those affected. A security guard at the football stadium prevented one of the suicide bombers from entering, saving the lives of thousands. In the Bataclan, one man identified only as “Sebastian” saved the life of a pregnant woman who was dangling from a window in a desperate attempt to flee the terrorists. On that night, countless individuals made personal sacrifices to help those around them; most of these stories of our “helpers” will remain unknown. But these people do exist, and we must not forget that.
It is so easy to hate after a tragedy, to make sweeping generalizations and become paranoid with fear. But this is precisely what we must avoid, because terrorist organizations like ISIS want us to become fearful and hateful, and to seek vengeance against innocent people.
Antoine Leiris, a Parisian who lost his wife, posted a moving tribute with the powerful message: “I will not give you the gift of my hatred.” Leiris recognizes that hatred is what motivates terrorists, and in the wake of such a tragedy, he has the insight for which we all must strive.
People tend to lose hope unconsciously, falling into seemingly endless despair and darkness, but if we do this we are truly doomed. It is particularly important that bright, young, and eager students do not lose hope. As the next generation, we hold the power and responsibility to change the world for the better. Every single student on this campus can make the world a better place in some way, no matter how large or small.
The way to begin is by looking for the helpers. Once you find them, become one. And once you are are one, teach others how to follow your example. If we do this, we can slowly but surely transition from a world plagued by hate and fear to one saved by fearless helpers.

Many Americans are fiercely passionate about inequality, especially in the workforce. Wages, healthcare, and underemployment have always instantly drawn the spotlight in the news and on social media. For example, most people are aware of the wage gap between women and men and of discrimination against African-American-sounding names in job applications.  
Politicians lecture on the importance of correcting these issues, passionate editorials are published, and hashtags are created. However, this country has neglected to acknowledge the blatant discrimination against a crucial group of Americans, a group that makes up almost 20 percent of the population. Members of this group are 26 percent less likely to be hired, not due to race or gender, but because of disabilities. 
Disability discrimination, or ableism, is a grossly under-discussed issue, especially when social media and public interest in equality can make almost any subject a widespread human rights debate. Rutgers and Syracuse Universities recently conducted research exploring the prevalence of disability discrimination. They sent fictitious résumés and cover letters to various firms, identical except for the inclusion of a disability, either a spinal cord injury or Asperger’s. Almost all firms showed much less interest in the résumés that included a disability, regardless of whether it was mental or physical. 
In 1990, Congress passed the Americans with Disabilities Act, outlawing this type of discrimination against disabled job applicants. However, this act is very difficult to enforce because discrimination can be difficult to prove in specific situations. In 2013, only 34 percent of qualified workers with a disability were employed, as opposed to 74 percent of workers without.
American citizens take wonderful advantage of their freedom of expression to bring attention to many deserving subjects. However, for whatever reason, their social justice campaigns have too often failed to support workers with disabilities. Freedom of speech is a precious power. Rather than using it to debate Starbucks cups or a new Google logo, it should be used to defend the rights of these victims of ableist discrimination.

Last Wednesday, I moderated a discussion hosted by Carnegie Mellon's College Democrats called "What Can We Learn from Mizzou?" The event served as the start of Carnegie Mellon’s discussion of racism on college campuses, and we hope that the discussion continues. The room was completely filled, showing students' desire to learn and have their voices heard. 
In this letter, I would like to summarize and reflect on the discussion. While most dictionaries define racism as “the belief that one race is superior to another,” a more accurate definition is “a system of advantage based on race.” This system can manifest itself in many ways, including institutional racism — an organization's collective failure to provide proportional and adequate services to a group of people based on their race. 
Institutional racism is particularly relevant when discussing the prevalence of racism on college campuses. At Mizzou, there were a series of racist incidents and the administration failed to respond to students' complaints. In response to the administration’s failure to act adequately, students formed the group "Concerned Student 1950" and presented the administration with a list of demands, including the resignation of the university president, Tom Wolfe. To ensure that their demands were met, students engaged in many forms of protest such as Jonathan Butler’s hunger strike and the football team’s refusal to play in a high-ticket game. Students have since succeeded in removing the university president from his position.
Inspired by Mizzou, students across the nation have been standing in solidarity and demanding changes at their own schools, including Yale University, Claremont McKenna University, and Wesleyan University. So what can we learn from Mizzou? 
One: Act. Every student has the right to a learning environment in which they can feel safe and comfortable, regardless of his race. There is no way to end racism without addressing it. Two: Hit ‘em where it hurts. Brainstorm potential consequences for the administration if they don't respond to your concerns. College administrations respond to events that can hurt their reputation or funds. Give them incentive to act. Three: Make clear demands and present a clear solution. Do your homework and make sure you set goals that are specific; set a deadline. 
When I received my first college acceptance letter, I nearly cried. As a young girl who grew up in the ghettos of Oakland, CA I was convinced that college was the way to escape the institutional racism that traps many African-American youth in the poverty cycle. I thought that by attending college I had broken my chains, but by being here I’ve learned there is no escape from racism in America if we don't end the remnants of institutional racism. 
My initial response to the events at Mizzou was heartbreak. However, I realized that Mizzou’s national headlines were a blessing in disguise. Finally, Americans were provided with proof that racism is not over. It is not only affecting the “thugs” or “welfare queens,” to use the language of ignorance, but also those who are doing everything the conservative media says that African-American youth should do: getting a college education so that they have the means to improve their communities. We are not safe, either. Now, as college students, it is our duty to seize this moment while we have the platform to end institutional racism on college campuses. 
College is a place for political action, not only in regard to racial injustice but also to all issues. Feel free to reach out to College Democrats and continue the discussion of racial justice and general political action on campus. I can be contacted at sstegman@andrew.cmu.edu. Any question, comments, or suggestions are welcomed.

Last Saturday, the world awoke to words and images of tremendous violence in Paris. Hundreds of civilians were gunned down with impunity as they went about their business at a number of French cultural institutions. This lead officials to question current security measures and many European citizens to suspect that extremism is flowing across weak European Union (UN) borders. 
Terror does not usually come from the barrel of a Kalashnikov or a jihadi message board. Western citizens may be uncertain of what the attacks mean for them, but the hundreds of thousands of Syrians who have already migrated or are currently seeking shelter in Europe are now guaranteed to face an unprecedented wave of cultural violence. News that one gunman might have entered the EU alongside refugees has exacerbated a nativist fervor in France and other parts of Europe, where tension over foreign immigration was already high. 
The United States has not failed to notice. Many Republican state officials, including Governor Greg Abbott (R-TX), have hopped on the xenophobic bandwagon, declaring that their states will refuse to accept any of the 10,000 Syrian refugees that President Barack Obama previously promised to take in. According to Abbott, "Texas cannot participate in any program that will result in Syrian refugees being resettled in Texas... any one of whom could be connected to terrorism.”  
Although states do not directly participate in refugee resettlement, a task left to federal agencies, Abbott's xenophobic position was reinforced on Thursday by bipartisan legislation passed in the House. The bill, which is expected to evade the executive veto through a congressional majority, will force Syrian and Iraqi refugees to undergo a stringent vetting process before admission to the United States. 
These refugees have already lost years in fetid border-camps, struggling to regain the stability that western-catalyzed conflict had destroyed at home. Many have already undergone background checks and document verification processes. These people don’t have time to wait on McCarthyist agitators; no endangered life should. Whether grounded in genuine security concerns or Islamophobia, denying compassion to a small fraction of the displaced and disabused refugees only bolsters the effectiveness of ISIS’s mission: to spread fear and seed mistrust. 
Nativism runs deep in this country’s history, and it is inextricably linked to the antiquated yet still debated question of who truly qualifies as “American.” Immigrants have long faced derision from groups claiming to be "true" Americans. The internment of thousands of Japanese-Americans after Pearl Harbor is no exception to this trend. With the support of a fearful public, these citizens were rounded up on the sole basis of their ethnicity and detained for over four years. 
The world cannot bear to repeat this unconstitutional violation of due process built on unsubstantiated distrust. But we are doing it right now. Some senior lawmakers and political heavyweights have not only chosen to ignore history, but have decided to hold up Japanese-American internment as a case study in support of rejecting refugees from Iraq and Syria. 
David Bowers, the longtime mayor of Roanoke, Virginia stated on Wednesday that “President Franklin D. Roosevelt felt compelled to sequester Japanese foreign nationals after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and it appears that the threat of harm to America from ISIS now is just as real and serious as that from our enemies then.” Just like Abbott and many lawmakers across party lines, Bower’s position isn’t just historically inaccurate and intrinsically racist: It also fails to understand at even a basic level how refugee resettlement works.
According to experienced immigration lawyer Scott Hicks, the resettlement process for refugees is a multi-step affair that requires numerous background checks over a long period of time. Refugees actually have no say at all where they will be resettled; that is determined by the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees (UNHCR), which initially vets resettlement candidates. Once a refugee is selected to go to America, federal authorities conduct even more background checks and certifications before they consider permanent resettlement. You guessed it — resettlement is not even guaranteed at this point. 
It is not surprising then, that none of the over 1.5 million Muslim immigrants permanently resettled in the United States between 2001 and 2013 have been involved in acts of domestic terrorism. Any willing and resourceful jihadist would likely fly here with a temporary visa.
Highly effective and often tragically overbearing security measures are already in place. Therefore, this new legislative measure to delay resettlement accomplishes nothing but satisfy an unsettling American impulse toward xenophobia. Now we must treat refugees with compassion rather than derision; they have already paid their dues to our unreasonable fear.

It’s a little sad that a mere show of solidarity is being met with a thousand very serious articles on how ineffective it is to change your profile picture in response to a crisis. Even the name “slacktivism” derides any form of Internet protest, regardless of its purpose. 
In truth, Internet activism is wildly effective in achieving its goals through generating awareness about its targets. Slacktivism was the basis for plenty of effective protests, from the uprisings in Moldova in 2009 and Egypt in 2011 — both triggered by social media organization — to the expansion of race-based protests beyond Yale and the University of Missouri, which has led to students' demands being met at colleges like Princeton. 
However, even with all these examples, criticizing slacktivism as a form of protest requires people to forget what protests do. Protests are not about raising money; they’re about generating and focusing political will. The Internet reaches many people very fast and isn’t subject to things like police resistance and weather. Internet activism allows more people to become aware of a situation. Awareness is how political will is generated. 
When slacktivism is used outside the theater of protest to do things like generate money, it’s still highly effective. Sure, fewer people will donate when they hear about a cause on social media — people who actively seek out charity work are certainly more likely to donate to a cause. 
However, charities don’t run on a small group of people giving them dollars. If a charity exponentially expands their awareness by expanding via social media, fewer people need to donate for that organization to meet their goals. Take the "Ice Bucket Challenge," which generated hundreds of millions of dollars even though only a tiny fraction of the people who saw videos of it donated. Since then, research funded through the meme has led to a potential cure to Lou Gehrig's disease. 
Furthermore, viral phenomenons allow charities to reach people with vast amounts of resources who can generate the multiple thousand dollar donations. These dollars are much more meaningful than having a core group of committed followers.
Even if changing profile pictures won’t destabilize ISIS, bring back the people killed, or even create resources and safe havens for people who have lost their homes to ISIS and Assad’s murderous aggression, it could still have a positive impact. Taking down ISIS and stabilizing the Middle East is not within the power of your average teenager, but raising awareness is. 
Even a show of collective mourning, bound as it is to the digital realm, might have the power to soothe grief or generate resolve. People cannot create change if they do not know about the issues or support a movement they have never heard of. Awareness is necessary for activism, and slacktivism sends waves of awareness across countries and cultures.

Imagine this: You get out of bed and step on someone's carelessly placed toys, or maybe the toys were even carefully arranged around your bed. Soon after, you stub your toe on a badly installed bedpost. Then you go to work and someone hands you an item that falls on your foot. Finally, you get on a crowded bus to go home and someone steps on that same foot. You blow up at this last person, and of course they think you're overreacting. But what they haven't seen are all the small things that built up to you reacting in a large way, since you were never able to express how you were bothered by them. 
This is an analogy to describe racial microaggression. Credit for it goes to Morewood Housefellow Aaron George, who helped me to understand why black people in America can't seem to stop complaining and can't seem to ever be satisfied. Racial microaggression is what black students and faculty at the University of Missouri (or Mizzou) and other American colleges have to deal with all the time. This goes for black Americans in general as well. 
The conversation around microaggression began again on Nov. 11, when a white Mizzou student made death threats toward black students from the pseudo-anonymous app Yik Yak. This was just the beginning of a long list of microaggressions against black students and faculty publicly documented at universities across the United States.
As a black male wrestling with black identity more than the average "African-American" (an essentially meaningless term that needs to be nixed because of its complicated and blanket-statement nature), God's affirmation of the value of my life and black lives has been so critical and so meaningful, as well as the affirmation of fellow Christ-followers and InterVarsity Christian Fellowship USA (especially through Black Campus Ministries). We feel so loved and appreciated when white- and Asian-dominated spaces demonstrate they are looking out for us. We need them, and they need us.

If a profile picture changes colors to promote a cause halfway around the world, does it accomplish anything? Does anyone care? The answer is no. 
The tragedy in Paris is the latest example of what The Atlantic calls "a mass impulse to put the 'me' in 'meme.'" Following the ISIS-led attacks on locations across Paris, in which 130 civilians were killed, Facebook users around the world were given the option to add a filter of the French flag to their profile pictures. Presumably millions clicked to show their solidarity for Paris, and solidarity is nice. But the problem is that the support should not stop there. Unfortunately, it most likely will.
When social media users change their profile picture, share articles, and maybe add an opinion or two, they often feel satisfied enough with this contribution that they neglect to turn it into action. A study from the University of British Columbia has shown that once a user has voiced their support via social media, they are less likely to donate money or even volunteer later on. 
Showing public support for a cause makes people feel good about themselves and their public image, which convinces them that they've done enough. It's proven to actually inhibit meaningful action. A significant motivator for showing support on social media comes down to making yourself feel and look better. This does nothing to help victims of terrorism across the world.
Some people make the excuse for "slacktivism" that the average person is too insignificant or powerless to effect any real change beyond typing and clicking. But we are lucky enough to live in a society that encourages free speech and gives us representatives in government to make our voices heard. Taking the easiest way out and adding a filter to a profile picture that at most 700 "friends" will see is not the most effective way to voice opinions — rather, we should use the full extent of our rights and start meaningful conversations about policy, our role in the global fight against terrorism, and ways to avoid the profiling that might inevitably follow such an attack. 
We live on a college campus, surrounded by thousands of strong-willed individuals. Regardless of Carnegie Mellon's apolitical nature, there have been opportunities to meet up and discuss issues in a productive way, perhaps even to brainstorm solutions. We can send these ideas to our local and state politicians, who in turn can voice our opinions on the legislative level. Even if you are unwilling to participate in discussions or engaging policy makers, there is still a space for you to participate in things like candlelight vigils, which at the very least is a physical show of solidarity with the victims.
The fact of the matter is that, especially at Carnegie Mellon, the reasons to find satisfaction and fulfillment in such "slacktivism" are plenty and easy to come by. Instead of sitting behind our computer screens on our bubble-like campus, we should reach out to our neighbors, peers, and students from around the globe to start meaningful conversations that can lead to actual, concrete results. If all that we can muster is a trendy Facebook picture profile, that's not just slacktivism. It's flat out inaction. 
For those of you who changed your profile picture, good for you for supporting Paris. But we're challenging you to push your actions further and see what impact you can really have. Want to make a concrete difference? Donate money to French charity organizations like the French Red Cross. Reach out to your local representative and express your beliefs on Syrian refugees. Vote in the upcoming election to tell politicians what you think the U.S. should be doing about ISIS. There are a million ways to take action, so take it. Don't choose the easy way out, and don't pat yourself on the back for doing only that.
