Despite struggling to move the ball offensively, Carnegie Mellon football came away with a 22–21 win Saturday over Geneva College in their home opener. 
After an opening touchdown drive by Geneva left Carnegie Mellon looking up at the Golden Tornadoes, a combination of effective special teams and suffocating defense allowed Carnegie Mellon to put up 22 unanswered points, a deficit too large for Geneva’s comeback attempt to overcome. 
The win was the first of Carnegie Mellon’s season, moving the team’s record for the year to 1–2.
The opening drive of the game did not yield auspicious beginnings for the Tartans. The opposing team successfully attacked the flats and put up consistent gains on catch-and-run plays. 
Geneva marched quickly down the field and began the scoring when first-year quarterback Aaron Channing hit senior wide receiver Josh Guiser for a 15-yard touchdown. Carnegie Mellon did not respond well initially.
The Tartans’ first drive of the game stalled after just six plays and 17 yards, but first-year punter Tyler Kohman dropped a perfect punt within Geneva’s five-yard line, pinning them with their backs against the wall for their next possession. The drive got nowhere due to an impenetrable  defense by Carnegie Mellon. 
After a three-and-out, the Tartans took advantage of their excellent field position on an 18-yard touchdown pass from junior quarterback Andrew Hearon to senior wide receiver Tim Swanson. 
Both teams struggled to move the ball for the remainder of the half, trading punts until the break.
After a quick three-and-out by Carnegie Mellon to start the second half, Geneva set up a drive on their own 43-yard line, looking to take advantage of the field position yielded by the Tartan’s failed possession of the ball. 
Four plays into the drive, however, junior outside linebacker Nico Comsa got to Channing, forcing a fumble and setting up Carnegie Mellon’s own offense with excellent field position. 
With some help in the form of two major penalties on Geneva for 28 yards, Hearon hit sophomore wide receiver Garrett Strobel with a surgically precise pass in the middle of the end zone, opening up a 13-7 lead early in the second half after the extra point attempt failed.
Both defenses continued to successfully prevent the offenses from putting together any threatening drives. 
However, after a three-and-out deep in their own territory, Carnegie Mellon punted the ball to Geneva, setting up the Golden Tornadoes at midfield with a chance to score for the lead. 
Geneva was putting together a strong drive, and had gotten the offense all the way into the end zone before a pass was tipped, setting up junior cornerback Vince Demarchi for an interception that he took to the house, giving Carnegie Mellon the first multi-score lead of the game.
After a failed two-point conversion attempt, Carnegie Mellon was up 19–7, and the game would not be within one possession again until Geneva scored and completed a meaningless two-point conversion with the game clock expired. 
Carnegie Mellon’s defense and kick coverage was strong for most of the game, with the first and last drives outliers during an otherwise very impressive performance. 
First-year safety Drew Fitzmorris and junior cornerback Ryan Aitken, in particular, were all over the field, each ending up with 12 total tackles, with one each in the backfield. Fitzmorris forced a fumble on special teams as well.
Swanson also had a very good home opener. He was Carnegie Mellon’s best weapon in the passing game, ending up with 50 yards on four receptions for a touchdown.
“It was great,” he said of notching a win on the home field after two losses of a combined 48 points to start the season. “It was a struggle the first two weeks, and now we’re able to come out on top. Our defense was able to propel us forward, and we were able to get the win.”
The win also comes on the heels of Swanson’s UAA Special Teams Athlete of the Week award win after his return of a blocked extra point for a defensive two-point conversion.
Carnegie Mellon football will look to continue their success at home as they follow their conference schedule and host Westminster on Saturday at 1 p.m.

Women’s Tennis
Beginning Sept. 20, the Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team participated in the USTA-ITA Southeast Regional Women’s Tennis Championships. Unlike the standard team format, each player or pair advances individually. On Sept. 20, the Tartans had four individuals advance on to the round of sixteen in addition to two doubles pairing advancing to the quarterfinals.
On the singles side, senior Angela Pratt lived up to her second seed placement and won her first two games in straight sets. Fellow senior Bryn Raschke and first-year Cori Sidell followed suit by also deposing of their opponents in straight sets. The fourth Tartan to move on, sophomore Nicholle Torres, followed up by winning her next four sets across her two games to move on.
Raschke also moved on in doubles where she combined with first-year Stacy Chang to cruise to Sunday after 8–2 and 8–4 victories. The other tandem to move on was juniors Abbey Hamstra and Brooke Tsu, who won their two matches 8–4 and 8–1.
On Sunday, the seniors, Pratt and Raschke, proved resillent and pushed on to the semifinals on the backs of two more straight set victories each. Unfortunately, Torres and Sidell fell in the round of 16 while Hamstra and Tsu made it all the way to the doubles semifinals before losing.
Whatever magic Pratt and Raschke had over the weekend finally wore out on Monday when both fell victim to the same straight set of victories they had ridden to the semifinals.
The Tartans will compete on Saturday versus Oberlin College at Carnegie Mellon.
Men’s Tennis
This weekend, the Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team competed in the men’s USTA-ITA Southeast Regional. The Tartans came into the tournament with six seeded players in singles play. Of those, four moved on to the round of 16. Senior Will Duncan took his first game. Junior Abhishek Alla, who was a two-seed, won his first game in straight sets 6–1, 6–0 before pulling out to a 4–0 lead in the first set of his next match when his opponent retired due to injury. Sophomores Kunal Wadwani and Kenny Zheng both won their two games in straight sets.
In doubles play, Duncan and sophomore Kasbeer along with the pairing of senior Bryce Beisswanger and junior Yuvraj Kumar both won their respective matches 8–1. The duo of Wadwani and first-year Andrew Pratt was forced to play two games, but still prevailed.
On Sunday, the individuals continued to represent Carnegie Mellon well:  Alla made it all the way to the semifinals to make it to the final four. Duncan and Zheng both moved on to the quarterfinals before finally dropping a match.
On the doubles side, Beisswanger and Kumar continued to dominate to advance to the semifinals on Monday. Pratt and Wadwani to make it to the quarterfinals but ultimately lost, ending end their tournament.
The semifinals and finals for both individual and doubles will start on Monday morning.
Men’s Soccer
The Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team travelled to Grove City College on Saturday, trying to pick up their sixth win in the month of September. 
After multiple shots on goal by both teams to start the game, Grove City got on the board first with a cross into the box that beat senior goalkeeper Jacob Rice to the near post in the 37th minute.
The Tartans took the 0–1 deficit into the half, but came out determined in the second half.
Carnegie Mellon eventually tied it up on a penalty kick in the 55th minute by junior midfielder Connor Webb. The Tartans, and particularly Webb, kept pushing, including back-to-back shots on goal by Webb six seconds apart in the 62nd minute.
Finally, in the 84th minute, Webb and the Tartans prevailed as he knocked in his seventh goal of the season off an assist by junior forward and midfielder Dimitrije Slavkovic to put Carnegie Mellon ahead for good, 2–1.
This win pushed the Tartans to 6–3 going into University Athletic Association play, which begins Saturday at the University of Chicago.
Women’s Volleyball
On Sunday, the Carnegie Mellon volleyball team played a double header at Wooster, Ohio. In the first game, against DePauw University, the Tartans took care of business, winning in three straight sets: 25–19, 25–23, 25–21. First-year outside hitter Heather Holton and senior right setter Ali Celentano led the attack for the Tartans with each racking up 12 kills in the game.
In the second game against host Wooster, the Tartans looked just as sharp. Celentano and Holton again led the team in kills with 11 and nine, respectively, and sophomore middle blocker Jackie Gibbons also stepped up her game. Sophomore defensive setter Molly Higgins was a key contributor on defense, getting a team high 11 digs.
The Tartans start UAA play on Saturday, playing their first round robin at Emory University.

After a 20-year drought full of losing seasons and laughable playoff hopes, the Pittsburgh Pirates have now posted a winning season and playoff berth for the second consecutive season. Having already clinched a playoff spot, the Pirates are spending the last few days of the season fighting for home field advantage, either in the wild card game — where they have a one-game lead over the San Francisco Giants for the top wild card spot heading into Sunday — or the divisional round, where they sit one game behind the St. Louis Cardinals for the National League Central (NLC) crown. Ultimately, with a Pirates’ loss, and Giants’ and Cardinals’ wins, Pittsburgh ended the year tied for the wildcard with the Giants, but will get home field advantage in the Tuesday wild card game due to their head-to-head record, going 4–2 against San Francisco in the regular season.
Coming into this season, the Pirates’ playoff predictions were mixed: the team is generally composed of the key players of last year’s luck-reversing squad. Normally, returning the same core after a playoff run would be cause for hope and optimism, but with glaring holes in both the lineup and rotation left unfilled, it was highly questionable with a cast of young, rising all-stars and cheap, discarded veterans.
One of the biggest concerns was the power void at first base, which was filled by former Minnesota Twin Justin Morneau last season after an August trade. But with Morneau signing with the Colorado Rockies in the off-season, the void was as present as ever. 
Originally, the front office made a minor fix by trading for discarded New York Mets prospect/bust Ike Davis, but Davis continued to be an all-or-nothing hitter, with not much all and a whole lot of nothing.
Veteran Gaby Sanchez, who came into the season with at least a share of the starting first base job, has been forced to play more than the fans and probably the Pirates manager, Clint Hurdle, would have liked. Following a 2013 season where fans and the front office were unhappy with his play, prompting the Morneau trade, Sanchez’s numbers have dropped like a rock, going from a .254 to .231 batting average. The eventual solution would have never been predicted going into the season, as no one saw the rise of utility player Josh Harrison coming. 
Starting the year in a platoon split in right field and biding time until super prospect Gregory Polanco was called up from the minors in June, Harrison played himself into an all-star appearance with both his offensive and defensive abilities, regardless of his position on the field.
When former all-star Pedro Álvarez struggled both in the field and at the plate, and spent some time on the disabled list (DL), Harrison took over the starting role on third base. 
Álvarez slowly worked on the transition to first base where he would be less of a defensive liability. Unfortunately, Álvarez was diagnosed with a stress fracture in early September.
On the mound, the major question mark heading into the season was how to replace the production of former ace A. J. Burnett, who signed a high-priced contract with the Philadelphia Phillies in the off-season. The answer came in the form of Edinson Volquez, the former top prospect of the Texas Rangers,who has bounced around the league and the minors as his command and effectiveness came and went. 
Thankfully, he was spot-on this year, leading Pittsburgh with 13 wins, a 3.04 earned runs average (ERA), and 140 strikeouts.
Furthermore, last year’s ace Francisco Liriano found his groove in the second half of the year, ending up with a very solid 3.32 ERA. With all of these changes and Liriano’s performance, the Pirates pulled everything together at the right time. All-stars Russell Martin and Andrew McCutchen have turned in career-best seasons, keeping the team afloat early in the year.
That being said, this team is not without major question marks heading into postseason. The formerly rock solid bullpen lost its mojo, prompting a desperate trade between the Pirates and the Los Angeles Angels in which they swapped failing closers: Jason Grilli from Pittsburgh to the Angels for Ernesto Frieri. Frieri has imploded with the Pirates, posting an ERA over double what Grilli was at when the front office gave up on him.
Also, after a hot and cold start, Polanco settled more on the cold side and has never lived up to the miracle worker potential bestowed upon him by the media. He still has plenty of time to grow into his potential, but the odds of him significantly contributing to a playoff run in is slim.
No matter what happens in the playoffs, after 20 years without baseball in October, it’s a nice change of pace to not only be competitive but also make the playoffs in consecutive seasons. 
Who knows — maybe this is the start of a 20-year winning streak for the Pirates.

“It’s kind of an exercise that stimulates your mind and brain,” said Brandon Peck as he strolled across the Cut through the midday breeze toward the soccer field, which acts as his main hangout spot on campus. 
The senior business administration and decision science double major plays for Carnegie Mellon’s men’s varsity soccer team and has been part of the team since his first year at the university. When he is not burying his nose deeply in his textbooks or engaging in conversations with friends or classmates, he is dribbling soccer balls with his teammates in five-on-five short-sided games, his favorite drill. 
Though this drill is played in a space that is half the length of a standard field, it does not fail to prepare this student athlete for intercollegiate tournaments, where he mainly plays right outside back defender and, occasionally, midfielder. Interestingly, Peck has played every position except goalie throughout his 18 years of playing soccer.
What first started out as a minor scrimmage during a YMCA activity for a three-year-old Peck soon turned out to be one of the most rewarding and influential activities of his childhood. 
Peck said playing for the soccer team sometimes causes him a headache; practice removes a generous portion of his leisure time. 
However, Peck is constantly reminded of the game’s numerous charms that have motivated him to play for the last 18 years: its strategic nature, team-oriented environment, and potential for building long-lasting friendships. As a matter of fact, some of his fondest memories involve bonding with his team through shenanigans that occurred during off campus road trips to tournaments at other universities.
“You get to know each member that much better when you’re away from the school setting,” Peck said. “It’s when we are away from all the pressure from classes and practice that people start to unwind, grow good-humored, and become immersed in conversations that seem to come out of nowhere, as well as goofy situations that tie us together. It gets quite exhilarating.”
During the last four years, his proudest moment was scoring his first college goal in an NCAA tournament. Peck claimed that his most significant accomplishment as a Carnegie Mellon athlete has been maintaining consistently high performances by exhibiting polished techniques, utilizing effective strategy, and promoting team camaraderie. 
When asked which professional team he would coach for one year if given the opportunity, he replied FC Barcelona, due to the passion that fans have for the team.
Others can clearly detect the reason behind his interest: this defender relishes environments in which others give recognition and support, which is why he enjoys being a figure upon whom his teammates can depend during games as well as outside the world of soccer. This role also translates to his nonathletic relationships: friendships, peers, and family. 
The latter is most important to Brandon, who said he has especially strong ties to his parents, who are his role models and the ones who initially encouraged him to play soccer for his physical, mental, and spiritual well-being.
“They both have done so much for me that I hope one day I can do for my children.”

Nearly everyone has been told at some point in their life to drive safely. In today’s society, this reminder is often a warning about speeding or texting while driving. Despite the importance of these dangers, though, many drivers are unaware of one of the biggest driving hazards — the dark. Robert Tamburo, a project scientist in the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute, along with Srinivasa Narasimhan, an associate professor of robotics at Carnegie Mellon University, are working to reduce this hazard by developing a smart headlight that allows drivers to use high beam headlights without blinding oncoming drivers.
Despite a severe decrease in traffic, over 40 percent of all fatal car accidents occur at night. According to the National Organizations for Youth Safety, driving at night is a top cause of car accidents due to the inability of the eye to respond properly to switches between bright lights and darkness. The combination of bright headlights from oncoming cars and surrounding darkness can cause drivers’ eyes to make continual adjustments that impair vision.
Tamburo and Narasimhan have developed a smart headlight that reduces the risk behind high beam headlights. “With our programmable system.... we can actually make headlights that are even brighter than today’s without causing distractions for other drivers on the road,” Narasimhan said in a university press release. The smart headlight is comprised of a Digital Light Processing (DLP) projector, as opposed to standard headlights, which are comprised of standard light bulbs or clusters of LEDs. The DLP projector splits the light into a million minuscule beams that can each be controlled independently by a computer.
This increased control allows the headlight to recognize, track, and respond to oncoming cars as well as road signs and drops of precipitation. After sensing an object, the headlight can turn off small sections of the high beam to prevent glare; this includes blacking out the light that would shine into the eyes of oncoming drivers, as well as the light that would reflect off precipitation back into the drivers’ eyes. In addition, the headlight can increase brightness when beneficial; for example, upon the perception of street signs, traffic lane lines, or moving objects on the side of the road.
Even with these changes in headlight brightness, the headlight intensity appears virtually unchanged to the driver due to the small size of the adjustment. The system latency — the time it takes for the projector to adjust illumination — is also small, falling between one and 2.5 milliseconds. By employing such quick alterations the headlight minimizes visual distraction for the driver from variations in light intensity.
The smart headlight offers a new way to minimize the risk of nighttime driving, yet there is still work to be done. The current model of the headlight is larger than standard headlights, which limits its application. At its current size, the headlight can only be used for larger vehicles such as trucks and buses, which are prone to glare. Future miniaturization of the headlight could lead to more widespread usage.
Along with Tamburo and Narasimhan, the research team includes Takeo Kanade, professor of computer science and robotics, Anthony Rowe, assistant research professor of electrical and computer engineering,master’s students Abhishek Chugh, Subhagato Dutta, and Vinay Palakkode, and Eriko Nurvitadhi and Mei Chen of Intel Research. 
This research is part of the Technologies for Safe and Efficient Transportation Center, a U.S. Department of Transportation University Transportation Center at Carnegie Mellon, and was backed by Ford Motor Company, the Intel Science and Technology Center for Embedded Computing, the Office of Naval Research, and the National Science Foundation. Tamburo, the lead engineer, presented the research on September 10 at the European Conference on Computer Vision in Zurich, Switzerland.

Carnegie Mellon’s Center for Nucleic Acids Science and Technology (CNAST) brings together researchers to form a multidisciplinary approach for developing synthetic nucleic acids that have the potential to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases. Recently, the center received a gift from the DSF Charitable Foundation for $3.1 million.
Bruce Armitage, professor of chemistry, biological sciences, and biomedical engineering and co-director of CNAST, explained that a large portion of the center’s research involves peptide nucleic acids (PNAs), which are synthetic analogs to the DNA and RNA found within living organisms. Their similarity allows PNAs to bind to DNA and RNA in the cell, impacting gene function.
In 2006, CNAST researcher and Carnegie Mellon associate professor of chemistry Danith Ly developed a double-stranded form of PNA called Janus PNA. Armitage said that “researchers from around the world were intrigued and wanted a sample to use in their own experiments.” The researchers founded a biotech startup called PNA Innovations, Inc. to market the newly developed synthetic nucleic acid. Armitage added that “the new funding will enable Dr. Ly to further develop Janus PNAs and incorporate some of his newer ideas to improve the molecule.”
The DSF Charitable Foundation’s goal is to promote excellence in the three program areas of health, human services, and education. CNAST’s projects have the potential to develop tools for improving understanding of biological functions. After understanding the cause of complex diseases, the molecules developed by CNAST could be used to generate treatments for a plethora of diseases, such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson’s Disease, and various cancers.
In addition to research, CNAST plays a large role in promoting excellence in education. Armitage, referring to an educational outreach program called DNAzone, which targets K-12 students, explained that the program’s goal is to “expose students to the modern and exciting state-of-the-art aspects of nucleic science and foster their interest in science and mathematics.”
Armitage said that when he and another Carnegie Mellon professor, John Woolford, started CNAST, their goal was to build a network of researchers. Many years later, CNAST has become a community of researchers at both Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.

Tired of losing your apartment keys, purse, and laptop? Need to find them quickly as you’re rushing out your front door on the way to classes?
Tile, a simplistic square device created by a startup company founded by Nick Evans and Mike Farley, allows buyers to find the things they attach the device to with the help of a phone app. A user  can attach the tile, no bigger than a key, to almost anything. 
There’s a small hole in the top corner of the device to pull a string or chain through to secure it to any desired object — as long as the user can get creative when trying to attach the device to accessories without obvious attachment places, like a laptop or tablet.
But how does the square piece of technology help people locate the things they lose?
Tile is essentially a Bluetooth-transmitting device that connects wirelessly to a phone to keep track of where a lost object is at a given moment. The device uses Bluetooth 4.0, which was first introduced in cell phones in the iPhone 4S. Compared to previous Bluetooth technology, Bluetooth 4.0 consumes very little energy, meaning devices do not waste as much battery. 
According to the device’s website, a Tile can last for about a year without the user needing to charge the battery. After that year, the website also states that the company will help users recycle their old Tiles and replace them with their most current model. 
The device works like this: Say your roommate borrows your laptop to do some work and moves to your dorm’s lounge. The Tile attached to the laptop will stay connected with your phone to show the movement of the portable computer as your roommate moves it into the lounge. Tiles have a Bluetooth radius of about 100 feet, meaning that the device will tell you the location of the object it is attached to is as long as the Tile is in range. Of course, there are many factors that can disrupt or weaken a Bluetooth signal, including walls or other large barriers. If the Tile is not in range, the phone app can only tell you the last location that it was able to pick up.
Tile also offers the option for users to find items through Community Find. This feature allows other phones with the downloaded Tile app to pick up on a Tile’s location as long as the app is running. 
For example, someone else with the Tile app open on a 61A headed to Giant Eagle will pick up the signal of the Tile attached to your wallet that you dropped earlier under the seat. Your own Tile app will let you know that someone else’s Tile app picked up on your lost object. The person whose Tile app picked up your device won’t be able to see the device’s location. Even if your Tile is out of range, it’s possible to get real-time updates about its location from other Tile users, who are, at the moment, slim compared to the number of cell phone users on the planet. This feature may need a larger base of users before it is actually a feasible way to find objects out of range.
The app can support eight Tiles and contains a circular bar that shows users when they’re getting closer to their Tile. When they’re far away, the Tile’s signal will show up weak on the screen. But as users get closer to the lost object, the app will show increased signal strength, meaning they’re getting closer to their mark.
When users get close to the Tile, there’s an option to activate sound through a built-in speaker.
The device and its accompanying app works on phones running iOS7 or iOS8 on the iPhone 4S or later. Currently, there is no Tile app for Android devices, although the website has an Android Engineer job listing posted to its website.

Each year, robots play a larger role in the economy. Last week, self-driving cars won the right to drive on public roads in California. Drones now play a significant part in modern warfare. 
If you think professional jobs are immune from the encroachment of automation, then consider that stock trading is now performed by algorithms, Coursera offers university courses online, and IBM’s Watson is being applied to drug discovery. Companies such as Boston Dynamics, Rethink Robotics, and iRobot are collaborating with universities to pioneer the role of robotics in all aspects of society. In light of all this, Pugwash decided to discuss whether or not robots are making humans obsolete.
Increased automation can dramatically increase productivity and is often welcomed by industry, as seen in the agriculture sector. However, today the increase in productivity does not imply increased employment — a trend typically enjoyed in the 20th century. These changes can potentially cause significant disruption to the labor forces of the economy. As Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee said in the 2011 book Race Against the Machine, new technologies are “encroaching into human skills in a way that is completely unprecedented.”
To increase employment rates, the unemployed must be trained to work in a diminishing pool of increasingly specialized jobs. The sluggish recovery from the global financial crisis and record levels of university attendance are a strong indication that technological change is causing job losses to outstrip job creation. And the role of automated work in the economy is only going to increase.
Although economists are divided about how job creation will adapt to a more automated economy in the long term, in the near future an automated economy will be a major contributor to wealth inequality. We are already observing this consequence. When a small number of online travel agents and tax preparation services can automatically do the job of many office-based travel agents or tax branches, wealth that was distributed among many businesses and employees is funneled into a select number of business owners who operate a more automated service. Likewise, when Walmart replaces employees with automated checkouts, wealth that was previously distributed to workers is retained as greater profit. Evidence of this increasing inequality can be seen in the stagnating median income, despite growing productivity. Unreasonably large wealth inequality hollows out the middle class and is a catalyst for the segregation of society and social unrest. Therefore, it is important to manage this challenge with appropriate economic policy.
What happens when we take this to the logical extreme? Imagine a utopia where all essential professional, white collar, and low-skill jobs are largely automated by robots or software that is owned by a small number of organizations. Wealth is accumulated through the economy without the need for wages to be paid to employees. Changes in taxation laws would be necessary to support widespread redundancy in this automated economy and allow the entire society to enjoy the fruits of an automated economy. Without these changes, we would expect large disparity between the owners of the technology and the remaining population. The development of major projects that occupy redundant citizens at an expense may become more commonplace if the increased wealth from the productive automated economy can be taxed appropriately. 
For instance, in the United States, large-scale government projects, such as the military, currently provide employment for many who would struggle to find work elsewhere.
In a world where humans no longer need to work to sustain their livelihood, what would people do with their time? An automated economy may see the rise of a parallel leisure economy, in which people no longer need to spend their time working for an income. Many people would be content to spend their time playing games, traveling, or working for enjoyment rather than necessity. However, one concern is that in the face of a catastrophic event where the artificial intelligence that humans rely on is incapacitated, civilization may totally collapse, with society no longer having the means to operate in the absence of machines.
Such a utopian leisure economy would be contingent on a fair distribution of wealth among its citizens. However, this assumption is a very bold one to make. 
If we descend from our utopian fairytale, we may find that those who own the technology enjoy the leisure economy that its wealth provides while the remaining populace is left with the crumbs, unable to compete with an economy of robots. Hopefully, if there comes a time when we must choose between these two scenarios, we will choose wisely.
Student Pugwash is a non-advocacy, educational organization that discusses the implications of science. This article is a summary of last week’s discussion on if robots will make humans obsolete.

India becomes first Asian nation to reach Mars
Although it is not the first nation in the world to do so, India has managed to launch an orbiter to Mars, a task that only the United States, the Soviet Union, and the European Space Agency have accomplished thus far. 
But unlike these entities, India has done so with a relatively small budget of $74 million. NASA, for example, spent $671 million in order for the Maven mission to succeed. In addition, the mission succeeded on the first try, a feat unmatched by the U.S. and the Soviet Union.
The project was part of the Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) in the Indian Space Research Organisation. Named Mangalyaan (or “Mars Craft” in Hindi), it will stay in elliptical orbit of Mars in order to map its surface and study its atmosphere. It was first announced in Aug. 12, and a little over two years later, the Mangalyaan had begun to orbit the red planet.

The origin of water has always been a mystery, but scientists have recently discovered that most of the water in the solar system probably existed as ice that was formed in space. In order to learn where the water came from, scientists focused their study on the water molecules themselves. By looking at the ratio of hydrogen to deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen with about double the mass of hydrogen, they were able to determine under which conditions the water molecules formed. 
In the study, the researchers produced models with no external ice and tried to determine the amount of deuterium in ice that would be created over a million years. However, the models could not produce the same ratios of hydrogen to deuterium, which led scientists to conclude that a significant portion of the solar system’s water had come from outside the solar system, making it older than the sun.

Telomerase can be controlled to turn cells on and off
Researchers at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, in La Jolla, Calif., have found a switch in cells that may contain the secret to aging in cells. This switch could possibly turn a cell’s aging on and off at any time. This could promote healthy aging and cause healthy cells to keep dividing indefinitely.
Most cells contain telomeres, a sequence of repeated nucleotides that protect the ends of chromosomes and act as a timekeeper of cells that shortens every time the cell splits. The telomere can be rebuilt by telomerase, which some cells possess. In the study, telomerase was found to be controllable — it could be turned off at any time. While the duplication of a cell goes on, telomerase disassembles, then reassembles in the off state. This switch can help regulate cell growth, which has applications in cancer research.

Facebook to start testing Wi-Fi drones next year
As the tech giants are starting to consider bringing Internet to locations all over the world, Facebook is backing a drone-based project that could put Internet drones in the sky. The drone would beam Internet access to people through a variety of methods. 
One method involves satellite or free-space optical communication (FSO) technology, which allows data to be transmitted via invisible, infrared laser beams. 
The drones would be able to stay afloat for months on end, even with the large design. The drones are currently as large as a Boeing 747, but much lighter. According to Facebook, the drones would have the weight of around four tires while being as long as five cars. 
The solar powered drones would operate between 60,000 and 90,000 feet. In addition, the drones can be either unmanned or have an operator.

Nanothreads made from benzene are thin, yet strong
Scientists have recently discovered how to create extremely thin wires made of diamond that are stronger and stiffer than any other existing nanotube or polymer.
To create the diamond nanothreads, extremely high pressures were applied to benzene, a chemical compound which consists of six carbon atoms in a ring with a hydrogen bonded to each carbon. Using a slow decrease in pressure over time, a six millimeter-wide mass of benzene can be compressed into carbon tetrahedrons, which form the diamond nanothreads. The problem with this method, however, is the high pressures that are required for the reaction to occur. Currently, such pressures are only limited to a few cubic millimeters, so these nanothreads are unfeasible for mass production. Even so, these incredibly thin yet strong nanothreads would make the space elevator a possibility.

U.S. carbon emissions continue to increase
Although the Obama administration has been attempting to curb the growth of global warming, emissions of carbon dioxide have increased six percent over the last two years. This increase is a problem for President Obama, who touted the United States’ progress in reducing emissions earlier this year. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), for example, proposed a 30-percent national cut on carbon emissions. Solar and wind energy are also used. However, coal use has fallen in favor of natural gas, which also traps heat and could contribute to global warming. Crude oil production has also increased 31 percent, causing many greenhouse gases to be formed. At this rate, scientists estimate that temperatures could increase 5.8 to 9.7 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century.

“Paradise” is a word that means something different to everyone — it can conjure images of serene bliss, reckless violence, vast treasures, or simple pleasures. We often construct paradises in our minds, places where our inner thoughts and desires are set free and allowed to fulfill themselves. In “Paradise,” a display at The Frame gallery by junior fine arts majors Nicholas Sardo and Daniel Kim, this mental palace is brought into the real world. The artists use the walls of the gallery to create a paradise for their inner thoughts to roam free and express themselves.
“Paradise” is clearly influenced by street art; Kim, who handled the acrylic ink drawings said he draws much inspiration from rap music and hip-hop culture. Sardo also referenced this influence in his choice of spray paint as the medium for many of his contributions.
Many of the images are surreal, humorous, and, though there is no intended narrative, message-laden. Sandcastles sprout hairy arms and legs, a Ku Klux Klan member sports robes bearing the middle finger, and four-eyed swans fly alongside four-eyed devils.
“We’re a generation that lives in our own heads a lot of the time, so we wanted to take those characters that live in our imaginations and set them free,” Sardo said.
The centerpiece of the work is Baffi, a large blue creature that snakes along the walls. Ruptures in his body suggest that the rest of the world is exploding out of him, ripping him apart in the process.
“All of these characters are original inventions for this show, although elements of them appear in some of my other work.… Baffi is an example of that; he’s a character I’ve been working with for a few years,” Sardo explained.
The two artists constructed the piece over the course of a week, bringing in a rough outline of how it would look but primarily allowing their creativity and feeling to determine the particulars. “We listened to a lot of My Chemical Romance,” Kim said.
Audience reactions at the show’s opening on Friday night were positive, with guests slowly walking around the room, inspecting each aspect of the incredibly rich world the artists had created on the wall.
“It’s exciting.… There’s a lot of movement happening in this piece, and it gives a lot of life to the show,” said junior fine arts major Carolina Vogt.
“Paradise” also incorporates the use of sculpture in a large, pink creature adorned with thick lips curled in a tight, menacing smile and what appears to be a string of intestines running out of the door. Furthermore, color is used sparesely and interestingly highlights some of the more disgusting elements of the piece, such as the slugs that adorn one wall.
All in all, “Paradise” is an immersive and imaginative experience that begs its visitors to look at the world around them with a fresh and interesting perspective. It will be on display at The Frame through next Sunday.

With fall now in full force, there is an onslaught of new shows premiering this week. Following are first impressions (without spoilers) of six highly anticipated new shows airing this fall.
Madam Secretary
This new drama focuses on Elizabeth McCord (Téa Leoni), a self-righteous ex-CIA history professor cherry picked to be the Secretary of State. Lesson of the day: Don’t get on your history professor’s bad side. The show isn’t bad, but it isn’t great. Look for Madam Secretary on CBS, Sunday nights at 8 p.m.
Transparent
A comedic drama, this show documents how a family copes with their 68-year-old patriarchal father coming out as transgender. With Arrested Development’s George/Oscar Bluth (Jeffrey Tambor) playing the lead, what more could you ask for? But for real, this show looks really fantastic. It’s definitely worth checking out. All episodes have been available for streaming on Amazon since Friday, and it could very well be Amazon’s first hit.
Gotham
Gotham is an obvious attempt to attract fans of Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy and ABC’s Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. It picks up what almost every Batman movie skips over: the portion of Bruce Wayne’s life in between his parents’ death and adulthood. But since it’s just plain stupid to have a television show revolve around a small boy, Gotham revolves around the cop trying to solve who killed the Batman-to-be’s parents. It’s just up to you to get over the myriad of over-the-top characters. Example 1: The dashing cop, Detective James Gordon (Ben McKenzie), who is on a mission for justice. Example 2: His law-bending partner, Detective Harvey Bullock (Donal Logue), who has good intentions but not the best execution. Example 3: The merciless and aggressive villain, Fish Mooney (Jada Pinkett Smith), whose web of alliances and sidekicks starts to crumble. Gotham airs on FOX Monday nights at 8 p.m.
Black-ish
This new comedy is about an African American family living in the blindly white, affluent suburbs of Los Angeles and racial tendencies in the 21st century. It’s basically a black comedian’s stand up routine, but rated PG. Within the first episode, stereotypes such as African American’s inclination toward basketball and fried chicken are explored. With that being said, Black-ish has its chuckle moments and I would recommend checking it out. Black-ish airs on ABC Wednesday nights at 8:30 p.m.
How to Get Away With Murder
Take Scandal, turn it down a notch, add some Viola Davis, set it up in a law school, and you have How to Get Away With Murder. This mouthful of a show focuses on Annalise Keating (Davis), a law professor, and her rigorous class that pushes her students to extremes (hopefully) not exercised at Carnegie Mellon. I have a feeling this show will be around for a while (see: other Shonda Rhimes dramas on ABC), so I would recommend watching it. How to Get Away With Murder airs on ABC Thursday nights at 10 p.m.

Whether it’s for the plot line, for our favorite actors and actresses, or for the sake of routine, we all have shows we tune in to regularly. In my case, it’s to check out the fashion worn by the characters on the show — I use it to inspire my wardrobe choices for the week.
Each TV show has its own characteristic style. At times this flavor is so dynamic that the characters inspire fashion choices across the country. For example, when Gossip Girl first aired, Blair Waldorf’s headbands took the country by storm. Department stores began to sell the preppy staple in a multitude of colors and patterns, ranging from polka dots to stripes to flowers. The headband trend died down eventually, as most fashion fads do. However, for a lot of people, the headband remains a staple accessory. Just as many other trends have gained popularity through silver and small screen, the fashion in shows makes up a significant part of pop culture.
Headbands weren’t the only thing in Gossip Girl to make waves in the fashion world when it was airing. The two main characters, Serena and Blair, presented styles that people immediately attempted to emulate. Although both are Upper East Side New Yorkers, they wear outfits that are radically different. Yet, despite the incongruencies of their style choices, they act as perfect complements to one another. Serena’s almost Bohemian vibe offsets the “classiness” of Blair’s wardrobe, while Blair’s prim and proper fashion accents the “cool, barely-trying” look Serena pulls off.
Blair is quintessentially preppy. Known not only for her headbands, Blair is also renowned for wearing bright colors — especially bright tights, girly dresses, and feminine skirts. If you want to get Blair’s look, shop at J. Crew: it’s the number one place to pick up all your preppy essentials.
Francesca’s Collections is also a great place to get Blair-like clothes. They sell a lot of blouses, which the character (or, actually, Gossip Girl’s costume designer) would pair with a nice skirt and heels or ballet flats. These flats are another style that Gossip Girl brought into the fashion world — they have been in style since the show’s premiere in 2007.
While Blair’s look is easy to describe, Serena’s style is a lot more nebulous. Serena, the other half of Gossip Girl’s dynamic fashion duo, is distinct for outfits that are put together, yet maintain a definite Bohemian edge. Her primary staple is the leather jacket; she has a variety of these, all ranging in cut and color.
Not all of us can be characters on Gossip Girl with unlimited shopping funds; however, we can still emulate Serena’s style with one nice leather jacket paired with various outfits. In episodes taking place during the summer, Serena wears bright and bold maxi dresses, paired with statement necklaces, of which she appears to be a fan. In almost every episode of the final season, Serena wears a large necklace with her outfit. If you’re looking to imitate Serena’s style, Anthropologie is a great place to look for clothing and accessories like these.
Another show that offers style inspiration is New Girl. The show features its protagonists, Jess and Cece, wearing cool and collected styles. After watching an episode, I sometimes find myself incorporating their style into my outfits. Jess and Cece are people with completely different styles. Jess’s is quirky and indie while Cece keeps it cool and casual. If you want to dress like Jess, definitely check out Modcloth. Jess wears a lot of polka dots, sweaters with animals, and blouses with Peter Pan collars. While her style is somewhat conservative, it is undeniably cute. Cece’s style is on the other side of the spectrum and, therefore, easier to copy. She dresses casually: usually a T-shirt with an interesting cut or design paired with jeans. This kind of clothing can be found just about anywhere. Check out stores like Urban Outfitters for interestingly styled tees.
Yet another TV show that has made a huge impact with fashion is Pretty Little Liars. Aria, Spencer, Hanna, and Emily, the four main characters, are known for their own unique styles. The costume designer for the show, Mandi Line, has even specified that her intention was to create styles that will make an impact and that other girls will want to follow.
Each character’s style has changed over the seasons. Aria’s starts out as edgy-Bohemian, then evolves to become quirky and bold. She pairs the sort of things that one would not expect to look good together, like florals with stripes, and ends up looking flawless. In fact, it’s speculated that Aria may have been the source of the shorts-with-tights trend that came into style when the show started. To find a style that’s bold and quirky like Aria’s, shop at Topshop and Urban Outfitters. Aria also loves accessorizing, so wear a lot of jewelry if you want to get her look!
Spencer’s style is preppy, but a lot more Victorian than Blair’s from Gossip Girl. Spencer rejects bright colors, opting for a darker, more muted color palette. Many of her clothes actually come from Urban Outfitters, so for some of her preppier or vintage items, this is the place to shop!
Hanna’s style used to be glamorous but has recently moved toward edgy. As of late, she’s wearing ripped tights, ripped shirts, and embraces gray, dark green, and black as her color scheme.
Finally, Emily has also amped up her style from the beginning of the series to now. Gone are the days of plain T-shirts and jeans; she’s moved on to sweaters and shirts that feature unique cuts. To dress like Emily, shop at edgy stores like All Saints.
As you can see, TV shows are a great source of fashion inspiration that you can use to put together your day-to-day outfits. If you’re ever feeling lackluster and bored with your wardrobe, turn on the tube; it’s the perfect place to get a fresh feel for fashion.

The newest young adult dystopian literary sensation, The Maze Runner, is basically a hybrid of Lost, Lord of the Flies, and The Hunger Games that’s been adapted for the silver screen to win over the plethora of teenagers who are looking for a new hero to root for.
The Maze Runner is a pretty refreshing addition to the YA subgenre, but it ultimately seems to be lost in the crowded labyrinth of YA film adaptations in which the mandatory plot must be fueled in a dystopian setting with an unwilling, oppressed hero.
The Maze Runner immediately thrusts viewers into the film in a dark, cramped cage with an amnesic youth named Thomas (Dylan O’Brien). He is offered up to a group of boys who inhabit a pasture called The Glade which is surrounded by an enormous Maze. 
The Gladers, as the boys call themselves, taunt Thomas while adapting him to their confined world. They, too, have similar memory loss and can only remember their names, which helps thicken the plot ever so slightly. 
Thomas is immediately intrigued by the Maze, but Gally (Will Poulter) adamantly shuts him down, saying only the Runners go through the Maze during the day as they try to find an escape. 
During the night, they come back to the Glade, as the doors of the Maze slide shut and biomechanical arachnids called Grievers wander the Maze. This process has been going on for three years, during which the Runners have made futile attempts to find an escape.
When fighting with Gally, Thomas slams his head on the ground and, instead of experiencing a bad migraine, he suddenly remembers his name and the crowd of boys cheer for him, even though they were jeering at him literally ten seconds before, as Thomas clearly lost the fight. At least Thomas has recovered a sliver of his identity. 
Fortunately, the film doesn’t focus on Thomas trying to figure out his past. That part is covered through conveniently scattered flashbacks that are imbued in blue (for some reason, all flashbacks in dystopian movies seem to be in blue) in the form of Thomas’s dreams. Through these dreams, it’s revealed that he used to work for a corporation called W.C.K.D. which experimented on the Gladers. The mantra “W.C.K.D is good” is echoed repeatedly through the film, propelling a hackneyed mystery that signals there is a bigger objective behind the Maze.
As mentioned before, Thomas doesn’t really care about who he once was. His main goal is to survive, which means going through the Maze, much to the opposition of Gally, who believes that it’s safer to inhabit the Glade and coexist with the Grievers.
Of course, Thomas goes through the Maze during the night and, having survived one night in the Maze, he inevitably disrupts the equilibrium that the Gladers have established. Soon, the need to escape the Glade becomes more urgent and Thomas takes the lead to venture into the Maze. 
Some parts are thrilling, while some fall flat. We’ve seen many of these plot points time and time again.
As visual effects artist Wes Ball’s first film, The Maze Runner is a refreshingly visual film that doesn’t get overwhelmed by CGI or unnecessary love triangles. Unfortunately, the last act of the film is dedicated to setting up the premise of the sequel, which ends up being way more frustrating than satisfying. However, that seems to be a prerequisite in the hopes that they will skyrocket to franchise-level success. A seemingly necessary evil in the world of YA film adaptations.

Popular Problems, released on Sept. 22, is a low-key pop-folk album by 80-year-old Leonard Cohen. Naturally, the album offers a few unique perspectives on life, coming from someone who, I want to reiterate, is 80 years old. The album has some good production, but issues such as inconsistently interesting sounds, genre archetypes, and odd instrumental decisions keep this album from being a great pop album.
The lyrical content here ranges from completely boring to rather insightful. On the song “Almost Like the Blues,” Cohen muses about life after death, singing in his characteristically gruff and sultry voice, “There is no God in heaven/ And there is no Hell below/ So says the great professor of all there is to know/ But I’ve had the invitation that a sinner can’t refuse/ And it’s almost like salvation; it’s almost like the blues.” The idea that there is no Heaven and Hell, except here on Earth, where Cohen gets his “salvation” from music, is rather interesting despite the cliché.
Cohen also has some remarkably poetic metaphors in songs like “Samson in New Orleans” and “Born in Chains.” They are a real treat to listen to orated in Cohen’s unique voice. Contrasting this with rather boring lyrics on “My Oh My,” “You Got Me Singing,” and “Slow” (literally about taking things slow), makes me wish Cohen had included more retrospection on the album.
The production is similarly spotty. Cohen uses electronic-keyboard bass lines and percussion (specifically a lot of cymbals), usually the same ones with some variation, on every song. Every song has a rather minimalist approach to its production, which works for some songs, but backfires on others.
On “Slow,” for example, the low-key bluesy keyboard backbeat works really well. But the piano and cymbals on a song like “Samson in New Orleans” is rather static and boring. Cohen accents his voice well when he adds some midrange, either in the form of non-electronic piano, guitar, or maracas, like in the songs  like “You Got Me Singing” and “Almost Like the Blues.”
You won’t find anything remotely sonically challenging on this album. The blues beats are very archetypal and, a lot of times, aren’t all that interesting. Cohen also uses female backup singers on nearly every song, with varying efficiency. 
On “Slow,” the female singers rather sharply disrupt the feel of the song — the song is meant to be low key and, well... slow. Cohen’s low, gruff voice accomplishes this rather well: Having perfect-sounding high-range backup speakers come out of nowhere really disrupts the feel of the song. 
In the song “Nevermind,” however, the backup singers blend really well with Cohen’s voice. They work to accent it, and smoothly move underneath in the musical space. The foreign sounding chanting on that song also sounds pretty cool. On “Born in Chains,” the backup singers work to save what otherwise is a rather vanilla production, lending it a really nice gospel feel.
The album has some good production, and interesting lyrics, but seldom on the same song. Suffice to say, Cohen has quite the consistency problem in his album. It’s a shame, because if all the pieces that Cohen demonstrates had come together in the right way, he would have had a hit album with some really great songs. As it is, though, the album is simply too inconsistent to warrant a universal recommendation.

Chicken is cheap. Chicken is delicious. It goes with almost everything; it can be fancy or no-frills; and generally, it’s pretty hard to mess up. Here are three levels of chicken: easy, less easy, and Jamie Oliver.
Easy: Chicken Parmesan
It’s a classic date night dish for a reason, okay? And one of those reasons happens to be that it’s easy as pie to make. The ingredients are truly simple and fairly inexpensive, but there are levels here, people. You can choose just to buy spaghetti sauce and pre-seasoned breadcrumbs or you can go hardcore and really, truly make it from scratch. It’s a personal choice. No judgment here.
Chicken breasts (try to buy the tenders at the store, but if the tenders aren’t there, you can just slice bigger breasts in half)
Flour
Breadcrumbs (pre-seasoned or homemade)
2 eggs, beaten in a bowl
One jar of spaghetti sauce (or your own gourmet version)
Olive oil
Slices of Parmesan cheese (or fresh mozzarella, which is my personal preference)
Salt, pepper, red pepper, and Italian seasoning
Spaghetti, cooked and drained
1) Start by heating the olive oil in a pan. Let it warm up while you work. Save time, eat better. 
2) Get out two small plates and one shallow bowl. On the plates, pour about one-third cup each of flour and breadcrumbs. In the bowl, crack and beat the eggs. 
3) Use a fork to grab one of the pieces of chicken. First, coat it in flour, then dip it in the egg, and finally coat it in breadcrumbs. I swear this is the hardest part. Repeat until all of the chicken is breaded, and then put it into the pan, where it’s going to cook quickly. Use a fork to turn it over so the breading cooks evenly. When the fork goes through the meat easily, it’s probably cooked. But! Because it’s chicken and can give you some nasty diseases if you eat it raw, make sure to cut at least one piece open and make sure that the meat is white all the way through — no pink spots and no pink juices. Season generously. 
4) When the chicken is cooked through, pour the spaghetti sauce on top. It should mix with the extra olive oil and start bubbling. Reduce the temperature and let everything stew for a bit. 
5) Put the slices of cheese on top of the chicken and sauce, then cover the pan and watch for the cheese to melt. If you’re cooking for a date or just feel like being fancy, pop that pan into the oven and broil it for five minutes tops to get a nice crust on the cheese. Add some more Italian seasoning for aesthetic quality, and serve on top of a mountain of pasta. Mamma mia.
Less Easy: Chicken Aglio e Olio
While this recipe isn’t dreadfully difficult, it’s a step up from your basic chicken parm. There’s a definite level of sophistication in figuring out how to time all of this so your pasta isn’t overcooked, your spices are just right, and everything is mixed in. I would recommend grilling the chicken that you plan to use, as it adds a nice smoky flavor that complements the garlic well. Alternatively, just lightly cook it in some oil in a hot pan. Good luck, soldier.
Chicken breasts, grilled and sliced (do ahead of time)
Fettuccini noodles
1 cube of chicken bullion 
Large bunch of fresh parsley
5-6 cloves of garlic
Portabella mushrooms, sliced
Plenty of olive oil
Salt, pepper, crushed red pepper flakes, oregano
1) Start by cooking the pasta. Fact: most pasta takes about 12 to 13 minutes to soften to the perfect al dente. For this recipe, take it off of the stove at eight minutes, and drain all but two cups of the pasta water from the pan. Dissolve the chicken bullion in the remaining water. (I recommend in a glass measuring cup so you don’t burn/melt yourself/your Tupperware) Then turn the heat way down and let it simmer. 
2) While the pasta is cooking, you can be prepping other ingredients. If you tell your friends/families/girlfriend/boyfriend this, it will make you sound like a MasterChef. True story. 
3) The chicken should definitely be grilled by now, so slice the breasts into long, thin slices. Set aside.
4) Peel the cloves of garlic and slice them into thin slivers. Set aside.
5) Clean your mushrooms (wash them well!), and then slice them into bite-sized pieces, depending on how big your mouth is. Set aside. (Are you running out of room in your kitchen yet?)
6) Take the bunch of parsley and chop the stems off. Throw them away, then go back to chopping away at the leaves, which, by this point, will smell amazing. Keep chopping until the knife stops making crunching sounds  — this means that the leaves are all smaller, more edible sizes now.
7) Okay. Now that everything is prepped and cooked, it’s time to get ready to roll. Everything is about to happen in record speed, so pay attention and have at it. Godspeed.
8) Pour a generous glug or two of olive oil into a pan and heat it. You’ll know it’s hot enough to move on when you flick water into the oil and it freaks out and splutters all over the place. 
9) When the oil is heated, add the peppercorns, red pepper, oregano, and garlic. Let all of those sizzle for a few minutes but not too long. Burned spices are the opposite of fun. Throw the mushrooms in. Then, when those start to cook down (you can tell because they’ll be softer, smaller, and releasing juices), add the parsley.
10) By this time, you’ll have your pasta done and simmering. When you’re ready, pour the noodles and any remaining liquid in that pot into the pan you’re using. You might need to add more olive oil at this point to keep everything nice and coated.
11) Stir that around for a few minutes to let the flavors mingle (I use tongs so I can boss that pasta around) and then add the chicken. 
12) Serve it up with some fresh parsley on top, and make sure everyone gets equal portions of pasta, mushrooms, and chicken. No one likes a biased chef.
Jamie Oliver: Super Fancy Stuffed Chicken
Poultry goes posh. Time to get real, people. This recipe is adapted from Jaime Oliver, and if you don’t know him, you should. He’s an adorable British chef with a fantastic YouTube channel and, clearly, a way with chicken. This recipe is not for the faint of heart. You have no place in level three super-fancy-stuffed-chicken-world if you’re not okay with pounding a chicken to make it thinner. Just saying.
Chicken breasts
18 oz. of portabella mushrooms diced into nice, small cubes
1 bunch of parsley (again)
Salt, pepper, and garlic powder
Olive oil
2 cloves of garlic, sliced thinly
2 cups of white wine
1 cup of Dijon mustard
1) Preheat your oven to 400 degrees.
2) To prepare your chicken breasts to be stuffed, you have to do a little work. This is all worth it, I promise. But don’t get squeamish on me, okay? Take a knife and, with the thinner end of the breast facing away from you, slice a vertical opening into the breast all the way. Make sure it’s deep enough to hold your filling but not so deep that it punctures the other side of the meat. You should be able to slide your fingers in but not see them poke through. Got that? Woo. Okay. Set your sliced chicken aside, and prep the stuffing.
3) Drizzle a generous serving of olive oil into a pan over medium to high heat and then add the mushrooms. Season the mushrooms to taste, then add the parsley. Let it all cook together, then, when the mushroom juices are released, set it aside to cool. 
4) While you’re waiting for it to cool, get a casserole dish or a baking pan for the oven and cover it with tinfoil for cooking your chicken.
5) Here comes the stuffing part: take the cooled mushrooms and parsley and jam it into the hole that you made in the chicken breasts. If it doesn’t completely close all the way, that’s okay. A little overflow never hurt anyone. 
6) Put the chicken in a pan, and bake for about 40 minutes, or until the juices run clear when you poke the chicken with a fork. You may want to cut into it with a knife just to make sure it’s done. Everyone’s oven is unique.
7) While the chicken is cooking, make the sauce. You can just use the same pan from before to save time on dishes. It’s all going to the same place, right? 
8) Sauté the garlic in olive oil and add salt and pepper. Don’t let it burn!
9) Add the white wine, and bring it to a boil. Let it cook for a while to reduce the alcohol. When the mixture has reduced to about two-thirds of its original volume, add the mustard and whisk the wine into the mustard. 
10) Let it cook for a few minutes, but not too long, because then your sauce will be thick and lumpy.
11) When your chicken and sauce are done, serve the chicken drizzled with the sauce and watch as mouths all around you drool, drop, and devour.
This recipe was inspired in parts by www.jaimeoliver.com and www.cookingwithcaitlin.com.
General Chicken Tips
Chicken isn’t high-grade salmon. This is a protein that needs to be cooked through and thoroughly checked to ensure that it’s not pink in the middle — because, you know, diseases and stuff.
Don’t let that scare you off though — chicken is my favorite thing to cook because there’s so much you can do with it. These are only three recipes of literally millions that you can find online or in your favorite cookbook. 
Go crazy, and, as the Chick-Fil-A cows say: “Eat mor chikin”.

Since Gene Simmons declared rock n’ roll dead, nobody wants to hear about the genre anymore. So take this column as my personal echo chamber.
British band Royal Blood is kick a**. A three word summary of their music would have to be “bassy riff rock.” They take the bassist/drummer lineup and use it to make music to dance to (and rightly so).
Check out their track “Ten Tonne Skeleton” from their self-titled (and first) album. It features a lead riff line reminiscent of CKY’s “96 Quite Bitter Beings,” a vocal melody that would please any fan of Muse’s album Supermassive Black Hole, and warm minimalist production. While listening to the track, my head bobs unless I make a conscious effort to avoid the action.
In listening to Royal Blood’s album, you tend to forget that Royal Blood is only comprised of two members. They sound so much larger. The only issue with the band is the lack of variety, but at this point in their career that’s fine with me.

With a summer full of sequels, How to Train Your Dragon 2 shined as a lighthearted and moral-packed family-friendly blockbuster. The sequel picks up with the main lead, Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel) sans one leg, and his trusty dragon sidekick, Toothless. Like any good sequel, the audience can tell how Hiccup has transformed from a measly boy in How to Train Your Dragon to a confident 20-year-old man. Together, Hiccup and Toothless have to fend off a threatening herd (gaggle? group? school?) of dragons led by an ill-intentioned villain, Drago (Djimon Hounsou). Throughout the movie, the viewer is taken on an immersive adventure with the help of great cinematography, direction, and score. If only the Khaleesi had watched these films, there would probably be less conflict in the Game of Thrones world.

Dear Evan,
I was waiting for the bus to get to Hofbrauhaus, and these two older guys in tattered clothes walked up. They started talking at me about restaurants that only let you in with a tie, about how poor we all are, and about how one of them is totally fine being poor ­­­­­­­— that if money rained down on him from the heavens, he would leave it behind. Then the bus came, and he asked me for 50 cents, and I said no. Should I have said yes?
Cheapskatedly,
Bumped into Eclectic, Eggplant-Round Man, Opted to Not Give Extra Rupees
Dear BEER MONGER,
You should have said yes.
He gave you valuable insight into the mind of a man who doesn’t give a crap about money, and that’s worth more than 50 cents. But paradoxically, he asked for the money — and for the somewhat odd amount of 50 cents, not for a dollar or more. Maybe he had to pay for parking nearby? Probably not. But honestly, what could he have gotten for 50 cents? A gum ball? A sticker tattoo? Party blowers? A candy G-string?
Although, if you needed that 50 cents to get your liter at Hofbrauhaus, then don’t even acknowledge the guy — beer is more important.
Or just buy some candy underwear,
Evan Kahn
Dear Evan,
I have this thing where I comment on women’s appearances to whoever is around to hear me. I make sure that the women can’t hear me, but I am frequently heard saying things like, “Girl’s ass is lookin’ fine in those … wait, are those shorts or pants?” and “I don’t remember her being that busty — is it a push-up bra? Her tank top?” I’m a gay man, so this is okay, right?
Judgmentally,
Often Boisterously Seen Excoriating Random, oft Vivacious In Nature, Girls
Dear OBSERVING,
Objectification is pretty looked down upon these days — but most everyone still does it. They just keep it to themselves. So, while I guess you not being attracted to women softens the issue a little, you still risk coming off as a douche if you verbalize it like that — especially because you’re gay. We shouldn’t talk about things we don’t understand.
But objectifying men is totally cool,
Evan Kahn

Senior decision science major Tonya Sedgwick delivered a speech on Friday in front of Warner Hall expressing dissatisfaction with Decisions That Matter, a university publication regarding sexual assault, as well as a quote by Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno printed in a Tartan news article responding to a Letter to the Editor signed by 35 past and current students, including Sedgwick.
On Sept. 12, Casalegno emailed the campus community enumerating the initiatives relating to sexual harassment and sexual violence that the university has established over the past year or plans to establish. Among the completed initiatives listed is the development of Decisions That Matter. Casalegno states in the email that the purpose of the publication is “to educate the university community about your rights, resources, and responsibilities regarding sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking.”
Sedgwick, speaking at approximately 4 p.m. through a megaphone and standing on a barrier in front of Warner Hall, said, “I’ve come before you today in an act of solidarity with my fellow students, some of whom have suffered not only at the hands of sexual predators, but also at the hands of university officials. This problem, which is not localized to Carnegie Mellon, nor to Pittsburgh, but to all of the United States of America and beyond, is one that has garnered recent attention from the White House and elsewhere.”
Sedgwick told a story about a boy she grew up with and his unwelcome advances (“attempting to convince me to have sex with him”). She said that when she told her friends she didn’t want to hang out with him in a group setting, her friends told her to stop “bashing” the boy — “as if saying ‘he tried to bully me into having sex with him’ was the same as slandering someone.”
She then said, “I want to talk to you, my fellow students, about Decisions That Matter, because the pamphlet that has been written under that name got it wrong.”
Sedgwick said that the pamphlet does not discourage perpetrators from committing acts of sexual violence nor outline consequences of these acts, but rather provides information telling people what actions to take to protect themselves from the potential of an assault.
“It is not the decisions of all of us that matter,” Sedgwick said, referring to the quote made by Casalegno published in The Tartan last week. “It is the decisions of those who have power that matter. In a situation where someone is a perpetrator, and someone is a victim, the perpetrator has all the power.”
Sedgwick said to those listening that people have a duty to act, “to speak up and say ‘Hey, that’s not okay — she asked you to stop.’ ”
“The most important person who can prevent sexual violence is you, and I want you to know it, and I want you to live it, and I want the university to give you the tools to do so,” she concluded.
Sedgwick asked if others would like to comment at the end of the speech, to which sophomore creative writing major Nathalie Kent said, “You said it well.”
Sedgwick later told The Tartan, “I think that it was important [to give the speech] because there were a lot of people who were upset or seemed upset with the pamphlet and other things relating to the pamphlet, but no one really was doing anything, and I believe that if you want to enforce change-making, that you should offer advice, but you should also make sure that people know — that people care about this.”
Casalegno attended the speech and, at its conclusion, spoke with Sedgwick, sitting with her on the barrier upon which the speech was delivered.
“I really appreciate that Tonya had the courage to step up in front of all of these people and share her own story and her thoughts about how we, as an institution, can do better in this regard,” Casalegno said. “We’ll only get better as an institution by people coming forward and talking about these issues and sharing their thoughts and their perspectives.”
Casalegno said that she was told about the speech by several students and “cleared my schedule to make sure that I could be here both to hear and listen, and also interact with other students who care about these issues.”
Casalegno also said that she discussed the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network (RAINN) with Sedgwick. Casalegno mentioned to The Tartan that the university amended a section of the Annual Security and Fire Safety Report last week based on resources about risk reduction education provided by RAINN, which describes itself as an anti-sexual assault organization. The 2014 guide is due to the campus by Wednesday, according to Casalegno.
The Annual Security and Fire Safety Report contains information about the university’s fire and safety policies and other resources for students. The 2013 report contained a section titled “Preventing and Responding to Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault.”
Junior directing major John Moriarty said of the speech, “I thought it was a great avenue for people who are concerned about sexual assault at Carnegie Mellon and elsewhere to be able to have their voices heard. I think it is a testament to the school how many people stopped and watched, but also how many people walked by.” 
“We are not a politically active campus, and that is very, very evident when it comes to this issue that is so close to us, that affects everyone, men and women,” Moriarty added.  “Tonya gives light and shows that there are students who do care, and the louder they are the more likely others will feel comfortable to stand up.”
Moriarty is creating a docudrama about how Carnegie Mellon and other colleges across the country have been handling sexual assault and rape cases, and the dialogues between students and faculty, focusing specifically on consequences for aggressors. Moriarty said he is pushing for clearer and harsher lines for aggressors, rather than case-by-case considerations.
“The current system that the school employs relies on the students’ trust in the administration and trust that the investigations are based in the students’ best interest,” he said. “And after hearing stories from my friends and reading about Gabrielle in the lawsuit filed, I have lost that trust. It’s something each student has to make a decision on and inform themselves [about] in the months to come as these allegations are being investigated.”
The speech took place during a week when the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) hosted Title IX focus group sessions on campus. 
The OCR conducted both group and individual sessions with campus members as part of a review of “the University’s policies and practices related to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972,” according to an email sent to campus members by Casalegno. Focus group sessions and individual meetings were hosted from Wednesday to Friday. Campus members were invited to various sessions based upon certain groups they affiliate themselves with, including but not limited to staff, faculty, resident assistants, athletes, and male or female undergraduate students.
Title IX is a section of the 1972 Education Amendments that prohibits sex discrimination in education. On May 1, the U.S. Department of Education released a list of 55 colleges and universities that it is currently investigating, including Carnegie Mellon, for possible mishandlings of sexual assault and related complaints. 
Other notable universities on the list include Princeton University, Pennsylvania State University, and Dartmouth College.

Many students received an email last week telling them that the people staffing the table for Oculus VR at the Technical Opportunities Conference (TOC) were impersonating recruiters.
According to the email sent by Senior Director of Strategic Programs and Special Projects in the College of Engineering Kelly McQuoid, “We have reason to believe that the individuals at the Oculus VR table during the TOC were impersonating recruiters. According to recruiters at neighboring tables, these individuals left with a stack of résumés. We do not know if they will attempt to contact you.”
The TOC is sponsored by the College of Engineering and is organized by Carnegie Mellon’s student chapter of the Society of Women Engineers. 
This year, over 300 companies attended the TOC, making the normally two-day event three days long. The TOC ran Mon., Sept. 17–Wed. Sept. 19. Oculus VR was scheduled to attend the career fair on Wednesday.
Although Oculus VR did register to attend the TOC, McQuoid said in a separate email to The Tartan, the company later said it was unable to participate. “At some point,” McQuoid wrote in her email, “a few people stepped into the empty booth and started posing as recruiters.”
Recruiters at neighboring booths told McQuoid that the “recruiters” did not bring any signage other than what Carnegie Mellon provided and did not stay in the booth for very long. The impostors collected résumés from students and left with the résumés.
“It was reported to us that résumés were removed from the booth,” McQuoid told The Tartan. “Once this came to our attention, we began the process of notifying students, as well as identifying the individuals who perpetrated the prank.”
According to McQuoid, “The résumés have since been returned to me, and I will pass them along to Oculus VR,” and if students are “contacted by the company going forward, those contacts should be viewed as legitimate.”
Oculus VR is known for producing Oculus Rift, a virtual reality head-mounted display. The company was founded in 2012 and was acquired by Facebook in March 2014. Oculus VR, according to its website, is still looking for interns for the upcoming summer. 
Oculus VR was founded by Palmer Luckey, a “self-described virtual reality enthusiast and hardware geek,” according to the company’s website. The company created the first version of Oculus Rift with the help of a Kickstarter campaign that raised over $2.4 million from numerous backers.
“The TOC is designed to positively showcase the multitude of mature, talented, and capable students on a professional level,” McQuoid wrote in her email to The Tartan. “We will evaluate our process and on-site security at the next TOC event to ensure that, even in a crowded venue, we have oversight to address issues of this nature.”
The university is working to identify the impersonators.

On Sept. 21, Carnegie Mellon reported that the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority repaired a 20-inch water main break on Forbes Avenue.
Those signed up for Carnegie Mellon’s alert system received text message and call alerts shortly after 10 a.m. on the morning of the repair. 
The text alerts read, “Main water line failure to Pittsburgh Campus[:] A main water line has failed causing disruption to most of [main] campus.”
An email sent out on Sept. 20 to campus members said that disruption to water service could occur between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Sept. 21.
The email specified that 16 campus facilities were expected to be affected: Woodlawn Apartments, Margaret Morrison Apartments, Skibo Gym, Doherty Apartments, the Greek Quadrangle, and Roselawn, Stever, Mudge, Spirit, Hamerschlag, McGill, Boss, Henderson, Welch, Scobell, and Donner Houses. The university later listed more than 20 affected buildings on its alert website.
The email encouraged students to “reserve some drinking water before the service interruption” and said that restrooms were not to be used in the affected buildings, but could be used in other buildings not affected by the water main break.
Campus alerts were sent shortly after 12 p.m. on Sept. 21 informing campus members that the water main was repaired and all campus facilities were being serviced normally.
Carnegie Mellon’s Student Information Online (SIO) states that it uses students’ inputted mobile phone numbers  to enroll them into the university’s emergency alert notification system so that they receive text and voice notifications from the university. 
Updates to inputted SIO phone numbers are also updated automatically with the emergency alert notification system.

Ex officio report: Thanassis Rikakis
Vice Provost for Design, Arts, and Technology and head of the Integrative Design, Arts and Technology (IDeATe) program Thanassis Rikakis spoke regarding the new program, noting the benefits of collaborative learning and how IDeATe can prepare students for entering new, creative industries. Rikakis said that there are now 35 studio-based courses on topics like game design and new markets for music. 
IDeATe already has over 200 students participating and hopes to reach 500. Regarding the IDeATe facilities in Hunt, students have to take minis that teach students how to use the equipment in these areas before gaining access, and Rikakis reported that he will look into whether students can use their printing quota for 3-D printing.
Discussion on funding Greek organizations
Following the tabling of an allocation request to grant $750 to the fraternity Sigma Phi Epsilon for their Labor Day barbecue, a discussion was held on whether funding should be provided to Greek organizations. 
The Joint Funding Committee (JFC), which allocates the pool of money generated by students’ activity fees, currently only provides funding to recognized student organizations and not to fraternities or sororities because Greek organizations discriminate based on gender. However, there is no policy stating that Student Senate cannot fund unrecognized organizations, so a straw poll was held in which the majority of voting members were in favor of providing special allocations for unrecognized organizations but with certain restrictions.

If you’ve spent five minutes on social media in the last week, there is no doubt that you have heard about Emma Watson’s HeForShe UN speech. The former Harry Potter star and current UN Women Goodwill Ambassador is launching what has been called a groundbreaking feminist initiative. In Watson’s words, feminism has been for too long “synonymous with man-hating” when, she says to men, “gender equality is your issue too.” Watson would like the HeForShe campaign to extend to all men a “formal invitation” to join forces with women in fighting for equality. Watson’s speech has resonated powerfully with millions — and for good reason — but how groundbreaking was it, really?
Watson has undeniably made a positive contribution to mainstream feminism. In a society where feminism might as well be the new “f-word,” every outspoken and proud feminist celebrity is valuable to the cause. A woman like Watson, massively famous and widely adored, carries such an astronomical level of clout that feminists everywhere should be thrilled to call her one of our own. 
Also, the HeForShe campaign is spot-on in challenging the misconception that feminism is purely a women’s issue. Gender equality is everyone’s issue, and Watson does a good job of recognizing and legitimizing men’s issues without downplaying those of women. The battle for gender equality is compromised when the sides are pitted against each other, she observes, so the solution must be to stop useless fighting between the sides and instead turn toward a common enemy — namely, gender-based stereotypes and policing. With her influence and her inclusivity, Watson may be able to rally many new feminists to the battlefront.
As encouraging as that is, Watson’s brand of feminism must be taken with a grain of salt. Wealthy, well-educated, cisgendered, presumably heterosexual, and white, Watson is the epitome of privilege. Her arguments are exactly the sort which have dominated feminism in the public eye since its origins; her message, while valid and well-spoken, is nothing new. Instead of traversing the same old ground, Watson would do better to use her influence to raise awareness of intersectionality in feminism and to allow the voices of queer women, trans women, and women of color to be heard.
HeForShe tries to gently coax people toward feminist thinking, but — at least at this point — it seems to lack any sort of concrete plan for action. It’s all well and good to get a hashtag trending. It’s exponentially more valuable to actually take steps toward dismantling the oppressive power structures super-glued into society. The patriarchy does hurt men. Watson is all too correct on this point, though she neglects to mention darker issues, such as the belittling of male assault victims, circumcision at birth, and favoring of the mother in child custody cases.
Nevertheless, the patriarchy is also designed to keep men in power, and has consequently — historically and presently, across the world — resulted in the violent oppression of women far and above men. Gender equality is everyone’s issue. But picture a feminist who has read sexual assault and domestic abuse statistics, heard about the epidemic of genital mutilation and honor killings, seen politicians restrict body autonomy, and after all that needs Watson’s assurance that “this will benefit men too” to buy into the cause. I hesitate to trust an ally who is indifferent to injustice until it becomes personally relevant.
It’s worth noting that despite Watson’s concentrated and admirable efforts to make feminism appeal to men, she still received a barrage of anonymous 4chan messages that threatened — emptily, it was later revealed — to leak nude photographs of her. When even thoroughly inclusive feminism draws such threats, it becomes clear that misogyny has little to do with “feminazis” and everything to do with a deeply-ingrained hatred of women.
Emma Watson is a real asset to the feminist movement. Hopefully, HeForShe will continue to inspire new feminists and encourage old ones while also integrating more practical efforts for change. Watson’s brand of feminism is neither perfect nor groundbreaking, but in the end, I’m sure even Hermione Granger would admire her as an amazing young woman.

The Middle East is a desperately complex system of competing states and ethnic groups, and it doesn’t take much to send it into chaos. In the past week, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has caused a fresh surge of panic and confusion in the region, as its militants attacked — and continue to attack — Syrian villages along the northern-central border with tanks and heavy artillery, according to The New York Times. These attacks have sent new waves of Syrian refugees into surrounding countries.
Of course, Syrian refugees flooding into surrounding nations is hardly surprising, given that more than 3 million refugees have fled their nation since 2012, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The vast majority of them have gone to nearby nations, including Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan. Others have gone to the European Union, particularly to Sweden and Norway. While regarding Syrian refugees as a regional problem would be easier for the United States, Syrian refugees are a global issue. The influx of massive numbers of refugees stresses an unstable, volatile regional system economically and socially.
First off, there’s a basic, uncomfortable dilemma: people are expensive. Since the Syrian war began, 500,000 refugees have sought asylum in Jordan, costing the Jordanian government over $800 million, according to Al-Jazeera, while Turkey has spent over $2 billion hosting refugees, according to IRIN News. Syrian refugees have cost the Lebanese economy around $7.5 billion, according to Reuters . 
To make matters worse, supporting refugees in Norway comes to $125,000 per person, per year, according to The New York Times. It’s much cheaper to support refugees in the Middle East than in Europe, but it’s not as if the Norwegian government can simply package up its tax dollars and send them to Jordan’s relief efforts.
Sending money directly to the source of the problem would be the ideal solution, but a glaring problem remains: the Middle East is notoriously unstable, and unstable systems often lack methods to ensure that humanitarian aid funds help the people they’re meant for. In fact, much of ISIS’s funding gets routed through front companies and regional charities, according to The New York Times. Sending money is a good solution in theory, but not a practical one.
To make matters worse, the flood of refugees presents a social problem in addition to the economic ones. Syrian refugees themselves present a mix of ethnic groups, some of which are ethnically Syrian, while some are Kurds. The Syrians fleeing to Turkey in recent weeks are primarily Kurdish. Sometimes refugees can assimilate well into the nation that hosts them, but sometimes they can’t. A major stumbling block to effective Syrian assimilation is the sheer number of people looking for asylum. 
The number of Syrian refugees in Lebanon currently exceeds one million, more than a third of their total population. Syrian refugees in Jordan are joined by 1.8 million Palestinian and 450,000 Iraqi refugees, competing with native Jordanians in an economy with an unemployment rate of 12.6 percent, according to Sada. In short, the influx of Syrian refugees presents a major stress on the economies and societies of the surrounding area.
The social challenges presented by Syrian refugees have even less of a clear solution than the economic challenges, partially because they must be addressed on a case-by-case basis. A solution that might work in Lebanon might not work in Jordan. Even if the United States had an effective way to funnel funds into the region — which it doesn’t really — the problem of dealing with such large populations in desperate need of aid would remain. 
The Syrian refugee crisis is indeed a global crisis, but one that lacks a clear solution.

Externalities are the extra costs and benefits to a party that did not foresee them. Externalities may represent something very simple, but, on the grand scale of politics and international relations, they present a unique and systematic way of looking at the UN’s recent talks regarding climate change. This year, some of the world’s largest polluters, namely the United States and China, have made key changes in environmental politics.
Domestically, President Barack Obama has been widely documented for flexing his executive power, leading by example, and treading his own path. Although this behavior has been met with controversy, it seems as if he is willing to take the global community further into climate conversation. China, with new president Xi Jinping, has finally taken steps to clean up its own backyard, at a time when Beijing’s smog levels are reaching hazardous and unbearable levels. This year, Xi Jinping and his cabinet formally “declared war on pollution,” according to Reuters. This declaration comes after years of China calling itself a “developing economy,” which demanded a slackened restriction on emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants.
In the game of politics, it seems like most nations see proactive climate change policy as a competitive disadvantage, bringing with it extra taxes, less production, and more risky investments in research and development. One way externalities can be cut from the economy is to realign interests. The world needs this realignment regarding environmental economics. 
According to Columbia University Professor Scott Barnett, governments “keep coming up with ideas like pledges, which imply that you can, by some kind of central planning, ordain a collective outcome, and the world doesn’t work that way.” He also stated that the UN has “not found the means to change the incentives to get the countries to actually adopt limits, essentially on emissions.”
One way to realign environmental and political interests would be to create an independent body to fund research and development while monitoring the situation on a global scale. The result would be a coalition fund, made up of governments, businesses, financial and development banks that are ready, according to the UN, to “mobilize up to $200 billion” toward environmental interests. The UN, in creating this coalition fund, has built a new body that has interests different than those of an independent state or business.
Obama has also called upon himself, his cabinet, and the United States to lead the world in fighting climate change. Additionally, in his speech at the UN, he called on China to take on a greater role in the fight. China has already begun to fight pollution on a domestic level, providing itself with a platform to join the United States in leading the effort to slow climate change. 
Both nations have wasted valuable time in squabbling over the “responsibility” of global climate change, but only now have they both adopted a direction in policy. Moreover, although some countries have already adopted significant policies, like Switzerland and Singapore, the United States and China must start taking decisive action if there is to be any significant action on a global scale, both because of the scale of their emissions and because they should serve as policy-examples for developing economies.
However, both the United States and China face significant hurdles in getting the effort started. Despite climate change rallies drawing around 400,000 supporters to New York, where the UN Climate Summit was being held last week, climate change remains an issue that does not particularly concern the majority of voters. CNN states that only 24 percent of Americans “list climate change as a national problem that they worry about ‘a great deal.’” Moreover, China’s large, sprawling, and corrupt system of Communist Party officials suggests that any comprehensive, across-the-board climate change policy would be met with ineffectiveness and inaction.
Ultimately, both countries are taking steps to change the game of environmental politics, but both also face further challenges in leading the charge against climate change.

Last week the registrar announced the new schedule for all final exams which starts this semester. Previous finals weeks were organized so that exams were given the Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday of finals week. Exams were also given the following Monday, with make-up examinations on the following Tuesday.
While exams will still be given the Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday of finals week, Saturday has been made into a reading day with the last examination period being moved to Sunday and make-up exams given the following Monday. This change is beneficial for students wishing to get that extra day out of their vacation. This is particularly true for students with few exams, but who must wait until the second week of final exams for the administration of their tests.
However, there is a major drawback to this shift, which has the potential to affect a large portion of the student body. 
Students with a large number of final exams may feel the added pressure of exams squeezed tighter into a shorter exam period. These students will have fewer days between the first and second round of examinations to review a semester’s worth of material for classes on any given exam day. 
Though, ideally, studying for exams in the second phase of finals week should begin long before the weekend prior to the exam, this is not always feasible for students at Carnegie Mellon. 
Having the weekend before this second period can be a critical preparation time for students swamped with exams. This is particularly true when one considers that many of the students with the largest number of final exams, due to general education requirements, are first-years and sophomores who are still developing their time management skills.
The email from the registrar cited that the changes were made so that make-up exams could be more easily scheduled. While some people will certainly benefit from being able to leave a day earlier or having an easier time scheduling make-up exams, the change seems a small reward from creating a stressful situation for other students.   
As final exams near, The Tartan hopes the university will continue to monitor student feedback regarding the final exam schedule change. Dependent upon feedback, the university may wish to revisit the schedule for the 2016-17 academic year, for which the university has only released a tentative calendar, rather than a proposed (2015-16) or official (2014-15) calendar.

Pittsburgh officials have added even more fuel to the fire under the Uber and Lyft debate. On Thursday, two Public Utility Commission (PUC) administrative law judges recommended against granting ride-sharing company Uber permanent license to operate in parts of Pennsylvania.
The outcome stands to affect students attending Pittsburgh schools, many of whom don’t own cars and rely almost exclusively on public transit to navigate the city. Uber and Lyft are popular services among students, as students view them to be more accessible and reliable than the city’s sporadic, often fickle taxi services.
The PUC judges cited Uber’s lack of transparency and apparent concern for its patrons as the primary reason behind the decision. While Uber and its competitor Lyft could stand to be far more transparent in their data reporting — and would probably benefit from this approach — Pittsburgh cab companies need to consider adopting and lobbying to legalize similar ride-share practices before shutting out Uber and Lyft completely. Uber and Lyft present a threat to the highly regulated taxi industry because their services are notoriously more accessible and reliable, largely due to their use of smart phone apps to match drivers with passengers and to facilitate payment. Furthermore, the available data indicates that Uber and Lyft are less discriminatory of patrons and better service poor areas, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
Despite the public benefit of these measures, existing regulations cause many ride-share practices to toe the line of legality. For one, Uber and Lyft are able to keep their fares low in part because their drivers do not need to maintain their vehicles or undergo training or background checks to the same extent as taxi drivers.
Reducing the rigor of training and background checks is not an easy course for cab companies to pursue, and for the public’s sake, maybe they shouldn’t try. But there are more legal and practical ways in which taxi services can and should change their practices: improving accessibility of their services and eliminating discriminatory passenger screenings.
Public outcry over the Uber and Lyft cease-and-desist measures have shown that the market isn’t going back: Cab companies and the government that regulates them cannot simply reverse the trend with legal roadblocks. Instead, taxi services need to recognize the new direction of transportation services and work within legal means to adjust their practices, while pushing the law to adapt. Rather than complaining that ride-share companies are deregulating the industry, taxi services need to fight the more constricting and antiquated regulations that prevent them from competing.
This is not to say that ride-share companies are not without fault or exempt from the push for change. It is widely acknowledged that Uber and Lyft have engaged in less-than-transparent dealings. In order to demonstrate the concern for patrons that the PUC demands, ride-share companies need to share their data; It’s just honest, good practice. Plus, the benefits of open data would likely outweigh the deterrents. It would offer publicly accessible proof of ride-sharing as a superior and more just model of transportation service.
Both parties have work to do. Cab companies need to lobby for change, and ride-share companies need to be transparent about their practices. And in the public’s interest, the government needs to adapt regulations to changing times and institute mandates to demand data from ride-share companies to promote transparency and fair competition.

“Don’t leave me here.” These are the words of a dying 91-year-old man named Joseph Andrey, featured in a recent article in The New York Times, who was forced by the American healthcare system to remain in a nursing home, despite the fact that he wished to return home and spend his final days with his books and music.
Andrey and numerous others are forced into nursing homes for their “best interest” in order to remain eligible for Medicare coverage. Andrey could be provided with supervision and home visits from a private hospice company if a doctor verified that he only had six months to live, but, under the current system, he would lose all Medicaid home care.
Are these regulations really in the “best interests” of dying patients? According to The New York Times, the nursing home collected $682.48 a day from Andrey, around five times the cost of private home care. His daughter obtained records that showed the last year of his healthcare cost a hefty sum of over a million dollars.
This is just one million of the $583 billion spent last year on Medicare, a total that comprises 14 percent of the federal budget. Between 1969 and 2012, Medicare spending per person grew at an average of 7.7 percent annually according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. 
The costs of healthcare are skyrocketing in America, and there is no reason why we should be holding 91-year-old patients as prisoners in the system, using American tax dollars to pay their hospital bills and massively profiting the healthcare system.
If it was against Andrey’s will to keep him in a nursing home, why must he be kept against his will using the dollars of taxpayers?
Andrey receives no benefit whatsoever from dying in a hospital bed. His last days would have been spent happier and at one-sixth of the cost to Americans in his own home. In Andrey’s eyes, “living” was spending his final days at home enjoying his favorite books and music. Even if he was physically living, that does not mean that he was living happily while imprisoned in his own body in a nursing home.
People have the right to choose where to die; no one should take this from them. Now more than ever, the United States has forced the elderly to live and die in pain, attached to machines against their will. This is not the result of a system in their best interest. It is the result of a system that, through the lobbying of nursing homes and hospitals, has chosen to favor profit over patient.
