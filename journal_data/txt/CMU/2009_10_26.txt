The Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team continued their remarkable run last week as they defeated conference rivals Brandeis University and New York University. The team currently sits at number 9 in the NSCAA/Adidas Division III Rankings with their 13–1 record and are 4–0 in University Athletic Association (UAA) conference play.
The Tartans came out flying right from the kickoff against Brandeis, testing Judges goalkeeper Matt Lynch with five shots before finally scoring in the ninth minute. Senior forward Pat Lutz received a pass from fellow senior Ryan Browne, dribbled by the last defender and scored off a shot to the near post. Carnegie Mellon continued to press after the goal but gradually the pressure died down and the rest of the game was played mostly in the midfield. Brandeis’ most dangerous players, Alexander Farr and Jaime Batista, were shut down by the rock-solid Carnegie Mellon backline. Senior goalie Maks Khurgin was hardly tested and only had to make one save the entire match. Despite the dying pressure, Lutz continued to give Brandeis problems as he was constantly running at the Judges’ defense, stealing balls and creating chances. His efforts earned him a third UAA Athlete of the Week award and a second Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) Player of the Week honor. The match ended 1–0 as the Tartans picked up their sixth consecutive shutout.
Two days later, Carnegie Mellon faced New York University. It was all about the seniors that day, as seniors Keith Haselhoff, Ricky Griffin, and Lutz all got on the score sheet in the Tartans’ last home fixture of the year. The game had an exciting beginning as Haselhoff scored in the fourth minute off a deflected shot and New York answered back seven minutes later. 
The Tartans were a little shocked with the quick response, as it was only the fourth goal they’d allowed since Sept. 15. Nevertheless, Carnegie Mellon’s level of play was not disturbed and the Tartans were rewarded with a second goal. 
The calm and cool Griffin broke through the New York backline and neatly scored off a chip shot over the goalkeeper. In the 27th minute, Lutz got his third goal of the weekend as he blasted the ball into the back of the net from six yards out. The Cardinal and Gray wrapped up the game in the second half, as the dynamic duo of Griffin and Lutz once again combined. Griffin was able to finish off a low shot to the far post to get his team-leading 17th goal of the season and secure the 4–1 win.
The men’s soccer team will unfortunately be losing 10 seniors next year, eight of whom are starters. However, the Tartans have enough talent on the team to be able to make up for the loss.
One aspiring candidate, first-year Kevin Pierce, explained how valuable it is for the younger players to practice against guys like Griffin and Lutz: 
“You learn so much from the seniors. They’re all very talented and just inspire you to work harder every day. Not only do they teach you how to be successful on the field, they teach you how to be successful at Carnegie Mellon University overall.”
The Tartans are now 13–1 for the season and are currently fighting for a very high seed in the NCAA tournament in order to get home field advantage. The Tartans’ next match is away at Case Western University this Friday.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s tennis teams had strong representation at the ITA National Small College Championships held in Mobile, Ala., with two teams taking fourth in doubles play: seniors James Muliawan and Niko Ljuboja, as well as sophomore Laura Chen and junior Ashley Herrick. Chen also made the singles draw for the tournament and placed fourth overall. This tournament concludes the season for both teams.
The ITA nationals mark the second appearance for Muliawan and Ljuboja, who made the tournament in their first year. This time, the duo won their first match against a Luther College team with a little trouble, but triumphed in the end 6–4, 6–4. Despite a strong win, the two were unable to repeat the previous day’s results and fell in the semifinals to Andrew Thomson and Andrew Lee of Middlebury College, 6–1, 6–3. For the playoff match, Muliawan and Ljuboja faced a duo from Ithaca College. After losing the first set 4–6 and winning the second 6–4, the Tartans fell in the tiebreak to take fourth place.
“I guess our result is okay; I wish we could have done better, but it’s been fun,” Muliawan said of his fourth place finish. “I made singles last year and doubles in my freshman year, so three out of four years isn’t bad.”
“I had a fun time playing with James, and I’m glad we were able to make nationals our senior year,” Ljuboja stated. “This trip was a lot of fun, and I’m glad I was able to spend some quality time with other people on the team. It’s nice to start my senior year the same way I started [my freshman year]: making nationals.”
For the women’s side, Chen and Herrick beat Emory’s Lorne McManigle and Zahra Dawson 1–6, 7–6 (7–4), 1–0 to advance to the semifinals. The Tartans next faced Jackie Shtemberg and Felice Trinh of the College of New Jersey, but fell 6–3, 1–6, 1–0 (9–7) after a long and grueling battle. Determined to do better in the next match, the Tartans overpowered the first doubles team from Redlands University, 6–4, 6–2 to take third.
“I think that there were a lot of good people in the tournament, so I guess losing to good competition isn’t as bad,” Chen remarked. “It’s always very disappointing to lose, but I like to think that since the matches were close that they could have gone either way. Losing to tough competition just makes me want to work harder.”
“I had a great experience going to Alabama for the first time,” Herrick added. “Laura and I had to perform at our best in order to be competitive in every match, but it was really fun having the opportunity to compete against some of the best teams in the nation.”
Chen also competed in singles play, with this being her second year making ITA nationals after placing second last year. The first round proved to be a warm up for Chen, who only dropped three games against her Trinity College opponent 6–2, 6–1. In the semifinals, Chen faced the University of Chicago’s first-seeded Kendra Higgins. After dropping the first set 4–6, Chen rallied back to win the second set by a margin of a couple points, 7–6 (6). Unfortunately Higgins regrouped in the final set to win 4–6.
The tennis teams will resume play in the fall. With such strong representation in this tournament, both the men’s and women’s teams are expected to be an intimidating force to other opponents.

On Oct. 18, the Tartans women’s soccer team ended a long week of soccer by battling New York University into second overtime for an eventual 1–0 victory as part of the University Athletic Association tournament. 
The win, the Tartans’ first of the tournament, marked the team’s second overtime victory of the overall season and came on the heels of a 1–1 overtime tie with Brandeis University on Oct. 16 and a 0–1 loss at Washington University on Oct. 11. The Tartans’ record is now 6–5–2 overall and 1–1–2 in UAA play.
Carnegie Mellon’s loss to the Bears was only their third shutout loss of the year, and their offense could muster little more than two shots on goal by junior Emily Overstreet. Hosting Brandeis, sophomore Elsa Wu scored the team’s only goal to secure the tie. She now leads the team with six.
Junior goalkeeper Anya Royen was solid against New York, making seven saves throughout the game. First-year Lissie Arndt had two shots saved, while Overstreet and senior Casey Garth each had one. 
Wu also put pressure on the Violets with two shots of her own, the first off the crossbar of the goal in the 69th minute and the second wide at the start of the first overtime.
Overstreet and first-year Katie Davis combined to give the Tartans the winning goal shortly into the second overtime. Overstreet pulled off a corner kick to Davis, who headed it in for the winner and her third goal of the season.
Davis was ecstatic about the Tartans’ first UAA win and scoring the winning goal: “I’m really excited about the goal, but it really was a team effort to get us there. We played over 100 tough minutes and everyone contributed.”
“We have an amazing team with lots of talent and I am so proud Katie scored,”  Overstreet said. “It was an awesome ending to an overall great game and I can’t wait until the next one.”
The Tartans will be on the road next week to play Case Western Reserve University on Friday at 7:30 p.m. in the UAA tournament.

The Carnegie Mellon University volleyball team played at New York University Oct. 17 and 18 for their second set of University Athletic Association competition. The Tartans triumphed over Brandeis University and the University of Rochester but dropped close decisions to Case Western Reserve University and number 4 Washington University. The Tartans moved their record to 13–10 for the season and 3–4 for UAA play.
The Tartans defeated Brandeis 3–0 in the first game of the weekend. Junior Aislinn McCloskey had a stunning 16 kills in the game, while junior Cameron Griffin had 16 digs. Senior Jess Brackin also contributed to the team at the net with four block assists and one block solo.
In Saturday’s second match, the Tartans fell 2–3 to Case Western after a long back-and-forth battle. The final game led to the Spartans’ win with a 15–12 score. Senior setter Sam Carter collected eight kills and 46 assists during the game while fellow seniors Julie Ng, Megan Killeen, and Cara Fatigati had 15, 12, and 11 digs respectively.
The Tartans started Sunday’s round robin game against Rochester, ending the morning by winning 3–1. Junior Caroline Size led the Tartans’ offense with 10 kills.
Despite the easy win during the morning, the Tartans could not achieve the same results against Washington and dropped a 3–2 decision. The Tartans were very successful, though, being the only UAA team to even score against the Bears. McCloskey again led the offense with 14 kills, and Griffin had 28 digs. Also contributing a spectacular performance was sophomore Emily Baddock with 17 digs.
On Oct. 23, the Tartans faced number 2 Juniata College away. The Tartans put up an amazing fight against the team, but lost 3–0. The team totaled 39 digs against Juniata and earned six blocks in the game, losing in a close three-setter. The Tartans led the second set, but the Eagles were able to tie it up 12–12 and 24–24, pulling it out in the end 26–24. 
Rosnick said, “The second and third games were really close. We played well but just couldn’t take the game.”
“They were quick and good — their offense was hard to stop,” added Baddock.
The Tartans will play York College and Geneva College this Saturday at the Juniata Tournament. They will play York College with serving set to start at 1 p.m.

Winning the Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA) Regional tournament earlier this month, seniors Niko Ljuboja and James Muliawan continued their competition and placed fourth at the ITA National Small College Championships last weekend. 
This is not the first time this duo has performed at the playoff level, as they were the regional champions their first year and competed at the NCAA Division III Championships the past two years. 
For these two All-American tennis players, the rest of the year could bring even more wins on the court.
For Ljuboja, a native of Highland Park, Ill., Carnegie Mellon was the best of both worlds with a strong electrical and computer engineering program and the chance to play tennis at the collegiate level. Although he upholds that academics and athletics are difficult to mix, his tennis accomplishments and his plans to stay one more year to earn his master’s degree in the university’s IMB program show his ability to manage both.
Ljuboja had also played soccer for most of his childhood and was inspired by Pete Sampras to improve his all-court tennis game. Thankfully for the Tartans, he kept his focus on tennis and continues to have success.
Originally from Wycoff, N.J., Muliawan didn’t place as much emphasis on playing tennis in college as he did on finding a strong mechanical engineering program for his academic pursuits. Admittedly for Muliawan, he has found that the combination of school and sports at the university level is hard at times but actually allows for more time management overall. During what free time he can get, Muliawan enjoys hanging out with friends and taking weekend trips to nearby schools to visit friends from home. 
With a strong showing in the fall, Ljuboja and Muliawan can be proud of how their final year is going so far.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s golf team concluded their fall season with a third place finish at the Bobcat Invitational at the Greensburg Country Club on Monday, Oct. 11. The Tartans finished the 18-hole invitational, hosted by Pitt-Greensburg, with a total score of 335.
The Tartans finished just one stroke behind both the first and second place finishers, La Roche College and Penn State Behrend respectively. 
Both schools ended the day with a team score of 334, but La Roche came out on top by way of a tie-breaker. Penn State Altoona and Pitt-Greensburg finished fourth and fifth respectively, both with team scores of 342. Mt. Aloysius rounded out the field with a 388.
Joe Nelson of Penn State Behrend was the individual leader and finished three over par with a 73. Second and third place belonged to Tartan sophomores Michael Cheng and Terrance Einhorn who had rounds of 78 and 82 respectively.
Junior Brent Driscoll finished tied for ninth just two strokes behind Einhorn at 84. Senior Brett Cannaday finished the day in 24th with a 91, and sophomore Alex Cohen shot a 103.
The Tartans had two individuals who competed in the Invitational: Senior Nick Burkholder carded an 84 to tie for ninth individually and first-year Steven Nguyen shot a 104.
The Bobcat Invitational marked the end of the fall season for the Tartans. While the Tartans were a very competitive team this season, they were not completely satisfied with their performance. “The team and I came into the fall season with high expectations and did not play to our full potential,” said Cheng. “It was an extremely disappointing season after coming off the best season last year. While we graduated two starters last year, this team still has a lot of great players and talent. I believe we have the potential to turn things around for the spring season.”
Last year, the Tartans took home the their first ever University Athletic Association Championship title and survived four rounds at the NCAA Championships. With some training and determination, they will hope to net the same results come spring.
The Tartans will return to the links during their spring break trip on March 4 in Naples, Fla.

As the seasons change, so do your options for physical activity and training; gyms and treadmills start to fill up and workout times and space become a premium. 
In order to make the most out of late fall, winter, or early spring training, flexibility within your routine is a surefire way to ensure consistency.
I have to admit I am stubborn and religiously stuck in my exercise routine, and anything making me deviate from my normal daily physical activity plan is an annoyance. To combat this, it would be ideal to develop multiple workout options. 
The ability to develop a weekly plan shows forethought and commitment to increasing health and fitness over the winter months. The following will outline some general training options that can be performed in the University Center’s fitness facilities.
Treadmill
As the weather starts to turn, most people tend to gravitate toward the treadmills. Treadmill training produces nearly the same energy expenditure as running at a particular intensity, which is why most competitive runners train with them.
A challenging alternative to regular treadmill training, fartlek training has been practiced for years by cross country and track and field athletes to break up the monotony. The concept behind fartlek training is to vary the intensity and distance at random and various times throughout a predetermined training distance or time (e.g. 3 miles or 60 minutes).
If you were performing this on the city streets of lovely Pittsburgh, you might start out by jogging down Forbes Avenue toward Squirrel Hill. Once you got to Murray Avenue, you might take a right and increase intensity for a block or two until you reach your next milestone and once again either decrease or increase intensity. Look for street signs or certain markers to help you pace yourself.
Indoors, this becomes tricky. Start out with a time or distance of your choice based on your previous training experiences, such as 30 minutes. Begin with an easy pace to elevate the heart rate and the core body temperature. Concentrate on your surroundings to take the place of outdoor markers: Watch the people around you or television.
After about 5–10 minutes of easy jogging, start your fartlek training based on your normal habits. Pick a piece of equipment near you that you can easily watch out of the corner of your eye, and each time a new person uses the equipment, vary your speed or the inclination of your treadmill through the full workout. For the TV, try varying the speed or inclination every commercial break or scene change. Keep it fun, and don’t get caught at a speed or inclination that you cannot handle and injure yourself.
Elliptical
This is a great option for people who experience lower back or knee pain during running. The elliptical is second to using the treadmill for energy expenditure. With the elliptical, you can also perform modified fartlek training using the same protocol as the treadmill. Also, a way to spice up this option would be to vary the direction of the movement.
Most people use an elliptical like they would use a treadmill — by putting one foot in front of the other. 
This movement pattern is identical to the movement patterns seen during walking or running, hip flexion followed by knee flexion, and will recruit the respective muscle groups (illioposas and quadriceps).
Try changing up the movement patterns and start the motion with hip and knee extension. This will primarily engage the posterior muscle groups, which tend to be hard-to-hit areas. The muscle groups involved in hip and knee extension are the hamstrings and the gluteal muscles (gluteus maximus, medius, and minimus).
During a typical 30–45 minute cardio session, try changing up the direction every 10 to 15 minutes to work both muscle groups and to keep you interested.
The next edition of “Fiber Content” will expose you to other cardiovascular options to keep you engaged and undeterred because of overcrowded facilities. Exercise options to be discussed include stationary/spinning bikes, indoor rowers, stair climbers, and swimming. Do not forget to integrate static and PNF stretching into your daily physical activity plan.
As with all exercise, before you start, consult your physician to gain medical clearance. 
Please email me if you have any questions.
Kevin Schultz (schultzk@andrew.cmu.edu)is the director of strength and conditioning.

This year, Andre Platzer beat out hundreds of researchers to earn a spot in Popular Science’s Brilliant 10. This competition, now in its fifth year, awards 10 people who push the limits and show remarkable insight in their field of study. Platzer, an assistant professor in the Computer Science Department, is not yet a household name, and his contributions to the world might have gone unnoticed until now. But without him, car accidents, train collisions, or even mid-air plane crashes would be far more frequent.
When he was younger, Platzer was a successful ballroom dance competitor. Then the world of mathematics and computers cut in, and it has taken him to the current limits of systems analysis.
His current work involves cyber-physical systems (CPS), which are systems that include both computerized and physical aspects. Cars, for example, are cyber-physical systems: They move along the road in physical space, and also include digital computer controls. This can be seen in aircraft, trains, and robots. “It turns out that a lot of systems are natural CPSs, because they move,” Platzer explained. “Movement is important for understanding collisions.”
Platzer’s research involves the improvement of train and air traffic control system designs. 
He wants to find out if these systems are reliable in real-world situations, and if computers can make the right decisions to reliably avoid collisions. Platzer said, “[Trains and airplanes] are controlled by computers, and their control choices are crucial to ensure they can’t possibly collide.” Popular Science mentioned Platzer’s KeYmaera Hybrid Verification Tool as significant and necessary software of the modern age. KeYmaera was created to be more effective than any other limited model present at the time, which tested safety algorithms for certain conditions. This program can be used to check anti-collision algorithms for aircraft and trains through the input of velocity and altitude, among other variables. 
Already, Platzer has found a flaw in a proposed aircraft collision-avoidance algorithm: Given the right circumstances, the planes, instead of circling and avoiding each other, will be put directly on a crash course. Often, computer systems are built that surpass our understanding of them. We cannot truly know whether a system can handle every scenario it comes across. 
As Platzer said, “The primary limitations today are in understanding the systems that are being built.” As advanced as anti-collision systems are today, it is nearly impossible to account for all the variables in a real-world scenario. “The really tricky part is how to figure out if the interaction of physics with control always works correctly, which can be surprisingly subtle,” Platzer said.
He also noted some of the shortcomings of previous testing methods: “Unfortunately, these analysis approaches were mostly limited to linear dynamics, but the real world is highly nonlinear. Likewise, the number of variables were restricted to around four.” It is because of this that Platzer is working to broaden anti-collision analysis to become more dimensional and nonlinear, and more like the real world. Platzer sees plenty of room for progress in his work. His ideas will not be restricted to collision avoidance in aircraft and trains, but to anyone hoping to build and design a complex system. Computers control much of our world nowadays, and it is imperative that they do not malfunction when problems arise. 
“So far, the particular application scenarios that I looked at already were mostly from the transportation domain, including air traffic and railway control. Because of the ubiquitous nature of cyber-physical systems, applications are truly all over the place, say in power grids, robotics, medical devices, power plants, and pacemakers.” There might be no better word than ‘brilliant’ for research that impacts so many fields of study.

Anyone walking around Carnegie Mellon’s campus can attest to the sheer amount of computer workspace available, which, while very helpful to a student in need of a printout in five minutes, causes the school’s energy input to be staggeringly high. However, Carnegie Mellon’s computer science department, in conjunction with Intel Labs Pittsburgh, has developed a new system called Fast Array of Wimpy Nodes, or FAWN, in order to increase energy efficiency in computer clusters. In this system, each node acts as a small, individual computer, each with its own network interface, and since the nodes consume much less power, they are called “wimpy nodes.”
The plan was developed by a research team headed by David Andersen, assistant professor of computer science, and Michael Kaminsky, a senior research scientist at Intel. The team began this research over a year ago, and as time went on, they began to build an infrastructure of the nodes, eventually arriving at a point at which the nodes were capable of processing 10 to 100 times more queries as traditional disk-based clusters at the same energy cost. A query involves a key-value storage system in which a user looks up the key and gets values in return. Kaminsky, who is involved in distributed systems and networking operating systems, compares a query to the search features on Facebook and Twitter.
Research involved in the computer cluster field indicates how far the technology has come in the last 20 years. At one time, computer clusters were reserved for only those people with supercomputers. Since the technology has advanced to a more local level and more and more people are forming clusters, the energy usage has become a much larger issue for everyone.
“In two years, data centers as a whole are going to comprise three percent of all energy usage in the United States,” said Vijay Vasudevan, a computer science Ph.D. candidate on the research team. “FAWN is a very timely work, in the sense of its tackling a problem that’s become a very big issue in the past few years.” Each node uses about three watts of energy, a huge reduction from the 100 watts of energy many computers use. The nodes are aligned in a 21-node series, matching them to a storage device known as a flash card, which has about four gigabytes of memory. In addition to the nodes and flash card, each FAWN node contains a low-power processor.
Flash memory is the same technology as that in a digital camera memory card. It is both faster than traditional magnetic disks and requires lower power. The flash memory is coupled with Intel’s Atom processor, noted for its low-power adaptations. FAWN is suitable for managing a random access workload, similar to the technology found on Facebook and Twitter. Amar Phanishayee, another Ph.D. student on the team, makes a comparison: When you log on to Facebook, the information stored on every person in the world on the website must be narrowed down to only your friends. 
In such a case, it is far easier to access the small data set that includes your friends rather than accessing the larger data set that includes everyone on Facebook. FAWN works in a similar manner, narrowing down to a few data points from a much larger set.The process has not been without its problems, however. Kaminsky says that the right network architecture (or arrangement of the nodes) must still be found and the response level of the cluster should remain high. The issue with the latter problem is consistency within the cluster, which involves keeping the nodes in synchronization with one another. 
With unsuitable consistency, the computer will not perform as quickly as it would otherwise. Another problem faced by the research team has been the relatively slow speed of the process cards. 
They are not the quickest cards available, but the team has been able to counteract the slowness by balancing them with input/output bandwidth. Looking to the future, Vasudevan and Phanishayee predict that new green industries will be particularly interested in the FAWN technology.
Companies that may show interest in the future include Microsoft, Google, and any other corporation that has a large data center. Google’s data center, for example, contains the search engine, the e-mail service Gmail, and many other applications. A low-energy plan would make the services seem more desirable over Google’s competitors.
Kaminsky, however, reminds us that FAWN has not been released commercially and that it is still in the research phase, and he also says that they are “not in contact with any groups trying to roll it out.” So until the day comes when the technology is available to the general campus, spending day and night on homework, Facebook, or Skype will not reduce your carbon footprint. But, Kaminsky notes, “The door is open.”

With the advent of the Graphical User Interface — GUI (pronounced “gooey”) for short — the mouse replaced the keyboard as the primary input device. The mouse has been the input device of choice for computers since 1981. And although they have been commercially marketed from as early as 1983, the touchscreen is only just beginning to gain more importance. Touchscreens have evolved much since their inception and can now be manufactured with very high sensitivities and accuracies.
There are various ways a touch-sensing screen can be devised. The most widely used methods to detect screen-touches include capacitive, infrared, and resistive sensing. Of these, capacitive touchscreens are now ubiquitous (pronounced “iPhone”).
Resistive touchscreens, such as that of the Nintendo DS, are made with two parallel layers of the conductive compound, indium tin oxide (ITO). ITO is printed onto a stiff, transparent bottom layer and a flexible, transparent top layer. Upon being pressed, the top layer flexes and makes contact with the lower layer, altering the resistance of the ITO layers, indicating the location of the touch. 
This system of touch-sensing only allows for a single point-of-contact detection. Infrared-sensing touchscreens don’t detect physical touch; they detect the obstruction of infrared light. There are rows of infrared light emitting diodes along two adjacent sides of the screen, with infrared sensors aligned along the opposite ends. Any touch is detected as an obstruction to the infrared light emitted from the horizontal and vertical directions, giving an exact location for the applied touch. The drawback of this method of sensing is, again, that depending on the locations of the touches, only a single touch at a time may be detected. Capacitive touchscreens, however, overcome this drawback. Capacitive touchscreens comprise two kinds: surface capacitance and projected capacitance. Of the two, the latter is more accurate, and therefore the preferred, method of touch-sensing. Projected capacitance touchscreens are, like the resistive touchscreens, composed of two layers. 
In this case, however, both layers are stiff and transparent, with the ITO layers and the insulator sandwiched between them. The ITO is arranged in orthogonal patterns on the two layers, and this creates a grid of capacitors — devices that store electrical charge. These capacitors create electric fields that are projected out of the plane of the top layer. When the user touches the screen with a finger, it alters the electric field in that area of the screen. The altered fields then cause a number of capacitances in the same vicinity of the touch to get changed. The changes in capacitances of the entire surface grid are then plotted using a computer program. The program gives an output graph showing the exact location of the touch. This is then used by the device to perform other functions (selecting an application, typing, etc.). Projected capacitive sensing allows for multiple touch-sensing as well, as a touch only alters the capacitances in its locality, leaving the rest of the screen surface in its normal, undisturbed state. 
Multiple touches are again identified using the same software to measure and map out the changes in capacitance. The resulting plot will have as many peaks as there are simultaneous touches. This is the chief reason for its being used in most touch screens built today. Many iPhone or Zune HD users will be aware of the fact that the screen is unresponsive to touches when the user’s hands are gloved. The reason for this is that the gloves prevent the user’s finger from interacting with the projected electric fields. Thin gloves may still work, while thicker gloves usually do not. This is also why a number of companies are trying to produce gloves solely for iPhone and Zune users. To counter this problem, the makers of the touchscreens can suitably set the sensitivity. A very high sensitivity will allow even shielded touches to be detected, though at the risk of detecting a number of unintended brushes against the screen.
With the rush to create appealing netbooks, there has been a frantic search for newer input devices that will help reduce the weight and size of existing laptops. The touchscreen does away with the need for a keyboard and a mouse, and today it seems well poised to take over as the ideal input device for smaller computers and hand-held devices. Sadly, tests have shown the touchscreen to be more of a nuisance to desktop users mainly because they induced fatigue in the test user’s arms. As a result, they may not be as effective an input device for desktops as they are for smaller, handheld devices.

In 1906, Dr. Alois Alzheimer noticed a strange condition in one of his patients. She suffered from memory loss, language problems, and also showed behavioral changes. These symptoms are seen far more frequently now, and the condition has been given a name — Alzheimer’s disease. Those suffering from Alzheimer’s disease (AD) face memory problems and are unable to perform the most menial tasks necessary for living a normal life. What makes this disease all the more worrisome is that it is common among the elderly; statistics from the Mayo Clinic show that nearly 50 percent of people over the age of 85 years have AD. A rare form of the disease, called early onset Alzheimer’s disease, occurs in patients under the age of 65 years. Only 5 to 10 percent of people develop this form of the disease. 
Early onset Alzheimer’s is even less common for those between 30 and 40 years of age, but cases of Alzheimer’s in patients between these ages have also been recorded. Research has shown that this form of the disease could be hereditary. 
As of now, according to the National Institute of Aging, nearly 2.4 to 2.5 million Americans are suffering from AD. These statistics, coupled with the fact that currently there is no satisfactory cure for AD, have caused scientists across the world to study the disease and to try to delve into its root causes.
AD is caused by a gradual degradation of brain cells leading to memory loss at first, and then a steady decline in all mental capacities. Dr. Alzheimer studied the brain of his patient after she died and discovered various clumps and masses of tangled fibers within the brain. The clumps have now been discovered to be amyloid plaques, while the fibers are now called neurofibrillary tangles. Amyloid plaques are composed of a protein called beta-amyloid. Normally, a protein called the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is cut by an enzyme called alpha secretase. This cutting produces fragments that can be easily degraded. However, for reasons that are still not completely understood, alpha secretase activity reduces in patients with AD. 
The task of degrading APP is then taken up by the enzymes beta secretase and gamma secretase. These enzymes cut APP in such a way that the fragments produced are hard to degrade. These fragments clump together, forming the plaques. Scientists have discovered that excessive beta-amyloid may interfere with the signaling between different neurons, ultimately causing the neurons to die. Plaques may also release free radicals, which are chemical species with unpaired electrons, that can harm the nearby cells.
Neurofibrillary tangles are the second feature of the disease. These are composed of a protein called tau. Tau is normally needed for maintaining the normal internal structure of neurons. Abnormal formation of tau leads to the production of twisted tau fibers that form the tangles. Since tau is critical for the neurons, this malfunction of tau can cause cell death. Although there have been significant advances in discovering the cause of AD, there still is no cure for the disease. Current treatments focus on reducing the symptoms of the disease and helping the patients retain the mental functions needed for daily living as long as possible. The most commonly prescribed medicines are cholinesterase inhibitors. Cholinesterase is an enzyme that degrades acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter. By inhibiting cholinesterase, the medicines seek to increase acetylcholine levels. This would enable better communication between neurons. This treatment involving cholinesterase inhibitors can help delay the onset of severe AD, but it is unable to completely cure patients. Researchers are therefore searching for factors that increase the risk of contracting the disease. 
Studies involving early onset AD revealed that two genes could be possible for the disease. Last year, researchers from the Weill Medical College of Cornell University found a gene that could be linked to the more common late onset form of the disease. This gene has been named CALHM1 and could significantly increase the risk of contracting the disease. Another study, published last week in the journal Molecular Neurodegeneration, shows that a high protein diet could significantly increase the risk of contracting AD. The study was conducted by studying the brains of mice after feeding them different types of diets for a period of 14 weeks. After 18 weeks, the brains of the mice were studied and it was found that the mice on the high protein diet had brains that were 5 percent lighter than those on other diets. The researchers thus concluded that these mice were more susceptible to Alzheimer’s disease.

NASA to launch rocket on Tuesday
NASA will soon be launching a prototype of its newly designed next-generation rocket, called Ares I. The launch of this prototype will occur at 8 a.m. EDT on Oct. 27 at the Kennedy Space Center. 
The first stage of the capsule will be launched on Tuesday, and this prototype also has a fake second stage capsule and crew capsule attached on top of the first stage.
Ares I was designed to replace NASA’s old fleet of space shuttles that carry astronauts to low-Earth orbit (an orbit close to Earth). 
This flight marks NASA’s first test launch for a crew-carrying rocket since 1981. However, whether Ares I will eventually replace the old fleet depends upon a pending decision by the Obama administration based on the review of a study on U.S. human space plans. 
The study claims that NASA should focus on creating a heavy-lift rocket that could take humans to areas farther in the solar system, like the moon or Mars.

Electric shock helps deliver AIDS vaccine
Researchers claim that giving brief electric shocks while administering certain experimental AIDS vaccines can cause the vaccines to be more effective. The device being used for this technique resembles a handgun and is able to give three brief electric shocks while injecting the vaccine. The electric shocks cause the cell membranes to open up briefly, allowing better absorption of the vaccine.
Scientists claim that the technique, called electroporation, will be especially useful while using vaccines made up of the pathogen’s own genetic material. Once this genetic material is injected into the cell, it can elicit an immune response in the body, thus preparing the body for future attacks by the same pathogen. In the study, a vaccine made up of four genes from an AIDS virus found in China was administered to groups of subjects, some with and some without the electric shocks. None of the subjects given the vaccine without the shock had an immune response, while all those given high doses of the shock along with the vaccine had an immune response.

Scientists find neurons that code time
A team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has discovered neurons that keep track of time in primates. The team trained two macaque monkeys to perform some tasks involving eye movement. During the course of the task, the scientists discovered that a certain set of neurons fired at specific intervals after the task was started. 
The researchers concluded that these neurons were coding the time during the task. These findings were published in last week’s issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
This research could be especially beneficial for patients suffering from Parkinson’s disease. Such patients appear to have impaired time-keeping functions, as time passes more slowly for them and they have difficulty performing activities that require rhythmic coordination, like dancing.

It’s that time of the year again when everyone dresses up in creative outfits to celebrate the lurking spirits of Halloween, and one of the biggest aspects of the holiday is choosing the right costume. So with the coming of the end of October, it’s time to get creative and crazy — dress up as whoever or whatever you choose! It’s not necessary to spend hundreds of dollars on an expensive outfit that you might never use again, and besides, who wants to have the same costume every year?
It’s actually quite simple to whip up an outfit in a dorm room. Whether you want to be a very attractive geek — let’s be honest: We go to Carnegie Mellon, so that shouldn’t be a very hard costume to assemble — or you want to be the charming Jack Sparrow, it’s easier than you think to put these costumes together. Below are guidelines to create some great sample outfits that can be assembled from the contents of your or your friends’ wardrobes — and later, follow some general tips that can make creating the perfect costume much easier.
For the Girls
The Attractive Nerd:
Hey, who said a nerd can’t be irresistible? To be the exception to the unattractive nerd rule, find a pair of glasses — the rounder the better. If you don’t have a pair, borrow one, but it looks like Carnegie Mellon hasn’t gotten to you — yet.
Get a pair of high-waist shorts (you can even make do with a regular pair of shorts or pants) and a fitted T-shirt, which must be tucked in. Also find some suspenders to go with your shorts. An alternative to wearing suspenders could be wearing your Carnegie Mellon ID around your neck. Tie your hair in two pigtails and we’ve officially found one of the most attractive nerds on campus.
A Pretty Butterfly:
This costume is perfect: elegant, gorgeous, and easy to put together. All you need is your favorite little, black dress — any simple, yet stunning dress should do the trick — and once you’ve got that, the only thing left to do is prepare the wings. When it comes to creating the wings, the sky is the limit. Try and use whatever materials are available, like sequins, glitter, and multi-colored paper.
For example, try making the wings out of net by making the frame with a wire and then wrapping the net around the frame. Cardboard wings work well, too. Just cut them out of a sheet of cardboard and use some elastic or a piece of rope so that the wings can be fastened on your shoulders. Add finishing touches with sparkling eye shadow, bright lip gloss, and exaggerated eye makeup, and you’re ready to fly.
For the Boys
Jack Sparrow:
This Pirates of the Caribbean lead is definitely one of the most irresistible characters on the silver screen. To be Johnny Depp’s most popular alias, put on a white, loose shirt (or borrow it from a friend who is a size larger than you), find a vest, a pair of pants to match, a black belt, and a pair of boots. If you can’t find a good pair of boots, try wearing long socks that match the color of the shoes over the pants first, and then wear the shoes.
Tie a bright-colored bandanna (any kind of small colored cloth should work) around your head. You can also get a wig — this will definitely add to the dramatic effect of your outfit. If you plan well in advance, attempt to grow a beard and mustache, but if that is not possible, then you can draw them on with some black eyeliner. Make an eye patch to be an exceptional pirate and you’re ready to get your treasure tonight.
Back to the ’70s:
If you’re the kind of person who wishes time would turn back to the ’70s, to the so-called easier life with not much college work and more parties to attend, dressing as a hippie is a great idea. Wear a tie-dyed T-shirt, a pair of sandals, a headband (use a bandanna or borrow a headband from a girlfriend) and put on a pair of colored sunglasses. To add to the effect and value of the outfit, definitely carry anything that has fringes on it.
Quick Tips:
Dress loose and simple, and make sure you dress to impress! The key to preparing a personal and special in-house outfit is simple:
Keep in mind what you need to prepare the outfit, and in times of confusion, ask your friends; everyone has crazy ideas.
Raid your closet and see what stuff fits the bill.
Borrow stuff from friends that might be necessary to substitute for what you don’t have. Chances are that they also might need to borrow something from you. It is better to borrow than to splurge on an item that isn’t going to be used again.
If you or your friends don’t have an article that might be needed, remember that each article has many ways it can be substituted without losing the authenticity of the outfit.
Work with friends on your costumes, experiment, and go crazy!

Halloween is all about tricks, and stir-fried pumpkin with egg is a tricky dish. Parents make this to trick their children into eating vegetables. Some mothers put this dish on the table to get their children over their fear of vegetables. But, no matter what it is used for, stir-fried pumpkin is a recipe that looks at the iconic Halloween vegetable in a non-sweet way.
Ingredients:
A generous amount of minced garlic
A tablespoon of neutral-tasting oil like peanut, grape seed, olive, or corn oil
Japanese pumpkin
Salt or soy sauce, fish sauce, Hoisin sauce, oyster sauce 
A pinch of sugar
Egg (optional)
The easiest way to peel a clove of garlic, if you’re not using the whole vegetable or the sliced form, is to smash it with the side of the blade of a chef or Santoku knife, parallel to the surface of the board. Place the knife on top of the garlic, and with the other hand exert a significant force on the knife. The skin should separate naturally from the garlic. Once you’ve done this, you can mince the garlic. 
For most cooking, I don’t mind if the pieces of garlic are of different sizes. Some food authorities might say that if the garlic is not evenly minced, some pieces might burn before others get brown. But I just cook until the smaller pieces start to brown and bigger ones are not so cooked. This way, you get a better depth of flavor with sweeter, cooked garlic and a more pungent aroma. 
Slice the pumpkin into 1/8-inch thick pieces that are about 2 inches long. For Japanese pumpkin, I leave the green skin on. It’s easier not to peel the pumpkin; the dish looks prettier this way and it adds to the taste.
You can only season the pumpkin with salt, and for this reason, it’s better to get a local pumpkin from the farmer’s market, as, chances are, the flavor of pumpkin is better. 
Of course, if you are stuck with a pumpkin from the supermarket, go with a heavy seasoning of soy, fish, oyster, and Hoisin sauce. For a regular serving size, start with a teaspoon of everything and give it a taste. If it’s too bland, add either Hoisin or oyster sauce, as they are not as salty as fish and soy sauce.  
It is easier to put all the sauces on the raw pumpkin using the same bowl in which you prepared the pumpkin, or using the cutting board.
On medium to high heat, heat the oil in a wok, a pan, or a pot. When the oil starts to bubble, throw in the minced garlic and keep stirring, as you want to evenly heat the garlic. Once you start to smell the garlic, throw in the whole pumpkin mixed with the sauces. Stir so that everything is mixed well, add two tablespoons or 1/4 cup of water, and close the lid of the pot. 
If you are using a pan, use more water, as it has a larger surface area. If you don’t have a lid, you can put aluminum foil over your vessel and crimp the edges with a cloth. 
The steam will cook the pumpkin, and its color will darken as it becomes a little transparent. If the pumpkin is too dry, add a little bit of water to it.
If you want to add egg, do it right before the pumpkin is cooked. Turn up the heat on the stove, push the pumpkin to the side of your pot, and add another tablespoon of oil. Crack an egg or two between the pumpkin mixture and break the yolk. Let the egg sit until it is cooked and then stir it in with the rest of the pumpkin.
Enjoy this dish with rice, or eat as a side dish with any Western, meat-based meal. You can serve it next to broiled T-bone steak (then skip the Asian sauce and use the salt instead), stir in with cooked pasta, or have it with Thanksgiving turkey.

An eerie voice, heavily laced with a foreign accent, greeted the audience as the show was about to begin. “Pleeese turn off your cellular phones and refrain from text messageeing as eet disrupts the actors of the show... espeeecially Count Dracula.” The announcement ended with an evil laugh. With such a start, it was evident that the play was going to be entertaining, albeit with a twist.
University of Pittsburgh Repertory Theatre’s presentation of Count Dracula was the perfect pre-Halloween treat — a comedy about one of the most infamous horror characters of all time. The play, a comic retelling of the famous novel Dracula, was originally written by Ted Tiller in 1971 and was excellently reenacted by Pitt Rep.
The first thing that was noticeable about the play was the lavish sets. The gothic style of the room in which most of the scenes took place suited the mood of the play. The set was carefully detailed, right from the balcony doors that opened to a view of Count Dracula’s castle to the suit of armor standing in the corner. The sets thus served to create the mood of the play and added a dark and mysterious air to the entire performance.
The story, which takes place in Dr. Seward’s Asylum for the Criminally Insane, revolves around how Wilhelmina “Mina” Murray (played by Ana Noriega), who lives with the Sewards, is mysteriously ill after her first acquaintance with a newcomer in town — the Transylvanian Count Dracula (played by Sam Turich). 
The play outlines the tribulations of Dr. Seward (played by Bruce McConachie), his German friend Helga Von Helsing (played by Elena Alexandratos), and Mina’s fiance Jonathan Harker (played by Eric Prendergast), as they set out to try and kill the count, who they realize is a vampire.
Other characters, notably Dr. Seward’s sister, Sybil (played by Holly Thuma), added excellent comic touches to the otherwise dark theme of the play. Sybil’s witty one-liners and fetish for drinking sherry made for some very good laughs. Cameron Crowe, who portrayed the character of Renfield, Dracula’s minion — as well as a ward of the asylum — and Noriega put on notable performances. 
Crowe’s expressive acting while depicting an insane character was quite remarkable, as was Noriega’s acting as she portrayed the personality change Mina underwent as she sank deeper and deeper under the vampire’s spell. Turich’s evil smile and regal attitude as he depicted Count Dracula were also a pleasure to watch.
The performance was also full of a number of special effects that made the play all the more entertaining. One such effect was that the light in the window of Dracula’s castle always went out when Dracula was supposedly on the move and out of his house. Other effects also helped add to the enjoyment of watching the play — Count Dracula was able to pop up in a picture frame hung in the Sewards’ house, the suit of armor in the room turned its head obligingly toward Dracula when he summoned it, and Dracula also turned into a bat in front of the audience, zooming right out of the stage over the heads of the astounded audience. 
One of the most enjoyable scenes of the play was when Dracula was shown to be invisible. A ray of light hovered around the stage in this scene, indicating the presence of Dracula. When the ray fell upon a chair on the sets, the chair swung back and forth, and when it fell upon the couch in the room, a distinctive sound of feet rubbing against leather could be heard.
The highlight of the play was the very end. The characters were rushing to Dracula’s tomb in this scene, and instead of entering the set from the wings, the actors ran down to the stage by coming through the balcony seating area, walking amid the audience, and finally climbing down to the stage by a side staircase. 
The actors also carried flashlights during this little chase, allowing the audience members to feel that they were a part of the story that was taking place.
Count Dracula thus boasted of some excellent special effects and great performances. Check out the performance for some Halloween fun. It provides spine-tingling moments, but at the same time retains elements of a light-hearted comedy.
Count Dracula is playing at the Charity Randall Theatre from Oct. 22 to Nov. 1.

If you find yourself looking for something to do this Halloween (other than knocking on the doors of local Pittsburghers begging for fun-size chocolate bars), fear not. If you’d like to stay relatively local, Allegheny County has a few great options ranging from amusement parks to haunted tunnels; the county offers several options if you’re looking for some scares.
One attraction is the Hundred Acres Manor Haunted House, located in South Park. Here, visitors get to roam through the old house, meeting some ghosts and spirits along the way. And people’s desire to be scared will be appreciated by the folks at Hundred Acres Manor, as all of the proceeds from admission go directly to Animal Friends and the Allegheny County Homeless Children’s Education Fund. Hundred Acres Manor is open on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays between 7 and 10 p.m. and on Fridays and Saturdays between 7 and 11:30 p.m. Tickets cost $13.
If you’re looking for an unconventional (and free) way to spend Oct. 31, South Park Township is also home to two “haunted” tunnels. According to an urban legend, Green Man’s Tunnel is home to a spirit of a man who hid away after he was electrocuted and disfigured. Not far away is Corvette Tunnel, the alleged site of a drag-racing-gone-wrong incident. Rumor has it that if you drive through the tunnel right as the clock strikes midnight, you can see the lights of a Corvette and hear screeching tires, a revving motor, and the racer’s screams. Alongside this tunnel, there’s a creek that also is believed to carry a dark history: It’s said that a man chopped up his wife and tossed her body into the creek. And, of course, she couldn’t resist coming back to haunt everyone, so it’s said that while walking through the tunnel, the wife’s spirit will pull at your legs, begging for help.
If you’re up for a more adrenaline-filled Halloween, then Phantom Fright Nights at Kennywood is your best bet. In addition to riding roller coasters in the dark, Kennywood offers seven attractions whose descriptive alliterations (Fear Festival, Mortem Manor, Villa of the Vampire, etc.) enhance the macabre atmosphere of the holiday. Kennywood is open on Fridays and Saturdays between 7 p.m. and 1 a.m. Tickets cost $25.
Also in Allegheny County, the ScareHouse offers an experience a la The Shining by taking guests into the old Etna Elks Lodge. ScareHouse consists of three separate “haunts” consisting of complex costumes and ghoulish make-up. Rampage thrusts you into an apocalypse-esque war where zombies and mutants in gas masks lurk around corners; Delirium 3-D offers you a “party” inside a demented and deranged mind (complete with neon clowns), and The Hall of Nightmares is a walk through a house with angry clowns and a guy with no skin. If you’re looking for a guaranteed thrill, it’s safe to say this one can do it for you, since *Hauntworld Magazin*e has ranked ScareHouse the number 5 Best Haunted Attraction in the country and Travel Channel called it one of “America’s Scariest Halloween Attractions.” ScareHouse is open on Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays from 7 to 10 p.m. and on Fridays and Saturdays from 7 p.m. to midnight. Tickets cost $17.
Outside the city, in the neighboring Washington County, are three chilling tours. First is Castle Blood, a highly-interactive experience whose theme this year is “Night of the Vampire: The Dark is Calling.” Castle Blood prides itself on the fact that it doesn’t need any chainsaws or axes to deliver a scare factor, focusing instead on the characters and special effects. Castle Blood is open on Fridays through Sundays from 7 to 10 p.m. Tickets cost $13.
Down in Monongahela, the 17-room McCue Mansion has been transformed to allow visitors to experience the horrors of the residence. Like Castle Blood, Demon House doesn’t rely on chainsaws to give you the chills; instead, it plays upon the house’s history (that nine men disappeared early on, and the house remained empty for 110 years) to give visitors a haunting “experience.” McCue Mansion is open on Sundays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays from 7 to 10 p.m. and on Fridays and Saturdays from 1 p.m. to midnight. Tickets cost $17.
Reminiscent of something you might see on the Travel Channel, Nemacolin Castle serves as the site for ghost tours. While walking around the castle, illuminated only by candlelight, you can hear stories of others’ experiences in Nemacolin. The castle is open on Saturdays and Sundays from 6 to 10 p.m. Tickets cost $7.
Even if you choose instead to dress up and tell jokes to folks in Squirrel Hill next Saturday, at least there is a haunted tunnel in South Park or a mansion with a dark history in Washington County available this weekend. Unfortunately, fun-size Kit Kat bars are not given out at any of these haunted castles.

Pittsburgh has been home to a lot of scary things; see, for example, the haunted Dormonth library or the Pittsburgh Pirates’ season records. But, with all of the haunted houses and ghost stories in this city, many fail to realize the incredible impact that Pittsburgh has had on the Hollywood horror industry. In fact, because of its history, many would be surprised to know that Pittsburgh is commonly referred to as the home of the modern American zombie. 
The concept of the living dead has been present in global culture for centuries now. In communities all over the world, folklore and legends consistently mention the resurrection of the dead. These cultural concepts birthed a modern-day notion, an infectious and highly contagious virus that wakes the dead and allows them to walk among the living as “zombies.” 
Before these flesh-hungry, angry beings made their literary debut in Ambrose Bierce’s The Death of Halpin Frayser, the concept of the living dead had subtly appeared in many earlier publications. Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, for example, is a story of resurrected life that can be traced back to early 1700s European folklore. Even before this, religious stories collected in the Middle Eastern classic One Thousand and One Nights reference ghouls and the undead within their text. By the 19th century, zombies had successfully crept their way into the gothic poems of Edgar Allan Poe and the plots and storylines of countless supernatural novelists. 
Predictably enough, it didn’t take long for the zombies to invade popular culture. Zombies were soon featured in movies and television programs all over the world. 
It was George Romero’s 1968 independent black-and-white release of Night of the Living Dead, though, which truly revolutionized the modern zombie. Romero’s film was subversive and ground-breaking. In the film, the protagonists, played by Duane Jones and Judith O’Dea, find themselves trapped in a rural Pennsylvanian farmhouse attempting to survive a night through a sudden zombie conquest. It was a concept unlike any seen before it: The dead could actually come alive and eat us all.
Romero, a Carnegie Mellon alumnus, quickly became known as the father of the “Zombie Apocalypse” and, conveniently enough, he based his zombie empire right here in Pittsburgh. Not only were a majority of his movies filmed here, but his production company, The Latent Image, and industrial film firm, Hardman Associates, worked out of Pittsburgh as well. 
Because of its incredible popularity, Night of the Living Dead spawned countless imitations, and Romero’s work became the source from which most modern zombie elements were borrowed.
As time progressed, Romero’s zombies evolved. No longer would they just be flocks of decomposing, flesh-hungry people. In his next films, Day of the Dead and Land of the Dead, also filmed here in Pittsburgh, Romero’s zombies appeared capable of learning and adopting methods of communication. Soon, zombie culture would make its way into comedy (Shaun of the Dead) and children’s media (in Disney’s Fido, the main character keeps a zombie as a tame and friendly pet).
Thanks to Romero and his band of corpse-loving creeps, Pittsburgh will forever be the birthplace of the modern zombie. So, this Halloween, instead of wrapping yourself in gauze like a mummy or poking holes in your bed sheets to dress as a ghost, maybe try to show some Pittsburgh pride and don a face of the living dead.

The drum is an instrument that is not often given center stage. Lacking the melody of a piano, the soulfulness of an acoustic guitar, and the sharp tones of a trumpet, the beats of a drum may be understated but are hardly inessential to music. Other instruments may provide melody and harmony, but it is the drum that provides rhythm to song.
From Oct. 15 through 18, the August Wilson Center for African American Culture and Afrika Yetu, organizations that promote African culture, hosted Drum Talk, a four-day event that put the drum in the spotlight. The concert aimed at depicting how the drum is universal; every country has its own variation of this percussion instrument. Just like the drums, the line-up of excellent drummers were from all over the world, and drumming styles from Japan, Brazil, Africa, the Middle East, and, of course, America were on display.
The series of drumming concerts ended on Sunday, Oct. 18, in a finale show that featured legendary jazz drummer Roger Humphries, multi-platinum band Rusted Root’s drummer Jim Donovan, Japan’s Takumi Kato, and Congolese drummer and founder of Afrika Yetu, Elie Kihonia.
Kato was, without a doubt, the most impressive among all the performers, drawing gasps and loud applause from the audience during his act. He beat on four large Japanese drums — one of them was so large it was propped up on a stand — with extra-thick drumsticks, and displayed an unbelievable amount of strength and energy as he played the drums at a lightning-fast speed and even jumped in the air several times during his performance. Kato beat the drums so hard and fast that his hands were a blur — he even broke a drumstick with his force, causing him to stop and look in the audience for the broken piece apologetically. His stage presence was very charismatic because, although the audience was in awe of him, he interacted with the audience members easily by cracking minor jokes about how tired he was.
Humphries, a Pittsburgh native and famous jazz percussionist — Feb. 23 has been declared by the state of Pennsylvania and the city of Pittsburgh to be Roger Humphries Day — opened the show with his jazz band. His drumming blended well with the sounds of the trumpet and saxophone, but what stood out was Humphries’ exceptional drum solos in which he went all out, playing complex and foot-tapping rhythms.
Donovan, the last performer, was joined by other drummers, two guitarists, a keyboardist, and Kihonia. Up until this point in the performance, the drums had either been played with accompaniment, like Humphries, or solo, like Kato, but not all together, so when Donovan and his team began to play their drums, they created a sound like nothing else. While it might seem that many drums beating together would produce chaos rather than music, Donovan was able to produce a steady, powerful, and rhythmic beat that made the audience want to stand up and dance.
Apart from his experience in his band, Rusted Root, Donovan has studied many different African styles of drumming and incorporates this into his sound. Thus, he plays a unique mixture of beats that is a pleasure to hear.
While Kato was the most impressive, Kihonia was definitely the life of the performance. Although Kihonia didn’t perform alone — he played with Humphries and Donovan — his playing and singing clearly stood out. Dressed in beautiful, traditional African attire with a smile to match, he insisted that the audience have a good time during the performance by encouraging them to dance along to the beats. He also demonstrated a few dance moves that the audience sportingly mimicked. Kihonia stressed the importance of fun in everyone’s lives. “If you’re angry, you don’t deserve to live!” he said, emphasizing that parents should let their children enjoy themselves and actually join in on the fun.
Before being the head of the non-profit organization, Kihonia is first a Congolese master drummer and is skilled in various instruments including the xylophone, mbira, guitar, keyboard, accordion, and, of course, hand and set drums. Kihonia has a passion for spreading African culture, and this passion was plainly seen when he requested each of the audience members grab one of the many drums placed at either end of the auditorium and try a hand at drumming.
Toward the end of the performance, Donovan, Kihonia, and the rest of the drummers were joined on stage by Kato and African drummers from the previous days’ performances. It was obvious that none of this drumming had been previously rehearsed and it was amazing to see how so many experienced and talented drummers could all play together in harmony.
Kihonia conducted a little exercise in which the audience members tried to repeat a rhythm on their own drum that one of the professional drummers played. This was fun because, although the audience was clearly not in the same league as the professionals, they were encouraged to practice a few beats and interact with the performers on stage.

In high school I was lucky enough to spend a summer in Bath, England while my dad was working there. I knew I wanted to go back to England someday, and that ended up being sooner rather than later when I decided to study abroad. I was lucky enough to find a school, London Metropolitan University, which had the classes that I needed to take for my biology major and art minor. Throughout my semester in London, I kept a blog so that I could easily share my adventures with family and friends back home. Every couple of weeks, I would write up a long entry describing my experiences. The following are highlights from my blog posts.
Jan. 28, 2009
As I drove to the airport it finally hit me: I was going to London... alone. Later, when I looked out my window as we were landing and saw the English countryside, I got a surge in my chest that was a mix of excitement and apprehension when I realized that I was really going to live here!
I spent the first few days settling into my dorm room, as well as exploring the neighborhoods around King’s Cross, touring Piccadilly Circus, and investigating my new campus.
Feb. 3, 2009
On Saturday, I went to St. Paul’s Cathedral with other students in my program. My friends in other programs were jealous that ours had so much planned out for us. We saw where St. Paul’s was hit in the blitz, and I was absolutely in love with the wood carvings and glittering mosaics.
In that first month, we checked out the famed Oxford Street for some shopping, watched the Steelers win the Super Bowl in an American student bar, and found out that our first day of classes was canceled because London had had the worst snow in 18 years the night before.
Feb. 10, 2009
I remember seeing Windsor Castle as I was flying in — it’s hard to miss! It’s the largest inhabited castle in the world. The main rooms were absolutely gorgeous with amazing gold tapestries, paintings, furniture, and clocks everywhere. There were enormous armory rooms with huge displays of guns and swords to show how well the Crown is protected.
Feb. 24, 2009
One of my favorite sites was the Tower of London — it’s always cool to see the Beefeaters, medieval graffiti, and the original chopping block used for executions. We continued our big tourist day by visiting Big Ben and Westminster Abbey.
Apr. 20, 2009
It was tough to adjust to a new Blackboard-like website and class structure, and figuring out when my final exams were was the final challenge. In the UK they call studying “revising,” and the last day of classes and finals are often far apart.
My program took weekend trips to Edinburgh, Oxford, and Stratford. Highlights of the trip were the great English accents, seeing Edinburgh Castle, trying haggis — a dish made of sheep’s heart, liver, and lungs and usually boiled in the animal’s stomach for three hours, and plenty of Harry Potter, Shakespeare, Tolkien, and C.S. Lewis landmarks pointed out to us by our tour guides.
A few friends and I planned our own Ireland trip. We saw the beautiful cliffs of Moher and subjected the Irish to dealing with crazy Americans getting lost driving on the other side of the road with a stick shift.
Apr. 26, 2009
For spring break, I took a trip around Europe on the Eurail with two friends, one of whom had won three passes through a Facebook contest. We went to too many great cities to describe them all. We first landed in Hamburg, which was having the largest fair in Northern Germany, and we had fun checking out the rides and eating bratwurst. Prague was one of my favorites with beautiful old landmarks like the Old Town Square, Old Jewish Cemetery, and the Charles Bridge.
We continued on to Krakow to see the World War II concentration camps: Auschwitz and Buchenwald — an unlikely choice for a fun spring break trip, but we thought it was something we needed to see. When the tour guide stated how many people died in Auschwitz, I uncontrollably got the chills and felt the gravity of the fact that this happened here.
Next, we traveled to Vienna for a day. We learned a lot about train travel, including how you should always designate a private sleeping car and shower when you have the option. Also, we were awoken when the train crossed the border into Austria by knocking and “Austrian police! Passports!” When the border police officer saw our passports, he exclaimed, “California! Arnold Schwarzenegger is a good president of California!”
Venice is a great city for just walking around and getting lost. I was lucky enough to go to the San Marco Basilica for Easter mass — all in Italian, of course. We took a train to Dusseldorf but got to the wrong airport. We had no idea that there were two airports in Dusseldorf, so we took an expensive, long cab ride to the right airport and, thankfully, made it in time for our flight. At least things had gone relatively smoothly until the end.
It was sad that this experience had to end and I had to part from the amazing people I met along my journey, but I know that leaving London and my friends won’t be goodbye forever.

From Oct. 16 to 18, the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre (PBT) presented a production of The Sleeping Beauty, a ballet composed by Pyotr Tchaikovsky and choreographed by Marius Petipa. The cast for the show changed each night; this review details the performances from opening night on Oct. 16.
The ballet, which originally premiered at the Maryinsky Ballet in St. Petersburg, tells the story of a princess, Aurora, who is cursed by an evil witch and who, when pricked by the spindle of a spinning wheel, falls into a deep sleep and can only be woken by her true love’s kiss.
The PBT production featured glittering costumes, a (silent) cackling witch, and a set that masterfully switched between palatial balls and the deep woods. 
At one point in the third act, during the celebration of the wedding of Princess Aurora (Kumiko Tsuji) and Prince Desire (Christopher Budzynski), the creativity of the costume designers and the dancers really came through. In the bluebird dance, Alexandra Kochis and Alexandre Silva performed steps that mirrored the actions of birds, keeping their moves light and fluttering. Their costumes contained texturing that looked like feathers as well.
In the cat dance, Puss in Boots (Nicholas Coppula) and the White Cat (Alison Kappes) humorously played with each other on stage, dancing and occasionally slapping each other’s ears. The scene evoked laughter from the audience, who seemed to appreciate the characterization of the cats. 
The wicked fairy that cursed Aurora, Carabosse (Julia Erickson), was especially good in this performance. Erickson channels her inner witch on stage, and without ever making a sound, she is able to make the audience hear her cackling. 
Tsuji as Aurora was very impressive. At several points, her ability to maintain balance on one foot with seemingly no effort evoked applause in the middle of a scene.  The Lilac Fairy (Christine Schwaner) was an integral part of the ballet. It is because of her that Aurora sleeps rather than dies due to Carabosse’s curse, and she appears to keep the story moving in every act. She is also featured in several dance numbers throughout the show, and in each, her skill is showcased perfectly.
Throughout the show, each move was executed flawlessly — or, at least, if there was a flaw, it was certainly not visible or noticeable to the audience, and the dancers hid it well. The music matched each movement and added depth and emotion to every dance.

Carnegie Mellon is a campus well known for the rigorous coursework and the many hours of studying that students put into their academics. So, in order to lighten the load just a tad, Raymond Ejiofor brings Random Acts of Dance (RAD) to the campus. RAD is an event of DS Dance Company, which is a subsidiary of Dancers’ Symposium. Students work on choreography each week to perform every Wednesday at 12:20 p.m. at a new and random place on campus. These random acts of dance are selections from pieces that students are working on, as a part of the repertoire for the company, or just experimental pieces. “RAD was created to promote dance awareness and movement on campus and to explore dance in unconventional spaces,” said Ejiofor. Some of the past performances have included the “stage” on CFA Lawn, the Fence, and the walkway between the Purnell Center and the University Center.
The performance is exactly what its name suggests: random. Unless you know what is going to happen, you will most likely be an innocent bystander who is lucky enough to witness the dancers taking their places on whatever campus spot has become their stage for the week. Walking across campus, you never know which direction to look in, because dancers may come from anywhere. The dancing starts out of nowhere and you almost have no idea who the participants are as they start spreading out and moving at their own accord, very random indeed. The students work together to make the piece look separated and as spread out as possible, and they are placed many feet away from each other, covering a wide range of space. As the music climaxes and the performance comes together, they start to take shape and create a formation and perform a simultaneous dance.
The end of the dance finishes just as randomly as it begins. The performers walk away from their positions, pick up their bags, and head off to class or whatever other event they have planned at 12:30 p.m. The pieces never last for more than a few minutes, so if you are late, chances are you will miss the whole thing. But if you are around, you have the opportunity to witness RAD as they share their talent and abilities with the rest of campus and spread a bit of liveliness and joy to the crowd that gathers in between classes.
There are many different ways for students to express their creativity at Carnegie Mellon. RAD provides another outlet for these students to release their creative energy. “I dance because I can’t see myself doing anything else. It’s what I think about when I wake up in the morning, it’s what makes me happy, and it’s what I am passionate about. I want to share this feeling with members of the campus community,” said Ejiofor.
This is RAD’s first year on campus, and while it is in its incipient stages, it has been a success by drawing in a large audience at more than one of its presentations, creating major awareness. “I have never seen anything like this on campus. I was on my way to class and a girl started dancing in front of me. I wanted to see what she was doing so I stopped to watch. When I realized that she was part of a larger group of people, I became more interested. It was very random, but I wouldn’t mind seeing it again,” Luke Johnson, a senior economics major, said.
In the years to come, Ejiofor says that he hopes to influence and inspire others to see their passions and interests outside of the classroom. “While I may be laying down the foundation for this company, I hope this event, as well as the DS Dance Company, become well recognized and able to influence the campus, as well as the Pittsburgh community through the arts.”

Last Saturday, at the Ches-a-rena venue in Cheswick, the Silversun Pickups and their opening acts collaborated to form the perfect shoegaze lineup, characterized by distorted guitar effects and creative synths. The band just kicked off their 2009 fall tour to celebrate the release of their new album, Swoon.
There was a constant flow of energy throughout the evening. Each act, though they were all extremely different, added something to the experience that made for beautiful symbiotic performances. It seemed as if there was no part of the evening that would disappoint.
Though a little ways out of Pittsburgh, Ches-a-rena, an indoor roller-skating rink turned evening concert venue hidden above the local Goodwill, was the perfect venue to house this eccentric show. The hall was quickly filled with a diverse group of fans. From 60-year-old all-female biker gangs to nine-year-old first time concert-goer Megan Cooper — the show certainly attracted a peculiar crowd. Although extremely quirky, the crowd’s energy proved endless.
An Horse, who had previously opened for Tegan and Sara on their 2008 tour and Death Cab for Cutie on their Australian tour, provided a perfect beginning. With their catchy melodies and skilled harmonies, band members and Aussies Kate Cooper and Damon Cox showed audiences how to make two instruments sound like one beautiful indie rock symphony. The group played songs off their newest album, Rearrange Beds, and previewed some tunes from the upcoming EP.
Things got a little crazy when Cage the Elephant, coming all the way from Bowling Green, K. hit the stage. Front man and lead singer Matt Shultz worked the stage with his vicious vocals and crowd dives. During “Ain’t No Rest for the Wicked,” Shultz got lost while crowd surfing in a sea of fans. The band’s set consisted of angry, hyped-up versions of some hits from their 2008 release Cage the Elephant, as well as some new tracks from their upcoming album. 
By the time the Silversun Pickups had made it on stage, the crowd was bursting with anticipation and enthusiasm. Lead singer and guitarist Brian Aubert, bassist Nikki Monninger, drummer Christopher Guanlao, and keyboardist Joe Lesser began the show with a roar of synth and distortion that quickly became a regular trend between songs. The group played a variety of tracks from their new album, but also made sure to include some billboard favorites from their previous album, Carnavas, like “Little Lovers So Polite” and “Lazy Eye.”
Because the show itself was on the smaller side, the band was able to form a relationship with the crowd. In between songs and charismatic banter from Aubert and Monninger, the group even took questions from the crowd. The personal atmosphere only added to the experience, making it impossible not to adore the set.
By popular demand, the group ended the show with a three-song encore including the crowd favorite “Substitution” from Swoon.

Eulogizing someone you are close to is hard, but what’s even harder is being asked to talk about someone you don’t know at all. That is why when famous author and sportswriter Mitch Albom was requested by his 82-year-old rabbi, Albert Lewis, to write his eulogy, Albom was dumbfounded. Caught in a quandary, Albom decided to meet with Lewis, or as Albom fondly calls him, “the Reb,” to get to know him better. While Albom wasn’t aware of it then, agreeing to eulogize his rabbi would lead him down a path that would result in him publishing his second nonfiction novel, Have A Little Faith, and help him to discover his own faith in the process.
Albom catapulted to fame with the release of his first nonfiction novel, Tuesdays with Morrie, which was converted into a popular TV film by Oprah Winfrey. Since then, Albom has been active in the sports and literary fields by continuing his radio talk shows and writing more books like The Five People You Meet in Heaven and For One More Day.
Last Tuesday, Albom made an appearance at the Byham Theater, and the residents of Pittsburgh got a chance to listen to him talk about his latest release. As witty and engrossing as his writing, Albom captivated the audience with nuances about how the events leading up to the writing of the book unfolded, and the thought process behind its creation.
The book follows the story of two religious figures: A rabbi and a priest, Lewis and Henry Covington, emerge from completely different backgrounds and separate religions, but unite in their faith in God.
While Lewis’ story relates with what we usually expect from a man of faith, Covington’s succeeds in surprising us all. Growing up in a broken home, Covington’s childhood is fractured, and after his father’s death, he enters a life of crime. He passes his years trafficking drugs, serving time in jail, and being a part of local mobs, but what finally brings his downfall is his drug addiction. Crazed by the need to consume more drugs, Covington spends all his money and is reduced to stealing from his friends, and on one lonely night — afraid that his friends will return to make him pay for his actions — Covington begins to pray to God, pleading that he will forever serve God if he is spared today.
Years later, Covington is now a transformed person: a pastor in Detroit, Mich., Albom’s hometown. He looks after a crumbling church that serves as a shelter for homeless people, but can hardly be considered a shelter because of a large hole in the ceiling that lets in all the elements, making the freezing winters of Detroit especially difficult.
Albom, who has opened three of his own charities to aid the impoverished in Detroit, is interested in helping the homeless, and in his attempt to do so, crosses paths with Covington and befriends him.
During his talk, Albom mentioned the kind of person he was before he grew to know Lewis and Covington — detached from religion, and happy to be that way. But by meeting these two remarkable individuals, Albom got a chance to speak with them about why they believe and what keeps their faith going: questions that are universal.
By describing how two men discovered and keep their faith, Have A Little Faith attempts to spread the word about how believing in a higher being can make people’s lives seem so much less lonely and helpless than believing in nothing at all.

At some point during high school, I swore off eating shark fin and all its manifestations. It was not solely an environmentally friendly decision — sharks are brutally killed for the primary purpose of obtaining its fin — but with the abundance of fake shark fin in the market, why be irresponsible when it comes to health?
The numerous available sustainable seafood advisory lists make it easier for consumers to be responsible. One of the most well-known guides, Monterey Bay Aquarium’s Seafood Watch, is a program that aims to raise awareness among seafood eaters to enjoy seafood sustainably and responsibly. 
On its website, Seafood Watch states that its members “believe that seafood from sources, either fished or farmed, that can exist over the long-term without compromising species’ survival or the health of the surrounding ecosystem is sustainable.” Apart from this strong aim, the most attractive part of Seafood Watch is that it is user-friendly.
Seafood Watch updates its list from time to time, and the guide can be downloaded from the Monterey Bay Aquarium website, www.montereybayaquarium.org. But what really makes Seafood Watch highly accessible is its iPhone/iPod touch application. Electronically updating the list has never been easier. 
The list is sorted by region for easier navigation. Once you’ve chosen a region, you can view the list alphabetically. Each fish is rated according to a color scheme as Best Choice, Good Alternative, or Avoid. Each list also gives some explanation about the market name, health alert, and summary of why that particular fish is rated Best Choice or Avoid. 
In seafood bars or supermarkets, it seems logical that farmed salmon would be a better choice environmentally than wild salmon, since farming does not disturb the natural habitat of wild salmon in streams. In actuality, consuming wild salmon is significantly better for the environment. The salmon farming industry extremely pollutes the environment, and the methods of fishing wild salmon are so well-managed that they are more sustainable. For all these reasons, eating wild salmon is actually better for the environment.
It’s not only concern for the environment; industrially grown animals are unhealthy to eat. Fundamentally, when anything — fish, vegetable, or chicken — is produced on a large scale, the producer will put them in an artificial environment for more efficient production. For vegetables, these man-made modifications come in the form of pesticides, while farm-raised salmon are loaded with antibiotics. Essentially, antibiotics prevent or slow down the growth of bacteria, beneficial or not. If we are so strict about taking just the precise amount of prescribed human antibiotics, why should we consume the animal version uncontrollably? 
There’s a need for consumers to start thinking about what’s on their plate and where it comes from. It’s about understanding food from start to finish — the entire “life cycle.” 
One of the most famous fish featured in discussions about “green” seafood is blue fin tuna. Blue fin tuna, the filet mignon of all the fish in the ocean, is highly priced by all sushi restaurants. At the Nobu restaurant chain, owned by Nobu Matsuhisa, customers can find blue fin tuna on the menu, and, lately, the restaurant and owner have been under attack for serving this endangered species of fish. Being a high profile restaurant, food conscious people are looking for Nobu to set the right example by sending a responsible message to consumers. Celebrity clients, such as Gwyneth Paltrow, have publicly sworn off Nobu until the restaurant’s position on including blue fin tuna on their menu has changed. 
With the spotlight on blue fin tuna, we often forget that this endangered tag is not a permanent one. Hold on to your appetite and find a good substitute on Seafood Watch. With lower consumption, these species will be available again, and this is precisely the reason that Seafood Watch and other lists are constantly updated. Fish are taken on and off the list depending on whether consumers want more or less of them and how the industry treats the species. 
Mark Bittman, a *New York Time*s food writer, put it a simpler way: “Pretend it’s whale. Would you eat it if it were whale?”

Entering the cacophonous hall during tuning and loosening of fingers and lungs, one is struck by the activity and excitement on stage. The audience looks distinguished; that is to say, there was a lot of gray hair. So began the night at Heinz Hall, featuring the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra concert entitled Composing with Words.
Three distinct pieces were performed: Peter Mennin’s Concertato for Orchestra, Moby Dick, started the evening; following was the world premiere of A Woman’s Life. After intermission, the orchestra returned for a full symphony — Sibelius’ No. 2.
Smartly dressed in elegant black, the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, with nimble fingers especially flying on fortissimo sections, certainly lived up to its world class status. Conductor Leonard Slatkin spent the night in his element, nearly dancing in the fluidity of his movements, adding an occasional hop (one can only assume unconsciously) for emphasis as he directed the orchestra.
The single movement Moby Dick, inspired by Melville’s novel of the same name, begins simply but quickly progresses to an up-tempo, rhythmically-charged, powerful, yet harmonious level from which it rarely leaves. Featuring handoffs between melody-developing winds and melody-sustaining strings, this dynamic piece serves as a very well-thought opener that engages and energizes the audience and demonstrates the power of sound.
A Woman’s Life was born of a collaboration between Richard Danielpour, a Grammy Award-winning American composer, and poet Maya Angelou. Danielpour wrote it especially for dramatic soprano Angela Brown. Created to reflect the trajectory of a woman’s life, Angelou’s selected poem titles include “Little Girl Speakings,” “Life Doesn’t Frighten Me,” “Come and Be My Baby,” and others.
Starting with a childhood of innocence and whimsical carefree adulation for parents (“Little Girl Speakings”), expressed both musically and lyrically (“Ain’t nobody better than Daddy...”), the composition progresses through the insecurity of teenage years to the especially self-confident and evocatively sophisticated sexually charged “Come and Be My Baby.” 
It warrants mention that soprano Brown could have better served this section by utilizing a more jazzy approach to her singing. A melancholy tone sets in with “My Life Has Turned to Blue,” aptly reflected in the music.
“The up-tempo parts meshed with the upbeat lyrics in some sections, but the more melancholy verses didn’t always fit the music,” observed Tracy Clough, a Columbia University English graduate student.
Returning from intermission, the orchestra performed Jean Sibelius’ Symphony No. 2 in D major, Opus 43. The Finnish composer’s symphony was finished in 1902 and consists of four movements: Allegretto, Andante ma rubato, Vivacissimo, and Finale: Allegro moderato.
Initially the melodic sections sound disjointed, as shifts of melodic continuity are short-lived. This is a hallmark of Sibelius’ compositional style. 
The ending was a tease of continual climaxes that dissipated and built again ever higher until finally achieving restrained grandeur of musical accomplishment.

So, you’re in your dorm and you hear some God-awful techno blasting down the hall. You’re not doing too much, just trying to get a glimpse of the line that determines the limits of your reality and coming to the realization that you are the dreamer dreaming up the dream that is your life. You know, simple stuff, really. But, despite how mundane those thoughts might be, you just can’t concentrate because the atrociously bland music is numbing each and every neuron in your body. The good, peaceful numbing: the abysmal complacent numbness that you get from staring at the television for three hours.
Well, my friends, that techno that you’re hearing is the tip of an incredible iceberg. Unbeknownst to you, this repulsively bland entity is nothing more than a mislabeled genre. Electronic music is better described as a means of instrumentation. It’s not a new age development, but an example of what happens when humans find new media for creation. Its history as an established aesthetic begins when Ferruccio Busoni published Sketch of a New Esthetic of Music. Quite a piece of work. Nevertheless, I haven’t explained what you’ll find when you swim off the shore of traditional music: simply that you’ve overlooked a beautiful and cryptic expanse of sounds.
So, you’re wondering what you should check out to see the vast gamut of sonic tapestries that exist in the realm of electronic music, aren’t you? Well, for starters, listen to Aphex Twin, which is, in my opinion, an incredibly effective primer in learning how to “brain dance.” Aphex Twin’s discography contains a range of acid (’90s jungle), synesthetic ambient, drum and bass, classical, songs about milkmen, noise, spectrographic analysis, and rich, intricate rhythms at all sorts of tempos.
The big thing that electronic music did for me was that it taught me how to know what I liked hearing. Abrasive, minimal, ethereal, ghostly, uplifting, soul-crushing, body rockin’, mind soothing; believe you me, my friend, someone has recorded it and it’s waiting for you to experience it.
No more “Sandstorm.” Ever.

Dear Rohit,
I am thinking about moving in with my girlfriend next semester when my apartment lease runs out, but some of my friends don’t think it’s a good idea. What do you think?
—Moving In Or Out
Dear Moving,
We’re lucky that we can even consider the option of cohabitation — a couple generations ago it would have been scandalous even to think of it. Even so, just because coed housing is mostly accepted nowadays, it doesn’t mean living with your partner is necessarily a good idea. Living with someone you love can be like a fabulous dream, but make sure you’re doing it for the right reasons. Moving in with somebody to save money, to piss off your parents, or to test him or her out before marriage are all important considerations but are definitely not good reasons to do so.
Do remember, it’s difficult enough to break up with someone, but it’s even worse when you have to pack up boxes and break leases on top of the heartache. I am guessing this is the concern voiced by your friends. But, hey, love is all about risks, right? Just make sure you’ve thought about all the pros and cons and are ready to deal with them before signing that lease.
Enjoy your stay,
—Rohit
Dear Rohit,
Help! My ex-girlfriend lives just down the hall from me, and though we’re still good friends, I have a big problem. I brought someone else home the other night and it was incredibly awkward. I don’t want to make my ex-girlfriend feel bad, but I need to move on!
—Seeking To Attract Girls
Dear STAG,
That’s an unfortunate
situation. However, it’s really good that you and your ex have managed to remain friends — that’s an accomplishment in and of itself. If you’re sure that there’s nothing between the two of you anymore (and you should really try to figure that out), then there’s no reason you shouldn’t go on living your life. That doesn’t mean rubbing it in her face, though.
Especially if it’s a one-night-only type of situation, there’s no reason you can’t stay in your room instead of hanging out in common areas. And, as always, turn on a stereo as a precaution. Trust me: The walls are always thinner than you think they are.
Have fun,
—Rohit

Lehigh and Carnegie Tech were rivals back in the day, and this week’s edition of The Tartan lists the average age, height, and weight of the two teams’ football players. The average Tech player is 21 years old, 5’9’’, and weighs 166 lbs., while the average Lehigh player is 22 years old, a whopping 5’11’’, and 174 lbs. I miss the days of the pre-steroid era when Skinny McSkinnyguy lobbed passes to Shorty McShorterson.

Skibo cafeteria is being demolished! No, not the one in the University Center — sorry, fans of Ginger’s — but the former Skibo, which used to be located where Hunt Library currently stands. You can tell how much stock a school puts in its academics when it starts eliminating food options in favor of books.

The Zeta Beta Tau (ZBT) fraternity was dismissed from campus this week following a hearing about a brawl between brothers and members of the Korean Students Association. The university and fraternity advisors claimed that ZBT failed to provide a safe environment for other students. It is unknown what will happen to ZBT’s 37 pledges, but chances are they did not go out for MMA wrestling.

An article on CampusLink, a phone service that has a $150 call limit, decries that the system is a rip off for Carnegie Mellon students. Among the charges are high prices, late fees, and late — in some cases no — notification of bill payments, leading to greater late fees. Sounds like the Pittsburgh Parking Authority modeled their fines system on CampusLink’s.

The showing of the film Fahrenhype 9/11, which rebuts many of the claims made in Michael Moore’s documentary Fahrenheit 9/11, precedes a lecture that is to be given by Moore himself later in the week. Those silly people: When will they ever learn how to spell? Or perhaps it’s supposed to be a clever pun.

“How Things Work” chronicles exactly how IMAX films work. Surprisingly, it isn’t magic. In fact, 215 lb. cameras whose motors emit 65 decibels of sound (similar to a chainsaw) are needed to throw up images on screens that are 98 feet tall. It would be just like showing a movie on my big fat behind.

Recently, Carnegie Mellon was ranked 19th in the presentation titled “Saviors of Our Cities: A Survey of Best College and University Civic Partnerships,” conducted by Evan S. Dobelle, president of Westfield State College. According to the official website, the 25 colleges and universities “were selected because of their positive impact on their urban communities, including both commercial and residential activities such as revitalization, cultural renewal, economics, and community service and development.”
Pennsylvania is home to four of the universities on the list of 25, more than any other state included in the rankings. University of Pennsylvania, University of Pittsburgh, and Drexel University tied for first, tied for second, and placed 10th, respectively.
The survey noted the Summer Academy for Mathematics and Sciences (SAMS), and Dobelle praised this program for its engagement of prospective college students. Lindsey Pherribo, currently a first-year biology major, was a part of SAMS the summer before her senior year in high school. Pherribo enjoyed the variety of classes, saying that “the course options vary depending on which grade you’re in, but I took a biology class, calculus, SAT prep, and music engineering. I also had an English class where we worked on things to prepare us for applying to college such as college admissions essays.”
Both the SAMS program and the city left a positive impression on Pherribo, as she says that Pittsburgh was one of the reasons she decided to attend Carnegie Mellon upon her acceptance.
“SAMS was really helpful to me in helping me choose a college and getting through the college admissions process,” said Pherribo, adding that the program is “very organized” and “well run.”
Also mentioned in the survey was the Leonard Gelfand Center for Outreach and Service Learning, which deals with over 85 programs serving local students and teachers from kindergarten to 12th grade. Offered are opportunities in “professional development and certification, as well as children’s tutoring, mentoring and enrichment,” according to a Carnegie Mellon website about the Gelfand Center.
Over the past academic year alone, Carnegie Mellon students, faculty, and staff have donated over 88,000 hours of service to Pittsburgh. There are several options to serve through the Gelfand Center, including taking “service learning” courses which allow students “to complete coursework while assisting local non-profit organizations,” according to the website.
For an article on the Carnegie Mellon website, Judith Hallinen, assistant vice provost for educational outreach and director of the Gelfand Center, said that the programs can “encourage students from all disciplines to be more reflective on their responsibility to society with the talents that they have.”
“We want our students to consider what can you do that will change someone’s life, what is the thing that you can do that will make a difference?” Hallinen said.
Greek life on campus is also known to be a helping hand within the Pittsburgh community. Andrew Robb, a junior ethics, history, and public policy major, holds the title of community service chair for Delta Tau Delta fraternity. The brothers of this fraternity are no strangers to helping out and giving back to the community. The fraternity has had partnerships with Allegheny Youth Development, Adopt-a-School, and Habitat for Humanity. Regarding future organizations to partner up with, Robb says, “We are currently fielding ideas for what other organizations we would like to work with next semester.”
Robb also hinted at the anticipated future of the fraternity by saying that “DTD has expressed its goal of becoming a service-oriented fraternity” and that the members hope that their organization “will be firmly established as a leader in the Pittsburgh community service committee.”
Robb believes that volunteering should be a requirement for all college students. “There is a whole list of intangible life skills that one can learn through community service.”

Fareed Zakaria, CNN host and editor of Newsweek International, opened the Pittsburgh Middle East Institute’s second annual conference last Wednesday at the Carnegie Music Hall.
A leading analyst of international relations, geopolitics, and the global economy, Zakaria discussed the growing significance of the Middle East on the international political stage. According to Zakaria, the real solution to the Middle East crisis lies within the changing socioeconomic fabric of the region itself. “The desire to combine modernity with authenticity is the real solution to the extremity and regress in the Middle East,” Zakaria said.
Former Treasury Secretary Paul O’Neill introduced Zakaria as a “master at getting knowledgeable people to discuss important issues,” referring to his talk show, Fareed Zakaria GPS, a weekly CNN production on public affairs.
Zakaria dismissed the idea that capitalism faces a bleak future as a force in the world economy. “A year ago, people predicted the downfall of capitalism and a complete transformation of the world stage — as of today, well, looks pretty much the same to me,” he said.
Zakaria explained that the ordinary citizen’s fears of the economic crisis are analogous to those provoked by the swine flu epidemic. “The nature of the problem is indeed dangerous, but the government is effectively responding,” Zakaria said.
Similarly, he suggested that despite the Wall Street collapse, the government, the businesses, and the people responded to the crisis, which in turn is helping the economy swing back into shape.
Tapping into Middle Eastern affairs — his specialty — Zakaria proposed a robust capitalist solution to the woes of the region. He also discussed the decreasing impact of Islamic fundamentalism on the Muslim population, and how a shift toward a more capitalist culture in the broader Middle East can further help uproot the desire to follow an extremist agenda.
The Middle East spans southwestern Asia, southeastern Europe, and northeastern Africa, with many oil-rich monarchies — such as the United Arab Emirates and Qatar — located in and around the Persian Gulf. 
The wealthy monarchies, Zakaria suggests, represent the future of the Middle East as they continue to modernize in a slow organic manner instead of booming into brutal dictatorships.
The United States fears Islamic fundamentalism without noticing that its lure in the Middle East is gradually diminishing, Zakaria said. The Middle East is awakening to the dangers of “jihad” as Muslims begin to see the futility of violence as a political tool.
“Violence is a lost political argument — Osama bin Laden can instigate terrorism but not get 5000 people out on the streets to demand his ideal Islamic society,” he said.
Along with a greater sense of awareness, the embrace of modernization is at the heart of societal progress in the Middle East, Zakaria said.
He cited Dubai, United Arab Emirates, the booming metropolitan center of the Arabian Gulf, as symbolic of the new Middle East. Along with Dubai’s strong command of commerce, its robust government, global managerial standards, and lack of corruption demonstrate the ability of countries in the Arab world to climb the socioeconomic ladder even as they hold tightly onto their religious and cultural backgrounds. “Dubai is an example of how the Arab world can have diversity and manage it well,” said Zakaria.
“The power of capitalism, trade, and modernity do not negate the forces of religion, but of religious extremity,” said Zakaria, “and the acknowledgment and understanding of this idea is the real solution to the Middle East crisis.”
During an interactive Q&A session, Zakaria also discussed the increasingly competitive relationship between the United States and China, U.S.-Iranian relations, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
On the Israeli-Palestinian clash, Zakaria said that peaceful coexistence can only be achieved when both sides realize that they have much more to gain through cooperating with each other on a political and economic level. “Israel needs to realize that moving forward with Gaza limits its potential, and the Palestinians need to understand the enormous value to them of coexisting with the Israelis,” he said.
However, Zakaria’s resolution of the conflict came across as unrealistic to Yong-Gyun Choi, a sophomore in the College of Humanities and Social Sciences. “The problem here is Mr. Zakaria’s implication that people have not yet realized the value of a liberal market,” said Choi. “The assumption that if both groups were to realize the benefits of a capitalistic market in the Middle East, then they would both stop the war that has been ensuing since the creation of Israel, seemed oversimplified and idealistic.”
“It was interesting to witness a major political analyst debate such ‘hot topics,’ ” said Eduardo Benatuil, a senior economics major. “Lectures like Zakaria’s are very important because they offer not only Carnegie Mellon, but the entire Pittsburgh community, a different outlook on affairs that shape the political future of the United States and the world at large,” he said.
In 1999, Zakaria was named “one of the 21 most important people of the 21st Century” by Esquire magazine, and in 2007, his name was included among the 100 leading public intellectuals in the world by Foreign Policy. With a keen eye toward Middle Eastern affairs, Zakaria has also penned several books, including The Future of Freedom and his recent best seller, The Post American World.

Last Sunday, Oct. 11, students of Carnegie Mellon organized a bus to join the National Equality March in Washington, D.C. The march was performed to raise national awareness of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) civil rights and to demand full and equal protection in all 50 states. Specifically, the goal was to take action in repealing several pieces of national anti-gay legislation, including “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” (DADT), which limits the rights of homosexuals to serve their country in the military, and the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which reserves marital rights to heterosexual couples.
There were also several events in the days leading up to the National Equality March on Sunday. Friday, there were several parties in and around Washington, D.C. in anticipation of the weekend’s events. On Saturday, there was an equality march and other activities for students, which were followed by the main march on Sunday at noon and the rally at about 2 p.m.
The bus from Carnegie Mellon was filled with students from several of Pittsburgh’s campuses, members of several of Pittsburgh’s LGBT organizations, and other advocates from around the city, making a total of about 50 people. Students from Carnegie Mellon held up a banner for the entire march that read “Carnegie Mellon ALLIES. Graduating queers for over 100 years.” The group took a day trip, leaving early in the morning and returning later that evening.
Carnegie Mellon ALLIES, along with student organizations from almost 40 other universities nationwide, helped sponsor and attended the march.
There were over 250,000 other people in Washington, D.C. during the weekend, most of whom were students from all over the world who joined forces to march the streets of Washington from McPherson Square to the Capitol Building. Some of the chants that were heard included: “Hey, Obama, let mama marry mama,” “Gay, straight, black, white. All we want is equal rights,” and “What do we want? Equal rights. When do we want them? Now.” The end of the march was followed by a massive rally in front of the Capitol with 30 different speakers from around the world. Among them were Cleve Jones, Lt. Dan Choi, Judy Shepard, and Lady Gaga.
Merri Ebel, the president of ALLIES, the Carnegie Mellon organization that planned the trip, mentioned that “the newspapers predicted there to be about 50,000 people” at the march and rally. She was very happy to see people from “all sorts of groups come together that were from different states and from different cities and from different backgrounds to rally for the same cause.” Among many other college groups which attended the national event, it was also very uplifting to see “religious groups, a mothers’ group, and a few labor unions,” Ebel said.
There have been several marches in the past; however, a National Equality March in Washington, D.C. of this magnitude has not happened since the term of President Clinton, who implemented DADT while he was in office. During his term as Indiana senator, Obama was supportive of gay rights and even scored high on a test issued by the Human Rights Campaign that measured sponsorship of key issues and rights pertaining to gay and lesbian citizens. More recently, the Matthew Shepard Act, which vows to protect the victims of hate crimes, was passed through Congress this past Thursday. Obama promises to sign the act into law by the end of this month.

A study in New Zealand demonstrated that providing motivational support through daily text messages to young cigarette smokers might help them quit smoking. The New Zealand Ministry of Health provided funding for a charitable trust organization called The Quit Group, which enables the development of innovative cessation programs to help New Zealanders quit smoking. The programs vary using television, radio, print campaigns, and a national telephone quit-line.
The Quit Group deployed STOMP (STop smoking Over Mobile Phone), a program targeted toward 16- to 24-year-olds to help them quit through text messages ranging from advice and support to facts about the health benefits of quitting. A clinical trial involved 1700 participants in which half were sent supporting text messages and the other half were sent generic health messages. Of the group who received motivational texts, 28 percent self-reported that they had quit smoking after 26 weeks. Of the group that received generic texts, only 13 percent said they had quit.
Tina Robinson, a senior directing major, said of the text messages, “I don’t think it would help, because when I smoke, I don’t care about the health risks.” According to studies, the majority of participants who quit did not succeed long-term.
“I know smoking [is] extremely unhealthy for me. I’ve seen the effects of smoking. Personally, I don’t like being reminded of that and I think I would be angry at the text messages. On a good day, I would appreciate them, but on a bad day, they would just make me upset,” said Robinson.
A review of the study showed that 33 percent of participants who reported they had quit at the end of the study had not smoked four weeks after their quit date. When reviewed again after 22 weeks, only 16 percent said they still had not had a cigarette.
Kelley Shell, a health promotion specialist at Student Health Services, said that on average, people attempt to quit smoking seven times before they are successful. “People often minimize the power of the physical addiction,” said Shell. “Nicotine is incredibly addictive. People become addicted physically, mentally, and their behaviors become tied to using tobacco, so the addiction is pretty complex.”
Shell believes that cessation programs that provide support through text messaging can work. “It seems to be a helpful approach because it’s one way to get regular, encouraging messages to individuals who are dealing with nicotine withdrawal symptoms and feelings of wanting to give up.”
A sophomore directing major wants to stop smoking, but cigarettes have become a part of her routine, so she has found it difficult to quit. “I think supportive text messages would help a lot and I would absolutely be interested in a program like that.”
Student Health Services offers many options to help people quit. Smokers can meet with a health promotion specialist who will work with them to determine the best plan of action and meet with them regularly to support them through the quitting process, free of charge. Students, faculty, and staff can purchase nicotine patches and gum at a discounted price. They also offer an 8-week group program for staff members who are quitting. They have not yet created a group for students, but if there is interest, the group may be expanded.
Any member of the campus community interested in quitting smoking can call Student Health Services at (412) 268-2157 to schedule a smoking cessation appointment.

On Oct. 19th, Paula Gutierrez Galindo, a community organizer with the Binational Front of Indigenous Organizations (FIOB), presented “Stories of Mexico’s Displaced” in the McKenna room in the University Center. Her purpose was to try to help listeners understand the reasons why migrants leave their homes, to see the stories behind their journeys, and to learn how they can help. Her tour was sponsored by a group called Witness for Peace Mid-Atlantic, a group dedicated to peace-based initiatives. At the university, the lecture was sponsored by the new global studies major and the Department of Modern Languages.
Galindo grew up in Oaxaca, Mexico, in a family of five children. Over 90 percent of her family has migrated to the United States. When she was a child, she would wait with anticipation along with her siblings for the stories and goods that would return with family members from the United States. The pattern for many workers was to spend six months in the United States and return home for six months. Her older sister and brother migrated, but her brother was forced to return to Mexico to raise his daughter when his wife left. Back in Oaxaca, they are struggling to survive.
“This story is nothing compared to many stories of people who have to migrate to survive,” said Galindo. The only option for countless migrants is to perish from poverty or risk migrating to the United States. Over 50 percent of the immigrants are between 15 and 24 years of age, and Galindo is among the youth “swimming against the stream and trying to stay in Mexico.” Working in her community of Oaxaca, she is able to see firsthand the results of migration, such as loss of indigenous culture, drug use, and the spread of diseases such as AIDS. In one year, the climax, Oaxaca had 250,000 migrants, partly due to the fact that it is one of the three poorest municipalities in the country.
Among other reasons, Galindo explained that people migrate for “employment issues, poverty, search for better living conditions, tradition, and family reunification.” 
“It is not for fun or for pleasure ... it is out of necessity that we migrate,” Galindo said. The economic crisis in Mexico is a primary factor, which was worsened, as shown in Galindo's presentation, by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), originating in 1994.
Traditional farmers in Mexico grow organic produce, which is expensive and takes longer to grow. NAFTA made it possible for cheaper, American subsidized food companies to export products to Mexico. A prime example is the corn industry, one of Mexico’s staple food crops.  Farmers using organic methods can take 17.8 days to produce one ton of corn, but American grain companies can make one ton in less than 1.2 hours. This cheaper, though genetically modified, corn caused damage to Mexico’s industry. Needless to say, the small farmers of Mexico found it almost impossible to compete. A change in Mexico’s constitution around the same time allowed community lands to be privatized, and poor farmers sold their land to earn the almost 10,000 to 15,000 pesos that it can cost to cross the border. Within the country, foreign companies built factories that, though creating job opportunities, paid the equivalent of $10 for eight hours of hard labor.
The mission of Galindo and the two members of Witness for Peace present at the lecture was to inform the audience about this situation and reveal that there are solutions. One member of Witness for Peace, Ben Beachy, mentioned that “there is a bill in Congress that would be the first to renegotiate NAFTA, called the trade pact.” Galindo’s suggestions were direct, as she urged citizens of both countries to become socially and politically involved and work for equal support for the countryside.
Emily Feenstra, a first-year science and humanities student in a seminar on human rights and global politics taught by Silvia Borzutsky, attended the lecture. “I think that Paula’s situation, the percentage of her family that has migrated, and how people [migrant workers] often return for certain months of the year, was really striking,” she said, adding that she spoke to her class about the lecture. “I think it does speak to awareness of different diversities and being open-minded, especially in political situations.”
Galindo’s tour will continue throughout the mid-east United States until the end of the month, when she will return to her mission of helping the immigrants of Oaxaca and earning her master’s degree. Her journey is just one example of those working to help solve the concerns of migration from the perspectives of those on both sides of the border.

How Does the Financing of a University Work?
Monday, Nov. 2, 4:30 p.m.
Gregg Hall (Porter Hall 100)
Deborah Moon will discuss the financial background of a university. She joined Carnegie Mellon University in March of 2001 as the director of finance and administration and CFO at the Carnegie Mellon Research Institute (CMRI). 
In January of 2005, Moon was named vice president of finance and chief financial officer of Carnegie Mellon. Reporting to the president, the CFO is a senior member of the university’s management team with oversight responsibility for finances of the university, from the Oracle financial system and university budgets to international finance.
In 2008, Moon was named CFO of the Year by The Pittsburgh Business Times and received the award in the large nonprofit company category to recognize her accomplishments in supervising the financial records of the university’s seven schools and colleges, her work in managing the requirements and limitations of the school’s research grants — which total nearly $300 million annually — and her contributions to Carnegie Mellon’s international operations, including the opening of a campus in Doha, Qatar — the university’s first international undergraduate campus.

Let me tell you more.
Visualize that I am sitting in a coffee shop, one that is mostly metaphorical. It is getting cold, so I am drinking hot chocolate and wearing a long, dark, and muted olive green coat. With me is a book, Traveling On One Leg, and I am about 30 pages in, but a bit distracted. I pause from reading and look around. I am looking for someone, but not my friend who recommended this book.
This friend, Mr. Engdahl, with whom I frequently disagree, provides uncultured Americans with an assignment every year. He selects an obscure, normally European, and most frequently challenging author, and awards them a Nobel Prize. I gloss over the details: nominations, short lists, his 17 illustrious co-committee members, but the moral remains.
Yet this year would be different. Mr. Engdahl was replaced as the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy by Mr. Englund, and a second-syllable change brings criticisms of the “eurocentricity” of the academy. The academy was berated as a group of Europeans sitting around reading the books of other Europeans. So this autumn, as the leaves begin to litter the ground, we are granted not with an unknown, difficult writer from Europe, but Herta Müller: an unknown, difficult writer from Europe.
Well, I suppose change happens slowly.
Forsaking a more in-depth discussion of the politics of this choice (Mr. Engdahl of course does still sit on the academy), I will tell you my own story. I went to the library, not, as you would have expected, for a coffee, but to find Müller’s books.
Now although I joke that she is not exactly well-known, to most readers, most writers are unknown. Müller has won a number of prizes, some quite large, and not all of them German. And as a semi-well-known-in-literary-circles writer, she has had five of her books translated into English. Sure, this is only five out of more than 20, and most having been published by smaller presses, they will not be easy to find — there seemingly do exist people like me who follow the Nobel Prize in literature and are now out searching for her books.
And yes, the publishing houses are already turning their giant, and slow, and rusting gears. As soon as the prize is announced, they are acquiring rights, and in this case, finding translators, and preparing that golden seal that will grace the cover of each volume: “Winner of the Nobel Prize.” It is these that will be set up in Barnes and Noble, displayed to attract the shrinking subculture of people who read literature that won’t ever make the bestsellers lists, of people who read real, physical, paper and ink books, of people who read.
But I have no need to wait for this; I have access to Carnegie Mellon’s own Hunt Library, which, surprise you as it may, had four of Müller’s books translated into English and waiting for me. And here is my dilemma. Of course, I would like to read all of these books immediately, but what if, by some chance, some unlucky fate, another person at Carnegie Mellon would also like to read Müller’s work? I could not be so greedy as to scoop up all of these books.
The answer I struck upon was to take three of these four, and in the fourth leave a literary love letter. The words of it are lost to the page, but I felt a need to reach out to you, that kindred soul (I will assume there is only one of you). You, that other person, who chose also to follow the advice of the Swedish Academy and reach out to a writer who without a prize would have remained untouched on the shelf.
I have since read Nadirs, originally published as Niederungen, Müller’s first book of short stories. It moves quickly and without wasted emotion, though it is dense and often jumps from event to event without warning. The stories are, with the exception of the title story, very short, each one brutal. Brutal because of a clear truth in her storytelling and brutal because of their descriptive nature.
If the first step is reading, the second step is discourse. I need you, who would pick up the book I left behind, The Land of Green Plums, to meet me in this coffee shop. It is there that we would discuss her work. A meeting for the sake of literary progress. I might say the dream sequences are unnerving and violent and could be swapped for scenes in horror films. You might say you were disgusted by her frequent description of urine and other bodily functions, but that you appreciated the sense of hyperreality they created.
We might move on to a more meta-level discussion, asking if Müller should be a more present member of the American literature scene. You would argue that America needs to be more generally aware of the literature of the entire world, escaping the Anglo-centric domination of the media. We would agree with Pound that reading in English alone is not nearly enough. I would have to admit that it was the challenge of the award that led me to read her, but that I embrace this contest each year.
That is of course the point.
Whether from Mr. Engdahl or Mr. Englund, the Nobel Prize serves as a challenge to me, that once-a-year reminder to go out and read something new. And maybe that is their plan to break the America-locked view of the American reader, to get us out reading and discussing something new, something beyond the horizon of what we would normally read. However, I am still waiting for that literary discussion. My letter has thus far gone unanswered. I am sitting in that coffee shop, pulling my coat a little tighter around my waist, and looking up from my book, scanning the room, looking out the window, waiting.
It has been three weeks, and the book is still sitting on the shelf.

As a sophomore computer science major, I had been looking forward to the completion and opening of the Gates and Hillman Centers since I first visited Carnegie Mellon in high school. When the buildings opened, I was impressed by the amount of work and collaboration space available. The reading room on the ninth floor and the large student lounge on the sixth floor, with its covered patio, proved to be excellent places to focus on my work or just to sit and relax. Spaces like these allowed for interaction with others or for individual work, and it is often hard for undergraduates to find such places on campus.
After growing used to having these resources available, imagine my surprise when I tried to reach the sixth floor one evening and was locked out. While the third, fourth, and fifth floors were still accessible, all other floors were locked to my undergraduate ID card. This restriction is similar to the one that exists in Newell-Simon Hall. The difference in this case, however, is that the Gates and  Hillman Centers is built around the theory of connections. Blocking off floors to a segment of this community achieves the opposite effect.
I understand that professors and graduate students might have a desire to add an extra level of security around their offices and labs. There are areas of this campus to which undergraduate students do not need access, and I do not argue with the locks in, for example, Newell-Simon. If there were only offices on the restricted floors, there would be no problem; however, this is not the case. If the plan all along was to lock the sixth through ninth floors, then there should not be a student lounge on the sixth floor, nor should there be workspaces throughout the building. While professors and graduate students have offices in the buildings, undergraduates must make do with these public spaces. If these are designated faculty or graduate lounges, they should be marked as such, and the Gates and Hillman Centers should not be touted, as it currently is, as an open and revolutionary environment.
These restrictions do not only affect students wishing for a work space away from the library or their cramped dorm rooms. Teaching assistants can no longer hold office hours in much of the Gates Center because undergraduate students are not able to attend. Even if workarounds are in place, such as the ability to have a professor remotely unlock the doors, this is an inconvenience to those students seeking last-minute help on an assignment.
As disturbing as this new restriction is, the fact that it was put into place without any notification to undergraduate students is even more cause for concern. Among the fellow undergraduates with whom I have spoken, those who are aware of these new restrictions found out either from other students or from trying to access the floors and failing. If this change was considered by the administration of the School of Computer Science and deemed necessary, it should have been announced to all members of the university community.
The Gates and Hillman Centers are an exciting addition to our campus. The buildings symbolize the connections among disciplines and within our campus community. It is a sad irony that the administration has chosen to ignore the potential benefits of openness. That the decisions were made without informing the undergraduates violates the spirit of the buildings even more. In the more than two years remaining to me at Carnegie Mellon, I look forward to spending time in the new complex, and I hope I am not limited to only three of its floors simply for being an undergraduate.

Right now, as I’m writing this article, local officials — let’s say, members of the Carnegie Mellon administration — are standing behind me, watching and taking note of every letter, every word, every sentence I type.
Obviously, the above sentence is not true. But if I lived in Britain, this scenario would not be nearly so impossible. Actually, the most absurd thing about this scenario happening in Britain isn’t even that it’s well within the realm of possibility; it’s that I wouldn’t even be at all aware that it was happening while it was going on.
Called the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA), the law gives 474 local governments and 318 agencies in Britain the powers that previously only a select number of law enforcement and security service organizations had, according to a recent New York Times article. This law allows the local governments and agencies to film people with hidden cameras, view communication such as phone call logs and web site traffic, and hire undercover agents.
And while I do understand that in some cases, these added security measures are necessary, the powers that are now allowable under the RIPA are being taken advantage of by what seem to be power hungry local agencies, acting as bullies, high off the new privileges the law gives them. In one case that the Times article mentions, Jenny Patton, a mother of three children, was investigated for three weeks because she was suspected of lying about her address to get her children into a neighboring school.
In the end, Patton was found to be innocent, but not until her telephone records were scrutinized and she and her children were followed covertly by an undercover agent, all without her knowledge of any of these activities.
I have trouble believing that telephone records and an undercover agent were really necessary in Patton’s case. Instead of first questioning Patton when she was under suspicion, locals wasted their valuable time and money following her around for three weeks. Were three weeks really needed for the officials involved to believe that Patton and her children really lived where she said they did?
In addition to the waste of time and money, the case was an invasion of Patton’s privacy, whether it technically was legal or not. Though the law may allow local officials to use undercover operations, it does not mean that these methods need to be the first techniques used, especially in generally harmless cases such as a mother falsifying her address. It’s one thing to covertly follow a suspected dangerous criminal, but completely another to follow a mother of three.
Local officials and agencies need to use common sense first when deciding how to investigate each and every case, instead of immediately jumping to whichever option makes them feel the most important. People’s privacy should be protected whenever possible and not exploited on an official’s or agency’s every whim.
Heather Tomko (htomko@) is Forum editor and seriously hopes that the British government isn’t going to start covertly following her actions because she’s written this article.

Pittsburgh is host to thousands of residents who take full advantage of the city’s services without paying any property taxes back to the city. Instead of tracking them down, the city lauds them as examples of what the city has to offer. These residents are known as college students.
The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review reported last Monday that Mayor Luke Ravenstahl was considering taxing college students 1 percent on their tuition costs, along with several other unconventional taxes. With my opinions on the misguided tax on hospital bills aside, taxing Pittsburgh’s college students is an ingenious concept.
Many Carnegie Mellon undergraduate students live on campus in dorms. They are paying the university to live in these spaces, but the students themselves do not contribute any money to the city in the form of property taxes. Still, they expect to be able to use water and electricity provided by the city and emergency response should they set their building on fire by leaving their popcorn in the microwave for too long.
Consider also the students who foolishly do nothing but homework, avoiding putting themselves in the real world by slinging burgers at McDonald’s or stacking cans at Giant Eagle. If students are not working real jobs, they are not paying income taxes, shirking two outlets for contributing to a city that coddles them like the spoiling mother who lets her son stay with her into his 40s.
Of course, graduate students — along with a sizable portion of the undergraduate population — do live in standard apartments, or they may even lease houses, separating them from the freeloading bums like those taking up space in Doherty Apartments or Mudge House.
This clearly brings to mind a slightly different tax. Rather than a blanket tax on all students’ tuition, the city could tax resident students on their room costs, bringing these inequities at least a little closer to a more fair level.
Of course, that would mean that resident students would have to pay an even higher tax to make up for the number of students who would be contributing to the city under Ravenstahl’s plan — an option that would cause unnecessary uproar due to this newly introduced inequity.
For the unfortunate student working to pay Carnegie Mellon’s nearly $20,000 tuition, every cent counts. The $200 is at least a month of food that student has to forego. Can we get a need-based scholarship on our taxes?
Ravenstahl’s proposition is a good one. Now all it needs is a little refinement to make it more practical.
Douglas McIntyre (drmcinty@) would gladly write Mayor Ravenstahl a check to improve the city.

It takes a strong personality to hold the dissenting view in the room — especially when that room contains Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and a number of other top White House officials. However, reports seem to indicate that Joe Biden is happy to do just this.
Biden’s views on the war, most recently on increasing troop numbers in Afghanistan, have not been in accord with Obama’s or the administration’s opinions. And he has repeatedly challenged the President on his plan to send more Americans to the Middle East. At least, that is what we have heard — who has really seen Biden recently, anyway?
Mr. Vice President, where have you been? Mr. Obama’s face is everywhere we turn: He is speaking at some events and listening at others; he is giving the same smile in every single photo and wishing he was eating breakfast at Pamela’s. But you, Mr. Biden, are nowhere to be found. Your opinions aren’t even being given by you; they are being doled out in official White House statements.
At this point, we are a bit afraid they have you locked in a cage in the basement of the White House, possibly for fear that you will shoot yourself in the foot with one of your outspoken and honest trademark gaffes. But as you haven’t even shot anyone else, and you haven’t even gone quail hunting, so we think this treatment might be a bit unfair.
Maybe you are just hard at work, bouncing from private meeting to private meeting, making everyone rethink their own views as you question their beliefs and plans. We hope this is true and we support this behavior. In the spirit of true journalistic curiosity we want you to continue to be the devil’s advocate in the White House. The administration that runs on change needs a voice questioning every new change (and new non-changed plan) that it proposes.
So continue voicing the minority opinion, Mr. Biden, and if you are not bound and gagged in the White House basement, maybe we will see you around sometime.

On Oct. 19, The New York Times, the newspaper with the largest staff in the United States, announced it will cut 100 newsroom jobs, or about 8 percent of its total newsroom workforce, by the end of 2009. The newspaper giant will offer voluntary buyoffs, but will resort to layoffs if enough staff members do not take this option.
Layoffs have already occurred several times in non-newsroom departments. In the newsroom itself, fewer freelancers are being hired, and the newspaper has “trimmed other expenses,” according to the Times’s own article about the layoffs.
This sort of mass staff layoffs also happened in the spring of 2008, but in that case, other jobs were created — this isn’t the case now. We thought the economy was finally recovering — why are ad revenues continuing to drop?
We have to wonder — what will happen to Times’ journalists who, while not being technically laid off, are just not given stories or other opportunities to research and write? The newspaper and overall media industries are fickle ones for sure, and we’re worried that layoffs of all but essential personnel will squander the creativity and intellectual freedom so essential to the success of a newspaper.
It’s a well-known fact that, in hard economic times, the arts are among the first to suffer. But world news, especially from The New York Times, employs more than hobby writers and storytellers. The individuals that will be laid off or will take buyoff packages are professional researchers and writers. They have honed their craft; as readers, we will be worse off without them.
The New York Times, and runner-up newspapers like The Washington Post, do not currently charge for online subscriptions, although a log-in identification and password is necessary to read a handful of articles on each newspaper’s website. It is quite possible — and, in fact, likely — that the newspapers will start charging for online subscriptions, which have risen while printed subscriptions have dropped as a result of both the economic recession and the digital age in general. But if readers have to pay to read the newspaper online, or put in any extra work at all, will they even remain readers for long, or will we see the newsrooms dwindle further?

Bloggers’ continued efforts to take over the world have been noticed by someone in the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). In their updated “Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising,” the FTC details explicitly how the pre-existing laws on product endorsements affect bloggers.
A portion of the blogosphere is up in arms. They shout that they are losing their freedom, that they are going to get sued and have to pay $10,000 per violation, and that there is no room in their tweets to fit in the required material.
But the examples given in the updated FTC guidelines are completely in line with what we would expect from traditional media sources — disclosures of free products and long-standing financial or material relationships with advertisers and companies. This clarified guideline is not a change to existing law, but exists to clarify to consumers (blog readers) where bias may exist in product endorsements.
These guidelines will also rarely affect the average blogger, but allow for clarity of enforcement that pertains to the blogging collectives.
And as for Twitter, based on the FTC comment notice, it seems that it is being left behind in a legal gray area, hiding somewhere between a blogging service and a communication network. However, again, the refinement of these guidelines focuses on consumer clarity: If you are being supported with a constant stream of free toys, you should let your blog and twitter know.
We aren’t against these updated guidelines; they aren’t outrageous. Blogs need to be fair to consumers, and this update is just another push in the right direction for bloggers to have a few rules they need to follow. But to have the FTC realize there is something worth regulating, the legitimacy of blogs is increased. It is one more signal to traditional media that they are being replaced.

I have a problem. Whenever someone asks me to take on or apply for a position of leadership in an organization, I can’t say no.
And that’s probably how I ended up being the chair of the Student Homecoming Committee. I joined the committee in the summer between my freshman and sophomore years because it sounded interesting. Truthfully, I didn’t know that students were supposed to go to Homecoming events, but I wanted to get more involved on campus, so I figured it would be fun.
The Homecoming events last year went well, and it seemed like we reached our goal of raising more school spirit on campus, but in the back of everyone’s minds we were all still wondering: What are we going to do about next year? The school year went on and we all pushed it to the back of our minds until Heather Andring, who is in charge of overseeing our committee, e-mailed us and asked if anyone would be willing to be committee chair and take charge of student Homecoming. The next thing I knew, I was getting an e-mail from Heather telling me that she had selected me as the 2009 student chair.
So now, after six months of planning, Homecoming is finally here. I truly believe that the committee is accomplishing what it has set out to do. While we couldn’t have the giant white tent on the CFA Lawn again, our events this year are made to embrace Carnegie Mellon and amp up school spirit, recognizing that Homecoming isn’t just for alumni — it’s for students too.
Our days during Spirit Week — Nerd Day, School Spirit Day, and Tartan Pride, just to name a few — and the Kick-Off BBQ are aimed at embracing school spirit. Events such as LMAO and the Halloween Bash are designed to allow students to get a chance to interact with alumni while enjoying student and alumni performances.
Our biggest event, the Highland Games, is bringing back an old Carnegie Mellon (and Scottish!) tradition — you can go check out the old trophy in Alumni House. The Games embrace our school’s Scottish pride while allowing classes to compete with each other in a “Carnegie Mellon” style competition, complete with a Rubix cube competition, kilt race, and Cut pong.
If any of this sounds interesting to you, show up! Even if you think that it doesn’t, show up anyway — you never know what free stuff you might end up winning!
Spirit Week starts Oct. 26 and runs through the 30th. The events begin with the Homecoming BBQ Kick-off at the Fence on Oct. 28, and end on Oct. 31 with the Halloween Bash in Wiegand Gym. Be sure to come and check them out and show your Carnegie Mellon pride.

        We're testing a new look for The Tartan. Let us know what you think!
