Carnegie Mellon University women’s volleyball placed 4th at the 2019 UAA Championships on Saturday.
The Friday quarterfinal game against New York University Bobcats went extremely well. Although the first set began with New York University serving, a service error gave the first point and the next serve to Carnegie Mellon, and the Tartans took hold of the advantage, establishing a two-point lead which they maintained for the subsequent few rallies. 
However, a service error from the Bobcats, followed by a service ace from senior Maia So-Holloway and two consecutive kills from sophomore Vivian Beaudoin widened the margin to 10-4 in favor of Carnegie Mellon University. Though New York University attempted to hold their ground, the Tartans maintained their lead, slowly edging away from the Bobcats. A service ace from first-year Stella Yan and kills from senior Erika Foose and sophomore Erin Westberg put Carnegie Mellon University nine points ahead, at 18-9. A timeout called by New York University seemed to temporarily deter the momentum of the Tartans — enough to see the Bobcats narrow the margin down to five points, but a final push from Carnegie Mellon University that saw six nearly-consecutive points scored, the last thanks to a well-positioned block by senior Sahara Aqui and Beaudoin, gave the Tartans the first set 25-15.
The Carnegie Mellon women started out even stronger in the second set, with a New York University attack error followed by spectacular kills from junior Diana Balta and Aqui, along with a solid block from Beaudoin giving the Tartans a considerable four-point lead right at the top of the set. Again, the Tartans maintained their lead before earning three points consecutively — kills by Westberg and Aqui, plus a New York University attack error — to extend their advantage to 12-5. A timeout requested by the Bobcats appeared, once again, to slow down the Tartans’ progress, but another sequence of three points, two of them kills from Balta and Beaudoin, forced New York University to use their second timeout, again attempting to regain control of the match, now down 16-9. This was done in vain, and the Tartans boldly progressed through the rest of the second set, winning it by the identical score of 25-15.
The third set seemed to start out tougher for the Tartans, with both teams trading points. This would not last, however, and a series of five points scored by the Tartans extended their lead to 8-2. New York University struck back, though, and responded in kind, scoring a near-consecutive six points, narrowing the score to 9-8. Nonetheless, Carnegie Mellon was not to be caught. Capitalizing off of a New York University service error, kills by Aqui and Beaudoin, plus a service ace from So-Holloway and an attack error from the Bobcats, re-extended the Tartans’ lead to 14-8. From there, the Carnegie Mellon team maintained the margin, finishing the set 25-17 and winning the game 3-0.
With an average kill percentage of .259, the Tartans blazed past New York University to take place in the UAA Championship semifinals. The highest individual kill percentage came from Foose, who scored .545, and top scorer was Beaudoin, to whom 10.5 points out of the total 45 were attributed, and who had the second-highest kill percentage of .471.
Carnegie Mellon faced the host, University of Chicago, in the semifinals. The Tartans were ultimately outmatched by the Maroons, who scored an inconceivable 12 service aces in the match, and though senior Kayla Yew picked up 21 digs, moving into second all-time in Carnegie Mellon University history with 2,280 digs, the Tartans lost the game 3-0. 
The third-place match saw Carnegie Mellon University fight valiantly against the Bears from Washington University in St. Louis. Both Yan and Balta totaled three service aces, and Yew collected another 24 digs (53 short of the all-time Carnegie Mellon University leader), but it was ultimately not enough to overcome the Bears, who won the game 3-1.
These results put the overall Carnegie Mellon women’s volleyball record at 22-7. The Tartans will know on Nov. 11 whether they will receive an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament.

In a close game, where the offense was slow but the defense and special teams made up the slack, the Tartans bested the Westminster College Titans by a score of 20-14. 
The game started with back-to-back drives of less than ten yards. Westminster lost six yards on three plays, and the Tartans gained nine on six plays. But the Tartans were able to capitalize on their second drive of the game, going 57 yards on five plays, with 44 of those yards coming on junior Luke Bikulege’s touchdown run. 
After forcing a turnover on downs from the Westminster Titans, the Tartans drove the ball 73 yards down field for another touchdown. Senior Chris Haas rushed for a three-yard touchdown that put the Tartans up 14-0 right at the end of the first quarter. 
The somewhat uneventful second quarter saw the Titans put up only one touchdown, and no points on the scoreboard for the Tartans. The first four drives of the quarter ended in three punts and a missed field goal for the Titans from 36 yards out. Scoring the touchdown with 1:37 left in the second half kept the Titans in the game, finishing the half only a touchdown behind for a score of 14-7 Tartans. 
Westminster received the kickoff at the start of the second half, and they took advantage of their position. A six-play, 60-yard drive for the Titans tied the game up at 14 just two minutes into the second half. In response, the Tartans slowed their game down, taking 5:30 to go just 39 yards on 10 plays, but the end of the drive saw the Tartans put up a field goal attempt from 38 yards out. Sophomore kicker Brandon Nguyen made the score 17-14 for the Tartans.
On the next drive, the Tartans forced a three-and-out for Westminster, but a fumble on the resulting punt left Westminster within striking distance of the Tartan red zone. A 17-yard pass put the Titans at the Tartan 25-yard line with a fresh set of downs, but a penalty and two sacks by Long Tran, Michael Lohmeier, and Sam Brod pushed Westminster all the way back to their own 48-yard line. The second sack saw the Titan quarterback lose the ball, but the fumble was recovered for the Titans to punt away on the next play. Another series of punts ended the fourth quarter.
Early in the fourth quarter, the Tartans stretched the lead a little more after a 28-yard drive ending in a 41-yard field goal from Nguyen. Another three and out following the field goal forced the Titans to punt away to the Tartans, who kept possession for close to four minutes on seven plays and 32 yards.
The next Westminster drive ended in an interception by senior Thomas Polutchko after only five plays, putting the ball at midfield for the Tartans with just a minute and a half left in the game. However, the Tartans only wasted fifty seconds from the clock returning possession to Westminster with 44 seconds left in the game. Starting at their 17-yard line, Westminster was only able to gain 23 yards on the final drive of the game. The final score was 20-14 for the Tartans.
The win keeps the Tartans in second place in the PAC, but Case Western Reserve University won their game on Saturday sealing their first-place position. The Tartans have an opportunity to ruin Case Western’s perfect record next weekend in the 34th Academic Bowl, which will be played at Gesling Stadium. The game begins at 2:00 p.m.

This is Penalty Shouts, The Tartan’s sports column inspired by the The New Yorker’s column Daily Shouts. This satire-fueled column will focus on anything and everything funny in the sports world that is deserving of our comedic attention.
The 2-8 Golden State Warriors (that’s comedy) put out a lineup last week that shocked and appalled the masses. Perpetual G-Leaguer Willie Cauley-Stein, Sixth Man of the Year Marquese Chris, and Most Improved Player Kid from Street Ball joined my left nut on the court for the Warriors against the Thunder last Saturday. 
To quickly catalog the Warriors injuries so far this season, Klay Thompson died in the playoffs last year. He’s unlikely to come back this year, but the Grim Reaper, taking the shape of Derrick Rose, promised Thomspon’s return saying “He’s mine! He’s mine!” Unfortunately, Thompson may return as a shell of his former self. 
Bruised but not broken, Draymond Green has taken one for the team. After all, it’s hard to take such a bad hit to your ego when your team asks you to tank for a better draft pick. Regarding the injury to his “finger,” Green said, “I’ll kick you in your...” Unfortunately, the hit to his ego was too much to finish the sentence, and he began to remember better days: the 2016 Western Conference Finals against Oklahoma City.
Broken but not bruised, Steph Curry is still the man. It sucks his hand is injured, but he should also let up with all the shots next time. I mean, the man is letting it fly every day. He probably even does it like three times a day, which is crazy if you ask me. I never shoot alone, but Curry seems like the type of guy to do it a lot, even though he has a wife who would willingly shoot with him. 
Then, there’s Kevon Looney, and no, before you ask, he’s not like the bird from Up. Looney was probably the last semblance of a real starter that the Warriors had on their team from last year, and his injury was the nail in the coffin for the Warriors for a few weeks. However, the Warriors are a lot like Uma Thurman in Kill Bill, where she one-inch punches her way out of a coffin. What I’m trying to say is that Kevon Looney is going to be that one-inch punch, and he’s going to single-handedly destroy the entirety of the NBA for posterity’s sake. He doesn’t particularly care about anything or anyone. He’s just a bloodthirsty maniac. 
Other injuries to the Warriors team include the sprained ankle of Serbian lightning bolt Alen Smailigic and the day-to-day bumps and bruises of Omari Spellman and Eric Paschall. Just get good, guys.
Next week, the lineup for the Warriors could look even worse. Maybe they won’t even put a team on the court at some point. Who knows what’s going to happen? Not me, except for one thing I do know. Big Bird would be pretty good at basketball, and the Warriors should sign him (n.b. Big Bird is 8'2'').

The human brain has long been considered a mess of biological signals that humans have no hope of untangling. However, a study published in the Oct. 29 issue of Cerebral Cortex by the Carnegie Mellon psychology department indicates that the human brain’s representation of abstract concepts is not only identifiable, but also shared.
The study was one of several by the Center for Cognitive Brain Imaging (CCBI). It used machine learning to analyze the functional magnetic resonance image (fMRI) scans of nine individuals while they were instructed to think about 28 abstract concepts, such as subtraction, causality, ethics, gravity and gossip. While past studies by CCBI have tended to focus on concrete concepts, the researchers’ refinements have allowed them to conclude that abstract concepts are also identifiable across participants.
“When fMRI came about, first people just studied where the activation was in the brain while you were doing something.… The big breakthrough occurred in some work done at Carnegie Mellon with my colleague Tom Mitchell in the machine learning [department], where we found not only where the hotspots are, but… what the hotspots were coding. So we found out how the concept of ‘apple’ was represented. Once we had that, the sky was the limit,” said Marcel Just in an interview with The Tartan. Just is the senior author of the study, professor of Psychology at the Dietrich College of Humanities of Social Sciences, and the director of CCBI. “The goal is to develop an ontology of human knowledge that is neurally based,” Just said. “It’s not just a big mess. It’s in there systematically as it is in a library. Only we know the library’s indexing system: you just have to go to the card catalogs. So the goal is to learn the brain’s card catalog… Each of our studies gives us another drawer in the card catalog, and this study tells us how abstract concepts are organized.”
“We want to know how the brain works, how knowledge is represented. We think we’re at the point now where we can start to identify knowledge representations from the conceptual level … the next stage is combinatorics: can we see how conceptual representations are combined while solving problems,” said Robert Mason, a senior research psychologist at CCBI who has worked with Just on related studies.
The researchers used Gaussian Naïve Bayes, a conventional machine learning algorithm for classification, to compare the MRI scans of each individual. Each individual was told to think about each of the 28 concepts on six separate occasions. Four of the six scans were used to train the classifier algorithm, while the average of the other two was used to test its validity. The same procedure was used across participants, using eight of the nine to train the algorithm, and the ninth to test accuracy. The process was repeated with different combinations of scans in the training set in order to confirm the accuracy of the algorithm.
Traditionally, machine learning requires inordinately large data sets. The study only used nine participants, each of which had six rounds of scans. The way the researchers got around this was essentially by using each pixel of the MRI scan as a classifier and ranking all the pixels based on how strong a correlation they had to the result, then picking the most correlated ones as features of the algorithm.
There are many potential uses for this use of fMRI technology, ranging from education to therapy. Just explained, “Psychiatry is the study of the disorder of thought, and here we are claiming we can measure thoughts. Well, if we can measure thoughts, we can measure the disorder of thoughts. So we have a large ongoing project where we identify people who have been thinking about suicide by looking at their neural representation of certain concepts and seeing if they are different from controls. So we can identify whether someone is suicidal or not with 91 percent accuracy.”
“We really think it’s possible to use these fMRI images as an assessment tool,” Mason added. “So, for example, we can see how velocity is represented at the beginning and end of the semester. We can compare those images to students who got A’s, or to professors, and we can see if the brain images are similar to the experts. But the real place that it could have some type of impact, years from now, is for assessing learning readiness and tutoring. So if we have a student who is struggling, maybe we can identify where their knowledge base is failing.”
Currently, Mason is working on a study with nearly identical tactics to Just’s but focused on physics concepts, attempting to test the validity of the educational approach. According to Mason, the study will compare scans of students in first-year physics from the beginning to the end of the semester “to see if there is a change in the representations that is indicative of learning.”
Another study is in progress with a similar scope as Mason’s, except that the participants are physics professors, and the words include advanced physics concepts that are almost impossible to conceptualize concretely.

Scientists have long feared that water scarcity would become a global crisis in the coming decades. According to new research from Dartmouth University, climate change will intensify this issue: in the future, plants will consume more water than they do currently, resulting in less available water for residents of North America, Europe, and Asia.
The study, published in Nature Geoscience, contradicts prior work that suggested climate change will lead to a wetter world. The previous thinking was that, as carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere increase, plants’ water consumption would decrease, thus leaving more freshwater available. Since plants require carbon dioxide for photosynthesis, higher quantities of the gas in the air allow plants to photosynthesize at the same rate while closing the pores on their leaves. Water escapes through these pores, called stomata. However, the Dartmouth study finds that this theory only applies to the tropics and very high latitudes, whereas plants' response to climate change in moderate climates will make the land drier.
"Approximately 60 percent of the global water flux from the land to the atmosphere goes through plants, called transpiration," said lead author Justin S. Mankin, an assistant professor of geography at Dartmouth and adjunct research scientist at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, in a press release. "Plants are like the atmosphere's straw, dominating how water flows from the land to the atmosphere. So vegetation is a massive determinant of what water is left on land for people. The question we're asking here is, how do the combined effects of carbon dioxide and warming change the size of that straw?"
The research team used a technique developed by Mankin and his colleagues to compute future runoff loss to vegetation in a warmer climate of the future, taking into account how precipitation is partitioned among plants, rivers, and soils. The study reveals how three effects of climate change will reduce water availability. As carbon dioxide concentration increases, plants require less water to photosynthesize, but growing seasons will lengthen and get warmer, combining to dry land over time. Therefore, plants will likely grow more as photosynthesis is amplified year-round. For the mid-latitude regions of the planet, which include North America and Eurasia, plants will leave less water in soils and streams, regardless of additional rainfall.
Humans are dependent on freshwater for agriculture, electricity generation, and manufacturing. In areas where precipitation is limited to certain parts of the year, such as California, technology is used to balance water consumption. 
"Throughout the world, we engineer solutions to move water from point A to point B to overcome this spatiotemporal disconnect between water supply and its demand. Allocating water is politically contentious, capital-intensive, and requires really long-term planning, all of which affect some of the most vulnerable populations. Our research shows that we can't expect plants to be a universal panacea for future water availability. So, being able to assess clearly where and why we should anticipate water availability changes to occur in the future is crucial to ensuring that we can be prepared," Mankin said in a Dartmouth press release.

A new type of micromotor has been developed. Directed by magnets and powered by ultrasound, these micromotors are capable of traveling across microscopic particles and cells in very crowded areas without causing any damage.
“These microswimmers provide a new way to manipulate single particles with precise control and in three dimensions, without having to do special sample preparation, labeling, surface modification,” said Joseph Wang, a professor of nanoengineering at University of California San Diego (USCD), in a UCSD press release.
Wang, Thomas Mallouk, a professor of chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania, and Wei Wang, professor of materials science and engineering at Harbin Institute of Technology, are credited as senior authors of a paper detailing the development of these micromotors. The study was published on Oct. 25 in Science Advances. 
Researchers tested the technology by moving HeLa cells — the oldest and most commonly used cell line for scientific research — and silica particles in aqueous media with micromotors. They accomplished this task without damaging nearby particles and cells. In one test, the researchers were able to create letters by pushing particles with the micromotors. In another, they exerted control over the micromotors, making them climb up microscopic blocks and stairs. This test demonstrated that they were capable of navigating over three-dimensional objects.
The micromotors are essentially gold-coated hollow polymer structures that are shaped like a half capsule. Within the body of the micromotor is a tiny magnetic nickel nanoparticle, allowing them to be steered with magnets. The inside surface is treated so it can repel water, so when the micromotor is submerged in water, an air bubble is trapped inside the device. This trapped bubble is integral to the functioning of the micromotor, as it allows the micromotor to respond to ultrasound. Upon receiving ultrasound waves, the trapped bubble begins to oscillate, forming forces that give it an initial push to movement. By applying an external magnetic field, it can move continuously, while altering the direction of the field allows researchers to control the speed and trajectory of the micromotors.
“We have a lot of control over the motion, unlike a chemically fueled micromotor that relies on random motion to reach its target,” said Fernando Soto, a nanoengineering Ph.D. student studying at UC San Diego. “Also, ultrasound and magnets are biocompatible, making this micromotor system attractive for use in biological applications.”
The authors plan on making improvements to the micromotors in the coming years. For example, they want to make them more biocompatible using biodegradable polymers and a magnetic material that is less toxic, such as iron oxide. Thanks to this technology, the researchers have opened new possibilities for nanomedicine, tissue engineering, targeted drug delivery, regenerative medicine, and other applications in the field of biochemistry.

Row House Cinema, bougie on the outside yet small and quaint on the inside, displays a fresh set of movies based on new themes each week. Last week’s topic featured classic samurai films, while this week explored Italian cinema. Exploring a wide array of cinematic genres from several cultures each week, Row House Cinema exposes fervent movie-goers to a variety of distinctive and enlightening cinema each time they walk into the theatre.
This week’s line-up included the movies The Good, The Bad and the Ugly, Rome, Open City, and Cinema Paradiso. For my dose of Italian cinema, I decided to watch the classic 1961 film La Dolce Vita, directed by Federico Fellini. Fellini’s film follows the hedonistic pursuits of a gossip columnist named Marcello Rubini who, in his carefree journeys throughout the city of Rome, reveals seemingly endless drama and unravels an increasingly complicated plot that encapsulates the audience into the remarkable story.
Upon entering Row House, I took a short walk across the hallway that led to the open doors of the theater, a small room that felt like a box. The audience sandwiched themselves between blue-gray walls and a wide movie screen. The entire feel of the cinema screamed vintage and the free delicious cappuccinos on the way in along with the movie booming in its original Italian language with thin English subtitles displayed below only reinforced that feeling. Witnessing the spectacle of each scene, I found that the cultural normalities and societal expectations that reinforce certain standards of beauty of the time were reflected heavily in the visuals of these scenes, and in the construction of intriguing and charming characters. The cinematography was gorgeous, and the coziness of the pitch black, boxed auditorium made the experience all the more enjoyable. Films document time, a time that maintains itself for as long as the film exists and brings individuals from a modern societal perspective into the cultural frame of mind that the movie presents.
Next week, Row House Cinema is doing a marathon of the Fast and Furious movies featuring authentic Brazilian street food.

Last Wednesday, the Canadian chef and television personality Antoni Porowski visited Carnegie Mellon University to give a short talk along with a cooking demo. He gave a short self-introduction, then was greeted by a Q&A session where he unpacked his personal and emotional experiences with his career in cooking.
From the moment he walked on stage and introduced himself, I realized that he was well-acquainted with sharing his experiences with large crowds. Every bit of his talk felt sincere, and we as an audience felt every ounce of it. The talk was personal, as was his culinary memoir which was developed after the end of a long relationship. Porowski said writing the memoir helped better sort his feelings out. As a result, this memoir was much more a recollection of his most important memories with food than a simple recipe book.
When asked about his most memorable recipe, Porowski began to describe the turkey meatloaf he made on Sundays with his family. From his delighted expression, it was obvious that this comfort food was a key piece in making his relationships meaningful. Some of his most rewarding experiences have been cooking for his friends and family members, said Porowski.
However, Porowski didn’t initially aspire to pursue a career in cooking, much less star in a television show. After graduating from college with a degree in psychology, he worked in different restaurants across multiple cities. Porowski cites working as a waiter as the most important among his work experiences as it forced him to multitask. He also garnered important experience meeting and dealing with different people. Still, his development into the Antoni Porowski we know wouldn’t enter the scene until he started working as a personal assistant for Ted Allen. Allen worked in the earlier iterations of Queer Eye, and eventually provided a stepping stone for Porowski to later join the show.
Porowski’s transition into fame through Queer Eye was bumpy, and he says it still doesn’t feel natural to him. Porowski felt imposter syndrome regarding his sexuality, which he had only discovered later in his life. He is still overcoming these issues, and the show’s hectic schedule has forced him to learn to take better care of himself. At one point during the filming of the show, he had to spend almost every day in different cities with long flights in between. He learned to always get at least eight hours of sleep every day without fail. Porowski added that, even with his good practices, he is still finding other ways to improve his lifestyle.
Antoni also spoke on his respect for those who dedicate their lives to cooking through means such as culinary schools. Coming out of university, he never would have thought of how invested he’d become in cooking. He advises that one’s life has a way of eventually happening the way it should, even if it feels like a disaster.
Overall, this talk was an excellent opportunity to learn about Porowski. Even though I walked into this talk unfamiliar with his personal life and career, at the end of it I left with a greater understanding of him and his work.

Beetlejuice the musical opened on Broadway back in April of 2019 and has since gained significant popularity for its bold comedy, flashy tricks, and sincere messages. When I saw it, I was blown away by the amount of effort put into the design and implementation of the show. It was by far one of the most technically impressive theatrical works I have seen.
Based on the 1988 Tim Burton film, Beetlejuice is spectacularly constructed by scenic designer David Korins to reflect the aesthetic of its source, with several key scenic features undeniably Burton-esque. Many easter eggs are also sprinkled throughout the show, ranging from paintings on the walls to tiny details in the set of the attic. With the design of the house fluidly changing to reflect its owners, along with automation to facilitate smooth transitions, the sum of this is, in my eyes, most certainly a piece of technical ingenuity.
The use of puppetry, courtesy of puppet designer Michael Curry (whose previous experience includes co-designing puppetry for Broadway’s The Lion King), was definitely something to marvel at. The most impressive of these puppets was, without question, the giant sandworm — dubbed “Big Sandy” by the cast — that Beetlejuice (Alex Brightman) himself eventually rides. The choices made regarding the way the puppet was constructed and they way it moves make it come to life on stage, and I would consider its entrance as one of the highlights of the show.
The lighting of the set was also a marvelous piece of creativity. Lighting designer Kenneth Posner does well to portray the exact mood of every scene with variations in brightness and color, with the entire set lit in a way that seems supernatural. Even the house lights of the theater were gelled ghoulish shades of green and purple, with the spotlights meandering across the house in a pre-show display of otherworldliness to thoroughly submerge the audience into the world of Beetlejuice.
The play also includes a fair amount of magic and illusion. Michael Weber embraces aspects of sleight-of-hand and misdirection — with the help of lighting and stage design — to make actors seemingly appear out of nowhere, props to vanish, and Lydia (Sophia Anne Caruso) to levitate without wires. Its cleverness adds to the overall witty feeling of the show, and really helps to give it a unique sort of personality and charisma.
Even the vocals of Alex Brightman, who plays the titular character, have a special element. Using a technique known as ventricular fold phonation, Brightman utilizes his ventricular folds, or false vocal folds, to produce the signature gravely voice for his bio-exorcist ghost character. He also seamlessly transitions between this voice and a gentler voice to sing sarcastic comforts to his audience.
A large part of the comedic wit of Beetlejuice involves its self-awareness and the inclusion of the audience. Beetlejuice’s quips (including, but not limited to, pointing at a member of the audience and saying, “This guy knows what I’m talking about”) along with satirical comments about social issues and elements of the show itself created a sense of inclusiveness for the viewers. This brings aspects of fantasy from the show into the real world, thereby reducing the suspension of reality required for total immersion in the events unfolding onstage.
Beetlejuice represents the pinnacle of blending magical and comedic elements, complete with fourth wall-breaking. Even relatively simple contraptions such as trapdoors are incorporated into the show in unexpected ways that perfectly play into the degree of comedic absurdity it emanates. It is this well-orchestrated balance of contrasts and complements that make it so novel.
Ultimately, Beetlejuice is a very fun show and is, in my opinion, deserving of more accolades than it has received, especially in the technical realm. There is something truly special about this show, and it is certainly something to be beheld: a must-watch.

A box of Junior Mints. A black and white cookie. A stack of Risk! cards. For a Seinfeld fan, these seemingly innocuous images will instantly call to mind iconic moments from the show, like Kramer accidentally dropping a mint into a surgery patient or Jerry explaining the key to eating a black and white cookie to Elaine. And that’s exactly the goal of Baxter & The Bear’s alternate movie posters.
Started by Pittsburgh native Dan Grguras back in 2015, Baxter & The Bear sells artsy movie posters on Etsy in two distinctive styles: minimalist photographs depicting iconic items relating to central themes of the movie, or colorful illustrations, some of which act as fake travel ads for places like the Parks and Recreation town Pawnee or the Black Panther nation of Wakanda.
Grguras usually takes a couple of hours to decide on the composition of the image, arranging the items on a white board before shooting everything in natural sunlight. “It can take weeks trying to figure out a way to make the props match,” he said in an interview with The Tartan. Once he has the items each photography poster takes around four hours to complete. His illustrations, such as one displaying the costumes used in Wes Anderson’s films, can take north of 40 hours to finish, since he has to work in a large amount of elements. 
Grguras, 34, majored in film studies at the University of Pittsburgh and is “self taught in everything,” starting off using his phone’s camera before transitioning to a real camera, while “just figuring out Adobe Illustrator” in order to craft the illustrated prints. 
Grguras had already been selling Pittsburgh and travel photography on Etsy when he was inspired by the alternative movie posters created by a company called Mondo for the movie theater chain Alamo Drafthouse. “I figured I could give it a shot,” Grguras recalled, and so he created his first poster for the Martin-Scorsese flick The King of Comedy. 
He started small, creating about 10 posters in his first year, but after landing a vendor spot at one of Pittsburgh’s pop-up marketplaces, Baxter & The Bear began to grow. “I started to see people interact with them, and it’s fun to get out there and sell them,” explained Grguras. “You meet people, you talk to people, and that increased my interest greatly.” 
He designed over 25 new posters this year alone.
The process can often be long and grueling. Inspiration typically comes from seeing a movie, and then trying to figure out how to creatively represent that movie through just a few objects. He tries to avoid making it blatantly obvious. “I’m trying to figure out a way to do Fight Club, but do I just do the pink soap and call it a day?” 
Grguras is willing to get obscure with his references, as long as it “represents a real idea from the movie” or is “something that’s a really strong piece of the character.” Most of the work comes from trying to figure out what belongs in the poster, but sometimes things will reveal themselves. “I happened to own the same box cutter that they used in Breaking Bad,” which prompted Grguras to create a poster for the show.   
Typically, he has to search far and wide to find the right objects, and Grguras is incredibly specific about what he uses in the posters. “If its a piece of technology, I try to find the exact model number to match it to what was used in the movie,” he explained, with the alarm clock in his Groundhog Day poster and the Walkman in his Guardians of the Galaxy poster matching the exact ones found in the movies. 
The process of finding the exact right items can take ages. It took him two years to find the perfect Huggies diaper packaging for his Raising Arizona poster and a year and a half of checking eBay to find the correct design of Barbasol can for Jurassic Park. 
Sometimes Grguras is forced to create what he needs to best represent a film or idea. “If I can’t find what I’m looking for I’ll make it,” he said. For example, he had to create his own Burn Book for Mean Girls. While he uses Photoshop to process the photos and occasionally creates composite images, “I try to do all the trickery through making it rather than Photoshopping it,” he said. 
In terms of how he chooses which movies or TV shows to do, Grguras said that the ones “that I really love are going to be the most successful” because “if you’re going to show up with something, it has to have something behind it or else it will just get lost in a sea of stuff.” However, “if there’s one that people ask for enough and it’s one that I can appreciate, I can do it.” While he wasn’t a huge fan of Forrest Gump or Avengers: Endgame, he could appreciate how much other people loved the films, so he created posters for each of them. 
But he will always return to his personal favorites. “*The King of Comedy* doesn’t necessarily set the world on fire on Etsy or anything,” but it still ranks as one of Grguras’ favorite posters so far. “Some of these are just for me, and that’s okay too.”

If you missed AcaPittsburgh this past Friday night, prepare to have some serious FOMO.
AcaPittsburgh brings together several different a capella groups from across Carnegie Mellon University for a yearly benefit concert. This year, all ticket proceeds went to SisTersPGH, a trans-led organization that provides resources and emergency transitioning shelter for transgender people in Pittsburgh. I purchased my ticket at the door, arriving about 10 minutes early to a half-filled McConomy Auditorium. By the time the show began, there was hardly an empty seat in sight, and the auditorium was buzzing with anticipation. I soon heard why.
Emcees Bryant Chung and Kevin Shin, members of the C-sharp Singers, kicked off the evening. They introduced each group throughout the night and kept us entertained with their witty puns. (Why do pirates like a capella? They like the high C’s. Hardy har har!)
The first group and host of the evening was Counterpoint, Carnegie Mellon University’s first all-female a capella group. They walked out on stage in an array of coordinating neutral-toned outfits (spoiler alert: matching outfits was a big theme of the show). The girls formed a semi-circle, and a soloist stepped forward. They sang Amy Winehouse’s “Back to Black.” As the soloist sang the melody with confident, heartfelt vocals, the rest of the group provided a simultaneously harmonic and rhythmic accompaniment, with one girl laying a steady beat for everyone to follow.
Each group that performed typically followed a pattern: one, or sometimes multiple soloists carried the melody while the rest of the ensemble provided a combination of harmony and rhythm, and one or two beatboxed. While following this standard a capella recipe, each group brought their own unique sound and flair to each song. The most uniting common factor however, was an infectious passion and enthusiasm for their performances. Even if I did not care for a specific song, each group’s passion for performing and distinctive style kept me hooked throughout the night.
The night also featured the All-Nighters, an all-male group visiting from Johns Hopkins University. Their first featured song was “Broke” by Samm Henshaw, which starts with him singing about losing his job at Five Guys. I would probably change this song if it came on the radio, but their quirky delivery had me listening and laughing along with the silly lyrics. Not to mention their coordinated ensemble of dark vests, colored ties, and white sneakers was very nerdy cute. Their second featured song was a Jonas Brothers medley, and when they transitioned into “Burnin’ Up,” the crowd simply lost their minds. And let’s face it, we can’t deny that the iconic band brings out the middle school fangirl in all of us.
A few of my personal favorites included the rendition of “Over the Rainbow,” covered by the C-Sharp Singers, a co-ed group in complementary red and black outfits. Their deliberate use of harmony made it incredibly, almost painfully beautiful. I was also very impressed by the second soloist featured in The Originals, an all-male group that strives to deliver “intentional and emotionally aware performances.” Trey Caperton has some serious pipes, and I can see why this group reached the finals in the ICCA New York competition.
I was most impressed by the diversity of the performances and the enthusiasm of this event. Some groups were all-female, some all-male, a few groups were made entirely of people of color who brought specific aspects of their culture into their performances. As a classically trained musician, I was happy to find that the D-flat Singers, Carnegie Mellon University’s All-University Choir, was included to provide a traditional a capella choir performance. Each group received roars of applause from the audience, not shying from yelling shout-outs to their friends on stage.
It was an engaging evening showcasing the great community support and awe-inspiring music we have here at Carnegie Mellon. If you missed hearing these talented groups, I wouldn’t hesitate to catch them on campus soon.

The Frame Gallery opened its A Walk in the Woods in Mid October … Our Father was a Bear in his Last Life showing on Friday, Nov. 8. The gallery was filled with work by Sam, Isabel, and Matt Horgan, a family who told their story of hunting in Western Pennsylvania through a short film, sculptures, and paintings. Upon entering the gallery, I took a slip of paper from the front desk that outlined every section of the room.
In area one, titled “Deerhunting,” the pamphlet explained that I would find “assorted taxidermy and deer skulls...photographic prints...and a deerskull chandelier.” The miniature treestands along with a picture of the treestands and a life-sized display of one example all seemed to aid in the exhibition’s desire to submerge their audience in this green-tinted world of hunting. Next to the picture of the treestands were five portraits of deer skulls painted on green backgrounds. Each skull was unique and seen from a different vantage point. However, they all seemed to have one haunting thing in common: the space where eyes would have been seemed to reach out from the canvas and into the space of the audience.
The second area, “CUT,” was located in a room upstairs. The room had one chair and a projector played a video by Isabel Horgan. Several clips had been edited together, “Dad is in the Field,” “Baby Sheep’s First Trim,” and “A short video of a 3 Legged Coyote.” As I took a seat to watch the baby sheep get its first trim, I found myself captivated by the beautiful red house in the background. The structure, resembling a barn, seemed to situate me further into the world of hunting in Western Pennsylvania. Built among many trees and overgrown grass, the house’s red tint stuck out from the neutral-toned greens and browns of the exhibit. The home stood apart from the freeform nature around it.
“Assembled artifacts,” the third section of the exhibit, featured several “found objects,” each of which contained a secret inside. The birdhouse contained a nest and a single off-white egg, and at the base of the treehouse were three found objects, each inviting audience members to peer inside and see the curiosities awaiting them. Each object was assembled by Matt Horgan, who saw these objects as “reflections of different expressions of folk life in Western Pennsylvania.” Even though the green-tinted world of hunting in Western Pennsylvania can seem monotonous and uniform, Matt wants to remind us that the hunting life has its own complexities and nuances.
The fourth area, “Our Father was a Bear in his Last Life,” tells the visual story of an oral tradition that the Horgans’ father continued. “Mythmaking and folktales...are still prevalent modes of storytelling in rural Western Pennsylvania.” In addition to their family traditions of hunting, these stories that they grew up with could have only added to the feeling that who they were and what they did was all tied into nature and hunting. These folktales could only solidify their relationship with the nature around them.
On the wall of the fifth area, “Sheep Farming and Chickens,” hung Isabel Hogan’s handspun wool from her recent 28-hour durational performance. Two bundles of brown wool hung on top of each other, looking soft but sturdy. In her 28-hour performance, the work that she put into creating something beautiful where there was once just trimmings mirrored the respect she had shown for the sheep she had trimmed during “CUT.”
The sixth and final part of the gallery was “The Reading Corner.” In this section, the audience was greeted by the numerous books that Sam and Isabel had been surrounded by as children. The section finished with a fish painted by Matt, Mahoning Creek as painted by Isabel, and a deer skull painted by Sam. From a short film to a deer skull chandelier, the gallery had managed to take us full circle back to the paintings that we had started out with in area one. Much like the hunting life itself, A Walk in the Woods in Mid October … Our Father was a Bear in his Last Life was also cyclical.

On Friday, Carnegie Mellon celebrated the tenth anniversary of Traffic21, a university sponsored research institute dedicated to creating technology improving transportation infrastructure, traffic issues, and accessibility in Allegheny County and beyond.
To kick off the two-day symposium, an invitation-only lunch event featured remarks from County Executive Rich Fitzgerald, Congressman Mike Doyle, Mayor Bill Peduto, and Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao, the event’s keynote speaker.
Traffic21 has worked on multiple initiatives in the Allegheny County region, such as the development of an app that provides real-time information about Port Authority buses, an app for the airport, and one for landslide detection in Western Pennsylvania. The research institute has spun off three companies, including RapidFlow Technologies.
All the speakers lauded Carnegie Mellon for the initiative. In his remarks, Congressman Doyle said that “the work that has been done here at CMU and Traffic21 has benefited our local residents, helped grow our economy, and kept our region globally competitive,” which he attributes to the partnership between “government, academia, and the private sector.” Carnegie Mellon President Farnam Jahanian also noted that Traffic21 has helped bring hundreds of technology jobs to the area, and millions of dollars in private investment.
Rick Stafford, the founder of Traffic21 and Metro21, discussed the future of Traffic21 with David Roger, the president of Hillman Family Foundation, and Al Biehler, the executive director of the University Transportation Center.
In this panel, they focused on the issues of urban design, including transportation access and barriers for low income citizens, the future of autonomous vehicles, and smart city technology to increase equity. In addition, they talked about Traffic21 being at the forefront of determining the direction of technology policy.
Secretary Chao’s remarks focused on increasing mobility for citizens with disabilities and stressed the potential of autonomous vehicles, including assisted driving features and the use of drones. She also announced an $8.4 million grant to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and Carnegie Mellon to continue research into transportation technologies.
Secretary Chao’s invitation drew protests from people concerned with her ethics and allegations of corruption. Earlier in June, Politico reported  that Secretary Chao had created a special liaison to facilitate grants for at least $78 million worth of projects to the state of Kentucky, where Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, her husband, is up for re-election. 25 percent of her meetings from January 2017 to March 2018 were with representatives from Kentucky, whose citizens, Politico notes, make up just 1.3 percent of the U.S. population.
Zachary Clein, a second-year dramatic writing graduate student, organized the protest. He said “Secretary Chao is the epitome of a corrupt politician. She is not here to promote technology and innovation for the good of the whole public, but more for corporate interest.”
Clein’s co-organizer, Joseph Heffner, a former graduate student at Carnegie Mellon, reiterated his sentiments and added “through the speakers [Carnegie Mellon] allows on campus, they are making a statement that the door is open to corporate interests.”
A media representative of the university gave a statement saying, “Carnegie Mellon University values the freedoms of speech, thought, expression and assembly as part of our core educational and intellectual mission. The university supports both the rights of the students who wish to protest and those who plan to attend Secretary Chao’s talk on the importance of innovating mobility during the Traffic21 Institute 10th Anniversary Symposium. We have worked with event organizers to allow for freedom of expression, engagement and exchange of ideas.”
When asked about the protests after his Thursday town hall, Jahanian said that departments and student organizations should have the ability to invite speakers to campus, and that “we have a policy of respect for essentially freedom of speech. As long as it’s not inciting violence, we will accommodate essentially people coming to express their opinions.”  
He also reinforced the commitment to protecting the speech of the protesters, saying the university would “take their concerns into consideration and hopefully be able to explain also our position in terms of how we run the university and how we want to support their intellectual freedom as well as their freedom of speech.”

Highmark Health, the not-for-profit Pittsburgh-based insurer and healthcare provider, has gifted Carnegie Mellon University $35 million toward establishing a new health, wellness, and athletics facility on campus. Current university estimates have the proposed 160,000 square foot facility opening up in 2024.
The new building will expand upon the existing Skibo Gymnasium on the corner of Frew Street and Tech Street. It will include new space for Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS), University Health Services (UHS), and Carnegie Mellon’s intercollegiate athletics program.
Gina Casalegno, Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students, told The Tartan that UHS will completely move out of their current Morewood Gardens quarters into this new building. 
Casalegno says that the new building will allow CaPS to have a greater capacity for both individual and group therapy. She notes that the university has “a long time to really build up programmatically what we will be able to do with health services and with the counseling center,” but notes that expanded offerings from CaPS and UHS, including demonstrations from an in-house registered dietitian, are in the works.
The university also plans on “adding space for the spiritual and religious life programs, and establishing new facilities for intramural athletics,” Casalegno said. Due to the large-scale expansions planned, she adds, “what we anticipate will happen is we will tear down everything except for the current Skibo Gym,” which will see “interior renovations.”
The rest of the Skibo center will be demolished to make room for the new construction. Carnegie Mellon will soon bring on an architecture firm to finalize a design, but current layouts include a building that will stretch “all the way out to the sidewalk at Margaret Morrison Street… and Tech Street,” Casalegno says.
The university also hopes to preserve some of the grassy hill that is currently situated in front of Skibo. They won’t build above the current height of Skibo Gym.
Highmark has allocated $35 million of an estimated $100 million to establish this center, with the $65 million difference being covered by both the Make Possible  fundraising effort and other university resources.
Casalegno says that the Highmark grant came following a summer meeting between respective representatives. Carnegie Mellon “had an opportunity to put the idea in front of Highmark and see if it aligned with their priorities, and are thrilled that it did,” she said.
The grant “is purely a gift, with no conditions other than Highmark naming the new building,” Casalegno stated in an email. Highmark confirms this, saying that the facility won’t even house Highmark employees. They’re also yet to decide on a name, according to David Hall, Highmark vice president of enterprise partnerships.
As to why Highmark would contribute such a sum to a private university’s health system, Hall says that Highmark supports Carnegie Mellon’s “vision” for student health and wellness. “At the heart of [Highmark and Carnegie Mellon’s] relationship is bringing our thought leaders together with your thought leaders to address problems with healthcare provision and improve,” he said.
Hall continued, “we’re always looking to grow and enhance, and this was a great opportunity to really bring to life in a very, you know, externally facing way, in a symbolic way, everything that we believe Highmark Health and CMU both stand for.”
This grant isn’t Highmark’s first engagement with Carnegie Mellon. Since 2013, the healthcare provider has granted $16 million toward Carnegie Mellon’s Disruptive Health Technology Institute and an endowed faculty position currently held by the College of Engineering’s Alan Russell.
In a university press release, Carnegie Mellon University’s President, Farnam Jahanian, stated that “helping our talented students develop and maintain healthy bodies and minds is paramount to ensuring their lifelong success, both personally and professionally.”
“We are delighted to extend our partnership with Highmark Health to bring to fruition our vision for a unified, comprehensive facility that supports many facets of students’ well-being,” Jahanian added.
This story has been updated to reflect that CaPS will not be moving into the UHS Morewood space.

On Thursday, Nov. 7, TEDxCMU hosted student speaks for their first Salon event. Alona Beloussova, head of TEDxCMU’s Salon, thought of the concept two years ago when the student organization was looking for speakers for the main spring event. She believes that students on our campus “are wise, and have so much knowledge and life experience.”
The theme for this year’s Salon was “Shifting Colors.” Beloussova states, “Fall is a time of reflection, taking things from the past and applying them to the future.” She wants the audience to think about “how we can learn and grow from the past.” She asks, “what can we do to be better in the future?”
The event, held in Rangos 1 in the Jared L. Cohon University Center, featured three students, each with their own presentation. Each speaker discussed topics drawing on their own ideals and experiences, and some called Carnegie Mellon community members to action with their own life stories.
The first speaker was Anirudh Narayanan, a junior in Social and Decision Sciences. He spoke about the idea that “altruism isn’t real… it’s something we need to achieve.”
Narayanan defined altruism using the concept of the warm glow effect (also known as impure altruism), the idea that helping others gives emotional benefits to oneself. He says these actions to help others can be as small as opening the door for someone, or as large as philanthropic actions, but there is always a warm glow effect.
An example Narayanan used for altruism is the TeamTree Initiative that was started by YouTubers Mark Rober and Mr. Beast. For every dollar a person donated, one tree would be planted until 20 million trees could be planted by the end of 2019.
Within two weeks of beginning the initiative, people all around the globe had already donated more than $14 million. Narayanan spoke of how this initiative is a great example of altruism because everyone is contributing to a collective benefit.
Narayanan also told the audience about his own story and how he grew to understand altruism in his own life. From a child who weighed everything with a cost-benefit analysis to an individual believing in altruism and the importance in helping others, he ended with Fred Roger’s quote, “there are three ways to ultimate success: the first way is to be kind. The second way is to be kind. The third way is to be kind.”
Jessica Cronin, a Masters student in drama, was the second speaker, giving a talk titled “Intergenerational Trauma and Addiction: Coming out of the Shadows.” She talked about her own history of dealing with her younger brother, who lived with an addiction of almost 10 years, and the resulting overwhelming feeling of being out of control.
When Cronin first shared her past and her struggles with her extended Carnegie Mellon family, she feared that people wouldn’t understand. However, she was met with compassion, as her friends and professors shared their own traumas with her.
This experience led her to the realization that opening up leads finding others who share similar experiences and a supportive community can be born. She was always told, “do what you can, but don’t talk to others about it.” Cronin says this mindset can be very damaging, as families of those with addiction are all collateral damage of the addiction stigma.
However, she wants to stress that “hiding creates isolation,” and perpetuates addict shaming, preventing people from sharing their experiences and seeking help. She closed her talk by stressing the importance of creating bonds with others and how having a community to support you through hardships is incredibly important.
The third and final speaker was Nathan Chen, a sophomore studying business administration, who talked about “the power of social relationships.” He also shared a deeply personal story on the passing of his father, who was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer when Nathan was only 12 years old.
He believes that the most difficult parts of life are that which lead to the most growth. His father was an incredibly inspirational figure to him, and he presented the crowd three invaluable lessons that he learned from his father.
The first lesson is gratitude. As he saw how friends and family flew thousands of miles just to see his father for the last time, he learned to always be grateful for people who invest in and care for him.
Second, he realized that everyone puts up facades in their life to hide their own struggles and pain. As a result, he is always kind to others because he understands how terrible it can be to go through struggles alone.
Lastly, the idea of an outlandish bucket list disappears when you are at death’s door. Instead,  he learned from his father that relationships are what are the most important. 
Citing a Harvard Adult Development study and the Roseto Effect, Chen notes how strong social relationships are the main way to have a happy and longer life, that can trump years of bad habits.
Chen urged the audience to consider their priorities in their own lives and whether or not they are showing appreciation and gratitude to those that matter. He ended his speech with a quote by Stuart Scott: “When you die, it does not mean that you lose to cancer. You beat cancer by how you live, why you live, and the manner in which you live.”

Carnegie Mellon President Farnam Jahanian and Dean of Students Gina Casalegno, in conjunction with the Carnegie Mellon Student Senate, hosted their annual town hall to discuss the “strategic plan” for the direction of the university and field questions from students.
President Jahanian’s plan has four tenets: bringing and retaining outstanding and diverse talent, enhancing the Carnegie Mellon experience, expanding innovative approaches to teaching and learning, and building excellence across the university.
President Jahanian noted that there has been an increase in applications to the university over the last few years. He highlighted that half of the Class of 2023+ were women and that 17 percent of the class were international students.
He stressed the importance of diversity and briefly discussed a new program designed to provide more support for students from underrepresented minorities on campus. In a follow-up comment to The Tartan, he expressed that creating support systems for underrepresented minority students remains “an institutional priority.”
President Jahanian and Dean Casalegno expanded upon the plans for enhancing the university experience in great detail. They highlighted the new wellness center being created, the efforts of the Task Force on the Carnegie Mellon Experience and the Task Force on Campus Climate over the last few years, and increasing sexual assault bystander training. In further comments, Dean Casalegno acknowledged the issue of low rates of reporting sexual assault and stated that efforts were being undertaken to create a more comfortable climate for victims to report sexual assault.
President Jahanian quickly touched upon the third and fourth tenets of his plan. For the third tenet, he showcased the growing number of interdisciplinary majors and the expansion of state-of-the-art facilities. For the fourth tenet, he briefly gave more insight into the Make Possible fundraising campaign, which has already reached 50 percent of its $2 billion goal.
In a Q&A after the presentation, President Jahanian elaborated on Carnegie Mellon’s decision to invite Palantir, a software company that has drawn controversy for providing technology to ICE, to campus, and the future of liberal and visual arts at the university.
President Jahanian doubled down on the university’s stance following the Palantir protests: “If legitimate companies that are out there that want to come and recruit our students, we leave it up to our students to decide whether they want to work for those companies or not.”
As for the future of liberal and visual arts, President Jahanian stressed the importance of students having an interdisciplinary background, whether it is, as he said, STEM students being good writers or liberal arts students being able to analyze data.
“The future of education is going to be people who can cut across disciplines and who can connect with other disciplines,” he said.

“Dialogue and reason may seem like the default, but historically, they are in fact a rarity,” said Alex Fogelson, events coordinator for Carnegie Mellon’s Humanist League, setting the stage for last Tuesday’s Sagan Fest talk in McConomy Auditorium.
Professor Jonathan D. Haidt, Professor of Ethical Leadership at New York University, was invited to give a talk titled “Finding Truth in a Polarized Age” at the event.
Sagan Fest is named for Carl Sagan, and is an annual event honoring proponents of dialogue and reason in public discourse. Carl Sagan famously promoted critical thinking and the scientific method in popular culture.
This year, Haidt was endowed the Carl Sagan Award for his research on moral judgments, the progression of ideas, and the importance of diversity in perspectives. Haidt opened his speech by saying, “The theme of my talk is that good thinking requires good talking. We can’t be smart on our own.”
“I’m especially honored to get an award named for Carl Sagan,” Haidt continued. “Carl Sagan was such an apostle, such a popularizer. It’s thrilling just to have any association with Carl Sagan.”
Haidt asked people what they thought was definitive of the 21st century. Audience members chirped out answers like AI, the internet, and climate. “The 21st century is the century of social science,” Haidt said.
Haidt introduced the audience to two key concepts: tame problems and wicked problems. Tame problems, as he explained it, sit still while we work on them — like cholera. Wicked problems, on the other hand, are much hairier and stem from underlying visions and values for society.
“Disagreements over social and environmental policy cannot be resolved by experts who, in many ways, make them more intractable,” Haidt explained, in reference to wicked problems. “Getting to Mars is a tame problem because we’ll make steady progress. There won’t be ‘liberal’ Mars trips and ‘conservative’ Mars trips. Scientists will be working together.”
Haidt told the audience that economists aren’t quite so nonpartisan. Machine learning has been employed to find keywords in economist’s papers to indicate political leanings. For example, Haidt noted that papers with the term “Keynesian” tend to belong to left-leaning economists.
To encapsulate current social and political tension, Haidt used the term “wicked polarization.” Haidt cited a Duke paper that claimed people are skeptical of scientific evidence supporting the existence of problems with solutions that threaten their beliefs.
“We filter truth through what we want to believe,” Haidt explained. To put things into perspective, Haidt invoked political-attitudinal statistics showing that free-market conservatives were more skeptical of climatology findings than conservatives with different economic views.
Haidt then showed the audience statistics on the ever-growing partisan divide in political values and parties. “Wickeder problems are going to get wickeder and wickeder, we’re going to have a harder time finding the truth in the 2020s than in 2011,” Haidt claimed.
The Flynn Effect, up until now, has suggested that IQ is rising all around the world. Haidt said that we have come to a point where the Flynn Effect is leveling off, and he attributed it to political polarization and moralization.
“You can moralize or understand. You can’t do both at the same time,” Haidt said. He shared a favorite proverb of his: “Iron sharpens iron, and one person sharpens the wits of another.”
Haidt used a picture of Muslims gathering around the Kaaba Stone at Mecca when making another point: “Humans have an amazing ability to cooperate by making something sacred and circling around it. A lot of our logical thinking is guided by norms of sacredness, not logic. If a group holds anything sacred, they are part of a tribal-moral community, not a reality-based community.”
“Set good societal norms, and you get smarter. Set bad societal norms, and you get Twitter,” Haidt joked, met with the audience’s laughter. “We need good debates, we need critics, and we need people to disconfirm our hypothesis.”
Haidt confessed that he used to identify with the left politically, and that now has no political affiliation. “We’re almost all left,” Haidt said after polling the audience on their political leanings.
After citing statistics on the shrinking ratios of conservatives in academia, Haidt said, “My field used to have political diversity. Now we don’t. When you don’t have diversity, your science is worse, and peer review breaks down without viewpoint diversity.”
“You can’t just bring people together. You need to find long term commonality,” Haidt concluded.
Reflecting on the speech, Fogelson told The Tartan, “Institutional bias works against uncovering empirical truths, and our own biases often make it nearly impossible to align our beliefs with the truth. Understanding Dr. Haidt’s work is a phenomenal first step to take in critiquing how our society gets stuck circling around fixed ideas.”

Every year, we end Halloween with satisfaction and sugar. Children go to sleep with full stomachs and chocolate-stained fingers. Parents take buckets of candy off their porches. Teenagers wipe gory makeup off their faces. Adults stumble home from Halloween parties with their capes dragging across dirty concrete and their feet wobbling in shiny plastic boots before they collapse gratefully into bed.
Then, while everyone is sleeping, something terrible happens: the calendar flips to Nov. All around the world, employees cue up the store playlist. Somewhere in the distance, Mariah Carey cackles as her reign begins anew. Come the morning, Christmas music will return to stores, a full 55 days before Christmas. 
Of course, not all stores play Christmas music in Nov. But it’s widespread enough that people take notice. It has become the subject of jokes and memes, as well as a topic of controversy and debate. There are people who embrace Christmas cheer wholeheartedly and would start playing Christmas music in Oct. if they could get away with it. There are others that bemoan poor, unappreciated Thanksgiving. Some people seem ready to bludgeon everyone within a mile radius if they hear the slightest jingle of bells.
The problem is not with Christmas music itself, which can be a diverse and enjoyable genre; the problem is its ubiquity and context. If you want to listen to Christmas music on your own time, whatever. That’s your choice. But when stores start forcing the music on unsuspecting customers, that’s when it gets truly annoying.  
Holiday jingles are annoying. They're overplayed, which makes it harder to appreciate. The first time you hear "All I Want for Christmas is You," you might sing along. The next couple of times, you might bop your head. The next thirty, you listen in silence. Eventually, when you inevitably start reaching the hundreds, you find that "All You Want for Christmas" is some peace and quiet. When you can’t curate your Christmas music experience, iconic songs become grating within weeks. By the time Dec. rolls around, you might get sick of Christmas music altogether. 
Another problem is the intention of these stores. Stores don’t play Christmas music simply because they love the season. When people hear Christmas music, they think about the Christmas season. They think about the parties they have to plan, the food they’ll have to cook, and the presents they’ll have to buy. With their responsibilities pressing down on them, they may be inclined to spend more at the store. Yes, the Grinch was right: people celebrate Christmas for selfish and financial gain. 
Additionally, despite the widespread cultural impact of Christmas, it’s still a Christian holiday. Some of the music is focused more on snowy hills and warm fireplaces. But for every "Let it Snow," there are dozens of songs explicitly mentioning Santa Claus, Christmas, and ol’ Jesus Christ. This can be frustrating for those who don’t celebrate Christmas. The idea that “Christmas is for everyone” does not erase the religious origins but rather ignores other religions and the people who practice them. People already have to deal with seeing flashy Christmas lights and mangers everywhere. The least they deserve is some nice, calming, secular music while they shop.
Finally, some people may not be thinking about justifications for why Christmas music shouldn’t be played in Dec. For some people, it’s just plain annoying. There's no deeper reason behind it, and that’s valid too. 
This opinion actually isn’t that uncommon. According to Consumer Reports, 23 percent of people dread seasonal music. A Research Intelligence Group poll from 2014 found that 36 percent of people say they left a store sooner because of it. Additionally, in the same poll, 58 percent of people say they believe Christmas music should only be played in Dec. 
Disliking Christmas music before Thanksgiving is not a niche opinion. Yet stores continue to cycle through their festive playlist, turning us all into Scrooges one jaunty rendition of "Santa Claus is Coming to Town" at a time.
Of course, Christmas music in Nov. is not a crime. It’s not hurtful. It’s not offensive. It might not even be the most annoying thing you endure in that store, considering that other customers still exist. However, it’s still annoying enough to have an opinion on it. And we will hold onto this opinion fiercely, no matter how hard Frosty the Snowman tries to pry it from our cold, dead fingers.

After reading The Tartan’s recently published article on voluntourism, we found the depiction of alternative spring break organizations, especially the commentary on Outreach360, disturbing and most importantly, uninformed.
We agree that voluntourism is a problem deeply rooted in sociopolitical power dynamics and appreciate that the columnist brought up the issue of promoting selfish agendas under the pretense of volunteer work. 
We are, however, deeply disappointed that the columnist criticized Outreach360 without meeting a single member from the organization, and without doing a reasonable amount of research. The columnist accusing Outreach360’s description on the website as “narcissistic” and “neocolonist” based on its syntax and word choice without seeking any clarification from the members was completely unwarranted, shocking, and distressing. The article fails to mention anything about the work Outreach360 puts in to establish mutual trust with the community or how much emphasis is put on educating volunteers.
We did receive a pleasant outreach from the columnist a few days before the article was published seeking general information. Our trip leader responded with a brief overlook of the program, to which the columnist replied, "Hopefully I can fit it [Outreach360] in my schedule...if not maybe next year!” This made the article all the more surprising and upsetting, especially since the columnist made it clear in the article that she has “never been on an alternative spring break trip, and [has] no plans of doing so.” The information discussed between the columnist and the trip leader was purely general information rather than the concerns she expressed in the article. 
Outreach360 welcomes feedback, opinions, and criticism from CMU. However, Outreach360 cannot and will not let accusations that aren’t based on accurate information poorly reflect our organization and in a larger context, volunteer organizations at Carnegie Mellon. The current trip leaders would appreciate the opportunity to meet the columnist and members of the Carnegie Mellon community to discuss the points made in the article as well as ways of better informing the CMU community.

To Mark Zuckerberg, false political ads are freedom of expression. This belief is completely driven by his desire to maximize Facebook’s profits. This is more than unethical; it is damaging to our democracy because more than 40 percent of Americans consume their news through Facebook.
On Oct. 30, Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s CEO, announced that Twitter will ban all political ads globally. This announcement came days after the House Financial Services Committee skewered Mark Zuckerberg, so it is likely that Mr. Dorsey’s decision came in light of the ongoing criticism of the way Zuckerberg regulates — or fails to regulate — information on his platform. 
In a speech at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., Zuckerberg defended Facebook’s decision to allow Donald Trump to run falsified political ads that claimed former Vice President Joe Biden got a Ukrainian prosecutor fired to stop an investigation into his son’s business dealings. This is false; the prosecutor was fired to eliminate corruption in Ukraine. Facebook refused to remove the ad, despite heavy criticism from politicians and the media. 
Senator Elizabeth Warren has never held very high views of Zuckerberg or Facebook. To challenge him and the corporation, she bought false political advertisements of her own. She wanted to prove her point that Facebook must reconsider its policy that allows the platform to spread lies and conspiracy theories. Senator Warren is completely right; Facebook should change its policy to prevent politicians from spreading lies through their political advertisements. Facebook holds so much power over the American public, and with power comes great responsibility. 
There is a messy line between free speech and the blatant spread of lies, the latter of which could be damaging to a person’s reputation and potentially libelous. Facebook must draw the line and fact check political advertisements, because too many Americans consume their news from Facebook and only Facebook. Zuckerberg says that it is not Facebook’s job to monitor lies spread by politicians on the network because it could lead to a slippery slope. 
However, Facebook does regulate some false ads. In his hearing in front of the House Financial Services Committee, Zuckerberg admitted that Facebook removes any ads that target minority populations and ads that advertise the wrong election date or false election information. So, if Facebook regulates some political advertisements, why is it unwilling to regulate all paid political advertisements? Surely, Facebook has enough money to hire more staff, who could be solely dedicated to solving this issue. If he is willing to regulate the speech of all other advertisements on the platform, he has no logical basis for refusing to do the same for political ads. Political ads should be no different from other ads appearing on the website. 
Even Facebook employees disagree with Zuckerberg’s policy on paid political ads. Top Facebook employees wrote a letter to Zuckerberg, urging him to reverse course on this decision to protect the “integrity” of their platform. The letter states, “Free speech and paid speech are not the same thing. Misinformation affects us all. Our current policies of fact-checking people in political office, or those running for office, are a threat to what FB stands for." The employees proposed a multi-pronged solution to improve the policy, including: spending caps for politicians, clearer policies for political ads, and treating political ads the same as other ads. Despite the lack of agreement among his employees, Zuckerberg remains unwilling to budge on this given issue.
Money is the figure dancing in the background behind the whole issue. In his testimony to the House Financial Services Committee, Zuckerberg estimated that the company would earn around $420 million of revenue from political ads in the timespan leading to 2020. He projects this to be only 0.5 percent of Facebook’s revenue next year. Zuckerberg claims that the money from political advertisements is minuscule when compared to Facebook’s overall yearly revenue, so why doesn’t Facebook follow Twitter’s lead and ban political advertisements all together? This would eliminate the contradiction in Facebook’s ad regulation tendencies, and instead of regulating paid political speech — which Zuckerberg is so uncomfortable with — it would eliminate it. If Facebook banned all political advertisements, Zuckerberg and his team would not be responsible for determining what constitutes a fact or misinformation, so this solution should be seriously considered, as it would assuage Zuckerberg’s hesitations.
Some political strategists have warned that if Facebook were to ban all political advertisements, it would hurt candidates and possibly favor incumbents. This does not have to be the case. An absence of political ads on all forms of social media may encourage the American public to look elsewhere for information on candidates. In general, it is problematic that the average American goes to Facebook for the daily news, because a person’s timeline is tailored to their personal biases, so eliminating political ads may be the first step towards helping the public expand the sources through which they consume news about politics.

On Wednesday afternoon, Emmett Donlon, a junior at Carnegie Mellon’s College of Fine Arts, stood alone on the Cut next to the Alpha Kappa Psi Professional Business Fraternity. He was protesting the fraternity’s means of fundraising: selling chicken sandwiches from Chick-fil-A.
The business fraternity is not the only organization on campus selling food from Chick-fil-A. During National Coming Out Week earlier this semester, Carnegie Mellon’s Ski Team hosted stands selling the sandwiches. Chik-fil-A sandwiches have been sold by many organizations and Greek Life within the past year, but the Tri Delta Sorority has recently ended all Chick-fil-A fundraisers. Not all clubs at Carnegie Mellon have followed suit.
“On Monday, I decided to give an article to Alpha Kappa Psi about the problems with continuing to support a company that is openly anti-LGBTQ+,” shares Donlon. “When I saw them on Wednesday still selling Chick-fil-A, I realized that I needed to do more, so I made my sign and headed outside.” 
The one-man protest by Donlon was not easy, despite the support consisting of head-nods, smiles, and thumbs up.
“A woman — who I believe was a staff member — told me to read the Bible,” Donlon says. “When members of the organization admitted to my face that Chick-fil-A was a queerphobic and bad business, they still defended themselves in wanting to continue selling mediocre homophobic chicken in the future.”
Chick-fil-A, the well-known and loved fast-food company, has a history of donating to fund homophobic projects. In 2012, the company was caught donating to the Family Research Council and Exodus International, a conversion therapy group. 
The most controversial donations were to the National Christian Foundation (NCF), a major Christian nonprofit that has donated to conservative religious organizations and charities, including some hate groups. The CEO, Dan Cathy, told the media he was “guilty as charged,” but promised to “treat every person equally, regardless of sexual orientation.” Chick-fil-A has not donated to the NCF since 2012.
However, tax filings from 2017 reveal that the company gave $1,653,416 to the Fellowship of Christian Athletes (FCA), $150,000 to the Salvation Army, and more to other organizations that are known to discriminate against members of the LGBTQ+ community. Their promise had thus been broken.
The FCA, an organization that spreads Christianity through sports, has a “sexual purity statement” that defines marriage as a “covenant between one man and one woman,” and gender as something “determined by biological sex instead of one’s self perception.” 
The Salvation Army, despite recent statements and commitments made in favor of the LGBTQ+ community, has a brutal history with homophobia and transphobia to the community and to its own employees. This history includes firing employees upon discovering their sexual orientation or gender identity and subjecting transgender people to physical examinations in Salvation Army housing.
With all this information in mind, Emmett Donlon wanted to take a stand.
“I don't know of any orgs that have stopped selling Chick-fil-A, but I hope that we can just remove their presence completely from campus,” he states. “Supporting Chick-fil-A is supporting the death and erasure of queer people.”
Most recently, Chick-fil-A came under fire for its alleged involvement in the creation of a death penalty punishment for being LGBTQ+ in Uganda. This has been rated “mostly false” by Politifact, a fact-checking website. Nonetheless, critics drew connections between the NCF’s involvement in Ugandan policies criminalizing homosexuality in 2010, despite the fact that Chick-fil-A’s foundation no longer donates to the nonprofit. 
“I think a large part of the problem though is apathy in our world towards everything today,” Emmett Donlon says. “People think, ‘I can't see the harm because it isn't in front of my face, and Chick-fil-A is just too good and convenient to give up.’ But this is just bad morals."
“My signs and I will not be leaving next time any organization sells Chick-fil-A,” he continues. “I have people who will take my place if I get dragged away, because I will not be silenced.”
In response to Donlon’s protest, Alpha Kappa Psi provided the following statement: “Alpha Kappa Psi’s new members conduct fundraisers to support a variety of initiatives each semester. We completely support the message behind the protest, and will be more considerate when choosing fundraisers in the future.”
