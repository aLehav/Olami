The Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s track and field teams competed in the Al Hall Freedom Games on Saturday against NCAA Division- I, II, and III schools at Edinboro University. This was the first meet of the season, and was unscored. 
Several men and women on the teams had strong performances that set the bar high for the rest of the track season.
Sophomore Nathan Cheek, the 2011 UAA Indoor Track weight-throw champion and Carnegie Mellon football player, placed first in the weight throw  with a throw of 15.46 meters.
Several of Cheek’s fellow teammates also had excellent performances. In the high jump, first-year Mike McDermott cleared the 2.00 meter bar to place second.
Junior Daniel Cardenas Rivero represented Carnegie Mellon well in the pole vaulting event, clearing a height of 4.25 meters, placing second in the event. The running events also saw their share of strong performances.
In the 800-meter event, sophomore runner Douglas O’Connell finished second with a time of 1:57:89. In the 3,000-meter event, sophomore George Degen finished second with a time of 8:37.46.
“I was proud of the way that we ran on Saturday. A lot of our guys came close to or matched their best marks, which is very promising, considering it was our first meet. We had strong performances across many events, in both running and throwing. The throwers especially look like they are going to have an awesome season,” Degen said. “I’m excited for our team’s potential this season.”
On the women’s side, sophomores Halley Bayer and Erin Kiekhaefer, and first-years Erin Persson and Jillian Jaycox finished first in the 4x800-meter relay in a time of 10:13.74. 
“It was a great way to start of the season,” Jaycox said. “Pain is temporary, pride is forever.”
In the 60-meter hurdles, junior Jacqueline Guevel, a 2011 All-American recipient, finished second with a time of 9.27. 
In the 60-meter dash, first-year Jenna Asperslag raced to a fourth-place finish, with a respectable first-meet time of 8.35 seconds.
Sophomore Sasha Spalding sprinted to a fourth-place finish with a time of 27.18. In the 3,000-meter race, junior Elise Hall’s time of 10:51.48 placed her third in the event. 
Senior Emily Wobb doubled up by running both the mile and the 800-meter run, placing third and fourth with times of 5:23.31 and 2:32.90, respectively.
“The best part was getting a preview of what the next week’s workouts are going to be like from the paces ran, distances thrown and the heights jumped,” Wobb said. “It was a great meet.”
The next competition for the Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s track and field teams is the Denison Lid-Lifter on Saturday in Granville, Ohio.

The Carnegie Mellon Men’s Water Polo Club team looks to make a splash this year by expanding their team and emphasizing team-building.
Last December, the squad represented the Mid-Atlantic Division at the 2012 National Collegiate Club Championship in Middlebury, Vt. 
First-year mechanical engineering and business administration double major Ted Warhoe, a utility player, said, “We were just very happy to be there. Most other teams at nationals had a full team on the bench, when we only had one substitute.”
Even without a full team, they exhibited a strong performance at the Mid-Atlantic Championships at Franklin & Marshall College, despite playing without any substitutes. 
Club president Willy Elmore, a junior civil and environmental engineering and engineering and public policy double major, said, “Considering we were rebuilding, it was pretty awesome that we competed at the national level at the Division-III club tournament.”
The team worked hard, attending three tournaments and the Division-III National Championship in the fall semester. 
With an overall record of 5–6, the team posted big wins against Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania, Grove City College, Lehigh University, and Franklin & Marshall College throughout the season. 
Looking forward into the spring, Elmore plans on expanding the size of the team, hopefully supplementing substitute players to the seven main positions in water polo.
“Right now we don’t have a whole lot of players and not a whole lot of subs at tournaments, and I want to go farther at the national tournament than we did this past year,” Elmore said.
In terms of learning from the fall season, he said that he had “no regrets,” but hopes to improve “team chemistry and thinking as a team.”
Many of the players in the club come from backgrounds in high school water polo and competitive swimming, with some graduate students having played at the collegiate varsity level. 
One of these players is biomedical engineering graduate student Miki Silver, a current player in the hole set position whom the team is attempting to replace after his graduation this spring.
“Anyone can come play,” Silver said. “All you need is a positive attitude and willingness to work hard.”
The team’s plan for the spring semester is to continue lifting, swimming, going through dry-land exercises, and having players improve their game by experimenting with different positions. 
The team only has the pool three times a week, but has already begun intense preparation and team-building for next season.
“As a team we hang out on the weekend all the time and we’re a pretty close bunch of students. It’s really more than a team, it’s a group of friends as well,” Elmore said.
Warhoe agreed, “We all support each other; we really are a family.”

Although many would recognize her as the sweet, smiling first-year girl strolling around campus, few others know of Liza Otto’s basketball prowess. 
Otto, despite being in the middle of what she calls “the tough transition period to college basketball,” has helped lead the Tartans’ women’s basketball team to their best record in years, with an overall 10–6 record.
For the past 10 seasons, the best the Tartans have performed in the University Athletic Association (UAA) Conference has been 2–12 for the entire season, making their overall winning record so far a major accomplishment. 
Otto has been a top-contributing starter to the team, recently leading victories over Case Western University and Brandeis University. 
In Friday’s game against the University of Rochester, Otto achieved a career-high 13 rebounds for the Tartans.
On Dec. 29 last year, Otto scored 12 points and 10 rebounds to achieve her second double-double of the season. 
Otto has been one of the team’s most consistent top scorers this year, scoring 13 points in their most recent game.
She is currently ranked  in several categories in the UAA  conference, which include total points, rebounding, assists, free-throw percentage, and blocked shots. 
Her teammates attribute her success to her positive attitude. “Liza has a hard-working attitude and poise on the court,” said senior captain Tori Baggio. 
“She’s been such a positive force for the team so far,” said sophomore teammate Chandler Caufield.  “She is an integral part of our team.”
Hailing from Glastonbury, Conn., Otto certainly has had experience with the sport of basketball.  
She has played since she was seven years old, and said she loves “being part of a team with people that you can rely on and trust.”
Otto is currently in the Bachelor of Humanities and Arts program. 
An architecture and psychology major, said she loves the Carnegie Mellon team because of “team chemistry” and that the “program has provided [her] with stellar academics and a competitive level of basketball.”
She said that although she was not sure what to expect coming into the season, knowing that the team was still growing and adjusting to a new coach, she has been surprised by the excellent team’s level of success. Not only has Otto and the team had to adjust to the coaching staff, but Otto herself has switched positions several times this season, playing everything from forward to guard.
Otto has been “humbled by [her] experience as a first-year starter,” but remains focused on the team’s future goals.
“I hope we can make it to the conference championships,” Otto said. “I really think that we can leave our mark this season.”
Her teammates agree. “This is the best we’ve done in the conference in a long time. We want to make a statement and show everyone that Carnegie Mellon is a new team and that we’re a force to be reckoned with,” Baggio said. 
The new team hopes to celebrate itself by planning a summer trip to Europe, but for now, Otto and the Tartans will continue to work on improving their record and “making the most out of this season.”
Otto also emphasized the importance of the coaches in the team’s success, and cited their efforts to make the season both rewarding and enjoyable. 
“They help motivate us a lot,” Otto said. “The assistant coaches, Tiff and Sarah, even reward us for making good plays  by giving us socks!”
Otto’s positivity, fun spirit and true love for the game is illuminated by her hopes for the rest of the season. “I think if we work hard enough, anything is possible,” she said. “We’re just that kind of team.”

After months of waiting, hockey in all of its blades of glory — has finally returned to the Steel City.
The NHL kicked off its season Saturday after ending a nearly four-month-long lockout. This reduced season schedule has shrunk the normal 82-game season marathon to a short 48-game sprint to the playoffs. 
Due to the shortened season, brief training camp, integration of new personnel, learning of new coaching schemes, and regaining of lost conditioning, this should be an exciting season.
Last season’s poor playoffs performance, at the hands of division rival Philadelphia Flyers, left a bitter taste in the mouths of fans and players.
Now, the Pittsburgh Penguins are ready to avenge last season’s disappointment and make a run deep into the playoffs. Hopefully, they will skate away at the end of the season with another Stanley Cup. 
While the roster has undergone a bit of a shake-up, the Pens are still led by their top-tier centers, last year’s MVP Evgeni Malkin and perennial all-star Sidney Crosby. With Crosby being healthy for a full off-season, Pittsburgh should finally have both of its stars peaking at the right time. 
A main cause for the Pens’ collapse to the Flyers at the end of last season and into the playoffs was goalie Marc-Andre Fleury’s poor performance.
At the top of his game, Fleury is one of the best goalies. But when he’s off his game, Fleury becomes a major liability for Pittsburgh. 
Not even the Pens’ offense can consistently compensate for all the goals he lets in. To put some pressure on Fleury, the team traded a seventh-round draft pick for Tomas Vokoun, who started last season in goal for the Washington Capitals before losing his starting job halfway through the season due to injuries. 
At 36, there are questions about Vokoun’s ability as an everyday starter if Fleury gets injured or does not perform. This long off-season and rushed preseason has done nothing to ease the concerns with Vokoun’s playing ability.
The primary off-season move for the Pens took place back during the summer. Third-line center James Staal was traded to the Carolina Hurricanes for a package including center Brandon Sutter. 
While Staal is a much better player, his desire for a larger contract combined with Pittsburgh’s well of talent at the center position led to the Pens’ decision to trade him in return for younger players and future draft picks. 
Sutter is a very good third-line center, but he could face problems if Malkin or Crosby gets injured and he is called on to fill in. He hasn’t proven to be the most reliable player thus far.
Overall, the Pens’ plays are very similar to those of last year, distinguished by yet another high-scoring offense led by a front line of Malkin and forward James Neal, a solid above-average defense, and question marks in goal. 
Scoring has never been the Pens’ problem, and it seems unlikely to start now, especially with Malkin coming off winning the Art Ross trophy as the league’s scoring champion.
The team’s offense should also be led by Crosby, who will play in his first healthy season since dealing with lingering concussion symptoms that cost him the better part of the previous two seasons.
But while all that firepower will carry Pittsburgh into the playoffs, how far they go will be placed solely at the hands of Fleury and Vokoun. Unless Fleury recaptures his old form or Vokoun starts playing as good as he has his whole career, the Pens are looking at another early-round exit. 
This team’s playoffs hope lives and dies with its goal-tending. No matter how many times the offense can save, it will be fruitless if Fleury cannot stop the puck.

The Tartans men’s basketball team were defeated by the No. 1-ranked University of Rochester and the No. 3 Emory University this past weekend. Their record now stands at 3–13 overall and 0–5 in conference.
Friday night, the Tartans faced the University of Rochester Yellowjackets at home. 
The game started out as a battle for the lead with constant buckets from both teams. Sophomore guard Seth Cordts was a major player for the Tartans’ offense, contributing to the team’s first four points. 
After the score was tied at nine, the Yellowjackets went on a run with a score of 20–18 with 10 minutes remaining in the first half, until junior forward Rob Mohen made a three-pointer to take the lead.
Rochester answered with a jump shot, regaining the lead for another nine minutes while the Tartans filled the gap. 
They eventually took the lead at the end of the half from a three-pointer taken by junior guard Asad Meghani.
The second half opened with a tied score off of a threepointer from the Yellowjackets who later took the lead and never looked back.
The final score was 72–63. The Tartans shot 43 percent from the field and 45.8 percent from beyond the arc.
The Tartans’ next opponents were the Emory University Eagles. 
The Eagles started off on fire and progressed the score to 20–9 until Meghani made a three-pointer. 
This spurred the Tartans to an 11–6 run to bring the deficit to six points after a three-pointer from sophomore guard Jason Blakney. 
The half was hard fought, but Emory was able to end the Tartan run and finish the half with a score of 52–37. 
The second half was not much better for the Tartans, who weren’t able to stop the Eagles offense. They scored 95 points to the Tartans’ 70.
Over the winter break, the Tartans scored wins against Bethany College and LaRoche College, but have not been able to carry these sucesses over to their conference games.
“As competitive as the UAA is, we have the ability to do well the rest of conference games and we have the ability to finish this season strong,” Cordts said.
The Tartans will play at home against Washington University in St. Louis this Friday at 8 p.m. and against the University of Chicago next Sunday at 2 p.m.

While students and faculty prepared for their holiday travels, Carnegie Mellon physics professor Diane Turnshek, physics Ph.D. candidate Nora Swisher, and art master’s student Dan Wilcox made preparations to embark on a journey to another planet.
Turnshek, Swisher, and Wilcox were selected by The Mars Society as part of a six-member team to explore a long-held human curiosity: the possibility of humans living on Mars. For the past 12 years, The Mars Society has been conducting experiments to gain insight into how astronauts would survive if they took an expedition to Mars.
Each year The Mars Society selects a six-member team every two weeks to travel to their Mars Desert Research station (MDRS) near Hanksville, Utah from December to May. The research station consists of a two-story cylindrical habitat for living, a building reserved for waste treatment and biological projects called the Greenhab and the Musk Observatory. For two weeks, each group lives and conducts experiments just as astronauts would on Mars.
An Ethereal Simulation
At MDRS, the team’s research spanned both geological and biological aspects of life on Mars. To gain a more concrete understanding of Mars’ environment, the crew traveled through airlocks, photographed geological formations, and studied rock and soil samples. According to Turnshek, the most interesting findings were those that would not be found on Mars, such as “fossil shell beds as far as the eye could see, tree trunks turned to fossilized wood, and ancient animal bones,” she said via email.
Although these findings didn’t suggest a Martian environment, Turnshek was confident that the method of obtaining them would have been helpful on a Mars expedition. “We experienced the difficulty of doing fieldwork in spacesuits. Had we actually been on Mars, the way we identified interesting sites, mapped out and navigated the routes, and collected samples would have served us well,” she said.
Traveling in spacesuits was just one of the many difficulties the team members faced. During their time at the research station, they came face to face with the challenges that would accompany giving up every day earthly conveniences and adjusting to an environment with a harsh climate and an intense drop in gravity.
All three agreed that the largest challenges of living on Mars were “the human factors,” such as “communication, relative boredom, depression, and food fatigue.” Isolation and team hierarchies created rifts in communication. “Asking for guidance was a procedural pain, and the mission commander made decisions for us without being onsite,” Turnshek said. “For instance, we were confined to the habitat after a snowfall that was deemed too dangerous to walk in.”
“I think we can figure out all the technological challenges of getting to and living on Mars, but the human factors will make or break a mission,” Swisher said.
Scientific and Artistic Inspirations
For all three, the trip played a significant part in their current work and future goals. For Swisher, the expedition was a significant step toward achieving her childhood dream of becoming an astronaut.
“My goal of becoming an astronaut was not serious until MDRS.... Now I’m going to sign up for the Mars One astronaut training for a potential future trip to Mars,” she said  via email.
After her experience at MDRS, Swisher plans to go backpacking, participate in outreach programs for younger students, and possibly make a second trip to Utah or do similar simulations in other parts of the world.
“I have academic and research experience in my field, but MDRS has given me professional experience in a totally different category,” she said.
Both Wilcox and Turnshek intend to use this experience in their upcoming works of art and fiction.
Although Wilcox is a third-year MFA student, he grew up amidst NASA activity in his hometown in Alabama, and therefore cultivated an interest in space travel. “As an artist, I feel my role is to be doing research in development for humanity,” he explained.
Wilcox plans to include concepts and artifacts from his expedition, such as pictures of different soil types, in his thesis. This March, his graduating class will be presenting a Master of Fine Arts Thesis show at the Miller Gallery. His thesis project is a live musical performance “Robot Cowboy Onward to Mars,” and a concept album about humans living on Mars.
Turnshek teaches Introduction to Astronomy and Experimental Physics at Carnegie Mellon, and teaches astronomy and The Physics of Science Fiction at the University of Pittsburgh. Writing science fiction is one of her many hobbies; in 2011, she co-authored an award-winning book on fiction writing,  Many Genres/One Craft. Her upcoming novel No Experience, is a young- adult adventure novel that takes place on Mars.
“My time spent on analog Mars fueled my writing,” she said. “I now know what extreme water conservation feels like. Making use of everything — things I would have thrown away without a thought beforehand. My life depending on my vehicle … I have achieved my goal of now being able to write fiction with verisimilitude.”
The Future of Colonization
Colonization of Mars has largely been seen as a dream fulfilled only in science fiction. However, Turnshek, Swisher, and Wilcox hope to convey that it is attainable, and perhaps even necessary.
Aside from NASA, a number of private companies are taking steps to establish human presence on Mars. Mars One, a nonprofit company, plans to begin establishing colonies on Mars by 2023. The company is currently seeking groups of four astronauts to periodically send on reality TV-style missions to Mars.
Those selected would pay for their own travel and their journey would be publicly visible. “The kicker is that these missions are set up as a series of one-way trips,” Turnshek said. The idea may seem bizarre, but according to Wilcox, there has been more than a significant number of volunteers.
Colonization of Mars will be different from prior space expeditions because, in Turnshek’s words, it will be more than “a flags-and-footprints mission to just say we’ve been there…. We need an actual reason to colonize Mars.” And it appears that we have quite a compelling one.
According to Turnshek, “Scientists have recognized that having humans living in a sustainable colony is a safety measure for the continuance of our species in case of a disaster on Earth…. For the sake of humankind, we need to get off the planet.”
Turnshek believes there could be human presence on Mars within a few decades. Swisher and Wilcox hope to see an expedition even sooner. “Technological ability is not preventing us from going to Mars. If we put in the money and manpower, we could go to Mars in the next 10–15 years … it’s a matter of will, not ability,” Swisher said.
After their experience, all three hope to encourage involvement in space expeditions. “Mars might be looking for a few good men and women, but those who go will be counting on us to have their backs. It takes a planet to send a colony to Mars,” Turnshek said.
“What’s interesting to me about this project is thinking about approaching something that has a meaning beyond just our generation or just our time. I really think the defining moment of our time should be … that humans go to Mars,” Wilcox said.

Imagine a world where robots walk and talk indistinguishably among us. Robotics professor Yaser Sheikh and mechanical engineering Ph.D. student Hyun Soo Park are working on research that will one day allow robots to understand and adapt upon social interactions.
“Currently, robots have a very good understanding of the environment around them, the geometric relationships,” Park said. “But we think that they need more information. In order for robots to be collaborative with humans as a team member, they need to understand the social context they are in. Robots can do tasks, but truly interacting with humans requires some sort of empathy.”
But how can robots possibly understand social interactions? Sheikh and Park have developed an algorithm that takes into account where people are looking in order to analyze the social context of a situation.
“The gaze is a very interesting social signal,” Park said. “Where you are looking at is a very strong cue to understand[ing] what is going on around you.” By using head-mounted cameras to track where people look, one can determine the point where the most gazes intersect. 
Sheikh and Park use the videos captured by head-mounted cameras to track the directions people are looking at. The algorithm works by knowing where two people are and the directions they are looking at, and extends these directions to find where they meet. The point with the most intersections is determined to be the most important, or most “socially salient,” event in the room.
One application of this concept is integrating robots into the work force. “A number of professionals already wear head-mounted cameras, such as soldiers, search and rescue teams, and police officers,” Sheikh said.
Park also mentioned that this method of analyzing social behavior can be used to study children with autism. Either the clinician, parent, or the child would wear the head-mounted camera.
However, Sheikh believes that head-mounted cameras will soon become popular among ordinary consumers as well. “I consider it likely that head-mounted sensors and displays will be as commonplace in a decade as smartphones are today,” he said.
In fact, the prototype of Google Glass is scheduled to come out soon. Google Glass is an aluminum strip with a display, a camera, and two nose pads that one can wear like a pair of glasses. Park explained how the cameras that were originally used for their project were relatively large and bulky; the more recent models are more accurate, smaller, and can be worn conveniently as a headset.
“Google Glass could improve the accuracy of our research because of its sleekness,” Park said. “Although the downside is that its resolution will probably not be as good.” High resolution is important to their research because it helps them better estimate a camera’s position and orientation in three-dimensional space.
The quest to interpret human interactions for robots can be further improved by incorporating other inputs besides gaze intersections, such as facial expressions or audio signals. Sheikh explained how small gestures such as a casual shrug or a slight nod of the head are easily interpreted by humans. 
“Human perception is incredibly good at picking these up, and we’re trying to understand how to develop algorithms that can do so too,” he said. “To this end, we’ve built a massive sensing dome in the basement of Newell-Simon with hundreds of cameras, and are developing algorithms to learn from what these cameras see.”
Sheikh and Park have been using head-mounted cameras to understand social interactions for the past year and are funded by the National Science Foundation. As they continue their research, their findings will not only help humans better understand social dynamics and behavioral disorders, but may one day help robots understand us too.

The human body consists of 78 organs and 13 organ systems that work collaboratively like a well-oiled machine. Among the most vital is the heart, which pumps 2,000 gallons of blood per day to ensure oxygen and nutrients are being circulated throughout the body. As humans age, the heart may begin to pump less efficiently. 
According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), each year over 3,000 patients suffering from heart failure need a heart transplant to ensure their survival but have to wait patiently until a donor heart can be found. Unfortunately, only about 2,000 heart transplants are performed annually, leaving a few thousand people without a healthy heart. Fortunately, an artificial heart can be used in the most severe cases to allow patients to return to their daily lives until a suitable donor heart is available.
In order to understand how an artificial heart works, it is first important to know how the four chambers of a normal human heart function. Blood circulates throughout the body by delivering oxygen to other organs from the right atrium of the heart. The heart’s primary function is to pump this blood through the right ventricle to the lungs, where it gets replenished with oxygen. The blood then re-enters the heart at the left atrium and is pumped through the left ventricle to the rest of the body.
During the first stage of a heartbeat, the two atria contract, pumping the blood to the ventricles. During the second stage, the ventricles contract, causing blood to leave the heart through the pulmonary artery to the lungs and through the aorta to the rest of the body.
Contrary to popular belief, an artificial heart only replaces the two ventricles and connects to the natural atrium. Unlike the normal heart, which pumps blood to the lungs and body at same time, an artificial heart can force blood out of only one ventricle at a time.
Currently, there are two leading designs of the artificial heart that utilize different methods to force the blood out of the ventricles.
SynCardia Systems, Inc. has developed a heart with two ventricles separated by a diaphragm, similar to the muscle that expands and contracts in our bodies when we breathe. Blood fills one ventricle and is ejected when an external pump ejects air into the other side of the diaphragm. Howitworksdaily.com states this model has been approved by the FDA —but the only downside is that it requires an external pump weighing about 13-and-a-half pounds that can fit in a backpack.
Having external parts can increase the risk of infection. AbioCor, the artificial heart developed by AbioMed addresses this problem by having all the necessary components inside the body. Instead of a diaphragm and an air pump, this heart uses a hydraulic pump. According to howstuffworks.com, when the hydraulic fluid moves to the right, blood in the right ventricle gets pumped to the lungs. Conversely, when hydraulic fluid moves to the left, the blood in the left ventricle gets pumped to the rest of the body.
Both artificial hearts need a source of energy to ensure that the heart beats continuously so that a patient doesn’t succumb to cardiac arrest. The SynCardia Total Artificial Heart has two external rechargeable batteries and can also be plugged into a wall outlet. The AbiCor heart also has an external battery pack but utilizes a wireless energy transfer system to transmit power through the skin without penetrating the surface.
Generally, the hearts are made of titanium and plastic. One of the biggest challenges is inserting an artificial object into the body and having the body accept it. During a seven-hour surgery, hundreds of stitches are used to attach the artificial device to the patient’s natural tissue with synthetic tissue called grafts.
Artificial hearts have been a growing success as technology continues to improve allowing patients to live longer with the heart without the risk of infection. This past year was monumental for SynCardia Systems, Inc. as the company successfully completed 125 implants. According to the New England Journal of Medicine, 79 percent of patients who receive a transplant survive long enough to receive a donor heart. However, escaping death does have a price — covering the cost of an artificial heart requires  about $125,000, and a yearly maintenance fee of $18,000.
After over 900 successful implants, the artificial heart continues to improve so that patients can live longer and infection free. Finding a donor heart, however, is still the best option for patients.

Russia to launch unmanned probe to moon by 2015
Russia will resume exploring the moon by sending an unmanned probe, called the Luna-Globe or Moon-Globe, in 2015. Luna-Globe would have an orbital module and a probe that sends back information about samples from the moon. 
The probe will be accompanied by three military satellites. According to the Russian news agency Interfax, the probe will be carried by the first rocket to blast off from Russia’s newly built facility in eastern Amur. The last time Russia successfully sent an unmanned probe to the moon was in the 1970s; Russia has yet to send a man to the moon.

'Goldenrod’ plant can respond to the scent of fruit flies
A study at Pennsylvania State University showed that solidago — commonly known as goldenrod — produces chemical defenses when it senses sex hormones released by male fruit flies. The plant releases an odor in response to repel female fruit flies, keeping them from laying their eggs on the goldenrod. 
This is beneficial to the plant’s reproduction, since those that harbor fruit fly eggs tend to produce fewer and smaller seeds. “... it seems that plants may sometimes be able to smell the insects themselves,” said Mark Mescher, an entomologist at Penn State.

New robotic fish can glide through water indefinitely
Scientists at Michigan State University constructed a robotic fish that glides through the water while using little to no energy. Its name is GRACE, which stands for Gliding Robot ACE, and it is 10 times smaller and lighter than other underwater gliders. It utilizes a hybrid mechanism of gliding and swimming.
Like an actual fish, GRACE has a bladder-like mechanism that pushes water in and out, allowing it to ascend and descend. GRACE gathers valuable data that aids the cleaning of rivers and lakes, and was recently released for a test run in the oil-contaminated Kalamazoo River.

British weigh in on ‘third parent’ fertility treatments
The British public was consulted about the ethics of fertility treatment that uses DNA from a third parent to eliminate genetic diseases. According to the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority, some of these diseases can have mild to no symptoms while others can have fatal or life-shortening symptoms. 
One in 200 children are born with mitochondrial disease and one in 6,500 British-born people suffer from severe symptoms. The proposed technique replaces mitochondrial DNA from the mother with healthy DNA from a “third parent.” Scientists and ethicists alike are concerned with future implicaions, such as the rights of the “third parent.”

Autistic children can improve, lose diagnosis with age
The National Institute of Health confirmed that some autistic children lose their diagnosis as they grow older. Deborah Fein, a professor at the University of Connecticut, paired 34 optimal-outcome children diagnosed with autism early in life with 44 children with high-functioning autism. 
Results showed the optimal-outcome children to have milder social deficits than the high-functioning autistic children. However, they had communication and behavioral problems that were just as severe of that in the latter group. Continuing studies may show whether it is the verbal IQ levels of the optimal-outcome children that caused their conditions to improve.

Newly discovered quasar challenges physical principle
Astronomers discovered a group of quasars so large that they would require 4 billion years to cross while traveling at the speed of light. This large quasar group has dimensions of 500 megaparsecs, each measuring 3.3 million light years. This makes it 1,600 times longer than the distance from the Milky Way to our closest galaxy.
Roger Clowes, leader of the team researching this large quasar group, will continue to investigate the phenomenon while challenging the perfect cosmological principle. It states that when viewed from a distance, one part of the universe looks just like any other part.

Pittsburgh has a rich legacy of music. From trumpeter Roy Eldridge to Poison’s Bret Michaels, the Steel City has been the birthplace of influential artists in a spectrum of musical genres.
Through music collectives like VIA, Humanaut, Obvious, and now DETOUR, that legacy has endured and taken electronic dance music (EDM) under its wing. Although these groups are distinct, they work toward a collective goal: to revitalize the city’s music scene and redefine how its people party.
DETOUR, the newest music collective, aims to bring cutting-edge house and techno music to its peers while exploring the intersection of sight and sound. The group is comprised of six individuals, most of whom are or were Carnegie Mellon students and all of whom are involved in Carnegie Mellon’s radio station WRCT. These music enthusiasts are eager to expose their fellow classmates to new music in a safe space.
The DETOUR crew:
- Alex Price, an IBM consultant, Carnegie   Mellon alumnus (TSB ’12), and general manager of WRCT, goes by Mr. Sensitivity when DJing and currently plays a lot of U.K. bass and house music. 
- Chloe Lula, a sophomore technical writing major, produces at WRCT and DJs tech house and techno. 
- Juan Lafontaine, a WRCT community DJ and one of the founders of SwitchboardPGH, goes by DJ Gusto and plays deep house and disco. 
- Mirko Azis, a senior design major, comes from a techno background and favors “harder, darker, more unforgiving music” when DJing.
- Naeem Martinez-White, a digital art studio intern at Carnegie Mellon, plays tech house, straight house, and disco. 
- Sharon Rubin, a junior architecture major, is the newest member of DETOUR and goes by DJ Shrubs.
“There was no definite start,” Azis said. “We were all members of the [WRCT] radio station and were throwing regular parties for that, but we were limited to the CMU market. Pittsburgh is a rising star in music and techno in particular, and we wanted to be a part of that.”
DETOUR’s intent is to bring house and techno to a college student audience — “democratizing the techno scene,” as Azis put it. At the same time, the group wants to connect the younger generation with older audiences. “Humanaut, for instance, draws a big audience but largely plays at 21-and-over venues, and that really frustrated me as an underage student,” Azis said.
While he was banned from the 21-and-over crowd as an underclassman, Azis and longtime friend Alex Price found solace in swanky techno-themed house parties at their loft. With great titles like “Shut the Fuck Up: A Forest Techno Party,” and “Nocturne: A Winter Solstice Gathering” and excellent music, the parties were a success.
Wanting to create a space where those ages 18 and over could enjoy electronic music, DETOUR decided to collaborate with VIA. Lauren Goshinski, VIA co-founder and director and marketing and communications manager in the Carnegie Mellon School of Art, allowed the group to host parties at the new VIA-operated event space on 6119 Penn Ave. “Lauren Goshinski has really helped us by letting us have the space for parties,” WRCT DJ and senior design major Mirko Azis said. “She just wants Pittsburgh to have a great time.”
Although the space is farther away from the Carnegie Mellon campus than many students would venture for a show, Azis says, “The space is a filter. If you can get to it, that means you really want to be there.” Because 6119 Penn Ave. is technically an event space, it has no official closing time; in fact, a few DETOUR parties have gone on until 4 a.m.
The group’s latest event, titled Poupon in honor of the featured DJ of the evening, was held on Saturday and ran from 9:30 p.m. to about 3 a.m.
Poupon, a DJ and producer native to Toronto, headlined the event and played to a lively crowd from midnight to the close of the show. Sitting on an orange couch in the back-room reserved for staff, wearing black jeans, a black T-shirt, and slicked back hair, Poupon explained the reason behind his name.
“My mom has a cousin who’s nickname is Poupon; in French it’s sort of like a nickname that means babyface,” Poupon said. “When I was deciding what to call myself, I was taking a ferry to Toronto Island and I saw a boat that was named Poupon. It made me think of my mom’s cousin, and y’know I’m a big food guy too so I just thought I’d go for it. Looking back I probably would have picked a different name, but I’m kind of stuck with it now.”
If audience members didn’t have an affinity for mustard before Poupon’s set, they most certainly did afterward. With Sharon Rubin and Chloe Lula opening for Poupon and Ben Tapas working the visuals, the crowd’s energy stayed high the entire night.
“A lot of clubs in the U.S. have a highly chauvinistic atmosphere; you go there to hook up or get drunk,” Azis said. “With the loft parties and now with DETOUR, we’ve tried to dispel that atmosphere. At DETOUR, people are respectful when they party, and that has something to do with the space, the culture of the city, and the music.”
Poupon, who has been DJing since 2006, agreed that the atmosphere of a space can make or break a show. “I started at house parties like these guys, started playing at parties and getting booked at clubs, and if the crowd is there with an open mind, it’ll be a great show,” Poupon said. “The ideal crowd is one where you can play a whole set of songs that they don’t know and they’ll still dance just as hard as if they did know them. I’ve played at some ‘bottle service’ clubs and it’s packed, but people aren’t interested. Everyone’s in their own little world: They’re on their phones or trying to pick up a chick at the bar. They’re not actually there for the music.”
Using the 6119 Penn Ave. space, DETOUR has tried to make each party it throws unique. The group finds an artist to create different visuals for each show, projecting the images or movies behind the DJ. “The thing with more conventional clubs is you walk in and it’s essentially the same party every week, just a different DJ,” Poupon said. “So I really like spaces that are multifunctional and don’t have a static design and décor.”
Tabas, a University of Pittsburgh alumnus with degrees in film, philosophy, and poetry, created the unusual triangle screens that hung behind the DJs at this Saturday’s DETOUR event. “I’m really bored with the idea of the screen — I think it engenders a passive viewership,” Tabas said. “For the Poupon show I wanted to shatter the screen and create a more engaging, jarring environment with video. We created a grid of triangles to look like the broken glass of a screen. I want the audience to think differently about the capacities of video — it doesn’t have to just be a square screen.”
The fluidity that each DETOUR show strives for allows “people to experience something new: an awesome DJ they haven’t heard before or a visual installation that makes them think differently about viewership and the capacities of video,” Tabas said. “That’s what’s really exciting about DETOUR, how fresh and innovative it is. Every event will look new and fresh.”
Although DETOUR is still in the beginning stages, the group has big plans for its future in Pittsburgh. “Juan and I have been really interested in transitioning DETOUR into our own record label,” Azis said. “It’s ambitious and would take time to incubate, but we would like it to become a platform for people to make music in Pittsburgh. In the next six months or so, we’re going to have a lot of events coming up, a couple co-branded with VIA and maybe Humanaut.”

To celebrate their parents’ wedding anniversary, people will usually take them out to dinner or give them a gift. But artist William T. Hillman decided to go a step further: He sponsored Yours Truly: Privately Collected Photographs, a photography exhibit at the Carnegie Museum of Art, in honor of his parents’ 67th wedding anniversary.
The exhibit is a collection of “some of the finest vintage photographic prints by some of the most admired photographers in the history of the medium,” according to an introduction by the museum’s director, Lynn Zelevansky, in a pamphlet provided to visitors. Indeed, the photographs are beautiful, and the clean design of the exhibit allows them to speak for themselves.
Unlike most exhibits, which have small plaques or labels accompanying each piece, these photographs only have small, nearly unnoticeable numbers quietly identifying them; visitors who want to know the title or photographer for each piece can check the provided pamphlet. That curatorial choice means that the true focus becomes neither the photographers nor the historical significance of the works, but rather the photographs themselves and the message of love that most of them convey.
Near the entrance to the exhibit, for instance, Herb Ritts’ “Fred and Tatjana 3, Guadalupe” (1988) hangs next to Danny Lyons’ “Uptown (Young Couple)” (1965). The former is a sharp, close shot of a couple cavorting on the beach, wherein every grain of sand is visible on the couple’s bodies as “Fred” kisses an enraptured Tatjana.
In contrast with this steamy affair in paradise, “Uptown (Young Couple)” features a far more ordinary scene. It shows a young couple at a home full of everyday knick-knacks, the woman’s hair still in curlers as the man leans in for a kiss. The pairing of the two photos creates a nice juxtaposition between the two types of love and reminds the viewer that everyday, domestic love is by no means less romantic or important than an island affair.
But to anyone reluctant about visiting an exhibit filled with image after image of embracing couples, fear not: As Zelevansky writes, “[The photographs] comprise a meditation on the nature of love in its many forms.” While romantic love may be the main focus of the exhibit, there are several different forms of love represented. Familial love takes center stage in “Mother and Daughter, Brighton Beach, New York” (1985) by Rosalind Solomon, and “Summer, the Lower East Side” (1937) by Weegee (Arthur Fellig) captures pure joy as gleeful children play in the spray from a fire hydrant.
There are some photographs that deviate from expressing any sort of love. Some work as a way to contextualize the other photographs: In one set of photographs, images of soldiers kissing their girlfriends goodbye at Penn Station in New York alternate with urban images of New York City from approximately the same time period. In another grouping of photographs, two landscape images help balance out images of people outside at the beach.
For a few of the photographs, the lack of accompanying explanatory text becomes problematic, as it was unclear as to why the photographs had been included in the exhibit. “Baby Beaton, Wanda Baille-Hamilton, Lady Bridget Poulett” (1920) by Cecil Walter Hardy Beaton portrays three women surrounded by what appear to be balloons, with no discernible connection to the exhibit’s theme.
However, these inexplicable deviations are, in the end, a minor flaw in an otherwise beautifully organized exhibit. Perhaps the most powerful examples of the exhibit’s message are the images selected to bookend the exhibit. The first photograph at the entrance of Yours Truly, “Paris 1949 New Year” by Robert Frank, shows a man holding a single tulip behind his back, ignoring passersby as he waits to surprise someone with the flower.
The exhibit’s last photograph is the only color photo in Yours Truly and the only image from the 21st century. It’s a framed copy of the Dec. 1, 2012 issue of the New York Times. The front page features a photograph by Brennan Linsley, in which a returning soldier fiercely kisses his tearful wife, their 14-month-old daughter looking on.
Anticipation in 1949, joyful reunion in 2012: There is no better way to prove that, as Hillman writes at the beginning of the exhibit, “True love is eternal.”
Yours Truly: Privately Collected Photographs will show at the Carnegie Museum of Art through March 10.

Most of you probably remember the Polaroid camera: the little box with a lens on top that, when you clicked the button, spat out a little white card that hip-hop duo Outkast liked to shake a little bit before an image magically appeared. It was a popular, easy-to-use device that would eventually be phased out by the development of digital photography and mostly forgotten by the public. But artist Jeremy Kost is one person whose Polaroid camera isn’t sitting in a mountain of trash alongside your dad’s Sony Walkman and VHS copies of Beauty and the Beast.
Over the past few years, Kost has made a name for himself with his Polaroid camera, snapping images of everything from New York nightlife to celebrities and fashion models. For his first solo museum exhibit titled Friends With Benefits, which is on display at The Andy Warhol Museum, Kost turned his little box with a lens on top to a group of Pittsburgh drag performers.
Almost exclusively displayed through Polaroid photograph collages, the exhibit is truly something else. The use of Polaroid images makes each photo feel distinctly human. Kost’s lens captures joy and sorrow, confidence and insecurity, and the undercurrent of anger in the eyes and faces of those he photographs.
Kost’s photos raise questions on the nature of gender, beauty, and identity, and explore how mainstream America treats those who are different. The piece “Mirror, Mirror,” which depicts two drag queens in full makeup in front of a stone wall topped with barbed wire, illustrates the division in America regarding these ideas and the “wall” that is put up between the opposing viewpoints. A video in the exhibit depicts two performers going through their pre-show routine, applying the layers of mascara and wigs required for them to become their other selves. Or are they transforming from someone else into someone they really are?
Among these pieces of art, one gets a sense of the fluidity of sexuality and beauty and the looseness of these terms. Kost sees a beauty in these people who must turn to each other because no one else wants them. Underneath the painted faces and corsets, one can see that drag queens are just people with their own ideas about beauty and gender — people who believe that they are free to form their own identity.
The centerpiece of the exhibit, titled “Friends With Benefits (Communing With Andy),” is a large collage that encompasses nearly an entire wall of the room and depicts a number of the drag performers collected around the grave of Andy Warhol. Kost — who is frequently compared to Warhol and counts the pop art innovator as a major influence — may be making a statement in the spirit of his predecessor: Life comes in many colorful forms, as illustrated by the colorful drag queens against a backdrop of gray headstones and dying grass. Kost seems to say that we should celebrate this diversity rather than forcing everyone into drab, gray uniformity.
Kost’s camera captures these outsiders, who at first look almost twisted and macabre, with great humanity and understanding. This affection prompts viewers to remember that, underneath it all, the subjects of all of Kost’s photographs are just people who want to be whoever they want to be.
Friends With Benefits is on display at The Andy Warhol Museum through Sunday.

For the professional actor, it’s rare and exciting to find a role that unites both commercial and artistic success. But Carnegie Mellon alumnus Devin Ilaw (CFA ’07) believes he’s found that role.
Since graduating with a BFA in acting and musical theatre in 2007, Ilaw has landed a couple of major gigs, playing Thuy in Miss Saigon and appearing on Late Night with Conan O’Brien.
But his role as Marius in the PNC Broadway Across America tour of Les Misérables, which is now playing at the Benedum Center in Pittsburgh, is by far the most significant.
Thomas Douglas, Ilaw’s former vocal coach and an associate teaching professor of voice at Carnegie Mellon, had confidence in him from the onset. While working with Ilaw on a School of Drama project, “it was clear to me then, that he was a very special young man,” Douglas said in an email. “I’m not at all surprised to hear of his varied successes in the professional world.”
As an actor on a Broadway tour, Ilaw must undertake a daunting task every time he arrives in a new city. According to him, the actors on tour never have time to rehearse in the theater where they actually perform — aside from the sound check that occurs only two hours before the show.
Surprisingly, Ilaw is able to take this challenge in stride. “It’s less nerve-wracking,” he said in an interview. “It’s more that you learn to trust the people around you. Trust your show, trust the theater.”
The traditional Broadway favorite has recently garnered even more attention because of last month’s release of the film adaptation. Les Misérables tells the story of criminal-turned-mayor Jean Valjean and his efforts to evade the pursuit of a vindictive policeman, set against the tragic backdrop of the French Revolution. In the Broadway Across America production, Ilaw plays Marius, a young revolutionary who falls in love with Valjean’s adoptive daughter.
Despite having spent more than five years in the professional acting business, Ilaw still attributes many of the skills he uses onstage to his School of Drama education. “The program is so grueling, it teaches you to be everything and anything,” he said. “It taught me how to be an artist.” Malleability as an actor is a fundamental skill he learned at Carnegie Mellon and continues to use in his pursuits as a professional actor.
Ilaw uses those skills every time he gets onstage to keep his performances fresh and interesting for his audience. But breathing life into each performance isn’t just for the audience’s sake. For Ilaw, it’s crucial that actors continuously engage with their roles: “As an artist, you don’t want to be bored.”
Ilaw further underscored the importance of constant discovery for young actors. “Make new discoveries all the time,” he urged. Part of the wonder of interacting with fellow actors, Ilaw said, is not only making discoveries about yourself, but also seeing new qualities in other actors. “Try to find those epiphanies,” he said — then, correcting himself: “Try to allow the epiphanies to happen.”
Ilaw believes the best epiphanies happen when the true qualities of an actor shine through in a performance. He prides himself in particular on “always bringing myself to a role … finding elements of me in a character.” In this way, Ilaw urges young actors to “be true to yourself” — to allow personal qualities to emerge both onstage and off, whether in character or not.
However, Ilaw doesn’t rely solely on himself for guidance in a role. In his role as Marius, he draws heavily from the Victor Hugo novel, upon which the musical is based, for inspiration and affirmation. He carries a brown, worn, leather-bound notebook filled with quotes from the book and other notes, which he occasionally pulls out for reference. “I always go back to the book,” he said.
Although Ilaw is proud of certain aspects of his work, he still strives to challenge himself in other areas. As an artist, Ilaw said, “It’s hard to be happy with your work.” While to an extent, Ilaw does consider himself a perfectionist, he recognizes the need for imperfection in acting: “Perfection is not interesting.” Just as a character’s flaws in a play or musical compel the audience, an actor’s imperfections add variety and spice onstage. Moving forward, Ilaw’s goals are simple: “Stay positive, stay happy, and keep myself artistically challenged.”
Looking to the future, he is casually optimistic; rather than pointing to specific career goals, Ilaw said he “can’t wait to see where the path is going to lead” — emphasizing that “I often let the path lead me.”
And overall, Ilaw is happy — especially with his current role in Les Misérables. “Commercial success doesn’t equal artistic success, but the hope is that they come together,” Ilaw said. “_Les Mis_ really is it.”

Finding yourself in a fashion rut? If you’re uninspired by the fashion that surrounds you, a great way to find new ideas is to follow the style of the rich and famous. Celebrities are known for inspiring trends, and some are even defined by the way they dress.
The task of deciding which celebrities to imitate can seem daunting, since there are so many out there. This decision depends on your personal style. For some guidance, here is an overview of how three famous fashionistas dress and some tips on how to emulate their unique styles.
The first of these celebrities is a talented singer whose relationships are a constant focus not just for the media, but also for her music: Taylor Swift. Just as the genre of her music has been changing, Swift’s style has evolved a great deal over the past couple of months. Although her outfits could initially be described as vaguely preppy and vintage-inspired, sometimes with a bohemian influence, she has learned to successfully combine these elements to create her own look.
She is commonly seen wearing stripes, in the form of navy and white dresses and tops. In fact, an outfit pictured on the Taylor Swift Style blog features a dress such as the one described, paired with knee-high socks and oxfords.
Swift also seems to be a fan of sweaters, in styles ranging from the classic cable knit to the famous fox sweater that launched the quirky animals-on-sweaters trend. She usually wears these sweaters with jeans or pleated skirts. Blazers, blouses with Peter Pan collars, and patterned tights and jeans are other clothing items that embody Swift’s style. In terms of handbags, she is usually seen carrying a satchel.
Although she shares Swift’s penchant for preppy style, Harry Potter actress Emma Watson has a collection that is slightly classier and more sophisticated. Her most recent outfits almost always feature a scarf thrown over a sweater, worn with jeans and a pair of ballet flats. Watson is also skilled at adapting her floral skirts and summer dresses for the winter by pairing them with warm sweaters, tights, and boots in darker colors.
She seems to have embraced the recent trend of wearing shorts with tights; she was seen wearing this combination with a striped T-shirt and ballet flats while leaving a Starbucks on a sunny day in March of last year. She often adds an edge to more basic outfits with a leather jacket, as seen on dresslikeemma.net.
The style of the edgier fashions of Swift and Watson may not appeal to everyone; some may prefer the stud and cutout trends that became popular last year. Although she’s generally been off the radar since her dramatic haircut, Miley Cyrus is known for her edgy style. She tends to wear crop tops quite often, as seen on stealherstyle.net in which she pairs a gray cropped sweater with bright blue jeans, a varsity bomber jacket, and black Doc Martens.
Keeping with the edgy trend, a great deal of Cyrus’ outfits feature clothing embellished with studs and cutouts. She frequently incorporates graphic T-shirts or sweatshirts, as well as patterned leggings, as seen in pictures via Twitter that were also posted on the Steal Her Style website.
While celebrity style can be a great source of fashion inspiration, make sure you maintain some individuality. Mix and match the clothing items represented by the celebrity whose style inspires you for a look that’s all your own. Start with a basic striped T-shirt, jeans, and add a pair of oxfords to make it in the style of Swift. To emulate Watson’s style, switch the oxfords for ballet flats, and throw on a blazer and a scarf over the T-shirt. And finally, for fashion inspired by Cyrus, change your footwear again — this time in favor of Doc Martens — and swap the blazer and scarf for an oversized cardigan.

After 27 years of music making, there is really only one question that accompanies the release of a new Yo La Tengo album: Will this be the Yo La Tengo that thrives in guitar freak-outs and stylistic eclecticism, or the Yo La Tengo that meticulously crafts gentle, quiet, introspective love songs? Regarding Fade, Yo La Tengo’s 13th album, the answer is a lot less trivial than it initially appears.
On first listen, Fade seems to fall into the latter category. The album as a whole radiates serenity, even on the energetic high-point song “Well You Better.” Probably the tightest song on the album, it features almost-laconic sounding vocals from Ira Kaplan, perseverating on relationship issues over a looping rhythm section and off-kilter “wah-wahs.” Songs like “I’ll Be Around” and “Two Trains” most wholly capture the same hushed, late-night-car-ride atmosphere that Yo La Tengo has been channeling since the release of And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out.
It’s tempting to simply call Fade the logical successor to And Then Nothing and Summer Sun, but frankly it’s not. The stylistic assimilation and subtle instrumentation changes in Fade signal not simply a retread of the band’s post-2000 output, but an integration of the soft Yo La Tengo with the loud Yo La Tengo.
This can be seen from the very beginning of the album. “Ohm” begins with a percussive groove before Kaplan begins singing and adding in some reverbed guitar. Over the course of the song, the amount of feedback and noise gradually builds before becoming the most prevalent aspect of the song, which transforms not only the sound of the song but the implications of the lyrics. The phrase “So say good night to me / And lose no more time / No time / Resisting the flow” is repeated throughout the sonic dissonance. The significance changes from narrative to an anchor of familiarity in the midst of an ever-changing soundscape.
Unfortunately, Fade does not feature any of the long-form experimental tracks that have been a hallmark of the Yo La Tengo sound, which is part of the reason that this is the band’s shortest release since Fakebook in the 1990s. The noisy, extended jams of the band’s earlier albums were always captivating and rarely bloated. While the absence of these longer trackers from Fade is more than a bit disappointing, the focus on shorter, more self-contained songs has resulted in one of the indie stalwart’s most cohesive, consistent albums to date.
Fade is much like Dinosaur Jr.’s I Bet on Sky and The Mountain Goats’ Transcendental Youth in that there are no real surprises here. That is not only okay, but almost preferable. Yo La Tengo may have passed its creative apex, but the quality of its music has not decreased. This album is Yo La Tengo at the most comfortable it’s ever been with itself, and the fact that the band is still making enjoyable and exciting music after 27 years is venerable.
Even though this band was a key factor in shaping indie rock and the culture of college radio stations, it has never broken through to the mainstream. You probably won’t hear any of the album’s songs on the radio, but the legacy of the band that made it will outlast most any other artist currently making music.

Trunk splitters, root hooks, and concave cutters, oh my! The Orchid and Tropical Bonsai Show, which opened Jan. 12 at Phipps Conservatory, offers guests the chance to do much more than just observe orchids and bonsai trees. The exhibit includes information on the history and location of these plants, the science and techniques behind how they are grown, and opportunities to grow your own at Phipps.
Bonsai is the Japanese art of training small trees to take on the shape and style of their larger counterparts that occur in nature. The word “bonsai” can be broken down into “bon,” which means “tray or lowsided pot,” and “sai,” which means “a plant or plantings.” These miniature trees emulate some trees that have spent hundreds of years in the wind, and others that stand upright with twisting, far-reaching, above-ground roots.
The “Sunken Garden” room is filled with a variety of miniature bonsai trees, including the willow fig leaf, Japanese pittosporum, and Chinese banyan, among many others. The small trees all look vastly different and give guests the chance to see different styles of bonsai trees up close. Bonsai artists in the area worked on some of the trees, other trees were gifts to Phipps, and some were used in previous exhibits. The variation in size, style, age, and technique makes exploring the room both educational and entertaining. The final part of the exhibit explains the basics of bonsai, such as what tools are used and how the trees are made to look the way they do.
The orchids in the show are spread far and wide throughout Phipps. Some are integrated into existing exhibits in the form of hanging baskets and small planters. Others are planted directly into the exhibits, along with informational and educational placards to teach guests more about these brightly colored plants. For example, did you know that orchids grow on every continent except Antarctica? Or that they are the largest and most varied family of flowering plants in the world? Or that there are over 30,000 known species of orchids?
Laboratory equipment is on display in order to show patrons how the plants are engineered to have different colors, be different sizes, or even bloom in different shapes. The combination of home-grown and lab-grown orchids exposes guests to a wide variety of the plants in many different contexts. 
The bright pinks, purples, and yellows of the orchids juxtapose nicely with the rich greens and browns of the bonsai trees. Just as the colors complement each other, so do the different techniques for growing each type of plant.
The choice to combine these two exhibits into one show makes for an educational and visually appealing stroll through Phipps Conservatory. And should either art form interest you, the classes for growing bonsai and tips for growing orchids offer guests the chance to engage more fully with the exhibit. Overall, the show has something to offer everyone — be it gardening tips, scientific exploration, or just the opportunity to admire beautiful plants.
The Orchid and Tropical Bonsai Show is on display at Phipps Conservatory through Feb. 24.

The Pomegranate, a new dining choice on campus this semester, specializes in Middle Eastern fare. It can be found on the second floor of the University Center in the General Motors Dining Room — known to students as "the room across from Schatz Dining Room" — which overlooks the swimming pool. The Pomegranate is open 11 a.m.-8 p.m. Monday through Thursday and 11 a.m.-2:30 p.m. on Fridays.
The eatery takes up an important role on campus by being the only venue that offers solely kosher food. As its website explains, the food is “prepared at the Kosher kitchen located in Beth Salom Congregation ... under the strict supervision of Rabbi Michael Werbow.”
Not only is The Pomegranate a good choice for those who prefer to eat kosher, it is also simply good food. Among hot entrees are chicken shawarma, chicken kebab, and falafel. Each is stuffed in pockets of pita bread, along with hummus and a tzatziki sauce containing cubed tomatoes, cucumbers, and yogurt. Extra pita bread can be used to scoop up creamy hummus that comes as a side on a block. Those who prefer their entrées cold can choose among commonplace salads and sandwiches, although only the hot entrées at The Pomegranate offer the true charms of Middle Eastern fare.
The chicken shawarma is by far the most promising dish at the eatery. The aroma of cumin and its tender texture suggest that the chicken was marinated before being cooked and shredded into thin strands. The chicken kebab was less spicy and slightly harder to chew, though a char reminiscent of coal barbecue gives it a smoky, intriguing flavor. The falafel was the least tasty of all — too small, too dry, and also quite cold. The pita bread also needs improvement — it felt cold and stale and sadly pulled the high quality fillings down.
If you're looking for kosher or Middle Eastern food — or are simply weary of campus dining choices this spring — trying out The Pomegranate would be a good idea. Not only is it the best interpretation of Middle Eastern fare on and around campus, it is also a healthier option for students, offering a vegetarian option and a spicy complexity. It leaves no need for large portions.

Dear Patrick,
I have two roommates — let’s call them “Sam” and “Bruce.” Recently, Bruce claimed Sam is a more considerate roommate than I am. That’s a bunch of bull. I’m very considerate. I’m so considerate that I take a moment every couple of days just to stop and say to myself, “Wow, that was really thoughtful of you.” How can I make Bruce admit this? Sam has a smug look on his face.
Thanks,
Requesting Opportunities Of Majorly Improving Esteem
Dear ROOMIE,
We’re gonna get considerate all up in here. Order some delicious food, and then put it in some pots and pans so it looks like you just cooked it. Then say, “Oh, hey Bruce. I made all this delicious food, and I can’t eat it all myself. Would you like some?” Still not enough? Wait until five minutes before he gets home, and then start vacuuming somewhere prominent. “Oh, hey Bruce. Didn’t see you there. I was just doing some of my weekly cleaning.” Or, “Oh, hey Bruce. I just got this Groupon to the strip club across the street. I have to do homework all night, but the coupon is expiring! Why don’t you check it out and take all these singles with you?” Instantly most considerate roommate.
Or just keep not being considerate. That’s a lot easier,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
I’m a fan of going out to bars and dancing all night long. After so many years of dance lessons, I have some pretty sweet moves. The only problem is that the ladies seem to disagree. I break out my best moves, and they just head for the hills. Why don’t they like my hip gyrations?
Thanks,
Lack Effortless Feet Tapping, Females Evading Every Time
Dear LEFT FEET,
Okay, let’s start with the basics. Step to your left, then your right. Repeat. Now, form fists with your hands and extend your pointer fingers. Wave them around in the air. If you want to mix it up, try holding a beer in one hand. If you’re feeling crazy, you can close your eyes and wave your head around, and if you’re limber enough, bounce in the air a little bit.
Once you’ve gotten everyone’s attention, it’s time to start dancing with someone. First, find someone you like. Then, awkwardly sidle up to them. Avoid eye contact at all costs. That way, you come off as mysterious. If things are going well, then dance around them in a circle like a leprechaun around his pot of gold. Guaranteed success; it never fails.
Actually it fails a lot,
Patrick Hoskins

Over winter break, one of my friends downloaded a bunch of one-hit wonders. It did not take long, however, to find that someone decided that gems such as “Who Let the Dogs Out?” and “Cotton-Eyed Joe” needed remixes.
These remixes were not just bad — there was also no new perspective gained from listening to them. There was barely anything about the songs that was altered; hi-hats, bass, and synths were simply added on top of the songs with some minor equalizer manipulation. It was the musical equivalent of using Microsoft Paint to do photo manipulation.
Good remixes have a lot in common with good song covers: They maintain the most essential aspects of the song, provide a new perspective, and show an appreciation of the source material. For example, I was never a fan of Lady Gaga’s “Yoü and I.” However, after hearing Wild Beasts’ remix of it, I changed my opinion.
Wild Beasts’ remix stripped away almost every element of the song, leaving a vocal loop of Lady Gaga singing, “This time we made love / This time baby you and I,” over sampled loops taken directly from the song. The only addition the band makes is singer Hayden Thorpe moaning over parts of the song. The two layers of the song could not sound any more different. Wild Beasts stripped away the theatricality, the radio-pop polish, and the schmaltzy country-rock ballad feel. They left listeners with the soul of the song: sexual longing and the torture of being separated from a loved one.
It’s easy to discredit remixes as a legitimate art form because it’s not terribly difficult to make one. But artistic vision is necessary to make a remix worth listening to. Although there are enough mediocre dubstep remixes of pop songs to make one lose faith in remix culture, it’s important to remember that if you just keep looking hard enough, you’ll probably find a remix that will remind you why you started looking for them in the first place.

End of Watch
8 10 12
End of Watch is one of the more thrilling cop films released in recent years. Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña star in this portrait of two buddies in the LAPD. Writer and director David Ayer is probably best known for The Fast and the Furious and Training Day, but End of Watch proves to be his most impressive project. Gyllenhaal and Peña play patrol officers who get tangled up in some nasty South Central gang violence.
To Be Heard
6
In lieu of running an AB Films selection, the English department has organized a screening of To Be Heard, the debut documentary from Edwin Martinez. According to the Carnegie Mellon University Lecture Series website, “_To Be Heard_ follows the life journey of three best friends who met in a high school poetry class in the Bronx, and make a pact to always support each other. Yet, when everything starts to go wrong and the road toward their childhood dreams becomes more perilous than ever, their hopes for the future and the strength of their friendship are put to the ultimate test.”
Argo
8 10 12
Ben Affleck chooses some flashy Oscar bait for his third directorial feature. After turning in some legitimately impressive work with Gone Baby Gone and The Town, Affleck directs and stars in Argo, a thoughtless but intense political thriller. The movie is loosely based on the Canadian Caper, a historical event during which the CIA faked a Hollywood production to extract six near-hostages from revolutionary Iran. The film succeeds in direct proportion to how much it follows history, finding great moments in its outlandish, stylish suspense but failing when trying to milk the relevance cow.
The Good Shepherd
6 9 12
Ben Affleck’s buddy, Matt Damon, stars in The Good Shepherd, another (albeit very different) story that misattributes several things to the CIA. Damon turns in a spectacular performance in this muddy historical tracing of the CIA. However historically dubious it may be, Robert De Niro’s direction makes The Good Shepherd a top-shelf political thriller for the first hour. The script eventually bogs itself down in the fathers-failing-sons metaphor, but still maintains a solid level of juice. The film is worth it for Damon’s performance alone, which is possibly the finest of his career.

The dean’s opening statement at a school-wide assembly was, “The great question is not whether ours is better or worse than other schools, but is it the best that we can make it....There is the Cornell type, the MIT type. What is to be the Carnegie type?” So 100 years later, what has the “Carnegie type” become?

A contracting worker was killed after suffering electrocution while working on campus Tuesday.
It was later reported that the worker was Harold Taylor Jr., a 59 year-old man from the Mt. Oliver neighborhood of Pittsburgh, who worked for Eaton Electrical Company.
The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports that Taylor was working in Wean Hall at the time of the accident, that a 911 call was placed at 10:20 a.m., and that he was pronounced dead on the scene a half-hour later.
University spokesperson Ken Walters commented to the Post-Gazette that the incident was "industrial accident" and released no further details. 
The University attempted to alert students to event, but the CMU Alert System text message sent to the student body contained varying typographical errors which differed among recipients. One such text read “G¿¿¿ in Wean Hall responding to an isolated incident involving an individuaX¿¿¿orking with an outside contractor. There is no cause for evacuation or other precaution.”
Later in the day, Vice President for Campus Affairs Michael Murphy sent an email to the Carnegie Mellon community specifying that the accident occurred on the second floor of Wean Hall. “I know you join me in keeping the victim, his family and friends, and his colleagues in our thoughts and prayers,” he said. Murphy declined to share the personal information of the victim in his email.  
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration is investigating this incident.

Carnegie Mellon students and staff have come together to test out a new composting program at Tazza D’Oro.
The program, part of the zero-waste composting project at Carnegie Mellon, placed a bin at Tazza D’Oro Café and Espresso Bar. Customers now have the option of composting their food and biodegradable utensils.
Tazza D’Oro was chosen to pilot the program, organizers said, because it already uses some biodegradable cups, utensils, and containers.
This is not the first composting initiative to hit Carnegie Mellon.
“The food composting has really seemed to be something faculty, students, and staff are interested in,” Carnegie Mellon Facilities Management Services (FMS) Environmental Coordinator Barbara Kviz said. 
“We just rolled out 11 new departmental composting programs. In FMS, we put our coffee grounds [in composting]. We’ve been doing it now for well over a year.”
There are also several zero-waste events held on campus. According to Kviz and senior visual arts major Chloe Newman, one of the composting project’s organizers, the Almost Midnight Breakfast, the university staff picnic, and the homecoming chili cookoff have all been zero-waste events in the past.
“All of the cutlery, all of the food is compostable, and we have special compostable green bags at the event,” Newman said.
Tazza D’Oro’s composting program is different from most previous composting at Carnegie Mellon because it is postconsumer. Preconsumer composting is done by trained workers during and after food preparation, while postconsumer composting is done by customers by their own initiative after they have purchased their food.
The major obstacle to postconsumer composting, according to the project’s organizers, is the lack of consumer education.
“We’re still in a phase where people need to be educated,” Kviz said. 
“There’s so many kinds of plastics, it’s confusing to know what can be composted and what can’t.”
Organizers have sought volunteers to stand by the composting bin and help customers to compost correctly, but so far turnout has been low.
“It’s hard to talk to people without any reason, to approach a stranger,” said senior statistics major and former Sustainable Earth member Chris Conte, one of the project’s organizers. “A lot of people don’t care, they just want to get rid of their trash. I think the best way to change that is to educate people at freshmen orientation.”
One concern is the potential for contamination of composting bins. The university is charged extra for every bag of compost contaminated beyond a certain point, and Conte said contamination is already a problem on campus.
“You could look at any recycling bin in the buildings, and there’s a lot of contamination,” he said.
One solution, according to Conte and Newman, is to make composting a little bit difficult — for instance, by putting lids on the bins while garbage cans are open — so as to dissuade people who don’t know what they’re doing from contaminating the composting bins.
“Once the compost bins are in place everywhere, then we can work on student behavior and getting people to compost correctly,” Conte said.
But Newman said she has seen people change their minds at the spur of the moment and decide to compost.
“It’s kind of funny to see them stop and take that extra second,” she said.
A list of compostable products can be found at bpiworld.org.

At Carnegie Mellon, we see students working terribly hard just to get that A. But do grades make students happy, or is it the learning process that matters in the long run? 
David Kosbie, assistant teaching professor of computer science, addressed this question in a talk he gave on the second day of Carnegie Mellon’s Odyssey program, Jan. 11. 
The talk, an invite-only event held in Baker Hall’s Adamson Wing, was attended by about 100 sophomores from various departments, including some from students from Carnegie Mellon’s Qatar campus.
Kosbie began by stating he was no expert on happiness, but just a “well-informed layperson.” He related his experiences as an applied mathematics undergraduate at Harvard. 
After a year of struggling hard but performing poorly he realized that hard work alone without any heed to health and social interactions, was the wrong method for success. He encouraged students to look to their peers for support, academic or otherwise.
Relating this to Carnegie Mellon students, Kosbie went on to say that to remain happy at Carnegie Mellon, students should try to eat healthy food and sleep well. He also encouraged students to get regular exercise. He stressed the importance of socializing, especially through in-person interactions, as opposed to communication through electronic media or over the Internet. 
The message of student happiness and well-being especially resonated with sophomore decision science major Tonya Sedgwick, who remarked, “When he said that instructors care about the students, I could see how he sincerely meant it.”
Kosbie then related a few incidents from his employment at Microsoft prior to coming to teach at Carnegie Mellon. He assured the audience that some of the richest people he’d met in the computer science industry were among the unhappiest people he has ever met. 
He affirmed that although you do need some amount of money to live a comfortable life, there comes a point where the more money you earn, the unhappier you get. “Not one person in this room must make decisions based on money alone,” he said.
In addition to the lecture format of his talk, Kosbie also used audience participation activities to emphasize his points. At one point, Kosbie engaged students in a four-minute meditation exercise to emphasize the importance of meditation in generating a sense of inner happiness. 
Kosbie also asked students to try some mental exercises intended to demonstrate that multitasking is less than half as efficient as doing the different tasks separately. Kosbie believes that doing away with multitasking while doing homework can help students save time and be happier.
Kosbie wrapped up his talk by assuring the students that faculty care about them and highly value student feedback on making academic life less stressful. 
He asked the students to come up with ideas that would make coursework less stressful; he promised to implement much of the feedback into his popular course 15–112 Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science. 
One of the suggestions brought up which reached a huge consensus among the audience was allowing students to repeat a course to improve their grade and that the most recent grade should completely replace the older grade for that course. 
Arjun Hans, a sophomore computer science major, was impressed with the talk and Kosbie’s devotion to improving student life. “It’s really awesome when a professor takes such a keen interest in the students’ welfare,” he said. 
Kosbie encouraged the audience to implement his suggestions to bring happiness to their daily lives, at Carnegie Mellon and beyond.

The familiar brown apartment building located on 214 S. Craig St. has recently become home to KBox, a karaoke house and business venture. 
It’s purpose is to strengthen the Asian community of Pittsburgh.
The idea of the karaoke house was conceived in the fall of 2011 in Finger Lakes, New York, when 12 Chinese students — nine from Carnegie Mellon and three from University of Pittsburgh — were brainstorming a place in which Chinese students in need of a cultural haven could gather. 
What began as an effort to gather Chinese students evolved into an attempt to bring together students from all Asian countries. 
One year later, their idea came to life through the founding of KBox.
Inside the KBox building, rooms are decked with the latest sound systems, plush couches, and LCD TVs.
One of the co-founders, Huiman Tan — a Ph.D student in engineering and public policy — wanted a place where “Chinese students can gather, socialize, relax, re-connect with their culture.”
Other co-founders include ’11 alumna Min Luo, information management systems master’s student Pei Xiong, master’s student in the Language Technologies Institute Duo Ding, Ph.D. student in the Robotics Institute Hua Zhong, and Ph.D. student in the Language and Technologies Insititute Long Qin.  
“Students from China find it difficult to make friends in the U.S.,” said Tan. “They seek other Chinese students and familiar sources of entertainment.... So we came up with KBox, because Chinese people love to sing, and creating a place where they can gather to do that makes it easy for Chinese students to meet other Chinese students.”
The rest of the co-founders agreed with Tan that Carnegie Mellon’s Chinese Scholar and Student Association was not enough of a social hub for them to interact with other Chinese students, since they only “organized parties dedicated to major, traditional Chinese holidays.”
After a trial opening in August 2012, KBox officially opened up to the public on Sept. 16, and is now a growing business venture.
Their mission statement is to “create an entertainment house where students from all cultural backgrounds can gather to sing in private karaoke rooms,” Tan said.
“With more than 90k songs — 76k Chinese songs and 15k English songs and 8k Korean songs — we hope to make it a haven not just for Asian students but also for students who just want to blow off steam.”
Coming up with the idea of a karaoke house was only the first step.
After solidifying their idea, the founders had to find a location for a karaoke house, buy a building, receive a building permit, and find a contractor.
Having found a house on Craig Street after three months of searching, the co-founders then faced problems receiving a zoning permit from the Pittsburgh Bureau of Building Inspection, a necessary requirement for opening business in the building. 
Tan said that the trouble with receiving a zoning permit which lasted for two months was enough of a dilemma for her co-founders and her to think that “their project would be killed.”
According to Tan, the founders had issues with Oakland’s building inspectors, since there weren’t enough hired inspectors to check all of the buildings in the area, including theirs. After research in building codes, Zhong “was able to argue his way with the license officer to get a license for starting a business in their building on South Craig Street,” Tan said.
“[KBox] had no money to hire lawyers like other big entrepreneurs, so Zhong studied [the] building codes of several states.... It took a lot of effort, research, and perseverance for Zhong to get a license to set up a karaoke house in our building,” Tan said.
They continued to face more issues with the building, they needed to find a cheap contractor in Pittsburgh who could rebuild the interior of the rundown building. 
“Despite most of us being computer science majors, we designed the building plan and submitted it to our contractor. We did everything, from the soundproof walls to the interior decorating. We raised a total of 20K, which came from our pockets to redesign the interior,” Tan said.
In regards to future plans, Tan said, “We plan on expanding KBox to take on partnerships with local Asian restaurants in Squirrel Hill, as well as extending sponsorship outside of CMU. We also want to attract a larger population of students from other schools like Pitt and Duquesne; that way, there will be a wider web of connections.”
When asked whether KBox seems like a good social hub for students, first-year decision science major Steven Wang, a Chinese-American student, said, “Yeah, I think KBox is a good place to reconnect with your cultural roots if you’re Chinese since you can meet up with other Chinese friends, but at the same time I would go to KBox just to sing even if I wasn’t Chinese.”
When asked if KBox added to diversifying Chinese community life on campus, first-year computer science and math double major Jichao Sun said, “It seems unique. It’s not your average Chinese student association club.”
KBox hopes to continue expanding their business in order to attract people who want to sing American, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese music. 
“We now wish to popularize KBox to all students and not just Asian students,” Tan said.

Frank Pfenning, professor of computer science, is the new head of the computer science department. Pfenning succeeds Jeannette Wing, who stepped down to become the head of Microsoft Research International.
Pfenning says that he was initially hesitant to take on the job because it meant giving up a lot of teaching and research, both of which he enjoys. “In some ways, I thought, ‘I have the ideal job, so why change?’ ” However, on the insistence of faculty members, who assured him that he was the best person for the job, he agreed to accept the position.
“A lot of things in this job are centered around people, and I like talking to people, working with people, and supporting them in what they need to do, making sure they can get the right conditions for whatever they want to do.... Those are the things that I really enjoy and think I can be fairly effective at,” Pfenning said. 
However, there are a few things Pfenning is not entirely  looking forward to. “Well, I haven’t really had the big budget meeting. Figuring out the numbers and the balance of the budget. At home, my wife does our checkbook,” he said. 
Regarding his research and the effects of his new job on it, Pfenning said, “The way I’m trying to do it is to essentially reduce the number of projects that I’m involved in, rather than just cutting back on 25 percent of each of the things that I do.” 
He plans to remain highly invested in two main projects. The first is a project with some faculty in Qatar, which involves developing frameworks for reasoning about programming languages. 
He will also remain involved with a group in Portugal that is working on developing a programming language that can easily prove properties of concurrent and distributed programs.
When asked whether he will continue to teach, Pfenning said, “I love teaching too much to completely do away with it.” 
He has developed and taught the courses Principles of Imperative Computation (15–122), which is an integral part of the recently revised undergraduate computer science curriculum, Compiler Design (15–411), and Constructive Logic (15–317). 
He also played a key role in the development of Fundamentals of Programming Languages (15–312) alongside Robert Harper.
Apart from his work, Pfenning enjoys playing squash and hiking. He is also an avid reader and especially enjoys classic literature and mysteries. 
When asked to share some learning from his experiences, Pfenning said, “People tend to make this drastic distinction between arts and sciences. I feel that they have much more in common than not. Both are human enterprises of understanding and communication.”
“Success in both is predicated upon creativity. Doing research and writing a scientific paper is analogous to writing and shooting a movie, for example. Writing a small and elegant program is like writing a poem,” he said.
His message to students who are looking to decide on career options is that they follow their passion, remain proud to serve, and maintain a balance in their lives, in order to be happier and more productive.

Just as last semester drew to a close, University President Jared Cohon became the victim of a threat, which resulted in Pittsburgh Police protecting his house for 24 hours. 
According to a report by the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, Pittsburgh Police Deputy Chief Paul Donaldson stated that a threat against President Cohon was received on Dec. 6, 2012, adding that police cars had been stationed outside of Cohon’s house in response.
There was the fear that the man who threatened Cohon may have been heading to Pittsburgh in a car bearing a Massachusetts license plate.
The threat was thought to have been received through the mail. The Trib reported that the Postal Inspector’s office is also involved in the investigation.
The University has been reluctant to release details on the matter. 
Teresa Thomas, Carnegie Mellon’s assistant vice president for media relations, declined to comment on the matter to media sources.

Another chapter in the ongoing clash between those who would like to see a free and open Internet and those who wish to regulate it came to a tragic end on Jan. 11 when programmer and prominent activist Aaron Swartz took his own life.
Swartz appeared to be under a great deal of stress due to pressure from the federal government. He allegedly hacked into networks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and downloaded 4.8 million documents from JSTOR, a database of academic publications that many students here at Carnegie Mellon are familiar with. 
I’d also wager that a lot of people here are familiar with one of Swartz’s other pet projects, Reddit, which one of his start-ups merged with.
Swartz’s suicide does not change the fact that what he allegedly did was illegal, and I can’t bring myself to fully endorse his methods.
I agree wholeheartedly that scholarly journals should be free and open to the public, but circumventing the proper channels to meet these ends does little to further the cause. There can be a fine line between protest and breaking the law. If only the line were easier to judge, perhaps Swartz might be alive today.
Another thing to consider while dissecting this case is if the government is in any way to blame for driving Swartz to his demise. According to Think Progress, a liberal blog, the sentence that the federal government was aiming to charge Swartz with — 50 years in prison — is greater than the maximum sentence allowed for selling child pornography, knowingly spreading AIDS, and, in some cases, selling slaves.
Granted, Swartz was reported to previously have had suicidal thoughts, and his suicide may have just been a culmination of many different factors. Only time will tell what, if any, repercussions his suicide has. 
While I completely disagree with those who say it was the government who actively conspired to kill Swartz, I can’t help but hold those pushing for prosecution at least a little bit responsible.
Swartz was a clearly flawed yet undoubtedly brilliant man. In his short life, he founded RSS and helped deter the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA); he will be greatly missed in both the tech and political activism communities. Rest assured that, while he may be gone, there are many left who will continue to advocate for greater transparency and protection of the open Web, if perhaps in a manner less likely to lead to direct confrontation or harassment.

With the quasi-resolution of the fiscal cliff comes new taxes for everyone. Some of Obamacare’s 19 taxes are starting to kick in. The payroll tax cut expired, and some new taxes on the wealthy, such as the expiration of the Bush Tax Cuts and an additional 0.9 percent payroll tax for high earners as part of Obamacare, were allowed to take place.
The increased tax burden on the wealthy, driven entirely by the wishes of Democratic lawmakers, brings to light the contrasting views that Democrats and Republicans have about the economy, especially considering that those tax increases hardly put a dent in the federal deficit.
Imagine that the economy is comprised of 10 bakeries, each making 10 pies a year for a total of 100 pies. Those pies represent gross domestic product, or all taxable income. If the pies were distributed like income in the U.S. economy, the top 20 percent would get 50 pies and the bottom 10 percent would get only one pie, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2007 Economic Survey of income data. Democrats and Republicans agree that this is a problem, yet they have two very different ways to go about solving it.
Democrats subscribe to what is being called “The Blue State Model,” which involves redistribution. They want to take more pies from the top 20 percent and give them to the bottom 20 percent.
Republicans don’t believe that this is effective or right. What Republicans want to do is get the government out of the way and help more people get into the workplace so that bakeries can make 11 pies each or possibly an 11th bakery can be opened.
These are policies and strategies that grow the economy, creating more pie for everyone, making us all better off. The Democratic Party’s approach discourages economic growth. 
Naturally, if you’re waking up early and spending all day making pies only to have them taken away from you, you’ll probably wake up later, not make as many pies, and choose to spend more time doing economically unproductive things.
This is the big debate of our time. Republicans need to shift their pitch from defending the rich to recognizing that income inequality is a problem that needs solving. 
We can solve it by creating more pies for everyone to eat, including those at the bottom.
The Democratic model never actually solves this problem. The rich can only foot so much of our nation’s growing bill. The real taxable money is in the middle class and upper-middle class, people whom both parties claim to protect. History has shown us that once entitlement programs start, they keep growing to an unsustainable level. When you can get free money, why wouldn’t you take it? Eventually, the money to fund them is going to have to come from these less-well-off people.
After winning legislative victories that got more pies to working people, Samuel Gompers, a labor movement leader of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, was asked, “Well now that you’ve won, what do you want?” He replied, “More.” 
This is exactly what happens to entitlement programs. Everyone just wants more of other people’s pies until there aren’t enough of other people’s pies to give out. The people making the most pies stop working as hard, and the economy shrinks.
It’s time to help the poor by having an opportunity-focused society, not an entitlement society. It’s time for Republicans to refine their pitch to reflect this intent.

Understandably, after the recent shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School where 27 children were killed, some Americans have been vying for stricter gun control. While this spike is predictable after such a tragedy and statistics show it happening after just about every gun massacre, according to The New York Times, this spike is both higher and has lasted longer than usual. The children killed at Sandy Hook have shaken our social consciousness. We — and more importantly, President Obama — have decided to do something about it this time. It's not nearly enough, but it is a step in the right direction.
Washington has decided to approach the issue in two different ways. There is a faction that believes that tightly written bills and the legislative process are enough, and there is another that believes that with this sort of politically charged atmosphere, guerilla warfare such as executive actions might be the best way to handle this. They want to change things; they’re just not sure how to do it in the best way.
The NRA, for its part, has been making different propositions to end gun violence as well. Its answer is to match a bad guy with a gun with a good guy with a gun. Members believe that establishing armed guards in schools is the only thing that will stop the gunmen.
When Obama disagreed with the belief that more guns were the solution to the problem, the NRA released a video calling Obama an elitist hypocrite for not wanting to protect school children but using the Secret Service to protect his daughters at school, as if the daughters of the President of the United States don’t need that kind of protection.
But I’m inclined to believe that armed guards in schools would work, at least as a deterrent for anyone planning something in school.
More thorough and universal background checks may be the sweet spot between pro-gun control and anti-gun control protesters. As of now, private sellers and sellers at gun shows don’t have to require background checks, and different states can check different databases. Obama promises to crack down on them as well, but there’s no guarantee that people who don't pass background checks won’t get guns.
Obama is also reinstating the ban on assault rifles that expired in 1994 and renewing the 10-round limit on ammunition magazines. The limit on ammunition is something even gun owners can get behind. The problem that still exists with this is people called “straw purchasers,” who buy guns and then sell them to people who might not have passed the background check, no matter how thorough it was. Of course, people will find a way to get bigger ammunition magazines as well. Obama’s orders are a great start, but are not enough.
The problem is that Obama is doing all of this instead of addressing the underlying causes of such violence. He’s trying to make access to mental health facilities more readily available, but with the social stigma surrounding mental health disorders, not everyone that needs the help will get it. Some states, such as Pennsylvania, have also required mental health hospital stays if the individual is proven to be a threat to themselves or their environment. 
But that’s also difficult: Where is the line drawn? How can you tell people that they are required to spend time in a mental health institution before they are considered fit for society? Is that presumable gain to society worth the cost, both psychologically and monetarily, for that individual?
Society also has a misconception that video games or the mass media are some of the underlying causes of violence these days, and I hope that this misconception doesn’t translate to wasting policy on video games as an effort to reduce violence.
The important thing for anti-gun control protesters to understand is that no one is “taking” your guns. No one is trying to take away your constitutional rights. We’re just trying to make it harder for the Adam Lanzas of the world to get guns.

As the New Year and the new semester have both begun, Student Senate is back to work making our Carnegie Mellon community and campus a better environment for all students.
Many of you may remember our efforts to reach out and connect with students during Senate Week last fall. As a body, we were very happy with the level of engagement and excitement that students showed in stopping by the table, filling out surveys, naming their senators, and answering trivia questions about Senate.
From our perspective, Senate Week was very successful, and something that will hopefully grow to become a tradition at Carnegie Mellon.
Our goal coming into this semester is to continue our engagement with fellow students, but this time with a feedback and discussion-oriented style. To this end, Student Senate will be hosting our first ever Town Hall Week Jan. 28th to Feb. 1st! For the three days leading up to our Thursday General Body Meeting, Senators from each individual college will be hosting an open Town Hall meeting.
The schedule for the Town Halls will be up on our Facebook page, and you should be receiving an email from your college’s Senators regarding your college’s Town Hall.
There will be food at each of these events, so stop by to grab a bite to eat and hear from your Senators what they’ve been working on. 
Beyond that, we will be asking a series of open-ended questions to hear your opinions on big-picture issues on campus, as well as issues related to your home college.
Your thoughts and ideas, as always, will be used to drive our projects and initiatives for the rest of the semester. 
The end goal, as always, is to make Carnegie Mellon a better place for you. So save the date, and keep an eye out on Facebook, Twitter, and all across campus for more information about these events!
Thanks,
Anshul Dhankher
Vice Chair, Undergraduate
Student Senate

President Barack Obama introduced a new legislative agenda and executive orders for greater federal gun control last Wednesday, which has left both sides of the debate fiercely supporting their values. Gun control advocates have looked to the President to endorse and implement stricter gun control, especially on assault weapons. However, pro-gun activists have called such measures unconstitutional and in direct violation of the Second Amendment.
It seems that now people agree that there needs to be some change to prevent massacres like the Newtown, Conn. and Aurora, Colo. mass shootings from happening again. New legislation regarding the sale and use of firearms is a necessity in the wake of these tragedies.
One of the primary steps is to prevent the firearms already in circulation from getting into the wrong hands. This requires more efficient screening processes.
The President’s current proposal would support universal background checks on gun sales and would aim to form tougher gun trafficking regulations , thus increasing the likelihood of there being a paper trail between gun sellers and end users.
These measures, if enforced, could make a difference in the prevention of future gun violence and crime. Both sides have begun a conversation regarding background checks and mental health screenings. While there is fervent opposition to several aspects of the proposal, such as reinstating the ban on assault weapons and limiting ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, any bipartisan support at all for a gun control bill is a strong indicator that people realize changes need to be made to gun regulations.
Mental health evaluations are also a key factor in curbing future episodes of mass violence. Eliminating the social stigma of mental disorders, improving access to mental health experts, and improving training for such officials in the areas of warning signs and red flags are a major factor in preventing violence.
The legislation currently introduced makes steps in the right direction, but needs to ensure that Second Amendment rights are protected for U.S. citizens. Emphasizing the need to ensure that firearms do not fall into the hands of criminals and the mentally unstable should be the flagship goal of gun control efforts, as these efforts will do the most to create actual, responsible change in Washington.

Carnegie  Mellon has students with a wide range of ethnic backgrounds, and we pride ourselves on this diversity. Because the student body is composed of such a wide variety of backgrounds, individuals also have a wide range of dietary needs.
Housing and Dining Services concerns itself with the students’ dietary preferences at the University, and it shows. With the recent addition of The Pomegranate — a vendor offering kosher, vegetarian, and vegan options — as well as other specialty vendors like Worlds of Flavor and the Crêperie last semester, it is obvious that Housing and Dining Services hopes to better accommodate students’ needs.
According to the University’s Housing and Dining website, The Pomegranate’s owner Zur Goldblum, former chef of Middle Eastern restaurant Sababa in Squirrel Hill, created a menu “to reflect cuisines with flavors from the Middle East, Turkey, and Israel.”
In the past, students could purchase frozen kosher meals or sandwiches at other campus locations, but were unable to purchase fresh kosher meals. Jewish students keeping kosher on campus and students who keep their meal choices impulsive will no doubt appreciate the options now available to them.
Goldblum also added to the University’s vegetarian and vegan offerings with The Pomegranate’s falafel and babaganoush.
Located in the General Motors Room on the second floor of the University Center, The Pomegranate officially opened this Thursday.
By continuing to add a variety of eateries throughout campus, Housing and Dining Services allows students to be satisfied with their diets at their home away from home. Even though it may not be able to provide meals as exciting as a real home-cooked one, Housing and Dining Services is clearly trying to hire vendors and chefs, like Goldblum, that will provide the closest possible experience.
Because college meal plans are expensive, students deserve to be satisfied with their provided meals. Housing and Dining Services is well on its way to achieving that satisfaction.

The University has recently taken an initiative to improve the path connecting the Morewood and WQED parking lots. There is a new concrete staircase, and the existing wooden steps have been renovated to include two side-by-side staircases. Lamp posts have also been installed along the path. However, the improvements to this area on the outskirts of campus should not stop here; they present the opportunity for further safety measures to be made to this path.
Unfortunately, the passage residing between the parking lot behind Morewood Gardens and the WQED office has earned a reputation as being an unsafe and frightening place to travel through, especially at night. For this reason, the path is often referred to as “the rape trail” by students. It is unacceptable that members of the Carnegie Mellon community must travel on a pathway that appears frightening enough at night to be associated with the risk of sexual assault. This association is of special concern because many first-years who live in the Residence on Fifth commute to and from their dorm using this pathway.
A clear way to improve this scenario would be to install an emergency button on the pathway so that students traveling on the path would be able to easily call campus police if needed.
The pathway between the Morewood parking lot and the WQED parking lot has long been the subject of speculation, stories, and  jokes among the campus community. 
We commend The University for their initiatives to renovate the pathway and increase student safety. The University should continue this trend by complementing the improved stairs with an emergency call system to better protect the student body.
