The Tartans won the Cindy Lackner Memorial Football Game 41–21. 
Football fans dressed in pink to honor the late wife of head coach Rick Lackner and to support finding a cure for breast cancer at the team’s home game against the Denison University Big Red on Saturday.
“It was great to be able to dedicate this game to coach’s wife and come with a win,” senior cornerback Sam Thompson said.
Junior quarterback Rob Kalkstein had a fantastic game, completing 10 of his 14 passes for 186 yards and a touchdown.
While most of Kalkstein’s passes were pinpoint accurate, a few of them required difficult catches from his receivers, including a 41-yard completion to junior receiver Tim Kikta at the end of the third period. Kikta ran a corner route and beat his defender, but the throw was off line. Kikta adjusted and caught the ball just a couple inches off the ground before diving onto the turf.
Kikta had just two receptions in the game, but both had big gains as he recorded a total of 96 receiving yards.
Senior running back Patrick Blanks was dominant in the running game, carrying the ball 14 times for a whopping 155 yards, averaging 11.1 yards per carry. He found the end zone three times in the game. Junior running back Michael Trentalange added a touchdown of his own.
Statistically, the two offenses performed evenly. The Tartans’ 427 yards of total offense was almost matched by the Big Red’s 394 yards.
The difference in this game was ball security. The Tartans committed zero turnovers, recovering their only fumble of the game. However, Denison University threw two interceptions and fumbled the football three times, losing possession on two of them. The Big Red also lost the ball on downs twice, while the Tartans converted two fourth down plays for the first.
“Our defense gave up a lot of yards, so forcing turnovers was critical to stopping the Big Red offense,” Thompson said.
Junior inside linebacker Akwasi Brefo led the Tartans’ defense with nine tackles. Junior safeties Jack Butler and Alex Basinski added seven tackles each. The Tartans’ defensive line gave Denison senior quarterback Max Paulus a headache, sacking him six times. Kalkstein was well-protected in this game; he was only sacked once.
The 5–1 Tartans will face the Ohio Wesleyan University Battling Bishops next Saturday at home. Kickoff is at 1 p.m. at Gesling Stadium.

The women’s tennis team dominated Oberlin College on Friday, winning eight of its nine matches. Luckily, the weather channel was wrong and the rain held off. The day proved to be the perfect weather for tennis; it was 70 degrees and partly cloudy by the time the Tartans took to the court. Carnegie Mellon won all six singles matches and took two of the three doubles matches at the team’s last match of the fall season.
Senior Alex Tapak and sophomore Lydia Utkin held first-years Ariana Abayomi and Erin Johnson of Oberlin scoreless, winning 8–0 at No. 3 doubles. Sophomores Chelsea Motie and Bryn Raschke followed that victory up with an 8–3 win at No. 1 doubles. Motie also won Carnegie Mellon’s first singles match in two sets  6–0, 6–2 at No. 3 singles.
Sophomore Angela Pratt won her match in two sets  6–2, 6–4 at No. 5 singles. Utkin won at No. 6 singles 6–4, 6–2.
“It was great to finish the season with a solid win. We played really well as a team and our result was evidence of it,” Utkin said.
The Tartans were, for the most part, unchallenged by Oberlin. Very few of the matches were close, and only one match went to a third set. The doubles matches were all pro-sets, with the Tartans winning two of them handily.
The lost pro-set was at the hands of the Oberlin duo, junior Brenna Sheldon and senior Preeya Shah. They defeated Pratt and first-year Brooke Tsu, 8–4.
The other singles victors included first-years Abbey Hamstra and Elizabeth Martin. Junior Katie Cecil also won her singles match at No. 1 singles, 7–6 and 6–2.
“Oberlin came out strong on Friday and I was really happy with how everyone stayed mentally tough to end our fall season on a good note. Hopefully it will carry over into the spring season,” Cecil said.
In singles matches, Sheldon was the only potential adversary to the Tartans’ victory, as her match against Martin went into three sets, with Martin eventually winning.
“I’m really excited about yesterday’s results, but also disappointed that yesterday was the last match of the fall season,” Martin said. “I can’t wait for the spring season!”
The women’s tennis season will begin again in the spring semester.

The No. 4-ranked men’s soccer team started University Athletic Association (UAA) conference play. Last Sunday the team defeated the visiting Washington University of St. Louis Bears, and on Saturday tied with the University of Chicago Maroons. The team’s record is 8–1–1 overall and 1–0–1 in the UAA.
In the 1–0 victory against the Bears, the winning goal was assisted by a free kick from senior Ben Bryant to junior Max Tassano, who tipped a header into the left corner of the goal. Tartan defense, including central defenders Alex Abedian and Jakob Rohwer and outside backs Brandon Peck and Bryant, deterred the Bears from not only scoring, but shooting as well — the Bears had only three shots throughout the game.
When the Tartans faced its second UAA opponent, the University of Chicago Maroons, the game resulted in a double overtime draw. The Maroons were leading the game 2–0 throughout most of the second half, until junior midfielder Chris Wysocki scored his first goal of the season, changing the score to 2–1 with 22 minutes remaining in the game.
Bryant tied the game with 1:46 remaining by scoring the second goal for Carnegie Mellon, which resulted from a volley from the top of the 18-yard box to the corner of the goal.
“The goal was one of the best goals I’ve scored in my life,” Bryant said. “It was a volley out of the air with my left foot, and once it went in we all felt a sense of relief.”
Early in the first overtime, Bryant had a shot blocked, and near the 95-minute mark, a header by junior defender Cole Christensen was too wide for completion. In the second overtime the Tartans did not take any shots, but the Maroons were able to grab two. The first of shot was too wide; the other was saved by junior goalkeeper Christopher Madden with less than two minutes to go.
The Tartans continue to compete in the UAA, and will face University of Rochester at home on Friday at 7:30 p.m.

After its disappointing first loss of the season against Washington University of St. Louis, the Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team came back this Saturday to win 2–1 over the University of Chicago Maroons.
This game puts the team’s total record at 7–1–2 for the season.
The game was scoreless for the first half, as both teams put up strong defenses. The Tartans and Maroons combined for 13 attempted shots in the first half, but none that would test either goalie.
The Tartans’ strong offense was led by sophomore forward Savina Reid. At the 57-minute mark, Reid — assisted by first-year forward Louisa Pendergast — kicked the ball past Maroons first-year goalie Jacinda Reid to put the Tartans on the board. Soon after, Reid scored again with an assist from junior defender Brittany Couture. This goal marked her fourth of the season.
The Tartans kept their two-goal lead until the 87-minute mark, when Maroons forward Natalia Jovanovic scored a goal. The Tartans fought hard during the final three minutes of the game and were able to withstand University of Chicago’s pressure.
Carnegie Mellon will have a busy week with two home games, as the women’s soccer team takes on University of Rochester Friday at 5 p.m. and Case Western Reserve University Sunday at 11 a.m. The Tartans look to redeem last season’s loss to the Case Western Spartans, who beat the Tartans 2–0.
“It feels so good to get our first UAA win. We really played together as a team and worked well to get the win. I have confidence going into our games,” senior midfielder Stephanie Hare said.

The Carnegie Mellon golf team finished another tournament in the top five. On Sept. 29 and 30, the Tartans traveled to the Cedarbrook Golf Course in Belle Vernon, Penn. The Vulcan Invitational was hosted by California University of Pennsylvania, a Division-II school.
The Tartans managed to stay in the zone for two days and finished fifth out of 16 teams.
The Vulcan Invitational was a three-round tournament. Each of the five competing Tartans completed all three rounds, and the four best scores were used to calculate the final score for the round. Junior Ian Bangor, sophomore Cameron Low, first-year Ben DuCarme, sophomore Justin Fischler, and junior Grant Strimel competed for Carnegie Mellon.
In the first round, the Tartans’ best score was 69 from Bangor and DuCarme. Bangor had the lowest score of any of his teammates across all three rounds; in the second round, he shot another 69 and completed the third round with a 73, for a grand total of 211 for all three rounds.
Low had the next best total of 224, shooting rounds of 72, 75, and 77, respectively.
“Future goals definitely include making it to nationals as a team. I definitely believe in the team we have this year to make it there. We have shown this fall season so far that we can put up the necessary scores to make it to nationals, and we have the talent to go very far,” Low said. “It’s just a matter of us playing consistently well throughout this year. We are a young team, so if we cannot make it to nationals this year, next year looks very promising.”
The Tartans will host the Carnegie Mellon Fall Invitational at Longue Vue Country Club Thursday morning.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team left campus on Sept. 28 for the annual, weekend-long ITA Southeast Regional Championships, hosted by the University of Mary Washington. Historically, the Tartans have been able to send some players to nationals. This year, the Tartans broke that trend.
Top-seeded senior Duke Miller fell to No. 9-seeded Erik Lim of Johns Hopkins University in three sets, 2–6, 6–4, and 6–3, in the round of 16. First-year and No. 9-seeded Abhishek Alla made it all the way to quarterfinals before losing to No. 1-seeded Andy Hersh of Johns Hopkins University, 6–2 and 6–0. Hersh had also defeated Tartan first-year Yuvraj Kumar in the round of 16.
No. 9-seeded sophomore Christian Heaney-Secord sailed to the round of 16 before being defeated by the No. 5-seeded Ben Hwang of Johns Hopkins University.
Miller and sophomore William Duncan went into the doubles draw as the No. 1 seeds. Miller and Duncan made a run to the semifinals before they were upset by No. 4-seeded Hersh and Jeff Kamei from Johns Hopkins, 8–5.
Carnegie Mellon had many quarterfinal finishers. The No. 5-seeded team was a new look for Carnegie Mellon as Heaney-Secord and first-year Kosuke Hasegawa paired up for the first time.
The duo fell to the No. 2-seeded team of Evan Chalres and Donato Rizzolo from the University of Mary Washington, 8–5.
Another new team for the Tartans was tandem of Alla and sophomore Bryce Beisswanger.
Unseeded Alla and Beisswanger defeated the No. 3-seeded duo of Will MacArthur and Ross Silverberg of Franklin and Marshall College in the first round and then moved on to have a swift second-round win over Alex Haley and Michael Milanov of Shenandoah University, 8–1. However, the new pair fell to the No. 5-seeded duo of Tanner Brown and Erik Lim of Johns Hopkins University in a close 9–7 pro set, taking it set to a tie-breaking game.
“We learned a lot about ourselves over the weekend,” said head coach Andrew Girard. “We learned that we are capable of some great things this season, but also discovered some areas we need to improve in if we want to compete for a national championship next spring. This is definitely the most depth we’ve had in both singles and doubles in a long time, maybe ever. I’m looking forward to putting all of our talents together in a dual match format.”

Volleyball team has disappointing weekend.
The Tartan volleyball team traveled to the University of Chicago Sept. 29 and 30 to play in the University Athletic Association (UAA) Round Robin No. 1.
“It wasn’t really a great weekend, but that’s expected with [the] UAA,” sophomore right side hitter Ali Celentano said. “A lot of the teams are top, nationally ranked teams, and we started out with two of the top teams in the conference.”
Their first match was against host University of Chicago, ranked No. 14, which swept the Tartans 3–0 (25–14, 25–16, 29–27). Celentano had seven kills, and junior outside hitter Senna Parsa had six kills and two block assists. Junior libero Ali Nichols led the team with 13 digs.
“I was most proud of how we played in the third set against Chicago,” junior setter Emily Wright said. “We gave a good showing and Chicago did not win easily. The game could have gone either way.”
The team’s next match was against sixth-ranked Emory University Eagles. The Tartans fell to the Eagles 3–0 in three quick games (25–10, 25–13, 25–18). Celentano collected 10 kills, and first-year setter Emily Lawlis had 14 assists.
“We need to buckle down on our serve receive,” head coach Kim Kelly said. “[Emory] ran quite a few serves off of us in one segment, and we just couldn’t recover from that. They ran a very fast offense, and we have to catch up to that offense.”
The Tartans faced New York University for its final match of the Round Robin No. 1. Although Carnegie Mellon won the first game (25–18), New York University won the overall match 3–1 (25–22, 25–15, 25–17). Parsa tallied 11 kills, 11 digs, and two block assists, while Nichols led the defense with 21 digs.
“This past weekend did not go how we would have liked,” Wright said. “However, it was definitely an eye opener for us, and it taught us a lot about how we function as a team. Luckily we have two more weeks to work hard and prepare for our next UAA tournament.”
Carnegie Mellon will host the UAA Round Robin No. 2 this weekend, where the Tartans will play the University of Rochester, Case Western Reserve University, Washington University in St. Louis, and Brandeis University.

Sophomore right side hitter Ali Celentano currently leads the volleyball team with a total of 218 kills and an average of 3.03 kills per game. She also has the highest hitting percentage on the team with .278.
Her success on the court began when she was a freshman in high school.
“There was a new high school [volleyball] team, so I decided I was just going to try out even though I’d never played before,” Celentano said. “People said, ‘You’re tall so you should try to play volleyball.’ So I did, and the high school coach convinced me to play club, and then from there I just fell in love with it.”
Her passion for volleyball is evident on the court. Sometimes she arrives early to practice to set up the nets and get in extra repetitions. Head coach Kim Kelly acknowledges and appreciates Celentano’s work ethic.
“She works hard,” Kelly said. “Any time she feels like she has to improve on something, she’s asked me to come in early, she’s asked me to stay late. She wants to be the best that she can possibly be, and I love that.”
Celentano also brings a positive attitude to the team, and Kelly believes a positive outlook is essential to overcoming obstacles in the sport.
“She always has a smile no matter what,” Kelly said. “Ali is very positive out there. That helps a lot, because if we have a player who is down on herself, she looks to Ali and sees that smile to bring her up.”
Junior setter Emily Wright also notices Celentano’s incredible presence on the court and positive influence on the team.
“Ali’s biggest strength is definitely her attitude,” Wright said. “She brings everyone up with her and is always a positive inspiration. She’s a hard worker; she never complains and always has a good attitude. Most importantly, I know she will always get a good hit off of whatever set I give her. She’s a very adaptable player.”
Although Celentano does not lead her teammates vocally, she leads by example. She knows what her role is on the team and tries to always execute it well.
“I’m not a big speaker or talker,” Celentano said. “I try to lead the team by getting that kill when we need it. I don’t often have the right thing to say, so I just do what needs to be done.”
Celentano was named the Eastern College Athletic Conference South Volleyball Athlete of the Week after her performance in the Carnegie Mellon Invitational, which took place Sept. 14-15. During that weekend, Celentano hit .875 against the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg and collected 17 kills against Elmira College.
“She just had a fantastic week,” Kelly said. “She was picked out of hundreds of volleyball players to get that honor. She deserved it, there’s no doubt about it. She worked her tail off that week.”
She will be looked at to lead on offense as the Tartans continue UAA Round Robin play next weekend.
Celentano excels both on and off the court. She is majoring in business administration, but she is working toward becoming a doctor someday. 
“She is such a determined young woman,” Kelly said. “She is going to be very successful in whatever she decides to do.”

The Carnegie Mellon club rowing team participated in the Head of the Ohio Regatta in Downtown on Saturday. Colleges from all over the country, in addition to local high school students and adults, competed on the Ohio River.
“It was exciting to race along downtown Pittsburgh,” junior Lauren Ruoff said.
It was a celebration of the crew club’s 25th anniversary, and many alumni traveled back to Pittsburgh to support the club and participate in the races.
The men’s lightweight four placed second and took home a silver medal in the event. The team was led by sophomore coxswain Jenna Krug, and consisted of sophomore Sam Winslow, junior Damien Engels, senior Brendan White, and senior Dmitriy Yakubov.
The men’s eight boat, led by junior coxswain Rand Burzese, finished fifth out of 16 boats. Rowers included juniors Luke Diorio-Toth and Joe Guihan, senior Faiz Abbasi, sophomore Bryan Phippps, senior Alex Shie, Yakubov, Winslow, and Engels.
The women’s lightweight four, commanded by junior coxswain Isaac Jones, took third place in the event due to the hard efforts of sophomore Julia Embody, first-year Kelsey Simpson, and juniors Katy Basore and Jinie Haytko.
“The water was really choppy, but I think that was almost a good thing because it made us really focus on rowing with our best form, so that downstream where the water was calmer, we were able to row even better,” junior Karl DeStefano said.
The Tartans’ next race will be the Head of the Occoquan in Sandy Run, Va., on Nov. 3–4.

Pittsburgh-based space robotics company Astrobotic Technology, Inc. rolled out the first prototype of its lunar ice prospecting robot, Polaris, in the Gates Center at its first official public unveiling.
As a part of the Cèilidh Weekend festivities, the Lunar Robot Open House brought students, staff, family, and alumni around a stage that held Polaris as William “Red” Whittaker spoke about the rover. A Robotics Institute professor and Astrobotic’s CEO, Whittaker described the goal of Polaris: to explore the vast underground water and gas resources discovered as ice on the Moon two years ago.
Polaris, equipped with a drill and other prospecting equipment, can answer questions about the gas that satellite data cannot. “What is it, what is it made of, where is it, what is its concentration, can you extract it, can you use it?” Whittaker said. “[Polaris] changes everything.”
Answering these questions could have a large impact on the future of space exploration. “This polar ice, when utilized, can transform the whole direction of space exploration,” Whittaker said. “Because see, if you could refuel after leaving the Earth, you can go anywhere.” But to learn how to use this extraterrestrial gas to fuel travel beyond our current limits, Whittaker explained we must first travel to the Moon.
And this will be difficult, he said, because the rover will be completely autonomous. Without radio GPS and remote control, the robot will have to compare its surroundings to satellite images of the Moon’s surface to determine its location. It will have to see and maneuver around rocks larger than 15 centimeters —or roughly the size of a bowling ball — that could obstruct its path. Perhaps the most difficult challenge is how the solar-powered Polaris would balance operating in areas that not only have ice, but also sunlight.
In October 2015, Astrobotic plans to send Polaris to a carefully chosen location near the Moon’s northern pole. Like the Earth, the Moon’s region with the most frozen resources is also its coldest and darkest: the poles. The rover must utilize complex algorithms to predict when and where shadows will fall as it travels the surface and as the Moon changes positions. For the mission to be a success, the rover needs to detect both ice and sunlight.
Polaris also needs to be able to successfully land, and to achieve this, Astrobotic is also developing a high-precision lander. Once the lander and its payload near the desired region of the Moon’s surface, it will slow down and hover for about four days before it decides where to land and make its slow descent.
In addition to accuracy, the lander will also boast versatility. Kevin Peterson, a Ph.D. student in robotics who has worked on the project for two years, explained the many features of the lander’s design.
“... this lander is designed for this rover, [but also] for the smaller rover and for carrying payloads underneath. We can go without a rover all together, as long as we are within our mass constraints, which are fairly large, actually,” Peterson said. “That lets us design one lander and then go out and find a payload.” This will allow the company, which is already receiving $1 million a year from NASA alone, to easily commercialize its lander to other Moon-goers.
“The company’s goal is not to win the X PRIZE; it is to commercialize space,” Aaron Acton said, referring to the Google Lunar X PRIZE, the largest contest of its kind in history. Acton has been working on the project for more than three years, ever since he began his master’s in mechanical engineering. “As part of that goal, to win the X PRIZE, would be great,” he added.
According to Google’s X PRIZE website, “A total of $30 million in prizes are available to the first privately funded teams to safely land a robot on the surface of the Moon, have that robot travel 500 meters over the lunar surface, and send video, images, and data back to the Earth.”
Astrobotic was founded shortly after the announcement of the contest in 2008, and is determined to compete with 26 other groups. With its team of over a dozen Carnegie Mellon students and alumni, the company is preparing to move to a new location so that it can expand its research and operations.

“Museum people and software engineers speak radically different languages and basically do not choose to spend time with one another,” said Marc Donner, engineering director for Google’s New York City office, during a lecture last Thursday in Rashid Auditorium. His Google Art Project aims to bridge the gap between the computer world and the art world.
Donner, a Carnegie Mellon alumnus, entertained the idea of a digital art museum in 2007: “Already we see things happening in the library world that should be causing excitement in the museum world,” Donner wrote in a blog post, referring to how traditional library shelves are being replaced by scanned images of books on a server on the internet. He admitted that art is more difficult to capture digitally than are books.
“But rendering the appearance of a surface under arbitrary illumination and viewed from any distance or angle is well within the reach of most of the graphics engines incorporated into modern desktop and laptop computers,” Donner said. “The technology is available now to deliver many of the experiences we seek from fine art objects over the internet.”
Fast-forward to Donner’s lecture: After telling the story of Caravaggio, an Italian artist who was rediscovered around World War I after being forgotten when he died in 1610, Donner asked, “Are there any other great artists that we don’t know that have been forgotten by art historians and scholars and the public, buried in collections somewhere? Who believes there are no more?”
No one in the audience raised their hands. “And that’s why we need a digital museum,” Donner said.
The digital museum, Donner explained, was no easy feat. Google had the technology and the manpower to bring such an idea to life, but it needed to convince museums that the internet was not simply a channel for marketing, and that Google wasn’t just in it for the money — it was interested in expanding the appreciation for art.
After brainstorming, the company decided to use the same concept behind the Street View feature in Google Maps to produce virtual tours of museums.
The project’s first big break came when an employee in Google’s Madrid office used her connections with the Prado museum and persuaded it to let Google put 14 of its masterpieces online via Google Earth.
“We took a lot of pictures and pieced them together to try to make them various kinds of squares so you can do the arbitrary zooming that Google Earth can do,” Donner said. “It was tremendously expensive, but it made a huge splash in the art community.”
Donner said that an art historian at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, who had been discussing the idea of a digital museum with Google during this time, was impressed. “She said she was able to see things in that painting that she had never seen before,” Donner said. This was a turning point in the project: Once the Museum of Modern Art wanted to be a part of it, so did other notable museums, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Last February, the Google Art Project officially launched. Donner explained that the participating museums not only saw their website traffic increase, but the number of visitors — both returning customers and new art enthusiasts. Google had achieved its goal of using the internet to expand the art community.
Today, there are 151 museums and over 30,000 works of art on the Google Art Project. It currently allows users to take tours through museums, examine works of art in great detail, and chat about art pieces via Google Hangout. As for the future, Google is working on implementing Google Goggles, which will allow users to take a picture of a painting in a museum and immediately be presented with facts about it.
While the Google Art Project can be used as an educational tool, “It’s still not good enough to be a research tool,” Donner said. “But it’s beginning to show some promise in a lot of ways in which museums are trying to reach out to society at large.”

Glasses come in all shapes and sizes, and so do the eyes using them. Despite their diversity, all human eyes work in relatively the same fashion; so what exactly is happening inside a set of eyes that need glasses?
To answer this question, it’s necessary to explain how the eye views an image. As light reaches the eye, it first passes through the cornea — the clear tissue at the front of the eye — and enters the eye through the pupil. Next, it passes through the lens, which is behind the pupil, and finally reaches the retina at the back of the eye.
In a perfectly-functioning eye, the lens and the cornea refract, bending light rays and focusing them on the retina. Due to this refraction, the image appears inverted on the retina, so it must be adjusted by the brain.
Light from images is focused on the center of the retina. There are a number of vision problems that prevent this, however, and they make wearing glasses necessary. These vision problems — known as refractive errors — are myopia, hyperopia, astigmatisms, and presbyopia.
Myopia, or nearsightedness, means the eyeball is longer than normal so the retina is too far back. In this case, the eye is too long for the lens and cornea to properly focus. As a result, instead of reaching the retina, light from images is focused in front of the retina. According to the American Optometric Association, nearly 30 percent of the U.S. population is affected by myopia, and growing evidence shows that the condition is influenced by visual stress.
Nearsightedness can be treated with glasses or contacts with convex-shaped lenses. Convex lenses cause light to scatter, and it must be converged again by the lens of the eye. This shifts the focal point of the eye back, so that the image is focused on the retina instead of in front of it.
On the other hand, people with hyperopia, or farsightedness, have shorter eyeballs; their retinas are too far forward, resulting in images being focused behind the cornea. Farsighted individuals can view distant objects with relative ease, but struggle to see nearby objects. Hyperopia can be corrected by glasses or contacts with concave lenses, which cause light to be refracted toward the center. As a result, the focal point of the eye’s lens is pushed forward so the image is focused on the retina rather than behind it.
Myopia and hyperopia may be accompanied by astigmatisms, which occur when an individual’s cornea has an irregular shape, causing light from images to refract in different directions rather than at one focal point on the retina. As a result, astigmatisms usually blur images.
They can be treated with eyeglasses that have spherical lenses, which compensate for the irregular shape of the cornea and prevent light from being refracted in different directions. They can be also be corrected with orthokeratology, which involves wearing specially-designed, rigid contact lenses that slowly adjust the shape of the cornea so it bends light correctly.
Presbyopia is caused by age rather than eye structure. In order to properly focus light, the lens of the eye needs to be able to widen and compress. However, around age 40, the lens of the eye begins to harden and lose its flexibility. As a result, the eye has difficulty bringing both near and far images into focus.
Presbyopia can be corrected with bifocal lenses, which can focus on distant images throughout the lens and on near images at the bottom of the lens. It can also be addressed with specially designed contact lenses that either have a reading and distance prescription for each eye, or have a reading prescription for one eye and a distance prescription for the other.
Myopia, hyperopia, presbyopia, and astigmatisms can also be treated with LASIK eye surgery. The principle behind LASIK is to apply a laser beam to the cornea to remove enough of the corneal tissue to reshape the eye as needed, which involves cutting open and pulsating a laser on the cornea until enough of the tissue is removed.

Urban coyotes pose problems for city dwellers
Scientists have located the smallest known coyote territory five miles away from Chicago’s O’Hare airport. The team said that the coyote community has thrived in an area about one third of a square mile for six years.
“That’s an indication that they don’t have to go far to find food and water,” said Stan Gehrt, an associate professor of environment and natural resources at Ohio State University who has tracked the coyotes around Chicago for 12 years. 
Some researchers are worried that the advent of coyote communities in cities may have larger classes of carnivores following suit.

New development made in quantum cryptography
Researchers from the University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma State University, and the University of Houston created a new method of quantum cryptography that uses photons to code messages to increase data security.
Pramode Verma, a University of Oklahoma electrical and computer engineering professor, explained that programs using current cryptography techniques become susceptible to attacks that can recover sensitive information as they become larger.
The unpredictable nature of photons ensures that hackers can’t access information used to transmit sensitive data.

Paleontologist reveals new dinosaur species
University of Chicago paleontologist Paul Sereno has recently published his findings of a dinosaur species he discovered in South Africa. 
The dinosaur is called Pegomastax africanus — or “thick jaw from Africa” — and it roamed the Earth between 100 million and 200 million years ago. The one-foot tall animal’s size, frills, and tooth structure have led some to label it a cross between a bird, a vampire, and a porcupine.
Sereno explained that he had actually uncovered the species back in 1983, but had been too busy with other projects to announce his discovery at the time.

Scientists turn on world’s fastest radio telescope 
Scientists in Murchison, Australia, have powered on the world’s fastest radio telescope, dubbed the Australia Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), to help survey the universe and map out black holes.
“Radio waves tell us unique things about the cosmos, about the gas from which stars were formed, and about exotic objects, pulsars and quasars, that really push the boundaries of our knowledge of the physical laws in the universe,” said Brian Boyle, director of the project.
The ASKAP is located in an area roughly the size of Costa Rica with a total population of 120 people, as man-made radio signals would negatively impact the telescope’s effectiveness.

Facebook announces 1 billionth member
Facebook, the world’s largest social network, announced last week that it had surpassed the one billion active users mark. This achievement places Facebook among the fastest-growing websites in history.
In spite of this success, the company has been struggling to remain financially competitive. After Facebook’s initial public offering in May, its stock price fell to as low as 53 percent of its original value last month, and has not fully recovered. Following investors’ cries to find alternative sources of revenue, the company has recently turned to asking its users to pay to promote important posts, photos, and status updates.

Doctors improve detection of rare genetic disorders
Doctors and researchers at Children’s Mercy Hospitals and Clinics in Kansas City, Mo., have created software that can analyze the DNA of newborn babies and detect rare genetic disorders early. This new technique brings the time spent diagnosing these disorders from potential weeks or months down to just two days. Speedy diagnoses lead to speedy treatments, which can make the difference between life and death in the early phases of an infant’s life.
“This is the biggest breakthrough in this technology for clinical applications we have seen in a few years,” said David Dimmock, a geneticist not involved in the study.

It’s hard to describe the VIA Music & New Media Festival without leaving out something important. Sure, it’s about dance parties, DJs, and visual art, but it’s also about collaboration, experimentation, and community involvement. With a week of interactive exhibits, concerts, and lectures, VIA is an energy and a driving force that is changing the city’s musical landscape.
This year was the third annual VIA Festival, going from last Monday and into Saturday night in various locations around Pittsburgh. VIA is a Pittsburgh-based, volunteer-run electronic music collective. It started its annual festival in 2010, and has since brought over 100 musicians and 60 visual artists to the city. Over the summer, VIA opened its own venue at 6119 Penn Ave., where it has been hosting shows and creating a stronger presence in the community.
The VIA Festival is different from your average electronic music festival. According to its website, “VIA’s ‘Festival As Laboratory’ approach highlights the intersection of cutting-edge music and new media art through collaborative performances, installations, mobile projects, lectures and workshops.” Throughout the festival, DJs and producers are paired with visual artists to create unique performances. The result is an experience that concert-goers will not forget.
This year’s festival featured a few changes from previous ones. The first major change was location. While still primarily held in East Liberty, this year’s shows were held at both the new 6119 space and at the abandoned PNC Bank building at 6000 Penn Ave. The former PNC building proved to be an excellent site for the festival: The overwhelming size of the building allowed for a large stage, massive dance floor, and full bar, making it a suitable counterpoint to the smaller space at 6119.
The building was outfitted with an excellent audio and visual system, including seven projectors that highlighted the visual art throughout the shows. Another major change — perhaps the most notable — was that it lasted all week, not just the weekend. This change allowed more time for workshops, smaller concerts, and interactive art exhibits.
The festival kicked off on Monday with an exhibition at Fe Gallery, in which 10 different artists used 3-D computer graphics software to create experimental artworks. Other interactive events included a lecture about the history of avant-garde cinema with Jonathan Walley (an associate professor of cinema at Denison University) and Melissa Ragona (Carnegie Mellon associate professor of visual culture and critical theory in the School of Art).
Other attractions included a demonstration of juke and footwork, an extremely fast dance style that grew out of Chicago; a Data Garden exhibit at the Center for PostNatural History that focused on plant-based generative music; and a workshop at community art space Assemble that featured crash courses in various visual programming languages.
Perhaps the most interesting interactive event was the pop-up arcade held at the Deeplocal studio space at 6101 Penn Ave. The arcade was presented by Babycastles, a New York City-based video game collective. On Friday, festival-goers were invited to come to the space to learn how to make their own fully-functioning games from low-budget materials. On Saturday, the arcade was open for business, featuring original games by Babycastles and other artists. Carnegie Mellon alumni Tim Sherman (CFA ’12) and Caitlin Boyle (CFA ’12) were among those that created games. Their games were both housed in old arcade game machines, creating an authentic arcade experience through relatively simple games.
VIA also featured a number of performance artists this year — including robotcowboy, Erica Gressman, and Mikey McParlane — who all performed at 6119 on Saturday. Robotcowboy is Dan Wilcox’s performance art piece that combines musical performance and wearable computers. Wilcox, a master’s student in the School of Art, calls it “Human-Computer Performance.” Gressman and McParlane, a Carnegie Mellon alumnus (BHA ’08), are both performance artists based in Chicago.
Another unique event at the festival was Wednesday’s live rescoring of the classic French surrealist film La Vampire Nue. The film, created by Jean Rollin and released in 1970, examines a suicide cult led by a mysterious figure and is considered one of the most visually stunning erotic horror films of all time. At the event, U.K.-based electronic musicians Demdike Stare rescored the film live at Pittsburgh Filmmakers’ Melwood Screening Room. The new music fit in seamlessly and creating an eerie effect.
While the festival featured a wide range of performance art, interactive exhibitions, and film events, its primary focus was still on the audiovisual performances. Starting on Tuesday, each night of the festival featured a diverse and impressive lineup of musicians and visual artists.
Tuesday’s show at The Andy Warhol Museum featured Los Angeles-based singer and multi-instrumentalist Julia Holter. Holter’s music is a hauntingly powerful combination of indie electronic music and modern composition, and her show captured the audience’s attention. Pittsburgh-based band The Garment District opened for Holter with its synth-driven ambient rock. The visuals for the night — provided by video artists Ryan Emmett, Keith Tassick, and Albert Birney —primarily featured found footage that fit perfectly with the music.
Thursday’s show opened with Toronto-based artist SlowPitch, who performed an impressive, yet sparse, set at 6119. His set never quite picked up, making him a perfect opener for the more dance-oriented groups that followed. 
SlowPitch’s set was live; he was making the music as he went along, not just DJing records. “It’s all about your energy out there,” he said at one point during his show. “I’m making this up on the fly.”
The night continued with Poirier, a DJ and producer based in Montreal. Despite shaky transitions, his set was one of the best of the night, featuring a jungle vibe with tropical bass sounds. Poirier got people dancing and helped pave the way for New York City-based rapper Le1f. If Poirier got people dancing, Le1f really got the audience moving. Known for being outwardly gay and challenging the traditionally homophobic rap genre, Le1f’s music and performance style are socially conscious without being didactic. His stage presence and skillful live rapping engaged the audience in a high-energy performance.
On Friday, New York City-based queer pop group SSION performed at the former PNC building. Led by singer Cody Critcheloe, SSION put on what was perhaps the most energetic and engaging show of the whole festival. Critcheloe’s stage presence paired with the group’s high-energy and highly danceable music made for an unforgettable show. Scott Andrews, a visual artist and master’s student in the College of Fine Arts, provided the visuals for SSION’s set, a mashup of queer symbolism that added to the wonderfully chaotic environment.
SSION also appeared at Carnegie Mellon’s own Skibo Cafe on Friday night for a special live-taping talk show.  The event, hosted by AB Lectures, featured SSION and local queer celebrity host Alaska Thunderfuck.
Later on Friday night, Pittsburgh’s own Girl Talk made a surprise visit to the festival. Instead of performing his usual mashup-style set, he performed a short experimental noise set that was almost entirely comprised of bass sounds. The set was disorienting and confusing, with strobe lights flashing, Girl Talk outfitted in a Steeler’s jersey and helmet, and two masked girls throwing Arby’s roast beef sandwiches into the audience. Despite the general weirdness of the set, it was without a doubt a testament to the type of environment VIA creates. There are few outlets for this type of set, but it fit into VIA’s lineup seamlessly.
This feeling of experimentation pervaded the week’s performances and activities, proving that VIA is, indeed, much more than a music festival. It’s an event for artists and concert-goers to fully immerse themselves in music and art without fear of rejection. The audience is welcoming, the artists engaging, and the week truly memorable.
As Holter said at her performance Tuesday night, perhaps most accurately summing up the entire festival: “I like you guys.... It’s good vibes.”

Wordplay, slapstick, intricate costumes, a great cast — the School of Drama’s current production, The Rivals, has a lot to offer audiences. Although the show was written in 1775 and is set in Bath, England, the audience is still able to follow the story and appreciate the jokes scattered throughout the dialogue.
The show follows the dramatic Lydia Languish, played by senior acting major Ginna Le Vine, on her quest for love and marriage. Plot twists involving the pursuit of love plague all members of the cast, as The Rivals is full of deceit, intense emotion, and confusion at every turn.
Wordplay is one of the funniest parts of the show, easily causing the audience to forget that the play was written over 200 years ago. The old Mrs. Malaprop, played by senior acting major Alexandra Spieth, is obsessed with proper speech, yet incorrectly uses sophisticated words throughout the play. Her use of “pineapple” for “pinnacle” and “perpendicular” for “particular” kept the audience in stitches.
The show is also full of slapstick. In one scene, Mrs. Malaprop repeatedly strikes Lydia on the head when the older woman is particularly annoyed with the younger lady’s insolence. Bob Acres, played by senior musical theater major Joseph Maddox, also provides a lot of comic relief through his constant threats of violence, which included punching the air, gnashing his teeth, and working himself into an excited frenzy. “The Fag,” played by senior acting major Jacob Tischler, receives constant physical and emotional abuse from his master and others, providing some good laughs.
“I am delighted to come to Carnegie Mellon University to direct one of my favorite plays,” director Annie Tyson said in a university press release. “It is almost a perfect play in that it has a real balance of witty high comedy with a slightly darker underbelly.” Tyson, a visiting director, actor, and teacher from England, also performed in the play in the 1980s and was a visiting lecturer at Carnegie Mellon from 2005 to 2007.
The cast of the show worked well together. The romantic connection between Julia Melville, played by senior acting major Grace Rao, and Faulkland, played by senior musical theater major Jon Jorgenson, provides a nice dynamic in contrast to Lydia’s unending drama. The show also includes monologues in which actors directly address the audience. These longer, individual moments allow the actors to express their interpretations of the characters and to showcase their talents.
The costumes in the show are intricate, from the hairpieces and jewelry to the shoes that each actor wears. In an article on the School of Drama’s website, associate professor of costume production Brian Russman commented on the authenticity of the female costumes. He noted that the school’s costume production students “are making the dresses from the skin out, which includes the proper undergarments for the period like corsets, petticoats, and the appropriate wigs, as well as the trims on the dresses that fashionable ladies of the time would have worn.”
Such attention to detail added to the atmosphere created onstage, especially since very few props were used — never much more than a table, a chair or two, and a tray with drinks. The costumes evoked a sense of period for the audience. Lydia’s costume, in particular, complemented her ditsy demeanor — it was frilly, pink, and topped off with pearls and a head of curls.
The show’s program includes plenty of useful information about the period in which the play was written, as well as insights that make the play even funnier. Mrs. Malaprop’s name is a play on a French phrase mal à propos, which translates to “out of place” or “inappropriate” — fitting, considering her continued misuse of words. Bob Acres’ name is a reference to the land, since he is the only character to come from the country and is presumed to be of a lower class than his fellow men.
Audience reactions to the show were positive. Laughter could be heard throughout the show in response to Mrs. Malaprop’s misuse of words, Bob Acres’ frenzies about getting into a fight, and Lydia’s shrieking and shouting. The combination of different overlapping plot lines culminates in an ending that ties up all the loose ends and gives the audience resolution about what happens next for all of the characters. Another nice touch to the very end of the play is a period-style dance that the entire cast performs together.
Although the play runs over three hours long, it is well worth making time to see and is sure to provide plenty of laughs.
The Rivals will be playing at the Philip Chosky Theater in the Purnell Center until Saturday. For ticket and showtime information, visit www.drama.cmu.edu.

The halls were alive with the sound of music for two hours on Saturday night, as students and their families were swept up by A CaPittsburgh.
Organized by the all-female a cappella group Counterpoint, the event is an annual charity concert that channels the musical talent of collegiate a cappella groups toward a good cause. All six of Carnegie Mellon’s on-campus groups — Soundbytes, Deewane, The Originals, Joyful Noise, Treblemakers, and Counterpoint — performed, and this year they were joined by C Flat Run, a group from the University of Pittsburgh.
The event has been a staple of the Cèilidh Weekend celebrations since 2008, according to Counterpoint president Ellen Obenshain, a senior civil engineering major. “Counterpoint always organizes the event, and this year, since I was president, it was my job. Maggie Bignell was a huge help as well,” Obenshain said. “It’s easy to have this event during the Cèilidh celebration because first of all, it’s a great event for families, and secondly, it’s easy to schedule because so much else is already happening.”
According to Maggie Bignell, junior design major and Counterpoint’s public relations chair, the event normally has a theme and one charity, but this year, three organizations benefited.
“The theme this year is ‘Music is Universal,’ ” Obenshain said. “We decided on three different charities to donate the proceeds to instead of just one.” The three charities this year were Playing For Change Foundation, Mr. Holland’s Opus Fund, and Sonic Peacemakers. These charities each emphasize music in a different way and location, according to Obenshain.
The concert was spirited and fun — the perfect event for families who were visiting and for students catcalling their friends onstage. Rangos Hall was packed for the event, with students standing along the rear and sides of the room. After a phenomenal opening of a Sara Bareilles medley performed by Counterpoint, Soundbytes took the stage to whirl through a set that exhibited an incredible amount of soul and some intense female solos. The power and lung capacity with which the Soundbytes sang — or, more aptly, belted — was beyond imagination, setting the bar high for the rest of the performers.
The second group was the all-male, South Asian group Deewane. Starting off with a remix of One Direction’s “What Makes You Beautiful” and then redeeming themselves in the eyes of hipsters with a remix of Coldplay’s “Fix You,” the group showcased once again its aptitude and flair for blending not only songs, but also cultures. The songs were appropriately energizing and calming, and the pitches were positively heavenly.
Following Deewane was University of Pittsburgh’s C Flat Run, whose highlight piece was “Little Lion Man” by Mumford and Sons. The piece was adapted flawlessly, and the soloist’s reedy voice suited the song perfectly.
After an intermission, The Originals took the stage to wild catcalls and cheering. Staying true to their motto of featuring anything that they can make sound good, The Originals did indeed rock their blue ties in Ellie Goulding’s “Lights.”
Joyful Noise followed The Originals with a witty intro and three songs that took the audience on a spiritual journey: Katy Perry’s “Wide Awake” expressed a sense of brokenness, while the next two evoked joy and salvation. The group possessed an incredible amount of energy and passion for its mission, which was evident to the audience.
The Treblemakers were as energetic as ever, finishing their set with fun.’s recent No. 1 song “Some Nights.” The rendition was enthusiastic and soulful, emulating the pure joy of singing to share a story with the world.
Wrapping up the wonderful evening was Counterpoint, taking the stage once again to perform its set, which rang with emotion and happiness. Each of the groups put on a performance that represented its identity as a group and appealed to the crowd. 
Overall, the event was a smashing success, showcasing the creativity and raw talent of the campus not only to  parents and visitors, but to the student body as well. In an environment where it’s easy to get caught up in studying and forget about the incredible talent of our peers, A CaPittsburgh was a lovely evening of refreshing reminders of the genius of our fellow Carnegie Mellon students. The fact that it was all for a good cause only added a shining, philanthropic vibe to the perfect evening.

For most people, plants are simply part of the background of everyday life. But for certain artists, there is a whole other realm among arched petals and verdant leaves.
The exhibit Portraits of a Garden, a collection of botanical illustrations from the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens (BBG) Florilegium, provides an intimate glimpse into the entrancing world of flora. The Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation, located on the fifth floor of Hunt Library, has been home to works from over 48 American botanical artists on loan from the BBG’s permanent collection, along with never-before-exhibited historical volumes from the Hunt Institute’s own collection.
The BBG is one of the few botanical gardens that houses a florilegium, a compilation of handcrafted illustrations of the plants kept there. The florilegium is a tradition that dates back centuries: The height of its popularity was in the 17th century, when rare and exotic plants discovered on global expeditions were first introduced to European gardens. The wealthy owners of these gardens would then commission artists to produce illustrations of the plants they had collected.
Recently, modern botanical gardens have revived interest in florilegium, especially in the case of rare or endangered plants. Lugene Bruno, the curator of art for the Hunt Institute, emphasized the importance of such practices: “These plants could disappear any number of years from now. We need to keep records of what plants are being grown for hortological and medicinal reasons.”
Portraits of a Garden displays illustrations of only some of the several thousand plants that reside in the BBG, but even this small sampling of flowers, ferns, and trees is incredibly diverse. The exhibit showcases plants from all around the world, in a variety of colors and shapes. Among them are ferns that resemble the tail feathers of an ostrich and plants that look like they belong in a surrealist painting rather than in the real world.
Equally as fascinating as the subject matter is the artistic talent behind the florilegium. The sheer technical brilliance of the works is staggering. Whether in vibrant watercolor, crisp lines of ink, or careful strokes of pencil, each of the pieces not only painstakingly recreates each vein and fiber of its subject, but also radiates an inherent personality that the artist bestows upon them. For instance, Carol Hamilton’s triptych of an apricot branch conveys a zen-like sense of serenity, while Margaret Farr’s cherry blossoms idyllically float in everlasting spring.
“These artists are calling attention to the plant, their history, and how they’re used,” Bruno said of the artists. “They’re getting people to pay closer attention to the world around them.” Truly, the power of the exhibit lies not only in its ability to introduce its audience to a whole new world, but also to imbue them with a sense of appreciation for the world already around them.
Portraits of a Garden runs through Dec. 16; the Hunt Institute's operating hours are available online at huntbot.andrew.cmu.edu.

Musical phrases danced across Kresge Theatre shortly before the Carnegie Mellon Wind Ensemble was scheduled to start, as a few performers squeezed in one last round of warm-ups while the audience slowly filled the seats. Presented in conjunction with Cèilidh Weekend, the concert drew many students and their families last Saturday afternoon.
The concert was conducted by both George Vosburgh, artist lecturer in the School of Music and principal trumpet for the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO), and Thomas Thompson, an associate teaching professor in the School of Music and co-principal clarinetist for the PSO.
As opposed to the standard orchestra attire of dark colors, the musicians sported bright pastels and radiant smiles as they took their places on stage. With about 30 performers — less than half the size of a regular symphony orchestra — the wind ensemble certainly had expectations to live up to, expectations that it met as the concert unfolded.
The ensemble opened with composer Arnold Schoenberg’s “Fanfare on Motifs” from Die Gurrelieder, a cantata (a vocal composition involving instrumental accompaniment) conducted by Vosburgh. It started off light and catchy before it rose with a formidable crescendo, which made this an appropriate, attention-grabbing opening piece that drew the audience in right from the beginning.
When the performers reshuffled to move into composer Charles Gounod’s Petite Symphonie, the baton was passed to Thompson. Petite Symphonie began on a somber and melodious note with its first movement “Adagio,” before jumping into an animated “Allegro” movement.
The three other movements of Gounod’s nonet (a composition for an ensemble of nine musicians) for winds offered a pleasant variety of interwoven tones and moods, especially with its upbeat, waltz-like “Finale.” The harmony of the flute, clarinet, horn, and bassoon was mesmerizing.
As there was no intermission, Vosburgh took the stage once more, and this time, the group was noticeably smaller. Nevertheless, there was undoubtedly no change in ardor and passion as the performers launched into composer Robert Kurka’s The Good Soldier Schweik Suite. The opera on which the suite is based is set during World War I, when a soldier named Schweik is arrested for making innocuous political remarks, but is deemed mentally unstable and sent to an insane asylum. His stay is short-lived, and he volunteers for duty in the army, where he is passed from official to official. Eventually sent to the front, he wanders off while on patrol. With a storyline as rich as this, it was no wonder that the piece was intense.
The perfectly apt closing piece was composer Ralph Vaughan Williams’ Sea Songs. The musicians filled the stage as the spotlight fell on Thompson once more. Sea Songs, with merry melodies and an animated tempo, certainly left the audience feeling happy and satisfied as they filed into the Alumni Concert Hall across Kresge Theatre for a reception, where an array of desserts and drinks was served.
With pieces so pertinent to a relaxing and beautiful weekend, it would not be surprising that everyone left the Carnegie Mellon Wind Ensemble concert on a blissful note.

Scotch’n’Soda held its fifth annual Charity Cabaret, charmingly named Sips of Scotch, in Rangos Hall last Friday night. They raised $1,400 from ticket sales, and proceeds went to the Alumni Theater Company, a non-profit organization that provides the opportunity for Pittsburgh youth to participate in the performing arts.
Will Weiner, president of Scotch’n’Soda and a senior economics and statistics and decision science double major, said that the theater group is working on forming a lasting relationship with the Alumni Theater Company, since its mission is “something [we] really identify with.”
Whereas many cabaret-style shows can become monotonous presenting act after act, Sips of Scotch succeeded in keeping the audience engaged from beginning to end. Each performer had something different to offer, which positively contributed to the show as a whole. Performances included “All For You” from Seussical The Musical, sung by sophomore decision science major Jessie Benenson; “Gethsemane” from Jesus Christ Superstar, sung by sophomore voice major Ethan Crystal; and “Gimme Gimme” from Thoroughly Modern Millie, sung by sophomore voice major Joanna Latini.
“It was actually kind of like a shotgun process,” said Cory Williams, a Sips of Scotch performer and junior information systems major, describing how the show was put together. Despite only having a couple of weeks between auditions and the show, as well as an extremely limited rehearsal schedule, the students managed to put on an excellent performance. The audience members praised the show for its variety; every performer was present on the stage at some point during the night. From dark humor to lighthearted romance and from the outrageously goofy to the passionately dramatic, the acts did well to demonstrate the theatrical and vocal diversity of the performers.
“Eric [Dietz], the music director, would coach them on their songs, and make them a little better than they brought them to the auditions,” said Stephen Murphy, the energetic accompanist of the night and a sophomore double majoring in piano and music composition. Dietz, a senior music composition major, organized the opening and final group numbers, which presented amazing harmonies and vocal talent. Dietz was pleased with the performers, and said, “They did a really wonderful job.”
A group of five students from the Alumni Theater Company opened the second act, performing “Seasons of Love” from Rent with impressive talent. The company puts a large emphasis on representing the lives of the youth through their shows, and also encourages student-written work. According to its website, the organization will be performing an original work, which opens next Friday, titled, Why Don’t You Come Around My Way?
Nigel Rowe, a junior voice major and Sips of Scotch performer, said, “It’s always a lot of fun working with Scotch’n’Soda,” due to the relaxed atmosphere and camaraderie among members. It was apparent through the performances that the students were enjoying themselves, which transferred to the enjoyment of the audience. Scotch’n’Soda did well to kick off its 75th anniversary year with this musical performance.

Looper, released in theaters Sept. 28, does the seemingly impossible: It sidesteps the usual problems of time travel movies and focuses instead on character. Directed by Rian Johnson, the film uses time travel as a tool throughout the story.
The film is set in the year 2044, when economic collapse has led to a wave of organized crime. Joe Simmons, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, is a member of a group of killers called “loopers,” which uses time travel to target its victims. The futuristic science fiction tale follows Simmons as he tries to track down his older self, played by Bruce Willis.
The movie handles time travel, dicey in the best of circumstances, with grace and humor. Instead of trying to explain the mechanics of something impossible, Johnson merely has the characters gloss over the finer points. This choice allows the audience to focus on the story and characters instead of getting bogged down by the nitty-gritty details of time travel theory; this is where Johnson shines in the movie.
Johnson shows real strength as a writer and director through his characters, especially through Simmons. Simmons is a romantically misunderstood hero; he is the type of character that Hollywood rarely laughs at, but Johnson isn’t afraid to portray him as endearingly incompetent. At one point, Simmons’ older self knocks out his younger self with a comically weak punch. Simmons is also rescued by a five-year-old twice.
Johnson’s light portrayal of Simmons is as amusing as it is refreshing, and this actually helps the time travel angle. Simmons is not the same as his older self; although they are the same person, older Simmons is more experienced than is his younger self. Younger Simmons’ occasional incompetency helps show that time travel has created two people who share the same memories, but that they are not the same person.
However, some of Johnson’s other characters lack the same freshness. Specifically, most of his female characters — there are only three in the entire movie — are stilted and unrealistic. Among them are a showgirl/prostitute and older Simmons’ wife, who looks entirely too young to be making out with Willis, and who literally never speaks.
The third is Sara, played by Emily Blunt. Of the three, Blunt’s character is the most well-developed. Sara’s relationship with younger Simmons is reasonably well-articulated, though the sexual relationship that inevitably develops has almost no real basis. Johnson leans on the typical Hollywood expectation that the beautiful boy and the beautiful girl, having been within 10 feet of each other, will obviously have sex. Given the strength of characterization of Simmons and his older self, this use of cliché is disappointing.
Although these problems of character have a negative impact on the plot, the movie is fantastically well done overall. Time travel is a storytelling tool, not a major focus of the movie, and the two main characters are fresh and interesting. Johnson takes a complex and convoluted story and tells it in a simple and extremely entertaining way.

When one thinks of Tim Burton, a few things come to mind: Dark themes, stop motion animation, and Johnny Depp. Burton’s newest film — released last month — brings two of those to the screen, but leaves Depp at home.
Frankenweenie is the story of a boy and his dog, with a monster-movie twist. The film opens with the shockingly normal Frankenstein family watching a short film young Victor has made starring his dog Sparky, who saves the day from a monster attacking the town. His parents are impressed, but they worry Victor’s introverted nature will have a negative effect on his development. They make him join a baseball league so he will interact with his peers. However, after Victor hits an unlikely home run, Sparky is tragically struck by a car while chasing the home run ball. Victor is inconsolable, until he learns about the wonderful effects of electricity on the nervous system from his science teacher at New Holland Elementary.
In many ways, Frankenweenie is a homage to the monster-movie genre. The town of New Holland, complete with a Hollywood-esque sign and an old fashioned wooden windmill, is home to a number of freak lightning strikes and strange characters. The girl next door is named Elsa Van Helsing, and a few of Victor’s classmates look like Frankenstein, a hunchback, and Wednesday Addams. Burton even gives Elsa’s dog a hairdo that would make the bride of Frankenstein proud. These sorts of references take Frankenweenie beyond the genre of a children’s movie and make it enjoyable for a wider audience.
While Frankenweenie succeeds as a source of entertainment, there are implications at several stages of the movie about the ethics of scientific experimentation and the state of science education. For example, after it has come to light that Victor reanimated Sparky, the parents of the New Holland community rise up against Mr. Rzykruski, the children’s science teacher. When he is allowed to defend himself, Mr. Rzykruski condemns the parents for being ignorant of science and writing it off as magic just because they do not understand how it works. This is a one-off encounter of the theme of education that could have played a much larger role in the resolution of the story.
Frankenweenie is an adaptation of an earlier project Burton did for Disney, but it was reworked into his trademark stop motion animation style. In terms of the animation, Burton’s reputation for excellent cinematography holds true for Frankenweenie, the first black-and-white feature film to be released in IMAX. Although some scenes could have been enhanced with 3-D technology, there is no point at which it seems essential to the story. It is easy to see Burton’s love of tall, skinny characters in all of his works, as the actual animation in Frankenweenie bears a strong resemblance to that of Corpse Bride.
The humorous references to iconic monster movies as well as the emotional content of the story work together wonderfully to add another classic to Burton’s filmography.

Dear Patrick,
I’ve been playing the whole interview game for weeks now, and I’m exhausted. “What did you do at your job last summer?” “What exactly are you willing to do for this job, if you catch my drift?” “Can I get your personal number?” These recruiters are really aggressive, and flying off to all these interviews is leaving me seriously jetlagged! What can I do?
Thanks,
Job Overabundance Bemusing, Harassed Unceasingly, Need To End Demand
Dear JOB HUNTED,
You don’t have a problem, you’re just bragging. “Boo hoo, so many companies want to hire me. Whatever will I do?” Give me a break. You don’t have to take these interviews — you like the attention. Go ahead and enjoy it while you can, but don’t go rubbing it in everyone else’s faces.
If these interviews are really so taxing for you, then actually start turning them down. It’s college applications all over again — keep interviewing with your top choices, but keep a couple of safeties in your back pocket in case you get rejected. Or do what I did and just apply to one place. You’ll probably be fine. Or living back home with your parents.
No one likes your first-world problem,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
That guy who wrote the other letter sucks. I’ve had my résumé out there for months, and I haven’t had any bites. I would kill to be hounded by recruiters. What can I do to get some interviews going?
Help,
Requesting Employment, Job, Every Company Terminates Ensuing Discussion
Dear REJECTED,
Glad to hear you have an actual problem, unlike that other jerk. He’s like the hot chick at the party, and you’re the quiet girl in the corner at the beginning of every ’80s high school comedy. You need the same solution: makeover montage! Just pop in your earbuds, assemble your ’80s pop music playlist, and head over to the Career Center. They are actually paid to get you a job.
But remember that jobs are like trains: At the end of the night, you gotta hop on the last one coming by. We can’t all work for Google. Be grateful for whatever work you can get, because there are people out there with families to support that would love a job. Don’t turn down a job because it’s not “good enough.” If it pays, it’s good.
Your parents don’t want you back home either,
Patrick Hoskins

An advertisement for the Carnegie Mellon Ski Club plays on the idea that most men at the school are looking for female company. Where can girls be found? Apathy toward university sports apparently plagues Carnegie Mellon throughout the ages, but the author insists that Ski Club has women and spirit.

The hyphen between Carnegie and Mellon has been dropped, the University has a new logo, and the Tech House’s future is uncertain. Students speculate that these large-scale changes contribute to the lack of school spirit that they are constantly accused of having.

In honor of Homecoming weekend, The Tartan asks visiting alumni from the ’50s and ’70s what has changed most from their time at Carnegie Mellon. A Margaret Morrison College home economics alumna from 1952 says, “The tuition. It was only $300 a month when I was here.” Go ahead, it’s okay to cry.

U.S. Airways cuts the number of gates it has at the Pittsburgh International Airport from 38 to 20, dropping from 108 to 68 flights a day. It’s no wonder that the airport constantly feels abandoned. This also explains the bizarre “alternate security checkpoint” that brings passengers to an abandoned lot.

Carnegie Mellon introduces its newest club sport: Quidditch. The team trains twice a week and joins the ranks of over 100 other teams training for the World Cup in New York City later in the year. All of this excitement takes place while the students ride broomsticks, naturally.

Despite a solid body of work in the last decade, Wes Anderson’s most recent outing shows him at his most mature. Moonrise Kingdom follows Sam and Suzy, two misfit preteens on the wealthy East Coast island of New Penzance. The fable almost spins into a parable as Anderson brings in a parade of evocative biblical imagery. To complement Anderson’s trademark meticulous art design, viewers get a series of full performances from Edward Norton, Bruce Willis, Frances McDormand, and two newcomers Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward.

With Election Day less than a month away, candidates are making a hard push to sway voters and inform constituents of their platforms. President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, verbally sparred at Colorado’s Denver University for the first 2012 Presidential Debate on Wednesday. Jim Lehrer, a journalist from PBS, moderated. A massive number of Americans viewed the debate; according to Nielsen ratings, over 67 million people nationwide tuned in.
Meanwhile, about 1,500 miles away, Carnegie Mellon students flocked to McConomy Auditorium to watch. Although concerns like student loans were not discussed, the candidates nevertheless delved into various pressing issues facing the nation.
Romney came into the debate with lower expectations from viewers. Trailing in most swing states, according to various polls, Romney was not favored to be a stronger debater than Obama; a CNN/ORC poll showed that 59 percent of likely voters felt Obama would have the stronger debate, compared to just 34 percent for Romney. However, he surprised many with a strong, aggressive, and determined performance that kept Obama on the defensive.
Regarding the economy, Romney assured middle-class voters that he would reduce tax rates for them without increasing the deficit or decreasing tax rates for the wealthy. In a comical moment, Romney remarked — in front of Lehrer — “I’m sorry, Jim, I’m going to stop the subsidy to PBS. I’m going to stop other things. I like PBS, I love Big Bird.”
Romney also repeatedly denied the President’s claim that he had a $5 trillion tax cut in his plan. Obama responded by accusing his challenger of suddenly changing his mind, saying that “now, five weeks before the election, [Romney’s] plan is ‘never mind.’ ”
Romney said that he plans on repealing Dodd-Frank, a bill signed into law in 2010, because he feels it is negatively impacting mortgages and small banks while unfairly favoring certain groups as being “too big to fail.”
His plan to repeal Obamacare — a law signed in 2010 to overhaul the American health system — was also made clear. Regarding both plans, Romney said that he would repeal the previous laws and replace them with other statutes that would retain the positive aspects of Dodd-Frank and Obamacare.
After hearing his challenger’s proclamations, Obama responded by questioning Romney on his lack of details about which parts of the bills he wished to keep or replace. Obama also questioned why he would want Obamacare to be repealed, considering the fact that it was written using the health care plan Romney signed into law while governor of Massachusetts. 
Romney responded to this oft-repeated criticism by saying that while the Massachusetts health care plan made sense in a state situation, it should not be a federal law that applies to every state in the nation; he reasoned that health care should be determined on a state-by-state basis.
The two candidates did both agree about education needing to be excellent; however, this did not stop either from throwing barbs. Obama frequently stated that while he has supported increasing spending on the public school system, Romney would cut funds to such schools while attempting to lower the nation’s deficit. Romney denied these claims. He noted that while he was the governor of the state, Massachusetts had the top public school system in the nation.
He remarked, “You’re entitled, President, as the president, to your own airplane and your own house, but not to your own facts.... I’m not going to cut education funding.” Regarding Obama’s education program, Race to the Top, Romney conceded that he agreed with “some” of its ideas, but again, he did not provide specifics.
Following the debate, many felt Romney had fared better. A CNN/ORC poll conducted immediately after the debate showed that 67 percent of Americans felt Romney was stronger, compared to only 25 percent for Obama. Romney appeared relaxed and more poised, while Obama maintained a defensive, serious, and professional tone.
There was also no mention of Romney’s infamous 47 percent comments, in which he claimed the President’s supporters are dependent on the government and welfare. Evidently, many felt the President’s cautious, “safe” debating strategy was not as effective as Romney’s more aggressive approach.
Carnegie Mellon students who watched the debate in McConomy took away different opinions.
Ben Burgess, a first-year music major, said, “The debate was well done in the sense that both candidates were prepared to debate. They were both prepared for each other, and I respect that. I do think that Romney ended up being on offense [more] than Obama was, making points that Obama could not respond to well.”
Aaron Zhang, a junior electrical and computer engineering major, said, “I think [Obama and Romney] have the same opinions, but just want to disagree with each other.”
Whether or not the debate will have a lasting effect on voters’ decisions is still unclear. “It would appear that Romney put forth stronger, more deliberate points, but I still didn’t like the way that he went to such lengths to enforce his views on the debate,” Burgess said. “I’m not convinced Romney’s the candidate for us, so for now I’ll stick with Obama.”
However, a recent Rasmussen poll has shown that in Ohio, Romney now has a 51–48 percent advantage over the President among voters who are definitely voting, and that following the debate, among individuals nationwide who are certain to vote, 50 percent said they would vote for Obama while 49 percent supported Romney.
Make sure to tune in to the vice presidential debate on Thursday, and the town hall-style presidential debate next Tuesday.

The Mayur South Asian Student Alliance (Mayur SASA), along with the Muslim Student Alliance and OM, celebrated both Diwali, a Hindu holiday, and Eid al-Adha, a Muslim holiday, in Wiegand Gymnasium on Thursday. The actual date of this year’s Diwali is Nov. 13, while Eid al-Adha is on Oct. 26. According to Sanjana Padmanabhan, first-year chemical engineering major and first-year representative in Mayur SASA, “We’re combining [Diwali] with Eid because it’s around the same time.”
“Diwali is the festival of lights,” said Meghna Raghunathan, junior design major and president of Mayur SASA. “It’s a religious celebration ... of Rama bringing Sita back from Sri Lanka to India.”
Sruti Modekurty, a first-year electrical and computer engineering major who attended the event, went into further detail about the significance of Diwali for Hindus. “Diwali celebrates the return of a king who was forced into exile by his stepmother,” Modekurty said. “The king’s name is Rama, and he was in exile in the forest for 14 years, so everyone in his home town celebrated his return.... Diwali celebrates the return of him from exile and him taking over, becoming king again.”
Modekurty also described how Diwali is traditionally celebrated: “We decorate our front lawn with tea lights. And then sometimes we put up Christmas lights around our house, and we usually make sweets and dress up and stuff. And sometimes we set off firecrackers.”
Amulya Uppala, a first-year computer science major, shared how she celebrated Diwali at home. “There’s a lot of food, a lot [of firecrackers]. That’s the main part.... Basically, you have so many different types of firecrackers, you play with them the entire night.” Appropriately, Wiegand Gymnasium was strung with Christmas lights and decorated by electric tea candles spread across the floor.
Eid al-Adha is an Islamic celebration of sacrifice. Iman Mazloum, a first-year international relations and politics major and member of the Muslim Students Association, explained the religious history of Eid. When Abraham was told to sacrifice his son, Ishmael, “Abraham closed his eyes and struck down his blade, and when he opened his eyes, in the place of his son was a sheep,” she said. Mazloum explained that Eid usually involves “a charity of normally a sheep to those in need.”
The Diwali/Eid celebration kicked off with South Indian food catered by a local restaurant; a variety of booths around the room had games, henna tattoos, face painting, and other activities. The Mayur SASA and Muslim Students Association also had their own tables. Halfway into the event, the performances began, opened by the first prayer of the Quran, led by Mazloum, and another prayer led by the members of OM, an organization that describes itself as “an independent, nonsectarian forum for the education and promotion of Indian cultural heritage” on its website.
Following the prayers were exhibitions from Carnegie Mellon’s South Asian dance teams, including Carnegie Mellon Raasta — a dance team that practices the West Indian folk dance garba-raas — and Carnegie Mellon’s official Bhangra team.
Teja Shah, a senior biomedical and mechanical engineering major, did a solo dance routine as well. There was also a performance by Neel Kadkarni, a junior business administration major, who sang songs by a renowned Indian singer, Mohammed Rafi. Kadkarni was assisted by Tejavir Singh Rekhi, a first-year art major, on the tabla. The last performance of the event was by members of the executive board of Mayur SASA, who all danced to an Indian remix of PSY’s “Gangnam Style.”
Although Diwali and Eid al-Adha are still upcoming, the celebration in Wiegand Gymnasium captured the spirit of the holidays for Cèilidh Weekend. As Padmanabhan said, it was a great time “just to bring everyone together.”

Since 1950, the Alumni Association has organized the annual Alumni Awards ceremony to honor the contributions of distinguished graduates, faculty, and students. Approximately 300 people attended this year’s ceremony, held on Friday in Rangos Hall.
Vice President for University Advancement, Alumni Relations, and Annual Giving Andy Shaindlin; Alumni Association President Antoinette Ungaretti; and University President Jared Cohon introduced the honorees and spoke briefly about the alumni association and awards ceremony.
“This event is something I look forward to every year,” Cohon said. “It’s the one moment each year when we pause to celebrate all our alumni and what the alumni mean to this institution. These are remarkable people.”
The first awards were Student Service Awards, given to Meg Hayes (HSS ’11, HNZ ’12) and current senior policy and management and statistics double major Sonia Siok. This award recognizes current students’ service to the university community and surrounding Pittsburgh community. Siok is a mentor through her position of house council president and her membership in Amnesty International and Student Government.
“Seeing these students grow and learn has been and will continue to be one of the greatest rewards of my student service,” Siok said.
The Honorary Award was given to Dean of University Libraries Gloriana St. Clair. This award is rarely given out and recognizes the honoree’s unwavering support to the university, student body, and community.
St. Clair was named an Honorary Alumna for her work with the Million Book Project, Carnegie Mellon’s Osher Lifelong Learning Institute, and more.
“The quality of instruction here over the last 14 years has been awesome,” St. Clair said. “I’ve learned so much from my colleagues and students. I learned to think globally, use duct tape, and be tough. I learned to inspire others, create change, be ready to reposition, tell your story, and that olives aren’t just for martinis.”
Recent Alumni Awards were given to Sam Franklin (HNZ ’07) and Jordan Jamieson Green (CIT ’03). This award recognizes professional accomplishment or service to the university by those who have graduated within the last 10 years. 
Green is an assistant professor of biomedical engineering at Johns Hopkins University and a co-founder of Johns Hopkins’ Translational Tissue Engineering Center. 
“Carnegie Mellon built such a strong foundation on the professional and personal side,” Green remarked. “I met my future wife in Calc 3-D. I can’t imagine where I would be in my life without Carnegie Mellon.”
Erik Larson (TSB ’96) and Jeffrey Meckler (TSB ’89, ’90) both received Alumni Service Awards. Larson is a partner for Accenture, a global management consulting company, and the president of the Carnegie Mellon Chicago Alumni chapter.
“Two things came back to me while walking around campus,” Larson said. “The pride and energy of students and faculty. It’s that passion that gets you up at 4 a.m. to push buggies up a hill and also what makes you want to bring something back to the university community.”
Five Alumni Achievement Awards were given to Dara Birnbaum (CFA ’69), Kevin Dowling (MCS ’83, SCS ’94, ’97), H. Scott Matthews (CIT ’92, TSB ’96, ’99), Paul Rizzo (CIT ’63, ’64, ’66), and Kenneth Russell (CIT ’64). This award recognizes accomplishments and leadership in the honoree’s field.
Birnbaum is a renowned feminist artist whose work explores gender roles. “Running across both boys and girls in the architecture school today really made me feel like the school had grown,” Birnbaum said. She was the only female student in her architecture class of 1969.
Dowling was the first employee at Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute, and helped to build NASA’s mobile robots and the first self-driving car. He is now vice president for research and development at MC10, a company that develops electronic systems, and serves on Carnegie Mellon’s School of Computer Science advisory board.
“My wife and I both graduated from Carnegie Mellon, and we have a kid here now,” he said. “We bleed plaid.”
Russell is a professor emeritus of metallurgy and nuclear engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and mentored several students who later became Carnegie Mellon faculty members.
“It’s really, really rewarding to receive more from a school that’s already given me so much,” Russell said. “I started looking around for more education, and most of my engineer buddies were working night degrees at Carnegie.... I came to Carnegie after being accepted at three other places and never regretted it.”
Three alumni — Margaret Johnston (MCS ’72), John Shaffner (CFA ’76), and Joe Stewart (CFA ’77) — received Distinguished Achievement Awards. The award recognizes longevity and consistency of accomplishment over one’s professional lifetime and is not awarded every year.
Johnston is a senior program officer managing tuberculosis vaccine and HIV research funding for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. For over 20 years, she worked for the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and became a global leader in HIV vaccine research.
“Very little that I’ve accomplished has been as an individual, but as a team,” she said. “There are hundreds of people who have helped me do what I do.”
Shaffner and Stewart are award winning television production designers and have used their firm, Production Design by Shaffner/Stewart, to help School of Drama students make connections in the entertainment industry. 
They have worked on projects such as The Big Bang Theory and The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Shaffner and Stewart have won seven Emmy Awards and an Art Directors Guild Award.
Cohon closed the ceremony with a short speech on the importance of alumni to the university. 
“These alumni are living, breathing manifestations and representations of what Carnegie Mellon is all about,” he said. “It shows us the power of our values and the power of this institution.”

General Stanley McChrystal, four-star general of the U.S. Army and former commander of U.S. and international forces in Afghanistan, focused on relationships in terms of achieving strategic objectives during his lecture at Carnegie Mellon last Friday.
McChrystal presented to an audience of around 400 Carnegie Mellon students, faculty, parents, and alumni in McConomy Auditorium.
By taking a philosophical approach toward strategic issues, McChrystal employed both military and personal examples during his presentation as a means of offering applicable advice to his audience.
He pointed out that, during war, military generals tend to lose sight of relationships while focusing on certain strategic military objectives.
“In Afghanistan, what I think we did to a great degree was try to drive around the people,” McChrystal said. “We tried to focus on the enemy, focus on the Taliban, focus on Al Qaeda. [However], if we ignore the relationships with the people at individual, organizational, or national levels, [we] miss the point.”
“Relationships are the strategic intermediate objective. They are not a byproduct of getting something done; they are a way to get something done,” he added.
McChrystal applied his experience seeking and maintaining relationships to the battlefield, explaining that relationships with civilians played a crucial role during his tenure as a general.
“Relationships were not between me and the soldiers that I had grown up with; I needed relationships with kids, females, bearded elders who had a different culture — and I had to build real relationships, not just superficial transactional [ones],” he said.
McChrystal believes that focusing on relationships with civilians during war can keep ethical groundings in check.
Concerning the inevitable deaths of civilians during war, McChrystal said, “I think that ethics are more important during war than [during] any other time because you have things going on that put people at risk, and so your own ethical foundation needs to be extraordinarily strong. People do get hurt in war, and unfortunately, a lot of the time it’s civilians — but what we can never do is let loose of our ethical moorings.”
The general added that listening is the key factor to sound relationships.
“If you never listen, you’ll be surprised, [because people] stop talking to you and you don’t know why,” he said. “It’s extraordinarily important to have a relationship and listen, whether you agree with them or not. It’s better to have a relationship that you disagree with so that you’ll have something to fall back on when complications occur.”
Shifting gears to cite a personal anecdote, McChrystal referenced his relationship with his son to show how building bonds helped to achieve his goal.
Despite his son’s rebellious haircut choices and lack of educational drive, McChrystal said that during his son’s high school and college years, he tried to focus on their relationship instead of their disagreements.
“We maintained this close relationship because I figured that with time, he would turn out all right at some point, which is of course what happened,” he said.
McChrystal’s son is currently a counter-terrorist analyst. “If we had broken the relationship earlier at some point, I don’t think any of that would have happened,” McChrystal said. “[The relationship] is the essential enabler.”
McChrystal also pushed the importance of relationships on a larger scale, using the fall of America’s GDP and the subsequent decline in U.S. global economic prevalence as an example. 
He explained that this downfall should not be a hindrance, but rather a reminder that it is becoming increasingly more important to build relationships with other nations.
During World War I, America held 46 percent of the world’s gross domestic product. According to McChrystal, by 2030, that percentage of U.S. GDP will have sunk to 22.8 percent. He said that this regression “doesn’t mean that we won’t be a great country anymore, it just means that we won’t be the only important country anymore.”
“Instead of one world leader, we now have groups of world leaders of which we must be credible and legitimate members,” he said.
McChrystal highlighted empathy and self-discipline as traits that display good command. He said, “If you can’t put yourself in somebody else’s position, it’s really hard to lead people. It’s hard to convince them that you’re thinking about them.”
McChrystal’s lecture was sponsored by Carnegie Mellon’s Center for International Relations and Politics (CIRP) and the Humanities Scholars Program.
Kiron Skinner, associate professor of social and decision sciences and director of CIRP, said, “I thought that [the most salient point of McChrystal’s lecture] was that he focused on people, because a lot of time when we think about war it’s about bombs and bullets and killing people and breaking things, but he really talked about the role that people play in healing nations and overcoming conflict. For a four-star [general] to make that kind of argument was extremely profound, and I think it will affect many of our students who are thinking about a career in national security.”
Students responded positively to McChrystal’s talk, saying that they enjoyed receiving a different kind of perspective on military strategies.
Sophomore international relations and politics major Jamison Howell said, “When you meet with a lot of political leaders it’s always great to know where they are coming from, and you don’t really get that from military personnel. However, [McChrystal’s lecture] showed that they are very compassionate, very understanding, and there’s a lot that goes into [warfare] — it’s a much more complex system, and I loved being able to hear about that.”
First-year international relations major Ariel Lee said, “I liked that McChrystal brought to our attention the fact that we have to look beyond the military’s immediate strategic goals toward the relationships we build with other people. When we attack other countries, it becomes a very impersonal thing because we’re not putting American civilians at risk, but we can’t lose sight that our enemies are actual people as well.”
McChrystal resigned from his position as commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan after he was quoted in a 2010 Rolling Stone article criticizing the Obama administration. He retired from his position as U.S. general shortly thereafter, and he currently teaches a course on leadership at Yale University.

About 200 people gathered for Project Olympus's annual show-and-tell presentation on Thursday in Rashid Auditorium.
Project Olympus is an initiative meant to provide students with the opportunity to build their own start-up companies. It has a show-and-tell event every year, where students, alumni, and faculty present their projects to dozens of businesses and companies.
Computer science professor Lenore Blum, the founding director, described Project Olympus’s success.
“The past few years, we’ve had 105 [projects] and around 68 have become companies,” she said. “Of these, we have received $20 million in first-level funding, and a remarkable two-thirds have been students in these companies."
The projects at the show-and-tell ranged across many disciplines.
Associate professor of chemistry Danith Ly presented a project on the future of curing diseases. His model described how to tackle curing multiple diseases by linking the solutions to DNA and RNA. 
Ly's project was followed by one from Ph.D. student Chris Harrison. Harrison was named by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as one of the Top 35 Innovators Under 35. He presented a project that focused on the future of cellphones and digital technology. He brought to light the idea of how cell phones can be built to project images anywhere — even on the owner’s hand.
Following Harrison's presentation was a project by robotics associate research professor Paul Scerri. Scerri's project was based on a robotic airboat that could be mobilized by an Android phone. The airboat's features included low cost, cooperative behavior, and a recharge station.
“I first came up with the idea 18 months ago,” Scerri said. “Normal research funding was hard and we didn’t know how to deal with the commercial appeal of the project. Project Olympus really helped out by setting us up with the right connections and teaching us business strategies. It helped out with [the] marketing and administering the business side of the project.”
Scerri, like most others, was generally optimistic about the effect Project Olympus had on his idea. He described the atmosphere of the event as “genuinely exciting.” He found solace in meeting with other innovators and seeing them go through the same process and difficulties.
One attendee at the Project Olympus show-and-tell was Ryan Longeway. Longeway is a University of Pittsburgh alumnus, but took classes at Carnegie Mellon. He expressed interest in helping young entrepreneurs with their start-ups.
“I really love helping people out,” he said. “I’m here to both advise and recruit.”
Scerri had words of advice for anyone pursuing the entrepreneurship path: “Entrepreneurship is not a linear path of success; when one idea fails, try another one.”

Researchers receive grant to preserve executable content
Carnegie Mellon computer scientists and library staff, led by Dean of University Libraries, Gloriana St. Clair, have received a grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services to develop Olive, an archiving system for the preservation of executable content.
The project was endorsed by U.S. Representative Mike Doyle (D-Pa.), who wrote, as quoted in a university press release, “[Olive] seeks to address a pressing and ever-growing need to preserve and maintain, through a revolutionary new type of archival system, executable content in its original form.”
“Preserving these scholarly products of computer science research and making them accessible for future researchers has tremendous relevance for ensuring the accurate and reliable history of intellectual property to resolve issues of licensing and security constraints. For this reason, I believe the project will yield important benefits for government and industry,” he added.
The first content that Olive will preserve includes  test cases such as deprecated and hardware-intensive gaming software, executable academic research articles, and educational software such as the 1994 Great American History Machine.
Software professor granted  Distinguished Educator award
Anthony Wasserman, a professor of software management practice at Carnegie Mellon’s Silicon Valley campus, has been awarded the Distinguished Educator Award from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).
Wasserman — who is a fellow of the Association of Computing Machinery, a life fellow of the IEEE, and a director of the Open Source Initiative — has spent time both in academia and industry. He served as the founder and CEO of Interactive Development Environments, and led engineering for a dot com start-up company in the ’90s.
“I’m very pleased to receive this award because it’s always an honor to be recognized by one’s peers. It’s particularly rewarding to see innovative course and curriculum ideas widely adopted. I’m very proud of the programs I have helped to develop here at CMU,” Wasserman said in a university press release.
“Teaching graduate students requires staying current on rapidly changing software technology and identifying what topics will be valuable to them in their long careers,” he said. “My courses change every time I teach them.”

We said it last year, and we’ll say it again: Cèilidh weekend needs to be better advertised.
The Homecoming-International Festival-Family Weekend extravaganza made its debut last fall and, as noted by our Editorial Board's review of the event last year, it was in desperate need of more cohesive branding and aggressive marketing. 
This year’s Cèilidh Weekend seems to have fallen even farther behind on making its presence known ahead of time. Last year, signs announcing the weekend-long event could be found around the University Center and across the Cut. This year, minimal signage was on display, making it hard for students — especially first-years — to become aware of the festivities.
The event coordinators seem to have continued to market Cèilidh via social networking — a great tool for spreading information if used successfully. 
Unfortunately, this strategy didn’t work this year. With 116 “likes” on its Facebook page, Cèilidh Weekend 2012 didn’t get the exposure it needed. There needs to be a greater level of public awareness of the event before social media can be used effectively to promote it. 
Furthermore, the only link the Facebook page has to more information takes the user to last year’s schedule of events. This obscures the information vital to the hoped for success of Cèilidh 2012.
If Cèilidh is truly going to be a success for students and alumni alike, it must be promoted to the student body more effectively. It must market itself as a fall version of Spring Carnival: Align it with fall break to give students a breather and time to enjoy the events and their families, include more student-run events, and ruthlessly promote it to the student body.
Often students feel unaware of Cèilidh Weekend, and when they are, they are stressed because they don’t have the time to enjoy the events. If the coordinators want students to participate in Cèilidh Weekend and establish it as a lasting tradition, we must be given the information and time to do so.

The overwhelming sentiment among my peers when I talk about this election is as follows: “Well, I’m disappointed in Obama, but I just couldn’t bring myself to vote for a Republican.” 
When asked why, they will almost always reply, “Well I just can’t vote for someone who’s against gay marriage and pro-life.”
Are we really that naive? I’m a strong libertarian. I think the government shouldn’t be able to tell you what to do with your money, and I also think the government shouldn’t be able to tell you what to do with your body or who you can marry. Your right to swing your fist ends where my nose begins. But the view of most young voters is currently the status quo, and it takes absolutely no leadership, conviction, audacity, or skill for a politician to take a stance for or against either of those two issues. They’re not changing and everyone knows it.
We supported President Barack Obama when he was against gay marriage in 2008. Only recently did he change his personal support, but he never changed his official view. Obama and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in fact share the same view on the issue. Both want to leave it to the states to decide if same-sex couples can get married. That’s the status quo. Regardless of who holds the Oval Office come January, gay marriage at the federal level will be unchanged. Obama is pro-choice, Romney is pro-life. It’ll take a constitutional amendment to overturn Roe v. Wade.
If you as a voter have any faith in the belligerent, bicameral mess that is our legislative branch of government to garner enough support to pass a constitutional amendment, and then that three-fourths of the state legislatures will ratify such an amendment, then you’re a better person than I. The only thing Congress has done that I can remember in recent history is declare pizza a vegetable.
It’s really easy for Obama to go on some talk show and tell the world that he is for gay marriage. He doesn’t have to push for it in Congress, and he hasn’t made a big deal about it since. Similarly, Romney being pro-life takes absolutely nothing. He just has to say it. That’s it.
It takes no strength to adopt a meaningless stance that does absolutely nothing for the American people because the status quo on social issues isn’t changing. You don’t see Romney red-faced on the stump, touting the injustices of abortion. The election is about the economy. And guess what? According to the Associated Press, 53.6 percent of college graduates can’t get good jobs.
Are we as young voters really naive enough to make any other issue more important then that one fact? If you can’t pay for an abortion or your same-sex wedding, it’s not going to happen whether it’s legal or not.
When we graduate from college, we’ll be entering either Romney’s economy or Obama’s. Four years of Obama’s economy has left half of our predecessors jobless or underemployed. For the sake of your own future, wake up and give the other guy a chance.

This year, the Career and Professional Development Center took a step in the right direction by sending out emails to Dietrich College students informing them of companies recruiting students majoring in the humanities.
The recruiters will be looking for talent at the Employment Opportunities Conference (EOC) on Thursday and the WestPACS job fair in Monroeville next Wednesday. However, these emails also reveal that the Career and Professional Development Center needs to do more to help students majoring in the liberal arts find jobs after college.
The vast majority of the 34 companies looking for Dietrich undergraduates at the EOC are only looking for economics, information systems, and “consulting” majors. And while there are plenty of opportunities for majors other than these at the WestPACS job fair, most students will be unable to make it to Monroeville for the Wednesday afternoon event in the middle of midterms.
Instead, the Career and Professional Development Center needs to take an active role in finding opportunities for Dietrich students. One way it can do this is by making space in the EOC for some of the companies at WestPACS recruiting for the humanities: Currently, none of the 22 companies at WestPACS that are recruiting writing, journalism, communications, or public relations majors will be present at the EOC. These companies include some big names such as UPMC, Panera Bread, and Prudential.
These companies have recruited at Carnegie Mellon in the past. The Career and Professional Development Center should have made more of an effort to have them at this year’s EOC, if only so that humanities majors don’t have to make the trek off campus while engineering and technical majors have companies brought to them.
Carnegie Mellon is not usually associated with the humanities and social sciences. Our past employment statistics and career fairs reflect this fact. However, by accepting William Dietrich’s gift last year and naming a college after him, the school made a commitment to the humanities and social sciences, a commitment to make Carnegie Mellon a leader in those areas with the $265 million gift from the late industrialist. 
The Career and Professional Development Center should honor this by striving to provide Dietrich majors with as many, if not more, opportunities for employment than those that students might find in Monroeville or anywhere else.

In what some consider a shocking turn of events, the media at large seems to have declared former Massachusetts Governor and current Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney the winner of last Wednesday’s presidential debate.
The debate itself was the first of three between Romney and President Barack Obama in these last weeks leading up to the November election. 
Obama, after his stunning performances in the 2008 debates and with his general charismatic demeanor, was predicted to win the debate. Yet Romney had already proven himself in battles of rhetoric, winning many of the debates in the Republican primaries earlier this year.
So how exactly did Romney win? After all, his body language suggested an odd mix of confusion and smugness every time the president spoke, and he continued to not reveal any part of the grand plan he’s been talking about this election cycle, other than the fact that he can assure us good things will be a part of it.
Much of the sentiment online was outrage at Romney’s apparent desire to “fire” Big Bird; that is, to cut the funding for PBS, which airs the beloved children’s education show Sesame Street. He claimed he had nothing against the giant yellow fowl, but already the meme has spread like wildfire and will no doubt continue to grow at least through November.
Romney also should have been weakened when Obama laid bare Romney’s idea for a Medicare voucher system before the audience. This alone should have scored Obama big points, but it wasn’t nearly as effective as it should have been because of his lack of aggression during the debate.
There are many reasons why Romney was declared the winner of this debate by the masses. It could be the case that the president had little time to prepare, being the leader of the free world and all. Romney threw out quite a few zingers and was therefore perceived to be sharper and more aggressive during the debate.
It could also be the case that moderator Jim Lehrer let Romney talk over him and wrestle control of the evening away. This point is debatable, though, as Lehrer was not forceful with either candidate, and the president appeared to talk over Lehrer quite often himself. 
Finally, and perhaps most unlikely, there is a rather conspiratorially minded conjecture making its rounds online that Obama was playing a little “rope-a-dope” with Romney, lulling him into a false sense of security by letting him win this round, but planning on coming out swinging next time. 
To me, this seems like a silly excuse. Why would Obama — by all accounts a usually confident, competitive guy — lose if he could help it? It seems more likely that he was caught off-guard this time rather than having some sort of Machiavellian game in store.
Regardless of the potential reasons the Democrats could give, the media has spoken.
Romney has won round one. But don’t count the president out just yet: He has a much better gauge on what he’s up against and he learns from his mistakes. He can be less abstract and more passionate when the situation calls for it, and it seems more likely now that he will go on a full offensive, pulling no punches while moving forward.
With round one behind us, the election seems closer than ever. It’s politics in action, and I, for one, could not be more excited. Let the best man win.

The Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania halted the implementation of a new voter ID law in the midst of a lawsuit.
Judge Robert Simpson ruled on Tuesday to block the new measure from coming into effect before the 2012 election, citing concerns about unfairly excluding legally eligible voters from casting their ballots in November.
The voter ID law, which would require voters to present state-issued photo IDs in order to cast their ballots, was accused of voter disenfranchisement for poor minorities and the elderly.
Halting this measure is an excellent move by Judge Simpson, challenging the implementation of harsh standards intended to address a problem that doesn’t exist. Evidence of voter fraud in Pennsylvania has been scant at best, with state officials stating in a stipulation in July that there have been “no investigations or prosecutions of in-person voter fraud in Pennsylvania.”
Contrast this with the estimated 1.36 million Pennsylvania residents that do not possess a valid photo ID, according to University of Washington associate professor Matt A. Barreto in an article on Philly.com, and the problem becomes evident. These individuals would be put through a time-consuming bureaucratic process if they wished to vote in the upcoming presidential election.
The groups most likely affected by voter ID laws are inner-city minorities and the elderly. These demographics may have difficulty producing a birth certificate for their identification or getting transportation to a DMV in order to have their identity verified. In addition, members of these groups may not have the means or know-how to complete the bureaucratic application process for a state ID.
While voter fraud is a serious issue, the implementation of a new, complex voter ID system despite little to no recorded cases of fraud seems unnecessarily punitive, especially with the presidential election next month.
Preventing voter fraud is a noble goal, but it doesn’t require the immediate attention of Pennsylvania legislators.
Should an improved voter ID system be put into place, it should be announced prior to, not during, an election year, and should have more helpful mechanisms for individuals who need their identification verified.

This summer, Sarah Attar became the first Saudi Arabian woman to participate in the Olympic games. The BBC reported that in 2015, Saudi Arabian women will be allowed to vote in municipal elections for the first time.
In a country where culture has dictated women’s dependency on men, this shows progress in the right direction. That’s why it’s unfortunate that one Swedish-based company has reminded us of Saudi Arabia’s misogynist past and pervading gender inequality.
In the Saudi Arabian version of the latest IKEA catalog, women have been completely airbrushed out of it. From a feminist perspective, it’s easy to bemoan the male-dominated culture that prevents women from appearing in furniture advertisements. In the 21st century, it is a shame that there is a country where women cannot travel or work without the permission of a male guardian.
But what role does IKEA play in this gender discussion? It is, after all, just trying to sell furniture. Whether IKEA is directly responsible for these changes is unknown. According to a report in the Los Angeles Times, IKEA has since issued the following statement, “We should have reacted to the exclusion of women from the Saudi Arabian version of the catalog since it does not align with the IKEA group values.”
On paper, this statement was politically correct, but in perspective, it was unnecessary. Major companies broadcast different advertisements in countries with different cultural norms. IKEA was correct in its intention to respect Saudi Arabian values, but unfortunately, it overplayed the cultural sensitivity card.
To photograph a woman in a compromising and risque position in Saudi Arabia is unacceptable. However, femininity isn’t so greatly suppressed that women cannot be presented in a respectful manner. For IKEA to assume the worst was a blatant offense to the steps being made toward gender equality. Women now work alongside men, and women will continue to find employment with increased educational opportunities.
In an age where information between people of conflicting ideologies can be easily shared, it will be impossible for Saudi Arabia to keep women tied down forever. These forces are already in action.
In the meantime, we must realize that the beliefs that have justified the oppression of women in the past will not change overnight. But, as the catalog demonstrated, to completely ignore the presence of women in domestic lives is not an act of respect, but an exaggeration of a cultural rigidity that is slowly beginning to crumble.

According to Philly.com, last month, the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology lent Turkey 24 artifacts from ancient Troy — indefinitely. This move by the museum was due to Turkey’s aggressive campaign to retrieve artifacts that originated in its region.
Both the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and the Pergamon Museum in Berlin have returned artifacts. Officials of the Pergamon claim they did so under the threat of Turkey blocking further archaeological projects.
Last year, Turkish officials told the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York that if certain artifacts were not returned, all exchange of artifacts from Turkey would stop. Museum officials from all over the world were not happy with this declaration.
Artifacts are a very important part of any nation’s cultural consciousness. It is understandable that Turkey wants them back. However, the country’s officials might want to go about retrieving these treasures a little more gently. While blackmail has its merits, it is not known for smoothing international relations.
The dilemma of deciding where an artifact should be displayed may seem inconsequential to Americans, or even to people who live in an area with a history of political and ethnic stability. Stability — ethnic or otherwise — has been in short supply for much of the Anatolian Peninsula’s history.
Turkey claims it only wants to recover looted objects — objects that should rightfully be in their countries of origin, as some officials say. As Murat Suslu, director-general of cultural heritage and museums in Turkey, told The New York Times last week, “If you come to my house and you steal precious objects from me, do I not have a right to get them back?”
But, as the president of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation Hermann Parzinger also pointed out to The New York Times, “[Turkey] should be careful about making moral claims when their museums are full of looted treasures.”
Parzinger is right to point out this discrepancy in Turkey’s policy. Many museums have stolen artifacts, because stealing the treasures of a conquered nation was the norm until after World War II. Artifacts were consequently scattered all over the world; archaeologists, historians, and museum officials have had enormous trouble determining where artifacts belong.
The question of where artifacts should reside is a murky one, which is why the international community has a myriad of different protocols on how to deal with artifacts, ancient and otherwise. But Turkey’s campaign has the potential to upset this delicate balance that museum officials have worked for decades to maintain.

Fellow Tartans, 
As Tuesday, Oct. 9, marks the final day for individuals to register to vote in the state of Pennsylvania, Will Weiner and I wanted to take a moment to thank the Carnegie Mellon community for its continued enthusiasm surrounding the election and to remind you of the importance of remaining politically informed and involved up until the Nov. 6 election date.
First and foremost, we have been so incredibly pleased by the amount of young people who registered to vote within the past few months. Representatives from Student Government as well as several other organizations from both the Carnegie Mellon community and the greater Pittsburgh area have worked incredibly hard to vocalize the importance of voting and urge members of our community to register. Together, we have collected boxes upon boxes of voter registrations, and we are proud of the student body’s efforts to get involved.
Secondly, Will and I were also delighted by the turnout at our screening of this past week’s U.S. Presidential Debate. 
A total of 378 individuals stopped by McConomy Auditorium to watch the debate. 
Being able to witness the reactions of the audience during the debate made for a truly interactive and entertaining night, and we enjoyed hearing the thoughts and reactions of those students who stayed afterwards to discuss the debate and reflect on each candidate’s performance.
While we have witnessed great enthusiasm surrounding this year’s elections so far, we want to make sure to maintain said enthusiasm up until Election Day.
Will and I would like to use this space to encourage members of our community to stay informed by keeping up with election news and continue efforts to stay politically active on campus — whether it be through an organization, events, or merely friendly conversations.
By Oct. 15, we will have information on cmu.edu/stugov detailing local candidates and issues to help you become more informed about key local issues.
Furthermore, we wanted to remind students that while we will be holding Debate Watching Parties for the remaining two presidential debates (information about these events will be postered around campus and announced through our Facebook page, www.facebook.com/cmusbp), there are many other informative election-related events occurring both in our area and on national broadcasts.
While we will not be showing the vice presidential or local debates, we strongly encourage you all to tune in or attend. If you have any questions regarding voting, ways to get involved on or off campus, or anything else, feel free to reach out to us either through office hours (which will be held on Tuesday, Oct. 9, from 4:30–5:30 p.m.) or by email at sbp@andrew.cmu.
Meela Dudley
Student Body Vice President
