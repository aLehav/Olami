After a week of matches against four different opponents, Carnegie Mellon’s volleyball team emerged victorious. 
The team started out on Tuesday with a five-game win over St. Vincent College, playing the matches in Bearcat territory in Latrobe, Pa. With a strong comeback, they were able to defeat the Bearcats in an intense fight for the victory title. The 3–2 victory evened the Tartans’ record to 5–5, and left the team confident to play in the following two matches on Friday and Saturday. 
With intense conditioning and a tough preseason under their belts, Carnegie Mellon was able to quickly spring back into shape after the summer. Also, having only four newcomers to the team, they established a strong team chemistry that helped them stay “friends on and off the court, so when they practice it’s like hanging out with friends,” said seniors Emily Baddock and Kristin Castellano. 
The Tartans opened up their quad tournament at home with a 3–0 win over Adrian College last Friday.
Sophomore Rachel Miller kept the team strong with 10 kills, with sophomore Senna Parsa totaling a close nine. Sophomore Emily Wright was also a key asset to the match, leading the team with 21 assists as well as eight digs. The match was an overall strong start to the women’s last day of the tournament. 
The Tartans’ tournament finished on Saturday, after they emerged with two wins. 
Carnegie Mellon started the day out with a match against John Carroll University. Although they lost the opening game 25–22, the Tartans came back and finished with three wins at 25–14, 25–17, and 25–21. Sophomore Rachel Miller led the offense with 17 kills and a .250 hitting percentage. Parsa was again a strong contributor, totaling 15 kills, and first-year Ali Celentano collected nine kills of her own.
The second match was against the Westminster College Titans, where the Tartans emerged victorious 3–2 after two initial losses. However, the last three games, ending with scores of 25–17, 25–21, and 15–11, gave Carnegie Mellon the win. Senior Maddie Rosnick was a key player at the net, collecting five block assists.
As a senior on the team, Rosnick’s goal is to help lead the team to the NCAA tournament this year. “I was lucky enough to experience the NCAA tournament as a freshman and would love to be able to have that experience again. The team has a lot of talent, and I believe we deserve a chance in that tournament,” Rosnik said. 
The Tartans will have their next match this coming weekend when they host an invitational on Friday and Saturday in the University Center. Their own matches will begin at 6 p.m. on Friday, as they will attempt to extend their wining streak.

Carnegie Mellon's cross country team traveled to Slippery Rock, Pa., for the Mack Cooper Invitational at Cooper’s Lake Campground Friday night. The men’s team took first place while the women’s team finished fourth, both out of six teams. The men won by just three points.
The men’s cross country team performed exceptionally, with five runners finishing in the top 10. Junior Evan Gates missed winning the race by a second, but still took home an impressive second place, with a time of 25:53.

The Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team is on a roll after its fourth straight victory this past Saturday. The Tartans have wins over Rochester Institute of Technology (2–1), York College of Pennsylvania (3–1), Frostburg State (1–0), and John Carroll University (3–0). This brings the team record to 4–2 overall.
The Tartans have seen excellent performances from the entire team. On the defensive end, sophomore goalie Anna Albi had her second shutout of the season on Saturday.  Credit that needs to be shared with strong defensive performances from senior Kristen Suzich in the game against RIT; Suzich blocked a rebound shot to keep the game tied at 1–1. Sophomore defender Brittany Couture has not only been a strong defender for the Tartans but also assisted junior Brianna Magill’s goal in the game against York College of Pennsylvania.
Offensively, senior Elsa Wu has been playing aggressively and taking advantage of her shots on goal, and currently has had three goals this season. Sophomore Alex Venegas is right behind Wu with two goals so far this season, both game-winning, including the only goal against Frostburg State University. Sophomore Rachel Contopoulos has also had two goals so far this season. Magill has one goal so far this season, but is leading the team with two assists. Additionally, first-year Savina Reid has been making plays behind the scenes for the Tartans, like assisting the only goal at Frostburg State and assisting the final goal against York College of Pennsylvania.
“We have been playing really tough these past few games, and we hope to keep it up for the rest of the season,” said junior midfielder Stephanie Hare.
The Tartans will be at home this Wednesday, where they will be hosting Allegheny College at 7 p.m.

After a rough weekend on the road, the Tartans brushed the dirt off their shoulders and won their game at home against the Westminster College Titans 3–0.
The Tartans began playing aggressively from the start of the game. Only nine minutes had passed before senior Carmen Minella scored for the Tartans.
With the lead, the Tartans continued to move the ball forward, and the action was focused mostly at the Titans’ end of the field. With ample pressure on the Titans and lots of opportunities for Carnegie Mellon, the Tartans managed to score again, but this time it was junior John Crawshaw. Crawshaw kicked the ball over the Titan goalie’s head and into the upper left corner of the net.
As Carnegie Mellon continued to play an error-free game, the Tartans had more chances to score but were not able to get the ball past the goalie. The Tartans closed the half still up 2–0.
The Tartans kept the ball at the Titans’ end but were unable to convert until the end of the second half, when junior Alex Abedian scored from 18 yards away. Abedian’s goal brought the Tartans to a solid 3–0 victory over the Titans.
On Saturday, the Tartans travelled to Allegheny College and took on the Gators. 
The Tartans lost a heartbreaker as the time ran out, leaving the Tartans down one goal with a final score of 3–2. Carnegie Mellon took control of the first half with lots of scoring opportunities, but none of them were converted into goals.
Tartan goalie junior Zach Stahl has been performing well all season and held the Gators off the entire first half.
The action started to heat up in the second half. Abedian scored his second goal of the season and the week, putting the Tartans up 1–0. However, the Gators took advantage of a corner kick and tied the game 1–1. Allegheny College broke through the Tartan defense again within minutes to score another goal and to take the lead in the game 2–1. Carnegie Mellon tried to pull it together and tie the game, but the Gators gained control of the ball and scored again, increasing their lead to 3–1.
Senior Carmen Minella scored late in the second half, leaving the Tartans trailing by only one goal, but there was not enough time left  in the game.
“We are looking forward to working out the rough patches this week so we can continue to improve our play and our record in our upcoming games,” said senior Ian Epperson.
The Tartans will take on the Washington and Jefferson College Presidents this Wednesday in Washington, Pa., at 7 p.m.

The Tartans’ football trip to Washington, D.C., ended unfavorably. After a heartbreaking loss against the Catholic University Cardinals, the Tartans find themselves  1–2 early in the 2011 season.
During the first offensive sequence of the game, senior defensive lineman Andrew Medenbach recovered a fumble on the Cardinals’ 19-yard line. Two plays later, junior running back Patrick Blanks found the end zone to give the Tartans an early 7–0 lead.
The Cardinals came back to score two consecutive field goals, a 21-yarder and a 26-yarder.
On the following kickoff, the Cardinals recovered a Carnegie Mellon fumble on the Tartans’ 42-yard line. Three plays later, the Cardinals went to the air and scored, bringing the game to 13–7.
Junior running back Jake Nardone made his mark on the game at the end of the first half as he scored two touchdowns to reclaim the lead. The first touchdown came on a 17-yard run, and the second on a 4-yard draw up the middle. The Tartans led 21–13 at the half.
The Tartans’ defense struck next, as junior cornerback Sam Thompson intercepted a pass from the Cardinals and returned it 71 yards to put the Tartans up 28–13.
After that, the Tartans did not score again.
The Cardinals began to cut into the 15-point lead with a 33-yard field goal. Then, on their first possession of the fourth quarter, the Cardinals found the end zone to make the score 28–23.
With 2:41 left to play and the Cardinals with the ball on the Tartans’ 6-yard line, Catholic University fought for another touchdown. After a failed two-point conversion, the Tartans were down by one with a score of 28–29.
With 13 seconds left in the game, first-year place kicker Kevin Donohue missed a 28-yard field goal that would have won the game for the Tartans. It was a tough loss for Carnegie Mellon.
In a post-game interview, junior outside linebacker Vincent Brown had encouraging words for his fellow Tartans. “It was a great all-around team effort. Despite the loss we still feel good about the season.”
Nardone ended the game with 83 rushing yards and two touchdowns. Senior running back Chris Garcia added 74 yards on the ground. Senior linebacker Dan Behmke had a career-high 10 tackles to lead the team. Junior linebacker Philip Nicolaides also had a career high of eight tackles.
The Tartans will head to Kenyon College this Saturday for a game against the Lords. Kickoff is at noon. The Tartans will look have better fourth quarter play than in the Catholic University game and try to regain a .500 record.

Just a few weeks into the women’s fall tennis season The Tartan had the opportunity to catch up with sophomore transfer student Katie Cecil. Cecil completed her first year at Tulane University were she played Division I tennis.
Katie Cecil is currently majoring in biology with a neuroscience track. She plans on going to medical school and aspires to be a neurologist or brain surgeon. 
Although she is new to the Carnegie Mellon team, Cecil’s favorite part about college tennis is working hard while still having fun with her teammates. “I love to compete and I love to win, but I also love the team atmosphere. It makes tennis so much more fun,” Cecil said.
Cecil is adjusting from Division I to Division III tennis; she finds that there are a lot of good players in Division III tennis, but the amount of time Cecil trains on the court is significantly less.
“Academics definitely come first here. Everyone is playing tennis because they actually enjoy it, as opposed to Division I where tennis is like a job. We work hard because we want to, not because we’re forced to,” Cecil said.
“I really like how laid back Division III is. We don’t get extra sprints for being 30 seconds late, and we don’t get penalized for missing practice because we have a project or a class or we’re just plain tired. But at the same time, athletes at Division I schools get little perks that I definitely miss, like priority registration, their own academic adviser, free clothes, shoes, and stringing, and other little things that you don’t really appreciate until you no longer have them.” 
She continued elaborating on her preference of Division III, but added, “Occasionally I also miss the do-or-die intensity of Division I and screaming at the top of my lungs for my teammates while we practice for three or four hours every day. And I must say I miss eating whatever I want after those long and brutal practices,” Cecil continued.
Cecil is setting her goals early this season. After taking a few months off during the summer, she wants to be ready to play in the fall ITA regionals this coming weekend. “Hopefully I can get some solid matches under my belt and get used to the mental toughness needed in pressure situations,” she said. 
When asked about spring season, Cecil already had goals in mind.
“I hope that, as a team with so much talent, we can make a huge impact in our region as well as NCAAs. With the returning starters as well as a really good batch of freshmen, we’ll be rock solid at every single position in the lineup. We’ll definitely have to work hard, but if we put in the time and effort on the court, in the weight room, and on the bleachers and track, then there should be no reason CMU won’t be in the run for the national championship,” Cecil said.

All it took was a couple of plays, and Tony Romo went from Monday Night Football hero to Monday Night Football dud. With the Cowboys up by two scores on the New York Jets in a game meant as a tribute to the infamous Sept. 11 attacks, Romo gave the city of New York a reason to celebrate, losing a fumble at the 1-yard line and throwing an interception with less than a minute to play to set up a game-winning field goal against the Jets. As soon as Romo gave the game away, critics from all over the country voiced their opinions of the Dallas star quarterback on Twitter. As if Romo needed more criticism and exposure, he became a trending topic on Twitter, with almost all the tweets talking about how bad he was in the clutch. What a cruel environment the internet can be.
In my opinion, Romo gets way too much criticism for a quarterback that can arguably be considered top-10 in the league. In a full season at the helm just two years ago, Romo threw for over a 63 percent completion percentage and almost 4,500 yards. 
Let’s put that in perspective. Ben Roethlisberger, considered to be a top 10 and potentially top five quarterback, has never reached that amount of yardage, while also compiling a lower overall quarterback rating than Romo over their careers. Yes, Roethlisberger has two Super Bowls under his belt, but one of them was mostly because of the exceptional Steelers defense. 
Another quarterback ranked in the top 10 is Matt Ryan of the Atlanta Falcons, who in three years of play has not come close to the statistical stature of Romo, and also has never won a playoff game in his career. Not to mention all three of these quarterbacks lost their respective games in week one, with Romo having the best statistical day of them all. All three of them played playoff-caliber teams, and only one of them even had their team within striking distance at the end of the game. That quarterback was Romo. Roethlisberger had a whopping five turnovers, and Ryan had a couple that led to defensive touchdowns. So why does Romo get labeled as the choke artist while the other two basically stay out of the critics’ way?  
What is happening here is just a general hatred for “America’s Team,” the Cowboys. Playing under owner Jerry Jones, who is not well-liked among opposing fan bases, along with being the star quarterback on one of the NFL’s most storied franchises, makes Romo an easy target for those who love to hide behind a Twitter account or a forum screen name. They don’t want to see the Cowboys succeed, so they bash Romo and label him a choker, hoping that so many people will follow suit and get in Romo’s head. Up until now, it looks like these internet trolls have succeeded. Since that infamous botched hold on an easy game-winning field goal against the Seahawks in a 2007 playoff game followed by a dejected post-game interview, people have seen Romo as someone they could bring down with them as their teams also fail to win a Super Bowl. This is the world we live in today, and it’s sad to see a player of Romo’s caliber being so affected by the media.  
 Looking back at the week-one game, I’ll agree that Romo’s mistakes were awful and cost his team the game. However, the other three quarters were as good as any quarterback could play against one of the league’s top secondaries, and any fan can attest to that. Also, why doesn’t anyone look at the blocked punt that directly led to the New York Jets tying the score at 24? Or how about when star wide receiver Dez Bryant found out that his conditioning wasn’t up to par as he began to cramp up at the beginning of the third quarter? This was a team effort in the loss, not just Romo’s fault. I agree that the quarterback takes the most responsibility for a team loss, as he is the most important person on the field, and Romo needs to do better in the fourth quarter. Romo understands this and hears the critics. Now it is up to him to silence them, and I predict he’ll do an excellent job of that this season.

Recent reports regarding the National Basketball Association’s lockout are bleak. NBA fans, don’t count on the 2011–12 season to start on time. According to the National Basketball Players’ Association (NBPA) Executive Director Billy Hunter, we should expect to miss at least half of the upcoming season.
We all thought that the two sides, the NBPA and the NBA owners, being so far apart in their negotiations was what has been making the process of agreeing on a new collective bargaining agreement so painfully slow. NBPA President and Los Angeles Lakers point guard Derek Fisher reported on Thursday that there is a division among the owners, who have different viewpoints on key issues.
The two biggest issues fueling the NBA lockout are the implementation of a hard salary cap and a better revenue sharing program. The NBPA is for a soft salary cap, but the owners are for a hard salary cap to try to limit the amount of revenue being spent on players’ salaries. The revenue-sharing program is a less controversial issue, since both sides agree it needs to be improved.
In the meeting between the NBPA and the owners on Thursday, the NBPA presented the owners with a rough proposal for a new agreement. The owners then dispersed to meet by themselves and discuss the presented policies. Although NBA Commissioner David Stern vigorously denies the claims, Fisher reported that there was a “fundamental divide between the owners internally.”
It makes sense — owners of large-market teams and small-market teams will have very different opinions regarding these fiscal policies that are about to see considerable alterations.
When the owners left to privately discuss, the Cleveland Cavaliers’ owner Dan Gilbert and the Phoenix Suns’ owner Robert Sarver apparently expressed discontent with many points in the players’ proposal. Subsequently, reports say Los Angeles Lakers owner Jerry Buss and New York Knicks owner James Dolan exhibited visible annoyance.
The opposing sides having disputes is one problem, but the owners not being decisive on what they collectively want is a bad omen.
As a die-hard fan of NBA basketball, I don’t know whether to be disheartened at potentially losing part or all of the season and not having any games to watch in the winter, or thankful that my grades will improve without me prioritizing NBA basketball ahead of school work.
But for this lockout to end soon enough to at least have a majority of the 2011–12 season, the owners need to do two things: work out the differences among themselves so that they can agree on policies that will benefit all 30 NBA owners, and make some concessions to the players.
I am on the players’ side at the moment, but it is not that I believe the owners are 100 percent to blame for the lockout. However, I do believe that the lockout is moving at such a negligible pace because of the owners’ close-mindedness.
Since their NBA teams are truly a side project to whatever company made them millionaires to begin with, they can afford pressuring the players with this lockout to get what they want. But the ball is in the owners’ court; they have the ability to end this lockout now.
The players have presented various options to modify the salary cap to make it more profitable for the NBA teams. Unfortunately, the owners are stalwart in their desire for a hard salary cap.
There are definitely some ways the owners can concede something to the players without giving up too much. A hard salary cap implies no luxury tax. If the owners concede to significantly increasing the luxury tax, it can help to even up the competition among big-market teams and small-market teams in the league and also appease the players because they can be more certain that their salaries won’t see as significant cuts in the future.
Whatever needs to be done to end this lockout has to be worked out. Both sides want the same thing, because no season means the owners incur no revenue and the players earn no salary. But let’s try to make some progress.
I’m dreading notion of losing the 2011–12 NBA season. The owners need to be more open-minded so that we can at least salvage part of the season.

    When going to the EOC, BOC, or TOC, it is important to have a strong résumé to make you stand out from all the other candidates — in a good way, of course. 

  

    When it comes to making a good first impression, appearance definitely matters. 

  

    As the TOC, BOC, and EOC conferences wrap up, many students may be left with unmet expectations. Students still have a wide variety of options available to them.

  

    Hundreds of fellow Tartans will be working the upcoming fair as they look to distinguish themselves from other attendees and land a job.

  

    For the first time this year an Employment Opportunities Conference (EOC) has been added to the fall career fair line up.

When going to the EOC, BOC, or TOC, it is important to have a strong résumé to make you stand out from all the other candidates — in a good way, of course. Here are some short, informal guidelines for those who have never written a résumé before.
In the heading, the name comes first, and you want that to be the most prominent part. Make it noticeable, under 40 point font, and either left-align or center-align it. A nice, bold name in a formal serif (Garamond, Jenson, Trajan) will suffice. The address at which the writer receives most of his or her mail, as well as a phone number and email address, should also be in the heading. If you have a personal website, list it there as well.
The education section is where to put intended majors or minors (if relevant), expected graduation date, and the name and location of one’s school. Once in college, the writer should try to avoid placing his or her high school on their résumé. You can include your GPA if it is high given your current major — especially if you are a Dean’s List honoree. If your GPA is poor, leave it off — if they really want to know, they will ask.
Here is the trickiest and most important part of your résumé. When listing your experiences, you should choose the ones that connect your skills to the qualifications that the job asks for. However, don’t copy full-length sentences word-for-word from the job advertisement. 
What you should do is try to articulate your skills in a way that sounds similar to the skills the employer is looking for in a candidate. Eliminate use of first-person (“I did ...”) if possible, and don’t forget to use active verbs when listing the tasks your job entailed. For example, “Flipped burgers” (Don’t put that on your résumé) is the correct form of verb to use. You should also try to use bulleted lists to make it easier to scan the information. And stay concise — no one wants to read eight paragraphs about your retail experience.
In some cases, your activities might even be more relevant than your actual work experience, and should thus be as boldly and centrally placed. You should try your best to list your most relevant activities. For example, if you are applying for a web design internship, list related activities: copy writing, search engine optimization, or visual design experience. 
In terms of activities which are not related to the position, it is important to highlight activities you can actually speak about, not clubs where you attended a single meeting. As always, either cut out the irrelevant information, or find a way to tie it into the way you sell yourself.
This is where you advertise any skills that haven’t been addressed in the other sections. Be sure you are actually advertising real skills, not generic qualities that anyone can claim. List languages you speak and languages you code. List a hobby or two that may be something an interviewer can connect with and better understand you as a person.
Take your résumé seriously, and have someone like an adviser look over it for you because their advice will be tremendously valuable. If you don’t, you could make really silly mistakes, and your résumé will be a joke. It will provide the employer with a good laugh. They might even frame it in their office so when they’re having a bad day, they can look at it and chuckle; but that is probably not what you are aiming for. Try to be professional, or at least try not to do something foolish.

When it comes to making a good first impression, appearance definitely matters. Carnegie Mellon students have a reputation of not caring too much about (supposedly) trivial things like attire. But at job fairs, recruiters are judging students not only by their resumes but also the color of their suits.
With this in mind, it is imperative that students make their best effort to look polished and conservative. Finding the right pair of heels or the perfect tie is just as important as fixing the formatting on your resume.
Since the dress code for the conferences is business formal, women should stick to a conservative suit or skirt in black, navy, or gray. Wearing a suit jacket is a must, or you will end up looking too casual for the event. Also, try to avoid wearing lacy or silky camisoles under your jacket. A crisp shirt in a solid color is a much better option — not only is it a safe, conservative bet, but it also looks smart.
When it comes to styling, all attempts should be made to create a clean and polished look. Hair should be tied back neatly in a pony tail or pinned back so that it doesn’t fall on the face. Nude pantyhose are a must if you are wearing a skirt suit, and even if you are wearing a pant suit, wear thin, nude socks.
When it comes to accessories, the choice of shoes is an important one. Don’t pick the stylish, open-toed heels you would wear to a night out. Instead, go with a sensible pair of pumps. A quick tip: Make sure you are comfortable in your heels. Job fairs involve a lot of standing and waiting in lines, and you don’t want to be doing all of it with sore feet. Add some simple jewelry to make your look more elegant and attractive. Stay away from large, chunky necklaces and long, dangly earrings. Find simple studs and a small pendant that suit your outfit and you’re good to go.
A business suit is also a necessity for men. While colors like black, navy, and gray will all work, men can also impress in a pinstriped suit. A white shirt is the safest bet, and it is important to make sure the shirt cuffs are close to one-half of an inch longer than their jacket sleeves.
A special feature of the men’s look is the tie. Remember: The tie is supposed to serve as an accessory, not an attention-grabber; leave your Homer Simpson tie at home and wear something more suited to the occasion. Additionally, if this is your first time tying a tie, practice a few times before the day of the conference. YouTube has some good video tutorials that can prove to be useful. Make sure your tie is not too long and hanging below your belt, or too short and stopping above it.
An important thing to keep in mind is that even though you may have put the perfect outfit together, all of it will amount to nothing if you are not confident about your appearance. While adhering to the dress code and smartening up your attire are essential, remaining cool and confident about yourself is even more important.

As the TOC, BOC, and EOC conferences wrap up, many students may be left with unmet expectations. 
Whether looking for an internship or a full-time job, students still have a wide variety of options available to them.
While the conferences offer an excellent opportunity to meet with potential employers in person, students have a much larger pool of employers available to them all year round through TartanTrak, which offers over 11,000 company profiles.
These 11,000 businesses currently offer around 1,300 positions for which Carnegie Mellon students can apply via the university’s online service.
The fairs “are wonderful opportunities for students to network with employers and to secure that first interview. But it is not the only way,” said Farouk Dey, the director of Carnegie Mellon’s Career and Professional Development Center (CPDC) in an interview last semester.
“There are many employers who are out there who choose not to come to the conference for one reason or another but are still very interested in Carnegie Mellon students. The first place I would always send students to is TartanTrak,” Dey said.
“I want to encourage every student, whether they get an interview or not, to go on TartanTrak and look up these employers.” Students can visit TartanTrak to submit résumés, sign up for interviews, and find contact information for thousands of recruiters. Students can register for their TartanTrak login information at www.studentaffairs.cmu.edu/career/students_alumni/tartantrak.html.
According to Dey, the majority of university students across the country find their jobs through previously established connections.
“Networking is really the No. 1 way people get jobs,” Dey said. “Occasionally these connections can be neighbors or family friends, but most of the time these are professional connections that students have developed through joining clubs, organizations, or committees.”
Dey said that students must first be aware of the contacts they have available to them and then leverage these connections. Many, however, wonder how to exactly begin taking advantage of their networks. According to Dey, it is often just a matter of getting the word out.
“The first place to start is to let people know that you’re looking — let your parents know, let your friends know, let your roommate know. Inform people that you are approaching graduation and are beginning to look for a full-time position,” Dey said. “Just the fact that you’re letting them know and asking them to keep you in mind if they hear about an opportunity increases your chances of being in the right place at the right time.”
The advantages of online networking are often not succesfully leveraged by students. The internet, along with tools such as Facebook and LinkedIn, give students the option to reach hundreds, if not thousands, of their friends and acquaintances with one click of a mouse.
“One of the tools I often recommend is LinkedIn. It is fantastic because it not only allows you to document all the people in your professional network who you know, but it also allows you to tap into a larger network through those people,” Dey said.
As an example, Dey opened his own LinkedIn profile to show the power of the site. “This is my LinkedIn page and I use it very much. You can see I have 331 connections — these are people that I know personally through my career or some are also friends or acquaintances. Through these 331 connections I am then connected to 3,316,810 people,” Dey said.
Dey explained the power of such online networking services by giving a hypothetical example. “If I am interested in working for Intel, I can type ‘Intel’ into the LinkedIn search. The first people that show up in my list are the people who are connected to me but also have a strong connection to Intel. They may know someone else who works there, or have worked there themselves. The great part about this is I now know who to contact to begin my search. It is a powerful way to look for connections.”
For those students who may leave the conferences feeling let down, a combination of examining TartanTrak, contacting professional networks, and expanding their online presence may be the key to finding the job they desire. According to Dey, if the fairs do not pan out as students may have hoped, persistence will pay off. Dey believes that it is important to not give up.
“Even the employers who you may have met at the [BOC/TOC/EOC] who maybe did not offer you an interview at the conference — it is okay to return to them and ask them to reconsider or if they have any other opportunities,” Dey said. 
“It really is a matter of engaging your professional associations, networking both online and in person, getting involved, and I would finish by telling students to not lose hope. Be persistent.”

Hundreds of fellow Tartans will be working the upcoming fair as they look to distinguish themselves from other attendees and land a job. Kevin Collins, career consultant for the School of Computer Science and assistant director of the Career and Professional Development Center, and Chris Maloney, senior manager at Cisco and Carnegie Mellon alumnus, shared their insights on how to make the best of a career fair.
The biggest faux pas at a fair is talking about money. Collins stressed that asking about salaries and payment is “the worst thing a student could do.” 
Such questions should be asked further into the applications process, never up front. Something else to avoid is not knowing anything about the company a recruiter is representing. Not doing one’s homework beforehand puts one at a huge disadvantage and often annoys the recruiter.
Maloney also stressed the importance of doing prior research on the company and how it functions. “Understand the company as a whole ... rather than focusing on specific things like press releases,” Maloney said. He added that simply reading the latest press release from the company was not sufficient. In many cases, the recruiters may not know what is going on in another branch of the company and may not even know about the press release.
If the students do not have enough knowledge of what the recruiters have to offer, the students appear unprepared or ill-suited for the job. This may cause recruiters to look to more informed students. 
A fair number of people are guilty of going to different booths just for the free stuff or “the swag,” as Collins put it. Google may have cool pens, but unless you are interested in a position at the company, it is best to avoid wasting not only your time (and the recruiter’s), but also avoid wasting time for those who are genuinely interested in working for the company.
One of the best ways to interact with a recruiter is to think like one, or rather, understand their mission at a job fair. 
Collins explained that job fairs serve as a way for companies to get a “quick assessment of candidates” and build upon their applicant pools. 
Collins also stated that job fairs “serve as a way for students to get on the company’s radar and for recruiters to remember them,” building a connection that aids in the application process. As Collins explained, the students recruiters are bound to notice and remember are “those who have a really good sense of what they can offer a company and know what sets them apart from others.”
However, Maloney said that one of the worst ways to be noticed is to crowd around the booth while another student is talking to the recruiters. 
He said that most recruiters want to spend individual time with every single student. If other students are continuously pushing their way forward, it shows that the students “don’t really respect [their] fellow students ... and that’s going to decrease [their] chances.”
“What you really have to be able to do is distinguish yourself and explain what makes you different from the other students,” Maloney said. “[You may stand out because of] your extracurricular activities, something innovative that you did as part of one of the projects, a patent that you had gone ahead and filed — those are all things that CMU students have come up and told me over the past five years.”
One way in which students can hone in on what they are good at and make recruiters notice them is by practicing and perfecting the art of a quick pitch, also known as an “elevator” or “30-second commercial” pitch. The Job Fair Success Guide located in the Career Center provides detailed examples and a checklist that can be used to perfect your pitch and get across who you are in the shortest time possible. An online version of the Job Fair Success Guide also exists on the website of the Career Center.
The guide suggests, among other things, that an elevator pitch should make connections to the student’s résumé, reflect a familiarity with the company, and sound normal rather than forced (practice is suggested, of course). “It is all about selling yourself and knowing what works best for you,” Collins said.
Maloney described some of his most memorable encounters with students who were hired in previous years. In one such case, a student came up to Maloney and explained why working with Cisco was her dream job. She then went on to describe how the work she was doing in college was relevant to the kind of work Cisco was doing. Maloney explained that the student’s knowledge of the company and her enthusiasm were two key factors that helped her get the job.
The last thing to keep in mind is the condition of the job market right now. When asked about the number of students expected to attend Career Week, Collins stated that he felt more students would be attending the fair this time. As Collins stated, students “are conscious of the need for experience.” He added that “all people are being more proactive [about employment] at all job fairs, not just the [EOC/]TOC/BOC.”
Such realities mean that one should not be discouraged if attending the job fair does not result in employment. By speaking with career counselors like Collins, students can uncover many different opportunities available beyond those present at the fairs.
Also, one should remember that each of the fairs has a different audience and appeals to different skill sets. 
Although Cisco does look for applicants with basic programming skills, Maloney mentioned that the company has recruited a number of non-traditional applicants as well. In the past, Cisco has recruited students ranging from first-years to graduates, as well as students who are not enrolled in traditional technical programs, such as biology majors. 
Maloney explained that technical skills are important, factors such as the enthusiasm and motivation of the applicants are even more important.
“They’ve got to be people that are self-motivated ... and really put forth the effort and try to go the extra step to make a difference,” Maloney said.

For the first time this year an Employment Opportunities Conference (EOC) has been added to the fall career fair line up. Scheduled for Monday, the EOC kicks off four days of career fairs and aims to find employment opportunities for a broader range of students. According to Wahab Owolabi, assistant director of the Career and Professional Development Center (CPDC) and career consultant, the EOC was advertised to companies as a way to meet “students who are from eclectic backgrounds, technical majors, non-technical majors, just a potpourri of different disciplines — that is what [these companies] are expecting.”
The CPDC decided to open a fall EOC because they saw a need that was not being met by the annual career fairs already being offered. Renée Starek, CPDC assistant director and career consultant, said “The TOC and the BOC have always done a really great job with serving the technical students and the business students, but it really left a lot of populations underserved.”
Based on The Tartan’s own analysis of the companies attending this year’s EOC, of the 79 companies attending 40 did not attend the EOC last spring, nor this week’s BOC/TOC. About half of the companies present would not have had access to CMU students without this new fall EOC.
While the other job fairs might not be as expansive as the EOC, Owolabi wanted to be clear that he “wouldn’t discourage students who aren’t in a technical field from going to the TOC,” and would instead encourage students to pursue relationships with companies they are interested in, even if they are only at the TOC. However, four days of career fairs can be overwhelming for students. Although it is “definitely a jam-packed week, it can get hectic ... it is not something you have to spend a whole day doing. You can work it around your schedule,” Owolabi said.
According to Starek, the reason the career fairs are all so early in the year is in fact determined by the employers. “For these job fairs [that are] happening so early, these companies want to obtain the best and brightest talent early.” Yet piling four days of career fairs into a single week could be a strong concern for some students. Samantha Skinger, the Society of Women Engineers’ (SWE) current High School Day co-chair and three-year member of its executive board, said “most students can’t take three days.”
This is why, even when the TOC filled all its slots, the organizers decided not to expand to a third day. SWE has run the TOC at Carnegie Mellon for four decades, and some members are concerned about the effects the new fall EOC will have on the TOC. “It was meant to fill a gap the TOC was leaving,” Skinger said, “but from what we are seeing right now ... there are some companies we haven’t traditionally seen at the TOC, but there are some big names that are going to the EOC.” There are 15 companies attending both this week’s EOC and TOC, and nine attending both the BOC and EOC.
Owolabi also pointed out the atypicality of Carnegie Mellon’s career fair model. “It is interesting, not a lot of schools have this model,” Owalabi said, “where we have student organizations running career fairs, and the students do an awesome job.” However, the CPDC maintains direct contact with companies. All postings go through TartanTrak, and the CPDC handles space for interviews and assists the student groups when they need more contacts. For now, the relationship between the student groups and the CPDC remains strong, sharing resources and contacts to support the students without competing for corporate attention.
The TOC filled all its booths again this year, but some SWE members are concerned about what the EOC could mean for the future of the TOC. The EOC charges less for booths, and — with its more general mission — may end up shifting some companies who traditionally attend the TOC to the EOC. Skinger was also concerned that the CPDC may expand the fall EOC, causing “companies to trickle from the TOC into the EOC.” Starek called this a trial year, and said plans for next year have not yet been made.
For student input into the number of days of fairs, the scheduling of fairs in the semester, and other general feedback, the CPDC suggests students go on TartanTrak and review their own job fair experiences on their online surveys.

“Can I buy this like right now???? It’s awesome!!!!”
“You need to ... make this a real product that people can buy in stores.”
“How can I buy it since I live in Brazil?”
When then-sophomore design majors Jonathan Ota and Ethan Frier uploaded a video of Project Aura, a prototype bicycle-lighting system, to their Vimeo page last May, they did not expect the outpouring of enthusiasm that they would receive. Nor did the two expect 20,000 views by May 17, seven days after the upload, or the countless requests from people all over the world hungry to buy their product. (The quotes above are sample comments left on their blog.) Ota and Frier were satisfied with simply finishing their prototype, which was the focus of a small grant they received from the Undergraduate Research Office.
Since then, their work has won an award for transportation design, the video of the prototype has received almost 200,000 views, and the two students have been trying to figure out how to respond to the enthusiasm for their work.
Project Aura is one of a small number of bicycle-lighting systems that focuses on illuminating cyclists from the side. It is the exception rather than the rule to find such lighting in a local bike shop. 
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, there were 625 cyclist fatalities in 2009 in the U.S., 33.2 percent of which occurred at intersections. 
Even though the fraction of time spent riding through intersections is small relative to the total time of a typical bike ride, the danger of riding through intersections is high, making visibility of cyclists from all angles essential.
The system works in tandem with standard front and rear blinking lights, which do little for side visibility. It relies on six LED lights attached to the rims of both the front and back wheel. The LEDs project light onto the rim, which illuminates a large, highly visible surface area. When the wheels spin, two bright circles of light are created that are visible from a wide range of angles allowing vehicles to see and respond. The lights receive their power from internal dynamos in the hubs of the wheels, which eliminate the need for batteries, or even remembering to flip an “on” switch.
According to Ota, working on bike lights was born out of necessity. “My roommates and I just started living off campus last year and relied on biking to commute to and from school ... [and] we had never biked daily (and nightly) on Pittsburgh streets before. It’s a lot to take as a young rider,” he said. By making their lights fully automated, not to mention eye-catching, they focused on drawing novice cyclists toward bike safety in a low-effort way.
“We began to notice lapses in safety and lack of awareness about how to be safe that were pretty striking,” Ota noted. As product designers, their research brought them to lighting as a unique aspect of bike safety that combines personal behavior, a physical product, and a highly visual output. “Ethan and I looked at how to make cyclists safer, how to make young cyclists want to be safe, and how to encourage more people to start biking.”
The duo is continuing work on Project Aura this fall during a study abroad in Eindhoven, Netherlands. Simultaneously, they are updating the concept of their prototype, investigating various methods of production, and figuring out how to bring their product to market. Going this far beyond the design prototyping process is something design students are not challenged with routinely. Ota added, “It’s not something you really encounter everyday while in school.... This definitely pushes our learning to a much higher level.”
Carnegie Mellon is facilitating their transition from designers to businessmen and marketers. They are getting help filing a patent from the Technology Transfer Office, and receiving advice from Project Olympus, a start-up facilitator, according to an recent interview on the CMU home page. 
When Ota and Frier get back from Holland, they plan to hit the ground running with the next phases of this project. “We’re looking to put together a team of other students (who want) to be a part of the development of Aura,” Ota said.

Cells inside our body come in a wide variety of sizes, ranging from billionths of meters to meters in length. Since cells need to transport molecules in different parts of the cell to survive, it is essential for molecules to be mobile within the cell. This is particularly important in neurons, some of the longest cells in the body, which can span a meter or more. A group at Carnegie Mellon headed by David Hackney, professor of biological sciences in the Mellon College of Science, has recently uncovered some insight behind one of the main molecular motor proteins that aids in molecular transport within the cell.
“Molecular motor proteins play a major role in all eukaryotic cells, but they are particularly critical to nerve cells,” Hackney stated in a press release. “Nerve cells have this special problem where proteins, such as receptors for neurotransmitters, get synthesized in the cell body and have to be shipped all the way down the [length of the neuron]. Problems in this transport system may play a role in a number of neurological conditions.”
Hackney said that these motor proteins “are found in almost all eukaryotic cells: anything with a nucleus.” This means that transporter proteins are something absolutely essential for any cell to function or the organism does not survive. Threrefore, understanding the structure of Kinesin-1, one of the main molecular motor proteins, and its biochemistry may be a stepping stone in the modification of these proteins for the benefit of human health.
Kinesin-1 works by transporting molecules across the cell’s microtubules, which are long molecules that span the length of cells and give cells their support and structure. Kinesin-1 carries cargo around the cell by binding to the microtubules and essentially walking across the cell.
However, keeping cell proteins fully functional all the time would be a waste of energy as well as space inside the cell. Therefore, cells regulate the proteins in different ways in order to conserve energy. Kinesin-1 is normally kept “turned off” by the cells. This means that the protein is wrapped in such a way that it stops moving and ceases transporting molecules across the cell. When a cell needs the protein, it triggers the turning “on” of the protein by having it unwrap from its folded form. 
This wrapping and unwrapping is important in terms of cellular function — too many activated Kinesin-1 proteins will cause molecules being created to continuously be transported, thereby creating an imbalance of molecules in different parts of the cell. Because of this, the cell keeps the proteins in a wrapped “off” position where they cannot move until it actually needs them. Currently, researchers are interested in the biomolecular processes behind this wrapping — what exactly is going on when the protein is in this “off” position?
Hackney’s associates, Hung Yi Kristal Kaan and Frank Kozielski at the Beatson Institute for Cancer Research in Glasgow, Scotland, used a technique known as protein crystallization to view the Kinesin-1 protein, which contains two heads and two tails, confirming that one of the protein’s tails was bound to the protein’s two heads when the protein was not needed for molecular transportation within the cell (when it was in the “off” position). Using that information, Hackney’s group began proposing theories on exactly how the binding was occurring such that the entire protein was inhibited.
According to the group’s study, which was recently published in Science, the two motor domains in the heads of Kinesin-1 are rotated “toward each other to be bridged and cross-linked by a single tail peptide.” In this idea that they named “double lockdown,” one of the tails binds to both the heads, preventing the heads from separating. In order for the protein to operate, the heads must be separate to use the cell’s energy and power the motor. Therefore, Kinesin-1 is in an “energy-saver” mode when it is wrapped.
This novel model for the inhibition pattern for Kinesin-1 needs to be investigated further, which is what Hackney’s group is working on now. Since so many neurological diseases have a basis in the motor proteins working incorrectly, finding out the molecular mechanics of the proteins can be the first step in perhaps one day fixing the deficiencies and removing the neurological diseases completely.

Appliance manufacturing company Dyson has recently released a line of fans and heaters advertised as “bladeless air multipliers.” The sleek look and the lack of visible blades have been well received; however, skeptics are questioning whether the increased price tag is justified by the new design.
The fact is that these fans are not bladeless, as claimed. The technology used to propel the air out of the fan is explained on Dyson’s website. Air is drawn in at the base through a small grate and then accelerated by a motor before being propelled up through the column and out at the top through the vertical ring. In the image of the impeller motor, one can see that the fan’s design still includes blades. The Air Multiplier merely appears bladeless because the blades and motor are hidden from view within the vertical column, and the accelerated air is funneled up out of the ring without any apparent moving parts.
The Air Multiplier is also described as being able to deliver a continuous stream of air, in contrast with traditional fans that deliver buffeted air as a result of the blades chopping the air.
Because the Air Multiplier also uses blades, albeit hidden ones, it seems unlikely that Dyson’s product manages to avoid this chopping of the air entirely. This claim to a more continuous air flow might be justified, however, when one compares the designs of the Air Multiplier to those of traditional fans. Dyson’s impellar motor has nine blades, whereas traditional fans usually have four or five blades. The increased frequency of the blades is therefore likely to smooth some of the air buffeting that people feel with traditional fans.
While this new product may offer some advantages, including an easier-to-clean, sleeker design, a lack of blades is not among those advantages.

Scientists suggest why laughter feels good
Scientists at the University of Oxford released the results of a study that may help explain why laughter is pleasurable. A series of experiments tested participants’ resistance to pain before and after a bout of laughter that was induced by various comedic videos. Pain was induced at certain times by a freezing wine sleeve wrapped around participants’ forearms.
The results showed that laughter caused an increase in pain resistance, and the scientists attribute the pain resistance to an increased flow of endorphins that accompany muscle contractions involved during laughter.

Snails may have flown over Mexico in birds’ bellies
Two different species of snail found in Central America with a common ancestor were thought to have been separated for good. They were separated when a land bridge sprang up between them nearly 3 million years ago. A study released this week, however, shows that the DNA of both populations provides evidence of the two snail species mingling long after the land bridge formed. Scientists believe that a heron may have eaten some snails from either species, flown over modern-day Mexico, and excreted them several days later near the other species; they are thought to have survived due to their armored shells.

NASA plans to build deep-space rocket
On Wednesday, NASA announced plans for a large $10 billion deep-space rocket to carry astronauts to locations much further than the International Space Station, such as the moon and Mars. The rocket’s first test flight is scheduled for 2017 from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The rocket is aimed to be more powerful than the Saturn booster used during the Apollo missions that took place between 1969 and 1972. The new rocket project is working toward President Obama’s request for a human expedition to an asteroid by 2025 and a trip to Mars sometime in the 2030s.

Prehistoric feathers found preserved in amber
Paleontologists at the University of Alberta in Edmonton searched through more than 4,000 amber inclusions collected in western Canada and found 11 prehistoric feathers. The amber samples, which are between 70 and 85 million years old, provide paleontologists with the most diverse and best preserved set of samples to date. The features of the feathers suggest that they may have come from non-avian dinosaurs such as Sinosauropteryx.

Thermal imaging camera reveals dishonesty
Researchers in the United Kingdom are experimenting with thermal imaging technology to detect when someone is lying. The thermal imaging camera captures differences in facial temperature in response to questioning. Certain areas of the face, such as around the eyes and the cheeks, are highly sensitive to temperature rise, and are closely monitored by the imaging technology. About 30 to 40 subjects have been tested so far with a two in three success rate.

Exoplanet orbiting two stars discovered
A planet 200 light-years away orbiting two stars was recently discovered thanks to NASA’s Kepler space telescope. The telescope measured small decreases in brightness as the planet occasionally passed in front of each of the two stars, blocking some of the stars’ light. There is also evidence of the planet’s gravity pulling on the two stars, shifting their orbits and causing them to eclipse each other at irregular times.

The power of the collective is the center of attention at the Miller Gallery’s 2011 Pittsburgh Biennial exhibit, an exciting display of work by five local art organizations.
On the first floor, the group Temporary Services, consisting of artists Brett Bloom, Salem Colo-Julin, and Carnegie Mellon alumnus Marc Fischer, presents a collection of books from the “Do-it-Ourselves” movement, titled The Self Reliance Library. Along with the book collection, the exhibit included quotes picked from the collection and quilted on discarded trash bags. Convincing visitors to interact with work in a gallery setting can be difficult, but The Self Reliance Library does it well. Each of the books looks like someone’s worn-out favorite, lent to a friend to share some new ideas that they would really enjoy. The quotes, too, invite you to look a little closer. Each is an enticing view into something resting on the shelves right in front of you, asking you to pick up The Survivor if only to find out why “the inexperienced dreamer simply cannot survive alone.”
From there on, every floor houses two separate exhibits from two separate artist collectives. The second floor is split between a politically motivated billboard landscape from artists’ cooperative JustSeeds and an informative space on sustainable deconstruction by artist group Tranzformazium. The contrast between JustSeeds’ larger-than-life billboard, reading “A Billionaire Stole your Job, Not Migrant Labor,” and Transformazium’s neatly stacked pile of bricks, cleaned by the three female artists in attendance, was interesting to say the least, but each concept shone brighter when viewed separately.
JustSeeds’ side packs a powerful visual punch. The billboards loom over you and huddle together, creating walls of industrial-looking forms illuminated by fluorescent lighting that forcibly sell beauty and acceptance. JustSeeds’ exhibit is an ironic combination of street art, a sterile gallery setting, and harsh material forms that ends up coming together to effectively sell its cause — migrant worker reform.
Tranzformazium, on the other hand, uses visual aids to enhance a personally powerful topic. The four women who compose Tranzformazium, Ruthie Stringer, Dana Bishop-Root, Leslie Stem, and Caledonia Curry, have been sustainably deconstructing their North Braddock-based home since the spring of 2009, and they have learned a lot about both their community and green building practices along the way. Their exhibit showcases a mixture of these revelations through props, interactive pamphlets, and a video documenting their process.
The third floor houses the final two organizations: subRosa, a collective focusing on feminist scientists that consists of Hyla Willis and Faith Wilding, and a group of artists presenting Global Cities, Model Worlds, consisting of Sarah Ross, Ryan Griffis, and Carnegie Mellon alumna Lize Mogel (CFA ’92). Both of these organizations chose to present high-concept material, grounded in visual presentation.
Global Cities, Model Worlds sits in the center of the room, splitting subRosa’s exhibit in two. The show consists of photos comparing Olympic stadiums, cities before and after “mega-events,” and birds’ eye views of coastlines, along with models illustrating facts about world fairs and Olympic events. Each model or photo presents a wealth of information, showing readers that almost all world fairs and Olympic events have been hosted in Europe, the United States, or Asia, and that Beijing citizens were forcibly evicted from their homes in preparation for the 2008 Olympics.
subRosa’s space is less informative and more exploratory, asking visitors to essentially create the art themselves, by either writing a letter to a feminist scientist or by sitting down at a tea table and having a conversation with a total stranger (an idea borrowed from a Virginia Woolf essay calling for “tea table thinking”). subRosa’s exhibit tries to connect people, either by fostering communication between isolated pockets of high-profile women or by simply putting strangers attending a gallery opening together. Only time can tell how productive their idealistic concept will be.
These five organizations present inspiring examples of the transforming power of collaborative art, and the results are worth the trip. Be sure to stop by the Miller Gallery to see their section of the Pittsburgh Biennial, running through Dec. 11, and visit their website to find out more about workshops associated with Transformazium’s work. In addition, revel in some Pittsburgh pride by visiting Biennial events happening across the city at the Carnegie Museum of Art, the Andy Warhol Museum, Pittsburgh Filmmakers, and the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts.

It’s rare to see a game pushing a realistic social issue — in fact, most video games ignore modern issues altogether in favor of a suspended, thrilling reality (a la Call of Juarez or Battlefield). Catherine, a new Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 title developed and published by Atlus, diverges sharply from this stereotype and brings some truly relevant themes into the spotlight.
The game’s story follows a man named Vincent, a software engineer trapped in a mid-’30s crisis of drinking and aimlessness. He has been dating a girl named Katherine for years, but is terrified of committing to her. Enter Catherine, a blonde bombshell who just happens to share the same name as Katherine. Initially a one-night stand, Catherine pulls Vincent from the pressures of his relationship with Katherine and draws him into a steamy affair. He is ultimately forced to confront his own life goals and ponder the nature of his two romances.
The first half of gameplay involves making social choices on Vincent’s behalf. During Vincent’s evenings of drinking at The Stray Sheep, the player not only interacts with the other patrons of the bar face-to-face, but must also respond to calls and text messages from both Catherine and Katherine. At The Stray Sheep, the player picks up local rumors, helps other characters sort through their own personal issues, and juggles two love affairs simultaneously. The player is given a meter that, similar to the game Mass Effect, runs the gamut between pure red (Catherine) and pure blue (Katherine). Certain actions — for example, refusing to meet with Catherine or supporting the idea of marriage to Katherine — will cause the meter to turn more blue, while favorably responding to Catherine’s sexy cell phone pics will turn it red. With time, it’s soon implied that there’s more to Catherine than meets the eye.
The secondary narrative follows a series of strange deaths in Vincent’s area; initially more of a backdrop, Vincent soon begins to have terrible nightmares in which he is turned into a sheep and prepared for slaughter. To escape certain death, he must spend each night climbing blocks and solving puzzles. This is where the core gameplay starts: Players start off by pushing around regular blocks to make climbable formations, and the levels later scale up to special blocks — slippery “ice” blocks, cracked blocks, “flame” blocks, and immovable blocks. Over the course of a week, the puzzles get gradually more difficult, and each one has a time limit, after which the blocks beneath Vincent collapse and the level restarts. Independent of the story line, the gameplay is compelling enough to stand on its own, and it brings a unique perspective to a tradition of block puzzles dating back to early Zelda games.
At the end of each level, the player is asked a question. For example, “Is marriage the point where life ends... or begins?” The responses to these questions, alongside the player’s choices in previous conversations, will influence the outcome of the love story; there are eight endings to the game in total.
Ultimately, Catherine does have its flaws. The graphics are not much more advanced than the Persona graphics of previous years, and the puzzle gameplay can get repetitive in later stages. Although the gameplay tries to become more difficult, the player can learn new techniques that make it easy to skip entire sections of puzzles.
Additionally, the socialization aspect of the game soon becomes more of a mechanic used to game the system — for example, trying to get “the Catherine ending” involves consistently being mean to Katherine, even if that is not what the player would otherwise choose. For this reason, upon a first play-through, players should disregard trying to achieve any one specific outcome, and instead react as they would in real life to the given situations the game presents.
But Catherine manages to pull off a deeper message that is well tailored to today’s college-age generation: It deals with the post-coming-of-age slump and the pressures society places on men and women — to fall in love, to rush through youth and build a life, and to be productive members of society at all times. The fear that Vincent feels as a character is reflected in the generation playing Catherine, a generation that is often called “slow to mature.” Through Vincent, Catherine makes a case that being afraid of these changes is natural, but to avoid them altogether is ultimately a path that few are able to take.

Imagine this: A tall, handsome, blond British man adopting an extraordinarily high-pitched voice is addressing two other guys. He is running a counseling session for men who “don’t show their emotions.” To aid him in this task, he is wielding a special “truth spoon.” He convinces the two others to each reveal a deep secret, and then admits one himself — with the help of the spoon, of course. In a very tender voice, he confesses that he is in fact a traveling con artist, blackmailing his clients with their newly revealed truths.
This subtle yet hilarious flavor of comedy was plentiful in Pretty Little Panic, the Cambridge Footlights’ touring production, sponsored by Scotch’n’Soda Theatre last Friday. After a memorable performance last year, the Footlights returned and delivered in a big way.
The Cambridge Footlights is a comedy troupe that has existed since 1883. Stemming from the prominent Cambridge University in England, the troupe has become a world-renowned group with such notable alumni as Hugh Laurie and Sacha Baron Cohen.
When the audience first entered McConomy Auditorium Friday night, the lights were dimmed. There were three tall slabs of wood, painted black, standing on the center of the stage. Blue and red stage lights subtly lit the space as music by the Arctic Monkeys and other British bands played in the background.
As the show began, two blonds, a ginger, and a brunette sauntered onto the stage (Mark Fiddaman, Alexander Owen, Ben Ashenden, and Adam Lawrence, respectively), wearing identical white cotton long-sleeve shirts and black skinny jeans. Their attire didn’t distract from their performance, allowing the audience to better connect with the characters and their short acts.
The troupe breezed through more than 20 skits, at times returning to previous themes. The rapid-fire comedy was refreshing and a “different kind of humor that was so funny,” said Liliana Kong, a junior in industrial design. The performance’s success was largely due to the cast of four’s incredible commitment.
“Incredible. I really liked it,” said Feyza Koksal, a fifth-year architecture student. This sentiment seemed to echo through the University Center after the performance ended.
Chidimma Onwuegbule, a first-year in CIT, said, “There was not a slow moment. It kept you constantly entertained.”
In an interview, the Footlights and their entourage attributed the organization’s continued success to its strong past membership, most notably in the ’60s and ’70s, as well as the strong infrastructure the performers have in place — they often convene and put on performances every two weeks. They loved performing here at Carnegie Mellon because of how receptive the audience was to their humor.
The British came, and they conquered — at least here at Carnegie Mellon. After the Footlights’ well-received production, it appears Carnegie Mellon students would be up for a Footlights invasion any day.

Strolling into narrow alleys between fancy skyscrapers in China, it is not hard to notice the reddish character “Chai” painted on the old houses, which means “pull down.” The destiny these buildings will face, as “Chai” suggests, is demolition. This might not sound special, but it means a lot to those residents who are moved forcibly by the Chinese government and real estate companies.
The story of the documentary Meishi Street, screened in Margaret Morrison 203 last week in conjunction with the “Global Cities, Model Worlds” lecture, involves the protest of a “nail household,” a Chinese phrase for a house whose owner refuses to let it be demolished for the sake of modernization. As a part of Beijing’s modernization plan, Meishi Street, an old street in Beijing where Zhang Jinli lives, is under threat of being turned into a business area.
While most of the residents choose to compromise, Zhang refuses the displacement because he doesn’t want to leave the place he called home and because the government’s compensation offer is unfair. In protest, Zhang hangs banners and national flags on his house, writes petition letters (but never gets responses) and even sings aloud to attract public attention. However, the saddest point in the documentary comes when security guards request that Zhang to stop all of his protests. Not only is Zhang going to lose his home, he is deprived of the right to even protest about it.
In the movie, there are three parties involved: the government (represented by security guards and officials), the real estate companies (removal companies), and the residents. One might think that the government would speak for the people, or at the very least remain neutral, but the reality in China is almost the opposite. Residents have nowhere to seek help. So the banners hung on the street by the Chinese government saying “Demolition and removal in strict accordance with laws” seem exceptionally unnecessary — after all, residents have no other choice.
Despite frustrating results after all of Zhang’s efforts, the positive side we can gather from the movie is that Chinese people have begun to gain awareness of rights which they have been deprived in the past. They now know they can protest and, most importantly, should protest in a legal way, as Zhang did.
The movie winds up with a sad but thought-provoking ending. According to Mahatma Gandhi, “Housing is a right.” The movie rouses the audience to think about how we can popularize this right and resolve the conflict between modernization and citizens’ right to a home.

The San Francisco band Girls released its follow-up EP Father, Son, Holy Ghost on Sept. 12. Despite the musical variance from the band’s incredibly successful 2009 LP Album and its 2010 EP Broken Dreams Club, reception has been incredibly positive.
While some of the songs on Father, Son, Holy Ghost have familiar elements — faint riffs and vocal patterns similar to songs on Album and Broken Dreams Club can still be heard — the EP maintains a certain uniqueness.
In the EP’s second track, “Alex,” lead singer Christopher Owens’ voice has a steady softness to it that is absent in the band’s previous work. The melody is haunting and airy, as Owens seems to be subduing the sharp tonality of his voice that has become his signature sound. The song “Alex” represents just how greatly Girls has changed its sound — while Girls’ previous sound resembled the Beach Boys, “Alex” unexpectedly sounds more like a combination of Elliot Smith’s vocals, The Cure’s “Just Like Heaven,” and Silversun Pickups’ “Lazy Eye.”
That is not to suggest that Girls has lost touch with its tonal roots. The EP’s first track, “Honey Bunny,” has a bass line that has a shuffling, peppy beat. In contrast, the song “Die” channels classic rock with its brown-acid guitar riffs and an opening melody that sounds as if it was scooped straight off a Velvet Revolver album and sprinkled with some heavy distortion. The divide between these two tracks, though they are consecutive on the album itself, is so drastic that one might think they were performed by different artists.
“Forgiveness” is an eight-minute-long song that without a doubt represents the emotional core of the album. Owens takes listeners on an epic journey, exploring love, loss, and fear, and with each passing second the song builds and builds until the tension is released with an incredibly daunting and melodic guitar solo.
Arguably one of the album’s most intimate moments is in the song “Love Like a River,” when Owens sings in pockets of a cappella and is eventually accompanied by a dainty harmonica part. Although the ideas behind the song’s lyrics are incredibly simple — Owens sings “My love is like a river / She just keeps on rolling on” — Owens and his musical partner Chet “JR” White perform the song and present the story in a way that is neither repetitive nor cliché.
Girls is one of those few bands that is able to successfully refresh its sound and stay relevant. Its ability to stretch its sound across many canvases is one that is rare and should not be overlooked in modern music.

This past Thursday afternoon, Pittsburgh Biennial artists Sarah Ross, Ryan Griffis, and Lize Mogel gave a lecture titled “Global Cities, Model Worlds,” shedding some light on the oft-observed, but seldom discussed, impact of global “mega-events.” These events, such as the World’s Fair and Olympic Games, profoundly transform their host communities. Insightful and entertaining, the presentation did a fabulous job of analyzing the massive socioeconomic footprint created by the confluence of such vastly diverse cultures, accounting for both the positives and negatives.
Consider, for example, the Olympic Games. Originally an Ancient Greek test of strength and endurance, the Games were revived in 1896 by French academic Pierre de Coubertin. Griffis described Coubertin’s philosophy as “civilizing people by competition.” While his words may seem a bit archaic, Coubertin’s underlying belief in the profound impact of the Games still resonates in modern Games. The 2008 Beijing Olympics required close to a decade of planning, so much so that Mogel likened the effect to the creation of an “Olympic village, or a global city” — a sprawling and seemingly self-sustaining city-within-a-city, equipped with infrastructure, banks, labor, and security forces. Griffis noted that these efforts were by no means futile, that the Beijing Olympics constituted not only a “physical mega-event, but a heavily media-sponsored visual one, attended by hundreds of millions of viewers around the world.”
The World’s Fair, described by Griffis as “an international harmony of commerce and culture,” is another colossal global expo. After a visual presentation of several cities’ world fairs, the presenters emphasized a core idea in their research: the theme of global progress, particularly conveyed by the host city. Mogel evidenced this notion of a “progressive vision of global utopia” by giving the example of San Francisco’s 1939 International Expo. The city took the progressive undertones of the event to heart, building both the Bay and Golden Gate Bridges for that very purpose. The fair itself was held on the man-made Treasure Island, a public project once again undertaken for the sake of progress. Mogel concluded that these events have immensely “developed the city, especially in the years following the fair.”
The final portion of the presentation turned the rest on its head: What is the downside to these mega-events? The presenters returned to events in China, this time to discuss the 2010 Shanghai Expo. Attended by over 70 million people, the event was undoubtedly amazing. However, as Ross put it: “While the event put Shanghai on the map, there’s a lot we didn’t get to see.” In planning the expo, over 3.65 million square meters of property were demolished, displacing hundreds of thousands of families in the process. Those that resisted this forceful eviction were referred to as “nail households,” since the properties stuck out like nails in the ruin. Griffis concluded that these mega-events provide a sort of media shield for host cities, overshadowing blatant violations of civil rights with gaudy “manifestations of the progressive vision.”
The “Global Cities, Model Worlds” talk gave both illuminating evidence about the power of these mega-events and raised questions about the negative effects of their associated progress. The most amazing part about the lecture was that it just examined the tip of the iceberg; nobody can cover in one hour a history full of events whose impacts lasted centuries. However, even this brief introduction is incredibly thought-provoking; what if a mega-event came to Pittsburgh? How would it impact the city, for better or for worse?

Despite being free, many Flash games have a fixation on in-game currency. Combos and kills are used to rack up points used so players can buy bigger and better gear, while experience points are allocated to boost character stats. Super soldiers and small furry animals alike scramble to grab coins in these productivity killers. In Coinbox Hero, the latest quirky game from Armor Games’ jmtb02, there is little to do besides reveal and grab coins, and despite the intentionally limited gameplay, it’s still an entirely fulfilling experience.
The game features a nonsensical plot that leads to an amusing ending playing off the heir apparent to the Rick-rolling crown. The premise involves a pixelated polka band that comes across one of the mysterious boxes from the Mario games which reward passersby for smashing their heads against the ceiling with cold hard cash. Usually, that just translates into points, but here we see that scratch turned into a simple investment system. Those coins can be used to purchase weapons and abilities that yield even more money from the stubborn box.
Further aiding your lederhosen-wearing sprite in his labors are “helpers” that can be set to either attack the box directly or collect the money that has been smacked out of it. The gameplay never gets challenging, but in order to beat the game in a reasonable amount of time, some fully upgraded and kitted-out aids are a must. Seeing an entire squad of polka players wailing on a box with giant fans and filling the screen with coins collected by another character moving at NASCAR speed is as absurd as it is fun.
Leaderboards exist, although an Armor Games account is required to report your own score. The fastest times show that the game has been beaten in just over 10 minutes, although honing the skills and strategy required to achieve such a feat must take a considerable amount of time.
Visually, the game is not incredibly impressive. At least, not until the maximum coin count is purchased and up to 3,000 coins start bouncing around with impressive particle physics for a game that took a total of nine days to make. Unlike many jmtb02 games, the music won’t be stuck in your head for a week; appropriately enough, it is a simple, inoffensive polka.
This game is the latest in a long string of interesting flash titles by jmtb02, all of which are notable for slick presentation and surprisingly deep gameplay, running the gamut from the frantic puzzles of the Ball Revamped series to the satirical yet delightful Achievement Unlocked.
Coinbox Hero is a fun diversion and will appeal to anybody with time to kill and the ability to laugh at the idea of four German Mario wannabes using crossbows to save up for a tactical nuke.

When we share our experiences in Spain, Juan and I jokingly say that we were promised decadent adventures of wine, beachside serenades, and quaint mountain villages, but instead got endless confusion with foreign relatives and a nauseatingly endless supply of pork.
The truth is that the trip was one of a lifetime. Then again, you’d expect that from two months in Spain. We went to Spain to work with World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms, an organization that connects volunteers with organic farmers from across the world. We stayed at a small town in the province of Huelva called Aracena and could travel at our own leisure, visiting family and friends for another month after our time working. Our home base was Zaragoza, the home of Juan’s grandparents and great aunts and uncles. We zipped back and forth to Madrid, Barcelona, Cordoba, Huelva, Granada, and Segovia. From planes and buses, to trains and cars, during our two months we experienced all of Spain’s forms of motorized transportation.
As expected, we ate spectacular meals, saw breathtaking sights, and met fascinating people. But, we won’t bore you with those particulars. If you’ve watched any Anthony Bourdain or read any Federico Garcia Lorca, you can imagine it all pretty well.
Advanced Flavors
For starters, we learned that America is the land of advanced flavors. We had never realized how far the US and the UK have gotten away from the concept of natural flavorings until Leon, a soon-to-be investment banker we had met, explained his seemingly odd craving for “advanced candies.” Advanced candies? We were baffled at what he meant. He then explained, “You know, advanced, the kind of thing you can’t find in nature like blue raspberry or pink fuzz berry. The kinds of things where the best way to describe them is not by the flavor of the drink, but by the color.”
It turns out that Spain doesn’t have advanced flavors. In Spain, when you order a soda, you’ve got three choices for flavors: cola, diet cola, or orange. For Leon, a Londoner raised on only the sweetest of candies and sodas, this was a nightmare. To him, this was a sign that Spain was a backwards country. To us, it was a sign that something was off in the UK and US. Since when was ubiquity of artificial flavorings a prerequisite for a modern society? Weren’t libraries, computers, and democracy enough?
Goats
Juan learned a lot on the farm about goats, like how dealing with goats is like dealing with women. The first day that we were milking goats with Manuel, our boss, Juan was having trouble getting the goats to stop kicking him when he was grabbing at their udders. Manuel told Juan that grabbing a goats’s teat was just like grabbing a woman — “Do not ask for permission.” You really just have to go for it and grab it! No one should heed this advice too strongly though, unless you normally take advice from a guy that unapologetically wears un-ironic pot t-shirts where anthropomorphized pot leaves smoke joints.
Shawarma
When we weren’t on the finca (ranch) and found ourselves out late in bustling cities, hunger would often hit us with a vengeance. At those times, shawarma, an inexpensive Middle-Eastern street food, became a godsend.
Given our experiences, we recommend you sit down in a shawarma place and order to your heart’s desire, rather than shell out loads of cash to get an “authentic” experience. After all, what’s more authentic than immigrants trying to make a buck in a European metropolis by selling tasty food?
To elaborate a little on the possibility of finding yourself in shawarma heaven, we could have sworn that one night in Granada we had gotten fried brains in our kebab. How did we know? The shawarma was too good.
After biting into the warmth and juicy softness of the kebab, we knew karma had bestowed upon us a genuine gift. Although we were a bit apprehensive to continue eating after our realization regarding its contents, we kept nibbling and found that the kebab was too good to not devour.
Every day in Spain with Juan was so memorable and hilarious, and there are honestly just too many wonderful things to share at once.

Dear Patrick,
I just moved off campus this year with a couple of my buddies, and we’re hoping to throw a couple parties. Do you have any tips on throwing a successful party?
Thanks,
Just About to Make a Bash in Our Residential Everyday Environment
Dear JAMBOREE,
For starters, you need booze. Lots of booze. How much do you have now? Double that. Next up is music. Do you like rubbing yourself on people? Play some house music. Are you on ecstasy? Listen to trance. Are you a tool? Dubstep. If you can tell the difference between all these, listen to some real music. Otherwise, just choose some upbeat music to play in the background of your party. Now you just need to get people to come to your party.
When inviting guests, the most important thing to keep in mind is the guy/girl ratio. Too many guys and the girls will get creeped out by all the guys breathing heavily. Too many girls and — well, that’s just not gonna happen. This is Carnegie Mellon, after all. So, you need to make sure girls come to your party. If that means making it flower- and unicorn-themed, then you’ve got to bite the bullet. 
Unicorns are awesome,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
When my friend has had a bit to drink, he likes to make fun of people and thinks he’s funny. It really just makes everyone uncomfortable. How can I make him stop?
Thanks,
Angry Buddy Uses Sarcastic Insults, Victimizes Every Accomplice, Loses Cool, Often Hurts Our feeLings, Inebriated Currently
Dear ABUSIVE ALCOHOLIC,
Is your friend always mean, or is it only after he’s had a couple? If he’s usually nice, maybe he takes drinking as a chance to tell that jagoff how much he hates him. Try some behavior modification — a piece of chocolate when he’s nice, and an electric shock whenever he insults someone.
Alternatively, maybe the people your friend is being mean to deserve it, like that one girl who gave everyone else a slice of pie but not him. Yeah, you know who you are. Are you often the butt of your friend’s jokes? If they’re in good fun, try lightening up. If they’re generally hurtful, have a talk with him about what’s appropriate. If he’s a CS major, he can’t help it — they just don’t know how to talk to people.
At least he doesn’t hit people with beer bottles,
Patrick Hoskins

Last night, a few friends and I watched (Untitled), a movie that, in short, satirizes the culture of modern art. I can’t say that it was a particularly brilliant film or that we actually finished watching it, but it did get me thinking about the true essence of music. In the movie, the main character is a struggling composer whose pieces are essentially a cacophony of sound. This includes atonal clarinet solos combined with bucket-kicking and paper-ripping. While the individual sounds were interesting, together it was rather unpleasant and stilted. Defending his music, the character states that harmony is a capitalist ploy to sell pianos.
Though it is a humorous line intended to reveal the pretentious nature of such composers, I couldn’t help but feel a little sad for the character. He has clearly never experienced the magical feeling of a perfectly constructed harmony breaking over him. Nor has he felt the relief you experience when a melody is resolved or the contrasting tension when the song catches you off guard and takes you places you never expected.
What is music but a fight against the entropy of random noise? Admittedly, this a slightly warped version of a professor’s quote that life is the fight against entropy, but I find it to be quite apt. Music has the power to take the disorder that is ever present throughout life and channel it into something beautiful. It gives both a context for and a way to relate to the vast array of emotions and feelings in the world around us.
Granted, music, as with any art form, is subjective and open to interpretation. However, when you are listening to something honest, raw, and without pretense, you are able to take away truths about yourself. A little self-discovery every once in a while is not a bad thing. You could even use music to escape the world for a while. In any case, you are not sending a grand message into the world by kicking a bucket and calling it music.

100 YEARS AGO — Sept. 28, 1911
The Tartan publishes the “Anti-Magee Republican County Ticket,” a guide to the exact candidates for whom readers should vote in the upcoming election. It even advises students to “take this in the booth with you” — because obviously Carnegie students can’t be trusted to decide for themselves.
50 YEARS AGO — Sept. 20, 1961
Writer Paul Carnahan introduces a new column, “Motivation of the Interviewer.” He hopes that by interviewing professional men, “this column will aid in the direct purpose of Carnegie education; that is, the education of the whole man.” Sorry, ladies, but clearly your education isn’t important here.
25 YEARS AGO — Sept. 16, 1986
A Tartan comic shows an administrator announcing the Carnegie Space Program, saying the school is preparing “to voyage into that dark abysmal expanse.” Meanwhile, in the following frame, a lost soul in Hamerschlag Hall shouts, “Just how many #!@*?! basements are in this place?” Good to see that some things are still relevant 25 years later.
10 YEARS AGO — Sept. 17, 2001
Kristen Lala, a self-described Greyhound connoisseur, provides a highly detailed account of her recent trip via Greyhound bus from Pittsburgh to State College. The journey, which is only 136 miles, managed to take up over six hours of her day. Too bad they didn’t have a Megabus back then for her to take instead.
FIVE YEARS AGO — Sept. 18, 2006
Students voice their concerns about recent changes to Facebook and worry that, because access to the site is no longer restricted, it will lose its novelty. Despite their fears, Facebook is still going strong — apparently, the friend requests they got from their moms didn’t deter users as much as initially predicted.
ONE YEAR AGO — Sept. 20, 2010
Ph.D. student Hannah Knight launches the Carnegie Mellon 2010 Robot Census, the first such effort to document all robots on campus. Her last-reported count was nearly 600 robots. Thankfully, they’re still vastly outnumbered by students, so we should still be able to protect ourselves should the robot revolution occur anytime soon.

Although embroiled in controversy, Rwandan President Paul Kagame’s visit to Carnegie Mellon last Friday was a significant event, as both he and University President Jared Cohon announced the creation of a new Carnegie Mellon campus in Kigali, Rwanda.
Kagame delivered his keynote address to a packed crowd of attendees who underwent security checks that included metal detectors and pat-downs by security officials. The event, which was held in the University Center’s Rangos Hall, was hosted by Pradeep K. Khosla, the Dowd university professor and dean of the Carnegie Institute of Technology.
Kagame’s visit was not met without opposition, however. A group of protesters clustered near the bus stop on Forbes Avenue, with shouts of “Kagame! Genocidaire!” alleging Kagame’s involvement in the murders of Congolese Hutus by Rwandan military forces.
Prior to the ceremony and announcement in Rangos, The Tartan interviewed Cohon to obtain background knowledge of the partnership between Carnegie Mellon and the new program in Kigali.
Cohon noted that Rwanda’s government, recognizing Carnegie Mellon’s strengths in information systems and technology, envisioned the university as a partner in advancing its goals. He explained that Kagame had initiated the partnership himself. “Rwanda stepped forward because of President Kagame’s vision and said, ‘We want to be the center for information and communications technologies.’ And then that sent them on a path of finding a Western university, an American university to be their partner.”
Cohon said that Carnegie Mellon accepted the partnership because of the university’s need for global outreach to nations with lower levels of socioeconomic development. “Carnegie Mellon sees as part of its mission not only becoming a global university, but having global impact. Africa is a part of the world that really is in desperate need of higher education resources.” Cohon also emphasized Rwanda’s exceptional economic progress among African nations. “Rwanda stands out among African nations. It’s had a remarkable economic growth rate in the last decade or so,” he said.
When the event began, Khosla provided a short introduction and welcomed both Cohon and Kagame to the stage.
Cohon then delivered his initial address. He noted Rwanda’s remarkable economic progress and lauded Kagame for the nation’s status as a leader in information and communication technologies among African countries. He also offered praise for the nation’s resilience in the 17 years since the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Cohon noted Rwanda’s progress in many areas: greater rates of economic growth, increased access to life-saving medical treatment, and higher rates of educational attainment.
Kagame began his own address by underscoring the need for partnerships between developed Western nations and developing nations, particularly those in Africa.
“We know that despite decades of partnership between developed and developing nations, the world remains largely imbalanced in terms of socioeconomic progress,” Kagame said. “On the one hand, some nations have acquired many skills and technological capabilities to better the lives of their people. While on the other hand, you have societies that are still trapped in poverty and dealing with the most pressing development issues.”
Kagame believes that these partnerships “not only lead to innovative solutions ... [they] also power growth and facilitate greater participation in the global economy.” He explained how he believes that Rwanda will achieve innovation in information technology as well as continued economic growth and access to higher education. “Our national development agenda is focused on investing in our major indispensable resource — our people,” he explained.
The university in Kigali will be especially focused on building a knowledge-based economy and developing the necessary technological skills to power Rwanda’s economic engine. Kagame noted that the partnership between Carnegie Mellon and Rwanda signals a shift in interactions between the developed and developing world. 
Kagame said, “I do believe this is evidence of a changing tide in a global partnership — one that I am happy to personally associate with.”

Protesters gathered outside the University Center to speak out against Carnegie Mellon’s partnership with Rwandan President Paul Kagame during Kagame’s address last Friday.
Carnegie Mellon unveiled plans to open a new center in Rwanda which will provide graduate education in information and communications technology. University President Jared Cohon called Kagame and his dedication to the program “visionary,” saying that Kagame’s leadership is one of the reasons that Rwanda has been able to achieve peace and stability after the Rwandan genocide in 1994, in which at least 800,000 members of the minority Tutsi ethnic group were killed by members of the majority Hutu ethnic group.
The protesters, however, believe that Kagame has committed too many human rights abuses for any partnership with or endorsement of him to be acceptable. One concern they cited was the lack of free speech in Rwanda.
Last year, Reporters Without Borders ranked Rwanda 169th out of 178 countries in its worldwide freedom of the press index. According to an Amnesty International factbook from 2011, during Kagame’s 2010 re-election campaign, he shut down two newspapers and imprisoned two journalists and a political opponent, citing national security concerns and “divisionism” in their rhetoric.
“Right now what the narrative is saying is that the Rwandan people are going to benefit [from the partnership], and I put a big question mark over that,” Rebecca Cech, one of the protest’s organizers, said. “If the proposition is to be benefitting Rwandan people, you have to be sure that the things are in place to support free press.” Cech, who is from the Congo, said that the coalition she works with consists of Rwandans as well as people from surrounding areas of Africa. Several Carnegie Mellon students were involved in the protest. “I don’t believe the benefits of a partnership like that outweigh the consequences of supporting someone with such an atrocious human rights record,” said Dan Markowicz, a doctoral student in English. “And I think it’s bad for the reputation of the school.”
Not everyone agrees that Kagame’s freedom of speech record is so straightforward. 
A counter-protest consisting largely of Rwandans carrying signs of support for Kagame appeared outside the University Center shortly after Cech’s group. “To see where [Rwanda] has come is just a remarkable story,” counter-protester Godfrey Biravanga said. “Granted, we have a long way to go, but to suggest that Rwanda is not on the right track is just ridiculous.” According to University of Pittsburgh law professor Charles Jalloh, who specializes in international human rights law and regularly visits Rwanda, the truth about Kagame’s human rights record is complicated.
“I find a lot of the concerns quite overblown and overstated,” Jalloh said. “I think that a lot of it fails to acknowledge the complexities of what is going on in Rwanda, which go back to what happened in 1994.”
Jalloh said that the Rwandan laws repressing freedom of speech — the ones that were used to justify the arrest of Kagame’s political opponents — are ones that attempt to suppress genocidal ideology and ethnic divisions such as the one between the Hutus and Tutsis. 
Cohon said that he takes the university’s reputation very seriously, but that he too thinks the situation is more complex than the protesters make it out to be. “One of the things I’ve learned personally, and I think I’m probably typical among those of us who look carefully at Rwanda, is how complicated and nuanced a country in that situation can be,” Cohon said.
The protesters also carried signs and shouted chants accusing Kagame of the murders of millions of Congolese. One common chant was, “Kagame, genocidaire.” Genocidaire is a term for a perpetrator of genocide. In 2009, the United Nations released a report that alleged that Rwanda may have committed genocide on the Hutu people during its 1996–97 pursuit of Hutu perpetrators of the 1994 genocide who had fled to the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo, then called Zaire. The report said that the large number of innocent Hutu civilians who were killed or harmed suggested that they were not merely collateral damage, and that the intent of the Rwandan military may have been to destroy the Hutu people “in whole or in part,” in accordance with the definition of genocide in international law. 
However, the report also raised doubts about this intent, noting that the Rwandan military also spared Hutu lives and helped many Hutu back into Rwanda. 
The Rwandan government issued an official rebuttal of the report, denying any claims of genocide and saying that the report used “flawed methodology and application of the lowest imaginable evidentiary standard.” There have also been allegations that Rwanda is exploiting Congolese mineral resources. According to Cech, the amount of minerals which have recently been officially exported from Rwanda does not physically exist within the country. “Part of [the success of Rwanda] is that it’s built on the backs of the Congolese, who have really paid the price in human life,” Cech said.
Carnegie Mellon professor of social and decision sciences and former Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Jendayi Frazer, however, says that though many Congolese believe that Rwandans are to blame for the instability in their country, the issue is more complicated than that.
“There are a lot of different groups that have been fighting in the Congo,” Frazer said. “There are Rwandan genocidaires in the Congo, there are Congolese militias. Those guys in eastern Congo that are Rwandan used it as a base to attack Rwandan villages along the border. Then there are the Congolese armed forces themselves; some of them are very undisciplined. The problems in eastern Congo today are not Rwandan, they’re Congolese.” 
Frazer also said that Carnegie Mellon’s planned educational center, despite its location in Rwanda, will be a regional center. This means the center could potentially educate citizens of many African nations, including the Congo. Cech hopes that the protest will inspire students to learn more about Rwanda and Kagame. “I would encourage people to educate themselves,” she said. “Look at the evidence, look at the whole story. Really look at the details and figure out, in context, what’s been happening.”
Jalloh said that those looking into the Rwandan situation should keep an open mind. “It is very easy to fall into a trap where you listen to one side of the argument,” he said. “It’s a very complex situation.”

As part of their effort to rally support behind building a new applied sciences and engineering campus in Willets Point, the Coalition for Queens is now reaching out to universities that had previously expressed interest in building such a facility in New York City.
On March 17 this year, 27 institutions, including Carnegie Mellon, submitted letters to New York City in response to an announcement from the city’s Economic Development Corporation (EDC) saying that the city is prepared to offer as much $100 million to aid in the construction of a new applied sciences and engineering campus. 
While the city is a leader in fields such as finance, entertainment, and art, it has relatively small tech and engineering industries compared to places like Silicon Valley.
Carnegie Mellon has thus far submitted two proposals to the EDC.
The university’s first proposal, which was jointly submitted in partnership with New York University, the University of Toronto, City University of New York, and IBM, primarily entails providing research support for a campus expansion at New York University.
“We may have a small physical presence, but certainly not a campus,” clarified Richard McCullough, Carnegie Mellon’s vice president for research, as quoted in The Pittsburgh Post Gazette. “Our faculty would help them to get research dollars, and we would get some of those research dollars.”
In a second, separate proposal, Carnegie Mellon expressed interest in creating a new digital media program in partnership with Steiner Studios. 
In an interview with The New York Times, Douglas Steiner, chairman of the studio, explained that Carnegie Mellon’s programs in entertainment technology will complement the studio’s plans to build a new film school in the Brooklyn Navy Yard.
After reviewing all the “Expressions of Interest,” the EDC will release requests for letters, and then the interested universities will have until Oct. 28 to draft their plans for development. By the end of the year, the EDC plans to have decided on which of the proposals to fund, but in the meantime, there is still a question over where a new facility or campus should be built.
In its initial announcement, the EDC suggested Roosevelt Island, the Brooklyn Navy Yard, Governors Island, or Staten Island as potential sites, but lately, the Coalition for Queens has been building support for construction in Willets Point.
“We’ve been reaching out to community leaders and government leaders,” said Jukay Hsu, founder of the Coalition for Queens. “We also have a lot of elected officials supporting us, including the Chair of Economic Development and the Chair of Land Use on the New York City Council.”
However, in a statement published in the Whitestone Times, EDC spokesman David Lombino dismissed arguments in favor of including Queens on the list of potential sites: “We are not going to include Willets Point in the Applied Sciences RFP because it would represent a significant diversion from a great plan for affordable housing, retail and open space.”
But Hsu remains optimistic, now turning his attention to the universities themselves. “We’re now reaching out to them and saying, ‘Hey. Can you invest in Willets Point, where those who will help achieve your [goals] will be in the area,’” said Hsu. “By matching our goals to the universities’, we want to encourage them to come to Queens.”
The Coalition for Queens insists that Willets and Queens hold a number of advantages over the other potential sites. “We’re trying to build a place where we can grow a lot of companies out of, but if you look at the other sites, they’re kind of small and limited,” said Hsu.
Jack Chen, who is working with Hsu in the Coalition for Queens, also said, “If you look at the other sites, Roosevelt Island is basically owned by the state rather than the city, and is pitifully small and isolated.... The Brooklyn Navy Yard recently announced other conflicting development projects, and will probably be affected by the new Nets stadium. Governor’s Island is a primarily tourist site accessible only by ferry.”
Chen also added, “Queens has everything: space to grow, a motivated and hungry community that's a hotbed of young talent, enormous connections to foreign investment, abundant space for infrastructure, and established transportation is a major subway line, the Long Island Railroad, an airport, and dozens of bus lines.”
And although McCullough seemed to downplay the notion of an actual campus in New York, Hsu still believes that a facility will still benefit students at Carnegie Mellon. “A research facility is the next best thing to a campus.... I’m not sure what the university’s interests are, but I think that having a Carnegie Mellon facility in New York could open opportunities in finance, acting, and more,” he said.

The University Center’s Kirr Commons was filled with food, music, and performances last Friday thanks to the multicultural Late Night event, which promoted the various cultural clubs at Carnegie Mellon. The event was hosted by the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs and was sponsored in part by Student Activities.
Representatives from many of Carnegie Mellon’s multicultural organizations set up info booths throughout the University Center, each offering fliers and food. The event’s administrative staff also provided food from both Chipotle and Chopstix. 
Some student organizations, such as the Ballroom Dance Club, Bhangra, and the Awareness of Roots in Chinese Culture Club (ARCC) also held performances for the students. Clubs promoted themselves by either running an info booth, putting on a performance, or organizing a presentation — sometimes a combination of the three. 
“It’s a great way for people to get a sense of what Carnegie Mellon has to offer in terms of culture and diversity,” said Jackson Chu, junior design major and the vice president of the Taiwanese Student Association. “I think it’s a great event for people to meet each other and get to know each other, and it’s also great in the sense that you can probably find a group that you’re related to.”
Maya Geleroff, a sophomore majoring in  economics, agreed. “It’s always really nice to see all the organizations that are participating,” she said.
Chu found the multicultural Late Night to be a great promotional event, espeically for smaller student organizations. He explained, however, “Tonight we’re not really asking them whether or not they’d like to join, we’d rather give them a sense of the people  — who we are, what it’s like to be part of this TSA [Taiwanese Student Association] family.”
Geleroff is a member of the Society for Hispanic and Professional Engineers which, in addition to holding a traditional informational booth, offered salsa dancing lessons during the fair. “There are very few Latin kids on campus and we’d like to make ourselves heard and share all the lovely things about our culture, as well as participate in everyone else’s culture,” Geleroff said. “We just kind of want to showcase our culture. We made some traditional food, we have salsa music and dancing, and it’s just a good time all around.”
The multicultural event is similar to the activities fair, but meant to be more personable. “[We want to] actually have a Late Night event where we have more people come out and just to get to know each other and to have fun, not just to have an activities fair where people just sign their names,” Chan said.
The target audience for this event was first-years. “Freshmen are usually the biggest attraction,” Chan said. “They’re the new ones. They’re the ones that are trying to find an organization that they want to be part of.”
Jocelyn Kong, junior H&SS student and the public relations head for ARCC, agrees. “We’re trying to target freshmen because they have a different mindset, a different outlook. And just to keep the club going, we need to be able to recruit freshmen,” she said.
Even people who are not part of the multicultural clubs found it to be a fun experience. First-year design major Liana Kong said, “It’s really fun and it’s a nice place to experience all the different cultures of the school through food.”

Carnegie Mellon’s department of Campus Design and Facility Development began working last May — alongside Perfido Weiskopf Wagstaff and Goettel Architects — to restore the façade of Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall.
During the second week of August, crews began the first phase of the construction: relocating the Children’s School playground to Donner Ditch. Construction has been ongoing since.
Jendoco Construction initiated the second phase of the project last Tuesday by erecting scaffolding on the west façade of Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall. According to the construction crew, erecting the scaffolding is expected to take two to three weeks. Once the installation is completed, the main work to restore the exterior of the building can officially begin. Each phase of the project relies on completion of the other; the overall restoration is expected to take 12 to 18 months, according to Campus Design.
Campus Design stated that the primary reason for undertaking the restoration project was previous water seepage behind the building’s bricks that caused damage to the masonry. Campus Design and Facility Development staff also planned to reconstruct the third-floor balustrade by installing a through-wall to protect it from future water damage.
According to its website, Campus Design and Facility Development “plan[s] to replace current hot water risers for perimeter heat, as well as install separate hot and chilled water risers for future HVAC capabilities. In order to accommodate the work site, the Children’s School located in [Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall] will temporarily relocate their playground to Donner Dell.”
Brennen Garrison, a graduate student in the School of Architecture, has been an intern for the campus design department since June. He has been highly involved with the Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall restoration, including the Children’s School playground relocation. 
“This location was selected in coordination with the senior leadership at the Children’s School and with the Office of Student Affairs,” Garrison said in an email. “It provides for the children the safest and most suitable site proximate to the school.” Months of planning went into designing and relocating the playground. The project team has been working on it since the end of last semester.
The children’s safety was a concern in the relocation and re-design of the playground. Donner Ditch is a more open space than the previous location next to the tennis courts; because many student groups use Donner Ditch as an area for their events, Campus Design made safety a priority. 
“As usual the children will be monitored by multiple teachers and aides when they are on the playground,” Garrison further explained. “When the playground is finished, there will be a fence surrounding it with limited gate access to keep intruders out. On the outside of the fence there will be grasses planted to help screen the sight of the fence and to keep people from coming directly up to the fence. The fence and grasses will help separate the playground from the remainder of Donner [Ditch].”
Campus Design and Facility Development’s website keeps a blog of the project, containing construction and restoration updates.

2011 Pittsburgh Biennial to take place in Miller Gallery
The 2011 Pittsburgh Biennial began Sept. 16 and will remain open until Dec. 11 at Carnegie Mellon’s Miller Gallery. This art exhibition has been showcased since 1994 and is co-hosted by the Andy Warhol Museum, the Carnegie Museum of Art, The Miller Gallery, and the Pittsburgh Filmmakers/Pittsburgh Center for the Arts (PF/PCA).
This year, the theme will be innovative works in which artists and organizations around Pittsburgh contribute their ideas in order to improve the final product.
“This unique collaboration among these organizations builds on the open exchange of ideas as well as the collaborative atmosphere PF/PCA cultivates,” said Laura Domencic, director of the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts. “These organizations have stepped outside of their regular programming to focus on the creative energy of Pittsburgh artists. They bring their valuable perspectives and resources, as well as a heightened recognition of our region’s most compelling visual artists.”
The exhibition is expected to include sculptures, printmaking, paintings, video, publications, and workshops. Aside from the showcase of various works, there are multiple free events offered, including a workshop titled “From Waste to Reuse” on Nov. 16 at the Miller Gallery beginning at 5 p.m.

Over the past week, most news coverage has been focused on the beginning of two seasons: election season and football season. This became an issue when President Obama scheduled his job creation speech on the evening of Sept. 8, just before the first game of the new NFL season. With Americans having to choose between two pastimes, here are some quick facts on politics and football:
31.4 million: number of viewers watching Obama’s job forecast speech
27.2 million: number of viewers watching the NFL kickoff game between the Saints and Packers
$300 billion: proposed government spending on job creation
57: the average number of minutes people who have jobs and play fantasy football spend playing the game during the work week

The Carnegie Mellon administration announced this week that it will continue its international expansion by starting a Master of Science in Information Technology (MSIT) program in Rwanda. However, we are concerned that the university is spreading itself too thin and will be unable to provide the same caliber of education when it expands to Rwanda. Additionally, we are unsure if the investment of resources, time, and personnel will be well spent starting a program that might not last more than 10 years, depending on the economic and political factors that inevitably come with building a program in a country like Rwanda. 
There are also political and ethical issues to take into account when considering a partnership with President Paul Kagame’s Rwanda. Carnegie Mellon’s desire to associate itself with a country where human rights violations are common, and freedom of speech is far from universal, is off-putting. The majority of news and media is tightly controlled by the government. According to the World Report, two independent newspapers were suspended as recently as 2010 prior to the Rwandan presidential election and two journalists from the newspaper Umurabyo were arrested and given sentences of seven to 17 years in prison. 
Universities are supposed to be areas of open discussion and debate; will Carnegie Mellon’s Rwanda program have the same intellectual freedom as we do here? Can a president who imprisons or kills journalists be trusted to allow the dissent that a university requires to flourish?
We cannot say, however, that because Rwanda has human rights issues, its people do not deserve to be educated. The Rwandan people — as well as students from nearby countries — deserve access to advanced technical degrees. The classes and skills proposed in the Rwanda program would indeed help younger generations of Africans build technical competencies that would benefit their continent and aid in global-market competition. Carnegie Mellon’s presence in Rwanda may also persuade other universities to install similarly backed programs in sub-Saharan Africa. But the effectiveness of these programs might be limited by the students that are accepted; if the price of tuition is the same as it is here and at the Qatar campus (around $45,000 a year according to the admissions website), only a select group of wealthier Rwandans will be able to afford to go to Carnegie Mellon’s Rwanda program.
The student body needs to be informed and consulted well in advance on such momentous ventures as a Carnegie Mellon-Rwanda program. It isn’t that we are wholly against starting a program in Rwanda, but as of now we do not have the full picture: Questions need to be answered by the administration and campus-wide discussions need to take place. Student groups such as Amnesty International, ALLIES, International Justice Mission, International Relations Organization, CMU Politics, and Young African Leaders Alliance should all be interested and want to have a voice in the university’s possible partnership with Rwanda’s government. There are questions yet to be answered by the administration as we boldly launch programs on yet another continent.
Editorial Dissent
Meela Dudley
The Carnegie Mellon administration has made information regarding advancements in Rwanda easily accessible to those who sought it out. Similarly, I firmly believe that Carnegie Mellon’s global initiative is something to be celebrated, especially since the school is permanently establishing itself as the first major university to build a program not only in Rwanda, but in Africa as a whole. I agree that it is the administration’s responsibility to inform students of its decision, especially major and controversial decisions like this one; however, opinions regarding the stability of Rwanda are split just like the opinions of The Tartan’s Editorial Board members. 
Furthermore, while the board may still be weighing pros and cons, I have faith that Carnegie Mellon’s Rwanda campus will greatly aid the country in its reparative state. Graduates from our master’s program in Rwanda will be the individuals who continually enhance the local economy, run government facilities, and advance national technology. Personally, I applaud President Cohon and the administration for following through with such a momentous commitment and for evaluating external criticism, but remaining firm.

I am afraid of several things in modern American society — global warming, the national deficit — but nothing scares me more than the prospect that a political representative from the hyper-conservative Tea Party could quite possibly be elected into the presidential office within my lifetime. That being said, watching the CNN/Tea Party GOP Presidential Debate on Sept. 12 was like watching a seemingly endless compilation of every horror movie George Romero has ever directed, while standing in the middle of the Demilitarized Zone that divides the North and South Korea — horrifying.
The eight candidates at the the CNN/Tea Party GOP Presidential Debate, hosted by CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, touched on all of the important topics during the broadcast. 
Topics of discussion within the two-hour debate included taxes, 9/11, oil dependency, taxes, healthcare reform, taxes, taxes, the HPV vaccine, taxes, and more.
The most popular topic, if you couldn’t guess, happened to be taxes. Each candidate proposed drastic tax cuts, and yet all of them expressed intentions to reduce the deficit. The candidates’ methods of reducing said national deficit, however, were almost always absurd or unspoken. For example, former Georgia congressman and Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich stated that there is enough waste and swindling in government to balance our national budget without actually cutting any of the funding that finds its way to legitimate beneficiaries.
Former United States Ambassador to China Jon Huntsman also proposed a plan when it came to leading economic growth. “This country needs to wean itself from its heroin-like addiction to foreign oil,” said Huntsman. However, Huntsman later admitted to opposing the taxing of the consumption of oil, a measure that would in fact work to wean our dependence off foreign oil. Increasing domestic production, an idea that nearly all Republicans favor (including Huntsman), simply won’t succeed, because the U.S. doesn’t have enough oil within its territory to appease consumption rates. The majority of candidates danced around their deficit relief plans, leaving me with the impression that these candidates would either drastically increase the national deficit or propose devastating spending cuts they were obviously too afraid to mention in their campaigns. 
During the debates, each candidate was asked what he or she would do about the 45 million uninsured Americans, to which the group replied with a call for the end of Obamacare and the creation of “health savings accounts.” Texas Congressman Ron Paul — commonly referred to by media outlets as the original “godfather” of the Tea Party — attracted a lot of media attention when he argued that a healthy uninsured man who experiences a medical catastrophe should “assume responsibility” for his lack of coverage, insinuating that uninsured Americans should die for their insurance faux pas.
Following this statement, Paul then argued that churches would rescue the uninsured.
Perhaps the scariest moment of Paul’s statement was when the crowd cheered. As Chicago Sun-Times writer Richard Roeper asked in his Sept. 13 article, “politics aside, what kind of person cheers death?” Writer David Dayen of the FDL Newsdesk concluded his analysis of the Tea Party’s take on insurance with the following advice: “don’t get sick, and if you do get sick, die quickly.” While the Tea Party constituency is known for supporting limited government and personal responsibility, CBS’ Robert Hendren points out that it was in fact the president most adored by Tea Party members who signed the COBRA Act of 1986, which helped lead to the institutionalization of health care costs. “A healthy young American who doesn’t have health insurance suddenly needs emergency care,” said Hendren. “Federal law requires that that care is paid for. That law was passed in 1986, which means it was signed into law not by Mr. Obama or even Bill Clinton, but by Ronald Reagan.”
The biggest applause of the evening came from Gingrich’s statement referring to President Obama and his healthcare reform as “scary for the American people.” 
Both former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum and Texas Governor Rick Perry called for healthcare reform; however, they refused to say whether or not they would undo the Medicare prescription drug benefit enacted under President George W. Bush, a massive benefit that Santorum voted for while in office.
The House of Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, a woman that I would normally regard as the Al Capone of the Tea Party mafia and possibly my least favorite person in the world, withheld her usual Palin-esque anti-gay slander to deal a low blow to Rick Perry, pointing out that a certain drug company made millions of dollars off of a 2007 mandate which required Texas schoolgirls to receive HPV vaccinations.
After the broadcast ended, most media outlets searched for a ‘winner.’ Personally, I think they’re all losers, but if I had to pick one I guess I’d have to agree with Andrew Sullivan, a columnist for The Daily Beast. “Clearly the crowd loved Perry the most,” Sullivan wrote. “God help us.”

In a generation where education is a lucrative game of cutthroat competition, choosing the right university was probably the biggest commitment that this class’s first-years ever had to make. For the class of 2015, this past May was a month that revolved around numbers: tuition prices, class sizes, graduation rates, student to faculty ratios, and gigantic cities versus small campuses.
And then there is the number that every first-year researched relentlessly, although most would deny basing their decision off of it: university rankings. _U.S News & World Report _released its Guide to Best Colleges this past Tuesday. To save you from a frantic Google search, I already checked: Carnegie Mellon is listed as the 23rd highest-ranked national university. 
University deans and presidents tend to condemn such rankings, and they should: each and every applicant does not fit into a single collegiate mold. As writer of the Fiske Guide to Colleges, 2012, Edward Fiske, said in a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette article, “the question is not, ‘What’s the best college?’ The question is, ‘What’s the best college for me?’” MIT is purported to be the fifth-best college in the nation, but an aspiring painter would receive a more accessible education at a smaller, less intense liberal arts school probably ranked at a number much greater than five. Reputation is not the way to scale an education.
College applicants are completely aware of how much numbers matter, and they should understand why this one doesn’t. They should know better than to sway their decision because of a single ranking, yet it is difficult to simply ignore a respected publication like the U.S. News & World Report. Rankings are every college applicant’s guilty pleasure. Most people pause when asked to name the first five presidents in order, but many incoming college students can recite the top five schools in the nation without hesitation. 
College ranking is petty; an education is what a student makes of it. The allure of ranks, like so much else in the world, comes from reputation and pride. It’s about feeding one’s ego when a student compares him or herself to the rest of college-bound America and realizes, “I’m ranked 23rd best in the country. That’s pretty impressive.” As awesome as it is to receive an education at one of the top twenty-five schools in the country, that rank doesn’t count for anything other than personal satisfaction. Rankings should be the last number considered by college-bound students applying to universities. But if students absolutely have to choose from one ranker, use U.S. News & World Report’s. Forbes has us at number 98; they have no idea what they’re talking about.

In 2003, a white Michigan resident with a 3.8 GPA by the name of Grutter was denied entrance into the University of Michigan Law School. 
She filed suit against the school on the basis that she had been denied due to her race. The ensuing landmark case of Grutter v. Bollinger failed to work in her favor and instead solidified the acceptance of using affirmative action in college admissions.
After the case, Carnegie Mellon released a statement maintaining that “the Court’s reasoning, which we share, is that diversity is a legitimate institutional goal.” With 49 percent of its student body listed as a racial minority on its admission page, Carnegie Mellon seems to have accomplished that goal. However, because of the social gains America has achieved in the past few decades, some of us may forget the original intent of affirmative action — to aid minority groups who previously suffered from economic disadvantages due to pre-existing racist institutions. In this aspect, affirmative action has come up short.
Affirmative action is a respectable idea in theory, but in practice it fails to effectively accomplish its objective of providing access to higher education for historically disenfranchised minorities. Statistically, the acceptance rates of minority groups have indeed improved. According to Jamillah Moore, president of Los Angeles City College, and the Harvard University “Fact Book,” UC San Diego admitted 32 percent more underrepresented students and Harvard admitted 7 percent more minority students after the implementation of affirmative action. However, these numbers are actually misleading because, as stated by Michigan State professor Peter Schmidt, “many of the students who gain admission to college through affirmative action are the children of either well-to-do professionals or well-educated recent immigrants.”
The problem primarily revolves around the fact that many minority students graduate from secondary schools without adequate skills to survive higher education. A more comprehensive solution would be to focus on economic policies that would first provide minority students with the means to attend better secondary schools so that they can then compete for a spot in an elite university. Programs such as Prep for Prep, a free New York education program for gifted students, are outstanding examples of such possibilities. Teaching students as early as fifth grade, Prep for Prep partners with various independent secondary schools to provide young students with the financial aid they need to attend high schools that were previously unaffordable. 
Besides having a 14-month-long preparation program for students applying to independent high schools, Prep for Prep provides its students with college guidance, mentoring, and counseling. For future boarding school students, Prep for Prep even offers two summer camps at a boarding school to help their students familiarize themselves with the aspects of boarding life. What is really amazing about Prep for Prep, then, is that they not only prepare their students for the academics of college — currently, 92 percent of Prep for Prep alumni have earned degrees in outstanding universities, with 40 percent of Prep for Prep alumni graduating from Ivy League universities — but also for other facets of college life.
The only problem with Prep for Prep is simply that it does not offer this program to more students. Out of the 6,000 qualified students that apply, they only take 225. Interestingly enough, in 2000 Prep for Prep — along with the Goldman Sachs Foundation — initiated a program called New York Metro Region Leadership Academy (NYMRLA), where young students would be prepared for accelerated classes in high school through academic training courses. The program was shut down due to a lack of funding. Looking at the success that Prep for Prep has enjoyed, I do not know why there are not more of these programs around or why programs like NYMRLA do not get more funding. Maybe it’s because it is easier to simply increase minority enrollment in various universities than it is to create programs that would tackle the entrenched socioeconomic problems prevalent in cities. Or maybe it’s simply because people believe affirmative action is working and in the near future, it will no longer be needed. 
In any case, affirmative action promises to provide equal opportunities, but fails to keep that promise.

As we enter the fourth week of this school year, I notice students beginning to settle down into a regular schedule. First-years are starting to feel truly comfortable in their residences, finalizing furniture placement, hanging posters, and organizing essentials to their hearts’ content. 
I wonder, do they realize that these homes they have carefully constructed must be abandoned in a matter of months? When I was a first-year, I lived as far away from campus as one could get while still living in campus housing: Shirley Apartments at Fifth and Dithridge. Initially, I detested the distance, longing for that typical dorm life I kept hearing about. Every time I told another first-year where I lived, they would astonishedly inquire what it was like to trudge 15 minutes to and from class every day. 
True, I had to walk a ways to get to school. And yes, during the 2010 “snowpocalypse” it was sheer willpower that pulled me up out of bed, out into the icy, windy, hellish gauntlet that was Forbes Avenue, and onward to class. 
Even with these minor annoyances, I would not have traded anything to live on campus.
Oakland is a college town, and as such there are a multiplicity of cheap, semi-dumpy to semi-nice apartments. I guess what you should ask yourself is, “would I rather sleep in a crowded cubicle-like bedroom where I am awakened by the gentle inhale and exhale of my sleeping roommate, or would I rather live in a spacious apartment with my own kitchen and toilet?” After first-years finish their obligatory one-year stint in a dorm, it would behoove them to look into off-campus options. Especially with the way Carnegie Mellon’s room selection is operated, sophomores have the highest chances of getting the one dorm room they didn’t want, or worse — not getting any room at all. Why stress about on-campus housing when you can find comparable and often cheaper prices only minutes away from the university? I chose to find an off-campus apartment my sophomore year and have loved it from the beginning.
Living off-campus has helped me become more independent and self-sufficient, and has given me a more intimate knowledge of Pittsburgh. I learned shortcuts faster, found the best places to eat, and went to free concerts and events. In addition, having an apartment off campus means you are now responsible for everything: the rent check, the utilities, buying toilet paper, cooking meals, and cleaning up. Everything your mother or RA did for you is now your duty. For some, such independence may be a tough transition, but when your apartment is decorated just the way you’ve always wanted, you start branching out from cooking strictly Ramen noodles, and are intimately familiar with the workings of your extremely volatile toilet, you can proudly exclaim, “I’m a real person now!”
I suppose what I’m trying to say is that college is a time for exploration, discovery, and new experiences. It is a fact that you will experience more of the culture of Pittsburgh in general by being out on your own — living off-campus is a great start. As you finish unpacking your clothes and arranging your knick-knacks for the umpteenth time, consider expanding your comfort zone: 15 minutes away there is a whole new world awaiting discovery.

Students have already felt the pinch of increasing debt. In 2010, graduates who took out student loans to cover the cost of their educations left school with an average of $24,000 in debt. Overall student debt, at $3 billion, surpassed the nation’s credit card debt for the first time — a statistic that is, quite frankly, horrifying. Simultaneously, figures released last week by the Department of Education show that 8.8 percent of students whose loans entered repayment in fiscal year 2009 had defaulted on those loans by the end of fiscal year 2010, a sharp increase from the 7.0 percent default rate recorded the year before.
In the current climate of cutbacks, universities themselves are becoming more polarized between the financial haves and the have-nots. According to a New York Times article, state and local appropriations to public research universities were cut by an average of $751 per student between 2008 and 2009, amounting to tuition increases of $369 per student. At public community colleges, education-related spending didn’t rise for a decade. Private research universities, in contrast, spend three and a half times as much money on education-related spending per student and have increased that figure over the past 10 years.
The reality behind these figures cannot be ignored. As the price of a much-needed college education continues to increase faster than inflation or household income, low- and middle-income students are increasingly coming up short when it comes to paying the bills. They are also getting progressively less help from affordable public universities and community colleges as those institutions feel the squeeze themselves.
It is up to students and administrators alike — from all backgrounds — to unify and express their concerns persuasively to local, state, and federal governments. Amid this year’s Congressional mania for spending cuts, subsidized Stafford Loans for graduate students were entirely cut in last month’s Budget Control Act, and the House of Representatives passed a bill in February that would have cut the Pell Grant program by $5.7 billion. 
If we care about the future education, we must make it known that we care and will defend and advocate legislation that enables affordable college tuition.

You may really want that job, but hanging onto the recruiter’s leg and begging will probably not improve your chances of employment.
Your resume is so padded, I could use it as a pillow.
Watch out for others trying to sabotage your chances at the BOC. The business world is ruthless, and those desperate to get noticed will undercut anyone just to get ahead.
Make sure that you wear a bib at lunch while in your dress clothes. The last thing you want to do is to have to accessorize around the pizza sauce stain.
Your resume is quite interesting and full of Carnegie Mellon-centered activities. Make sure to take the time to explain to recruiters that your membership in the KGB or CIA is nothing to worry about.
Karma is a five letter word, so think twice before you cut that guy in line just to get to the free stuff companies are giving out. 
It is all well and good that you have gotten your elevator pitch down to perfection, but stop creeping everyone out by giving said elevator pitch every time you’re in an elevator.
Crowds freak you out, and the whole idea of Career Week scares the Wean out you. Be brave and hold your head high and everything will be okay.
This whole “finding a job” thing is not your scene. You’re not going to any of the job fairs because you like to go with the flow and let life happen as it’s meant to.
Oh, they’re going remember your name. In fact, they’ll never forget it.
Don’t take it personally if, after shaking someone’s hand this week, they instantly reach for the Purell. Job fairs bring out the germaphobe in the best of us.
I know you really want a job, but please, don’t wear that to the career fairs.
