Women’s Soccer
The seventh-ranked Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team took on Washington University in St. Louis on Saturday at home in the NCAA Division III playoffs Round of 16. 
In the first half, Carnegie Mellon dominated on shots, recording seven compared to WashU’s one. However, all on-mark shots were saved on both sides, leaving the scoreboard empty at the half. 
In the first two minutes of the second half, senior Alex Adams was tripped in the box, giving the Tartans a penalty kick that sophomore Gemma Jefferson converted. This put the Tartans up 1-0 early in the second half.
The Bears were ready to rally back, though. In the 66th minute, a WashU player was able to slip one in unassisted, tying the game. Three minutes later, the Bears snuck another one in the net, giving them the lead over the Tartans.
Despite a close shot that hit the crossbar in the 79th minute from Adams, the Tartans did not to score again. This 2-1 loss ended the Tartans season with a 14-3-2 record.
Football
The stands were packed in Gesling Stadium as the 19th-ranked Carnegie Mellon football team opened their NCAA Division III playoff run this past Saturday, Nov. 19 when they took on DePauw University at home. 
Play started out a bit rough for the Tartans. After a fumble on the opening kickoff that DePauw recovered, the Tigers were able to get on the board early. A 14-yard touchdown pass made it 7-0 DePauw less than three minutes into the game.
DePauw wouldn’t hold the lead for long, though. An 11-play, 75 yard drive gave the Tartans a touchdown thanks to a four-yard pass from junior Ben Mills to senior Kris Hughes. This tied the game with 5:21 left in the first quarter.
The Tartans were able to make up for their earlier fumble on the ensuing kickoff; senior Aryan Hegde forced a DePauw fumble, which gave the Tartans the ball on the DePauw 26. This led to a four-yard rush touchdown from junior Tre Vasiliadis and a 14-7 Tartan lead.
Carnegie Mellon continued their momentum into the second quarter. A 14-yard catch-and-run from Mills to junior Ethan Reifer gave the Tartans another touchdown; this was also repeated on the next Tartan drive, giving Carnegie Mellon a 28-7 lead over DePauw going into halftime.  
Coming into the second half, the Tigers attempted a comeback, albeit rather poorly. The only score in the third quarter was DePauw’s touchdown on their opening drive. 
The fourth quarter was all Tartans, though; a 54-yard run from Vasiliadis with 12:45 left on the clock gave the Tartans a 35-14 lead. Carnegie Mellon continued to push their advantage; on DePauw’s next drive, sophomore Nolan Pitsenberger recorded a pick six following a 45-yard return.
Before time expired, graduate Cole Hanna put one through the posts to widen the Tartan lead and give them a 45-14 victory. 
This is the Tartan’s 18th win in a row, the longest active in the NCAA across all divisions. The 11 wins this season also ties the 2006 school record for most wins in a single season. The Tartans will be on the road next week for the second round of NCAA Division III playoffs when they take on top-ranked North Central College on Nov. 26 at 12:00 p.m.
Men’s Basketball
The Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team traveled to Walsh University on Tuesday, Nov. 15 for an exhibition match against the Division II opponent. Despite the Tartans pulling ahead slightly with a 15-14 lead halfway through the first half, the Cavaliers would command a strong lead for the rest of the half. As the first half came to a close, the board read 37-22 in favor of the Cavaliers. The Tartans were only able to match Walsh in the second half, with both teams scoring 40 points. But thanks to Walsh’s hefty lead in the first half, the Tartans lost 77-62. 
On Saturday, the team traveled to Denison University for their third game of the season. The Tartans had a slow start; after the first half of play, the Big Red had a controlling 50-35 lead. However, midway through the second half, a series of Tartan scores put them just one point behind with just over four minutes left in play, 72-71. A two-pointer from junior Jack Stone with 1:47 left gave the Tartans the lead, 75-74.
With two seconds left on the clock and Carnegie Mellon leading, a Dension two-pointer sent the game into overtime. Despite the Big Red pulling out early with an 86-79 lead, the Tartans managed to come back and tie the game yet again with 10 seconds left on the clock. This sent the game into double overtime, where the Tartans took an early lead and didn’t look back. Carnegie Mellon took home the win, 98-90, and advanced them a 3-0 record.
The men’s basketball team continues their road campaign on Tuesday when they travel to Oberlin University for 7:00 p.m. tipoff. 
Women’s Basketball
The women’s basketball team was supposed to take on Geneva College this past Tuesday, Nov. 15, but the game has been postponed. However, the team still took to the road on Thursday to take on Grove City College. Despite trailing the Wolverines 13-11 in the first quarter, the Tartans started their domination in the second quarter. Outscoring Grove City 16-9 in the second quarter, Carnegie Mellon had a modest lead at the end of the first half, 27-22.
The Tartans continued to dominate the rest of the game, scoring 16 in the third quarter and 13 in the fourth, compared to Grove City’s seven and five points in the third and fourth quarters, respectively. The women’s efforts helped them overcome the Wolverines 56-34.
The team traveled to University of Pittsburgh Greensburg on Saturday to take on the Bobcats. The Tartans displayed their dominance early, scoring 27 in the first quarter compared to Pitt Greensburg’s 15. Sophomore Anisha Chintala played a large role in the second quarter, earning eight of the 15 Tartan points. The Tartans led 42-24 going into the half.
In the third quarter, Carnegie Mellon once again dominated the scoreboard, shooting 11 for 14 and scoring 27 points to 10 from the Bobcats. Another 12 in the fourth quarter sealed the Tartan victory, 81-43. The team is still undefeated this season and is currently 5-0.
The women’s team will have a 10-day break and will be returning to action when they travel to La Roche University on Tuesday, Nov. 29 for a 7:00 p.m. tipoff.

Advanced analytics are killing the poetry and romance in baseball. Everything is now distilled, quantified, and commodified.
And no, I am not anti-data. I want to make that very clear, so I avoid being cast as a casual fan and baseball heretic.
But I do believe that, like many revolutions that began in the name of progress, the proliferation of advanced analytics has gone too far. It is hurting the beautiful game of baseball. There is a time for data, but experience has its own place, too. There is a place for multiple perspectives. A lot of fans agree that they are feeling a bit apprehensive about the direction baseball is taking nearly 20 years after Michael Lewis’s revolutionary book "Moneyball" came out.
In recent years, when the topic of famous advanced analytics-induced managerial gaffes are brought up, the Tampa Bay Rays come to mind for most. For context, Tampa Bay was down 3-2 in the World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Game 6 was do or die, so Tampa Bay had their Cy Young-winning ace Blake Snell on the bump. Snell was shoving. Through 5 ⅓ innings, he had given up two hits and struck out nine batters while only throwing 73 pitches. In other words, Snell was dominant and efficient.
Yet, when he gave up his second hit of the ballgame, Tampa Bay manager Kevin Cash pulled Snell much to the chagrin of the baseball world. Cash’s reasoning was that Snell was going to face the three best batters in Los Angeles’s order, so the analytics suggested to pull him. Yet, Snell had struck out each of those three batters — twice. Yes, Tampa Bay was already down in the series, but this move effectively sealed their fate. Snell was replaced by relief pitcher Nick Anderson, who immediately coughed up a double to Mookie Betts, a wild pitch, and a fielder’s choice, giving Los Angeles a 2-1 lead that they would never surrender. One could say that Tampa Bay’s computers were the MVP for Los Angeles.
The argument against this is that Tampa Bay's use of an advanced analytical strategy was what ultimately brought them to the World Series. So, where is the line in the sand with analytics? I would be a complete nimrod to make the case against analytics entirely. It works for Tampa Bay (usually). It is valuable to a point.
In baseball, I believe human discretion is often overlooked in favor of an unduly strict adherence to mathematics. You need to have faith in human abilities. This is emphasized even more in the postseason. The playoffs are a different animal, and analytics typically go out the window. Having a feel for the game is what elevates teams, not a computer.
The pre-Moneyball era of baseball is criticized by big stat-heads as being ignorant and antiquated. However, by doing so, it seems to me that we are swapping one form of ignorance for another.
At times, using imagination is a better alternative than statistical knowledge. Because knowledge is limited. So if a team has that really creative and innovative person managing during the game and constructing the roster, they therein have a competitive advantage.
Every team is using analytics; everyone has hopped on the bandwagon. There is a cap on what can be discerned by data, and there will always be silly new statistics created, like VORP, LIPS, and PECOTA, to name a few. In the end, every team is still using the same models and figures.
We are in the analytics era. Yes, there are things we can derive from them, but it is time to backpedal a little because the right person is the advantage in baseball.

Buggy is a Carnegie Mellon tradition which has existed since 1920. The sport, practiced throughout the academic year, culminates in an annual series of relay races held on each year’s Raceday during Spring Carnival, in which teams vie for the title of “Champion.” The Buggy Rolls Report column reports on the buggies and roll counts for all of the teams which attend the freeroll practices (“rolls”) each weekend organized by the Carnegie Mellon Sweepstakes Committee. All of the information reported in the column is provided by the Carnegie Mellon Sweepstakes Committee.
There were no rolls last weekend, due to extreme cold. With no rolls Thanksgiving weekend and the cold weather likely spelling cancellations for any potential days of rolls afterwards, it may be the case that fall rolls have concluded. Let us take a look, then, at the cumulative roll counts for this semester.
SPIRIT has rolled four buggies this semester: Kingpin II, Seraph, Mapambazuko (Zuke), and Inviscid. Kingpin II got 22 rolls in, Seraph got 29 rolls in, split between two drivers, Zuke got 15 rolls in, and Inviscid got 21 rolls in.
SigNu (Sigma Nu) has rolled one buggy this semester, Jager, which got six rolls in.
PiKA (Pi Kappa Alpha) has rolled three buggies this semester: Cleo, Banshee, and Raptor. Cleo got two rolls in, Banshee got 20 rolls in, and Raptor got 22 rolls in, split between three drivers.
Fringe has rolled three buggies this semester: Bumper, Burnout, and Blind Faith. Bumper got one roll in, Burnout got 15 rolls in, and Blind Faith got 11 rolls in, split between two drivers.
CIA (The Carnegie Involvement Association) has rolled five buggies this semester: Roadrunner, Tempest, Emperor, Kingfisher, and Equinox. Roadrunner got 23 rolls in, split between three drivers, Tempest and Emperor both got 15 rolls in, Kingfisher got 33 rolls in, split between three drivers, and Equinox got 10 rolls in.
SAE (Sigma Alpha Epsilon) has rolled one buggy this semester, Eileen, which got two rolls in.
Apex has rolled four buggies this semester: Molotov, Phoenix, Firefly, and Solaris. Molotov got 22 rolls in, split between two drivers, Phoenix got 23 rolls in, split between two drivers, Firefly got nine rolls in, and Solaris got 12 rolls in.
SigEp (Sigma Phi Epsilon) has rolled two buggies this semester: Kraken and Barracuda. Kraken got 18 rolls in and Barracuda got 12 rolls in.
SDC (The Carnegie Mellon Student Dormitory Council) has rolled three buggies this semester: Vanity, Avarice, and Inferno. Vanity got five rolls in, Avarice got 17 rolls in, and Inferno got 20 rolls in.
In total, across all teams and across all days, 400 rolls have been recorded this semester.

On Friday, Nov. 18, “Pokémon Scarlet” and “Pokémon Violet” made their debut on Nintendo Switch. Developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company, reviews of Gen IX of the series has been generally favorable, though many fans criticize certain aspects of the game. The games currently have a score of 77 on review aggregator Metacritic, based on 44 critic reviews. The last Pokémon game to score this low was Pokémon Emerald in 2005, which has a score of 76 on Metacritic. 
“Scarlet” and “Violet” are the first open-world mainline games in the Pokémon franchise, and many reviews say that this as a step in the right direction for the series. However, many  reviews cite problems with graphics and overall performance on the Nintendo Switch. 
Centro Pokémon, a Twitter account known for leaking details about Pokémon games before their release, noted that many of the performance issues may be due to a memory leak, and resetting the game tends to increase performance. A memory leak is when a program does not release memory when it is no longer needed. This reduces the performance of the console; in this case, the graphics and performance of the game are heavily affected. 
Some social media users have shared problems they encountered. Twitter user @Cherrim shared a video of them catching a Psyduck in which the frame rate greatly stutters and some of the background elements pop in and out of existence. A Reddit user shared a video in r/pokemon that had similar problems with the title “This is unacceptable.”
Another video on the r/pokemon subreddit showed a multiplayer problem in “Scarlet” and “Violet”: Another player’s model on the poster’s screen suddenly elongates into grotesque-looking nightmare fuel. Safe to say they didn’t find that one during bug testing. 
Another point of controversy that has been following Pokémon for the last few years is “Dexit.” With the release of “Scarlet” and “Violet,” there is now a total of 1,010 unique Pokémon species. Generation XI introduced 105 new Pokémon, the most since Generation V in 2010. However, these games only feature the ability to collect 400 of the 1,010 total Pokémon. This was similar to “Pokémon Sword” and “Pokémon Shield,” who only featured 400 Pokémon at launch as well.
On the official Pokémon website, players can provide feedback on the company’s recent releases. Many players have submitted tickets to voice their dissatisfaction with these games. 
Despite the problems present at the games’ launch, “Scarlet” and “Violet” have had the highest pre-orders in the series’ history according to Japanese news outlet Oricon. The outlet reported that the games should take a first-time Pokémon player about 60 hours to finish the game, while it may take a returning player about 30 to 40 hours. 
Unlike previous games in the franchise, “Pokémon Scarlet” and “Pokémon Violet” present three different stories for the player to complete in any order they would like. Additionally, the gym challenge is open-ended, meaning players can complete the gyms in any order they prefer, which differs from the fairly linear progression of previous entries. 
At this point, it’s fairly hard for Game Freak to make any excuses about how poor some of their recent “Pokémon” exploits have been. To me, Generation VII was the start of the end (though I may have a bit too much nostalgia for Generation VI, so many others will say that was the start of the end.) “Pokémon Sun” and “Pokémon Moon” lacked good animations and had poor resolution (though it was fairly limited by hardware). “Sword” and “Shield” felt lazy at times and lacking at others. “Scarlet” and “Violet” are just another disappointment in the recent mainline “Pokémon” series. It is seriously time for Game Freak to step up their game and focus on delivering a game that is actually solid, not just mediocre.
As a side note, if you are interested in “shiny hunting” (the term for specifically seeking a rare coloration of a Pokémon), a data miner has also managed to get ahold of the shiny rates for “Scarlet” and “Violet.” Shiny Pokémon are generated based on how many “shiny rolls” the player has. The more rolls, the more likely the player is to encounter a shiny. To calculate the odds, take the number of shiny rolls and divide by 4,096. Pokémon from static encounters, NPC trades, and NPC cannot be shiny.
From Generation VI onward, the base shiny rate is 16/65,536, or 1/4,096. If you have cleared 30-59 Pokémon from an outbreak, you get an additional shiny roll (1/2,048), and if you have cleared 60 or more, then you get two additional shiny rolls (~1/1,366). Getting the Shiny Charm gives two extra rolls, while getting a “Shiny Power” from eating sandwiches will give the player extra rolls based on the bonus’ level (one for level one, etc.). The “Masuda Method” will give the player six extra rolls. The Masuda Method involves breeding two Pokémon from different real-world regions; the egg the two Pokémon produce will have the extra shiny rolls.

As winter break approaches and Carnegie Mellon students prepare to leave for Thanksgiving, The Tartan knows that the thing you will miss most is the science and technology news you read in this here SciTech column. Have no fear, dear reader, we would never leave you high and dry like that. So for this issue of SciTech roundup, here are some of The Tartan’s favorite science content creators on Gen Z’s favorite platform, TikTok. 
1: Hank Green (@hankgreen1)
No list of TikTok science educators could be complete without the science-nerd-half of the Green brothers. Tune in to Hank’s channel to see him rant about just about anything he thinks of, answer questions about videos he’s tagged in with his “Ask Hank” series, and apparently advertise a sock company that’s really cool and good for charity. Who knew?
2: Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neildegrassetyson)
To add another obvious public figure, Neil deGrasse Tyson does indeed have a TikTok! Follow along as he talks about topics spanning science and technology, including the likes of the universe, time, autocorrect, AI, string theory, and the age-old debate: pineapple on pizza (spoiler alert: He says no). Neil’s channel is a good mix between his own talks, clips from interviews, and other content, so there’s something for everyone here. My favorites? A recent video explaining how likely it is that we are living in a simulation, and another that explained that the planet Uranus used to be named George. The more you know!
3: Robert Irwin (@robertirwin)
Rounding out the top three is our final public figure: Robert Irwin! Watch the son of the iconic Steve Irwin carry on his father’s legacy, which is apparently arguing with a very angry curlew named Emily. I mean, I’m here for it. His channel is always good for a wildlife update, usually accompanied by Robert being bitten by said wildlife. Like father, like son. 
4: Tani Berlo (@taniberlo)
I couldn’t just stick to the already-famous science educators, I had to do some of my own personal favorites (if you paid attention to my archeology piece last week, you’ll already know who this is)! Tani is a self-described “History mami” with a love for ancient Egypt, Greece, and all things archeology. She’ll keep you up to date with the latest archeological discoveries as well as just make history entertaining with her “Dumb History” series. Oh yeah, and she’s in the process of developing a history-inspired jewelry company, which might be featured in a future Tartan all-staff meeting (me and my shopping addiction are NOT sorry). We love the girlboss energy.
5: Kyne (@onlinekyne)
Kyne is a drag queen mathematician who is here to teach her viewers while looking fabulous. Her channel includes math-based videos spanning topics like mobius strips and pi, history videos about the origin of Christmas and the Fahrenheit measurement system, as well as videos on makeup, the Philippines, and her life as a drag queen. Come for the math videos, stay for the makeup tutorials, because this Queen can do it all.

SciTech is again diving into the past, because 2022 is turning out to be a great year for archeology! As archaeologists keep finding things, we keep reporting on them, so let’s jump into another set of amazing looks into our past.
A new Egyptian queen
Let's start with what’s possibly the biggest find this week: the tomb of a previously unknown Egyptian QUEEN. Move aside Nefertiti and Cleopatra because Queen Neith is here to stay. 
This pyramid was unearthed when excavating around King Tut’s tomb just last week. Jennifer Nalewicki of Live Science explains that the area Tut was buried in was also home to the pyramid of Teti, the first king of the Sixth Dynasty of Egypt, who was worshiped as a god in the New Kingdom period, leading to many people wanting to be buried around him. Apparently this included Neith and her previously-undiscovered pyramid. Ella Kipling of HITC notes that although we know very little about Queen Neith at the moment, we do know that she was likely named after the goddess Neith, the “patroness of Sais in the Nile River delta,” as two previous female leaders also had names inspired by her. The archeologists note that “It is amazing to literally rewrite what we know of history, adding a new queen to our records.”
That’s not all that was at this site — Sarah Cascone of ArtNet furthers that archeologists also think they found the remains of Tut’s generals and advisors. Nalewicki explains that archeologists discovered “22 [interconnected] shafts, ranging from 30 to 60 feet [9 to 18 meters deep], all with New Kingdom burials.” Within these were 300 New Kingdom coffins each painted with unique faces and with the name of the person inside, and a “huge limestone sarcophagus.” Even more shocking, the mummies inside these coffins were found in good condition, speaking to the advancement of the technology at the time. Further artifacts include games, figurines, statues, and a metal axe.
So for those who argue against the archeology in Egypt, consider this — without these finds, our historical knowledge would be incomplete. So long as it’s done ethically, this is one of the only ways we have to learn about the ancient world. 
The first use of fire
If you read any sci-fi books talking about how to identify intelligent lifeforms (or pay attention to how scientists approach the history of human evolution), then you’ll know that the big milestones for our evolution into a civilization include the first use of tools, including controlled use of fire as a tool. An important example of this? Using fire to cook food, an action that changed what humans eat entirely.
Ariel David of Haaretz explains that archeologists found the earliest conclusive evidence of the use of controlled fire to cook food with 780,000 year old fish teeth. It was already known that humans could use fire, as proven with findings of ash at many sites, but these findings do not say whether the fire was used to cook, to burn garbage, or for warmth, or if the fire was even lit on purpose. Indeed, Tel-Aviv University notes that the previous conclusive evidence of humans using fire to cook only dated back 170,000 years, meaning this finding lengthens our understanding of the evolution of humans by 610,000 years. 
The teeth were found at Gesher Benot Ya’akov, a site in northern Israel where early humans lived along the Jordan river. David notes that of all the fish remains, it was 95 percent teeth that were found. Archeologists hoped this was because fire softened fish bones so that only the teeth survived, which would be a result of cooking the fish. She notes that archeologists tested these teeth with X-ray diffraction to determine if they had expanded due to heat, and determined that they indeed had expanded at rates consistent with heat at low temperatures. This suggested that the fish were cooked, not burned for disposal (which would have been with a hotter flame). 
Tel Aviv University explains the implications, noting that this shows not only the importance of fishing in ancient societies but adds to a long history of cooking food and suggests high cognitive capabilities of these early hunter-gatherers. They note that “gaining the skill required to cook food marks a significant evolutionary advance, as it provided additional means for making optimal use of available food resources.”
Indeed, cooking these fish might have been what jump-started our entire civilization.
The body of Santa Claus
Ok, it’s not ~really~ Santa Claus. But the tomb of Saint Nicholas, the Saint who was known so much for gift-giving that he inspired the tale of Santa Claus, was found. 
Let’s be honest, that’s not quite right either. Parts of Saint Nicholas’ bones have been found since 1953, it’s just we didn’t know it was his yet. Heritage Daily explains that shortly after his death, Saint Nicholas was reburied in the St. Nicholas Church, which was built over the site where he was a bishop. However, his body was moved to the Basilica di San Nicola in Bari shortly after, and then once again moved to the San Nicolò al Lido monastery basilica in Venice during the First Crusade. However, Heritage Daily furthers, apparently they didn’t move all of him, because in 1953, bone fragments in both Bari and Venice were identified as the same person (although whether they were Saint Nicholas was unknown). 
Tre Goins-Phillip of CBN news notes that finally, his tomb has been reportedly discovered underneath an ancient church in Turkey, which was used by Orthodox Christians from the fifth through twelfth century. The church itself was only found in 2017, as it was formerly submerged by the Mediterranean Sea and was built over top. The site is full of statues of Saint Nicholas, and his tomb was found in the center of the remains, buried under around five feet of marble. 
Francesca Aton of ArtNews reports on the importance of this finding, because not only did they unearth flooring that Saint Nicholas would have walked on, but this church is one of the first findings from the time period that he lived in. But we here at The Tartan are simply happy to report that we finally found Santa Claus’ body. 

        We're testing a new look for The Tartan. Let us know what you think!

Did you know that the food you drop into the compost bins at the University Center sometimes becomes soil for Carnegie Mellon's gardens? The green bins next to the trash and recycling ones are one way Carnegie Mellon reduces waste and our carbon footprint.
Carnegie Mellon's composting system has been around since 2008, when the University started collecting food prep, coffee grounds, and leftover food from the Schatz Dining Room. Now, the green bins are in various parts of campus, including the Resnik Food Hall and departmental buildings.
Two types of waste are composted: pre-consumer waste and post-consumer waste. Pre-consumer waste refers to uncooked food left over from meal preparation, such as banana peels, broccoli ends, or a corn cob without its kernels. Post-consumer waste refers to food that has been cooked, leftovers after consumers are done eating, and also includes used compostable utensils. While not mandated, the University encourages dining vendors to use compostable serving products such as plates and napkins so consumers can easily drop their entire meal into the compost bin.
So what happens when you drop food off in the compost bin? First, the compost bags are collected by Facilities Management Services (FMS) and thrown into the compost dumpster. It is important that the compost contains only compostable waste, as items in bags are not sorted, and any non-compostable waste can lead to lower quality compost. If FMS finds that a bag has more than about five percent contamination, the entire bag is thrown into the landfill dumpster. 
The compost dumpster is picked up by AgRecycle, Carnegie Mellon's compost partner. They take the waste to their commercial compost facility, where they add carbon-heavy materials, or "browns," like newspaper, leaves, and cardboard. 
The compost waste brought from the University is high in nitrogen from vegetables and is often called "greens." AgRecycle creates a pile with a higher proportion of browns than greens and waters the pile. Microbes then begin to break down the compost, warming up the pile. 
In a backyard compost pile, the mixture doesn't get hot enough to break down oils and meats, but in a commercial facility like AgRecycle, the larger scale allows the heat to do so while killing harmful bacteria. Once the microbes have finished breaking down the compost, what's left is humus, a organic material rich in nutrients, perfect for adding to soil. 
Carnegie Mellon often buys this humus to add to their own soil in the gardens outside of campus buildings. In this way, they're "completing the circle," as Green Practices Manager Deborah Steinberg put it in an interview with The Tartan.
Because compost can be so easily contaminated, green bins are not given willy-nilly. This is where Steinberg comes in. 
"Part of what I do is different programs to talk about how we can treat campus better or ... giving information behind decision-making, how can you choose the more sustainable thing," Steinberg said. "We do a lot of work with zero waste, so you know, trying to get people to compost more so that we're sending less to the landfills."
While composting does take additional cost and resources in terms of training and paying another vendor to process the compost, "we find that it's like a value added benefit." Steinberg said. "We have ambitions of being closer to zero waste." 
For Carnegie Mellon, zero waste is considered a 90 percent diversion, which means that 90 percent of waste is being sent to places other than the landfill. This includes recycling and composting. About 28 percent of landfill waste is organic material, meaning waste that can be composted. 
"It's the largest percentage of things that we throw out, and it's so easy to compost it, and the compost turns into soil which is only benefiting our farmlands and our gardens," Steinberg said. "So we're taking that away from landfill space, which is gonna fill up. ... Soon it will be closer and closer to where we live and play. And it's just rotting away and making methane which is adding to climate change."
But why compost rather than just recycle? In addition to diverting organic waste from landfills, composting also helps reduce the amount of plastic in recycling processes. While plastic is touted as recyclable, the Environmental Protection Agency estimates that only 8.3 percent of plastic is actually recycled. Plastic is actually extremely difficult to recycle into a material that manufacturers would want to use in their products. Plastic is often thin, flimsy, and made differently by each manufacturer, which is not ideal for recycling. In contrast, aluminum cans and cardboard are very easy to recycle, so it is still important to have both compost and recycling bins.
So how much does Carnegie Mellon compost? In the 2021-2022 academic year, Carnegie Mellon composted 180.19 tons of waste. In comparison, the highest amount of waste they have composted is 653.7 tons during the 2018-2019. These numbers do not necessarily mean that Carnegie Mellon has become more wasteful, but are rather to be expected — during the pandemic, there were fewer people on campus, so there was less waste being produced in general across trash, recycling, and compost bins. 
Steinberg says meeting numerical targets for recycling, composting, or waste is counterintuitive. "Wouldn't we just encourage people to use plastic water bottles and recycle them? What we actually want is all of those numbers to go down. It's hard to focus on ... because if we actually did a really good thing, which was [to] encourage people to use less plastic water bottles, our numbers would look worse." 
Steinberg says that they are not pressured to meet numerical targets, but it is certainly something that the University considers when thinking about environmental impact.

Dear readers,
As the semester comes to a close, PILLBOX continues on our creative grind. Don't worry though, there's only one more issue left before you no longer have to pretend to read PILLBOX to impress your friends. Of course they've all been reading it! They know all about the great Will Curvan's tales "From the Archives." They've staying updated on all the "Letters from Maggie." Hell, they probably even read "Muppet Corner." Well (almost) all of these wonderful series are still in this issue, so now as good a time as any to un "screenager" yourself and become involved in the cultural center of Carnegie Mellon, PILLBOX! In an era of shark-coochie boards and travel influencers, let us serve as a means to culturing yourself so that you, too, can strut about with your head held high, knowing that you are cooler, smarter, and just generally better than everyone else around you.
The aforementioned "From the Archives" section continues unimpeded into it's third issue, this time all about Wean Hall.
"Letters from Maggie" reaches it's penultimate installment! I wonder what will happen next.
Nothing from "Muppet Corner," but Zachary Gelman writes a few other articles, including one riveting Au Bon Pain Experience.
H. F. Chacon Jr. rides again, have you heard of "The Godfather"?
Ire and Jaehyun took some great pictures of Bhangra in the Burgh!
Our musically-inclined Editor-in-Chief reviews HUNNY's "Homesick," and we love him for it.
And Will revolutionizes the B19 Playlist with a little article about how he chose the songs!
Keeping ourselves safe,
Your Pillbox Editors

For this week's PILLBOX playlist, I've crafted a sonic journey through our first semester so far through the lens of my current playlist.
As summer comes to a close, this first-semester playlist rushes out the gate with the energetic "Party on Fifth Ave" by Pittsburgh's own, Mac Miller, and "Hear Me Clearly" by Pusha T. But of course, as excited as we are for college, any big transition will have its moments of existential angst. Cavetown serenades us with "Meteor Shower," a ukulele ballad in 3/4 to accompany us through these trying times, while the reflective "Somewhere Tonight" by Beach House makes us ponder the meaning of it all.
But soon, we're woken up by the academic rigor of our courses, and we get into the swing of the semester. From the giant of indie rock, Tame Impala, we get his classic "Eventually"; from Florida rapper JID, we get "Surround Sound," off of "The Forever Story," arguably his best album yet; next we get Roddy by Djo, better known as Steve from Stranger Things (who knew he could make music?); and after a hard day studying at Sorrels, "Stress Relief" by Late Night Drive Home gives us something to listen to on our 11 p.m. trudge home (if only I had a car). 
Right at the start of October, Kid Cudi — ever the genre-bending innovator — dropped his movie-album combo "Entergalactic." Lots going on in this project, but when the dust settles, it turns out that "Willing to Trust" had the most replay value for me. Then, with a whole week of fall break smack-dab in the middle of spooky season, we can relax to something more lo-fi with "Wonderland" and "From the Subway Train" by Vansire.
As the evening winds get chillier, we get the swirling and synth-heavy "EXP Share" by hip-hop group Exociety to accompany us on our cross-campus walks as they get darker earlier and earlier.
But of course, even as the late-autumn melancholy sets in, we still need to get back into the academic grind. Hubert Lenoir gets our energy back up with the sax and piano-heavy "Fille de Personne II." No clue what he's saying, but you gotta love hearing a funky French boy break it down. Then we get Daniel Caesar's "RESTORE THE FEELING," backed by the harmonies of every music nerd's favorite artist, Jacob Collier. From Exociety alum, Rav, we finish things off with the upbeat and sample-heavy "Get Mine II."

This week, I actually did some proper archival research to bring you the high-quality historical content you've come to expect from PILLBOX. All of the historical photos pictured here come from the University Archives General Photo Collection, and all first-hand correspondence I cite is from the Physical Plant Collection
Wean (also called "The Turtle", allegedly), was built in 1971 in the style of brutalism, the mid-20th century's most unfortunate architectural fad. Wean looks more like the FBI headquarters in DC than a building of higher education. Even so, I find it one of the most strangely compelling structures on campus. Originally called the Research-Computer building (an appropriately bland name), it was renamed to Wean Hall in 1981 after the death of Raymond John Wean, CMU alumnus (class of 1917) and industrialist. The Dec. 6, 1981 edition of the Youngstown Vindicator tells us that the building was dedicated on account of his "many honors, including a CMU alumni distinguished achievement award." He also was an alumni trustee, and received an honorary doctorate of engineering from CMU 1971. 
In Henry Hornbostel's original 1904 proposal for campus, he planned to have Doherty Hall continue down the north end of the mall (mirroring the regular pattern of Baker-Porter on the south end). But the university never got around to fully implementing this plan, leaving a conspicuous Wean-sized chunk of undeveloped hillside for the better part of half a century.
Fresh off the heels of the merger with the Mellon Institute, President Guyford Stever's administration decided it was high time to complete this quad, and began constructing a new building to house the departments of mathematics, computer science, and statistics, along with labs for physics, metallurgy, and material science. A 1968 memo tells us, "GROUND WILL BE BROKEN this summer for this new $13,100,000 Research-Computer Building at Carnegie-Mellon University. The eight-story facility will be built on the side of a ravine bordering campus; thus only three stories and a mechanical equipment penthouse show in this view from the mall."
A factoid I often hear repeated is that Wean once won an award for being one of the most beautiful concrete structures in the world. In fact, the CMU KGB has a page that tells us, using direct quotes, that it was declared the "Most Aesthetically Pleasing Concrete Structure" at some point in the distant past. I was ready to dismiss this rumor entirely, as it seems like the perfect type of dubious meme that would get repeated and distorted through decades of word-of-mouth repetition. But to my surprise, the archives provided me with physical proof; a menu from the 1972 annual awards dinner for Outstanding Concrete Project, sponsored by the Pittsburgh Area Chapter of the American Concrete Institute. During this prestigious evening, they honored Carnegie Mellon's "Research-Computer Building" for being the "completed structure which best represents excellence in conception, originality, and applicability of structural concrete both in design and construction". For dessert, they had "Pecan Ball, Fudge Sauce."
Despite being a relative newcomer to our campus (it's still less than half the age of Baker, Porter, Doherty, and Hammerschlag), Wean already has some historical charm to it. If you've never had the privilege of walking down the Wean 4600 corridor, I highly recommend it. Of all the bizarre places on our storied campus, that hallway is easily one of the most confusing and unsettling. Upon further analysis, this hallway is even stranger than I realized — it burrows into the mall, stretching nearly all the way to Porter. The mall isn't even the mall. It's merely a thin layer of topsoil to conceal the gargantuan concrete roots of Wean. Historical photos reveal that the area of grass directly to the left of the entrance to Wean used to be below grade, serving as a direct entrance to the fourth floor. The front entrance also used to feature that weird orange cube statue that now lives in front of Fifth Neville apartments. 
So, if you're staying on campus this Thanksgiving week, maybe spend some time exploring the secrets hidden with this mysterious concrete monolith. If you manage to find the stairwell that takes you to the forbidden 9th floor, send us a picture!

Dear Cassandra,
Things are quite literally winding down. Snow has started falling sporadically to remind us that it is no longer September, as much as it feels like it still is. I have started to think about final papers and Secret Santas. It’s rather terrifying.
There are all these loose ends being tied up too, what with you and Wendy finally deciding to make it official, and me and Henry… well, doing quite the opposite. Don’t get me wrong, I really am thrilled for you, but we are just going to have to diverge on this particular life path for the time being. Even Heron and Bridget are a thing now, apparently! I found out from them yesterday when I walked past them while I was headed to the Hall of Arts lecture hall. They were sitting at one of those comfy red booth tables. That’s kind of how the whole thing started.
Henry hadn’t been answering my texts as enthusiastically, as you know. I’m not quite sure what happened, and it was running me in circles, thinking about what I did wrong, or if I had suddenly turned into a horrendous green and purple monster. When I saw Heron, I asked if he knew what Henry was up to, since we were supposed to study together that night and he wasn’t responding. Heron looked down briefly to avoid meeting my eyes. Then he told me that he’d seen Henry studying with Kandace from across the hall in 5C. I didn’t even know they were friends, but I figured it was fine. 
It was obviously not fine. I don’t want to get into the details because it does hurt a decent amount, but apparently Henry and Kandace were a lot closer than I knew. And apparently Henry and I were a lot less close than I thought. I guess it happens.
And it’s probably for the best too, since I’m clearly still so hung up on Lou. I’ve been so happy to be talking to him again, but it’s been so static. It’s really hard for me to understand why he even reached out again when he’s being so quiet and detached. 
What I love most about Lou is how, no matter what the situation is, he always manages to drive me the largest possible amount of crazy. Either I am head over heels for him and he’s indifferent (or worse, otherwise occupied) or he’s looking to occupy all my time and energy, and I want him out of the inner depths of my corner where he grows like mold. I am always breathing him in, getting lightheaded, cleaning with bleach, and missing a single colony. The cycles are not good by any means, I’ll admit it, but they nonetheless make me feel justified every time I go into a new one. If the colonies keep growing, there must be something good for them to feed on. 
I often wish I had a distraction from my situation with him, and besides the unfortunate distraction of Henry, it turns out that I do have something. Dietrich Ball is in a few weeks, and I already know what dress I want to wear — you know that incredible backless green one with the silky skirt that shows my tattoo? Everyone’s been talking about the dance — even Monica, and you know it’s not really her kind of thing. I have a plus-one ticket, and obviously I intended to take Henry, but now I’m not sure what to do with it. Of course, I would love to bring you, it’s just that the other night I got the most mysterious text from someone who said they got my number from the University Press directory. They told me to meet them in front of Hamerschlag Hall at 8 p.m. the night of the ball. They said they knew about the people mysteriously appearing in my room and would be able to tell me what happened.
Now, obviously you know I’m not one to meet strangers at night, but with everything that’s happened recently, I’m so hungry for answers. And I feel so safe on this campus at night that I can’t even begin to imagine anything going wrong. Anyone who knows this about me must have some sort of connection; at least that’s what I’m banking on.
I’ll let you know what happens.
Mags

As anyone who knows me well knows, I’m a big fan of indie and rock music. One of the bands I know a song or five from is HUNNY, who released a deluxe version of their latest EP, “Homesick” on Friday. I somehow missed the actual EP’s release in July, but now’s as good a time as ever to give the deluxe version a review. Full disclosure: I had not heard any of the songs before writing this, so these are my first impressions.
‘JFK’ - 8.1/10
“JFK” was a good start to the album! I’m a fan of the guitar opening and the overall vibe. I will note, though, that at times I was struggling to figure out what was actually being sung. I had to look at the lyrics to actually see what they were. Overall, a good song despite only being just over a minute-and-a-half long.
‘Homesick’ - 9.0/10
“Homesick” is very deserving to be the namesake of this album; that is to say, I’m a huge fan. The song has a very standard rock feel with a good amount of experimentation mixed in that I like. This song definitely scratches the part of my brain that is looking for feel-good rock exactly like this. I also just like songs that contain background conversation like “Homesick” does. This song will definitely be on some playlists of mine in the future. 
‘Loser’ - 8.9/10
“Loser” is definitely a different feeling coming off of “Homesick.” It feels like every different type of thought in my head — from those weird intrusive thoughts to thoughts of want and longing. I like this song for different reasons than I like “Homesick”; “Loser” just is about what we all want: to not feel like a loser.
‘New Recording 122 August 19, 2020’ - 7.6/10
This is such a silly little addition on the album, and I love it. It is literally just a recording of someone getting in their car and singing to themself. It’s the flavor of humor I find really funny, and I’m glad it’s on here.
‘Speed Dial’ - 7.1/10
“Speed Dial” isn’t really up my alley, but I recognize it’s a good song. It’s a bit more punk-ish than some of the other songs on the album, but by no means does that take away from anything. It caught me off guard following “New Recording,” and like “JFK,” it’s not that long of a song. If you like some pop punk, this song is probably for you.
‘Good Will Hunting Song’ - 7.8/10
I don’t know if I’m missing any connection to “Good Will Hunting” because I haven’t seen it, but I do like this song. The upbeat tempo with the syncopation for the beginning of the song was really good, and I was honestly not expecting the complete vibe change toward the end of the song. I like it!
‘Homesick - slenderbodies remix’ - 7.1/10
I’ll preface this by saying I’m not usually a huge fan of song remixes, especially of songs I like unremixed. Anyways, I don’t think this remix adds very much to the original, but it also doesn’t take much away. I think it’s a different take on “Homesick,” but it’s not really for me. 
‘Homesick - Planet Heaven Version’ - 8.2/10
This remix feels so different from the original “Homesick,” that I didn’t realize it was a remix at first. It feels very similar to an acoustic version of “Homesick,” and I have to say I’m a fan. While I still prefer the original over this one, I could definitely see myself listening to this version if I want something a little bit more chill.
Overall Impressions
While I am overall a fan of the album (maybe minus the slenderbodies remix), the entire album doesn’t do it for me like the entirety of HUNNY’s “Pain / Ache / Loving” or “Vowels (and the Importance of Being Me).” It’s definitely an album I will revisit sooner or later (especially because I like “Homesick” and “Loser”). If you like rock, then I’d say give “Homesick” a try. My overall impression is to give this album around a 8.3/10.

It is difficult to design a story that makes its audience commiserate with a person of wicked and sinful nature. We know that the way to reach a state of complete evil is not an instant choice but a slow and dark burning process within a person’s soul. I find it interesting that Francis Ford Coppola’s “The Godfather” (1972) does not care for the romanticization of a life of crime, but it rather focuses on Michael Corleone (Al Pacino); it wishes to tell us how the presence of evil within a family is an abyss that can corrupt anyone, no matter how sensible or rational they seem to be, and how assimilation into another country’s culture is a complex process that can pull a person apart — tearing them between the old and new country’s identities. 
The beginning line of the film has depth when you begin to realize what the film is trying to tell you. “I believe in America. I raised my daughter in an American fashion,” and the following conversation between the pleading undertaker and Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) shows us the inner workings of the mob. On the surface, the private life of the mob is one of honor and principle, of favors and dealings to protect the meek when no one else will. All the mob wishes to do is shelter their family from the many ways that the predatory world is trying to attack them and the enemies that the family makes within their dealings. The act of backroom dealings, that is, paying for services when justice doesn’t go in your favor, is a deal with the devil and a story as old as time itself. Ultimately, there is nothing good that comes from these sorts of dealings, and the film makes it known that this sort of zeal to shift the world in your favor — to lie, cheat, steal and kill everything in one’s path in a blind spur of wrath — leaves a person devoid of rationale and goodness. 
One of the key characteristics of the "Godfather" films is the use of shadows. The films get darker as they progress, with some critics at the time calling this characteristic a production error and drawback, but I believe that the shadows stand as a representation of the dishonesty of the Corleone mafia family. The film serves as a sinkhole that drags the viewer — just as circumstance drags Michael through evildoing — leaving them washed in melancholy. Just as the shadows consume more and more of the screen, the tenebrosity of Michael’s clothing engulfs him, showing how far he has fallen from the man he was at the film's beginning.
When we first meet Michael at the vibrant and lively wedding scene, he tells his then-girlfriend Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) of the coercion of innocent people into dealings that work against them; that the facilitation of vices to tempt the lowly is “his family, not him.” His clean, marine medal-decorated, Ivy League good boy image is far from the murderous and greedy malpractices of his father and his army of mobsters. He is distant from his family as his father, who stands by the code that “a man who doesn’t spend time with his family can never be a real man,” nevertheless understands and is okay with Michael’s path being different than his. He knows that Michael has the possibility to make the Corleone family legitimate, rising out from the crime and poverty of the old country as a first-generation immigrant within America, as a Senator or a Governor. Vito is a man visibly haunted by the actions he has committed in the past. He doesn’t want a life of crime or poverty for his children, so he does whatever he can to push them ahead just a little further in a society that hates them, despite knowing that what he does is wrong and that after he is gone, he’s going to be forever in debt to the sins he has committed. 
Unfortunately, Vito knows that his departure from this world hangs close on the horizon, and in a similar fashion to the Shakespearean tragedy of "King Lear," one of his sons, the hot-headed “Sonny” Santino (James Caan), the thin-skinned bachelor Fredo (John Cazale), or Michael, will succeed him in the position of patriarch for the family. It’s just a matter of if he can muster up an ending to his legacy that allows his family to come out of the life of crime safely. When the rise of narcotics comes to the organized crime table, Don Corleone remains steadfast in his belief of legitimacy for the family, stating his position that, despite the money that the narcotics industry will bring him and his family, he cannot and will not allow the Corleone family to dirty themselves with anything larger than small vices on an organized level. The temptation of money, however, is too powerful for the other families and infighting ensues, beginning a war that leaves Vito an unconscious target of assassination and Sonny as the temporary head of all dealings. 
It is when Michael hears that there has been an attempt on his father’s life that he runs to protect his family, placing him on the path of becoming a gangster. The moment that he bends down to his father’s hospital bed and whispers to him that he is “with him now,” his journey has been set. Through the arguing of Sonny and family lawyer Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) on whether or not the matter of assassination is business or personal, Michael decides that he will do the unthinkable and murder both the man who put a hit on his father and the corrupt police captain who tried to stop Michael from defending him. Within a small family-owned Brooklyn pizzeria, the thoughts of what Michael is about to commit can be seen rattling within his eyes. He knows that after murdering these two men, his fate will be sealed, and there will be no way out for him. Regardless, he keeps to this plan because either he knows that it’s a matter of sacrificing himself for his family, or maybe he sees attacks on his family as personal and sees righteousness in taking justice into his own hands, just as his father used to do.
After all, Michael seems to be a person who springs to the idea of defending what he considers "good," even if he has to lay down his life or take someone else’s to do so. He subscribes to the American ideals, voluntarily serving as a Marine in World War II. By marrying the non-Italian Kay Adams and by describing himself to others under the label of “American” while his family labels themselves “Sicilian,” he teeters on the edges of two identities which cannot seem to go together. 
The honorable is an ambiguous thing within "The Godfather," and Michael learns that the actions of his family, though objectively evil, are becoming more and more clear as necessary within a world that will thrash you about if you allow it. As police and justice fail again and again, Michael turns to see his father’s doings as correct in a world where everything you do, no matter what, is wrong. Slowly, these ideals of American perfection slip away, and he ends up being a man willing to do anything, right or wrong, to care for and defend the people closest to him. 
Near the end of the picture, when meeting back up with Kay years later, when she recalls that he promised her he wouldn’t become like his father, he tells her that his “father is no different than any other powerful man,” and that any man who is in power, whether they be a president or a peacemaker, is willing to have people murdered for the sake of taking care of other people. It is a dark change to the once proud-to-serve man that he was introduced as. This is further exemplified when the bloodshed of his family’s war with the other crime bosses leaves his brother Sonny dead — viciously ripped apart by sub-machine guns — and the final moments of Vito — who passes while playing with his grandson in his backyard. The complete domination of business in Michael’s life comes as he seeks to expand the Corleone organized crime reach into Las Vegas, where he belittles his older brother to “never take sides with anyone against the family again.” He wants to control everything and everyone, making sure that no one gets out of line against his wishes and proceedings. 
The ultimate culmination of all this comes when he becomes the godfather to his sister’s son interspliced with his revenge against the four other families. During the proceedings, he is asked by the priest if he believes in God, and if he renounces Satan and his works. Michael claims that he does, as his orders are acted out and his enemies are massacred. He lies and plans to lie to whomever to get what he wishes, and in this way, he has become just like his father, with the exact same view of the world and its many problems. 
The film ends with Michael murdering the abusive husband of his sister for betraying the family and getting Sonny killed, and dismissing his sister when she comes crying and spitting and thrashing at him. He lies to Kay about the murder after promptly yelling at her for asking him about his business affairs, with the final line of the movie being him crowned as Don Corleone, as the door to the study where the film opened is shut on Kay, fading us into complete and utter blackness. It is a masterful ending that leaves the audience in a dreadful state of hushed suppression. Michael's soul has been sold, and the tragedy caused his fall from grace. He is the embodiment of the evil which he first sought to end. A 9.75 out of 10 film. 
TD;LR: “The Godfather” tells the tragic tale of how a person can be broken by a hunger for power that slips them from their original ideals of honor. Through temptation, a person once of goodness and justice will see themselves become the thing that they once hated. It serves as a warning that if we as a society continue on a path of destruction of our values, we will see ourselves as enemies to ourselves, engulfed in nothing but evil.

“Barbarian” has been independently successful, even without any complimentary articles from PILLBOX or our mother newspaper The Tartan. In general, I try to keep my thumb off the scale, only reviewing things that civilians no longer need to pay to experience. This is because I try to make sure that nothing I do can contribute positively to the world. If I wrote this review one month ago, then there would be the possibility that someone paid (!!) to watch it. Now they can watch it on HBO max, and I’m guilt free.
“Barbarian” is good, but some of the more horrific elements didn’t work as well for me.
Anyways, I’ve been a big fan of Zach Creggers’ other work for some time, specifically “The Whitest Kids U’ Know.” They were a pretty successful comedy troupe that made five seasons of a pretty funny sketch comedy show. They are also working on a full-length animated feature film entitled “Mars,” which sounds like it will be their last collaboration, as Trevor Moore (their de facto leader), tragically passed away in August of last year. Writing about comedy is possibly the only thing more grueling than making comedy, except maybe for reading about comedy. Anyways, here are some WKUK skits that I liked:
Sniper Business
“And this morning I walk into my office and the s**** of b**** over at Bergman-Sachs put a sniper on the roof.”
From Season 2 Episode 9, this is just a funny little skit about a businessman trying to get a merger through, while his corporate opponent has stationed a sniper on the roof and is trying to kill him. It’s classically entertaining and overall pretty clean compared to many of their other skits. I guess the sketch could be considered a light satire of business, specifically the part where an intern is used and disposed of in a rather literal manner.
Bear Problems
“To make things short I will just confirm that yes, we do have a moon base, and yes, we are currently experiencing some bear problems.”
From Season 2 Episode 8, this skit centers press conference about the presence of bears on the moon. It’s short and sweet and manages to stay funny throughout. The ending gag about the whole conference being a lie to try to divert reporters’ attention away from an invasion of Iran is funny, and betrays the Bush era these sketches were written in, yet still feels relevant to how many modern journalists deal with stories.
I Want to Kill the President
“I want to kill the President of the United States of America.”
From Season 1 Episode 6, this skit features a character played by Trevor Moore explaining the laws around making public statements about wanting to kill the President of the United States. Again another Bush-era sketch, from back when it was more socially acceptable for comedians to publicly comment about wishing death upon the president. Interestingly enough, this skit was used in a court case when some Facebook user posted a transcript of the skit, replacing mentions of the president with mentions of his wife. He served three years in prison before the Supreme Court overturned his conviction, affirming his right to write borderline death threats to his wife, and demonstrating Trevor Moore’s deep legal understanding.
Bill's Back from Vietnam
“I may be too cowardly to go over there and fight you people, but I am not too cowardly to kick your unarmed ass at a barbecue down the street from my house!”
From Season 5 Episode 8, Bill comes back from the Vietnam war, except one man notices that he’s actually Vietnamese now. I love the 70s outfits, and I like the silly take on a classic spy trope.
Kid Beer
“‘I woke up covered in throwup, I punched my mom, I broke all my toys. Kid beer ruined my f**** life but I f**** love it.’ - Toby Age 3, Alcoholic”
    From Season 4 Episode 4, the Corheisen brewing company invents forms of beer for a younger and younger demographic. Kid beer → Baby beer → Embryonic beer. It has some classic lines, and I love watching child actors talk about drinking beer. It reminds me a bit of the Baby Toy segment of “Nathan For You.” The ending is a bit of a non-sequitur, but it’s really difficult to write endings.

This Thursday, the U.S. Senate ended debate on the Respect for Marriage act, a bill that would federally protect same-sex and interracial marriage. The bill still needs to pass an official Senate vote and proceeding to vote. 12 Republican senators, including Mitt Romney (R-UT), voted in favor, putting the bill comfortably within the 60 votes needed to overcome the filibuster. 
The bill would require all states to recognize the marriage licenses issued by other states, as well as repeal the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage to be exclusively between two members of the opposite sex. The bill would not legalize same-sex marriage at the federal level. 
The bill has support from some unlikely allies, including the Church of Latter-Day Saints (the Mormon Church). While the Church still considers same-sex marriage to be against God's commandments, they support the bill because they believe it sufficiently maintains religious freedom. 
Same-sex marriage is now supported by 70 percent of Americans, significantly higher from the mere 40 percent in 2008. Support for same-sex marriage has been one of the most rapid changes in national sentiment for a civil rights issue.
The bill passed the House in July with a 267-157 vote, receiving support from 47 Republicans. If the Senate approves the bill, it will return to the House (amendments have been added to the bill), after which it will go to President Biden. 
A vote of cloture on the bill was postponed until after the midterms to mitigate worry by some Republican members of Congress. The amendments added to the bill address concerns that the bill would endanger religious freedom by including provisions that require nonprofit religious institutions to recognize same-sex marriages.  
Since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, lawmakers have felt urgency to codify same-sex and interracial marriage. In his concurring Opinion on Dobbs v. Jackson, Justice Clarence Thomas argued that "we should reconsider all of this Court's substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell." These cases protect the right to contraception access, same-sex relationships, and same-sex marriage, respectively. Should these cases be overturned, it would eliminate the only federal protections that exist for these rights.

Public discussion on caste discrimination in Carnegie Mellon University is rare, and it being highlighted on the Fence is even rarer. The caste system is a pervasive class structure determined by birth and is historically prevalent in South Asian countries. While caste discrimination is abolished by the Indian Constitution, it still exists in India and other South Asian countries like Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, regardless of religious identity. At the moment, Carnegie Mellon does not have a policy that acknowledges caste discrimination or protects against it.
Bikash Gupta, a Master’s student in Public Policy and Management in Data Analytics at Heinz College, spent the last two years reading and writing extensively on issues of social justice. He has also written about his own experiences facing ethnic racism in his home country, Nepal. Until last year, he worked with Prem Pariyar, a Master’s student at Cal State East Bay University, on a research project investigating the impact of caste on the Nepali diaspora in San Francisco. Pariyar went on to successfully advocate to include "caste" in his university’s anti-discrimination policy, and Gupta worked closely with him on this. In Jan. 2022, the Cal State University system — with 23 campuses, it is the largest public university system in the country — added caste to its anti-discrimination policy. 
When Gupta arrived at Carnegie Mellon, he researched the University’s policy regarding caste and reached out to friends. “Dareen Basma and Drica Dennis at Heinz DICE [Diversity, Inclusion, Climate and Equity] office encouraged me on this inclusive mission,” he wrote in an email to The Tartan. “In the fall semester, my friends and I formed a Dalit Solidarity group.”
The CMU Dalit Solidarity Group painted the Fence on Nov. 14 to raise awareness on caste discrimination and call on the University to add "caste" to its Statement of Assurance. The front of the Fence read “End caste discrimination” while the back was painted with both Hindi and English lettering saying “Freedom from Casteism” and “Jai Bhim,” invoking the popular slogan referring to renowned Dalit reformer and the father of the Indian Constitution Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar. “Painting the Fence felt like a good way to start raising awareness along the lines of CMU traditions. We had a lot of fun doing it,” explained Abhilash Biswas, a Master’s student in Public Policy and Management in Data Analytics at Heinz College. 
Though CMU Dalit Solidarity Group aims to fight all caste discrimination, their name highlights solidarity with Dalits, who were previously known as “untouchables” and belonged to the lowest stratum of the castes in India. “The word ‘Dalit’ is strongly associated with caste discrimination resistance movements in India. It was adopted early on in the anti-caste movements,” explained Biswas. He believes that although the movements mention the word “Dalit,” it encompasses all oppressed castes. “Hence, from that contextual perspective, the assumption was that people would understand that the group aims to work against all kinds of caste discrimination.”
Gupta believes that while there is a numerical basis for why caste should be added in the Statement of Assurance — with Carnegie Mellon's large South Asian student population — increasing research in the diasporas show that caste exists outside South Asian territories. “In fact, [caste] tends to reproduce, and in some cases fiercely,” Gupta explained. He cited an Equality Labs research report that showed one in three Dalit students in the U.S. report being discriminated against during their education. 
CMU’s Statement of Assurance currently reads: “Carnegie Mellon University does not discriminate in admission, employment, or administration of its programs or activities on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, handicap or disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Furthermore, Carnegie Mellon University does not discriminate and is required not to discriminate in violation of federal, state, or local laws or executive orders.”
“As a white American, my understanding of caste was that it was a problem that did not exist in the U.S. However, my participation in this group has raised my awareness of how permeable and pervasive the influence of caste really is, extending beyond any national border and infiltrating our shared academic spaces,” said Caroline Keller, a Master’s student in Public Policy and Management in Data Analytics at Heinz College. “It is disheartening to hear stories of friends and peers experiencing isolation and other forms of discrimination. Yet, I’m invigorated by this growing solidarity movement and I’m hopeful CMU will not tolerate caste-based discrimination.”
Dr. Dareen Basma, Assistant Dean of DICE at Heinz College, supported the group since its inception. “Now the reality is if a student comes to any one of us and says that they're experiencing discrimination as a result of caste, the university is going to do something about it, right? We are going to investigate, we're going to have these conversations. So in some ways, [caste] itself doesn't necessarily need to be in the statement of assurance for us to mobilize as an institution,” she explained. 
Because of Carnegie Mellon’s large South Asian population, she said that the University must think about inclusion and belonging. “Though we might not understand the depth of [caste-based discrimination], it's a signal to our really large population of our students that we are here and we want to support in whatever way that we can.” She added that if other universities acknowledge caste discrimination, it makes sense for Carnegie Mellon to do the same. In addition to the California State University system, Harvard, Brandeis, Colby College, and UC Davis have added caste to their non-discrimination policies.
Gupta believes that even though every form of discrimination can manifest in similar ways, the University should add caste explicitly to the Statement of Assurance because there are unique nuances. “Putting [caste] with other terms or looping it with other protections water down the unique struggles/pain/challenges that caste-oppressed people face,” he explained. One reason to include a particular form of discrimination is that it provides ground for redressal. The terms included in the statement have symbolic value and assure redressal if need be. In the current Statement, there are potentially overlapping terms (for example, ancestry covers a lot of other terms and religion and creed are related). However, the assumed intention is that each type of discrimination is unique and each deserve acknowledgement. “We hope caste also occupies a similar place,” he added.
For Mihir Bhaskar, a Master’s student in Public Policy and Management in Data Analytics at Heinz College, raising awareness is a strong first step because he believes a lot of caste discrimination in the U.S. is implicit, because of the underrepresentation of oppressed communities in University spaces. “CMU is also somewhat unique because of its global presence, with multiple campuses. Setting a precedent in the ‘home’ campus would hopefully be able to impact students outside the U.S. as well, such as in CMU-Qatar, who may be in settings where caste discrimination is more pervasive,” he explained.
Dr. Basma knows that caste is a big conversation in Carnegie Mellon’s Qatar campus due to its large South Asian population, and helped Gupta connect with Annette Vincent, DEI lead in CMU-Qatar. 
The group recently conducted a screening of the 2014 Marathi-language film “Court,” highlighting issues around caste and the Indian legal system, followed by a discussion event featuring Ketaki Jayawant from the William and Jefferson College who studies caste politics and history.
The group is plans to host another movie screening and discussion this semester. They also plan to have a speaker series where they will invite Dalit activists and scholars to talk about the issue. “We hope more awareness will lead to greater advocacy and support for the inclusion of ‘caste’ in the university’s statement of assurance,” explained Gupta. They said they will also reach out to affinity groups and expand their network of allies, including the Graduate Student Assembly and the Undergraduate Student Senate.
Dr. Basma clarified that the work coming out of the DICE office isn’t necessarily that of the group, though she believes they have similar intentions, and that they don’t intend to polarize communities. “The hope here is to bring people together to have conversations and it's not to pit groups against each other and I hope that's kind of evident in the beginning the caste conversations work that we've been doing with the film screenings,” she said.
Gupta said that members of the group haven’t discussed the existing members’ caste identities. “As a non-Dalit, I recognize my position and privilege. We have discussed that we need people with those lived experiences to play a leadership role in this movement,” he said. They hope that by raising awareness through events like movie screenings and discussions, and painting the Fence, more people will join and take leadership roles. The response to the Fence painting was encouraging. A post on the Instagram page @CMUFence garnered over 400 likes and shares. “I believe at a university, we should not be shying away from these important societal issues and should have an honest talk about it and how it affects our friends, peers, and neighbors,” said Gupta.

127 students from 18 universities took part in the Toronto Metropolitan University Thrill Design Invitational (TMUTD) last weekend, Nov. 10 - 13, including a team of seven from Carnegie Mellon. 
TMUTD is a four-day event that focuses on theme park design. Competing teams were given a theme and specifications, and expected to design theme park rides that best fit the criteria. The overall theme of the competition was redesigning the preexisting Seuss Landing at Universal Islands of Adventure. 
The competition featured seven challenges, and each team was invited to compete in a subset of the seven based on the strengths demonstrated in the Open Qualifying Round that determined eligibility for the actual competition. The Carnegie Mellon team was invited to compete in two of the challenges: interactive “boat” ride and multilevel indoor attraction with two-way visual contact with dining. 
The Carnegie Mellon team was made up of students from the Carnegie Mellon Entertainment Technology Center and the Theme Park Engineering Group. Members included junior Anaya Bhammar, senior Riley Forster, Master's student Lori Kipp, junior Justin Peng, fifth-year Katia Peppas, junior Matthew Saenz, and Master's student Em Tyminski.
Teams received the challenges on Thursday, Nov. 10 at 11 a.m. and were expected to have presentations ready by Saturday, Nov. 12 at 10:30 a.m. 
“Our team was given two challenges, and we decided to have two small teams within our team that focused on one of the challenges, but also be free to help with any part needed,” Peng said. 
On Thursday, the team focused on brainstorming ideas for the challenges, and then went to see other group presentations and Seuss Landing on Friday to get a better sense of the area. 
One of the major struggles for the Carnegie Mellon team was that half their team members were stuck in Pittsburgh while the competition started. “Three of our seven team members were stranded in Pittsburgh due to Hurricane Nicole,” Peng stated. “The first four of us were able to catch an early morning flight, but the rest of us had flight after flight canceled. Eventually, our team members arrived around midnight on Saturday early morning.”
Due to Hurricane Nicole, the final recognition ended up being that four of the 18 competing teams were recognized as outstanding, meaning they received two or more commendations in two or more challenges. Carnegie Mellon was one of those teams, receiving excellence in creative skill and integration. 
“Many of the teams we observed had exceptional rides that were very optimistic about the physical space allotted to them in the challenge, as well as technical specifications that were not realistic given their proposals,” Peng said.

Last Tuesday, the world’s population hit 8 billion people. This is based on United Nations projections, which reported another billion reached just 12 years after the population hit seven billion. 
The UN said this is the fastest increase they expect to see, and birth rates will decline from here. Tara Subramaniam of CNN explained that demographers place the current growth rate as less than one percent per year, which is causing the population to plateau as that rate gets closer to zero. As the population continues to grow, the UN expects the world population to hit nine billion in 2039 (17 years after eight billion).
The UN estimates that the world population will peak at 10.4 billion people in the 2080s, plateau until 2100, and then decline. Daniel Victor of the New York Times said around 70 percent of the growth from seven to eight billion people came from low- and lower-middle-income countries mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, with the same demographics projected to account for 90 percent of the growth from eight to nine billion. 
The country-by-country breakdown also has notable changes. Victor explained that India is likely to pass China as the country with the largest population in summer 2023. Dan Ikpoyi of PBS reported that in 30 years, Nigeria is projected to grow from 216 million to 373 million, tying with the U.S. for third most populous country. Other nations with notable growth include the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Egypt, Pakistan, and the Philippines. 
Some countries' populations declined, although not enough to offset those that are growing. Ikpoyi said that  61 nations are expected to experience population decline by one percent or more. The UN attributes this to emigration and low fertility rates, with over two-thirds of the world’s population living in areas where lifetime fertility is below replacement level (roughly 2.1 births per woman). 
In honor of the population milestone, a baby was chosen to be the symbolic eight billionth baby — well, two of them were. Baby Vinice Mabansag of the Philippines and baby Damian of the Dominican Republic were given the title.
But what does this population growth signal for the world? Experts don’t see it as a death knell for the human race. In fact, Ikpoyi noted that the issue isn’t the number of people on the planet, but the behaviors of the people who are here. He quoted Charles Kenny, who stated that, “Population is not the problem, the way we consume is the problem.” How we handle population growth isn’t by looking at the underdeveloped countries that contribute to population spikes, but at the developed countries that use resources too fast.
This includes environmental harms of our consumption, which Victor said is unsustainable, leading to “climate change, deforestation, and the loss of biodiversity.” Add this to the challenges of meeting the needs of everyone, whether it be with education, public health, employment, water, or sanitation, and we are trying to do more with less.

Theft of Scooter
Several Carnegie Mellon students advised University Police that their scooters had been stolen from TCS, Welch House, Newell Simon, and the Tepper Quad.  An investigation is ongoing.
Phone Scam
Several Carnegie Mellon students advised University Police that they were contacted by unknown persons who stated they were Chinese officials or members of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The unknown person stated there was an issue with the student’s passport and they would be deported unless they provided the person with money. 
Theft of Laptop
A Carnegie Mellon staff member advised University Police that a laptop was stolen from a university property on Craig Street. An investigation is ongoing.
Suspicious Male
University Police responded for a male sleeping in the lobby of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) Hall. The male was found to be a non-affiliate and had no legitimate purpose on campus. The male was removed from campus and issued a defiant trespass warning. 
Suspicious Package
University Police responded to the Cohon University Center for a suspicious package. The Cohon University Center was evacuated, and it was determined that the package was part of a student’s project.  
Fire
University Police responded to Porter Hall for a small fire which was caused by a laser cutter. The fire was extinguished and there were no injuries or property damage. 
Alcohol Amnesty
University Police responded to Mudge House for an intoxicated student. The student was provided medical attention and no citations were issued due to alcohol amnesty.

The Undergraduate Student Senate meeting, held on Nov. 17, opened with a Special Allocations presentation from the Finance Committee for a request from the International Film Festival. 
The International Film Festival sought funding for a short film hackathon. They requested $12,000, to be split between honorariums, screening venue, reception, competition facilities, and screening costs. The Finance committee recommended funding the International Film Festival $3,500, which did not fund mentor or juror honorariums. The Senate approved this recommendation 16-2-4.
Members of the Finance Committee also discussed an individual travel fund for undergraduates. Undergraduates could request money to cover costs of conventions, professional trips, or interviews. 
Additionally, the Joint Funding Committee slate of members added two new senators to the Committee. The Committee previously had no members from the College of Fine Arts. 
Student Body President Natalie Salazar and Student Body Vice President Joan Song delivered updates to the Senate. One of the team’s main focuses is “EAT”: equity, accessibility, and transparency. Many of their initiatives this term have focused on accessibility and opportunity.
The Senate will host vacancy elections at their Dec. 1 meeting. There is currently one College of Fine Arts vacancy, three Dietrich College vacancies, two School of Computer Science vacancies, and one Tepper School of Business vacancy. 
The Senate also voted to change the Committee on Student Organizations bylaws. The vote passed 25-2-3. See the Nov. 7 Senate Update for more information. 
Following some other Senate-specific announcements, the Senate held an open floor discussion. Topics included pushing back the drop deadline, allowing first-years to make their first semester pass/fail, office hour queues, initiatives for donating clothes, and student parking. There are plans for more open floor discussions in the future.

“How were the Democrats able to overcome history?” asked Dana Brown, Executive Director of the Pennsylvania Center for Women and Politics (PCWP). “In the last 22 midterm elections between 1934 and 2018, the President’s party has on average lost 28 seats in the House and four seats in the Senate.” This year, Democrats lost just a net of six congresspeople. “The big question is: Why?” 
On Wednesday, Brown moderated a post-election analysis event hosted by the PCWP at Chatham. PUMP and Coro Pittsburgh were partners for the nonpartisan four-person panel and 90.5 WESA was the media sponsor. 
Between the 2018 and 2022 midterms, voter turnout dipped from 49 percent to 47 percent. This is still a significant amount compared to the 2014 rate of 36 percent. Among eligible 18- to 29-year-old voters, 27 percent cast their ballot this midterm cycle. In swing states percent jumped to 31, the same as young voters’ historic 2018 turnout rate.
Brown noted that over 170 Republicans in the incoming Congress cast doubt on or denied the 2020 Presidential election results. “Still, election deniers lost statewide in six states,” she said. 
WESA Government and Accountability Editor Chris Potter said that election results suggested that “being normal was actually maybe a good thing.” This meant voters held candidates to higher standards and “that people, very broadly, are tired of a certain kind of fever that I think is really taking root in the electorate.”
Republican National Committeewoman Christine Toretti expected Shapiro’s gubernatorial win but said she was shocked by the PA Senate results. As a leader in the state’s Republican party, Toretti said the RNC could have selected better candidates. She also said she was frustrated by the amount of out-of-state money that poured into the PA midterms from donors who “didn’t really understand Pennsylvania and understand what’s important to us.”
PA Republican Senate candidate Mehmet Oz said he moved from New Jersey to Pennsylvania in late 2020. 
Panelists speculated that polls were off because they overlooked people for pundit expertise. According to Vanessa Williams, Deputy National Political Editor at The Washington Post, after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, The Post focused election predictions on what voters were saying. “But then we stopped talking to them and started listening to the consultants,” who shifted the narrative about voters’ priorities. 
Williams said she doubted the idea that voters could pivot so quickly from reproductive autonomy to crime and the economy. “I don’t think it gave voters enough credit for being smart enough and complex enough to care about more than one thing at a time,” she said.
Larry Hailsham, Political Director of Shapiro for Pennsylvania, said that the division in politics was too polarizing for many voters. Hailsham said that while he was on the campaign trail, Pennsylvanians said they wanted a governor who could get things done in Harrisburg. “Everywhere we went, we’ve met somebody that said, ‘I was a Republican, but I’m voting for Josh,’” Hailsham recounted. 
According to Potter, policing was one of the issues Shapiro handled most deftly. He promised to increase the police force while also signaling to progressives that he would reform policing. “There are very few people more accomplished at threading that needle than Josh Shapiro. And that is what makes him a political juggernaut amongst Democrats. It’s one of the reasons why he didn’t have any kind of primary opposition. That, and he just raises more money than God,” Potter said. 
Williams said that voters of color who are frustrated by Republican opposition to gun control “aren’t anti-police. They say, ‘No, we want police, we want more police, we want them to protect us, but we also don’t want them to kill us.” She said policing is a complicated issue that is dismissed and oversimplified as a “wedge issue.” According to Williams, a Washington Post report found that neither side of the aisle addresses crime in the terms voters want to see. 
Brown noted that of the 11 percent of Pennsylvanians who said crime was a key voting issue, 51 percent indicated that they voted for the Democrat. 
According to Brown, exit polls showed that of the 37 percent of Pennsylvanians who said abortion was a key issue, 78 percent voted for the Democrat. She asked panelists what role abortion plated in the 2022 midterms. 
Williams said she doubts voters’ support for abortion rights — including in the six related ballot initiatives — is what the conservative Supreme Court Justices expected when they gave states the power to choose. “It went beyond just abortion rights to the notion of, ‘Who are these people to tell me what I can do?’” Williams explained. Exit polls suggested that the consensus among voters was: “The government shouldn’t tell people what to do,” especially not “these guys telling us what we can do with our lives.”
Despite leading anti-abortion efforts in the Pennsylvania State Senate, Republican gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano did not take a strong stance on abortion in his campaign. “It was palpable that there was this concern amongst Republicans about this issue,” Potter said. “And yes, I think the pundit class played it down.” 
Potter thought it was “patronizing” of pundits to assume that voters would forget about the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. He said that returning abortion decisions to states “metastasized the issue; now it becomes a thing for everybody.”
To Republicans, Potter said abortion was a can they could kick down the road. Then the road ended, and they realized they may have misread what their constituents wanted. 
Toretti said that abortion is a difficult subject to engage within the RNC. “I understand the need to protect the life of the unborn,” she said. Yet Toretti also questions if “the Republican party has really thought this through other than to just roll over and say we protect the lives of the unborn.” She said that they need to emphasize their respect for women’s “control of their body and their space.”
Until Republicans can figure out how to communicate that message, Toerriti said abortion is going to “be a bigger problem moving forward.”
While Shapiro may have been the only candidate with a BeReal, Senate candidate John Fetterman capitalized on social media platforms like TikTok and Twitter that gave his campaign a “viral quality,” Potter said. 
Republicans do not campaign on TikTok “because of the Chinese connection,” Toretti said. “We’re really shooting ourselves in the foot with that one.”
According to Potter, some voters may have felt “bored to tears by Josh Shapiro,” but it helped his campaign come out on top compared to his opponent, Doug Mastriano, who proffered an extreme conservative platform. “Shapiro felt like the only candidate whose campaign I would’ve recognized from 2010.”

Massive protests in Iran have led to thousands of arrests. Amnesty International explained that Iranian authorities are seeking the death penalty for at least 21 people in what they describe as “sham trials designed to intimidate those participating in the popular uprising that has rocked [the nation].” 
Five of these individuals have already been sentenced to death by the courts for “enmity against God” and “corruption on earth” based on charges of arson, property destruction, and one assault case that are categorized as security violations. Official information on protestors' identities hasn’t been released, but Amnesty International determined that these unnamed individuals are likely Mohammad Ghobadlou, Manouchehr Mehman Navaz, Mahan Sedarat Madani, Mohammad Boroughani and Sahand Nourmohammad-Zadeh.
Astha Rajvanshi of Time Magazine reported that there were 15,915 protestors reported as detained, and 351 reported as killed, although these numbers can’t be verified due to reporting crackdowns in the country. She said that 227 of 290 members of the Iranian Parliament signed an open letter to the judiciary asking them to issue death sentences for the arrested protestors to “teach them a lesson” as “mohareb,” or “Enemies of God.” Despite such calls, the Parliament is not responsible for deciding these people’s fate — that’s up to the judiciary, and they have not issued a mass death sentence for all protestors. 
Amnesty International fears that other arrested protestors could receive the death penalty, considering the number of protestors and the corruption in Iran’s judicial system. David Gritten of BBC explained that detainees don’t have access to lawyers during interrogation, are tortured to give false confessions, and are sentenced based on those confessions, often under nebulous Sharia laws. Rajvanshi said that lawyers often cannot defend clients with political charges and face a litany of false accusations. He also said the judiciary is heavily influenced by intelligence agents and agents of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp when it comes to political and religious trials. 
Not all of the arrested protestors that have been sentenced have received the death penalty. Adam Pourahmadi of CNN reported that at least five others arrested during protests received lighter sentences of five to 10 years in prison for matters of “collusion to commit a crime against national security and disturbance of public peace and order.” He noted that over 1,000 protestors who have been charged, but the number is hard to verify considering reporting limits in Iran. 
Technically, no executions have taken place yet. Rajvanshi said that these are the preliminary sentences passed down from the courts, and that they can be appealed to the Supreme Court. However, he noted that Iran executes more people than any other country in the world on a per-capita basis and has the second-highest number of people executed of any nation, with 6,885 people executed since 2010.
Peter Kenyon of NPR explained that such actions by the Iranian government are occurring despite backlash from the international community in the form of sanctions against top Iran officials and Iranian media. Despite government crackdowns and arrests, protests are continuing into their third month.

Every Spring, elections for the Student Government are completed with the hope that the elected officials will represent the will of the students, and that they will have the power to be a force for positive change at CMU. This is only nominally true.
Student government at CMU consists of two legislative bodies and one executive branch. The Undergraduate Student Senate and Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) are the two legislative branches representing undergraduate and graduate students respectively. The elected members of the executive branch — which consists of the Student Body President (SBP) and Vice President (SBVP), Vice President for Organizations and Vice President for Finance — are intended to represent both populations. Within the executive branch exists the Student Government Executive Committee, which serves as the head of student government and consists of the Student Body President & Vice President and the heads of legislative branches, the GSA President & Student Senate Chair.
The idea of a jointly representative SBP and SBVP may be perhaps too idealistic and, in reality, fails to live up to its promise of accurate representation and strong advocacy of student issues. Therefore, the time has come to reassess this flawed structure of our student government. This has been a topic of debate for more than a decade, and over the last four years a working group composed of members from the Undergraduate Senate and GSA’s respective executive committees has been investigating this issue further.
Several of the recommendations made by iterations of this working group have been enacted over the last few years, and one recommendation remains: removing the positions of SBP and SBVP and instead elevating Senate Chair and GSA President as co-heads of student government.
We, the current Student Body President, Student Body Vice President, Undergraduate Student Senate Chair, and Graduate Student Assembly President, have come to the conclusion that this reform is in order and must now be implemented. We have two primary reasons: administrative efficiency and stronger representation.
First, efficiency. The purpose of an executive branch in a national or state government is to execute and enforce the law with different departments headed by different cabinet members, administering programs to that end. However, within student government, initiatives are typically spearheaded and run by Senate, GSA, and their respective committees, leaving little work to be done by an independent executive. There are clear merits to having such initiatives started by the legislative branches — not only does this ensure stability and preservation of efforts from year to year, but it also provides the opportunity to hear opinions from many more students given the direct line of communication between elected representatives in these bodies and their constituents.
Then, the issue of representation. It has become clear over the last several years that it is extremely difficult, or even impossible, for a single person to represent both undergraduate and graduate students. For at least the past decade, the SBP and SBVP have been undergraduate students. For most of these years, these elected students have primarily represented the interests of undergraduates and not those of graduates. This is not a condemnation of the students who have occupied these positions — it is rather a commentary on the structure that is bound to give rise to such an eventuality.
To expect an undergraduate student to accurately represent the views of the graduate student body, or vice versa, is unfair to the students occupying these positions. Undergraduates and graduates are distinct communities with distinct concerns and distinct networks and, as such, need distinct representation. These realities become very apparent during each election season through the candidates’ platforms and throughout their debates. These populations’ experiences are simply too disparate, to the point where even efforts to understand the alternate experience via discourse cannot bridge the gap.
Given this historical lack of graduate representation in the office of the SBP, graduate students have come to view the GSA President as their student government leader. On the other hand, undergraduate students look to the SBP as their primary changemaker and advocate. However, through several student government reforms passed in Senate and GSA over the last four years, the role of the SBP has diminished to the point where it is now largely ceremonial. This results in a mismatch in expectations; the individual whom undergrads view as their advocate does not actually have the capacity to advocate on their behalf.
Meanwhile, in practice, the GSA President serves as an advocate for all graduate students on campus, and the Undergraduate Senate Chair does the same for undergraduate students. Both these roles have more direct impact on issues that affect their constituents (take the hourly minimum wage increase — an initiative started by the Senate — or the recently established minimum stipends and full healthcare coverage for Ph.D. students — an initiative of the GSA). This reform will put on paper what already happens in practice and provide more clear mechanisms for change to students — especially undergrads.
We — the Student Government Executive Committee — are issuing this joint statement, as we believe this reform is much needed in order to better represent ALL Carnegie Mellon students and will allow for better communication and collaboration between different parts of campus. Placing the heads of the Undergraduate Student Senate and the Graduate Student Assembly at the helm of a dual executive will improve efficiency, guarantee equity for undergraduates and graduates, and put our student government in a position where it can be a strong and successful advocate for all students.
The Undergraduate Student Senate will be hosting a town hall during their Dec. 1st General Body Meeting at 5 p.m. in the UC Danforth Conference Room, where we will present our proposed reforms in more detail. The Graduate Student Assembly will do the same during their Dec. 7th General Body Meeting at 5 p.m. in Tepper Simmons A. We hope to see many of you there!

Since the beginning of the pandemic, my mom and I have given blood to the American Red Cross. A fun family bonding activity, right? 
I hadn’t donated blood in a while, so when I saw that the Cohon University Center was having a blood drive, I thought to myself, “Wow, I should go give blood again!” Then I remembered the thing that frustrates me every time: the blatant homophobia in the blood donation system.
For those of you who've never given blood, there is some variation of a question that all participants are asked: “Have you had sexual contact with a male in the last three months?” if you are male or “Have you had sexual contact with a man who has had sexual contact with a male in the last three months?” if you are female.
In 1983, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) — who determine eligibility for blood donations — imposed a blood donation ban on men who have sex with men (MSM). This wasn’t updated until 2015, when the FDA altered their MSM policy to allow those who hadn’t had sex with another man in the past year. This was again updated to 90 days at the start of the pandemic due to one of the biggest blood shortages in nearly a decade.
The 1983 ban on MSM donations was triggered by the HIV Epidemic of the '80s that disproportionately affected gay men. During that time, one in nine gay men was diagnosed with AIDS and one in fifteen died. Between the years of 1987 and 1998, AIDS claimed the lives of over 320,000 men and women in the United States. 
According to the United Nation's website regarding HIV and AIDS, 54 percent of those alive in 2021 with HIV or AIDS were women and girls. A 2016 data set from the CDC estimated 77 percent of those living with HIV or AIDS in the U.S. were men; the U.S. rate is still higher than worldwide. From that data set, 62 percent of those with AIDS or HIV had some sort of male-to-male sexual contact. 
AIDS/HIV is no longer the death sentence it once was. Medications like PrEP greatly lower the risk of contracting AIDS from sexual contact or injection, and FDA-approved medications give those who are HIV-positive a longer, more “normal” life.  
So is discrimination against MSM justifiable? I don’t think so. While gay men are 28 times more likely to contract HIV than adult men as a whole, I don’t believe this is enough evidence to maintain discriminatory policies. In 2021, 88 percent of people who had HIV knew their status. I expect that most MSM understand the risk associated with having sex with other men; if not, then that’s another reason why the HIV and AIDS epidemic needs to be taught in schools. 
But more importantly, there is no increased risk in letting MSM donate blood in modern times. When the rules were initially relaxed for blood donations from MSM, there was no reported increase of HIV detection in blood donations. Additionally, technological advances have made it so HIV is detectable in samples regardless of the donor’s sexuality. With current detection methods, there is less than one per-unit risk per million of HIV from transfusion-transmission. 
But if you fall into the category of MSM, please be smart about blood donations. If you engage in high-risk behavior, please ensure you have a negative status before donating blood. Your decisions should not result in compromising someone else’s health, even if you’re trying to do something good. While PrEP and antiretroviral therapy (ART) suppress the HIV virus, they don't eradicate the virus — donations could still result in transmission. If you’re taking PrEP or ART, take into consideration that you may be engaging in high risk behaviors and may not be a suitable candidate for blood donation. 
Being gay isn’t a high risk behavior. Having sex with a large number of people is. Instead of asking if a donor has had sex with someone who falls into the MSM category, wording should be more focused on the engagement of high-risk behavior. Under current rules, a man in a monogamous relationship with another man can’t donate, and is supposedly of the same risk factor as a woman who engages in sexual behavior with a large number of male partners. I think any sensible person can clearly recognize that one of these cases is a higher risk activity, but the FDA seems to disagree. 
On a more positive note, the Red Cross, Vitalant, and One Blood (the three largest blood donation centers in the U.S.) have launched the ADVANCE Study in an effort to change the FDA’s three-month deferral period. The study plans to conclude by the end of 2022; the information will then be delivered to the FDA, where the results will be made publicly available. 
I hope there comes a day in the near future where I’m not faced with discriminatory questions when donating blood. If there is as much of a blood shortage as all these emails I am bombarded with lead me to believe, then all those who are safe to give blood should be able.

World Cup is interesting, to say the least. It’s a time when a country full of (American) football, basketball, and baseball fans come together to care about soccer for a month. For most people, this is about all the soccer they can handle. It seems that for most Americans, soccer is a zero sum game — there is only so much attention to be thrown around. I find this extremely disappointing, especially when this phenomenon rears its ugly head in the form of men’s vs. women’s soccer, and more specifically, who deserves attention and who doesn’t.
For the last eight years, the U.S. has been graced with a fantastic women’s team, one that has dominated the game to such an extent that we’re almost desensitized to victory. Stars like Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan are household names now, representing tremendous progress following a long span of perceived dormancy in women’s soccer. This team has held the spotlight in a way that the men’s team has not, and for that reason many people don’t feel compelled to follow the men’s game. This, I feel, is a failure of the modern rhetoric surrounding soccer in America.
In the last eight or so years, the discussion of American soccer has largely centered around the men vs. women, particularly in terms of pay inequality. The dream-like success of the women compared to the lackluster 2014-2018 campaign for the men only highlighted this disparity, to the point that relative quality has become a talking point in the larger discussion. Many will say that the women perform better than the men, others will say that the men face greater competition, etc. This is a fundamentally unproductive conversation.
I understand why many women (and some men) are so dismissive of the U.S. Men’s National Team (USMNT). Circling back to the central issue, soccer in America is currently a zero sum game. There is also the simple reality that for women to be paid more, they have to be watched more. Given these facts, it makes total sense why it would be advantageous to disparage the men and further praise the women. What I think this approach misses, however, is that such rhetoric confines the conversation. The country’s dialogue becomes entwined, trapped in the tit-for-tat debate of who’s better and who’s worse. As a result, there is no room for growth as a unified country, because as soon as the men begin outperforming the women, the pendulum will swing, and years of progress will be for nothing. This is not the outcome anyone wants.
For example, take an often cited example in women’s soccer, when in 2017 the U.S. Women’s National Team (USWNT) lost to FC Dallas U-15 boys 2-5 in a scrimmage. Many (mostly men) have referenced this match to “prove” that the men are better than the women, and that therefore, the women are not worth watching. This is exactly the rhetoric that needs to stop. Comparing the two teams is obviously apples to oranges, so the only meaningful discussion is how we can promote both teams simultaneously, without disparaging one to praise another. I do not care that the women are more successful than the men, or that the men will likely never reach the women’s level of success. I also do not care that the men would beat the women head to head. Neither is relevant. We need to move past these archaic talking points.
The World Cup began on the 20th. On the 21st, the USMNT played their first game of the tournament against Wales. Just days later, they face off against England in one of the group stage’s most anticipated matchups. On the 21st, 25th, and all subsequent games, I hope to see the country rallied behind our boys. We have one of the youngest rosters going to Qatar, and our team arguably has the greatest potential it’s ever had to make a deep run in the tournament. Furthermore, the World Cup comes to the U.S. in 2026, at which point this same group will be in their prime. Long story short, there’s a lot to look forward to for the USMNT.
I imagine there will be some who are not convinced. Maybe it’s just too difficult to muster support for the USMNT. To that point, it’s a largely unknown team to the average American, and their recent successes have received little to no coverage, so I say, fair enough. But there are other reasons to watch the World Cup. There are easily over a dozen teams with star-studded rosters, two of which boast the two biggest names in soccer today: Messi and Ronaldo. Both players look to cap off their already untouchable careers with one last World Cup run, one that could see either of them cemented as the undisputed greatest of all time.
I think here I really want to advocate for breadth of knowledge with respect to soccer. In the women’s game, for example, Alexia Putellas has won two back-to-back Ballon D’ors, establishing herself as the current greatest women’s player around. That said, virtually nobody in America knows who she is. Soccer is such an expansive sport, to the point that around the world there are countless other Megan Rapinoes and Alex Morgans. If it’s too hard to support the U.S. men and women simultaneously, then fine. But if you aren’t already planning to, then I urge you to tune in to this World Cup, watch some games and get a taste for the world’s game.
When this article is published, the tournament will already be underway. I will soon be home, donning my U.S. jersey, ready to watch what I hope will be a historic World Cup run. Yes, it’s highly unlikely we will win. But there is a lot of glory to be found short of winning it all. Plus, we Americans love our underdog stories, and this tournament is no different. We are young. We are hungry. We believe. And just as the women did, twice, in the last eight years, I hope to see our boys parading around the country, carrying the cup. If that’s not enough for you, I don’t know what is.

You are once again privileged to read one of my hot takes. Where I get the energy to write these, nobody knows — all I can say is that this is where I earn my writing chops before I pivot into a YouTube video essay channel, the success of which I will leverage into becoming a cult leader. But until such time, here are my thoughts on fitness culture. 
I go to the gym, but I don't want to be a fascist. This is quite the irreconcilable conundrum for many social media algorithms, which frequently encourage me to consume very fashy content. "Oh, you watched Jeff Nippard's video on the ideal push/pull/legs split? You seem like just the guy to watch a video titled Reject Modernity, Embrace Masculinity, Reject Weakness, Embrace Strength, where we belittle young men who dress alternatively." 
See, my point is that I'm not like the other boys. Unlike everybody else who goes to the gym, I'm actually super woke and leftist, and I know terms like "gender performance.” 
Gender performance is the idea that your behavior and personality are defined by a desire to fulfill a particular construction of masculinity or femininity. To be clear, "performing masculinity" does not necessarily mean you're being toxically masculine. This idea tells us that the social concept of gender is ingrained so deeply that you may feel the need to perform it even when nobody's looking because gender performance permeates our sense of self. I often wonder how much of my decision to lift is wrapped up in a desire to perform masculinity. I'd like to believe I work out for better reasons, but I think anybody who lifts should scrutinize their reasoning.
If you watched the “embracing masculinity” video I referenced earlier (which has 1.1 million views and very positive engagement in the comments), the author strongly implies that they're speaking truth to an overwhelming tide of anti-lifter sentiment. As someone who frequently spends time with libs, communist sympathizers, and pronoun-havers, I can confidently say that this is a fictional strawman. Nobody has ever discouraged me from going to the gym, and I suspect that any true anti-lifter advocates are much smaller in number than this video would have you believe.
But this is merely a common element of fascist rhetoric. There needs to be some nebulous enemy attacking your way of life to justify your measures. By supposing that feminists are overwhelmingly anti-lifter, you can easily refute this (non-existent) argument by pointing out the benefits of exercise — as many comments on that video do. Thus, you can safely ignore any arguments from these people — especially those that might challenge your conception of gender — and fall deeper into the YouTube redpill-manosphere ecosystem.
I've observed that a large portion of gym-related content online skews in a very right-wing direction. Such content is a unique flavor of fashy, usually originating with standard conservative traditionalism, with forays into new-age health and wellness pseudoscience, dashes of Proud Boy-adjacent ideas like NoFap (don't ask), and sometimes even touching on incel rhetoric about women and relationships. It's disheartening, especially considering that often, new lifters are insecure teenage boys who are susceptible to content that affirms their masculinity. It's devious but unsurprising; if you can hook that audience in with some video about "embracing strength,” you can probably hold their attention longer by suggesting increasingly extreme content. 
In a media ecosystem where male actors dehydrate themselves so their bicep veins are still visible underneath their superhero costume, I think many young men go to the gym simply because of body insecurity. As common as this may be, I think it's an inherently unsustainable reason to go. As said by the philosopher Casually Explained, "Lifting is not just a hobby, it's a journey. And that journey often begins with feelings of inadequacy, and ends with feelings of inadequacy but now you can't wear jeans.” This mindset — and the culture that surrounds it — is why right-wing gym content does so well in these circles. 
In conclusion, don't watch these kinds of videos on YouTube. Read my articles instead, because I have great opinions. Maybe even come to the gym with me. We can talk about Andrew Tate's harmful rhetoric while we do squats, and perhaps we can all learn something.

Novel-tea is The Tartan’s literary and language opinion column, so if you like hot takes and reading about cool ideas in the literary community then this is the place for you!! If you have your own hot take to add to this column, do not hesitate to contact us.
Walking into a bookstore, I used to only glance at the nonfiction sections on my way to devour fiction, romance, poetry, etc. I thought that past the middle-grade level, nonfiction became a pretentious, difficult-to-read genre only meant for class assignments and hyperfixations. That was until last semester — when the stars aligned and my professors began assigning me what I refer to as “down-to-earth” nonfiction.
Down-to-earth nonfiction is any nonfiction book that still prioritizes formulating interesting, engaging, and cohesive narratives rather than simply exploring an idea in formal, widely inaccessible language in which your average reader spends approximately 30 minutes trying to understand a single sentence.
Growing up, one of my best friends hated fiction. She found it too suspenseful and preferred to pour over theory, which I found completely indigestible. She always wanted me to join her, but it was hard to convince myself to read those books in my free time — particularly as I wanted to read the things that made me insatiable for more, not the books that made me rethink my decision to keep reading after every word. I associated theory and nonfiction with boredom and frustration, and I cut myself off from that area of the literary world.
However, I have always had a penchant for history, and last spring I decided I wanted to explore Carnegie Mellon’s Global Studies program. Through this department, with special credit to Professor Emanuela Grama, I was introduced to a variety of compelling nonfiction that I absolutely devoured. Books like Chip Colwell’s “Plundered Skulls and Stolen Spirits” or Lauret Savoy’s “Trace” are not merely nonfiction investigations into history, but deeply intimate portraits of their narrators who uncover and analyze both various truths about the world and the consequences of those truths.
These books are both informative and deeply moving as they allow readers to actually connect with history. Additionally, they are written with language that is much more accessible than what is typically ascribed to nonfiction, allowing your average Joe to engage with discussions previously reserved for “elite” academics. These stories manage to be both scholarly and easily readable — a major feat for the genre.
Of course, there is nothing wrong with fiction, and this is not meant to disparage fiction’s immense contributions or to say that reading silly little books for fun is “less than.” But, this is to say that I am encouraged by nonfiction that attempts to connect with a wider audience and makes information accessible. When information is humanized, it makes for more empathetic readers and communities. Literature has such power to connect with people — power that is often lost by the desire to be perceived as scholarly. That is why “down-to-earth” nonfiction is so special: the genre manages to be full of academic, respected texts that are also readable and enjoyable.

The Student Government Executive Committee announced a reform to improve Carnegie Mellon’s student government by removing the Student Body President (SBP) and Student Body Vice President (SBVP) postions. Instead, the Undergraduate Student Senate Chair and the Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) President would be co-heads of student government. The Tartan Editorial Board supports the initiative. We believe it will have an overwhelmingly positive impact on the workings of our student government.
Currently, the Student Government Executive Committee (which acts as the head of student government) includes the SBP and SBVP, and the two heads of the legislative branches of Student Government: the GSA President and Student Senate Chair. The key issue with this arrangement is that the SBP and SBVP are supposed to represent the whole of the student body when the positions are typically occupied only by undergraduate students. 
This leads to a slew of misunderstandings as to which position does what. While many students believe that the SBP is  the undergraduate’s advocate, reforms over time have made the role of the SBP a bit more like a figurehead. It is actually the Undergraduate Senate Chair who has the most impact on the issues of undergraduate students. The role of Senate Chair is similar to the GSA President who, in practice, advocates for all graduate students with direct impact on graduate reforms rather than the office of the SBP.
Removing the SBP and SBVP will allow for clearer positions and an executive committee with a direct line to impacting the various communities of the student body. It will also improve communication as students will know who their representative is, and that representative will have the power to address their concerns.
This change has been long in the making, as the lack of representation for graduate students in the office of the SBP has proved to inaccurately address the needs of the graduate student body as those in positions just do not have the experience with that community. Furthermore, the Senate and the GSA both initiate their own reforms within their committees to address the student body’s largest concerns, which makes the executive obsolete. If anything, the executive has become more of a formal barrier than a body to promote efficient change — as that change is usually addressed in the respective legislative bodies.
Additionally, the Senate Chair and GSA President are required to be much more in touch with student government policy and decision making than the SBP and SBVP. Senate Chair and GSA President are internally elected from their respective organizations, whereas SBP and SBVP are voted on by the entire student body. As such, there is no guarantee that those elected to SBP and SBVP will even have the proper credentials or experience to competently hold the positions. Having Senate Chair and GSA serving as co-heads of student government ensures familiarity with student government procedures and policy — something necessary for such an important position.
But due to the nature of Senate and GSA, the general student body cannot choose who represents them. Senate members are voted on by college members and GSA members are selected at the program level. But both Senate and GSA always seem to have some number of vacancies. This is a reflection of the average student’s apathy — a majority of students have no interest in student government affairs. This is the unfortunate reality; the Senate and GSA make many decisions that affect the student body. Students should be more invested in student government because they are the ones who have the power to enact change. But given the current atmosphere surrounding student government, it makes sense to move the power to select the heads of student government to the people who do actually care: the members of Senate and GSA.
The Tartan commends the Student Government Executive Committee for conducting this assessment and proposing a change that will positively effect our Student Government.
