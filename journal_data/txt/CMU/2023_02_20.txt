Meanwhile, sophomore Sean Dutton took third in the 800-meter run with a time of 1:59.78 while first-year Saaketh Nandakumar took ninth with a time of 2:03.94. Sophomore Jacob Kelly placed sixth in the 60-meter dash with a time of 7.04. Kelly also placed third in the 200-meter dash, crossing in 23.05. In the 400-meter run, sophomore Alexander Palmer’s 53.47 earned him seventh place. Sophomore Micah Nowlin finished fifth in the 60-meter hurdles after he crossed the line in 8.78. On the field, first-year Christian Duckworth took sixth in the pole vault after clearing the bar at 4.47 meters.
The Tartans will next be traveling to Brandeis University to compete in the UAA Championships on Saturday, Feb. 25 and Sunday, Feb. 26.
Women’s Track and Field
The Carnegie Mellon women’s track and field team headed to the Penn State University Tune-Up on Friday, Feb. 17 and the Mount Union Tune-Up on Saturday, Feb. 18.
Senior Liz Barre placed in a number of events at Penn State, along with many other Tartans. In the long jump, she marked 5.44 to win the event. She also took fifth in the high jump after clearing the bar at 1.65 meters and third in the 60-meter hurdles after she recorded a time of 8.89. Sophomore Katie Monahan took fourth in the shot put after her throw of 12.15 meters. In the mile run, senior Mona Yuan, graduate student Kristen Seballos, and senior Kavya Tummalapalli finished ninth, tenth, and eleventh, respectively, with times of 5:14.95, 5:17.78, and 5:19.02. Sophomore Alyssa Hoffman finished ninth in the 3,000-meter run after recording a time of 10:29.08. 
A number of Tartans also placed at the Mount Union Tune-Up. First-year Jacqueline Liu claimed victory in the 800-meter run with a meet-record time of 2:22.91. In the 3,000-meter race, sophomore Norah Czajka took fourth with her time of 11:15.64. In the 400-meter race, junior Emily Lannen crossed the line in 1:03.54, taking ninth. In the 60-meter hurdles, first-year Iniyaa Mohanraj placed eighth with a time of 10.00. Mohanraj also placed fifth in the triple jump with a mark of 10.23. Also in the triple jump, senior Serena Li marked 9.55 meters, taking ninth place.
The Tartans will next be competing on Saturday, Feb. 25 and Sunday, Feb. 26 when they travel to Brandeis University to compete in the UAA Championships. 
Men’s Basketball
The men’s basketball team traveled to the Windy City this past Friday, Feb. 17 to take on the University of Chicago in a conference matchup.
The Maroons took an early lead over the Tartans, 10-8. Chicago would then go on a 9-3 run to pull ahead of the Tartans just seven minutes into the game, 19-11. The next eight points, however, belonged to the Tartans thanks to five points from first-year Buckley DeJardin and a triple from sophomore Aidan Murphy. This tied the score at 19 with just under 11 minutes to go in the first half. Carnegie Mellon seized this opportunity and took the next 13 points, making it 32-19 with 6:15 left in the first half. Chicago answered this run with 13 to the Tartans’ two with two minutes left, but Carnegie Mellon still held the lead going into the break, 38-37.
Coming out of the break, the lead continually changed hands. Chicago was able to pull ahead of the Tartans with 16:35 left in play, 52-44. The Tartans struggled to keep up in the next three minutes, with the Maroons scoring 13 more to the Tartans’ four. But after some Tartan scoring, the Maroon lead was narrowed to 10 with seven minutes left in play. However, Chicago sunk a few more points, and at the end of the game, the scoreboard read 85-71 in favor of the home team. 
After this performance, the men’s basketball team fell to 15-8 on the season and 7-5 in the conference. Their last regular season game will be Saturday, Feb. 25 in Wiegand Gymnasium for a 3:00 p.m. tipoff. 
Women’s Basketball
The Carnegie Mellon Women’s Basketball team traveled to the University of Chicago this Friday, Feb. 17 to take on the 18th-ranked Maroons.
In the first quarter, the Tartans were able to pull ahead of the Maroons thanks to a strong floor game. They shot 62.5 percent in the quarter and scored eight off Maroon turnovers, giving them a 24-17 at the end of the first. Thanks to the efforts of sophomore Catherine Or — who claimed seven of the first nine Tartan points in the second quarter — the Tartans held a 12-point lead with 6:46 left in the second quarter, which was later extended to 17. However, the Maroons cut this to nine with only 14 seconds left in the first half. But thanks to an Or bucket, the Tartans entered the half 11 points in the lead, 44-33.
Coming back, the Tartans still held their lead, but were outscored 15-11 in the third quarter. The Tartans didn’t score many points until a 7-0 run in the last two minutes of the quarter.  So as the Tartans were entering the fourth quarter, the board read 55-48. In the fourth quarter, Carnegie Mellon was up 13 at one point, but Chicago clawed their way back and tied the score with eight seconds to go. Though Or completed a layup after this, the Maroons answered with one of their own, sending the game into overtime. At one point, the Tartans held the lead in overtime, but the home team ultimately prevailed, 84-78. 
This loss moved the women’s basketball team to 11-12 on the season and 2-10 in conference play. Their last regular season game will be Saturday, Feb. 25 against Case Western Reserve at home for a 1:00 p.m. start. 
Men’s Tennis
This past Saturday, Feb. 18, the Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team hosted Division II West Virginia Wesleyan College at the Greensburg Racquet Club. 
In doubles play, only one Tartan pair were able to take home points. The pairing of senior Jonathan Nottingham and first-year Sebastien Lhuiller won their match 8-5, making the Tartans 1-2 in doubles. In singles, the Tartans went 2-4. Senior Raahil Doshi took home the first Tartan point in the third slot, winning his sets 6-3, 6-1. First-year Akshay Joshi took the other Tartan win in the five slot, going 6-4, 7-5 in his sets. Overall, the Tartans fell to Wesleyan 6-3, which puts them 1-2 on the session.
The team will next be taking on St. Francis University at home on Friday, Feb. 24. 
Women’s Tennis
The 11th-ranked Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team took on 26th-ranked Denison University this past Saturday, Feb. 18. 
The Tartans swept the doubles, earning three points. The pair of sophomore Zoe Angell and sophomore Sarah Yang went 8-2, the pair of first-years Anna Chow and Divya Venkatarama went 8-5, and the pair of senior Danna Taylor and sophomore Crystal Zhou went 8-6. Those competing in the singles also swept, with sophomore Sarah Yang winning her sets 6-3, 6-2. Taylor also competed in singles, winning her sets 6-4, 6-3. Zhou won her sets handily, 6-2, 6-1. Venkatarama lost her first set 3-6, but came back to win the match. Angell also won her singles match, 604, 6-1. first-year Manuela Van Cotthem cleaned up for the Tartans, 7-5, 6-2. This 9-0 victory for the Tartans has put them at 5-1 for the year.
The team will next be competing against the College of Wooster and Otterbein University on Saturday, Feb. 25 at the Aspen Racquet Club in Wooster, Ohio.

Damar Hamlin, NFL defensive back for the Buffalo Bills, sat down with ABC News last week for his first interview since his on-field collapse on Jan. 3. During the opening quarter of a game against the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 17, Hamlin took a solid blow to the chest while bringing down a wide receiver, causing a sudden and unanticipated heart failure. Millions of football fans watched as Hamlin abruptly fainted on national television, with fellow players on the turf looking on, shocked and distressed.
Six weeks later, Hamlin was ready to talk, but still hesitant to dive into particular subjects. He found himself unable to acutely describe experiences and feelings from the moments surrounding the collapse, or to express just what conversations with his doctors have looked like since. When asked to share what doctors said had happened to him, Hamlin gave a long pause before saying that topic was one he wanted to “stay away from.”
Hamlin was instead mainly focused on sharing gratitude. He thanked the paramedics and team doctors, who had quickly administered CPR to restore his heartbeat, and for the support of his teammates. He also gave his appreciation for the family who stuck by his side during his time in the Cincinnati ICU.
When Hamlin was brought into the UC medical center, doctors considered commotio cordis a possible cause of his collapse, a rare phenomenon in which a direct blow to the chest at a precise moment in the heart pattern can trigger cardiac arrest. Sudden death by commotio cordis has been reported in sports such as baseball and lacrosse, where a ball struck at the heart can cause it to stop pumping, but is exceedingly uncommon in contact sports like football. It most likely that the Bengal running downfield, lowering his right shoulder, struck Hamlin in the chest at the exact wrong time, producing the sudden and violent reaction that could have killed him within minutes if not attended to.
How does Hamlin feel about his current condition? Physically, he is glad to be like his old self again, grateful to have pulled through the ordeal “almost without a scratch.” His mental and emotional recovery is still in the process, however. Hamlin had a lot of trouble reliving the moment he collapsed. Hamlin says he’s still working through the “emotions and trauma” from the event, watching replays of the moment he fainted in-game in an attempt to understand what happened. It remains a traumatic event for himself his team, and those present and watching, and will take time to heal.
However, some controversy has arose around the event, and the safety of the NFL. While the NFL is no stranger to concerns around the health of its athletes, watching someone essentially lose their heartbeat live on air has put a lot of new questions into the air. While it's definitely true that Hamlin’s interview silence around these weighty topics is a natural reaction to such a disturbing event being resurfaced, some critics have characterized his pensive silence as refusal, even taking it as evidence of bribery from the League to stay quiet. Suspicion is spreading online, some linking Hamlin’s alleged denial with vaccine disinformation and other skeptical notions.
Online conspiracy continued to abound after last Sunday’s Super Bowl, where Hamlin made an appearance on the field among the EMTs who responded to his emergency. A fringe of Twitter has claimed Hamlin was replaced by a body double, a theory that spread shortly after his post-recovery reappearance on social media and was sustained after last week. Numerous news sources have debunked the claim.
​​Following his return to Buffalo, Hamlin felt impelled to give back what he could to the world after his near-fatal incident. He established an initiative with the American Heart Association last month to impact and educate, promoting CPR training and cardiac health awareness. His work won him this year’s Alan Page award for community service, the NFL Players Association’s highest honor
The medical director of the NFLPA has claimed Hamlin is “guaranteed” to make a return to the football field. A “long road” remains in front of him, said Hamlin, but that coming back to play is “always the goal.” Doctors described his recovery as nothing short of miraculous. Waking up from his hospital bed, the first thing Hamlin wanted to know was whether the Bills had won the game, his self-attributed “competitive nature” kicking in. The response he heard? Play might not have carried on, but Hamlin had assuredly “won the game of life.”

Editor’s Note: The views of this author do not reflect the views of the Tartan as a whole.
It’s been five years since the Philadelphia Eagles won their first Super Bowl; a victory that ended in rioting and violence, with fires, car-flipping, and pole-climbing galore. Philly was just showing its love for its team by… uhh… giving them an incentive never to win again, apparently.
Yep, I think I’ve cracked the code. The Philadelphia Eagles were paid off by Mayor Jim Kenney to throw the game just to make sure property damage stayed low. My source? Look, this is the sports section, we don’t do sources here. 
It’s a pretty surprising end to the franchise's run to the Super Bowl this year, with Jalen Hurts posting a 14-1 record as a starter, and two dominant wins against the notable high school rugby team the San Francisco 49ers, and the New York Giants, who are perfect and amazing and I love them. The pregame broadcasts bet it all on them winning, by anywhere from three to 10 points. The city put its faith in the Philadelphia Phillies to win the World Ser-
Wait a second, this is the Super Bowl. Football. What does the World Series have to do with it?
Well, this is Philadelphia’s second major championship loss in the 2022-2023 sports season, after a 4-2 series loss against Houston in the Fall Classic. For those of you who are Philly haters (godspeed, I support you wholeheartedly), Philly also lost the Major League Soccer cup to LA this year. Thank god — could you imagine Philadelphia becoming a soccer city? 
Honestly, I think it's deserved. If you spent any time watching the commentators talk about Philly, you’d know that Jalen Hurts benched 600 pounds one time in college! And did you know he went to Alabama! And that he benched 600 pounds! That’s like, so many pounds! I, personally, cannot bench 600 pounds, but you know who can? Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts. 
As much as people suck off Patrick “Muppet of the Week” Mahomes, at least he, y’know, won. A lot. Against good teams! That seems to be the defining trait that Philly fanboys forgot — the Eagles beat the easiest regular season schedule, lost both games that Hurts wasn’t starting in, and then proceeded to beat a rebuilding Giants team (but still amazing and perfect, go G-men), and a San Francisco team that couldn’t use the forward pass. The amount of shit talk you heard from the Eagles was genuinely surprising considering they ain’t played no one Pawwwwwwwl. The vaunted number one defense in the country couldn’t perform a single stop in the second half against a one-legged Mahomes. The pass rush that was supposed to tear up KC’s O-line didn’t ever approach a sack. The team that everyone bet on turned out to be the pretenders that all the real experts (me and a guy called Harry) had said all along.
Look, I know I come off like I hate Philly. That’s because I’m a Giants fan, and this is the only joy we’ve gotten since Eli Manning. So lemme take what wins I get okay? And to be honest, Philly did show class in losing. Many people (me, mostly) were expecting Philadelphia to go up in flames, and we were pleasantly surprised Philadelphia only threw a few fireworks, and flipped maybe one car. Bravo Philadelphia, you’re getting used to losing. Just in time for the 76ers to lose in the conference semifinals. Again.
Damn, that city has been going through the wringer when it comes to their sports.
Point and laugh. Point. And. Cackle. 
Philly has lost so much that they’ve become numb to it. The city just sat in shock. They protested, they cheered for their team, they shouted, "F*** THE CHIEFS," but all in all, it was tepid.
Philly ended their season not with a bang, but with a whimper, not once, not twice, but three times.
But hey, there’s always next year!

On Jan. 26, researchers from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Maastricht University published a paper titled “Indoor Air Quality and Strategic Decision Making.” The study focuses on comparing readings from air-quality monitors to the quality of 30,000 moves in a chess tournament. 
The paper begins by discussing the importance of strategic decision-making in the workplace, problem-solving, and critical-thinking skills. The authors discuss the potential of air pollution negatively affecting cognitive performance. While a negative link has been theorized between air quality and strategic decision-making, there has previously been little experimental evidence that confirms this theory. 
The data contains information on more than 30,000 moves from 121 chess players in 609 official matches in three official tournaments in Germany between 2017 and 2019. Each tournament was comprised of seven rounds that were played over a period of eight weeks. During this time, there were a number of fluctuations in the air quality, so the researchers had data spanning a variety of environments.
The researchers then analyzed all the moves that these players made using Stockfish, an open-source artificial intelligence chess engine. Stockfish evaluated all the moves that these players made and compared them against the “optimal” move that Stockfish would have made. This evaluation was completely independent of the player’s opponent and previous moves of the player. The players also had an incentive to perform well, so it was believed that players were performing what they considered to be the “best” move. 
For measuring the air quality of the playing environment, the researchers installed three air quality sensors inside the tournament venue, which continuously recorded the environmental conditions. Their measure of air quality was based on the concentration of PM2.5, which is fine particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers. PM2.5 can be inhaled and enter deep into the lungs and bloodstream, which introduces well-documented risks to the human body. This ultimately may affect performance or influence behavior, hence this study.
The study found that an increase in PM2.5 concentrations indoors significantly worsened the ability of chess players to select the optimal move. When PM2.5 concentrations increase by 10 micrograms per cubic meter (a significant deviation from normal), there was a 2.1 percent increase in players making a “meaningful” error. This corresponded to an increase of 26.3 percent relative to the average proportion of error in the researchers’ sample. 
Additionally, the researchers were able to study the effects of PM2.5 concentrations when players were under time pressure. Chess players had a fixed amount of time allotted to them for their first 40 moves, and the effects of PM2.5 were found to be the most pronounced before the time control at move 40. This indicated to the researchers that poor air quality harms the performance of players when acting under time pressure. Another analysis revealed that weaker players were more affected by the poorer air quality. 
As part of the study, the researchers documented the role of outdoor pollution in shaping indoor conditions. They concluded that variation in the indoor PM reflects the air pollution in the outdoor area surrounding the tournament site. Using this data, they found similar performance drops as they saw in their indoor measurements, which suggested the effects were a result of particulate pollution rather than other sources. 
The researchers also performed a replication exercise in which they studied move-quality data from Chess Bundesliga, the top national chess league in Germany. They compared outdoor PM pollution measurements from 2003 to 2019 and found the same results: When there are more air pollutants, there is a significant and sizable increase in the likelihood of making “meaningful” mistakes, especially in the part of the game proceeding time control. 
The researchers concluded that their findings have important implications for firms and policy. They stated that their results highlight the benefits of investing in building infrastructure to reduce PM concentrations. The researchers advise that this is especially important for improving the quality of strategic decisions made by high-skill workers under high levels of time stress.

Galileo Galilei placed his polished glass lenses into their frames, careful not to cause a single scratch. He took a breath in anticipation and looked into one end, the other angled towards the sky. He readied his notebooks for his discoveries and gazed towards Jupiter. 
Little did he know, that was the day humanity first took steps towards the stars. The questions his little invention brought about and the images seen through that telescope, were the beginnings of an ongoing journey whose most recent chapter is the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), more powerful than anything ever used before. It’s the pinnacle of telescopic power, and it floats in Earth’s orbit, looking into the sky for answers to questions we never knew we'd be able to answer.
The telescope was launched in December 2021 and was evaluated to operate for five to 10 years. That range of years is pretty fluid considering the Hubble Telescope, originally rated for 15 years, has continued operations to this day, 33 years since its launch. JWST was the product of almost 30 years of work by a team of scientists, with numerous delays and $10 billion allocated towards the program. After its launch, and a few months of work while in orbit, JWST returned the first images, and scientists were ecstatic. JWST captured the birth of stars and the formation of celestial titans in the gas and dust of the Pillars of Creation. It’s a process that has been described in millions of middle school science textbooks, but having the images, having the concrete data to point to, is amazing. 
The telescope also captured amazing images of the Phantom Galaxy, a low-brightness galaxy that lies almost face-on to Earth. The images found are beautiful, clearly highlighting the spiral structure of the galaxy, with star clusters, clouds of gas, dust, and supernovae easily visible for anyone and everyone to see. 
But perhaps the crown jewel of them all was JWST’s first glimpses of the oldest galaxies in the universe. The creation of the universe has been a mystery for so long, the moments after the Big Bang only theorized upon by quantum physicists, and the eons after still just out of reach of our observations. But with James Webb, those first galaxies were spotted, formed only 350 million years after the Big Bang. If the universe was 19, those galaxies would have formed when it was only five months old.
There are more stars to discover and more phenomena to observe, and pages upon pages of images and data. There are mysteries yet to be discovered, from the strange ripples surrounding the Wolf-Rayet star, to the weird and wonderful shapes of the Southern Ring Nebula. Images of galaxies colliding and of planets millions of miles away are the new frontier for astronomy, and JWST has just finished its first year up there. We don’t know what more might come, what more discoveries could be waiting for us.
There’s a saying, one I heard at a convention years ago. Knowledge is like an island, whose shoreline is the questions that remain to be asked. And every time your island grows a little bit, the water recedes, and the shoreline gets longer. New questions, new discoveries to be made. Each one just leads you to another shoreline, another question. The more you grow your island, the more there is left for you to discover.
James Webb is on humanity’s shoreline, and NASA has invited us all to take a deeper look. JWST data is publicly accessible — I’d encourage you to go to the coast and explore for yourself.

This article contains spoilers for “Ant Man & The Wasp: Quantumania”
What is the point of the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s (MCU) Phase 4? I honestly couldn’t tell you at this point, and I don’t think “Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania” could either. Don’t get me wrong, I did enjoy the movie, but the people in the MCU writing room need to step up their game. 
One of the things I like about Scott Lang (Ant-Man, played by Paul Rudd) in the MCU is that he is just a guy, and that’s one of my favorite flavors of superhero (see: Moon Knight, Starlord). I liked “Ant-Man” and “Ant-Man & The Wasp” (though I probably wouldn’t put them in my top five MCU movies and shows) but I wouldn’t give that same consideration to “Quantumania” for several reasons.
The first is that the writing bugged me in a lot of ways. For instance, why did Janet van Dyne never tell the rest of the gang what happened in the quantum realm?! I get that she “wanted to forget,” but you don’t just leave a guy who has destroyed multiple universes without telling anyone. So much of this movie could have been avoided if Janet had just mentioned Kang’s existence and his goal. 
Also, why does almost every teenager in the MCU have to be a genius? I know that it’s part of some of their characters (like Shuri and Ironheart), but I don’t feel like there was a reason for Cassie (Scott Lang’s daughter, played by Kathryn Newton) to work with quantum technology. I can forgive the writers for giving her a suit (she does eventually become a hero in the comics), but making her a quantum genius screams subpar writing. I think there was so much more to do in her writing than just making her a genius rebellious teenager. “Ms. Marvel” was a breath of fresh air because Kamala Khan is, for the most part, a regular teenager. 
Despite all of this, Cassie wasn’t the worst-written character. Much to my disappointment, MODOK was. MODOK (Mechanized Organism Designed Only for Killing) is an interesting character in the comics, and the movies flubbed developing his character. It was surreal to see the giant head of Darren Cross (formerly Yellowjacket, played by Corey Stoll) on the screen as MODOK; he shouldn’t have been MODOK. MODOK is a character meant to kill without compassion, and Cross as MODOK has too many emotions. MODOK should be a dick and shouldn’t have redemption — that is exactly what movie MODOK isn’t. At least the trauma that Cassie had with Cross from when he tried to kill her was done well enough. 
One of the most painful parts of the movie was how off the CGI looked at times. There’s a point when Janet has her hand in front of a creature, and it was very obvious that she was on a green screen. There are other times when things just look out of place or straight-up bad. If you had told me some of the sets had come from a “Spy Kids” movie, I would have believed you. There’s no excuse for some of the shoddy work done on this movie.
This isn’t to say that “Quantumania” was all bad. I really enjoyed the scene where Scott has to shrink down Kang’s core so Kang can go back to traveling the multiverse. The scene when all the possibilities of Ant-Man and the Wasp are absorbed into the characters was legitimately done well, and it showed. There are a bunch of smaller things throughout the movie that made it enjoyable enough to watch.
I will also point out that I liked most of the humor and characters in the movie (just not their motivations). Hank Pym and his obsession with ants was a plot element done right, and it had plenty of humor associated with it. The beginning and ending sequences following Scott were also done well. When he starts to question if Kang died in the quantum realm, it’s so ironic that viewers can’t help but chuckle. While I found the movie good-humored, I do still wish I found it as funny as the guy in the theater who was laughing at every joke…
But like I mentioned at the beginning, what was the “goal” of “Quantumania?” It honestly feels like it was just set up for “Avengers: The Kang Dynasty,” which I don’t like. I miss the MCU where the films felt self-contained while still advancing a universal plot (See “Black Panther,” “Captain America and the Winter Soldier”). Yes, I’m excited about the upcoming “Avengers” film but the road there should be exciting too, and it hasn’t felt that way in a while. I think “Shang-Chi” was the last good example of this type of movie. 
Overall, “Quantumania” really is a forgettable movie that can be skipped by the casual Marvel fan. It just serves as a stepping stone for further “Avengers” movies and has some questionable writing. There are some good moments, but honestly, they aren’t enough to save the movie. But if you’re an Ant-Man fan like me, I would still say it’s worth watching the beginning to see if it’s for you. 6/10

Carnegie Mellon’s math department is home to some of the brightest minds in the mathematical world, as well as some adventurous individuals, within academia and outside of it. One such individual is Professor Amzi Jeffs, a current postdoctoral associate. Jeffs received his doctorate from the University of Washington after defending his thesis on neural codes and the morphisms, minors, and obstructions of their convexity. To the mathematically untrained ear, this simply means Jeffs knows quite a bit about geometric structures and the arrangement of convex sets. He is particularly proud of a new theorem, his first, he proved in his thesis, basically stating that “certain arrangements of sets have to look a certain way and exist in certain dimensions.” While this might sound like common sense, to the mathematician, this theorem is freshly pioneered ground in a relatively new field of research. 
So far at Carnegie Mellon, Jeffs has enjoyed learning from his colleagues and superiors and interacting with eager students in the classroom. Currently, during the workday, Professor Jeffs can be found imparting the secrets of Differential and Integral calculus to his students. Otherwise, he’s found in his office. Except sometimes, when he’s not jumping around combinatorial geometric structures, and he's instead doing parkour — jumping on, off, and from concrete structures in the city. Jeffs first picked up parkour the summer before high school and has kept at it ever since. He especially found appeal in the “exploratory and problem-solving aspect of it” — spoken like a true mathematician. While it might seem like parkour and math are totally unrelated, to Jeffs, they actually share many similarities: the mental and physical navigation he does during parkour is not unlike the process of logical navigation he carries out when working through complex mathematics. 
Jeffs’ exploratory spirit doesn’t apply just to math and parkour. A more recent hobby of his is cooking! Ever since he took up veganism a few years ago, Jeffs has tried his hand at various vegan recipes and developed a knack for it. One could say cooking is also another one of Jeffs’ exploratory endeavors. 
Back in grad school, Professor Jeffs ventured into the world of grassroots political organizing and worker’s unions, creating some ripples along the way. Most notably, Jeffs took part in the Tax Amazon movement, which provided millions of dollars for subsidized housing for graduate students of the University of Washington at the time. Currently, Jeffs still is steadfast in his support of national and local labor unions. 
Jeffs’s current projects include organizing the 2023 Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization (ACO) seminar for Carnegie Mellon.

Dear Doc. Andrew,
I am following a noble lineage of advice column contributors. From moms asking Abby why their teenager “don’t like me anymore,” to bored Yale students bothering Ms. Landers with sordidly fictional tales, to one Samuel Clemens asking the Hannibal Journal’s ask Arthur for penname advice (it’s true, look it up!). The columns may be eponymous to their writers, as with “The Ethicist," or the Abbys, Anns, Prudies, and their respective women, but the real stars are the daring letter senders. 
There is a quiet humility in the act of exposing your problems to the world, signing with a pithy Anonymous-based pun, just to get torn to shreds by some 65-year-old who calls herself Miss Mannerly or some bullshit. A truly artful advice column article is rare, and they only arrive when the asker and the answerer work together in a correspondence ballet: “Anxiously Anonymous” has a silly yet learnable situation through which they unintentionally act the fool, “Dr. Respect” lightly mocks Anxiously, but still provides a meaningful response. Laffs all around, we’ve all learned a little more, and bedtime by 9:30 p.m. The pranksters sending in fake stories can never reach the peaks of the “real deal” because they’ve (I’ve) got no authenticity.
But now Ann Landers is dead, Abigail Van Buren is dead, newspapers are dead, and advice columns are dying alongside them (although Cecil Adams is still kicking). So the teeming masses must get their kicks elsewhere. They now get to take their takes local. An Instagram, Facebook, Twitter page, dedicated to YOUR school, onto which people can post about their encounters, or maybe confess their sins. 
I first encountered this phenomenon in the hallowed posts of the Stuyvesant Confessions Facebook page, a hive of sin and degeneracy populated primarily by: the disgustingly lonely; the borderline suicidal; the hilarious jokester; posts centered around doing sexual acts (solo or with “friends”) in bathrooms (a well-trodden trope in our disgusting times (perhaps the replacement of the traditional toilet stall poems (As seen at the urinal: look up… look up… look up… you’re pissing on your shoes)), Judith “Miss Manners” Martin rolls in her grave). The range from remarkably low-brow to shockingly touching is undoubtedly what kept me — and surely the 85 other Stuyvesant students here at Carnegie Mellon — interested. Of course, I never submitted a confession there. I wasn’t thaaat much of a loser (although some of the Stuy -> Carnegie Mellon students may claim otherwise). Nothing confessional-worthy (Catholic or otherwise) happened to me in high school. And what kind of schmuck would submit fake stories?
I submitted so many Carnegie Mellon fakes, I can’t even remember them all. This may be a sign of my poor memory, my prodigious amount of submissions, or maybe just a demonstration of how silly (and probably fabricated) other Instagram submissions are. Spread across @cmu.missed.connections and the now-banned-for-harassment (not my fault) @cmuconfessionals are my works, more than 15, but less than 20. I don’t do it anymore, of course. That’s one addiction I have beaten. On Instagram, the gatekeepers are completely dead. There is no artistry in crafting a convincing fake, and nobody cares to catch them. In a Baudrillardian sense, all the submissions are fake now, and I’ve got nothing special. I’m probably not the most prolific, and certainly not the funniest. All I’ve got is the platform provided by schmoozing with the writing equivalent of theater kids (it’s shockingly easy to become a Staffwriter for the Tartan).
If only there was some priest, Dan Savage, or advice columnist analog to confess to! But no, the fake posts are written solely for the self and the friends who know the trickery, and for the vapid Instagram “others” to read and laugh at, perhaps even believing it to be real. To be honest, this modern form resembles trolling more than writing to an advice columnist. How shameful!
Because of this, there was no artistry to @cmuconfessionals. The baseline truth of any individual confession was already in the dirt, and the extremely outrageous was commonplace (who knew that many students whacked their hogs into their roommates' clothes?) My submissions here were orthogonal — never sexual — and I’m pretty sure weren’t what got the account banned.
It was @cmu.missed.connections that would serve as my best canvas. The account was theoretically made for people to submit actual missed connections. Y’know, the “We ate lunch together, but I never got your name. Get back to me and we can eat out next time” deal. But at the hands of Carnegie Mellon students, this content became more of the written creep shot variety, style “to the brown girl with the black and red hair and the skateboard who was eating alone at the Egg Shoppe, I wanted to say hi to you but I was too shy and worried I’d drop my spaghetti. Let's meet up, if you’re single…” Disgusting, but also ripe for parody. There were certain on-campus archetypes that popped up so frequently: the hot alt barista girl (h-h-hopefully she likes g-g-girls…), the skater (a board on campus? So cool!), the fratty daddy who drinks the natty (he’s in Sigma Epstein, but he’s sooo hot!), the classmate (nerdy, but accessible. Who knows why the contributor doesn’t just talk to them, they sit so close!), the specific girl (you gotta find a way to specify in incredible detail their height, race, skin color, gender, sex, location, middle name…). Oh, and don’t forget to shout out the homie (Andrew the TA is soooo smart and hot!).
My fake missed connections were amazing. People frequently believed and had genuine emotional responses to them. I even had someone use the crying laughing emoji in reference to one, an experience which will only be matched in elation by the future birth of my only son. One of my favorites was: “To the girl I saw at CIT declaration day in the flapper outfit, we locked eyes but I never got your name. If you thought I was cute, meet me at the Wean La Prima the Friday after this is posted at 1pm.”
I’ll never know if this hypothetical flapper-outfit-wearing CIT girl showed up, because I sure as hell didn’t.
Waxing and confessionalizing, 
Andrewonymous
Dear Andrewonymous,
This all sounds very lame. Have you tried going “Walden” and appreciating the natural beauty present in the world? Or alternatively, getting a girlfriend?
Yours, Doc. Andrew

Rapidity and its grievous ramifications are the topic of many parables which generations of people from all parts of the world have passed down through centuries. From the tales of General Crassus to Mammon, we are forewarned of the suffering that comes from the cardinal sin of greed. However, no matter how often it is ingrained into our minds that there are human flaws we should not fall prey to, we do anyway because it is in our nature to do so.
We would too, if left to our own devices, without self-control, and devoid of our human desires of hedonism, because there is something so inherently attractive about having a lifestyle that makes you capable of doing anything and having everything at any moment, but past that belies nothing but  an emptiness of spirit and terminal anhedonia.
Martin Scorsese’s “The Wolf of Wall Street” brings us the true story of Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) and the pilgrimage of debauchery from which he baptized himself from 1986 to 1996. Very quickly we watch him turn from a smart and upstanding young man to a modern-day Caligula, having every day and night be an unpredictable sea of fervid emotion intensified by drugs, money, and women.
Belfort, by way of his brokerage establishment Stratton Oakmont, created the world’s largest “pump-and-dump” scheme using penny stocks, scamming $200 million out of the pockets of thousands of Americans, which we are shown excessively in the film, to go to extravagant parties and indulge in total chaos. The film’s one and only focus on Jordan as the protagonist forces us to subconsciously side with him against our own morality, showing us how we too would consider the sacrifice of our dignity for absolute power and wealth.
The film never lets us see the damage to households and hardworking families that Jordan cheats out of life savings, as Jordan never saw it either. It is the idea of faceless and nameless victims which are so far away that clouds our judgment to think of only what we see. In fact, even after Jordan’s downfall, we aren’t given a serious consequence to deal with. After being caught by the FBI, Jordan has his ill-gotten gains seized and is sentenced to four years in a federal prison with great amenities, but released in 22 months for good behavior. It is almost satirical how easy he gets off the hook for his actions after all he did and is shown in a way to depict how terribly easy some people get it, even though they shouldn’t. 
The moment in which Jordan is officially too far gone to be saved is when he cheats on his wife with Naomi (Margot Robbie), as his wife, Teresa (Cristin Milioti) was the only link that Jordan had with his life before this transition into “The Wolf.” Teresa and FBI Detective Denham (Kyle Chandler) are the only characters in the film that stand for morality with Denham, even at one point attempting to become a Wall Streeter, but eventually turning it down. When Jordan tries to bribe Denham, he sticks with his sterile life of train rides and salaries because he sees what greed could do to him. The fact that Denham and Jordan were both in the same place at one point and given the chance to appeal to greed shows a duality of values. This demonstrates to the viewer that this film is not a glorification of greed but rather a caution against it. However, the film knows that the superficial viewer will not see it as so.
Throughout the film, as Jordan worships money, the employees under him at Stratton Oakmont worship him. This, along with the fact that Jordan constantly speaks to us directly, makes the viewer worship him even as he is committing terrible actions. Even in the last shot of the film, when he is a public speaker, he is gives an audience a speech on how to become a better salesman. He continues to get our attention and time, as we hope to be like him, because looking at everything together, it seems like living his life would be better than living a normal life.
There is no antagonist that Jordan ever faces before the police, with all matters resolving themselves. Money allows him to do whatever he wants, and even when he is in a life endangering situation like the scene where he’s overdosing on quaaludes, the scene isn’t shot in a traumatic and mind-breaking way to show us a consequence, but is rather given to us in a comedic slapstick type of way, that puts no pressure on the audience to reconsider the characters' choices. The film reveals more about ourselves than those it depicts, by tempting us with a lifestyle that is, on the surface, so much better than our own. 
Young people, especially young men, commonly see “The Wolf of Wall Street” as a fun story about how a good life of money and constant luxury could be. In actuality, the film is quite a sad telling of how a person can break many people’s lives, including those in their own family, and how underwhelming justice can be in punishing terrible people.

Taika Waititi’s comedy-horror film "What We Do in the Shadows" (2014) is a charmingly short and simple mockumentary, in the same vein as “This is Spinal Tap” (1984), that delivers everything one could hope for and then some. Waititi, who is most known for his comedic direction of “Thor: Ragnarok” and his portrayal of Hitler in “Jojo Rabbit,” shows masterful skill in delivering a performance that never misses a beat in landing a joke. 
The film follows the vampiric lives of four New Zealand housemates attempting to live together in the modern day while still struggling with identity, worsened for them because vampires live forever. The comedy of the film comes from the fact that Waititi apparently did not give a script to any characters, preferring to improvise everything, with only a start and end point for the scene defined.
The natural delivery of wit mixed with the spontaneity of colorful violence, slapstick, and Waititi’s appreciation for horror gives this film a peculiar but brilliant flavor, one that never ceases to keep the viewer enthralled. Even though it is a movie centered around vampires, indeed with some hints of horror thrown into it, the movie is perhaps better described as an homage to classic horror, with references capturing everything from “Nosferatu” to Francis Ford Coppola’s “Dracula.” The humor of the picture shifts the supposition many have of vampires from conniving, demonic creatures of death to be thick-headed and dimwitted caricatures lacking much of the mystery and enchantment their predecessors would expect them to hold.
Of course, comedy isn’t the only métier that propels this film. The characters recognize the dismal totality of living forever on Earth. How is it possible to find meaning in life without the incentive of mortality? This conflict exists in all the characters, with their ages ranging from a few hundred to 8,000 years. The youthful rebellious spirit of the younger vampires make it difficult for the others to welcome the changing ways of the world. Their struggles humanize them to the audience, and their dispositions make them memorable.
Their interactions with one another, which varies from bickering to touching vulnerable scenes, show us that no living creature is free from isolation. The message is clear that despite not being alone, it is still possible to be consumed by loneliness. The creative nature of the film, to have them acknowledge the constant presence of a film crew and being aware of the ridiculous situation that they find themselves in, holds no barrier to what they wish to comment about the real world, our shared struggles on shorter lifespans.
In a nutshell, "What We Do in the Shadows" is a clever and enjoyable movie that skillfully mixes comedy, horror, and meaningful ideas to offer a one-of-a-kind and unforgettable viewing experience. By using a mockumentary style and self-referential humor, the movie elevates its storytelling, adding more layers of depth and self-awareness. The film explores themes about who we are and how we relate to others, bringing unexpected emotional weight to the story, making it even more compelling. A definite must-watch for those in search of good comedy.

"From the archives," remember that? Of course you do, loyal readers of pillbox. I apologize for being gone for so long, I've been terribly busy with an endless train of academic and Tartan obligations. You all must remember when I first started writing these last semester, positive that this could be a weekly column  — tragic how far I've fallen from this lofty ambition. 
After the resounding success of my article on the history of Wean (which you should check out, by the way), I was certain that Doherty hid equally fascinating secrets in its ancient walls. Sadly, I didn't find anything as cool as the menu for the dinner where Wean was declared to be Pittsburgh's best concrete structure of the year. I'm certain some fascinating secrets exist, waiting to be discovered by someone with just a little bit more dedication. Week after week, I insisted that my Doherty research was just on the precipice of materializing into something publishable, yet week after week I failed to deliver.
Then alas, this past Monday I made the fatal mistake of promising our dear pillbox editors that I would finally get them my Doherty article. So for lack of interesting historical content, this article will have to be carried entirely by the sheer charisma of my writing. I hope you can forgive me.
My research started thanks to Lynn Kawaratani, our University's Architecture Archivist, who generously invited me to take a tour of the Architecture Archives. Located on the fourth floor of Hunt Library, separate from the general University Archives, these house important architectural documents pertaining to the whole city of Pittsburgh. Among these are the original floor plans for Baker, Porter, Hamerschlag, CFA, and Doherty — drawn by Henry Hornbostel himself, the original architect of the Carnegie Technical Schools (or possibly drawn by an assistant with good penmanship). 
I was gently advised not to publish detailed structural plans for one of our oldest (and most vulnerable) buildings, lest some malevolent actors try to turn it into a pile of bricks at the foot of Gates. Such is the world we live in sadly. But trust me, the drawings were extremely cool and you should've been there to see them. 
Doherty Hall was built for the 1909 winter semester to be the home of the Applied Sciences department. Those days, the school yearbook included an exhaustive recap of every day of the academic year, so we know exactly when the building opened. According to page 313, on Monday January 4, 1909, the following happened: "Winter term opens. Applied Science moves to new quarters. Dot Felkel gets lost." 
Thankfully Dot Felkel was "found locked in a locker" the following day, and now we have an exact date of birth for this building. The attached image is from page 17 of The 1909 Thistle, and provides the interesting revelation that those aren't bricked-up windows on the 2210 and 2315 lecture halls, that's what they've always looked liked. 
You also might notice that the front entrance of Doherty is conspicuously missing in that image — that's because at the time, The Cut was a genuine hole in the ground, and there would have been no way of entering from the east end of the building. And even though The Cut was filled in by (probably) 1917, the main entrance wasn't built for about another five decades. 
Though the cornerstone of the front entrance says 1949, construction was evidently slow. We learn from the Sept. 27, 1950 issue of The Tartan that "the first classes were held recently in the million dollar addition to Engineering hall." A photo from the 1950 edition of The Thistle proudly shows off this spiffy new entrance, along with a 48-star American flag and a bunch of cars parked on the Cut.
Because I'm still short of my expected word count, I want to share a really cool piece of trivia about Baker-Porter that I'm otherwise never going to get to write about (because lord knows I'll never get around to a proper deep-dive into that building). On page 32 of "The Story of Carnegie Tech" by Arthur Tarbell, he tells us about the very first day of classes at the Carnegie Schools. "At the hour of nine they all moved, as if by common instinct, for no signal had been given, into the building, and on into an assembly hall with its tier upon tier of tablet arm chairs. That room is now 104 Industries Hall." 
For months it bothered me that I couldn't figure out which room this is — this most historic and sacred room where the first class at our school was ever held. Because interestingly enough, despite there being over 100 rooms on the first floor of Baker-Porter, none of them are numbered 104. For a while, I assumed it must refer to the PH100 lecture hall. But while I was visiting the Architecture Archives, I was allowed to peruse the original floor plans of Porter Hall (at the time just called "Building A" by Hornbostel) where it occurred to me that I should check the numbers of the rooms and see which is 104. By comparing the original floor plans with current ones, I now confidently believe that the former room 104 has now been converted into rooms 208I, J, and K on the second floor of Porter Hall. So go visit those rooms and pay your respects, perhaps.

"Missed Connections," a show “conceptualized as an indulgence in a fantasy” and a “form of escapism” (as termed by Levi Chaplin-Loebell and Esha Gupta), stars eight different actors who recreate various “Missed Connections.” These range from mindless consumerist societal norms to seeking love in disconnected environments. Each story is unique; some discussed high school and college relationships while others focused on the contrast of adult lifestyle. The show provides an insight into the ethics behind these “missed connections” sites and also draws from the Carnegie Mellon Missed Connections Instagram page, which has recently received some backlash from fellow students who have been inappropriately called out on it. 
The Craigslist play was especially unique because the audience members were able to submit their own “missed connections,” which were read aloud during the show. This added a unique touch to the show and engaged the audience well. 
Each actor brought their own creative talents to the stage and played the story in their own ways. Cordelia Pride, Assistant Stage Manager, said that “each cast member added their own personal twist to each story, making it a lot more personable and relatable to the audience members.” Similarly, Hair and Makeup Head Kyr Brenneman discussed how excited she was to work with each actor on their look for every story. 
Scotch'n'Soda continues to put on numerous shows throughout the year, including a “9 to 5” production during Carnival 2023.

Ceci,
The sophomore slump is fucking real. Things moved so fast last year, but now I'm having an existential crisis every Sunday. I think Pittsburgh is draining me of my energy. I haven't looked forward to a Thanksgiving break this much since my undergrad freshman year. 
Speaking of which — your parents are hosting Thanksgiving this year, so are you gonna bring Cynthia along? I feel like at this point they've gotta know y'all aren't just roommates. Pretty sure my parents have figured it out, and I feel like it's impossible my mom hasn't told yours during one of their little hikes. 
Research has been going really well. Like super extremely better than I ever expected. Yesterday I was chatting with Penco, the old M&I professor, and I asked him to take a look at my code. He thinks this might be really huge, like honest-to-God Nobel prize material if it turns out to be legit. He told me he would call some of his friends in Europe to verify this isn't just some bug in my model. 
He's also super excited because of the telomere paper that Pebblecheck's lab recently published. You hear about this one? They say the findings might let them pharmaceutically slow aging within twenty years. Big year for Carnegie research.
I wish I could say I was excited, but to be honest I don't really feel anything. Arthur moved to Dallas for that Raytheon job, and we haven't found a new roommate to replace him yet. Mabel has been home for the last month for a family emergency, and obviously I told you how Clair and I are kind of on hiatus for the moment. So I'm just living in this big drafty house all by myself, in a big empty city with nobody I know.
This is probably really bad, but I've started smoking by myself multiple times a week. I just can't stand to be inside my own mind anymore, so I just travel to Schenley to get high and enjoy my solitary walk back to Bloomfield. I usually listen to my old playlists and reminisce about the good old days of undergrad. Even though I'm not sure they were actually that good. 
It's honestly been harder to make friends than I thought. When you graduate, it's like everybody's social circle calcifies and it becomes impossible to meet people. I mean it's not like I haven't stayed in touch with my friends. I still text Sebastian pretty regularly, and I'm probably gonna visit Arthur over the winter break. But it's just different now. Sometimes I get in my car and drive through random streets in this city for hours, hoping that I'll find some new hidden location that will make me feel less lonely. It's silly, I know. 
When I get bored of that I'll go on aimless walks through the campus and sometimes, for just a moment, I can pretend I'm still an undergrad. But of course, everybody from then is gone, and I'm stuck living with the ghosts they left behind. It's odd how the people and buildings that define your life get melded together in your mind. It makes you forget that people come and go within four years, while the buildings will stand for centuries. 
I know you like to analyze my dreams, so here's one I've been having almost every night recently. Maybe you can tell me which planet is responsible. I'm walking down the main stairwell of Doherty, and when I pass the entrance to the physics wing I start to reflect on my undergrad years. But the staircase keeps descending, floor after floor, far deeper into the ground than Doherty really goes. I pass Sorrel's library, my freshman dorm, Sebastian's house, and all the places in the UC where Clair and I used to study together. As I go deeper, the basements of Doherty become a network of passages and shifting halls that unify every structure on campus. I get a God's-eye view of this underground labyrinth; the floor plans are laid out before me, and I understand with complete intuition how each building is connected. Every place at this school where I'd ever made a memory was merging, splitting, and reforming in a massive undulating fractal of hallways and rooms that made perfect sense. But the stairs keep taking me downward, deeper and deeper into the Earth.
After hours, I reach the deepest, dimmest, most isolated basement of Doherty where I find all the people from my freshman year who I don't speak to anymore. Everybody who had a formative impact on me is waiting there. Not just friends and classmates, though. Sammy is there too. The basement is lined with red bricks, and the air is so thick and hot that I think I'm going to suffocate. Behind them is a doorway that opens into an empty black abyss. One by one they all wordlessly shake my hand and walk through the doorway, until it's just me left. When I try to go back up, the floor tilts downward and I fall in. 
That's where the dream usually ends — right as I'm falling through the doorway. But last night it ended differently. I closed my eyes and fought the urge to fall through the door, and all of a sudden the room became level again. I opened my eyes and the room was brightly lit. The walls were made of gray tiles, not red bricks, and I could feel a cool breeze passing through. I peered through the doorway and I saw that it let me exit Doherty onto The Cut. And it was a beautiful spring morning outside.
Does it mean anything? What do your Tarot cards say about this?
Here's to hoping it gets better.
Andy

In showing us everything that’s wrong with the human race, “Missed Connections” also showed us everything that’s right. Written, directed, and performed by members of Scotch’n’Soda, the play showcased a beautifully well-chosen selection of Craigslist missed connections. Ranging from genuinely weird solicitations for companionship to truly gut-wrenching stories about loss, the show covered the entire range of human experience in a way that only really the universe of the internet could ever distill. The use of computers as props added a lot of this particular element as well as cohesion across what had the potential to be — but wasn’t — a very disjointed series of scenes. I’m going to get into my three favorite pieces from the show briefly, because they’ve been on my mind ever since I saw the show.
1. my girl and my fish
From the perspective of a young alcoholic man, “my girl and my fish” followed an abusive relationship through just a short 24-hour period. I think this piece was one of the most important in the show because it was the definite turning point from the show’s very comedic beginning to its very dramatic end. The use of props in this scene to change the space from one of order to one of chaos — especially via the actors throwing things around the stage — was one of the strongest stylistic choices made in the set and scenic design. 
Really, though, this piece just shoved both its hands straight down into my chest and messed around in there until my ribs were tied together like pretzels. The man has a fish. Every man has his fish. He loves his fish. The woman flushes the fish down the toilet in a fit of rage, and now the man no longer has a fish. For a woman to deprive a man of his fish is one of the greatest evils the world could know — I had no idea how to fit it into my hands when I was watching it happen onstage.
2. the moving on series
The casting of this series of monologues was completely genius. Arrim Jung, Scotch’n’Soda performer, shone her fantastic range in this bittersweet, ageless, ethereal story. A woman is selling her things as she moves out of her apartment - moves out and moves on, it seems. Each item is accompanied by a story about how it fits into her moving-on, often delicate and vague little poems tied together with white linens and the steam from a mug of coffee. She is learning to be kind to herself; she has her whole life to learn the lessons, to grow from the ashes, to bask in the dusty sun on a Saturday morning.
3. the old man
This review would be completely remiss if it did not mention this particular monologue. An old man has been directed towards the internet to find the woman he met unexpectedly on the day he planned to kill himself over 40 years ago. He saw her on the street and knew he had to talk to her. They hit it off and then she disappeared without a trace. Every time he felt like he wanted to harm himself after that, he thought of her. 
I’ve been saying this for a while now, but I think that if you look hard enough, you’ll see that everyone comes into your life for a particular reason. Sometimes that reason is more complex than other times. Sometimes there is just something really simple you need to learn. I think a lot of times, people meet someone who seems to hold a lot of potential for them in some way, and then when that person leaves, they are too busy mourning the loss of potential to see that the person has already taught them the thing they needed to learn. A real connection can never be missed if you’re willing to not miss it.

Recently, there has been an onslaught of conservative pressure to ban books with “controversial” materials from classrooms and libraries. Often these texts explore and interrogate truths about America’s history and present systemic issues such as inequality, racism, misogyny, homophobia, and classism. Florida has become one of the most contentious battlegrounds for book legislation with images of empty bookshelves trending online.
Last spring, Florida governor Ron DeSantis signed three particularly contentious bills into law: HB 1557, HB 7, and HB 1467. All three laws have led Floridian educators to remove books from their shelves. HB 1557, also known as the “Don’t Say Gay” law, prohibits instruction of sexual orientation or gender identity in K-3 classrooms. In older grades, this instruction can only be delivered in an “age appropriate” or “developmentally appropriate” manner which adheres to “state standards.” The law does not clarify whether the rule applies to school libraries or classroom libraries, but regardless of its intention, teachers found in violation of HB 1557 risk losing their licenses. 
The second and most notorious of these laws is DeSantis’ “Stop W.O.K.E.” Act (also known as HB 7) which prohibits teaching students that they should feel guilty about their race or sex. However, HB 7 doesn't just apply to classrooms, but to “all public education and state agencies.” This means that both educators and employers are forbidden from discussing any advantages or disadvantages based on race. As of October, teachers found in violation of HB 7 may also have their teaching certification revoked.
The third law, HB 1467, states that Florida schools must have online databases of every book in their collection “in searchable format” and that these books must be found by a librarian or media specialist not to contain pornography or materials deemed “harmful to minors.” The law also states that parents may challenge these materials and petition to have them removed. Further, in October, the Florida Department of Education explained that the law applies to any collection of books in a school.
As these laws have gone into effect, many worry that their vagueness encourages schools to ban titles that even come close to being violations. In particular, HB 1467 provides an avenue for parents and citizens to act individually to remove books they dislike or feel violate these laws.
Under these regulations, some teachers in Florida have closed or covered up their class libraries. Manatee High School Teacher Don Falls explained that in his school, “We were instructed last week that we essentially had three choices as far as our personal libraries that are in our classrooms. We could remove them and completely box them up. We could cover them up with paper or some sort of something. Or they could be entered into a database where the school district has all of the library books, and if the book was in the system, then it could remain on the shelf, open.”
Manatee School Board Chair Chad Choate III said that the school board is just trying to protect teachers, as violations can result in a third-degree felony. While some people in the district praise these efforts as the rights of parents at work, others believe it is a dangerous slide into censorship.

“Freedom will win," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said during his recent visits to European capitals, searching for fighter jets to support his country in the war against the Russian invasion.
On Wednesday, Feb. 8, Zelensky flew to London to address the U.K. Parliament and meet with King Charles III and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Afterward, he flew to Paris to meet French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. On Feb. 9, he spoke at the European Parliament in Brussels and met with the 27 heads of state of the European Union. This was his second trip outside of Ukraine since the war began in February 2022. He came to the U.S. to meet President Biden and address Congress last December.
Zelensky asked allies to provide Ukraine with newer fighter jets. The response he got from European leaders was not yet affirmative, but the issue is currently being discussed.
“We have freedom, give us wings to protect it”
In both his public addresses to the U.K. and the EU parliaments, the focus was not the request for fighter jets.
Zelensky made sure to show gratitude for the support already provided, and he received applause and a standing ovation in the European Parliament (the British attendees didn’t have chairs to sit on in Westminster Hall). 
In London, he appealed to British pride in their fight for freedom during World War II and compared their past struggle to what Ukrainians are currently experiencing. Zelensky stressed the importance of U.K. support to Ukraine “since day one.” In Brussels, Belgium, Zelensky highlighted how Ukraine is part of Europe. He said his country is fighting a war to defend the European way of life from the “most anti-European force of the modern world.” In his speech, Zelensky said that Ukraine and Europe’s common future depends on a shared commitment to protect Europe. And he called on all European citizens to take action, including by sheltering refugees and stopping disinformation.
President Zelensky only mentioned the need for jets when addressing the British parliament. He gifted the U.K. a Ukranian pilot's helmet, with the inscription: “We have freedom, give us wings to protect it."
Which fighter jets Ukraine needs and what countries are ready to do
Time magazine observed that the jets Zelensky asked for are U.S. F-16s and F-35s, Eurofighter Typhoons, Swedish Gripen, and French Rafales, to replace the Soviet-era fighter jets that Ukraine is currently using. Reuters reported that the Ukrainian Air Force is convinced that the upgrade could make a difference in the war. Timing is also crucial: according to the Biden administration, the next six months will be critical in determining who will win this war. 
European leaders are still pondering how to respond. The main reason for delays seems to be “technical,” as discussed by Chris Mason for BBC. He reported that training pilots can be an extremely long process and the maintenance of such aircrafts can require complex engineering supports. Therefore, it is not only a matter of supplying the jets but also a comprehensive support system to go with them. But some of these problems can be overcome. For example, the British government stated that it will look at reducing the training times for more experienced pilots. 
A more political reason why to keep discussing the issue was expressed by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte to BBC. Rutte stressed that if jets were to be provided to Ukraine, this decision would need to prevent a direct confrontation with Russia that would cause other NATO countries to join the fight. In Russia, the Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated that the debate over the fighter jets is seen as a growing involvement of other countries in the war, which can escalate tension.
How are European countries reacting to Zelensky’s request?
POLITICO reported that the U.K. will train Ukrainian pilots on NATO-standard aircraft and has offered longer-range missiles, but the U.K. secretary of defense ruled out the option of sending jets in the immediate time.
The French president hasn’t excluded the option of sending fighter jets but dismisses the possibility that it will happen in the upcoming weeks as reported by France24.
On a different position, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has declared that the issue around providing aircraft “does not arise at all” and doesn’t want “constant competition” in securing better weapons systems to happen as reported by POLITICO. 
But there are two countries that would be ready to supply fighter jets. According to the Financial Times, Poland and Slovakia are willing to provide Soviet-built MiG-29s which Ukraine already has and uses in the war. But these countries said that they can help only if a coordinated response with NATO allies were to happen. 
Last month Biden said the U.S. would not provide F-16 to Ukraine. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said “the issue of aircraft is not the most urgent issue now,” because the focus should be, for example, on providing ammunition, but there are ongoing discussions on how to meet Ukraine’s needs.

This week the United States shot down several airborne objects. After the initial Chinese balloon was downed off the coast of North Carolina, three new objects were shot down: one over Canada, one over Alaska, and one over Lake Huron. The objects ranged in size and shape from a much smaller balloon, a cylindrical object, and an octagonal object; none of which have been definitively traced. 
The most recent object, shot down over Lake Huron, was considered too small to be shot down using radar-guided weaponry, which was a problem for the U.S.'s radar-reliant weapons. Without it, guns and a number of missile locks would fail, forcing American aircraft to rely on heat-seeking missiles, which can be significantly less accurate. The object was flying at 20,000 feet, making it a serious risk for passenger airplanes. 
These incidents beg the question: What happened? The U.S. government has indicated that the other objects were likely not spy balloons, and the one over Alaska could have been a hobbyist balloon. According to members of an Illinois-based amateur club, “The thing [the U.S. government] described as having shot down is not inconsistent with what we're flying out there.”
The other shot down balloons have not been recovered, and the U.S. called off the search for their debris. It seems the U.S. and Canadian governments have agreed that neither object threatened the U.S. and do not deserve an exhaustive search. 
Biden has claimed that this isn’t a serious increase in UFOs since last year, and it seems data bears this out. 
While the fear that the U.S. is under attack from an aerial threat seems to have died down, there is now the matter of finding out what else the Chinese balloon contained, why it wasn’t shot down over Alaska when the government first noticed it, and how to counter these balloons without spending a missile on them. The balloon debris remains under the government’s protection, and tests are being taken. Initial reports suggest that the balloon was equipped with steering capabilities, which makes the odds of it just drifting off course very unlikely. Government officials seem to have concluded that China was lying about the balloon based on evidence from their investigation. At the same time, China has yet to confirm their balloon was there intentionally.
Biden has announced an inter-agency task force to figure out what happened, what to do, and how to change U.S. policy in the future in order to close this gap.

Last Sunday, the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA) issued a boil water advisory for a number of Pittsburgh neighborhoods. This included Bloomfield, East Liberty, Friendship, Garfield, Highland Park, Homewood North, Morningside, North Point Breeze, Point Breeze, Shadyside, South Oakland, and Swisshelm Park. 
The boil water advisory was released as a precautionary measure following a power outage impacting a pump station at 2:00 a.m. on Feb. 12, leading to “low and no water pressure” in the affected neighborhoods. The system was restored by 5:00 a.m., but PWSA notes that when there is a pressure loss, “contaminants can enter the drinking water.” 
PWSA noted that this encompassed an area with 6,117 households, and as a result, they placed “water buffaloes” — which are large tanks of clean water — at seven locations to help local communities while the boil water advisory was in effect. 
PWSA also offered advice for how to effectively boil water to remove contaminants, and suggests that this be done before using water for “drinking, making ice, washing dishes, brushing teeth, and food preparation” among other consumption-based uses. 
By Feb. 15, the boil water advisory was fully lifted. PWSA conducted two rounds of water quality testing to determine if the water was safe to drink, and tests “did not show any evidence of microbial contamination.” Specifically, the tests looked at Total Coliform, “a group of bacteria known as an indicator of microbial contamination.” PWSA took samples from 29 locations within the impact area to get a representative sample of the affected population. However, delays in obtaining the samples for all locations led to a staggered lift of the boil water advisory as different samples came back clean at different times. 
Pittsburgh residents no longer have to boil their water before use, but customers who haven’t used their water since before the outage are recommended to let their taps run at least one minute before using the water, so that stagnant water leaves the pipes.
This advisory came in the midst of calls to test Pittsburgh water in response to the Ohio train derailment Feb. 3. However, Hannah Wyman of Pittsburgh Union Progress reported yesterday that the risk of this is low, as the derailment is far downstream from where PWSA pulls water from the Allegheny River, and that chemicals are unlikely to travel upstream to the Pittsburgh area nor precipitate from the air into the Pittsburgh water supply.

On Feb. 15, Provost and Chief Academic Officer Jim Garrett announced that the University approved the calendar for Academic Year 2023-2024 (AY23-24). Though the calendar for summer 2024 has not yet been finalized, the official calendar is now listed on the HUB website. 
The AY23-24 calendar comes with a few changes. The first is the institutionalization of the 14-week semester that has been piloted for the past two years. This includes a week-long Fall Break during the week of Oct. 16 to Oct. 20 and a Spring Break from March 4 to March 8. These breaks are in line with the “7-1-7” model that was implemented this past year, meaning seven weeks of classes, a week-long break, and seven weeks of classes before finals. 
Like this past year, classes for the fall semester will start the week before Labor Day on Monday, Aug. 28 while spring classes begin the day after Martin Luther King Jr. Day on Tuesday, Jan. 16. 
Members of the community will no longer have what was called “Tartan Community Day.” The Calendar Innovation Committee (CIC) recommended implementing Tartan Community Day in 2019 as a day to focus on “community connection, rest and pausing business as usual to support a culture of well-being.” This past year, Tartan Community Day fell on Friday, Oct. 28, the day before Homecoming. 
The CIC recommended that instead of having a day off of classes, the elements of Tartan Community Day that were successful should instead be incorporated into existing activities. In his message, Garrett stated: “Building on Tartan Community Day’s impact, we are pleased to institutionalize the week-long Fall Break” and noted the amplification of current on-campus events like Homecoming. 
The last addition to the AY23-24 calendar is what the University is calling Democracy Day. On Election Day — which is Nov. 7 — there will be no classes until after 5:00 p.m. This is due to the CIC’s recommendation of a two-year pilot of Democracy Day. According to Garrett, the University will “offer programming and discussions on civic service and democracy.” Additionally, supervisors are encouraged to give their staff “reasonable flexibility” for staff voting and/or volunteering.
The launch of the two-year Democracy Day pilot comes after recommendations from several campus groups, including the Commission on Academic Freedom and Freedom of Expression, the Undergraduate Student Senate, and the Graduate Student Association.

On Monday Feb. 13, three people were killed and five were injured by a spree shooter at Michigan State University. The perpetrator was not a student and had no apparent ties to the university. 
The shooter's motives remain elusive. Hours after the initial shooting, he was found miles from campus, and when approached by police he took his own life. In a news conference on Thursday, Feb. 16, Michigan state police confirmed that the gunman had a note on his person where he describes issues he had at former workplaces, including a distribution center for Meijer, a midwest supermarket company. 
According to the gunman's father, the perpetrator was socially isolated, had difficulty holding down a job, and in recent years became increasingly bitter and angry. The president of UFCW Local 951, who represented the gunman during his employment at the aforementioned distribution center, described him as relatively unremarkable and displaying little indication that he might be capable of extreme violence. 
Many are disillusioned with the cycle of grief, debate, and inaction that occurs with every one of these tragedies — although even making this observation is now a routine part of the cycle. This marks the 31st time The Onion has used their perennial "No Way To Prevent This" headline. This probably won't be the last EdBoard piece we write about a mass shooting. Frankly, is there anything new to even say?
For better or worse, America has a deeply ingrained gun culture and not just among gun owners in rural communities. Our media and mythologies center around the actions of righteous individuals with guns, making it no surprise that Wayne LaPier's motto, "Good guys with guns stop bad guys with guns," was so popular. The hyper-individualistic hero trope resonates with a cohort of extremely politically motivated gun owners who want to believe that deep down, they're a steady enough shot to prevent the next tragedy. The perpetuation of this myth is no doubt a key factor in the fierce political activism of the NRA. 
The prevalence of gun ownership in America also means that a national ban on broad categories of guns is probably not feasible within our lifetimes. Many point to the effectiveness of Australia's 1996 ban on civilian ownership of certain guns as evidence that the solution is just that easy. And even though Australia's gun culture and national mythology has more than a few similarities to our own, their gun ban was enacted in a vastly different political context — namely, they don't have a second amendment. Effective as it was, similar legislation in America would require overcoming the cultural significance of guns (no doubt supercharged in recent years by culture-war rhetoric), in addition to overcoming a Constitutional amendment. This is not to imply that cultural shifts never happen or that we've never amended the Constitution, but those hurdles are enough to make the problem seem almost completely intractable. Furthermore, gun control laws have historically been used to disarm communities of color. We can't ignore the fact that a gun ban in the context of a racist legal system will inherit the flaws of said system. Restricting civilian gun ownership would keep firearms in the hands of law enforcement, which isn't useful if the police are the ones who pose a threat to your community. 
But harping on the infeasibility of a national gun ban belies the fact that actually, roughly 90 percent of Americans are in favor of background checks on all gun purchases. Furthermore, 70 percent of Americans support the use of Extreme Risk Protection Orders (ERPOs), a policy in which either the police or a family member can get a court to temporarily suspend a person's right to own a gun. However, the discourse around gun laws has become so poisoned that ERPOs have been branded as "red flag laws," evoking fears of a gun confiscation. In 2019, a Colorado sheriff threatened that he would refuse to enforce a state-wide red flag law on the basis that it was unconstitutional. 
Seeing as this unique form of tragedy shows no signs of slowing (in fact, 2023 has already seen more mass shootings in the U.S. than any previous year had at this point), it becomes important to consider what you as an individual should do in the event of a mass shooting. According to experts, spree shooters often fire indiscriminately into public areas. The best course of action is, unsurprisingly, to get away from the perpetrator as quickly as possible — failing that, seek to put a sturdy physical barrier between you and the gunfire, duck low, and make yourself as small a target as possible. 
The students of Carnegie Mellon grieve with the Michigan State University community, and we hope that such tragedies can be addressed by sensible gun legislation.

I have never been a big fan of short stories, but in the past few months, I have fallen for the vice that is the short story collection. For most of my life, I have been averse to short story collections, simply because I am a fan of character development. I prefer character-driven books to plot-driven books, and I could happily read a 10-book series about the same well-written character without getting bored. For this reason, I did not think that short stories were for me. But a few of my recent reads have converted me to the dark side, and I found myself wondering: Why now?
It all began one day over Fall Break as I perused my local independent bookstore. I was browsing through the fiction section and picked up a slim volume called "A House Is a Body" by Shruti Swamy. I thought the title was interesting so I brought it home with me and as I explored its pages, I was pleasantly surprised. Swamy writes about life in an incredibly bright and observant way, painting each character’s experience as completely unique. Swamy impressed me with her ability to make simple actions like drinking a beverage or laughing seem incredibly complex and beautiful. The stories ranged from mystically whimsical to grief-stricken to ironic to brimming with tension, and yet they all created a cohesive message about human nature and the way we find meaning. All that aside, I think it is high enough praise to say that this book made me want to read more short stories.
My next venture into the short story world came in the form of "The White Album" by Joan Didion. Didion is a favorite author of mine. I had previously picked up her novel "Play It As It Lays," which I casually enjoyed but did not connect to at the same level as "The White Album." This book enthralled me. It is a collection of Didion’s essays written throughout the 1960s about topics like the Hoover Dam, serial killers, and presidential architecture—to name a few. Didion’s writing has been highly praised by many, and its part-journalistic, part-memoir, sizzling yet tender tone drew me in just as much as anyone else. In my mind, this book is a testament to Didion’s power as a writer. She successfully makes me feel like I have lived through the 1960s and have knowledge of the intricate social movements and cultural attitudes of the time. This was a highly successful book that truly made me fall in love even more with not only Didion herself, but the short story format as a whole.
Another modern collection for those who are not history-inclined is "Milk Blood Heat" by Dantiel W. Moniz. This sometimes disturbing, sometimes heartwarming, always intriguing book is set in Florida, and centers a variety of characters in different generations and economic situations. The main characters include middle school girls making a blood pact, a woman who lost her baby, a husband frustrated with his dying wife, and a mother wanting to control her wild teenage daughter, all with deeper and more meaningful stories than the last. This book is so many things at once — it is dark, it is beautiful, it is funny, and it is real. Also, Moniz writes some of the most simultaneously stomach-churning and heart-wrenching prose I have ever read. Every sentence is a new joy in this collection, making me want to simultaneously read slowly while also consuming all of it all at once. Writing this a few weeks after I finished this book, I can say that I am still thinking about specific sentences and scenes. I already know it will be one of my favorites of the year, and possibly one of my favorites of all time.
Part of my journey to come to love short story collections was reading the right books at the right time, but I think there may have been something else at play. On one hand, the books are perfect for a short attention span, or if I am simply not feeling like I have the time to commit to a long, complex novel with lots of world-building. They are also perfect for the reader who (like many of us) goes for long periods of time without reading, since it’s not necessary to remember all the characters' names and everything about them.
But more than anything, I think short stories have appealed to me recently because they are simply and uniquely human. They follow the model of connection that mirrors reality — we can never know someone’s entire life story, and it is often hard to stay connected with people for our entire lives. This means that we are constantly seeing snippets of each other, just like in these books. I also read books by extremely talented authors, which helped me to transition towards the genre after being drawn in by their writing styles. So this goes out as a message to all of you short story haters: if you are resistant, give one of these books a try. You will not be disappointed, and you may just find something new to love.

Last week The Tartan published an article titled, "America's refusal to show military supremacy will be our downfall," and I wanted to respond with this piece.
“History never repeats itself, but it does often rhyme.” It’s a quote attributed to Mark Twain, one of those authors who wrote way too much in his life to not be quotable. The quote, or one of its derivatives, is used constantly. Hell, it's so relevant that one might start thinking the entire world is just a sitcom created by writers who started recycling ideas centuries ago. Mark Twain essentially says we are living inside the Simpsons. I call being Bart.
My colleague recently wrote a piece talking about one of those apparently repetitive moments in history, proclaiming us to be in a second Cold War, with China replacing the Soviet Union as our global adversary. It’s a very poignant comparison, especially for those who believed that we had achieved the so-called “End of History.”
Perhaps the reason for the failure of that dream is the U.S.’s inability to step up. Perhaps we should have done more, been more willing to flex the might of the largest military in the world. It’s a romantic notion, evocative of “Idealistic Intervention,” something criticized across the board.
Here’s the thing though: "Idealistic intervention" is complicated. While it’s easy to point out where the U.S. simply didn’t do enough — like our failures in Iran during Carter’s presidency, or the disaster that was the Afghanistan withdrawal — there are plenty of times the U.S. did too much. One could compare U.S. relations with Yugoslavia or Romania, with our work in South America during the (previous) Cold War. While Yugoslavia was explicitly socialist, the U.S. and Western allies were content working with them in order to further foreign policy, while the U.S. was also willing to aid fascists across South America come to power. Also consider how the U.S. put massive political and economic pressure on the democratically-elected socialist president of Chile Salvador Allende while simultaneously giving help to Ceausescu’s Communist government in Romania. The U.S. stepped up often — and not always in a way that followed the principles the country was founded on. And for every Bosnia or Kosovo, where the U.S. stepped up and saved lives, there’s a Vietnam, where we fought a possible ally in Ho Chi Minh and killed millions.
It’s hard to explain why some of these failed while others succeeded. Our support for the dictatorial governments of South Korea and South Vietnam involved us in conflict, but one of those governments is now a democracy and has one of the largest GDPs in Asia, while the other is no longer a nation (though Vietnam is very friendly to the U.S., and another powerful economy). 
So when it comes to China, the U.S. ought to step up in the way that was popularized during the 90s — make allies and promote friendships. In weeks past, the U.S. negotiated a larger military presence in the Philippines, a country that was once a U.S. territory, then a U.S. ally, but seemed to have pivoted towards China in recent years. These bases represent a pivot back to the U.S., a big step towards unity in the South China Sea and the long-term American goals of a NATO-equivalent in the Pacific. It’s easy to point to the failures of appeasements like the Munich Conference or MINSK II and claim the only solution is to fight, fight, fight, but sometimes it’s not that simple. Americans thought that fighting would give the Afghans the ability to create a stable country. Instead, the Afghan National Army collapsed, and the U.S. realized that nation-building was more than just conflict. We learned the same in Libya, Syria, and South Vietnam. Each was a conflict that expanded in scope and scale and left the regions decimated. 
It’s true that a Chinese spy balloon was flown across U.S. airspace in the last month. It was shot down over the coast of North Carolina, away from any harm it could have caused to civilian populations. Many on the right have claimed that this represents a gap in our defense, a serious issue in American technology and policy that puts us on the back foot against China. To those objections, I point out that NORAD had been tracking that balloon since it approached U.S. airspace. We been knew China had a spy balloon, we just waited to shoot it down. And then we did. It’s gone now. It took a single missile from an F22. 
It’s easy to claim that the time it took to shoot down the balloon is a symptom of a lack of resolve. Biden might be soft on conflict and soft on China. Perhaps the U.S. is missing the bite that we had in the Cold War. Too many peaceniks, in the parlance of the 60s. 
That’s unfortunately not something borne out in the policies of the current administration. Besides the new bases on the Philippines, there’s been more military trade with Japan, as their new “Helicopter Destroyers” are fitted with F35s. Biden reaffirmed America’s support for Taiwan, confirming a 70-year-old policy that we refuse to shift, as major American leaders traveled to the island as a show of support. Canada has finally confirmed purchase of American F35s, making them another part of the American defense complex. And that’s before we even look at Ukraine, Lend Lease Two, and the massive arms donations the U.S. has made towards the country. This isn’t the actions of a country looking for peace above all, but a country concerned with protecting its allies, and affirming its promises. The U.S. destroyed ISIL in 2018, and has continued to remove Al-Qaeda’s leaders in the years after. 
Perhaps you disagree with America’s actions as of late. It’s perfectly acceptable; the U.S. has made unilateral moves. But to call the U.S. too soft, too peaceful, too forgiving is mistaken. The words of Teddy Roosevelt still ring, and the U.S. has continued to carry its "big stick." Whether you agree with it or not, the U.S. continues to act. We don’t need to put troops in every conflict zone, we don’t need to deploy the Marines whenever some tin-pot dictator rattles his saber. That’s a trap, a money sink that will drag us into conflicts we don’t understand against nations who aren’t amenable to our aid. Even as the world’s leading economic and military power, we don’t need to flex that every time something we don’t like happens.

On Feb. 13, a blasphemous manifesto against the Oxford comma was published in The Tartan. I am here to set the record straight. Traitor to grammar, Eshaan Joshi wrote that the Oxford comma is “unnecessary half the time, and for most of the other half, we’re smart enough to figure out we don’t need it.” But, this has nothing to do with intelligence! Rather, it is about consistency. 
Joshi explained that standardization is useless in English — which he argues has very little standardization. I have to disagree with this. Just because a language isn’t standardized does not mean that individually we don’t have our own rules. Most people at least seem to develop their own style of writing with personal guides they have chosen to follow. This means that, individually, we have standards. The Oxford comma, as a rule, is useful here because if you believe in it you will ALWAYS use it. What Joshi argues for, inadvertently, is a world of misunderstandings. He writes that “We can decipher when we need to use the comma, versus when the reader can figure out that the list is not self descriptive.” However, that is unrealistic on an individual level. When writing, people should be able to feel confident that their readers will understand them. But when we assume that our writing is understandable without taking all readers into account, it becomes difficult for our audience who now must treat our writing like a puzzle. 
Another important aspect of the Oxford comma that Joshi ignores is its ability to work within other grammatical tools. Joshi speaks about how the Oxford comma can be confusing when listing proper nouns next to improper nouns. He uses this list as an example: "I met the landlady, the pastor, Mr. John, and Ms. Doe." He argues that readers will be confused as to whether "Mr. John" is an appositive phrase or separate person. However, he ignores several grammatical tools here. The first, is that when you are writing a sentence like this, you can use other grammatical symbols to differentiate between the list and an appositive phrase. Joshi’s example could be revised to say, “I met the landlady, the pastor (Mr. John), and Ms. Doe”; or “I met the landlady, the pastor — Mr. John, and Ms. Doe”; or  “I met the pastor, Ms. Doe, the landlady, and Mr. John.” All of these phrases clarify Joshi’s confusion AND include the Oxford comma. There are ways to be consistent with the use of the comma, but — like in all writing — the sentence should be clear. 
The Oxford comma cannot fix poor writing, but it is a widely useful clarifying tool. The problem is that it is not standardized and readers are made to guess what the author is saying. Joshi ends his article by joking “The Author is begging his friends, Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk to help him pay for college.” The issue is THAT IS CONFUSING. Most readers do not know Joshi personally, and it is NOT obvious that Bezos and Musk are not his friends. He is also using an outlandish example to prove his point. If he had written: “The Author is begging his friends, Farnam Jahanian and Cole Skuse to help him pay for college.” That would be even more confusing. Why not just cut to the chase and make it easy for your readers? Just write: “The Author is begging his friends, Farnam Jahanian and Cole Skuse, to help him pay for college” OR “The Author is begging his friends, Farnam Jahanian, and Cole Skuse to help him pay for college.” These statements are so much clearer just by utilizing commas! 
I get what Joshi is saying, but writing is a tool for communicating. It is always better to make your writing accessible to a wider audience. Using grammatical tools like the Oxford comma, clarify exactly what is being said. It also provides comfort to the writer because they are being consistent about its use rather than picking willy-nilly when it is most necessary. Make things easy, use the Oxford comma.

No, I don’t condone any of the transphobic viewpoints of J.K. Rowling. Just making that clear now.
Rowling, the best-selling author of the “Harry Potter” series, is a transphobe and there’s no questioning that. Though many refer to Rowling as a "TERF" (trans-exclusionary radical feminist) instead of solely as a transphobe, I don't believe in the term TERF. Transphobia has no place in feminism, and to me, TERF implies there is some place for it somewhere, which is incorrect.
Rowling’s ideology has once again been cast into the public eye with the recent release of “Hogwarts Legacy,” an action role-playing game that is set in the wizarding world of the 1800s. Though the game has only been released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC so far, it’s already seeing massive success. In the first week of sales, “Hogwarts Legacy” broke the 22-year-old record for the biggest launch of a “Harry Potter” game and has outpaced first-week sales of “Elden Ring” by 80 percent, both in the U.K. The second point is a big deal, as “Elden Ring” won the title of “Game of the Year” last year.
Additionally, some streamers on Twitch got early access on Feb. 9, the day before the game’s official release. According to the game’s developers Warner Bros. Games, roughly 1.28 million people tuned into a stream to watch the game, making it the highest-watched single-player game ever on the platform. I guess the game has some fans. 
But before the game’s release, many gamers were calling its boycott due to Rowling’s transphobic views. According to the “Hogwarts Legacy” website, Rowling had no direct involvement with the project, but members of her team did. It’s not hard to imagine that since the game takes place in the “Harry Potter” universe, Rowling will earn royalties from the game. Due to her transphobic views, some gamers don’t want Rowling to make any profit from these games. 
The call for boycotts and the controversy surrounding this game have just been amplifying its existence. This is yet another example of the Streisand effect — wherein the efforts to ban or censor something only makes more people aware of it. I would have invested no interest in “Legacy” if not for all the talk I see surrounding the game online. But now here I am, writing an article about it. Rowling 1, Boycotters 0. 
Video game websites have been debating whether they should even cover the game. IGN’s review contained a side text “Concerning J.K. Rowling,” which stated that they are divorcing the content creator from the game, which is an understandable choice given the popularity of the game and how influential IGN is in the gaming review world. 
Enjoying “Harry Potter” and all of its properties isn’t transphobic; agreeing with J.K. Rowling is. Many of us grew up with “Harry Potter,” and it played a substantial role in our childhood. I remember getting “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” in second grade and loving it. While I don’t like the direction the franchise has gone since the end of the main series, it’s still an engaging franchise. I don’t associate “Harry Potter” with transphobia, but every time I hear Rowling’s name, transphobia is paired with it. Whether someone enjoys “Hogwarts Legacy” or not doesn’t determine their stance on trans people.
I am fully in support of people enjoying properties that they like. There’s an argument that since Rowling will profit off “Legacy,” gamers are enabling her views by purchasing the game. This is a narrow-minded view and there’s so much more to consider. Many people worked to create the game, and purchasing “Legacy” supports them too. Focusing the debate on Rowling takes away from all the hard work and effort they put into the game, and they deserve recognition for putting together a good game. (“Hogwarts Legacy” currently has a score of 84 on Metacritic and a 9.0 user rating.) 
Twitch streamer TheYishai streamed “Hogwarts Legacy” to almost 10,000 viewers and stated, “Dude, just play the game if you want to play it. I’m a trans girl. I love ‘Harry Potter.’ I hate J.K. Rowling.” This is the mindset that I find myself agreeing with. It’s easier to separate the art from the artist than many people think.
Still want to protest “Hogwarts Legacy?” That’s your choice, and I’m not going to stop you. But there are alternative ways to enjoy the game. For instance, watch someone play the game on Twitch or YouTube. You’re directly supporting a content creator while not purchasing the game. Alternatively, if you wait three months, I’m sure that the game will be floating around somewhere online… (“Yer a pirate, Harry!”). 
In the end, we don’t educate others on trans people and trans rights by boycotting a game that takes place in a world created by a transphobe. Instead of wasting time on making a “J.K. Rowling bad, trans lives good” meme and posting it on Reddit for seven upvotes, support trans rights to all the other people in your life. I promise you’ll make more of an impact that way.

The Super Bowl is by far the largest stage for the American public, and the selection of advertisements shown on is iconic. Who can forget the “puppymonkeybaby”? Or… uh…
Yeah, the Super Bowl ads have gotten a little bit boring recently. It’s hard to differentiate them from your run of the mill cable TV ad. Oh, it’s boner pills. Oh look, insurance. Hell yeah, I love AARP commercials! I never knew how badly I wanted to take drugs, I mean, experimental medication, until this year. It’s nothing exciting, but you know what, it’s mostly harmless. I can’t find anything to hate, plus, they give me a chance to complain about the sports I’m watching on Instagram. 
That was, until this year. While there have are always controversial takes in the Super Bowl advertisement, especially with the disaster that is the whitewashing of the friendly fire incident that killed Patrick Tillman, this was… different.
He Gets Us is a Christian group that has sprung up recently. They’ve pushed a $100 million — yes, 100 million — across YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram, all culminating in a 20 million dollar ad purchase for the Super Bowl.
Twenty
Million
Dollars.
It is insane to me that there was someone bankrolling that much money for what is honestly, fairly bland Christian messaging. It’s incredibly mild, with a half-hearted attempt to spread “hate the sin not the sinner” (I guess this is their call not to hate crime LGBTQ people?), “love your enemy” (see previous), and “Jesus was an immigrant” (bonus points if you figure out who that’s targeting.) It’s presented as something that’s supposed to be unifying, but as anyone who’s in any of these communities can tell you, these ads don’t actually display anything meaningful. It’s the bare minimum lip service many churches give in order to make their service more palatable to the youths. It’s become hard to promote the same things that had been a mainstay for the church in the past, and in recent years, this has, anecdotally, been the way churches reach out.
The second problem is that the people who were bankrolling this are the same people who are pushing millions into anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ campaigns. Are you surprised? Millions pushed into pushing Christianity during the Super Bowl, with even more millions spent in pushing genuinely harmful and terrible messaging. It’s another step in the televangelical movement that put millions into religious messaging. 
What’s funny is that, in an attempt to make their position more palatable to left-leaning people, the He Gets Us campaign only pissed off conservatives. Even the milquetoast defense of immigration was lambasted by conservative commentators, and the money spent is a common criticism from religious people. It seems to have been a failure of a campaign, though I doubt we’re going to get the full picture for a while. From what we have now, it seems pretty clear-cut. A group, or groups, with money to burn on hurting marginalized communities burned it to try to make themselves look more palatable.

In the past few months, there’s been a great deal of controversy relating to the creation of a new Advanced Placement class. AP African American studies, which College Board is currently piloting, has emphasized a division between educational scholars and fear-mongering conservatives. This highly-anticipated course takes an interdisciplinary approach, emphasizing areas such as arts, literature, and science. College Board plans to make the course available everywhere for the 2024-2025 school year, but there is a politically-motivated opposition challenging this.  
Florida’s Governor Ron DeSantis has been the most vocal about his opposition to College Board’s introduction of the new AP African American Studies class. He accused College Board of trying to push their “woke” political agenda forward. On Jan. 12, Florida’s Department of Education rejected College Board’s pilot version of AP African American Studies. This decision was made with DeSantis' “Stop WOKE” law in mind. With jargon like “Education, not indoctrination,” DeSantis is attacking programs that support diversity, equity, and inclusion. His true goal is to use scare tactics to appeal to his racist base with buzz words like “woke” and “critical race theory,” while erasing part of our American history. 
Not only is rejecting this AP course a disservice to students, it also contradicts a previous state-issued mandate in 1994 which stated that students must be taught about African American history. With this in mind, it seems that DeSantis is letting his own radical ideas interfere with students' education. 
Even disregarding this mandate, DeSantis is being completely unreasonable. Because of the nature of Advanced Placement classes, students get to choose which, if any, to take. Accordingly, even conservatives who believe students shouldn’t have to learn about African American history shouldn't have a problem with this new optional curriculum. But they do have a problem with it. Instead of giving students a choice, radical conservatives would rather deprive everyone of our history.
In response to DeSantis’ opposition, College Board altered the curriculum of the new course in attempts to satisfy conservatives. They limited mentioning the Black Lives Matter movement, Critical Race Theory, the Black queer experience, and Black feminism. They also decided to include Black conservatism. But even this watered-down version didn’t appease DeSantis. 
In a rare statement last week, College Board expressed regret that they didn’t immediately denounce the slander by DeSantis and the Florida Department of Education (FDOE). 
“Our failure to raise our voice betrayed Black scholars everywhere and those who have long toiled to build this remarkable field,” the College Board statement said. “We have made the mistake of treating FDOE with the courtesy we always accord to an education agency, but they have instead exploited this courtesy for their political agenda.”
DeSantis’ opposition to AP African American Studies is just one of many frightening policies attacking Florida’s education at every level. From DeSantis' “Don’t Say Gay” bill to the President of New College of Florida being ousted by an ultra-conservative board, this is not an isolated event. DeSantis is waging a calculated war on Florida schools that should concern all Americans. As a potential Republican frontrunner for the 2024 presidential race, DeSantis aims to bring his policies nationwide which could lead to dire consequences for all of our schools.
