Once again topping the the charts with its third straight first-place performance and fourth of the season, the Carnegie Mellon golf team claimed the title at its Annual Invitational held last Thursday at Longue Vue Club in Verona, Pa. and went on to take second at the Edward Jones Shootout this past weekend. Surpassing last year’s champion St. Vincent College by 18 strokes, the Tartans finished in first place at the Annual Invitational with a team total of 294.
Carnegie Mellon bested the sixth and final team’s score by 67 strokes, leaving La Roche College with a 361 total. California University of Pennsylvania took third (314), Westminster College fourth (322), and Mercyhurst College fifth (332). The Tartans continued play last weekend and fell just behind Washington & Jefferson College at the shootout with a final score of 603, after finishing first on the first day of competition (295–308).
Leading the Tartans and the competition last Thursday, senior Alex Timmons carded an even par round of 70 to be named the individual medalist of the invitational and claim first place. With a third-place finish, first-year Terence Einhorn shot a 72, followed by a fourth-place finish from junior Christopher Lee with a 73. To round out the Carnegie Mellon competitors, senior Joshua Chen and first-year Michael Cheng tied for 11th and fourth places with players from California University, recording 79 and 80 strokes, respectively.
Representing the Tartans, five individuals entered the invitational, including junior Adam Klein, who took eighth place, carding a 76, followed by classmate Brett Cannaday and first-year Alexander Cohen, who both shot a 15-over-par 85. Junior Nick Burkholder and sophomore Brent Driscoll shot scores of 88.
Following the successful mid-week invitational, the team ended the Annual Edward Jones Shootout in second. The two-day event held at the Links at Spring Church in Apollo, Pa. proved to be another venue for the Tartans golf squad to showcase their dominance on the par-70 course. Concluding the initial day on top of the ranks with a team score of 295, Carnegie Mellon continued to reign over the six other teams on the final day as well but could not keep grasp of first.
Cheng carded a season-best round 72 to tie for second Saturday, and went on to record a 150 Sunday, tying teammate Lee for fourth. Tied for fourth on Saturday, Timmons and Lee shot 74 each, with Chen and Einhorn marking 75 first round scores, who were tied for sixth. Sunday’s results left Timmons in third overall with a 149 total, Chen carded 154 to place 10th, and Einhorn shot a 155 to tie for 11th place.
Representing the Tartans, four individuals entered this past weekend’s invitational, and once again Klein led the squad and tied Driscoll for a first day’s score of 84. Driscoll shot a 79 for Sunday to finish with a 163 total. Cannaday fired an 88 on Saturday and improved to an 83 to tally a total of 171 on the final day. Cohen recorded a 90 on Saturday and finished 175 by carding an 85 Sunday.
The Tartans continue competition at the two-day Fred B. Kravetz Invitational held at Oak Hill Country Club and Irondequoit Country Club this Friday and Saturday. This marks the Tartan’s final competition before the University Athletic Association championship.

After a long weekend of close sets and intense rallies, the Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team fell short of defending its title at the Great Lakes Colleges Association tournament held at Wabash College in Crawfordsville, Ind. The Tartans fought their way to the final day but were stopped from making the finals by 18th-ranked DePauw University, who squeezed out a 5–4 win. The Tartans did not let that loss affect their morale and went on to defeat 28th-ranked Kalamazoo University 5–2 in the playoff match later that day. Carnegie Mellon is currently 14th in the nation and has a season record of 16–6.
“Although it was disappointing [and] we couldn’t defend our title, we are determined to do better next week at UAAs,” said junior Ravi Raghavan. “It’s nice to see, though, our doubles have improved over the course of this season. It was one of our weak spots.”
In the first round of the tournament last Friday, the Tartans easily took care of the College of Wooster 5–0. At first doubles, the duo of junior Jon Spero and sophomore Bobby MacTaggart won 8–6, followed by the second doubles pair of juniors Nikola Ljuboja and James Muliawan, 8–5. 
Senior Yiran Liu and first-year Jeremy King teamed up together for the first time in a dual match and won 8–1 to capture the last doubles point.
To clinch the last two points, King, who was first off with a 6–1, 6–1, won at fifth singles, and sophomore Alex Nemerov at first singles added a 6–2, 6–1 win to make the overall score 5–0.
Against Hope College, the Tartans did not let any momentum die and crushed their opponents with another 5–0 win. 
Nemerov and Raghavan had a close match at second singles, nabbing a 9–8 (7–4) win in a close battle. Having repeated wins were the teams of Ljuboja and Muliawan and Spero and MacTaggart, who both won 8–4. Raghavan jumped in at fifth singles and finished first 6–4, 6–0 to bring the Tartans up to 4–0. King then grabbed the last win 6–3, 7–5 at sixth singles to clinch the match for the Tartans.
The match the next day against DePauw was a step up in difficulty for the Tartans. Nemerov and Raghavan added an 8–0 win, followed by Ljuboja and Muliawan, who demolished their opponents 8–3 at last doubles.However, the Tartans were unable to maintain their 2–1 lead and won only two more singles. MacTaggart won 6–1, 7–6, and Nemerov added an easy 6–2, 6–1 at second singles.
For the third-place spot, the Tartans faced Kalamazoo and came out with a 5–2 win. The teams of Nemerov and Raghavan and Ljuboja and Muliawan snatched up wins of 8–6 and 8–3, respectively, to put the Tartans ahead 2–1. For the final three points, Liu, MacTaggart, and Raghavan each won their singles for the victory.
“I was very impressed by our doubles dominance all weekend. That has been something we have been really stressing all year,” commented coach Andrew Girard. “Unfortunately, our singles play left us a little short. We will have to rebound and have a good weekend at UAAs to make the NCAA tournament.”
The Tartans will travel to the University of Rochester in Rochester, N.Y. next week Friday for the UAA championships.

Last weekend, the men’s and women’s track and field team participated in two separate track meets. The top athletes competed in the Bison Outdoor Classic Meet hosted by Bucknell University on Friday and Saturday. The rest of the team traveled to Robert Morris University’s Bennie Benson Memorial Invitational. While the Bison Outdoor Classic Meet represented the top-tier competition from 74 teams, the Bennie Benson Meet consisted of eight to nine teams. There were several outstanding performances from both meets, highlighting a very successful weekend.
At the Bison Outdoor Classic, the men’s team was led by senior Brian Harvey, who finished seventh overall in the more competitive 5000-meter invitational run. In the 10,000-meter run, junior Dario Donatelli took 10th with a time of 30:36.59. Sophomore J.P. Allera and first-year Matt Jacob placed 13th (15:04.99) and 35th (15:22.70) in the 5000-meter outdoor run.
In the 3000-meter steeplechase, senior Ryan Anderson once again dominated the field with an eighth-place finish with a time of 9:19.50. First-year Rob Morhard and sophomore Nate Bussiere took 16th (1:55.20) and 34th (1:57.30) in the 800-meter run. Bussiere and Morhard also took 35th (51.84) and 39th (52.59) in the 400-meter dash.
On the women’s side, junior Diane Mattingly finished 24th overall with a time of 1:00.80 in the 400-meter run. Behind Mattingly, Baker finished a close 26th with a time of 1:01.27. The women’s 800-meter run saw several strong performances, with Baker and sophomore Laura McKee taking 43rd (2:22.29) and 58th (2:25.16). Mattingly finished 60th overall with a time of 2:25.68.
At Robert Morris University, the men’s team finished second overall with 138 points, behind Robert Morris’s 142 points. In the 400-meter hurdles, senior Craig Hahn took first overall with a time of 56.64. Hahn and sophomore Pat O’Brien took third (15.58) and fifth (16.07), respectively, in the 110-meter hurdles. First-year Cody McMarlin had a strong race, finishing sixth overall in the 100-meter dash with a time of 11.38. “Entering the collegiate level of track, my mindset is the same as it was in high school: it only matters how fast I run,” said McMarlin. “My time today was better than what I have been running this season, but I still know I can go faster.”
O’Brien led the team with a first-place finish in the triple jump (13.48 meters) and fourth-place in the 400-meter run (51.84). Junior Eric Couphos finished third overall in the triple jump with 13.21 meters. Sophomore Justin Kurp, who had not run in the last few meets, opened his season with an impressive second-place finish in the 800-meter run (1:59.17).
In the 1500-meter run, first-year Kyle Andrew finished sixth overall with a time of 4:18.62. In the 5000-meter run, junior Chris Rizzo took third with a time of 16:05.82. Both junior Chris Bridgman and first-year Ryan Kissel dominated the pole vault (4.42 meters) and long jump (6.52 meters). Sophomore Mike Tomovich took third in the long jump with 6.32 meters.
In the throwing events, junior James Hulley led the team with a fourth-place finish in the discus throw (40.69 meters). First-year Alex Hernandez continued to impress, finishing fourth overall in the hammer throw with 45.95 meters.
For the women’s team, their collective efforts resulted in a solid fourth-place finish overall. First-year Ivana Moses had a big day, finishing fourth overall in the 100-meter dash (13.36), sixth in the triple jump (10.67 meters), and seventh in the long jump (5.13 meters). “I actually do feel like I’m getting more in shape,” said Moses.
First-year Luci Laffitte finished fourth in the 200-meter dash with a time of 27.12. Junior Crystal LeePow had another strong race, placing fifth overall in the 800-meter run with a time of 2:30.28. Senior Ashley Rothwell continued to impress in the javelin throw, finishing sixth with 32 meters.
The Tartans will return home to host the Carnegie Mellon Tri Meet this Wednesday before Carnival.

Your parents always told you “Don’t do drugs!” but little did you know your body made the choice for you. Inside each of our bodies are natural drugs — natural painkillers, called “endorphins.” Endorphins work by blocking pain signals from nerve cells to the spinal cord. Think of them as the brain’s little army. When the brain realizes there is pain being sent from the nerve cells, it casts out these warriors to protect our spinal cord, thus preventing us from feeling pain.
We’ve all heard of them, and maybe you know a couple ways to activate these feel-good polypeptide compounds. The truth is, a multitude of studies have been done on endorphins and their origins, and while scientists have not yet proven that specific activities cause a “rush of endorphins,” there has been significant evidence toward an improved state of being, both emotionally and chemically, after certain human activities. And if there is even a slight chance of experiencing the positive effects of endorphins, what does one have to lose in trying out these simple yet largely beneficial activities?
Many of these actions are surprising and enjoyable, such as eating chocolate, especially dark chocolate, which is full of flavonoids and antioxidants. Strolling through the Carnegie Museum of Art or watching Titanic may also release endorphins. According to YourTotalHealth, an online resource center, “viewing beautiful art, watching a touching dramatic scene or even listening to an inspiring piece of music can produce endorphins.” Experiencing fear, acupuncture, sex, the warmth of the sun, spicy food, meditation, and even yawning have all been shown to increase the level of endorphins in the body. It is clear that we unknowingly take these painkillers many times per day. The more the merrier, right? In this case, that statement couldn’t be more appropriate.
But the most commonly known theoretical way of releasing your natural pain-fighters is exercise. Of course, exercise can completely alter one’s mood just in the sheer feeling of accomplishment. But what many avid gym-goers don’t know is that these compounds are working wonders in their bodies. Acting as the aforementioned brain’s army, endorphins are released to keep athletes from realizing they are enduring bodily stress. There have been reports of runners who felt that after some amount of time in their workout, they could keep running with no pain. Not only do these endorphins offer an extra rush of power to somebody working out, but they have also been proven again and again to lead to an improvement in mood and a feeling of motivation. But, as with any topic related to health, this benefit is what you make of it. A leisurely walk may activate a couple endorphins and let you forget your worries for a bit, but an intense spinning class may just make your day.
So next time you are angry at your best friend or cranky because you didn’t sleep enough, get moving. It doesn’t have to take long for the endorphins to take effect; just push yourself and you will feel the benefits. The best part? You can retake this painkiller however many times you want, in whatever time period you choose. There is no promise you won’t get addicted, but no prescription is needed. Try it; your body will thank you later.

Skibo Gymnasium sounded with orders of “En garde, ready, fence” this past Saturday as 14 teams from around the Pittsburgh area met at Carnegie Mellon for the 15th annual Holy Grail Fencing Tournament.
“This is the biggest fencing tournament of the year for us,” said Tartans Fencing Club president and sophomore Greg Sluyter. Carnegie Mellon entered five teams into the event and finished third overall, behind Penn State University and the University of Pittsburgh. Since the event was not an NCAA competition, fencers do not have to be current college students, so the Tartans were represented by various ages, sprinkling in alumni, underclassmen, and a high school student on the squad.
The tournament was broken down into three events determined by weapon: épée, sabre, and foil. These categories vary by weapon, target, and importance of right of way. The tournament began with pool play and then continued with direct elimination rounds.
“Each bout gets more difficult,” explained 2008 alumnus Matt Faria, a member of the foil A team. Scoring is determined by touches, which have specific regulations depending on the weapon. For foil, only touches to the torso score points, unlike épée, where the whole body is the target. In sabre, touches anywhere from the waist up, including the head and back, score points.
Coming from a first-place finish in last year’s tournament, the foil A team of Faria, doctoral student Mike Dinitz, and junior Adam Walker had high hopes but was knocked out in the semi-finals with a final score of 42-44 by a competitive Penn State team, giving them the third-place spot. The Foil B team of graduate student Ben Nowak, 2008 alumnus Charles Yee, University of Pittsburgh junior Ali Merti, and high-schooler Will Sefcik also fenced well, coming in 13th.
In épée, the A team of sophomore Janna Arredondo, first-year Charlie Muñoz, and Sluyter finished 10th after being knocked out in the second round with a score of 43–45. The épée B team of first-year Honor Randall, 2008 alumnae Storm Walden, first-year Emily Griffen, and first-year Derek Basehore finished 12th. Only one team, composed of first-year Roberta Sefcik, sophomore Jake Johnson, and sophomore Charlie Miller, competed in sabre, finishing fifth.
“It was a good experience for new fencers to get a chance to fence,” noted Sluyter. This year’s fencing team has two first-year fencers in épée and one first-year fencer in sabre. 
The fencing club will be host the intramural fencing tournament and continue to practice this spring.

With over 50 schools in attendance — including Bucknell University, Lehigh University, the University of Wisconsin, and the University of Rochester — the Carnegie Mellon rowing club recorded three solid performances at the two-day Knecht Cup on the Cooper River in Camden, N.J. this past weekend. For a 2000-meter race, the women’s varsity 4+, novice men’s 8+, and a women’s varsity pair all took second place in their respective races, while another duo placed third.
Friday provided ideal weather for race day when most of the Tartans, including women’s and men’s varsity pairs and 4+ teams, two men’s novice 4+ teams, and women’s and men’s novice 8+ teams, competed in heats and semi-final rounds.
“The team did well. In a couple races, our boats edged out other teams within the last 100 meters,” first-year Harold Kim said. “In one heat of the men’s varsity pair, the pair pulled ahead with five strokes left to go, beating out Brandeis by less than two seconds.”
Despite optimal conditions the previous day, Saturday served up cold winds and torrential rain that impeded the flow and excitement of racing in the intense competition, as the athletes sought shelter rather than enjoying the weather.
“The rain made some schools reconsider sending their boats out for competition, and some heats scheduled for multiple boats were narrowed down to two or three,” Kim said. As the day’s event continued, it was clear that whoever crossed the finish line in the end demonstrated what first-year Grant Wilson called the “survival of the fittest,” a true test of dominance on the water.
The novice men’s 8+ faced harsh winds that gave the boats difficulty in lining up for the beginning signal, and two boats crashed shortly after the start of the race, which led to a restart. Once the race was underway again, Marietta College’s boat could not hold off nature’s influence and collided into the shore, inevitably running down the clock; by the time they realigned, the race was almost over.
The rowing team will next hit the water April 25 for the Governor’s Cup in Charleston, W. Va.

There’s no feeling greater than the burn in your muscles after a good workout. Practicing, or if you don’t do any sport in particular, just exercising in general, leaves you feeling beat down but accomplished, and it’s that sense of achievement and self-betterment that keeps pushing us forward. Personally, as a swimmer, I can’t go more than a day or two without wanting — no, needing — to get in the water and work out. But it isn’t always that way.
If I’m in a groove, a day without working out makes me feel gross and sluggish, almost lethargic. Instead of having too much energy, I have even less, and there’s nothing more that I want than to go exercise. But the more time I take off, the more I realize how wonderful it feels to be lazy, to just sit around and relax, to sleep instead of swim, to lie around instead of lift. It’s a leisurely lifestyle to fall into, but an evil one.
There are those lucky folks who take a lot longer to get out of shape and, likewise, get into shape a lot quicker than others. If you’re one of those people, you can put this down and go revel in your talent and good fortune. If you’re not, though, laziness is like Calypso — a tempting seductress who can lead you far astray from your mission of being in shape and not having a gut. Unfortunately, the similes end there; there is no Zeus or Hermes to free you from, said Calypso. Only you can free yourself.
I’ll be the first to admit it — sitting around on my butt doing nothing but napping and eating (and working, I guess) is a fantastic feeling. In the off season of my first year, I chose not to work out as much and instead spent my free time sleeping, surfing the Internet, and doing other enjoyable but idle activities. This newfound freedom from swimming was originally supposed to give me more time to focus on school and work harder, but it hardly made a difference. It might have even made things worse, because more free time meant more procrastination time. Rather than work, I got to watch almost every Mets game in its entirety during those months, since I wouldn’t ever have any other time commitments. I spent a lot of time working on my fantasy baseball team. I beat Pokémon Crystal at least three times over. But the accomplishment that I felt after doing that didn’t really do much for me, and when I finally got back in the water over the summer to get back in shape, I severely regretted having taken so much time off. I remembered how great it felt to be beat down, and how much happier I felt about myself.
This happiness is caused by endorphins, which give people a sense of well-being and power over themselves. One of the best ways to get an endorphin rush is through exercising, which explains why we naturally feel so much better about ourselves after a workout than after lounging around all day. But there’s more to it than just that, in my opinion. There is a much greater sense of accomplishment associated with improving in a sport than there is with getting back in shape, and there seems to me to be a pretty linear accomplishment-endorphins ratio.
Still, being lazy is a very lucrative option — it’s really up to the individual which path they take to enjoy their time. And as much as I love working out, I sure as heck plan to utilize my laziness quota once my senior season is over. Besides, Pokémon Platinum just came out this year.

As a senior, Amanda Sturges has had a broad spectrum of experiences in both academics, athletics, and extracurriculars. The MVP of her high school swim team for three years, Sturges started her first year at Carnegie Mellon on the varsity swimming team but is now a member of the Carnegie Mellon cheerleading squad. Sturges has been a member since her sophomore year, partly from the influence of her big sister in her sorority, Delta Delta Delta. Sturges’ involvement in cheerleading has proven to her that it is something fun to be a part of, a notion she initially had but was unsure of.
Sturges is an example of the diverse and successful students at Carnegie Mellon who can become accomplished in various areas of study. She began her career at Carnegie Mellon as an engineering student but decided to switch to business, and is currently finishing out her majors in business administration and social and decision sciences. 
Although she didn’t know much about business when she entered college, everything she heard and learned about the major was a great fit with her personality. If she had not decided to change tracks, Sturges would have still been interested in the engineering world, particularly electrical and computer engineering or chemical engineering. Sturges could have had a profitable experience as an engineer as well, as she was the winner of the Northeast Ohio Science and Engineering fair and was a finalist for the Intel International Science and Engineering fair when she was in high school.
As an active member of Tri-Delta, Sturges cites being a member of the sorority as “one of the most enriching experiences of [her] college career.” Moreover, Sturges was able to give her hand as one of the co-chairs this year for Greek Sing, which was able to raise $36,050 for the Lustgarten Foundation to aid in researching a cure for pancreatic cancer, inspired by the passing of Carnegie Mellon professor and advocate Randy Pausch.
After graduation, Sturges hopes to manage a resort in an exotic location, a change of pace from the Pittsburgh winters that students come to know while attending Carnegie Mellon. 
While she is pursuing a career, Sturges said, “I definitely will always be active, and the lessons of discipline that I learned from sports will always be useful for me.”
Sturges is a side base position for the cheerleading squad, which is one of the supports for the flyer position when the team performs lifts and stunts. 
While spurring the involvement of fans at home athletic events like football and basketball games, the cheerleaders also perform a competition-style routines, particularly during halftime of basketball contests. 
Since adequate preparation is required to execute technical stunts and the dance routine, the cheerleading squad holds regular practices, as is the standard for Carnegie Mellon’s other varsity athletic teams.

Most at Carnegie Mellon know that the smiley emoticon was invented by one of our very own professors. What many students may not know, however, is that that invention led to an award bearing the emoticon’s very own name — the Smiley Award — that rewards innovation in technology-based person-to-person communication. 
The Smiley Award, which is distributed by the School of Computer Science, is generally given to projects that are clever and relatively small or underground, in the spirit of the original emoticon. The judging for the award is based on effectiveness, creativity, and fun, with “extra credit” being given if the project is actually in use, understandable to the public, and/or a small idea that has a big effect. 
This year, the award was given to human and computer interaction Ph.D. student Ian Li for his Grafitter project. This project, a Twitter-based application, allows you to send extra information while updating your Twitter status, and then visualize the information in the form of graphs on the Grafitter website. Li felt that winning the award was beneficial to both him and his project. 
“Winning the Smiley Award was a great honor. It is great that the School of Computer Science has such an award to encourage fun projects. The Smiley Award was also a good way to advertise Grafitter, so that more people will benefit from the service,” Li said.
Li explained that his background in personal informatics and developing applications to help people learn about their habits and behaviors helped him come up with the idea for the application. 
“Some behaviors, such as financial transactions and web browsing, are easily recorded. However, there are other behaviors, such as your mood or what you ate, that require manual entry, which is tedious,” he said. 
The Grafitter application allows you to track these behaviors without having to go through the tedious manual entry by embedding the information in something you are already doing, such as changing your Twitter status.
The application has recently been updated, and now the application is usable not only by sending extra information through Twitter, but is also compatible with Blogger, Delicious, AIM, and Google Talk.
Li’s research is very interdisciplinary, which he attributes to the research style at Carnegie Mellon and his home department. Anind Dey, one of Li’s advisers and an assistant professor of human-computer interaction, believes Li’s interdisciplinary work helps add to his creativity, which he believes is Li’s biggest strength.
“His creativity stems from his strong backgrounds in computer science and art, both of which fuel his creativity and his focus on social applications and visualizations,” Dey said.
Both Dey and Jodi Forlizzi, another of Li’s advisers and an associate professor of human-computer interaction, are optimistic about the impact that Grafitter could have. “Personal informatics systems, such as Grafitter, give people the power to track and become aware of their routine behavior, and to identify patterns that might help them to change their behavior in positive ways,” Forlizzi explained. 
Dey believes that the potential for Grafitter’s success can be seen through the now-famous New York Times visualization that analyzed Twitter feeds during the Super Bowl. As of now, the only way of visualizing Twitter feeds is text-matching; however, Grafitter offers a new and unique way of analyzing the feeds. 
“Grafitter would allow individuals to better understand the kind of content they have been producing and understand the patterns in their lives for any behavior they use Twitter to report on. It also allows this easy sharing of information (the main benefit of Twitter) with others to be made that much more valuable, as they can also see and identify patterns and comment back,” Dey said. 
You can check out Grafitter at www.grafitter.com, or any of Li’s previous projects at www.ianli.com/research.

How can we interact more naturally with cell phones, laptops, and robots? How is technology being used in the developing world? How are online social networks changing the way people live? Computer-human interaction research aims to inform the future design of interfaces so that we can interact more naturally with services and devices, which in turn are designed to make our lives more fulfilling. CHI is the foremost research and professional conference of the field, which this year took place from April 4–9 in downtown Boston.
Carnegie Mellon displayed its superiority in the field of human- computer interaction by being heavily involved in the planning committee of the conference and also winning a number of awards. Scott Hudson and Bonnie John, both  professors of human-computer interaction, and Mark Baskinger, assistant professor  of design, were all on the conference committee for CHI 2009.  
Notable among the award winners were the recipients of the student research awards. Zhiquan Yeo, a senior computer science and human-computer interaction major, won second place in the undergraduate student category for his work “KTE2: An Engine for Kinetic Typography”, while Patrick Gage Kelley, a Ph.D. student in the Institute for Software Research, won first place in the graduate student category for his work “Designing a Privacy Label: Assisting Consumer Understanding of Online Privacy Practices.”  
Also, Sara Kiesler, Hillman professor of computer ccience and human-computer interaction, won the lifetime achievement award at the conference. 
The conference also consisted of talks given by experts in the field from Carnegie Mellon and around the world. As a part of the six-day conference, Matthew Kam, an assistant professor in Carnegie Mellon’s Human-Computer Interaction Institute, gave a talk on Monday based on his paper “Designing Digital Games for Rural Children,” which won an honorable mention.
According to Kam, there is “no magic bullet for why the quality of schooling is poor in the developing world.” Kam was motivated to study the design of educational video games for rural Indian children by previous research, which has shown that math skills can be improved through video games. Kam’s group found that the children did not understand Western games very well. By observing the children at play, Kam was able to identify the principles and motivations behind their games, which he then used to design educational video games that children found both interesting and familiar.
In the same session, Danish researchers Olaf Frandsen-Thorlacius and Kasper Hornbæk, among others, presented “Non-Universal Usability?,” which also won an honorable mention. Usability is a battery of objective and subjective measures that quantify how suitable an interface or piece of software is for a user group. In studies of computer-human interaction, it is typically thought that users understand and think about usability in the same ways around the world. The questionnaire that the researchers distributed asked Danish and Chinese participants to rate the importance of various aspects of usability of word-processing software such as effectiveness, ease of use, visual appearance, and satisfaction.
The researchers found that the Chinese participants favored visual appearance and satisfaction more than the Danish participants, and that the Danes sought effectiveness and efficiency more than the Chinese. The presenters concluded that the field’s definition of usability “may capture the aspects of usability but not their importance” across cultures.
In the Metrics session on Tuesday, David Akers, a Ph.D. student in computer science at Stanford, gave a Best Paper presentation titled “Undo and Erase Events as Indicators of Usability Problems.” Using Google SketchUp, a free online 3-D modeling tool, his team evaluated the suitability of backtracking events as indicators of usability problems. One measure of usability problems is self-reporting, which is when the user reports a problem in words, overtly. 
Akers and his team found that backtracking actions in the user interface, such as “undo,” were equally indicative of usability problems. This is an important finding because it suggests that good usability metrics can be collected automatically, without any special effort from the user of the software. 
From Tuesday through Thursday, the Interactivity Exhibit showcased work by conference-goers in interface technologies. Members from the RWTH Aachen University in Germany demonstrated a multitouch table with interactive widgets, called Silicon illuminated Active Peripheral (SLAP) widgets. Multitouch tables are large, flat surfaces that display data like a computer monitor and use touch-sensing technology for input. “A problem with today’s multitouch tables,” said project leader Malte Weiss, “is that there is no feedback.” When using a keyboard-like input method on a flat, uniform surface, the user’s fingers tend to drift and cause errors, and so the user has to divide his or her visual attention between the virtual keyboard and whatever he or she is actually working on. The SLAP widgets, clear plastic devices that are placed on top of the table, provide helpful tactile feedback.
Alexander Hoffman from RWTH demoed TypeRight, a prototype keyboard interface with variable key resistance. By varying the resistance of the keys based on the possible spellings of a word, the prototype was able to decrease typing errors by a large margin.  A group from Hochschule Bremen in Germany presented an interface called SoundTorch for searching among many songs. SoundTorch simulates a flashlight, and the songs in your library are like coins on the floor. Whichever songs are in your beam are played simultaneously, and when you hear something promising, you can zoom in to narrow down on the song you are looking for. The interface takes advantage of the “cocktail party effect,” which describes a person’s ability to pick out what he wants to hear from a large number of sounds.

Science fiction has often portrayed settings in which a person runs into his or her clone. However, one creature far from fiction has actually been able to see a replica of itself. Dolly the sheep (named after country singer Dolly Parton), born on July 5, 1996, was the first mammal successfully cloned from an adult cell. Cloned by Ian Wilmut and his team at Scotland’s Roslin Institute, Dolly was even the mother to six lambs bred the old-fashioned way.
According to the National Human Genome Research Institute, cloning is the process by which an “exact genetic replica of another cell, tissue, or organism is created.” There are three types of artificial cloning: DNA cloning, reproductive cloning, and therapeutic cloning. As described on the website of the Human Genome Project, in DNA cloning, a DNA fragment from one organism is transferred to a self-replicating element such as the plasmid in bacteria. 
Plasmids are rings of DNA found in bacteria and are not part of the bacterial chromosome. Plasmids are able to divide and replicate on their own. Thus, when the plasmid divides, the DNA of interest will divide, and copies of the desired DNA can be obtained.
Reproductive cloning is a technology used to generate an animal with the same DNA as another existing animal. Dolly was created using this method in a process called somatic cell nuclear transfer. In this process, scientists transfer genetic material from the nucleus of a donor adult cell to an egg cell whose nucleus has been removed. This new egg cell containing the other genetic material is induced to divide a couple of times to form an embryo. This embryo is then transferred to another female host’s uterus.
Therapeutic cloning, also known as embryo cloning, aims at creating an embryo from which stem cells can be harvested. Stem cells found in embryos are undifferentiated cells and have the potential of developing into any cell type. Because of this property, they can be used to study human development and treat illnesses.
Although cloning can be very useful, it does not come without risks. Most cloning, especially reproductive cloning, is expensive and inefficient, with a 90 percent rate of clones’ failure to produce viable offspring. 
Many studies in Japan and Australia have shown that cloned animals that do not live long enough are good subjects to study how clones age. 
In 2002, researchers at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Mass., discovered that around 4 percent of the genes from cloned mice functioned abnormally due to changes in the normal activation or expression of certain genes.
However, despite all the setbacks from failed attempts, genetic cloning is still valuable because it aids humans in learning about technologies like gene therapy, which can be used to treat certain genetic diseases by introducing virus vectors that carry corrected copies of defective genes into the cells of a host.
Cloning can also use genes from different organisms to improve the nutritional value of genetically engineered food. Reproductive cloning could be used to repopulate endangered species. 
Therapeutic cloning has the potential of producing a human organ from a single stem cell and can help replace damaged cells and organs in degenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. In fact, many scientists hope that therapeutic cloning can one day be used for purposes like organ transplants. 
In therapeutic cloning, DNA would first have to be extracted from the person who needs the transplant, and that genetic information will be inserted into an enucleated egg (one without a nucleus). 
Soon after this new egg containing the patient’s DNA begins to divide, it will produce an embryo from which stem cells can be extracted. These embryonic stem cells can grow to be any tissue type and can be used to generate organs that are a genetic match to the recipient.
There has always been some controversy regarding whether humans should be cloned. Some believe that due to the lack of understanding about reproductive cloning, it is unethical to attempt to clone humans. 
This is especially true if the statistics of premature death in cloned animals and other debilitating conditions (such as “large-offspring syndrome”) are considered.
The American Medical Association recognizes that animal cloning has produced some very significant outcomes in the field of science, but because people do not fully understand the risks and results of cloning, it, along with the National Bioethic Advisory Commission, supported the halt in federal funds toward human cloning in 1997.
Also, many ethical debates have surrounded the subject of human embryonic stem cell research. In 2001, former U.S. President George W. Bush announced his decision to ban federal funding for research using stem cell for lines created after that date. However, as reported on CBS News, on March 9, 2009, President Barack Obama said he was allowing federal taxpayer dollars to fund significantly broader research on embryonic stem cells because “medical miracles do not happen simply by accident.” This action gives researchers new hope for the future of stem cell research and, subsequently, cloning. However Obama has publicly stated that he will never allow the use of cloning for human reproduction.

A dose of ibuprofen and a good night’s sleep are usually good enough to take care of that occasional headache. However, for some, these headaches are not sporadic occurrences. Ibuprofen is usually useless for such people, and they need far more than just one night’s sleep to get rid of that headache: The headache can force them to stay in bed for even two or three days. What such people suffer from are migraines, and these are much worse than normal headaches.
Medicinenet.com reports that migraines affect nearly 28 million Americans, with females being more commonly affected than males. In spite of the large number that is affected, migraines usually go undiagnosed and untreated. Many dismiss the symptoms of migraines as simply headaches, but migraines are far more severe than just headaches. The most common symptoms of migraines include nausea, sensitivity to light and sound, and painful throbbing in just one part of the head. Less common symptoms, which occur in about 20 percent of migraine cases, include seeing flashing lights, seeing blank holes in the field of vision, hearing voices, and even hallucinating.
Apart from being extremely painful, the downside of having migraines is that they can last anywhere between four to 72 hours, completely debilitating a person in that period of time. All that a person will feel like doing in this period of time is curling up in a dark room, taking painkillers, and going to sleep. 
What’s more, although pain killers may provide temporary relief, taking painkillers for every migraine attack that happens can aggravate the disorder instead of relieving it. 
According to a FOX News article, the overuse of painkillers for migraines can, in fact, cause the recurrence of more headaches. Considering the fact that the most common form of relieving a headache is useless against migraines, it is hard not to wonder what makes migraines so different from normal headaches.
Although researchers have not been able to pinpoint the exact cause of migraines, the general consensus is that migraines are caused by enlargement of blood vessels in the forehead. This stretches the nerves that coil around the blood vessels and causes them to release a variety of chemicals. 
According to Mayoclinic.com, serotonin is a common chemical that is released, and this plays a role in relaying pain-related messages across the brain. Thus, the release of these chemicals causes pain and also further enlargement of the blood vessels, triggering the cycle again. 
Migraine attacks also trigger the activation of the sympathetic nervous system, which is associated with preparing the body for tense or stressful situations. Many of the observed symptoms can be linked to this sympathetic nervous system activation. 
Activation of the sympathetic nervous system increases sensitivity to light and also slows down the absorption of food from the stomach into the intestines; this latter effect, in particular, is the reason why oral medications for migraines are usually ineffective. In order to come up with effective treatments for the disorder, scientists have begun examining the genetic links of the disease. According to an article on Molecularstation.com, scientists from Finland and the U.K. have discovered that genes on chromosome 10q23 could be linked to migraines. This discovery could shed light on the exact causes of migraines and possibly give rise to a better treatment for it.
As of now, the only way to treat migraines is to take medicines that prevent the migraines from occurring. The most effective method to prevent migraines, however, is to stay away from certain migraine “triggers.” A variety of factors can trigger the onset of migraines. 
These include lack of sleep or food, stress, excessive physical exertion, and hormonal changes. For some, eating certain foods causes migraines. Different foods give rise to migraines in different people. Foods like alcohol, caffeine, aged cheese, and chocolate can lead to migraines. The best thing to prevent migraines is to lead a healthy lifestyle and stay away from foods that trigger your migraines.

Supercomputer helps scientists
A supercomputer that is capable of answering challenging questions about supernovas, climate change, and the arrangement of water molecules was built recently and is located at the National Center for Computational Sciences in Tennessee. The computer, called Jaguar, is the most powerful and fastest computer ever dedicated to science.
The number of mathematical operations a computer can perform per second or the peak operating performance, of Jaguar is 1.64 petaflops, that is around a million billion mathematical operations per second.
As compared to just one or two processing cores found in desktop machines, Jaguar has 181,000 processing cores.

Arctic ice caps prone to melting this year
With the onset of spring, the melting of the ice caps in the Arctic Ocean has also begun. Data predict that the ice caps are more vulnerable than ever this time. Measurements made by satellites suggest that the ocean area covered by ice this year is one of the lowest ever.
Also, a high fraction of that area is capped by first-year, thin ice, which is more prone to melting than thick, old ice. 
Multi-year ice’s thickness is greater than three meters, but first-year ice is only two meters thick.
Walt Meier, a remote sensing analyst at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colo., stated that although the ice extent has recovered slightly in the past year, the average thickness is quite low.

Study finds galaxies to be young 
Contrary to the popular belief that galaxies started their evolution after the Big Bang around 13 billion years ago, a study conducted by a team led by an Indiana University astronomer has found that some massive galaxies, such as the Milky Way, actually formed only recently.
This prediction was made because it was found that these massive galaxies have chemical abundances that indicate very little evolution. 
The heavy metals that indicate the age of a galaxy were found in relatively low abundance in these galaxies. 
This means that the galaxies may have formed recently and are cosmologically young.
The study predicts that the galaxies may have formed only 3–4 billion years ago.

New craft harnesses wind power
A British man named Richard Jenkins claimed the world land sailing speed record when he drove his vehicle, Greenbird, to 126 m.p.h. on the dry Lake Ivanpah near the border of Nevada and California.
Greenbird is described as having elements of an airplane, a sailboat, and a Formula One car. It is a carbon fiber composite craft and harnesses wind power. 
The vehicle has a mass of 600 kilograms and can travel at a speed four to five times greater than wind speed. 
As a result of the high speed, the downward force of the wings can increase its weight to a ton. 
The wing bearings and the wheel are the only parts of the structure that are made out of metal.

New test helps fight cervical cancer
A recent study shows that a new DNA test for detecting the human papilloma virus (HPV), which causes cervical cancer, is far more effective than the Pap smear test that is commonly used to detect the virus.
The results were based on a eight-year study conducted on 130,000 women in India. This is the first study to show that just one screening with the DNA test is better than all other methods at preventing cancer and death. Right now, the test is funded by the Gates Foundation and costs $5. Qiagen, the company that manufactured the tests, believes that the price could go down with increasing demand for the test. 
Scientists believe that women over 30 could stop having the Pap smear test every year and could just have the DNA test once in three, five, or 10 years.

Doctors carry out face transplant
Doctors at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston have performed the country’s second face transplant. This is also the seventh face transplant performed in the world.
The surgery took 17 hours, and the skin of the face, the nose, the muscles of the face, the upper lip, and the palate of the patient were replaced by transplants from a deceased donor. Unlike usual transplants, the patient had not undergone immunosuppressant therapy before the surgery. The immunosuppressants are necessary to prevent the patient’s body from rejecting the organ transplants. However, the use of these drugs weakens the body’s immune response and increases the risk for infections. The patient was put on immunosuppressant therapy after the surgery was performed and will have to take the medicines for the rest of his life.

Multivitamins show faulty composition
According to a study of multivitamins conducted by ConsumerLab.com, a New York-based company, more than 30 percent of tested products contained different proportions of components from those reported, and also contained traces of lead.
The vitamins tested included three that were used by children. These products contained more than the tolerable amounts, as issued by the Institute of Medicine, of components like vitamin A, folic acid, niacin, and zinc. One product for men contained excess amounts of folic acid, which in large quantities can lead to prostate cancer, while another product contained lead. Of the products tested for women, one provided less than the claimed amount of vitamin A.

Researchers find fat that burns calories
Brown adipose tissue (also known as brown fat) is found in young children, babies, and small mammals, and keeps them warm by burning calories when triggered by low temperatures. A new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine claims that adults also have brown fat. The results showed that people who were thin had a higher proportion of brown fat than those who were obese. Scientists believe that brown fat can help determine how the body reacts to food and how fat is used in the body.

With Move-On behind us and Build Week upon us, the campus is once again gearing up for the biggest party event of the year: Spring Carnival.
Beginning officially on Thursday and lasting until Saturday evening, Carnival has two main attractions that draw current students in and bring alumni back: Booth and Buggy. For those who are confused, a booth is one of the structures built by various organizations and displayed in the Morewood Gardens parking lot, which becomes a temporary midway for the event. Each booth must conform to fire and safety regulations, be completely finished by the start of Carnival, and have some sort of game that festival-goers can participate in. Booths are made to be kid-friendly and are built around a different theme every year. This year’s theme is Epic Adventures.
But just because Build Week lasts only a few days, don’t think that groups wait until the last minute to start their work. In many cases, work for Booth begins long before Carnival decorations start springing up all over campus. Booth chairs have been meeting since fall to make sure the show runs perfectly.
“Everything takes a long time,” said Greta Michalczuk, a sophomore chemical and biomedical engineering double major and one of KGB’s booth chairs. “Everyone’s really gung-ho, and then you’re like, wait, how many weeks do we have until Move-On?”
In accordance with the overall theme, the KGB has centered their booth on 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, the Jules Verne classic. They have designed their booth to resemble a massive bronze submarine locked in epic battle with a giant squid. The squid, Michalczuk explained, will also be an integral part of the booth’s game, which will involve a ring toss to subdue the creature as it threatens the craft.
Michalczuk was especially enthusiastic about the exterior of the booth. “You should be able to see a bronze submarine with a dock in front of it,” she noted, adding that the inside was also going to look impressive. “The ocean is going to be blacklights, with blacklight paint.”
KGB is an independent organization in competitive Booth. Many other groups around campus get into booth building and Carnival madness — Greek organizations most notably. The fraternities and sororities compete against each other, and each year attempt to place in the Booth competition.
At Alpha Chi Omega’s sorority house, the common room and lounge was filled with booth pieces, supplies, and decorations in the making. The newest sorority to come to Carnegie Mellon and a National Panhellenic sorority, Alpha Chi Omega was working hard, along with Delta Tau Delta, to make this year’s Carnival amazing.
Dina Machin, a chemical engineering major and Booth chair for the sorority, remarked that Booth had its ups and downs. She recalled “Home Depot runs — buying paint; we even got 29 gallons of paint in one trip.”
That particular trip was memorable, both because of the paint and because of the circumstance. With her posse of three people, Machin towed five carts full of lumber and paint through the store, laughing with friends and sisters as they contemplated how on Earth they were going to fit all of their supplies in their cars.
When asked what was one of the most memorable experiences of booth, Machin laughed. “Definitely papier-mâchéing at three in the morning,” she said.
One of her sisters, Arianna Golden, a first-year mechanical and biomedical engineering double major, also added that “trying to draw circles on plywood when it’s wet” is also pretty fun. 
Alpha Chi Omega’s theme will be the Game of Life, and they have plans to erect a giant spinner on the top of their booth. While their booth will be only one story high, they anticipate the addition of the spinner on the top to bring the size of their booth up to two stories. The sisters were also working hard to create giant “peg people,” the player pieces from the Game of Life, to be used as decorations for their booth.
As fun as building booth has been, Machin remarked that it has also been a lot of work. “I wish Greek Sing was first semester and Booth second semester,” she commented, citing how Greek organizations have little time between the two events to prepare and get things ready for Carnival. Currently, the sisters have spent 20–25 hours a week on the project, which amounts to around four hours per person, per day. This coming week, she anticipated the number to go up to around 30 hours.
Apart from Booth, another form of entertainment that is coming up is Buggy, the other Spring Carnival tradition, which will be having its races this coming Friday. Buggy has long been an exciting complement to Booth. Students from a wide range of majors work together on different teams to design, build, and race the fastest cars possible. Usually, students involved in Buggy fall into three categories: pusher, driver, or mechanic. 
Pushers run behind the buggy and propel it up hills, giving it enough momentum to keep going until the next pusher takes over. Different pushers handle different sections, or “hills,” of the racecourse. There is also a driver, the person who lies down inside the buggy, using inner steering to direct its motion. Mechanics are responsible for engineering and crafting the buggy to design specifications.
What is unique about Buggy is that practices are held on the course, which consists of Frew Street and a section of Margaret Morrison. However, as both of these streets are often populated by traffic during the day, Buggy teams must get their practices in before heavy traffic sets in. Usually, this occurs early in the morning.
Wade Gordon, a first-year mathematical sciences major, currently works as a mechanic for the Student Dormitory Council’s Buggy team. While the late nights sometimes wreak havoc with his sleep schedule, Gordon replied that he enjoys being part of the team.
“The whole thing’s a blast,” Gordon said. “It’s pretty hectic; we have to be out there almost every weekend. You can go down there and there’s always something to do. Weekend rolls are pretty intense: we’re out from 4 to 10 in the morning.”
With each team vying so competitively for a win, buggy designs are guarded with the utmost secrecy, often known only to the high-ranking officers in each group. But that doesn’t make the atmosphere in the organizations any less fun. Gordon noted that all you really have to do to be accepted is to come to practices and work hard.
Buggy races will be happening at 8 in the morning on 
Friday, April 17, and Saturday, April 18. DVDs of the races will also be available for purchase from cmuTV.
In addition to Booth and Buggy, AB has also been advertising the bands coming to campus to perform at the celebration: The New Pornographers and Ted Leo and the Pharmacists.
As the campus begins to throw itself into the Carnival season, the countdown to build, race day, and concerts is on. However, it’s good to remember to relax a little during this intense week.“The minute I start trying to win, that’s the minute no one wants to work with me any more,” Michalczuk stated. “I do Booth for fun.”
Machin and Gordon expressed similar sentiments. Machin ruefully stated that while she’d gotten a restful eight hours of sleep the previous night, it wasn’t likely that she’d been having that again anytime soon.
Gordon joked about his late nights as a mechanic, but said that that was what brought him closer to his teammates.
“It’s a real welcoming environment,” he recalled, smiling.
Geraldine Holmes, a Carnegie Mellon parent, voiced her appreciation of the intense student effort: “I think it’s a wonderfully original and creative outlet for the students of Carnegie Mellon University.”
AB Concerts rain-site wristband tickets for The New Pornographers and Ted Leo and the Pharmacists are available at the tables in front of Doherty and at the UC Info Desk. The concert is free.

As Pittsburgh weather becomes more forgiving, the search for new eateries beyond the Carnegie Mellon neighborhood becomes more enjoyable. 
On East Carson Street in the South Side, there is a wide array of cafés, bistros, and restaurants to enjoy for lunch or dinner.
One of them, Café Du Jour, serves interesting but appetizing sandwiches at an affordable price.
A tiny café, Café Du Jour has a small indoor dining area and a couple tables outside situated by a small garden. The deep red wall of the small dining room is surprisingly comforting, not intimidating.
For starters, you can try baked Brie with sliced apples and spring honey, served with warm French baguette ($7). You can hardly go wrong with the queen of cheese. 
The Brie was just warm with a garnish of rosemary mixture. Unlike most places, the baked Brie is not inside a pastry but, rather, is meant to be eaten with the warm French baguette. 
There wasn’t enough cheese to complement all the bread, or maybe there was too much bread. Although the baguette was warm, the fresh-baked scent it usually emanates was missing, and with all the pretty plating, I was disappointed that the Brie was lukewarm. 
If the Brie had been slightly warmer, the Brie and rosemary aroma would have been a great combination. The apple, though, was freshly cut. 
There was also some berry syrup with honey that refreshed the sweetness of the honey and the richness of the cheese. The dish was good, but, with a little effort, so much more could have been done with it.
Café Du Jour has a wide variety of sandwiches. Last Saturday’s special was a salmon burger with LTO (lettuce, tomatoes, and onions) and red wine basil aioli ($9). “Aioli” is a fancy word for olive oil-based dressing or vinaigrette. Vinaigrette is usually an emulsified mixture of oil and acid, sometimes vinegar or lime juice. 
The burger patty was made of salmon, capers, and dill, and is a take on smoked salmon, as smoked salmon is usually served with mustard dill sauce with onions and capers on the side. 
The whole wheat bun was well-chosen, but rather dull. A toasted bun with slightly melted cheese might have made this dish more appealing. The greatest feature of this salmon burger is the sliced cheddar cheese. As simple as this sounds, sliced cheddar cheese adds a richness of flavor that cannot be achieved by normal packaged cheese.
For pork lovers, Café Du Jour has an apricot-dijon glazed roasted pork flatbread sandwich with a spicy chile-napa cabbage coleslaw, cucumbers, tomatoes, red onions, and snow pea shoots ($8). 
This sandwich gives you a generous slice of roasted pork. The coleslaw is actually in the folding of the sandwich next to the pork. The cabbage was fresh and crunchy, and not drowned in the dressing. Snow pea shoots and just the right amount of red onion cut the richness of the slaw. The pork was tasty, flavorful, and moist along with a sweet glaze.
The pork slice is thick enough to feel like you are eating a pork sandwich but not so thick that it tips off the balanced flavor. However, it was confusing as to whether the sandwich was to be served hot, warm, room temperature, or cold. 
It seems that the flatbread was slightly warm and the filling was at room temperature. Delicious as it was, it felt like eating something that was warmed up rather than cooked.
Both the salmon burger and pork sandwich came with a small slice of watermelon, a sweet gift to the rich meal.
Café Du Jour is a nice café serving fancy sandwiches at realistic prices for college students. 
All the dishes are delicious, although with extra work and attention there could be more sparks and fireworks, adding that extra oomph to bring the meal to another level.
Café Du Jour is situated at 1107 East Carson Street and serves lunch and dinner from 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday.

Last Thursday, the School of Art was visited by Da Xiong Guo, the world-famous Chinese comic artist who was freed from imprisonment last year. In 2008, the Chinese Communist Party arrested Guo because they found his artwork offensive. 
Guo’s work has the power to summon nationalistic pride and mystery — and when his work strayed from iconic Chinese idols to present-day figures of the oppressive Chinese government and the proletariat, he was tortured for his free speech and liberal notions. After two arduous months of waiting, Guo’s friends in China and the U.S. finally came to his rescue. Guo now lives in New York City with his wife. 
As soon as he walked into the art studio, Guo immediately appealed to his fellow artists. He picked up a piece of chalk and asked one of the students to draw an apple. As a way of explanation, he said that when he was three years old, his father had asked him to draw an apple. 
Guo said he didn’t want to draw the apple, so his father drew one and asked Guo to copy it. Guo drew the same apple, but added a few more truthful embellishments that his father’s less artful eye overlooked. Guo fell in love with art, and since that moment has always sought to truthfully and magically represent the world around him.  
After graduating with a degree in commercial design from the Jilin Art Institute in China, Guo began working as a reporter because he feared that the arts would not support him financially. 
He soon quit journalism, though, finding he could never report the truth and was often misguided by a repressive Communist agenda. In 1999, Guo worked as a chief illustrator for his own studio, Qicartoon Studios. In 2000, he was awarded first place in the prestigious Shanghai Animation and Comic Competition for his comic series called “Chinese Ghost Stories.” 
This comic represented a traditional Chinese legend in an exciting and new comic aesthetic. The work was a hit with all age groups. Guo’s work carries a certain geist, or spirit of the people, and he has published over 100 titles, which have been distributed in China, Japan, Taiwan, Europe, and the U.S.
Despite his international success, Da Xiong expressed that he wasn’t clear about what the American comics market really wants. He spoke about the heroes in American comics — Superman and Batman — and how these characters celebrate the American protagonist: a “manifest destiny” go-getter with an aim to protect the public. 
However, they’re not rooted in much of a reality. America may have its heroes — John F. Kennedy, Barack Obama, Thomas Jefferson — however, these characters hardly resemble the emperors of China.
American culture dominates the world and infects other nations with popular items like McDonald’s and Mickey Mouse. However, American culture is still new. Chinese culture, on the other hand, is thousands of years old, and its heroes have the added benefit of being able to represent the Chinese at large. Its history is closely intermingled with mythology. Guo’s work calls upon the mythical and iconographic national identity of China. Using the contemporary language of comics, Guo has invited the Chinese youth to rediscover their rich identity and past. 
Guo illustrated the Chinese emperors in Chinese Classics - 36 Tactics, and in another series, he represented Chinese philosophers. Each character represents a certain personality and serves as a parable for contemporary audiences. In a nation artistically and politically stripped, Guo’s works provide a didactic metaphor for each and every citizen.

Receiving a $5000 scholarship for winning an annual singing showdown is amazing, but winning back your confidence in the process is the real icing on the cake.
For Roberta Burke, a senior drama major, Campus Superstar proved to be a major turning point in both her personal and professional life. Singing since she can remember — “I don’t know what it is to not know how to sing,” she commented — Burke was diagnosed with vocal cord nodules, masses of tissue that develop on the vocal cords and obstruct speech, while in her freshman year at Carnegie Mellon. Since then, she was under strict restrictions about how often to use her voice. “I wasn’t allowed to speak for the first six months,” Burke said, “and I had a speaking regimen, like what hours in the day I could speak.” 
What made the situation even more dire is that Burke refused routine medical treatment, as well as the option of surgically removing the nodules, and opted for herbal treatment instead.
“My family and I believe in herbal medicine ... and that the body can heal itself,” she said. Fortunately, Burke’s vocal cords healed and she regained her vocal abilities. 
But the illness did take its toll, if not in a physical, the in a psychological way. Not being able to use her voice for two years ruined Burke’s self confidence. “When I started singing again, it wasn’t the same sound that I had originally ... I didn’t have good control over my voice ... I didn’t feel like this voice was mine,” she said. 
But Campus Superstar changed all of that in one night. After continuous training for one and a half years, Burke finally felt she was ready for a public performance. “This is really my first emergence back out [saying] ‘Here I am... I’m a singer... this is Roberta Burke,’” she commented. 
Burke could not have picked a more opportune time to make her debut once again, as not only did she walk away with first place from Campus Superstar, she also received overwhelmingly positive comments from the judges that gave her confidence a much-needed boost.
“I think the response from judges like Etta Cox ... her saying she would buy my album or having Richard Rauh be speechless ... it really reminded me that God has given me a gift,” she said. On the night of the final competition, which took place on April 5 at Carnegie Music Hall, Burke sang a rendition of Whitney Houston’s “I Have Nothing,” a song that is meaningful to her because Burke looks upon Houston as her musical mentor.
Carnegie Mellon truly did itself proud as it walked away with all three prizes at this year’s Campus Superstar. With Burke bagging first place, Lilli Passero, a first-year drama major followed closely as first runner-up, and Amanda Jane Cooper, a junior drama major, as second runner-up. Passero and Cooper won $1000 each. Cooper felt that the main thing she learned from the competition was to “trust yourself and have fun.” She decided to enter the competition because she is friends with Nick Cosgrove, a junior drama major, who won the competition two years ago, and his experience spurred her to perform. Burke concurs with Cooper’s sentiments about this opportunity being a fun-filled experience. When asked what she planned to do with the $5000 she won, Burke laughed and said, “It’s going to be used to pay off my balance at Carnegie Mellon University.”

On Sunday, April 5, the Byham Theater presented One Night of Queen, a two-hour tribute to arguably one of the most rocking bands of all time. Queen was imitated, or flattered in its highest form, by Gary Mullen and the Works, with Mullen playing a spitting image of Queen’s lead singer, Freddie Mercury.  
Yet with all the potential for an intense night of rock, the environment threatened with peace and quiet. Byham Theater is the kind of place where you go to see Annie Get Your Gun. Head banging in Byham just doesn’t seem right. Also, the time frame of 8 to 10 p.m. catered to a geriatric crowd. Sure, most of Queen’s early fans are now grandparents, but the absolute lack of youth can make listening to Queen feel like a Phil Collins concert.
In spite of all these factors, however, Gary Mullen and his crew successfully put on a spectacular performance. The guitarist masterfully blended the clean style of Brian May (Queen’s lead guitarist) while adding his own flourishes, which made the crowd forget that they were standing in front of plush velvet seating. The keyboardist was also crucial in adding flavor to the show, with a particularly impressive performance during “We are the Champions.”  
It was no surprise, however, that Gary Mullen stole the show with his portrayal of Mercury. On every level of Mercury’s character, Mullen was excruciatingly exact. Beyond just simple singing (which was fantastic, by the way), Mullen moved as Mercury would have, swinging his microphone and posing just as Mercury did in his heyday. Even between songs, Mullen would play with the crowd, making them fetch drinks, and even trading his famous king’s crown for a fan’s fedora. At one point, he even invited some middle-aged women to come dance with him on stage.
On the agenda for the night were the classics, and only the classics. Those looking for the operatic Queen, with their four-part harmonies and heavily nuanced orchestration, would have been heavily disappointed. The repertoire focused mainly on Queen’s arena rock section, from the straight-up rock and roll songs, such as “We Will Rock You,” to the overly flamboyant “Friends Will Be Friends,” which characterizes Queen’s later, movie-score-oriented years. Guitar solos had top priority, but they far from gave Mullen a break during the Mercury antics. Mullen would air guitar right alongside the soloist, up to the point of apparent aggravation. Nobody ever said that rocking hard didn’t come with a price tag.
On occasion, Mullen would soften up and play a ballad, such as “Love of My Life.” Here the crowd witnessed the pinpoint vocals of Mullen and enjoyed a well-deserved rest in between the harder pieces. It should be noted, however, that no one took a seat during the entire show. This may have been because of Mullen’s repeated demands that the crowd remain standing.
After about 90 minutes of a shirtless, over-the-top imitation of Mercury grabbing his ass, the band closed with a roaring rendition of “Crazy Little Thing Called Love.” However, just like any other rock band ever to put the amplifier volume over 3, Mullen and the Works came back for an encore, finishing with the duo “We Will Rock You/We are the Champions,” two songs that are always played together on the radio.
The show offered a certain sense of guilt for our generation’s music. These days, it seems that when we want to rock, there’s always unnecessary baggage. Pretentious attitudes, political agendas, and highly specified clothing have spoiled an art form that was supposed to be concerned only with itself. One Night of Queen offered a full two hours of non-stop rock action with absolutely no commitments. That is, besides a sore throat for repeatedly shouting requests to play “Another One Bites the Dust.”

The day I arrived in Argentina, Buenos Aires was wet and cold. As the taxi driver sped through the small streets, I tried taking in the sights and sounds of the city, but really, the fact that I was on the other side of the equator didn’t hit me until two months later.
Buenos Aires is an immense city, dirty and bright. From August to November, I lived in a residencia filled with students from both Americas, run by three or four women who acted as our host mothers — fussing over us when we lost our keys or were caught with wine and beer bottles and helping us with our Spanish.
The heads of my program tried to give us some basic guidance too during our two-week orientation.
“Don’t have sex, but if you do, go to a telo,” they told us (telos are short-term hotels where people stay to have sex in). “The only black people Argentines have seen are Brazilian. The only black women Argentines have seen are Brazilian prostitutes.... Men will call to you in the street. Ignore them.” They summed up all of our orientation sessions by reminding us that Argentines don’t believe in arriving on time and that we should quickly accustom ourselves to Rioplatense Spanish, the Italian-tinged Castellano that Porteños, natives of Buenos Aires, speak.
I was introduced to the graceful fluidity of Argentine Castellano when men in Palermo, the neighborhood I lived in, started calling out to me in the street several times every day. “Cómo estás vos, morena? Que linda negra.” Being a black person in Argentina was truly an experience, and once, a woman commented on my skin, saying she had never seen anything like it and asking where on earth was I from. People’s reaction to my race was usually more a show of ignorance than racism, and although it was tiring, I found that laughing and explaining that I was not from Brazil or Africa was the best response I could offer.
Although I went to a museum or a market here and there, I found that assimilating myself into Buenos Aires culture was really about participating in nightlife without a large group of Americans. On Monday nights, young Argentines and travelers from outside the country gathered at a magnificent drum show, Bomba del Tiempo, and afterward, plenty of bars and clubs were waiting with open doors. Both Porteños and visitors are friendly to an extent and willing to make friends with new people in the sweaty bar or club setting. Palermo is a sprawling neighborhood, filled with young Argentines and hostels every few blocks, creating a diverse and open place. But even with the established diversity, store owners and café workers are curious about people who are obviously not natives. And that’s a good thing. Buenos Aires offers intimate, independently-owned cafés and restaurants, and few chains are established other than McDonald’s and Burger King. 
Because of this, owners want to establish a good rapport with the people who flow in and out of their establishments. My roommate and I used to go to a café called Las Pizarras every few days after class to talk to Rodrigo, the chef and owner. He’d give us free food and test our Spanish, sarcastically reminding us that the best way to better our speaking skills was to get a boyfriend who only spoke in Spanish.
Rodrigo was an example of the strong attitudes Porteños have. It’s easy to think of them as native New Yorkers, with an attitude that reflects the city they live in. Traveling outside of Buenos Aires, I found other Argentines weren’t as brash or curious as those in the capital. Like almost all Porteños, Rodrigo had strong opinions and wasn’t afraid to express them, even if it would offend someone. He was going to say his piece, and he would argue passionately if you let him. Porteños are deeply passionate people.
I decided that I’d have a better time appreciating Buenos Aires if I looked outside of my program to find friends, and I was right. Many of the people in my program were ignorant of the lush culture that surrounded us every day and opted to try to make Porteños speak to them in English instead of trying to adapt themselves to the rapid Castellano. By going to nearly empty cafés during the day and diverse bars at night, I met Argentines, Europeans, and other Americans who were just as excited about the filthy, beautiful city we were temporarily living in, even if the sidewalks were literally covered in dog droppings. The main thing that separated our experiences was that I had class nearly every day, and the people I met were either attending a university in Buenos Aires or taking an extended holiday.
Mostly, classes were repetitive and boring. I took all four of my courses in Spanish, and in three of those classes we talked about the same things: Evita before she was played by Madonna; Che Guevara, and therefore The Motorcycle Diaries, the story of Guevara’s life before he became a revolutionary; Jorge Luís Borges, a renowned writer and poet who has a street named after him in Palermo; and the Dirty War, a period of dictatorship that took place between the ‘70s and ‘80s. The only class where I learned something new was my grammar class, where our teacher, Diego, let us talk about our cultural impressions of Argentina, and he’d reflect on our responses, teaching us a bit of grammar here and there. It was there that I learned the most.
Being back in Pittsburgh is completely different, and there are many times when I miss the smog, the overcrowded subways, the dead heat of spring, and nights ending at 7 in the morning, not to mention empanadas and a diet heavy in beef. When people ask me if I’m glad I went to Buenos Aires, it’s hard to answer — the way I feel about the experience is impossible to put into just a few words. The day I bid farewell to the city with a “chau” and a kiss on the cheek was a day I will always remember.

Humor, unrequited love, and dreams from the past: These are the main components of one of the world’s great dramas, Eugene O’Neill’s A Moon for the Misbegotten. Completed in 1943 and premiered to ecstatic audiences in London’s prestigious Old Vic Theatre in 1947, this play is O’Neill’s final work after 32 full-length dramas and 19 one-act plays. Under the critically acclaimed director Pamela Berlin, Pittsburgh Public Theater’s production of A Moon for the Misbegotten will be premiering downtown in the O’Reilly Theater on April 16th. With a fresh cast that includes the talented Beth Wittig as Josie in her Pittsburgh Public Theater debut, this O’Neill production is one that you won’t want to miss.
A Moon for the Misbegotten is a drama steeped in history. While O’Neill wrote this sequel to his Long Day’s Journey into Night, a heart-wrenching play about his dysfunctional family while he was a young man, he was in unbearable pain. In his old age, O’Neill developed Parkinson’s disease, making the act of writing nearly impossible for him. As mentioned in the The Eugene O’Neill Review, in addition to his physical ailments, O’Neill wrote to his son, “Last week I finished the first draft of a new play, A Moon for the Misbegotten. A good title, eh? ... Much work to do before it will be anything. A case of too much war on the brain. Pearl Harbor exploded when I was starting the most difficult part.” As World War II was raging, O’Neill was struggling physically and mentally in an attempt to capture the nature of his brother, James Tyrone Jr., and an epic story of longing. 
Set in 1923 on a Connecticut farm, O’Neill’s saga follows the journey of an ensemble of lost souls, including a sly Irishman Phil Hogan (Tom Atkins), his confrontational son Mike (Jason McCune), and his daughter Josie. The Hogans work the farmland that belongs to James (Victor Slezak), a broken-down poetic actor who travels like a ghost through his old Broadway haunts and bars. When T. Stedman Harder (Daniel Krell), James’ wealthy oil tycoon neighbor and landlord, threatens to buy James’ property due to James’ pigs’ drinking from Harder’s pond, James doesn’t initially oppose the idea. This causes the Hogans to devise a complicated scheme that involves trapping James into marrying Josie, whom James often flirts with when he is around the farm.
Taking on the famous O’Neill drama style, heart-wrenching passion and sorrow is exposed on one moonlit night when Josie begins her seduction of James. By the morning, what was once pretense has become authentic, and while some souls have been cleansed, others have become more troubled. O’Neill’s drama is well known for its ability to reach staggering emotional depth with humor and passion while taking place, for the majority of the time, on a single moonlit night.
Although A Moon for the Misbegotten is an intense tragedy, it still has O’Neill’s famous humorous tint and subtle message of hope. As producer, Lawrence Langer, was quoted saying in the The Eugene O’Neill Review after receiving O’Neill’s drama, “the play has, in its final act, and at the end of the second act, the spiritual uplift which is the characteristic quality of all tragedies, and along with it is such a profound knowledge of the good and evil in humanity.” Such enigmatic work poses difficulties for the cast. 
Atkins, famous for his role as the Irishman, Art Rooney Sr., in The Chief, finds the comic but necessary role of Phil Hogan to be challenging. Atkins believes that “Phil is the engine of the play” and that Phil is difficult to portray because “you have to get as many smiles and laughs from the audience as you can without being a clown. Phil certainly isn’t a clown.”
Wittig will also be tested in her part as Josie. O’Neill calls for a physically large woman to play this part, and Wittig needs to have an Irish sense of wit despite the play’s American setting. She is excited, however, to make her debut with such an emotionally provocative and beautiful play. With the Pittsburgh Public Theater’s terrific reputation and the cast’s excitement about this saga, one can be confident that this production of the mournful and spiritually uplifting A Moon for the Misbegotten will be thoughtful and powerful.
The show opens on April 16 and runs through May 17. Visit www.ppt.org for more information.

After the debut of Paul Blart: Mall Cop in January of this year, Observe and Report seems to simply replicate its previous counterpart. Much like Mall Cop, Observe and Report is set in a local mall, and the protagonist, who is in love with a beautiful girl, has dreams bigger than his simple mall. However, this movie turns out to be more of an adult film and has less of a solid story line. Students at Carnegie Mellon got a first look at the film on April 6 with a special pre-screening. 
The movie features Ronnie Barnhardt (Seth Rogen) as a low-life mall officer who loves guns and has a mouth that can outswear a sailor. The opening scene shows a pervert who goes around flashing all the women in the parking lot of the mall. Ronnie, who dubs himself as the head of mall security, immediately gives himself the job of catching the pervert. However, Ronnie is not alone. His entourage consists of two twins (Matt and John Yuen) and a quiet-natured man named Dennis (Michael Pena). 
During his time in the mall, Ronnie has become smitten with Brandi (Anna Faris), who is a stuck-up, immature cosmetics counter worker. All the while, though, he is blind to Nell (Collette Wolfe), who is kind to him and serves him free coffee. After Brandi is flashed by the pervert, Detective Harrison (Ray Liotta) is brought in as Ronnie’s replacement. While the pervert is on the loose, a string of mall robberies also occur, which Ronnie once again tries to take upon himself to investigate. With Harrison now in the picture, Ronnie is furious. He refuses to back down and continues to “help” Harrison by accusing everyone on site of being the thief. 
After spending a whole day in an empty investigation, Harrison (who is now fed up with Ronnie’s outrageous methods) yells at Ronnie and points out that his mall cop position is insignificant. Ronnie then defiantly attempts to become a real police officer. As the first part of this training, Ronnie decides to invite himself on a ride-along in Harrison’s car. Harrison ends up leaving Ronnie on the street in the most dangerous part of town with several violent drug dealers, but Ronnie turns the situation around by beating up everyone on the spot and arresting some drug-dealing kids. 
With his boosted ego, Ronnie decides to ask Brandi out on a date. On the night of his date, he waits at her house, where he is first greeted by a drunk, and finally, several hours later, greeted by Brandi. 
Undeterred, Ronnie takes her out, pays for her seemingly endless number of shots of alcohol, and deceivingly feeds her the pills that he takes for a unknown condition (his medical condition is never revealed in the film). After engaging in some adult activity, Ronnie decides he is in love with Brandi and no longer needs the pills. 
The psychiatrist from the police examination, on the other hand, doesn’t feel the same way. Ronnie’s obsession with guns and killing people lead him to fail his psychiatric test, thereby preventing him from becoming a police officer. This kicks off a rapid downward spiral for Ronnie as life hits him hard in the face. The movie ends with a surprising conclusion: a revelation of who the mall thief was and a resurgence of the pervert, who appears for one last flash.  
All in all, the movie was average. There were moments during the movie when the audience probably just wanted to get up and leave, but the last five minutes are almost worth waiting for. The ending brings together Ronnie’s whole story along with what he loves and what he believes in, but not without excessive violence, a superfluous amount of vulgar language, and more nudity than you want to see. This movie also gave Seth Rogen another perfect role to play his usual obnoxious, bad-tempered, crude, but sometimes lovable, character.

Dear Joe,
I can’t stand this school. And what is worse are these waves of unknowing prospective students who only hear one side of the story. Tour guides only tell them about the academic intensity, the high job placement rate, and our wonderful computer clusters. If I see a student with an “Admitted” tag, should I pull him aside and give him the real deal?
—Disgusted in Donner
Dear Disgusted,
I’m sorry to hear that Carnegie Mellon isn’t the right fit for you. I guess plaid isn’t for everyone. Keep in mind that you can always transfer, or at least spend more time on Pitt’s campus. But you should really take a look at yourself before you make such rash decisions.
First off, is it really the school that’s causing your misery? Many complain about the kind of people who come to Carnegie Mellon, but the truth is that you can find all types of personalities if you look in the right places. For instance, computer die-hards (keepers of the Linux, as I call them) can be found in clusters, and anyone with a political opinion can be found at Kiva Han. You just have to know where to search.
If your problem is the work load, then try taking easier classes. Believe it or not, there are many ways to get around a tough schedule. If your major is too hard, simply switch majors. Your happiness should come before experience in mechanical systematic multidimensional logical biology in Java.
After all of your soul searching, you may still find that Carnegie Mellon sucks... well, at least for you. Does this mean you should spread the word to other potential students? To put it simply: no. If you’ve found that you don’t belong here, then quietly leave and try not to make a scene. 
And stay out!
—Joe
Dear Joe,
Don’t ask me why, but I listened to your advice column when you suggested that coffee drinking is good for you. Now I’m hooked. It’s gotten to the point that I need coffee to stop, rather than start, shaking. Have you any shame?
—Wired in West Wing
Dear Wired,
To answer your question: yes. I’m ashamed that you would rather bring your question to me rather than think through it yourself over a nice cup of... never mind.
So it looks like you’ve developed quite the habit. With coffee, even though it is absolutely glorious, there does come a breaking point after which it turns into an addictive drug. Now all you need to do is figure out how to combat it.
John Daly, professional golfer, would tell you to take up smoking. According to him, “Caffeine plus nicotine equals protein.” Unfortunately, little to no scientific evidence supports such a claim. Maybe a better alternative would be curbing your cravings with weaker substitutes, like tea or hot chocolate. The road to caffeine independence is long and tiring. To keep you awake, may I suggest a steaming hot cup of... fruit juice? 
Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed,
—Joe

Hipsterism, by common definition, is all about irony — establishing preferences only so one can then establish distance from them. But it might be about more than affected cool. Maybe it’s also the yardstick that measures the distance between you and your own memories.  
One of my first musical memories is my father listening to Rush’s “Roll the Bones.” The CD spins inside a clunky portable player that feeds into the tape deck of his light blue Mazda pickup truck by way of a cassette adapter. 
My legs are curled beneath me, my face pressed up against the herringbone vinyl of the passenger seat, which imprints my cheeks with ruddy crosshatching by the time I wake up. The lights on the Pontchartrain Causeway tigerstripe the concrete.
These lights appear endless. I am told — and I believe — it is the longest bridge in the world.  
I drift in and out of sleep. When I wake up, I crane my neck to look out the driver’s side window. The green of the illuminated numbers on the speedometer glows across my father’s stubble.
Before I go to sleep, I see him slapping Neil Peart’s drum fills into the steering wheel with his fingers stretched out straight.  
The feeling wafting through the dissolute cloud of my 6-year-old consciousness is trust: deep, pervasive trust. Trust that Dad knew the way. Trust that, somehow, despite laws of nature, it was actually my father generating those drum fills. 
Trust that he and that music were the coolest. Trust that we’d get across that infinite bridge, that no matter what the distance between us and home, he would bridge it. 
In a world as volatile as ours, irony can be as much life preserver as pose. It becomes a dialect that subtly remaps the mind, enables it to shrink the daily barrage of the absurd, the grotesque, and the banal to scale. I like irony. I need it. 
But I would be lying if I told you that sometimes I don’t long for a world where there is no distance between me and my memories because the memories don’t even exist yet.

An article documents the advances of “moving pictures in colors.” After mentioning the success of the Lumiere brothers in creating color photography, the article explains how coloring in new films will occur. While films are advancing, the movie industry is still struggling with other effects. Customers, for instance, were somewhat disappointed with the distribution of “2-D glasses” during a presentation of The Great Train Robbery.

It’s Carnival time! With the theme of children’s books, organizations built several impressive booths. Delta Upsilon, a fraternity formerly at Carnegie Mellon, won with their construction of Where’s Waldo? The booth’s exterior was actually a huge head of Waldo, entirely ruining the question the book poses. Phi Kappa Theta grabbed second place with The Wizard of Oz, and KGB took third with Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH. Several notable omissions in books were Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals and Everybody Poops.

A smattering of political speakers invades Carnegie Mellon. First on the list is Chelsea Clinton, who will be speaking on Midway. During the speech, all work on booths will be brought to a standstill. In other words, all booth leaders of organizations will immediately turn into Republicans. Speaking of which, John McCain will speak an hour later in the Wiegand Gym. As all recreational sports will be banned during this time, this means that all badminton players will immediately turn liberal. Politics can certainly be a turbulent subject.

A crowd gathered in McConomy Auditorium last Monday.
Composed of Sneakerology 101 students, faculty, staff, University of Pittsburgh students, and other members of the community, the crowd waited as Robert “Bobbito” Garcia scribbled a series of words on the blackboard.
Garcia was the guest lecturer brought in by the StuCo Sneakerology 101, possibly the only class in America that has a curriculum covering sneakers from Converse to Creative Recreations.
The instructors, Carnegie Mellon seniors Elliot Curtis, a decision science major, and Jesse Chorng, an economics major, were front row, center, ready to receive more knowledge. 
Before the introductions, Curtis said, “This man is a legend, a true aficionado, and to have him here is beyond amazing. I just want to thank everyone who helped to make this possible, and continue to do what Bob says: ‘expose the unexposed.’”
“This is an amazing opportunity to show everyone what we can do and what he has done. It will give our students some perspective on what Elliot and I try and teach in the classroom,” said Chorng.
When he was done writing on the board, Garcia turned around, and the text of his T-shirt read “Where’d You Get Those?: New York’s Sneaker Culture from 1967–1980,” the title of his September 2003 book, an anthropological oral history that describes the functionality and fashion of sneakers during this era. 
On his feet were the LeBron 6 sneakers, in navy blue and white. 
He credited his editors in helping him create the book used as the text for Sneakerology 101.
Garcia, born in 1966 in New York City, is also known as DJ Cucumberslice, Bobbito The Barber, Make It Happen, Boogie Bob, Kool Bob Love, Soul Food Bob, and Bag of Tricks.
After graduating from Wesleyan University in 1988 and playing professional basketball in Puerto Rico, he began working at Def Jam and co-hosted the Stretch Armstrong and Bobbito Show on WKCR 89.9 FM from 1990 to 1998. 
His show featured exclusive demo tapes and in-studio freestyles from many then-unsigned artists, such as Nas, Big Pun, Wu-Tang Clan, Big L, Fugees, and Notorious B.I.G., who later found great success on major record labels.
In addition to DJing all over the world, Garcia remains an editor, writer, cultural critic, streetballer, sneakerhead, and member of the Rock Steady Crew.
Garcia said that a collector is someone who collects sneakers “similar to [the way someone would collect] art, stamps, or coins.” 
He described sneakers as a “reflection of your own personality,” and said that a “connection with your shoes is a connection with others.”
He began a 45-slide PowerPoint presentation that featured pictures from his book. 
Garcia provided facts and figures, prices of pairs, where they were sold, relevant athlete endorsements, and information about why certain color combinations claimed attention in the public sphere. 
He used his slides to explain the evolution of sneaker culture, which featured different pairs of shoes and basketball players who contributed to this “localized grassroots movement of street ball and sneaker culture.”
When asked what surprised him about speaking at Carnegie Mellon, Garcia said, “I’m a humble dude, but I didn’t expect to see my face big up there on the screen. 
“I was shocked. I had seen the poster, but man, oh goodness. And we’re not in a classroom; this is an auditorium. One-hundred plus people were here, and not just CMU,” Garcia said.
“I thought we’d be in a classroom, you know 30 people, but this is on a much grander scale than I imagined. I knew there would be students from the class, but people from Pitt and folk from the city came out.”
Along with Garcia’s visit to the campus, there is other evidence of the widespread and growing popularity of the Sneakerology 101 class. 
The StuCo has been picked up by many blogs and websites, such as (www.hypebeast.com) [www.hypebeast.com], where the class and the sneakers are given high marks.
A special event, Kicksburgh 2009, is planned to feature the limited edition Sneakerology Reebok Reverse Jams, of which only 101 will be made and sold. 
The event kicks off at 5 p.m. in Skibo Gym this Wednesday and will include live music, art, and a break-dancing performance, as well as other clothing and sneaker vendors and an opportunity to donate to The Hill House Association.

In an effort to address rising levels of carbon dioxide emissions and global warming, Congress has recently introduced the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 to try to promote the development of green technology and a decreased dependence on fossil fuels.
Jim Hansen, the director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, argues that one of the major problems associated with global warming and climate change is the possibility of significant rises in sea levels. In an article in The New York Review of Books, Hansen points out that a study of the connections between temperature and sea levels can be obtained from a look at the Earth’s history. He observes that the last time the Earth’s temperature was five degrees higher than temperatures seen today “was three million years ago, when the sea level was about 80 feet higher.” If a similar temperature increase and sea level rise were to be experienced, many East Coast cities, including Boston, New York, and Washington, would be underwater, and the homes of almost 50 million U.S. citizens would be destroyed.
In order to halt the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the bill proposes that a cap and trade system be implemented on carbon dioxide emissions. This method, which proved successful in reducing sulfur dioxide emissions in the early 1990s, consists of setting a limit to the quantity of emissions from a particular group of industries.
The allowed amount of emissions is then divided up into individual permits, which are distributed to each company. Each permit gives the holder the right to emit a certain amount of the pollutant. The companies can then buy and sell the permits as needed to maintain their business. 
Ultimately, those companies that can reduce their emissions most efficiently will benefit financially. This plan allows the market to drive environmental improvement and gives companies flexibility in the manner in which they reduce their emissions.
According to Ed Perry, the global warming coordinator with the National Wildlife Federation, this plan will allow for further development of wind, solar, and geothermal energy sources. Perry stated that “the technology for these green energy sources is there, but a level playing field is not.” By making industries pay for their pollutants, there is more of an economic incentive to pursue alternative energy sources and the “playing field” is effectively leveled.
The cap on carbon dioxide emissions is complemented by a requirement set on utility companies to generate 25 percent of their electricity from renewable resources by year 2025 and the creation of an infrastructure that  will aid the transition to green technology and the creation of green jobs. 
The legislation also takes into account the strong competition between U.S.-based companies and overseas corporations by allocating money for rebates to U.S. companies facing the increased energy prices associated with this cap on carbon.
In the long run, however, Perry commented that the development of green technology in the U.S. is essential if the country is to stay competitive in energy production.
“China, Japan, and Germany are currently the top three solar energy producers,” he said. “We may very well find ourselves relying on the products of other countries for energy sources if we do not start focusing more on research into alternatives to fossil fuels.”
The cap and trade method is not foolproof, however, as pointed out by Emily Bayer, a sophomore civil and environmental and biomedical engineering double major. 
She commented that “cap and trade programs are typically difficult to regulate, and often businesses will generate exceptions to get past new regulations.” Bayer also made the point that many larger companies will “trade to obtain as many permits as possible and go on with business as usual, forcing other companies who don’t have the same resources or leverage to bear the brunt of the regulations.”
These potential problems have not gone unrecognized, and this Thursday, April 16, business, labor, and environmental leaders including Fred Redmond, the international vice president of United Steelworkers; Larry Schweiger, president and CEO of the National Wildlife Federation; and Congressman Jason Altmire will be meeting to discuss solutions to the current energy, environmental, and economic crises. 
The meeting will take place on  the Carnegie Mellon campus in Porter Hall 100 at 7 p.m. Everyone is encouraged to attend; as Perry stated, “Current college students are among those who will be the ones to see and live with the effects of today’s decisions about the environment.”

For many college students, pulling all-nighters becomes a regular part of their lives with increased work but limited time. 
Carnegie Mellon students are no exception, especially with the end of semester quickly approaching. 
First-year psychology major, Srujana Penumetcha commented, “I see more and more people staying up, since the finals are coming soon.”
Students usually rely on coffee to get through the day after staying up late, trying hard not to fall asleep in classes. 
Therefore, coffee is an important part of their lives, Alex Doonan, a first-year civil engineering major, said. 
She usually stays up late most days of the week.
“I consider myself as a regular coffee drinker, and without coffee, I am so tired, just not as awake,” said Doonan.
Coffee is also widespread among faculty at Carnegie Mellon. 
Coffee is an important part of daily routine, said Jonathan Jarvik, a biology professor at Carnegie Mellon.
“It definitely stimulates me. I drink small cups about 10 times throughout the day,” Jarvik added. “I see my colleagues drink coffee as well.”
Caffeine is proven to be an effective stimulant. 
The New York Times recently published an article about the benefits of coffee as a performance enhancer. 
Researchers like Mark Tarnopolsky of McMaster University in Canada support the benefits of drinking coffee.
“Even if you are a regular coffee drinker, if you have a cup of coffee before a workout or a race, you will do better,” Tarnopolsky said in The New York Times.
However, increased dependence on coffee is not without any risk. 
If regular coffee drinkers stop drinking, they can suffer from headaches and agitation.
Five years ago, researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Md., recognized the withdrawal condition as a disorder after reviewing decades of studies. 
They stated that the higher the caffeine intake, the more likely a patient was to suffer from withdrawal symptoms when stopped drinking coffee.
A biology professor, Carrie Doonan, who called herself a reformed coffee drinker, shared her story of cutting down the coffee intake.
“For 15 years, I drank up to six cups a day and that’s how I got through all the work,” said Doonan. She could tell she was addicted to it, because when she drank decaffeinated coffee, she would immediately get headaches.
Moreover, she explained some psychological effects of coffee on her. 
If her coffee appeared less dark or strong than usual, she believed the effects of coffee to be weaker when that wasn’t necessarily true.
With large amounts of coffee everyday, Doonan experienced stomachaches. In addition, she felt more tired with the constant cycle of the coffee and the lack of sleep. Now, she has reduced her coffee intake to two cups a day, replacing it largely with water and tea. 
She feels much better and healthier. “My blood pressure is lower than it used to be,” Doonan said. 
She drinks coffee at night only if she has to stay up late, but she tries to drink tea instead.
Doonan noted the increased presence of energy drinks among students today. 
Energy drinks are said to contain more caffeine and more sugar than coffee, despite claims that they contain healthier ingredients, as well. 
Students can easily get them at Entropy+.
Although energy drinks can be helpful, Doonan shared her concerns about them.
“I see maybe 10 percent of my students who drink energy drinks, but I think their effects are short lived. Once the effect wears off, students tend to crash or even oversleep,” she commented.
While Doonan acknowledges that sometimes students do need to stay up late to finish their work, she recommends, like most parents and teachers, sleeping.
“I believe there is a point in the middle of the night where the quality [of work] comes down even with coffee and energy drinks,” Doonan said. 
“I can sometimes see in lab reports whether it was an all-nighter one or not.”

An unusual state law concerning college admissions is now stirring debate among Texas legislators. The law in question requires all public colleges and universities in Texas to automatically admit students who graduate in the top 10 percent of their high school class.
Percentage admissions policies are not unique to Texas. Two other states, California and Florida, also use percentage admissions policies. California guarantees admission to the University of California system to students who graduate in the top 4 percent of their graduating class. Florida guarantees admission to students ranked in the top 20 percent of their graduating class to one of the 11 state universities. These policies were implemented as a way to promote a more diverse student body.
Legislators advocating a change in the 10 percent law point out the difficulty it poses to competitive institutions, such as the University of Texas at Austin. Because of the law, the institution has lost the ability to admit highly talented students who do not meet the 10 percent requirement due to a large chunk of admission slots’ being given to students who automatically gain admission. Defenders of the law focus on the fact that it diversifies the backgrounds of the students.
The 10 percent law was originally adopted to increase minority enrollments in public universities in Texas. As many high schools in Texas were either predominantly Latino, black, or white, the law secured diverse student bodies that included minority students and students in low-income areas.
Two recent studies both complement and contradict the law. One of the studies shows that the 10 percent law allows many more high schools to send students to UT Austin, rather than the admitted students’ being predominantly from prestigious high schools.
The second study contradicts the purpose of the 10 percent law. Since more applicants are rejected as a result of the 10 percent law, these applicants aim to transfer to UT Austin from other UT campuses. However, the increase in transfer students from other UT campuses led to a difficulty for students aiming to transfer to UT Austin from community colleges. Since many students from low-income families start their college education at community colleges, the study suggests that the 10 percent law actually blocks broader representation.
Michael Steidel, director of admission at Carnegie Mellon, suggested that the 10 percent law is not the only way to receive a diverse student body by comparing the admission review process at the University of Texas to the one at Carnegie Mellon.
“I think the big difference between our process and that of universities such as the University of Texas or University of Florida is that they’re using a formula to try to achieve diversity and we achieve diversity by selecting students through individual review. This year, we received perhaps the most diverse class that we’ve had in quite some time. If we had just applied a formula, we probably wouldn’t be as good at that.”
Although diversity is an important aspect to consider in the admissions process, merit is also a significant factor. Some point out that a percentage-based admission policy may be unfair for students in certain high schools.
Brian Junker, a Carnegie Mellon statistics professor, stated in an e-mail that the law might not necessarily be an effective way to promote diversity or bring academically talented students to universities:
“I support the goal that the top 10 percent rule is trying to achieve. But it has problems: less able students from smaller or less competitive schools can get admission over more able students from larger or more competitive schools; and in practice it depends on non-diversity in high schools in order to create diversity in college. There is no longer a legal reason to keep the top 10 percent rule, and I think there are better ways to achieve diversity at college without sacrificing student quality or the goal of diversity in high schools.”
Nanfei Yan, a first-year physics major, pointed out the difficulty that an admission policy based on percentage might pose for students in more competitive high schools: “Since different high schools set different standards for their students, it’s inevitable that some applicants may feel the policy to be unfair,” she said. “There’s a reason that standardized test scores are considered in the admissions process. At some high schools, the standardized test scores are high, but high GPA scores are more difficult to obtain. So students in certain schools have to work harder to get into the same universities [than students from other schools].”
The Dallas Morning News reported that changes to the law would be made so that it would only apply until a college or university had filled 60 percent of its entering class.
After that, universities would be free to select students on a range of criteria. Although defenders of the law feared that this change would depress minority enrollments, Senator Florence Shapiro stated that UT and other universities would be watched closely so that admissions of minority students would not decline.

Laurel Hill Creek is a major source of clean drinking water and an ideal whitewater rafting spot; now it's among the top 10 on this year’s list of America’s Most Endangered Rivers. The stream has been nominated by the national advocacy non-profit group American Rivers and its partners, and is the seventh river on the list in America’s Most Endangered Rivers: 2009 edition, after the Saluda River in South Carolina, which took sixth place on a similar scale.
“Excessive water withdrawals and increased industrial activity in the region, among other factors, such as a growing tourist industry, have led to such critical damage,” said Liz Garland, associate director of American Rivers' Clean Water Program. 
Located in the small town of Confluence, Somerset County, in southeastern Pennsylvania, Laurel Hill Creek flows into the Youghiogheny watershed, from where most water is withdrawn for ski resorts and hotels that speckle the scenic region. 
According to an article in The Tribune Democrat, development plans in the borough indicate the construction of about 1200 condominiums extended from the resorts, two golf courses, and a bottling facility that may withdraw as much as up to 108,000 gallons per day. 
A major indicator in the deterioration of Laurel Hill Creek is its drastically decelerated flow rate, said Garland. 
“The effects could be really dramatic,” said Garland. “Here we have a river went from a normal flow of roughly 270 cubic feet per second to seeing flows as low as 2.5 cubic feet per second, and this is not going to be sustainable,” she said. 
Another sign that points toward the ill health of Laurel Hill Creek is the condition of the aquatic life in the recesses of this stream. “A low level of flow causes the water temperature to fall, creating an adverse environment for the trout, which are a key component of Laurel Hill Creek,” said Garland.
Laurel Hill Creek is also a significant economic contributor in the region due to its status as a recreation and tourism hotspot, which means that its ailing condition can affect the standards of living of the surrounding communities. 
Student-based environmental groups in Pittsburgh also expressed concern about the possible extinction of a river so close to home.
At the verge of wipeout, Laurel Hill Creek serves as an omen of excessive consumption, said sophomore civil & environmental engineering and modern languages double major Daisy Wang, event coordinator and president-elect of Sustainable Earth, Carnegie Mellon’s flagship environmental club. 
“Personally, this issue reminds me of how the continual growth of human consumption takes a larger and larger toll on our home, the Earth,” said Wang. 
“While some of the human activity which is damaging the Laurel Hill Creek is not completely frivolous [such as the demand for fuel], we will surely reach a breaking point if we as people cannot find a balance between our need to consume and our limited resources,” she said.
Krissy Kasserman, who heads the Youghiogheny Riverkeeper organization with the Mountain Watershed Association, stated in an e-mail, “The issues in this watershed aren't as much a result of the actions of ordinary citizens, but rather that of several large businesses or municipalities withdrawing water.”
She does believe that student environmental groups can contribute by promoting wise water consumption on campus and get involved in demanding pro-environmental policy.
“Students can follow the action alert on the American Rivers website, which calls on Secretary John Hanger of the PA DEP [Department of Environmental Protection] to designate LHC a 'critical water planning area' and offer guidance to water managers and planners in the watershed to help direct future use,” she stated in the e-mail. 
The importance of this river in particular, and the local ecosystem in general, is not just limited to Pennsylvania, but is of universal interest, said Wang.
Sustainable Earth treasurer Sarah Strano, a junior engineering & public policy and civil & environmental engineering double major, is in full agreement. 
“We get a lot of our water from surface waters like rivers; drawing water out at a rate faster than it is replenished is inherently unsustainable. If they are too polluted and depleted to drink, we'll have big problems,” said Strano.
Consulting local representatives about the preservation of Laurel Hill Creek could possibly top Sustainable Earth’s upcoming agenda, said Strano.
“We can talk to our representatives and tell them that we don't support the destruction of the river. Sustainable Earth has advocated a lot for action on climate change, and we could possibly tackle this issue in the future,” she said.
“Policy work is great for students to get involved in,” said Garland. 
Other practices that students can advocate to their school administrations include efficient management of water infrastructure, more funding for green infrastructure, and strengthening the community’s ability to manage water resources by taking small steps toward water conservation, such as preventing wasteful consumption of nature’s most important source of livelihood, she said.

Professor wins teaching award
Jeanne M. VanBriesen, a professor in Carnegie Mellon’s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, was honored as the 2008 Professor of the Year by the Pittsburgh Chapter of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). ASCE gives the award annually to a professor who has shown exemplary teaching ability, professional contributions, integrity, and community service.  
VanBriesen’s passion is water resource engineering. She is the director of WaterQUEST (Water Quality in Urban and Environmental Systems), a Carnegie Mellon research center that examines urban water quality and has nearly $1 million in university seed funding. 
VanBriesen said in a university press release that aging water infrastructure systems are at the base of not only Pittsburgh’s water quality, but also the city’s health and quality of life. She brought up that routine monitoring in Pittsburgh and aging infrastructure cities worldwide, pathogens and fecal indicator bacteria are found at high levels, unsuitable for drinking water and recreational use. 
This is not the first award that VanBriesen has been honored with. She is also the recipient of the 2007 Pennsylvania Water Environment Association Professional Research Award, the 2002 George Tallman Ladd Award from the Carnegie Institute of Technology, and a National Science Foundation Career Award in 2001. 
VanBriesen received her bachelor's degree from Northwestern University in 1990, and her master's and Ph.D. at Northwestern in 1993 and 1998, respectively. 
Students win scholarships
Three Carnegie Mellon juniors have been awarded Barry M. Goldwater scholarships in recognition of their excellence and dedication to the study of science. Carmeline Dsilva, Timothy Helbig, and Swati Varshney were among just under 300 of 1000 student nominees nationwide chosen as recipients. All three hope to pursue a career in research and teaching at the university level, and have credited their experiences thus far at Carnegie Mellon for this choice. 
Dsilva, a chemical engineering major from Lansdale, Pa., has been studying the role of catalysts in methanol fuel cells, hoping to make the process more efficient. She hops to continue research in her new focus of using computer models to predict the effects of carbon dioxide sequestration. 
Helbig, a biological sciences major from Thorofare, N.J., has been examining plant metabolic engineering, aimed at optimizing their biochemical processes. He is currently working with the University of Pittsburgh on thermal tolerance in plants. 
Varshney, a chemistry major from Burlington, Mass., has assisted with the study of polymeric drugs to treat rare genetic diseases. She hops to continue her research of polymeric materials. 
Goldwater Scholars receive one- and two-year scholarships for up to $7500 per year for tuition, fees, books, and room and board. The foundation considers the scholarships to be a stepping stone for future support for their research careers, such as fellowships and Rhodes Scholarships.

I just accepted the bribe of a multi-state summer trip across the U.S. from my parents in exchange for giving up in a long and hard battle for a once-promised solo vacation to Pakistan that they recently refused. While I would love to see more of the United States, what bothers me is the rationale behind their decision: “Pakistan is too unsafe for you to visit on your own.”
My parents are not the only ones trapped by the fear of suicide bombings, U.S. drone attacks in civilian areas, and local conflict between the army and the extremist insurgents — the brunt of which is borne by the ordinary man. I cannot even begin to count how many headlines have screamed the words “Most Dangerous Country in the World” at me with relation to Pakistan — an accolade Pakistanis do not take the least pride in.
However, in the wake of the recent shooting rampages across the United States, are we really in a position to judge if one country is safer than another? I say “we” because I speak as someone who lives in this community and embraces it as her own.
It isn’t just one odd case we’re talking about here. According to a news report on ABC News, about 148 people have recently lost their lives to random killings, for absolutely no rhyme or reason. High schools, college campuses, malls, nursing homes, hospitals, offices, and even churches are the venues of these repulsive crimes. In cases like those of the man who shot dead his ex-wife’s entire family, a mother who stabbed her teenage daughter in the chest, and a young man who beheaded (yes, that “barbaric” practice from Saudi Arabia) his own sister, brutal killings by family members have been committed in the so-called “safety” of private homes.
Worse, the trend only seems to heighten. Even a small, relatively safe college city like Pittsburgh had its share of tragedy last week, when three honorable police officers from the Pittsburgh Police Department were shot dead by a young man when his neurotic mother decided to call 911 because the dog had urinated on the porch.
A look at the larger West shows similar criminal activity ruthlessly claiming innocent lives in the U.K., Scotland, Canada, and Germany. If this isn’t a pure waste of life, then what is? If this isn’t terrorism, then what is? Geert Wilders, a filmmaker from Holland who recently claimed that “although not all Muslims are terrorists, all terrorists are Muslims,” needs to seriously educate himself on this one.
Rhetoric is a powerful tool. I know that this isn’t a phenomenal observation, but it is actually quite amazing how rhetorical strategies and word choices influence the way we perceive people and their actions. The “patriot” versus the “nationalist,” “colonialism” versus “civilizing mission,” or the “freedom fighter” as opposed to the “terrorist” are just some stale instances of masking the ugly truths of our society and exposing those of others. And that is precisely what the U.S. has been doing in the post-9/11 world. How is someone who shoots dead 10 other people and takes his own life different from a suicide bomber? Are violent shooting rampages somehow on a higher moral ground than a massive bombing? Why is this murderer given a fair trial when an “alleged” terrorist is sent to be tortured in a detention camp? Is the only difference that these people aren’t grouped under an umbrella term like “al Qaeda” or the “Taliban”? What makes those bloodthirsty monsters any different from their terrorist counterparts on the other side of the world, and why should they be treated any differently?
The sad truth is that the U.S. has its own very large terrorist base. The sadder and more frustrating truth is that, as opposed to identified terrorist groups in the Middle East and South Asia, the American terrorist can be almost anyone who has a sudden flip of mind from a random sample of Americans. However, while the U.S. has been taking its sweet time devising its own gun control agenda, it does not hesitate for a second in arming extremist groups and militias in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
The U.S. contains elements that do not desire peace and freedom, because an infringement of my safety is an infringement of my freedom. So do Pakistan and Afghanistan, with growing extremist influence contaminating their society. But if the U.S. views its growing terrorism problem from this perspective, would it not have to attach the stigma of a “terrorist state” to its own entity?
Before allocating thousands of American soldiers to the borders of Pakistan and Afghanistan, the Obama administration must commit itself to stamping down its own branch of terrorism and rooting out its own terrorists. And not just the U.S. — the Western world needs to address the terrorism rotting its own society instead of judging the character of Muslim immigrants in their countries. Countries like the U.K., which recently released a report in which almost 200 Muslim children were identified as “potential terrorists,” should be condemned for carrying out such discriminatory exercises.
Whether motivated by an extremist ideology, a sick state of mind, or economic depression, murder is a crime against humanity. And anyone who commits such atrocity deserves to be prosecuted in the same way as an “enemy combatant” would, for the simple reason that these home-grown terrorists within the U.S. are as much of an enemy of the U.S. as any other foreign terrorist organization would be.
The million-dollar question is, what do I prefer? Am I safer when there is a possibility of my being blown up in a ludicrous Taliban plot, or am I better off when there is an equal chance of being shot dead according to some coldblooded psycho’s agenda? It’s one of those questions that make you want to bury yourself under your covers and pretend that these terrorists on both sides of our world are merely figments of your imagination.
Marium Chandna (mchandna@) believes that the polar bear who mauled a woman in Berlin is a terrorist and should be packaged to a detention camp.

For undergraduate students, this weekend will bring with it childhood fun and wild times, and for some, hard labor and plenty of splinters. Starting Wednesday night, Carnegie Mellon undergraduates will forget coursework — for once — and rejoice in Carnival, with fun typically attributed to those under the age of 12.
For most first-years, that age represents two-thirds of their current age. Even for fifth-year students, 12 years is more than half the time they have been alive. Carnival manufactures nostalgia for a time within a decade ago for these undergraduate students.
Meanwhile, hiding deep within their computer clusters and research labs, doctoral students trudge on, oblivious to the raucous behavior occurring outside their Wean Hall homes — out in the terrifyingly bright sun, if the weather smiles on us. Even though Thursday and Friday classes are canceled for most of campus, graduate students continue to work on projects, bury their noses in books and studies, and go to meetings with advisers and research partners.
In one of my courses, the instructor was discussing the schedule for the rest of the semester. One student pointed out that she had planned a class on April 16 — the Thursday of Carnival.
“You graduate students aren’t going to be involved with that,” the professor exclaimed, frustrated she could not hold class on that day. “It’s an undergrad thing.”
Students in the class looked to me at this comment. My academic colleagues are aware that I am an atypical graduate student — I actively participate in campus organizations and remain on campus for things other than my research. I’ve eaten dinner at Schatz and paid for my greasy, late-night Underground repast with DineX. I spend nearly all of my free time in the University Center and a good deal of my social life with undergraduate students.
Still, my anomalies aside, graduate students have the same opportunities to dedicate time and energy to the campus that undergraduates do. While most graduate students will not be putting in 20+ hours this week constructing a booth like I will, they can venture away from their computer or out of the library for a few hours this weekend and experience the hard labor that scores of fellow students have devoted to bring a fun and memorable Carnival to the whole campus.
The scents of deep-fried Oreos and funnel cakes will permeate the Morewood parking lot, a space soon to be filled with carnival rides and games. Robots — referred to as “mobots” — will race along the chalk path outside Wean Halls. Pocket-sized students will be shoved up and down hills in tiny soap-box cars. There will be a comedy show on Thursday and a concert on Friday. Of course, for the undergrads, one of the most important aspects is Booth.
Student organizations — in which graduate students can take an active role, though most do not — construct shacks that contain unique and original games. This year’s theme, Epic Adventures, is sure to inspire creative designs following a variety of ideas, from Indiana Jones to Where the Wild Things Are. Even if they’re not putting in the labor hours of booth construction, graduate students can support this hard work by growing down a little and playing games.
Carnegie Mellon, as a whole, takes this event seriously: Several dining locations will have extended hours and prime parking spaces, and several roads within and around campus will be out of use for days. While some parts of the campus community — such as the Heinz College, which has not canceled Thursday and Friday classes — may not consider it a big deal, most of the campus will turn its attention to this weekend and its events.
Graduate students are a significant part of this school, bringing groundbreaking research and powerful awards to the university. Unfortunately, many of the undergrads never see them; graduate students rarely become part of the Carnegie Mellon social scene. The easiest first step is to take part in the major campus phenomenon known as Carnival.

Hearing any news about altering the way people’s memories work always makes me think of the movie Paycheck. In this movie, the protagonist, an inventor, is hired to do a top-secret job, and then injected with a drug when he’s done so that he will forget all of the top secret work that he’s just completed. Of course, it turns out that he’s invented something terrible, and has to remember what exactly it is, using clues that he left himself before his memory was erased.
What always interested — and frightened — me about the movie, though, was the thought of having part of my memory completely and totally erased. I am a bit of a control freak at times, and the thought of not being in control of my own memories makes me more than a bit nervous. I was always able to comfort myself, however, with the thought that it was just a movie, and nothing more. Now, though, it turns out that may not exactly be true.
Scientists recently used an experimental drug in animal testing that when delivered to the brain, could block the activity of a substance that the brain needs to retain information in such areas as emotional associations, spatial knowledge, or motor skills. If enhanced, the drug could potentially help ward off dementia and other memory problems.
Of course, I think that any drug that could help combat dementia is worth investigating. I know firsthand how sad — and scary — it is for someone to lose their memories, and what an effect it has on that person and on others around them. However, I think that before diving headfirst into the benefits that this drug could have, we need to take a step back and look at all of its possible ramifications.
Sure, at first glance, it sounds like a dream come true. In addition to helping get rid of memory problems, the drug could also be used to help cure people of their fears, by getting rid of the first, frightening memory, or by erasing a particularly painful memory that has reshaped a person’s outlook on life.
But there’s a reason why our fears and our memories exist — they help to make us the people we are today. Fears remind us to be cautious about things. For example, being afraid of fire, or drowning, or heights are all fears that are based in legitimate things people need to be cautious of. And while painful memories certainly aren’t pleasant to think about, what good would it do to get rid of those memories just because they’re sad? Memories, both good and bad, make people what they are. It’s not just nature that shapes people — it’s their influences, their actions, their memories.
Plastic surgery, once a medical procedure geared toward burn or accident victims, has taken on a life of its own, and become less medically related and more of a facet of popular culture. Breast augmentations, now known as cosmetic surgery, have been removed from the realm of the medical field, and are now open to anyone who is unsatisfied with their appearance. And this is exactly what I fear will happen to the use of memory-altering drugs. Instead of being reserved for cases of medical necessity, like fighting dementia or helping to combat a seriously life-debilitating fear, the drugs will enter mainstream culture and be used to wipe out anything unpleasant.
If you’ve ever read The Giver, you know the emptiness that a life without memories could be. And while I don’t think that the memory loss drugs would ever approach such wide-spread use in society as in the book, I do believe that the drugs could lead to a number of problems in the future.
I’m not saying that I think the memory loss drugs should be completely be disregarded. The drugs, if used correctly and carefully, have a great potential for helping to cure dementia and other memory problems. But I am saying that researchers and doctors need to be very cautious when investigating these drugs and really look into their boundaries and limits. The more that is known about them, the less chance their use will become out of hand.
Heather Tomko (htomko@) has control issues and wants to keep all her memories... the good, the bad, and the ugly.

It’s possible — an American automaker can make wise decisions all on its own without federal aid.
The Ford Motor Company is the only American automaker that has not asked for a bailout from the federal government, yet as of last Monday, it had managed to reduce its debt by 38 percent, or $9.9 billion.
Not only has Ford chosen to use its own funds to buy back millions of dollars of debt, but their smart decision-making skills are also showcased in their decision to reach an agreement with the United Automobile Workers (UAW) union on retiree health care. Not surprisingly, General Motors and Chrysler have yet to reach an agreement with the UAW about their health care obligations. Ford’s work with the UAW is also a testament to the company’s goodwill toward its employees and consumers, an achievement that General Motors and Chrysler have yet to accomplish.
While the government has given billions of dollars to the GM and Chrysler enterprises, neither corporation has achieved the same level of success as Ford.
Employing individualism, weathering through adversity, and making commercials full of trucks and mud — these are the values in the hearts of all Americans, and Ford has clearly demonstrated its fidelity to these values and to Americans.
We applaud Ford’s decisiveness and independence from the government during the present economic downturn. As the media constantly barrages viewers with negative coverage of botched bailout plans and corporate financial corruption, we appreciate the positive, refreshing news of an American industry succeeding.
We sincerely hope that all American industries are able to follow Ford example and manage to pull through the recession. Meanwhile, Ford gets a gold star from us for not completely wasting the government’s — and the people’s — money.

It’s that time again, Buggy lovers young and old. Carnival is upon us. It has been a year of innovation, as seven different teams have come out with new buggies this year. Some look fast, some not so fast. Some old organizations look rejuvenated, and some of the up-and-coming organizations are making more progress. The weather has done all it can to stifle freerolls this spring, but organizations are coming out and looking competitive nonetheless. Last year, I got back on track, picking the men’s and women’s champions; I’m confident in a repeat performance this year. Without further ado, the women’s races look to end up as follows:
Sig Ep’s women will get their buggy across the finish line in under three minutes, which should be good for a sixth-place finish and a Day 2 showing. Sig Nu has a fast new buggy that may just be light enough for women to get through the course. They’ll finish fifth, at the back of a pack in the 2:40–2:50 range. Right there with them will be the women of SPIRIT, fast as ever (if only they had a buggy to match). They’ll finish fourth. Nearing the 2:40 threshold will be Fringe’s A-team women, pushing one of Fringe’s garage-full of fast, light buggies.
The top two teams will likely hold steady from last year. PiKA and SDC seem to have made a technological leap past Fringe last year, and that advantage should keep them on top of the women’s races. PiKA will come in second with a weaker push team. Nobody will match the speed of SDC’s women, who are really only competing with last year’s record.  A year of experience for those girls should mean flirting with another sub-2:30 time, but a new record would require quite a few stars to align.
The men’s teams have a familiar feel. The powerhouses of Fringe, PiKA, and SDC are rolling fast again, but SPIRIT and Sigma Nu are back in the game, while Sig Ep and KDR seem to be closing the technology gap. All in all, the men’s competition is shaping up to be competitive and exciting again this year. While I don’t see any new records coming through the chute this time around, the men’s teams will still put on a great show. After crunching the numbers, I’ve settled on a men’s top 10:
Beta Theta Pi is back out on the course this year with as good a push team as anyone. Though I haven’t seen them out often, they could be competitive with better technology. As it is, they’ll round out the top 10 and make a Day 2 appearance on push team strength alone. Coming in ninth place should be Fringe’s solid B team with a speedy downhill time. Eighth place will find another B team, this one from PiKA. It looks like their push team depth is starting to wear itself out, as they will be lucky to have two buggies make Day 2.
When mentioning rejuvenated old organizations, I'll refer to none other than SPIRIT and Sigma Nu. Zoo alumni wouldn’t stand for two years out of the top 10, and they won’t have to.  As long as their new buggy doesn’t experience a loss of mass from its newspaper-mâché hatch, the zoo will have a great downhill and a lacking push team; enough for a seventh-place finish. The six spot will go to KDR. They are getting better at building and rolling their buggies, but those push teams that put them in the sub-2:15 range are missing from the equation.
Sneaking into the top five, and taking second place among the Greeks, will be Sig Ep. The men still seem a bit booth-heavy, but seem to be making strides in buggy construction and wheel technology. With one of the largest houses around to field a push team, they’ll roll the course in under 2:15. SPIRIT is also making a comeback, with a rebuilt buggy from their glory days and dedication out at rolls. Look for them to repeat their fourth-place performance from last year, but going sub-2:10 again will prove difficult, especially if they aren’t chasing on the back hills.
The top three will look familiar once again, as Fringe, PiKA, and SDC have all the fastest times I’ve seen this spring. Fringe is sure going to miss those big Beta pushers this year, especially since it looks like their fastest buggy hasn’t been their A-team one.  Without Banyan getting the same freeroll times as their other buggies, Fringe has their work cut out for them on the back hills. It will prove difficult enough for them just to hold off SPIRIT's A-team speedsters for third place.
Coming down to the finish, we have the familiar record-breaking pair from last year: PiKA and SDC. They provided us with one of the most exciting race days ever last year, and both look quick again. PiKA had a mishap with the hay bales this fall, but they have looked strong in the spring. However, they will watch a superior push team and technology pass them up on race day. Finally breaking the PiKA streak this year will be the speedy new SDC buggy. White wheels and a black buggy look like a winning combination. If The dorms can keep their back axle far enough away from the hay bales, their track team back hills will sprint to a championship.
Well, there you have it: another year of predictions. Good luck to all the teams. As always, I’ll be there on race day, well hidden in plain sight.

President Robert Mugabe met with other leaders of Zimbabwe in Cape Town, South Africa in the first week of April, seeking $8.5 billion of emergency recovery aid from international donors. In addition to their request, they made a number of promises for their next 100 days, including media freedom reform in a nation that has seen tight restriction in recent years.
Over the past decade, Mugabe’s control over the Zimbabwean press has grown, and many news sources have been banned, including The Daily News, along with most foreign news sources, including BBC, CNN, and Fox News.
The primary reason Zimbabwe’s government needs foreign aid to operate is the devaluation of its currency, to a point where it has become completely useless; the country’s newspaper — The Zimbabwean — just released a number of billboard ads wallpapered with trillions of Zim-dollars. For this reason the country’s economic system has reverted to bartering, with the government only recently having started to pay their employees with certificates good for U.S. currency.
This promise for reform of the media laws is intended to encourage donations, in a measure of goodwill toward potential international partners. We are suspicious, however, of how much of an impact a promise that has not yet been put into action can have on the nation’s floundering economy.
The struggling country has seen some recent economic progress with the newly elected Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai. The work of his education minister, David Coltart, has even brought teachers back to long-closed classrooms with the promise of payment in foreign currency. The government hopes that the promise for media freedom will build upon the improvements started by Coltart.
While these small steps are encouraging, the long-standing history of governmental corruption and mismanagement is nowhere near being a thing of the past. Mugabe still presents every new minister with a brand new E-Class Mercedes — an offer turned down by Coltart and a handful of other progressive newcomers to Zimbabwe politics.
These governmental promises for an open media and free airwaves are especially important with the corruption still present in the government. They are necessary for the development of any successful nation, and the international community must hold Mugabe’s administration accountable by taking advantage of the opportunity of loosened media laws to report the struggles of Zimbabwe’s people.
While we support Zimbabwe’s promise for media reform, we do not believe that the promise is a fair trade for the amount of aid that the country hopes to see pour in — people want to see action of reform, not just promises of it.

In a world in which so much is happening — wars are being fought on so many fronts, new means of technology are helping us to process information at speeds never before imaginable, languages and cultures are growing — there is no room for humanity to step backward. But a new bill in Afghanistan is slated to do just that.
The bill — intended to give the minority Shia community their own identity, in a land largely populated by Sunni Muslims — brings with it several key facets that not only reduce the rights of a woman relative to her male family members, but seriously mar Afghanistan’s international reputation with regard to the human rights of its people.
The most recent draft of the bill includes tenets that prohibit women from leaving their homes without permission from a male relative, and that prohibit them from stopping their husbands from forcing sexual intercourse upon them.
We’re happy that President Obama has spoken out against the bill, as have several significant international human rights organizations. While the new President’s foreign affairs agenda is quickly becoming filled, it is commendable that he has acknowledged the imminent need to dismiss such an unfathomable abomination to the progression of human rights.
The United States and Afghanistan may be extremely physically and culturally disparate, but basic human rights are universal. Rape should never be allowed under law.
Since the removal of the Taliban regime from Afghanistan in 2001, some progress has been made for women’s rights in the country. Called “the victims of political games” by the prominent female Afghan parliamentarian, Fawzia Koofi, women in Afghanistan have been subjected to many levels of physical confinement and sequestering throughout the country’s history, and it is imperative that this new bill does not allow the country to take steps backward at this crucial time in history.
Allowing rape under law, or even just the necessity for male permission to leave the house, does not respect the equality of women and men, and would certainly be the step backward that cannot be allowed.
This new bill far from represents the global information system or the transfer of technology and knowledge that we know to be possible — and that Afghanistan must quickly join in to avoid being left behind in the race toward the globalized future. While not every country can — or even should — be like the United States or some Western European nations, there are humanistic standards that must be acknowledged and followed.

This letter is in response to the numerous articles covering the controversy surrounding the issue of stem cell research.
As someone who has been pro-life all their life, I believe life begins at the point of conception, and that those conceived under the laws of the United States are protected by the Constitution and therefore are entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Now has come the day where science has made it possible to freeze an embryo outside the body of a human female. The embryo’s natural development into a fully functioning human being is then blocked by being frozen until the time arrives when it will eventually be transferred back to a woman in order to have a baby. The natural progression begins again and results in the birth of a child no different than any other human being.
The controversy surrounding stem cell research concerns the idea of using “leftover” embryos as a means of repairing or replacing damaged tissues or organs of those who suffer daily. It has been said there is no greater sacrifice than to lay down one’s life for the life of another. As much as I am pro-life, I am also pro-quality-of-life, and see this as an opportunity for one life that may be discarded as “leftover” to serve to improve another’s life and hence allow that healed person to not only continue living, but live their lives to also help life to continue. I know that if I were to be discarded as “leftover” rather than be given the chance to help my fellow human being, then all would have been in vain. Many of us are called to perform extraordinary feats as we experience this existence called the human race. I can think of no greater feat than to go from being a “leftover” to someone who was able to lighten the burden of another person and perhaps extend their life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness.

Hey Tartans,
Congratulations Carnival Committee on a successful and efficient Move-On on Friday. Good luck to all organizations participating in Booth and Buggy this upcoming weekend.
This week, Pooja and I want to highlight another event that student government is sponsoring. I’ve said before that it is important for Carnegie Mellon students to be involved in local politics, because for the four years that we are living in Pittsburgh, we represent more than just visitors of this city. We use public transit, work for local businesses, and live in off-campus apartments. Pooja and I have made a concentrated effort — which I’ve rarely seen from our student government over the past four years — to work with other Pittsburgh colleges and to talk with local politicians in an effort to become more versed in the issues that affect our students.
Beyond student government’s taking a more active position, I’d really like to see students become more knowledgeable and active about local issues. Recently, we were approached with the chance to sponsor an event that we hope will encourage more students on campus to get involved. On Wednesday, April 29, Pooja and I, with the help of the Student Senate and Graduate Student Assembly, will be co-sponsoring a Pittsburgh mayoral debate on campus for the Democratic primary election in May. The location of the debate is currently Porter Hall 100, with the potential to change. Our hope is that students who attend the debate will not only become knowledgeable about the candidates, but will also have the opportunity to learn about some of the most important local issues impacting students.
Carnegie Mellon is a major source of pride to this city. Each year, approximately 10 percent of graduating seniors decide to make Pittsburgh their permanent home. This influx of highly intelligent, young professionals is invaluable. As such, we students have the influence to really make an impact on the outlook of this city. Politicians want to hear our voice, want to know our concerns, and want to see that we care.
Besides the debate, Megan Larcom, our chief of staff, is organizing a Coffee and Conversations event before the debate at 4:30 p.m., where students can meet with Councilman Bill Peduto and learn about some of the topics that will be discussed at the debate. I want to encourage all of you to attend both events. Carnegie Mellon students should be knowledgeable and deserve to have a say. Until then, enjoy Carnival! And ride the Loop: It will be operational for Carnival weekend!
