Here at the end of August, I find the state of the Pittsburgh Pirates fan base to be perplexing.
If I said your team was third in the division and seven games out of first, how would you feel?  Does being fourth in the wild card race make you feel any better? 
However, the Pirates seem to have built up a fury of spirit and enthusiasm among the Bucco faithful. While there isn’t a lot to be excited about, it’s understandable that after two decades of sheer mediocrity, it’s easy to please the city of Pittsburgh.
The last time the Pirates finished with a win-loss record above .500 was 1992. With roughly a month left this season, the Pirates sit 10 games above that .500 mark at 68–58. The last time the Pirates had a Most Valuable Player was in 1992 as well, when outfielder Barry Bonds won his second MVP before leaving for the San Francisco Giants. But this year, outfielder Andrew McCutchen is leading the MVP race with a .346 batting average to lead the National League, and is posting 24 homeruns and 78 runs batted in. 
No player is more valuable to his team than McCutchen, who has a 6.0 wins above replacement rating, a tie with New York Mets third baseman David Wright. It seems the Pirates are headed in the right direction. But very quickly this façade of success — let’s call it the “era of mediocrity goggles” — will fade and the Bucco Nation will expect more.
For example, the Pirates’ pitching has been fantastic this season. But while pitcher A.J. Burnett could be an ace over the next few seasons, it’s hard to believe that the team can count on pitchers John Karstens and James MacDonald to consistently play well. MacDonald has yet to finish a season with an earned run average under 4.0, and Karstens has been injury prone, to say the least.
On the bright side, Joel Hanrahan has been the second-best closer in the National League — behind the Reds’ Aroldis Champan — without argument.
There are certainly some good things happening with Pittsburgh’s baseball scene, and fans should be excited about what the team has done on the field. But I’m afraid that excitement will quickly result in setting unrealistic expectations.
Simply put, the Pirates is not a playoff team. There is not enough offense, there are pitching uncertainties, and the team plays in the toughest division in the National League. The Cincinnati Reds hold a seven-game lead over the Pirates, which is a lot to make up in a month.
They still have a chance for one of  two wild card spots and a chance to play the Atlanta Braves, miles ahead of the rest of the wild card race. 
But with the Los Angeles Dodgers’ new ownership bringing in over $250 million of payroll in one trade, the wild card race may not be close for long.
But what the Pirates do have a chance at — other than ending the streak of losing seasons — is rebuilding a fan base that was indifferent after seasons of mediocrity.
I am a strong believer in a superstar’s ability to ignite excitement among fans.Although McCutchen has been the only bright spot in this season’s offense, if he can get MVP at the end of it, those aforementioned and horribly named goggles will last a little longer.

Hailing from Oak Brook, Ill., senior forward Brianna Magill is gearing up for her final soccer season at Carnegie Mellon.
Magill recalled what she felt were her greatest accomplishments over the past three years of playing on the team.
“My proudest moment on the team was last year, when we played at Johns Hopkins and forced them into double overtime.
Even though it ended in their favor, it was a great team effort and showed us that we can play with the best teams in the nation.
They ended up being undefeated for the season and [were] very highly ranked,” she said.
She began playing soccer at age five, and has enjoyed improving her game over the years. “The most rewarding part about being a CMU athlete is getting the opportunity to travel and represent the university across the nation,” Magill said.
For her last season on the team, Magill is ready to challenge herself. 
“Our team goals for the season are to win the UAA Championships and make it to the NCAA playoffs. I think we have a really good chance of reaching both of these goals, because we’re already playing better soccer than last year,” she said.
Playing on the team allowed her to establish a deep connection with her teammates. 
“My favorite part about being on the soccer team is being around my friends all the time. Even though it’s a lot of hard work, it’s worth it to be surrounded by my best friends everyday,” Magill said.
“Bri has great energy and brings a lot of joy to practice. She is always making people laugh. 
On the field, she is fierce and one of the key pieces to our offense,” said senior midfielder Stephanie Hare.
Magill was quick to share some of the funnier moments of her collegiate soccer career. “Our coach told us to get on the end line, which normally means we’re about to do a fitness test. At the last second he told us we could go home. A few of us started crying because we were so happy,” Magill recalled.
This year, Magill plans to finish her degree in business administration, with a focus on manufacturing management and consulting, and a minor in sociology. 
After graduation she hopes to have a job in management consulting in either New York or her home state of Illinois.

With training camp wrapped up and less than two weeks until the NFL starts its regular season, it is time to take a look at some off-season story lines and how they will affect the Pittsburgh Steelers once the games start to matter.
One of the biggest changes involved the coaches rather than players. Todd Haley, former head coach of the Kansas City Chiefs, was brought in to replace offensive coordinator Bruce Arians. Art Rooney II, the Steelers’ president and co-owner, wanted to reinvigorate the offense, believing that the plays had grown flat and that traditional Steeler smash-mouth football was not what it used to be.
Judging by the high-flying offense used while he was the offensive coordinator for the Arizona Cardinals during their Super Bowl run, Haley brings a more abrasive personality to the table. After starting quarterback Ben Roethlisberger’s public support of the fired Arians, fans are curious about how Big Ben will work with the temperamental Haley.Will this change bring some life back to the stale Pittsburgh offense?
Part of the problem with the Steelers’ offense last season was keeping Roethlisberger upright and healthy in the pocket.
To address this need, the team took guard David DeCastro out of Stanford University and offensive tackle Mike Adams from Ohio State University in the April rookie draft.
Adding these young talents next to third-year pro-bowl center Maurkice Pouncey transforms the offensive line from a revolving door of injured veterans to a young core that could dominate the league for years to come.
So far in training camp, DeCastro has looked fantastic as right guard, making few mental errors and showing good footwork and fundamentals.
Adams has looked more like a rookie, struggling to adjust to guarding Roethlisberger’s blind side at the left tackle position.
It’s unreasonable to expect these young linemen to play to their full potential this year, but they should be improvements from last year’s team and they will grow as this season continues.
Another tale from the off-season is Mike Wallace’s holdout.
The starting wide receiver was offered a standard restrictive free agent contract, which — while far below market value — is all the Steelers are required to give him.
Wallace showed his displeasure by holding out on team activities, including workouts, training camp, and preseason games.
Unfortunately for him, Wallace’s holdout has only allowed wide receiver Antonio Brown to further cement his place as the Steelers’ top offensive playmaker, paving the way for him to become the center of the offense.
This gives fans a lot of hope, and eliminates most of the leverage Wallace had to negotiate with.
Wallace is scheduled to end his holdout and rejoin the team, but he may have already lost his top receiver role.
The injuries that plagued the Steelers at the end of last season can still be felt. Starting running back Rashard Mendenhall has been in rehab with a torn ACL and is not expected back at full speed until October at the earliest.
His replacement, Issac Redman, is currently nursing a hip injury and has no timetable for return.
On the defensive side of the ball, the situation is not much better as the first- and second-string right outside linebackers, James Harrison and Jason Worilds, are still recovering from surgeries. Starting nose tackle Casey Hampton is currently working to come back from knee and elbow injuries that sidelined him at the end of last year.
The team is returning with the same core players on offense and defense, but looks to be taking a new philosophy on both sides of the ball.
With the addition of Haley and the new offensive linemen, Pittsburgh is poised to put up one of its best offensive seasons in recent memory — that is, if Wallace is still sharp after missing camp and if Brown keeps on track to become one of the league’s great receiving threats.
On defense, the team is trying to transition to a younger group of players, but the suffocating defensive play we have all grown accustomed to will probably remain.
Even though they play in one of the toughest football divisions with the playoff-bound Baltimore Ravens and up-and-coming Cincinnati Bengals, the Steelers should make the playoffs, assuming that Roethlisberger stays vertical and the injury report stays clear.

Do you want to avoid the intense time commitment associated with varsity or club sports, but still want to stay in shape and maintain a healthy lifestyle? To strike that balance, there are plenty of ways to stay active on campus that will fit into any schedule.
Carnegie Mellon has a range of gyms — both big and small — for those who like to work out on their own. The majority of dormitories contain small gyms with a few cardio machines. These are convenient for quick workouts in the comfort of your own dorm. This is a great option for people afraid of letting others see them working up a sweat.
“I enjoy working out in Fairfax if I am too lazy to go to campus, but if I am on campus I enjoy working out in the UC pool or Skibo,” said senior business major Dan Griffith.
Skibo Gymnasium, which has a weight room on its first floor, is open to all students. There is an area on the second floor where intramural floor hockey is played and a room for fencing practices on the third floor. However, the weight room on the third floor is only open to varsity athletes.
Many students enjoy working out in the University Center. There is an array of equipment, including weights, machines, treadmills, and ellipticals. The University Center is a prime location for working out because of its flexible hours. During the school week, the gym opens at 6 a.m. and closes at 2 a.m.
Students are required to get a wrist band from the equipment desk on the first floor before entering any of the University Center’s fitness facilities.
The University Center is also home to racquetball courts and Wiegand Gymnasium, which has two full basketball courts.
When the weather is nice, another place to work out is outside around campus. There are six tennis courts in the middle of campus that you can reserve at the equipment desk in the University Center.
When the track and field team is not practicing, the track is great for an outdoor run. If you are more adventurous, a run through Schenley Park provides a great change of scenery.
“It depends on the day: Sometimes [I workout] in Skibo, sometimes in the UC, but lately I have been going for runs in Schenely Park,” said senior chemical engineering major Neil Soni.
If you are someone who needs more motivation to work out, Carnegie Mellon also provides a range of fitness classes. During the week, students can find time for popular classes like yoga or spinning. Carnegie Mellon also offers classes like African-Caribbean Dance and Masala Bhangra. No prior experience is necessary for any of these classes.
Another fitness option is intramural sports. There are many options for intramural sports: soccer, tennis, and softball, among others. It only takes a couple of friends to make a team, depending on the sport. It is a small commitment, usually only one or two shortened games a week. If you make the playoffs and win an intramural championship, you and your team win Intramural Champions T-shirts.
However you like to work out, you can find a place to do it at Carnegie Mellon.

Marcel Just, a professor in the department of psychology and the director for the Center for Cognitive Brain Imaging, is the 2012 winner of the Society for Text and Discourse Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award.
“Marcel has been a pioneer in psycholinguistic research for four decades, employing cutting-edge technologies for understanding online reading comprehension in healthy individuals, as well as individuals with autism, dyslexia, and brain damage,” according to the program from the award ceremony. “He was one of the first to use fMRI to investigate the neural bases of reading comprehension.”
In Just’s own opinion, his main contribution is his work toward a better understanding of relating language comprehension to its interplay with brain function. The goal of his research is to explain the psychological processes, such as parsing or meaning retrieval, in order to give a description of brain functioning at the brain-system level.
“It is a great honor when your colleagues say, ‘This is great work.’ It is always extremely heartening when one’s colleagues acknowledge or honor a contribution,” Just said. 
Although Just was honored to receive the award, he expressed the importance of having one’s own values to drive research. “You have to develop your own sense of values of what is important, of what is progressing well, what innovations to pursue, which old lines of research to put aside,” he said.
Just received the award in Montreal in July. In the same month, he gave a keynote lecture titled “Changing Brains for Changing Times,” which focused on the fact that the human brain is much more malleable and flexible than scientists previously thought. 
“We know that, in information processing terms, you could learn new things, but what I think wasn’t quite appreciated was how overt, measurable, and large the biological changes are in the brain,” he explained.
By performing small perceptual tasks, such as learning how to write backwards, Just said, one can change the circuitry in the brain in as little as four-and-a-half hours. The circuitry that consists of cells that transmit signals from one region of the brain to another, referred to as “white matter,” makes up 45 percent of the brain.
“Wherever you go in life, you’re constantly learning things, and what you’re doing is changing your brain,” Just said.
There are hindrances alongside the benefits of brain malleability. For example, post-traumatic stress disorder significantly changes the hippocampus, a major memory-associated component of the human brain. Chronic stress also causes measurable changes in the hippocampus. 
“We need to appreciate that the way we live our lives really has an impact on our brains,” he said.
In the early 2000s, Just’s research team helped with a large project in Pittsburgh studying children with dyslexia. The scientists gave them 100 hours of instruction, in which they were taught how to decode words. At the end of this remedial training, the dyslexic children were significantly better readers. The children’s white matter had changed, showing similarities to normal readers.
“There are many brain disorders that affect the white matter, and now we know that we can fix the white matter behaviorally,” Just said. 
An ongoing project of Just’s team involves a theory of autism the team developed called “frontal posterior under-connectivity,” which states that the major issue with autism is the connectivity between the front part of the brain and the posterior parts. Just’s team has observed that white matter in people with autism is different than those without the disorder.
“All this points to a way to develop therapies, to diagnose people with greater certainty, to develop biological markers of autism,” Just said.

From childhood scrapes to the removal of wisdom teeth, the human body displays an amazing ability to heal itself. Once an injury occurs, a cascade of chemical reactions begins in a carefully regulated, multistep process until the damage is repaired.
Oftentimes we take this ability for granted and take risks that can lead to severe injuries. Without the healing process, our bodies would not be able to endure all the damage we expose them to throughout our lifetimes. Imagine the extreme care that would have to be taken if our bodies didn’t have this ability; even a simple paper cut could be deadly.
The skin, the largest organ in our bodies, acts as a protective barrier from the outside environment. Two layers of the skin, the epidermis and dermis, contain blood vessels that transport blood throughout the body. This protective barrier is broken after an injury, exposing blood vessels and causing bleeding. 
As an instinctive attempt to stop bleeding, the body enters the first stage of the healing process, known as hemostasis. According to an article published in Alternative Medicine Review, chemicals are released by muscle tissue around the damage to constrict the damaged blood vessels, reducing the amount of blood flow to the area and limiting blood loss. 
According to WebMD, tissue that makes up the skin underneath is made up of proteins called collagen. In the event of an injury, small disk-shaped structures in the blood called platelets interact with collagen and cause the blood to coagulate or stick together, forming a scab that temporarily seals the break in the blood vessel.
As the bleeding is controlled, the body slowly enters the inflammatory phase of healing that is often associated with pain. Here, the platelets release chemicals that attract special types of white blood cells to the wound. These cells flood the wound, acting as the body’s immune system, where they engulf and destroy debris and harmful bacteria. These cells act as the first line of defense against infection, dominating the area of the wound for the first two days.
Over the next few days, the white blood cells continue to digest bacteria and dead tissue cells. Once bleeding has subsided and the wound is free from infection, it enters the rebuilding stage. Also known as the proliferative stage, this stage is when cells create new collagen and increase the strength of the wound.
White blood cells known as fibroblasts eventually mature into smooth muscle cells. As they transform into what are known as myofibroblasts, they develop characteristics of muscles, such as the ability to contract. This establishes the final stage of wound healing, where the myofibroblasts pull the wound edges together. Over time, more collagen is deposited to protect the wound from reopening, creating scar tissue. 
Although scar tissue and normal skin both contain collagen, scar tissue has a higher concentration of it, which makes it look different from the surrounding skin. Collagen in normal skin overlaps in many directions, giving a smooth appearance. In contrast, collagen in scar tissue is usually aligned in one direction, giving it a more textured look. 
Our bodies contain all the cells necessary to rebuild damaged tissue. However, these cells require various vitamins and nutrients that must come from our diet. Vitamin C is used for collagen synthesis, and vitamin A is used to develop blood vessels. Other nutrients, such as zinc, are necessary for DNA synthesis for new developing cells.
Wounds are an inescapable part of human lives, and luckily, the human body can recover from the majority of minor cuts and scrapes with very little intervention. Larger wounds often need outside medical attention to more quickly stop bleeding or further prevent infection. Still, doctors rely heavily on the body’s ability to fix itself over time.

West Nile outbreak one of the largest for this time of year
Federal health officials announced this week that the current U.S. outbreak of West Nile virus is one of the largest seen in the country. As of last Thursday, 1,118 cases were reported, over half of them in Texas. The number of reports by this time of year is typically fewer than 300. Scientists believe that the combination of a mild winter, an early spring, and a very hot summer is a contributing factor to the outbreak.
The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes, which pick the virus up from birds they bite. Only one in five infected people gets sick, and the symptoms can include headache, body aches, and fever. One in 150 people may develop severe symptoms, which can result in coma and paralysis.

After 352 million miles, NASA cheers for 23 feet
This week, NASA’s Mars rover Curiosity completed a successful test drive. The 16-minute trip consisted of moving forward 15 feet, turning 120 degrees, and backing up eight feet. After completing its 352-million-mile trip to the surface of Mars earlier this month, the team is thrilled about the recent 23-foot journey.
“It couldn’t be more important,” Peter Theisinger, the mission’s project manager, said at a news conference after the drive. “I mean, we built a rover. So unless the rover roves, we really haven’t accomplished anything.”
Curiosity is to spend a few years exploring the surface of Mars in attempt to figure out whether the planet was ever habitable for microbial life.

Scientists recognize conciousness of some animals
An international group of scientists signed The Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness, which supports the idea that animals have a similar degree of consciousness and awareness as humans. The list of animals includes all mammals, all birds, and the octopus. The scientists claim more evidence shows that humans are not unique in possessing the neurological makeup that generates consciousness.
The declaration, which was signed in the presence of physicist Stephen Hawking, states that “the field of Consciousness research is rapidly evolving. ... more data is becoming readily available, and this calls for a periodic reevaluation of previously held preconceptions in this field.”

Insect wings much stronger than previously thought
Researchers at Trinity College in Dublin have recently found that the wings of insects are not as fragile as they look. To measure insect wings’ strength, the scientists produced tiny cracks in locust wings and measured the amount of force required to make the crack grow and permeate through the wing. After examining video of the forced cracks, they found that once the crack had reached a wing vein, crack growth stopped.
Insects such as grasshoppers travel long distances with wings 10 times thinnner than a human hair. The researchers believe that the vein pattern found in insect wings could inspire the design of more durable and lightweight artificial “venous” wings for aircraft.

Doctors finding help through Facebook
Doctors at the Mayo Clinic recently used Facebook to investigate the stroke of a 56-year-old woman. The stroke happened as a result of a clogged artery in her neck, and doctors needed to determine whether the blockage was a result of trauma or of risk factors such as diabetes or heart disease.
One doctor noticed that the patient’s right eyelid was more droopy than the left, which is commonly associated with trauma. The doctors examined the patient’s Facebook profile pictures and found that the droopy eyelid symptom was a recent development, so the artery blockage was likely caused by trauma. Knowing the cause of blockage can help doctors prevent future strokes.

Apple victorious, Samsung loses patent trial
A federal grand jury in San Jose, Calif., found that Samsung had violated many of Apple’s patents. Apple was awarded $1 billion in damages. The jury found that Samsung violated utility patents as well as design patents, and found some of the comany’s infringements “willful.” The jury did not award Samsung any damages on any of its counter-claims.
The verdict “could lead to an outright ban on sales of key Samsung products and will likely solidify Apple’s dominance of the exploding mobile computing market,” Reuters reported.

Imagine yourself fresh off the bus from Pittsburgh to New York. You have a bag of clothes and a bag of puppets, props, and makeup. It’s one week before you perform in the New York International Fringe Festival, the largest multi-arts festival in North America that features around 200 shows in a two-week period.
This was the scene for a group of Carnegie Mellon School of Drama students as they took their show, Sheherizade, to New York for the festival.
“We were lucky we had a minimalist set and didn’t have too many props,” said Rodney Earl Jackson Jr., a senior musical theater major and the show’s producer, about transporting the show materials to New York.
Sheherizade began as a project for the School of the Drama’s Playground Festival last March. “We thought, ‘We need to seize the day and take this opportunity that the School of Drama and Purnell has given us and do something,’ ” said Jackson of the decision to enter in Playground. Aidaa Peerzada, a senior acting major, wrote the play and the two assembled a cast and crew of students to help put on the show.
Directed by junior directing major Priscila Garcia, Sheherizade is a fresh take on a traditional “Arabian Nights” story. The play incorporates music, storytelling, puppetry, and dance to tell three stories of women’s strength and men’s challenges.
After receiving great reviews at Playground for its originality, the group decided to enter the show into the Fringe Festival. “We decided to just enter it and see what happened,” Jackson said. “And then sure enough, we got accepted.”
Sheherizade was, in fact, one of three shows created and performed by Carnegie Mellon students in this year’s Fringe Festival. Two other groups that also presented their shows at last year’s Playground made it through the Fringe Festival’s jury selection process and became a part of this year’s festival.
Inexperienced Love, one of the other Carnegie Mellon shows at the festival, is a musical written and composed by senior drama student Jacob Tischler. The musical tells the stories of three college couples as they discover the ups and downs of love. The musical comedy was directed by senior drama student Benjamin Viertel and produced by iLove Productions.
The third group of Carnegie Mellon students to take its Playground show to the Fringe Festival performed Behind the Badge, an autobiographical story of two police officers and their sons. The play was written by senior drama student Lachlan McKinney and recent drama alum Marrick Smith, both of whom grew up with police officers as fathers. The play’s entire creative team is comprised of Carnegie Mellon students and is produced by Iron Shirt Production.
The three groups have added to a long list of Carnegie Mellon students who have performed at the festival in years past. PigPen, a group formed at Carnegie Mellon in 2008, participated in the festival in 2010 and 2011, winning the highest honor for a play both years. PigPen was the first group in the festival’s history to win two years in a row. Additionally, a Carnegie Mellon group called In The Basement Theater also attended in 2011, performing a piece called Chien de Moi.
Despite the number of students who complete the journey from Playground to Fringe, it’s not an easy ride. Taking into account travel expenses, rehearsal space, props, backdrops, advertising, and time commitments, preparing for the festival can take its toll financially and physically.
That’s why the Sheherizade group decided to hire a team to help take some of the load off. To pay for everything, they created a Kickstarter page and raised $4,610 — $1,110 more than their goal. To prepare for their show, they rehearsed between six and eight hours every day for a week.
“It was really tiring,” Jackson said, “but absolutely worth it. I learned a lot about being a producer in the process.”
The main thing Jackson learned, he said, was that if you want things to be done, you have to do them yourself. This was certainly the case for advertising the group’s four shows. Unlike campus performances, a full house is not guaranteed in New York, and especially not in the Fringe Festival.
“It’s a lot different because at school, you don’t have to worry about filling the house. The people who usually come, do come,” Jackson explained. “But in New York, there were 190-something shows in the festival, so it was all on you if you wanted people to come see your show. You had to go get them.”
In the end, Jackson and the rest of his team’s efforts paid off, as they performed to a large crowd and received positive reviews in the media.
Like Playground, the Fringe Festival allows students complete creative freedom. While Jackson enjoys the classical structure of school, “sometimes you want to do what you want to do, and [Playground and Fringe] really open that door for opportunity, which is phenomenal.”
“Fringe is like Playground on an escalated scale,” Jackson said. “It’s like, here’s the space, here’s the press, now you go and do everything.”

The Pittsburgh Center for the Arts is teeming with bright creations and new ideas. Charlee Brodsky and Vanessa German — who earlier this month were named 2012 Artist of the Year and Emerging Artist of the Year, respectively — are currently displaying the unique and intricate creations that earned them their titles.
German’s work, titled 21st Century JuJu: New Magic, Soul Gadgets and Reckoning, explores the concept of souls. Her statement reads, “I am thinking about the technology of the Soul; how I might go into the inside of the inside of the inside, what I got to do to git there, and how I attend to what I find [sic].”
Rooms feature statues of dark-skinned women, doll-like and eerie. Each figure possesses a presence and soul. Their attire is pieced together from an eclectic mix of odds and ends: Keys, light bulbs, animal statues, birds, mirrors, and pieces of Americana adorn the figures.
German’s work exhibits a strong commentary on the American experience, largely focusing on African-American and black folk art. In one room, a large ring of 14 statues adorned in American paraphernalia stare out past viewers. The first figure visible from the doorway sits atop a table labeled “America,” with rusty nails jammed into its torso and holding an American flag handkerchief.
German investigates the pain and presence of American culture in her work, and succeeds in displaying a powerful range of emotions through her figures. The body of work was created with the intention of showing only what German loves to create. According to her statement, she asked herself the question, “What comes from my most innate, original places?” and worked forward from that point.
German is a self-taught artist who currently lives and works in Homewood. Her process involves a collection of old kitchen materials, domestic items, old tools, and objects that people use in everyday life.
Brodsky’s work, featured on the second floor of the art center, displays a more subtle approach to creation. Her work appears in book form, pairing photographs of her dog, Max, with the words of famous poets, artists, and authors. She displays seven handmade books featuring Max with the words of William Shakespeare, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Mary Shelley, Samuel Beckett, and John Muir.
The pictures and text mix in a pleasant, slightly humorous nature. Max, a small West Highland white terrier, is considered the “actor,” taking on different roles in each of Brodsky’s photo books. In one of the books, where the photos are paired with passages from Shelley’s Frankenstein, Max plays the role of a monster. In another of Brodsky’s photo books, called Dual Tracks, he is featured as an urban escapist, paired with lines from Muir.
The large prints of Max paralleled with the philosophical writings that Brodsky chooses gives the little white dog an oddly human quality to him. What appear to be his heart-wrenching thoughts on life and his surroundings document him as an unspoken philosopher. For example, a print from one of Brodsky’s other photo books, called The Artist, matches a forlorn picture of the small dog in a deserted alley with painter Mark Rothko’s musing, “Silence is so accurate.”
Brodsky’s statement on her exhibit, titled Good Dog, begins with “I didn’t start out as a dog photographer.” This particular exhibit is her first presentation of Max as her subject. A professor of photography in Carnegie Mellon’s School of Design, she pairs her photographs with famous writers “to get at the human condition,” she explains in the statement. “There is seriousness at its core, but there’s a lot of humor, too.” Brodsky’s past work has similarly focused on combinations of photographs and words, though largely in collaboration with other authors.

A compelling new documentary film is headed for the Steel City. Married in Spandex — the entertaining story of a young lesbian couple’s quest for marriage — was produced and directed by two Pittsburgh natives, Allison Kole and Devin Gallagher. The upcoming Pittsburgh screening is shaping up to be an exciting one.
Married in Spandex is a 55-minute documentary recording the marriage of Amanda and Rachel, who are determined to make their wedding a memorable one. Although the couple’s home is in Philadelphia, they travel to Iowa in order to receive a marriage license. The journey is made more interesting by their choice of wedding ceremony: They are married by rapper and performance artist Leslie Hall while wearing spandex, as vaguely hinted at in the title. The entire ceremony is laden with unique perspectives and is almost unrecognizable as a wedding.
The documentary started out as a series of interviews that would be given to the couple as a wedding gift. Gallagher explained, “We initially thought about using the interviews as a wedding present, but the event kept growing and growing so we decided to invest in something bigger.”
“It all happened really organically,” said Kole, who is Amanda’s sister and was a maid of honor in the wedding. “[Amanda and Rachel] thought it was a great idea and that it would be fun. People relate to them and they wanted to show how everyone can be creative with their own wedding.... They trusted us and they enjoyed talking about what they were about to do.”
Although there are some flat moments, this fast-paced film is quite entertaining. The interviews with friends and family scattered throughout provide a variety of perspectives on the women’s relationship and marriage. They also highlighted the difficult decisions Amanda and Rachel were faced with during this time, as the two women chose their love despite the difficulties and opposition that came with it. Although Rachel’s parents did not accept her lifestyle, she refused to give up on the person she loved; for her, it is most important to love in spite of everything the world does to change her.
Aside from the extraordinary wedding, many interesting political issues are brought to light in the film. Specifically, the viewer is reminded of the fact that marriage equality is something unheard of in certain states; this is the reason the girls travel to Iowa. The time and effort they put into receiving a marriage license that is not even valid in their home state is a truly remarkable testament to their love for each other.
“It’s a really personal story that can open up dialogue more than a dry political story can,” Kole said. “The film isn’t necessarily that focused on marriage equality, but it is a benefit to the movement and encourages people to openly talk about it.”
From the beginning, Gallagher said, “We wanted to tell the story of two women doing something unique.” And the two filmmakers did just that. Married in Spandex is a touching and entertaining story, and anyone with an appreciation for originality, fun, love, and spandex will certainly enjoy this documentary.
Married in Spandex will be screened on Sept. 7 at the Hollywood Theater (1449 Potomac Ave.).

“It was now or never.”
Lauren Goshinski, co-founder and creator of the Pittsburgh-based electronic music collective VIA, explained that the decision to open a new venue — 6119, named for its location at 6119 Penn Ave. — came down to “a gut instinct.”
VIA opened the new venue in July, with its first public show featuring French hip-hop beat maker and electronic musician Onra. The venue has been host to a number of electronic shows since its opening, and at present VIA’s decision to open its own venue seems to have paid off. Attendance is high, and community members are responding well to the change. “Every single [event] has been packed,” Goshinski said.
Before discovering the space at 6119, “the concept had been in our minds for a long time,” Goshinski said. When she and her colleagues came across an abandoned club on the market in East Liberty, the opportunity was too good to pass up.
6119 is a unique blend of club and gallery, and the venue will allow VIA — which focuses on the combination of electronic music and new media visuals — to build a community-centered space. It has the capacity to incorporate more space-consuming events and installations. “It offers a home base for us to do more educational and art-based programming,” Goshinski said. “This kind of space is what people want.”
In addition to bringing in notable electronic musicians throughout the year, 6119 will be one of the central stages during this year’s VIA Music and New Media Festival in October, which has primarily been held on nearby Broad Street in the past. This October marks the third year of the annual festival, the lineup for which will be announced next week.
Given the attention VIA has garnered in its few years of existence and the exciting possibilities that the new 6119 location brings, the organization’s prospects seem bright. As VIA continues to expand, Goshinski encourages members of the Carnegie Mellon community to partake in the new VIA scene. “We can host a variety of events and we’re very open to having people contact us,” she said.
VIA’s annual festival, and now the 6119 venue, are a vital part of the growing nightlife and club scene in East Liberty. With other nearby venues like AVA and Shadow Lounge also bringing in notable acts, East Liberty is quickly becoming a center for electronic music in Pittsburgh.
6119’s busy schedule of shows continues this Friday with a performance by ambient techno DJ Kassem Mosse. Its full schedule can be found on the 6119 Facebook page.

Comedian Charlyne Yi made a visit to Carnegie Mellon Friday night as part of the slew of activities planned for first-years during this year’s Orientation week. Yi, whose performances focus on music, games, and audience participation, is known for her performance in her screenwriting debut Paper Heart and her role as Dr. Chi in the medical drama House.
Despite her list of impressive achievements, Yi’s show was fairly disappointing. Her stage presence was constantly lacking, and she relied heavily on multimedia clips and a notecard in her pocket. The clips she played ranged from boring to inappropriate, and her final clip was offensive enough to send audience members out of Rangos Hall at record speed.
Some of the best laughs in Yi’s show came from her special guest, John the Psychic. John played well into the Carnegie Mellon dynamic and spent most of his short time in front of the audience asking questions and making sexually crude comments. Near the end of his segment, he went around Rangos pointing at various students, saying, “You’re a virgin ... and you’re a virgin ... and you’re a virgin,” until one student cheered in agreement.
Although both John the Psychic and Yi used crude humor for laughs, John seemed to be more in tune with the audience and was more entertaining.
Yi seemed to have a tough time capturing the undivided attention of the room because of her timid behavior, incessant use of the word “um,” and unclear plan for the show. Initially the audience responded to Yi’s act with appropriate laughter, but as the show continued, the audience seemed to grow bored of her routine.
After sharing her birthing video, one audience member shouted, “What the f***?” and Yi’s response was to laugh and exclaim, “Now you know where babies come from!” In the same vein, the students were the saving graces of Yi’s show, with their wit and occasional well-placed comments emerging from the otherwise silent crowd.
Toward the start of the show, Yi claimed her boyfriend had dumped her, so she was left looking for somewhere to stay, to which a male student shouted, “Hamerschlag!” This instigated cheers from the audience, even though the joke was completely lost on Yi.
After the show was over, AB Comedy Chair and senior economics major Bryan Wade commented on the possibility of students finding the show offensive, saying, “possibly, but it’s college.” Wade defended AB Comedy’s choice of comedians. “She has a kind of unique style appropriate for Carnegie Mellon,” he said.
Backstage after the show, Yi kept repeating, “I scarred everyone,” and, “I feel bad that people left.” When asked if most audiences respond to her birthing clip in a similar manner, Yi explained that reactions to the clip are very mixed, and that in Los Angeles she usually follows up the clip with a piece on the harp to help the audience mellow back out, but here in Pittsburgh, she had no such harp.
While not a complete disappointment, Yi’s show was difficult to connect with and seemed unorganized. Many individuals found her offbeat humor entertaining, but the audience as a whole seemed unimpressed with her performance.
Editor’s note: Bryan Wade is a staffwriter for The Tartan.

Kieran Hebden, better known as Four Tet, is possibly one of the most exciting people currently making electronic music. Taking ideas from a vast array of musical styles such as free jazz, UK garage, house, and hip hop, Hebden molds compositions that feel organic, warm, and inviting, instead of throwing together a grab bag of mismatched styles and samples.
Listening to any of Hebden’s work makes it hard to overlook his origins as a member of the post-rock band Fridge. While his output as Four Tet would never be considered post-rock, it is perhaps the purest manifestation of the genre’s ideals: lush musical landscapes tethered by innovative uses of acoustic instruments and samples of nature that are emotionally striking and aurally stimulating. Four Tet is, in many ways, more post-rock than most post-rock bands.
It is this entrenchment in organic production and lushness that makes Hebden’s new album, Pink, so difficult to digest. Upon first listen, it is hard to believe that the same producer who released the gorgeous and divine-sounding There is Love in You two-and-a-half years ago could release the more cool, mechanistic, and club-oriented songs that appear on Pink. Only “128 Harps” and “Locked” are representations of the Four Tet sound prevalent on previous albums.
While there is a lot going on in “128 Harps” — drums, a wordless vocal sample, and harps mesh over the shimmering of a tambourine army — the song is surprisingly relaxed. While “Locked” sounds nothing at all like “128 Harps,” it also manages to sound very Four Tet; the disjointed drumbeat lopes on endlessly before synths gradually enter, culminating in a catchy, repetitious riff. The surprising inclusion of dubstep-influenced bass wobble, however, is what really sets the song’s momentum and signals its true nature, looping disparate instruments and styles against each other to form a harmonious amalgam.
The previously unreleased “Lion” also bears a surprising resemblance to Four Tet’s older material. The song starts off dominated by a stereotypical “uhn-tiss” dance beat with odd, almost yelping samples, and ends carried by a catchy thumb harp loop and synths.
This is not to say that all of the other songs are bad. “Pyramid” is essentially a more club-friendly “Angel Echoes,” with its looping vocal samples. “Jupiter” begins with moody and cold synths before launching into an upbeat drum loop anchored with grimey bass, climaxing with a simple but incredibly engaging vocal sample.
The only real dud on Pink is “Peace for Earth,” which is a failure both as a song and as a component of the album. Not only does the ambient soundscape chafe uncomfortably with the other songs, but it is also cheesy, predictable, and stumbles over the line between atmospheric and boring.
Pink isn’t really an album as much as it is a collection of singles; only “Peace for Earth” and “Lion” were not previously released. This isn’t a release targeted at diehard fans, who probably own all of the previously released singles already, or toward new fans, who will not find much that represents Four Tet’s back catalogue. Instead, Pink is for the casual fan or the lazy diehard.
[ITAL]Pink[ITAL] was released by Text Records on August 20.

It has been a busy summer at the movies. Batman faced Bane, there was never only one Bourne, and somebody thought it was a good idea to remake Total Recall without Arnold Schwarzenegger’s trademark bravado. While Hollywood was busy raking in boatloads of cash, the last few months have delivered a few exciting titles that will likely show up during Oscar season. Moonrise Kingdom, Bernie, and ParaNorman are three summer films that are worth seeing and still playing at theaters in Pittsburgh.
Moonrise Kingdom
The latest project from cinema’s arch-hipster Wes Anderson (The Royal Tenenbaums and The Life Aquatic), Moonrise Kingdom sees his unmistakable stylistic panache reach a new level. Moonrise attempts to understand the possibility of love between two adolescents, Sam and Suzy, who live on the fictional island of New Penzance.
The two run away from their families to establish a place for themselves — a place for love — disconnected from the mundane responsibilities of imminent adulthood. The film revels in the twilight of awkward, deadpan delivery, reaching for gravity and naiveté simultaneously. For the first time, Anderson reveals a preoccupation with spirituality, most evident in a collection of references, both visual and textual, to Noah and the Biblical flood. The soundtrack features music by Benjamin Britten and Hank Williams, coexisting harmoniously on Anderson’s island. Moonrise Kingdom is a hip fable that may be the best film of the first half of the year.
Bernie
In another film worth seeing, director Richard Linklater (School of Rock and Dazed and Confused) teamed up with Jack Black for a second time in Bernie. Black portrays a hyper-genial, flamboyant funeral director who befriends and murders a bitter widow. Linklater’s relaxed charm is noticeable throughout the film, lending lightness to some otherwise heavy subject matter.
His most impressive feat, however, is his use of mock interviews to twist the East Texas community into a Greek chorus. With so much surface nonchalance, it’s startling to see how much intimate psychology Linklater is able to draw from these townspeople. In addition, Black compensates for the numerous, near-unforgivable tragedies of his career (Nacho Libre and Gulliver’s Travels) with this deeply expressive investigation of emotional artifice.
ParaNorman
As Pixar dives into a series of sequels that suggest the end of a spellbinding dynasty, other animators are being afforded the opportunity to step up during this new era of digital animation. We were given the supreme Rango last year and this summer, from the creators of Coraline, we were presented with the stop-motion virtuosity of ParaNorman. The movie deals with a cast-out kid who is able to communicate with the dead. It’s a familiar story, but it delivers an extraordinary result. ParaNorman harbors astonishing force in both narrative substance and world building. Everything from the digital effects to the painstaking stop-motion precision is strong.
These three titles barely scratch the surface. If you’re trying to catch some other great summer films while you still have free time, be on the lookout for Beasts of the Southern Wild, Red Hook Summer, Killer Joe, and Magic Mike — all outstanding efforts.

Dear Patrick,
I went out on a couple of dates with this girl right before school ended for the summer, and I thought we hit it off pretty well. But over the course of the summer we drifted apart. What’s the best way to remind her that I’m totally awesome and she’s really missing out?
Thanks,
Semester Upon Me, Must Engage Romantic Lady Attention Conundrum, Knowing Input Needed
Dear SUMMER LACKIN,
First of all, it’s good that you know that you’re a total stud. I mean, c’mon, look at you! You must drive the ladies wild. So, naturally, you probably drove this lady wild. Now’s the time to put that confidence to good use.
There are two approaches you can take: Make the first move and call her up to hang out, or wait until you bump into her. The former move demonstrates total confidence, but if she’s forgotten how dashing you are, she might think you’re coming on too strong. I’d recommend the latter. It lets you scope out how she feels while you lay on the charm. Either way, you’ll have to step up your wooing game. It’s hard enough getting a woman once, let alone twice.
Or just cut your losses and let the rest of womankind have a shot with you,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
I just finished my summer internship, and they gave me a job offer! I’m really excited about it, but none of my friends have gotten job offers yet. What’s the best way to gloat about it?
Thanks,
Highly Inconspicuously Revealing Employment Despite Friends’ Irritating Results, Totally Showboating
Dear HIRED FIRST,
Congratulations! As the first to be employed among your friends, you get the grand honor of getting to buy the first round of beers at the bar! Every time. Get used to hearing, “Hey man, you have a job, but I’m still unemployed. You’re flush! Help a brother out.” If you don’t, you’re cheap.
But don’t worry — I’m here to help. First, never mention any hiring or signing bonus. Don’t bring up the job in casual conversation — that just reminds them you have money to spare. Instead, just casually mention how bad the job market is with a knowing smirk. Offer to help your friends with their résumés in a condescending tone, or accept buying a round as the price for your gloating.
Or cheer them up by reminding them that at least they’re not in CFA and permanently unemployed,
Patrick Hoskins

Enjoying a new type of music is similar to learning a new language. Developing a functional knowledge and understanding a few key phrases isn’t that difficult, but attaining fluency requires research, practice, and more time than one first imagines. The key to both, however, is immersion. Surrounding yourself with people who are already familiar with the culture is the most efficient way to learn about any musical style.
You can try doing research on your own by reading Pitchfork or Drowned in Sound, surfing Wikipedia’s “list of X-genre artists,” and downloading a bunch of albums that you’ve heard belong in a certain genre, but this is no different from learning a language solely through how-to books and instructional podcasts. In other words, by learning this way, you lose the human aspect — the social nuances that elevate communication beyond simple information transmission into a form of spiritual connection and understanding.
There is another key similarity between learning a new language and broadening your musical taste: There is a critical period of acquisition, and once you pass that period, fluency is much harder to acquire. According to Daniel Levitin, associate professor of psychology at McGill University, it is our music taste during our teenage years that most heavily influence our listening preferences as adults. While that critical period has already passed for most of us, there is still time to listen and learn.
Carnegie Mellon is one of the most diverse universities in the country. Our music program is world renowned, our radio station is one of the final bastions in freeform radio culture, and Pittsburgh is a musical hotspot for most any type of style. So, why are you still reading this? Go find something new to listen to and expand your mind.

[BOLD]50 years ago: Sept. 19, 1962[BOLD]
An editorial discusses the importance of Freshman Camp (i.e. Orientation) and of keeping alive the “new outlook” and “enthusiasm” that first-years bring to campus. The article suggests that the camp be a graduation requirement. This editorial makes you wonder how long the student body has been apathetic in terms of school spirit.

A snarky feature recounts the “spectacles” witnessed during registration for the fall semester. In addition to the usual long lines, the administration added a “Popular Music Video” twist to the annual ordeal. Students received add/drop slips while songs like Janet Jackson’s “Nasty Girl” played in the background.

[BOLD]Lethal Weapon[BOLD]
8 10 12
Watch Danny Glover and Mel Gibson enforce some serious law in one of the most revered and plagiarized “buddy cop” films of all time. The well-known film critic Roger Ebert gave four stars to this winding tale about two members of the LAPD homicide crew grappling with a drug and prostitution ring. The 1987 film was directed by Richard Donner and written by Shane Black — straight out of college.
[BOLD]21 Jump Street[BOLD]
8 10 12
Enjoy the bumbling, ironic comedy of Jonah Hill? Don’t miss 21 Jump Street, which was his writing debut and perhaps his most well-received effort. Channing Tatum, who has had a marvelous breakout year, joins Hill in a riotous spin on 1980’s “buddy cop” movies like Thursday’s Lethal Weapon. Watch out for a few memorable cameos.
[BOLD]Attack the Block[BOLD]
8 10 12
Joe Cornish directs this undervalued 2011 release in a surprisingly cogent debut. A band of South London rogues attempt to defend their territory from an aBoyega turns in a particularly solid performance in this well-characterized sci-fi effort. Fans of 2009’s District 9 will likely be just as excited about this one.
[BOLD]Summer Wars[BOLD]
8 10 12
Mamoru Hosoda directs this mind-boggling sci-fi epic about a young math genius who goes up against some hostile artificial intelligence. Summer Wars came out in 2009, and has received numerous accolades, most notably the Japan Academy Prize for Animation and the Golden Leopard at the Locarno Film Festival. This film presentation is co-sponsored by the Vermillion Club.

Students looking to study on the first floor of Hunt Library this semester may run into trouble. The area is being renovated to make space for a tutoring station, among other additions.
“I’m very excited,” said Gloriana St. Clair, dean of University Libraries. “These [renovations] are some things that we’ve been wanting to get done for students for quite a long time.”
In addition to the tutoring station, formally known as the Global Communications Center (GCC), St. Clair said that the renovations will include a consultation room, a meeting room, more tables and chairs by the back windows, and an interactive lounge with a flat screen TV.
According to St. Clair, all of the renovations were requested or proposed by the Student Advisory Board, with which Hunt Library staff has been consulting over the past year.
The renovations are being made with next year’s Middle State Accreditation Agency (MSAA) visit in mind. The MSAA is an independent agency that offers accreditation, or credibility, to institutions of higher education. 
Outside of the U.S., university accreditation is usually performed by a government organization. In the U.S., it is done by private membership associations. According to St. Clair, the MSAA “peer reviews” universities every five years or sooner depending on how they score and improve.
In its last visit to Carnegie Mellon, St. Clair said the MSAA suggested that the university focus on “student learning outcomes.”
“When we were reviewed by the Middle States Accrediting Agency, they gave us a very positive review, but they did make a suggestion to us that it would be nice if we were able to tackle this problem,” St. Clair said.
The GCC is one of the ways the university hopes to satisfy the MSAA’s suggestion.
Joanna Wolfe, director of the GCC, said the center will start off with 11 tutors — all master’s students — with more tutors to be added later. Tutors are currently undergoing training, to be completed within the next three to four weeks.
Although Hunt Library’s first floor will probably be undergoing renovations for most of the fall, the GCC will begin tutoring students sooner. 
“We’re going to be opening in three weeks in a temporary space in FMS,” Wolfe said. “It’s going to be hard to find, but we will have instructions on our website, which is not up yet. So we will be ready in three weeks to accept appointments on a limited basis, but in four weeks we’ll be full-time, full-staff.”
According to Wolfe, students should try to bring to their tutoring appointment a copy of the assignment they need help with, a model essay from that class, or anything they’ve worked out thus far, as all these will help the tutors to best mentor the student. 
Students will be able to schedule a tutoring session through the GCC website after it launches.
While the renovations are being made with students in mind, the resulting noise is a slight disturbance to people studying on the first floor.
“It’s a little bit noisy since it’s right there, but very clean,” said Meng Zhang, a master’s student in urban design.
“Of course there is concern about the fact that it’s disruption and there’s noise,” St. Clair said. “I don’t think there are any big concerns about the end result. I think everyone in the library is very happy that we’re able to bring the Global Communications Center in.... What I hear from students is that they want more comfortable spaces and more aesthetic spaces, and I think that in both cases we’ll be able to meet their needs.”

The Port Authority announced last Tuesday that the service reduction planned for Sept. 2 would be postponed until at least August 2013.
The postponement is the result of a deal reached by the Port Authority, Allegheny County, Governor Tom Corbett’s office, and the Local 85 Amalgamated Transit Union. Under the deal, Port Authority employees in the Local 85 union will undergo a two-year pay freeze and increase the percentage of the paychecks paid into their pension plans; the state will provide $35 million to Port Authority during the coming year; and Allegheny County will provide $4.5 million over the coming year.
The turning point in negotiations, which have been ongoing for several months, was the ratification of a new contract between the Port Authority and the Local 85, to which the majority of the Port Authority’s employees belong.
“Once the contract was ratified, we knew that we would be seeing some pretty substantial savings from that contract,” Port Authority spokesperson Heather Pharo said. “As we have been in discussions with the state and the county as well, the board opted to postpone the cuts for at least one year ... in order to give the state and the county more time to figure out a sustainable plan for funding transportation.”
Local 85 President Stephen Palonis said that although the union is not entirely happy with the new contract, something had to be done in order to save local transportation.
“It’s a concessionary contract, that’s for sure,” Palonis said. “Our membership says we have to do our part for transportation in Allegheny County. They have faith in us.”
Palonis said that there are some caveats in the new contract. “If the governor doesn’t come through with a dedicated source of funding that can grow, we revert back to our previous contract. Our membership ratified it by a 10-to-one margin, and the reason they ratified it by that margin was because of that language.”
Palonis pointed to Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald as another pivotal player in the agreement.
“He really kept our nose to the grindstone throughout this process,” Palonis said. “Rich is an advocate for transportation. I’ve dealt with a lot of politicians through this process, but Rich really wants to see transportation grow.”
According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Fitzgerald is advocating paying the county’s portion of the agreement using two sources: the county’s drink tax and the Allegheny Regional Asset District (RAD). The RAD draws its revenue from a 1 percent addition to Pennsylvania’s 6 percent sales tax.
Carnegie Mellon Student Body President Will Weiner,  a senior economics and statistics and decision science double major who lobbied for local transportation in his previous role as chair of the Undergraduate Student Senate, is happy about the deal.
“The benefits are pretty obvious, especially for our graduate student population,” Weiner said. “I’m really glad the deal was worked out, because they utilize a lot of the routes that were going to be cut.”
Since one of Corbett’s major demands was union concessions, Weiner said the new union contract gives transportation lobbyists more bargaining power in the future. “I think it gives our side some more ammunition to say, ‘Look, they’ve made some concessions,’ ” Weiner said. “So it gives us a better position to secure a better future not just for Pittsburgh, but for the state.”
Weiner said that student government’s future lobbying efforts, whatever they are, will probably be made through the Pittsburgh Student Government Council.
“It could manifest itself a lot of ways. I want to use our resources and connections with local government before figuring out what the next step is,” he said.

The FBI officially indicted Adam Stuart Busby on Aug. 22 for sending over 40 threatening emails to the University of Pittsburgh last year. Busby’s emails were part of a series of over 100 bomb threats issued to Pitt throughout the spring semester. Busby, the founder of the Scottish National Liberation Army, is currently in an Irish prison awaiting an extradition hearing for threats he allegedly made about airliners travelling between London and New York City.
According to a statement on the FBI’s website, Busby is indicted on 35 counts: 17 counts of wire fraud, 16 counts of maliciously conveying false information in the form of bomb threats, and two counts of international extortion.
In addition to the Pitt bomb threats, Busby has been charged with sending emails in 2010 threatening to poison water supplies in England, and specifically Gordon Brown, who was prime minister of the United Kingdom at the time. The 64-year-old Scottish nationalist is known mainly for his hoaxes; while the Scottish National Liberation Army has carried out or attempted more overt acts of terrorism in the past, Busby suffers from multiple sclerosis and is bound to a wheelchair.
“I was not in the least bit surprised [by the charges],” David Leslie, a retired Scottish reporter who personally knows Busby, said in a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette article. “His motive is publicity. Busby glories in publicity. He will target anyone or any organization that he feels will gain him publicity.”
Busby’s motive is unclear. The FBI declined to speculate about his reasoning, and Busby has no direct connection to either the university or the city. In his interview, Leslie told the Post-Gazette that it was likely not a deeply thought-out action, and was possibly inspired by the presence of a UPMC hospital in Dublin.
While the threats Busby has been charged with were some of the most prominent of those made against Pitt, nobody has been charged for the other threats, including the initial ones written inside bathrooms on campus. Pitt rescinded its offer of a $50,000 reward for information after a group calling itself the “Threateners,” now identified as Busby, claimed responsibility for some of the threats and demanded that the reward be removed.
Extradition from Ireland is historically hard to accomplish, and authorities in both the U.S. and the U.K. seem to view Busby as a nuisance more than anything, according to Leslie’s interview with the Post-Gazette. The FBI did not make any statements regarding extradition. Leslie believes that the U.S. will likely not push hard for Busby’s extradition.
In his official statement, Pitt Chancellor Mark Nordenberg thanked local and federal law enforcement as well as the Pitt community for their support during the bomb threat fiasco. He cited examples of people who went out of their way to help, including a canine officer from McKeesport who made late-night trips on his own time to perform bomb sweeps, and faculty members who patrolled doorways and conducted classes on campus lawns.
“Everyone in the University of Pittsburgh community is deeply grateful for the many forms of help that were extended to us while our campus was under siege and for all of the hard work that was done,” Nordenberg said in the statement.
Although Busby’s indictment has provided some answers, many students remain puzzled.
Carnegie Mellon sophomore computer science major Eric Lee said, “Considering that no bombs were actually detonated at the school, it seems almost fitting that the threats were as random as they were pointless.”
Some, like Pitt first-year engineering major Erin Sarosi, are just happy to see progress. Sarosi applied to Pitt while the threats were occurring. “It wasn’t hindering me from going here,” Sarosi said. “I think it’s still a pretty safe campus.”

Carnegie Mellon issued an update to the preferred name guidelines for students this fall.
The changes were announced in an email sent by Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno last Monday. According to the email, student-specified preferred names have been used in all Blackboard courses since the summer semester. The message said that preferred names have now also been added to Health Services records, course photo rosters, and residential rosters.
Records for University Health Services, Counseling and Psychological Services, and housefellows and residential administrative staff will now contain students’ preferred names as well as their legal ones. Photo rosters will contain students’ preferred names instead of their legal ones.
Any student who wants to set a preferred name needs to log in to Student Information Online (SIO) and select the preferred first name option under “View and Update My Info.”
In order to avoid any technical issues implementing the name policy, Casalegno said that working groups spent a large amount of time coding in order to “build the right infrastructure, which is part of what took us so long” in rolling out the new preferred name policy.
Junior global studies and Chinese studies double major Colin Meret, the president of ALLIES, an LBGTQ group on campus, said that preferred names are often of particular concern to transgender students.
“Definitely it’s a step in the right direction,” Meret said of the new guidelines. “Obviously, transgender students face many challenges in college.”
Meret recalled the steps his predecessors took to encourage these changes, saying, “ALLIES was one of the organizations helping push this policy.”
Casalegno said that ALLIES brought forth the initial proposal for preferred name guidelines several years ago. After becoming dean of Student Affairs, Casalegno took up the issue. She said she worked for two years to develop the policy.
Meg Evans, ALLIES’ coordinator of LGBTQ resources and the Stever House housefellow, was involved in the working groups that led to the changes. 
She spoke of the residential benefits of this new policy, such as RAs receiving a student’s preferred name for door decorations and other purposes before the student even arrives.
Evans also emphasized the role of awareness and education in achieving greater tolerance and understanding of the transgender community. “It’s a step,” Evans said. “But it won’t change the hearts and minds of people.”
In addition to the LBGTQ community, these changes in policy may also be pertinent to international students, who often go by a name that is not their legal name, or students who for other reasons prefer to be addressed by an alternate name.
The changes to the preferred name guidelines have been welcomed by many students.
“I feel a preferred name policy is great because it allows students to feel most comfortable on campus, even in an academic setting,” said Angelique Rein, a sophomore business and Japanese double major. “It addresses an issue that doesn’t even cross most people’s minds. It’s a step towards greater acceptance and freedom of identity for all students.”
Junior information systems and human-computer interaction major Shreepal Shah was in favor of the changes. 
Shah, a TA for 73–100 Principles of Economics, said, “I could only imagine it helping, primarily because it avoids discrepancies between how you would interact with a student in class and keeping track of their grades on an official roster. The more consistency, the better.”

HCII student named to MIT list of young innovators
Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Technology Review has named human-computer interaction Ph.D. student Chris Harrison to its TR35 list of this year’s top 35 innovators under 35.
Harrison’s work involves finding new ways for people to control computers. His work looks at methods of control outside the traditional mouse and keyboard.
“Chris has a vision of how interfaces to computing power need to change as our computing environment changes, and the technical skills for making his ideas work in the real world,” said Human-Computer Interaction Institute Director Justine Cassell in a university press release. “I can’t think of a better addition to the TR35 pantheon.”
During his time at Carnegie Mellon, Harrison has worked on and engineered many projects in his area of interest, including Minput, which turns mobile devices into computer mice, and OmniTouch, a system that turns almost any surface into a touchscreen.
Harrison was also the recipient of a Google Ph.D. fellowship earlier this year, and, together with human-computer interaction Ph.D. student Robert Xiao, received the Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship on behalf of Carnegie Mellon University.
CMU Philharmonic to play original suite for centennial
The Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic will debut an original work on Sept. 16. The work, Centennial Suite, was jointly written by music composition professors Leonardo Balada, Nancy Galbraith, Marilyn Taft Thomas, and Reza Vali in honor of the School of Music’s 100th anniversary.
“On the occasion of its centennial it’s certainly appropriate to look back over the rich history of the CMU School of Music, but so is a look forward,” said Denis Colwell, head of the School of Music, in a university press release. “I thought one way of celebrating where we have arrived and, more important, where we are going, is to cause new music to be created.”
Each movement of the suite was written by a different professor. The first, “Celebration,” was composed by Thomas; the second, “Memories No. 1, Barcelona 1938,” was composed by Balada; the third, “Euphonic Blues,” was composed by Galbraith; and the final movement, “The Darkness of Fury,” was composed by Vali.
The concert will be held at 7:30 p.m. in Carnegie Music Hall. General admission tickets for the concert are $5.

As students begin to trickle back to campus, they may notice the presence of El Gallo de Oro, the new and improved version of Sí Señor.
Kim Abel, the director of Carnegie Mellon Housing and Dining, said to The Tartan last week that El Gallo de Oro will have a very different menu from Sí Señor, and that this is a response to changes desired by the student body.
But, as reported, the new Tex-Mex eatery will have the same vendor and owner, as well as eerily similar food items, such as burritos, quesadillas, and the somewhat out-of-place brownies.
Implementing a new menu in order to have a greater appeal to the students, faculty, and visitors could have been seen as a notable accomplishment — it’s something that every eatery on campus should strive for.
But to say that drastic changes have been made to the restaurant from its unhealthy origins is ridiculous. See for yourselves — El Gallo de Oro has not changed its vendor, its style of food, or its basic menu. It’s the same old Sí Señor, poorly hidden by the new image of El Gallo de Oro.
The low calorie options that are touted by El Gallo de Oro aren’t doing enough to convince students that they’re truly healthy choices. The burrito bowl merely lists what ingredients comprise its 565 calories. Seeing more vegetarian options or additional green snacks besides fresh fruit would possibly help the former Sí Señor’s reputation of being one of the least healthy restaurants on campus.
Hiding behind a different name seems questionable and, frankly, unappetizing. Moreover, if Housing and Dining wanted a healthier Tex-Mex option, why is the classic Sí Señor brownie still offered as a dessert? Why are half of Sí Señor’s menu items still there under different names?
It may be hard to balance the traditional Tex-Mex of Sí Señor and the health craze that many restaurants cater to nowadays. Yet trying to play off both isn’t the solution. Ultimately, a poor combination can leave a bad taste in your mouth.

You've probably already heard about U.S. Representative Todd Akin's now-infamous statement made last week: "From what I understand from doctors, [pregnancy from rape] is really rare," Akin told KTVI Fox News. "If it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down."
The criticism immediately rolled in — President Obama held a press conference the following day in which he criticized Akin, saying, "the idea that we should be parsing and qualifying and slicing what types of rape we are talking about doesn't make sense to the American people and certainly doesn't make sense to me."
But Democrats weren't the only one condemning Akin: Republican politicians were quick to distance themselves from him, and both the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee and the conservative Super PAC American Crossroads have announced that they will no longer fund his campaign. Even vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan called Akin and asked him to drop out of Missouri's Senate race, according to Akin.
One might consider it a good thing that the GOP is trying to distance itself from Akin — after all, that's a sign that most Republican politicians disagree with his statements and are a little more reasonable and educated, right?
But when you look at the facts, it becomes pretty clear that Akin isn't an anomaly of the Republican party.
First is his completely misguided belief that the female body can apparently detect rape and prevent itself from becoming pregnant. Obviously, this is ludicrous — in fact, a 2003 study using data from the United States National Violence Against Women survey found that the rate at which women become pregnant from rape is twice the rate of pregnancy from consensual sexual acts.
Akin released an apology video a few days after his initial statement in which he admitted that pregnancy can occur from rape. But despite his correction, his statement revealed his apparent ignorance on how the female reproductive system works, a reoccurring theme with several conservatives.
After law student Sandra Fluke read a statement in May about the costs of birth control. Rush Limbaugh went on a now-infamous rant against her, calling her a "slut" and saying, "She wants to be paid to have sex. She's having so much sex she can't afford the contraception." Offensiveness aside, his statement revealed that he apparently doesn't understand how birth control works; the amount of birth control pills a woman takes is completely independent of the amount of sex that she has.
Similarly, many conservatives, including Akin, Mitt Romney, and Newt Gingrich, have spoken out against the morning-after pill, a form of birth control that they claim is equivalent to abortion. The science, though, simply does not support that. The morning-after pill doesn't prevent a fertilized egg from attaching to the uterus, as conservatives claim; rather, the pill prevents an egg from being fertilized in the first place, meaning that no pregnancy occurs.
While these examples may not be as extreme as Akin's inane statement about the female body's ability to prevent pregnancy from rape, it shows that many of the male conservative politicians who seem so concerned with birth control and the female body ironically don't understand how they work.
Then there's Akin's phrase, "legitimate rape." Many conservatives have been quick to criticize Akin's word choice; when asked about Akin's statement, Ryan replied, "Rape is rape, period. End of story."
But this all begs the question: What would Akin consider "illegitimate" rape? He already answered that question last year when he co-sponsored the "No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act," which would have only allowed federal funds to be used to terminate pregnancies that were a result of "forcible" rape.
This essentially would have meant that, were you a 13-year-old victim of statutory rape or had you been drugged by your rapist before he assaulted you, your rape "wouldn't count." This wasn't the language of one extreme politician: The bill actually passed the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, although the phase "forcible rape" was later removed thanks to public outcry. Also worth noting: One of the bill's co-sponsors was none other than Ryan.
And despite Akin's apology, he still stands by his assertion that abortion should be banned even in cases of rape or incest. This may seem like an extreme stance to take on abortion, but rather than being a fringe belief, this stance has now become a central pillar of the Republican Party's beliefs. The newest iteration of the party's official platform, which will be formally unveiled this week at the Republican National Convention, calls for a constitutional amendment protecting the fetus' "fundamental individual right to life," but does not mention if exceptions should be allowed in cases of rape and incest.
So the real faux pas Akin made in the eyes of the Republican Party wasn't his beliefs — clearly his ideas are in line with those of many other conservatives. The real reason conservatives are tripping over themselves to put distance between them and Akin is that Akin's blunt delivery laid those conservative views bare, without dressing them up in the usual innocent-sounding political jargon.
The Republican Party can try to cover those views back up by releasing nice sound bites saying "rape is rape" and by begging Akin to drop out of the Senate race, but that doesn't change the fact that Akin's statement matches the Republican Party's actions. And once the majority of Americans realize that, their outrage won't be merely focused on one Senatorial candidate from Missouri.

August signals the end of summer, the return of Carnegie Mellon students to campus, and the Carnegie Mellon Shuttle and Escort Services’ almost annual route changes.
We all long for a little stability when it comes to public transportation, and while it seems that the university’s transportation service is continually seeking to improve itself, it is our right to speak up to improve transit for Carnegie Mellon students.
If you are a student and have been checking your email inbox, you’ll have noticed some new shuttle and escort changes.
The escort service is now arranged into four different color zones instead of neighborhood areas, some stops on Craig Street have been cut due to safety concerns, and the Greenfield neighborhood has been added to the Pittsburgh Technology Center shuttle route.
In theory, all these changes should be positive, helping to improve transportation around campus. But until these theories are put into practice, they have little meaning. These changes, implemented over the summer, will soon face the scrutiny of the students and faculty that use the services.
We have to admit that the shuttle and escort services are often hard and thankless jobs. No matter the changes in service, somebody somewhere will always feel that they are lacking in one way or another. Transportation in Pittsburgh isn’t doing so well as it is, what with the Port Authority struggling along and threatening to cut service left and right.
Regardless, know that Carnegie Mellon welcomes the involvement of its students in important discussions like transportation. We urge you to take advantage of the shuttle and escort services, note the new changes, and — if you feel that something is lacking — speak up. For the past year or so, the university has been holding various meetings about private and public transportation. In addition, student government — and this year’s executive branch in particular — has made a commitment to improving and advocating for better student transportation.
Attending Student Senate meetings or going to student government’s office hours can help you voice your opinions. Getting involved is what truly gets initiatives moving and what will make any transportation changes beneficial and lasting.

Gun control is a difficult topic to discuss because of poorly framed statistics and the passionate response from those personally affected by it. There is not enough space in an article to completely explain why gun control is not a viable solution, so instead I want to offer a few responses to some common claims by proponents of stricter gun control.
First, there is the claim that if you own a gun, you or someone you live with will shoot another person by accident. Last year, there were 613 unintentional deaths by firearm, according to the National Safety Council. Compare this to 1,489 fatalities in 1989. A recent Gallup poll estimated that 45 percent of American homes contain at least one firearm — a figure that has stayed roughly the same since the 1960s.
To frame this, consider that you are four to five times more likely to be accidentally killed by a police officer than you are by a civilian gun owner. Moreover, the odds of death by choking on food, falling down the stairs, or having something fall on your head are roughly the same as those of being accidentally shot. Yet the emotional response to gun accidents far outweighs that of other causes of death.
Another claim of gun control activists is that cutting out guns reduces violent crime rates. Consider Australia and the United Kingdom; both countries strictly control legal gun ownership. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the rates of sexual assault and robbery have remained mostly unchanged while the rate of assaults has risen by more than 8 percent since the gun bans were enacted in 1996.
The United Kingdom also has the highest violent crime rate in the European Union at around 2,000 incidents per 100,000 people, according to annual Eurostat crime trends data. That is four times as many violent crimes per capita as those in the U.S. The United Kingdom handgun bans were enacted in 1997.
A third claim is that because police officers have guns, there’s no reason for private ownership. Of the approximately 794,300 police officers and detectives in the U.S., maybe 150,000 of them are actually on duty at a given time and available to respond to an emergency, assuming that they have three shifts a day and they are occupying non-administrative positions.
Given that 311 million people live in the U.S., that leaves about one officer per 2,000 people. From the Bureau of Justice Statistics, among crimes of violence response times, only 53.4 percent were within 10 minutes, with 8.8 percent taking more than an hour for a response.
Guns are easy to use for both criminals and law-abiding citizens. You have to look past the high-visibility instances of guns used in crimes and refocus on the collective trends at play. Civilian-owned firearms reduce crime occurrences and keep people safe. Learn how to use a firearm or read more about the politics involved before you allow one of your greatest rights to be taken away.

The start of the school year is both a happy and stressful time. The uncertainties of housing, though, can supplant the joys of returning to independent collegiate life. Students often hear stories of others with unfortunate or inadequate campus housing situations, such as students having to live in the Wyndham Garden Hotel back in 2006, or how some dorms changed to first-year exclusive residences in 2008 and left upperclassmen frustrated.
When coming to college, first-years shouldn’t have to worry if they’ll have adequate on-campus housing. Housing and residence policies for all universities should focus on optimizing the living arrangements for their new and largely dependent first-year students, while also working to provide sufficient housing for others wishing to live on campus.
Upperclassmen may have complaints about the housing situation as well. Preference is given to students by age in the housing lottery system, with seniors getting first choice. This may dissuade younger students from trying to maintain campus housing.
Also, should upperclassmen outside of the housing system wish to return to on-campus residences, they will find the process “very difficult,” according to the Carnegie Mellon Housing Assignments FAQ.
Yet poor housing shouldn’t be an issue that incoming first-years face, especially when the cheapest rate for on-campus housing is $6,020 for the academic year.
In order to deal with limited housing, the University of Pittsburgh has a 12-year plan that culiminates in the building of a new first-year dorm on Fifth Avenue. According the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, this addition will add 559 beds for first-year students at Pitt.
Initiatives like this one are a step in the right direction for ensuring housing for first-year students. While the scope of Pitt’s first-year housing issues are clearly larger, what with being a state school with a much larger student population, Carnegie Mellon Housing Services would be wise to look at similar ways to address these problems.

I grew up close to New York City — famous for its pizza, pronunciation of cawfee, and erratic drivers. But its residents are famous for something else: knowing how to walk. I don’t mean they know how to strut or have more swagger; I mean that they don’t travel in hordes of 20 people and take up the entire sidewalk.
When I first came to Carnegie Mellon, the prevalence of bad walking was a shock. As a first-year I didn’t have a car, and the timeliness of the bus system is always a gamble, so walking was how I got around.
But this proved difficult when I would try to walk against the grain of a massive entourage of fellow students on a given sidewalk. The crowd saw me approaching and continued on its merry way as I attempted to walk by.
On multiple occasions, I was forced into the street because a large group of friends simply didn’t understand how to let a single person walk through their cluster — or they didn’t bother to care, which is worse.
Among first-years, this mentality is especially pervasive. You’re in a new place that will have a huge impact on your life. You’re away from your friends, family, and every comfort zone.
During your first few weeks here, you want to meet everyone you can and accumulate a solid core of friends to feel at home. But it’s easy to go overboard, inviting your whole floor to dinner instead of two close friends.
Luckily, this horde mentality eventually dies down and people learn to be okay with walking in a group of two or three, or even by themselves. This year’s incoming first-years were no different than any other incoming class.
As I watched their arrival to campus, I legitimately feared having to walk between Craig Street and Morewood Avenue. As expected, I was once again forced into the street by the clusters of first-years insisting on having a giant entourage everywhere they went.
This is just rude to everyone else on the sidewalk. Apply the overused axiom, “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.” If you see someone trying to get by your group, move over. Don’t force them to endanger their life by having to step into a busy street just to get around.
So first-years — and anyone else who does this — please do everyone on campus a favor and watch where you’re going next time you venture outside your dormitory with your entire floor.
I’m assuming you and your friends didn’t overrun the sidewalks of your hometown before coming to Carnegie Mellon. Were you driving a car, you wouldn’t drive down all three lanes on Forbes Avenue; apply that same logic when walking around.
Just use common sense next time you’re out and about on campus and Pittsburgh.

Last week, Oklahoma City’s NewsChannel 4 reported that a high school valedictorian in Prague, Okla., was blocked from receiving her diploma because she altered her graduation speech and used the word “hell” instead of the pre-approved “heck.”
Kaitlin Nootbaar, the student in question, had completed all required schoolwork with a 4.0 GPA and was not informed of any issue until she went to pick up her physical diploma. The school has commented that it will give Nootbaar her diploma when she issues a formal apology for her actions.
This type of diploma withholding in response to non-academic issues is a common practice for schools to control students during the final few weeks of classes. However, these punishments cheapen the four years of dedication and effort needed to achieve that academic recognition.
At the federal, state, and individual school levels, there are various academic requirements that each student must achieve in order to graduate and be awarded a diploma. If a student meets all of these requirements, it’s naturally assumed that he or she will be given a diploma to represent that achievement. For most people, a high school diploma holds mostly sentimental value — since you are officially a high school graduate regardless of that piece of paper — but some professions and colleges require a copy of your diploma as credentials.
Schools have resorted to withholding diplomas because they have limited options for punishing students at the end of their senior years. Some high schools use the inability to walk across the stage at graduation as a deterrent to end-of-the-year shenanigans. Others withhold diplomas from students who are not the best behaved during their final weeks of classes. Both of these options have a much further-reaching impact than do the standard suspension or detention that these same crimes would garner during the school year. 
Graduation is a celebration not only for the students, but also for those who supported them throughout their long educational journeys. There are still many students in this country who are the first in their families to have the opportunity to graduate from high school and go to college. Threatening to ruin this achievement for minor infractions such as saying “hell” instead of “heck” does not give this possibly life-changing moment the gravitas it deserves.
While there is a need to keep seniors in check in the final weeks of their high school careers, using graduation threats is not an appropriate way to do so. As these students prepare to enter a new stage of their lives, full of new responsibilities, schools should be setting a better example than petty extortion.

The return to college always has a cinematic feel to it. So we asked,
"If your upcoming school year were a movie, what would it be called?"

See the outfit you’re wearing today? Don’t let anyone else see it ever again.
You will get lost in a Wean Hall stairwell at least once today. Instead of concentrating on finding the proper exit, make an effort to be social and say hello to the people you pass on the stairs.
Closing your eyes and wishing really, really hard for summer to be here again will only make you look silly and leave you disappointed. Fall has arrived, and there is nothing you can do about it.
Remember: You is kind, you is smart, and you is important.
Eat lunch outside this week. Food and people-watching go together much better than what your taste buds wanted and what you actually ate for lunch.
At 7:30 p.m. today, something amazing will happen to you. But only if your heart, mind, and soul are ready for the goodness coming your way.... Or maybe you’re just going to get dinner.
The Library Planet is real! Don’t believe me? Wait a week, and you will see all of the classic symptoms come to light in those who never see the light of day. If your roommate has two shadows, run for the hills.
Oh no, they are definitely laughing.
“What do you do with a BA in English...?”
Time Turners are real and there are people in your class who have them. It is time to find a connection to the Time Turner black market or suffer.
When life gives you lemons, be more creative than just making lemonade. You go to Carnegie Mellon for heaven’s sake; you can come up with something much more impressive.
Just smile and repeat to yourself, “Mondays are fun days, Mondays are fun days.”
