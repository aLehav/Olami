“Marc-y Marc is the crème de la crème of the team, the glue that holds us together. He’s always enthusiastic and motivating, never missing an instant to encourage both the upperclassmen or first-years. His words of wisdom are both uplifting and sentimental. He is a poet of sorts; a modern day Walt Disney Whitman,” said junior teammate Benjamin Nealy.
Junior distance runner for men’s track and field, Marc McGeary started running in ninth grade. “I was fat and slow, literally 5’5” and way overweight. I finally manned up and got serious sophomore year and dramatically lost 30 pounds from eating right, running more, and joining the wrestling team,” McGeary said. Although he started running in 2005, McGeary did not begin running competitively until 2007.
On the track, McGeary hopes the team will win Outdoor UAAs. “We came in second at Indoor UAA’s to Washington University, St. Louis. Outdoors is at our track this April; we will drink WashU’s blood during our victory laps,” McGeary said. He would like to run 4:05 in the 1,500-meter run, break 2:00 in the 800-meter run, and make his first UAA squad. 
McGeary is a business administration major in the general management track with a focus in finance and marketing. This summer he will be interning for The Hershey Company in Hershey, Pa., where he will be doing internal auditing for its finance department. 
McGeary’s current claim to fame is his presence in a Mac Miller music video. “I literally ran into Mac Miller filming ‘Party on Fifth Ave.’ in Blue Slide Park. I knew Mac was filming in Pittsburgh, but had no clue where, so we roll up there during preseason — myself, first-year Joe Pane, Matt Kusbit, junior Benjamin Nealy, and sophomore Nathan Cheek — and see these people in old person suits with a couple cameramen. As we pass, I told my teammates I’m pretty sure that is Mac Miller. Not five seconds later, Mac comes up alongside us running and his cameraman follows. Two months later we were, not surprisingly, stoked to see our half-naked bodies all over MTV and YouTube with Mac Miller running alongside us,” McGeary said.
McGeary is a fourth generation Tartan. “My parents, grandfather, great-grandfather, and my great-uncle, who was a blind musical prodigy in the College of Fine Arts, went here. My mom ran track here with the men since they didn’t have a women’s team. She also was on the first women’s buggy team, always saying how much of a ‘pioneer’ she was,” McGeary said.
McGeary appreciates all that Carnegie Mellon does for its athletes. “The most rewarding aspect to being a CMU athlete is getting to do what we love to do at a high level. A lot of kids at D-III schools don’t have nearly what we do in terms of coaches, facilities, and amenities. My brother ran cross country and track for Duquesne (D-I) and they don’t get or have nearly what we do in terms of the above list. He has always been jealous of us,” McGeary said.
As well as being appreciative of the university, McGeary is grateful for his teammates. “The brotherhood and bond between the team is the greatest part. My best friends for life are on the team and it’s special to experience that type of relationship everyday for four years,” McGeary said.
“Marc is truly a gentlemen’s gentleman. He has persevered through several difficult seasons, and is now emerging not only as a leader but a potential top runner for the team. Despite his awful dancing, he is universally loved by his teammates,” junior teammate Graham Shorr said.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s track and field team hosted its annual quad meet this past Saturday. The Tartans finished in first place overall with 171.5 points, followed by Westminster College with 166 points. Penn State Behrend and Washington & Jefferson College both came in third with 161 points.
The meet started off with the 3,000-meter steeplechase, in which sophomore Josh Newby crossed the finish line first with a time of 9:18.41. This was not only a personal best for him, but it was also a Gesling Stadium record for the steeplechase. Newby also placed first in the 800-meter run with a time of 1:58.75.
Junior Noel Titus competed in only one race at the meet because of an injury. He made it count, however; Titus ran a career-best time of 22.18 in the 200-meter dash and won the race.
“The athletic training staff took great care of my hamstring. I think adrenaline helped me push through the pain, and having a rowdy cheering section didn’t hurt either,” Titus said.
The Tartans’ 4x400-meter relay team came in second place, with a very close finish. When first-year Thomas Vanderberg received the baton at the final leg of the relay, the Tartans were in fourth place out of six. However, he passed the Penn State Behrend “A” team. By the time he reached the top of the 100-meter mark, he was at the heels of the first and second place runners. The Tartans ended up finishing second with a time of 3:29.47, only 0.27 seconds behind Westminster.
In the field events, sophomore Nathan Cheek won the hammer throw with a distance of 49.22 meters. Senior Anthony Hernandez followed with a 48.03 meter toss. Sophomore Zachary Erra-Hernandez won the discus throw with a career-best mark of 47.05 meters. Erra-Hernandez also had the first place throw in the shot put with a distance of 15.54, while first-year Gino Pilato threw a season-best 14.47 meters for second place.
First-year Michael McDermott competed in the long jump for the first time, in addition to placing second in the high jump with a height of 1.83 meters.
The track and field team will be continuing its outdoor season, competing again this coming weekend. The distance runners will travel to Bucknell University on Friday, and everyone will compete at Westminster College on Saturday.

On a sunny Saturday in the Steel City, the Carnegie Mellon women’s track and field team hosted its first meet of the season. Penn State Behrend, Washington & Jefferson College, and Westminster College were all in attendance, with Westminster winning the meet just 4.5 points ahead of the Tartans.
First-year Erin Kiekhaefer placed first in the 1,500-meter race, running a season-best time of 4:46.61. First-year Hailey Brown won the steeplechase with a time of 12:36.8.
Senior Ivana Moses competed in several events, placing first in the triple jump (10.50 meters), second in the long jump (4.92 meters), and second in the 100-meter dash (13.24 seconds).
Sophomore Jacqueline Guevel won the 100-meter hurdles and the 400-meter hurdles with times of 14.28 seconds and 1:02.92, respectively. Her efforts in the 4x400 meter relay were strong, as she began her lap in third and surpassed both runners ahead of her to win the event with a time of 4:04.48. Kiekhaefer, first-year Sasha Spalding, and sophomore Kelsey Hallinen were the other three relay runners.
“We cut more than five seconds off our previous best time with everyone running a personal best or close to it,” Guevel said. “We are excited about such a strong finish yesterday.”
Sophomore Samantha Oleson and junior Carissa Iannone competed in the hammer throw, placing second and third, respectively. Oleson threw 39.32 meters and Iannone threw 32.92 meters.
The Tartans will compete again on Friday in distance running events; those competitors will travel to Bucknell University. The following day, the Tartans will be at Westminster College to compete again.

The Stanley Cup playoffs are here, and despite finishing second in the Eastern Conference, the Penguins are the fourth seed in the East. Due to the flaw in the NHL system that seeds teams by division winners before points or record, the Penguins are pitted against the fifth-seeded Philadelphia Flyers, who are actually third in points and were bumped out of the top three for the same reason as were the Penguins.
This matchup should prove to be one of the best first round matchups of the playoffs. Of the eight games the Penguins and the Flyers have played against each other, the last two happened in the past week. On April 1, the Flyers came to town and defeated the Penguins 6–4, but last Saturday, the Penguins finished the season strong with a 4–2 win.
The Flyers are 5–1 at the Penguins’ CONSOL Energy Center since its opening in 2010. Unless the Penguins can finally string together wins against their rivals on their own ice, history would suggest that this series could be quick in the Flyers’ favor.
In their last two matchups of the year, there has been no shortage of bad blood between the two teams. The game on April 1 erupted into a bench brawl in the final minutes. Both coaches got involved, and Flyers coach Peter Laviolette called Penguins coach Dan Bylsma “gutless” in a post-game interview.
This wasn’t the last time the Penguins drew the ire of their division opponents. On Thursday, the Penguins defeated the top-seeded New York Rangers 5–2. Rangers coach John Tortorella was furious because of a knee-to-knee hit by Penguins Brooks Orpik on Rangers’ Derek Stepan, which led to a five-minute penalty and a game misconduct.
In his post-game press conference, Tortorella referred to the Penguins as “one of the most arrogant organizations in the league.” He also called Penguins captain Sidney Crosby and assistant captain Evgeni Malkin “whining stars.”
The Penguins are riding a wave of momentum into the playoffs. Crosby is back to playing significant ice time after recovering from multiple concussions and neck injuries. The team is scoring at an unbelievable rate of three or more goals in its last 11 games.
The biggest concern for the Penguins is goalie Marc-Andre Fleury. Although he was a major player in bringing the Stanley Cup back to Pittsburgh in 2009, he has only stopped 79 percent of shots in his last three games. This kind of struggle from a goalie going into the playoffs is the last thing a contender wants.
Fleury is an elite goalie in the league, but he has been pushed to his limit trying to help the Penguins get a home advantage in the first round of the playoffs. The Penguins will hopefully eliminate the Flyers quickly; with the extra off days that come with the playoffs, Fleury should get enough rest to return to his top form. More often than not, the Stanley Cup is won by the team with the hot goalie that can get wins even on off nights. If things go south for Fleury, the Penguins have backup Brent Johnson, who hasn’t seen a full playoff game from between the pipes in over 10 years.
If the Penguins can get past the unfavorable and unwarranted first round matchup against the Flyers and avoid the red hot Rangers for as long as possible, they have a very good shot at making it to the Stanley Cup finals. 
On paper, the Penguins look like a force to be reckoned with; some would even say they are the favorites to win the cup. With everybody healthy, nobody has more star power than the Pittsburgh Penguins, with All-Stars Crosby and Malkin leading the team. But unless the team can find consistent goaltending, home play, and health, Penguins fans could be blindsided by an early exit from the playoffs.

The women’s water polo team hosted its regional tournament in the University Center’s pool last weekend, where the team won one game and lost three. 
First the Tartans took on the West Chester University Golden Rams. After losing to the Golden Rams in the previous season, the Tartans stepped it up in the pool to defeat them 7–4. This win was not only the first time they defeated West Chester University, but it was also the first time the Tartans have won any game in the northern division. In this game, senior Clare McKendry led the team with six goals while senior Nicole Carter added an additional goal.
Next, the Tartans took on the Pennsylvania State University Nittany Lions. The final score was 11–3 in favor of Penn State; the Tartans’ only lead was 1–0 after the first quarter. The Tartans then fell to the University of Pennsylvania Quakers 8–7.
“This [game against the Quakers] was a much closer game then I think anyone expected,” McKendry said.
Finishing out the weekend, the Tartans played the University of Pittsburgh Panthers. The Tartans fell to the Panthers 8–5. The goals for this game were scored by McKendry, junior captain Alice Tripp, senior Myrka Lembo, sophomore Melanie Jasper, and sophomore Ashley Disbrow.
The Tartans will face the University of North Carolina Tar Heels on Friday and West Chester University Golden Rams again on Saturday at the University of Virginia. The University of Pittsburgh, Penn State, University of Pennsylvania, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, Duke University, and the hometown University of Virginia Cavaliers will also be in attendance.

Students worked vigorously to top their ice cream at the University Center (UC) Friday night, as Robotics club hosted the Annual Rube Goldberg Ice Cream Competition. The competition, which began at 9 p.m., was part of the UC Late Night series held every Friday.
The competition is inspired by Rube Goldberg, a cartoonist and inventor who worked in the 1940s and ’50s. Known for his complicated machines that performed only basic tasks, the name Rube Goldberg is synonymous with performing anything simplistic in a complex manner. Popular games like “Mouse Trap” are inspired by Goldberg’s legacy.
To honor Goldberg’s inventions, Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Club hosts an annual event that requires teams of three people to create Goldberg-inspired machines to make ice cream sundaes in less than three hours.
Students had wood, PVC pipe, string, duct tape, and other materials at their disposal, all provided by Robotics Club. By the time midnight rolled around, the UC had been transformed into a funhouse of sorts, with caution tape and string spanning across Kirr Commons and tables topped with bizarre-looking contraptions.
The judging began with one team’s machine that included a zip-line. Other competitors utilized dominoes, funnels, ramps, and mousetraps to put toppings on their sundaes. 
The winning team, aptly named “Balls Dropping from the Sky,” started with a ball dropping from the second story of the UC, transported to the machine via caution tape. The ball then set off a series of events that ended with a cup of vanilla ice cream with a cherry, M&Ms, and sprinkles.
Although some of the teams failed, all the competitors were lighthearted and in good spirits. According to Priyanka Deo, a sophomore computer science major and social chair of Robotics Club, failing is a part of robotics. “Even though some of the projects failed, everyone was able to be innovative and try new things,” she said.
Robotics Club was founded in 1984, making it one of the oldest robotics clubs on the collegiate level. Today, the club reflects the same quality found in the ice cream competition: a fun, laid-back environment where tech junkies get together and build things.
Aside from the Goldberg contraptions, club members are working on an assortment of projects. Currently in the mix are robots that can move underwater, as well as “colony robots” that are able to localize, form colonies, and act as a single unit. One project called “RobOrchestra” seeks to develop self-playing instruments like the Vibratron.
“[The Vibratron is] a big circular xylophone that you play by dropping ball bearings on the keys at the right time,” explained junior computer science major and Robotics Club member Alex Zirbel. The machine is about four feet in diameter, with all 32 keys positioned around a ring.
Despite the intensity of some of the projects, the members stress the friendliness and receptiveness of everyone there. “The best thing about Robotics Club is the community,” said Pace Nalbone, a junior mechanical engineering major in Robotics Club.
“You can walk in anytime and talk to somebody, and people will help you,” Zirbel said. “You can even come in and ask for help on a homework problem and people would give you advice on how to solve it.”
The ice cream social gave students a taste of what being in Robotics Club is like. “We just got together, took stuff that we had, and made cool things,” Deo said.

A group of Carnegie Mellon graduate students won “Best Proposal” in the U.S. Energy Department’s 2012 Better Building Challenge, an event held last month at the White House. The team’s victory comes as the Department of Energy is seeking to approve more federal loan guarantees for green energy projects.
The team’s 10-page proposal beat out submissions from other universities, including Harvard University, Dartmouth College, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, George Washington University, Columbia University, and Duke University.
Each team was given three weeks to prepare a proposal assessing ways to improve the energy efficiency of buildings nationwide, with the competition culminating in a presentation of their ideas at the White House. Two case studies — one from the public sector and another from the private sector — were assigned to each team. The Carnegie Mellon participants were tasked specifically with the redevelopment of the Walter Reed Medical Center — the U.S. Army’s former flagship medical center located in Washington D.C. — and an energy efficiency plan for a New York City office building.
“I think the goal was to get universities thinking about sustainable development policy, considering all stakeholders,” said team member Farhad Farahmand, a Heinz College master’s student. “Because of the broad scope, the most difficult part was figuring out the key issues to highlight in our proposal, but we had a great team dynamic to work it out.”
The team’s multifaceted approach to tackling the energy needs of the medical center wowed the competition’s judges, which was composed of Department of Energy employees, Walter Reed executives, and other experts on green energy policy.
“Our team recommended an outright sale or long-term lease of the Walter Reed Army Medical Center site to a master developer,” team member Enes Hosgor, a Ph.D. candidate in engineering and public policy, said in a press release. “We asked that the terms of the agreement would require a master developer to meet water and energy sustainability milestones, while also having the district award property tax refunds to the developer to meet the goals.”
According to Farahmand, the policy classes he and his team members have taken “definitely” prepared them for this challenge. “Our Walter Reed analysis was similar to a static model that we built in my methods of policy analysis course,” he said. “We created relationships between variables and filled in hypothetical numbers to see what the optimal outcome would be.”
Team member Colleen Horin Lueken, a Ph.D. candidate in engineering and public policy, also recalled her experiences from another course.
“In 19–705, a class that prepares [engineering and public policy] students for the qualifier exams, professor Granger Morgan really emphasized considering all stakeholder perspectives and interacting with the community when analyzing a policy issue,” she said. “I think our consideration of how our plan for Walter Reed would affect the surrounding neighborhood made us stand out from the competition.”
Other team members included Erica Cochran, a School of Architecture Ph.D. candidate, and Donald Johnson, a Tepper School of Business MBA student.
While the team didn’t receive any significant reward for their efforts besides recognition, they seemed to enjoy the experience regardless. “It was great fun talking to the other teams after the competition,” Farahmand said. “There were a lot of smart people there. Plus, the tour of the White House they scheduled for us the following day was great.”
Farahmand did recall one minor setback for his team that seems more comical to him in retrospect.
“The night before the competition they put us in a hotel that faced an open-roof club across the street,” he said. “There was pretty loud thumping music until 2 a.m. the night before — but we still rocked it!”

Particle collider running with more power
Geneva’s Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the most powerful particle accelerator on Earth, resumed operations last week after a few months of inactivity. The experiments, which began last Thursday, reached record-breaking energy levels of 8 trillion electron-volts. The LHC will be active until November, when it will be upgraded over the following 20 months. The upgrades will give the collider a top energy of 14 trillion electron-volts.
One of the primary goals of the LHC, and of this year’s experiments in particular, is to find evidence of the Higgs boson. Sometimes called the “God particle,” the Higgs is a theoretical subatomic particle that may be the reason why matter has mass. The hunt for the Higgs has been a focus of physicists for years, with experiments at the Tevatron, another collider located in Batavia, Ill., giving inconclusive evidence of its existence at the end of last year.

New link found between CO2, global warming
Research on carbon dioxide concentrations and temperature during the Pleistocene ice ages (2.5 million to 11,700 years ago) has provided additional evidence that carbon dioxide levels and global climate are linked. A team led by scientists from Harvard University, Columbia University, and Oregon State University extrapolated core-ice samples from the Antarctic to establish a global record of surface temperatures.
In previous studies, it appeared that carbon dioxide levels rose after temperature increased, leading climate skeptics to question the role of carbon dioxide in climate change. This recent report shows that rising temperatures both correlated with and lagged behind increases in carbon dioxide concentrations. The researchers concluded that increased carbon dioxide levels explain much of how the planet was able to warm up from the last ice age.

DARPA challenge aims to involve humanoid robot
According to industry sources, the next Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Grand Challenge will require teams to build humanoid robots able to work in industrial disasters and rough terrain. DARPA is a division of the military that pursues cutting-edge research, with famous results such as ARPANET, part of the original internet. 
The Grand Challenge is a competition funded by the agency in which teams must complete a specified scenario. Previous competitions have included urban and desert races for automated vehicles. Carnegie Mellon’s Tartan Racing won the 2007 urban challenge.
In the new challenge, teams will have to construct bipedal, humanoid robots that can operate with only supervisory control. Robots will need to drive a utility vehicle, unlock a room with a key, enter the room, and cross a debris-strewn floor. After this, the robot must climb a ladder and interact with a pump and valve.

Scientists find feathery dinosaur in China
Paleontologists in China’s Liaoning province have unearthed fossils of the largest feathered creature ever discovered, called Yutyrannus huali. This dinosaur weighed 1.4 metric tons, or over 3,000 pounds, and was about the length of a school bus. It lived about 125 million years ago.
Fossil evidence suggests that the species was covered entirely with feathers. However, researchers are not sure exactly what purpose the feathers had since the creature’s size made flight out of the question.
Because the dinosaurs lived in an area with an average temperature of 50°F, the cold-blooded creatures may have needed additional insulation. Although paleontologists previously thought large body size excluded feathers, recent discoveries of medium-sized feathered dinosaurs, and now Yutyrannus huali, present new possibilities.

Human Genome Project moves to Amazon
The 1,000 Genomes Project, an effort of the National Institutes of Health and the largest database of human genetics, will be moving to Amazon’s cloud services. Although the genetic data was previously available online, it was costly and it required interested scientists to have powerful computing resources. Amazon hosting will drastically cut costs for researchers in terms of both access and analysis.
The 1,000 Genomes Project actually includes genomic data from 1,700 individuals, with 900 more samples being added this year. One of the project’s goals is to enable research that more accurately predicts disease based on genetic factors. Two-hundred terabytes of  genetic data will be transferred to Amazon — an amount so large that it would require  30,000 DVDs’ worth of storage. The transfer is part of a larger government-wide initiative to make large datasets more widely available for analysis.

Google glasses will allow visualizing maps, photo-taking
Google announced that it is testing Project Glass, a set of augmented reality glasses that include a clear display that sits above the right eye.  The built-in display technology can stream information to the lens, and the wearer can interact with the device through voice commands. Potential uses identified by Google include visualizing maps, taking photos, and video conferencing.
Although rumors have existed about Project Glass for months, the development team made the first official announcement on Google+ last week. The devices run a version of the Android operating system used on smartphones, and they also have GPS and motion sensors. Although the glasses are not yet for sale, Google plans to test them with the public.

It’s a sunny, warm Saturday morning. The streets of the Strip District are loud, lively, and bustling with hundreds of pedestrians buying wholesale meats, produce, and Penguins paraphernalia. Just a few blocks east, though, in the slightly quieter, more tranquil part of the neighborhood, a family gathers around a giant stainless steel pot — they’re making whiskey.
That’s whiskey with an “e,” since it’s not from Canada, nor is it from across the Atlantic. This is pure, homebred whiskey being produced in the heart of a special region when it comes to the history of alcohol in America. Wigle Whiskey, a new, family-owned whiskey distillery located in the Strip, opened its doors to the public this past March. It’s the first of its kind in western Pennsylvania since the infamous Whiskey Rebellion, a tax protest that took place in the area over 200 years ago.
“Harry Truman said the Whiskey Rebellion was one of the six most important events in American history — and this is the guy who made the decision to drop the atomic bomb,” said Eric Meyer, who co-owns the distillery with his father and sister. The distillery is named after Phillip Wigle (pronounced like “wiggle”), a good-natured whiskey distiller who was sentenced to death for treason during the Whiskey Rebellion.
“He was sort of the ultimate wrong place, wrong time guy,” Meyer said. Wigle was luckily pardoned by President George Washington and eventually ended up living a peaceful life distilling whiskey in West Virginia, according to Meyer.
Meyer explained that Pittsburgh’s role in the rebellion was one of his family’s motivations for starting the distillery. “We don’t have the space nor the resources to make the museum that the Whiskey Rebellion deserves,” he said, but the Wigle team does offer tours of the distillery in which visitors learn all about the history of the Whiskey Rebellion and Wigle’s role in the revolt.
“One of the things I’m hoping is that, through our business, we can raise awareness about the event,” Meyer said. “I think there are a lot of people in Pittsburgh that are oblivious that this even occurred here.”
The decision to create the distillery was “a family decision,” according to Meyer. His father was a retiring lawyer, his sister an entrepreneur, and Meyer himself, who previously earned a master’s degree in public policy and management from Carnegie Mellon, was finishing up work with the municipal government in Washington state. The family was ready for something different.
“We decided that we’d like to do a business that was located in the city of Pittsburgh, where we’re from, that added to the already very rich urban fabric that we have here,” Meyer said. They decided that Meyer would handle the various business-related duties, his father would take on the role of master distiller, and his sister would handle many of the marketing tasks.
After picking the Strip District site in August 2010, construction of the distillery began in February 2011. The family received its federal license to distill and immediately started distilling in December 2011. Just three months later, they began selling their whiskey to the public.
Pennsylvania is known for its strict alcohol laws, and one uncertainty that loomed over the family’s shoulders during the development of the business was whether or not they could sell their product to customers at the distillery. Until this past February, one month before Wigle Whiskey officially opened, it had been illegal for any distillery or brewery in the state to sell its products to customers on-site. The passage of a new law changed that, just in time for the Wigle opening.
“Once that went through, this was really the vision we had, to create this distillery in the Strip District that was a point of pride for the city,” Meyer said.
As for the whiskey itself, the company takes a more traditional approach by bypassing the aging process in oak barrels — that is, to sell it in its “white” form. This, Meyer explained, is reminiscent of the way it was made in the past.
“If you were you in 1791, and you were living here in Pittsburgh, you would be drinking white whiskey — you’d be drinking white rye,” he said. In addition to rye, Wigle Whiskey also produces a wheat-based white whiskey, both of which are sourced locally from Washington County.
The purpose of letting the whiskey sit, or age, in wooden barrels is to allow certain components in the wood and in the liquor interact with each other. Compounds in the wood, known as tannins, interact with substances in the liquor known as congeners. These special interactions produce tastes in the whiskey, like vanilla or caramel, that wouldn’t exist otherwise.
“We’re really trying to get away from the ‘dark whiskey is better than aged whiskey.’ It’s different,” Meyer said. “With the white whiskey, because it’s not really put into a barrel, you taste the grain. The aged whiskey, what you’re really tasting is the wood.”
The distillery won’t be avoiding aged whiskey, though. Their first batch of aged whiskey was placed in barrels just last week. The product will be ready to sell in another two years.
In addition to breaking stereotypes associated with the type of whiskey, the Wigle team hopes to help improve the perception of the liquor itself. “It’s a lot of trouble getting people who have had one bad experience with a very bad whiskey to start afresh,” Meyer said. “We want people to come in here with an open mind.”
For the time being, Wigle’s white whiskey has appeared to sit rather well with customers.
“Our biggest problem right now is meeting demand,” Meyer said.

In a black hoodie and ankle boots, singer-songwriter Julianna Barwick could have easily passed as a normal Carnegie Mellon student stopping for a bite to eat at The Underground last Monday. Instead, she was there to play an intimate concert hosted by AB Underground.
Barwick’s music is a captivating combination of vocal loops and layers of sound. Working primarily with just a microphone and a loop board, she creates a heavy sound with haunting harmonies and tension. Her songwriting process is mainly trial and error. “When I’m making music, it’s all just on the spot,” Barwick said. “I’ll plug everything and start singing, start making a song, just like I do live, but I’m making it as I go. I keep whatever I like and I delete what I don’t like. And then later I’ll add guitar, extra melodies, drums, or piano.”
Her most recent EP, The Magic Place was released in February 2011 by Asthmatic Kitty Record. The record features a larger piano presence than her previous records and a distinctly melancholy mood throughout.
“My first two records are total bedroom recordings,” Barwick said, comparing her first two recording experiences with that of The Magic Place. “It’s so cozy to make stuff in your room, but with the first couple of records I had to spend a lot of time editing out a car driving by or the neighbors upstairs.... With the last record it was a soundproofed room with a baby grand in it.”
Talking about the name of the newest EP, Barwick said, “I lived on a farm when I was kid and there was actually a place like that that we called ‘the magic place.’ It was like this crazy tree that grew up and out and down, and you had to crawl underneath to get inside of it. And when you were inside of it, it was like an Alice in Wonderland house.”
When listening to The Magic Place, it’s hard to imagine any setting other than the woods. The album makes you feel like you’re surrounded by trees, no matter where you are. This same feeling carried over into her live show last week — from the swirling harmonies to the video projection behind her modest set up.
Made by one of Barwick’s friends, the visuals for her show were perfectly suited to the music. A shifting image of forests and rivers, the projection helped set the scene for Barwick’s ethereal music.
The Underground is a strange venue for concerts. With unassuming students wandering around and the occasional call-out of a number to signify that an order is ready, there are plenty of distractions. Barwick’s set, however, transformed The Underground into a peaceful and surreal environment, captivating the small but attentive crowd.
Barwick is scheduled to play at the Guggenheim next Friday with Grouper as part of the Divine Ricochet three-part music series, a much larger concert than the small show last week.
“Every show is different and every show has a reason,” Barwick said about performing at a variety of venues. “For me, its not always about the place, but where my brain is and how the sound systems sounds or how is the show going.”

Fragrant smells, bright colors, and chirping birds await visitors of the Phipps Conservatory Spring Flower Show. Described as “a trip around the world” on the Phipps website, the month-long show offers plenty of variety to engage patrons of all ages and tastes. From interactive displays to tranquil spots, this year’s show lets viewers escape the hustle and bustle of campus in exchange for some peace and quiet.
The main atrium includes large, brightly colored, stick figure-esque pieces of art, adding to the show’s playfulness and serving as a nice introduction to the bombardment of vibrantly colored flowers to come. Another piece of artwork in the atrium includes cut outs of the flags of each country represented in the show: the United States, Greece, France, the Netherlands, China, Sweden, the French Polynesian Islands, the United Kingdom, India, Japan, Germany, Holland, and Ireland.
Housed in the Serpentine Room are tulips representing Holland and the Netherlands. Shades of bright yellows, oranges, and purples combined with the room’s tall ceilings allow for a beautiful view of the tulips lining three of the walls. Amid signs describing the flowers of the region stand large, wooden, brightly painted tulips with pairs of clogs fastened to the bottom of the tulips for decoration. The exhibit is made possible in part by the Distinctively Dutch Festival. Supported by the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, the Distinctively Dutch Festival focuses on bringing contemporary art, performance, and culture from the Netherlands to Pittsburgh in exhibits like this one.
Some rooms have themes set in a broader context than just a country, like the orchid room. Boasting hundreds of orchids of different shapes, colors, smells, and sizes, winding along a small river swarming with koi fish, the room includes educational signs for visitors answering the question, “What is an orchid?” According to the signs, the orchid is a member of the largest and most advanced blooming plant family, and there are approximately 35,000 orchids and 80,000 orchid hybrids throughout the world.
The exhibit honoring Japan is outside, unlike the majority of the other exhibits. Away from the hum of other patrons and secluded on a corner of the roof, the exhibit features a variety of bonsai trees set on wooden tables, a small waterfall running through the middle, and more swimming koi fish.
The exhibits for China and France are organized to be observed, as opposed to most others that can be walked through. The China exhibit is outfitted mainly in red and gold, described by the accompanying placard as colors of good luck and good fortune for the year to come. The France exhibit includes tables and chairs reminiscent of a Paris street café and was topped with a miniature Eiffel Tower.
The exhibit representing London includes a bright red, life-size telephone booth. Upon further examination of the flowers in the room, patrons will notice they are specifically arranged by color to resemble a large British flag. Other features to watch for include an interactive fountain in the room on Greece and a children’s market with plastic food to teach younger guests about eating locally and choosing healthy options.
The Tropical Forest India exhibit will be at Phipps for the next three years and focuses on sustainability. Larger in size and scale than any other exhibit, the room features winding paths and displays intended to replicate actual Indian markets. According to Phipps employee Kara Gilbert, “They sent two people from the horticulture staff to India for research. They were there for five weeks, I think, so they did a lot of research throughout different sections of India to represent the plants that you see here.”
Gilbert also explained the process behind getting exhibits in and out of Phipps. Before the summer show, there will be a two-week blackout period while old plants are taken out and new plants put in their place. In the case of the India exhibit, about 80 percent of the plants from the previous forest were removed to make room for the new forest. The removed plants are either saved for use in later exhibits, or composted for use with the new plants.
Gilbert thanks the volunteers for the speedy turnover in new exhibitions. “We depend a lot on our volunteers,” she said. “Our volunteers are wonderful, they come in and help rip out plants and plant new ones.” Thanks to the work of these volunteers and the Phipps staff, the Spring Flower Show offers visitors a chance to immerse themselves in an around-the-globe adventure of nature.
The Spring Flower Show will be on display until April 15.

Animators Erin Cosgrove, Tom Sito, and Chris Sullivan shared their wisdom in a discussion panel held in Giant Eagle Auditorium last Monday. The animators drew an audience of students from Carnegie Mellon and the Art Institute of Pittsburgh, along with other members of the Pittsburgh community. The panel, second in a two-part animation symposium that took place last weekend, was part of the Carnegie Mellon Media Initiative.Established by College of Fine Arts professor Jim Duesing and English professor Kathy Newman, the Media Initiative encourages the use of new and social media.
The three featured animators come from a variety of backgrounds, and approach animation with different techniques. Cosgrove, a contemporary independent artist, uses digital and hand-drawn 2–D animation to illustrate her written work and artistic concepts. Sullivan, a graduate of Carnegie Mellon and a current faculty member at the Art Institute of Chicago, also uses animation to realize his artistic concepts through stop-motion and traditional drawings. Sito has a background in commercial animation and has worked on digital and traditional animated productions.
The animators each shared their individual animation processes. Cosgrove and Sullivan work independently, giving them the control they need to portray their artistic concepts in a way true to their initial visualizations. Cosgrove’s 65-minute animation “What Manner of Person Art Thou?” emphasizes the damaging sides of religion and is the result of four years of independent work.
Sullivan has also committed himself to enduring personal work. “Consuming Spirits,” his newest animation, was shown at the symposium on Sunday and was the culmination of nearly 15 years of work. For the project, Sullivan worked with a small team of animators, combining multiple animation techniques — including traditional hand-drawn animation, stop-motion figurine, and puppet animation — to create the film.
“You have to figure out how to keep yourself mentally, creatively alive through the process,” Sullivan said, explaining his extensive work. “You get into an idea where you know what the ingredients are, and then you can visually play with it. You keep the idea alive through evaluation.” Sullivan’s “Consuming Spirits” is set to premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival at the end of April.
Sito’s work tends to be more on the commercial end of animation, but he still understands the effort needed to maintain focus throughout the lengthy process of animating. The artist has worked on animated films such as Disney’s classic The Little Mermaid to Osmosis Jones, which Sito co-directed. “I’ve worked with anywhere from five to 500 people,” Sito said. “A lot of it’s about collaboration.”
Chris O’Neill and Erik Bang, seniors majoring in media arts and animation at the Art Institute of Pittsburgh, related to Sito’s words on collaboration. “You don’t want to let other people down — don’t want to disappoint,” O’Neill said, reflecting on teamwork as an essential motivating force in his own work.
Sito knows how important a film can be when a team works together. Snow White is his classic inspiration for animated films. “It still feels fresh,” he said. After all, he continued, “How often do you go out of your way to see a 1937 movie?”

In today’s world, classical musicians must conceptualize new and interesting ways to present their craft if they are to stay afloat in the industry. One group in Pittsburgh is doing just that: Chatham Baroque, a string trio that performs on instruments from the Baroque era, is performing this Thursday at the Downtown restaurant Olive or Twist.
Classical music, generally performed on a stage by musicians in tuxedos, is widely known for its inaccessibility. Musicians are held on a pedestal figuratively and literally, confusing music — ancient and modern — is given no explanation, and audience members are expected to sit quietly for 90 minutes or more.
With their performance this week and others like it, Chatham Baroque seeks to correct these problems. The trio will be at the same level and only a few feet from onlookers. They will talk between pieces, discussing their music as they go. The program will be a 60-minute summation of a longer program they will perform on Saturday and Sunday called “La Suave Melodia,” which features works by Italian Baroque composers Francesco Veracini, Giovanni Foscarini, and Giuseppe Tartini, among others.
Patrons are encouraged to sip drinks and munch hors d’oeuvres throughout. Chatting will not be looked down upon, and audience members will not be asked to silence their cell phones.
“One thing that seems to keep potential patrons away from concerts is a fear of the unknown,” said Marc Giosi, executive director of Chatham Baroque. “It’s sort of an obscure thing to ask of people, that they come out to a presentation of Western art music, sit alone in an auditorium in fancy clothes, and enjoy this shared experience. This is an effort to bridge that, to give people a chance to relax and just enjoy the music.”
Le Poisson Rouge, an art cabaret in New York City, influenced Chatham Baroque to collaborate with Olive or Twist. The club, which is known for housing contemporary classical performances, seeks to reframe the art form by pulling classical music out of the concert hall.
Chatham Baroque is an underrated gem of Pittsburgh. Better known outside of Pittsburgh than in it, the ensemble maintains an extensive national and international touring schedule. Founded in 1990, the group has recorded seven CDs to date. They host a successful concert series in Pittsburgh, put on a series for children called “Peanut Butter & Jam Sessions,” and play a program called “Music All Over the Place,” in which they take their classical music into unsuspecting venues in hopes of infesting new ears with their passion.
The trio’s highest voice is Andrew Fouts on Baroque violin. Patricia Halverson is the trio’s viola da gamba player, and Scott Pauley plays both theorbo and Baroque guitar. For those who haven’t heard of these musicians, a search for any of these names will reveal impressive background information and discography.
The group’s performance at Olive or Twist is only the second of its kind for Chatham Baroque. The first took place in February and featured harpist Paula Fagerberg on the Italian triple harp. There will doubtless be many more innovative and exciting performances to come.

At 10 p.m. on Penn Avenue, few things draw a crowd like free food and $5 T-shirts. The TeeRex Syndicate, a locally owned and operated custom T-shirt and hoodie emporium, opens its doors to the public only once a month for Unblurred: First Fridays on Penn Avenue. This one Friday per month is all the company needs, however, to maintain an establishment that doubles as a thriving business and a committed creative endeavor. 
Samantha Ginsburg, a native of Pittsburgh, and her husband Steve Streibig own and run The TeeRex Syndicate. They both have “real jobs” — Ginsburg works in asbestos removal and interior demolition, while Streibig works in multimedia interactive design — but the TeeRex Syndicate affords them the unique opportunity to act on their creative urges and enjoy the community that surrounds the T-shirt once a month.
“We both decided that we wanted to do something that would be more fun [with] less regulations,” Ginsburg said. “We saw a T-shirt business go up for sale, and we bought it.”
The TeeRex Syndicate now owns upward of 3,000 custom designs, created mostly by members of its staff. “We pretty much like to give people the creative freedom to do whatever they want,” Ginsburg said, when asked about the design process. She credits the ever-expanding collection of unique shirts and hoodies to “all the different people who have worked” at the company since its opening in 2009.
In addition to the studio in which the shirts are made by direct silk screening, The TeeRex Syndicate operates a website at which more than 1,000 of their designs are available for purchase. They also encourage custom shirt requests, fitted for any and every occasion.
When asked to describe their T-shirts, Ginsburg said, “There’s a definite mix [of] humor. One of our best-selling shirts is a possum wearing Ray-Bans that says ‘Awesome Possum.’ ” Other witty shirt fronts include “Trust Me, I’m a Ninja” in bold, bubbled letters, and a kitten staring blankly upward with “Existence is Futile” written above it. The TeeRex Syndicate also produces several locally themed shirts, including tees with dioramic sketches of Oakland, East End, Downtown, and a shirt with a group of stick figures saying “There’s a You in Yinz.” 
Several of these inspired T-shirts are available only at the studio during Unblurred art walks, not online. Combining this exclusivity, affordability, and free food and drinks on a Friday night, The TeeRex Syndicate has succeeded in establishing itself as one of Pittsburgh’s go-to providers of unique and custom tees and hoodies and as an essential stop on any Penn Avenue art walk.
The TeeRex Syndicate is located at 5440 Penn Ave. It can be found online at www.cottonfactory.com.

The mixtape is a criminally underappreciated art form. You have probably seen them used as novelty items — goodie bags at Sweet Sixteens and Bar Mitzvahs — that will never be played again. Such a waste of potential.
A mixtape can be so much more than just a playlist of songs. As a narrative medium, it is just as legitimate as the short story or the painting. By making a mixtape, you act as a curator, compiling an anthology that extends well beyond the reach of any time period or genre. You can draw on everything from Top 40 to proto-punk to chillwave to construct a unique narrative that connects its constituent parts in a manner that transcends their superficial stylistic differences.
You can weave a plot with the prodigious guitar playing of Michael Hedges and the visceral voice of Björk. Or you can construct a scene with the overly emotive Bright Eyes coupled with the soft, detached piano playing of Nils Frahm. Either way, there is intentionality to your work that is not often acknowledged in a mixtape.
But there is more to a mixtape than just intentionality. By creating this anthology of music, you are distilling the most intimate parts of yourself, just like any other art form. From your music library, you search for the songs that not only sound most appropriate, but also those that you have attributed significance to through repeated listening. By placing them in your mixtape, you again change their significance. Just as a writer conveys his or her own unique voice through words, you convey your own unique voice through the selection and arrangement of songs.
This mixtape that you create could only ever be made by you. You may not like writing or be able to draw a straight line, but you can listen. When all is said and done, you will have a piece of art that is yours and yours alone. All you have to do is listen.

Dear Patrick,
Help! I’m stranded on an island by myself in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. I managed to save a pen, a piece of paper, and a bottle from the plane crash, and I’m using them to send you this one message. You’re my only hope. My question is: How do you eat a coconut? Please help, I’m starving.
Warmest regards,
Witlessly Isolated, Lost Sole Obvious Nourishment
Dear WILSON,
Luckily for you, I’ve seen Cast Away at least 10 times. I’ll put a copy of the DVD in a bottle and see if I can get it to you. First, you need to get a big rock, then you need to smash the coconut with it. That’s pretty much all you need to do. More importantly, though, you can use the liquid (or “coconut water”) to make booze. And that’s really what you need on a desert island.
Sadly, you need yeast to ferment any alcohol, and that’s probably in short supply. That explains why Tom Hanks didn’t spend the entire movie wasted. Well, maybe he did, he just pulled it together on screen. Basically what I’m trying to say is that I really have no idea, but I love Hanks. The dude’s great. In fact, I think I’ll send you all his DVDs to entertain you while you await rescue.
You do have a DVD player, right?
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
I’m nursing a wicked hangover. I have a pounding headache, horrible stomachache, and I can’t move. I regret everything that led me to this point. Not enough to change my behavior, though. Do you have any tips for recovering? I need to know soon so I can keep drinking.
Thanks,
Painfully Alcohol Ravaged, Tonight Tempts With Opportunity
Dear PART TWO,
Well, you could just drink less. Ha! I’m kidding; that’d be crazy. Everyone has their own hangover cure, and most of them don’t work. Personally, I like a bagel after a night out. It won’t make you feel better, but bagels are delicious. The classic strategy is to drink some of what you drank last night. You won’t feel hungover if you’re still drunk.
But at the end of the day, the best way to cure a hangover is to stop it from ever happening. Drink a lot of water while you’re drinking. The rule of thumb is one glass of water for every drink. The next morning just pop a couple aspirin and you’ll be ready to hit the bars again. Just don’t forget to drink water.
Don’t let a little pain stop you from drinking,
Patrick Hoskins

The acclaimed director and writer duo from Juno, Jason Reitman and Diablo Cody, reunited for this 2011 dark comedy about a fiction writer who returns to her small Minnesota town after a divorce. Charlize Theron stars as the aforementioned writer who reconnects with her high school boyfriend, but finds out a lot has changed since the days when she was prom queen. Much like Juno delivered a sharp-yet-funny take on teen pregnancy, Young Adult delivers a sharp-yet-funny take on prolonged adolescence.

The University of Pittsburgh has been the target of over 20 bomb threats since mid-February, the majority of which have been made in the past few weeks.
The series of threats began on Feb. 13 when a threat was made against the Chevron Science Center, where Pitt’s chemistry department is located. Since then, simultaneous threats have been made against locations on the Pitt campus, including dorm buildings. In addition, a threat has been made against Point Park University.
After the first threat, another bomb threat was leveled against the Cathedral of Learning on March 14. The Cathedral houses multiple Pitt classrooms and has over 42 floors.
From that point on, the threats against Pitt have become more frequent. Threats have been placed against the Cathedral of Learning and the Chevron Science Center on multiple occasions. Other targeted buildings include David Lawrence Hall, Posvar Hall, Litchfield Towers, the Music Building, the Frick Fine Arts Building, and Victoria Hall.
The threats have differed in their delivery. Some were written in Pitt bathrooms, while others were emailed in via reporters.
One of the threats against Litchfield Towers was made at 2 a.m., forcing a nighttime evacuation of students from their dormitories.
The Pitt Police Department released a statement offering a reward of $50,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person responsible for the threats. “Pitt is stating its appeal to the public to assist the University of Pittsburgh Police and FBI with their investigation,” the department said in the message.
The constant threats and disruptions have taken a toll on the Pitt community. Assistant linguistics professor David Mortensen told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, “Please stop or I will find you.... It’s not fun anymore. You can’t plan anything anymore. You get kind of concerned — because what if something does happen?”
Pitt chemistry Ph.D. student Marshall McGoff said, “People get desensitized to it, because you get these text messages. It got to the point two days ago, where people were like, ‘Oh, there’ll probably be a bomb threat at 10 o’clock.’ People were almost joking about it. But then, the last few days, someone put in a threat for three or four buildings at once. So it wasn’t just one building, it was multiple buildings.... If they don’t catch them soon, people are just going to stop going to class. It’s very unsettling to be a Pitt student right now.”
McGoff also spoke to the effect the threats have had on his studies. 
“The other day I was growing up cultures for protein purification, and it’s a very strict timeline,” McGoff said. “If you miss that window, you have to start over the next day. There was a bomb threat at 10, and I was just in the window to continue my work. There’s been days where there’s a bomb threat, and okay, I can’t do any work today, because what I needed to get done, I need to get done now.”
On Sunday, Pitt police announced several new security measures, adding to the inconvenience. Under the new measures, bags will not be allowed into buildings, everyone entering a building will be required to show a Pitt ID, and non-Pitt students will not be allowed in residence halls.
“I know the general concensus among everyone is that it’s a really big pain, because it’s not easy to carry all your books from class to class, but I guess it’s necessary if these threats continue,” said first-year chemistry major Tim Kaniecki. “I don’t think [the measures] will cut down on the threats, but they’ll cut down at least on the time it takes to deal with the threats.”
Pitt Vice Chancellor for Public Affairs Robert Hill told Essential Public Radio that the university takes the threats and their effects — including the emotional toll — seriously. “We have included in our notifications information about counseling services available to members of the University community, especially students who would like to receive guidance counseling during these stressful times,” Hill said in the interview.

The contract between Highmark and UPMC, allowing those under Highmark’s insurance to use UPMC facilities, will terminate on June 30, 2013. Carnegie Mellon students with Carnegie Mellon’s Highmark health insurance plan will be unable to use the local UPMC facilities after the termination.
Carnegie Mellon’s Health Services department has sent out a request for proposals (RFP) in anticipation of the contract’s end. An RFP invites health insurance companies to submit proposals so that the university can select one of them as its new health insurance company.
“There is some sense now that that agreement will not only cover to ... 2013, but will run into 2014. But that said, we weren’t in that place when we made the decision to send out a RFP,” said Anita Barkin, the director of university health services.
Barkin said that Health Services invited twenty insurance carriers and brokers to submit, but only four responded with proposals: Highmark, UPMC, Aetna, and United Healthcare.
“Aetna and United Healthcare now have contracts with UPMC. That was not the case in the past,” Barkin said. “So I think that was also a reason why Aetna and United were interested in providing a proposal for our student health insurance program, and that was because now UPMC facilities are part of their network.”
According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, UPMC refuses to negotiate for a new contract with Highmark because Highmark is in the process of acquiring the West Penn Allegheny system of hospitals, UPMC’s only competition in the Pittsburgh area.
UPMC CEO Jeffrey Romoff told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that UPMC couldn’t contract with Highmark if the company acquires the West Penn Allegheny system. “A new contract would allow Highmark to steer patients away from UPMC’s facilities and doctors,” Romoff said.
Some students believe that might be a good thing. “I think that the monopoly UPMC has on healthcare in Pittsburgh is raising the price of healthcare overall,” said Katherine Forsyth, a junior biology and history double major.
Junior electrical and computer engineering and computer science double major Faith Clayton said that the extended contract is  “postponing the inevitable.”
Barkin said that Carnegie Mellon’s Health Services department is more concerned with getting a plan that will cover both local and international facilities.
“For us, it boils down to having access to UPMC facilities because that’s where [the students] live. That’s the easiest facilities to access and that’s the largest network that wraps around where [the students] live,” Barkin said. “Beyond that, we need a pretty broad network because our students travel everywhere. So we need access to the local facilities and access to a very broad network and we need it at the very best prices we can get it.”
In the past, Carnegie Mellon Health Services awarded the students’ health insurance contract to Highmark because students responded that they had a very high level of satisfaction with the company. According to Barkin, Health Services has also been satisfied: Their claims get paid promptly, the students get coverage inside and outside of Pittsburgh, and there have been no disputes over payment.
However, Barkin said that if, in the future, UPMC is not part of Highmark’s program, it would be very unlikely for the university to stay with the company.
“We don’t want to take a chance of not having access to UPMC,” Barkin said.

When computer science seniors graduate this May, their adviser, Mark Stehlik, will also leave Carnegie Mellon’s Pittsburgh campus. Stehlik plans to make an impact on students at the other end of the globe, taking a five-year appointment as associate dean at Carnegie Mellon’s Qatar campus.
Stehlik, the assistant dean of the School of Computer Science (SCS), began teaching at Carnegie Mellon in 1982. “I started here at Carnegie Mellon at 1979 as a Ph.D. student in computer science,” Stehlik said. “I wasn’t really excited about the research direction I was on, and I knew I wanted to teach.” He applied for an opening as a teaching professor in the computer science department. He got the job, and he has not stopped teaching since.
Stehlik is one of the few administrative faculty members involved in the undergraduate program of the SCS since its creation in 1988. One of the key factors of SCS’s success, Stehlik said, was that Carnegie Mellon already had one of the best Ph.D. programs in computer science. 
Stehlik said that his main role as assistant dean of SCS was to “figure out how to take some best attributes of that [graduate] program and just move it [to the undergraduate program] and bring really strong students.”
Another integral part of Stehlik’s daily work is advising. He has shepherded more than 2,500 students through the undergraduate computer science program.
Duncan Boehle, a senior computer science major, is one of the students Stehlik advises. “Mark has been my adviser since my sophomore year,” he said. “Mark Stehlik is just incredibly helpful, and he’s always very, very honest. He can understand how to communicate with people as students and how to relate to them.”
“Earlier in my sophomore year, I wanted to create a new minor in game development,” Boehle said. “I wanted it to be interdisciplinary.... I think a lot of advisers might just shake their heads and say, ‘We can’t change policies like that.’ Mark was extremely helpful in the process. He said, ‘Let’s go to do that.’ We’ve been working to create this new minor that is going to be in the course catalog.” Boehle estimated that the minor will be officially approved next year.
Malcolm Greaves, a junior computer science major, has been advised by Stehlik since his first year at Carnegie Mellon. “When I was a freshman, I was an ECE major. I figured out pretty quickly that I actually didn’t want to do ECE,” Greaves said. “I had my first conversation with Mark. I figured out at that first conversation that I wanted to be a computer science major. He worked with me that semester and next semester and all these semesters so far and helped me transition to the CS major. That really shaped my entire academic path.”
Greaves said that Stehlik will continue advising him even after he moves to Qatar; there are about 30 students that share Greaves’ situation. “We plan to use Skype and email to converse with one another for advisement,” Greaves said.
Stehlik said that he is excited to work at the Qatar campus. “It will be very interesting to work at the Qatar campus. I will be the associate dean for undergraduate education, so I will be in charge of the computer science, information system, business, and new biology and computational biology program.” 
Stehlik taught at Qatar in the spring semesters of 2006, 2007, and 2008. He said that the Qatar campus has a lot of potential, and he hopes to help it in whatever way he can.
Tom Cortina, a computer science professor, will assume Stehlik’s position next semester as assistant dean. Cortina said that he feels a lot of pressure.
“A lot of eyes will be on me,” Cortina said. “There will be a lot of comparisons to Mark. But I’m not Mark. I will do my best to do his job, and what he has done for students and for the undergraduate program. But there will be changes, because we are different people.”

Maggie Koerth-Baker, the science editor of the group blog BoingBoing, spoke to several dozen graduate students and professors about systemic changes in sustainability on Friday.
During the lecture, which was part of the Sustainability and Computer Science seminar, Koerth-Baker focused on the history of the development of the electric power grid, and the lessons it can teach about how progress is made.
“I like this story because I think it’s part of a problem we have with the way we talk about innovation,” Koerth-Baker said. “We like to tell ourselves these narratives about one guy who comes up with one really good idea that changes the entire world. But in reality, there’s usually a lot of failure involved in that process, and there’s usually a lot more people.”
Koerth-Baker told the story of how the electric grid has evolved from its first failed implementation in Appleton, Wis., to the system we have now. According to Koerth-Baker, the changes involved work on a large scale from many people: electric companies that pushed to find and market new ways to use electricity, scientists who made breakthroughs in technology, and politicians who implemented the grid.
However, she said that as a result of the patchwork way in which the grid was built, it also has systemic problems that hurt its sustainability. “It was optimized to go up quickly. It was optimized to be cheap. And, as the engineers know, that leaves the third leg, which is actually working well,” she said.
Koerth-Baker said that although there are small things people can do to increase efficiency in their daily lives, the U.S. will only really become more energy-efficient when the system is changed to make efficiency easy. She pointed to local power generation, increased power storage in the electric grid, and “smart grids” that monitor customers’ energy usage as potential large-scale changes that could have positive effects on the sustainability of the electrical system.
“Energy is not just about the sources that we use,” she said. “It’s about the systems that we use those sources in. And until we change those systems, there’s really only so many changes we can make to the sources.”
Audience questions mainly focused on practical ways researchers and others can help to implement systemic changes. People asked questions ranging from how the public image of smart grids might hurt their usage to how aware and knowledgeable Congress and the White House are about energy problems.
Koerth-Baker said that systemic changes could be difficult to implement, especially considering the average politician’s technological literacy. “Politicians know what your grandma knows,” she said. She gave advice on teaching about science and advocated making science students write more throughout their education to improve communications between laypeople and the scientific world.
“I think scientists can really benefit from blogging,” Koerth-Baker said. “It’s an opportunity to learn to write better about science and communicate with an audience.” 
Koerth-Baker said that the internet has increased the amount of contact people have with science, and that since science blogging became popular, the average person’s scientific knowledge has increased.
Philip Lehman, the associate dean for strategic initiatives in Carnegie Mellon’s School of Computer Science, said that consciousness of sustainability is part of the point of the seminar. “This is part of our series on sustainability in computer science. Sometimes the connection is very tight, sometimes it’s less so. I think all of us want to raise consciousness about what’s going on in the sustainability world in computer science, where we are,” Lehman said.
Audience members agreed that the lecture was informative. “I think she did a good job of explaining how things came about, and where the infrastructure came from, and the different perspectives people have — how the utility companies think, how the government and how the users view the grid,” said computer science Ph.D. student Timothy Zhu.
Before the Lights Go Out, Koerth-Baker’s book about the history of the development of the electric grid and the lessons that can be taken from it, was released last Tuesday.

CMU students participate in  video chat laptop orchestra
A laptop orchestra at Carnegie Mellon will participate in a concert with six other universities in the United States and United Kingdom via the internet on April 16. Carnegie Mellon computer science, music, and art professor Roger Dannenberg will direct the multi-city collaboration from Louisiana State University. The orchestra is part of the first ever Symposium on Laptop Ensembles and Orchestras.
The other laptop orchestras involved in the performance will perform from Baton Rouge; Stanford University; Texas A&M University; the University of Colorado; the University of Huddersfield in West Yorkshire, England; and Queen’s University in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Each orchestra will be able to hear and respond to the others’ performances through audio and visual links.
“The speed of light is a limitation for us, so I won’t be able to control the beat,” Dannenberg said in a university press release. “But I can give cues for the orchestras to play with different textures or sounds.” Acoustic soloists will also accompany the laptops at each performance location.
Carnegie Mellon’s performance, which will include about 18 students, will take place in the University Center’s McConomy Auditorium at 8:30 p.m. and is open to the public.
Astrobotic unveils design of new lunar rover Polaris
The Robotics Institute spin-off Astrobotic Technology, which was founded by robotics professor William “Red” Whittaker, has announced a new name, design, and mission for its lunar rover. The new rover, called Polaris, will mine for potentially rich deposits of ice, methane, and other natural resources found at the moon’s north pole.
Astrobotic is building Polaris with the hopes of winning Google’s Lunar X Prize, which will award over $20 million to a privately funded company that can land and operate a robot on the moon by December 2015. According to a recent article published in Scientific American, Astrobotic is currently one of the front-runners in the contest.
The company’s new mission is to have Polaris launch atop a rocket from Cape Canaveral, Fla., in late October 2015. The rover’s new design would focus on exploring the moon’s pole, which was never explored by any of the Apollo expeditions. After landing on the moon’s surface, Polaris will spend the next 12 days looking for ice, and will be equipped with drills to take samples of the ice.
Polaris, which can carry up to 175 pounds of payload, was adapted from a lunar excavation machine that Astrobotic prototyped in 2010.

President Barack Obama’s comments at a press conference last Monday regarding the recent Supreme Court arguments about Obamacare are ridiculous. Calling it “unprecedented and extraordinary” that the Supreme Court should overturn “a law that was passed by a strong majority of a democratically elected congress” is absurd and antithetical to the Supreme Court’s purpose and authority as well as the long revered tradition of judicial review.
For those not familiar with judicial review, it was established in 1803 in the landmark case Marbury v. Madison in which Chief Justice John Marshall first declared a law unconstitutional. Marshall outlined that “it is emphatically the province and duty of the Judicial Department to say what the law is.” In other words, it is the job of the Supreme Court to decide whether laws that congress passes comply with our Constitution.
Although not explicitly stated in the Constitution, judicial review can be interpreted from Article III and Article VI, which give the Supreme Court last word on legal disputes and bind all judicial officers to uphold the Constitution, respectively. As the Constitution is the supreme law of the United States, the Supreme Court has ultimate authority to judge the constitutionality of any law that Congress passes.
Accordingly, in the 209 years since Marbury v. Madison, the Supreme Court has been well respected as the ultimate authority on all constitutional and legal cases regardless of their outcome, overturning hundreds of democratically passed laws and statutes at both the federal and state levels. For our president, a former professor of constitutional law, to say that it would be “unprecedented and extraordinary” to overturn Obamacare is so far from reality that he should be ashamed of himself.
Obama is a smart guy. He knows that it would be precedented and ordinary to overturn Obamacare even if it was passed with a “strong majority of a democratically elected congress” — in reality, it barely squeaked by on a rushed and partisan vote. 
I’ve heard theories on his motive for saying something so blatantly false — that he’s pre-empting a negative decision and starting a campaign against the court or trying to misinform uneducated voters — but regardless, he’s wrong.
After three days of oral arguments about Obamacare, the law appears to be in jeopardy. CNN analyst Jeffrey Toobin called the oral arguments a “trainwreck for the Obama administration.” 
Several justices — including John Roberts and Anthony Kennedy, who are seen as the two swing votes in the case — posed tough challenges to the law. They asked several times for Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr., who is charged with defending the law, to come up with a limiting principle for the government should Obamacare be declared constitutional.
Under the interstate commerce clause, expanded in Wickard v. Filburn in 1942, the government can regulate not just interstate commerce but also all local commerce that affects interstate commerce. In other words, Congress can regulate all commerce. 
But what Congress doesn’t have the power to do is create commerce in order to regulate it, as Roberts pointed out in the second day of oral arguments.
This is exactly what the mandate does. I think Obamacare is unconstitutional and, though by a narrow 5–4 margin, I think the Supreme Court will recognize that if this law stands, the federal government would emerge virtually limitless. 
The danger of this was best stated by former President Gerald Ford, who said to a joint session of Congress, “a government big enough to give you everything you need is big enough to take everything you have.”

It is difficult to write an opinion piece about the recent bomb threats at the University of Pittsburgh, because the perpetrator has given us no discernible reason for the bomb threats. His or her incoherent action gives this editorial board nothing to argue for or against, damaging not only our sense of security, but also general public discourse at a place where it should be most celebrated.
Although Pitt is treating the bomb threats as terrorist acts, the anonymity of the threats shares much in common with road rage and internet flame wars on chat rooms. Without a clue as to motive or purpose, the bomb threats are not statements, but only inarticulate expressions of aggression. Why is this person mad? We don’t know. Who is this person? We don’t know. What does he or she want? We don’t know. Is it possible to sympathize with or address him or her? Not at all.
This silence is baffling, unfortunate, and counterproductive. While road rage and flame wars are typically acts of passion, the meticulous planning and execution of any one of the recent bomb threats could only have been done with a cool head and a clear and compelling reason in the perpetrator’s mind. Even if the threats are just pleas for attention, it would benefit both the perpetrator and the public to know, and be able to respond to, his or her reasons.
It is a shame that these bomb threats had to happen in one of the most prominent university towns in our nation, a place where we, among other things, endeavor to channel natural aggression and passion into argument and discourse. The bomb threats not only frighten students and professors away from interacting with each other on campus, but their success at provoking reactions and remaining anonymous popularize and encourage others to use bomb threats as outlets for aggression over other, more articulate, forms of communication.

Two weeks ago, four students voiced an opinion in The Tartan on a then-student government candidate, and while the responses it received were varied, one thread throughout them was that Carnegie Mellon’s student government is a do-nothing, no-power joke. It is worthless and the candidates should not be vetted for their past performance.
One commenter could not believe students would write such a letter about a candidate “over something so insignificant as student government.”
Regardless of your opinion of that letter or The Tartan’s continued publication of individuals’ opinions (such as my own, here), as an over-involved member of the student body, once leader of this publication, and once President of the Graduate Student Assembly (GSA), I want to explore the idea that our student government is a joke.
The elections board operated for weeks with a chair who, due to his role as student government’s Applications Engineer, was constitutionally ineligible to be the elections board chair. The board had technical issues at the launch of the election: The election opened early, some groups of students were unable to vote online for unknown reasons, and the election was listed as closed hours before it actually ended, described privately as “purely an aesthetic bug.” If a sign was hung at the door to a polling place stating that the election was closed, but the door was unlocked and people could still enter and vote, it would be declared voter fraud, not a bug.
During the impeachment hearing, the standing Vice President for Organizations declared the constitution a guideline and stated that he, the current Vice President for Finance, and the current president routinely do not follow the rules written in the constitution. This passed without shocking any representatives, and although the president admitted he had not wholly fulfilled his constitutional duties, he was not impeached.
The standing GSA president lied to his representatives and the Undergraduate Student Senate about having quorum at the impeachment hearing. He was emailed with the required number of representatives, which were not present at the meeting. When this was raised, he again affirmed he had quorum. Student government’s advisers were informed that GSA did not have quorum and did nothing. The vote was conducted (illegitimately) before I finally raised this issue loudly enough that it was recognized and then confirmed by student government’s constitutional adviser. GSA’s president likely lied not so that Jake Flittner would not be impeached — he knew the impeachment would fail; he lied so that it would appear that GSA representatives were showing up to important meetings.
Finally, a whopping 5.7 percent of the entire student body came out to vote in support of the winning student body president and vice president-elect. The student body elected to office the fifth Student Senate executive committee member in a row. For the role of Vice President of Finance, the student body elected the Student Senator who launched the failed impeachment campaign and who ran on a platform of raising the activities fee by 20 percent, which shamefully ignores whole swaths of the student population (graduate students and students in Qatar). There are nearly 900 people who voted but didn’t check the box for the only candidate running for that position.
This is the state of student government. The constitutional rules are seen as merely guidance. The leaders have been under threat of impeachment or actually have been impeached. The elections were rife with technical glitches, and yet they are in much better shape than recent years. 
Most importantly, students seem to not care about any of this. One graduate student on Facebook wrote, “Isn’t this whole thing just for undergrads in humanities to feel important for a few years?” And maybe it is. Maybe student government has been so dysfunctional for the past three or so years that an entire generation of Carnegie Mellon students see it as a token role, as a popularity contest that allows a few students to further stuff their résumés and sit in meetings voicing opinions without ever accomplishing anything.
While I don’t actually believe this, it seems the percentage of this campus that does is still startlingly high. It remains on the shoulders of our newly elected leaders to vehemently fight this attitude and apathy. 
Will, Meela, Jon, and Alyssa: Your most important role for the next year is not to raise the activities fee or recognize new student groups more quickly, and it is not to lobby in Harrisburg or restructure the Board of Directors. It is to make an actual and lasting impact on every single student at Carnegie Mellon, by communicating quickly, and broadly every success and failure that you have as our leaders.

Launched in 2012, Hunter Moore’s website Is Anyone Up has come to be known as a “revenge porn site” where ex-lovers and hackers can post people’s private nude pictures.
But it does not stop there. As the site’s administrator, Moore hosts the photos along with the victims’ full names and screenshots linking to their Twitter, MySpace, or Facebook profiles. And this is all legal. 
Because Moore is not directly submitting the photos, he is protected under the Communications Decency Act, which protects website owners from legal liability for the content their users post. Meanwhile, he is making upwards of $13,000 in advertising revenue per month. 
The only likely way the site could be taken down is if some brave victim sued Moore for generating defamatory content or for promoting privacy invasion and intentionally inflicting emotional distress. 
But no one wants his or her name and accompanying nude pictures in the media spotlight. 
An even bigger issue is the precedent this type of court case would set. 
If someone sued Moore and he won, his depraved business model would be validated legally. If he lost, freedom of speech online would suffer more restrictions. 
This creates a difficult situation, but one that must be addressed and solved for the sake of all parties involved. 
Re-evaluation and reform of current online privacy policies are absolutely necessary.
Legislators should establish policies that protect both freedom of speech online and individuals’ privacy on the internet. While the protection of free speech is instrumental to the continued use of the internet as an invaluable communication tool, measures must be implemented to stop “entrepreneurs” like Moore from profiting off the ruination of others.

Social media is evolving faster than our legal systems can keep up. Users are concerned about what future employers could see, and now most have their Facebook pages almost completely blocked for anyone but their friends.
Even this isn’t enough, however, as some employers are now demanding their employees’ Facebook passwords. The most recent example of this is the firing of a teacher’s aide in Michigan for refusing to give a school administrator her password. These demands, and any repercussions stemming from employees not agreeing to such draconian terms, violate a basic right to privacy and ignore any sort of due process.
Employees who stand up for their privacy rights can face serious consequences. The teacher’s aide was terminated after refusing to give her Facebook password to a school administrator after a parent complained about a humorous photo posted over a year ago. The photo was completely innocuous, with the photo being a “picture of a co-worker’s pants around her ankles and a pair of shoes, with the caption ‘Thinking of you,’  ” according to the local TV station, WSBT. While this joke may have been of a more adult nature, the teacher’s aide posted this photo on her own time, on a private computer.
The aide was well within her rights to not give the school administration her password. The school decided that without seeing the photo, they were forced to assume the worst and thus terminated her. This ruling dismisses the basic premise of innocent until proven guilty. Dismissals on grounds as weak as this create a terrible precedent that would allow employers to terminate employees for no rhyme or reason.
When two users become Facebook friends, there is an implicit understanding that only the user will be signed in under the corresponding account, and thus only the user has the ability to see their private posts and photos. The instant an employer logs into their employee’s account, he or she has breached the privacy of not only that employee, but also every one of the employee’s friends. If this practice becomes commonplace, the entire point of having “friends only” posts becomes moot. While I staunchly advocate that users only post statuses and photos they are comfortable with the whole internet seeing, there should still be some expectation of privacy from complete strangers. Facebook has publicly come out against this practice of “shoulder surfing” and echoes the sentiment that this is an egregious violation of privacy for both the employee and her friends. Many states are also pondering legislation to prohibit such practices due to violation of privacy rights.
Privacy is a right that we as individuals expect, but is hard to keep and maintain. Our only hope for keeping our private lives private is to stop these sorts of practices early, and to continue to fight for our right to keep our work and personal lives as separate as possible.

Committing rape is deplorable, but perpetuating the act — even if indirectly — is just as unforgivable. Some college administrations across the country are guilty of covering up sexual harassment cases among their student bodies, because they believe public knowledge of the acts would damage their reputations.
Boston University has become known for its problems with rape, due to multiple instances in which the university only responded to reports of sexual assault once they became public. In 2010, a suicide at  the University of Notre Dame led the civil rights office of the Department of Education to launch an investigation of the student’s rape without waiting for a formal complaint — the first in at least 30 years, according to the National Catholic Reporter.
These reactionary measures and late responses to sexual assaults on campuses fail to help anyone. According to the nonprofit organization Security on Campus, there has been no significant change in the percentage of women sexually assaulted in college (20–25) over at least 30 years. Today, 62 percent of college students surveyed by the American Association of University Women say that they have been sexually harassed.
The parallels to the Sandusky scandal are glaringly obvious. In all these instances of sexual assault and harassment in a collegiate setting, there is a common thread: The reputation of the university is the first priority.
In the end, the truth regarding campus sexual assaults gets out more often than not — and a university that covers up its scandals looks infinitely worse than one that responds to them quickly.
The entire purpose of the university is to be a community site that encourages free thought and growth; the reputation-first mentality of many universities only serves to undermine this purpose.

The release of Bully, a documentary following four families dealing with bullying problems in American public school systems, has come with controversy surrounding initial rumors of an R-rating by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA).
The movie has been the most recent addition to the slew of anti-bullying activism occurring within the United States.
The intimate nature of the film — one of the families in the documentary lost a child to suicide as a result of bullying — lends it startling emotional power, and is something that legislation, news reports, and assemblies lack.
Over 500,000 people signed a petition on change.org  for the MPAA to change the rating from R to PG–13 to allow more school children to have accessibility to the film in theaters. The petition was successful, resulting in the MPAA changing the rating to PG–13.
As a result, there will undoubtedly be some form of legislation proposed to combat the undeniable bullying problem that exists in American school systems. While it’s good that awareness about bullying is being raised, reactive legislation is not the appropriate venue for action.
No matter how well intentioned reactionary legislation is, it is often plagued by the fact that it is an instinctive, rash reaction to an event or incident.
For example, after Casey Anthony was tried for the murder of her daughter, Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey passed a piece of legislation known as Caylee’s Law that makes it a felony for a parent or guardian not to report a child missing within 24 hours.
While the intention is to prevent another mess like Anthony’s trial, the legislation is very spotty and was clearly passed rashly. There are no specifications as to when the 24 hour period starts, or how to decide who would be held responsible during instances where there are other parties involved, such as a babysitter.
Another reactionary piece of New Jersey legislation that has been questionably executed is Kyleigh’s Law, which requires any teen driver with a learner’s permit to put small removable decals on their car to identify themselves as teen drivers so that police officers would be able to identify law breakers more easily.
The nature of the law, however, also makes it easy for anyone to identify the age of the driver.
In addition, if a teenager shared a car with his or her parents, the decals would have to be applied every time the teen wanted to drive the car.
In the worst case scenario, this type of legislation can be used to enable bullying.
One California school’s decision to have any student reported for bullying attend a mandatory meeting with the principal saw bullies reporting their own victims as bullies to further dissuade them from seeking help.
Instead of focusing on proposing new legislation to prevent bullying, lawmakers could focus on preventing legislation that actively enables bullying, such as provisions in Tennessee and Michigan that make bullying on faith-based conviction acceptable. Legislation such as this and the intolerant extremist ideologies that fuel it is abhorrent and antithetical to the American ideals of secular government and equality for all.

Dalek: “We have already conquered Earth!”
The Doctor: “Conquered the Earth? You poor, pathetic creatures, don’t you realize? Before you attempt to conquer the Earth, you will have to destroy all living matter!”
The Doctor: “You’ve only got one life. You’ll age here in The TARDIS and then die. Me, I shall go on regenerating until all my lives are spent.”
The Doctor: “That’s right, yes, you’re going. You’ve gone for ages, you’ve already gone, you’re still here, just arrived, haven’t even met you yet. It all depends on who you are and how you look at it. Strange business, time.”
The Doctor: “Dastari, you have more letters after your name than anyone else I know — enough for two alphabets. How is it that you can be such a stupid, stubborn, irrational, and thoroughly objectionable old idiot?”
Cassandra: “That’s disgusting. What’s wrong with him?”
The Doctor: “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.”
The Doctor: “It’s times like this I wish I still had my scarf.”
The Master: “Nobody could be more devoted to the cause of peace than I! As a commissioner of Earth’s Interplanetary Police, I have devoted my life to the cause of law and order, and law and order can only exist in a time of peace.”
The Doctor: “I give you the choice. A choice. Leave this planet or I’ll stop you.”
The Doctor: “Stupid expression, ‘stands to reason.’ Why isn’t it ‘lie down to reason?’ Much easier to reason lying down.”
Bracewell: “I must protest!”
The Doctor: “You want dominion over the living, yet all you do is kill.”
The Master: “Life is wasted on the living!”
Idris: “Me. Are you going to steal me? You have stolen me. You are stealing me. Oh! Tenses are difficult, aren’t they?”
