The Carnegie Mellon women’s basketball team spent the weekend traveling to face two University Athletic Association (UAA) opponents, the Washington University in St. Louis Bears and the University of Chicago Maroons, in St. Louis and Chicago, respectively.
The Tartans squared off against the No. 8 Bears first on Friday. Carnegie Mellon slowed down the ball to begin the game, forcing the Bears out of their comfort zone. The Bears only managed to score eight points within the first six minutes, while the Tartans were able to put four points of their own on the scoreboard. However, the Bears then took the momentum of the game with 14 unanswered points to take a 22–4 lead.
First-year Alexis Zambino proved to be a great asset to the Tartans as she made a three-pointer to try to gain the momentum back in the first half. However, the Tartans were only able to scrape together two more baskets and a free throw, finishing the period down 31–12.
Carnegie Mellon tried to make a comeback in the second period. Zambino continued to make her presence known with six points, and sophomore Brit Phillips added nine Tartan points to the board in the period.
Overall, the Tartans saw great performances from Phillips, who led the team with 11 points, and Zambino, who finished a close second with nine points.
In the end Carnegie Mellon came up short, as the Bears outshot the Tartans 35.6 percent to 30.6 percent from the floor and 73.9 percent to 41.7 percent from behind the arc. The game ended with a final score of 61–39 in favor of the Bears.
“Wash. U. is a very good team in the UAA,” said sophmore Emily Peel. “We played extremely hard against them. We are looking forward to our game against Chicago, and will be able to rematch them [Wash. U.] next week at home.”
The loss moved the Tartans’ record to 2–15 and 0–6 in UAA play. The Tartans then traveled to Chicago to play the Maroons on Sunday. Look for the results of the 2 p.m. game in the online edition of The Tartan.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team played three in-conference road games this week.
On Jan. 23, the Tartans went to Atlanta to play the Emory University Eagles. The Tartans commanded the start of the game after going on an early 9–0 run. They shot 70 percent out of the gate.
The Eagles then quickly made a run of their own, eventually tying the game at 21 with eight minutes left in the half. Soon after, they took their first lead against the Tartans on an “and one” by Eagle Alex Greven. At halftime the score was 45–36, as the Tartans’ hot shooting cooled off to 29 percent for the rest of the half.
Emory came out re-energized after the break and went on a 10–0 run to start the second half. The Eagles were up by as many as 21, hitting their biggest lead at a score of 61–40.
The Tartans would make a 17–6 run, chipping away at the score to find themselves only down 10.
Senior Matthew Pettit scored six points during the Tartans’ run, but Carnegie Mellon would not come within fewer than nine points in the 88–71 loss. Pettit led the Tartans’ offense with 19 points, senior Shane Rife had 14 points, and first-year Christian Manoli added 10.
Despite their fast start, the Tartans shot just 37 percent from the floor, marking another sub-40 percent night for them. This has been a theme in the Tartans’ games recently: When the Tartans shoot above 40 percent, they are 4–6, but they are just 1–5 in games where they shoot under 40 percent from the field.
On Friday, the Tartans traveled to face the Washington University in St. Louis Bears in a competitive matchup.
The Bears controlled the first couple minutes of the game before the Tartans, led by Pettit, went on a 13–7 run to take an early 13–12 lead. The Bears’ Caleb Knepper then hit back-to-back three-pointers to put his team back in the lead by five.
The two teams traded baskets, but the Bears never surrendered the lead. The Bears’ interior defense was resilient, blocking six shots in the first half.
The Bears opened the second half with a 9–0 run, but the Tartans rebutted with a seven-point turnaround consisting of four points by first-year Sean Brophy. Then, with 4:54 left in the game, first-year Rashaun Riley rebounded and Pettit blocked and coasted for a fast-break layup to bring the Tartans within two.
“We were down by a lot in the second half, but managed to fight back despite the crowd’s noise,” Brophy said.
In the final three minutes, the Bears locked down the Tartans on defense and secured the 70–62 victory. Manoli led the Tartans with 18 points, and Pettit added 11 points with three blocks.
The Tartans faced the University of Chicago this past Sunday.

This past Saturday, the Carnegie Mellon track and field team traveled to Cleveland, Ohio, to compete against Case Western Reserve University.
The men’s team came home with another victory under its belt, beating the Spartans with a final score of 80–47. The women’s team did not fare as well, losing to Case with a final score of 79–47.
The men dominated on the field, winning a total of five events. Junior Essien Ohues kicked the meet off with a first-place finish in the high jump, clearing 1.8 meters. Ohues went on to win the triple jump as well with a distance of 12.66 meters. Junior Ryan Kissel won the long jump, leaping 6.44 meters. He also took second place at 12.55 meters in the triple jump. In the shot put, first-year Zachary Erra-Hernandez took first place, throwing a distance of 13.75 meters. Sophomore Dan Cardenas Rivero rounded out the field victories for the men, placing first in the pole vault by reaching a height of 3.96 meters.
The women’s team had several standout performances on the field. Junior Lisa Marion Garcia won the pole vault, clearing 2.43 meters, while senior Melissa Hwang and junior Ivana Moses scored second and third in the long jump, clearing distances of 4.94 and 4.79 meters, respectively.
Over on the track, senior Nate Bussiere won the 800-meter run with a time of 1:56.91. First-year Tim Kikta took first place in the 200-meter dash, finishing in 23.49. Senior J.P. Allera and sophomore Evan Gates went 1–2 in the 5,000-meter run, just beating out Case Western Reserve’s top finisher with times of 15:20.77 and 15:21.50, respectively.
The 4x100-meter relay earned the Tartan men their final win of the meet. The relay team, composed of sophomore Ben Nealy and seniors John Briguglio, Bussiere, and Dustin Musselman, finished in 3:28.82.
On the women’s side, first-year Jacqueline Guevel won the 55-meter hurdles with a time of 8.71. Guevel went on to win the 55-meter dash as well, finishing in 7.52 seconds. Junior Luci Laffitte won the 400-meter dash with a time of 1:03.58, while senior Laura McKee won the 800-meter run in 2:23.05.
Look out for the Tartans as they take on Mount Union College on Saturday, Feb. 5.

Whether a person is liked or disliked will often come down to the words that come out of his or her mouth. Ballplayers can usually get away with mouthing off as long as they can back it up on the field. Executives, agents, and the like have a little tougher time with that; they have to hope that the players they represent will back up their words for them. 
Last week, both executives and players kept their mouths running just long enough to let both their feet fit comfortably inside.
Strangely, the player whose words proved most controversial last week was newly minted Cardinal Lance Berkman. Berkman, widely viewed as one of baseball’s true good guys, managed to make at least one enemy whewn he publicly doubted the Texas Rangers’ chances in 2011. 
“I felt like if they didn’t re-sign Cliff Lee that they were going to be an average team,” Berkman said in a radio interview, “and I feel that’s probably what’s going to end up happening.” Berkman, who was part of a 2010 Yankees team that got mowed down by then-Ranger Lee, was giving his reasons for opting not to sign with Texas this year. “It’s all about your pitching,” he added. “I feel like last year was one of those special years where you kind of catch lightning in a bottle and they got hot and they had some guys that I felt like were pitching better than their talent level, and consequently, they had a great year.”
One of those guys who didn’t so much outpitch his talent level as he did expectations was C.J. Wilson, who publicly took issue with Berkman’s comments — and rightfully so. Berkman’s foot was already feeling snug inside his mouth when he said of his new team, “If there’s a better team in the National League, I don’t know who they are. On paper, you can talk about the Phillies, and obviously they have a great pitching staff.” 
Obviously, indeed; after all, the Phillies were the team who signed Lee, and if it is indeed all about pitching as Berkman said, the Phillies are rolling in it. 
Considering that Lee, the alleged make-or-break for Texas’ chances as a contender, joined a rotation that included Roy Halladay and Roy Oswalt, no team in either league seemingly stands a chance against the Phillies — even the Cardinals.
Perhaps Berkman was just being honest, but honest or not, he did not sound knowledgeable. It now remains up to him and his team to back up his words — and if the Cardinals do prove to be the best in the NL, a potential showdown with Texas in the World Series would certainly settle the score.
Joining in the verbal throwdown was the Yankees’ President Randy Levine, whose comments coincidentally were also directed at the Rangers and related to Lee. Levine was responding to new Rangers owner Chuck Greenberg’s comments that the Rangers’ pursuit of Lee had deterred the pitcher from signing with the Yanks. In an article on ESPN.com, Levine first criticized Greenberg for believing “he’s mastered what everyone else is thinking” — which was acceptable and justified. It was what Levine continued on to say that should’ve been more of a keep-it-to-yourselfer. “I’ll be impressed when he demonstrates he can keep the Rangers off welfare,” Levine said in the article. “What I mean is make them not be a revenue-sharing recipient for three years in a row, without taking financing from baseball or advance money from television networks — then I’ll be impressed.”
Regardless of the Rangers’ money situation, the point of owning a baseball team is not how it manages its finances — just ask Pirates fans. 
The point is to maintain success on the field for years to come, and the real test of Greenberg’s ability to run his organization will be how the Rangers play in 2011 and beyond. The Yankees, who lost to Texas in the 2010 postseason, have much more to prove: They have to show that, with their plethora of monetary resources, they can actually keep making the postseason again and putting a good — not just talented and expensive — group of teammates on the baseball field. It was the late George Steinbrenner who made the Yankees infamous with his marathon mouth; most of the time, his team backed him up. It’s up to George’s successors to back up their own words now.
The Spring Training countdown is now at 14 days. Until then, players and executives alike are well-advised to stay silent and wait until their bats, gloves, and arms can do the talking for them.

Well, we’ve all seen this before, haven’t we? The Pittsburgh Steelers are in the Super Bowl once again, shooting for their NFL-record seventh Vince Lombardi Trophy against the NFC representative, the Green Bay Packers. Throughout the playoffs, we’ve seen heated divisional rivalries, rematches from regular season games, and tons of top quarterbacks make early playoff exits. It only fits that two of the most storied franchises in the history of the NFL will take the field in Dallas, Texas to play in Super Bowl XLV in front of what is projected to be the largest crowd in Super Bowl history. This is the best time of the year for a Pittsburgh sports fan, but will the Steelers come through for a seventh time and start a mass riot on Feb. 6.
It’s been a trying season for both of the teams in the Super Bowl, but the Green Bay Packers may have had to deal with the most adversity since starting their season back in September. Green Bay currently has 15 players on injured reserve, including one of their longest-tenured players, linebacker Nick Barnett, and their top tight-end, Jermichael Finley, who was regarded as possibly the Packers’ best receiver. In addition to this, third-year QB Aaron Rodgers has suffered two concussions already this year, causing him to miss at least one full game and parts of others. Not to mention their star running back Ryan Grant went down in the first game of the season, leaving the Pack with a non-existent running game all season. Despite all these injuries, the Packers fought their way into the playoffs, winning two must-win games against winning teams in weeks 16 and 17 to just make the playoffs as the sixth seed.
So, how do these teams match up? Pittsburgh, always known for its defense, will have its work cut out with the Rodgers-led offense. Green Bay comes in with three proven wide receivers in Greg Jennings, James Jones, and Donald Driver — not to mention fourth receiver Jordy Nelson, who is no slouch at the position, either. 
However, it’s not all about the receivers, but more about Rodgers. Despite struggling a little last week against the Chicago Bears, not many of us can forget his game against the Atlanta Falcons, where he completed 89 percent of his passes en route to putting up 48 points on the NFC’s one seed. The Steelers will need to load up on defensive backs this game, especially with all the weapons that Rodgers has at his disposal. Expect Rodgers to attack nickel-back William Gay all day, as he will most likely be covering Jones or Driver, which bodes well for the Packers. 
Fortunately for the Steelers, safety Troy Polamalu and starting cornerback Bryant McFadden look like they are going to play, allowing the Steelers to play the defense that they love. Polamalu’s health is always an X-factor, considering he hasn’t been healthy all through the playoffs, and it has definitely shown. Troy missed two key tackles in the divisional round against the Ravens, and wasn’t much of an impact against the Jets just last week. If he can have a typical Troy game, he might make the game-changing play that we’ve been accustomed to. Although the Packers won’t be able to run the ball against the Steelers, I still fully expect them to put up 20 points at least, considering their strength in passing matches up with the defense’s weakness.
On the other side of the ball, the Steelers will need to step up in order to keep up with the Packers’ offense. Green Bay features a deadly pass-rush, led by potential Defensive Player of the Year Clay Matthews, who was in the top five in the league with 14 sacks on the season. That’s not to mention big nose tackle B.J. Raji, who actually returned a touchdown last week against the Bears. However, I think the Steelers offense will be able to handle the pass-rush, as their offensive line has been playing amazingly throughout the playoffs. The Packers will most certainly try to take away the run and get their pass-rush in good situations to bring Ben down. We all know that Big Ben is at his best when he’s on the run and out of the pocket, and if he can make a few big plays on the run or scrambling, this Super Bowl will be highly contested, for sure. 
However, if the Packers are able to contain him and not allow him to extend plays, it will allow for their excellent secondary to stick with the Steelers’ receivers, possibly forcing Ben into some interceptions. I am not encouraged by Big Ben’s game last week against the Jets, in which he put up a sub-50 passer rating, definitely getting outplayed by his second-year counterpart Mark Sanchez in a close victory. He did come through in the clutch, as usual, as he is known to be the best clutch quarterback in the game today. This weekend, he’ll need to play better, because the game will most likely be on the offense’s shoulders to win it.
That being said, I expect a very competitive Super Bowl, but not a defensive struggle like some experts seem to think it will be. Playing in a dome, the conditions will be perfect, which bodes well for both offenses. As the teams go back and forth, I think the better team comes out victorious in the end — the Green Bay Packers, by a score of 27–17. I know all of Pittsburgh hopes I’m wrong, and I can’t wait until next week.

This week marked the opening of perhaps the biggest league of the year for intramural sports — basketball. With 52 men’s teams, seven women’s teams, and 10 co-rec teams, there are around 500 people participating this year.
The league is split into three main divisions: men’s, women’s, and co-rec (co-ed). The men’s division is further split between “competitive” play, which is similar to last year’s majors division, and “recreational,” which is similar to last year’s minors.
One modification for the co-rec divisions from last year concerns the scoring. Whereas men gain the usual two points for a field goal and three for a three-pointer, women earn three points for a field goal and four points for a three-pointer, so many games may see women earning twice as many points as the men do.
For all leagues, rules are becoming more aligned with college rules as opposed to high school rules. Along with that, scores and time are now displayed on the actual scoreboards.
Divisional play will conwtinue late into February and will be followed by playoffs.
If basketball is not your sport, check out squash and badminton, which start this week. Everyone who reaches the playoffs will earn points toward the All-Sports Championship, and those who win in their respective leagues will not only earn bonus points towards the championship, but will also win IM Champions T-shirts. The current leaders for the All-Sports Championships are Pi Kappa Alpha for the men’s division (267 points), Kappa Alpha Theta for women (174), and the Hoopers for co-rec teams (142).

The brain has been one big question mark throughout human history. Thousands of years have been spent studying the brain — how it grows, how it changes throughout one’s life, how it regulates one’s every action. Today, with such advanced forms of technology as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), we are still trying to answer some of the most basic and important questions about the brain. Relative to the scale of human history, these brain-studying techniques are fairly new, and scientists are beginning to uncover some very intriguing facts about our brains and how they work. Recently, a few Carnegie Mellon researchers came together to discuss how both their work and our knowledge about the brain are improving.
On Jan. 20, four of Carnegie Mellon’s most prominent brain researchers held an interactive-panel discussion, allowing anyone to listen in and ask questions. Assessing the questions of the human brain requires a holistic approach that spans several different departments. As such, the panel seminar titled “How to Build a Better Brain” featured input from Michael Tarr and Marcel Just from the department of psychology, Nathan Urban of the department of biological sciences, and Justine Cassell, head of the Human-Computer Interaction Institute.
“Carnegie Mellon is one of the premier universities in the world in terms of the research that is currently taking place at the frontier of understanding how the mind and the brain work, understanding how we learn, and understanding the nature ... of various types of mental and physical illnesses and conditions,” explained University Provost and Executive Vice President Mark Kamlet, who introduced and moderated the panel discussion.
As part of the panel, Just discussed his innovative ways of using functional MRI (fMRI) to constrain the neural basis of how we think. fMRI allows one to observe brain activity as it is happening, and this real-time study tool has allowed Just to study which parts of the brain are activated when people think about certain things. In a CBS report in 2009, Just explained that his group is able to use fMRI to see the intensity and location of neurons resulting from a person thinking about a certain object. Using information from fMRI, he can correctly predict what a person is thinking given two thought possibilities. His research has essentially started paving the way toward reading people’s minds.
Understanding how we can recognize certain objects and people’s faces has been one of the foci of Tarr’s research. During the discussion, he explained how there is a pea-sized part of our brains that is highly responsive to human faces — more responsive than any other part of the brain. Interestingly, that same part of the brain shows similar activation for various types of recognition — from avid bird watchers who are familiar with a vast number of different species to car enthusiasts who can identify the make and model of different kinds of cars.
As the head of the department of biological sciences, Urban brought a more biology-based view of brain functioning to the discussion. Recognized as one of the nation’s top 50 science and technology innovators by Scientific American magazine, he studies the computational properties of the human brain on a molecular level. During the panel discussion, he talked about how humans can change their brains’ “white matter,” which is the section of the brain that makes up the connections between all of the major parts. For example, the white matter of a pianist who has practiced for over 1,000 hours is different from a non-pianist’s. When talking about students under his advisement, Urban commented on their ability to formulate good experiments and think outside of the box. “Some of the best experimentalists are the ones who have been trained in music,” he said.
Lastly, the research of Cassell, director of the Human-Computer Interaction Institute, seemed to bring all of these ideas together with her focus on interactions between humans and other humans, as well as humans and computers. Cassell commented on the growing trend of text messaging among peers, saying, “Technology is not created out of a vacuum, but out of our own social imperatives. If it’s not texting, it’s going to be something else. This fills our need.” All four of the panelists agreed that a computer will never replace human interaction, though at the very least, it may be able to help children with various social problems such as autism.
Overall, the panel discussion was able to bring to light many important issues regarding brain research from a plethora of angles. Researchers are gradually erasing the uncertainty in the age-old question of how the brain works and how technology will affect us as we advance to the future.

For most people walking by Resnik House on Jan. 28, it might have been just another ordinary day. However, last Friday marked the 25th anniversary of the space shuttle Challenger explosion, where Carnegie Mellon alumna Judith Resnik was one of the seven astronauts who lost their lives. Resnik, in addition to being the second American woman in space, received a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from Carnegie Mellon.
The Challenger explosion is unforgettable for those who witnessed it. Joy and excitement turned into fear and sadness in the space of a few seconds for all those who lived through that event. Humans were reminded that their technologies are not infallible and that accidents can happen even in the most controlled and precise environments. NASA let a schoolteacher on board and arranged for a live broadcast for schoolchildren around the country. 
However, just 73 seconds into the flight, spectators watched as the shuttle burst into pieces that trailed white smoke.
How could such an accident have happened? The shuttle had only been created four years prior to the accident, so the technology was not outdated. An investigation following the incident revealed that a small “O-ring” seal had failed in the right solid-fuel tank on the Shuttle. The cold weather leading up to the launch had made problems in the faulty ring worse, and hot gases were able to leak through the seal. The problem worsened as more gases and flames leaked through the failed seal, until the fire caused the liquid fuel tanks to ignite. The force of this ignition tore Challenger apart, killing the entire crew. 
Following the accident, people looked for answers. The Reagan administration was anxious to provide them, and the ensuing investigation revealed truths about NASA’s process. The public learned that NASA engineers had voiced misgivings about the mission, but the officials at NASA had not paid proper attention to these complaints. “There certainly was a very big push at the time to talk about having more open communications so people weren’t afraid to go up the chain and push the management if they needed to,” said Tom Ludwinski, a scientist who worked on the Challenger. 
The space shuttle program was halted until the investigation was finished and the government had evidence that measures had been taken to make space flight safer for all involved. The budget for NASA was increased from $15.5 billion to almost $21 billion so that the organization would have enough money to fix problems. This was important because America did not want to lose funding for the space shuttle program. 
Rosy Ludwinski worked on the Challenger’s thrust structure for the main engine. “Leading-edge programs like this — it’s dangerous. There’s no doubt about it that they’re doing things that are on the cutting edge, so the astronauts — they know the risks that are involved. And it was an extreme tragedy, but that’s what advances science eventually, and they helped to do that by playing that role,” she said.
As a distinguished alumna of Carnegie Mellon, Resnik continues to inspire the students and professors here to have the courage to chart new frontiers.
Editor's note: Rosy and Tom Ludwinski are the parents of Celia Ludwinski, managing editor of The Tartan.

Both convenient and effective, birth control pills have become the most popular form of contraception used by women in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control, 17 percent of women aged 15 to 29 years currently use some form of birth control pill. WebMD.com states that certain birth control pills can be as much as 99 percent effective in preventing pregnancy. While most other forms of contraception try to prevent the sperm from reaching the egg, birth control pills work from within and create conditions within the body that make it unsuitable for pregnancy.
The female reproductive system is controlled by a set of tightly regulated hormones. Birth control pills essentially work by disrupting this intricate balance of hormones in the body. The two hormones found in birth control pills are estrogen and progestin. Estrogen is normally produced in females, as is progesterone, which is a less concentrated natural form of progestin. As explained on WebMD.com, estrogen normally helps in the release of eggs from the ovary in females. This allows the egg to travel further through the reproductive tract, where it may eventually intercept a sperm. 
The body also has a system of keeping the estrogen secretion in check. Estrogen secretion is regulated by what is called a negative feedback loop. Large amounts of estrogen have a negative effect on its secretion and eventually cause the body to stop secreting estrogen. Progesterone is secreted later in the reproductive cycle and prepares the uterus for pregnancy. One of its major functions is to cause the thickening of the uterine lining, thus allowing the embryo to be implanted in the uterus wall for pregnancy. Like estrogen, progesterone is also regulated by a negative feedback loop and prevents its own secretion after a while.
Birth control pills make use of the fact that both estrogen and progesterone are regulated by negative feedback loops. By adding an excess amount of estrogen and progesterone in the body, birth control pills activate the negative-feedback loop and prevent the body from secreting estrogen and progesterone. Lack of estrogen production prevents the release of an egg from the ovary, and lack of progesterone causes the lining of the uterus to become thin and unsuitable for pregnancy.
As explained on MayoClinic.com, such pills generally fall into two categories: combination birth control pills and mini pills. Combination pills contain a mixture of estrogen and progestin, while mini pills contain only progestin. Since they contain both estrogen and progestin, combination pills prevent the release of eggs from the ovary and also make the uterus unsuitable for pregnancy. Hence, combination pills tend to be more effective and are a more popular option. However, excess estrogen can have a number of side effects on the body, which make combination pills unsuitable for some women. Most importantly, excess estrogen can cause blood clots to form. Hence, combination pills have the added risk of causing stroke and heart disease.
Mini pills are therefore recommended for those with pre-existing conditions like high blood pressure or those with a history of being susceptible to blood clots. However, since these pills contain only progestin, periodic release of eggs happens normally. Thus, when using mini pills there is a higher chance of unwanted pregnancies.
Both types of pills, however, carry the risks of causing headaches, cysts in the ovary, irregular menstrual patterns, and mood swings. The pills also do not protect against sexually transmitted diseases, and other forms of protection have to be used in order to prevent the spread of such diseases.
Until recently it was believed that contraceptive pills caused weight gain in women. However, according to a recent study published in the journal Human Reproduction, contraceptive pills do not cause women to gain weight.

Scientists identify pneumonia bacterium
Scientists from seven countries are analyzing how the Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria, responsible for pneumonia and other illnesses, has evolved since it was first identified in Spain in 1984. This worldwide bacterium has traversed all seven continents and has since mutated three-quarters of its DNA. This research will help scientists replace outdated vaccines.

Study isolates gene in mice related to aggression
Using a process called imprinting, scientists have determined that the Grb10 gene in mice is related to aggressive behavior. When the gene is dormant, the affected mice are more prone to confrontations and biting off the fur and whiskers of other mice. The Grb10 gene is also found in human DNA and could be linked to social interactions.

Malaysian government fights mosquito problem
The Malaysian government ran an experiment last December where it released 6,000 genetically modified mosquitoes into the forest to help fight the spread of dengue fever. The mosquitoes are engineered to produce inferior offspring or none at all. Previous experiments run in 2006 in the Cayman Islands have proven to be successful.

Egypt cuts off Internet, cell phone service amid riots
In light of recent protests and riots, the Egyptian government shut down its Internet and mobile phone networks last Tuesday night. This was an effort to stop the flow of riot footage from being uploaded to sites such as YouTube and Facebook. As of last Saturday, only 7 percent of connections were online across the country, mostly from government or stock market firms.

Writing about feelings improves test scores
A new psychology study by researchers at the University of Chicago has found that writing about feelings of anxiety or nervousness before a test can improve one’s score. Students who spent 10 minutes writing about their problems scored an average 5 percent higher than students who wrote about a different topic or nothing at all.

Scientists discover new dinosaur
A dog-sized dinosaur named Eodromaeus murphi has been discovered near the Andes Mountains in Argentina. The fossils are approximately 230 million years old and are estimated to be the ancestors of dinosaurs such as the Tyrannosaurus rex. Scientists think the Eodromaeus was an omnivore that walked on two legs, could run up to 20 miles per hour and weighed between 10 and 15 pounds.

One undeniable fact: Our world consumes around 85 million barrels of oil a day. Most of our power comes from energy that is generated using oil — cars and airplanes need fuel, while electronics need electricity that is usually generated from oil sources. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, in 2009 the United States used 18,771,000 barrels of petroleum per day.
Petroleum, or crude oil, exists beneath the Earth’s surface. It is composed of the decayed remains of microscopic creatures that lived millions of years ago. Crude oil is a liquid mixture of hydrocarbons, which are chemical compounds that consist of hydrogen and carbon in varying amounts. By drilling through the earth, this petroleum can be extracted and refined for further use. As of Jan. 28, 2011, there were 1,732 oil rigs in the United States.
The first step of getting energy from oil is finding a plentiful source. Geologists use a variety of equipment to locate oil reserves. According to www.howstuffworks.com, they may sample surface rocks and use satellite images to find evidence of oil reserves. In addition, flowing oil produces a magnetic field that can also be measured. The smell of hydrocarbons can also be detected using sensitive detectors.
To begin drilling, workers dig a hole in the ground and insert a pipe into the hole. The pipe is fitted with a drill bit and drill string. The drill bit is responsible for cutting through rock; the drill string places weight on the drill bit and connects it to the rest of the oil rig, which is above ground. In the next step, electric motors cause the drill string, and ultimately the drill bit, to rotate and drill a well downward. 
Mud — in terms of oil drilling — is a mixture of water, clay, and other chemicals. It is circulated through the pipe that contains the drill bit and drill string in order to clear out the rock that has been cut away. The entire circulatory system of the oil rig uses pumps to clear the rock from the pipe, and then sieves to clear the rock from the mud so the mud may be reused. At certain depths, cement is used to reinforce the newly dug well so that it does not collapse.
To begin extracting oil from the ground, acid may be used to dissolve the earth around the oil deposit, causing it to flow into the well. Other safety equipment is used to prevent a dangerous blowout, which may be a familiar scene from movies that show oil gushing from the ground. Next, the digging assembly must be removed before oil can be pumped from the ground. The pump used — like the drill — is powered by an electric motor that moves a polishing rod up and down in the well. This creates a suction that draws oil up from the reservoir. Steam may also be used to create pressure underneath the oil that will help push it upward.
Offshore drilling requires different drilling equipment to remove oil. Mobile offshore drilling units (MODUs) are deployed after an oil deposit is located. The are four major types of MODUs: submersible MODUs, jackups, drill ships, and semi-submersibles. Submersible MODUs are barges that are designed to rest on the surface of the ocean floor while supporting a drilling rig with posts. Jackups are also barges with drilling rigs, except these barges float on the water and extend legs downward to the sea floor. Once the legs contact the sea floor, the jackup is raised so the drilling rig is safe in rough waters. 
Drill ships are used in deeper waters and are ships that contain drilling rigs in the hull. They are kept stationary with the help of anchors. Semi-submersibles are gigantic air-filled structures that float on the water.
While there are many options to extract oil from the earth, constant drilling will one day deplete the Earth’s reserves. However, our dependence on this black gold will continue indefinitely.

Perhaps your New Year’s resolution — to go to the gym every day, or to spend less time on Facebook — hasn’t been going as well as you hoped. Well, luckily, there is another new year approaching to give you the chance to renew your resolutions. This year, the Chinese New Year takes place on Thursday, Feb. 3.
The date for the Chinese New Year varies each year, as it is determined by the Chinese lunisolar calendar, rather than the Western world’s Gregorian calendar. The Chinese New Year, sometimes referred to as the Lunar New Year, usually occurs on the second new moon after the winter solstice. This upcoming year will be the Year of the Rabbit, which occurs every 12 years. People born in the Year of the Rabbit are said to be artistic, gracious, lucky, and soft-spoken.
The Chinese New Year is not exclusively a Chinese celebration; it is also celebrated in many other Asian countries, including Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. In Vietnam, the Year of the Rabbit is translated as the Year of the Cat, due to the similarity between the Chinese symbol for rabbit and the Vietnamese word for cat.
According to Chinese legend, the first Chinese New Year celebration came about as a result of a small village’s attempt to rid itself of a mythical beast called Nien. Nien would come to the village the first day of every year and terrorize the village by devouring their livestock, crops, and children. One year, the villagers noticed that a little child wearing red had scared Nien away; they realized that the beast was afraid of the color red. Therefore, the following New Year, they hung red paper lanterns all around the village and put red spring scrolls on the doors and windows. They also lit firecrackers, with hopes that the noise would further scare the beast. From that year on, the villagers never saw Nien again.
The Chinese New Year has a host of traditional practices, such as giving the younger generation red envelopes containing money. Wearing red is a common practice, as is setting off fireworks. Dragon and lion dances are also common; the aggressive faces of either animal, performed to the deafening sounds of symbols, are intended to ward off evil spirits.
There is a large Chinese community present on Carnegie Mellon’s campus; last school year, 600 graduate and undergraduate students were citizens of China, according to Carnegie Mellon’s 2009–10 Factbook. Carnegie Mellon’s Chinese Students and Scholars Association (CSSA) is one organization designed to help to these international students. “[The organization] helps new students start their lives in Pittsburgh, build a better community for Chinese students and scholars and contribute as a multicultural student organization at Carnegie Mellon,” according to the association’s website.
Awareness of Roots in Chinese Culture (ARCC) is another student organization geared toward students of Chinese heritage; it hosts events throughout the school year designed to promote Chinese culture in the larger university community. One of its upcoming events is “One Night in Beijing,” an evening filled with Chinese cultural performances and Asian food. For those interested in emceeing the event, ARCC will hold auditions this Saturday at noon. In addition, groups interested in performing at the event should email  Allison Ko (asko@) by Feb. 7.
Chinese New Year at Carnegie Mellon
Given the size of Carnegie Mellon’s Chinese community, it should not come as a surprise that there are multiple events happening on campus in order to celebrate the Chinese New Year. This past Saturday, ARCC hosted a dinner with authentic Chinese dishes in honor of the holiday. “50 or 60 people were there.... They had a lot of good food and served us a lot of authentic dishes. Last year they had a lot of different performances before the dinner,” Cindy Wang, a junior in the Tepper School of Business, said.
The Chinese Studies program is also hosting a celebration of the new year this Friday at 5 p.m. in Porter Hall. The event will include Chinese food, a talent show, calligraphy demonstration and practice, Chinese games, and karaoke.
In addition, the Lunar Gala, named in honor of the Chinese Lunar New Year, traditionally takes place on the weekend of the Chinese New Year and begins with a celebration of Chinese culture. Last year, the gala began with three dances performed by members of the Oriental Star Dance School and displayed paper lanterns and served Chinese dumplings as a nod to Chinese culture.
Chinese New Year in Pittsburgh
Although Pittsburgh might not be the first city that comes to mind when one thinks of globalization and diversity, Pittsburgh in fact has a vibrant Chinese community. According to GlobalPittsburgh.org, waves of Chinese immigrants have been coming to Pittsburgh since the 1960s to settle down and study. The Pittsburgh Chapter of the Organization of Chinese Americans (OCA-Pittsburgh) promotes Chinese culture throughout Pittsburgh and organizes groups such as the OCA Youth Performance Ensemble, which is a teenaged ensemble that performs Chinese dances and other Chinese folk arts.
OCA-Pittsburgh is hosting a banquet in honor of the new year on Feb. 17 at the Syria Shriners Center in Cheswick. The banquet, which has been an annual event since the 1980s, will include a lion dance from the OCA Youth Performance Ensemble, an Indian Bollywood Dance, and a Japanese Taiko drum performance.
Closer to Carnegie Mellon’s campus, the University of Pittsburgh’s Chinese American Student Association and the Vietnamese Student Association are hosting a new year’s celebration featuring games, a fashion show, and Chinese and Vietnamese food.
If you would rather celebrate the new year on your own time, there are plenty of Asian restaurants scattered about Pittsburgh. On Craig Street alone, there are multiple Chinese restaurants. Orient Express is right next to Starbucks on the corner of Forbes Avenue and Craig Street. Lulu’s Noodles is beloved for its bubble tea, but further up the street there is also Little Asia, where the food is inexpensive and more authentic than the other two restaurants.
In Shadyside there is China Palace, where one can get a large variety of high-quality food at a reasonable price. If you can afford a slightly higher price range, try going to Soba, a more modern restaurant in Shadyside. Through Feb. 3, the restaurant is offering a special Chinese New Year menu that includes a four-course meal for $35.
For Asian food that isn’t necessarily Chinese, the Rose Tea Cafe in Squirrel Hill serves authentic Taiwanese and Thai food, in addition to bubble tea, all at a reasonable price.
Whether you are of Chinese heritage, have an interest in Chinese culture, or are merely looking for an excuse to indulge in some delicious Chinese food, the upcoming Chinese New Year is a holiday rich with heritage that provides an opportunity to celebrate the new year once more.

Perhaps in the near future one will come across a literary journal — it will be rather small with a simple design, a physical presence in the reader’s hands. It is “every writer’s little black book,” according to Ines Pujos and Marci Calabretta, creators of the Print Oriented Bastards, an edgy, new literary journal that will be released sometime soon.
The inspiration for creating a journal first came one evening while junior Pujos and senior Calabretta, two creative writing students at Carnegie Mellon, were doing their homework together — but instead of completing their homework, Pujos and Calabretta began to daydream of starting a creative literary journal for fiction, poetry, and art. Their journal, they claimed, would become a publication that would be particularly welcoming to the contributions of unpublished undergraduate and graduate students from across the nation.
The two worked for hours in order to transform their dreams into a reality. “We weren’t sure where to begin,” Pujos recalled, remembering their very first attempts while starting the Print Oriented Bastards. “We were a little overwhelmed — how do we get submissions?”
“It was more difficult than we thought with the financial aspect,” Pujos admitted — they had to apply for the Dow Grant, which specifically provides funds for literary publications. The two also began to learn and understand the process of starting a literary publication. They attended the Pittsburgh Small Press Festival a few weeks after deciding to create their literary journal, where they encountered several local literary publications with different styles and ideas, allowing them to gain greater insight into the literary world.
Currently, the two are reading through all of the online submissions that they have received at printorientedbastards.wordpress.com. “We’re looking for anyone who is a good writer,” Calabretta said when speaking of the journal’s style. 
The two creators are searching for high quality and originality — pieces that display “brilliant technique,” according to Pujos. “We want the journal itself to be a stylistic statement of emerging artists,” Calabretta said. The two upperclassmen are also planning on making the Print Oriented Bastards an official literary publication after their first issue is published, hoping to register as a formal, biannual literary review.
Although it has sometimes been difficult for them to both study in school and make preparations for the Print Oriented Bastards, Calabretta and Pujos have refused to give up on their creation. They have been working hard at proofreading the numerous and varying submissions that they have received. Calabretta will be graduating this spring, but that does not deter the two from continuing to work together. They hope that they will still be able to work as a team even after their years at Carnegie Mellon, maybe even turning the Print Oriented Bastards into a long-term project. Perhaps one day their journal will be available in New York or San Francisco, rather than just at Carnegie Mellon.

Just weeks after last year’s Lunar Gala, while students and spectators were still reminiscing about the memorable fashion show, Ian Coleman, a junior in H&SS, and Eddie Wong, a 5th-year architecture student, were already beginning their jobs as executive producers for this year’s spectacle. This year’s theme? “_Mélange_.” The French word for mixture is a perfect representation of how this year’s show will evolve in fashion, structure, and meaning. In previous years, designers’ lines have been restricted in creativity by the themes. “_Mélange_ allows the designers to do whatever they wanted,” Coleman, a junior in H&SS, explained.
This year, designers were encouraged to show off a little, to demonstrate their strongest talents. The designers for the show are anything but professionals, although you wouldn’t guess it from their creations. In fact, this year’s event is dominated by 22 student designers, who have a mere 45 student models strutting their work. As in past years, the collections are not limited to either ready-to-wear or couture pieces. True to the title, it’s a blend of styles. “It’s always a mélange,” joked Coleman. It is impossible to say whether or not the lines in the show are a reflection of current fashion trends, such as the minimalism depicted in the Spring 2011 runway collections. The designers this year, however, are likely to be exceptionally innovative, as “they are many different people with different backgrounds and different things that inspire them,” Coleman explained.
The clothing is only one aspect that will be reinvented in this year’s show. The show’s structure has been given new thought as well: The stage itself will be a work of art that goes beyond the typical straight runway. Models will be meticulously emphasized by student-designed lighting, and Coleman and Wong will incorporate student-created artwork.
Lunar Gala will take place Feb. 5 — perfect timing, as the Chinese Lunar New Year is a mere two days prior. Since the Lunar New Year is the namesake of Lunar Gala, the producers have historically opened the event with a traditional celebration of Chinese culture, ranging from classical Chinese dancers to the sweeping and famous Chinese dragon dance. 
This year, Coleman hinted that “attendees will be surprised with a less traditional opening” that will remain respectful of Chinese culture, yet take Lunar Gala in a surpring and refreshing direction in order to separate this year’s spectacle from the 14 prior events.
For now, rest assured that the show, as Coleman promised, will “be much more up close and personal this year,” in a way that will bridge the gap between audience and model, and in a way that will bring a love and admiration for fashion to all those who plan to attend.
For those who wish to witness the new future of Carnegie Mellon in the fashion world, tickets went on sale this past Friday, and representatives from Lunar Gala will be selling these tickets in the University Center all this week.

What do puppy-sized elephants, Photoshopped pictures of actor Gary Busey, and a YouTube video about the French Revolution all have in common? They were part of award-winning author John Green’s lecture at the Carnegie Library Lecture Hall this past Friday.
Green has written several award-winning young-adult novels, including Looking For Alaska, which received the Michael L. Printz Award, and Paper Towns, which won the Edgar Award in 2009 for best young-adult novel. His most recent novel is Will Grayson, Will Grayson, which he co-wrote with fellow young-adult novelist David Leviathan. In addition to his novels, Green also co-hosts the “vlogbrothers” YouTube channel with his younger brother, Hank Green. Their YouTube channel, which they have been running since 2007, has attained an enthusiastic following of over 400,000 subscribers.
This dedicated fan base was evident at Green’s lecture, which had over 500 attendees. His lecture was preceded by a local band, who played songs inspired by Green and his YouTube channel. After a brief introduction by author Siobhan Vivian — a Pittsburgh author whose most recent novel, Not That Kind Of Girl, came out this past September — Green came out and was promptly greeted by screaming fans. He seemed in awe of the size of the crowd, admitting several times throughout the lecture that he had never spoken in front of such a large crowd before.
Green began his lecture with a picture of his one-year-old son, Henry, and discussed how his son seems to think himself the only person on Earth, while all other people are merely “robots programmed to attend his every need.” Green then used this as a segue into a discussion about the importance of empathy.
He also celebrated the community that has grown from his YouTube channel, which has viewers referred to as “Nerdfighters,” a self-proclaimed community of nerds that works to decrease negativity in the world. “Nerdfighters raised over $100,000 in 48 hours during our annual charity project this year,” Green said. “Together we built pond-sand filters in Bangladesh and delivered planes full of medical supplies to Haiti. We read novels together and build wikis, Wookies, designed T-shirts together, and — as you saw earlier this evening — wrote songs together.”
“Conversations with Nerdfighters also shape the actual videos that I make,” Green said, before showing a video he made about the French Revolution; the video had been inspired by a conversation Green had with a YouTube viewer about the consequences of violent revolutions. He then discussed the connectivity that results from the immediacy of an Internet community. “At this point I find it almost strange to use the word ‘stranger’ in any context,” he admitted. As an example of the collaborative community on the Internet, he showed several Photoshopped pictures of actor Gary Busey, using them as evidence that, by building off of other people’s work, communities are able to create something beautiful.
After taking questions from the audience, Green closed the lecture by showing his appreciation for the audience, saying, “Thank you for being such a big part of my life, and, as always, don’t forget to be awesome.”

After taking a hiatus from touring and performing to work on its music, alternative rock band Hawthorne Heights emerges victorious as it hits the road once again to tour and promote its newest album, Skeletons, the band’s debut on label Wind-up Records.
Skeletons is both a sign of the band’s maturity as well as its devotion to music. “It’s the longest period of time we’ve had to actually sit back and make a record,” frontman JT Woodruff said of his band’s latest work. “It’s more about giving you time once you write a song to sit back, listen to it, and dissect the song over and over.” He laughed. “We tended to over-think every single part.”
The band’s determination to get everything right shows in its music. The songs on Skeletons remain true to Hawthorne Heights’ style, but they also show a polish and maturity. The musicians’ drive to produce the best music possible is not only a sign of their dedication to artistic excellence, but also a testament to their friendship: As a band, Hawthorne Heights has been through a lot, most notably the death of guitarist Casey Calvert in 2007, later followed by issues with the group’s original label, Victory Records. However, most impressive is that even after all that, Hawthorne Heights continues to make great music.
For Skeletons, the band’s perfectionism is especially evident. The group started out with over 30 potential songs and then only chose the very best to include on its album. “End of the Underground” was one that the band was pretty happy with from the start, but others took more work. In particular, “Here I Am” was the most difficult to get right: “It was the biggest pain,” Woordruff noted. “We just kept changing the bridge.”
“The hardest thing we have to do really is not kill each other’s ideas, but help them along. A song sounds totally different in your head,” he said, explaining that the band members come up with ideas on their own but come together to work on songs as a group. “It’s not always easy, but it’s fun.”
Not being pressured to turn out an album in a limited amount of time made writing Skeletons a different experience than their other records. “Tons of time at least helped us know that there was nothing more that we could do to a song,” Woodruff said.
In addition to expecting the best from themselves in their music, the members of Hawthorne Heights are also trying something completely new on their tour. “This is something we’ve never done — just playing acoustic for an entire tour. Sitting up there with an acoustic guitar just lends itself to a smaller place.” He noted his band will be playing at smaller venues, including Pittsburgh’s Smiling Moose, rather than larger ones. “It’s more intimate. We try to get out there, put on a great show, and connect with as many people as we can.”
Woodruff hopes that Hawthorne Heights will continue making music for a long time. “We’ve still got a lot of fun to have,” he said. “We’re happy doing what we’re doing, and as long as we’re happy about it, why not keep doing it? It’s being able to do what you love, what you’ve always dreamed about — just playing music for people.”
Hawthorne Heights plays the Smiling Moose on Feb. 1 at 6 p.m. Tickets are $10.

It is 2007, and Joel Lindsey is getting ready to leave London to move to the United States, in part to explore his heritage on his American mother’s side of the family, and in part to simply see what else is out there. Sitting in Heathrow Airport, he pens the lyrics, “It’s time to get out of here, maybe come back a better man.” The lyrics will eventually become the song “Live Outside,” which is the final track in Boulevard of the Allies’ debut CD, The Man in the Photograph, released last May. Boulevard of the Allies will be promoting the CD at a concert at the Underground on Friday.
Currently the lead singer of Boulevard of the Allies, Lindsey made the decision to change his environment and leave London because he wanted to see what else was out there and “live outside” of his comfort zone. During his travels around the country, Lindsey found himself getting caught up in the Pittsburgh music scene. He found Pittsburgh’s musicality to be novel and unlike something one would be able to hear every day. While big cities run the danger of being “swayed by the latest sound,” Lindsey said, he feels that the smaller size of Pittsburgh makes it easier for local bands to cultivate their own sounds and write lyrics that are important to them.
Alongside Lindsey, Boulevard of the Allies is made up of Pittsburgh natives Jim Kurasch on bass, Tim College on drums, James Gaff on electric guitar, and Chris Massa on percussion. Boulevard of the Allies identifies its music as a cross between British rock and American soul. This fusion is heavily influenced by the Beatles and Stevie Wonder, with a folk-like twist. While Lindsay wrote all of the songs for The Man in the Photograph, the band as a whole is contributing more and more to the songwriting process as Boulevard of the Allies continues to grow and evolve.
Lindsey emphasized the viability of Pittsburgh’s music scene. “There are more opportunities than people realize for musicians [in Pittsburgh],” Lindsey said. “They’re not obvious opportunities, but if you take your art [into your] own hands and have the chutzpah to call up bars and restaurants, you can have the chance to play [for] weird and wonderful experiences.... In Pittsburgh, I have the chance to make a living playing music.” From the illustrious Bitter End in New York, the band has also accepted gigs at the penguin habitat at the Pittsburgh Aquarium and outside of a Giant Eagle grocery store.
In addition to being the frontman for Boulevard of the Allies, Lindsey is also the creator of the Acoustic Café, a nonprofit open-mic night for local bands. The Acoustic Café helps new and struggling musicians test out their songs and helps them to become more comfortable with performing. The café has a loyal following, and the artists are able to cultivate a base by playing there live.
Lindsey has big dreams for Boulevard of the Allies. In 2011, besides playing at the Underground this Friday, Lindsey is most excited to travel around Europe with his band to play and promote their music. After living in America for almost four years, he said that he realizes that “Europe doesn’t seem as big anymore.”

I feel that in the past three years or so there has been a panda frenzy. From pistol pandas to golden pandas, many artists’ stage names have embraced the black-and-white image of the adorable and easily-recognizable members of the genus Ursus.
So why pandas? For me, there’s a little too much panda going on. There’s Gold Panda, Hot Panda, Pistol Panda, and The White Panda. I’ll be discussing Gold Panda, but it’s important that we cover The White Panda. As a Carnegie Mellon student, you likely experienced The White Panda early this fall, and your dreams of a great mash-up show were utterly crushed. That show sounded like two white kids wh hd listened to Girl Talk’s Feed The Animals, downloaded Ableton Live, and decided they were going to DJ a party using the music they’d been collecting since middle school.
Sorry, but I want more from my DJs. Partying hard is great and all, but I surely am not going to let my good time fuel some bro’s DJ-rockstar ego trip. Pardon me if it’s too absurd of me to deem seamless transitions as a must while listening and dancing to electro. Those boys from Chicago and L.A. did not provide those transitions. The remixes that they made themselves are actually pretty catchy, but as a show, the boys need a lot of work mastering the mash-up.
Gold Panda, on the other hand, is an outstanding producer. Born Derwin Panda, Gold Panda is an English producer who hails from Chelmsford, Essex. He’s been in the game for quite a short time, only releasing 7" records in 2009, but he’s making a definite splash. His music has a young sound full of texture and splashes of the oriental, with bells galore.
Gold Panda is the way to go. The songs are short enough that the experimentation with samples doesn’t get overbearing, but long enough that they’ll be stuck in your head, making your heart flutter for the rest of the day.

Mystery Team
Thursday, Feb. 3
8 10 12
If you’ve heard of and enjoy the comedy team called Derrick Comedy, you’ll most likely enjoy this movie. The group took time out of its busy schedule shooting short sketches to produce its first feature-length film. The movie joins three members of Derrick Comedy who are about to graduate from high school, but still act like kids when they play detective games with each other. Things get nutty when the trio attempts to prove their child-like behavior was for a good cause as they try to solve a series of murders that hit their small town. Think Scooby Doo meets an SNL Digital Short.
The Social Network
Friday, Feb. 4
7:30 10 12:30
The Social Network is David Fincher’s drama about the creation of Facebook and the origin of the piles of money Mark Zuckerberg has lying around somewhere. Ranked by many as one of the best films of the year and nominated for eight Academy Awards, this movie features an ensemble cast with Justin Timberlake, the new Spiderman Andrew Garfield, and rising star Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg. Critics loved the flick, though some have questioned the light in which it portrayed Zuckerberg. Despite their criticisms, you have to admit, $200 million worldwide isn’t shabby.
Being John Malkovich
Saturday, Feb. 5
7:30 10 12:30
Spike Jonze directs this black comedy about a fictionalized version of John Malkovich. John Cusack and Cameron Diaz also star in this original movie that explores the true nature of consciousness, philosophy, and perception. In the film, Cusack discovers a portal that leads into the mind of Malkovich, then dumps you out onto the New Jersey Turnpike after a minute or two. He starts a business out of it, but things start to go haywire when it is discovered that it may be possible to completely take over Malkovich’s life. Fun fact: Brad Pitt, Hanson, Charlie Sheen, and several other stars make brief cameos.
AB Special Events: Super Bowl
Sunday, Feb. 6
6:30
As a Browns and Jets fan, I’m probably not the best person to write a Super Bowl preview. Thankfully, I’m a nice person. The Activities Board is presenting the Super Bowl this Sunday in McConomy and will be providing some sort of refreshments for you all to enjoy. A giant screen? Check. Free food? Check. Some people’s favorite team playing on the JumboTron? Check. Barring the possibility you might be a Packers fan (good for you), you should need no further reason to attend.

Dear Hoskins Brothers,
Like every Carnegie Mellon student, I have a ton of work, but I also like to go to parties. On weekends when I have a ton of work, I always get peer-pressured into going out. My friends say to me “Hey, what are you doing?” and I just can’t resist going out! How can I say no to peer pressure?
Sincerely,
Easily Convinced
Dear EC,
If you call that peer pressure, then you’re getting off easy. You need to learn to stand up for yourself. Work is most important. You need to take time to relax and enjoy yourself, but not so much that it destroys your grades. 
If you find that having people around distracts you from working, there are a lot of quiet places to work on campus. There’s Hunt and the Engineering and Science Libraries. A lot of classrooms are open after hours and on weekends, and they’re a great place to work. You can attach your laptop to the projector and use the chalkboard for work. 
When the weather gets nicer there’s always a large area of campus to sit and work outside. If you need to work, work. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.
Don’t forget to relax every once in a while,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Hoskins Brothers,
I have this friend who makes girls run away —  as in, physically run away. We started chatting with this girl, introduced ourselves and whatnot, and then she turned and sprinted away. This has happened seven times. How can I help my friend keep girls within a hundred meters of him?
Sincerely,
Lonely With My Friend
Dear Lonely,
You need to sit your friend down and tell him the truth. After that, it’s time for a make-over. Does he bathe regularly? If he’s a CS or ECE major, the answer’s probably no. Buy him some good soap and tell him how to use it if you need to. Does he wear cologne? If so, he needs to stop. If not, he should probably try a little.
Once you have him looking and smelling acceptable, you need to change how he acts. Girls may be running away because he’s a little creepy. Try some role-playing exercises. You be the girl and let him try to seduce you. Stop him when he gets creepy, or when you run away. Keep going until he can manage to have a conversation with someone. Everything after that comes down to luck.
Make sure he puts on  a clean shirt,
Brian Hoskins

100 Years Ago:
Feb. 8, 1911
The “unfamiliar floors” are a possible reason cited to explain why the basketball team went just 2–4 on a recent road trip. Yes, clearly we lost 41–9 to Denison because of the slight difference in hardwood. Or maybe it was the bed of nails they played on. Keep the excuses coming.

The head of the Bureau of Measurement and Guidance offers advice to students studying for finals that begin on Jan. 23. It figures that in olden times, Carnegie Mellon would find a way to make winter break less fun. Finals two weeks after break? What’s wrong with you, 1961?

“Butts cops award” is the title of an announcement that Robert Butts, an All-American offensive tackle on the football team (and large man), is to be honored with a banquet next week. I just think “Carnegie Mellon honors big Butts” is a much better title, don’t you?

The Almanac section mentions that, in 1976, WRCT changed from a progressive rock station to a Top 40 one, which angered some DJs at the station. What change do you think would anger the current DJs at WRCT most, classical or country?

June 13, 2010: Thesis: Dublin is amazing. It’s a good thing I’m on a limited student visa; otherwise I would be tempted to never leave. It’s a very small city — only 1 million people (a quarter of Ireland’s total population), and its geography reflects that. I’ve heard that it’s possible to bike from one end to the other in about an hour. As such, the “sites” are very condensed, and there is a “one of each” aspect to the city that makes touring pretty simple: There is one castle in the city, one historic prison, one picturesque university campus, one river, one Guinness factory, and only a handful of major museums. There is no shortage of things to see and explore, however, as the real Ireland (as far as I can tell) exists in the places that you’ll find on every block: the pubs, the shops, and the houses. But mostly the pubs.
Much of what I’ve seen and heard so far can be traced back, in some way, to pub life. My introduction to the city was the following story, which a cab driver from the airport told me as an explanation of the many different colors of doors on the Georgian buildings:
“Once there was a man who got very drunk. He came home through the wrong door, to the wrong house, and got into the wrong bed with the wrong woman. It gave him quite a shock! So, he went and painted all the doors different colors so it would never happen again.”
June 14, 2010: It’s a fascinating time to be a foreigner in Ireland. Apart from the World Cup — the focus of my weekend — it’s a time of great political turmoil here: The recession has hit Ireland as hard, if not harder, than it has the United States. There are entire ghost towns of new houses that were never bought. On top of that is the wretched business with the Catholic Church and the cover-up of pedophilia in Irish parishes; according to my literature professor, there has been an incredible amount of cultural backlash, wherein people are questioning the very way the Church is run and in doing so, discovering the critiques made by feminists for decades.
June 23, 2010: The Dingle Peninsula in County Kerry is the most beautiful place I’ve ever been to.
IES, the study abroad program I’m with, organized the trip. We took an early morning train on Friday from Dublin to Killarney, and the entire time I kept humming the lullaby my grandmother used to sing: “way down in Killarney, many years ago...”
The countryside was lovely: weeds and heather, pitched hills on either side of the tracks, strange towering bushes full of Queen Anne’s Lace, chestnut horses curled in a field. Bushes were so full they looked windswept (and probably were); green fields were iced with yellow flowers that looked like pollen scattered on the grass. That archetypal Irish patchwork of green was everywhere, even on the mountains as they rose up toward the sky. I must have fallen asleep for a bit, because I opened my eyes and the first thing I saw was the mountain range rolling out of the mist: periwinkle, rounded, but massive.
In Killarney, we took a boat ride to Ross Castle, dating back to the 1100s. The entire place was built with defense as its primary purpose, because anyone who was lucky enough to live there had plenty that could be stolen or otherwise pillaged. The doors were dual-planked with spikes on the outer sides; the central spiral staircase had “stumbling stairs” of different heights so that invading soldiers would trip while running up them. Even those who owned the castle in modern times did strange things to maintain control over it at the lowest cost: The phenomenon of roofless castles in Ireland came about because in the mid-1800s, any property with a roof was taxed. Land owners removed the roofs of castles they weren’t living in but wanted to retain.
We also visited the Blasket Islands. They are a collection of abandoned islands off the coast of the Dingle Peninsula, where living conditions were so harsh, and the population was so dwindled as a result, that the government evacuated them in 1953. It was a perfect example of the no-guardrails Irish approach to tourism: the term “abandoned island” really did apply. I found the odd shovel rusting in the fields, along with a small herd of wild donkeys (including a baby donkey that tried to eat my jeans) and sheep. I did some really amazing hiking there.
Our tour guide pointed out something called a “liss,” or a ring-fort in the earth. It’s essentially a circle of raised ground, from which faeries are supposed to come and go — it’s the entrance to the underworld. Faerie lore is considerably darker here than in America. In earlier times people believed that faeries came for young mothers and their babies shortly after a birth. They would bring the children into their underworld, and leave exact replicas of them in their place. These “changelings” were sickly and devilish and would waste away. It’s an explanation for cancer, postpartum depression, and a variety of other illnesses. In response to the changeling fear, people used to take turns guarding mothers and their newborns for a certain period of time after a birth. Later in life, faeries were also held responsible for children who vanished, or children who were killed in accidents on farms.
July 2, 2010: This weekend I went down to County Cork and kissed the Blarney stone. I couldn’t come all the way to Ireland and not kiss the Blarney stone! It’s something I can tick off my bucket list. It was actually a little scary to do. The stone is nestled into a part of the castle wall that’s separated from the floor, quite a few stories up. It’s like walking on a very high veranda with a beautiful view, and then lying down on the edge of that veranda to reach an outer wall with your mouth. There’s a man whose entire job is to sit on the edge and hold onto people so that they don’t fall. I almost didn’t do it, actually, because of the height; you lie on your back to kiss the stone (probably so that you can’t see all that’s below you), but you can see all the way down as you’re watching your friends do it.

Randy Pausch was used as a lightning rod last week to raise awareness about cancer and funds for the American Cancer Society (ACS) at Carnegie Mellon. The Colleges Against Cancer chapter hosted a Late Night last Saturday themed “Remembering Randy” where the group held a screening of Pausch’s Last Lecture in anticipation of February, which is Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month.
After the clip, professor Dave Malehorn of the University of Pittsburgh spoke about how Pausch was the inspiration for one of his projects. Pausch’s Last Lecture provided the foundation on which Malehorn created his new cancer fundraiser; the message that “you just have to decide whether you are a Tigger or an Eeyore” is literally what Malehorn implemented.
His goal was to use adult-sized Tigger and Eeyore costumes to inspire people to have fun, let loose, and look a little silly while raising money for cancer research in honor of Pausch’s memory. 
That is indeed what happened last Saturday when members of Colleges Against Cancer donned the costumes and asked for donations for the ACS around the University Center. Within 10 minutes, the Tigger and Eeyore students returned, having raised almost $30 from sympathetic and amused students around the building.
The costumes were also offered up to anyone walking by as a way to get more people involved and thinking about Pausch and cancer.
Malehorn willingly lends out his “mobile fundraising station” to cancer awareness causes, such as this Remembering Randy event and Carnegie Mellon’s Relay for Life event that happens annually in October. 
The Tigger and Eeyore suits first made their debuts on campus in the 2008 Relay for Life; students and faculty could donate to the ACS in exchange for wearing the costume while walking the track. 
Senior professional writing major Lindsey Fu, who was president of Carnegie Mellon’s Colleges Against Cancer for last year’s Relay for Life event, reflected that “it’s funny how simply putting on a big Tigger suit can transform your mood and make you want to bounce around and have a good time.”
Malehorn hopes to extend the use of these costumes as a fundraiser to the corporate arena. He envisions members of an office “voting” via donations on either the Tigger or the Eeyore costume throughout a given week. The motivation for the office members’ votes would come from the culmination of the week, when the votes for each costume will be counted and the winning costume will be donned by the office supervisor or boss for a day.
In the meantime, Fu and other members of Colleges Against Cancer will continue working as the collegiate arm of the ACS.
They will focus on four different areas of raising awareness and funds: cancer education, survivorship, advocacy, and Relay for Life.
Their Relay for Life kickoff is scheduled for the end of March so participants can begin fundraising over the summer in preparation for the fall relay, where the Tigger and Eeyore suits will likely make another appearance.
Pausch’s message in his Last Lecture became famous and widespread, but Malehorn said, people should not limit themselves to “just their childhood dreams,” but rather try to achieve all their dreams and continue to try new things, whether that is simply to dress up as Tigger or to leave a nation-wide legacy.

The Pittsburgh Entertainment Technology Project launched last Thursday, Jan. 27, with the goal of connecting Hollywood movie producers with local Pittsburgh technology companies. The joint project is a collaboration among the Entertainment Technology Center (ETC), the Pittsburgh Technology Council, the Pittsburgh Film Office, and the Idea Foundry. 
The launch was attended by tech companies, developers, and some filmmakers. Don Marinelli, professor of drama and arts management at Carnegie Mellon and one of the co-founders of the ETC, hosted the event in collaboration with Audrey Russo, president and CEO of the Pittsburgh Technology Council.
Pittsburgh has been a popular filming location for almost a century. According to the Pittsburgh Film Office, Pittsburgh has been the location for more than 101 motion pictures and television productions, ranging from The Perils of Pauline in 1914 to Abduction, which is set to be released in September.
“[There are] myriad locations that can double for practically all areas of the country, a very skilled work force that is enjoyable to work with, and the statewide tax credits for filmmakers who spend 60 percent of their film budget in state,” Marinelli said.
More recently, entertainment technology, which is the use of technologies to enhance and sometimes create new forms of entertainment, has emerged as a new and growing industry in the region.
Although mostly thought of in the context of gaming, Marinelli stressed in his opening that entertainment technology also has much broader, albeit untapped, applications in other fields.
“Southwestern Pennsylvania has become the home to myriad companies engaged directly or tangentially within the industries of entertainment technology,” Marinelli said. “Yet, there has to date been no cohesive listing or understanding of what these myriad companies have to offer.”
To further entertainment technology’s integration into other fields and formalize its benefits, the Pittsburgh Entertainment Technology Project will take advantage of the conditions in Pittsburgh that have made it popular among filmmakers to showcase applications of entertainment technology as they relate to the movie industry.
“It’s something this region is rich in,” Russo said, as quoted in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. “You see a lot of companies that have amazing expertise in pre- and post-production that is tied to the film industry.” It’s a relatively novel concept that, while impressive, faces an uphill challenge of proving its profitability to the much older and established film industry.
“Working with Pittsburgh companies engaged in entertainment technology needs to make financial sense for Hollywood producers,” Marinelli said. “Hopefully, we can augment and expand the advantage of shooting a film in Pittsburgh to include the synergy of making the video game, creating the online virtual world, crafting podcasts and unique advertising initiatives, all in this one location, and at a competitive advantage.”
It might sound confusing, but fortunately, the launch featured several examples of this synergy.
Tracy Brown (ETC ’09), founder and CEO of Evil Genius Designs, gave the audience firsthand experience of the benefits of entertainment technology when she invited the audience to play one of her company’s “Get In Line” games. Her games are designed for people waiting in line and allow the players to play together with their cell phones on a large shared screen.
Brown announced that these games will soon debut in some movie theaters and will appear alongside trailers.
“Imagine being able to play not just with everyone in the theater, but everyone in the world who is watching this movie,” Brown exclaimed. “The evil genius part is ... that we’ve been using you to gather market analytics and data.”
To encourage similar projects, Marinelli and Russo announced that the Pittsburgh Entertainment Technology Project will now be accepting entries for the 2011 Pittsburgh-to-Hollywood Awards. Entrants will submit entertainment technology-related products that could potentially be integrated into the film industry. The winners will receive a trip to Los Angeles to pitch their ideas to members of the industry.
Marinelli also stressed that in this emerging field, there are plenty of opportunities for even undergraduates to get involved: “There is an ever-present, ongoing need for technical expertise, primarily programmers. I do not know of a single company where, if a programmer walked in and volunteered, that individual wouldn’t be hugged, kissed, and fawned over.”

Every year, several Carnegie Mellon students join Goldman Sachs as interns and full-time employees. The company is a global financial services firm that specializes in investment banking, securities, and investment management. As part of its continued efforts to recruit students, the company hosted a leadership panel discussion in Rangos Hall last Wednesday.
Julie Harris, managing director of the company, moderated the discussion. On the panel were vice presidents Gregory Thompson and Lauren Day, associate Lizzy Schulzinger, and analysts Sharon Somuah and Brad Yankiver. The audience consisted of 35 members of the Carnegie Mellon community, including a diverse group of undergraduates.
The panel focused on providing a more expansive definition of leadership, especially in the context of the corporate environment. The discussion, titled “Leadership and the Transition from University to the Working World,” was intended to aid students facing the transition from the university environment to the corporate world.
Sponsored by the Office of Student Activities, the event showed how the skills gained from leadership roles on campus can carry over into a work atmosphere and give transitioning students an edge.
The Goldman Sachs panelists shared their experiences and insight through an interactive discussion. They addressed important topics ranging from how their leadership experiences in the academic world played a role in their job search to choosing a company to how they continued to develop their leadership skills in the workplace.
Yankiver, a Carnegie Mellon alumnus (HSS ’07), served in a number of leadership roles during his undergraduate career. He was a community adviser, publisher for The Tartan, teaching assistant, and member of the University Discipline Committee.
“There are different ways to display leadership. And it has a lot to do with the ability to be comfortable when you step outside your comfort zone,” he said.
Yankiver’s personal experiences from his roles in the Carnegie Mellon community helped build the skills he needed to be a leader in his job at Goldman Sachs, he said. He exemplified the goal of the discussion by connecting his experiences as an undergraduate to his new responsibilities in the corporate sector.
“Meaningful leadership is a learning curve — it is about adapting the things that you learn in school and applying them to something you are passionate about,” Somuah said in response to Yankiver’s point.
Like Somuah, all of the speakers stressed the importance of passion in any leadership position. “The most important thing in a leader is the passion. And this should shine through in the desire to do more and more without being asked for it,” Thompson said. Day added that “if there is something you are passionate about, take the lead and then see where it takes you.” 
Finally, the audience got a taste of the benefits of being a leader in one’s professional career. Day reminded those present that “leadership helps you make those friends and get those opportunities that are advantageous later on.”
“While your impact can be regional or global, leadership skills will keep you up-to-date on foundational business principles,” Harris added.
The audience responded positively to the advice and insight from experienced professionals at Goldman Sachs. The panel was open to any individual questions the audience had in response to the panel’s speeches.
Kevin Williams, a junior civil and environmental engineering major, came to the event because he wanted to learn more about the industry perspective on leadership.
“Often students hear about leadership in an academic environment, but here I was happy to get a corporate viewpoint. I was surprised to hear that leadership was not just about being in charge of something, but about being an active part of a team — making sure you contribute by adapting and applying your skills,” Williams said.
Avantika Goel, a junior business administration major, was happy to see that she “had the opportunity to interact with professionals in the financial services industry.” She summarized the event by saying that after she graduates, she “would love to be back one day as the member of a similar panel.”

Upperclassman panelists shared their personal experiences on topics ranging from forming relationships with professors and making the most of internship experiences to balancing school and fun at the “What I Wish I Had Known When I Was a Freshman” seminar last Thursday.
The informal discussion centered on the stories of four successful upperclassmen. 
The goal of the discussion was to find out what they learned during their time at Carnegie Mellon and how they handled their respective first years of college. The panelists were Elizabeth Bahati Mutisya, a senior business administration major; Nicole Rappin, a senior self-defined music history and cross-cultural communications major; Marianne Pan, a sophomore biological sciences major; and Lei Fan, a junior electrical and computer engineering major.
The event was part of a series of “Study Skills” workshops that provide help throughout the semester and focus on selected study strategies.
The underclassman attendees participated in the discussion by asking questions about the panelists’ experiences, and sometimes even answering the questions of others.
The panel talked openly about issues that affect the ways that students allocate their time, such as “Is it more important to go to the office hours of my TA or my professor?” and “Is it hard to balance the demands of Greek life with school?”
“You are going to have to make decisions you don’t want to make,” Mutisya said, “but you need to have fun.”
Students were also encouraged to persist in making the most of their experiences at Carnegie Mellon, especially when it came to finding an internship or doing research. 
Pan advised that “when one door closes you can knock on it [and] be annoying” when she related her experience of finding an internship by e-mailing veterinary professors at Ohio State University and asking for an unpaid position after being turned down for all of the other internships she applied to. Pan succeeded and is planning on conducting research at Ohio State this summer.
Although the event was targeted toward first-years, Reweina Tessema, a sophomore psychology major, commented that she “liked the way that they refuted some assumptions about Carnegie Mellon” and “would recommend events like this to freshmen and sophomores — anyone would benefit.”
Tessema found that hearing the students’ personal examples and stories “made the advice seem more real.”
The event was sponsored by Academic Development’s academic counseling program. According to its website, the program is an “assistance program that helps students acquire more effective and efficient study skills.” The program uses a combination of student academic counselors, group workshops, and individual sessions that focus on creating good studying skills to help students of all years to succeed.
These workshops and sessions help to teach important skills such as textbook reading,  lecture note taking, time management, and exam preparation. The Academic Counseling program is designed to help both students who are having academic difficulty and those who just want to improve their study skills.
Academic Development has additional sources of help for first-years called “Fast Facts for Freshmen” that complement the goals of the recent panel discussion. According to its section on the Academic Development website, “This series provides practical advice from Carnegie Mellon students and faculty about many of the new challenges that first year undergraduates face during the first few weeks of college.”
Online pamphlets give advice on classroom strategies, note-taking, working with faculty, managing time, handling coursework, and strategies for studying, testing, and taking advantage of the academic support services all over campus.

Professor gains prestigious Westinghouse Chair position
For his contributions to automotive research at Carnegie Mellon, Ragunathan Rajkumar has earned the Westinghouse Chair in Electrical Engineering. Rajkumar is a professor in the departments of electrical and computer engineering and robotics as well as the head of Carnegie Mellon’s GM Collaborative Lab.
Rajkumar has worked for over a decade to make driving safer for consumers and encourage modernization of the industry. For this work, Rajkumar recently was honored as a Distinguished Engineer by the Association for Computing Machinery, and six of his more than 150 publications have won Best Paper awards in peer-reviewed forums. Other awards include the Technical Achievement and Leadership Award by the IEEE Technical Committee on Real-Time Systems. Rajkumar earned his master’s degree and Ph.D. in computer engineering from Carnegie Mellon in 1986 and 1989, respectively. 
According to a university press release, Rajkumar is also the primary founder of Pittsburgh-based TimeSys Corp., a company which focuses on embedded Linux products and related services. Rajkumar also played a key role in a National Science Foundation research initiative to study cyber-physical systems, with “applications in transportation, health care, green buildings, manufacturing, agriculture, aerospace, and defense.”
Diesel car study proves they have lower ownership cost
A study by researchers in the Tepper School of Business concluded that diesel-engine vehicles are a better value than gasoline-engine vehicles over time. 
The study, titled “Comparing Resale Prices and Total Cost of Ownership for Gasoline, Hybrid and Diesel Passenger Cars and Trucks,” was presented Jan. 27 at the Washington Auto Show. Positives of diesel-engine vehicles include lower operating costs, better fuel economy, and higher resale possibilities, among others. 
According to a university press release, Lester Lave, university professor and Higgins Professor of Economics in the Tepper School of Business, used auction data from Manheim Auctions and Cox Enterprises, Inc. to aid research. He was able to better study the resale values of diesel and gasoline vehicles through this data.
Bosch Diesel Systems, a producer of clean diesel fuel injection systems for passenger cars, trucks, and commercial vehicles, underwrote the cost of the study so as to provide real-world data of the lower cost of ownership of diesel vehicles. “This study is unique because it compares actual auction prices of alternative power trains such as clean diesel and port-fuel injection gasoline engines,” said Lars Ullrich, director of marketing for Bosch, in a university press release.

Super Bowl XLV is around the corner, and football fans couldn’t be more excited. The people of Pittsburgh in particular are showing their Steelers pride by donning anything black and yellow. The Steelers, despite such unbounded support, will be fighting a tough game against the Green Bay Packers come Sunday. It’s difficult to predict which team will take the title of Super Bowl champions; let’s see how these two teams stack up by looking at their 2010 regular-season statistics:
1,089: tackles made by the Steelers
1,924: rushed yards by the Steelers
272.2: Packers' average rushing yards per game
43.9: Packers' gross punting average

Halfway through their terms, some student body executives have made visible progress on the initiatives they promised to the Carnegie Mellon community. Student Body Vice President for Organizations Aaron Gross has reformed the re-recognition process for student organizations to make the process easier for both new and old groups. Student Body Vice President for Finance Eric Wu has been working with student organizations, through mandatory workshops, to craft their budgets for the next year. Gross and Wu are fulfilling their roles admirably and setting a high standard for our student leaders.
From one pair of executives, however, we have seen few results. Student Body President Jarrett Adams and Student Body Vice President Kate Smith have left us unimpressed. As student organization leaders and as members of the student body, we have heard nothing. If any new initiatives have been completed, they were done in secret and with little impact on the student body as a whole.
Perhaps the most striking way to see the failure of the student body executives to live up to their pledges is in their own words. Adams and Smith proposed several initiatives in the run-up to the student government elections last spring. A College Connect program would encourage interaction among students in different majors. The Executive Grant initiative would fund worthwhile campus projects. The Great Ideas campaign would encourage students to submit their own ways to improve the university. Some of these were, in fact, great ideas — but they have not been enacted in any meaningful way. 
In a column in The Tartan last April, Adams promised that “CMU Connect Social” events linking different schools would begin shortly after the fall semester began. We have yet to hear of any. He encouraged students to follow the executives on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jarrettandkate and on their website at www.acollegetobelievein.com. Neither the Twitter account nor the website exists today. This could be understandable, since student government has its own set of web pages on the Carnegie Mellon site at stugov.andrew.cmu.edu/executive.
Yet the official website itself presents a weak and clouded picture of Adams and Smith’s activity over the past six months. Until this weekend, that page was last updated in April 2010 — before the current administration took office. Last week’s version of the site is still easily retrievable from Google’s Web cache. Sometime after Saturday night, five backdated news postings appeared that present the illusion of a student body president and vice president who have been in touch with their constituents all along. 
Even so, it is a thin illusion. A “Fall 2010 Mid-Semester Report” — dated Oct. 29, 2010 but only uploaded to the Internet yesterday — devotes just one bullet point to the Great Ideas campaign, and other ideas sketched out in the PowerPoint presentation are vague, ill-formed, and preliminary. Even on the recently assembled executive branch website, the combined progress since October on all these planned initiatives amounts to a few paragraphs of description on a Web-based guide to Carnegie Mellon that does not yet exist. But most telling of our executive’s inactivity are the numerous references elsewhere in the October-dated presentation to delays, “lots of miscommunication,” and future work on “launching more communicative PR plans.”
Whatever initial progress the president and vice president may have made this fall, it certainly has not been communicated to the student body. The newly active executive website links to Adams and Smith’s current Twitter feed and Facebook page. With a total of 20 combined posts since last July, we remain unimpressed.
In contrast, past administrations, such as last year’s led by Rotimi Abimbola, actively communicated with the student body. They kept their websites updated, used The Tartan’s Leadership Perspectives column to inform the campus community, and frequently updated their social networking outlets to advertise events and initiatives.
Even though our student body leaders have squandered their first semester in office, we hope they take the next few months to put into practice some of their campaign promises or otherwise make visible progress. Too many Carnegie Mellon students are cynical about student government and feel that it does little to serve their needs. The current student body executives are only reinforcing that belief.

We all love the concept of social networking websites. Whether it’s having a constant connection with friends, knowledge of when exciting events are happening, or simply procrastination, we view social networking sites as invaluable for their immediacy.
Recently, social networking sites have taken on a new role: fastest news source. In the modern age where everyone has a smart phone and is never more than a click away from the Internet, news distribution has been completely transformed. Social networking sites are growing exponentially. Twitter and Facebook, in particular, have become the leading sources of news through their incredible popularity and their ability to swiftly stream information.  
“The emergence of Facebook as a real driver of news stories tells us something important about how news works,” said Derek Thompson in an article for The Atlantic. “Getting our news from our friends is nothing new. It’s as old as the concept of neighborhood gossip.... Friends are reading what their friends are reading, who are reading what their friends are reading, and so on. It presages the deterioration of top-down news, and the rise of news-reading groups whose news sources and opinions become a centripetal, self-perpetuated cycle of information.”
Hardly a minute goes by without your Twitter or Facebook account updating and refreshing its stream of information. Social networking sites are not only connecting you to your friends, but connecting you to the greater world. A friend studying abroad in England shares a link to a recent terrorist bombing in Manchester; another friend in California updates his status to be about the Prop 19 debate; your cousin invites you to an event about a Washington, D.C. rally — the surge of news from around the world is endless, and it’s right at your fingertips.
Social networking sites’ growing supremacy in news distribution leads to the question of what will happen to the rest of the news media. 
It is already a common assumption that printed news media is far beyond its glory days; sadly, The Tartan belongs to a dying breed. Furthermore, credible Internet news sources are few and far between. However, what of the television news sector?
In all honesty, news channels have lost their art. 
A majority of news channels, most notably Fox and CNN, are blatantly biased. News shows have lost their variety and well-rounded reporting. It is a battle between the far right and the far left; a pragmatic moderate point no longer exists. Legitimately and objectively reporting the news is no longer important; ratings have become the only priority.
There has been an obvious shift in the background and quality of reporters. An increasing number of news hosts are primarily from the entertainment business; although they have experience in the journalistic arena, they made their careers being entertainers. For example, CNN’s newest addition, Piers Morgan, was made famous by his various appearances on reality TV shows. This is no mistake on the network’s part; these hosts know how to stir up an audience and deliver the desired ratings. In 2009, according to www.mediabistro.com, Glenn Beck “drew in more viewers than all three of the competing time-slot shows on CNN, MSNBC and HLN combined.”
Rousing partisan debates and being completely subjective in report coverage are becoming common occurrences in modern television news. 
According to Jason Mittell, in his blog article “Debating Media Bias,” “News media shapes public opinion through the selection of what stories are told and what are omitted.... The selection of stories and perspectives triggers a process termed agenda setting, framing what is viewed as newsworthy and what is ignored by the news — a shorthand notion of agenda setting is that the news doesn’t tell us what to think, but it tells us what to think about. If viewers are unaware that a story or perspective even exists, they cannot begin to contemplate how it might fit into the larger context of the news they are receiving.”
Shows mocking traditional news channels, like The Colbert Report and The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, are quickly becoming the most credible and unbiased source of news. Yes, these shows are also aimed at entertainment; however, they still manage to deliver the news in a straightforward and objective manner. In mocking the news syndicates, The Colbert Report and The Daily Show push audiences to think practically about where they’re getting their news from and how ridiculous the traditional channels have become.
It is time we seriously consider the state of our news media. Traditional television syndicates have lost all sincerity, print news is being crushed by the technological age, and credible Internet sources are increasingly rare. Re-evaluation of where we get our news and how we interpret it is strongly advised.

The last week has seen tens of thousands of protesters take to the streets of Egypt. “Freedom!” they cry in Arabic. “No, no, Mubarak,” read the signs, referring to the nation’s president for the last 30 years. It is an awakening of a popular movement that has long been suppressed. Across the Arab world, authoritarian governments fear a wave of unrest that could topple long-standing regimes. Tunisia’s dictator fled just a few weeks ago and was replaced with a representative government. The fate of Egypt’s leaders remains uncertain. And while its people are not Arab, Iran’s citizens have shown themselves willing to demand reforms in the past elections. The status quo, always fragile, seems to be on the verge of collapse. The future is unclear.
Those of us who have no direct stake in the popular movements in the Muslim world have our own dilemma. How do we feel about those uprisings? Do we support the will of the protesters or the strength of the authorities? In such a volatile region, every result carries its own dangers.
At first glance, we immediately sympathize with the protesters in Egypt. President Hosni Mubarak has done little to help his people in his last three decades of rule. He has used the police and other official agencies to suppress dissent, such as that expressed by the Muslim Brotherhood, a minority (and illegal) political party with an Islamist agenda. Egyptians want better economic conditions and more political freedoms. They want freedom from the oppressive regime that controls their country. As Americans, and as free-thinking human beings, we cannot help but want them to succeed.
Despite the moral simplicity that supporting the protesters offers, there are more subtle consequences of a collapse of the existing order in Egypt. East of the Nile Delta lies the Suez Canal, an essential transport route from the Mediterranean Sea to the Indian Ocean. Uncertainty over the security of the canal has led to international conflict before, and political turmoil in Egypt might threaten international trade.
To the northeast of the Suez Canal lie Israel and the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, both of which would feel profound effects from a major change in Egyptian government. Egypt and Israel have a peace agreement gained from several wars since 1948. The two counties have limited military cooperation, and Israel relies on maintaining a peaceful southern border. A new government in Cairo could destroy that tenuous relationship, leading to resumed conflict between the two most technologically advanced armies in the immediate region. A new, sensible Egyptian authority would realize that such a setback would be disastrous for both countries, but it is impossible to predict the outcome of a popular revolution. Skeptics are already looking to Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution to see the potential catastrophe that might result. An Israeli-Egyptian relationship that is at the very least not hostile is essential to retaining any semblance of peace in the Middle East.
Along with the possibility of decaying relations with Israel, a new Egyptian government might not see the United States as an ally, as Mubarak does. Political changes in the Middle East have rarely helped America’s foreign policy. President Barack Obama’s halfhearted support for the current Egyptian protests, coupled with the United States’ long support for the Mubarak government, mean that a new popular regime would have little reason to love Obama or his country. And while many reports have identified the protesters as largely secular, there are also Islamist, anti-American elements which might exercise power in a post-Mubarak government.
As fast as the uprising in Tunisia was, and as fast as the protests in Egypt are moving now, it is impossible to predict what will happen this evening, much less a month from now. Nobody can say whether Mubarak will hold on to power or if his regime will fall. What is clear, though, is that this complex situation requires caution. As much as we might wish to unreservedly support the protesters, we must also recognize that their victory might ultimately create more problems than it solves. Egypt has a democratic constitution, and a solution through the legally established political process has a better chance of success than an overthrow of the government. Mubarak should realize his rule has come to an end and resign in favor of an interim leader who will guarantee free, open, and fair elections.

For the third time in six years, Pittsburgh’s going to the Super Bowl. Even though football fans across the region are eagerly gearing up for the Steelers’ big day this Sunday with the Green Bay Packers, we greet the news with some trepidation. The aftermath of Pittsburgh’s last few appearances in the championship game has convinced us that we can end up with too much of a good thing.
Don’t get us wrong: There’s nothing wrong with having pride in the home team. Whether it’s “one for the thumb,” a trip to “Sixburgh,” or “Stairway to Seven,” we defend everyone’s right to wave the Terrible Towel and watch the Steelers in action Sunday evening. Call over a few friends and order pizza and chicken wings. Watch the game at your favorite neighborhood bar. And after the final whistle blows and the coach has been doused with Gatorade, celebrate (or mourn) responsibly.
Excitement over expected post-game riots is already buzzing around campus, and it is clear that — win or lose — rabid Steelers fans and go-with-the-flow types alike will be out in the streets making their joy or disappointment known to the world via criminal property damage. When the Steelers won the 2006 Super Bowl over the Seattle Seahawks, rioters across the city overturned cars, uprooted street signs, and burned the awning of a business in Oakland. Riots after Pittsburgh’s 2009 victory over the Arizona Cardinals led to $150,000 in damage, including numerous small fires, broken windows, and a dismantled bus shelter.
These types of actions are pointless and wasteful. Not only are smashing windows and ripping down signs futile ways to express your feelings about the local sports team, it also leaves hard-up city coffers and innocent local business owners footing the clean-up bill. Students should know as well as anyone how desperate the city of Pittsburgh is for money: Mayor Luke Ravenstahl proposed the infamous city tuition tax barely a year ago. In the private sector, recent news has suggested that the economy is beginning to improve, but it is far from being back on its feet again. 
Finally, participating in a riot just because others are is a flimsy excuse. Local laws and standards of responsibility do not change because of a football victory, and there are many less destructive ways for Steelers fans to express their excitement.
We hope that some awareness of these facts, and a respect for other people’s property, follows the crowds out into the streets of Oakland Sunday night. Being home of the seven-time Super Bowl champions would be a great morale boost for Pittsburgh, but students who head outside after Sunday’s game should make sure they don’t cause headaches for city administrators or business owners.

Last week, the editorial board of The Tartan wrote a response to a USA Today article concerning a student’s first two years at an American university. The USA Today article reports that 45 percent of students involved in the study it referenced showed no significant gains in learning during their first two years of college and also that students spend less time studying than they did a few decades ago. The Tartan responded that these first two years should be used as building blocks for later study and that, “if the majority of the nation’s college students are unable to get anything out of their first two years, perhaps a re-evaluation of the way students structure their time is necessary.”
I’ll agree that there are all sorts of issues with the current American education system and it very well could use some reform, but that’s not my focus here. I will argue, though, that these articles are missing a bigger picture, especially when taken in the context of Carnegie Mellon. What both USA Today and The Tartan failed to acknowledge is the culture of being a college student today. College is no longer considered solely a time when a student learns. Try getting a job with only good grades to support you, and you’ll know exactly what I mean.
College has become more of an “experience,” where the student is expected to grow both academically and personally. In fact, it’s an initiative that Carnegie Mellon has been working on for years. I expect that, if the administration had data suggesting that current students study less now, they wouldn’t necessarily be disappointed. Granted, at another school, where this data could indicate large amounts of partying, it isn’t the best news. But at Carnegie Mellon, it’s a good sign that students are more involved outside the classroom, spending time with people outside their majors and generally building a community. You’d be hard pressed to convince me that the rigor of academic programs has decreased, both because of my personal experience and the good reviews our school receives. So a decrease in time spent studying hopefully indicates that students both complete their studies and do activities outside the classroom as well.
For me, the book Academically Adrift: Limited Learning on College Campuses, the one cited by USA Today, sounds nearsighted. Learning cannot solely be measured by a standardized test. And while that makes universities harder to judge, it certainly is no excuse to totally assume that today’s students are underachievers.
