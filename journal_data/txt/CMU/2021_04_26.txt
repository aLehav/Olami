Yuzuru Hanyu took the world by storm back in 2014. At 19 years old, Hanyu won gold in men’s singles figure skating at the 2014 Sochi Olympics, giving Japan its first gold in men’s figure skating and becoming the youngest Olympic men’s singles champion in 66 years. In addition, he also broke the world record for the highest-scoring short program in figure skating history, becoming the first to score over 100 points in a short program. Now, over seven years later, Hanyu still holds the short program world record, having scored 111.82 points in the 2020 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships.
Since achieving Olympic glory in 2014, Yuzuru Hanyu has become the man to beat in men’s singles figure skating. And since 2017, after winning that year’s U.S. Championships at age 17, a large portion of the figure skating world has had its eyes on Nathan Chen to be the one to do it. Although Chen was unable to best Hanyu at the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics, finishing fifth behind Hanyu who defended his title with a second Olympic gold, the last couple competitions in which both athletes have competed has seen a shift in Chen’s favor. Both the 2021 World Figure Skating Championships, held back in late March, and the 2021 ISU World Team Trophy in Figure Skating have seen Chen finishing above Hanyu in the final table.
While from an outside perspective, this might appear to be a classic story of “younger athlete overtaking aging record-setter,” the truth is more complicated than something as simple as athleticism, and lies in the way figure skating is judged and scored. In figure skating, athletes first compete in a short program, which lasts just over two-and-a-half minutes, then a free skate program, lasting around four minutes. Within the short program, all skaters must complete seven required elements, though they can choose the sequence to complete them in, whereas in the free skate, skaters can choose their own elements to complete. The scores of the two programs are then combined for the skater’s final total. Since the majority (usually around two-thirds) of the athlete’s final score rests on the free skate, a good free skate can make up for a poor short program.
For each part of the program, athletes are scored on their executed elements (the skills they perform) added to their program components (their transitions, interpretation of the music, etc.), with the executed elements weighing more heavily on the total score. Each executed element comes with a fixed base value reflecting the difficulty of the element, and receives a grade of execution (GOE) addition. The GOE is determined by the panel of judges, who give the skater a score based on how well the element receiving the GOE addition was performed. This addition can range from -5 to +5 (expanded from -3 to +3 in mid-2018). As a result, an element with a lower base value performed perfectly could potentially score higher overall than an element with a higher base value performed poorly.
Yuzuru Hanyu’s greatest strength arguably lies in the execution of his elements — that is, his GOE scores — and his components score, the former working more heavily in his favor. The GOE factor is made most apparent in Hanyu’s short programs. Since all athletes complete the same seven required elements, the variation in base value totals is usually significantly less than that of the free skate. As a result, Hanyu’s consistency in performing each element often returns a positive GOE higher than that of his opponents, giving him an edge and a buffer heading into the free skate. Hanyu’s standing short program score record is proof of this quality.
While Hanyu’s free skate base value total used to be among the highest in older competitions such as the 2014 Olympic Games, there has since been a significant increase in his competitors’ base value totals. Although he finished at the top of the podium in the 2018 Olympics, Hanyu’s free skate base value total was the second-lowest among the top six finishers in the free skate. Once again, his GOE contributed significantly towards his victory. An overwhelmingly positive set of GOE scores meant that Hanyu had a total segment score of 206.17, nearly four points higher than silver medalist Shoma Uno, despite Uno having a free skate base value total over 10 points higher than Hanyu.
In contrast, Nathan Chen’s biggest advantage lies in the difficulty of the elements he performs in the free skate and their base values. Specifically, Chen’s free skate program generally incorporates more quadruple jumps than his competitors, which, if completed, results in more points. By starting out with more points on the table, Chen can afford to have an occasional deduction in GOE. If he performs just as well or better than the next-best competitor in terms of GOE, his higher base value will almost always guarantee a victory by a significant margin. This also means that Chen is far more dangerous during the free skate segment versus the short program, since the base value difference between him and his competitors is far greater during the former, and that he is more than capable of coming into a free skate trailing behind the podium and coming out on top.
This is best reflected in Chen’s performance at the 2018 Olympics. Despite it not being his best performance, Chen managed to progress from a mistake-ridden 17th-place short program to finishing fifth overall with a first-place free skate that scored nearly nine points higher than gold medalist Yuzuru Hanyu, due in large part to Chen’s free skate starting with a whopping 115.11 combined base value in comparison to Hanyu’s 92.56. Since then, Chen has improved significantly in maintaining positive GOE scores, and his recent results are reflective of that.
The 2021 World Figure Skating Championships showcased both athlete’s strengths and weaknesses. Hanyu topped the field in the short program with an entirely positive set of GOE scores, finishing over eight points ahead of Chen despite having started with a lower total base value. However, Chen made his comeback during the free skate. Beginning with a total base value of 100.10, Chen skated an extremely clean segment, with his GOE never dropping below +1. This exceedingly positive result, coupled with an unmatchable base value, meant that Chen dominated the free skate, finishing over 30 points ahead of his closest competitor.
While Chen fell on the first quad jump of his short program and finished third in that segment, his phenomenal free skate more than made up for the difference, and propelled him to first place overall. In comparison, Hanyu made several mistakes in his free skate that resulted in negative GOEs in two out of four quads and two out of four triples and finished fourth in the segment, but his strong short program meant that Hanyu was still able to place third overall, 12 points ahead of the next closest competitor. Despite both athletes performing well in their signature segments, the free skate’s greater weight on the total score worked far more effectively in Chen’s favor.
Chen’s base value advantage becomes even more apparent in the 2021 ISU World Team Trophy, held back in mid-April. By skating a very clean short program, Chen topped the table in the short program with 109.65 points off of a 47.67 combined base value, ahead of Hanyu, who scored 107.12 off of a 45.80 base value. In the free skate, Chen was set to start with a 87.82 base value, whereas Hanyu would start with 77.81. In order to overcome the difference in base values in addition to the margin left by the short program, Hanyu would have to score over 12 points higher than Chen across his GOE and component scores.
Both athletes performed similarly in the free program, and received similar GOE and component scores. As a result, Chen finished higher than Hanyu again, scoring 203.24 versus Hanyu’s 193.76. While the World Team Trophy was a team competition and not an individual one, the results meant that Chen had bested Hanyu twice in competition in under four weeks, and that Team USA would place second in the competition, ahead of third-placed Team Japan.
Contrary to what some may conclude based on the results, Hanyu’s performance has not declined. Over the past seven years, Yuzuru Hanyu has improved steadily, as evidenced by his current record short program score set just over a year ago (111.82) being over 10 points higher than the record short program score he set back in 2014 (101.45). Hanyu’s impact on the figure skating world is unquestionable: he was the first to land the quad loop in competition, the first skater from Asia to win Olympic gold, the first men’s singles skater from Asia to win multiple World Championships, and has broken 18 world records across his career so far. Having dominated the top of the International Skating Union standings for nearly half-a-decade straight from 2013 to 2018, Hanyu has carved out a spot for himself in the sport’s history, and Chen’s recent victories do not discount this fact. Nor should Hanyu’s lengthy and steady list of career accomplishments discount Chen’s incredible recent successes. Chen, who is currently on the longest win streak of 13 individual competitions among all active skaters, is undefeated since the 2018 Olympics, and holds the current world records for the highest free skate and combined total scores, is arguably making his own mark on figure skating history.
Both Hanyu and Chen have advanced the sport of figure skating, and both athletes have made strides to improve their performances time and time again. To attribute either skater’s success to them simply being “better” than the other would be a gross misunderstanding of the athletes’ capabilities and of the sport’s nuances. Yet, it is possible that Hanyu’s era of dominance is coming to a close as Chen looks poised to continue pushing the sport forward. Chen’s technically difficult repertoire elevates his starting position far above his competition, and, as he becomes more consistent in scoring positively and highly in his GOE, he will no doubt become a fearsome competitor with an even larger role in the history books. As the world recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic and the sporting community looks ahead to the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, watching how Yuzuru Hanyu and Nathan Chen continue to exceed and develop in competition will certainly be a captivating experience.

Connecting the dots between engagement and learning
Overcoming educational barriers is critical to ensuring that future generations of students are able to make the most of the opportunities presented to them. Traditional educational wisdom holds that repetition is necessary for mastery, but new research from Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh shows that internal states like engagement have an impact on learning outcomes. By examining changes in internal states such as arousal, attention, motivation, and engagement using brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, researchers found that systematic variations in these factors can influence how behavior improves with learning. This work gives insight into how to develop more effective methods for teaching.

The ubiquity of tarantulas
As far as spiders go, tarantulas are iconic. With their large size and vibrant colors, they are eye-catching creatures. Researchers, including Carnegie Mellon University’s Saoirse Foley, are investigating the ancestry of spiders to learn more about their origins and when they first originated. Surprisingly, tarantulas are ancient, first emerging in the Americas about 120 million years ago during the Cretaceous Period. Natural homebodies, tarantulas are now widespread thanks to continental drift.

If you've heard anything at all about COVID-19 vaccines lately, you probably know that distribution of the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccine was paused after six women developed blood clots, and one of them died. After evaluating that the risk of developing these blood clots is very low, the FDA recommended resuming J&J vaccine distribution after April 23 for individuals 18 and older. Here's a quick summary of what you need to know:
Should I be worried about getting blood clots from the J&J vaccine?
No, as the chances are about one in a million. However, women from 18 to 49 years of age should still be aware that there is a chance of developing these blood clots.
If you received the vaccine, you can look for symptoms of blood clots such as severe headaches and shortness of breath. A more detailed list of symptoms can be found on the CDC website. However, if it has been more than three weeks since you got the vaccine, it is not likely that you will develop these blood clots.
What are these blood clots, and what's causing them?
Blood clots are caused by platelets in the bloodstream. Platelets help stop blood from flowing out of wounds and form scabs to prevent excess blood loss. However, too many platelets can form blood clots inside the body. This means that instead of preventing blood from flowing out of the body, it can prevent blood from flowing around the body, which causes many problems.
The blood clots seen in patients who developed it after the J&J vaccine are unusual, however. Even patients with histories of low platelet counts developed blood clots in places such as the brain, lungs, and abdomen.
Scientists are currently unsure of what is causing these blood clots, but they believe it is related to an antibody released in response to a platelet formation factor.
What is the difference between the J&J vaccine and other vaccines?
The main difference is that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines use messenger RNA (mRNA). These mRNAs tell cells how to make the protein unique to COVID-19, and the proteins trigger the immune system to create antibodies to fight COVID-19. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine (as well as the AstraZeneca vaccine) uses a more conventional approach of sending in a weak virus with the SARS-CoV protein to trigger an individual's immune response.

Spoilers for The Falcon and the Winter Soldier
At the end of Avengers: Endgame, there were a few important questions set up. What is going to happen after the Blip that resurrected half of Earth's population suddenly after five years? What is going to happen with Captain America? Will The Falcon step up to the mantle of Captain America? The Falcon and the Winter Soldier answers all these questions while delivering a mostly consistent and entertaining piece of Marvel media. It’s nothing exceptional, but it was certainly good and enjoyable.
Part 1: Sam Wilson’s arc
Sam Wilson, AKA The Falcon, has the strongest arc of the whole show. His conflict is the most fleshed out, and it results in some really meaningful and impactful social commentary about the experience of Black people in America. It’s also clever how the show ties Sam’s hesitation to be a Black Captain America into a typical hero’s journey arc, which makes it a very tangible and grounded arc that the audience can really latch on to.
There are two aspects that make Sam’s arc really stand out. The first aspect is Sam’s relationship with Bucky, AKA the Winter Soldier. The development of Bucky and Sam’s friendship also includes Bucky’s understanding of Sam’s experience as a Black man, which was a thoughtful angle I would never have expected a Marvel show like this to take.
Steve Rogers was essentially a family figure to Bucky, and the shield represented the last remaining bit of Steve now that he is gone. However, Bucky doesn’t understand that the stars and stripes don’t mean the same thing to Sam because of his experience as a Black man. As their friendship develops, so does this understanding, and it was really satisfying to watch that. Sam learns from Bucky that even if Steve or Bucky didn’t understand Sam’s hesitancy to be Captain America, he still has it in him to fight for what’s right.
This ties into the second aspect that really makes Sam’s arc work: Isaiah Bradley. He’s a Black super soldier who was made into a super soldier like Steve Rogers. Bradley also rescued his fellow soldiers from a prisoner of war camp the same way Steve Rogers did, but instead of getting a hero’s recognition like Rogers, he was imprisoned and experimented on for 30 years. Sam’s relationship with Bradley highlights the dilemma Sam faces about being a Black Captain America. But as the story progresses, Sam learns that all the struggle would mean nothing if he didn’t continue to fight for what’s right. The result is a really touching payoff that provides a level of optimism worthy of Steve Rogers.
Part 2: Bucky’s arc
Bucky’s arc is another great emotional arc that helps carry the show. Now free of his past as the Winter Soldier, he has to come to terms with the trauma of being a killing machine he didn’t have control over. He holds Steve Roger’s book, where he has a list of names of people he wronged as the Winter Soldier and needs to make amends with. However, he struggles to articulate his trauma or even reach out for help properly. As his friendship with Sam develops, we see him begin to open up more and realize that he can’t get rid of his past as the Winter Soldier. All he can do is accept that he did that and put in the work so he can find peace.
Bucky’s arc also results in the reintroduction of Baron Zemo and the Wakandans, which was very awesome to see. Zemo delivers some of the best scenes of the show, with an interesting moral code that helps highlight Bucky’s own arc. Zemo hates heroes and super soldiers, not because they’re super soldiers, but because of the god complex and supremacist ideology associated with it. For Bucky, he didn’t want to be the Winter Soldier, which is something that Zemo realizes. It’s a very great angle to take for a villain like Zemo, and I hope we get to see more of him in future Marvel installments.
Part 3: John Walker’s arc
John Walker is a great contrast to Sam Wilson. His arc over the course of the show is that he can’t handle the pressure of being Captain America. With great power comes great responsibility, and John Walker couldn’t match the mantle of Captain America the same way Sam could. He’s tempered by his best friend, Lemar Hoskins, who ultimately suffers a brutal death at the hands of the main antagonists of the show, the Flag Smashers. We see John Walker descend into insanity as he takes the super-soldier serum and decapitates one of the Flag Smashers in full view of the public.
The development of Walker’s arc, while a bit rushed towards the end, does a good job of showing how even those who may be considered good people get corrupted when given power. Walker is basically the type of person Zemo warns of. He has a major hero complex, and once given the Captain America mantle, feels the pressure to live up to the name as much as possible. When he takes the super-soldier serum, we see this complex exacerbated. However, at the end of the day, it shows that John’s intentions are not as corrupted as they seem, and by the last episode, we see him become more of an anti-hero rather than true villain. It’s a nuanced approach that I didn’t expect, but I wish Walker’s arc got some more time to marinate before it concluded.
Part 4: The Flag Smashers arc
The Flag Smashers are a radical group who want to stop the Global Repatriation Council (GRC) from mistreating and resettling millions of refugees after the Blip resurrected half the world’s population. While there are some decent elements of the arc and a good exploration of how and why people get radicalized, the actual radicalization arc is very rushed and inconsistent.
The show tries to portray the Flag Smashers as both antagonists and anti-heroes and the result is very mixed. Karli Morgenthau, the main leader of the Flag Smashers, is meant to descend further into madness as a result of the GRC’s apathy and John Walker’s decapitation of one of her friends in public. However, the show misplaces certain scenes that show Karli getting more aggressive and violent. For example, Karli plants a car bomb somewhere in episode 4 that kills civilians, but there was no reason for her to do it apart from the fact that the show wanted to remind the audience she is the antagonist. If this scene were placed after John Walker decapitated her friend, it would have made more sense and it would have helped with the show’s pacing. Unfortunately, the misplacement of scenes such as that one end up making the arc feel more hollow even if both the actual political commentary and world building that surrounded it were interesting and nuanced.
Final thoughts
Overall, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is a pretty entertaining and well-made show. The action scenes were mostly good, but some of the CGI and editing were very bad at times, particularly in the last episode. The action with the shield was pretty sweet to watch, and Sam’s moves with his Falcon wings were really awesome. The plot construction could have been a bit better, but for what it's worth, I didn’t expect a fairly mature and grounded show like this. If you’re a die-hard Marvel fan, definitely give this a watch, and if you’re a casual viewer, I’d recommend giving it a try for the commentary and Sam Wilson’s story.
Final rating: 7/10
Best episode: episode 5

The U.S. has now administered well over 200 million COVID-19 vaccination shots, and all adults are now eligible for the vaccine in all 50 states and Washington D.C. 
Pennsylvania expanded its vaccine rollout to all people 16 or older on April 13, moving it up from the previously planned date of April 19. Since then, Pennsylvanians have been eligible for the Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. However, only the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is approved for those 16 and older, while Moderna and Johnson & Johnson's vaccines are approved for individuals 18 and older. 
Additionally, the U.S. resumed its rollout of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine after a 10-day pause. The federal government had recommended a pause in administering the Johnson & Johnson vaccine after discovering cases of a blood clotting disorder, called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), in six women who had received the shot out of about 7.2 million doses administered. A CDC panel voted to resume the shot after more investigation. A CDC press release assured, "The FDA and CDC have confidence that this vaccine is safe and effective in preventing COVID-19."
At Carnegie Mellon, the Giant Eagle partnership concluded on Tuesday, which was the last day to register for vaccine appointments. The university sent multiple emails referring the Carnegie Mellon community to the Allegheny Health Network (AHN) for vaccine appointments. Additionally, Allegheny County has a map of vaccine providers available on its website, and Rite-Aid, the pharmacy chain with a location just a few blocks away from the Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh Campuses, is also offering some COVID-19 vaccine appointments through its website. Additionally, some states, including Pennsylvania and neighboring Maryland, are allowing nonresidents to schedule vaccine appointments.
COVID-19 has continued to infect people in the U.S. and worldwide. Last week, the State Department moved 115 countries to a level 4 "do not travel" advisory, citing increased risks from COVID-19. Within the U.S., new daily COVID-19 cases have hovered at about 60,000 despite vaccinations continuing. 
At Carnegie Mellon, from April 20 to April 24, there were 14 cases of COVID-19 among students present on-campus and 9 cases among students off-campus this week, up from 5 cases on-campus and 4 off-campus the week before. From April 20 to April 21, the Tartan Testing program identified 2 positive cases out of 1,183 tests, for a positivity rate of 0.17 percent. 5.00 percent of isolation and quarantine housing is in use, with 220 isolation and quarantine beds still available. 
Allegheny County has now identified 95,857 total cases of and 1,858 deaths from COVID-19. There were 1,795 cases in Allegheny County during the week starting April 11.

At the beginning of my sophomore year at Carnegie Mellon University, I began having a myriad of strange symptoms. I developed a tremor in both of my hands, I couldn’t think straight, and my heart rate was recorded to be 170, 180, even over 200 beats per minute at times when I was sitting down doing absolutely nothing. And every time I brought this up to a friend, family member, or medical professional, they all assured me the same thing: it was probably due to stress. No, I had thought. I know what stress is. This isn’t it. Something is wrong with me. I had gotten this feedback so many times that I started to believe that maybe there was nothing physically wrong with me, and that it was all in my head. Once, I had gone to the hospital because I couldn’t catch my breath and was noticeably out of breath just speaking to people. After some tests were performed with no abnormalities, a nurse handed me my discharge papers, curtly saying, “We won’t be admitting you because we only admit sick people.” The culmination of these comments from everyone around me kept me up at night, where I kept asking myself, Am I faking this?
A series of inflection points occurred. My tremors continued, and I was now having problems with my hand-eye coordination. My memory started to get really fuzzy, and the days seemed to blend together. At one point, I asked my roommate whether or not I had gone to class the day prior. She said yes, all of them. I had no recollection of it.
I saw a physician again and received the same response I had gotten so many times before: “You’re stressed, maybe depressed. I can write you a referral to a psychiatrist if you want.”
I called my parents, who I had been keeping in contact with throughout this whole ordeal. I said, “I have to come home. I don’t know what’s wrong, but something is and I’m not able to finish school.” My mother paused for a second, before answering, “There’s only a few weeks left of school. Can you just make it until then?” 
Could I?
After hanging up, my mother realized that I was essentially asking permission for me to leave school and come home. She read my mind like only a mother could, and called me back immediately and said to come home.
I submitted my leave of absence form, packed up my room, and was on the way to the airport to fly back home. I cried the whole way there out of frustration, confusion, and devastation that I had just thrown an entire semester’s worth of work away. I started developing hives and rashes with no discernible cause. I could hardly eat because I felt full after a few bites. I was so fatigued that I spent nights on the couch because I didn’t have the energy to make it to my bed. And yet, many times I found myself being critical of my decision to leave school.
Unbeknownst to everybody at the time, including myself, there was a problem. A big one. I had an undiagnosed autoimmune disease, Sjögren's syndrome, which was free to run rampant because it was not being treated. It had mainly damaged my autonomic nervous system, the part of your body in charge of all of the “automatic” functions of your body such as digestion, circulation, blood pressure, etc. Blood would pool in my legs because it wasn’t being circulated properly, causing a significant deficit in the amount of blood and oxygen going to my brain. My brain knew something was wrong, so it would send my heart rate soaring in an attempt to receive more blood, a condition called postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). The lack of blood and oxygen explained a lot of my problems: memory issues, difficulty in concentration, fatigue, lightheadedness, headaches, and more. POTS was far from the only consequence. My nervous system was in overdrive trying to protect itself. It convinced my immune system it wasn’t protecting me properly, so I started having reactions to random foods, materials, and makeup that I never had before (mast cell activation syndrome). It also paralyzed my stomach and the majority of my intestines (gastroparesis).
I saw some doctors at home who were amazing, and some of the first to take me seriously. And funny enough, since they took me seriously, they were able to find the issue relatively quickly. I’m simplifying timelines a bit because it really took a few years to understand everything that was going on, but a noticeable shift had been made in my life once I saw a neurologist and started various pharmaceutical treatments.
I ended up taking more time off school, and when I returned, I could only handle about three classes. Keeping up with my body felt like I was basically juggling a full-time job on top of school. I wasn’t very stable on my feet, so I had to use a walker to get around campus. It was humiliating at times. My friends didn’t quite know how to deal with me, and I don’t blame them. Health problems like the ones I have aren’t very common in young people, so they couldn’t relate to my experiences and didn’t know how to comfort me.
I found a lot of solace with Catherine Getchell over at Disability Resources, who sat down with me to get me some academic accommodations. To this day, I will say the biggest reason I have been able to succeed at Carnegie Mellon is because of my accommodations. To anybody else that struggles with any condition be it mental, physical, or cognitive, I encourage you to sit down and chat with Disability Resources.
But having accommodations came with an unexpected barrier I had to work through mentally. I had been through so much, more than the majority of students will go through at their time at Carnegie Mellon, so why did having accommodations not sit right with me? I couldn’t tell if I felt guilty, ashamed, or maybe both. A new insecurity set in, and now the question I asked myself at night was, Am I taking the easy way out?
It was a ridiculous question in a sense, because I knew that was not the case. I deserved to have the accommodations. It made all the sense in the world to only take three classes. In fact, more than one doctor back home recommended it. But after hearing about the usual Carnegie Mellon stress the rest of my friends were going through and thinking about my greatly reduced stress from taking fewer classes, the occasional joke would be made. Man, I WISH I had your schedule and accommodations. I didn’t blame them and wasn’t necessarily offended by it, but part of me felt like the odd one out because to some extent it felt like I wasn’t suffering in the right ways.
I found myself wishing that I had someone at Carnegie Mellon to talk to that understood me. I had joined several online support groups for others with my chronic illness, but I found it hard to really connect with others struggling in college because I wanted to know people that not only related to my physical symptoms, but understood my context. Carnegie Mellon is a prestigious school full of driven, intelligent, high-achieving people. Understanding the complexities of Carnegie Mellon “culture” was an important component of learning how to walk through student life with a chronic illness. The constant need to feel accomplishment, to feel like I belonged here, is draining for anybody, but it was especially detrimental to my mental and physical health. Am I good enough to be here?
I knew there had to be other students that felt the same way, so in fall of 2018 I reached out to Catherine Getchell and pitched my idea to create a student organization for students with chronic illnesses and disabilities. She was immediately supportive, and connected me to a few fellow students that might be interested in participating in whatever I created. To my surprise, people wanted in! I began holding the first unofficial meetings with some students before Able got its formal recognition from the student government. We all got to know each other, and right from the first meeting I knew that there was something special happening. I didn’t know it at the time, but Able would end up being one of the best things I’ve ever done at Carnegie Mellon, and possibly in my whole life.
After founding Able, I served as president for two years. In that time, I was able to meet with the Dietrich College Council to talk about accommodations in the classroom, had the opportunity to attend the President’s Dinner to share my thoughts about how to include disability in campus diversity initiatives, carried out multiple advocacy campaigns, and, of course, helped execute plenty of fun game nights and social events for our members.
Able has helped me grow in so many ways. It has helped me process and work with my own chronic illness, taught me the importance of open and honest communication, helped me embrace who I am unapologetically, gave me strength to advocate for myself, and ignited my passion for leadership. All of this helped me be a better student, friend, and leader.
At times, I can’t help but feel like my life as a student is nothing more than a series of extenuating circumstances. And I’m working on telling myself that that’s okay. There were so many times where I took incompletes in classes because of my health or turned in projects late, or asked for homework extensions (sometimes after the due date). I’m blessed that most of my professors were always willing to work with me. But when I remember so many of these rushed panicked moments trying to throw work together, I can’t help but feel like I’m not enough or I’m not a good student. It’s ridiculous, but part of me wants to know if I’m good enough to cross the finish line by myself, without help. But if there’s anything I learned in my experience at Carnegie Mellon, it’s that asking for help is okay.
Strength doesn’t come from sheer independence, and it never has. Strong people are strong not because they landed gracefully, but because they made it through something hard. And they survived. Merely surviving is enough. Due to taking classes on a part-time basis most semesters, I never qualified for the Dean’s List. I never had a summer internship because I spent summers at home getting my treatment plan adjusted. And that’s okay. I survived, and that is a feat to be proud of because there were many moments where I wasn’t sure if I would make it through college at all, let alone at Carnegie Mellon.
If I had to leave some last words of wisdom for my friends and peers, one tip would be to communicate as much as you can with your professors. I always took time to sit down with my professors and go over my accommodations, and I believe that’s a big reason why so many were willing to work with me so much. If the class centered around a lot of group work, I would ask to be put in a larger group; this way, if something happened to me and I was hospitalized or had to leave school for one reason or another, it wouldn’t affect my group as much. I’d work out which assignments could be flexible with due dates, and hash out exam logistics. Admittedly, having these meetings every semester can be draining as well as daunting. But they were always worth it! You are your own advocate, and that ability is more powerful than you might think. If you’re juggling with your own health problems, trust your body, even if you keep getting brushed off by medical professionals. You know yourself best, and if you think there’s something wrong, keep trying to figure it out because you are not faking it!
And on the professor side, I urge all of those teaching students to be open-minded and flexible when having these sorts of conversations. Ensure confidentiality by holding these conversations outside office hours, and try not to discuss the details of the student’s diagnoses.
When you’re going through something hard, the only thing you have to do is go through it. Don’t push yourself to be perfect. You just have to make it to the finish line, even if you walk or crawl across it. That is more than enough.

This past Tuesday, a jury convicted former officer Derek Chauvin for second-degree manslaughter, second-degree murder, and third-degree murder. After decades of acquittals for extrajudicial murders by the police, the guilty verdict prompted celebration across the country. While it is a worthy cause to celebrate, it must be tempered with the understanding that guilty verdicts should be the norm, not the exception. 
This is yet another pyrrhic victory in the fight for justice and equality. In the time it took for the verdict to be reached, there were already several high-profile police murders of Black people that sparked outrage and protests. Daunte Wright was murdered in Minneapolis, where the officer who murdered him allegedly confused a gun for a taser. Ma’Khia Bryant, a 16-year-old girl, was murdered by Columbus police. According to The New York Times, during the three weeks, the Chauvin trial took place, police officers killed more than three people a day. 
There are many in the country who will continue to justify the use of deadly force by saying that officers’ lives are in danger due to the nature of their job. While we understand this point, it would benefit those same people who justify extrajudicial killings to understand officers should be held to a higher standard than the people who are interacting with them, not the other way around. It is hard to maintain composure when there is a loaded gun to your face and a fear that the police officer may murder you. The police can not continue to function as judge, jury, and executioner, especially given the fact that these extrajudicial killings disproportionately impact Black people. 
This type of justification for extrajudicial killings is what leads to the police becoming a competing institution, where the formal rules and procedures can be flagrantly violated by police in the name of maintaining law and order. It is often used to describe police violence in countries such as Brazil and Argentina, but it is also apt to describe the police in the U.S. as a competing institution. There is massive corruption amongst the police. Police unions will defend officers for heinous crimes and charges, including attempts to omit the evidence in police brutality cases. The justice system has also given officers immunity from most lawsuits via qualified immunity, leaving victims of police brutality and their family members with little recourse. To make matters worse, many members of the general public will give police a pass for the use of deadly force. 
If another civilian hadn’t recorded Derek Chauvin murdering George Floyd on camera, Chauvin probably would have been acquitted for his murder. To go one step further, if it were not for the major protests and social media backlash related to the video of the murder, Chauvin probably would have been acquitted for his murder. Even then, the protests and backlash did not guarantee a guilty verdict. This is an indictment of the system more so than it is an indictment of Chauvin himself. No amount of training or policing reforms can fix the corruption and racial bias endemic to the police. 
Racism does not improve with time, it only adapts. Chauvin’s indictment is the mere beginning of addressing the perpetual injustice faced by the Black community. As we move forward, we have to demand a list of action items to be implemented that will begin to address the policing crisis and deep-seated racial biases in the U.S. We must abolish qualified immunity and bust police unions. We must shift responsibilities from the police and concentrate resources into more community-oriented solutions. We must ban police raids and demilitarize them. These are all surface-level solutions, but we must start somewhere to alleviate the suffering of the Black community and fix this systemic problem.
