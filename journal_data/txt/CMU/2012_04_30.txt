The Carnegie Mellon men’s track and field team finished out its season at the Dave Labor and Ed Fry Invitational meets on April 14 and 21, respectively.
At both meets, the athletes worked to improve their performances in preparation for the University Athletic Association (UAA) Championship meet, hosted by Carnegie Mellon this past weekend.
At the Dave Labor Invitational, hosted by Slippery Rock University, the men recorded three first-place finishes. First-year Thomas Vandenberg and sophomore Mike Standish competed in the 800-meter run, with Vandenberg coming in first with a time of 1:55.64.
“The freshman talent on the team this year is amazing. They’ve had some great performances so far this season,” Standish said.
The second victory was by another new face on the team, first-year Elliot Watson, who won the 3,000-meter steeplechase in 10:19.62. Senior Ryan Kissell carried the Tartans to its third first-place finish of the day in the long jump, with a mark of 6.23 meters. Kissell also placed second in the triple jump, with a distance of 12.59 meters.
The following weekend at the Ed Fry Invitational, hosted by Indiana University of Pennsylvania, the field events helped the Tartans to dominate the meet. Senior Anthony Hernandez came in second in the hammer toss, throwing a distance of 47.91 meters. Sophomore Nathan Cheek followed close behind in third place, with a mark of 45.67 meters.
With a distance of 15.00 meters, sophomore Zachary Erra-Hernandez finished fouth in the shot put. Junior Dan Cardenas Rivero came in fifth in the pole vault after clearing a height of 4.05 meters.
With numerous outstanding performances throughout the season, the Tartans hosted the UAA Championships this past weekend.
Athletes from all eight universities in the conference participated. The Tartans came in second place to the Washington University in St. Louis Bears. 
The Bears finished with 195.5 points and the Tartans finished with 149.5 points. The men’s track and field will be competing again on May 11 at Allegheny College.

The University Athletic Association (UAA) Championships were held this past weekend at Gesling Stadium. The women’s track and field team finished fifth out of seven teams with 62 points. Emory University came out as the victor of the UAA Championships with 226.5 points.
In addition to Emory University, Carnegie Mellon competed against the University of Chicago, New York University, Case Western Reserve University, Brandeis University, and Washington University in St. Louis. Rochester University was the only UAA school that did not participate in the competition.
After the first day on Saturday, Carnegie Mellon was in fifth place after competing in six scored events. The team ended the day with a total of 12 points.
Sophomore Samantha Oleson finished fourth in the hammer throw with a toss of 37.30 meters. Sophomore Jane Kim was sixth in the same event with a career-best throw of 34.88 meters.
In the 4x800 relay, the Tartans placed sixth with the team of first-year Halley Bayer, sophomore Catherine Paquette, first-year Erin Kiekhaefer, and junior Eva Humphrey. They crossed the finish line with a time of 10:14.54.
The second day of competition began at 9 a.m. on Sunday, with the women’s triple jump as the first event of the day. Senior Ivana Moses took sixth with a distance of 10.78 meters. She also placed fifth in the 100-meter dash with a time of 12.70, a career best for Moses.
First-year Sasha Spalding took fourth in the 400-meter run with a time of 59.39.
In the 4x100 relay, sophomore Jacqueline Guevel, Moses, first-year Stephanie Chen, and Spalding placed fourth with a school record of 49.92. Guevel also took first in the 100-meter hurdles. This is her second consecutive year finishing first in the event at UAAs. She won this year with a time of 14.68.
Additionally, Guevel was second in the 400-meter hurdles, finishing with a season-best time of 1:01.94.

Sophomore Ian Bangor was the winner of the Tartans’ Spring Invitational last Thursday, shooting a one-over-par 71 at the Longue Vue Club. This win is Bangor’s sixth, becoming the Carnegie Mellon all-time wins leader. Since Bangor has a few years at Carnegie Mellon, there are still plenty of chances left for him to add to that total.
“Ian [Bangor] has been a terrific contribution to this golf team. I can see him stepping up and taking control of this team,” said sophomore teammate Matt Wilson.
The golf team finished second at the event, scoring 309 behind California University of Pennsylvania, which scored a team round of 294. The Tartans had five competitors in the field. Washington and Jefferson University, St. Vincent College, and Grove City College also competed at the invitational.
Seniors Terence Einhorn and Michael Cheng scored rounds of 75 and 80, respectively. This was the last round of their college careers. Einhorn placed fifth in the event with his round of 75.
First-year Cameron Low scored a round of 83 and sophomore Grant Strimel was close behind with 85.
The Tartans had an additional six golfers compete individually in the event. First-year Justin Fischler led that group with a round of 80. Sophomore Alex Fry carded an 82. First-year Derek Cobb and Wilson stroked an 83 and an 86, respectively.
The last two competitors were junior Jisoo Park and first-year Austin Cheng; Park scored 88 and Cheng shot a 91.
“I was disappointed with the team results at the end of the season, but we learned a lot,” Einhorn said. “Hopefully, the experiences gained through struggle will be paramount in times of success.”
This invitational concluded the Tartans’ 2011–12 golf season. Practices will begin again in the fall of 2012.

America’s obsession with the NFL cannot be quenched. Even the NFL draft, the yearly selection of college football juniors and seniors by NFL teams, has become a three-day primetime event. It’s an easy example of our culture’s football overload, but the draft is also a key time for teams to rebuild for their future.
When a team is as old and injury prone as the Pittsburgh Steelers, it is critical to find young, healthy, and productive players in all rounds of the draft. How well a team executes this goal can be the difference between creating a dynasty and becoming the league’s laughing stock. While it’s impossible to know if a player will reach his full potential, coaches and managers can still break down each player and evaluate him on what they believe players’ careers could and should become.
The Steelers came into the draft needing to fill four big holes in its roster: offensive guard, offensive tackle, linebacker, and defensive lineman. In the first four rounds of the draft, the Steelers went right down this list, picking the best possible players.
With their first pick, the Steelers selected offensive guard David DeCastro out of Stanford University.
The Steelers had a lot of trouble last year trying to field a healthy offensive line, resulting in quarterback Ben Roethlisberger getting injured. DeCastro, who is regarded as the top guard in the draft, should be a starter in the beginning of the season to provide the interior protection on the line that Big Ben was missing last season.
In the second round, the Steelers took troubled offensive tackle Mike Adams out of Ohio State University. Adams was considered to be first-round talent until he failed a drug test, testing positive for marijuana. 
Steelers managers have several contract stipulations in place to ensure he cleans up his act and to protect the team if he does not. Adams, regardless of his personal issues, is a fantastic player. With him, DeCastro, and third-year center Maurkice Pouncey, the Steelers have the young core of an offensive team that could protect Roethlisberger for years to come.
With their third-round pick, the Steelers took linebacker Sean Spence from the University of Miami in order to fill the hole created by cutting linebacker James Farrior. Spence is a versatile linebacker who can play outside and inside linebacker, in addition to having a quick first step.
The main reason Spence fell in the draft is the concern about his size, only measuring 5'11". The Steelers have  historically been able to maximize the play from its undersized linebackers with star linebacker James Harrison, who only measures 6 feet.
In the fourth round, the Steelers hopefully found nose tackle Casey Hampton’s eventual replacement in defensive tackle Alameda Ta’amu from the University of Washington. Ta’amu is a big guy who routinely took on double teams in college and won. He has some trouble defending the pass, given his lack of speed, but he can completely shut down the running game. Hopefully, Ta’amu will develop under Hampton’s tutelage and take over if Hampton gets injured or eventually retires.
The Steelers spent the rest of the draft creating depth and finding a couple of players who could contribute in small niche roles next season. In the fifth round, the Steelers took running back Chris Rainey from the University of Florida to switch things up in the backfield.
In the seventh round, the Steelers had four picks. First they selected wide receiver Toney Clemons out of the University of Colorado Boulder to eventually become a middle receiver. Next was tight end David Paulson from the University of Oregon. Paulson is expected to compete for the backup job behind starting tight end Heath Miller. 
Finally, the Steelers took players from the state of Texas. They took cornerback Terrence Frederick from Texas A&M University and offensive tackle Kelvin Beachum from Southern Methodist University; both Frederick and Beachum are expected to compete for backup roles at their respective positions.
Overall, the Steelers did not move up but stayed put and selected a group of players who can come in and contribute to the team from day one.
This draft class has the opportunity to become the foundation for the future, as well as help the Steelers make another deep playoff push in the upcoming 2012 NFL season.

This weekend, the No. 4-ranked Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team competed in the University Athletic Association (UAA) Championship at Sanlando Park in Altamonte Springs, Fla.
On Friday, the Tartans took on the Case Western Reserve University Spartans in the quarterfinals. On the back of a commanding doubles sweep, the Tartans went on to win 7–2.
At No. 2 doubles, first-years Chelsea Motie and Byrn Raschke won 8–2, while sophomore Katie Cecil and senior Cze-Ja Tam at No. 3 swept their match as well. Seniors Laura Chen and Courtney Chin at No. 1 doubles had a slightly tougher time, needing a tiebreaker to beat their competition 9–8 (7–4).
In singles play, Chen at No. 2 and Motie at No. 3 both put up dominating performances; they won in straight sets 6–2, 6–0 and 6–0, 6–2, respectively. Cecil was unstoppable, not losing a game in her 6–0, 6–0 sweep at No. 1 singles. First-year Clare Dubrin at No. 6 singles had the next Tartan victory of the day, winning after a tie-break third set 1–6, 6–0, 1–0 (10–5).
On Saturday, the Tartans took on No. 6-ranked University of Chicago in the UAA semifinals.
The team could not carry its momentum over from Friday, and mostly looked tired falling 8–1.
The Tartans’ lone win came from Cecil at No. 1 singles, who won her hard-fought match 4–6, 6–0, 1–0 (10–3).
The women’s tennis team played again on Sunday to battle for the third place spot in the UAA Championships. They faced the No. 11-ranked Washington University, and ultimately lost 5–4.
The Tartans had a slow start in the matches, going down 2–1. The only win for the Tartans was from the No. 3 doubles team of Cecil and Tam, with a score of 8–1.
The Tartans tried to battle back in singles with wins at No. 4 and No. 5 singles 6–2, 6–4 by Chin and first-year Angela Pratt, respectively.
The fourth win came from Chen with a 6–7 (5–7), 6–0, 6–2 victory at No. 2 singles.
The team now awaits its National Collegiate Athletic Association regional assignments. The Tartans hope to host regionals as well.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team travelled down to Altamonte Springs, Fla., to compete in the University Athletic Association (UAA) Championships. This is the first year that the men’s and women’s UAAs have been hosted at this venue.
The No. 13-ranked Tartans had a slow start on Thursday morning, facing New York University. The men took the lead 2–1 after doubles. Wins came from the No. 2 team of junior Jooho Yu and first-year Thomas Cooper 8–4, and the No 3. first-year duo of Christian Heaney-Secord and Bryce Beisswanger 8–3. The Tartans’ No. 1 team of junior Duke Miller and first-year William Duncan lost in a tiebreaker 9–8 (7–3).
In single’s play, the matches were even tighter. Cooper was the first win for the Tartans at No. 5 with scores of 6–0, 6–1. The next singles victory was from Miller at No. 1, winning his three set battle 7–6 (7–1), 3–6, 6–1. With the match tied at 4–4, Yu was the only player left to compete. Yu won the match for the Tartans 5–7, 6–3, 6–1, helping move Carnegie Mellon on to the semifinals.
In the semifinals, the Tartans faced the No. 17-ranked Washington University in St. Louis. The Tartans lost this match in a closely competed game, 5–4.
The Tartans jumped out of the gates, leading 3–0 after doubles. Duncan and Miller won at No. 1 doubles, 8–4. The No. 2 doubles tandem of Cooper and Yu were next off the court with an 8–4 victory. Rounding out the doubles was the Tartans’ No. 3 team of Beisswanger and Heaney-Secord, with a tiebreaker win 9–8 (10–8).
However, the Tartans struggled in singles play. Cooper was the only Tartan to pull out a win at No. 5 singles, with a score of 6–3, 6–2.
In the third place match, the Tartans faced Case Western Reserve University. The Tartans took home the fourth place trophy with a 6–3 loss to Case Western.
“It was a tough loss. I feel mostly for our captain. We really wanted to give him a chance to come out and compete at NCAAs,” Heaney-Secord said.
The Tartans took a 2–1 lead after doubles with a win from the No. 2 team of Cooper and Yu by a score of 8–6. The other doubles point came from the tiebreaker victory by the No. 1 team of Duncan and Miller, winning 9–8 (7–4).
Again, the Tartans were only able to win one other match. Duncan won at No. 3 singles 6–3, 6–4.
“The guys battled hard like they have all season. We had the best doubles in the tournament and the losses weren’t due to lack of heart. Thomas Cooper was a beast,” said volunteer assistant coach Jonathan Spero.

After finishing 5–1 in the University Athletic Association (UAA) Championships, first-year Thomas Cooper of the Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team was able to spare a few moments to talk about his career as a college athlete.
The Tartan: What is your major?
Thomas Cooper: One of my most popular nicknames is Teppy T, short for Tepper Tom. ’Nuff said.
T: What are you looking to do in the future?
C: I hope to grow up into a responsible and mature adult who makes a positive difference in the lives of others. I also hope to help establish world peace throughout the four corners of the globe. You know, the whole “make love, not war” thing.
T: What do you enjoy most about the tennis team?
C: Several of the things I enjoy most about the tennis team include team trips, intra-team camaraderie, getting a toned and tan body, and most of all, spending time with the wonderful Lady Tarts — our girls team.
T: What has been your proudest moment?
C: My proudest moment on the team was seeing Big Chris [first-year Christian Heaney-Secord] grow up before my eyes during the North Carolina Weslyan match. I felt like a mother bird watching her chick spread its wings for the first time as he gutted out an intense three-set match to propel us to victory.
T: What are your goals for next season?
C: We want to bring a National Championship to the ’Burgh. First and foremost, we would like to compete within the school for the highest GPA of any team. This is a top priority for my fellow mathletes, like myself.
T: What has been your funniest moment on the team?
C: One of the funniest moments of my season was trying to wake up Julian Pearlman on spring break. The poor kid needed a Red Bull so bad, all he could do was lay in his cot and groan until team captain Jeremy “The Asian Invasion” King pounced on him, pummeling him with pillows and forcing him out of his sloth-like attitude.
T: What is your favorite food to pig out on with the team?
C: As a team, we take great pride to “eat to compete.” Myself and the other freshmen have a tradition of going to Schatz one night a week after practice. This particular night of the week is often the most dreaded weekly endeavor for all parties involved. I suppose the reason we continue to go can best be summed up by a wise Carnegie Mellon tennis alumni, who asked to remain anonymous upon social grounds. He said, “The Schatz train only has one stop, and once you’re on that train, you gotta take it all the way to the end of the line. That end of the line is the cemetery.”
T: What do you like to do on road trips?
C: We really enjoy quiet conversations and getting to know each other on a more intimate level. There exists a heated rivalry among the team in the game Catch Phrase. Personally, I also really enjoy instigating arguments with ol’ Bill Duncan [first-year William Duncan]. It is fun to push his buttons and get him all riled up, only to bring him down to my level of intelligence and beat him with experience.
T: What do you find most rewarding about being a Carnegie Mellon athlete?
C: I love the varsity weight room. I often find the amount of weight in the public gyms is simply not enough. I am also flattered by the recognition and popularity that being a tennis player brings. The sheer amount of spectators that come to watch us play really validates all the hard work we put in.

And then there were 16. The 2012 NBA Playoffs, after the shortened regular season which seemed to dash to the finish line, are now here. Since each team needs 16 wins to receive an NBA title, the playoffs feel like a whole new season. The long journey to the precipice of the best league in the world began last Saturday. But let’s talk first-round predictions. I’m sorry to inform you, but I don’t see any upsets happening in the first round.
Eastern Conference:
No. 1 Chicago Bulls vs. No. 8 Philadelphia 76ers
This may be the hardest match-up to predict. Since the Bulls’ point guard Derrick Rose tore his left ACL with just 1:10 left in the first victory over the 76ers, this first-seed vs. eighth-seed battle could be closer than initially thought. However, the Bulls have played with Rose injured throughout the season, going 17–9 with the reigning MVP on the pine. The 76ers, who got off to a hot start and on pace to win the Atlantic Division in the East, limped to the finish line and fell to the eighth seed. The team is led by shooting guard Andre Iguodala and has explosive play off the bench from point guard Lou Williams and small forward Thaddeus Young. This is a must-watch series that will go deep, but I give the Bulls the advantage: Bulls in seven.
No. 4 Boston Celtics vs. No. 5 Atlanta Hawks
The Celtics looked like an ancient artifact from when they won the championship in 2008. But the team played stellar basketball post All-Star Game, with shooting guard Ray Allen coming off the bench, although head coach Doc Rivers says he is 50/50 for the start of the playoffs. The Hawks come into the playoffs with the same team it has taken to the playoffs the last four years, led by small forward Joe Johnson and power forward Josh Smith. Well, the same except for All-Star center Al Horford. However, the Hawks have a knack for losing to experienced teams in the playoffs: Celtics in seven.
No. 3 Indiana Pacers vs. No. 6 Orlando Magic
The Pacers are my dark horse team to win the East. It is the deepest team in the conference, with six players averaging double figures in points and eight players averaging more than nine points per game. With the Magic’s center Dwight Howard out with a back injury, Pacers center Roy Hibbert may be the best center in the Eastern Conference. He has led the Pacers’ rebound to fourth in the league. Head coach Frank Vogel has made a great case for Coach of the Year and has his team in great shape heading into the first round. The Magic is heavily dependent on the defense Howard brings to the table. Without him, I don’t think the Magic can do much damage: Pacers in five. 
No. 2 Miami Heat vs. No. 7 New York Knicks
If the first game was any indication, the Heat should handle this series. Most expect the Heat to dominate this entire conference, as it is without Rose and Howard. But the matchup between Heat’s small forward Lebron James and Knicks’ small forward Carmelo Anthony is intriguing. Fantasy nerds will relish this: The first playoff matchup between these two superstars of the 2003 draft class. Forget about all the other superstars in this series, it is all about James and Anthony going head-to-head. But in the end, this series won’t be close and the Heat will dominate just as people expect: Heat in five. 
Western Conference:
No. 1 San Antonio Spurs vs. No. 8 Utah Jazz
Although the Jazz is reputable for the scrappy, tough, and sometimes overly-aggressive play typical of playoff-style basketball, this series will be all Spurs. The Spurs, who typically wear other teams down with its defense, have made it to the top of the Western Conference with its offense, led by point guard Tony Parker. Despite losing in last year’s first round to the eighth-seed Memphis Grizzlies, Spurs coach Gregg Popovich won’t let that happen again. Spurs power forward Tim Duncan will go for his fifth title, and the Jazz will have no answer for this team: Spurs in four.
No. 4 Memphis Grizzlies vs. No. 5 Los Angeles Clippers
It is no surprise that the fourth-seed vs. fifth-seed match-up is the most compelling. The Clippers were the center of media attention when the team brought in All-Star point guard Chris Paul; the Clippers claimed the nickname “Lob City” from Paul’s exceptional passing combined with power forward Blake Griffin’s insane hops. When guard Chauncey Billups went down with an Achilles tear on Feb. 8, the Clippers seemed to be struggling. But if Griffin can learn to play through the hard fouls he seems to always attract, the team can win this series. However, I like the Grizzlies in this series. The Grizzlies are the Pacers of the Western Conference, as they also have six players averaging double-digit points per game. Led by Rudy Gay, I think the depth of the Grizzlies will be too much for the Clippers’ mediocre defense: Grizzlies in seven.
No. 3 Los Angeles Lakers vs. No. 6 Denver Nuggets
Lakers shooting guard Kobe Bryant begins his journey alongside power forward Pau Gasol in search of his sixth NBA Championship. After another great season by Bryant, the Lakers look poised to make a deep run in the playoffs. Bryant is well rested, sitting out eight of the Lakers’ last 10 games, which will be key to winning a playoff series. Additionally, taking advantage of the size and skill Gasol and center Andrew Bynum bring to the table will almost certainly secure a first round series win. But sometimes the Lakers shy away from that game plan, and the Nuggets can do some serious damage with their run-and-gun style. The Nuggets led the NBA in scoring, averaging 104.1 points per game. The team’s speed and depth could cause the older and slower Lakers a lot of trouble. However, on the back of Bryant, I don’t see the experienced Lakers falling in the first round: Lakers in six.
No. 2 Oklahoma City Thunder vs. No. 7 Dallas Mavericks
The reigning three-time scoring champion small forward Kevin Durant and point guard Russell Westbrook may be the best perimeter player combination in the Western Conference. But after last year’s playoffs, I cannot immediately count out power forward Dirk Nowitzki’s Mavericks. His ability to catch fire and rain threes is a serious concern for the Thunder, which doesn’t have a matchup for him. But the Mavericks can’t match up with Westbrook at point guard. This series will be close, and even though the Mavericks are superior decision makers in the fourth quarter, the reigning champs will be out in round one: Thunder in six.

Bacterial infections like E. coli, salmonella, listeria, and staph are culprits for millions of fatalities each year. Viral pathogens like HIV and SARS are an increasing threat to public health, with the World Health Organization estimating that over 30 million people are living with HIV and more than 2 million new cases are emerging annually. At one time, humans may have had the capability to be immune to such diseases.
Today, researchers at Carnegie Mellon are searching through evolutionary history to produce a lost peptide that could fight these human pathogens once more. Associate chemistry professor Danith Ly recently led a breakthrough in synthetic peptide manufacturing that may help pave a path toward fighting HIV, SARS, and dangerous bacterial infections.
Peptides are fairly small chains of amino acids coded by DNA. They are of particular interest to pharmaceutical corporations because they are easily created and can have diverse formations with a relatively small number of chemical blocks. But a peptide’s shining quality is also its major drawback: The molecule’s flimsy nature and its inability to bind makes it nearly impossible to work with in a laboratory setting.
The problem has interested Ly for decades.
“I always thought in the back of my mind that I wanted to solve this problem,” Ly said. “It has been around for the last 40 years or so; a lot of people have talked about trying to develop peptides for therapeutic [purposes].”
The natural world has created an alternative to combat this problem by creating cyclic peptides. 
“We found that nature has done an amazing thing in the past 85 million years or so,” Ly said. With their seemingly circular, knotted structures, the cyclic peptides are stronger, more rigid versions of their flimsy cousins.
“They have disulfide bridges that are connecting the strands together similar to a bicycle wheel. They have these reinforcements,” Ly said. “You can take this peptide, put it in water, heat to boiling, and the conformation remains rigid because everything is stitched in place.”
The cyclic peptide of interest was RTD-1, a peptide that was found in humans until some 9 million years ago, when a mutated gene eventually eradicated the body’s ability to recognize the peptide’s existence. Today, it naturally occurs in plants and some primates, like baboons and rhesus monkeys. The peptide has the ability to invade the cell wall and destroy invading bacteria.
Although RTD-1 had been isolated in the lab before, Ly explained that doing so is a tedious and difficult process. The complex bonds between the peptides call for large quantities of pure chemicals in the lab. In working with RTD-1, Ly and his team were searching for an alternative binding method that would make the peptide easy to produce without compromising its potent effect on pathogens.
A solution, it appears, had already existed. Understanding that the code for RTD-1 had once been in the human genome, Ly proposed that the peptide could be structured with hydrogen bonds found in human DNA.
In the lab, the team was able to piece together a synthetic RTD-1 peptide — which they called RTD-1M — with the hydrogen bonds. Then, they tested their Frankenstein peptide against four bacteria: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella typhimurium.
Their analysis showed that RTD-1M, like the natural RTD-1, could prove effective against all four bacteria.
Because of the unique way peptides fight bacterial cells, they have very promising effects in medical treatment. Antibiotics, unlike peptides, can easily become ineffective on mutated bacteria.
“That is very important, because these pathogens rapidly mutate,” Ly said, “so even if you take some of the most potent antibiotic today, if you were to continue taking this antibiotic for a period of six months to one year, eventually it’s going to develop a resistance.” Ly explained that even if the bacteria had become resistant to the antibiotic, its cell wall would still succumb to the peptide. The peptide, in essence, has the possibility to overcome resistance.
As for viral infections like HIV, research has shown that the peptide is effective at stopping the disease from spreading. Scientists, however, are still trying to figure out how it works. According to Ly, researchers who have incubated cells with RTD-1 and HIV have shown that the effectiveness of HIV is significantly reduced.
Looking to the future, Ly hopes that he can further pursue this promising area of research. He is excited by the potential synthetic peptides could have in developing countries as well as in America.
“The long-term goal is to develop these things for the developed country to use, but also for the poor and the underdeveloped regions, so if we can make this thing for the cost of a dollar per pop or something, maybe less — that would be useful, I think,” Ly said.
Ly is pursuing funding for similar future projects. His research currently points toward a new way of thinking about medication.
“I think the main take-home lesson is that we could make this thing extremely cheap, and it has the potential to not develop resistance because of the mechanism of binding and the structure of the bacteria, as compared to small-molecule drugs,” Ly said.

Stress is no stranger to Carnegie Mellon students, and unfortunately in today’s society, stress is prevalent in many people’s lives. Faced with this issue, a team of researchers at Carnegie Mellon recently found a direct correlation between increased psychological stresses and a decrease in the body’s ability to cope with disease.
The team, led by psychology professor Sheldon Cohen, observed that an increase in stress levels led to increased levels of a hormone called cortisol, which has been studied and identified as a stress-related hormone. 
Scientists understand that cortisol plays an important role in various daily functions as it circulates in the bloodstream, so increased levels of the hormone could have adverse effects on the body.
The study, recently published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of the Sciences, focused on how increased levels of cortisol contributed to the body’s reduced ability to fight off disease.
Cohen’s group found that stress increased the symptoms of inflammatory diseases such as the common cold, cardiovascular disease, and asthma. Symptoms caused by these diseases like sneezing, coughing, and runny nose happen when the immune system responds in excess to the disease pathogens. Cohen said that his team “aimed to understand why stressed people were more likely to experience the symptoms caused by these diseases.”
The human body’s immune system is a massive network that produces and disperses chemicals needed to fight disease. With inflammatory diseases, the immune system releases pro-inflammatory proteins called cytokines that go to the area of the infection and orchestrate the immune response. The key to fighting diseases is to have just the right amount of these pro-inflammatory proteins. When there are too many, that’s when symptoms appear.
Cortisol plays a large role in regulating the amount of cytokines present to fight the infection. Cohen’s team found that under stress, the immune cells cannot interact with cortisol, preventing the regulation of cytokines. Therefore, highly stressed people will have unregulated production of cytokines, leading to a weaker immune system.
Cohen’s team included researchers from the University of Pittsburgh, who carried out interviews with adult participants of the study to understand what levels of stress they were experiencing. Cohen explained that their stress analysis interviews were intensive and questioned participants about “major events over the last year of their lives and considered how threatening these events would be to an average person.” These interviews were key in drawing the link between stress and immune response.
“We had been trying to do this [research] for a long time,” Cohen said, “but this time we really nailed the pathway.” Cohen and his team found the study extremely rewarding because they believe their results “can be applied to a broad range of diseases.”

Daniel Eisenstein of Harvard University gave the annual Buhl Lecture in the Mellon Institute auditorium last Tuesday, discussing “Dark Energy and Cosmic Sound.” Eisenstein is a professor of astronomy at Harvard and is the director of the third phase of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Much of his work has explored baryon acoustic oscillations in the early universe, the phenomenon referred to as “cosmic sound” in the talk’s title.
The Buhl Lecture is an annual event held by the physics department in which a recognized physicist speaks on a current topic in physics at a level geared toward a broader audience, according to the event’s website. Past guest speakers have discussed quantum computing, dark matter, and microbiology, among other topics. Current Secretary of Energy Steven Chu spoke on single molecule biology in 2003.
Provost Mark Kamlet introduced Tuesday’s talk, which attracted about 200 students, faculty, and community members to the Mellon Institute. This year marks the 17th lecture since the Buhl series was restarted in 1996. Mellon College of Science Dean Fred Gilman, who holds the Buhl chair in the physics department, introduced Eisenstein.
Eisenstein’s lecture progressed from broad historical questions on the nature of the expansion of the universe into progressively more specialized results from recently acquired data. He began with a short introduction to the idea of dark energy, the substance required to cause the universe to expand at measured rates.
Understanding the rate of expansion of the universe involves precise measurements of the rate of movement and position of other celestial objects moving away from Earth. The difficulty of determining these cosmic distances was one of the themes of Eisenstein’s lecture.
Imagine you want to determine the distance to a star you see in the sky. To you, two stars might appear equally bright, but one star might be dimmer and closer while the other is brighter but farther away. This problem applies to larger-scale structures as well, such as galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Astronomers therefore try to find consistent events and structures they can use as “standard candles” or “standard rulers” that aid in measuring distances anywhere in the universe. 
An example of a standard candle is a Type Ia supernova, which has a known and very consistent brightness. When supernovae are observed from Earth, the distance can be calculated based on the difference in apparent luminosity with the known light curve.
Eisenstein focused on a standard ruler that he helped develop. Baryon acoustic oscillations, he explained, are visible patterns in the density of matter in the modern universe, caused by events that happened when the universe was only 400,000 years old. The patterns have features that repeat every 490 million light years, allowing astronomers to determine distances at large scales.
The final part of Eisenstein’s talk discussed results from the SDSS and how they related to earlier theoretical predictions.
“The problem [with large-scale theoretical models],” Eisenstein said, “is that you need a lot of data.” 
The SDSS has provided much of this data, and SDSS-III has a survey dedicated to studying baryon acoustic oscillations, the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). It maps distant cosmic objects like quasars to test theories about the early. Eisenstein explained that data gathered by the BOSS thus far matches the predictions made by baryon acoustic oscillation theory.
As the third phase of the SDSS continues over the next two years, the BOSS and three other sky surveys aim to create an even more complete picture of the universe. It is these data sets that help Eisenstein and his colleagues to more precisely answer questions about the early universe and its continued expansion, helping us better understand the world we live in.

The recent threat of heavy snow may seem like odd weather for late April. Although the prediction of snow in Pittsburgh fell through, more than two feet of snow fell about 70 miles away in Laurel Summit, Pa., according to The Washington Post. The culprit? A weather system called a nor’easter, a type of storm that typically passes through the East Coast and quickly drops large amounts of rain and snow.
Nor’easters generally occur where moisture and cold air are abundant. They are cyclones that resemble hurricanes and create hurricane-level winds. In coastal regions, the winds generate huge surfs that can result in beach erosion, cause coastal flooding, and make surfers wait in anticipation. 
Nor’easters get their name from the direction of their winds. According to Howstuffworks.com, “A nor’easter is named for the winds that blow in from the northeast and drive the storm up the East Coast along the Gulf Stream, a band of warm water that lies off the Atlantic coast.”
A nor’easter begins its life as a low pressure air system with counterclockwise winds; this can be found in the Gulf coast winds that start off the coast of Florida. The system circulates along the coast from Florida and moves upward, essentially being pushed by the Gulf Stream, gaining warm air and moisture from the Atlantic Ocean as heavy northeastern winds push the system up the East Coast.
Another key element in the formation of a nor’easter is a high pressure system with winds that move cold air down from the Arctic. The winds of the nor’easter collide with the cold Arctic winds, and since cold air is heavier than warm air, the cold air acts as a wedge and causes the warm moist air to rise and form precipitation like rain and snow.
During East Coast winters, nor’easters are quite common. However, only some have the momentum to generate enough precipitation and wind to cause problems on land. The converging point of the low pressure and high pressure systems is the location where the most heavy precipitation and snowfall occur, lessening as one moves further away.
There are two general types of nor’easters. Offshore-forming nor’easters refer to storms that move east from the East Coast. They result in heavy snowfall and precipitation and eventually get blown off the East Coast from the Canadian jet stream up north. Onshore-forming nor’easters move west from the East Coast, resulting in large amounts of rain and winds but not as heavy as those in offshore-forming nor’easters.
During a nor’easter, thick, dark, low-level clouds often block out the sun. Even after the storm passes, the dark clouds linger for several days. Temperatures fall significantly due to the cool air from the northeastern winds. During the storm, all types of precipitation can occur, including rain, snow, and hail. The high wind gusts can also reach hurricane level and even gain a small eye, much like that of a hurricane.
Depending on the severity of the storm, airports, major highways, and interstates often get shut down for a few days. Power failures often occur as electrical wiring gets disrupted due to high winds, ice, and snow.
In the U.S., the area from Virginia to the New England coast, Quebec, and Atlantic Canada are prone to nor’easters, which often occur in the winter and early spring. Although the season matters for the formation of the cold core of a nor’easter, more important are the right conditions, namely the high and low pressure collision.

Consuming berries is ‘berry good’ for your brain
Researchers at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston recently found that women who ate berries frequently over a period of a few years showed less decrease in brain function than women who consumed berries less frequently. The team surveyed 16,000 women in their 50s and 60s about their eating habits and had them complete a series of cognitive tests when the women reached their 70s. Information about the women’s education, income, and other socioeconomic factors that may affect cognitive functioning were considered in the analysis.
The findings showed that women who consumed berries at least once a week were able to prolong their normal cognitive functioning by 1.5 to 2.5 years. The cognitive benefits of eating berries is not an entirely new finding, but past studies only involved animals and a small number of people.

Potential biological cure for ‘concrete cancer’
A team of engineers at Northumbria University in Newcastle, England, are developing a technique of healing cracks in concrete and preventing further cracks from developing. The trick? Bacteria.
Alan Richardson, senior lecturer in construction at Northumbria University, uses a species of ground-borne bacteria called bacillus megaterium that can feed off yeast, urea, and minerals present in concrete. Once the bacteria consumes the nutrients, it breeds and spreads throughout the concrete, blocking pores, filling cracks, and preventing further deterioration from occurring. Richardson hopes that this technique could be the future cure for “concrete cancer,” which is caused by the swelling and breaking of concrete which does billions of dollars of damage to buildings.

MIT researchers create dust- and dirt-repelling glass
Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have developed a technique for producing glass that prevents fogging and glare and resists dirt and water. The glass surface contains tiny nanotextures that interact with light in a way that yields no glare. The nanotextures are also able to repel water, dust, and dirt, keeping the surface of the glass clean.
The team hopes that the glass can eventually be produced inexpensively and used in common applications like smartphone and television screens, as well as car windshields. Even solar panels, the team argues, could significantly benefit from this technology since they can lose efficiency over time as their glass surfaces accumulate dirt and hinders their ability absorb energy from the sun.

Thinking in foreign tongues yields more rational decisions
A recent study shows that thinking through a problem in a non-native language leads to more rational decision-making. In one experiment in the study, researchers gave participants $15 each. For $1, they could bet on a coin toss. If they won, they received an additional $1.50, but if they lost, they received nothing. Statistically, the researchers explained, the participants would have made money in the experiment if they always chose to bet.
The team found that when the native English speakers were given instructions in Spanish, they chose to bet more often than participants who were given instructions in English. The researchers concluded that a foreign language has less emotional resonance; those instructed in English likely focused on the fear of losing each bet, while those instructed in Spanish reacted less emotionally.

Warm ocean water chipping away at Antarctica’s ice
Most of the ice being lost from the Antarctic ice sheet is a result of warm ocean water eating away at the edges of the continent, according to a recent study. The team, led by the British Antarctic Survey, used a satellite laser to track the size and movement of the outer edges of the continent, which consist of ice shelves that jut out over the ocean waters.
The team found that the shrinking of the ice shelves could not be explained by the presence of warm air alone. Instead, they concluded that warm ocean water is likely melting the ice sheets from below. The scientists explained that this finding could significantly affect estimates of sea-level rise due to the loss of Antarctic ice loss induced by a warming climate.

Study finds specific cells in birds’ brains aid in navigation
Researchers at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas recently identified cells in pigeons’ brains that allow birds to map out Earth’s magnetic field, which the birds utilize in their navigation. The team found evidence that the cells in the birds’ brains record information about the strength and direction of the magnetic field, and that the information is likely coming from the birds’ inner ears.
The basic steps of how birds navigate by magnetism were generally known beforehand, but the details of how and where that information was recorded within the birds’ brains had been unknown.

Since the 2008 release of director Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight, fans have been anticipating the third and final film in The Dark Knight trilogy. With the announcement that The Dark Knight Rises would film in Pittsburgh, local excitement has especially been high. Now the film is out, and fans are finally able to see the conclusion to this epic series.
Eight years in the story have passed since The Dark Knight. In that time, Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) has become a recluse, abandoning the role of Gotham City's guardian. However, with the arrival of a new villain, the rough and immensely powerful Bane (played by Tom Hardy), Wayne takes up the mantle of Batman once again. The film also features the thief Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) — known as Catwoman in Batman lore but never referred to as such in the movie — as she becomes intrinsically tied to Gotham’s underground criminals and the Caped Crusader who fights them.
Nolan delivers a satisfying ending to the best superhero film franchise yet. The primary strength of the director's take on Batman is his ability to give the characters more depth than those in previous Batman films. Behind the blockbuster action sequences and the cool gadgets is a strong, modern character drama.
The task of bringing these characters to life falls on the actors and actresses, of course. While comparisons between the Hardy's Bane and Heath Ledger's Joker from The Dark Knight are inevitable, it’s unfair to debate about who is the better villain, as they serve different purposes. While Ledger’s Joker remains the best performance in the Batman trilogy, Hardy plays both the brute and the tactician masterfully. He is a smart, imposing villain that works well within the story.
Where it came together, though, was in Bale’s performance. In his third time around, he did more for the character than in either of the previous two films. In The Dark Knight Rises, Wayne's journey to become Gotham's protector comes to represent the message of the entire trilogy.
For Carnegie Mellon students and Pittsburgh residents alike, the film is especially exciting thanks to the scenes filmed on campus and in Downtown. Seeing familiar locations serve as the backdrop for much of the film's action adds to the appeal. But this also has its downsides, as some may find themselves taken out of Gotham's story at the sight of the Mellon Institute.
The Dark Knight Rises is not without its flaws. One of the more noticeable problems is clarity of dialogue: Due to the breathing apparatus he wears throughout the film, Bane’s dialogue is consistently muffled, and other characters frequently mutter their lines. While improvements were made to the voice from the original trailers, it is still difficult at times to understand Hardy.
Another issue with the film is that Wayne’s romantic life in this film is awkwardly tacked onto the main story. Wayne’s relationship with Rachel Dawes (played by Katie Holmes in Batman Begins and Maggie Gyllenhaal in The Dark Knight) in the first two movies pushed his character forward and gave the film extra depth. The romantic storyline in this film, however, is nowhere near as necessary or effective.
However, these issues are minor compared to what the film achieves. Trilogies are notoriously difficult to do well — often the execution falters by the third film (here’s looking at you, Spider-man), and the entire series feels somewhat tarnished by it. However, The Dark Knight Rises achieves poignancy and resolution, and solidifies the Batman trilogy as one of the greatest superhero film series. The conclusion is one of the best possible outcomes for a franchise that fans have loved, and will be cherished for years to come.

In the middle of a raging winter storm, two cowboys, a pedophilic professor, and a saucy showgirl get off a stranded bus, forced to stay the night in a small Kansas diner.
Thus begins the School of Drama’s production of Bus Stop, a play written in 1955 that tells the story of a few eccentric people in an enclosed space who cross paths and are ultimately forced to evaluate their own identities in the process. Bus Stop, which opened last Thursday, is a rich adaptation of a thoughtful play, brought to life by the acting of skilled drama students.
The set for the production is eerie. The ghostly skeleton of a bus-like structure dominates the stage; whole chunks of the shell of the bus have apparently cracked off, leaving only the bus’ metal ribcage visible in places. The unsettling sight of the ghost-bus, surrounded by tufts of withered brown reeds and covered with a fine layer of snow, creates a chilling and mysterious mood. As the audience’s first exposure to the play, the set captures viewers’ attention as they wait for the actors to appear onstage.
As the characters stumble off the bus and into the diner, it becomes clear that each embodies a specific and familiar stereotype: The naïve high school girl, the laconic sheriff, and the egotistical professor, to name a few. But over the course of the play, many of these stereotypes are stripped away as they prove to be no more than superficial labels.
Only skilled actors could have successfully portrayed the depth of these characters; eight talented drama students rose to the challenge. Senior acting major Annie Heise stands out in her sophisticated performance of Cherie, an impatient blonde-wigged showgirl who demands protection from the infatuated but violent cowboy who coerced her onto the bus.
Although the Cherie we first meet is indignant and cynical, Heise’s performance allows the audience to watch this steely character slowly thaw and melt. Over the course of the play, Cherie sheds her hardened exterior and reveals a sensitive and hopelessly romantic girl underneath.
Senior acting major Adrian Blake Enscoe depicts a similar progression in his character Bo Decker, Cherie’s mean and rough abductor. Despite Bo’s initially violent treatment of Cherie, the audience soon learns that underneath this exterior lies a socially clueless and love-struck boy — a much more pitiable character than the angry cowboy who first saunters onstage. Enscoe shows his versatility as an actor in his ability to portray the rude, aggressive cowboy as well as the more innocent side of his character.
Heise and Enscoe’s performances are not alone in their excellent portrayals of complex characters. Each of the characters adds personality to the play, making the group of strangers in the diner eclectic and dynamic.
Romance and dysfunctional chemistry erupt between a few of the characters: Jessie Ryan, a master’s student in musical theater, plays Elma Duckworth, a cheerful but naïve girl who catches the eye of the pretentious Dr. Lyman (played by senior acting major Alex Rice), a proud intellectual and pedophile who is trying to escape the state. Meanwhile, the sarcastic and sultry diner owner, Grace (played by senior acting major Lexi Soha), has a passionate fling with the bus driver, Carl (played by junior acting major Marquis Wood).
Other, less spirited characters serve to keep the peace and bring their more passionate companions back down to reason. The gruff and terse sheriff, Will Masters (played by senior acting major Patrick de Ledebur) strives to maintain order when unrest breaks out. Likewise, Virgil Blessing (played by senior acting major Michael Cusimano), Bo’s more level-headed and romantically savvy friend, coaxes Bo out of his aggressive exterior and serenades the others with his sweet harmonica playing.
Together, the characters create a vibrant and somewhat dysfunctional dynamic that keeps the audience amused and interested, despite the relative lack of plot or change in setting. In such a character-driven play, a minimal plot is to be expected; but the few plot developments that exist in Bus Stop tend to miss the mark. Toward the end of the play, when the weather clears and the play must resolve itself before the characters go their separate ways, a series of events happens all at once. Some resolutions are unrealistically quick, while other moments drag on. The play’s original playwright, William Inge, certainly knew how to craft rich and compelling characters, but this confusing and strangely paced resolution is a somewhat disappointing end to an otherwise excellent play.
With such a minimal play in terms of plot, the production’s success depends largely on the characters and the skill of the actors who play them. In this respect, the School of Drama’s performance of Bus Stop is very successful.
Bus Stop runs through May 5.

“We talk about the sci-fi notions of robots in society, but, you know, it’s already happening. You just may not see it.”
Dan Wilcox, a Master of Fine Arts student and co-curator and co-host of last Friday’s Cyborg Cabaret, hoped to expose the crowd at the New Hazlett Theater to the growing relationship between humans and robots in society.
“It’s really surprising, the breadth and depth of the type of robots that are not science fiction but that are real life and are actually existing,” Wilcox said. “And we only see a little of that. Most people in general might not be aware that there are so many crazy things going on.”
Cyborg Cabaret: Passion, Terror, & Interdependence was a variety show featuring acts ranging from dancing robotic arms to a cyborg burlesque show. Performers included Golan Levin, director of the STUDIO for Creative Inquiry, senior art major Julia Cahill, and Master of Fine Arts student Riley Harmon, among others.
The show was hosted by Wilcox, his co-curator Heather Knight (a Ph.D. student in robotics), and Data the Robot, a social robot created by Knight that has performed in many onstage productions. Data charmed the audience by telling jokes, introducing an act, and asking questions like, “Do you ever think about what it all means? This life — you know, when the power button is in the ‘on’ position?”
Many of the acts in the cabaret were underwhelming or confusing, inciting awkward laughter or applause from audience members. The cabaret as a whole had a distinctively eerie vibe, perhaps due to the natural fear that society has toward the role of robots in the future.
Perhaps the most entertaining act was Wilcox’s own “Robot Rumble.” The rumble featured Master of Fine Arts students Jonathan Armistead, Carl Bajandas, Craig Fahner, Steve Gurysh, and Luke Loeffler wearing cardboard costumes of famous robots, including the Honda ASIMO, the Carnegie Mellon Crusher, and Google’s self-driving car. The robots engaged in a WWE-style fight until everyone on stage, including Wilcox, had been taken down.
Wilcox’s “Robot Rumble” was a follow-up to his piece at the first- and second-year Master of Fine Arts student showcase at Bakery Square last month. His inspiration for this project was the increasing development of human-like robots, and he hoped to entertain audience members while simultaneously exposing them to robotic technologies they may not have previously known about.
“The real point of the whole thing is exposure,” he said. “It’s like tricking people into learning about these things and being interested in them.”
Another act, Harmon’s “Disintegration (after myself),” was a multimedia piece that examined “the delicate relationship between people and their technological prosthetics,” according to the program. The piece centered on a video of Harmon in various locations — on a subway, in a convenience store, at the grocery store — and bystanders’ reactions to his fake prosthetic arm malfunctioning. As the video ended, Harmon’s arm sparked and fell off. The act was coherent and accessible, while still sending an important message about societal notions of technological prosthetics.
Cyborg Cabaret was made possible by funding from the 2011 Carnegie Mellon School of Art Interdisciplinary Award. Wilcox and Knight proposed the idea in April of last year and have been collaborating with community members and planning the event since. The pair worked not only with those participating in the acts, but also with community organizations like Assemble, Hack Pittsburgh, VIA, and the STUDIO for Creative Inquiry.
“It was more about us getting people from outside of CMU and from different disciplines ... and getting their acts in there,” Wilcox said. “The whole thing was a collaboration.”
Wilcox is unsure if Cyborg Cabaret will become an annual event, since he will be working on his thesis next year. Regardless of whether the event returns again next spring, it succeeded in bringing to light questions about robotic technology in society and inviting its audience to explore and understand the world’s increasing dependence on technology.
As Wilcox put it, “It’s interesting but also a little scary, if we want that or not.... We should at least think about it a little bit.”

Bo Burnham, a 21-year-old comedian and musician, performed at the Carnegie Library Music Hall last Friday to a crowd of about a thousand. Pittsburgh was the first stop on his short, 10-day tour across the country.
The comedian got his start by posting YouTube videos in 2007. “I was sixteen and doing that before anyone knew YouTube was a thing,” Burnham said. “I just started writing songs and posting them online so my brother could watch them at Cornell. Then one day I had like 5,000 views.”
Since then, Burnham’s fame has continued to rise with clever, self-aware songs like “Love Is” and “Art Is Dead.” The song “Art Is Dead,” for example, discusses the conundrum of the artist. “When he grows up to be a comic or actor/ He’ll be rewarded for never maturing/ For never understanding or learning/ That every day can’t be about him... My drug’s attention/ I am addict/ But I get paid to indulge in my habit.”
Burnham has performed twice in Pittsburgh before this most recent appearance. “I’m very happy to be back,” Burnham said. “I’ve been living in L.A. since December, but I’m from Boston and I really miss the East Coast.”
Apparently, the East Coast missed him as well. With the Carnegie Library Music Hall nearly filled to capacity, Burnham emerged from behind heavy red stage curtains amid raucous applause.
As a recording repeatedly sang, “Welcome to the show,” Burnham danced and ran his hands through a mass of dirty blonde hair that seemed to defy gravity with its upward pull. Before sitting on a stool placed center stage, Burnham ripped off two pairs of red track pants and a hoodie to reveal an Urban Outfitters T-shirt and a pair of worn blue jeans. The show had begun.
With an old fashioned wrap-around balcony and seating reminiscent of a high school theater, the venue provided an intimate and comfortable space between the audience and the artist.
Burnham used a variety of mediums in this comedic performance — including voice-overs, abrupt ends to songs, spastic dancing, and dark, pithy quips directed at the audience. Much of his humor dwelled on adolescence and awkwardness.
Near the beginning of his act, Burnham “accidentally” knocked over his water bottle, and as he clumsily apologized, a 10-second song came on. “He meant to knock the water over. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you all thought it was an accident. He meant to knock the water over. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Art is a lie, nothing is real.”
Tiny bits like this were sprinkled throughout his act. Another one that he used several times was a microphone transition song, which is exactly what it sounds like. “Walking between the microphones ... is really awkward.” After these short bits, Burnham would immediately launch into another joke or song, playing on a keyboard at a breakneck speed.
“Nowadays so much of what I want to do is being based off of taking people by surprise and being a little bit random, a little all over the place with the content jumping around, so that I can be silly the whole time,” Burnham said. With a mixture of melodramatic acting, dancing, stand-up comedy, poem reading, singing, and playing the keyboard, Burnham was indeed random and diverse in his performance.
“It’s all the same muscle — writing and performing,” Burnham said. “Muscle confusion, engaging in different mediums, is going to make you stronger. I always try to confuse myself. “
Although his humor was sharp and clever, the fast-paced and random format of his show was slightly confusing. Audience members who were familiar with Burnham’s comedic style took it in stride, but for those who were not familiar, it was a bit disconcerting.
Fortunately for Burnham, the majority of the crowd was already accustomed to his erraticism. The audience, which consisted largely of teenagers (and more than a few screechy fangirls), laughed uproariously at his self-deprecating jokes and his dark humor.
“I like taking subjects and ripping them apart,” Burnham said. “Ripping myself apart is easiest because it’s what I know best. So much [of my act] is a reflection of who I am. Or rather, it’s the way I choose to present myself in an hour, a weird version of myself that’s not always very likable.”
Toward the end of the evening, the audience began getting even more comfortable with Burnham, requesting specific songs or asking if he had a girlfriend. More than one audience member asked for his hand in marriage. One memorable interaction occurred when Burnham, who had been describing his experience being called the c-word, was then called said word by an audience member. Burnham looked the audience member coolly in the eye and snappily stated, “I didn’t know this was a role call.”
Burnham’s 90-minute set ended at 9:30 p.m., but the audience wasn’t ready to let him go. After continuous clapping, Burnham came back out onstage to perform his song “Nerds.” Still, the audience wasn’t satisfied until he had come out for a second encore, this time ending with a performance of one of his newer songs, “Oh My God,” which details the thoughts of God on humanity. After two encores, Burnham managed to persuade the crowd to leave, with the promise that he would be waiting to meet fans outside.
Even after successful shows like last Friday’s, young Burnham is still asking himself, “What is comedy?”
“I understand science and what its purpose is, but what is the purpose of comedy?” Burnham mused. “For me, it’s really a matter of being fearless on stage. I have a lot of young fans that come out and I would like to be good for them in some way, to get up there and show them that you can trust your own voice.”

We went for the music and stayed for the banter.
Flock of Dimes and Sharon Van Etten took the stage at the Carnegie Lecture Hall last Saturday evening as part of the Warhol Museum’s Spring Sound Series.
Flock of Dimes is a musical project created by Jenn Wasner (half of the folk rock duo Wye Oak). She played first, backed by a bassist and her producer on drum machine. The sprawling set was a clear departure from the sparser, cleaner sound that Wye Oak has developed.
Wasner’s vocals were often lost among the sea of reverb and guitars, but her strongest work of the night included the moments when her voice took center stage, as well as certain riffs on her song “Prison Bride” and the chilling, self-described ghost story “Apparition.” Wasner closed with a song she wrote after a dream she had of Swedish pop artist Robyn. “REPLICA” was Wasner’s own effort to clone Robyn, during which she sang and danced alone on stage.
After a brief stage reset, Van Etten and her band began their phenomenal performance. The audience was smitten, as Van Etten played the majority of her newest album Tramp, which was released in February of this year, interspersed with a few older tracks.
Before she left the stage, Wasner warned the audience that Van Etten would have everyone crying in some sort of collective, cathartic viewing experience. But the actual show was a mix of emotion, with Van Etten’s songs ranging from those about moving on in life, to being an independent woman, to getting out of a relationship and trying to quit smoking. Her jokes between songs brought some refreshing quirkiness to the set.
At one point she engaged in a conversation with a guest who was doing some acrobatics on the floor between the front row and the stage. Van Etten dedicated a song to her and then recounted in detail a scene from a Don Hertzfeldt animation (My Spoon is Too Big) to maintain the light mood of the show.
Behind Van Etten was a video projection of highly manipulated film clips — mirrored reflections of subway trains, dogs chasing a stick through the sand, a woman walking through a forest, and a city with the camera focused only on a woman’s feet. These were the weakest parts of the show, due to some technical stuttering, but Van Etten encouraged fans to contribute to her “visual quilt” by submitting video footage of anything they believed to be beautiful to her website.
The show revolved around Van Etten — her jokes, her extended thanks to all the people who made her tour possible, and most of all the growth in her songwriting. The sharper edge of her newer tracks kept the evening moving. Van Etten and her band closed their set with an extended version of “Joke or a Lie,” an expertly layered, moving, and bittersweet performance.

The Pittsburgh Irish and Classical Theatre (PICT) is currently halfway through its production of In the Next Room (or The Vibrator Play), a 2010 Tony Award-nominated play by Sarah Ruhl. The play opened on April 19 and has started a buzz among those interested in Victorian America and the history of women’s sexuality.
Last Wednesday’s show opened with a short lecture by Kristina Straub, a Carnegie Mellon professor of literary and cultural studies and associate dean of the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences. Straub began by posing one of famed psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud’s questions to the audience: What does a woman want?
She continued by discussing some of the major developments in female sexuality — specifically focusing on Freud’s theories — and engaging in a meaningful discussion with the audience about such themes. Most of the questions asked by audience members after her talk were intended to help put the play in historical context, and it seemed that many of the attendees were pleased to have the opportunity to talk openly and be informed about the history of sexuality. Straub’s extensive knowledge of Freud’s theories of sexuality and the history of female sexuality was evident throughout the discussion, and her presentation was an excellent primer for the play that followed.
In the Next Room provides a snapshot of sexuality in the Victorian era. At the dawn of electricity, a wonderfully pleasing new technology — the vibrator — was frequently used by the medical community to treat female “hysteria,” by effectively causing the women (or men) to orgasm. At a time when sex was not supposed to be enjoyed by women, the “treatment” was unsurprisingly successful.
The show features a number of treatment scenes, as one of the major characters, Dr. Givings (played by Brad Heberlee), is a doctor who administers such procedures. The first few onstage orgasms, believably faked by the actors, incited some laughter among audience members who, perhaps understandably, felt uncomfortable with such a blatant portrayal of the intimate affair.
Although the repeated onstage orgasms were important for allowing the audience to overcome the inherent awkwardness of watching such scenes, they were perhaps a bit overdone. By intermission, it seemed that most of the action was in the doctor’s office and that the plot itself had progressed very little.
Despite the slow plot, the characters in the play were very well developed. The character of Catherine Givings (played by Megan McDermott), in particular, stood out as an excellent example of the repressed and confused women of the time. As her friendship with Sabrina Daldry (played by Melinda Helfrich) grows and Daldry becomes increasingly full of life thanks to Dr. Givings’ treatments, Catherine’s own femininity and happiness are dwindling as she is unable to adequately breast-feed her child and engage in sexual relations with her husband. McDermott puts on a great performance, showing both the bubbly, enthusiastic, wife-of-a-successful-doctor side of her character as well as her deeply repressed side.
Another stand-out performance is put on by Denver Milord, a senior acting major at Carnegie Mellon. Milord plays Leo Irving, a sexually and creatively driven artist who seeks Dr. Givings’ help. Milord’s portrayal of his character stands out as particularly strong and he provides an appealing and humorous presence throughout the second half of the play.
Overall, Ruhl’s well-developed characters make the play interesting and informative, and PICT’s casting ensures the production’s success. While the plot is a tad slow at times (much like these Victorian women’s sex lives) and a few of the characters rely too heavily on cultural stereotypes, the historical aspect of the play is well executed and the show is an amusing snapshot of Victorian life.
In the Next Room (or The Vibrator Play) continues through May 5 at the Charity Randall Theatre (4310 Forbes Ave.).

This Friday marked the opening of Duncan Campbell’s exhibit as the 68th installment of the Carnegie Museum’s Forum series. The Irish artist creates video “portraits” of somewhat obscure figures in history using archival material and original footage. The exhibition, titled Duncan Campbell, displays three of his recent pieces — Bernadette, Make it New John, and Arbeit — which play sequentially on a timed rotation three times each day.
Upon entering, viewers’ eyes are tickled with the sudden sensation of darkness and an electricity in the air. There are four comfortable leather couches facing a large screen, an environment that tempts even the most avid and alert art viewer to sleep. This movie theater atmosphere sets the expectation for an exciting, flashy Hollywood show. The actual pieces, however, are quite different from most film experiences.
Make it New John, the most impressive of the three films, paints a portrait of the DMC-12 sports car produced by the DeLorean Motor Company in West Belfast, Ireland, and its creator John DeLorean. The vehicle, best known for its appearance in Back to the Future, is the star of the strange, fragmented film.
The piece begins with found footage representative of DeLorean’s troubled childhood and successful adolescence as a creator. However, without reading the pamphlets available at the door, this message is extremely difficult to understand when watching the film. The clips seem disoriented and strange, which is not helped by the abstract and disconnected audio, which at one point features the strange repeating whooping of a man for at least two minutes.
The film features both black and white and color clips, but all have the appearance of being aged. The found footage of the beginning slowly transitions into archival material detailing the rise and fall of DeLorean, his factory, and the factory workers. The film is a documentary in style, but has a slightly off feeling to it; instead of looking at a final project, the viewer flips through endless news channels all discussing the same topic. The end of the film is a scripted conversation between factory workers based on archival documents, images, and an unscripted conversation. However, the scene drags on for over 10 minutes.
The piece has redeeming qualities: The juxtaposition of the found film clips is fascinating and the largely forgotten story that is being told is intriguing. 
“The one thing I did like about it was the instantaneous scene changes,” said first-year linguistics and French double major Edward Wojciechowski III. “But it was confusing a lot of the time.”
In fact, many viewers did not manage to sit through the entire 50-minute film, and did not stay for the other two films.
Campbell’s exhibit critiques the world of documentary film, an art privileged with being labeled as “the truth.” By involving his own hand so much in recounting his perspective of events with staged reenactments and distortion of time, Campbell twists the notion of truthful documentation. He walks a fine line between documentation and artistic liberty. While his intentions are thought-provoking, his work seems to have less of a spark by itself.
Duncan Campbell will be at the Carnegie Museum of Art until July 8.

Shary Boyle’s artwork is unquestionably jarring. The elaborate visuals she creates possess a quality of impressive duality that allow them to be grotesque yet divine, dreamlike yet sincere. Boyle’s work communicates fantastic and often dark ideas about personal identity and human culture from a feminist perspective.
“I’m always introduced as a Canadian artist,” Boyle began, speaking to an audience in McConomy Auditorium on Tuesday evening. “But there is blankness to that description. What is the status associated with being a Canadian artist?”
Through a recent project she calls “Canadian Artist,” Boyle aimed to answer that question. The Toronto native fabricated a genealogy to connect a diverse group of characters from cultures across the globe. She then constructed a physical representation of her narrative by creating 45 plaster faces, mounting them to a wall in the Bank of Montreal Project Room — an exhibition space in Toronto — and using colorful ribbon to demonstrate familial relationships. At the center of her construction is the face of the “Canadian Artist.”
Boyle explained how she grew up with only a vague understanding of her family history and that this ambiguity motivates her work. Boyle has invented stories of unlikely genealogies. Some of the characters in Boyle’s imaginative project include an Ashkenazi Jew who reproduced with a deity, a Malinke slave who reproduced with a Seminole healer, and a Barnum & Bailey performer who reproduced with a juvenile captive.
“Artists have no boundaries. We self-invent constantly, and so this project was kind of perfect for me,” she said.
Nicole Anderson, a first-year student in the Bachelor of Humanities and Arts program, appreciated Boyle’s artistic imagination. “I’m really interested, in general, in this idea of creating false narratives. I like that she invents experiences to communicate feelings that real-life experiences don’t exist for,” Anderson said.
Another of Boyle’s pieces, titled “The Clearances,” explores similar ideas about cultural identity. The mural is constructed from colorful cutout drawings and depicts a diverse group of people in a mob of forward motion that Boyle referred to as the “march towards progress.” The people, drawn wearing garments representative of their origins, are also accompanied by mythological creatures. Boyle described the piece as her “attempt to grapple with the human impulse to colonize.”
Boyle has not confined her art to the boundaries of a single medium, and works with everything from drawing to live projection to porcelain. Works falling into the latter category are amazingly intricate, many of them involving the tedious construction of lace-draped porcelain. Boyle honed her skills under the guidance of talented porcelain hobbyists from around the world.
“I was never one for institutional learning,” she said. “I’ve always wanted to be influenced by the world at large, not a large group, which is why a lot of my work doesn’t fit in with contemporary art. I also like to see what people outside of the art world are doing.”
This work outside of the contemporary art world gives Boyle’s art a unique flair and brings her international recognition.

Chocolate is something we can all relate to, whether from the advice of Forrest Gump’s mother or memories of past Valentine’s Days. But contrary to its modern form, chocolate started out in Latin America as a liquid in its early days.
Marcy Norton discussed the origins of chocolate in a lecture last Monday in the Giant Eagle Auditorium in Baker Hall, as part of the Kim and Eric Giler Lecture in the Humanities and the Humanities Scholars Program.
Norton is an associate professor of history at George Washington University; a graduate of the University of California, Berkeley; and an award-winning author of the book Sacred Gifts, Profane Pleasures: A History of Tobacco and Chocolate in the Atlantic World. Her lecture, titled “A Sensational Drink: Chocolate Before and After the Spanish Conquest of Mesoamerica,” focused on the chocolate side of her work.
She began by explaining the origins of this type of chocolate in order to rid any thoughts audience members had of candy bars and truffles. As a liquid, chocolate was prepared using ground cacao beans and was thick, red in color, and flavored with vanilla, cinnamon, and other spices.
Norton’s lecture focused on chocolate’s place in Latin America and its eventual spread to Europe. She described accounts of chocolate’s assumed psychotropic qualities that caused reactions similar to drunkenness: over-excitement, dancing, and singing. Since chocolate was the first stimulant drink to arrive in Europe, Norton speculates that these qualities associated with early chocolate make sense and that people today are simply desensitized to the stimulant.
Much of the lecture was spent discussing the romantic implications of the frothy chocolate drink and the significance of its foam. Many examples of chocolate being poured from high heights — the way to create the special foam — show up in artists’ portrayals of the time. Norton’s favorite image on the subject involves a depiction of heaven, earth, and hell that includes chocolate as one of the middle levels, signifying its importance in the life of the Aztecs.
Mapping its journey across the Atlantic, Norton explained that chocolate began its integration into Europe through colonial officials, merchants, and clergymen. The clergy’s role in the spread of chocolate caused a good bit of uproar in Europe ­­­­— sparking a debate on whether chocolate could be consumed during times of fasting — and influenced a sub-genre of poetry comparing chocolate to the Eucharist and other religious symbols.
Tim Haggerty, a professor in Carnegie Mellon’s department of history, described the lecture as not merely a discussion of chocolate, but as “using the study of chocolate as a vehicle to discussing culture.” Norton’s lecture involved both of these broader topics and served as an in-depth example of work in that field.

Dear Patrick,
I have a girlfriend and it’s been going great. But whenever she’s feeling glum, she’ll send me a text asking me to cheer her up. I try my best, sending messages like, “The sun will expand into a red giant in 5 billion years and consume the Earth.” But she just gets angry at these texts. Am I doing something wrong?
Thanks,
Tirelessly, Enthusiastically Xchanging Tender, Uplifiting Anecdotes, Lover Hates Epistles And Letters, I Need Guidance
Dear TEXTUAL HEALING,
Frankly, I don’t know why those texts wouldn’t cheer her up. Nothing makes me appreciate my life more than daily reminders of the futility of the human endeavor. But I guess your girlfriend is a different sort of bird. She probably wanted something more along the lines of, “I can’t wait to see you tonight” or, “Here’s a puppy in a bow tie.” If she’s like this, I recommend stocking up on cute animal pictures.
If that doesn’t work, then we know the problem: She’s clearly a robot, and her depression is caused by her lack of a soul and confusion about her place in the universe. You just need to let her compute through it and she’ll either get out of her funk or destroy humanity.
Or reprogram her to love puppies in bow ties,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
I was selected to be an OC next year, and I’m really looking forward to guiding all those first-years through their first couple weeks here. It’s my first time, and I want to make sure I do a good job. Do you have any tips for being an OC?
Thanks,
Desperate to Inspire Students, Organize Residents; I Emphatically Need Tips, Encouragement, Direction
Dear DISORIENTED,
Being an OC is a great honor. You have been selected to be enthusiastic and wear the same clothes for a week (that’s pretty much the extent of your responsibilities). Now you need to learn the things you can’t do.
First, you can’t hit on your residents. I know, I know, that’s the main reason you became an OC. But you’re not allowed to do it. You also can’t drink or party with your residents — at least during Orientation. The one thing you really do need to do is aggressively recruit your residents to join whatever Greek organization you’re a part of. That’s “technically” not allowed, but don’t let that stop you. Follow these rules and you’re sure to be an adequate OC!
Just be sure to start ignoring them after Orientation,
Patrick Hoskins

A film score can make or break a movie. Before the advent of talkies, most movies completely relied on their scores to build suspense, create drama, and serve as an audible link from the images on the screen to the viewer; yet the rise of talkies saw a seismic shift in emphasis, from cinematography and music to acting and the voice.
In recent years, film music has been a lackadaisical affair. There is a small group of greats — composers Hans Zimmer, Thomas Newman, Howard Shore, and John Williams — that are responsible for most Hollywood blockbusters. The process has become mechanical: The lead composer writes a theme, which is often a small alteration from a past film and a group of assistants writes the variations. This method can work quite well: The score for The Lord of the Rings trilogy is a perfect example. But often this results in the same sounds being put into multiple films.
Fortunately, there are exceptions to this process. Every once in a while, a newcomer will come to the scene and create something quite memorable. In 2011’s Drive, the score featured the ethereal, ’80s sounding, synthesizer Europop sounds of Cliff Martinez. Apologies to Ryan Gosling fans, but the dreamlike score of Drive is definitely the film’s strongest element. 
Film music, like any sort of music, is a mixed affair filled with highs and lows. Perhaps more interesting is how the elements of the score permeate into the rest of the music world. Most recently, Johnny Jewel, the person who everyone thought would score Drive, released the album Themes For an Imaginary Film, which, like Drive, featured arpeggiating synths, dramatic sweeps, and brittle drum machines. The term “cinematic music” is thrown around a lot, but rarely does this term truly imply a cinematic experience. The two hours of music contained on Themes For an Imaginary Film, however, is able to emulate the experience of watching a film. All you have to do is close your eyes and be drawn into your imagination.

Thousands of Pittsburghers weathered temperatures in the mid-90s Friday to see President Barack Obama speak on the College of Fine Arts lawn.
The president visited Carnegie Mellon as the last stop of his two-day “Betting on America” bus tour of northern Ohio and western Pennsylvania. Obama delivered campaign speeches in six Ohio towns before arriving in Pittsburgh midday Friday. His speech, which painted in broad strokes his plan to “turn this country back” to a strong middle class, was timed to begin at 2:10 p.m. This was Obama's third visit to Carnegie Mellon in two years.
Obama competed for his audience with a sunny, 94-degree July afternoon. With attendees arriving up to three hours before the president’s appearance, city and university paramedics treated several people for heat-related illnesses before the event began. Volunteers passed out bottles of water and sprayed water over the crowd, but attendees still regularly shouted for medics.
Pittsburgh EMS crews transported 13 people from the event to local hospitals, according to Rescue Division Chief Bob Farrow. He said that city paramedics treated about 20 patients in total, and more were attended to on-site by Carnegie Mellon EMS or sought treatment on their own in the medical tent and cool-down rooms.
“I think it went really well considering the circumstances," Farrow said. "We got to everybody real quick, and nobody was what I would consider life-threatening.”
Opinions in the crowd were mixed about the event being held outdoors.
“Whoever planned this should be fired,” said senior international relations and politics major Chris Sparks. “We have space inside for this, and ... five or six people passed out in the last 60 minutes.”
Jordan Gibson, a master’s student in music performance, was more forgiving. “I managed to get in the shade, but once that went away, people were dropping like flies, especially the older people. But I thought it was worth it to see [Obama] speak.”
Thousands of area residents attended the speech after registering for tickets early in the week at the Obama campaign’s local offices. Carnegie Mellon also handed out approximately 1,000 tickets for the event, which could be claimed by students, faculty, staff, and alumni at the University Center Info Desk.
In his remarks, the president sketched a rosy picture of his life growing up in middle-class America, where “no matter what you look like, no matter where you come from, no matter what church you worship at, no matter what region of the country, if you were willing to work hard, if you were willing to take responsibility for your life, you could make it if you tried.”
He said that that middle-class ideal has been “getting battered a little bit over the last decade.”
“Making sure that access to that middle class, that growing, thriving heartbeat of America, that that was available for everybody ... that’s what led me to run for President of the United States, and that’s what led me to ask you for a second term,” Obama said.
Obama also summarized his record as president since 2008 and offered a program of future investment. Without giving specific details, the president proposed reallocating money that would have been spent on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in favor of employing Americans to improve U.S. infrastructure.
“Let’s put some Americans back to work rebuilding our roads and our bridges, our schools. Let’s build broadband lines and wireless networks and high-speed rails. Let’s invest in the basic science and research that helped to send a man to the moon and created the internet.”
After the speech, Obama did a traditional hand-shaking pass through the crowd. “I liked him [in 2008] and I liked him now,” said retired Crafton resident Fredericka Lewellyn. “I love him. Matter of fact, you know what? He gave me a kiss.”

Campus Design and Facilities Development staff hosted town hall meetings on June 19 and June 28 to gather feedback on campus buildings and spaces from faculty, staff, and students. The comments will help to guide the implementation of the university's 10-year master plan.
The master plan, which was first made public last March, could lead to new academic buildings and significant alterations to Forbes Avenue. The plan needs to be reviewed by both the Pittsburgh city planning commission and city council.
Held in the same format as the first town hall meeting on June 19, it was also held in the same location, the Posner Center. With about 60 staff and faculty members, this second meeting had nearly double the attendance of the first.
Michael Murphy, vice president for campus affairs, led a discussion on the pros and cons of the university's spaces.
Attendees paid particular attention to the placement and upkeep of campus walkways, the availability of comfortable seating inside and outside of buildings, and the navigational difficulties campus newcomers seem to endure.
"I understand the hesitation with the look of signage, and certainly I understand you can't have printed directions from everywhere to everywhere," said civil and environmental engineering master's student Kyle Shatzer. "But after having lived for extended periods on four continents, I have to say that Pittsburgh remains one of the most logistically frustrating cities I have ever been in. And should there be a direction you want to tip in that balance, I would certainly lean in favor of signs."
Murphy noted that the extensive additions to the plan were meant to create an idealized blueprint rather than suggest concrete changes. He detailed the list of nine design principles used to create and implement the plan: open space, edges and entrances, multi-modality, sustainability, architecture, mixed use, universal design, public art, and neighborhood compatibility.
Murphy added that it would be unusual if more than half of the ideas in the master plan were implemented.

Campus Design and Facilities Development staff hosted a town hall on Tuesday to gather feedback on campus buildings and spaces from faculty, staff, and students. The comments will help to guide the implementation of the 10-year master plan.
Led by Michael Murphy, Vice President for Campus Affairs, the town hall filled the Posner Center with around 35 participants. Murphy opened by noting that the extensive expansions in the plan were more of a idealized blueprint than concrete changes.
He added that it would be unusual if more than half of the ideas were implemented. The rest of the discussion gathered opinions on what "worked" on campus and what should be avoided.
Mathematics Teaching Professor John Mackey made the first comment by saying "a perspective that's often missing form these discussion is that of the undergraduate student body," before highlighting the five undergraduates who were present at the town hall.
The plan, which was first made public last March, could lead to new academic buildings and significant alterations to Forbes Avenue. The plan needs to be reviewed by both the Pittsburgh city planning commission and city council.
A second meeting is scheduled for next Thursday from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m., also in the Posner Center.
Check back for more details after next Thursday's town hall.

At approximately 7 p.m. on Friday, Environmental Health & Safety sent out an alert saying that the University Center (UC) received a bomb threat.
According to the alert, University Police are sweeping the UC. The building has not been evacuated, but occupants are free to leave if they wish. The estimated end time of the sweep is 10 p.m.
During the sweep, a final exam for 15-122 Principles of Imperative Computation was being held in McConomy Auditorium. Carnegie Mellon police announced the bomb threat to the class and explained that evacuation was optional. The professor and teaching assistants allowed students to leave and take a make-up exam if they felt uncomfortable.
"We gave them the option to leave if they wanted and offered a make-up exam, but nobody took the offer," said Erik Zawadzki, a fourth-year Ph.D. student in computer science and teaching assistant for the class. "A police officer and one of CMU security came and announced that there was a bomb threat. It was pretty uneventful though."
Snigdha Roy, a first-year computer science major and a student in the class, explained that the bomb threat wasn't what was on her mind as she took her exam. "The only thing we were traumatized by was the final we just took," she said.
This is Carnegie Mellon's second bomb threat this week. On Tuesday morning, the university received an email threatening Hunt Library, the Mellon Institute library, and Sorrells Engineering & Science Library in Wean Hall. None of the buildings were evacuated, and a sweep turned up no threats. Prior to Tuesday, the university's most recent bomb threat was in February, when Warner and Smith Halls were evacuated.

Hunt Library, the Mellon Institute Library, and the Sorrells Engineering & Science Library in Wean Hall were the targets of bomb threats Tuesday morning. A campus alert message posted at 9:35 a.m. said that police were searching the buildings, but a mandatory evacuation had not been ordered. A follow-up announcement at 10:30 a.m. stated that the libraries had returned to normal operations. 
Both the campus alerts website and other parts of the main Carnegie Mellon webpage went offline due to heavy traffic following the announcements. The initial alert message had instructed users to visit the invalid URL "www.cmu.edu/slash alert" — instead of the correct address www.cmu.edu/alert — for further details.
Randal Bryant, the dean of the School of Computer Science, sent an email to members of the administration alerting them to and complaining of the problems with the emergency alerts. In addition to the problems with the website, Bryant said that some people found the voice alert garbled, were unable to repeat the message, and were confused as to what they should do after receiving the alert. He also said that the multiple channels for alerts made the process chaotic.
"I'm not criticizing people for doing a bad job," Bryant wrote in a separate email. "There are many complexities in creating a system that has to work reliably in an emergency situation. The most important task now is to analyze where things went wrong today and what steps can be taken to make things better."
Madelyn Miller, the head of Carnegie Mellon's Environmental Health & Safety (EHS), acknowledged that there were some problems with the emergency response.
"I had a lot of really positive responses more than the negative, but the one from Randal Bryant went to my boss," Miller said. "He gave some constructive criticism, which I thought was nice."
Miller said that EHS is looking into ways to improve the system. One option which they are considering was suggested by Bryant: changing the alerts website from www.cmu.edu/alert to alert.cmu.edu. According to Miller, the invalid URL was sent out because of a flaw in alert vendor SendWordNow's handling of special characters. A URL change might eliminate that problem.
Miller said that the problems loading the website occurred because of server overload due to the incorrect URL, and because a server crash earlier in the week rendered the site fragile.
The emergency response also went well in many ways, according to Miller. "We sent out another message with another URL," Miller said. "The voice messages went out great. I was really happy that the all-clear note said, 'Look, this is a federal offense, and we’re going to go after you who ever you are.' We didn’t just take this lying down."
Miller also pointed to some of the ways in which SendWordNow has improved alerts, such as overcoming the text message character limit to concatenate two or three text alerts into one longer one.
The threatened buildings were not evacuated, although students were encouraged not to enter until a search had been conducted. Miller said that the university chose not to evacuate because the threats were considered low level.
"This was something that came in through an email, and so we considered it a low-level threat," Miller said. "We really had a lot of buy-in for allowing people to leave if they felt uncomfortable, but just make it a choice."
Junior electrical and computer engineering major Jecolia Longtchi, who was on her way to the library when she got the alert, said that she felt the university chose correctly. "I’m glad they didn’t evacuate because it’s finals week, people are studying, and it’s probably just one of the jokers," Longtchi said.
Before Tuesday, the last Carnegie Mellon bomb threat occurred Feb. 27, when University Police and the Pittsburgh Bomb Squad evacuated and searched Warner and Smith halls. The threats here have bookended a series of more than 30 separate multi-building threats at the University of Pittsburgh, most of which occurred in March and April.

Hunt Library, the Mellon Institute Library, and the Sorrells Engineering & Science Library in Wean Hall were the target of bomb threats Tuesday morning.
A campus alert message posted at 9:35 a.m. said that police were searching the buildings, but a mandatory evacuation had not been ordered. The message asked that people not already in one of the libraries stay away from the area until the police search was completed around 10:15 a.m.
A follow-up announcement at 10:30 stated that the libraries had returned to normal operations. "Bomb threats are felonies and individuals found responsible for such threats will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law," the message said.
Both the campus alerts website and other parts of the main Carnegie Mellon webpage seemed to be offline due to heavy traffic following the announcements.

Student Information Online (SIO) suffered technical difficulties this week that delayed registration by 24 hours for most of the student body.
According to University Registrar John Papinchak, the central database that runs SIO was overwhelmed by the increase in traffic from students planning and registering their schedules. “It was a perfect storm, and [SIO] got slower as the day went on,” Papinchak said.
The shift from Online Registration (OLR) to SIO is part of the goal of streamlining the student experience at Carnegie Mellon. The eventual plan is to enable students to do all their university-related business and scheduling from one central location that unites OLR with the schedule-planning utility of ScheduleMan. Papinchak said that this is an objective the student body has long desired.
However, while the central database was prepared for a higher demand, the system was not designed to handle that much internet traffic.
“It’s tough to plan for all of the traffic,” Papinchak said.
On Monday, Papinchak decided to delay registration in order to increase the computing resources available to SIO, so that more connections could be maintained at any given time. Since the reset on Tuesday, the system has not experienced significant slowdown.
Student reactions to these problems have varied greatly. 
Some students have been patient with the new system. “I’m sure they’re still working out the glitches,” said Brittany Robertson, a junior chemistry major.
Others even benefited from the delay. Visvesvaran Subramanian, a junior international relations and politics major, said, “Technically I benefited from SIO shutting down, since I was unable to meet with my adviser beforehand.”
Papinchak said that he received a great deal of feedback about the difficulties, some of it very frustrated.
“Students should use the feedback button [on SIO],” Papinchak said. “Real people read it.” According to Papinchak, the team working on the system wants to know what it can do to make registration go more smoothly for students in the upcoming year.
Papinchak’s immediate future does look busy. 
“We are going to debrief and make things better during the summer,” he said. This problem will not occur next semester, according to Papinchak, who cited added measures such as spreading students over 20-minute time slots instead of 30-minute ones to reduce strain on the system.

With the ongoing bomb threats at the University of Pittsburgh and recent shooting at Western Psychiatric Hospital, safety has become a top priority for many members of the Carnegie Mellon community.
Carnegie Mellon’s emergency alert messages are sent out through the CMU Alerts system, which is operated by emergency alert vendor SendWordNow. According to the official CMU Alerts website, the system “notifies the university community when there’s a significant campus emergency or weather event.”
“We classify the threats into two levels,” said Madelyn Miller, director of Environmental Health & Safety (EHS). “One of them would be imminent danger: tornado, shooter on campus. And those just get blasted. Then there’s the other threats: power outage, water main break. Those go out slower. Nobody’s really in danger. Those go out without a rush, and they get passed through different people. If it’s not an imminent danger, it goes out through a slower method.”
Miller said that only 63 percent of the undergraduate population is signed up for CMU Alerts.
“I wish we had 100 percent enrollment,” said Lieutenant Gary Scheimer of the University Police. Scheimer said that he is always concerned about members of the campus community who are not signed up for emergency Alerts.
First-year Bachelor of Computer Science and Art student Henry Armero admitted that he only signed up for CMU Alerts about three weeks ago. “I didn’t really know about it,” he said.
Even among those signed up for the system, some people still do not receive alerts.
“The Tartan had an editorial saying that, ‘I signed up for SendWordNow, and I didn’t get called,’ ” Miller said. “I’m concerned about that, because we want everybody to be on SendWordNow. I’m hoping that these tests would be able to find any bugs in the system, if there are any. Nobody ever followed up. After our recent test, nobody came back and said, ‘Hey, I was signed up and didn’t get the message.’ ”
Miller sent a special test alert to a Tartan staff member who said that she had never received any alerts, but had not reported the failure to EHS. Records confirmed that the staff member was registered for alerts; that the phone number listed in the system was correct; and that special alert was sent out to her. However, the staff member did not receive the special alert. Miller said that the problem likely lies either with Sprint, the student’s phone service provider, or with the aggregator, a system that directs messages to service providers.
“Once it gets to the aggregator, we have no control as to where it goes out,” Miller said. “So the aggregator goes, ‘Oh, here’s Madelyn Miller’s phone number, it goes to AT&T. Here’s somebody else’s, it goes somewhere else….’ That’s what an aggregator does. There’s no company that can do anything about the aggregators.”
EHS sent out a survey to a select group of Sprint users on Thursday to see if others have been missing alert messages. Miller encouraged any student who has experienced a problem with emergency alerts to contact EHS.
According to Miller, the university first instituted an emergency alert system after 9/11. “We really did a huge rewrite for that system,” Miller said. “And then in 2004, we had a huge power transformer that knocked out 10 buildings, and the way everybody notified each other was through email, and of course without computers, there was no email. So we had a phone tree at that point, and the lists for the phone trees were on the computer.”
After this incident, the university purchased the service of AlertNow, which provided emergency calls to a limited audience of 400 people in the campus “emergency operations group.”
After the Virginia Tech shooting, the system changed again. “It was one of those V8 moments, where we went, ‘We really need to include all the students,’ ” Miller said. “So we expanded AlertNow and had about 10,000 [people] on that system.”
Carnegie Mellon set up a committee to search for a new emergency alert vendor, with emphasis on speed and user interface, among other features. The committee ultimately selected the vendor SendWordNow.
Scheimer said that he is happy with the new vendor. “We get the info out via text and phone calls very quickly,” he said.
Shreepal Shah, a sophomore information systems major, feels that CMU Alerts are “good for the most part, because they’re pretty quick about getting a text or voice call out.” Shah added that, in his opinion, “Texting is a lot more convenient.”
First-year mechanical engineering major Seth Cordts agreed. 
“The texts are helpful,” he said. But, Cordts added, “The email seems overused.”
Recent events such as the Pitt bomb threats have raised questions about when Carnegie Mellon should warn students about off-campus threats. “We sent out alerts when there’s a direct threat to our community,” Scheimer said.
“I had conversations about this with Lt. Scheimer, and we sort of parsed out the difference between a low-level threat and a threat that had some validity,” Miller said. “A low-level threat would be, somebody goes into Starbucks and writes on a coffee cup, ‘Bomb at seven,’ and puts it in the bathroom. Kind of a low-level threat. Or an email. Or a note in the bathroom. These are the bomb threats that came out at Pitt.”
If they haven’t already done so, students are encouraged to sign up for alerts at www.cmu.edu/alert/.

The finalized Joint Funding Committee (JFC) student organization budget allocations were not released on Thursday, as expected, because the Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) failed to maintain quorum at a joint meeting with Undergraduate Student Senate to approve them.
“The problem was because the debates over these changes took longer than anticipated, GSA wasn’t able to maintain membership,” said junior lighting design major Jon Mark, a student Senator and Vice President-elect for Finance. “People walked out because they had other commitments.”
Senate voted to approve the budgets as they were, with only three changes: Restoring the Activities Board (AB) food budget to the amount AB requested; restoring AB Tech’s food budget and projected revenue to the amount requested; and eliminating a $400 line item for student government debates from The Tartan’s budget, because it is covered in the student body president’s budget.
GSA will vote on the budgets during its normally scheduled meeting on Wednesday.
“If GSA makes any additional changes or doesn’t agree with any of Senate’s changes, then it’s going to go back to Senate at Senate’s meeting, and if Senate doesn’t approve it at that meeting, then we go into a really weird limbo place,” Mark said. “Nobody really knows what happens then.”
Mark said that he does not think that getting the changes approved by GSA will be a problem. “The changes that we’ve made are very reasonable, we think, so I don’t anticipate it being an issue with GSA,” he said.

The speakers for the 2012 commencement were officially announced on Friday. The 2012 keynote speaker is Patrick Wilson. The student speaker is recently-graduated creative writing major Caroline Kessler. Wilson, who graduated from Carnegie Mellon with a degree in acting in 1995, has played roles in movies such as The Phantom of the Opera, Watchmen, and Young Adult. He currently stars in CBS’s A Gifted Man. Wilson was nominated for a Golden Globe and an Emmy Award for his role in the 2003 miniseries Angels in America. He is also a university trustee. His wife, Dagmara Dominczyk (’98), is also a Carnegie Mellon School of Drama alum.
“I’m delighted to meet and speak with the very distinguished and accomplished class of 2012,” Wilson said in a university press release. “Who knows, the paths ahead might lead any one of this year’s graduates back to CMU to serve as the keynote speaker at commencement someday.”
Reaction to the commencement speaker has been generally positive. “I saw him in Insidious, where he plays a father who saves his son from being eaten in another dimension,” said senior Bachelor of Computer Science and Art student Tim Sherman. “It’s kind of silly, but I’m kind of excited to see him speak based on that.”
Kessler graduated in December. She said that she will be speaking about the unique community that Carnegie Mellon provides. “I’ll be talking about sort of how atypical Carnegie Mellon graduates are, and how we really attack the world’s problems in an interesting way,” Kessler said. “It’s a weird place, but I think a place that many people call home after their time there.”
Kessler is looking forward to the ceremony. “It’ll be really nice to be back for commencement to see all my friends, and to have all the pomp and circumstance, because we don’t have a December graduation,” she said. “I’m really excited to do it. It’s a huge honor. It should be a kick.”
The university also announced this year’s honorary degrees, to be presented at commencement. Opera singer Renée Fleming will receive a Doctor of Fine Arts degree; author and activist Temple Grandin will receive a Doctor of Science and Technology degree; writer and humanitarian Ruth Gruber will receive a Doctor of Humane Letters degree; Nobel Prize-winning economist Daniel Kahneman will receive a Doctor of Business Practice degree; and local businessman Richard P. Simmons will receive a Doctor of Science and Technology degree.

The Port Authority approved the elimination of nearly half of Pittsburgh’s bus routes on Friday. The service cut, which will go into effect on Sept. 2, will eliminate 46 routes, end service at 10 p.m. on all but 13 routes, and lay off up to 500 Port Authority employees. Bus fares would also be increased, starting July 1.
Among the eliminated routes will be the 64, which runs to Lawrenceville and the Waterfront, and weekend service for the 75, which runs along Ellsworth Avenue. Despite recent fears that the route would be shortened, the 28X will continue to provide service to the airport.
The service cut could be reversed or reduced if the Port Authority’s current budget problems are alleviated.
“I want to direct staff to also plan for the best outcome,” said Guy Mattola, the Port Authority Board’s vice-chairman, in the Port Authority press release announcing the cuts. “Make sure we are prepared to sustain current service levels so that the Board could later convene on short notice to reverse these cuts if an adequate funding solution is found.”
Governor Tom Corbett said that the Port Authority should look to the transit employee unions to help it overcome its $64 million debt. 
“For years past, the state has been able to just produce money and help solve that, but we don’t have that money right now,” Corbett said, as reported by The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. “I look forward to working with them ... but as you know there’s got to be discussion between the transit authority and the unions as to the overall costs.”
“We are not ATMs that can be wrung for more cash every time politicians fail to live up to their responsibilities,” said the president of the Local 85 of the Amalgamated Transit Union, Patrick McMahon, according to the Post-Gazette. “Every concession we’ve made in the past has led to more demands and more concessions.”

For the past three months, Pittsburgh has been making national headlines for the continuous bomb threats targeting the University of Pittsburgh, but it seems that the threats have finally come to a close.
On April 21, the group behind these threats outed itself, sending an email to The Pitt News, the university’s campus newspaper, and to Chancellor Mark A. Nordenberg. In the email, the group promised to stop the threats if the university would withdraw the $50,000 reward for information leading to the members’ arrest. The same day, the offer for the reward was taken down from the university’s website and no bomb threats have been received since.
The anonymous group took responsibility for all the threats sent via email since March 30, but not any of the handwritten ones, including the first ones found in a bathroom stall of the Chevron Science Center on Feb. 13. In March, the threats sped up, coming at a rate of two to four per day, with the total tally coming to more than 155.
“It’s nice to know that it’s ended. My friends at UPitt were getting frustrated and annoyed,” said fourth-year architecture major Joe Dziekan.
Neal Jaehne, a graduate student in the Pitt School of Pharmacy, said, “I wasn’t scared. It was ridiculous. They were so constant and regular. How do you take something like that seriously when it’s so regular? I thought it was a prank.”
In the search to find the person or people of interest, multiple individuals were brought in for questioning over the past months. The FBI, Secret Service, Department of Justice, and the Joint Terrorism Task Force all collaborated with local police in the search. On April 11, University of Pittsburgh police arrested Mark Lee Krangle, a University of Pittsburgh alumnus, as well as a transgender couple living in Johnston, Pa., claiming a break in the case. The group claiming to be behind the threats, however, denies that anyone arrested thus far was involved in the threats.
The University of Pittsburgh was not the only place targeted. The threats have also been made at other Pittsburgh educational institutions, including California University, Point Park University, Western Pennsylvania School for the Blind, and the Community College of Allegheny County.
As a result of the constant threats, University of Pittsburgh administrators took many measures to secure the safety of its students and faculty, vowing to keep the campus open and operating. To enter buildings, individuals were required to show Pitt IDs and undergo bag checks, and non-residents were no longer permitted in dorms.
When students were removed from their dormitories in the middle of the night, the university provided cots, blankets, and free food at the student union center and basketball gym. The school united; the editor-in-chief of The Pitt News, Michael Macagnone, said the threats led to a surge in school spirit. “From what I have seen, this has brought the Pitt community together,” Macagnone told The New York Times. “The connections have always been there, with Facebook and social media. But this has been a shared experience by everyone on campus.”
In addition, the university took advantage of social media tools like Twitter to keep students informed about the threats and building openings. University-run Google spreadsheets and Facebook pages informed students of housing options off campus. Even so, some students left their dorms and classrooms and were given the option of continuing their studies at home for the rest of the semester. Attendance policies were disregarded for these students.

In the original 1960s television series Star Trek, all one had to do was ask the ship’s computer a question and it would automatically search through every book ever written to find the relevant information for the answer. This is what Gloriana St. Clair, Carnegie Mellon’s dean of University Libraries, hopes for the future of libraries.
St. Clair, 72, has watched over Carnegie Mellon’s books for nearly 15 years. Her lengthy career will come to a close in June 2013, as she plans to retire and spend time on her own research endeavors. Throughout her time at Carnegie Mellon, she has not only managed the books in Hunt Library, but also millions of others around the world.
Since 1999, St. Clair has been working alongside colleagues in the School of Computer Science to digitize millions of books. Digitizing books is “the direction society is going in,” according to St. Clair, who has worked in the library business since 1963. With Carnegie Mellon computer science professors Raj Reddy, Michael Shamos, and Jaime Carbonell, St. Clair developed the Million Book Project. Collaborating with several U.S. partners and a broad coalition of libraries and computer scientists in India and China, the project digitized over 1.5 million books and made them free to read on the internet.
Since her undergraduate days at the University of California, Berkeley, St. Clair has had an interest in the intersection between technology and printed texts. She originally received her bachelor’s degree in English in 1962, but the job market pushed her toward a career in library sciences. “I was sitting outside a class, waiting for it to start, and there were few other people standing there,” St. Clair said. “They were talking about going to library school because there weren’t very many jobs for people in English, and there were a lot in library studies. And I thought, ‘Hmm. I could do that.’ ”
A master’s in library science is mandatory for any practicing librarian. The field is interdisciplinary. Library science utilizes management; information technology; education; collection, organization, preservation, and dissemination of information resources; and political economy of information.
St. Clair received her master’s degree from UC Berkeley in 1963. “And at that time, it was one of the top three schools,” she said. “Generally, you could get jobs in academic libraries, in public libraries, in special libraries, and children’s libraries.”
For her library sciences degree, St. Clair specialized in technology. “I was kind of focused on academic libraries and on science and technology,” she said. “So as soon as I finished the program, I immediately got a job as a cataloguer at the Water Regional Center Archives at Berkeley.”
It was this initial emphasis on the technological aspect of library sciences that spurred St. Clair’s interest in the digitization of books during the rest of her career as a librarian. She has held 13 different positions, working across multiple institutions, such as Pennsylvania State University, Texas A&M University, and the University of Oklahoma. As the digital age came into focus and she began her work at Carnegie Mellon, St. Clair immediately found a niche for her interests.
“Raj Reddy was the dean of computer science when I came here as head of the library. I went around to all the deans to talk to them about what their needs were and what they wanted from the library,” St. Clair explained. “I went to him and walked in, and said, ‘The future of libraries is digital.’ So we talked for an hour, and then he sent his colleague Mike Shamos over to meet me and make sure that I was a true believer that we should digitize books and they should be free to read.”
This moment marked the start of what would become the Million Books Project, something St. Clair is very proud of. It began as a “proof of concept” project — she and her colleagues started by digitizing 1,000 books to see if the concept was feasible. The team then moved onto larger numbers and collaborated with international partners.
“So then I became a director of Universal Libraries, which was a project that [Reddy] had ongoing, and we were interested in how we could manage to digitize a million books,” St. Clair said. “We started out by convening a bunch of librarians from states that don’t get as much National Science Foundation money as other states, and that didn’t work out. So he began to work internationally and work with his colleagues in China and India, and we started two Million Books Projects, one in China and one in India.”
Currently, the project in China has managed to digitize approximately 2 million books, while the project in India digitized about 300,000.
According to St. Clair, the Million Books Project was in part the inspiration for the Google Books program, which has digitized about 20 million books.
“The power of digitization is knowledge,” St. Clair said. She cited the story of a current Carnegie Mellon student who is getting his Ph.D. in English. St. Clair explained that his dissertation was on Charles Darwin, and she had helped him use digitized copies of Darwin’s books for his research. 
“All of Darwin’s books are digitized and searchable through Google Books, and he doesn’t need to read every single page; he can use key words to find the bits of information he’s interested in,” St. Clair said.
This is St. Clair’s goal for the future of libraries. She hopes that someday “people all over the world will have the information they need because of digitization.”
As for libraries being potentially threatened from such easy and accessible knowledge through digitization and the internet, St. Clair isn’t worried. She remains confident that neither libraries nor librarians will ever go out of business. 
“They will always have a use as long as books need to be paid for, as long as people need help sorting through information, as long as people need help differentiating between good and bad information,” she said. “People will always need libraries.”

Underage Drinking
April 20, 2012
University Police were summoned to Mudge House for an intoxicated female. The female had become ill and needed to be transported to the hospital for additional care. Because the call was initiated by a staff member, alcohol amnesty did not apply. The female, who was under 21 years of age, will be cited by mail for underage drinking.
Unconscious Student
April 21, 2012
City of Pittsburgh police along with University Police were on a patrol detail on Beeler Street when they were dispatched to a call for an intoxicated male. Upon arrival, the officers found the male unconscious with blood on his face. City medics took the male, a Carnegie Mellon student, to the hospital.
Public Intoxication
April 21, 2012
While working the Passion Pit concert on the Mall, University Police were alerted about a male who was unconscious on the ground near Doherty Hall. Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh EMS responded, but were unable to rouse the male due to his heavily intoxicated state. It was determined that he was a University of Pittsburgh student. Pittsburgh medics transported him to the hospital.
Defiant Trespass
April 21, 2012
While working the Passion Pit concert on the Mall, University Police observed four individuals on the rooftop of Wean Hall. An officer responded and identified all four as Carnegie Mellon students who had used a tool to bypass the restrictive feature on the freight elevator to access prohibited areas of the building. All were removed from the roof and were cited internally. Facilities Management Services was alerted to repair the freight elevator.
Alcohol Amnesty
April 22, 2012
University Police and Carnegie Mellon EMS were dispatched to Margaret Morrison Apartments on reports of an intoxicated female. The female had reportedly consumed 20 shots of alcohol throughout the day and had passed out after returning to her room. Pittsburgh medics responded and transported her to UPMC Presbyterian Hospital for further treatment. No citations were issued, as the conditions of alcohol amnesty were met in this case.
Illegal Drug Use
April 24, 2012
University Police and Carnegie Mellon EMS were dispatched to Donner House on a report of a male who was experiencing bad side effects after ingesting LSD. The male was transported to the hospital. An investigation into the source of the drugs is ongoing.
Harassment
April 24, 2012
University Police took a report from a faculty member who was getting repeated mailings from an inmate who is incarcerated in California. A Carnegie Mellon detective is following up with the staff of the institution to get the mailings to stop.

CMU joins IBM in New York City technology consortium
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced last Monday that Carnegie Mellon will be a partner in the city’s Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP), a consortium of academic institutions and technology companies with research space in Brooklyn.
With support from New York City and the city’s Metropolitan Transit Authority, CUSP will research and develop new technologies for cities facing challenges in transportation, energy efficiency, public health, and other areas. Carnegie Mellon joins New York University; the University of Toronto; the City University of New York; and the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay — among other university partners — in the project; IBM and Cisco are among the companies involved. CUSP will confer academic degrees in the sciences or engineering, will start immediate work in Brooklyn, and is expecting to fully renovate a building there as a research hub by 2017.
Carnegie Mellon’s participation in the CUSP proposal has been led by Richard McCollough, the university’s vice president for research, and James Garrett, the head of the civil and environmental engineering department.
The center is the second stage of Bloomberg’s Applied Science NYC initiative, which in the first stage last December announced a joint “technology campus” between Cornell University and the Technion in Israel. The mayor hopes to increase New York’s presence in applied sciences and to foster connections with major research universities worldwide.
Young people drive better with tactile GPS instructions
Reinforcing a car’s GPS directions with tactile stimuli keeps some drivers’ eyes on the road longer, according to a recent study conducted at Carnegie Mellon.
Researchers in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII) and at AT&T Labs produced a driving simulation using a new steering wheel lined with 20 vibrating actuators. Vibrating in a clockwise pattern signalled the driver to turn right, while a counter-clockwise pattern indicated a left turn. The team tested the use of steering wheel feedback in the simulation on a group of 16 drivers under age 36 and 17 drivers over age 65.
Compared to the standard audio instructions provided by a normal GPS, drivers of all ages in the simulation spent more time looking at the road when they had access to the tactile information in the steering wheel as well. 
Combining audio, tactile, and graphical information, however, was only helpful to younger drivers, who favored the added visual instructions over the audio version.
“Our findings suggest that, as navigation systems become more elaborate, it would be best to personalize the sensory feedback system based, at least in part, on the driver’s age,” said SeungJun Kim, a systems scientist in the HCII, in a university press release. 
For older motorists, the study said, it may be better for future GPS systems to keep a driver’s cognitive load small rather than be concerned with dividing the driver’s attention.

I've written before about how Carnegie Mellon administrators should communicate with undergraduate students more "CMU needs to think of students first," (Sept. 12, 2011). I was pleased, then, when I received an email from Michael Murphy, the vice president for student affairs, announcing that the university was hosting two town hall meetings to discuss some potential changes as outlined in the 2012 Master Plan.
Overall, the administration has done a fairly good job of communicating with the community about the new master plan for the campus. As The Tartan Editorial Board has noted (Oct. 3, 2011), the administration has held numerous town hall meetings and has worked to keep the overall process transparent, allowing staff and students to be involved.
However, when I finished reading this particular town hall announcement, it left me more irritated at than appreciative of administrators' efforts. The meeting aims to "[capture] your insights as to buildings, connections between buildings, pedestrian and traffic flows and open spaces that are more or less successful," according to Murphy's email. But if Campus Design and Facilities Development wants to capture the insights of students, why on Earth are they holding these town hall meetings in the middle of June, with less than a week's notice?
I understand that faculty and staff are around during the summer, as well as a smattering of summer students, but the majority of students leave Pittsburgh for the summer, and the students are the ones who would be most affected by changes in open spaces and pedestrian flows. If the administration really wants to gather students' opinions, it should hold these meetings during the school year, or at least in the one or two weeks immediately preceding the start of school, so that more students would be able to attend.
Perhaps the administration really wants to gather students' opinions, but doesn't want to wait until the school year to start making progress on the master plan. If that's the case, they should use one of the primary mediums of communication for college students: the internet. The administration could set up some sort of online forum or comment form, where students would need to sign in with their Andrew ID and then could have conversations about the changes they would like to see on campus.
Of course, despite being one of the top schools for computer science in the country, Carnegie Mellon does seem to have problems fully harnessing its online capabilities, as evidenced by the course registration debacle last semester. But if Carnegie Mellon better utilized the talent of its students, faculty, and staff to improve communication, concerned members of the school community would be truly appreciative.
I know a few town hall meetings might not seem like that big of a deal, but, as in all relationships, it's the little things that count. If Carnegie Mellon wants to improve its relationship with undergraduates so that its rate of alumni gifts will be higher than a mere 16 percent, a sincere attempt at communication could go a long way.

At the close of every school year, The Tartan reassesses the year’s events. We present here a list of the people and happenings that are worthy of recognition. Thistles go to people and events that had a positive effect on the campus community and the world at large; thorns go to those that have negatively impacted the community.
A thistle to Bill Dietrich. His posthumous donation of $265 million, in honor of his mother, is both generous and touching.  We are honored to be a part of the Dietrich family legacy. 
A thorn for the announcement of Carnegie Mellon’s Rwanda campus. Rwanda is a country with a history filled with violence, genocide, and infringements on free speech (to name a few). Carnegie Mellon stands for none of those things on its Pittsburgh campus, and administrators should have held public discussions before entering into this partnership.
A thistle for Pittsburgh’s growing film industry. High-profile movies in production, such as The Dark Knight Rises, brought some much-deserved attention to Pittsburgh’s great qualities. Moreover, movie filming means a boost to the city’s economy.
A thorn for the announcement of more Port Authority bus route cuts. The proposed cuts would greatly affect students and Pittsburgh’s transit users. Measures must be taken to ensure that transportation to important locations is available to students.
A thistle to Carnegie Mellon’s very own Quidditch team, the CMU Marauders. The sport has been a growing trend on college campuses, and it is great to finally have a team at Carnegie Mellon.
A thorn for tuition increases. Even though we met our $1 billion Inspire Innovation campaign goal, tuition still increased for next year. The fact that Carnegie Mellon has received $1 billion. Yet students are still asked to pay an even greater amount of money is preposterous. Carnegie Mellon is already one of the top 10 most expensive schools in the United States, a title we shouldn’t be proud of.
A thistle to AB Concerts and Shows for their choice of entertainers for Spring Carnival 2012. Attracting headliners such as comedians Streeter Seidell and Nick Offerman — as well as musical performer Passion Pit — truly livened up Spring Carnival and enticed students to attend the shows. Hopefully Activities Board can get equally entertaining performers for future Spring Carnival concerts and shows.
A thorn to Mark Zuckerberg. His stop at Carnegie Mellon last semester was exciting, but the fact that the talk was limited to students with technical majors — and that it allowed for no direct media or press coverage — was directly opposed to his goal of creating a more open flow of information.
A thistle to this year’s student body president candidates. This year’s (SBP) elections had an unprecedented five tickets. This shows how many students care about student government and want to have a voice in the university system. The tickets each brought their own ideas and showed how diverse our school is.
A thorn for the bomb threats at the University of Pittsburgh this semester. The threats were extremely disruptive, forcing professors at Pitt to cancel classes and frustrating students to the point where they moved off campus. We hope that the threats will not continue next semester and that the perpetrator(s) of these threats will be prosecuted.
A thistle to the University of Pittsburgh Police Department, the Carnegie Mellon University Police, and the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police for their service this semester. During these trying times, their work has helped keep students and faculty safe. Our deepest gratitude goes out to them.
A thorn for the Facebook Timeline update. Facebook has undergone many changes over the past year, not all of them good. With its cover photo and confusing format, Timeline is conducive to stalking but not much else.
A thistle for the new Student Information Online (SIO) integration with Online Registration. This enhanced interface has been very helpful. The new SIO improves planning course schedules, and it looks much nicer than the old system.
A thorn for SIO’s lack of stress testing before registration. When every student has to use the same method to register for classes, failing to ensure that the system can handle the traffic is unacceptable, especially for a renowned computer science school like Carnegie Mellon.
A thistle for the Occupy movement. The motion showed a level of interest and activism in the current state of the country that, regardless of one’s political views, is admirable and preferable to rampant apathy.
A thorn for the Kiva Han and Waffle Shop closings. Their absence is devastating not only for the decrease in delicious food, but also because it marks the downfall of the local shops. Small businesses serving hyperlocal constituents seem to have no place in Pittsburgh — Kiva Han is being replaced by a larger chain restaurant, the Bagel Factory.
A thistle for Carnegie Mellon’s efforts to run entirely on wind-generated power in 2012. Green measures such as wind power may be more expensive, but they are worth it in consideration of the environmental impact.
A thorn to Pennsylvania State University for its handling of the Jerry Sandusky scandal. Universities must remember to always put the safety of their students and the general population before reputation.
A thistle for the announced revival of the critically acclaimed television series Arrested Development. The show will be starting up again with a full-length movie and a new 10-episode season in early 2013. Best of all, the show’s original characters will still be there, playing the roles we’ve come to know and love. Start practicing your chicken dance.
A thorn to the North Shore Connector. Its incredibly expensive construction under the Allegheny River seems wasteful in the City of Bridges.
A thistle for the student body president impeachment motion. While the need to call for a motion to impeach was saddening, it shows that Undergraduate Student Senate wanted to take a stand and ensure that student government was running properly. Senate members made a statement that a student government position is a real position of power, and not something to fill out a résumé.
A thorn to Google+. The social network has Hangouts, but no one to hang with. Beyond that, it integrated its ghost town into everyday search results, diluting the quality of its searches in a desperate attempt to get traction in the social networking sphere.
A thistle to the improved SquirrelMail. SquirrelMail has traditionally been so bad that Carnegie Mellon’s naturally tech-savvy students have abandoned it in favor of email clients like Gmail. Here’s to SquirrelMail’s facelift and the eventual hope that it becomes even better.
A thorn to College Magazine for naming Carnegie Mellon the ninth-most hipster campus in the United States. At Carnegie Mellon, we don’t believe in labels.
A thistle to President Jared Cohon for his 15 years of service to Carnegie Mellon. Since we will be welcoming a new president in 2013, it seems fitting to thank him now for his work at this school and all the progress that has occurred under his leadership.

Most services at Carnegie Mellon would probably be best described as “perfectly adequate.” Health Services system? Eh, it works. The CAMEO library interface? It is hard to use, but seems to run all right. Blackboard? It’s a pain in the butt, but we’ll live, I guess.
The Student Information Online (SIO) resource? It has a few glitches, but up until last Monday it was about as perfectly adequate as a system can get.
Last Monday, as with most registration days, I dragged myself out of bed at 9 a.m. to register. About 10 minutes prior to my start time I noticed SIO was getting a little slow and then, without warning, it collapsed like a shoddy FEMA trailer. Suddenly SIO went from “perfectly adequate” to “far below standards.” Some hours later, The HUB reported on its website that everyone’s registration time was delayed by one day.
At first, my question was, “Why didn’t anyone in the registration department bother to have the system stress tested before using it for registration?”
But after thinking a moment, the answer is easy: At a school prized for being top notch in nearly every field, Carnegie Mellon is happy with its internal services being perfectly adequate. Not good — not even great — just barely serviceable and, in cases like this, non-functioning at crucial times.
SIO has actually been a prime example of this over the last year. The service has been aiming to replace ScheduleMan.org for a while now, even going so far as to produce an oddly similar interface.
Even though the service was uglier, less usable, and harder to navigate than ScheduleMan, most students seemed to not mind using it for things like course audits and grade checking.
That was until this semester, when the school announced that students would be registering through SIO rather than the usual Online Registration (OLR) — which was about as horribly put together as a non-Geocities website can get. We weren’t thrilled, but we dealt with it because the service was, at that point, at least functional, if not spectacular.
But with each slip like this, it’s becoming clear that the school needs to step up its usability game. The ScottyLabs initiative and new TartanHacks organization are good starts to this — making university interfaces more open to student development (and fostering that development) might encourage registration handlers to step up their game in the web tech department.
The university should pursue a policy of maintaining clear, usable, well-built systems that can be relied on in all situations — services that showcase the school’s world-renowned Human-Computer Interaction Institute and computer science department rather than slapping them in the face with services like SIO, OLR, and other student services.
To do otherwise is not just burdensome on the student body; it’s settling for adequacy, and that is not what Carnegie Mellon is about.

(Don’t worry Senate, this article’s on me.)
I recently sat in on a meeting where GSA and CMU’s undergraduate Senate were reviewing budget appeals that had recently just gone through the Joint Funding Committee. Since I’ve paid my student activities fee, I was glad I got to see exactly how all this money is being handled.
One thing, however, I was not expecting, was such a conflict over The Tartan’s budget. Essentially, The Tartan would like to pay some of their staff, just like Activities Board Tech and cmuTV do, as incentive to write a wider range of articles. The majority of Senate did not like this idea.
The Tartan was referred to on multiple occasions as an organization that could not be compared to AB Tech or cmuTV because they were a serviceless organization. People in the Senate added that if they needed to pay someone to write an article, they would need to pay people to read it too, and if the Tartan were to fold, nothing would change. I was shocked to see a resounding majority of Senate agree with this, and if it weren’t for GSA, the money would have been removed from the budget. (Thank you, GSA!)
I thought I could safely assume we’ve all made it past high school, but this leads me to ask, do these people not know anything about U.S. history? In what world is a newspaper a serviceless organization? Last time I checked, a newspaper’s sole purpose was to service its community, much like what the Senate should be doing.
I am also forced to wonder, how many people are actually reading this, and was the Senate right? How much importance does Carnegie Mellon put on what used to be such a significant American institution?
Newspapers play an integral role in sharing information and keeping facts before the public. Because of this, I am writing to encourage whoever is reading this to sit in on the next Senate meeting. It’s our money and it’s our responsibility to make sure we let the Senate know just how important this newspaper really is.

The U.S. system of voting registration is not known for being robust or strong.
On the contrary, it is known for being ineffective in registering the public at large, as well as inaccurate, costly, and obsolete. More than a million deceased are still on the voter rolls, and one of every eight voter registrations are either invalid or inaccurate. Another problem is the ease with which people can register in multiple states. Partially because of the system’s ineptitude, over 50 million eligible voters are not registered.
A big part of the problem is that the system is paper based, which is hard to update as voters change districts or move from state to state. Although this does not directly result in voter fraud, it does increase the system’s susceptibility.
The second problem with our system is the cost. It costs 12 times more to register a single voter in the U.S. than it does in Canada. Much of this cost is borne by state and local government budgets, money that could easily be better spent elsewhere.
The Caltech/MIT Voting Technology Project estimated that one third of county and local election offices’ budgets is spent on voter registration alone.
This paper based system is also the biggest cause of inefficiency in our voting system. Computers could easily compare data of voting registrations between states to reduce the number of double registrations and registered deceased, which would make fraud much more difficult to execute.
A third issue is the sheer number of registrations that all come into the system in a short, concentrated period before election day. Recording all this new data through paper registration in a timely manner invites human error because all of it must be entered manually. This also results in people not being entered into the rolls in time, meaning many ballots that should be legitimate are thrown out.
I was affected by this, discovering this past Tuesday that my registration was botched, rendering me unable to vote in the primaries. This ample room for error affects our elections and affects the people who get elected and the type of government we have. Elections are supposed to demonstrate the will of the people, and our current system fails miserably.
To fix this system, data-matching methods should be implemented to catch multiple registrations and inaccuracies in the voter rolls. The process of registration must also be made cheaper by enabling Americans to register online, minimizing manual data entry by making the system electronic. It is time for our voting system to enter the 21st century.

Retailer Urban Outfitters is receiving backlash from both Jewish and non-Jewish groups over a controversial T-shirt design. The shirt, yellow in color, includes a six-pointed star embroidered directly over the breast pocket. Many have drawn connections with the yellow badge that was forced upon Jewish people during the Nazi regime. The entire design prompted connections to the Holocaust, especially because it was released in the same week as Holocaust Remembrance Day.
The shirt is part of the spring/summer collection of Danish fashion label Wood Wood, and the design was posted on Urban Outfitters’ website on April 19 for $100. Since the posting of the design, organizations such as the Anti-Defamation League have voiced their opinion. “We find this use of symbolism to be extremely distasteful and offensive,” Barry Morrison, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League, wrote in a letter emailed to President and CEO of Urban Outfitters Richard A. Hayne, “and we are outraged that your company would make this product available to your customers.”
In a response on Wood Wood’s website, co-founder Brian Jensen stated, “I assume the image people have reacted to comes from Urban Outfitters’ website. This must be a photograph of an early prototype.” The label claimed that after noticing that the design resembled the controversial badge, it removed the star from the final design. Urban Outfitters also recently removed the image of the shirt with the badge on its online store.
Besides the fact that the shirt is over-priced (a yellow shirt with a pocket is a staggering $100), it is an affront to humanity. To say that the design posted on the website was an earlier form of the final product is ridiculous on two counts. First, there is no precedent for fashion labels to post initial forms of a design on a website. Items on online stores are for purchase and are in no way meant for tracking a shirt from its earlier to final stages.
This statement also brings to mind another deep hole in logic. The shirt recognizably and undoubtedly resembles the Holocaust badge. Any layman — including those who have little knowledge of Jewish history — can identify the badge. The notion that no one from Urban Outfitters, a label that deems itself cultured and trendy, identified the design when it was presented by Wood Wood is impossible to believe. The move was derogatory and, in my view, intentional.
Urban Outfitters has built a reputation for scandalous behavior. They have insulted many minority groups in the past. For St. Patrick’s Day, they sold a T-shirt with “Irish I was Drunk” written in the center. The label has also been under fire from Native Americans, who claimed that the “Navajo” line was a highly distressing trademark violation.
The Wood Wood move was historically and racially insensitive. It was either a publicity stunt — an action by the label to build controversy in order to boost sales — or an intentionally racist move made by a racist fashion label during a racially sensitive week.
In any viewpoint, the shirt cannot be labeled as unintentional. Urban Outfitters should be both legally and financially reprimanded. I’m pushing for a boycott on their clothes. The label wants to push the controversy under the rug, having removed the badge from the shirt, but no formal apology by the company has been presented. Until this happens, I urge those who shop at Urban Outfitters and elsewhere to spread the word.

Although he’s almost reluctantly accepted by the Republican base, Mitt Romney has emerged from a grueling primary season as a better, more defined candidate for President of the United States. Now that Romney is poised to run against President Barack Obama on Nov. 6, what must he do to win?
First off, Romney needs to define himself as a clear contrast to Obama — in means, not ends. Obama is incredibly popular because he can articulate his goals well and sell them to the populace, but he tends to achieve those goals in the absolute worst ways possible.
If Obama says the capital gains tax rate is too low, then Romney should raise that rate to 20 percent, but lower the corporate tax rate to 15 percent.
Romney should also eliminate the loopholes that allow General Electric to pay less than 5 percent of its income in taxes while less powerful companies pay close to the full 35 percent rate.
If healthcare reform is needed, Romneycare (which Romney himself has not renounced) should be embraced as a state solution to a state problem in order to get the federal government out of state efforts to solve their own healthcare problems.
Secondly, Romney needs to demonstrate exactly how these pro-freedom means will better achieve the ends that the American people want, such as economic security and lower unemployment. Romney’s strengths are that he comes from a business background and can solve the economic issues that have been plaguing the nation.
Instead of flinging personal attacks back and forth, Romney should stick to the issues and Obama’s record, and demonstrate why he is the best candidate to get the economy on track.
Third, Romney should pledge to not touch any social issues. This election isn’t about abortion and it’s not about gay marriage; it’s about the economy. That is Romney’s main appeal.
He’s the CEO who can get U.S.A. Corp. out of Chapter 11 and into the prosperity that Americans used to enjoy. If Romney does this, he’ll win over moderate voters who don’t like traditional Republican views on social issues, but desperately want a better economy.
Lastly, Romney needs to pick a solid running mate and commit himself to making tough choices now to prevent tougher choices later.
Social Security is going to run out of money 33 years from now. The Bush tax cuts and Obama’s payroll tax cut are set to expire on the same day; Medicare and Medicaid are driving up the deficit tremendously.
There are people in the GOP who are working to tackle these issues in ways that resonate with conservatives and moderates. These are also some of the people that the GOP base wanted to be their nominee in the first place, people Romney has been hanging out with recently, notably Wisconsin Representative Paul Ryan and Florida Senator Marco Rubio. These people can help Romney define his platform and win in 2012.
Romney isn’t an empty candidate. He’s emerged for the better from a grueling primary season and, if he plays his cards right, can sit in the Oval Office in 2013.
