After the insane regular season we just had, and with the playoff picture thoroughly unknown until the final week of the season, was there any other way for this to end?
Or was it only fitting that a season of back-and-forths, ups and downs, and highs and lows would end with a walk-on transfer quarterback from a community college riding off the field on the shoulders of his teammates, having delivered Georgia its first national championship since 1980?
In the final week of the regular season, all the pieces began to fall into place to give us a glimpse at the possible playoff picture. Georgia finished out their perfect regular season and qualified for the SEC Championship by thrashing Georgia Tech, 45-0, in a once-storied rivalry that’s become lopsided in recent years. Similarly, Alabama finished the job against Auburn, edging their Iron Bowl rivals 24-22 in four overtimes, setting the stage for the SEC Championship between the Bulldogs and the Crimson Tide. In a thriller that turned into a blowout late, Alabama beat Georgia 41-24, claiming the top seed, punching a playoff slot, and throwing Georgia’s season into disarray.
Over in the Big Ten, nobody had punched their ticket to the championship game until the final week of the regular season. In one of college football’s most anticipated rivalry games, Michigan invited Ohio State to Ann Arbor and beat them for the first time in ten years, knocking the Buckeyes out of the playoff chase. The same week, Iowa beat Nebraska 28-21, ending the Cornhuskers’ season of hope with their back-breaking ninth loss and putting the Hawkeyes in the Big Ten Championship. Predictably, Michigan thrashed Iowa, all but guaranteeing their playoff slot with a 12-1 record and a conference championship.
Quietly, Cincinnati ended their season with a 35-13 win over East Carolina, and moved into the AAC Championship Game, where they handled Houston nicely in a 35-20 victory. With a 13-0 record, the committee had little choice but to award the Bearcats the third playoff berth.
This left one spot left for many deserving teams. Georgia, perfect until the SEC Championship, had the most convincing case. Oklahoma State had a great case, with an 11-1 record, until their loss in the Big 12 championship to two-loss Baylor. Oregon, too, had a chance at the last spot, with a 10-2 record, but those hopes were dashed when they were thrashed by Utah in the conference championship, 38-10. In the Big Ten, Ohio State could have been in, but the loss to Michigan, their second on the season, was too much to overlook. In the end, Georgia qualified for the playoff less because of any last-minute heroics, but by process of elimination.
The first round of the playoffs on New Year’s Eve put #1 Alabama against #4 Cincinnati and #2 Michigan against #3 Georgia. In a convincing victory in the Cotton Bowl, Alabama put Cincinnati on the ropes early and never really let up, putting them away by a score of 27-6. Over in the Sugar Bowl, Georgia delivered a similar beatdown to Michigan, only allowing them into the end zone once in a 34-11 thumping. The stage was set for a rematch between the Bulldogs and the Crimson Tide. Both teams had lost only once all season, and now the two were playing for all the marbles.
The national championship game was a big one, for all parties involved. For Alabama coach Nick Saban, this game was his shot to add his seventh national title as Alabama’s head coach, further cementing his legacy as one of the greatest ever to coach college football. For Georgia’s Kirby Smart, it was a chance to not only win the Bulldogs’ first national championship in 41 years, but also to beat his former boss (before being hired by Georgia, Smart was an assistant of Saban’s for several years at Alabama and worked with him during his brief time coaching in the NFL).
The game itself did not disappoint. A defensive battle turned into back-and-forth field goals, and Alabama went into the half with a 9-6 lead. After a sluggish start to the third quarter, Georgia finally found the end zone and, after Alabama’s fourth field goal, the game was nearly level, with Georgia holding a narrow 13-12 advantage. After a play that was initially ruled an incomplete pass but determined to be a fumble on review, Alabama took just four plays to find the end zone, taking the lead, 18-13. But from there, it was all Georgia. Bennett hit Adonai Mitchell from the 40 to take back the lead, Alabama punted from 4th and 12, Bennett found Brock Bowers to make it 26-18, and on the last drive of the game, Alabama quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner Bryce Young threw a pick-six, sealing the game for the Bulldogs and giving them the 33-18 win.
Victory was sweet for Georgia, a school that hasn’t won the national championship in years. And in all likelihood, nobody reveled in the victory more than Smart, who’d finally downed his mentor, and Bennett, who went from a walk-on playing football at a county community college in Mississippi to hoisting his sport’s prettiest trophy on the country’s biggest stage.

With just one week left in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), things are shaping up to be exceedingly interesting with a wide-open field.
Defending champions Algeria will not be repeating their 2019 feat, having been unable to make it out of the group stage and finishing rock bottom of the Group E table with just one point. Tunisia, who finished fourth in 2019, face similar woes. Despite a sub-par performance in the group stage, Tunisia managed to qualify for the round of 16 by the skin of their teeth, taking the last round of 16 spot. In an ironic turn of events, Tunisia then proceeded to knock out Nigeria in a 1-0 game (Nigeria having previously beaten Tunisia 1-0 in the 2019 AFCON third-place match). Their luck, however, ran out on Saturday, and Tunisia is out of the AFCON after a 1-0 loss to Burkina Faso.
Hosts Cameroon, however, are looking at rather good odds. Having made it out of the group stage sitting at the top of the Group A table, Cameroon proceeded to overcome a defiant Comoros 2-1 in the round of 16. The hosts then put up a comfortable 2-0 win over Gambia in last Saturday’s quarterfinal match thanks to a brace by Karl Toko Ekambi, and guaranteed themselves a semifinal place. Similarly, aforementioned Burkina Faso are performing well. Finishing second in Group A behind Cameroon, Burkina Faso gave themselves a scare when a 1-0 lead against 10-man Gabon in the round of 16 was squandered in the first minute of added time by an unfortunate own goal by Adama Guira, but they were ultimately able to edge past Gabon 7-6 on penalties. With a convincing 1-0 win over Tunisia in the quarterfinals despite lower possession, Burkina Faso earned themselves a semifinal spot, where they will play the winner of the Senegal-Equatorial Guinea match.
Although the results of the Senegal-Equatorial Guinea match are still up in the air, the odds are certainly in Senegal’s favor. While Senegal finished the group stage at the top of the Group B table and put up a comfortable 2-0 win over Cape Verde in the round of 16, Equatorial Guinea finished second in Group E behind Ivory Coast and barely edged past Mali 5-6 on penalties on Wednesday. History is also in Senegal’s favor. Although neither side has won the AFCON, Senegal has been the runner-up twice (the last time being in 2019, when the AFCON was last held), while Equatorial Guinea’s highest-ever finish was fourth in 2015. Regardless, nothing is set in stone and Equatorial Guinea may manage to overcome the odds. To do so, however, they will need to put up a very solid performance. Ultimately, this match is Senegal’s to lose.
The match between Egypt and Morocco was a tough contest for both sides. Although Morocco took an early lead when Sofiane Boufal converted from the spot, Egypt drew level with an equalizer by Mohamed Salah in the 53rd minute. Tensions ran high in the last 15 minutes of regular time, and a foul by Egypt led to a brief confrontation between players on both sides, as well as several yellow cards. A fantastic run and cross by Mo Salah in the 100th minute finished off by Trézéguet gave Egypt the 2-1 lead, to which Morocco could not answer. Egypt will face Cameroon in the semifinal match on Thursday, with the former looking to claim their first AFCON title since their back-to-back-to-back streak from 2006 to 2010, and the latter looking to replicate their 2017 feat of overcoming Egypt, as well as taking the AFCON title.
The stakes are monumental for all of the teams headed for the AFCON 2021 semifinals, and the matches are sure to be exciting contests.

In a room filled with infinite conversations and unlimited noise, how is the brain able to focus on a single speaker? In the world of neuroscience and psychology, this is known as the cocktail party problem. 
Since 2016, the Misha Mahowald prize has been awarded annually to the best and brightest in neuromorphic engineering. In December 2021, the prize was awarded to two teams for their research, one of which made groundbreaking contributions into understanding the famous cocktail party problem.
The group, known as The Telluride Auditory Attention Team, included one of Carnegie Mellon’s faculty members, Dr. Barbara Shinn-Cunningham, the director of Carnegie Mellon’s Neuroscience Institute. Other members of the winning team are Edmund Lalor (Principal Investigator, University of Rochester); James O'Sullivan (Trinity College, Dublin), Alan Power (Trinity College, Dublin and University of Cambridge), Nima Mesgarani (University of California, San Francisco), Siddharth Rajaram (Boston University), John Foxe (University of Rochester), Malcolm Slaney (Google Research) and Shihab Shamma (University of Maryland).
Their work began in 2012, during the Telluride Neuromorphic Engineering Cognitive Workshop held annually in Telluride, Colorado. And with funding from the European Union, the Cognitively Controlled Hearing Aid Project was born. 
The team created a real-time Auditory Attention Decoding (AAD) system that measured auditory attention selection and performance using electrical impulses from the scalp. To mimic the cocktail party setting, the system was used in multi-speaker environments. The team published their findings in a paper featured in Cerebral Cortex in July 2015.
The researchers proved that even a single trial of unfiltered electroencephalography (EEG) waves was enough to decode selective attention in a multi-speaker environment. Through this, they discovered that a neural processing speed of 200 milliseconds was enough to solve the cocktail party problem. After a stimulus, such as the start of a conversation, only 200-250 milliseconds were needed to show the maximum correlation between behavior and reconstruction accuracy. In that time, the brain can process a single conversation of interest and react accordingly.
Previous approaches to solving the cocktail party problem involved mapping the cortical pathways that track auditory input. However, this was mainly conducted through cortical surface recordings and magnetoencephalography (MEG). While the researchers of the Telluride Auditory Attention Team also chose to use surface recordings to collect data, they opted for EEGs as opposed to MEGs due to the affordability and non-invasive nature of EEGs.
In the future, the researchers of the Telluride Auditory Attention Team hope to use their findings to create better brain-computer interfaces and hearing aids for those with hearing impairments.

“Good afternoon — please see the attached list of resources that are not permitted to be utilized in the classroom.” 
On August 11, 2021, Central York High School staff received an email from their principal announcing a list of banned teaching materials. Teachers and students alike were quick to notice that most, if not all resources on the list were by authors of color. 
“Let’s just call it what it is — every author on that list is a Black voice,” an anonymous Central York teacher told the York Dispatch. 
The four-page list, titled “Diversity Committee Resources,” includes materials spanning from books to documentaries to TED Talks. Most of the banned items address the issue of racism. 
According to members of the Central York High School Board speaking to the York Dispatch newspaper, the list was created by the school’s diversity committee around August 2020, when the school board was considering a new social studies curriculum inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement. Discussions about the new curriculum prompted heated debates over teachings on white privilege, resulting in the curriculum discussion being tabled indefinitely. 
School officials say that it’s not a “ban,” the materials are simply “frozen” while the board reviews the resources, according to a CNN article. However, the materials are still under review one year later and will be prohibited until the process is over. 
Members of the Central York High School community are concerned that the all-white school board’s decision does not reflect the concerns of their diverse student body, and that such a ban restricts the academic freedom of their teachers. 
“You have Black children who want to learn about themselves,” said another anonymous Central York teacher, and “teachers who live in fear of presenting that information to them.” No alternatives have been suggested to replace the banned materials, so teachers have few options if they wish to address racism. 
Among the resources proposed to be removed are a Sesame Street and CNN lecture for kids and families, the Pennsylvania Association of School Administrators’ statement against racism, and children’s books about Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. 
In defense of the ban, one school board member explained the situation to the York Dispatch, “The diversity committee came up with resources and development to help them know how to deal with the subject. And some of us took exception to what they were promoting to the teachers."
Another board member said, “We have diversity — we love it, we enjoy it, we celebrate it, we want it — we're not rejecting that. We're rejecting the one-sided pieces of those resources. It was one-sided teaching."
Lauri Lebo, a representative for the Pennsylvania State Education Association, sees the ban as outrageous and insulting. As she told the York Dispatch, “They’re banning material from 'Sesame Street,' but not David Duke. They’re banning PBS, but not the KKK.” 
This ban (or “freeze”) at Central York High School is part of a much larger trend throughout the rest of the country. Campaigns are being led across the U.S. to ban books from schools and even public libraries, usually targeting materials that address the issues of marginalized groups. 
These campaigns are part of the ongoing conservative fight against critical race theory (CRT) being introduced in school curriculums. CRT is a relatively niche legal and academic framework that has been around for over 40 years, focused on examining the ways that racism is structurally embedded in society. CRT is not taught in any K-12 schools, but in current political discourse, the advanced legal framework is often conflated with any discussion of racism at all. In other words, CRT is not a radical new curriculum on the rise, it’s more of a conservative rallying cry. 
Many groups leading the campaign to ban resources appear to be part of an organized effort to ban books in towns and school districts across the U.S., with ties to wealthy right-wing donors. As Central York teachers told CNN, this campaign is about much more than books and movies. They worry that it’s a war on their profession.

On the first day of 2022, every copyrighted work from 1926 (excluding sound recordings) entered the public domain. This means that no party has an exclusive claim to these works anymore, and anyone can now freely use the work with no restrictions, even commercial ones. Notably Winnie the Pooh, whose license was formerly owned by Disney, is now open for creative use by anyone. However, only one specific version of Winnie the Pooh is in the public domain, the one who appeared in “Winnie-The-Pooh” in 1926, written by A. A. Milne and E. H. Shepard. His appearance within this book was as a naked bear that loved honey, which is the version that is now free to use. 
One specific book entering the public domain, however, does not enter every future iteration of the work into the public domain. His appearances from later books, or characters introduced in later books, are still under copyright. Tigger, who first appeared in “The House at Pooh Corner” in 1928, is still owned by Disney, as is Pooh’s famous red shirt, virtually synonymous with the character today. Bambi, a Life in the Woods, Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises, Buster Keaton’s Battling Butler, and Agatha Christie’s Murder of Roger Ackroyd additionally leave copyright protection, alongside many other works.
The entrance into the public domain can be a huge boon to creators. Artists have already been flocking towards Winnie the Pooh, eager to legally create and sell their interpretations of a character functionally identical to the one from their childhood. And last year’s release of The Great Gatsby inspired creativity from both fanfiction writers and published authors, like Michael Farris Smith’s “Nick”, a prequel to F. Scott. Fitzgerald’s seminal work. Working with existing characters can be advantageous for creators, allowing them to leverage preexisting knowledge of characters in their material, as can be seen in the preponderance of wacky adaptations of Jane Austen, incorporations of Alice or the Mad Hatter, or books like “The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.”
Copyright protection can be very important to creators and rights holders, as it allows them complete control over how their creations can be used, and who can use them. A strong copyright system allows symbols to be used exclusively by their owners, preventing any confusion of their meaning by unauthorized parties. They are given exclusive rights to reprint or reproduce the work, sell the work, create derivatives, and publicly display or perform the work. And conversely does not allow non-copyright holders to do any of these without express permission. A strong copyright law theoretically gives the creator more power over their work, and a means to monetize it. Additionally, a strong copyright law incentivizes creatives to develop original works that they can themselves exclusively own.
However, copyright can be controversial. Among the most criticized aspects of American copyright law is the length of time for which it remains in effect. The time frame has drastically increased from 28 years in 1790 to up to 120 years, or 70 years after the death of the author, with the passing of the 1998 “Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act.” The act is mockingly referred to as the Mickey Mouse Protection Act, as it delayed Mickey Mouse’s entrance into the public domain following Disney’s extensive lobbying campaign. Each of these extensions applies retroactively, which has drawn criticism for its lack of benefit to creators. By the time these extensions pass, almost everyone who created the work the bill is relevant to be dead. Instead, the benefit goes solely to the copyright holders. Copyright holders are meant to use their time to create and innovate, but as Hank Brown — one of few minority dissenters in the Senate during the discussions for the Copyright Term Extension Act — said: 
"To suggest that the monopoly use of copyrights for the creator's life plus 50 years after his death is not an adequate incentive to create is absurd, the real incentive here is for corporate owners that bought copyrights to lobby Congress for another 20 years of revenue—not for creators who will be long dead once this term extension takes hold." 
With that extension passing, works were locked away while the 20-year buffer slowly ticked on. Only recently have creations started to enter public domain, with some very important entrances happening soon. Mickey Mouse’s first appearance, “Steamboat Willie”, is now expected to enter the public domain in 2024. This will be 96 years after it’s creation. A new extension may happen soon, considering how much value major media companies like Disney have placed onto their superhero properties, many of which were created in the late ‘30s and early ‘40s. Without this copyright term extension, Superman would have entered public domain in 2013. At the very least, it looks like the first appearance of Mickey (and Minnie!) will finally become free. Until then, create Winnie the Pooh fanfiction to your heart's content, just make sure he isn't wearing a red shirt.

“There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before…
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day”
- Taylor Swift, “New Year’s Day”
“Nothing changes on New Year’s Day”
- U2, “New Year’s Day”
This time of year, after all the hubbub of the holidays is over and all we’re left with is the utter darkness and cold of January (at least here in Pittsburgh), it's easier to reflect on what has just happened to us — to our society — in the past few months and what it all means. 
It’s no secret that the holidays — particularly mainstream ones like Thanksgiving, Hanukkah, Christmas, and New Year’s — have been heavily consumerized and tailored to the vicious nuances of capitalism. Every one of our human desires and flaws has been identified and preyed upon to manipulate how we act, how we feel, and what we buy. The shorter and darker the days become, the more we are sold the concept of holiday cheer and warmth that involves — of course — the purchase of food, gifts, and decorations. 
Possibly the pinnacle of our psychological manipulation happens on the very last day of every year, as we look over the precipice of our lives and change the very numbers we associate with the time we are living in. More than birthdays, the new year is an undeniable reminder of the transience and change inherent to our human lives. Once that clock strikes midnight, there’s nothing you can do to turn it back, and we have been conditioned to think that what we do on that night and the month after can soften the blow of that permanence.
New Year’s Eve is a lot of things, at least from my perspective. New Year’s Eve is alcohol and parties and glitter and crowds. It is to be spent around as many other people as possible, in a cute outfit, with a glass of champagne. You are meant to do whatever possible to avoid thinking about what it all means: what you have or have not done in the last year, how we are just that much closer to irreversible climate damage, how much you are falling short of where society tells you you should be (more on that later). Maybe if you’re lucky, or living in “When Harry Met Sally,” you’ll have someone to kiss at midnight so that you can start the new year off right with a romantic partner, just like society says you should. 
But does a nice lady like myself need a partner to accompany me and my sparkly minidress into the new year? Maybe not, if I’ve taken the time to address all the reformations I need to make to feel like my life is fulfilling within the next month. That’s right. I’m talking about New Year’s resolutions: new year, new me. 
In my experience, capitalism's psychological game makes a particular attack on women during these holidays. In the weeks leading up to the New Year, deprived of the numbing tools we use on New Year’s Eve, many of us find ourselves tallying up the failures of the past year, measuring ourselves against the pretty, skinny, athletic, motherly, career-driven, smart, and at-peace feminine goddess we are supposed to be, every second of every day. We start with one goal for the next year: lose weight (see “Bridget Jones’ Diary”). 
As we dissect what this means for us, things begin to spiral. Losing weight means eating differently and working out. Maybe we need to start shopping at a “higher-quality,” more expensive grocery store — maybe Whole Foods? We should invest in a gym membership. It’s for us, after all — self-care! All this spending means we are gonna need to spend extra time at work or work harder at school — rightfully so, since we have been meaning to focus more on our career, show the world the smart, independent “girlbosses” we are. Then when will we have time for the working out and the cooking? Maybe we’ll start waking up at five in the morning. What’s the loss of a little sleep? Soon there is a daily to-do list, which involves a face mask, solving the New York Times crossword puzzle, and meditation or some alternate spiritual activity associated with a religion we know nothing about and have never researched. 
We are told that all of this is for us, but what is it that motivates us to do it? A genuine desire for self-improvement or the ceaseless need to catch up to the newest, shiniest model of a successful woman that men are selling us to convince us that we are free and independent in society, even if we are not?
Of course, no matter how much you want all of these things, or even want to believe in them, it's rarely possible to do all of it, especially if you are not genuinely motivated. Maybe on New Year’s Day, we force ourselves into a mantra of thinking that our success on this day will be reflected in the 364 days to come, but most feel that they are setting themselves up for a very disappointing and self-flagellating month of January. 
Then that’s that. We repeat the whole process the next year like nothing ever happened like it worked the last time we tried it like we’re Sisyphus himself. Each year we are reminded that we will never live up to the expectations set for us, we will never buy enough or work enough or be enough for a pitiless and voracious system. We do what we can to get by; we drink champagne and we sing songs and maybe we watch a ball slide down a pole and we watch another year pass with a dim hope that maybe the next one won’t end.

I had never seen so many people in my life invested in watching someone reach their 100th birthday until exactly a month ago, until Betty White. Then she died and everyone’s enthusiasm turned to despair right before the start of 2022. Perhaps it’s because Betty White is so beloved and she was still active in her career even through her 90s, giving her a strong, multi-generational fan base; or perhaps it’s because deep down we’re all aware that she’s one of the few celebrities who got to live her whole life without being canceled because she couldn’t be canceled. In the end, only death itself could cancel Betty White, a woman who lived her life pretty much free of scandal or controversy as far as we’re collectively aware. She was and still is an idol, even after death. I’d say that’s a good way to go out. 
However, thinking about her death got me thinking about how we as society view idols. The idolatry of those in power has always been prevalent. But with the internet and social media, the general understanding of idolization is that the highs are higher but the consequences of falling off the mountain are even more severe, leading to complete career deaths. For example, if a celebrity is loved, many members of the public will take to their social media sites to express their admiration in various ways, from tweets that are far too sexual for their own good to terribly edited fan videos to wars in the comments over who is a better person or actor. But if a celebrity is canceled, the blind admiration turns to blind rage, demanding justice for wrongdoings committed by someone the cancel culture crowd doesn’t even know or understand with no nuance in the situation. 
Now to a certain extent, what’s written above is true, but it’s not fully true. First, we need to make a distinction between celebrities and others who have power. Celebrities live in a strange situation where they have power, but it’s not the same kind of power that you’d associate with, say, a politician or a corporation's board of directors. Politicians and board members tend to have to work a bit harder to make themselves appealing to the general public as the public is, rightfully, more skeptical of their behavior. Their power comes much more from their position, and public appeal is a necessary tool they need to achieve their goal of staying in that position. They can become a celebrity in the process, but being a celebrity isn’t the only way they have power.
Celebrities, however, have a lot more opportunities to be beloved figures. They can star in your favorite movie. They can be very funny in interviews. They can be extremely attractive but have no talent whatsoever. With the internet, those opportunities were made more prevalent and widespread, and being a celebrity has become much more of a viable career. Celebrities gain power through public appeal, creating spheres of influence that don’t quite amount to real power like that of a politician, but create the illusion of power and authority that people readily buy into.
As social conditions decay and people’s livelihoods continue to decline in an economic system that has exploited millions and a social structure that has marginalized millions more, it is particularly unfair that there are so many who have the resources to be able to keep themselves in power despite all their misdeeds. This is where canceling people, or “cancel culture,” became a method to tip the social balance. Suddenly all those people in power who couldn’t even be taken down by law enforcement could be exposed, humiliated, and shamed openly by the public for their misdeeds. Rapists and harassers were being removed from positions of power in the face of public backlash, and those who stood by them were shamed for their silence. Movements for equality based on race, gender, and sexuality made progress in exposing how people in power perpetuate discrimination and discriminatory rhetoric, leading to even more exposures. 
That’s not what “cancel culture” is known for anymore, though, and it’s become a meme. On one hand, you can now become a celebrity or bounce back from a controversy just for saying key phrases like “cancel culture is out of control," scaring people into thinking it can happen to them because freedom of speech is “under attack.” On the other hand, some people do get canceled for absolutely no reason, or for statements that were taken entirely out of context. Unfortunately for us all, the reality is far worse. 
Those who participate in “cancel culture” aren’t people who have nothing better to do with their lives. Sure, it is wrong to unleash blind rage on people you don’t know from the comfort of anonymity. But I can’t blame them for doing that or wanting to do that. While there is a huge portion of the crowd who are bandwagoners, there are many who genuinely feel alone or afraid in a world that’s too big to care about their life and problems. At least with trying to cancel people in power, they feel like they can use their anonymity as a source of strength, retaliating against those who make them feel invalidated or powerless. It’s not the healthy way to have a discourse on issues that mean so much to them and it’s not the most efficient way to push for more inclusion, but it’s one of the few methods available to make themselves heard loud and clear.
The wrongdoings of the “cancel culture” crowd pale in comparison to how those against it have used “cancel culture” to forward their own agendas. It became clear fairly early on that celebrities weren’t the only ones who could be affected by the power of cancel culture. Politicians and the higher-ups of corporations were facing the heat too. Naturally, this only prompts those in power to turn this situation in their favor to keep themselves entrenched. It wasn’t long before the movements for equality and safe spaces became obfuscated by concerns of freedom of speech and created “intellectual debates” over the issues rather than acknowledging that the issue was real. The goal was to back the “cancel culture” crowd into a semantic corner, framing the cancellations as stifling discourse, even if the discourse was in bad faith, designed to hide discriminatory views and agendas. 
So now we’re here, at an impasse in our public discourse where those in power have successfully delegitimized the mechanism by which the public can hold them accountable. Yet, I can’t help but think of Betty White in this whole ordeal. She was on this awful planet for almost 100 years and yet didn’t face anything that got her canceled. It made me realize something. It isn’t hard to not be a terrible person and to live a good life where everyone loves you, and deservedly so. 
But the limit of humanity is that we only understand as much as we are told by others, and we can only understand what we’re told through whatever lens we use to understand ourselves. It’s why being empathetic isn’t the best thing you can describe yourself as. Putting yourself in someone else’s shoes is impossible to do. It could very much be the case that Betty White only showed us one side of herself. We will never know the full picture of someone, and in the age of the internet, we don’t even get the whole sides of people. We only get fragments, bits, and pieces we all struggle to put together in whatever echo chambers we entrench ourselves in, trying to belong or be a part of something. It makes it difficult to understand each other, and in that lack of understanding, we fail to reach collective solutions for challenging issues. Betty White isn’t an anomaly in our modern zeitgeist. She’s just another human being, one riddled with the same complexities that we all are. Idolizing Betty White in the way we have continues to feed into the notion that there are ideal people out there who make no visible mistakes, have no ulterior motives, when actually what we should be seeking out are people who live well and try to make amends when they inevitably screw up. So while she is not some goddess, Betty White has taught us the value of trying to be a good person and for that, her legacy will live on.

On January 6, Carnegie Mellon announced that the campus would be shifting into a Modified Campus Posture. This announcement indicated that classes for the first two weeks of the semester would be virtual. This message most likely came as no surprise to most, given the recent number of COVID-19 cases in Pennsylvania, the United States, and across the globe. Just a week prior to Carnegie Mellon’s announcement to go virtual for the first two weeks, the University of Pittsburgh announced a shelter-in-place period that restricted movement across campus, including virtual classes. 
After having a semester of (mostly) in-person classes, moving back to Zoom for just two weeks was a struggle for most. Particularly after a long winter break, the urge to treat Zoom class like a podcast in the background of your sleep cycle is strong. With most classes being designated In-Person Expected (meaning they would be virtual for only two weeks), the reality of post-break exhaustion coupled with being able to take class from bed hit hard. 
This is not to say that Carnegie Mellon shouldn’t have made the move to classes online for the first few weeks of the semester. Given the number of cases that have been reported through the Carnegie Mellon COVID-19 dashboard, it was the right move. Being in-person would have been a risk for the health and safety of campus.
Still, these past two weeks have just set another example on how online classes cannot substitute the same learning experience that students receive in-person. While it might be nice to roll out of bed five minutes before classes start, have your camera off, and then wrap a blanket around your shoulders and scroll through social media on your phone while your professor talks about something that you half-pay attention to, that’s not the best use of students' tuitions dollars. We are paying tuition for quality education, and it’s a lot harder to get it through a Zoom call.
This transition to and from virtual learning has also made its impact on clubs and organizations across campus. Some clubs have just had elections at the end of the fall semester and their new leadership teams have to take care of moving to a virtual setting for two weeks, following Carnegie Mellon guidance, and then figuring out how to transition back to in-person again. That can be rough for students who already have a full workload and are taking on additional responsibilities outside of their already busy schedules.
Though Zoom university may not be a suitable replacement for in-person learning, there’s a chance that students and staff might have to return to a virtual setting in the future. World Health Organization official Maria Van Kerkhove has warned, “The next variant of concern will be more fit, and what we mean by that is it will be more transmissible because it will have to overtake what is currently circulating.” Given the recent case counts at Carnegie Mellon, if a more infectious strain of COVID-19 were to appear, it is almost certain that the university would have to move back to a virtual setting to avoid a large spike in cases again.
As of now, the only thing that Carnegie Mellon students and employees can do is continue to take precautions against COVID-19, which in turn will help reduce the chance of another set of online classes. While Carnegie Mellon is requiring COVID-19 booster shots, masking, and COVID-19 tests, it is up to us to follow the guidelines so we can avoid another surge of cases.

Despite the competitive nature intrinsic to the Olympic Games, shared excitement surrounding the event stokes a sense of international unity. Across the globe, billions of eyes are peeled to screens boasting athletic feats so impressive fans are likely to curb their national pride and watch in awe, untethered. The delirium surrounding the 2022 Games may drown its most critical component: China is hosting. 
Human Rights Watch reported that China’s Communist Party “sees human rights as an existential threat.” And they have the track record to prove it. CCP leader Xi Jinping has enforced militant rule via constant surveillance, stringent censorship, travel restraints, historical erasure, unexplained disappearances, mass incarceration, forced sterilization, systematic rape, labor camps, and reported genocide. 
After accusing a public official of sexual abuse in November, a tennis star disappeared, resurfaced, and retracted the assault claim. A Hong Kong news site was shut down last month to accommodate Beijing’s agitprop standards. The indoctrination, torture, and murder of Uighur Muslims and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang is state-sanctioned. 
The U.S. joined several other countries in diplomatic boycotts against the Beijing Games, yet Xi remains confident. The upcoming Games, he says, “demonstrate [China's] commitment to building a community with a shared future for mankind.”
Pray that that future — replete with human rights abuses — does not come to fruition. Pray and, more importantly, boycott. Viewers are vital stakeholders more than ever before because no tickets are available for the 2022 Games. Pandemic precautions mean that visibility and revenue are only possible through television screenings.
Broadcasting rights comprise 73 percent of the International Olympic Committee’s funding; they are beholden to broadcasting services. If viewership plummets this year, broadcasting companies will be loath to invest as much in future Games. This, in turn, incentivizes the IOC to hold host countries to a higher humanitarian standard. If viewership does not drop, the IOC has no reason to change. 
Xi wants to put on a show, but no one is making you watch. Tuning into the Olympics is an active choice. Is an hour of speed skating worth rewarding China with your attention? If you believe in our democracy enough to vote, then believe in human rights enough to boycott. Whether by vote or view, our choices are powerful. 
Though watching the Games can be fun, missing its coverage is not by any means catastrophic. Xi’s increasingly violent authoritarianism is. There are plenty of alternatives to sate your winter sports cravings. Scour Netflix, watch past Games, experience the sport for yourself. 
The 2022 Games are part of Xi’s broader campaign to bulldoze rights concerns. He’s seen plenty of success; even missteps that have been felt across the globe have been grossly downplayed. Recall late 2019, when doctors in Wuhan noticed something was wrong. Too many infections, too many deaths, all happening too fast. What was going on? Nothing, the government said. “Hospital leaders refused to authorize masks or other personal protective equipment (PPE) because it would cause panic,” wrote Annie Sparrow in a Foreign Policy report. “Hospital leaders insisted that spread among humans was impossible — that no staff members were infected — even altering diagnoses that suggested otherwise.” Doctors who documented the virus disappeared. 
When evidence of COVID-19 became indisputable, CCP leaders announced that they had vaccines with incredible efficacy. Except they didn’t. Case counts continue to be falsely reported, and why shouldn’t they be? The consequences imposed on China for its COVID-19 policies — and the havoc it has wreaked — are negligible. Pandemic dishonesty has been swept into the corner of international conscious, entangled somewhere between dictatorship and genocide. 
Over a quarter of the world watched the last Winter Games. Activists hope that percentage plunges this year. “We postponed the Olympics for a pandemic,”  Tibetan activist and Mount Holyoke student Tsela Zoksang said. “I don’t see why we can’t postpone for genocide.”
Amidst the severity and scope of China’s human rights abuses, it may seem impossible for individual intervention. But action is simple: Boycott the Beijing Games.
